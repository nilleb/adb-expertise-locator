Economic and financial sector reforms that originated in the 1990s resulted \nin sustained  economic growth with  a  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  compound  annual growth rate \n(CAGR) of 7.5% during 2000\u20132012, outperforming India\u2019s GDP CAGR of 4.5% during the preceding \nfour  decades  by  a  wide  margin.  Strong  economic  performance  coupled  with  slower  population \ngrowth has resulted  in  a  dramatic  improvement  in India\u2019s  poverty  headcount  index,  which fell from \n66% in 1977 to 33% in 2009.2 Despite this considerable improvement, recent research underscores \nthat about 680 million Indians, or 56% of the population, continue to lack the income and safety nets \nrequired to meet their essential needs, most of whom are rural dwellers.3 Of particular concern is the \nlagging performance of agriculture, which is the primary source of rural employment and income. \n \n3. \nThe  importance  of  agriculture  to  the  economic  and  social  fabric  goes  well  beyond  its \ncontribution to GDP.  Agriculture has not kept pace with recent growth in India\u2019s broader economy, \nas  productivity  has  stagnated.  Based  on  recent  estimates,  agricultural  productivity  per  worker  in \nIndia  is  60%  lower  than  that  of  construction  and  75%  lower  than  that  of  manufacturing.  Despite \nsignificant improvement in recent decades, India\u2019s agricultural crop yields remain substantially below \nthose  of  its  Southeast  and  East  Asian  peers\u2014ranging  from  10%  to  50%  (with  the  exception  of \nwheat).  This  has  adversely  impacted  the  agriculture  sector\u2019s  contribution  to  GDP,  which  has \ndecreased  considerably  from  42%  in  1961  to  17%  in  2012.  In  spite  of  this  decline,  agriculture \ncontinues to play the predominant role in the rural economy, which comprises some 68% of India\u2019s \npopulation,  providing  73%  of  rural  employment  (much  of  it  undertaken  by  women)  and  generating \n52%  of  rural  household income.4 The  importance  of  agriculture  sector  productivity  is  central  to the \ndevelopment  of  the  rural  economy.  Improving  the  productivity  and  performance  of  the  agriculture \nsector is the most direct route to addressing rural poverty. \n \n4. \nStructural  issues  and  inefficiencies  contribute  to  low  agricultural  productivity.  While  crop, \nfood, and livestock production growth have exceeded population growth since 2009, low agriculture \ngrowth  and  productivity  are  general  problems  across  crops  and  regions,  although  large  interstate \nyield  differences  exist. 5  Low  agricultural  productivity  in  India  stems  from  a  number  of  factors, \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Measured  at  $2  per  day  purchasing  power  parity.

From  Poverty  to  Empowerment:  India\u2019s  Imperative  for  Jobs,  Growth,  and  Effective \n\nBasic Services. Mumbai (February). \n\n4  Some 79% of rural women are involved in  agricultural activity (2010).  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2013. Country \n\nProgram and Strategy: India, 2013\u20132015. Manila (Gender Assessment). \n\n5  Punjab\u2019s grain yield per hectare (2011\u20132012) exceeded that of Odisha and Rajasthan more than three times. Important \nfactors explaining the difference are tractor intensity,  the use of fertilizer, the availability of irrigated land, and, perhaps \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f2 \n \nincluding  (i)  slow  progress  on  land  reforms,  (ii)  inefficient  state-controlled  input  supply  and \nmarketing,  (iii)  inadequate  irrigation  infrastructure  resulting  in  high  dependence  on  rainfall, 6 (iv) \nlimited  research  and  slow  adoption  of  modern  agricultural  practices  and  technologies,  (v)  weak \nintegration  of  farmers  into  the  value  chains  of  agribusiness  companies,  and  (vi)  limited  and  costly \naccess to financial services for farmers. \n \n5. \nAgriculture  production  has been  put  under greater stress  with  the  emergence  of  the middle \nclass. India\u2019s solid GDP growth has improved personal income levels and facilitated the emergence \nof a growing middle class7\u2014a trend that is expected to gain strength over the medium term. Growing \nincome  and  the  expansion  of  the  urban  population  at  a  rate  of  10  million  persons  per  year  has \nresulted in rising demand for quality food and beverage products, which is outpacing the growth of \nsupply.  The  surge  in  food  prices  since  2007  underscores  the  increasing  demand\u2013supply  gap  and \npoints to the tremendous need to improve India\u2019s agriculture productivity. \n \n\n2. \n\nRural Financial Inclusion and the Role of Private Sector Banking \n\n \n6. \nDespite notable improvements, rural residents have inadequate access to finance. Since the \n1990s,  financial  sector  reforms  in  India  have  improved  the  operating  environment  for  banks.  In \nparticular,  the  deregulation  of  interest  rates  and  the  entry  of  new  private  sector  banks  have \nintensified competition, improved sector performance, and enhanced service coverage. Largely as a \nresult,  private  sector  credit  has  grown  significantly,  up  from  25%  of  GDP  in  1990  to  51%  in  2012. \nWhile  the  government  runs  sizeable  subsidized  lending  programs  to  reach  the  unbanked,  it  has \nincreasingly recognized the limited sustainability of such interventions and has acknowledged that a \ncommercial  business  banking  approach  is  needed.  To  ensure  that  banks  place  reasonable \nemphasis on serving the lower-income segments, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) instituted priority \nsector lending (PSL) policies requiring banks to lend at least 40% of their net credit of the previous \nyear to priority sectors. The PSL targets include, among others, agriculture (18%) and economically \nweaker  sectors  (10%).  Notwithstanding  such  policies,  banks  have  not  met  these  PSL  targets  and \nimproving rural financial inclusion has remained a challenge. \n \n7. \nLow financial services depth in agriculture is a major impediment to investment. Agriculture \ngenerated more than 17%\u201319% of GDP during 2007\u20132012, yet the sector only received 11%\u201312% \nof institutional credit. Limited access to affordable funding is the key factor constraining investment \nby  India\u2019s  120  million  small  farmers.  Banking  services  typically  provided  to  farmers  are  usually \nlimited  to  basic  payments  and  deposits  and  to  a  minimal  extent,  credit,  as  traditional  lending \nprocesses require collateral documentation and financial statements that most farmers are unable to \nproduce.  Services  customized  to  a  farmer\u2019s  cash  flow,  for  instance,  are  still  in  their  infancy. \nHowever, creative solutions such as cash flow-based lending are needed to address the interrelated \nchallenge of limited financial inclusion and low agricultural productivity. \n   \nTo address these intertwined challenges and to maximize development impact by reaching a \n8. \nlarge  number  of  small  farmers  to  whom  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  cannot  lend  directly, \nADB  conducted  a  search  of  potential  high-quality  private  banks  with  broad  reach  in  rural  areas, \nsuccessful  lending  programs  serving  small  farmers,  and  which  were  willing  to  partner  with  ADB  to \n\n                                                                                                                                                              \neven  more  so,  the  use  of  farm  credit.  Farm  credit  in  Punjab  exceeded  that  of  Odisha  by  more  than  10 times;  and \ncontributed to farmer access to improved inputs and management for maintaining soil fertility, seed quality and irrigation, \nas well as the application of adequate farming techniques and post-harvest management supported by capital, research, \nand land titling\u2014all of which can have a critical impact on agricultural yields. \n\n6  Nearly 70% of the net sown area is in rain-fed agriculture. \n7  Some  20%  of  India\u2019s  240  million  households  can  be  characterized  as  high  to  upper-middle  income  (>$7,400/annum), \nwhile  30%  are  lower-middle  income  (>$3,300\u2264$7,400/annum)  and  50%  are  low-income.  The  upper-middle-income \nsegment spends 20%\u201335% of their income on food and beverages, while the lower-middle-income segment spends up \nto 45% on this expenditure item. The average Indian household spends 31% on food and beverages. \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\ndeepen  rural  financial  inclusion.  Two  commercial  banks  were  identified\u2014ABL,  India\u2019s  third  largest \nprivate bank, and YBL, the fourth largest. Through dedicated inclusive business units, which target \nagriculture  and  financial  inclusion,  both  banks  have  initiated  the  development  of  innovative \ncommercial  inclusive  finance  solutions  for  the  rural  unbanked,  particularly  women,  and  better \nintegration of farmers in the agriculture value chain. \n \nB. \n\nAxis Bank Limited \n\n9. \nBusiness  overview  and  strategy.  Established  in 1994,  ABL is  India\u2019s  third  largest  private \nbank  with  total  assets  of  Rs3,832  billion  ($63.96  billion,  end  of  FY2014) .  Since  FY2011,  ABL  has \ndiversified  its  asset  mix  by  expanding  its  retail  franchise  and  strengthening  its  small  and  medium-\nsized  enterprises  (SMEs)  lending,  and  has  grown  its  distribution  network  to  2,402 branches  in  29 \nstates  &  5  Union  Territories.  ABL\u2019s  business  strategy  leverages  on  domestic  growth  opportunities. \nABL regards agricultural lending and financial inclusion as an integral component of its rural strategy \nto further extend its reach in the rural market.. \n \n10. \nOwnership.  ABL  was  founded  by  its  state-owned  promoters\u2014Unit  Trust  of  India, \nsubsequently  the  administrator  of  the  Special  Undertaking  of  the  Unit  Trust  of  India  (SUUTI);  Life \nInsurance Corporation of India (LIC); General Insurance Corporation of India; and four other public \nsector insurance companies. ABL is listed on the national and Bombay stock exchanges. Following \nthe  March  2014  sale  of  share  capital  by  SUUTI,  state  ownership  fell  to  29.2%,  with  LIC  holding \n13.5%  and  SUUTI  11.7%  as  of  30  June  2014.  Ownership  is  well  diversified,  with  59.5%  held  by \nprivate  institutional  investors,  and  8.0%  by  private  non-institutional  investors  (corporates  and/or \nindividuals), each holding below 5% interest\u2014the RBI significance threshold level. \n \n11.  Management  and  governance.  Consistent  with  the  listing  requirements  of  the  stock \nexchanges,  RBI,  and  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  regulations,  as  on  31st  March, \n2014 ABL is controlled by a 14-member board of directors, half of whom are independent. The board \nis  well  supported  by  a  system  of  committees,  including  the  committee  of  directors;  and  the  audit, \nhuman  resources  and  remuneration,  risk  management,  customer  service,  and  information \ntechnology  strategy  committees.  ABL\u2019s  senior  management, \nfor  day-to-day \nmanagement  of  ABL,  is  led  by  Mrs.  S.  Sharma  and  consists  of  20  other  senior  managers,  all \nexperienced  professionals  who  head  business  lines,  business  support,  and  independent  risk  and \ncontrol functions. ABL has a centralized decision-making model with policy and approvals provided \nby the head office in Mumbai, while its branches focus on customer relationships. \n \n12. \nCapital  adequacy.  ABL has  maintained sound capital  adequacy  over  FY2011\u2013FY2014,  as \ncapital growth has kept pace with the rise in risk-weighted assets. In line with RBI regulations, ABL \nbegan the phased transition to Basel III capital adequacy guidelines in April 2013. As a result of the \nchange in treatment of Tier 2 capital in the computation of the capital charge, ABL\u2019s total capital ratio \nslightly declined from the previous year to 16.1% as of the end of FY2014, while the Tier 1 capital \nratio increased to 12.6%. \n \n13.  Loan  portfolio  and  asset  quality.  After  loan  portfolio  growth  of  19.2%  in  FY2012,  its  pace \nslowed  moderately  to  16.0%  in  FY2013  and  to  16.8%  in  FY2014.  Despite  the  macroeconomic \nslowdown, asset quality has remained stable with ABL pursuing new lending opportunities targeting \nhighly  rated  companies.  Contrastingly,  and  consistent  with  ABL\u2019s  diversification  strategy,  the  retail \nportfolio  grew  at  a  CAGR  of  almost  39.0%  per  annum  during  FY2011\u2013FY2014.  ABL\u2019s  agricultural \nand SME portfolio growth has increased since FY2011, rising by 19.1% in FY2014.  \n \n13. \nFunding.  The  Bank  is  primarily  funded  through  its  stable  deposit  base.  ABL  has  issued \nsubordinated bonds and entered into bilateral placements overseas to raise short- to medium-term \nfunds (1- to 3-year tenor). ABL has an annual funding plan to raise at least $1 billion during FY2015\u2013\nFY2017,  which  it  plans  to  close  through  offshore  issuances  via  medium-term  notes,  bilateral  and \n \n\nresponsible \n\n\f4 \n \nclub  loans,  in  addition  to  sourcing  funds  from  entities  such  as  international  financial  institutions \n(IFIs).  \n \n14. \nEarnings performance. ABL\u2019s net income grew at a CAGR of 22.4% over FY2011\u2013FY2014, \nfrom  Rs33.9  billion  to  Rs62.2  billion.  Helped  by  the  diversification  in  assets  toward  the  higher-\nyielding  retail  portfolio  and  a  deposit-dominated  low-cost  funding  base,  net  interest  income  growth \nwas  healthy,  rising  by  20.6%  in  FY2013  and  by  23.6%  in  FY2014.  Fee  income  also  increased, \nclimbing by 16.8% in FY2013 before slowing to 8.4% in FY2014. ABL\u2019s profitability remained sound \nin 2014, with a return on average assets (ROAA) of 1.8% and a return on average equity (ROAE) of \n18.2%. \n \nC. \n\nYES Bank Limited \n\nBusiness overview and strategy. Established in 2004, YBL is India\u2019s fourth largest private \n15. \nbank  with  total  assets  of  Rs1,090  billion  ($17.7  billion)  as  of  the  end  of  FY2014.  YBL\u2019s  corporate, \nretail,  SME,  and  inclusive  business  platforms  offer  comprehensive  services  through  its  network  of \n560 branches. Acting largely as a wholesale bank during its early years, YBL under its 2010\u20132015 \nstrategy  is  diversifying  its  portfolio  by  emphasizing  growth  in  its  retail  and  inclusive  and  social \nbusiness  lines.  YBL\u2019s  Inclusive  and  Social  Banking  Division,  through  its  YES  Livelihood \nEnhancement  Action  Program,  focuses  on  developing  outreach  to  small  farmers,  using  YBL\u2019s \nagribusiness corporate relationships, and low-income women self-help groups (SHGs) in villages, in \npartnership with its business correspondents acting as service intermediaries.8 \n \n16. \nOwnership.  The  founders,  R.  Kapoor  and  the  family  of  the  late  A.  Kapur,  collectively  own \n22.2% of YBL\u2019s share capital. The remaining 77.8% of the shares are held by insurance companies \n(of which LIC holds the largest 7.4% interest), foreign institutional investors, and mutual funds, which \nown 60.6%, and individuals and trusts, which own 9.8%. YBL shares are listed on both the national \nand  Bombay  exchanges.  Except  for  the  founders  and  LIC,  all  shareholders  are  below  the  RBI \nsignificance threshold of 5.0%. \n \n17.  Management and governance. Daily management of YBL is undertaken by an experienced \nmanagement  team  headed  by  R.  Kapoor,  a  well-established  businessman,  who  previously  co-\nfounded  Rabobank\u2019s  Indian  corporate  finance  and  investment  banking  subsidiary,  Rabo  India \nFinance  Pvt.  Ltd.  YBL\u2019s  10-member  board  is  composed  of  seven  independent  directors.  The \nremaining  directors  include  R.  Kapoor,  as  both  promoter  and  chief  executive  officer,  and  two \nnonexecutive, non-independent directors. Responsible for policy formulation, strategy, performance \noversight, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations, the  board is adequately supported \nby  committees,  including  the  audit,  risk  monitoring,  capital  raising,  and  information  technology \nstrategy committees.  \n \n18. \nCapital  adequacy.  YBL  has  demonstrated  its  ability  to  raise  capital  to  support  its  asset \ngrowth,  as  evidenced  by  its  initial  public  offering  in  FY2005  and  its  four  subsequent  market \nplacements,  as  well  as  internal  capital  generation  through  retained  earnings  and  perpetual  debt \ninstruments. Subsequent to its placement of $500 million on 30 May 2014, YBL\u2019s Tier 1 capital ratio \nstrengthened  to  13.0%,  while  the  total  capital  ratio  rose  to  18.0%\u2014well  above  the  RBI  prudential \nlimit. The May 2014 placement was five times oversubscribed, highlighting strong international and \ndomestic confidence in YBL. \n \n\n                                                \n8 Business correspondents in India are organized as companies or nongovernment organizations with in-depth experience \nin  forming  and  managing  self-help  groups.  Business  correspondents  that  are  affiliated  with  microfinance  companies \nhave the additional benefit of skills in customer credit evaluation and management.     \n\n \n\n\f19. \nLoan  portfolio and  asset  quality. From FY2011 to FY2014, YBL\u2019s loan portfolio grew at a \nCAGR  of  17.4%.  Although  large  companies  continue  to  comprise  the  largest  part  of  its  loans, \nlending  to  this  segment  decreased  in  FY2014  in  line  with  YBL\u2019s  risk  and  income  diversification \nstrategy.  Retail,  which includes inclusive and  social  banking,  experienced  the  highest  loan growth, \nmore than doubling in FY2014. YBL\u2019s inclusive and social lending activities involve lending to SHGs \ncoordinated  by  selected  business  correspondents.  Although  from  a  low  base,  YBL\u2019s  inclusive  and \nsocial  banking  exposure  tripled  in FY2014 to  Rs6.6  billion.  YBL  is  also  interested  in developing  its \nagribusiness  portfolio,  seeing  significant  growth  potential  in  agribusiness,  particularly  value  chain \ndirect farmer lending. During FY2012\u2013FY2014, YBL\u2019s agribusiness portfolio expanded at an average \nof 13.0% per annum to reach Rs63.2 billion as of the end of FY2014. YBL\u2019s asset quality is strong \ncompared  with  its  private  bank  peers.  Asset  quality  of  YBL\u2019s  agriculture-related  portfolio  also \nremained solid, with a gross NPA ratio (RBI definition) of 0.03% as of the end of FY2014, down from \n0.16% as of the end of FY2012. \n \n20. \nFunding.  In  spite  of  high  inflation  during  the  past  few  years,  YBL\u2019s  deposits  have  grown \nbriskly, rising by over 36.0% in FY2013 and by another 10.8% in FY2014. YBL\u2019s deposit mobilization \nhas  shifted  from  more  volatile  corporate  deposits  toward  more  diversified,  albeit  short-term,  retail \ndeposits as a key funding source. Current and savings accounts represented 22.0% of deposits as \nof  the  end  of  FY2014.  To  address  YBL\u2019s  need  for  longer  and  more  stable  funding,  borrowings, \nparticularly  from  IFIs,  have  become  increasingly  important\u2014funding  an  annual  average  of  $924 \nmillion during FY2011\u2013FY2014. \n \n21. \nEarnings  performance.  YBL\u2019s  earnings  have  been  consistently  strong,  with  net  income \nincreasing  from  Rs7.3  billion  in  FY2011  to  Rs16.2  billion  in  FY2014  (CAGR  of  30.5%).  Income \ngrowth during FY2011\u2013FY2014 has been supported by strong growth in net interest income (CAGR \nof  29.6%)  and  fee  income  (CAGR  of  29.0%).  YBL\u2019s  profitability  is  strong,  with  ROAA  exceeding \n1.5% and return on equity exceeding 20.0% since FY2009. In FY2014, ROAA was 1.6% and return \non equity was 25.0%. \n \nD. \n\nUnique Features \n\nThe project would constitute ADB\u2019s first nonsovereign intervention in India that targets small \n\n22. \nfarmers and low-income women through private banks. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\n23. \nThe  assistance  includes  two  senior  unsecured  loans,  one  of  up  to  $200  million  (or  Indian \nrupee equivalent) with a 7-year tenor to YBL and a second of up to $200 million with a 7-year tenor \nto ABL, and a capacity development TA grant of up to $2 million to both ABL and YBL. In line with \nADB  policies,  both  banks  will  lend  the  Indian  rupee  equivalent  amount  of  ADB\u2019s  aggregate  loan \ndisbursements  to  eligible  borrowers  to  finance  working  capital  and  investment  loans  targeting  (i) \nsmall  farm  households,  and  (ii)  rural  women,  organized  in  either  savings  and  credit  SHGs  or  joint \nliability groups. In line with ADB\u2019s cofinancing strategy, a portion of the risk on ADB\u2019s loans may be \ntransferred to counterparties.9 \n \nB. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nDedicated  agriculture  and  inclusive  business  credit  teams  in  ABL  and  YBL  will  select  and \n24. \nmonitor  the  subloans  consistent  with  both  banks\u2019  lending  policies  and  performance-tracking \n\n                                                \n9  The terms of the risk transfer agreements, if any, will be subject to approval by ADB\u2019s Investment Committee. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n \nsystems.  ABL  and  YBL  will  each  provide  (i)  annual  financial  statements;  (ii)  quarterly  compliance \ncertificates  for  agreed  covenants;  (iii)  semiannual  progress  updates  on  (a)  their  rural  service \noutreach,  (b) the  use  of  subloans,  (c)  progress  updates  on  relevant  design  and  monitoring  (DMF) \nindicators,  and  (d)  progress  updates  on  the  TA  implementation  and  impact;  and  (iv)  annual \nenvironmental and social management system (ESMS) reports. \n \nC. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n25. \n\nThe ADB assistance is expected to have the following value additions: \n(i) \n\nlending  models  for  priority  sectors  and \n\ninclusive \nSupport  of  scalable \nagriculture  growth.  The  current  level  of  commercial  bank  lending  to  agriculture \nremains inadequate and limited access to finance for  the rural population limits their \nability to undertake critical investments to improve  yields and income. Although ABL \nand  YBL  have  done  some  successful  groundwork  since  2010  in  developing  lending \nmodels for supporting small farms and rural women, the banks still remain below the \nRBI-instituted PSL targets. By channeling funds and providing TA to ABL and YBL for \nlending  to  small  farmers  and  rural  women,  ADB\u2019s  support  will  not  only  contribute \nappreciably  towards  both  banks\u2019  efforts  to  meet  PSL  targets,  but  also  signal  to  the \nmarket  and  catalyze  more  local  bank  finance  to  support  the  development  of  this \nimportant sector, helping to alleviate rural poverty. \nStrengthening  the  banking  sector  by  providing  bank  access  to  long-term \nfunding. Banks in India largely lend from short-term, less stable deposits because of \ndifficulties  in  sourcing  sufficient  long-term  financing,  given  the  developing  nature  of \nthe  country\u2019s  financial  sector.  Increasing  competition  for  deposits  and  the  Basel  III \nmandated  need  for  more  stable  funding  sources  requires  banks  to  borrow  from \ndiversified sources to fill large funding gaps, including IFIs. ADB\u2019s loans will make a \nsizeable contribution to ABL and YBL\u2019s funding in support of rural financial inclusion. \nTechnical  assistance.  ADB\u2019s  TA  will  directly  complement  ADB\u2019s  credit  lines, \nsupporting  the  buildup  of  both  banks\u2019  inclusive  business  strategies  via  business \ncorrespondents  and  targeted  lending  products  to  small  farmers,  using  innovative \napproaches  for  linking  them  to  markets.  ADB\u2019s  TA  will  help  improve  the  integrity  of \ncredit data at the farmer level, and enhance credit assessment and risk management \nat both banks, which will benefit farmers with improved access to credit. With ADB\u2019s \nassistance, the banks\u2019 business models can become scalable and replicable flagship \ninitiatives to support inclusive and commercially viable approaches to funding farmers \nand women borrowers through SHGs. \nEffective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  assistance  includes  a  comprehensive \napproach to improve YBL\u2019s ability to reach an additional 2.5 million rural, low-income \nwomen.  This  includes  women\u2019s  awareness  of  financial  planning,  savings,  and \nborrowing for their farm and household needs as reflected in the gender action plan.  \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nA. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nThe expected impact is improved financial inclusion for small farmers and women SHGs, as \n26. \nmeasured  by  commercial  banks  reaching  at  least  14.4%  of  the  RBI  PSL  target  for  agriculture  by \n2025 and an increase in the volume of bank loans to women SHGs. \n\nThe expected outcome of the intervention is that ABL and YBL will have established scalable \n27. \nfinancing models for sustainable outreach to small farmers and women SHGs. This will be reflected \nby  growth  in  both  banks\u2019  small  farmer  and  women  SHG  portfolios  and  borrower  numbers,  while \nmaintaining adequate asset quality. The provision of financial services to small farmers and women \n\n \n\n \n\n\fSHGs and  their  integration  into formal  agribusiness  supply  chains  will  increase farmer  income  and \nemployment. \n\n28. \nThe  expected  outputs  of  the  investments  are  (i)  ABL  and  YBL  banking  services  to  small \nfarmers  and  women  SHGs  expanded,  (ii)  operating  and  risk  management  systems  improved,  (iii) \nwomen SHG financial literacy improved, and (iv) compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009) ensured. \n\n \nB. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n29. \nUnder the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, ADB aims to strengthen the financial sector by \npromoting inclusive growth.10 Inclusive finance will be supported by the focus on rural areas where \nproductivity is low and the potential for income generation is high. The assistance is also consistent \nwith  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2013\u20132017  for  India,11 which  highlights  the  importance of \ninclusive  growth  through  inclusive  financial  systems.  ADB  will  assist  both  banks  to  expand  their \nservices to small farmers and low-income women, which is consistent with the government\u2019s efforts \nas  emphasized  in  the  Mor  Report. 12  ADB\u2019s  nonsovereign  support  will  complement  earlier  and \nongoing  sovereign  efforts  in  capital  market  and  rural  credit  cooperative  restructuring,  as  well  as \nagribusiness infrastructure development.13 \n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n30. \nThe loans are classified as category FI for impacts on the environment and FI treated as C \nfor  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  No  subloans  classified  environment  category \nA may be financed under the loans. The potential environmental and social impacts of the loans and \nassociated  risks  have  been  assessed,  as  well  as  the  banks\u2019  commitment  and  capacity  for \nenvironmental  and  social  management.  ABL  and  YBL  will  apply  ADB\u2019s  prohibited  investment \nactivities  list,  ensure  that  investments  using  ADB  funds  abide  by  applicable  national  laws  and \nregulations, comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), and establish and maintain an \nESMS satisfactory to ADB before disbursement  of the loans.14 ABL\u2019s and YBL\u2019s ESMS will include \narrangements to comply with national labor laws and ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy.15 \n \n31. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  Through  its  YES  Livelihood \nEnhancement Action Program, YBL services 530,000 rural women, organized via SHGs across 16 \nstates,  including  eight  priority  states  identified  by  the  National  Bank  for  Agriculture  and  Rural \nDevelopment. YBL has 35 accredited business correspondents that source and service the SHGs. \nUnder YBL\u2019s current business strategy and ADB\u2019s assistance, YBL aims to increase the number of \nlow-income  women  in  rural  areas  that  it  services  to  3  million.  To  operationalize  that  goal,  YBL  is \nstrengthening its outreach to women SHGs via business correspondents, enhancing YBL field staff \npresence, and concentrating processing into dedicated regional hubs. \n \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2014.
