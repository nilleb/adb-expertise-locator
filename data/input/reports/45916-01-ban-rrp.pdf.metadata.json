The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  Industrial \nEnergy  Efficiency  Finance  Program  to  IIDFC,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan \nfacility, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n\nA. \n\nInvestment Identification and Description \n\n2. \nBangladesh suffers from a chronic shortage of energy. Gas, the main source of energy, \nis  insufficient  to  meet  demand.  Power  supply  is  29%  short  of  demand.1 Energy  shortages  are \nundermining the country\u2019s competitiveness, causing an estimated two percentage point loss in \ngross  domestic  product  growth  potential.  The  situation  is  not  expected  to  improve  soon  as \nproduction  from  existing  gas  fields  is  forecast  to  decline  from  2019.2 Securing  new  sources  of \nenergy (e.g., coal, liquefied natural gas) locally or abroad will take time because of the need for \npolicy decisions to bring energy tariffs up to full cost recovery at market levels. \n \n3. \nEnergy efficiency provides a cost-effective response to energy shortages. On the supply \nside,  existing  gas-fired  power  plants  can  be  made  more  efficient,  and  transmission  and \ndistribution  losses  can  be  reduced.  On  the  demand  side,  the  Government  of  Bangladesh  has \ninitiated efficiency  measures  in the commercial and residential  sectors.3 Industries should also \nbe a key focus for energy efficiency initiatives: directly and indirectly, industries consume about \n50% of Bangladesh\u2019s gas. They also consume oil and coal, so energy efficiency in industry can \nhelp reduce the country\u2019s carbon emissions.  \n \n4. \nThe  proposed  finance  program  will  promote  energy  efficiency  investments  in  industry \nthrough a loan facility to selected financial institutions. These financial institutions will onlend the \nproceeds to eligible energy efficiency projects in seven industries: brick making, textiles, steel, \ncement,  ceramics,  chemicals,  and  agri-industries.  These  industries  have  large  energy  saving \npotential and energy efficiency improvement technologies are readily identifiable (either retrofits \nof existing systems or new systems). A GTZ\u2013World Bank report4 showed that energy efficiency \nprojects in textiles, steel, and chemicals have the greatest carbon emission reduction potential \nper dollar invested by comparing 16 pilot studies across industries.5 \n \n5. \nIIDFC  will  be  the  first  participating  financial  institution  in  the  finance  program.  In \nSeptember 2010, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) organized a workshop on Improving the \nRegional Distribution of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Projects in Asia and the Pacific \nat  ADB\u2019s  headquarters.  The  workshop  aimed  at  increasing  the  number  of  CDM  projects  in \ncountries  currently  hosting  fewer  than  10  registered  CDM  projects.  IIDFC  was  invited  to \nparticipate  as  a  representative  from  Bangladesh.  In  December  2010,  IIDFC  requested  ADB\u2019s \nassistance for improving kiln efficiency in the brick-making industry in Bangladesh. \n\n                                                \n1  Bangladesh Power Development Board. 2010.

It  has  been  involved  in  promoting  hybrid  Hoffman  kiln  (HHK)  projects \nsince  2006.  HHKs  are  50%  more  energy  efficient  than  the  brick  kilns  traditionally  used  in \nBangladesh  (footnote  5).  In  2009,  the  company  signed  an  emission  reduction  purchase \nagreement  with  the World  Bank  and the  Government  of  Denmark  for  16  HHK  projects.  IIDFC \nacts  as  the  CDM  bundling  agent,  while  providing  debt  financing  to  some  projects.  It  has  also \nencouraged  other  financial  institutions  to  finance  HHK  projects,  and  established  a  dedicated \nenergy efficiency and carbon finance team in 2009. \n \n7. \nOther participating financial institutions are likely to include 1\u20133 private sector banks or \nnonbank  financial  institutions  (NBFIs)  in  Bangladesh.  Participating  financial  institutions  will  be \nselected  based  on  six  criteria:  (i)  satisfactory  integrity  due  diligence;  (ii)  compliance  with  all \nprudential ratios; (iii) credit strength  above industry average; (iv) operating policies, guidelines, \nand  systems  in  loan  origination,  credit  assessment,  loan  administration,  loan  collection,  and \nenforcement;  (v)  commitment  to  investing  in  energy  efficiency  and  adequate  staffing, \nmanagement, and technical capacity to implement the finance program; and (vi) commitment to \nmanaging environmental and social impacts associated with the finance program. \n \nB. \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\nIIDFC is a leading NBFI in Bangladesh.6 It was established in 2000 to boost investment \n8. \nin the industry and infrastructure sectors by providing long-term finance. As of December 2010, \nit had an asset base of $156.9 million and net worth of $14.4 million. IIDFC\u2019s local credit rating \nis  AA\u2013,  which  corresponds  to  institutions  having  very  strong  capacity  to  meet  their  financial \ncommitments and carrying very low credit risk in the local context.7 \n \n9. \nlease  finance, \nsyndication services,  securities trading  services,  and margin loans. Its  clients  mainly  comprise \nlarge  industrial  groups,  but  also  include  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  and  retail \ncustomers  (term  deposits,  brokerage  services).  Revenues  from  traditional  lending  and  leasing \nhave  displayed  solid  growth  (35%  per  year  on  average  during  2008\u20132010),  and  fee-based \nrevenues have grown even faster (248%). \n \nC. \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\nIIDFC  offers  selected  financial  services, \n\nincluding  term \n\nlending, \n\n1. \n\nOwnership \n\n10. \nIIDFC was founded by 14 Bangladesh financial institutions\u2014eight private sector banks, \nthree  private  sector  insurance  companies  and  three  state-owned  financial  institutions  (each \nholding  approximately  6.9%  of  equity)\u2014and  one  individual,  Matiul  Islam  (with  approximately \n3.0%).  The  14  financial  institution  shareholders  provide  IIDFC  with  banking  and  financial \nexpertise and a good network, as well as access to finance in case of unexpected needs. The \naverage  long-term  local  credit  rating  of  the  financial  institution  shareholders  is  between  A \n(strong) and AA (very strong). Six out of the eight private sector shareholder banks have already \nbeen accepted as participants in ADB\u2019s Trade Finance Program. \n \n\n                                                \n6 \n7  Two local rating agencies assigned an AA\u2013 rating to IIDFC: National Credit Ratings (NCR) in July 2011 and Credit \n\nIIDFC ranks among the top three Bangladesh NBFIs, measured by 2010 total revenues. \n\nRating Agency of Bangladesh (CRAB) in October 2009. \n\n\f3 \n\nIIDFC\u2019s  board  of  directors  consists  of  highly  qualified  individuals.  Matiul  Islam,  the \n11. \ncompany chair, is a former finance secretary of the Government of Bangladesh, and also served \nat  the  World  Bank  and  the  United  Nations.  He  founded  several  financial  institutions  before \nIIDFC,  including  the  AB  Bank,  now  one  of  the  leading  private  banks  in  Bangladesh.  All  other \nboard members are top executives of the institutions they represent. \n \n\n2. \n\nManagement \n\nIIDFC\u2019s  core  management  includes  managing  director  A.  Khan,  additional  managing \n12. \ndirector  K.  Rahman,  head  of  credit  R.  Islam,  and  chief  financial  officer  S.  Ahamed,  having  on \naverage  30  years  banking  experience.  All  bring  vast  experience  in  Bangladesh\u2019s  commercial \nbanking  sector.  A.  Khan  also  worked  at  Bangladesh  Bank  (central  bank  and  finance  sector \nregulator) where he gained experience in policy formulation and bank supervision.  \n \n\n3. \n\nGovernance Structure \n\nIIDFC  is  governed  by  its  board  of  directors.  The  management  team  is  responsible  for \n13. \nday-to-day  operations  but  needs  board  approval  for  all  important  decisions.  The  board  is \nsupported  by  seven  committees,  including  the  audit  committee,  the  credit  risk  management \ncommittee, the asset liability management committee, and the central compliance unit. \n \n14. \nIIDFC\u2019s risk management policies incorporate banking best practices. The principal risks \nof  proposed  transactions  are  summarized  through  a  scoring  system.  All  credit  proposals  are \nreviewed  by  an  independent  credit  risk  department  before  submission  to  the  credit  risk \nmanagement committee and, if required, to the board of directors. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\n15. \nADB\u2019s proposed assistance to the finance program will consist of two components: (i) a \n$30  million  loan  facility  to  be  disbursed  to  participating  financial  institutions  (IIDFC  and  other \nparticipating financial institutions to be selected) for them to onlend to eligible industrial energy \nefficiency  projects,  and  (ii)  a  $1.5  million  TA  to  identify  bankable  energy  efficiency  projects  in \ntarget industries other than brick making.8 \n \n16.  While ADB\u2019s loan facility is proposed to be limited to $30 million, the demand for energy \nefficiency  funding  arising  from  the  projects  identified  through  the  finance  program  may  be \nhigher.  Participating  financial  institutions  and  other  local  or  international  financial  institutions \nmay  provide  cofinancing  to  the  identified  projects.  Hence,  it  is  expected  that  the  finance \nprogram could result in up to $100 million of industrial energy efficiency investments (assuming \n$30 million in cofinancing and $40 million in equity contribution from the industrial sponsors). \n \nB. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTo  be  eligible  to  receive  a  loan  from  a  participating  financial  institution,  a  potential \n\n17. \nenergy efficiency project in a target industry will need to demonstrate the following: \n\n                                                \n8  The brick-making industry has not been included  in the TA scope as energy efficiency projects  using the proven \n\nHHK technology have already been implemented (four of them financed by IIDFC) and can be replicated. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\nAn  energy  audit  and  feasibility  study  have  been  prepared  by  an  internationally \nrecognized  expert,  validating  either  (a)  at  least  20%  energy  savings  per  unit \nproduced  with  the  new  technology  compared  to  the  old  technology,  or  (b)  an \ninvestment payback from savings on energy costs within 7 years. \nThe project\u2019s sponsor has a relevant industry track record, integrity, and financial \nstrength (existing profitable business and/or ability to provide the required equity \nand support to the project). \nAll  applicable  national  environmental  requirements  (including  permits  and \nemission/discharge standards) have been met, or will be met within a reasonable \ntime frame based on a corrective action plan. \nThe debt\u2013equity ratio after financing is 3:1 at most. \nThe  loan  is  within  the  financial  institution\u2019s  single  obligor  and  single  sector \nexposure limits. \n\n \n18. \nThe  finance  program  will  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  Where  ADB  provides  funds  to  an  intermediary  institution  to  be \nonlent to borrowers for the partial financing of subprojects, procurement is generally undertaken \nby  the  respective  borrowers  \u2015in  accordance  with  established  private  sector  or  commercial \npractices,  which  are  acceptable  to  ADB\u2016  (ADB  Procurement  Guidelines,  clause  3.12).  In \naddition,  the  ADB  loan  documentation  will  require  goods  to  be  procured  from  ADB  member \ncountries. \n \n19. \nLoan documentation will also include covenants requiring IIDFC and other participating \nfinancial institutions to provide financial reports and annual monitoring reports about their loans \nto eligible projects. \n \nC. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nADB\u2019s financing is long-tenor, which is not readily available in Bangladesh given liquidity \n20. \nconstraints  in  the  banking  sector.  The  finance  program  will  help  catalyze  further  private \ninvestment. Through the TA, ADB will assist industries in identifying commercially viable energy \nefficiency projects. ADB will also help participating financial institutions to establish or improve \nESMS,  promoting  adoption  of  safeguards  best  practices  in  Bangladesh.  Finally,  ADB\u2019s \nassistance  could  catalyze  cofinancing from  international  commercial  banks,  other  international \nfinance institutions, or donor countries. \n \nD. \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\n21. \nNonsovereign TA of $1.5 million for the Industrial Energy Efficiency Finance Program is \nproposed to be provided as a reimbursable advance to IIDFC from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nSpecial  Fund  (TASF-IV).  The  advance  will  be  used  to  identify  bankable  energy  efficiency \nprojects  in  target  industries  other  than  brick  making.  A  consulting  firm  that  includes  both \ninternational and local engineers will be hired according to ADB\u2019s guidelines. The firm will help \nidentify  potential  projects  within  the  client  portfolios  of  participating  financial  institutions.  It  will \nthen  prepare  energy  audits  and  feasibility  studies  for  these  projects.  The  TA  funds  will  be \nreimbursable to ADB  if and to the  extent that the  projects  identified  receive  financing from the \nparticipating financial  institutions  using  ADB financing. The  consultant  will  organize  workshops \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nfor  the  participating  financial  institutions  to  ensure  their  staff  understand  the  results  of  the \nstudies and know how to translate the studies into bankable projects.9 \n \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nA. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nImpact \n\n22. \nThe finance program is expected to have the following development impacts: (i) energy \nsavings  contributing  to  reducing  Bangladesh\u2019s  energy  supply\u2013demand  gap  and  mitigating \nclimate  change,  (ii)  demonstrating  that  industrial  energy  efficiency  solutions  are  commercially \nviable, and (iii) developing local energy efficiency expertise within the finance sector and among \ntechnical consultants and energy efficiency solution providers. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n23. \nThe  finance  program\u2019s  expected  outcome  will  be  greater  efficiency  in  the  financed \nindustrial  projects,  resulting  in  energy  savings  and  carbon  emission  reduction.  Industries  are \nexpected  to  reduce  their  gas,  coal,  and  power  consumption  by  at  least  20%  per  unit  of \nproduction, contributing to energy savings equivalent to at least 350 gigawatt-hours per year by \n2015  and  to  a  reduction  in carbon  emissions  of at  least  150,000  tons  per  year  by  2015.  More \nefficient  industrial  processes  can  also  reduce  air  pollution  and  improve  labor  conditions, \nparticularly in the brick-making industry.10 \n \n\n3. \n\nOutputs \n\n24. \nThe  finance  program\u2019s  outputs  will  be  (i)  the  completion  of  industrial  energy  efficiency \nprojects expected to represent an aggregate investment of at least $50 million (and up to $100 \nmillion) by 2014, and (ii) the implementation of an ESMS by all participating financial institutions. \n \nB. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\nThe  promotion  of  energy  efficiency  is  a  key  objective  under  ADB's  Strategy  2020. 11 \n25. \nEnergy  efficiency  is  mentioned  under  both  the  infrastructure  (energy)  and  the  environment \n(climate  change)  core  areas  of  operations.  Strategy  2020  estimated  the  annual  investment \nneeds  for  energy  efficiency  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  at  $14  billion  over  the  2009\u20132018  period. \nEnergy efficiency is also an objective of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Bangladesh.12 \n \n\n                                                \n9  Technical Assistance: Industrial Energy Efficiency Finance Program (accessible from the list of linked documents \nin  Appendix  2)  includes  details  on  the  TA\u2019s  objectives,  activities,  budget,  implementation  arrangements,  and  the \nconsulting firm\u2019s terms of reference. \n\n10  IIDFC. 2010.

Manila. \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n\n26. \nThe finance program is aligned with energy and finance sector strategies. According to \nADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy,  \u2015harnessing  energy  efficiency  is  one  of  the  most  effective  ways  to  meet \nenergy  demand,  while  addressing  global  warming.\u201613 In  particular,  the  Energy  Policy  calls  for \nADB  to  expand  its  energy  efficiency  operations  \u2015in  the  industry  sector  by  collaborating  with \nindustry  associations,  domestic  banks,  and  specialized  energy  efficiency agencies  and energy \nservice companies.\u2016 As such, climate change finance has been elevated as a new area of focus \nin ADB\u2019s private sector operations since 2010.14 Moreover, ADB\u2019s Financial Sector Operational \nPlan recommends that financial intermediation (credit line) operations should be combined with \neffective TA to the financial intermediaries.15  \n \nThe  finance  program  is  consistent  with  other  ADB  operations  in  Bangladesh.  The \n27. \npromotion  of  demand-side  energy  efficiency  in  the  industry  sector  will  complement  ADB\u2019s \nsupply-side assistance to improve efficiency in the power sector.16 Sovereign assistance to the \nbrick-making  industry  is also  being  considered  and  will  complement  and create  synergies  with \nthe  finance  program.  The  proposed  sovereign  assistance  will  address  the  issue  of  immediate \nemission reduction and the longer-term modernization of the sector. It will include a $50 million \nloan facility and $3 million of TA.17 The loan facility would offer funds at rates that are conducive \nto  promote  development  of  the  brick-making  industry.  The  TA  will  provide  policy  support  to \nensure enforcement of the ban on inefficient brick kilns and will contribute to creating awareness \nof efficient brick kiln technologies, including HHK, which will thus benefit the finance program.18 \n \n28. \nThe  finance  program  can  also  benefit  from  policy  and  tariff  reforms  that  other \ndevelopment  agencies  are  promoting.  German  development  cooperation  through  GIZ 19 has \nbeen  providing  policy  support  to  prepare  a  draft  Energy  Conservation  Act,  which  in  particular \nwould  mandate  the  replacement  of  highly  inefficient  technologies. 20  To  reduce  the  budget \ndeficit,  the  International  Monetary  Fund  is  considering  including  an  increase  in  energy  prices \nthrough lower subsidies as one of the conditions to a $1 billion sovereign loan currently under \ndiscussion.21 Although  these  reforms  may  take  time  to  materialize,  they  would  provide  further \nimpetus to the adoption of energy efficiency solutions across sectors. \n \n\n                                                \n13  ADB. 2009.

A recent draft evaluation knowledge brief concludes that energy \nefficiency  in  industry  and  buildings  should  be  promoted  through  commercial  financing,  and  in \nparticular through lines of credit dedicated to financing projects that qualify as energy efficiency \ninvestments.22 Lines of credit should be combined with TA to support the origination of energy \nefficiency  projects  and  to  help  financial  intermediaries  understand  the  bankability  of  these \nprojects.  ADB\u2019s  recent  nonsovereign  assistance  to  Indonesia  Eximbank  included  capacity \nbuilding  TA:  this  finance  program\u2019s  design  greatly  benefited  from  the  precedent.23 The  draft \nevaluation  knowledge  brief  also  highlights  the  importance  of  identifying  \u2015local  financial \nintermediaries  that  are  interested  in  energy  efficiency  lending\u2016  and  of  letting  the  financial \nintermediary \u2015identify, appraise, and approve a subloan itself, without further approvals from any \ngovernment  body  or  a  development  partner\u2016  (footnote  22).  Finally,  energy  efficiency \ninterventions  need  not  be  big  and  broad  to  start  with;  at  times  it  is  best  to  start  with  small, \nnarrowly focused programs and to increase the scope and sophistication over time. \n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nEnvironment and Social Safeguards \n\n30. \nThe  finance  program  is  classified  category  FI  for  impacts  on  the  environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. The finance program's potential environment \nand social impacts, the risks associated with IIDFC\u2019s existing and/or likely future portfolio, and \nIIDFC\u2019s  commitment  to  and  capacity  for  environmental  management  have  been  assessed. \nSimilar due diligence will be conducted on other participating financial institutions. IIDFC and the \nother  participating  financial  institutions  will  apply  ADB\u2019s  prohibited  activities  list,  ensure  that \ninvestments  using  ADB  funds  abide  by  applicable  national  laws  and  regulations,  comply  with \nADB Safeguards and Policy Statement (2009), and establish and maintain appropriate ESMSs, \neach  satisfactory  to  ADB,  before  disbursement  for  the  financing  of  investments.  An  ESMS \nframework has been prepared to guide participating financial institutions in developing an ESMS \nto address impacts and risks.24 The participating institutions\u2019 ESMS will include arrangements to \ncomply with national labor laws and ADB Social Protection Strategy (2001) to ensure adherence \nto  core  labor  standards.  As  industries  become  more  efficient,  they  will  also  become  more \ncompetitive  and  create  jobs.  The  finance  program  will  have  some  gender  benefits  as  women \nrepresent  the  great  majority  of  workers  in  light  industries  such  as  textiles  and  garments,  agri-\nbusiness, and brick making. \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nIIDFC and the potential other participating financial institutions short-listed were advised \n31. \nof ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy and its policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto the combating of money laundering and the financing of terrorism.25 ADB will ensure that the \n\n                                                \n22  ADB. 2011.
