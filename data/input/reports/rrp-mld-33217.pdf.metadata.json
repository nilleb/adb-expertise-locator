The  Project  will  provide \nemployment-oriented  skills  training  in  various  occupations  to \nmake  the  prospective  Maldivian  employee  more  attractive  to  the \nto  deliver \nemployer. \ncompetency-based  skills  training  will  be  strengthened.  Together \nwith  the  provision  of  employment-oriented  skills  training,  career \nguidance in schools and social marketing will contribute to making \ntraining  and  employment  more  attractive  to  the  prospective \nMaldivian employee.   \n \nTraining  in  the  Project  will  be  delivered  in  three  geographic \nregions,  namely,  Mal\u00e9  island  and  adjacent  atolls,  the  Northern \nDevelopment  Region,  and  the  Southern  Development  Region. \nThe  Project  will  focus  on  delivering  training  in  four  sectors: \ntourism,  fisheries  and  agriculture,  transport,  and  the  social \nsectors. \n \nNational economic development requires the efficient employment \nof  all  national  resources, \nincluding  human  resources.  The \nemployment of more Maldivians means that they would be able to \nshare in the benefits of and participate in economic development, \nand is a sustainable approach to poverty reduction. Between 1995 \nand  2000,  the  Maldives\u2019  economy  grew  at  an  annual  average  of \n8%.  During  this  time  the  Maldivian  labor  force  grew  by  5% \nannually  while  expatriate  labor  grew  8%.  The  Maldives  is  highly \ndependent  on  skilled  expatriate  labor.  Employers,  including  the \nGovernment,  hire  expatriate  workers  in  the  absence  of  properly \ntrained  and  qualified  Maldivians.  This  is  against  the  backdrop  of \nuntapped  domestic  human  resources,  which  include  the  large \nnumber  of  youths  who  are  not  in  the  labor  force,  who  have \ncompleted primary education but could not continue on to further \neducation, and who are capable but have limited access to skills \ntraining programs. \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\fiv \n\n \nObjective \n\n \n\ntraining;  (ii) increase  capacity \n\n \nThe  overall  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  increase  the  number  of \nMaldivians,  men  and  women,  actively  participating  in  the  labor \nforce  and  employed.  The  Project  will  (i) provide  youths  with \nto \nemployment-oriented  skills \ndesign, develop, and  deliver  employment-oriented skills training; \n(iii) improve  public  perception  of  training  and  employment  in \nlocally  available  skills-oriented  occupations;  and  (iv) strengthen \nlabor  administration  and  labor  market  analysis.  The  Project  aims \nto train about 6,000 youths, at least 40% of whom will be female.  \n \nThe  Project  will  have  three  components:  (i) increasing access to \n(ii) social \ngood  quality  employment-oriented  skills \nmarketing,  and  improving  career  guidance  and  awareness  of \nemployment  opportunities;  and  (iii) capacity  strengthening  of  the \nMinistry of Human Resources, Employment and Labor (MHREL).  \n \nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $7.5 million equivalent, \nincluding  physical  contingency  and  price  escalation,  taxes  and \nduties,  and  interest  charges,  of  which  $2.1 million  equivalent \n(28%)  comprises  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $5.4 million \nequivalent  (72%)  comprises  the  local  currency  cost.  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  will  finance  80%  of  the  project  cost. \nThis covers  100%  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  72%  of  the \nlocal  currency  cost.  The  Government  will  provide  $1.5 million \nequivalent (20%).  \n \n\ntraining; \n\nSource \n \n\nADB \nGovernment \nTotal \n% \n\nForeign \nExchange \n2.1 \n0.0 \n2.1 \n28 \n\n($ million) \nLocal \nCurrency \n3.9 \n1.5 \n5.4 \n72 \n\nTotal \nCost \n6.0 \n1.5 \n7.5 \n100 \n\n% \n \n80 \n20 \n100 \n \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  SDR  4,196,000 \n($6 million) equivalent from its Special Funds resources. The loan \nwill have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, \nwith an interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period \nand 1.5% per annum thereafter.  \n \nUntil 31 March 2009  \n \n30 September 2008 \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nThe  project  implementing  agency  will  be  MHREL.  A  project \nsteering committee will be established to facilitate policy dialogue, \nadvise  the  project  manager  of  concerns  and  issues  related  to  all \naspects  of  project  implementation,  and  facilitate  coordination \nbetween  ministries  and  agencies.  A  project  implementation  unit \nwill  be  established.  Working  groups  will  be  organized \nto \ncoordinate  and  guide  the  implementation  of  project  components \nand activities. \n \nMinistry of Finance and Treasury \n \nThe procurement of goods and services financed by ADB will be \nundertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement \nreflecting ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy and mandatory use of ADB\u2019s \nstandard bidding documents. \n \nThe  selection  and  engagement  of  all  consulting  services  to  be \nfinanced  under  the  Project  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for  the engagement of domestic consultants. \nA team of consultants to provide services in a range of specialties \nwith  estimated  international  inputs  of  28  person-months  and \ndomestic  inputs  of  50  person-months will be engaged through a \nfirm  using  the  quality  and  cost-based  selection  method.  Another \n4 person-months  of  international  inputs  for  services  in  labor \nadministration will be provided by an individual consultant. In case \nthe  expertise \nlocally  available, \ninputs \ninternational consultants will be used. \n \nThe  main  project  benefits  are:  (i) more  youths  provided  with \nemployment-oriented  skills  training;  (ii) more  skilled  Maldivians  in \nthe  labor  force  sharing  in  the  benefits  of  economic  development; \n(iii) increased  capacity  in  country  to  design,  develop,  and  deliver \ndemand-oriented \nlabor \ntraining; \nadministration  and  labor  market  analysis  at  MHREL.  The  direct \nbeneficiaries  of  the  Project  will  be:  (i) unemployed  youths, \nincluding  women;  (ii) island  communities;  (iii) various  ministries \nand  agencies  addressing  the  issues  of  the  youths,  human \nresources  development,  and  training  delivery;  and  (iv) public and \nprivate training providers. \n \nBenefits  to  the  country  will  accrue  through  human  development \nthat  is  necessary  for  economic  growth.  The  provision  of  skilled \nlabor  will  also  contribute  to  meeting  the  macroeconomic  goals  of \nthe  country,  notably  addressing  the  balance  of  payments  and \nretention of foreign exchange. \n \n\n(iv) strengthened \n\nfor  domestic \n\nis  not \n\nskills \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n \n\n\fRisks and Assumptions \n\nThe Project assumes mainly that the economy of the Maldives will \ncontinue to grow and create new jobs.

The proposed Project aims to mitigate these \nrisks  by:  (i) developing  and  delivering  training  that  is  oriented \ntoward the needs of the labor market; (ii) building the capacity of \nMHREL for more effective monitoring and implementation of labor \nregulations  and  labor  market  analysis;  (iii) implementing a social \nmarketing program aimed not only at students but also at parents \nand  communities  and  delivering  a  career  guidance  program  in \nsecondary  schools;  (iv) having  a  wide  representation  on  the \nproject steering committee, in employment sector councils, as well \nas  coordination  efforts \nfor \nEmployment  Training  and  the  project  implementation  unit;  and \n(v) actively  encouraging  dialogue  with  and  participation  of  the \nprivate sector in project implementation. \n \n\nthe  Maldives  Network \n\nthrough \n\n \n\n \n \n\nvi \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \n\n1. \nto the Republic of the Maldives for the Employment Skills Training Project (ESTP).1 \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nThe Republic of the Maldives is a nation of over 270,000 people living on 199 islands in \n2. \nan  archipelago  820  kilometers  long  and  120  kilometers  wide.  As  of  2002,  almost  half  of  the \npopulation (46%) was less than 15 years old. Twenty-seven percent of the population live in the \nnational capital island of Mal\u00e9 while the rest live on 198 inhabited islands. In addition there are \n87  tourist  resort  islands  that  are  annually  the  home  of  6,500  Maldivians,  3,400  expatriate \nworkers, and over 450,000 foreign tourists. The Government is committed to sustainable human \ndevelopment, which is reflected in its allocation of 40% of public expenditures to social services \nin  2001.  The  human  development  index  for  the  Maldives  is  0.739,  ranking  it  77th  out  of  162 \ncountries,  and  the  gender  development  index,  at  0.735,  is  second  only  to  that  of  Sri  Lanka  in \nSouth Asia.2  \n \nHigh and rising per capita income3 masks significant income disparities. According to the \n3. \n1998  Vulnerability  and  Poverty  Assessment,4  as many as 42% of Maldivians live on less than \n$1.17  per  day  while  22%  subsist  on  $0.83  per  day.  Income  disparities  between  Mal\u00e9  and  the \natolls are in the order of 2:1. Inequalities are more pronounced in access to social and physical \ninfrastructure  and  services,  which  averaged  4:1.  This  is  a  challenge  that  the  Government  has \nsought  to  address  since  the  1970s,  which  today  has  resulted  in  policy  initiatives  to  develop \ngrowth  center  islands  in  five  regions  to  reduce  disparities  in  access to essential services. The \nGovernment,  with  assistance  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  is  developing  the \nNorthern and Southern Development regions. \n \n4. \nIn  2002,  the  three  largest  sectors  of  the  economy  were  tourism  (31%), transport and \ncommunications  (14%),  and  government  administration  (12%).  Fisheries  used  to  account  for \naround 7.8% of gross domestic product (GDP), but its share has declined to 7.1%; the related \nsecondary  sector  activity,  fish  preparation,  accounts  for about 3.0% of GDP. The share of the \nsocial sectors\u2014education, health, and social services\u2014is slowly shrinking: from 2.6% in 1995, it \nwas  2.0%  in  2002.  Commodity  exports  in  2002  were  mostly  marine  products  (62%). \nDependence on tourism, primary exports, and expatriate workers, contributes to the economy\u2019s \nhigh vulnerability to external shocks.  \n \n5. \nLabor  Force.  According  to  the  2000  Population  and  Housing  Census  (Census),  only \n56% of working-age Maldivians were in the labor force,5 with about a third of them employed in \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001.

Human Development Report 2001.  \n  Available: http://www.undp.org/hdr2001/indicator/cty_f_MDV.html. \n3  Per capita gross national product (GNP) was $1,460 in 2001. \n4  United Nations Development Programme. The Maldives Vulnerability and Poverty Assessment 1998.  \n  Available: http://www.mv.undp.org/docs/VPA1998. \n5  The 2000 Population and Housing Census took 12 as the eligible age for employment. As of May 2003, the legal \nage for working and labor regulation was raised to 18. Throughout this report, we use 15 to 64 as reference ages \nfor the labor force. The reference period used for employment in the 2000 Census was \u201clast week,\u201d which may lead \nto the understatement of unemployment and labor force participation. \n\n \n\n\f2\n\n \n\n \n\nMal\u00e9.6 The official unemployment rate is 1% for the entire population. Men are almost twice as \nlikely to be in the labor force as women, 73% against 38%. Youths7 aged 15 to 19 are the least \nlikely to be in the  labor force, 24% of the cohort, while 64% of those aged 20 to 34 participate. \nThe  largest  employer  of  Maldivians  is  the  Government  and  government  companies,  mainly  in \ncommunity,  social,  and  personal  services;  manufacturing;  hotels  and  restaurants;  and  fishing. \nIsland women are mostly in community, social, and personal services, and manufacturing. Few \nwomen  are  employed  in  fishing,  or  in  hotels  and  restaurants.  The  Maldivian  labor  force  is \nsignificantly augmented by expatriate workers. The share of expatriate workers in the total labor \nforce increased from 13% in 1990 (8,700 workers) to 24% in 2000 (30,664 workers). According \nto the 2000 Census, expatriates are mostly employed in unskilled (42%) and semiskilled (36%) \noccupations.  More  than  80%  are  employed  in  resorts,  construction,  business  activities, \neducation,  apparel,  and  hotels  and  restaurants.  Most  of  the  expatriate  workers  are  from \nBangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka. Expatriate remuneration packages include accommodations \nand once-a-year airfare to the home country. Even with extra benefits and expenses incurred by \nemployers, expatriate workers in some categories receive about 80% to 85% of the Maldivians\u2019 \nsalary and benefits. The employment of large numbers of expatriate workers, in spite of the high \nlevels  of  unemployment  and  underemployment,  implies  a  significant  wastage  of  the  Maldives\u2019 \nhuman resources potential. A key reason for this anomaly is the dearth of adequately educated \nand trained Maldivians to meet the needs of employers and the reluctance of some Maldivians \nto engage in less skilled occupations. The ESTP addresses this issue and seeks to increase the \nnumber  of  Maldivians  in  the  labor  force  by  increasing  access  to  employment  oriented  skills \ntraining programs (see Appendix 1). \n \n6. \nEducation.  In  the  Maldives,  public  education  is  tuition-free  for  primary  grades  1  to  7, \nlower secondary grades 8 to 10, and higher secondary grades 11 to 12. Appendix 2 discusses \nthe education and skills training sectors. As of 2000, all children in the Maldives have access to \nthe first 7 years of formal schooling, one of the landmark achievements of the country. The adult \nliteracy rate is 99%.  The cost of providing education in the Maldives remains high as students \nare scattered over 199  islands. However, high priority is placed on investing in education such \nthat  the  education  budget  represents  20%  of  the  total  government  budgetary  expenditure.  In \n2002, there were 68,242 students enrolled in the primary grades, 23,903 in the lower secondary \ngrades, and 1,131 in the higher secondary grades. In 2000, there were 452 primary schools, 74 \nlower secondary schools, and 2 higher secondary schools. Efforts are under way to improve the \nquality of primary education by providing teacher training.   \n \n7. \nSecondary  Education.  For  2002,  enrollment  data  for  grade  8  indicate  that  5,350 \nstudents  or  36%  of  those  enrolled  in  grade  7  the  previous  year  in  primary  schools  did  not \ncontinue  on  to  secondary  schooling.  The  transition  rate  is  particularly  low  in  the  atolls. \nAdmission  to  secondary  school  requires  successful  completion  of  grade  7;  however,  limited \ncapacity  in  public  secondary  schools  has  necessitated  the  introduction  of  selection  processes \nfor  admission.  Despite  ongoing  efforts  to  increase  access  to  secondary  education,  geographic \nconditions still limit access to secondary education as the majority of schools are located in atoll \ncapitals and on larger islands of high population. At the end of grade 10, students typically take \nOrdinary-level  (O-level)  examinations.  The  pass  rate  in  most  subjects,  including  English, \nmathematics, and the sciences, is below 50%.8 Among those with O-level qualifications, few are \nable to go to higher secondary school. As of 2002, there were only four schools offering higher \nsecondary  education,  two  in  Mal\u00e9  and  one  each  in  the  Northern and Southern Development \n\n                                                 \n6  The labor force data are collected by the Census, the most recent of which was in 2000. \n7  The project uses the Government of Maldives' classification of 16 to 34 year olds as \"youths.\" \n8  The pass rate for English in 2002 was 6%. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n3\n\nregions.  Higher  secondary  grade  11  enrollment  was  13%  of  those  enrolled  in  grade  10  the \nprevious year.  \n \n8. \nSkills  Training.  Access  to  preemployment  skills  training  through  public  and  private \nproviders is limited. Skills training in the Maldives is provided mainly by the Maldives College of \nHigher  Education  (MCHE)  through  its  various  faculties,  including  the  Faculty  of  Engineering \nTechnology  (FET),  Faculty  of  Hospitality  and  Tourism  Studies  (FHTS),  and  the  Center  for \nMaritime  Studies  (CMS).  In  2002,  CMS  dominated  MCHE  short-course  enrollment  with  2,103 \nstudents, or 82.1% of all MCHE short-course skills training. Maritime training is male-dominated, \nwith  no  female  trainees  enrolled.  Enrollment  in  entry-level  employment  skills  training  through \nshort-courses offered by MCHE faculties other than CMS progressively declined from 2,839 in \n1998 to 818 in 2002. Trainees enrolled in short-term training pay fees that may cover learning \nmaterials  and  training  delivery  costs.  In  recent  months,  MCHE  has  received  an  increasing \nnumber of requests from atoll chiefs for short-term skills training that could be provided by FHTS \nand FET;  however,  many  of  these  requests  cannot  be  met  within  their  respective  budgets. \nMCHE  is  presently  receiving  ADB  assistance  focused  on  developing  diploma  and  advanced \ncertificate courses through faculty development and course reviews, and program accreditation.  \n \n9. \nThe  Ministry  of  Education  (MOE)  coordinates  and  implements  nonformal  education \nprograms  in  the  Maldives.  Through  the  Center  for  Continuing  Education,  MOE  provides  basic \neducation  for  adults.  Formerly  known  as  the  Non-Formal  Education  Center,  the  Center  for \nContinuing Education provides courses for adults to complete primary school, improve English \nlanguage courses, and offered some courses such as secretarial skills development, training in \nearly  childhood  care  and  development, population education, and community awareness. The \nMinistry  of  Fisheries,  Agriculture  and  Marine  Resources  conducts  agriculture-  and  fisheries-\nrelated  skills  training.  The  Ministry  of  Youth  and  Sports  (MYS)  offers  a  variety  of  training \nactivities for youths. In addition to offering sports and recreational programs in its youth centers, \nMYS  provides  training  in  sports-coaching,  dressmaking,  and  hairdressing.  The  Ministry  of \nHuman  Resources,  Employment  and  Labor  (MHREL)  has  initiated  a  skills  development loan \nscheme to fund specialized training, such as Scuba dive master instruction. \n \nIn  2002,  66  private  training  providers  were  registered  with  MOE.9  Eighty-five  percent \n10. \noffer computer instruction and approximately half are located in Mal\u00e9. Accurate enrollment data \non  trainees  are  not  available.  In  addition  to  private  education  and  training  firms,  many \nemployers  provide  in-house  training  programs  and  courses  for  their  employees.  Larger  firms \nprovide  scholarships  and  support  the  education  and  professional  development  of  employees. \nThe contribution of private enterprise to skills training is significant; however, no qualitative and \nquantitative  data  are  available  on  the  number  of  trainees  or  financial  investment  in  on-the-job \ntraining and professional development.  \n \nIn  October  2001,  the  Maldives  Accreditation  Board  (MAB)  was  formed  as  the \n11. \nadministrative  service  of  MOE  to  oversee  the  implementation  of  the  Maldives  National \nQualifications  Framework.  The  present  focus  of  the  MAB  is  dominated  by  academic \nqualifications. No framework exists for occupational standards, or for accreditation and delivery \nof vocational skills training. \n \n12. \nLabor  Regulation. MHREL\u2019s  mandate includes (i) the formulation of a national human \nresources  development  (HRD)  policy;  (ii) the  development  of  strategies  and  programs  for \ntraining individuals in vocational and management fields; (iii) the creation and administration of a \n\n                                                 \n9  In  Mal\u00e9,  there  are  27  software  application  training  providers.  Outside  Mal\u00e9,  there  are  29  com puter  training \n\nproviders. Ten private providers focus on language and other training services. \n\n \n\n\f4\n\n \n\n \n\nframework  for  resolving  conflicts  between  employers  and  employees  and  protecting  their \nrespective  rights;  and  (iv) the  issuance  of  permits  for  expatriates  to  work  in  the  Maldives  and \nenforcement  of  regulations  on  terms  and  conditions  of  employment.10  The  Maldives\u2019  labor \nlegislation  is  embodied  in  the  Employment  Regulation  1994.  Employment  contracts  are \nmandatory for locally engaged workers and expatriate employees. There is no minimum wage \nnor a wage structure. The salaries and benefits and other working conditions, including working \nhours, are determined by negotiations between employer and employee, without any minimum \nstandards  set  and  monitored  by  the  Government.  The  Maldives  is  not  a  member  of  the \nInternational Labour Organization (ILO), but not being a member does not prevent the country \nILO  conventions  and  recommendations.  Better  articulated  and  more \nfrom  adopting \ncomprehensive labor legislation, the draft Employment Act, prepared with technical assistance \nfrom the ILO, was submitted by MHREL to the Law Commission and now needs to be submitted \nto the Cabinet for their recommendation to submit it to Parliament. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities  \n\n13. \nNational  economic  development  requires  the  efficient  employment  of  all  available \nresources,  including  human  resources.  The  Maldives\u2019  failure  to  adequately  utilize  its  human \nresources potential is a key constraint to development. Increasing the employment of Maldivians \nwould  promote  more  equitable  sharing  of  the  benefits  of  economic  development,  and  is  a \nsustainable  approach  to  poverty  reduction.  While  the  Maldives\u2019  economy  grew  at  annual \naverage of about 8%11 between 1995 and 2000,12 the labor force expanded by only 5%. During \nthe  same  period,  expatriate  labor  grew  at  an  annual  average  of  8%.  The  Maldives  is  highly \ndependent  on  skilled  expatriate  labor.  Employers,  including  the  Government,  hire  expatriate \nworkers  in  the  absence  of  properly  trained  and  qualified  Maldivians.  This  is  against  the \nbackdrop  of  untapped  human  resources,  which  include  a  large  number  of  youths  who  are \noutside the labor force. An increasing number of youths have completed primary education but \ncould not continue on to further education. These young men and women are capable but have \nlimited  access  to  skills  training  programs.  In  2000,  there  were  25,461  youths  aged  15  to  19 \n(77% of the cohort) who were not in the labor force. To make better use of its human resources \npotential, the Maldives must (i) make the prospective Maldivian employee more attractive to the \nemployer, and (ii) make training and employment more attractive to the Maldivian employee.    \n \n \n14. \nProspective employees will be more attractive to employers if they are better trained and \nqualified  in  needed  occupational  areas.  For  training  to  be  more  attractive  to  Maldivian  youths, \naccess to high-quality skills training programs must be increased, the training programs offered \nmust  offer  a  high  likelihood  of  employment,  and  the  training  offered  should  be  in  occupations \nattractive  to  the  trainee.  Employment  will  be  more  attractive  when  work  conditions,  including \nwork  hours,  leave,  and  accommodation,  are  appropriate.  Employment  regulations  have  to  be \neffectively monitored to ensure that employees\u2019 and employers\u2019 rights are not transgressed. The \nkey issues thus relate to the availability of skills training opportunities, demand for skills training, \nquality and relevance of skills training, and the work environment.   \n \n15. \nAccess to Skills Training. While access to and quality of academic education continue \nto  improve,  more  attention  has  to  be  focused  on  the  needs  of  the  large  number  of  youths  for \nwhom  further  academic  education  will  not  be  possible.  Students  who  leave  school  after \ncompleting grade 7 or who discontinue secondary studies without passing O-levels face limited \nnonacademic or employment skills training opportunities. Current requests by atoll chiefs cannot \n                                                 \n10 Ministry of Human Resources and Labour. 1998. \n  Available: http://www.humanresources.gov.mv/MHREL/Ministry/Ministry.asp. \n11 Between 1995 and 2002, the average annual growth rate was 7%. \n12 Where labor force data comparisons are made, the reference date is 2000. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n5\n\nall be presently met; most of the trainees in short-term courses are enrolled in Mal\u00e9. The range of \nskills  training  also  needs  to  be  expanded  to  offer  more  opportunities  to  women  and  island-\nresidents. Scheduling of training should be flexible, and programs should be regularly offered in \nvarious regions, atolls, and islands.  \n \nDemand for Skills Training and Employment. An increased birthrate in the late 1980s \n16. \nand early 1990s resulted in a population increase of youths now in their mid- to late teens. This \ncohort  of  15-  to  19-year-old  youths  has  completed  primary  school,  is  progressing  through \nsecondary  school,  and  will  soon  be  seeking  access  to  further  education  or  employment.  By \n2006,  the  number  of  Maldivian  youths  of  this  age  will  be  about  41,100.  This  is  double  the \nnumber  of  youths  in  the  same  age  cohort  10 years ago.  In  2001  and  2002,  10,304  students \nwere unable to continue from grade 7 to 8, and 8,124 students from grade 10 to 11.  \n \nAttitudes  toward  employment  are  starting  to  change.  Students  and  parents  are \n17. \nincreasingly  seeking  training  and  employment  opportunities  for  youths  no  longer  in  school. \nApplications  for  advertised  positions  are  increasing.  Atoll  chiefs  are  requesting  skills  training. \nAmong  community  leaders  and  parents,  there  is  growing  awareness  and  concern  to  find  a \nsolution  to  youth  unemployment.  Enforced  youth  idleness  may  at  times  be  linked  to  social  ills \nsuch as drug abuse and involvement in nonproductive activities. Prevailing social attitudes and \nparental  concern  for  the  welfare  of  girls  hinder  female  participation  in  employment  away  from \ntheir home island. However, attitudes relating to the employment of women in resorts appear to \nbe  changing;  more  women  are  being  employed,  mainly  in  clerical  positions.  Attitudes  and  the \nexpectations  of  many  students  and  parents  are  that  higher  education  will  lead  to  white-collar \njobs,  especially  in  government.  A  reorientation  of  attitudes  to  nongovernment  jobs  and \nalternative  employment  opportunities  is  required.  During  focus  group  discussions,  youths \nindicated that they are interested in various occupations and employment. \n \n18. \nEnsuring the Quality and Relevance of Skills Training.  Skills training must address \nthe  needs  of  the  labor  market  and  should  also  be  acceptable  to  students  and  their parents. \nSkills  training  augments  the  knowledge  and  competencies  acquired  through  formal  education. \nDuring  project  preparation,  some  employers  expressed  the  view  that  secondary  and \npostsecondary  student-graduates  are  not  properly  trained  for  positions  they  accept  after \ngraduation.  There  is  a  need  to  increase  entry-level  employment  skills  through  short-term \ncourses. Skills training courses should be reviewed and revised to ensure relevance to various \nindustries\u2019  needs  and  actual  occupational  requirements.  Competency-based  skills  training \n(CBST)  programs  developed  and  implemented  in  coordination  with  employers  and  relevant \noccupational employees will ensure that appropriate skills are acquired by trainees. These are \nalso  designed  to  focus  on  the  outcome  of  the  training  with  reference  to  observable  and \nmeasurable  evidence.  While  the  establishment  of  MAB  and  the  introduction  of  the  Maldives \nNational Qualifications Framework provide the initial structure for the accreditation of education \nfor  vocational  qualification  and  occupational \nprograms,  a  corresponding  mechanism \nperformance standards should be developed.  \n \n19.  Work Environment. For the limited issues where the present regulations provide for the \nsafeguard  of  employees  and  employers,  interviews  conducted  during  project  preparation \nindicated  that  more  effective  monitoring  is  needed.  There  is  indeed  a  need  for  a  systematic \napproach  for  monitoring  the  implementation  of  labor  legislation.  Information  to  monitor  and \nanalyze the labor market, guide the development of HRD and labor policies, and monitor labor \nregulations  is  lacking.  To  date,  MHREL\u2019s  major  activities  relate  to  awarding  and  monitoring \nscholarships,  issuing  work  permits,  monitoring  the  expatriate  quota  system,  and  administering \nfee collection. Labor regulations and standards have to be updated and effectively implemented \nto encourage employers to employ Maldivians and to encourage Maldivians to seek and stay in \n\n \n\n\f6\n\n \n\n \n\nemployment.  Conditions  for  employment  need  to  be  better  aligned  to  social,  family,  and \ngeographic  constraints.  Some  of  the  salaries  offered  are  too  low  and  the  working  conditions, \nincluding the hours and days, are onerous. In cases where employees have to live on the work \npremises,  accommodation  standards,  especially  for  females,  are  sometimes  inappropriate. \nThere  is  a  dearth  of  data  and  analysis  to  inform  labor  market  policies.  MHREL  will  start \ncollecting  labor  force  survey  type  data  in  2004.  MHREL\u2019s  capacity  to  perform  more  effective \nlabor administration, labor market analysis, and labor policy formulation to help employees and \nemployers alike needs strengthening.  \n \nGovernment  Strategy  and  Policy.   The  proposed  Project  is  consistent  with  the \n20. \nGovernment\u2019s medium-term objectives and priorities defined in the Sixth National Development \nPlan  (6th  NDP)  and  Vision  2020.  The  key  social  priorities  of  the  6th  NDP  include  poverty \nreduction, promoting gender equity, decreased regional disparities, and increasing opportunities \nfor youths. The broad national development objective upon which the 6th NDP is based includes \nthe  need  to  \u201cincrease  human  resource  capacity  and  productivity  by  providing  relevant  training \nand employment opportunities.\u201d13 The urgency to address the needs of youths was underscored \nby the President\u2019s speech on November 2002 and July 2003 when he called for a national effort \nto  widen  employment  opportunities  in  the  country  as  the  number  of  youths  entering  the  job \nmarket was rising sharply.   \n \nADB  Strategy.  ADB\u2019s  Country  Strategy  and  Program  (CSP)  for  2002\u2013200414  for  the \n21. \nMaldives  focuses  on  poverty  reduction  through  a  combination  of  pro-poor  growth,  HRD,  and \ngood governance initiatives. The possibility of graduation from \u201cleast-developed country\u201d status \nis also taken into account. The strategy extends out to the islands where Maldives\u2019 vulnerable \ngroups  live  and  where  women\u2019s  employment  opportunities  are  limited.  In  education,  ADB\u2019s \nfocus  includes  extending  schooling  opportunities  to  residents  of  the  atolls  and  to  women  by \ndeveloping  distance  learning  in  postsecondary  education  and  by  developing  skills  through \nvocational  training.  The  ongoing  Postsecondary  Education  Development  Project  (PEDP)15  is \nsupporting MCHE to improve the quality and accessibility of postsecondary education, including \ndelivering education by distance mode. The focus is on upgrading the faculty and staff of MCHE \nfor  the  provision  of  good  quality  higher  education  to  those  who  have  completed  secondary \neducation.  The  proposed  Project  will  focus  on  employment-oriented  skills  training  for  those \nunable to go on to further education, and will provide some assistance to the development and \ndelivery of short-term training at MCHE. The ongoing ADB Regional Development Project16 will \nprovide  opportunities  for  increased  employment  in  the  Northern  and  Southern  Development \nregions. The Regional Development Project does not include HRD as a major component as it \nis predominantly an infrastructure-development initiative. \n \n22. \nLessons  Learned.  In  the  consultations  and  site  visits  during  project  preparation, \nconcerns  were  raised  by  various  groups  over  the  dangers  of  designing  and  implementing \neducation  and  training  deemed  by  the  community  and  employers  as  inferior  in  quality  and \nlacking relevance to local needs. To avoid a mismatch of education and training with the needs \nof  the  community,  mechanisms  must  be  established  to  encourage  participatory  planning  input \nfrom  employers,  employees,  community  representatives,  and  the  Government.

Governments  should  play  a  facilitating  role  in  skills  training  and \nprovide financing when it is for the economically and socially disadvantaged, or in occupations \nnot  offered  by  the  private  sector.18  Experience  with  offering  vocational  education  in  general \neducation shows that students do not gain any advantage in the labor market. It is also costly \nand gender-biased.19 \n \n23. \nADB  experience  in  the  Maldives  indicates  that  most  line  ministries  have  limited \nimplementation  capacity  due  to  scarcity  of  skilled  and  experienced  staff.  Delays  in  project \nimplementation  occur  primarily  in  the  initial  phases  of  appointing  consultants  and  awarding \ncontracts.  To  address  this  matter,  it  is  essential  to  strengthen  implementation  capacity  and \ncoordination  and  provide  long-term  training  for  project  staff  in  the  relevant  institutions  and \nagencies.20 \n \n24. \nDonor  Coordination.  Education  sector  projects  currently  under  way  in  the  Maldives \ninclude  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Third  Education  and  Training  Project,  which  provides  foreign  study \nscholarships  generally  at  the  Bachelor\u2019s  and  Master\u2019s  level.  The  project  also  provides  for  in-\nservice primary school teacher training, and civil works to increase secondary school enrollment \nparticularly  secondary  school  infrastructure,  particularly  in  the  atolls  where  population  density \njustifies the construction of a secondary school. The World Bank and the Government are also \npreparing an integrated multisector human development project that would include job-matching \nservices  and  microfinance,  components  that  complement  the  activities  of  this  ADB-assisted \nProject.  During  implementation,  coordination  of  activities  where  applicable  will  be  undertaken. \nOther relevant ongoing external assistance to education and HRD is listed in Appendix 3. \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nObjectives \n\n25. \nThe  goal  of  the  Project  is  to  increase  the  number  of  Maldivians,  men  and  women, \nactively  participating  in  the  labor  force  and  employed.  The  Project  will  provide  more \nemployment-oriented skills training in various occupations and improve the capacity to develop \nand  deliver  CBST.  The  Project  aims  to  (i) provide  youths  with  employment-oriented  skills \ntraining;  (ii) improve  public  perception  of  training  and  employment  in  locally  available  skills-\noriented  occupations;  (iii) make  available  employment-related  information  to  more  Maldivians; \nand (iv) strengthen the capacity for labor administration and for labor market analysis. These will \nbe  achieved  by  (i) increasing access to quality  employment-oriented  skills  training  in  selected \nregions,  (ii) social  marketing  and  improving  career  guidance  and  awareness  of  employment \nopportunities, and (iii) strengthening the capacity of MHREL.  \n \n26. \nTraining  in  the  Project  will  be  delivered  in  three  geographic  regions:  the  island  of  Mal\u00e9 \nand  adjacent  atolls,  the  Northern  Development  Region,  and  the  Southern  Development \n\n                                                 \n17 ADB. 2002.

Manila \n\n \n\n\f8\n\n \n\n \n\nRegion,21  where  regional  development  activities  are  ongoing.  The  Project  will  focus  on \ndelivering training in four key sectors: tourism, fisheries and agriculture, transport, and the social \nsectors.  These  are  included  in  the  national  development  priority  and  play  an  important  part  in \nthe continued economic well-being of the country. Tourism is a major employment sector and an \nimportant  source  of  foreign  exchange  revenue.  The  fisheries  sector  is  a  mainstay  of  the \neconomy,  particularly  for  people  living  in  the  atolls  and  islands,  and  the  development  of \nagriculture  is  important  to  national  food  security.  Transportation is an extremely important and \ngrowing sector supporting both tourism and the fisheries. The social sector, consisting primarily \nof  education  and  health,  is  critical  to  the  well-being  of  the  population  and  is  currently  heavily \nreliant on expatriate employment. \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nTraining Design, Development, and Delivery  \n\n27. \nThis  component  aims  to  increase  the  provision  of  CBST,  with  a  particular  focus  on \npreparing out-of-school youth for entry-level employment. To ensure that training programs are \nrelevant  to  employer  needs  and  to  impart  appropriate  skills  to  acceptable  performance \nstandards, \nthe  Project  will  be  (i) working  with  employment  sector  councils  (ESCs), \n(ii) strengthening  the  capacity  to  deliver  CBST,  and  (iii) delivering  coordinated  training \nprograms. The techniques to be used will be based on the principles and practices of learner-\nfocused adult education.  \n \n\na. \n\nIdentifying Human Resources Development Needs through \nEmployment Sector Councils \n\n28. \nThe  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  workforce  development  in  the  Maldives  require \nmechanisms to create working partnerships between employers and providers of employment-\noriented  education  and  training.  For  a  coordinated  approach  to  identifying  human  resource \nneeds  and  monitoring  the  effectiveness  of  training,  ESCs  will  be  established  in  the  four  focus \nsectors. Appendix 4 provides details on ESC operations. ESCs will prepare a human resource \nneeds  assessment  and  strategy  for  the  short-  and  medium-term  employment  needs  of  their \nsectors, and contribute to developing strategies to employ more Maldivians. ESCs will prioritize \nthe occupations in which there is demand for workers, and, with the support of the HRD training \nspecialists, prepare skills training proposals for project funding to help meet these occupational \nrequirements. ESCs will provide input to setting skills standards for assessment and certification \nthat  will  guide  the  development  of  training  programs.  ESCs  will  provide  feedback  on  training \nquality  and  relevance  of  training  provided.  ESCs  will  liaise  with  the  Maldives  Network  for \nEmployment  Training  (MNET)  to  place  trainees  in  jobs.  The  Project  will  provide  support  to \nworkshops,  consultations,  and  consulting  services  to  assist  in  the  preparation  of  human \nresource needs assessments and skills training program proposals in the respective sectors. \n \n\nb. \n\nStrengthening Capacity to Develop Competency-Based Skills \nTraining Programs \n\n29. \nThis subcomponent will augment local capacity to design and develop training programs \nand  related  instructional  materials.  It  will  support  the  development  of  CBST  programs  by \nproviding workshops and training for instructional program designers, developers, and trainers. \n \n                                                 \n21 This  consists  of  North  Thiladhunmathee  Atoll  (Haa  Alifu),  South  Thiladhunmathee  Atoll  (Haa  Dhaalu), \nNorthMiladhunmadulu  Atoll  (Shaviyani),  Mal\u00e9  Atolls,  North  Huvadhoo  Atoll  (Gaafu  Alifu),  South  Huvadhoo Atoll, \n(Gaafu Dhaalu), Foamullah Atoll (Gnaviyani), and Addu Atoll (Seenu). \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n9\n\n30. \nThe capacity of MAB to review and articulate the implementation of a national vocational \nqualifications policy and framework will be strengthened; where necessary, modifications of the \nframework  will  be  recommended.  The  Project  will  provide  consulting  services  and  staff \ndevelopment activities. The staff development will be for two MAB staff to further their education \nby  undergoing  studies  and  preparing  projects  supporting  the  articulation  of  skills  qualifications \nframework within the context of Maldives.  \n \n31. \nThe Project will support the development of competency-based skills standards. For the \nESC-prioritized occupations, skills standards will be developed through the coordinated efforts \nof  the  relevant  representatives/staff  of  ESCs  (mainly  practitioners);  MCHE;  MAB;  Ministry  of \nFisheries, Agriculture and Marine Resources; and the HRD training specialist. Relevant staff of \nMCHE,  MAB  and  MHREL  will  undergo  work-training  workshops  to  enhance  their  capacity to \nundertake occupational task analyses in vocational and technical areas. Skills standards will be \ndeveloped and adopted for a minimum of 40 occupations.  \n \n32. \nRelated CBST programs will be developed. Training program development will draw on \nthe expertise of MCHE, other public and private training and education providers, professional \ngroups,  and  practitioners.  The  Project  will  conduct  workshops  in  training  program  design  and \ndevelopment.  Where  existing  training  programs  are  available,  these  will  be  reviewed  and \nrevised  as  necessary,  according  to  the  skills  standards  and  the  needs  of  the  requesting  ESC. \nRepresentatives  from  private  training  providers  will  be  invited  to  participate  in  design  and \ndevelopment workshops. The Project will develop a system to monitor and evaluate the quality \nand relevance of training programs.  \n \n\nc. \n\nDelivering Skills Training Programs  \n\n \nIncreasing  Access.  The  Project  will  increase  access  to  skills  training  programs  by \n33. \nproviding for training delivery recurrent costs, which include instructor fees, consumables, and \nlearner  materials.  Appendix  5  presents  the  indicative  operational  manual  for  funding  training. \nThe skills training programs to be supported will be selected from those proposed by ESCs and \napproved  by  the  project  steering  committee  (PSC).  Course  fees  will  be  collected,  as \nappropriate. Criteria relating to the setting of course fees will be recommended and adopted by \nthe PSC. In addition, communities will be able to propose and obtain support for skills training \nwithin  the  four  sectors.  Overall,  women  will  constitute  at  least  40%  of  all  the  trainees  in  the \nProject.  Training  will  be  designed,  developed,  and  delivered  by  public  and  private  training \nproviders, including MCHE. \n \n34. \nThe  Project  will  support:  (i) training  for  potential  new  entrants  in  occupations  of  priority \nneed as identified by ESCs;  (ii) training for occupations currently occupied by expatriates who \nmay eventually be replaced by Maldivian employees as agreed by ESCs and further described \nin  each  sector\u2019s  strategic  human  resources  plan;  (iii) training  of  individuals  engaged  in  the \ninformal sector to enhance income generation opportunities; and (iv) training for occupations of \nfuture  need  as  identified  by  national  economic  priorities.  The  Project  will  consider  funding \n(i) training undertaken on the job to enhance the efficiency of existing workers within a particular \noccupational  category,  and  (ii) training  of  existing  employees  off  the  job  to  develop  new  skills \ndirectly linked to employment. \n \n35.  Maldives  Network  for  Employment  Training.  MNET  will  be  established  as  a \nsecretariat  to  facilitate  the  logistics  and  work  associated  with  the  design,  development,  and \ndelivery of training programs. The Project will establish an MNET office in Mal\u00e9 and one each in \nthe  Northern  and  Southern  Development  regions.  MNET  will  identify,  broker,  and  access \nresources for the design, development, marketing, and  delivery of quality employment-oriented \n\n \n\n\f10\n\n \n\n \n\neducation and training. MNET and the project implementation unit (PIU) will maintain databases \nof  skills  standards,  training  package  information,  providers,  students,  and  student  tracer \ninformation. MNET and the PIU  will  be  supported  through  consulting  services,  materials,  and \noffice equipment. MNET\u2019s functions will continue beyond the project implementation period. \n \nPolicy Dialogue for a Sustainable Fund for Training. The Project will conduct a policy \n36. \ndialogue with stakeholders to set up a sustainable mechanism to fund skills training for adoption \nduring  project  implementation.  The  Project  will  provide  consulting  services  to  analyze \nalternatives  for  sustainable  financing,  and  recommend an appropriate mechanism. Details will \nbe  developed  on  the  establishment,  set-up, and administration of the sustainable mechanism, \nincluding  its  organization,  operating  procedures,  criteria  for  evaluating  proposals  for  funding, \nand the contracting scheme. \n \n\n2. \n\nCareer Guidance, Employment Information, and Social Marketing \n\n37. \nThis  component  aims  to  (i) positively  impact  public  attitudes  and  perceptions  of  the \nconditions and benefits of employment, particularly in the private sector; (ii) increase awareness \nof employment opportunities; and (iii) provide career guidance.  \n \n38. \nSecondary  Schools.  Secondary  school  students  will  be  provided  with  career \ninformation. MYS will develop a career guidance program to more effectively inform youth and \nprovide  occupational  choice  in  the  world  of  work.  This  program  will  be  offered  in  cooperation \nwith  MOE  in  the  secondary  schools  located  in  the  Project\u2019s  regions.  This  subcomponent  will \ninclude training 90 teachers as focal points for career guidance, developing and disseminating \ncareer  information  materials,  providing  career  guidance  corners  in  secondary  schools, \nundertaking career-related school and community youth activities, and visits to work places and \nvisits by career role models. The development of learning materials and teachers\u2019 materials will \nreceive  inputs  from  ESCs,  MHREL,  and  MOE.  One  MYS  and  one  MOE  staff  member  will \nreceive support for further education in career guidance. Eight staff from MYS, MOE, MHREL, \nand  MCHE  will  receive  international  training  in  career  guidance.  Consulting  services  and \nrelevant  materials  will  be  provided  by  the  Project.  MYS  will  be  provided  with  assistance  to \ndevelop youth-oriented career guidance materials. \n \n39.  Maldives College of Higher Education. The capacity of MCHE to give career advice to \nstudents  will  be  developed.  Two  MCHE  staff  members  in  Mal\u00e9  and  two  from  the  regional \ncampuses will be given local training in career guidance. The Project will support the furnishing \nof a student career service center in the Mal\u00e9 campus of MCHE. These will facilitate the flow of \ninformation  to  students  on  available  employment  and  provide  students  with  services  to  guide \nthem through the process of deciding on a career, and searching and applying for a job.  \n \nCommunities. The Project will establish \u201cemployment information kiosks\u201d in 20 islands \n40. \nin  the  project  regions  and  in  two  locations  in  Mal\u00e9  to  disseminate  information  on  employment \nopportunities. These will be under the supervision of MHREL, Employment Section. The islands \nwill be chosen on the basis of population and economic activity, in consultation with the Ministry \nof Planning and National Development and Ministry of Atolls Administration. Activities will be in \ncooperation with the officials of the atoll offices, island offices, MYS, and the MCHE campus. An \nisland  resident  will  be  chosen  and  trained  to  assist  in  employment  information  dissemination. \nMNET sites will be provided with necessary office equipment; kiosks will be provided with notice \nboards  and  communications  equipment.  Employment  information  will  be  from  MHREL  and \nemployers.  \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n11\n\n41. \nSocial Marketing. Social marketing will seek to inform the public at large about the wide \nrange  of  occupations  available  in  different  economic  sectors,  and  the  merits  of  training  and \neducation with a view to changing attitudes toward employment. Public information campaigns \non  television,  radio,  and  in  print  will  be  prepared  and  disseminated  under  the  guidance  of \nMHREL,  Employment  Department,  and  in  cooperation  with  MYS.  The  programs  will  include \nstories  of  successful  Maldivian  men  and  women  in  the  four  sectors\u2014tourism,  fisheries  and \nagriculture,  transport,  and  the  social  sectors\u2014as  well  as  information  on  labor  legislation.  The \nprograms will also address the employment of women. A study on youth attitudes toward work \nwill be supported.     \n \n\n3. \n\nCapacity  Strengthening  of  the  Ministry  of  Human  Resources,  Employment \nand Labor  \n\nThis component aims to strengthen the capacity of MHREL to undertake its role as the \n42. \nministry responsible for labor administration, emphasizing a suitable balance between its role in \nlabor  protection  and  equity,  on  the  one  hand,  and  national  development  and  growth,  on  the \nother, and consistent with the limited resources available. A comprehensive labor administration \npolicy,  together  with  an  organizational  review  of  MHREL,  will  be  undertaken  with  a  view  to \nidentify areas where adjustments are needed for greater effectiveness and for implementation of \nlabor policies and regulations, including through staff development and realignment of units and \nresponsibilities  within  MHREL.  The  labor  administration  policy  will  be  developed  in  close \nconsultation  and  cooperation  between  the  labor  administration  consultant  and  MHREL  staff, \nthus serving as an on-the-job training element for MHREL staff. Other stakeholders, in particular \nworkers  and  employers,  will  also  be  consulted. The close cooperation between the consultant \nand  MHREL  staff  will  provide  MHREL  staff  with  a  better  understanding  of  the  structure, \norganization, and operations required for labor administration. Training and skills development \nnecessary for the effective delivery of labor administration services will also be provided.  \n \nThe existing Employment Regulations, the draft Employment Act, and labor policies will \n43. \nbe  examined  to  identify  ways  in  which  their  compliance  can  be  better  monitored,  including \nthrough  a  system  of  self-monitoring  and  self-inspection  as  well  as  through  the  drafting  of \nimplementable and monitorable supporting regulations where necessary. \n \n44. \nThe  development  of  the  labor  market  information  system  (LMIS)  will  be  supported  by \nstrengthening  the  capacity  of  relevant  MHREL  staff  to  collect  and  analyze  labor  market \ninformation for policy analysis and labor market signaling. Policy studies will be conducted in the \nfollowing  areas:  (i) the  impact  of  expatriate  workers  and  localization  of  labor  on  the  economy; \n(ii) attitudes  toward  employment  in  the  atolls;  (iii) gender  aspects  of  employment  in  selected \nsectors; and (iv) wage structures and working conditions. The Project will provide materials and \nequipment, consulting services, and staff development. \n \nC.  \n \n45. \nPrivate Sector Participation. Extensive consultations were held during the preparation \nof  the  Project,  including  with  the  private  sector. In addition to consultations, the private sector \nwas  a  member  of  the  project  preparation  steering  committee.  During  project  implementation, \nemployers, as well as employees, will be members of ESCs. The project design is based on the \nactive  participation  of  employers  to  ensure  market  orientation,  relevance,  and  quality  of  skills \ntraining programs. Private sector employers will also be represented in the PSC.  \n \n46. \nPolicy.  The  Project  supports  the  development  and  articulation  of  a  vocational \nqualification  framework  and  occupational  performance  standards  to  assure  the  quality  and \n\nSpecial Features \n\n \n\n\f12\n\n \n\n \n\nrelevance of skills training programs. The Project also supports the development of a policy for \nsustainable financing of skills training that would be less dependent on the recurrent budget and \npublic  provision.  This  will  contribute  to  maintaining  skills  training  responsiveness  to  changing \neconomic development and labor market needs.  \n \nD.  \n\nCost Estimates \n\n47. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $7.5 million equivalent, including physical \ncontingency  and  price  escalation,  taxes  and  duties,  and  interest  charges.  Of  the  total  cost, \n$2.1 million  (28%)  comprises  the  foreign  exchange  cost,  and  $5.4 million  equivalent  (72%) \ncomprises  the  local  currency  cost.

The Borrower will be the Republic of the Maldives. The loan \nwill have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1% \nper year during the grace period and 1.5% per year during the remaining term and such other \nterms and conditions as set forth  in  the  Loan  Agreement.  ADB  will  finance  80%  of  the  project \ncost,  including  100%  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  72%  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The \nGovernment  will  finance  the  remaining  $1.5 million  equivalent  of  local  costs.

The implementing agency will be MHREL. \nA  PSC  will  be  established  to  facilitate  policy  dialogue,  advise  the  project  manager  (PM)  of \nconcerns and issues related to all aspects of project implementation, and facilitate coordination \nbetween ministries and agencies. A PIU will be established. The PIU will be responsible for the \ntimely implementation of all project components and for procurement packages. Working groups \nwill  be  organized  to  coordinate  and  guide  the  implementation  of  project  components  and \nactivities. See Appendix 7 for the Project's organization chart. \n \n51. \nThe PM will function under the authority delegated by MHREL. The PM will serve as the \nsecretary  to  the  PSC  and  as  such  ensure  the  proper  operation  of  the  Project.  Policy  issues \nrelated to overall implementation of the Project will be brought to the attention of the PSC. The \nPM  will  be  guided  by  the  policy  decisions  approved  by  the  PSC.  For  administrative purposes, \nthe  PM  will  report  to  the  assistant  executive  director,  MHREL.  The  PSC  will  consist  of \nrepresentatives from ministries and MCHE, and two representatives from the private sector, and \nthe  project  director.  The  ministries  are  MHREL  (chairperson),  MOFT,  Ministry  of  Planning  and \nNational  Development,  Ministry  of  Atolls  Administration,  MOE,  MYS,  and  the  Ministry  of \nWomen\u2019s Affairs and Social Security. The composition of the PSC is subject to approval by the \nOffice of the President. Other ministries may be invited to PSC meetings as necessary. \n\n2.  \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  5  years  beginning  in  April  2004  and \n\n52. \nending in March 2009.  The overall project implementation schedule is shown in Appendix 8. \n \n\n3.  \n\nProcurement \n\nThe  procurement  of  goods  and  services  financed  by  ADB  will  be  undertaken  in \n53. \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  and  the  Government\u2019s  procedures \n\n                                                 \n22 ADB Operations Manual Section 11. 1995. Lending Foreign Exchange for Local Expenditures on Projects. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f14\n\n \n\n \n\nacceptable to ADB. Civil works consist mainly of refurbishing existing facilities. No contract for \ncivil  works  is  estimated  to  cost  more  than  $1.0 million  equivalent.  International  competitive \nbidding  procedures  will,  therefore,  not  be  necessary.  Contracts  costing  up  to  a  maximum of \n$1.0 million  will  be  awarded  under  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB)  procedures  acceptable  to \nADB.  Equipment  for  the  PIU,  ESCs,  MNET  access  sites,  and  employment  kiosks  will  be \nprocured  by  LCB  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Office  furniture  for  the  PIU,  ESCs,  access \nsites, and the employment sites will also be procured by LCB acceptable to ADB. Instructional \nmaterials will be procured by international shopping while the production of television and radio \nprograms  to  support  the  social  marketing  component  will  be  procured  by  LCB  acceptable  to \nADB. For off-the-shelf items valued at less than $100,000, direct purchase procedures can be \nused. Appendix 9 shows the tentative procurement packages.  \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n54. \nThe  selection  and  engagement  of  all  consulting  services  to  be  financed  under  the \nProject  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  A  team  of \nconsultants to provide services in a range of specialties with estimated international inputs of 28 \nperson-months and domestic inputs of 50 person-months will be engaged through a firm using \nthe  quality  and  cost-based  selection  method.  Another  4  person-months  of international inputs \nfor  services  in  labor  administration  will  be  provided  by  an  individual  consultant.  In  case  the \nexpertise  for  domestic  inputs  is  not  locally  available,  international  consultants  will  be  used. \nAppendix 10 gives the indicative terms of reference.  \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements  \n\n55.  MHREL  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  disbursement  projections  and  requesting \nbudgetary allocations for counterpart funds. After the loan becomes effective, the Government \nwill establish an imprest account at the Maldives Monetary Authority. The initial amount will be \nno  more  than  a  6-month  projected  disbursement  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount.  The  imprest \naccount  will  be  established,  managed,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  both  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  and  with  detailed  arrangements  agreed  to  by  the  Government  and \nADB.  The  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure  procedures  may  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible \nexpenditures  and  to  liquidate  advances  made  into  the  imprest  account  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  loan  disbursement  guidelines.  These  procedures  will  be  applicable  to  individual \npayments  amounting  to  $50,000  or  less.  MHREL  will  coordinate  the  timely  release  of  funds. \nAuditors  acceptable  to  ADB  will  audit  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  statement  of \nexpenditure procedures. A separate audit opinion should be included in the annual audit report.  \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n56.  MHREL, through its PIU, will maintain records and accounts adequate to identify goods \nand  services  financed  out  of  the  proceeds  of  the  loan.  MHREL  will  (i) maintain  separate \naccounts for the Project; (ii) ensure that accounts and financial statements are audited annually, \nin accordance with sound accounting principles by auditors acceptable to ADB; and (iii) furnish \nto  ADB,  not  later  than  9  months  after  the  close  of  each  fiscal  year,  certified  copies  of  audited \naccounts and financial statements, and the report of the auditor on these. \n \n57.  MHREL  will  submit  progress  reports  every  3  months.  The  reports  will  be  in  a  format \nacceptable  to  ADB,  and  will  include  (i) progress  made  against  established  targets,  including \naspects  of  quality;  (ii) delays  and  problems  encountered,  and  actions  taken  to  resolve  issues; \n(iii) compliance with loan covenants; (iv) proposed program of activities to be undertaken during \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n15\n\nthe next 3 months; and (v) expected progress during the succeeding period. Within 3 months of \nphysical  completion  of  the  Project,  the  Government  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  a  project \ncompletion report on the execution of the Project, including the costs and compliance with loan \ncovenants. \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n58. \nIn accordance with ADB\u2019s Project Performance Management System  (PPMS), a shortlist \nof  verifiable  indicators  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  was  prepared.  This  list  will  be  expanded \nand  refined  during  project  inception.  PPMS  activities  will  be  conducted  periodically  to  gather \ninformation  through  multiple  sources  so  as  to  determine  whether  the  input  deliveries  for \nimplementing program activities have rendered expected benefits to the intended beneficiaries. \nThe  PPMS  also  seeks  to  detect  any  deficiency  and  discrepancy  between  the  plan  and  the \nexecution  of  a  program  using  resources  efficiently  so  that  timely  corrections  can  be  made  to \nupdate the Project and thus improve the benefits, outcomes, and impacts. The PPMS will use \ninformation from the annual and semiannual reviews, midterm review (MTR), periodic evaluation \nand  studies,  and  employer  and  trainee  feedback.  PIU  human  resources  specialists  will  be \ntrained in project monitoring and evaluation. Baseline labor data will be from the planned 2004 \nLabor  Force  Survey  and/or  the  2005  Census;  otherwise, the source will be the 2000 Census. \nSee Appendix 11 for indicative and evaluation indicators. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n59. \nIn addition to regular reviews, the Government and ADB will jointly undertake an MTR of \nthe  Project  at  the  end  of  the  third  year  of  project  implementation  or  at  any  time  as  may  be \nagreed  by  the  parties.  The  MTR  will  review  and  evaluate:  (i) the  project  scope,  design, \nimplementation  arrangements,  and  institutional  processes;  (ii)  review  the  training  funding \nmechanism;  (iii) implementation  progress  against  indicators  based  on  the  project  framework; \n(iv) procurement  performance;  (v) ESC  activities  and  coordination;  (vi) vocational  framework \nand its implementation by MAB; (vii) PIU's and working group's effectiveness; (viii) performance \nagainst  the  gender  strategy;  and  (ix) compliance  with  loan  covenants.  The  MTR  will  identify \ncritical issues and constraints, if any, and identify changes needed in any of the above areas. At \nthe latest 1 month prior to the MTR, the PIU will submit to ADB a comprehensive report on each \nof  the  above-mentioned  issues.  The  MTR  will  recommend  changes  in  the  design  and \nimplementation of the Project as necessary.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\n60. \nThe main project benefits are: (i) more skilled Maldivians in the labor force and sharing \nin the benefits of economic development; (ii) increased capacity to design, develop, and deliver \ndemand-oriented  skills  training;  and  (iii) improved  labor  administration  and  labor market \nanalysis. Benefits to society at large will accrue through human development that is necessary \nfor  the  country\u2019s  development.  The  availability  of  skilled  labor  contributes  to  meeting  the \nmacroeconomic goals of the country, notably addressing the balance of payments, retention of \nforeign  exchange,  and  availability  of  semi-skilled  human  resources . The direct beneficiaries of \nthe Project will be: (i) unemployed youths, including women; (ii) island communities; (iii) various \nministries  addressing  the  issues  of  youths,  HRD,  and  training;  and  (iv) public  and  private \ntraining providers.  \n \n\n \n\n\f16\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA. \n\nProject Benefits and Impacts \n\n61. \nEconomic Benefits. With about half of Maldivians not in the labor force, the economic \ngrowth of  the  Maldives  has  been  aided  by  the  employment  of  expatriate  workers.  The  Project \nwill generate increases in labor productivity that will increase the competitiveness of Maldivians \nin the labor market. Coupled with MHREL\u2019s increased capacity to monitor and  implement labor \nregulations and perform labor market analysis, the above activities will lead to the employment \nof more Maldivians in current and future positions that may be presently and/or expected to be \nheld by expatriates. In addition, employment of more Maldivians will contribute to the retention \nof more foreign exchange. \n \n62. \nThrough  the  Project\u2019s  various  components,  the  matching  of  labor  supply  with  labor \ndemand  will  improve.  The  involvement  of  the  private  sector,  the  Government,  and  skills \npractitioners in determining the human resource needs in the selected sectors and in developing \nneeded training programs will yield good quality labor market information and more appropriate \ntraining  programs.  MHREL\u2019s  increased  capacity  to  analyze  labor  market  data  will  enable  it  to \ngive  timely  guidance  on  the  changing  needs  of  the  labor  market.  MNET\u2019s  establishment  will \ncontribute  to  facilitating  and  coordinating  the  different  stakeholders  and  requirements  for \ntraining.  The  wider  dissemination  of  information  on  employment  opportunities  will  reduce  the \nsearch time for both employees and employers. \n \n63. \nAbout  6,000  youths  will  receive  employment-oriented skills training through the Project \nthat  meets  employers\u2019  requirements.  Where  half  of  the  trainees  would  find  employment  for  at \nleast 5 years and earn on average Rf2,000 per month, the project investment would be justified, \nwith  an  indicative  economic  rate  of  return  of  33%.  See  Appendix  12  for  the  economic  and \nfinancial  analysis.  Without  the  project,  the  Maldives  will  continue  to  repatriate  increasing \namounts of foreign exchange for the increasing number of expatriate workers it needs for further \neconomic development, representing forgone income that could be shared by local Maldivians \nand used for further development activities. \n \n64. \nInstitutional  Benefits.  ESCs  and  partnerships  will  encourage  policy  dialogue  among \nthe  different  employment  stakeholders  that  would  lead  to  greater  coordination  of  activities, \nthereby increasing the efficiency in the investment on skills training. The establishment of MNET \nwill  facilitate  the  coordination  of  training  requirements  and  training  provision.  Increasing  the \ndomestic  capacity  at  MCHE  and  MOE  to  design  skills  training  programs  and  develop  related \ninstructional materials will contribute to: (i) increasing the range of skills training programs that \ncan be developed; (ii) decreasing the development time of programs and related materials; and \n(iii) increasing  program  quality.  Private  training  providers\u2019  capacity  in  these  areas  will  also  be \nstrengthened  when  they  participate  in  project  workshops.  Articulation  of  the  skills  training \ncompetency  framework  and  skills  standards  will  provide  the  framework  for  designing  and \naccrediting training programs offered by various training providers, including the participation of \nthe  private  sector.  MHREL\u2019s  capacity  for  effective  labor  administration  will  be  enhanced  such \nthat  compliance  with  labor  regulations  will  be  better  monitored  and  labor-market  analysis  is \nstrengthened.  \n \n65. \nSocial Dimensions. Participatory consultations were held during the project preparatory \ntechnical  assistance  (PPTA)  with  the  representatives  of  the  communities,  youths,  women, \ngovernment, and private sector to identify needs and discuss the role of skills training in various \nsectors.  The  PPTA  incorporated  the  findings  of  ADB\u2019s  Poverty  Reduction  in  the  Maldives and \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n17\n\nWomen  in  the  Republic  of  Maldives.23,  24  See  Appendix  13  for  the  summary  and  poverty \nreduction and social strategy. \n \n66. \nThe  Project  will  address  primarily  the  training  and  unemployment  problems  of  youths. \nThe  Project  will  benefit  (i) youths  aged  16\u201334;  (ii) primary  school  completers  with  no  further \neducation, (ii) secondary school completers, (iii) island communities with little access to training, \nand  (iv) job-seekers.  Through  the  development  of  modular  CBST  programs  that  can  be \ndelivered  flexibly,  the  Project  will  train  mostly  out-of-school  youths  in  market-relevant skills. \nTraining  will  be  offered  not  only  in  Mal\u00e9  but  also  in  the  islands,  where  there  is  greater \nvulnerability.  Community  initiatives  will  address  the  needs  of  the  smaller  islands,  which  have \nless access to training programs and formal employment. \n \n67. \nGreater  labor  force  participation  among  youths  will  be  encouraged  through  positive \nmessages on employment. Gender disparity in the labor market is addressed through the career \nguidance  and  employment  services,  and  training  provision  components.  Through  social \nmarketing,  more  girls  and  women  will  be  encouraged  to  participate  in  the  labor  market  by \nmeans of positive images of employment opportunities. More training programs that are women-\nfriendly will be delivered. At least 40% of all trainees will be women.  \n \n68. \nJob-seekers,  in  the  islands  and  in  Mal\u00e9,  will  be  better  informed  on  employment \nopportunities  and  will  be  given  assistance  in  the  job  application  process.  More  effective  labor \nadministration will lead to welfare improvements of both employees and employers. Community \nresidents  in  the  target  regions  will  benefit  through  access  to  career  guidance  materials  and \ninformation  delivered  through  MNET,  atoll  offices,  schools,  and  other  social  sector  service \nfacilities.  \n \nB. \n\nProject Assumptions and Risks \n\nThe success of the Project in meeting its goal primarily assumes that the economy of the \n69. \nMaldives  continues  to  grow  and  create  and  new  jobs.  In  addition,  it  also  assumes  that: \n(i) employers are going to hire more skilled Maldivian workers; (ii) Maldivian youths will actively \nseek  employment,  including  in  occupations  other  than  white-collar,  and  will  seek  training;  and \n(iii) stakeholders  will  cooperate  and  coordinate  with  each  other  in  a  timely  and  constructive \nmanner. The proposed Project aims to mitigate the risks of these assumptions not holding true \nby:  (i) identifying,  developing,  and  delivering  training  that  is  oriented  toward  the  needs  of  the \nlabor  market;  (ii) building  the  capacity  of  MHREL  for  more  effective  monitoring  and \nimplementation  of  labor  legislation  and  labor  market  analysis;  (iii) implementing  a  social \nmarketing  program  aimed  not  only  at  students  but  also  at  parents  and  communities  and \ndelivering a modified career guidance program in secondary schools; (iv) having wide sectoral \nrepresentation  on  the  PSC  and  in  ESCs,  as  well  coordination  efforts  through  MNET  and  PIU; \nand  (iv) actively  encouraging  dialogue  with  and  participation  of  the  private  sector  in  project \nimplementation.  \n \n70. \nImplementation  Risk.  Project  implementation  assumes  that  skilled  and  experienced \nstaff  are  available  for  recruitment  for  project  activities.  The  Appraisal  Mission  assessed  the \navailability  of  personnel  and  received  an  assurance  from  MHREL  that  PIU  would  be  properly \nstaffed. Previous delays in project implementation occurred in the initial phases due to delays in \nawarding  contracts  and  appointing  consultants.  PIU  staff  will  include  a  procurement  and \ndisbursement  specialist  to  oversee  these  activities.  Advance  action  in  the  recruitment  of \n\n                                                 \n23 ADB. 2001. Country Briefing Paper on Women in the Republic of Maldives. Manila. \n24 ADB. 2002. Poverty Reduction in the Maldives: Issues, Findings, and Approaches. Manila.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18\n\n \n\n \n\nconsultants  is  requested.  A  technical  adviser  will  also  be  recruited  to  provide  project \nmomentum.  Effective  project  implementation  will  require  good  coordination  and  cooperation \nbetween  ministries  and  agencies.  The  PIU  and  working  groups  will  facilitate  coordination  and \nimplementation of activities.  \n \nInstitutional Risk.  Achieving  better  labor  administration  assumes  that  (i) MHREL staff \n71. \ntrained under the Project will not be transferred to other institutions, (ii) collection and analysis of \nlabor  market  data  will  be  timely,  and  (iii) MHREL  will  receive  the  appropriate  amount  of \nresources  to carry out its mandate. Staff turnover in the Government is not high, which should \nmean that the Government will have the staff in place during the implementation period. MHREL \nis staffing its planning section with qualified personnel. The Government assured the Appraisal \nMission that the required resources for the functioning of MHREL would be met.   \n \nThe effectiveness of ESCs rests on commitment and cooperation among its members. \n72. \nCompanies  and  agencies  are  expected  to  support  the  ESC  concept  with  the  participation  of \nrepresentatives/staff and attendance in meetings and related activities. The PPTA experience, \nwith the cooperation of PSC members, was positive and there is expectation that constructive \nfacilitate  exchanges  and \ndialogue  will  continue.  The  PIU,  as  ESC  secretariat,  will \ncommunication among ESC members.  \n \n \nSocial Risk.  Training  programs  developed  are  assumed  to  be  relevant  to  local  needs \n73. \nand  of  good  quality.  ESCs\u2019  articulation  of  human  resource  needs  and  MNET  facilitation  of  the \ndelivery  of  training  will  contribute  to  ensuring  training  relevance.  The  Project  will  employ  a \nparticipatory process involving private and public sector employers, employees, the community \nrepresentatives, and the Government.  \n \n74. \nThe social marketing component runs the risk of its targeted audience being unreceptive \nto  the  messages.  The  Project  will  employ  participatory  design  processes  and  adopt  a \nmultipronged  strategy  through  schools  and  various  media.  In  addition,  the  school  career \nguidance counselors selected will have a good understanding of Maldivian culture. \n \n75. \nThe  Project  will  have  no  negative  environmental  impact.  The  Project  includes no new \nconstruction and is unlikely to trigger ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy. Training programs \nwill be taking place in schools and/or employment places that have proper disposal facilities for \nmaterials  used.  Also,  the  Project  is  unlikely  to  bring  into  play  the  ADB  Policy  on  Indigenous \nPeoples.  \n \n\n \n\nV.  \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n76. \nassurances for effective project implementation: \n \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government has made a number of specific \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe Government will ensure that the four ESCs are established and its members \nnotified  of  their  membership  and  responsibilities  within  one  month  of  loan \neffectiveness; \nESCs  will  have  representatives  of  employers  and  employees  working  in  the \nrespective  sectors  as  well  as  regional  representation.  All  necessary  and \nappropriate  measures  will  be  taken  to  ensure  that  women  are  represented  on \nESCs. Each ESC will have at least two women; \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n\n \n19\n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  sufficient  budget  allocations  will  be  made  to \ncover recurrent costs needed for effective project implementation, in particular in \nrelation to the daily operations of the PIU and MHREL; \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  admission  requirements  to  the  various \ntraining  programs  will  take  into  account  the  occupational  profiles  developed \nunder the training design, development, and delivery component; \n\n(v)  Within  24  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  government  will  have  adopted  a \n\npolicy on sustainable funding for training, including provision for cost recovery; \nProject funds allocated for the development and delivery of training programs will \nbe  distributed  to  each  of  the  four  sectors  in  a  manner  that  reflects  accurate \neconomic  and  social  development  needs.  To  that  extent,  each  ESC  will  be \nrequested to submit proposals for at least three training programs a year. At least \ntwo proposals per ESC will be selected for funding, in accordance with selection \ncriteria agreed upon with the ADB; \n\n(vii)  At least 5% of project funds allocated for the development and delivery of training \nprograms will be allocated for training programs identified by communities every \nyear.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  ESCs  will  actively  seek  community \nparticipation in identifying and delivering these training programs; \n\n(viii)  The Government will take all necessary and appropriate measures to ensure that \nat least 40% of all trainees will be women and implement the gender strategy (as \ndetailed in Appendix 11, Section D of this document); \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  candidates  selected  for  training  in  career \nguidance speak Dhivehi and have in-depth understanding of Maldivian culture; \n\n(ix) \n\n(x)  Within  1  year  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  draft  Employment  Act  will  have  been \n\nsubmitted to Parliament; and \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  sufficient  airtime  on  national  television  will  be \nallocated  for  dissemination  campaigns  under  the  career  guidance,  employment \ninformation, and social marketing component. \n\n(xi) \n\n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement of \n77. \nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  4,196,000  to  the  Republic  of  the  Maldives  for  the  Employment  Skills \nTraining Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1% \nper  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  a  term  of  32  years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n\nTadao Chino \nPresident \n\n \n \n5 November 2003 \n\n \n\n\fPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n\nPerformance \nTargets \n\nMonitoring \nMechanism \n\nAssumptions \nand Risks \n\n \n\nIncrease the number of \nMaldivians, men and \nwomen, actively \nparticipating in the labor \nforce and employed   \n \n\nLabor force participation \nrate to increas e by 5% \nby 2009 \n \n\nMinistry of Planning and \nNational Development  \ncensus statistics  \n\nMinistry of Human \nResources, Employment \nand Labor (MHREL) \nlabor market statistics  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nProject monitoring and \nevaluation data  \n\nProject progress reports \n\nMinistry of Education \n(MOE) and MHREL data \n\nReview missions \n\nImpact studies \n\nIncreased access to a \ngreater number of \nemployment-oriented \nskills training programs \nin selected regions of the \ncountry and train at least \n6,000 youths \n\nGreater capacity by \nrelevant education a nd \ntraining providers to \ndevelop and deliver a \nrange of skills training \nprograms \n\nMaldivians are better \ninformed of the \nemployment situation \nand opportunities in the \ncountry  \n\nAttitudes of parents and \nyouths toward skilled, \nvocational, and technical \noccupati ons are more \npositive \n\nLabor market information \nanalysis is improved \n\nThe economy of the \nMaldives continues to \ngrow and create new \njobs  \n\nYouths will actively s eek \ntraining and \nemployment in \noccupations in the \nprivate sector, including \nblue -collar positions  \n\nEmployers are going to \nhire more Maldivians \n\nTraining needs are \nidentified in a timely \nmanner \n\nThere will be capacity to \ndeliver an increased \nnumber of training \nprograms \n\nThe public is receptive \nto media campaign and \ninformation \ndissemination  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nEstablish project \nimplementation unit and \nproject steering \n\nProject monitoring and \nevaluation data  \n\nGovernment and private \nsector are committed to \nthe partnership for \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n20\n\nAppendix 1 \n\nDesign  \nSummary \n \nGoal \n\n \nPurpose \n\nProvide more \nemployment-oriented \nskills training in various \noccupations and \nimprove the capacity to \ndevelop and deliver \ncompetency-based \nskills training (CBST)  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \nComponents/Outputs \n\n1.

Employers,  including  the  Government,  hire  expatriate  workers  in  the \nabsence of properly trained and qualified Maldivians. This is against the backdrop of  untapped \nhuman  resources,  which  includes  the  large  number  of  youths  who  are  not  in  the  labor  force; \nhave  completed  primary  education  but  could  not  continue  on  to  further  education;  and  are \ncapable  but  have  limited  access  to  skills  training  programs.  In  2000,  there  were  over  25,000 \nyouths aged 15 to 19 (77% of the cohort)3 who were not in the labor force and over 21,000 of \nthose  aged  20  to  34.  In  this  connection,  the  Maldives  faces  the  challenges  of  (i) making the \nprospective  Maldivian  employee  more  attractive  to  the  employer,  and  (ii) making  training  and \nemployment more attractive to the Maldivian employee.   \n \n2. \nLabor Force.  According  to  the  2000  Population  and  Housing  Census  (Census),  only \n56%  of  working-age  Maldivians  were  in  the  labor  force4  and  about  a  third  of  them  were \nemployed  in  Mal\u00e9;  in  addition,  there  were  about  30,664  foreign  workers,  comprising \napproximately 24% of the total labor force.5 In 1990, there were only 8,700 expatriate workers or \n13% of the labor force. Repatriation of wages contributes significantly to the outflow of foreign \nexchange. A large number of expatriate jobs could eventually be filled by qualified Maldivians if \n(i) employment-oriented  education  and  training  programs  were  available;  (ii) a  systemic \napproach was used to coordinate resources and stakeholders in labor supply and employment \ndemand; and (iii) labor regulations were effectively implemented to ensure equal and equitable \nworking conditions, wages and benefits for women and men, Maldivians and expatriates. \n \n3. \nIn  the  2000  Census,  expatriates  were  mostly  in  unskilled (42%) and semiskilled (36%) \noccupations.  More  than  80%  were  employed  in  resorts,  construction,  business  activities, \neducation, apparel, and hotels and restaurants. In the resorts, most expatriates work as chefs, \ncooks,  bartenders,  accountants,  sports \nthe \nconstruction sector, a large number work as carpenters, masons, construction laborers, drivers, \nand  electricians.  In  business  activities,  they  work  as  accountants,  auditors,  tailors,  barbers, \ndrivers, and laborers. In education, most are employed as secondary school teachers. \n \n4. \nMost  of  these  jobs  could  be  filled  by  Maldivians  but  the  salaries  paid  to  expatriate \nworkers are deemed too low and the working conditions, including the working hours and days, \nare  onerous.  Most  of  the  expatriate  workers  are  from  Bangladesh,  India,  and  Sri  Lanka. \nTypically, their remuneration packages include accommodation and once-a-year airfare to their \nhome country. Sample data indicate that even with extra benefits and expenses incurred by the \nemployer,  the  expatriate  workers  in  some  categories  receive  about  80%  to  85%  of  the \nMaldivian\u2019s salary and benefits.  \n \n\ninstructors,  and  maintenance \n\nlaborers. \n\nIn \n\n                                                 \n1  Between 1995 and 2002, the average annual growth rate was 7%. \n2  Where labor force data comparisons are made, the reference date is 2000, when the last Census was conducted. \n3  This  includes  youths  in  school,  over  20,000.  However,  this  latter  figure  does  not  match  enrollment  figures  in  the \n\nMaldives College of Higher Education (MCHE), and the higher secondary schools. \n\n4  Population and Housing Census take 12 as the eligible age for employment. Until April 2003, the legal age for   \nworking  and  labor  regulation  was  14.  As  of  May  2003,  the  minimum  age  has  been  increased  to  18.  This Project \nreport uses 15 and 64 as the reference ages. \n\n5  The percentage calculation includes Maldivians and expatriates as the total workforce. \n\n\f28\n\nAppendix 2 \n\nBased on the current level of expatriate employment, there are about 14,000 skilled and \n5. \nsemiskilled  jobs  potentially  eligible  for  suitably  qualified  Maldivians.  The  qualification  category \n\u201csemiskilled\u201d  consists  primarily  of  artisans  with  little  or  no  formal  preparation  for  their  field  of \nemployment. Craft and trade workers such as electricians, carpenters, masons, welders, and \nplumbers have completed some form of apprenticeship including pre-apprenticeship training in \ntheoretical  principles  of  their  trade,  applied  mathematics,  issues  related  to  health, safety, and \nthe environment. Technician qualification generally requires basic education plus 1 or 2 years of \nstudy  leading  to  a  certificate.  Technologists  require  2  or  3  years  of  postsecondary  studies \nleading to a diploma issued by a college, institute of technology, or polytechnic.   \n \n6. \nYouths.  The  increased  birthrate  in  the  late  1980s  and  early  1990s  has  resulted  in  a \npopulation increase of youths now in their mid- to late-teens. This cohort of 15- to 19-year-old \ngirls and boys has completed primary school, is progressing through secondary school, and will \nsoon  be  seeking  access  to  further  education  or  employment.  Despite  the  expansion  of \nsecondary education, in 2002, approximately 5,357 boys and girls6 terminated their education at \nthe end  of  grade  7.  Although  more  students  may  be  going  to  secondary  school  and  obtaining \nOrdinary-level  (O-level)  passes  in  the  future,  a  large  number  of  students  will  still  need \nemployment-oriented skills training. A large proportion of this cohort is unlikely to access further \neducation  or  employment-oriented  training  within  the  existing  education  and  training  system. \nWhile access to and quality of academic education continues to improve, greater consideration \nneeds to be given to the needs of the youths for whom further academic education will not be \npossible. \n \n7. \nDemand  for  Skills  Training  and  Employment.  Students  who  leave  school  after \ncompleting grade 7 or who discontinue secondary studies without passing O-level examinations \nface  limited  employment  skills  training  opportunities.  Students  and  their  parents  seek \nopportunities  when  they  leave  school.  Although  the  national  labor  force  participation  rate  is \nrelatively  low,  attitudes  towards  employment  are  starting  to  change  as  evidenced  by  the \nincreasing  numbers  of  applicants  for  advertised  positions  in  Mal\u00e9.  Expectations  of  most \nstudents  and  parents  are  that  children  would  continue  on  to  higher  education  or  obtain  white-\ncollar jobs. During focus group discussions, youths indicated that they are interested in skilled \njobs.  Constituents  in  the  atolls  are  requesting  various  Maldives  College  of  Higher  Education \n(MCHE) faculties to offer more skills training programs, e.g., electrical wiring and housekeeping \nfor  resorts.  Prevailing  social  attitudes  and  parental concern for the welfare of girls continue to \nlimit  female  participation  in  employment  away  from  the  home  island  and  community.  Attitudes \nrelating to the employment of women in resorts are also changing with the increasing numbers \nof women being employed,  mainly  in  clerical  positions.  There  is  a  need  to  increase  the  very \nshort-term  to  short-term  courses  that  can  be  more  flexibly  and  regularly  offered  in  various \nregions/islands.  Skills  training  obtained  should  address  the  needs  of  the  labor  market  and \nshould also be acceptable to students and their parents. \n \n8. \nThere  is  growing  awareness  and  concern  to  find  a  solution  to  youth  unemployment, \nwhich,  at  times,  may  go  hand  in  hand  with  social  ills  such  as  drug  abuse  and  involvement  in \nantisocial  activities.  There  is  equally  a  greater  demand  by  youths  themselves  for  job \nopportunities.7  In  the  atolls  and  islands,  employment  expectations  are  frequently  equated  to  a \njob in a government office or a career in education or health. Government demand or need for \nadditional  employees  in  the  next  10  years  is  expected  to  be  less  than  the  supply  of  youths \n\n                                                 \n6  By gender, 2,921 boys and 2,436 girls left school after grade 7. \n7  As seen in interviews with government minis tries and private sector firms.  \n\n\f                                                                                                                                                         Appendix 2 \n\n29\n\nseeking  employment.  New  employment  opportunities  are  required  and  a  reorientation  to \nnongovernment jobs is necessary.  \n \n9. \nProvision of  Skills  Training.  Preemployment  skills  training  in  the  Maldives  is  being \nprovided  by  MCHE,  through  its  various  faculties,  and  private  training  providers.  Many  resorts \nand  firms  provide  on-the-job  training  and/or  finance  the  education  or  training  courses  of  their \nemployees.  At  present,  short-term  preemployment  skills  training  courses  need  to  be \nstrengthened and expanded, to meet the human resource needs of the country and the needs \nof  the  large  number  of  school  leavers.  Some  employers  expressed  during  project  preparation \nthat secondary and postsecondary student-graduates are not properly trained for positions they \ntake on after graduation.   \n \nThe  mandates  of  the  faculties  are  for  human  resource  development.  For  instance,  the \n10. \nmandate  of  the  Faculty  of  Engineering  Technology  (FET)  (formerly,  Maldives  Institute  for \nTechnical  Education)  includes  the  development  and  provision  of  technical  skills  for  industrial \ndevelopment in technical, manufacturing and engineering fields. All the faculties offer short-term \ntraining.  The  Center  for  Maritime  Studies  (CMS)  offers  mostly  short  training  courses8 and, to \ndate,  enrolls  the  most  number  of  students.  FET  and  the  Faculty  of  Hospitality  and  Tourism \nStudies  (FHTS)  offer  short  courses  in  communities  outside  Mal\u00e9  when  requested  by \ncommunities  and  when  there  are  resources  to  do  so.  At  present,  requests  to  FET  and  FHTS \nfrom atoll chiefs cannot all be met within their respective faculty budgets. Fees are charged for \nsome  courses  to  cover  learning  materials  and/or  training  delivery  costs.  CMS  short courses \nhave,  to  date,  enrolled  only  men;  FET  short  courses9  are  attended  mostly  by  men  while  both \nwomen and men attend FHTS courses. \n \n11. \nIn addition to MCHE, other government agencies are involved in training. The Centre for \nContinuing  Education  of  the  Ministry  of  Education  (MOE)  coordinates  and  implements \nnonformal  education  programs  in  the  Maldives.  The  Centre  for  Continuing  Education's \nCondensed  Education  Program  has  achieved  considerable  success  in  providing  basic \neducation  for  adults  previously  unable  to  complete  primary  school.  Other  programs  include \nEnglish language courses, vocational and technical skills development courses, secretarial skills \ndevelopment courses, training in early childhood care and development, population education, \nand  community  awareness  through  materials  production  and  publications.  The  Ministry  of \nFisheries,  Agriculture  and  Marine  Resources  conducts  agriculture-  and  fisheries-related skills \ntraining.  The  Ministry  of  Youth  and  Sports  offers  a  variety  of  training  activities for youths, for \nexample,  sports-coaching,  dressmaking,  and  hairdressing,  in  addition  to  offering  sports  and \nrecreational programs in its youth centers. The Ministry of Human Resources, Employment and \nLabor (MHREL) has a loan scheme to fund skills training. \n \n12. \nAs  of  November  2002,  66  private  training  providers  were  registered  with  Ministry  of \nEducation.10  The  majority  offer  computer  instruction  and  are  located  in  Mal\u00e9.  Accurate \nenrollment data on trainees are unavailable. In addition to private education and training firms, \nmany  employers  provide  in-house  training  programs  and  courses  for  their  employees.  Larger \nfirms  provide  scholarships  and  support  the  education  and  professional  development  of \nemployees.  The  contribution  of  private  enterprise  to  skills  training  is  significant;  however,  no \n\n                                                 \n8  The majority of Center for Maritime Services  courses are less than 6 months. \n9  Courses include masonry and electrical wiring. \n10 In  Mal\u00e9,  there  are  27  software  application  training  providers.  On  islands  other  than  Mal\u00e9  there are 29 computer \n\ntraining providers. Ten private providers focus on language and other training services. \n\n\f30\n\nAppendix 2 \n\nqualitative and quantitative data are available on the number of trainees or financial investment \nin on-the-job training and professional development.  \n  \n13.  With the establishment of the Maldives  Accreditation Board (MAB) and the introduction \nof  the  Maldives  National  Qualifications  Framework,  the  mechanism  now  exists  for  greater \nrecognition of private sector participation in education and training. However, there is currently \nno mechanism in place for MAB to deal with technical and vocational credentials that require a \nsystem of occupational qualification standards.  \n \n14. \nLabor Regulations. Labor regulations and standards have to be updated and effectively \nimplemented  to  encourage  employers  to  employ  Maldivians  and  to  encourage  Maldivians  to \nseek  and  stay  in  employment.  There  is  a  need  for  a  systematic  approach  to  monitor  the \nimplementation  of  labor  legislation  and  strengthen  the  capacity  of  MHREL  for  effective  labor \nadministration and labor market analysis to help workers and employers alike. \n \nThe  Maldives  has  an  Employment  Regulation  but  no  labor  law.11  A  draft  Employment \n15. \nAct,  prepared  with  the  technical  assistance  of  the  International  Labour  Organization,  was \nsubmitted by MHREL to the Law Commission and now needs to be submitted to the Cabinet for \ntheir recommendation to submit it to Parliament. Employment contracts are mandatory for both \nlocally engaged workers and all expatriate employees. The salaries and benefits of employment \nin the Maldives, as well as other working conditions such as working hours, are determined by \nnegotiations between employer and prospective employee, without any minimum standard set \nand  monitored  by  the  Government.  There  is  no  minimum  wage.  MHREL  issues work permits, \nmonitors  the  expatriate  quota  system,  and  administers  fee  collection.  At  present,  insufficient \nresources are allocated for monitoring the implementation of the Employment Regulation.  \n \n16. \nEducation. As of 2002, almost half of the population (46%) was under 15 years of age. \nProvision of education to over one third of its population is by no means a minor challenge for a \ndeveloping country like the Maldives, where students are scattered over 199 inhabited islands. \nDespite  this  fact,  as  of  2000,  all  children  in  the  Maldives  have  access  to  the  first  7  years  of \nformal schooling, one of the landmark achievements of the country. Current challenges include \nthe  expansion  of  secondary  education  and  improving  the  quality  of  education.  Free,  public \neducation in the Maldives comprises 12 grades. Primary education is from grades 1 to 7, lower \nsecondary education is grades 8 to 10, and higher secondary education is grades 11 to 12.  \n \n17. \nSecondary  Education.  Enrollment  data  for  grade  8  in  2002  indicates  that  5,350 \nstudents  (36%)  of  those  enrolled  in  grade  7  the  previous  year  in  primary  schools  did  not \ncontinue  on  to  secondary  schooling,  mostly  students  in  the  atolls.  Secondary  schools  are \navailable in atoll capitals and in the larger islands with high population. Admission to secondary \nschool  requires  successful  completion  of  grade  7.  In  view  of  the  limited  number  of  secondary \nschools in the country, 74 secondary schools versus 452 primary schools, admission is limited \nby  the  availability  of  schools.  For  students  from  islands  with  no  secondary  schools,  access  is \nmade more difficult by the lack of affordable appropriate accommodation. The dropout rate from \nprimary to secondary grades is expected to decrease as more primary schools in the atolls are \nupgraded  to  secondary  schools.  From  29  schools  offering  secondary  education  in  1995,  there \nwere  74  in  2000.  Regardless,  the  number  of  youths  unable  to  go  on  beyond  grade  7  to \nsecondary education remains significant. \n \n\n                                                 \n11 The existing Employment Regulation of the Republic of Maldives came into effect on 1 January 1994. \n\n\f                                                                                                                                                         Appendix 2 \n\n31\n\nThe  secondary  school  system offers three streams: arts, commerce, and science. The \n18. \ncurriculum  includes  vocational-oriented  subjects  in  the  areas  of  tourism  and  fisheries.  Most  of \nthe secondary schools, especially those in the outer islands, offer the commerce stream, which \nrequires fewer resources. As a consequence, most secondary school completers are in the area \nof  commerce  and  lack  the  knowledge  required  in  further  science-oriented  programs.12  The \nofficial medium of instruction is English. At the end of grade 10, students typically sit for O-level \nexaminations.  The  pass  rate  in  most  subjects,  including  English,13 mathematics, and science, \nhowever, is less than 50%. In 2001, 73% of secondary school teachers were expatriates. As of \n2002,  four  schools  offered  higher  secondary  education,  two  of  which  were  located  in  Mal\u00e9. \nThus, among those with O-levels qualifications, many are unable to go on to higher secondary \nschool. \n \nPostsecondary  Education.  MCHE  was  established  in  1998  to  consolidate  the \n19. \nadministrative responsibility  for  seven  ministry-specific  training  institutes.  The  objective  is  to \nincrease  the  national  capacity  to  provide  postsecondary  education  and  training  to  meet  the \nhuman resource development needs of the Maldives. MCHE has six faculties and two centers, \nnamely,  Faculty  of  Health  Sciences,  FHTS,  Faculty  of  Management  and  Computing  Science, \nFaculty  of  Education,  FET,  and  Faculty  of  Shariah  and  Law.  The  centers  are  the  Center  for \nOpen Learning and CMS. The six faculties are housed in separate buildings throughout  Mal\u00e9.14 \nFive  regional  facilities,  formerly  known  as  the  Regional  Youth  Vocational  Training  Centers  are \nunder FET\u2019s administration.  \n \n20. \nIn 2002, MCHE offered programs of varying duration and admission requirements. Long-\nterm  courses  ranged  from  certificate  to  bachelor  degree  courses  with  most  requiring  two  or \nthree O-level  passes.15 MCHE\u2019s enrollment in long-term courses increased from 1,473 in 1999 \nto 1,731 in 2002. Enrollment in short-courses rose from 1,727 in 1999 to 2,565 in 2002. Most of \nthe short-term enrollment was with CMS.  \n \n21.  MCHE  is  presently  receiving  Asian  Development  Bank  assistance16  focused  on \ndeveloping diploma and advanced certificate courses through faculty development and course \nreviews, as well as program accreditation.  MCHE  is  restructuring  its  programs,  expanding  its \ncourse  offerings,  and  increasing  its  presence  in  the  country.  Curricula  are  being  updated  and \nrevised to meet the requirements of MAB.  \n\n                                                 \n12 Students completing the commerce stream wishing to pursue postsecondary studies in areas other than commerce \n\nhave to take a bridging course. \n\n13 The pass rate of English in 2002 was 6%. \n14 There is also an in-service center in Hithadhoo. \n15 For 2003, most of these entry requirements have been made less stringent, but still within the Maldives National \n\n16 ADB.1998.

The  purpose  of  each  ESC  is  to  provide  a  sustainable  mechanism  to  accurately \ndefine  the  immediate  and  future  demand  for  human  resources.  The  goal  is  to  reduce  the gap \nbetween  employer  demand  for  qualified  workers  and  the  supply  of  appropriately  qualified \nMaldivian labor.   \n \nA. \n  \n2. \nThe objectives of the ESCs are to: (i) increase efficiency and effectiveness of investment \nin employment-oriented training; (ii) identify policy issues impacting on labor market efficiency in \nthe  Maldives  and  to  engage  in  dialogue  with  Ministry  of  Human  Resources,  Employment  and \nLabor  to  achieve  resolution;  (iii) assist  in  developing  occupational  competency  standards  that \nwill  enable  the  Maldives  Accreditation  Board,  training  providers,  employers  and  individuals  to \ndescribe  the  knowledge,  skills  and  attitudes  required  to  effectively  function  in  various  sector-\nspecific occupations; (iv) recommend training and personnel  development that will enhance the \nfinancial  and  economic  efficiency  of  the  sector;  (v) enhance  the  value  of  the  labor  market \ninformation  system  by  providing  gender-disaggregated  data  on  categories  and  demand  for \nemployment; and (vi) provide information that will promote greater employment awareness and \nparticipation of women through improved social marketing and career guidance initiatives. \n \nB.  \n \nAs  a  representative  body  of  public  and  private  employers  and  employees  in  the  four \n3. \nsectors  of  the  economy,  each  ESC  will  consist  of  a  chairperson  selected  by  the  respective \nMinistry  and  eight  representatives  selected  from  private  and  public  firms.  A  minimum  of  two \nrepresentatives on each ESC will be female.  \n \n4. \nThe  ministry  or  ministries  responsible  for  each  sector  will  appoint  a  chairperson.  The \nESC for the social sector will be chaired by one person representing the Ministry of Health and \nthe  Ministry  of  Education.  The  chairperson  of  each  ESC  will  be  the  spokesperson  and  will \nprovide leadership for project activities. In consultation with the human resources development \nspecialist,  the  chairperson  for  each  sector  will  recruit  the  members  of  the  ESC.  The  selection \ncriteria  for  ESC  membership  require  each  member  to  have  a  minimum  of  5 years experience \nand  be  actively  working  or  otherwise  engaged  in  the  sector.  ESC  members  should  be \nconsidered by their peers to be knowledgeable, credible, and highly regarded for their work in \ndeveloping the sector.  \n \n5. \nEach ESC will consist of public and private representation at a ratio to be determined by \nthe  total  personnel  employed  by  private  firms  or  institutions  compared  to  the  total  personnel \nemployed  by  public  firms  or  institutions  within  the  respective  sector.  Representatives  will  be \nselected for the following categories of ESC membership: (i) one chairperson, recommended by \nthe  respective  ministry  or  ministries;  (ii) two  employer  representatives  from  Mal\u00e9  Region;         \n\nOrganization \n\n                                                 \n1  Social  sector  human  resources  development  employment  consists  of  public  and  private  education  and  health \n\ninstitutions.    \n\n\f34\n\nAppendix 4 \n\nFunctions \n\n(iii) one  employer  representative  from  the  Northern  Development  Region;  (iv) one  employer \nrepresentative from the Southern Development Region; (v) two employee representatives from \nMal\u00e9  Region;  (vi) one  employee  representative  from  the  Northern  Development  Region;  and \n(vii) one employee representative from the Southern  Development Region.   \n \nC. \n \n6. \nA central secretariat will provide the administrative and clerical support to the four ESCs. \nA  Human  Resource  Development  Training  Specialist  (HRDTS)  will  be  assigned  to  each  ESC. \nThe  duties  of  the  HRDTS  include  responsibility  for  ensuring  that  the  work  of  each  council  is \nachieved. The HRDTS will report to the project implementation unit.  The major activity of each \nESC is to prepare a human resource profile and strategy that includes an accurate description \nof  the  immediate  and  medium-term  employment  needs  of  the  sector.  The  identification  of \nworkforce  needs  will  be  the  basis  for  the  preparation  of  a  strategic  plan  describing  how  these \nneeds could be addressed.  \n \nAt the formative stages of the ESC, the frequency and duration of meetings is likely to be \n7. \ngreater than in subsequent years. Monthly meetings will be held in the first 6 months followed by \nquarterly meetings thereafter. ESC membership is voluntary and there is no remuneration or fee \npaid  for  member  participation  in  ESC  activities.  Out-of-pocket  costs,  including  travel  and \naccommodation,  for  attending  meetings  and  other  business  of  the  ESC  will  be  paid  by  the \nProject. In situations where employers are reluctant to authorize employee participation on the \nESC  because  of  the  salary  cost  to  the  firm,  reimbursement  of  the  cost  of  releasing  their \nemployee for ESC business will be provided by the Project.  \n \n8. \nThe strategic plans developed by each sector will include a history of the sector, specify \nthe current status of human resources, and forecast the trends and future needs. Action plans \nfocusing  on  critical  skills  shortages  will  be  developed  in  order  to  prioritize  training  and  staff \ndevelopment activities. Areas deemed to be in greatest need of qualified Maldivians will be the \nsubject of formal proposals from the ESC to the project steering committee.  \n \n9. \nEach ESC will identify people to serve on technical committees to prepare occupational \ntask analysis for key occupations. This will include the identification of occupations in the sector; \nthe  number  of  employers,  and  the  number  of  employees  by  category  and  gender;  local  or \nexpatriate; required credential; and a breakdown of duties, skills, and tasks associated with the \nselected  occupation.  Skill  and  task  definition  will  be  compiled  using  an  occupational  task \nanalysis  process  that  will  guide  curriculum  development  for  training  program  design  and \ndevelopment.  \n \n10. \nThe  strategic  human  resources  development  plan  developed  by  ESCs  will  identify  the \noccupations  in  which  skills  need  to  be  strengthened,  new  training  programs  introduced, \nemployability skills developed, expatriate replacement strategies established, and other human \nresources  development  issues  addressed.  The  plans  will  include  cooperative  strategies  to \nemploy  more  Maldivians  and  provide  feedback  on  the  quality  of  training  and  performance  of \ngraduates. ESCs will form a natural network of employers capable of providing information for \nthe  promotion  of  careers  in  their  sector  and  facilitating  processes  for  recruitment  and \nemployment of graduates.   \n \nIntroduction  of  this  new  employer  demand-driven  approach  will  require  time  for  the \n11. \nmerits  of  the  system  to  be  validated  and  embraced  by  employers,  training  providers  and \ngovernment.  It  is  expected  that  the  introduction  of  the  ESC  concept  will  stimulate  other \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n35\n\nImplementation and Sustainability  \n\ninitiatives  potentially  funded  from  resources  within  various  employment  sectors.  These  may \ninclude continued policy dialogue, increased support for work experience programs, introduction \nof initiatives promoting greater female participation in the workforce, supporting career guidance \nprograms, and developing workforce capacity to meet new quality standards. \n \nD.  \n \n12. \nThe  ESCs  play  a  key  role  identifying  the  employer  demand-driven  needs  to  ensure \nrelevance  of  training  programs  supplied  by  public  and  private  training  providers.  As  such,  the \nESCs  will  need  to  be  operational  from  the  start  of  project  implementation.  Identification  of \nrepresentatives for ESC membership could begin prior to the start of the project.  \n \nSustainability  of  the  ESC  process  may  be  possible  as  the  low  cost  of  participation \n13. \ncombined  with  reduced  frequency  of  meetings  following  5  years  of  operation  will  promote \nsustainability. The benefits of an effective ESC will be sufficient justification for their post-project \ncontinuity.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36\n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n\nFUNDING TRAINING: \nINDICATIVE OPERATIONS MANUAL  \n\nProject Overview \n\n \n \nA.  \n \n1. \nThe  Government  of  the  Maldives,  concerned  with  rising  unemployment,  particularly  in \nregions outside Mal\u00e9, has launched a program with Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance \nto  increase  opportunity  and  access  to  employment-oriented  education  and  training.  The \nproposed Project consists of three components designed specifically for youths, aged 16 to 34, \nand adults previously unable to continue their education or training.  \n \nFunds will be used to design, develop, and deliver competency-based training programs \n2. \nrelevant  to  the  identified  needs  of  the  economic  sector  for  which  the  programs  are  designed. \nThis includes support for developing occupational profiles, detailed occupational task analyses, \ncurriculum  design,  and  instructional  materials  development.  Partial  cost-recovery  of  the  funds \nawarded will be included in the contractual agreement for its award and use.   \n \n3. \nObjectives. The objectives of this project component are as follows: (i) provide financial \nresources  to  develop  and  deliver  employment-oriented  education  and  training  for  Maldivian \nyouth  to  develop  the  competencies,  qualifications,  and  attitudes  essential  for  employment; \n(ii) provide mechanisms to deliver training in locations relevant to the needs of the employer and \npotential  employee;  (iii) establish  procedures  to  monitor  and  evaluate  the  employment  and \nproductivity impact of the Project's interventions; (iv) assess the efficiency and effectiveness of \ncollaboratively  designed  training,  when  delivered  competitively  by  Maldives  College  of  Higher \nEducation, and other public and private providers; and (v) develop policies and procedures for \npartial  cost  recovery  of  funds  and  establishing  a  sustainable  financing  mechanism  for  skills \ntraining.   \n \n4. \nProject  Scope.  The  Project  will  provide  financial  support  for  the  preparation  of \nworkforce  occupational  profiles,  task  analyses,  skills  standards,  and  a  human  resource  (HR) \nstrategic plan for four key sectors, namely, tourism, fisheries and agriculture, transportation, and \nthe social sectors. The workforce profiles will identify the public and private employers currently \nactive  in  the  sector,  together  with  levels  of  employment  and  categories  of  employee listed by \nInternational  Standard  Occupational  Classification  (ISOC)  88  classification  codes,  and  provide \nindicative  information  regarding  individuals  engaged  in  informal  employment  in  the  sector. \nOccupational profiles will describe the principal tasks undertaken by each category of employee. \nThis information will be collected against a template to be provided by the project in a manner \nthat will support a \u201cdeveloping a curriculum\u201d (DACUM) process for subsequent training program \ndevelopment  initiatives.  Preparation  of  HR  strategic  plans  will  describe  the  employment \nenvironment in the sector, identify strategic issues, and formulate action plans to address critical \nskills shortages or skill gaps in individual occupations. The studies and analyses component will \nalso provide resources for capacity building among the employment sector councils (ESCs) and \ntheir membership in the process of writing competitive proposals for submission to the fund. \n \n5. \nThe  Project  supports  youth  and  adults  in  basic  skill  development  for  entry-level \nemployment.  It  is  also  possible  to  support  further  or  supplementary  training  of  existing \nemployees  in  order  to  close  critical  skills  gaps.  The  required  training  will  be  identified  by \nemployers and will be provided by Maldives College of Higher Education, existing public sector \ntraining providers, private sector providers, employers themselves, or any combination thereof. \n \n\n\fAppendix 5       37\n\nProject Management \n\nfunds  will  be  overseen  by \n\nInstitutional  Arrangements.  Project \n\nB.  \n \n6. \nthe  project \nimplementation  unit  (PIU).  Policy  and  administrative  decisions  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the \nproject steering committee (PSC). Funding policies will be prepared within the guidelines of the \nPSC.  \n \n7. \nProcurement.  Procurement  contracts  for  impact  assessment  studies  or  other  outputs \nwill be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Individual consultants \nmay  be  hired  to  supplement  the  capacity  of  the  PIU.  The  private  sector,  employers  and/or \nemployees, will be represented in the technical evaluation/selection committees.  \n \nDisbursement.  To  ensure  that  funds  are  readily  available  for  project  implementation \n8. \nand  to  facilitate  disbursement,  an  imprest  account  will  be  established.  Disbursements  will  be \nsupported  by  invoices  and  receipts  from  training  providers  or  suppliers.  Authorization  for \npayment  will  require  the  signatures  of  the  PIU  director  and  the  ESC  chairperson  to  whom  the \nservices are provided.  \n \n9. \nProject Workshop.  Project  funding  activities  will  be  launched  at  a  training  workshop, \nconvened following establishment of the ESCs. The training session will introduce the concepts \nand operational modalities. The workshop will be planned and designed in cooperation with the \nPIU  and  ESC  chairpersons,  and  the  staff  of  the  Maldives  Network  for  Employment  Training \n(MNET) executive director. Participants will include key stakeholders such as representatives of \nemployers, and public and private training providers. \n \nC. \n \n10. \nPriority activities eligible for project support include: (i) training for potential new entrants \nin  occupations  of  priority  need  as  identified  by  ESCs;  (ii) training  for  occupations  currently \noccupied by expatriates who will eventually be replaced by Maldivian employees as agreed by \nESCs  and  further  described  in  each  sector\u2019s  HR  strategic  plan;  (iii) training for occupations of \nfuture need as identified by national economic priorities; and (iv) training of individuals engaged \nin  the  informal  sector  to  enhance  income  generation  opportunities.  As  second  priority, \nassistance may also be extended to: (i) training undertaken on the job to enhance the efficiency \nof  existing  workers  within  a  particular  occupational  category  and  (ii) training  of  existing \nemployees off the job to develop new skills directly linked to employment. \n \n11. \nActivities not eligible for funding include: (i) long-term scholarships (1 year and longer), \n(ii) participation  in  conferences,  (ii) fees  for  external  examinations,  (iii) membership  fees  in \nprofessional  associations  or  societies,  and  (iv) other  expenditures  deemed  to  be  of  personal \nbenefit only to the applicant. \n \n12. \nAgencies  Eligible  for  Funding.  The  four  ESCs  representing  tourism,  fisheries  and \nagriculture,  transportation,  and  the  social  sectors  will  be  eligible  to  submit  proposals. \nCompanies and community groups, including the informal sector, who wish to participate in the \nprogram will process their proposals through the most appropriate ESC.  \n \n13. \nBeneficiaries of Supported Training. The proposed project will pilot activities in three \nregions,  namely  the  Northern  and  Southern  Development  Regions  and  Mal\u00e9  island  and \nadjacent  atolls.  Consequently,  a  higher  priority  will  be  given  to  proposals  that  provide  training \n\nActivities and Procedures \n\n\f38\n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n\nopportunities to residents of these regions. Women and men from all regions of the country will \nbe the eligible beneficiaries.  \n \n14. \nRequest  for  Proposals.  The  PIU  will  request  submission  of  proposals  for  training. \nESCs will be invited to submit up  to a maximum of five proposals per ESC annually. Proposals \nwill be evaluated against the criteria established and disseminated by the PSC. Contracts will be \nawarded to the ESCs based on the amount of money available for each round of funding.  \n \nProposal Content. Detailed guidelines for the preparation of proposals will be provided \n15. \nin the request for proposals. This will include as a minimum: (i) definition of the occupation for \nwhich training is to be provided; (ii) identification of employment demand, and details of member \ncompanies employing this category of employee; (iii) specific occupational competencies to be \nbuilt;  (iv) information  regarding  the  proposed  training  provider  and  rationale  for  selection; \n(v) details  of  the  proposed  training  program  and  individual  trainers;  (vi) course  or  training \nactivity, content and duration; (vii) trainee performance assessment approach; (viii) credential or \ncertificate to be awarded, if any; (ix) cost of the proposed training; amount requested from the \nProject  and  any  contribution,  direct  or  in  kind,  that  is  being  provided  by  the  ESC  and/or  its \nmembers;  (x) criteria  for  the  selection  of  candidates  for  training;  and  (xi) commitment  of  the \nCouncil  or  its  members  to  engage  graduates  upon  completion  of  training  and  under  what \nconditions.  ESCs  should  access  the  services  of  MNET  to  facilitate  occupational  analysis, \ndefinition  of  competencies,  DACUM  processes,  and  training  program  design  when  preparing \ntheir proposals for funding \n \n16. \nSelection  of  Projects  for  Funding.  The  PSC  will  evaluate  proposals  against  the \nfollowing  criteria:  (i) compliance  with  eligibility  criteria,  (ii) consistency  with  project  objectives, \n(iii) cost efficiency, and (iv) employment potential on completion of training. \n \nD. \n \n17. \nFinancial  Conditions.  The  maximum  total  amount  of  any  training  project  proposal \nshould  not  exceed  $50,000.  The  maximum  total  amount  to  be  financed  by  the  Project  for  any \nindividual trainee should not exceed $2,500. Employers may wish to group trainees for certain \nhigh-cost training (e.g., high-tech training or training provided by a foreign expert). The following \nitems  will  be  covered  by  the  financing:  (i) training  providers\u2019  fees  or  salary  (direct  or \nsubcontracted);  (ii) consumables  linked  to  training  such  as  materials,  video/audio  tapes, \nsoftware  etc.;  (iii) operating  cost  linked  to  training  such  as  rent,  utilities,  support,  etc.;  and       \n(iv) training  providers\u2019  travel  and  accommodation  directly  related  to  training program delivery. \nTrainees\u2019 salaries will be excluded from financing. \n \n18. \nContracting Procedures. Following proposal approval, the PIU will prepare a contract \nspecifying  the  responsibilities  of  each  party  including  the  ESC  and  the  firms  or  agencies \ninvolved  in  the  design,  development,  and  delivery  of  training.  The  contract  will  include  the \nfollowing  information:  (i) ESC  name,  (ii) names  of  the  beneficiaries  to  be  trained,  (iii) name of \ntraining provider, (iv) training program details, (v) details of any sub-agreements with private or \nexternal  training  providers,  (vi) training  program  costs,  (vii) qualification  to  be  awarded  upon \nsuccessful  completion  of  the  training,  and  (viii) obligations  of  all  parties  on  completion  of \ntraining. Contracts will be signed by the director of the PIU and the ESC chairperson.  \n \nPayment for Services. The training or service provider will submit claims for payment to \n19. \nthe PIU. The PIU will process the requested payment, provide authorization to claims complying \n\nFinancial and Contractual Arrangements \n\n\fAppendix 5       39\n\nMonitoring, Studies, and Evaluation \n\nwith  the  contractual  agreement,  and  authorize  payment.  The  PIU  will  verify  compliance  of \nprocedures and legitimacy of the claim prior to processing the payment. \n \nE. \n \n20.  Monitoring.  Monitoring  will  review  and  assess  the  implementation  of  the  technical \nprocedures,  in  particular:  (i) the  procedures  to  evaluate  proposals  submitted  by  ESCs,  (ii) the \nimplementation  of  training  programs,  and  (iii) the  proper  use  of  support  services  provided \nthrough  MNET  or  other  sources.  Monitoring  will  be  undertaken  through  two  types  of  review. \nAnnual operational reviews will analyze the previous year\u2019s technical performance and financial \nmanagement using monitoring indicators agreed to by ADB. The reviews will be in respect of all \noperations financed by the Project and will review actual project performance against the annual \nplan  of  operations  and  the  approved  budget  for  the  year.  Staff  of  the  PIU  will  carry  out  field \nreviews  targeted  at  specific  operations  financed  by  the  fund.  These  reviews  will  monitor,  in \ndepth,  a  limited  number  of  training  projects  as  well  as  information  and  support  services.  Field \nreviews will focus on qualitative analysis of selected projects and services. \n \n21. \nSpecific performance indicators will be  developed including: (i) the percentage of funds \nallocated  to  public  providers,  private  providers,  or  employer-provided  training,  in  order  to \nindicate  the  competition  between  the  sectors;  (ii) unit  costs  of  training  courses  or  projects, \nadjusted for length of course and inputs, in order to provide a measure of cost-effectiveness of \ntraining  provided;  (iii) the  number  and  socioeconomic  profile  of  trainees;  and  (iv) post-training \nemployment experience of trainees including employment characteristics and wage levels. \n \nFull  details  of  the  monitoring  activities  will  be  agreed  upon  with  the  PIU  and  finalized \n22. \nthrough consulting services to be provided to the project. Account will need to be taken of the \nease  with  which  information  can  be  collected,  and  the  ability  to  manipulate  and  collate  the \ninformation. Records to be maintained include statistics on a range of information. On employer \napplicants  and  beneficiaries,  information  will  be  collected  on  employer  groups  applying  for \nsupport  and  will  include  the  type  of  industry,  number  of  employees,  product,  or  service, \ngeographic  location  and  other  details.  From  training  providers,  information  to  be  collected  will \ninclude, ownership, public or private, size, course, and cost details. Information will be collected \non  all  trainees  and  will  include  demographic  data,  skills/education  prior  to  training,  family, \ngeographic  information,  occupation,  or  skill  training  provided  and  income  details.  Financial \nrecords  will  be  maintained  by  the  PIU  for  purposes  of  audit,  analysis  and  reporting.  Review \nactivities  will  be  conducted.  Training  providers  will  be  required  to  submit  reports  on  their \nactivities at the completion of each course or training project. Information will be collected and \nmaintained on extent of on the job training provided, details of training, attrition, etc. \n \n23. \nEvaluation.  Evaluation  will  be  undertaken  by  the  PIU  monitoring  and  evaluation  unit \nthrough the mechanism of tracer and impact assessment studies. From employers, studies will \naddress  the  effectiveness  of  project  operations  in  terms  of  identifying  the  occupational \ncompetencies  required  by  employees,  providing  training  program  development  services, \nidentifying  appropriate  candidates  for  training  and  providing  training  programs  to  prepare \ncandidates  for  employment.  On  trainees,  studies  will  assess  the  short-  and  medium-term \noutcomes of the training programs financed by the Project in terms of employment opportunities \ngenerated, earnings for the beneficiaries, regional distribution, retention rates after employment, \nand other relevant factors.  \n\n\f40\n\nAppendix 6 \n\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS \n \nTable A6.1: Cost Estimates \n($\u2019000) \n \n\n \nComponent \nA.

During the same time period, the number of Maldivians in the labor force grew by 5% \nannually  while  the  number  of  expatriate  workers  increased  8%  per  year.  The  economy  of  the \nMaldives is expected to continue growing. Between 2004 and 2007, annual real gross domestic \nproduct  growth  is  forecast  to  average  between  6.2%  and  2.6%.  As  the  economy  continues  to \nexpand,  more  trained  people  will  be  required;  in  the  absence  of  locally  available  qualified  and \ntrained  labor,  expatriate  workers  are  hired  to  fill  the  gap.  This  is  against  the  backdrop  of \nuntapped human resources, i.e., the large number of youths who are not in the labor force, who \nhave completed primary education but could not continue on to further education, and who are \ncapable but have limited access to skills training programs. Additionally, the Maldives is already \nheavily  dependent  on  imported  merchandise,  and  the  employment  of  expatriate  workers \ncontributes to the further deterioration of its current account balance.   \n \n2. \nGovernment  intervention  in  skills  training,  either  in  provision  and/or  financing,  is \nrationalized  on  the  grounds  of  market  imperfections,  externalities,  and  equity.1  Public  policy, \ne.g.,  employment  regulations,  may  unintentionally  distort  the  cost  and  benefit  stream  of  skills \ntraining such that less training than required by economic development would take place. The \navailability  of  skilled  labor  would  contribute  to  meeting  the  macroeconomic  goals  of  a  country, \nnotably  addressing  balance-of-payments  problems  and  retention  of  foreign  exchange  and \navailability of semi-skilled human resources.     \n \n3. \nThe  Project  will  focus  on  delivering  training  in  four  key  sectors\u2014tourism, fisheries and \nagriculture,  transport,  and  the  social  sectors\u2014that  are  included  in  the  national  development \npriority and play an important role in the continued economic well-being of the country. Tourism \nis mainly a private sector activity, a major employment sector, and the major source of foreign \nexchange revenue. Tourism also employs many expatriate workers, ranging from the skilled to \nthe unskilled. In the fisheries sector, two fishing zones have been opened up for private sector \ninvestment and will require more workers in the near future. The development of agriculture is \nimportant to national food security. Transportation is an extremely important and growing sector \nsupporting both tourism and the fisheries. An international airport will soon be operational in the \nsouthern region. The social sector, consisting primarily of education and health, is critical to the \nwell-being of the population and is currently heavily reliant on expatriate employment. \n \n4. \nThe  economic  justification  of  the  Project  derives  mainly  from  increased  access  to \ntraining programs that are relevant to the needs of the labor market. About  6,000 trainees will \nbe  trained  during  the  life  of  the  Project  by  supporting  the  development  and  delivery  of  more \ntraining  programs  that  are  employment-oriented  and  are  competency-based  in  the  four  key \nsectors.  Depending  on  trainees\u2019  capacity  to  pay,  the  demand  for  the  training  program, \nemployment  prospects,  and  the  remuneration  of  related  jobs,  students  may  be  requested  to \nshare in the costs. Fees are already being charged for some short-term courses at the Maldives \nCollege  of  Higher  Education  faculties  and  center  to  cover  learning  materials  and/or  training \ndelivery  costs.  Trainees  may  also  incur  out-of-pocket  costs  to  pay  for  their  transportation, \nsubsistence,  and  accommodation,  where  applicable.  Trainees  will  mostly  be  drawn  from  the \n\n                                                 \n1  Lauglo,  L.,  A.  Akyeampong,  K.  Mwiria,  and  S.  Weeks.  December  2002.

The \noccupations where positions may be available and the number of people that may be sought in \nthe  four  sectors  of  the  Project  are  indicated  in  Table  A12.  Many  required  occupations  are  not \nunique to a sector, e.g., office clerks and refrigeration technicians. \n \n6. \nIndicative Economic Rate of Return. The Project\u2019s indicative economic rate of return is \n33%.  The  main  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  are  the  unemployed  out-of-school  youths.  The \nProject  will  train  about  6,000  youths.  In  view  of  the  lack  of  information  relating  to  trainees\u2019 \nplacement,  several  assumptions  were  made.  About  half  of  the  trainees  would  be  able  to  find \nemployment  in  the  year  following  the  completion  of  their  training.  As  the  economy  of  the \nMaldives  diversifies  and  more  jobs  are  created,  trainees  may  want  to  re-train  and  switch \noccupations  to  earn  higher  salaries  or  work  in  islands  closer  to  their  home-islands;  thus, \ntrainees  are  assumed  to  be  in  the  training-program-related employment for 5 years. Trainees\u2019 \nmonthly  salary  is  assumed  at  Rf2,000  per  month.  Sample  salary  data  collected  during  project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  from  the  tourism  sector  indicate  that waiters earn Rf1,200 to \nRf2,000, and maintenance personnel, Rf1,500 to Rf4,000. Trainees\u2019 out-of-pocket training costs \nare  estimated  at  Rf1,500  per  month,  which  includes  transportation,  accommodation,  and \nsubsistence  that  may  likely  be  incurred  if  training  were  offered  in  another  island.  The  average \nlength of training programs is about 3 months. The discount rate is 12%. Sensitivity was tested \nby increasing costs and benefits by 20%; the Project remains economically justified under these \nconditions. \n  \nB.  \n \n7. \nThe Government\u2019s share in the project is estimated at $1.5 million over 5 years and will \nconsist mainly of the incremental recurrent cost of $1.0 million and share in special programs of \n$0.3 million. Two scenarios were prepared to analyze its affordability (i) a \u201chigh\u201d scenario where \nthe  education  budget  was  projected  based  on  the  actual  expenditure  from  1995  to  2001;  and \n(ii) a  \u201clow\u201d  scenario  where  the  education  budget  remains  the  same  from  2002  onward.  Under \nboth  scenarios,  the  Government\u2019s  share  in  the  both  the  project  and  recurrent  costs  are \naffordable. \n \n8. \nThe  annual  share  of  the  Government  in  the  project  cost  was  compared  to  the  annual \neducation budget (high scenario) for the years 2004 to 2009. The Government\u2019s annual share \nas a percentage of the education budget ranges from 0.3% to 0.6%, averaging 0.5% over the 5-\nyear life of the Project. The Government\u2019s share in the recurrent cost was also compared to the \neducation recurrent budget for 2004 to 2009. The Government\u2019s share as a percentage of the \neducation  recurrent  budget  averaged  0.3%  over  the  life  of  the  project.  From  the  sixth  year \nonward,  after  the  project  implementation  has  ended,  the  Government  will  assume  about \n$97,000 annually for the incremental recurrent cost, which will have to be incurred as a result of \nproject interventions. This amount is only 0.2% of the projected education recurrent budget for \nthat  year.  Hence  the  Government  share  in  both  the  project  and  recurrent  cost  are  deemed \naffordable. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n55\n\nTable A12: Estimated Indicative Training Needs by Occupation \n\nOccupation \n \n\n \n \n1  Accountant \n2  Bookkeeper  \n3  Cashier  \n4  Office Clerk \n5  Storekeeper \n6  Driver (Passenger Car and Van)  \n7  Driver (Truck) \n8  Refrigeration Repair Technician  \n9  Air Conditioning Repair Technician \n10  Computer Networking Technician  \n11  Carpenter \n12  Electrician  \n13  Plumber \n14  Painter \n15  Mechanic (Automobile)  \n16  Mechanic (Marine) \n17  Generator Operator / Repair  \n18  Water Treatment Operator / Repair \n19  Fiberglass Boat Building and Repair  \n20  Gas Welding and Cutting  \n21  Electric Welding and Fabrication \n22  Radio Communication Technician \n23  Maintenance Supervisor \n24  Housekeeping Attendant \n25  Housekeeping Supervisor \n26  Waiter / Waitress \n27  Food and Beverage Supervisor \n28  Front Office Operations \n29  Tour Guide  \n30  Chef  \n31  Cook \n32  Pastry / Bakery Chef  \n33  Sports Facilities Attendant \n34  Sports Coach \n35  Boat Captain  \n36  Security Guard (Airport) \n37  Security Guard (General)  \n38  Logistics Clerk \n39  Customs Broker \n40  Gardener \n41  Fish Processing Operator \n42  Fish Quality Control Inspector \n43  Extension Worker \n44  School Office Clerk \n45  Hospital Housekeeping  \n46  Nurses Aide \n47  Hospital Records Clerk \n48  Hospital Orderly \n49  Hospital Translator  \n50  Hospital Ward Clerk  \n\nTotal \n\nM  \n\nTourism \nF \n100 \n100 \n100 \n75 \n25 \n50 \n25 \n10 \n10 \n25 \n10 \n10 \n10 \n25 \n0 \n10 \n5 \n5 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n10 \n10 \n100 \n100 \n200 \n100 \n100 \n25 \n50 \n500 \n200 \n25 \n50 \n0 \n0 \n50 \n5 \n0 \n50 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n2,170 \n\n50 \n50 \n25 \n25 \n25 \n50 \n25 \n50 \n25 \n25 \n100 \n100 \n100 \n100 \n0 \n50 \n25 \n25 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n50 \n50 \n50 \n50 \n200 \n100 \n100 \n25 \n50 \n300 \n100 \n25 \n50 \n0 \n0 \n100 \n50 \n0 \n50 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n2,200 \n\nTransport \nF \nM \n100 \n50 \n25 \n50 \n15 \n25 \n15 \n10 \n5 \n25 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n10 \n50 \n10 \n0 \n0 \n10 \n5 \n5 \n10 \n10 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n10 \n25 \n25 \n10 \n50 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n550 \n\n50 \n25 \n10 \n25 \n15 \n25 \n15 \n25 \n25 \n25 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n25 \n150 \n100 \n0 \n0 \n50 \n25 \n25 \n50 \n50 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n50 \n50 \n50 \n100 \n50 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n1,015 \n\nSocial \n\nFisheries \nM \nF \n25 \n50 \n25 \n25 \n10 \n20 \n25 \n50 \n10 \n10 \n25 \n25 \n10 \n10 \n25 \n10 \n25 \n5 \n25 \n25 \n0 \n0 \n25 \n5 \n5 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n100 \n5 \n25 \n0 \n25 \n0 \n25 \n5 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n50 \n10 \n25 \n5 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n50 \n10 \n0 \n0 \n50\n0 \n100\n10 \n25 \n25 \n50 \n50 \n50 \n50 \n50 \n50 \n50 \n50 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n910 \n505 \n\nF \n50 \n50 \n50 \n50 \n50 \n10 \n50 \n10 \n5 \n25 \n5 \n5 \n10 \n25 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n10 \n0 \n25 \n0 \n0 \n100 \n0 \n0 \n50 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n25 \n10 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n  200 \n   100 \n    100 \n    100 \n    100 \n    100 \n     50 \n      50 \n1,415 \n\nM \n\nTotal \nF+M \n450 \n25 \n350 \n25 \n265 \n25 \n325 \n25 \n175 \n25 \n215 \n5 \n200 \n50 \n165 \n25 \n110 \n10 \n200 \n25 \n125 \n10 \n155 \n10 \n150 \n25 \n235 \n50 \n200 \n0 \n275 \n0 \n55 \n0 \n55 \n0 \n90 \n0 \n30 \n0 \n30 \n0 \n180 \n0 \n210 \n50 \n150 \n0 \n200 \n25 \n400 \n0 \n200 \n0 \n325 \n25 \n50 \n0 \n100 \n0 \n900 \n50 \n300 \n0 \n50 \n0 \n100 \n0 \n120 \n0 \n75 \n0 \n350 \n50 \n335 \n50 \n150 \n0 \n200 \n0 \n100 \n0 \n100 \n0 \n500 \n200 \n150 \n      50 \n150 \n      50 \n150 \n      50 \n150 \n      50 \n150 \n      50 \n75 \n      25 \n75 \n      25 \n1,085  9,850 \n\nF = female, M = male. \nSources:  Project  preparatory  technical  assistance  participatory  planning  meetings;  interviews;  focus  groups;  Maldives \nAssociation  for  Tourism  Industry;  Ministry  of  Human  Resources,  Employment  and  Labor;  Ministry  of  Planning  and \nNational Development; Ministry of Education; and Ministry of Youth and Sports.    \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 12 \n\nIn  the  low-growth  scenario,  the  Government\u2019s  annual  share  as  a  percentage  of  the \n9. \neducation  budget  ranged  from  0.4%  to  0.8%,  and  averaged  0.7%  over  the  5-year  life  of  the \nproject.

Participation  of  Maldivians  in  the  economic  development  process  by  being \nemployed  allows  for  their  sharing  in  the  benefits  of  economic  growth.  Employment  is  a  sustainable \napproach to poverty reduction. Training programs supported by the Project will be offered not only in Mal\u00e9 \nand adjacent atolls but also in islands in the Northern and Southern Development regions where the more \nvulnerable Maldivians live. \n\nB. \n\nPoverty Analysis                                                     Proposed Classification Poverty Intervention \n\n \nThe Mission relied on statistics, studies, and reports by the Government, Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nUnited  Nations  Development  Program  (UNDP),  and  the  World  Bank.  Relevant  statistics  were  analyzed \nfrom  the  2000  Population  and  Housing  Census  data  of  the  Government.  ADB  published  Poverty \nReduction  in  the  Maldives  in  2002  and  the  Maldives  Gender  Briefing  Paper,  and  UNDP  produced \nVulnerability  and  Poverty  Assessment  1998.  The  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  team  also \ncollected  information  through  the  focus  group  discussions  and  participatory  workshops  held  in  various \nislands in the country. \n\nThe human development index for Maldives in 2001 is 0.739, ranking it 77th out of  162 countries, and the \ngender development index, at 0.735, is second only to that of Sri Lanka in South Asia. 1 High and rising per \ncapita income masks significant income disparities among the 270,000 Maldivians. The 1998 vulnerability \nand  poverty  assessment  (VPA)2  estimated  per  capita  household  income  for  the  atoll  population  at  only \n$647 per year. As many as 42% of Maldivians live on less than $1.17 per day while 22% subsist on $0.83 \nper  day.  Significant  differences  exist  between  Mal\u00e9  and  the  atolls  in  terms  of  access  to  services  and \ninfrastructure,  including  health,  sanitation,  water,  and  education.  Some  islands  have  made  considerable \nstrides  because  of  their  close  proximity  to  tourism  zones.  Other  islands  have  no  such  advantage  and  are \nbarely accessible. Taking income as an example, disparities between Mal\u00e9 and the atolls have been found \nto  be  in  the  order  of  2:1,  with  the  ratio  increasing  to  3:1  when  the  lowest  average  per  capita  income  was \nconsidered.  For  access  to  social  and  physical  infrastructure  and  services,  inequalities  are  far  more \npronounced,  averaging  4:1  between  the  capital  and  the  atolls.  This  is  a  challenge  that  the  Government \nhas  sought  to  address  since  the  1970s,  which  today  has  resulted  in  policy  initiatives  to  develop  growth \ncenter  islands  in  five  regions  to  reduce  disparities  in  access  to  essential  services  between  Mal\u00e9  and  the \natolls.  The  Project  builds  on  the  ongoing  ADB-financed  Regional  Development  Project  by  including  its \nfocus regions in the Project\u2019s focus regions. Training programs will be offered not only in Mal\u00e9 but also in \nthe  islands.  Community  training  initiatives  will  address  the  needs  of  the  smaller  islands  that  have  less \naccess to training programs and formal employment. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n                                                 \n1  United Nations Development Programme.

During  project  implementation, \nparticipatory processes will be developed to involve relevant stakeholders and to identify human resources \ndevelopment needs in different sectors, and design competency-based skills training programs. The social \nmarketing  program  will  include  popular  media  and  participatory  process  to  motivate  female  and  male \nyouths,  and  women,  and  to  reach  out  to  trainees  from  the  poor  and  remote  islands.  Training  delivery  will \nemploy techniques based on the principles and practices of learner-focused adult education.  \n \nD.         Gender and Development \n\nStrategy to maximize impacts on women:    \n \nThe Government is committed to increasing the role of women in the society and economy. Vision 2020 of \nthe Government targets gender equity, with the  active participation of men and women in political, social, \nand  economic  activities,  which  is  also  one  of  the  key  social  priorities  of  the  Sixth  National  Development \nPlan.  There  is  no  institutional  discrimination  along  gender  lines  in  access  to  primary  and  secondary \neducation. School enrolment rates for girls and boys are almost same, and, in 2002, there were more girls \nthan  boys  in  Mal\u00e9  and  the  atolls  in  secondary  school.  Many  women  are  employed  in  the  public  sector, \nincluding  in  education  and  health  servi ces. However, women\u2019s labor force participation rate (32%) is less \nthan men\u2019s (62%).  \n \nThe Project aims to increase number of skilled Maldivian youths actively participating in the labor force by \nincreasing  access  to  quality  competency-based  skills  training  and  social  marketing  and  career  guidance, \namong others. The client group of the Project includes young men and women between 15 and 34 years \nold.   \n \nThe Project will develop mechanisms for equal access to training by men and women and would address \ngender  disparity  in  the  labor  market  through  the  career  guidance  and  employment  services  training \nprogram.
