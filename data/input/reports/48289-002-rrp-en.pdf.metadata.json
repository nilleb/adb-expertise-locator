THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Peshawar Sustainable Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Corridor \nProject. The report also describes the proposed partial administration of a loan to be provided by \nthe Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) for the Peshawar Sustainable BRT Corridor \nProject, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, approve the administration of the loan. \n \n2.  The proposed project will help develop a sustainable urban transport system in Peshawar \nby delivering the city\u2019s first integrated BRT corridor, directly benefiting 0.5 million people.1 The \nproject will comprise two interlinked outputs: (i) the construction of a 26-kilometer (km) BRT \ncorridor and associated facilities, and (ii) effective project management and sustainable BRT \noperations through institutional developments. The project is economically justified by major time \nsavings for future BRT passengers, vehicle operating cost savings, better air quality, and carbon \nemissions savings, which will improve the health of Peshawar\u2019s citizens and mitigate climate \nchange. The project will also make Peshawar more livable and safe, boost private sector \ninvestment, and foster gender equity. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Background and issues. Peshawar is the capital city of the northwest province of Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa in Pakistan. A 2-hour drive from the national capital of Islamabad, Peshawar sits in \nthe Indus valley near the Afghan border. Although the last census was conducted in 1998, the \ncity\u2019s population was estimated at 1.8 million in 2016, and is projected to reach 3.0 million by 2030 \nbased on current growth rates. Internal displacement and Afghan refugee migration has driven \nrapid population growth, and there is significant pressure to maintain infrastructure development \nand service provision in accordance with the growing demand for housing, transport and basic \nurban services. Car and motorcycle ownership remains low but is increasing due to a growing \nmiddle class. Combined with other factors such as inefficient public transport and weak traffic \nmanagement  to  organize  competing  modes,  motorization  is  exacerbating  congestion  and \nincreasing air and noise pollution.2 Traffic conditions on key arterial roads have declined to \nunmanageable levels, with average peak hour travel speeds as low as 11 km per hour.3 No \nnotable  investment  in  public  transport  has  occurred  in  decades.  In  contrast,  recent  large \ninvestments in various flyovers reflect the prioritization of private road transport. Due to its limited \ninfrastructure, the city\u2019s urban transport system fails to provide mobility for all. \n \n4.  Poverty is widespread in Peshawar, with an incidence of 40%. The unemployment rate is \nabout 10% for men but 90% for women, who have fewer opportunities to achieve economic \nindependence. The poorest people and women travel mostly on foot or via informal public \ntransport mainly comprising pickup trucks and large and medium-sized buses from the 1980s and \n1990s. Altogether, these vehicles serve around 70% of the total demand for motorized transport, \nbut represent only 43% of total traffic. In response to the high market demand, many operators \n                                                \n1  An estimated 519,000 people (29% of Peshawar\u2019s total population) live within 1 km from a BRT station and would \npotentially benefit from this system. \n2 The environmental impact assessment measured average concentrations of particulate matter of less than 10 \nmicrometers  at  138\u2013184  micrograms  per  cubic  meter  in  five  locations  along  the  BRT  corridor.  The  level \nrecommended by the World Health Organization is 20 micrograms per cubic meter. \n3  Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and ADB. 2016. Peshawar BRT Project: Preliminary Design Report. desMobi: \nJakarta. ", "2 \nwithout permits are plying the city\u2019s key corridors in a disorganized and inefficient manner. There \nis no effective public oversight of supply and demand or of the quality of public transport vehicles, \nbus stops are rudimentary and lack schedule and itinerary information, the ticketing system is \nobsolete, and operators compete for passengers, worsening congestion and impairing safety. The \nincidence of traffic collisions is increasing, mainly affecting pedestrians, and 84% of surveyed \npassengers complain about crowded and unsafe conditions during the rush period and the \nimproper behavior of drivers and conductors. Public security also determines how residents move \naround and interact in the city, as all residents are affected by the threat of terrorism which \nremains a concern in Peshawar as well as in other major cities in the country. A well-designed, \nsafe and accessible public transport system in Peshawar would therefore substantially benefit the \nurban poor and women. \n \n5.  Project preparation. In May 2014, the Cities Development Initiative for Asia completed a \nprefeasibility study to improve Peshawar\u2019s urban transport system.4 The Asian Development \nBank (ADB) subsequently provided technical assistance to prepare Peshawar\u2019s BRT corridor.5 \nADB also approved a $10 million project design advance (PDA) loan from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources (OCR) in November 2016 to (i) prepare detailed engineering design, and the BRT \nbusiness model and operational plan; (ii) facilitate project communication; (iii) build capacity; and \n(iv) undertake advance procurement for civil works and equipment.6  \n \n6.  Alignment with country strategy. The project is consistent with the Government of \nPakistan\u2019s Vision 2030, Framework for Economic Growth, and National Climate Change Policy. \nIt supports the priorities set out in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Integrated Development Strategy \n2014\u20132018, and is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy and Sustainable Transport \nInitiative.7 The project design includes lessons from past assistance, notably the need for strong \npolitical consensus, and a robust governance structure. Coordination with development partners \nhas been ensured, particularly with expected cofinanciers such as the AFD and European \nInvestment Bank (EIB). Private sector participation is being considered for the BRT operations \n(para. 20), but not for construction as globally few mass transit systems recover their capital costs \nthrough revenues alone, especially as fares must be affordable and socially acceptable.  \n \n7.  ADB\u2019s assistance to the project adds value via the following: \n(i)  Organizational and institutional developments. ADB supported the legislation \nfor (a) the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Mass Transit Ordinance, which established the \nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa Urban Mobility Authority (KPUMA) and was approved in \nSeptember 2016; and (b) a special purpose vehicle called TransPeshawar, which \nwas licensed in December 2016.8 The KPUMA is responsible for developing \npolicies and regulations, and planning, coordinating, and funding urban transport \nat the provincial level. TransPeshawar will own the BRT infrastructure and assets, \nand is responsible for the BRT operations and management of service contracts. \n(ii)  Project design and innovation. ADB\u2019s intervention resulted in innovative design \nfeatures such as (a) the promotion of nonmotorized transport through universal \n                                                \n4  Cities Development Initiative for Asia. 2014.

ADB  promoted  a  third-\ngeneration BRT system using a \u201cdirect service\u201d operational model allowing BRT \nvehicles to travel along the BRT corridor in the busiest parts of the city and off-\ncorridor in less congested areas. This approach expands the system\u2019s reach and \ncapacity,  lessens  passenger  transfers,  and  increases  ridership  and  financial \nsustainability. The project was designed primarily to limit required operational \nsubsidies,  and  create  additional  sources  of  revenue  through  parking  and \ncommercial activities. \n(iv)  Stakeholder  engagement  and  bus  industry  transition.  ADB  strongly \nemphasizes  engagement  with  the  existing  bus  industry,  and  established  a \nnegotiation process enabling existing operators to participate in the new BRT \nsystem. The project design includes a fleet scraping program and compensation \nmechanism for nonparticipating operators. A large stakeholder engagement and \nparticipation plan is also being implemented to ensure buy-in from the communities \nimpacted by the project. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) a safe, affordable, comfortable, and \nenvironment-friendly transport system in Peshawar achieved; and (ii) quality of life in Peshawar \nimproved. The project will have the following outcome: quality of public transport in Peshawar \nimproved, benefiting 0.5 million of the city\u2019s inhabitants.9 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n9.  Output 1: Peshawar\u2019s first sustainable bus rapid transit corridor and associated \nfacilities constructed. The 26 km BRT corridor will be restructured over its entire width (\u201cfa\u00e7ade-\nto-fa\u00e7ade\u201d), including (i) 31 BRT stations and dedicated lanes built in the median, mainly at-grade \nwith a 4 km elevated section in the city center, and tunnel or trench sections at junctions; (ii) up \nto three mixed-traffic lanes improved in each direction in wider sections; (iii) bicycle lanes added \nand sidewalks and streetlights improved all along the corridor; (iv) on-street parking and green \nareas added in various locations; and (v) drainage improved to climate-proof the corridor. The \nBRT infrastructure will be completed with two depots and one staging facility, including park-and-\nride facilities and commercial areas, and 100 off-corridor bus stops. An office building will be built \nat the east depot to house the KPUMA and TransPeshawar offices and the BRT control center. \nA parking plaza will also be constructed in the precinct of the Lady Reading Hospital in the city \ncenter to promote modal shift from private vehicles to the BRT.  \n \n10.  Output  2:  Effective  project  management  and  sustainable  bus  rapid  transit \noperations established. This will be achieved through (i) institutional development and capacity \nbuilding of the KPUMA and TransPeshawar; (ii) the design of the BRT operational plan and \nbusiness  model  to  achieve  low  operational  subsidies;  (iii) the  facilitation  of  a  bus  industry \ntransition by negotiating with existing bus operators; (iv) effective project communication and \nstakeholder engagement; and (v) the procurement of the BRT fleet, a fare collection system, and \nintelligent transport systems.10 \n                                                \n9  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n10  The PDA loan supports several activities under this output (footnote 6).    \n ", "4 \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n11.  The project is estimated to cost $587 million (Table 1). The government has requested a \nregular loan of $335 million from ADB\u2019s OCR to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-\nyear term, including a grace period of 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% \nper year (interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in the loan); and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. Based on the \nstraight-line method, the average loan maturity is 15.97 years, and the maturity premium payable \nto ADB is 0.10% per year. \n \nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

Cofinancing. The government has also requested two loans, of $75 million equivalent \neach, from the AFD and EIB to finance civil works and equipment costs jointly. The AFD and EIB \nhave confirmed their interest in providing this cofinancing for the project. ADB, the AFD, and the \nEIB will jointly finance relevant contract packages and expenditure categories on a cost-sharing \nbasis. ADB procurement guidelines will apply along with universal procurement for all jointly \nfinanced packages.11 ADB will partially administer the AFD funds, while the EIB funds will not be \nadministered.12 ADB and the AFD will conclude a cofinancing agreement, while ADB and the EIB \nwill conclude an aide-m\u00e9moire detailing the cofinancing arrangements. \n \n13.  The summary financing plan is in Table 2. ADB will finance expenditures relating to  \n(i)  civil  works,  (ii)  equipment,  (iii)  environmental  and  social  impact  mitigation  measures,  \n(iv) consulting services, (v) TransPeshawar\u2019s full operating costs for 3 years, and (vi) financing \ncharges during implementation.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n \n16.  The project preparatory technical assistance and ongoing detailed engineering design \nfinanced under ADB\u2019s PDA loan has confirmed the project\u2019s technical viability.14 The 26 km BRT \ncorridor alignment was carefully selected to capture major demand hubs while verifying the \npossibility of retrofitting the BRT infrastructure (stations and dedicated lanes) in congested areas \nand narrower corridor sections. Some limited sections of the alignment were designed elevated \nor in tunnels or trenches to allow full segregation and maximum commercial speed. Most of the \nalignment remains at-grade, allowing 54 km off-corridor service routes to enter the dedicated \ninfrastructure.  The  BRT  system  was  planned  using  a  detailed  methodology,  including  the \ninventory and analysis of existing services to determine current service capacity and existing \ndemand, and surveys of the proposed BRT corridor. Based on these results, an optimized routing \nand network plan was developed to ensure maximum ridership and the financial sustainability of \nthe system, including the lowest possible operational subsidies.  \n \n17.  The institutional structure has been improved by the establishment of the KPUMA and \nTransPeshawar, which will manage and control the overall quality of the BRT system\u2019s operations. \nThe system\u2019s quality will be enhanced by maximizing the use of private sector contracts for system \noperations. TransPeshawar will specifically oversee private sector contracts to companies for (i) \nbus operations; (ii) station services; (iii) the fare system and control center; (iv) the financial \nclearinghouse; and (v) quality control, monitoring, and evaluation. \n \n18.  A climate risk vulnerability assessment led to a reassessment of the drainage capacity \nrequirement to climate-proof the BRT corridor from floods.15 \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n19.  The project aims to provide a high frequency transit service, replacing informal modes of \ntransport travelling in mixed traffic, with fuel-efficient BRT vehicles travelling in segregated lanes \nat high speeds. In the first year of BRT operations the demand is expected to be 480,000 \n                                                \n14  Footnote 3.

Additional safety benefits (from reduced fatalities and injuries) \nand greenhouse gas emission savings will reach $4 million per year. The economic analysis \nyielded  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  15%,  demonstrating  the  project\u2019s  economic \nviability.16 To ensure a robust result, three sensitivity tests were conducted for the following \nscenarios: (i) a 20% capital cost overrun, (ii) a 20% reduction in passenger ridership, and (iii) a 2-\nyear delay in system operationalization. All scenarios meet the 9% minimum economic yield \nrequired for an ADB-financed project. \n \n20.  The BRT operational plan was designed to ensure that revenue generated from the \nsystem will adequately cover system operations and maintenance costs, eliminating the need for \noperational subsidies. The BRT system generates revenue from (i) fares (94% of all estimated \nrevenues, with the average fare set at PRs25); (ii) advertising (3%); (iii) rent on concessions \nstorefronts in stations and depots (2%); and (iv) revenue from a parking plaza (1%). In the \nabsence of a cost recovery tariff, a conventional financial evaluation based on cash flow analysis \nleading to the computation of a financial internal rate of return is not considered appropriate.17 \nInstead, an operating ratio analysis was conducted to ensure that revenues will cover operating \ncosts. The future financial position of TransPeshawar confirms solid net cash flows as well as its \nfinancial capacity to cover recurrent costs to sustain the facilities developed under the project.  \n \nC.  Governance \n \n21.  The project financial management and procurement capacity assessments conducted in \nMarch 2017 found substantial pre-mitigation risks.18 The executing and implementing agencies \nagreed upon an action plan to strengthen their financial management system and procurement \ncapacity. This plan notably includes the engagement of consultants to provide training and \nsupport to the project management unit and two project implementation units during project \nimplementation. The assessed risk is based on the internal control environment, the implementing \nagencies\u2019 experience implementing development projects, supervisory procedures, and technical \nand financial capability. \n \n22.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and KPUMA. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n23.  The project will benefit Peshawar\u2019s estimated population of 1.8 million, 40% of whom are \npoor, through increased access to safe, reliable, and affordable public transport. An estimated \n0.5 million passengers are predicted to use the BRT regularly, with the percent of female \npassengers increasing from 15% in the current informal public transport system to 20% in the first \nyear of BRT operations, with a subsequent annual increase of 5% in the first 3 years. The low \npercent of female passengers in public transport is mainly due to the risk of harassment that \n                                                \n16 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 The Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa will repay the loan from its own resources, and will consider the capital \ninvestment (including the BRT infrastructure and initial fleet) as an upfront subsidy. Accordingly, TransPeshawar will \nnot need to repay the loan from the BRT system\u2019s operational revenue. The various terms and conditions of the ADB, \nEIB, and AFD loans will therefore not impact this financial analysis. \n18  A detailed Financial Management Assessment and Action Plan, and Procurement Capacity Assessment and Action \nPlan are available in the PAM (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nwomen face in overcrowded public buses. Consequently, most women prefer to walk 2 km per \nday on average, or are forced to use more expensive private transportation, impacting their \ndisposable income. The project will establish universal access and safety features for women, \nchildren, and the disabled in all 31 BRT stations and their accesses, including proper lighting and \nmonitoring through closed-circuit television cameras; and in buses, including segregated areas \nfor women, and staff trained to deal with harassment incidents. Categorized as effective gender \nmainstreaming, the project will encourage women\u2019s meaningful participation by ensuring that 10% \nof BRT operations employees, and TransPeshawar and KPUMA staff are women.19  \n \n24.  Overall, the project is expected to generate  4,020 jobs directly through future BRT \noperations,  including  1,441  jobs  for  BRT  station  services  (such  as  ticketing,  security,  and \ncleaning), 2,522 jobs in bus operations (such as driving, conducting, and mechanics), and 57 \nTransPeshawar staff.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n25.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.20 \n \n26.  Environment (category A). 21 The Peshawar Development Authority has prepared the \nenvironmental impact assessment in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The \nproject\u2019s major anticipated negative environmental impacts are related to traffic disruptions, utility \nrelocation, and noise impacts during construction. The project is also anticipated to have positive \nimpacts during operation, specifically on the urban acoustic environment currently afflicted with \ndecibel levels reaching the mid-80s during the day and mid-70s at night. Likewise, the project is \nexpected  to  impact  urban  air  quality  positively.  The  project  design  incorporates  adequate \nmitigation measures, which will be implemented through an environmental management plan. \nThis plan includes a capacity building and training program for Peshawar Development Authority \nproject staff and contractors during pre-construction, construction, and operation. The project also \ncomplies with public disclosure and consultation requirements. Public consultations involving \nmore  than  600  different  stakeholders,  including  women  and  two  major  Peshawar-based \nnongovernment organizations, were conducted from August 2016 to January 2017, and other \npublic hearings have been organized in April and May 2017. The draft environmental impact \nassessment was disclosed on the ADB website on 27 February, an updated version was \ndisclosed on 7 April, and the final assessment will be disclosed on 10 July 2017. \n \n27.  Involuntary resettlement (category A).22 The project will have resettlement impacts on \n535 households due to (i) the acquisition of 5.9 hectares of private arable land and (ii) the \ndemolition of permanent structures in two underpass markets and a privately-owned building \nencroaching upon the corridor\u2019s right-of-way. It will also impact the livelihoods of 8 agricultural \nland tenants, 86 formal businesses and shopkeepers, 235 informal vendors operating roadside \nmicroenterprises within the right-of-way, and workers from the affected shops. All formal and \nmicro businesses will need to relocate to alternative sites. The leaseholders of 79 shops and \nowners of 15 shops will lose income from the monthly rent of their commercial structures. Among \nthe 535 affected households, 349 are vulnerable and 246 are severely affected; these will need \n                                                \n19 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy and Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n20  ADB.

As much as possible, the alignment and \ndesign and location of the stations were adjusted to reduce the resettlement impacts. A draft \nresettlement plan has been prepared in close consultation with the affected persons and relevant \nagencies. The plan provides an alternative location for the affected shops, compensation for lost \nassets, and transitional support. A draft livelihood restoration plan was also prepared to help the \naffected households cope with their displacement. The land acquisition and resettlement plan has \nbeen endorsed by the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website \non 11 April 2017. It will be updated based on the final detailed engineering design and will include \nimpacts from off-corridor bus stops, worker camps, and materials storage. The KPUMA will be \nresponsible  for  updating  and  implementing  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan.  To \naugment  the  KPUMA's  limited  capacity  and  experience  in  such  plan  implementation  and \nmonitoring, a resettlement team under ADB\u2019s project design advance will support the authority. \n \n28.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project is located in the city of Peshawar, where \nno indigenous peoples, as defined under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, reside. The project \nwill not affect any indigenous communities and, accordingly, no indigenous peoples planning \ndocuments are required. \n \nF.
