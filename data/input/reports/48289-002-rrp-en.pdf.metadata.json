The report also describes the proposed partial administration of a loan to be provided by \nthe  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD)  for  the  Peshawar  Sustainable  BRT  Corridor \nProject, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, approve the administration of the loan. \n \n2. \nThe proposed project will help develop a sustainable urban transport system in Peshawar \nby  delivering  the  city\u2019s  first  integrated  BRT  corridor,  directly  benefiting  0.5  million  people.1 The \nproject  will  comprise  two  interlinked  outputs:  (i)  the  construction  of  a  26-kilometer  (km)  BRT \ncorridor  and  associated  facilities,  and  (ii)  effective  project  management  and  sustainable  BRT \noperations through institutional developments. The project is economically justified by major time \nsavings for future BRT passengers, vehicle operating cost savings, better air quality, and carbon \nemissions  savings,  which  will  improve  the  health  of  Peshawar\u2019s  citizens  and  mitigate  climate \nchange.  The  project  will  also  make  Peshawar  more  livable  and  safe,  boost  private  sector \ninvestment, and foster gender equity. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nBackground and issues. Peshawar is the capital city of the northwest province of Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa in Pakistan. A 2-hour drive from the national capital of Islamabad, Peshawar sits in \nthe Indus valley near the Afghan border. Although the last census was conducted in 1998, the \ncity\u2019s population was estimated at 1.8 million in 2016, and is projected to reach 3.0 million by 2030 \nbased on current growth rates. Internal displacement and Afghan refugee migration has driven \nrapid population growth, and there is significant pressure to maintain infrastructure development \nand service provision in accordance with the growing demand for housing, transport and basic \nurban services. Car and motorcycle ownership  remains low but is increasing due to a growing \nmiddle  class.  Combined  with  other  factors  such  as  inefficient  public  transport  and  weak  traffic \nmanagement  to  organize  competing  modes,  motorization  is  exacerbating  congestion  and \nincreasing  air  and  noise  pollution. 2 Traffic  conditions  on  key  arterial  roads  have  declined  to \nunmanageable  levels,  with  average  peak  hour  travel  speeds  as  low  as  11  km  per  hour.3 No \nnotable  investment  in  public  transport  has  occurred  in  decades.  In  contrast,  recent  large \ninvestments in various flyovers reflect the prioritization of private road transport. Due to its limited \ninfrastructure, the city\u2019s urban transport system fails to provide mobility for all. \n \n4. \nPoverty is widespread in Peshawar, with an incidence of 40%. The unemployment rate is \nabout  10%  for  men  but  90%  for  women,  who  have  fewer  opportunities  to  achieve  economic \nindependence.  The  poorest  people  and  women  travel  mostly  on  foot  or  via  informal  public \ntransport mainly comprising pickup trucks and large and medium-sized buses from the 1980s and \n1990s. Altogether, these vehicles serve around 70% of the total demand for motorized transport, \nbut represent only 43% of total traffic. In response to the high market demand, many operators \n                                                \n1  An estimated 519,000 people (29% of Peshawar\u2019s total population) live within 1 km from a BRT station and would \n\npotentially benefit from this system. \n\n2 The  environmental  impact  assessment  measured  average  concentrations  of  particulate  matter  of  less  than  10 \nmicrometers  at  138\u2013184  micrograms  per  cubic  meter  in  five  locations  along  the  BRT  corridor.  The  level \nrecommended by the World Health Organization is 20 micrograms per cubic meter. \n\n3   Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and ADB. 2016. Peshawar BRT Project: Preliminary Design Report. desMobi: \n\nJakarta. \n\n\fwithout permits are plying the city\u2019s key corridors in a disorganized and inefficient manner. There \nis no effective public oversight of supply and demand or of the quality of public transport vehicles, \nbus  stops  are  rudimentary  and  lack  schedule  and  itinerary  information,  the  ticketing  system  is \nobsolete, and operators compete for passengers, worsening congestion and impairing safety. The \nincidence  of  traffic  collisions  is  increasing,  mainly  affecting  pedestrians,  and  84%  of  surveyed \npassengers  complain  about  crowded  and  unsafe  conditions  during  the  rush  period  and  the \nimproper behavior of drivers and conductors. Public security also determines how residents move \naround  and  interact  in  the  city,  as  all  residents  are  affected  by  the  threat  of  terrorism  which \nremains a concern in Peshawar as well as in other major cities in the country. A well-designed, \nsafe and accessible public transport system in Peshawar would therefore substantially benefit the \nurban poor and women. \n \nProject preparation. In May 2014, the Cities Development Initiative for Asia completed a \n5. \nprefeasibility  study  to  improve  Peshawar\u2019s  urban  transport  system.4 The  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB) subsequently provided technical assistance to prepare Peshawar\u2019s BRT corridor.5 \nADB also approved a $10 million project design advance (PDA) loan from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources  (OCR)  in  November  2016  to  (i)  prepare  detailed  engineering  design,  and  the  BRT \nbusiness model and operational plan; (ii) facilitate project communication; (iii) build capacity; and \n(iv) undertake advance procurement for civil works and equipment.6  \n \nAlignment  with  country  strategy.  The  project  is  consistent  with  the  Government  of \n6. \nPakistan\u2019s Vision 2030, Framework for Economic Growth, and National Climate Change Policy. \nIt  supports  the  priorities  set  out  in  the  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa  Integrated  Development  Strategy \n2014\u20132018,  and  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s country  partnership strategy  and Sustainable Transport \nInitiative.7 The project design includes lessons from past assistance, notably the need for strong \npolitical consensus, and a robust governance structure. Coordination with development partners \nhas  been  ensured,  particularly  with  expected  cofinanciers  such  as  the  AFD  and  European \nInvestment Bank (EIB). Private sector participation is being considered for the BRT operations \n(para. 20), but not for construction as globally few mass transit systems recover their capital costs \nthrough revenues alone, especially as fares must be affordable and socially acceptable.  \n \n7. \n\nADB\u2019s assistance to the project adds value via the following: \n(i) \n\nOrganizational and institutional developments. ADB supported the legislation \nfor (a) the  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa  Mass Transit Ordinance,  which  established the \nKhyber  Pakhtunkhwa  Urban  Mobility  Authority  (KPUMA)  and  was  approved  in \nSeptember 2016; and (b) a special purpose vehicle called TransPeshawar, which \nwas  licensed  in  December  2016. 8  The  KPUMA  is  responsible  for  developing \npolicies and regulations, and planning, coordinating, and funding urban transport \nat the provincial level. TransPeshawar will own the BRT infrastructure and assets, \nand is responsible for the BRT operations and management of service contracts. \nProject design and innovation. ADB\u2019s intervention resulted in innovative design \nfeatures  such  as  (a)  the  promotion  of  nonmotorized  transport  through  universal \n\n(ii) \n\n                                                \n4   Cities Development Initiative for Asia. 2014.

ADB  promoted  a  third-\ngeneration BRT system using a \u201cdirect service\u201d operational model allowing BRT \nvehicles to travel along the BRT corridor in the busiest parts of the city and off-\ncorridor in less congested areas. This approach expands the system\u2019s reach and \ncapacity,  lessens  passenger  transfers,  and  increases  ridership  and  financial \nsustainability.  The  project  was  designed  primarily  to  limit  required  operational \nsubsidies,  and  create  additional  sources  of  revenue  through  parking  and \ncommercial activities. \nindustry  transition.  ADB  strongly \nStakeholder  engagement  and  bus \nemphasizes  engagement  with  the  existing  bus  industry,  and  established  a \nnegotiation  process  enabling  existing  operators  to  participate  in  the  new  BRT \nsystem. The project design includes a fleet scraping program and compensation \nmechanism for nonparticipating operators. A large stakeholder engagement and \nparticipation plan is also being implemented to ensure buy-in from the communities \nimpacted by the project. \n\nOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nB. \n \n8. \nThe project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) a safe, affordable, comfortable, and \nenvironment-friendly transport system in Peshawar achieved; and (ii) quality of life in Peshawar \nimproved.  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  quality  of  public  transport  in  Peshawar \nimproved, benefiting 0.5 million of the city\u2019s inhabitants.9 \n \nC. \n \n9. \nOutput  1:  Peshawar\u2019s  first  sustainable  bus  rapid  transit  corridor  and  associated \nfacilities constructed. The 26 km BRT corridor will be restructured over its entire width (\u201cfa\u00e7ade-\nto-fa\u00e7ade\u201d), including (i) 31 BRT stations and dedicated lanes built in the median, mainly at-grade \nwith a 4 km elevated section in the city center, and tunnel or trench sections at junctions; (ii) up \nto three mixed-traffic lanes improved in each direction in wider sections; (iii) bicycle lanes added \nand sidewalks and streetlights improved all along the corridor; (iv) on-street parking and green \nareas added in various locations; and (v) drainage improved to climate-proof the corridor. The \nBRT infrastructure will be completed with two depots and one staging facility, including park-and-\nride facilities and commercial areas, and 100 off-corridor bus stops. An office building will be built \nat the east depot to house the KPUMA and TransPeshawar offices and the BRT control center. \nA parking plaza will also be constructed in the precinct of the Lady Reading Hospital in the city \ncenter to promote modal shift from private vehicles to the BRT.  \n \n10. \nOutput  2:  Effective  project  management  and  sustainable  bus  rapid  transit \noperations established. This will be achieved through (i) institutional development and capacity \nbuilding  of  the  KPUMA  and  TransPeshawar;  (ii)  the  design  of  the  BRT  operational  plan  and \nbusiness  model  to  achieve  low  operational  subsidies;  (iii) the  facilitation  of  a  bus  industry \ntransition  by  negotiating  with  existing  bus  operators;  (iv)  effective  project  communication  and \nstakeholder engagement; and (v) the procurement of the BRT fleet, a fare collection system, and \nintelligent transport systems.10 \n                                                \n9  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n10  The PDA loan supports several activities under this output (footnote 6).    \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nD. \n \n11. \nThe project is estimated to cost $587 million (Table 1). The government has requested a \nregular loan of $335 million from ADB\u2019s OCR to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-\nyear term, including a grace period of 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% \nper year (interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in the loan); and such \nother  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.  Based  on  the \nstraight-line method, the average loan maturity is 15.97 years, and the maturity premium payable \nto ADB is 0.10% per year. \n \n\nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nOutput 1: Construction of the Peshawar BRT corridor  \nOutput 2: Effective project management and sustainable BRT operations \nSubtotal (A) \n\nBase Costb \n1.  \n2.  \n \nContingenciesc \nFinancial Charges During Implementationd \nTotal (A+B+C) \n \n\nItem \nA.  \n \n \n \nB.  \nC.  \n \nBRT = bus rapid transit. \na   Includes  taxes  and  duties  of  $76.7  million  to  be  financed  by  the  Government  of  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa,  partly \nthrough exemptions and partly through cash contributions.

Some limited sections of the alignment were designed elevated \nor in tunnels or trenches to allow full segregation and maximum commercial speed. Most of the \nalignment  remains  at-grade,  allowing  54  km  off-corridor  service  routes  to  enter  the  dedicated \ninfrastructure.  The  BRT  system  was  planned  using  a  detailed  methodology,  including  the \ninventory  and  analysis  of  existing  services  to  determine  current  service  capacity  and  existing \ndemand, and surveys of the proposed BRT corridor. Based on these results, an optimized routing \nand network plan was developed to ensure maximum ridership and the financial sustainability of \nthe system, including the lowest possible operational subsidies.  \n \n17. \nThe  institutional  structure  has  been  improved  by  the  establishment  of  the  KPUMA  and \nTransPeshawar, which will manage and control the overall quality of the BRT system\u2019s operations. \nThe system\u2019s quality will be enhanced by maximizing the use of private sector contracts for system \noperations. TransPeshawar will specifically oversee private sector contracts to companies for (i) \nbus  operations;  (ii)  station  services;  (iii)  the  fare  system  and  control  center;  (iv)  the  financial \nclearinghouse; and (v) quality control, monitoring, and evaluation. \n \n18. \nrequirement to climate-proof the BRT corridor from floods.15 \n \nB. \n \n19. \nThe project aims to provide a high frequency transit service, replacing informal modes of \ntransport travelling in mixed traffic, with fuel-efficient BRT vehicles travelling in segregated lanes \nat  high  speeds.  In  the  first  year  of  BRT  operations  the  demand  is  expected  to  be  480,000 \n                                                \n14  Footnote 3. The feasibility study report, including the preliminary design of and due diligence for the BRT corridor, \n\nA  climate risk  vulnerability  assessment  led to  a  reassessment  of the  drainage capacity \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nwas submitted in January 2016.  \n\n15  Climate Risk Vulnerability Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n\fGovernance \n\npassengers per day. By 2020, savings from vehicle operating costs are expected to reach $10 \nmillion per year, while time savings benefits for both BRT passengers and the remaining mixed \ntraffic will reach $94 million per year. Additional safety benefits (from reduced fatalities and injuries) \nand  greenhouse  gas  emission  savings  will  reach  $4  million  per  year.  The  economic  analysis \nyielded  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  15%,  demonstrating  the  project\u2019s  economic \nviability. 16 To  ensure  a  robust  result,  three  sensitivity  tests  were  conducted  for  the  following \nscenarios: (i) a 20% capital cost overrun, (ii) a 20% reduction in passenger ridership, and (iii) a 2-\nyear  delay  in  system  operationalization.  All  scenarios  meet  the  9%  minimum  economic  yield \nrequired for an ADB-financed project. \n \n20. \nThe  BRT  operational  plan  was  designed  to  ensure  that  revenue  generated  from  the \nsystem will adequately cover system operations and maintenance costs, eliminating the need for \noperational subsidies. The BRT system generates revenue from (i) fares (94% of all estimated \nrevenues,  with  the  average  fare  set  at  PRs25);  (ii)  advertising  (3%);  (iii)  rent  on  concessions \nstorefronts  in  stations  and  depots  (2%);  and  (iv)  revenue  from  a  parking  plaza  (1%).  In  the \nabsence of a cost recovery tariff, a conventional financial evaluation based on cash flow analysis \nleading to the computation of a financial internal rate of return is not considered appropriate.17 \nInstead, an operating ratio analysis was conducted to ensure that revenues will cover operating \ncosts. The future financial position of TransPeshawar confirms solid net cash flows as well as its \nfinancial capacity to cover recurrent costs to sustain the facilities developed under the project.  \n \nC. \n \n21. \nThe project financial management and procurement capacity assessments conducted in \nMarch 2017 found substantial pre-mitigation risks.18 The executing and implementing agencies \nagreed upon an action plan to strengthen their financial management system and procurement \ncapacity.  This  plan  notably  includes  the  engagement  of  consultants  to  provide  training  and \nsupport  to  the  project  management  unit  and  two  project  implementation  units  during  project \nimplementation. The assessed risk is based on the internal control environment, the implementing \nagencies\u2019 experience implementing development projects, supervisory procedures, and technical \nand financial capability. \n \n22. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and KPUMA. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n \n23. \nThe project will benefit Peshawar\u2019s estimated population of 1.8 million, 40% of whom are \npoor, through increased access to safe, reliable, and affordable public transport. An estimated \n0.5  million  passengers  are  predicted  to  use  the  BRT  regularly,  with  the  percent  of  female \npassengers increasing from 15% in the current informal public transport system to 20% in the first \nyear of BRT operations, with a subsequent annual increase of 5% in the first 3 years. The low \npercent  of  female  passengers  in  public  transport  is  mainly  due  to  the  risk  of  harassment  that \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n                                                \n16 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 The Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa will repay the loan from its own resources, and will consider the capital \ninvestment (including the BRT infrastructure and initial fleet) as an upfront subsidy. Accordingly, TransPeshawar will \nnot need to repay the loan from the BRT system\u2019s operational revenue. The various terms and conditions of the ADB, \nEIB, and AFD loans will therefore not impact this financial analysis. \n\n18  A detailed Financial Management Assessment and Action Plan, and Procurement Capacity Assessment and Action \n\nPlan are available in the PAM (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nSafeguards \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nwomen face in overcrowded public buses. Consequently, most women prefer to walk 2 km per \nday  on  average,  or  are  forced  to  use  more  expensive  private  transportation,  impacting  their \ndisposable income. The project  will  establish  universal  access  and  safety features for  women, \nchildren, and the disabled in all 31 BRT stations and their accesses, including proper lighting and \nmonitoring through closed-circuit television cameras; and in buses, including segregated areas \nfor women, and staff trained to deal with harassment incidents. Categorized as effective gender \nmainstreaming, the project will encourage women\u2019s meaningful participation by ensuring that 10% \nof BRT operations employees, and TransPeshawar and KPUMA staff are women.19  \n \n24. \nOverall,  the  project  is  expected  to  generate  4,020  jobs  directly  through  future  BRT \noperations,  including  1,441  jobs  for  BRT  station  services  (such  as  ticketing,  security,  and \ncleaning),  2,522  jobs  in  bus  operations  (such  as  driving,  conducting,  and  mechanics),  and  57 \nTransPeshawar staff.  \n \nE. \n \n25. \ncategories are as follows.20 \n \nEnvironment  (category  A). 21 The  Peshawar  Development  Authority  has  prepared  the \n26. \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  in accordance  with ADB\u2019s  Safeguard Policy  Statement. The \nproject\u2019s major anticipated negative environmental impacts are related to traffic disruptions, utility \nrelocation, and noise impacts during construction. The project is also anticipated to have positive \nimpacts during operation, specifically on the urban acoustic environment currently afflicted with \ndecibel levels reaching the mid-80s during the day and mid-70s at night. Likewise, the project is \nexpected  to  impact  urban  air  quality  positively.  The  project  design  incorporates  adequate \nmitigation  measures,  which  will  be  implemented  through  an  environmental  management  plan. \nThis plan includes a capacity building and training program for Peshawar Development Authority \nproject staff and contractors during pre-construction, construction, and operation. The project also \ncomplies  with  public  disclosure  and  consultation  requirements.  Public  consultations  involving \nmore  than  600  different  stakeholders,  including  women  and  two  major  Peshawar-based \nnongovernment  organizations,  were  conducted  from  August  2016  to  January  2017,  and  other \npublic  hearings  have  been  organized  in  April  and  May  2017.  The  draft  environmental  impact \nassessment  was  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  on  27  February,  an  updated  version  was \ndisclosed on 7 April, and the final assessment will be disclosed on 10 July 2017. \n \nInvoluntary resettlement (category A).22 The project will have resettlement impacts on \n27. \n535  households  due  to  (i)  the  acquisition  of  5.9  hectares  of  private  arable  land  and  (ii)  the \ndemolition  of  permanent  structures  in  two  underpass  markets  and  a  privately-owned  building \nencroaching upon the corridor\u2019s right-of-way. It will also impact the livelihoods of 8 agricultural \nland tenants, 86 formal businesses and shopkeepers, 235 informal vendors operating roadside \nmicroenterprises  within  the  right-of-way,  and  workers  from  the  affected  shops.  All  formal  and \nmicro  businesses  will  need  to  relocate  to  alternative  sites.  The  leaseholders  of  79  shops  and \nowners of 15 shops will lose income from the monthly rent of their commercial structures. Among \nthe 535 affected households, 349 are vulnerable and 246 are severely affected; these will need \n\n                                                \n19  Summary  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social  Strategy  and  Gender  Action  Plan  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n20  ADB.  Safeguard  Categories.  https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories.

As  much  as  possible,  the  alignment  and \ndesign  and  location  of  the  stations  were  adjusted  to  reduce  the  resettlement  impacts.  A  draft \nresettlement plan has been prepared in close consultation with the affected persons and relevant \nagencies. The plan provides an alternative location for the affected shops, compensation for lost \nassets, and transitional support. A draft livelihood restoration plan was also prepared to help the \naffected households cope with their displacement. The land acquisition and resettlement plan has \nbeen endorsed by the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website \non 11 April 2017. It will be updated based on the final detailed engineering design and will include \nimpacts from off-corridor bus stops, worker camps, and materials storage. The KPUMA will be \nresponsible  for  updating  and  implementing  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan.  To \naugment  the  KPUMA's  limited  capacity  and  experience  in  such  plan  implementation  and \nmonitoring, a resettlement team under ADB\u2019s project design advance will support the authority. \n \n28. \nIndigenous peoples (category C). The project is located in the city of Peshawar, where \nno indigenous peoples, as defined under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, reside. The project \nwill  not  affect  any  indigenous  communities  and,  accordingly,  no  indigenous  peoples  planning \ndocuments are required. \n \nF. \n \n29. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.23 \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nPublic transport users do \nnot utilize BRT at projected \nlevels. \n\nPolitical pressure to fast-\ntrack project implementation \nbefore the mid-2018 general \nelections undermines the \nquality of the project design \nand implementation. \n\nVested interests (existing \npublic transport operators, \nshopkeepers, and others \nalong the BRT corridor) try \nto undermine the project \nduring implementation. \n\nThe project preparatory TA consultants estimated demand and ridership \nby following a proven but simplified methodology. These estimates will be \nfurther updated and confirmed through detailed additional surveys by \nODBM consultants under the PDA. Actual ridership at system opening \nwill depend on the final project design, construction quality, and quality of \noperations management by TransPeshawar. \nAll possible advance actions have been taken to help the Government of \nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa deliver the main bulk of civil works before the mid-\n2018 elections. Large consulting teams have been mobilized ahead of \nloan approval under the PDA. The detail engineering design is ongoing \nand 50% completed. The first civil works packages have been advertised \nin May 2017. Works are expected to start as soon as the project loan is \ndeclared effective in September 2017 (this date is tentative). Retroactive \nfinancing will be used as well to shift utilities ahead of loan approval. \nExisting operators. The project design includes dedicated cost and \nconsultancy support to facilitate bus industry transition through negotiation \nand capacity building to operate the BRT. Consultations with the existing \nbus operators\u2019 federation were held during the project preparatory TA to \ninform operators about the project. Skilled negotiators, who were recruited \nin the ODBM consulting team under the PDA, will further discuss and \ndevelop a business model to include existing operators in the BRT \noperations as much as possible. The initial BRT fleet will be financed \nunder the project and leased to private operators to reduce the need to \nmobilize capital and allow existing operators to participate in the bidding \nprocess. The project financing includes a fleet scraping program and \ncompensation mechanism for non-participating existing operators. \n\n                                                \n23  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \n\nDelayed operationalization \nof the KPUMA and \nTransPeshawar fails to \nprovide necessary critical \nmass to implement the \nproject, and capacity \nbuilding. \n\nThe security situation \ndeteriorates and impairs \nproject implementation and \nfuture BRT operations. \n\nMitigating Measures \nShopkeepers\u2019 and traders\u2019 associations. The government, supported \nby the PMCCB communication team and ADB project team, engaged \nwith traders\u2019 associations and other organizations (e.g., Lady Reading \nHospital and the Cantonment Board) in the vicinity that are impacted by \nthe BRT corridor to present the project design, consider their concerns, \nand ensure buy-in and ownership, so that these groups do not oppose \nthe project or ask to change the project alignment. \nParliament has already approved the legal framework establishing the \nKPUMA, and TransPeshawar is already licensed as a Section 42 \n(nonprofit) public company. The government, as part of its commitment, \nhas already approved an annual allocation for the KPUMA\u2019s operations. \nADB will finance TransPeshawar\u2019s operational expenditures for 3 years. \nOrganograms and job descriptions for key staff of both organizations \nhave been developed by the PMCCB consultants, who will also provide \ngeneral support during staff recruitment. \nThe Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has committed to provide \nsecurity to the project site through its Home Affairs Department and local \nlaw enforcement agencies. Bidders are also instructed to include \nprovisions for security at the camp site and for transportation. The project \ndesign includes measures such as metal detectors installed in all BRT \nstations, and presence of security agents in all BRT vehicles. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank; BRT = bus rapid transit; KPUMA = Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Urban Mobility Authority; \nODBM  =  operations  design  and  business  model;  PDA  =  project  design  advance;  PMCCB  =  project  management, \ncoordination, and capacity building; TA = technical assistance. \nSource: ADB. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n30. \nThe government, KPUMA, Peshawar Development Authority, and TransPeshawar have \nassured  ADB  that  the  project  implementation  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies, \nincluding \nthose  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement, \nconsulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \n \nThe government, KPUMA, Peshawar Development Authority, and TransPeshawar have \n31. \nagreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the draft loan and \nproject agreements. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n32. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$335,000,000 to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Peshawar Sustainable Bus Rapid Transit \nCorridor  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  in  regular  terms,  with  interest  to  be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility;  for  a term  of  25  years,  including  a grace  period  of  5  years;  and such  other  terms  and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in the  draft  loan  and  project \nagreements presented to the Board. \n\n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n\n8 June 2017\n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n\nImpacts the Project is Aligned with: \nA safe, affordable, comfortable, and environment-friendly transport system in Peshawar achieveda \nQuality of life in Peshawar improveda \n\nPerformance Indicators with Targets and \nBaselines \n\nData Sources \nand Reporting \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \nQuality of public \ntransport in \nPeshawar \nimproved, \nbenefiting 0.5 \nmillion of the city\u2019s \ninhabitants \n\nOutputs \n1.

New York.  \n\nThe  BRT  Standard  is  an  evaluation  tool  for  BRT  corridors  based  on  international  best  practices.  It  is  also  the \ncenterpiece of a global effort by leaders in BRT design to establish a common definition of BRT and to ensure that \nBRT corridors more uniformly deliver world-class passenger experiences, significant economic benefits, and positive \nenvironmental  impacts.  The  standard  functions  as  a  planning  tool,  scoring  system,  and  means  of  achieving  a \ncommon definition of BRT.  \n\nSource: ADB. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nLIST OF LINKED DOCUMENTS \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/RRPs/?id=48289-002-3 \n\nLoan Agreement \n\nProject Agreement \n\nSector Assessment (Summary): Urban Transport \n\nProject Administration Manual \n\nContribution to the ADB Results Framework \n\nDevelopment Coordination \n\nClimate Risk Vulnerability Assessment \n\nEconomic and Financial Analysis \n\nCountry Economic Indicators \n\nSummary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n\nGender Action Plan \n\nEnvironmental Impact Assessment \n\nResettlement Plan \n\nRisk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nSupplementary Documents \n\nFinancial Management Assessment Report \n\nProcurement Risk Assessment Report \n\n \n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\n7. \n\n8. \n\n9. \n\n10. \n\n11. \n\n12. \n\n13. \n\n14. \n\n \n\n15. \n\n16. \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 12 May 2017) \n \n", "Currency unit \nPRe1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "Pakistan rupee/s (PRe/PRs) \n$0.009555 \nPRs104.655 \n", " \n", " \n", " \nABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nAFD \nBRT \nEIB \nkm \nKPUMA \nOCR \nPAM \nPDA \n \n", "kilometer \n", "bus rapid transit \n", "\u2013  Asian Development Bank \n\u2013  Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement  \n\u2013 \n\u2013  European Investment Bank \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Urban Mobility Authority \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \n", "ordinary capital resources \nproject administration manual \nproject design advance \n \n", " \n \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "NOTE \n", "In this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to United States dollars. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", "Vice-President  W.
