Since  School  year  (SY)  1997/98, \n1. \nCambodia has made significant progress  in expanding access to education, resulting in near-\nuniversal  access  to  primary  education,  with  a  net  enrollment  rate  reaching  98.4%  (99.3%  for \nfemales in SY 2014/15 .1 Expanded access at the primary level has led to higher enrollments at \nthe  secondary  level,  with  lower  secondary  education  gross  enrollment  rate  in  SY  2014/15  at \n56.5% (59.4% for females).2 Gender disparity in enrollment is no longer an issue at the primary \nand lower secondary levels. \n \nHowever,  significant  challenges  remain  at  the  upper  secondary  education  (USE)  level. \n2. \nThe  USE  gross  enrollment  rate  declined  from  32.9%  (30.1%  female)  in  SY2010/11  to  25.1% \n(26.0% female, below 20% in disadvantaged provinces) in SY2015/16.3 Grade 12 dropout rates \nreached a historic high of 45% (42% female) during SY2015/16, an increase of 34.9 percentage \npoints (32.2 percentage points for females) from rates in SY 2011/12. Completion rates for USE \nremained  low  at  20.0%  (20.1%  female)  in  SY  2014/15. 4 A  2014  study  showed  that  many \nstudents  leave  upper  secondary  school  (USS)  with  insufficient  content,  cognitive,  trade,  and \nworkplace  skills  to  meet  expectations  of  employers  or  universities.5 There  are  still  key  gender \nissues  related  to  access  to  and  retention  in  USE.  These  include  the  following:  (i)  stereotypes \nassociated  with  the  traditional  role  of  females  in  society,  which  prevent  parents  from  allowing \ngirls  to  complete  secondary  education;  (ii)  far  distances  between  home  and  school,  making \ntravel  to  school  unsafe  for  girls;  (iii)  lack  of  housing  on  school  premises,  which  deters  female \nteachers from teaching in remote areas; and (iv) lack of sanitation facilities in upper secondary \nschools, deterring female student participation. \n \n3. \nBinding  constraints.  The  low  participation  and  high  dropout  are  attributed  to  both \ndemand-  and  supply-side  constraints.  On  the  demand  side,  the  high  opportunity  cost  of \nschooling  among  poor  students  pose  disincentives  to  attending  upper  secondary  school. \nEconomic  pressures  on  poor  households\u2019  resources  due  to  direct  or  indirect  income foregone \nimpacts the decision to either attend or drop out of school. The supply-side constraints include \ninadequate and inefficient spending in education; lack of qualified teachers and teacher trainers; \nand weak capacity to plan and manage programs and resources, especially at the subnational \nlevels.  While  there  has  been  a  significant  increase  in  the  MoEYS  budget  against  the  national \nbudget  i.e.,  from  15.5%  in  SY  2013\u201314  to  18.3%  in  SY  2015\u201316,  this  is  still  not  enough  to \nfinance  the  substantial  education  resource  requirements.  The  initial  priority  to  achieve  the \ncountry\u2019s education goals at the primary and lower secondary education level means there are \nnot  enough  funds  remaining  to  spend  on  USE.  The  limited  budget  for  capital  expenditures \nconstrains  the  expansion  of  upper  secondary  schools  in  the  disadvantaged  provinces.  This \nfurther poses barriers to attendance since many upper secondary schools nationwide are either \n\n                                                \n1   The net enrollment rate for primary education in SY1997/98 was 78%. \n2   Government  of  Cambodia;  Ministry  of  Education,  Youth  and  Sport  (MOEYS).  2016.

The  inadequate  USE  budget  and  inefficiencies  in  spending  impedes  the  provision  of \ncritical  teaching  and  learning  resources  (e.g.,  equipment,  science  and  computer  laboratories, \nand libraries) to upgrade the students\u2019 proficiency in the USE subjects.  On average, at least two \nstudents  share  one  textbook  per  subject  in  grade  12.  The  lack  of  school  maintenance  budget \nconstrains the full utilization of equipment and laboratories in the SRS. The low pay for teachers \ncompared  to  other  occupations  partly  explains  the  inability  to  attract  high  achievers  into  the \nteaching force. \n \n4. \nThe  shortage  of  qualified  teachers  and  teacher  trainers  continues  to  be  a  major \nconstraint  to  achieving  quality  outcomes  in  USE.  Approximately  86%  of  Cambodian  teachers \nhave  qualifications  below  a  bachelor\u2019s  degree. 7  In-service \ntraining  and  professional \ndevelopment  opportunities  have  been  limited.  Pre-service trainings  do  not  adequately  address \nthe lack of mastery of content or knowledge of effective pedagogy to enhance student learning \nand  interest.  The  inequity  in  the  distribution  of  qualified  teachers  remains  an  issue.  Teaching \npositions in rural and disadvantaged areas are  considered less desirable compared to those in \nmore accessible areas due to poor teaching conditions (e.g., large class sizes, double shifting, \npoor living conditions, and transportation challenges). The lack of relevance of the curriculum to \nthe  skills  and  competency  requirements  in  the  labor  market,  and  the  absence  of  a  national \nassessment policy \n \n5. \n A  pervasive  factor  in  poor  USE  performance  is  the  weak  management  capacity  in \nresource  planning,  management,  and  utilization,  especially  at  the  subnational  levels.  Weak \nschool  management  has  constrained  the  ability  of  schools  to  flexibly  respond  to  their  needs.  \nMonitoring  and  evaluation  capacity  at  all  levels  of  the  MOEYS  is  limited,  and  the  education \nmanagement  information  system  needs  further  strengthening.  There  is  weak  capacity  to \nanalyze collected data to inform resource allocation and policy development. Engagement with \nkey  stakeholders,  including  the  parents,  community  representataives  in  planning,  monitoring, \nresource mobilization, and management has been limited.  \n   \nB. \n\nGovernment\u2019s Sector Strategy \n\n \n\nPlans  and  strategies.  The  Rectangular  Strategy  for  Growth,  Employment,  Equity  and \n6. \nEfficiency,  Phase  III 8  reiterates  the  government\u2019s  commitment  to  strengthen  the  quality  of \neducational services and of human resource development for economic growth. In line with this \nStrategy, the government increased budgetary allocations to education and mobilized additional \nresources  from  development  partners  to  implement  education  reforms.  The  National  Strategic \nDevelopment  Plan  (NSDP),  2014\u20132018 9  articulates  the  need  to  mainstream  scientific  and \ntechnological knowledge and  its  applications  in  academic curriculums,  especially  in  secondary \neducation, vocational and technical training, and higher education. The Industrial Development \nPolicy  (IDP),  2015\u2013202510   has  led  to  a  strong  push for  the  promotion  of  science,  technology, \nengineering,  and  mathematics  in  schools  to  develop  human  resources  and  drive  the  nation\u2019s \ndevelopment. \n\n                                                \n6   The average distance from home to school is about 7.4 kilometers for upper secondary school students, compared \n\nwith 2.0 kilometers for primary school and 3.5 kilometers for lower secondary school students. \n\n7  Government  of  Cambodia;  Ministry  of  Education,  Youth  and  Sport  (MOEYS);  Department  of  Planning.  2015. \n\nEducation Management Information System.

The  MOEYS  has  responsibility  for  the  full  scope  of  education  in \n7. \nCambodia from early childhood education through post-secondary and university. The MOEYS \nhas  seven  directorates  including  the  Directorate  General  of  Education.    Under  the  Directorate \nGeneral of Education, there are 10 departments: Early Childhood Education, Primary Education, \nSecondary Education, Nonformal Education, School Health, Curriculum Development, Teacher \nTraining, Career Orientation, Publication and Distribution, and the Center for Preschool Teacher \nTraining.  As  of  2014,  the  MOEYS  had  provincial  offices  of  education  (in  charge  of  upper \nsecondary education) in all 25 provinces of Cambodia and district offices of education (in charge \nof lower secondary education) in all 193 districts. \n \n8.   \nEducation budget.  The increase in the overall budget for the education sector (para. 3) \nallowed  for  sustained  investment  in  primary  and  lower  secondary  education  to  meet  the \ncountry\u2019s  basic  education goals. The  budget for public  education  and technical  and vocational \neducation  and  training  (TVET)  is  around  2.6%  of  the  country\u2019s  gross  domestic  product. \nHowever,  this  is  not  enough  to  finance  the  substantial  education  and  TVET  resource \nrequirements. In 2015, the MOEYS started to implement the full program budget, which is in line \nwith  the  government\u2019s  move  toward  decentralizing  some  functions  to  the  subnational  level  to \nmake  education  service  delivery  more  efficient.    The  program  budget  has  been  an  important \nfinancing  modality  in  providing  all  schools  at  all  levels  of  education  across  the  country  with \nschool operating budgets linked to their needs and results.11 \n  \n9. \nThe  government  has  increasingly  prioritized  improvement  of  public  service  delivery, \ncentering  on  three  interrelated  reform  initiatives:  (i)  decentralization  and  deconcentration,  (ii) \npublic  financial  management  reforms  under  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance,  and  (iii) \npublic administration reforms. Decentralization and deconcentration create the most opportunity \nfor  education  system  reform  as  they  entail  an  eventual  devolution  of  functions  under  the \nMOEYS  to  provincial  and  district  offices  of  education,  which  are  accountable  to  local  councils \nand boards. \n \nC. \n\nAsian Development Bank Sector Experience and Assistance Program \n\n \n10. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) has played a major role in education in Cambodia \nsince early 2000. The Education Sector Development Program (ESDP) and Second ESDP and \nthe  ongoing  Third  ESDP  focused  on  increasing  access  to  and  quality  of  lower  secondary \neducation.  The  recently  completed  Enhancing  Education  Quality  Project  supported  quality \nimprovements through the establishment of Secondary Resource Schools (SRS) fully equipped \nto  support  student  learning  and  teacher  training. 12 The  Upper  Secondary  Education  Sector \nDevelopment  Program  (USESDP)  will  address  the  substantial  unmet  needs  at  the  relatively \nunderserved USE level through critical resource inputs and policy reforms in USE. It will build on \nthe  achievements  and  reforms  in  the  previous  ADB  programs,  including  on  school-based \nmanagement  and  decentralization.    ADB  is  well  placed  to  facilitate  policy  reforms  in  USE, \nhaving  established  a  strong  partnership  with  the  government  through  years  of  policy  dialogue \n                                                \n11 School  operating  budgets  were  introduced  in  SY2001/02  when  the  MOEYS  abolished  school  entry  fees.  They \nfinance school operations and facilities maintenance. The MOEYS is working toward harmonizing school operating \nbudgets and the School Improvement Grant into a School Improvement Fund. \n\n12 ADB.  2001.

This  will  be  complemented  by  ADB\u2019s  engagement  in \nother  government  priorities, \n(PFM)  and \ndecentralization.  Major  PFM  issues  in  key  line  agencies,  including  in  the  MOEYS,  will  be \naddressed through a proposed policy-based loan. \n \n11. \nAside  from  ADB,  major  development  partners  in  the  education  sector  in  Cambodia \ninclude  the  European  Union;  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency;  Swedish  International \nDevelopment Cooperation Agency; UNICEF; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \nOrganization; and the World Bank. Major investments by the development partners to date have \nfocused on primary and lower secondary education. The USESDP has been designed in close \nconsultation  with  these  partners,  particularly  those  supporting  science,  math,  and  information \nand communication technology education; and institutional strengthening and policy reforms in \nsecondary education to promote complementarity and for optimum results and efficiency.  \n \n12. \nLessons learned. Lessons learned from past ADB assistance to the education sector in \nCambodia  include  the  need  to  (i)  align  policy  reforms  with  the  government\u2019s  capacity  to  fully \nimplement  the  reforms;  (ii)  provide  adequate  technical  assistance  support  to  develop  and \nimplement  policy  reforms  in  key  areas;  (iii)  build  capacity  of  implementing  agencies\u2019  staff  to \nfacilitate smooth implementation of project interventions and enhance sustainability; (iv) ensure \na strong fiduciary and fiscal framework to advance sector reforms; (v) strengthen the education \nmanagement  information  system  (EMIS)  to  facilitate  monitoring,  and  enhance  data-based \ndecision-making;  and (vi)  ensure  strong  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  program  interventions  to \nstrengthen implementation. \n \nADB's  forward  sector  strategy. ADB\u2019s forward strategy for education and training will \n13. \nbe  aligned  with  the  NSDP,  2014\u20132018;  the  IDP,  2015\u20132025;  and  the  MOEYS\u2019s  Education \nStrategic  Plan,  2014\u20132018.13 The  objectives  of  ADB\u2019s  forward  strategy  will  be  to  (i)  promote \nequitable access for all to education and training services, (ii) enhance the quality and relevance \nof  learning  and  skills  development,  and  (iii)  support  effective  leadership  and  management  of \neducation and training staff at all levels. The ADB investments in education will respond to the \ngovernment\u2019s  vision  of  having  high-quality  human  resources  to  sustain  Cambodia\u2019s  economic \ndevelopment and enhance its competitiveness. The need for equal access for Cambodian youth \nto  employment  opportunities  within  Cambodia  and  in  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian \nNations economic community provides a strong justification and adds a sense of urgency to the \nsupport of USE. \n \nADB assistance in the education sector will focus on improving the effectiveness of the \n14. \nUSE  system  by  improving  access  to  and  quality  and  relevance  of  USE.  The  USESDP  will \nemphasize  the  strengthening  of  science,  technology,  engineering,  and  mathematics  education \nto  effectively  (i)  respond  to  the  labor  market\u2019s  changing  skills  and  competency  requirements; \nand  (ii)  strengthen  institutional  capacity  for  planning,  management,  and  delivery  of  education. \nThe USESDP will support the MOEYS in allocating resources for education priorities, especially \nat  USE  level,  through  formulation  and  adoption  of  a  medium-term  plan  and  investment \nrequirements  to  implement  medium-  and  long-term  sector  reforms,  and  achieve  the  intended \nsector  and subsector  outcomes. These actions will  be  informed  by  the results  of  the mid-term \nreview  of  the  Education  Strategic  Plan,  2014-2018,  and  within  the  framework  of  the  NSDP, \n2014\u20132018; and the IDP, 2015\u20132025.  \n \n\n                                                \n13 Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (MoEYS). 2014.

The Education Sector Development Program (ESDP) and Second ESDP and \nthe  ongoing  Third  ESDP  focused  on  increasing  access  to  and  quality  of  lower  secondary \neducation.  The  recently  completed  Enhancing  Education  Quality  Project  supported  quality \nimprovements through the establishment of Secondary Resource Schools (SRS) fully equipped \nto  support  student  learning  and  teacher  training. 12 The  Upper  Secondary  Education  Sector \nDevelopment  Program  (USESDP)  will  address  the  substantial  unmet  needs  at  the  relatively \nunderserved USE level through critical resource inputs and policy reforms in USE. It will build on \nthe  achievements  and  reforms  in  the  previous  ADB  programs,  including  on  school-based \nmanagement  and  decentralization.    ADB  is  well  placed  to  facilitate  policy  reforms  in  USE, \nhaving  established  a  strong  partnership  with  the  government  through  years  of  policy  dialogue \n                                                \n11 School  operating  budgets  were  introduced  in  SY2001/02  when  the  MOEYS  abolished  school  entry  fees.
