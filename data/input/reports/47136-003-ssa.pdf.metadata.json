Sector Performance, Problems, and Opportunities \n \n1.  Sector  performance  and  access  to  education.  Since  School  year  (SY)  1997/98, \nCambodia has made significant progress  in expanding access to education, resulting in near-\nuniversal access to primary education, with a net enrollment rate reaching 98.4% (99.3% for \nfemales in SY 2014/15 .1 Expanded access at the primary level has led to higher enrollments at \nthe secondary level, with lower secondary education gross enrollment rate in SY 2014/15 at \n56.5% (59.4% for females).2 Gender disparity in enrollment is no longer an issue at the primary \nand lower secondary levels. \n \n2.  However, significant challenges remain at the upper secondary education (USE) level. \nThe USE gross enrollment rate declined from 32.9% (30.1% female) in SY2010/11 to 25.1% \n(26.0% female, below 20% in disadvantaged provinces) in SY2015/16.3 Grade 12 dropout rates \nreached a historic high of 45% (42% female) during SY2015/16, an increase of 34.9 percentage \npoints (32.2 percentage points for females) from rates in SY 2011/12. Completion rates for USE \nremained low at 20.0% (20.1% female) in SY 2014/15.4 A 2014 study showed that many \nstudents leave upper secondary school (USS) with insufficient content, cognitive, trade, and \nworkplace skills to meet expectations of employers or universities.5 There are still key gender \nissues related to access to and retention in USE. These include the following: (i) stereotypes \nassociated with the traditional role of females in society, which prevent parents from allowing \ngirls to complete secondary education; (ii) far distances between home and school, making \ntravel to school unsafe for girls; (iii) lack of housing on school premises, which deters female \nteachers from teaching in remote areas; and (iv) lack of sanitation facilities in upper secondary \nschools, deterring female student participation. \n \n3.  Binding  constraints. The low participation and high dropout are attributed to both \ndemand-  and  supply-side  constraints.  On  the  demand  side,  the  high  opportunity  cost  of \nschooling  among  poor  students  pose  disincentives  to  attending  upper  secondary  school. \nEconomic pressures on poor households\u2019 resources due to direct or indirect income foregone \nimpacts the decision to either attend or drop out of school. The supply-side constraints include \ninadequate and inefficient spending in education; lack of qualified teachers and teacher trainers; \nand weak capacity to plan and manage programs and resources, especially at the subnational \nlevels. While there has been a significant increase in the MoEYS budget against the national \nbudget i.e., from 15.5% in SY 2013\u201314 to 18.3% in SY 2015\u201316, this is still not enough to \nfinance  the  substantial  education  resource  requirements.  The  initial  priority  to  achieve  the \ncountry\u2019s education goals at the primary and lower secondary education level means there are \nnot enough funds remaining to spend on USE. The limited budget for capital expenditures \nconstrains the expansion of upper secondary schools in the disadvantaged provinces. This \nfurther poses barriers to attendance since many upper secondary schools nationwide are either \n                                                \n1  The net enrollment rate for primary education in SY1997/98 was 78%. \n2  Government of Cambodia; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport (MOEYS). 2016.

", "2 \n \ntoo far from home,6 are overcrowded or in a state of disrepair, or lack water and sanitation \nfacilities. The inadequate USE budget and inefficiencies in spending impedes the provision of \ncritical teaching and learning resources (e.g., equipment, science and computer laboratories, \nand libraries) to upgrade the students\u2019 proficiency in the USE subjects.  On average, at least two \nstudents share one textbook per subject in grade 12. The lack of school maintenance budget \nconstrains the full utilization of equipment and laboratories in the SRS. The low pay for teachers \ncompared to other occupations partly explains the inability to attract high achievers into the \nteaching force. \n \n4.  The  shortage  of  qualified  teachers  and  teacher  trainers  continues  to  be  a  major \nconstraint to achieving quality outcomes in USE. Approximately 86% of Cambodian teachers \nhave  qualifications  below  a  bachelor\u2019s  degree. 7  In-service  training  and  professional \ndevelopment opportunities have been limited. Pre-service trainings do not adequately address \nthe lack of mastery of content or knowledge of effective pedagogy to enhance student learning \nand interest. The inequity in the distribution of qualified teachers remains an issue. Teaching \npositions in rural and disadvantaged areas are  considered less desirable compared to those in \nmore accessible areas due to poor teaching conditions (e.g., large class sizes, double shifting, \npoor living conditions, and transportation challenges). The lack of relevance of the curriculum to \nthe skills and competency requirements in the labor market, and the absence of a national \nassessment policy \n \n5.   A pervasive factor in poor USE performance is the weak management capacity in \nresource planning, management, and utilization, especially at the subnational levels. Weak \nschool management has constrained the ability of schools to flexibly respond to their needs.  \nMonitoring and evaluation capacity at all levels of the MOEYS is limited, and the education \nmanagement  information  system  needs  further  strengthening.  There  is  weak  capacity  to \nanalyze collected data to inform resource allocation and policy development. Engagement with \nkey stakeholders, including the parents, community representataives in planning, monitoring, \nresource mobilization, and management has been limited.  \n   \nB.  Government\u2019s Sector Strategy \n \n6.  Plans and strategies. The Rectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, Equity and \nEfficiency,  Phase  III8 reiterates  the  government\u2019s  commitment  to  strengthen  the  quality  of \neducational services and of human resource development for economic growth. In line with this \nStrategy, the government increased budgetary allocations to education and mobilized additional \nresources from development partners to implement education reforms. The National Strategic \nDevelopment  Plan  (NSDP),  2014\u201320189 articulates  the  need  to  mainstream  scientific  and \ntechnological knowledge and its applications in academic curriculums, especially in secondary \neducation, vocational and technical training, and higher education. The Industrial Development \nPolicy (IDP), 2015\u2013202510  has led to a strong push for the promotion of science, technology, \nengineering, and mathematics in schools to develop human resources and drive the nation\u2019s \ndevelopment. \n                                                \n6  The average distance from home to school is about 7.4 kilometers for upper secondary school students, compared \nwith 2.0 kilometers for primary school and 3.5 kilometers for lower secondary school students. \n7 Government of Cambodia; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport (MOEYS); Department of Planning. 2015. \nEducation Management Information System.

Education structure. The MOEYS has responsibility for the full scope of education in \nCambodia from early childhood education through post-secondary and university. The MOEYS \nhas seven directorates including the Directorate General of Education.  Under the Directorate \nGeneral of Education, there are 10 departments: Early Childhood Education, Primary Education, \nSecondary Education, Nonformal Education, School Health, Curriculum Development, Teacher \nTraining, Career Orientation, Publication and Distribution, and the Center for Preschool Teacher \nTraining.  As  of 2014, the  MOEYS  had  provincial  offices of  education  (in  charge  of  upper \nsecondary education) in all 25 provinces of Cambodia and district offices of education (in charge \nof lower secondary education) in all 193 districts. \n \n8.    Education budget.  The increase in the overall budget for the education sector (para. 3) \nallowed  for  sustained  investment  in  primary  and  lower  secondary  education  to  meet  the \ncountry\u2019s basic education goals. The budget for public education and technical and vocational \neducation  and  training  (TVET)  is  around  2.6%  of  the  country\u2019s  gross  domestic  product. \nHowever,  this  is  not  enough  to  finance  the  substantial  education  and  TVET  resource \nrequirements. In 2015, the MOEYS started to implement the full program budget, which is in line \nwith the government\u2019s move toward decentralizing some functions to the subnational level to \nmake education service delivery more efficient.  The program budget has been an important \nfinancing modality in providing all schools at all levels of education across the country with \nschool operating budgets linked to their needs and results.11 \n  \n9.  The government  has  increasingly  prioritized  improvement  of  public service  delivery, \ncentering on three interrelated reform initiatives: (i) decentralization and deconcentration, (ii) \npublic financial management reforms under the Ministry of Economy and Finance, and (iii) \npublic administration reforms. Decentralization and deconcentration create the most opportunity \nfor  education  system  reform  as  they  entail  an  eventual  devolution  of  functions  under  the \nMOEYS to provincial and district offices of education, which are accountable to local councils \nand boards. \n \nC.  Asian Development Bank Sector Experience and Assistance Program \n \n10.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has played a major role in education in Cambodia \nsince early 2000. The Education Sector Development Program (ESDP) and Second ESDP and \nthe ongoing Third ESDP focused on increasing access to and quality of lower secondary \neducation.  The  recently  completed  Enhancing  Education  Quality  Project  supported  quality \nimprovements through the establishment of Secondary Resource Schools (SRS) fully equipped \nto  support  student  learning  and teacher training.12The  Upper  Secondary  Education  Sector \nDevelopment Program (USESDP) will address the substantial unmet needs at the relatively \nunderserved USE level through critical resource inputs and policy reforms in USE. It will build on \nthe  achievements  and  reforms  in  the  previous  ADB  programs,  including  on  school-based \nmanagement and decentralization.  ADB is well placed to facilitate policy reforms in USE, \nhaving established a strong partnership with the government through years of policy dialogue \n                                                \n11 School operating budgets were introduced in SY2001/02 when the MOEYS abolished school entry fees. They \nfinance school operations and facilities maintenance. The MOEYS is working toward harmonizing school operating \nbudgets and the School Improvement Grant into a School Improvement Fund. \n12 ADB. 2001.

This will be complemented by ADB\u2019s engagement in \nother  government  priorities,  including  on  public  financial  management  (PFM)  and \ndecentralization.  Major PFM  issues  in key  line  agencies,  including  in  the  MOEYS,  will  be \naddressed through a proposed policy-based loan. \n \n11.  Aside from ADB, major development partners in the education sector in Cambodia \ninclude the European Union; Japan International Cooperation Agency; Swedish International \nDevelopment Cooperation Agency; UNICEF; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \nOrganization; and the World Bank. Major investments by the development partners to date have \nfocused on primary and lower secondary education. The USESDP has been designed in close \nconsultation with these partners, particularly those supporting science, math, and information \nand communication technology education; and institutional strengthening and policy reforms in \nsecondary education to promote complementarity and for optimum results and efficiency.  \n \n12.  Lessons learned. Lessons learned from past ADB assistance to the education sector in \nCambodia include the need to (i) align policy reforms with the government\u2019s capacity to fully \nimplement  the  reforms;  (ii)  provide  adequate  technical  assistance  support  to  develop  and \nimplement policy reforms in key areas; (iii) build capacity of implementing agencies\u2019 staff to \nfacilitate smooth implementation of project interventions and enhance sustainability; (iv) ensure \na strong fiduciary and fiscal framework to advance sector reforms; (v) strengthen the education \nmanagement  information  system  (EMIS)  to  facilitate  monitoring,  and  enhance  data-based \ndecision-making; and (vi) ensure strong monitoring and evaluation of program interventions to \nstrengthen implementation. \n \n13.  ADB's forward sector strategy. ADB\u2019s forward strategy for education and training will \nbe aligned with the NSDP, 2014\u20132018; the IDP, 2015\u20132025; and the MOEYS\u2019s Education \nStrategic Plan, 2014\u20132018.13 The objectives of ADB\u2019s forward strategy will be to (i) promote \nequitable access for all to education and training services, (ii) enhance the quality and relevance \nof learning and skills development, and (iii) support effective leadership and management of \neducation and training staff at all levels. The ADB investments in education will respond to the \ngovernment\u2019s vision of having high-quality human resources to sustain Cambodia\u2019s economic \ndevelopment and enhance its competitiveness. The need for equal access for Cambodian youth \nto  employment  opportunities  within  Cambodia  and  in  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian \nNations economic community provides a strong justification and adds a sense of urgency to the \nsupport of USE. \n \n14.  ADB assistance in the education sector will focus on improving the effectiveness of the \nUSE system by improving access to and quality and relevance of USE. The USESDP will \nemphasize the strengthening of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education \nto effectively (i) respond to the labor market\u2019s changing skills and competency requirements; \nand (ii) strengthen institutional capacity for planning, management, and delivery of education. \nThe USESDP will support the MOEYS in allocating resources for education priorities, especially \nat  USE  level,  through  formulation  and  adoption  of  a  medium-term  plan  and  investment \nrequirements to implement medium- and long-term sector reforms, and achieve the intended \nsector and subsector outcomes. These actions will be informed by the results of the mid-term \nreview of the Education Strategic Plan, 2014-2018, and within the framework of the NSDP, \n2014\u20132018; and the IDP, 2015\u20132025.  \n \n                                                \n13 Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (MoEYS). 2014.
