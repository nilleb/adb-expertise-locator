Thematic: Gender \n \nEnvironment  Classified as category C \nAssessment   \n   \nRationale  Tajikistan has recently made great progress in moving toward a \nmarket-based  economy.  In  the  past  3  years,  economic \ndevelopment  and  transition  have  accelerated,  yet  the  poverty \nincidence remains high. Recent surveys estimated that in 2002 as \nmuch as 80% of the population is poor.  \n \n  The commercial banking sector, in an early stage of development, \ncannot meet the needs of micro- and small enterprises (MSEs) \nand poor households. Rural areas remain largely unserved by \nbanks. In contrast, Tajikistan has seen the emergence of a highly \nactive and potentially effective microfinance sector. By the end of \n2002, around 17 NGOs were carrying out lending activities, which \nare generally funded through international grant assistance. The \nloans target rural microenterprises and women, and the poor. \n \n  The  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory  framework  needs  to  be \ndeveloped so that NGO programs and new MFIs can operate \nlegally and under an effective regime of supervision that supports \nprudent  financial  intermediation,  including  deposit  mobilization. \nNGO microcredit programs do not have the capacity to serve the \nmicrofinance market. However, they have developed a substantial \nlevel of trust with their clients, registered a high percentage of loan \nrepayment, and are developing approaches to sustainability, but \nrequire  support  in  the  transformation  to  fully  licensed  and \nregulated MFIs. \n \n  The  goal  of  MSDP  is  to  create  a  strong,  commercially  viable \nmicrofinance  sector.  The  purpose  is  to  establish  a  regulated \nmicrofinance market in which MSEs and poor households have \naccess  to  financial  products  provided  through  sustainable \nmicrofinance institutions. \n ", "iv   \nThe Sector Development  MSDP  components  include  (i)  development  of  policy,  legal, \nProgram  regulatory, and institutional measures to develop a microfinance \nindustry; (ii) capacity building for the National Bank of Tajikistan \n(NBT) in regulating and supervising MFIs; (iii) capacity building for \nNGOs  being  transformed  into  formally  licensed  and  regulated \nMFIs;  and  (iv)  an  investment  component  piloting  the \ntransformation of selected NGO microcredit programs. \n \nThe Policy Loan      The  purpose  is  to  create  a  legal,  regulatory,  and  supervisory \nObjectives And Scope  environment  that  supports  the  development  of  a  strong, \ncommercially viable microfinance sector. The components include \n(i) adopting a strategy and policy to develop the microfinance \nsector;  (ii)  developing  an  effective  legal  and  regulatory \nenvironment for microfinance; and (iii) establishing institutions to \noversee the development of microfinance. \n \nPolicy Framework and  The key reform measures include (i) introduction of a government \nActions  policy  statement  for  microfinance;  (ii)  establishment  of  a \nmicrofinance  policy  steering  committee  (MPSC); \n(iii) establishment  of  a  technical  working  group  (TWG); \n(iv) introduction  of  a  law  on  microfinance  organizations; \n(v) harmonizing of laws and regulations on MFIs, with Parliament \napproving amendments; (vi) NBT approval of regulations for MFIs; \nand  (vii)  issuance  of  operating  licenses  to  two  deposit-taking \nMFIs. \n \n Loan Amount and Terms   A loan of SDR2.934 million ($4 million equivalent) is proposed \n  from Asian Development Fund (ADF) resources. The loan will \n  have an amortization period of 24 years, including a grace period \n  of 8 years, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% during the \n  grace period and 1.5% thereafter. \n   \nProgram Period and  The loan will be released in two tranches. The first, $1.5 million \nTranching  equivalent,  will  be  released  on  loan  effectiveness,  and  the \nsecond, $2.5 million equivalent, within two years of the date of \nloan  effectiveness,  subject  to  compliance  with  the  agreed-on \nconditions. An incentive tranche of $1 million equivalent will be \nconsidered for release before the second tranche if the law on \nmicrofinance  organizations  is  ratified  by  Parliament,  and \nregulations for MFIs are approved by NBT. \n \nExecuting Agency  NBT  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  will  cooperate  on  the \nreform measures with the ministries of finance, justice, and state \nrevenues and duties. A project management unit (PMU) will be \nestablished in NBT. \n \n Procurement  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange \ncosts  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB) member countries, excluding negative listed items. ", "  v\n The Investment Loan  The objective of the investment loan is to expand the outreach \nObjectives and Scope  and sustainability of MFIs that serve MSEs and poor households \nby  transforming  unregulated  credit  programs  into  licensed, \nregulated financial institutions. The scope has four components: \n(i) legal and regulatory framework, (ii) establishment of MFIs, (iii) \ninstitutional  strengthening  of  NBT  and  MFIs,  and  (iv)  project \nmanagement.  The  scope  is  nationwide,  with  the  geographical \nfocus dependent on where the selected NGOs willing to become \nMFIs have microfinance operations. \n \n Cost Estimates and  The total cost of the investment project is $5.31 million equivalent. \nFinancing  ADB will finance $4 million equivalent from ADF resources; the \nGovernment will finance $390,000; NGOs and/or MFIs, $700,000; \nand clients/beneficiaries, $220,000. \n \n Loan Amount and Terms  A loan of SDR2.934 million ($4 million equivalent) is proposed \nfrom ADF resources. The loan will have an amortization period of \n32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest \ncharge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5 \nthereafter.  \n \n Implementation  The arrangements include the MPSC, National Bank of Tajikistan \nArrangements  (NBT), PMU, and TWG. The MPSC, chaired by NBT, will include \nrepresentatives of key government agencies, NBT, and NGOs, \nand will be responsible for overall coordination of the project and \nserve as the main forum for discussion of microfinance policy. \nNBT is the Executing Agency and will coordinate project activities, \nensure proper reporting, and serve as the focal point for ADB and \nNGOs/MFIs. NBT will appoint a project director and establish a \nPMU to implement project activities. TWG will lead in identifying \nkey issues in microfinance development and the creation of an \nenabling legal and regulatory environment; facilitate cooperation \namong key agencies and NGOs; and address operational issues \nrelated to microfinance and MFIs. \n \n Period of Utilization  The investment project will be implemented over 4 years and the \n  loan completely drawn down in 5 years. \n \n Procurement and  Procurement of goods and services will be in accordance with \nConsulting Services  ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. A total of 86 person-months of \nconsulting services/technical assistance, comprising 14 person-\nmonths  of  international  and  72  person-months  of  domestic \nexpertise,  will  be  provided  by  an  international  consulting  firm \nrecruited  in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants by ADB and its Borrowers using the quality and cost-\nbased selection method. \n Estimated Project  31 December 2007 \nCompletion Date \n   ", "vi   \nBenefits And Impact  MSDP  will  provide  an  improved  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory \nenvironment  that  will  allow  the  formalization  of  unregulated \nfinancial  activity.  An  enabling  environment  combined  with \nsubstantial capacity building will result in the transformation of \nexisting NGO microcredit programs into licensed and regulated \nMFIs. New ones may also be established to increase diversity \nwithin the financial sector. Through the licensing of at least two \ndeposit-taking MFIs, the number of borrowers will increase from \n15,000 to 38,000 in five years, and increase MFIs\u2019 loan portfolio to \n$4 million. Formalized microcredit provided through viable MFIs \nwill benefit thousands of MSEs, which rely mainly on their own \nsavings to fund their activities. With improved, constant access to \nloans, MSEs can expand, benefiting the owners and their families \ndirectly, and the broader economy indirectly. MSEs, the poor, and \nrural  dwellers  will  benefit  directly  from  accessible  facilities  to \nsafeguard savings. \n \nRisks and Safeguards  The  main  risks  facing  the  project  are  (i)  an  unstable \nmacroeconomic  environment  that  impacts  negatively  on \nsubsectors where MSEs operate, (ii) ineffective implementation of \nthe law on microfinance organizations and regulations, (iii) delays \nor difficulties in harmonizing related laws and the tax code as they \nrelate to MFIs, (iv) delays or problems in the transformation and/or \nestablishment  of  MFIs,  (v)  operational  and  financial  risks  of \nparticipating commercial banks (PCBs), and (vi) operational and \nfinancial risks of MFIs. \n \nAll  these  will  be  addressed  by  mitigating  measures.  The \nGovernment's  continued  commitment  to  reform  has  been \ndemonstrated in the Poverty Reduction Growth Facility recently \nsigned  with  the  International  Monetary  Fund.  Continued \nengagement  with  IMF  and  World  Bank,  and  an  improving \ngovernment  record  in  economic  management  are  the  key \nmitigants to risk (i). Consulting services under the investment loan \nwill  provide  expertise  and  resources  to  NBT  to  prudently \nimplement the law on microfinance organizations, and create an \neffective regulatory and supervisory regime, which will mitigate \nrisk (ii).  \n \n  The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) \nand International Finance Corporation (IFC) have signaled their \nsupport  for  Parliament\u2019s  passing  the  law  on  microfinance \norganizations, and for harmonizing it with existing laws and the tax \ncode. ", "  vii\n  The  combined  funding  resources  and  commitment  represent \nmitigating factors for risk (iii). The creation of the MPSC and TWG \nwill  provide  for  continuous  consultation  and  identification  of \ncontentious  issues,  thereby  serving  as  a  mitigant  to  risk  (iv), \nfurther mitigated by substantial ADB TA resources to transform \nMFIs.  The  commitment  of  USAID  and  IFC  to  individual  NGO \nprograms and their transformation further reduces the risk of (iv). \nPCBs\u2019  operational  and  financial  risk  will  be  mitigated  by  strict \ncriteria and performance monitoring developed under the project, \nsupported by consulting services, thus mitigating risk (v). MFIs\u2019 \noperational  and  financial  risks  referred  to  in  item  (vi)  will  be \nmitigated through training and institutional capacity building to be \nprovided to MFIs through the attached TA. Operational risk can be \nfurther mitigated by MFI borrowing on the credit line to finance the \npurchase  of  appropriate  Information  technology  systems  to \nimprove accounting and financial reporting.  \n   \nTechnical Assistance  The objective of the TA is to develop viable MFIs capable of \nserving the poor. The purpose is to strengthen the supervisory \ncapacity of NBT and the capacity of MFIs to provide microfinance \nservices efficiently and cost-effectively. The total cost of the TA is \nestimated at $776,200 equivalent, comprising local currency and \nforeign currency costs. ADB will finance $640,000 equivalent, and \nthe Government and NGOs the balance of $136,200 equivalent in \nkind. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the ADB-\nfunded TA Special Fund. ADB will recruit individual consultants in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by ADB \nand its Borrowers. \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on two proposed \nloans to the Republic of Tajikistan for the Microfinance Systems Development Program (MSDP). \nThe report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Institutional Strengthening of \nMicrofinance Systems, and if the Board approves the proposed loans, I, acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \nII.  THE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES1 \nA.  Macroeconomic Context \n2.  Since independence in 1991, Tajikistan has been in transition to a market-oriented \neconomy. The macroeconomic situation has steadily improved, with significant growth and \nstabilization supported by structural reforms.2 Economic growth gained momentum after 1997, \nalthough the Russian crisis caused a downturn in gross domestic product (GDP) growth from \n5.3% in 1998 to 3.7% in 1999. Following increased cotton and aluminum production, which \ntogether account for about two thirds of export earnings, GDP growth rebounded 8.3% in 2000, \n10.0% in 2001, and 8.0% in 2002. Inflation stabilized at 27.5% in 1999, but slid to 38.6% in 2001 \ndue to external factors and problematic implementation of monetary policy. The International \nMonetary Fund (IMF) estimates inflation to decline to 13% in 2002, and further to 5% by 2004.  \n \n3.  Tajikistan is highly dependent on foreign trade, with exports constituting 70% of GDP. \nThe external current account deficit increased from 6.6% of GDP in 2000 to 7.0% in 2001. \nGross foreign exchange reserves stood at 2.1 months of imports at the end of 2001. \n \n4.  During the May 2001 Consultative Group Meeting a financing gap of $26 million was \nestimated in the budget for 2002. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) agreed to provide \nassistance for the ongoing transition reform agenda, particularly in rural finance and agriculture. \nTajikistan has a high publicly guaranteed external debt burden equivalent to 87% of GDP, due \nto large nonconcessional bilateral borrowings. IMF imposed a debt ceiling of 3% of GDP on the \nexternally  financed  Public  Investment  Program  beginning  in  2002.  Under  the  $128-million \nPoverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF) (1999\u20132001), the Government failed to meet all its \nstructural adjustment targets and misreported external debt levels. IMF introduced a staff-\nmonitored program from October 2001. An $87-million 3-year PRGF was signed in December \n2002.  \n \n5.  Tajikistan, one of the poorest republics of the former Soviet Union (FSU), stands out as \none of the poorest countries in Asia. Despite progress made since independence, overall living \nstandards have deteriorated drastically, particularly in rural areas, due to the civil war, general \neconomic contraction, and loss of social services. Tajikistan ranks 110th among 174 states \nbased on the human development index, with an estimated per capita gross national product \n                                                 \n1\n  A project preparatory TA was not conducted for this program. However, a small-scale TA, 3555-TAJ: Support for \nRural  Financial  Systems  Development,  approved  on  6  December  2000,  helped  develop  policy,  legal,  and \nregulatory measures.

The 1999 Tajik Living Standards Survey indicates that over 80% of the 6.2 \nmillion people live in poverty, with about 30% \u201dvery poor\u201d and nearly 20% \u201dextremely poor.\u201d3  \n \n6.  Poverty in rural areas, where 75% of the people live, is more acute than in urban areas. \nThe proportion of people living in extreme poverty is 23.4% in rural areas, and 18.6% in urban \nareas. Only 56% of able-bodied citizens are formally employed, leaving nearly half the working \npopulation to look for income-generating opportunities on their own. Poor people engage in a \nnumber of such activities to make ends meet. In the poorest households, the single largest \nsource of income accounts for only a third of total household income.  \n \n7.  The  most  vulnerable  groups  include  pensioners,  the  disabled,  single-headed  family \nhouseholds, families with five or more children, teachers, doctors, and the unemployed. An \nimportant finding of the Tajik Living Standards Survey was that financial hardship is not limited \nto the poorest. Over 25% of all households have sold assets and about 33% have borrowed \nmoney to buy food. \n \n8.  Poverty has a gender dimension. While poverty incidence does not vary between men \nand women, the transition has affected women disproportionately due to (i) the collapse of the \nsocial allowance and services; (ii) women\u2019s income being four times lower than men\u2019s; (iii) \nfemale-headed households having less access to land, irrigation, and agriculture; (iv) women\u2019s \nunemployment being marginally higher than men\u2019s;4 and (v) women being employed mainly in \nthe  low-paid  sectors  such  as  agriculture,  education,  and  health.  The  Government  has  set \npoverty reduction as its primary objective, requiring a comprehensive and long-term strategy. \nThe National Poverty Reduction Strategy, endorsed by Parliament on 24 June 2002, focuses on \n(i) accelerated, socially fair, labor-intensive, and export-oriented economic growth; (ii) efficient \nand fair provision of basic social services; (iii) targeted support to the poorest groups of the \npopulation; and (iv) efficient governance and improvement in security. \n \n9.  Microfinance  reduces  poverty.  The  small  number  of  micro-  and  small  enterprises \n(MSEs), poor households, and rural dwellers who have access to microcredit have benefited \nfrom increased and stable incomes. Microfinance is limited to microcredit. Access to small loans \nprovides working capital to simple businesses that need cash. In a very poor country such as \nTajikistan, where people have little savings, credit is one of the few sources of investment \ncapital.  Microcredit  is  fueling  thousands  of  rural  MSEs,  and  its  provision  must  be \ninstitutionalized. New financial services, especially deposit taking, are also important. As MSEs \ngrow, they generate small surpluses that can be reinvested or used to meet household needs. \nCase studies from nongovernment organization (NGO) microcredit programs in Supplementary \nAppendix 1 document the positive impact of microfinance on poverty reduction.  \n \nB.  Sector Description and Performance \n1.  Banking Subsector \n10.  Tajikistan has a two-tier banking system comprising National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT, \nthe central bank); 14 commercial banks (4 of which are predominately state-owned and 10 \n                                                 \n3\n  World Bank (WB). June 2000. Republic of Tajikistan: Poverty Assessment, Report No. 20285-TJ, 29The level of \npoverty varies according to the poverty line used from 17% (using a poverty line of $1.075 a day) to 96% (using the \nminimum consumption basket) (page 18).  \n4\n  While women suffer higher unemployment (29%) than men (25%), women\u2019s share in the workforce has increased \nas men migrate for work. ", "    3 \nprivately owned); one branch of a foreign-owned bank; and two loan societies. The country has \nno stock market and only a few insurance companies. Banking sector reforms have helped \nreduce the number of banks from 27 in 1998 to 14. Minimum capital requirements were raised \nfrom $300,000 in 1996 to $1.5 million for existing banks in 2001. To obtain a license, new banks \nneed $3 million in charter capital. The banking sector continues to be dominated by four banks: \nSavingsbank,  Orionbank,5  Tajikevesheconombank,  and  Agroinvestbank,  which  together \naccounted for 85% of banking sector assets as of November 2002. Overall, the banks have a \nparticularly poor record in loan recovery: the four largest banks' nonperforming loans are equal \nto nearly 94% of their total portfolios. The smaller private banks do better, although still poorly \nby any measure, with 36% of their aggregate loan portfolios nonperforming.  \n \n11.  NBT has been strengthened but the financial position and operational efficiency of banks \nremain  weak.  The  Problem  Bank  Unit  has  been  established  in  NBT\u2019s  Bank  Supervision \nDepartment.  Under  a  restructuring  plan  Tajikbankbusiness  was  liquidated,  and \nTajikvesheconombank,  Agroinvestbank,  and  Savingsbank  are  being  restructured.  The \nremaining banks cater mostly to a small business clientele and shareholder-related interests. \nSavingsbank is wholly state owned, with other banks either completely privately owned or partly \nowned by ministries, state-owned enterprises, or state-owned farms. Only 8 of 14 banks meet \nthe $1.5-million capital requirement. The planned increase of this requirement to $3 million is \nlikely to lead to further closures. As of July 2002, 3 of 14 banks, accounting for only 12% of total \nbanking sector assets, had met all prudential requirements and on the basis of waivers provided \nby NBT. \n \n12.  In 2002 banking sector assets accounted for about 14% of GDP. The amount of lending \nto the cotton sector is estimated to be 12% of GDP (7% in 1999). Credit to the non-cotton \nprivate sector represents barely 2% of GDP. The extreme and growing concentration of lending \nto the cotton sector, given its vulnerability to external price shocks, has a predictably deleterious \neffect on system-wide loan recovery. Interest rates on commercial bank loans of 3\u20136-month \ntenor average 25-30% per annum, while the rates on 3\u20136-month term deposits are close to \n22%. The high deposit rates reflect the lack of public confidence in banks, which must offer high \nrates to the public and are, in turn, rewarded with little deposit activity. Rates on treasury bills \naverage about 15%. NBT's discount rate for loans to commercial banks was 20% in February \n2003. Loans are mainly short term.  \n \n13.  Tajikistan suffers from the lowest degree of monetization among members of FSU. The \ndeposit base of banks was close to $28 million at the end of 2001, equivalent to only 20% of \nprivate sector credits, compared to an international norm of around 120% or more. Banks \nappear to be increasing their deposit taking, reflecting increased confidence in the currency, as \nwell as positive real interest rates. The volume of Tajik workers' remittances flowing in from \nabroad  is  increasing.  Still,  the  overall  level  of  deposits  remains  low,  with  total  deposits \nequivalent to 4% of GDP.6 The banking sector has yet to prove itself capable of mobilizing \nsavings from the public and channeling loans to creditworthy borrowers.  \n \n                                                 \n5\n  The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the International Finance Corporation are \nshareholders.

Russia and Ukraine have deposits equal to nearly 20% \nof GDP.  ", "4    \n14.  The  Government  has  started  to  strengthen  confidence  in  the  banking  sector  by \n(i) increasing  the  minimum  capital  requirement  with  partial  holding  in  foreign  exchange, \n(ii) enforcing full loan loss provisioning, (iii) making loan loss provisions 100% tax deductible, \nand (iv) assessing tax liabilities of banks according to their fixed rather than total assets. \nContinued rehabilitation, restructuring, and renovation of the banking subsector are critical and \nbeing supported by the World Bank and IMF.  \n \n2.  Nongovernment Organizations and Microfinance \n15.  NGO microcredit activities commenced in 1993 with the Aga Khan Foundation (AKF) \nthrough  its  Aga  Khan  Development  Network  (AKDN).  These  programs  have  focused  on \nhumanitarian relief and poverty reduction with microcredit as a component of more diversified \nprograms.  These  NGOs  have  been  financed  by  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies,  and \ninternational NGOs, mostly on a grant basis. \n \n16.  The country\u2019s 17 microcredit programs mostly target the rural poor, mainly women and \nvulnerable groups. In most NGO microcredit programs, over 50% of clients, sometimes nearly \n100%, are women. Twelve programs include cash disbursements, and the rest provide credit in \nkind. By the end of 2001, NGO microcredit programs had disbursed cash loans of more than \n$6.6 million to 44,000 borrowers7 and had an aggregate loan portfolio of $3.0 million, with an \naverage borrower balance of $94. Around 20,000 more families receive credit in kind. The \nseven largest NGOs, each with a cash loan portfolio exceeding $100,000, account for 94% of all \nborrowers and 97% of total loans outstanding as of the end of 2001. The microfinance market is \ndominated  by  three  NGOs:  AKDN,  National  Association  of  Business  Women  in  Tajikistan \n(NABWT), and Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development (ACTED), accounting for \nnearly 80% of clients. Four NGOs (AKDN, NABWT, ACTED, and the Development Fund) \naccount for 85% of loans outstanding. Six of the larger NGOs had an aggregate 37% growth in \nclients and 79% growth in loan portfolio in 2001. While the aggregate NGO loan portfolio was \nequal to 6% of banking sector assets in 2001, it involved three times the number of households \nserved by the banking sector.  \n \n17.  NGO credit programs serve far more customers than banks by offering microloans to the \npoor. Most microlending is to groups: 95% by number of loans and 75% by loan amount. \nLending is commonly for 1\u20133 months for group-based borrowers and 12 months for individual \nborrowers. Most groups have 7\u201312 members. Individual-member loan size within groups is \nusually $20\u2013100, and for individuals, usually $300\u2013$3,000, up to $5,000. Interest rates on group \nlending are 2\u20134% per month and around 2% per month for individual lending. Most lending is \ndenominated in dollars but disbursed in somoni. Most lending is in the rural areas. Only three \nNGOs lend in urban areas, and mainly to groups. Three NGOs have achieved loan recovery \nrates higher than 98% of total lending. Loan loss rates in individual lending have been less than \nfor group lending. Unlike banks, NGO credit programs have developed a culture of repayment \namong clients. The high rates of repayment in microfinance also demonstrate that the credit \nproducts and underwriting standards and methodology used are appropriate. \n \n18.  The collection of savings is common to many group lending programs, with saved funds \naccumulated within the groups and re-lent to members. Poor rural households, in groups, save \nTJS0.5\u20132.0 ($0.08\u20132.0) each per month. For wealthier households, savings of TJS20 ($8.00) \nper month per person are common. One program has more than $53,000 in voluntary savings, \nand another, more than $15,000 in compulsory savings. \n                                                 \n7\nConsultative Group on Assisting the Poorest (CGAP). 2002. Microfinance Sector Assessment. Tajikistan. ", "    5 \n \n19.  Most  NGOs  serve  more  than  one  region.  Khatlon  accounts  for  47%  of  borrowers. \nCoverage, calculated as total borrowers divided by total households, is 5.3% in Khatlon, 4.6% in \nRepublican Subordination,  1.2%  in  Sughd,  and  30%  in  Gorno-Badakhshan  through  village \norganizations serviced by the AKDN. Loans outstanding from all NGOs total $600,000\u2013900,000 \nper region, underlining the relative lack of NGO credit programs throughout the country. \n \nC.  Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Viable and Sustainable Institutions \n20.  Tajikistan  has  a  relatively  young,  underdeveloped,  and  inefficient  financial  sector \ndominated by a few banks. The banking subsector and the smaller set of unlicensed and \nunregulated  NGOs  together  are  unable  to  meet  the  demand  for  basic  financial  services. \nDemand for financial services of all kinds is vast and unmet. Rural enterprises and farming \nhouseholds, which often engage in a variety of income-generating on- and off-farm activities, \nhave little access to credit due to limited funds, perceived high risk of agriculture activity, and \nhigh administration costs in making small loans. Savings mobilization, particularly in rural areas, \nis almost nonexistent.  \n \n21.  Assuming that 20% of rural and 10% of urban households make up the market for \nmicrofinance, at least 150,000 households, or nearly five times the present combined outreach \nof all NGO microcredit programs, could benefit from microfinance. Most rural households are \nwithout access to deposit services. Based on trends registered in the past two years by NGOs, \nan annual growth rate of 17.5% in numbers of households would yield an outreach of 150,000 \nhouseholds in 10 years. Satisfying projected loan demand, assuming small individual loans of \n$50\u2013300, would require $25 million in new lending. Aggregate NGO microlending for 2001 was \n$3 million. Achieving an average household savings balance of $30 per year for 300,000 rural \nhouseholds would provide a rural savings balance of $9 million, an amount equal to total \ndomestic currency deposits held by banks in 2000. Financial service providers need to be \nencouraged to intensify efforts to provide services to this large potential market. \n \n22.  Viable and sustainable financial institutions capable of providing basic financial services \nto  the  public  are  almost  completely  lacking.  None  of  the  NGOs  have  achieved  financial \nsustainability. Inadequate accounting, portfolio, and management information systems reflect \nweak  governance  and  internal  control.  Financial  intermediation  activities  are  inadequately \nseparated from social ones with regard to financial reporting and staffing. The range of financial \nproducts is limited. The present volume of business is insufficient to allow for full cost recovery \non operations and the creation of an equity base out of profits. Focus on organizational and \nfinancial planning is lacking. Recently, however, three NGOs have begun to become more \ncommercialized and specialized microfinance institution (MFIs) through (i) separation of head \noffice from branch operations, (ii) adoption of new charts of accounts to produce financial \nstatements that relate only to microfinance activities, (iii) a search for appropriate accounting \nand management software, (iv) reorganization of departments and reallocation of staff, (v) \nimprovements in internal controls (particularly internal audit), (vi) separation of oversight from \noperational functions, and (vii) a search for appropriate forms of legal entity and ownership. \n \n23.  For  all  their  limitations,  NGOs  are  providing  the  bulk  of  rural  financial  services. \nSubstantial trust already exists between NGOs and their customers, which is a sound basis for \noperation  expansion.  While  NGO  programs  have  institutional  weaknesses,  many  are  now \nexamining ways to become commercially viable. Funds to expand lending, however, will need to ", "6    \ncome from a balanced mix of deposit mobilization, borrowings, and equity capital, which will \nonly be attracted by an appropriate institutional form, maintenance of a well-performing loan \nportfolio, and close and responsive ties with communities. Market demand assumes financial \ngrowth and customer outreach far in excess of the grant resources and/or loan financing likely \nto  be  made  available  to  NGOs  from  international  or  other  external  sources.  Therefore, \nintervention is warranted to develop a sustainable microfinance sector to expand access by the \npoor and rural dwellers to financial services.  \n \n2.  Policy on Microfinance \n24.  The enabling environment for microfinance suffers from the absence of defined policies \nand mechanisms, hindering NGO microcredit programs from becoming commercially viable \nproviders of diversified financial services. The Government aims to create a formal microfinance \nsector,  in  which  some  NGO  microcredit  programs  will  be  transformed  into  licensed  and \nregulated MFIs. The development policy letter (Appendix 3) indicates the Government's strong \nsupport for the creation of a new, fully regulated financial subsector free of the enormous \nproblems of the banks, and targeting most of the population with basic financial services. The \npolicy  letter  recognizes  the  Government's  responsibility  to  establish  an  enabling  legal  and \nregulatory environment for microfinance and encourages NGOs to become regulated MFIs.  \n \n3.  Existing Legislation \n25.  NGOs are registered under the Law on Public Organizations, which applies only to \nNGOs supported by external funding. The Law on State Registration of Juridical Persons and \nLaw on Joint Stock Companies cover the registration of various commercial and noncommercial \nentities, which depends on the form of organization and ownership. Individuals and enterprises, \nhowever, are required to register as a juridical person, and both are assumed to make a profit \nand so are subject to a variety of taxes. Registration as a noncommercial entity, which would \nlogically mean being exempt from profit or income tax (but not necessarily from other taxes), is \ngenerally  not  allowed.  Given  the  changing  status  of  legislation  for  registration,  and  the \nimplications of registering as a commercial or noncommercial entity, it is not clear under which \nlaws NGO credit programs should operate.  \n \n26.  Licensing of financial institutions is the responsibility of NBT. Whether NGOs operating \nmicrocredit programs should also be registered and licensed with NBT is unclear. As NGOs and \nMFIs will operate varying microfinance programs involving different levels of deposit, credit, and \ntransfer services, a classification system of various microfinance organizations with relevant \nregistration and licensing requirements and procedures is required. \n \n27.  NGOs  operating  microcredit  programs  now  do  so  largely  under  international \nagreements, thereby removing them from most legislation, including the Tax Code. But the legal \nand regulatory environment focuses on banks and does not provide for the legal establishment \nand  operation  of  NGO  microcredit  programs  and  potential  MFIs.  Laws  do  not  specifically \nrecognize MFIs. They operate differently from other financial institutions, particularly commercial \nbanks, and the legislation needs to reflect these differences.8  \n \n28.  The  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)  and  International \nFinance Corporation (IFC), in close consultation with ADB, support the drafting of the law on \n                                                 \n8\n  MFIs differ from commercial banks in that customer transactions are smaller, borrowers are less diverse, the range \nof financial products is limited, and MFIs usually do not clear checks. ", "    7 \nmicrofinance organizations (microfinance law). The draft is being circulated to stakeholders for \ncomment to define the issues related to the legal framework of NGO credit programs and MFIs. \n \n29.  In 1999 the new Tax Code was introduced. The country has 17 national and local taxes. \nAlthough the code is comprehensive, assessment and frequency of collection are variable. \nBesides  efforts  to  draft  a  comprehensive  law  regularizing  and  governing  MFI  operations, \ndisparate elements of the code that affect, or potentially affect, MFIs should be harmonized.  \n \n4.  Regulation and Supervision \n30.  While  the  reform  measures  have  reduced  the  number  of  banks,  ongoing  bank \nrestructurings still burden the 32 NBT Supervision Department staff members, who must resolve \nissues of bank liquidations, bank mergers, and recapitalization; oversee installation and use of \ninternational  accounting  standards  (IAS)  in  all  banks;  improve  off-  and  on-site  monitoring \nsystems and procedures; and deal with continuing financial and management weaknesses of \nremaining banks. Supervision is made more difficult by the large number of bank branches \n(130) and representative offices (over 130). To supervise MFIs, NBT will need more resources \nand staff, who will require intensive training. Staff will need to develop regulations for MFIs, \nlicense them, review and analyze regular reports received from them, and inspect them on site \nto enforce compliance with regulations.  \n \nD.  Lessons Learned \n31.  ADB has considerable experience with microfinance operations in several countries but \nlimited experience in the FSU transition economies, particularly in transforming NGO microcredit \nprograms into licensed and regulated MFIs. MSDP will be ADB\u2019s first experience with a broad \nsector  development  program  in  a  transition  economy.9  Lessons  are  drawn  from  ADB\u2019s \nexperience in rural finance from transition economies, and from transformation operations in \nother countries. \n \n32.  The lessons10 highlight the importance of (i) following a financial systems development \napproach to provide an enabling environment for commercial microfinance, (ii) focusing on poor \nclients to reduce poverty, (iii) working within the capacity of participating financial institutions to \nminimize distraction from their main functions and to avoid raising their administrative costs, and \n(iv) maximizing the impact of capacity building by providing TA over a period of time and not as \nan isolated instance. Because rural financial markets consist of different market segments with \nmarkedly diverse characteristics, a multiagency approach is necessary to meet different sectors\u2019 \ndemand for financial services.  \n \n33.  ADB has two ongoing projects to establish savings and credit union systems in the \nKyrgyz Republic and Mongolia.11 Key lessons include the following:  \n \n \n                                                 \n9\n ADB\u2019s  sector  development  operations  in  microfinance  were  Loans  1805-PAK(SF):  Microfinance  Sector \nDevelopment Program, for $70 million; and 1806-PAK: Microfinance Sector Development Project, for $80 million, \napproved on 13 December 2000. \n10\n ADB.

Some essential lessons are to be learned from the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural \nCooperatives Thailand, Village Bank (Unit Desa) of Bank Rakyat Indonesia, and the Grameen \nBank Bangladesh. All are widely regarded as successful based on the criteria of outreach and \nself-sustainability12  due  to  (i)  favorable  macroeconomic,  agricultural,  and  rural  policies; \n(ii) adequate  investment  in  physical  and  social  rural  infrastructure;  (iii)  high  degree  of \nmanagement autonomy in operational policy formulation; (iv) staff policies that stress training, \naccountability, and reward through monetary incentives and promotion; (v) innovative, low-cost \ndistribution systems, and mobile banking; (vi) innovative and flexible loan terms and conditions; \n(vii) close monitoring of loan performance, high collection rates, and low arrears; (viii) domestic \nsavings mobilization as a growing source of funds, diminishing or eliminating the need for aid; \n(ix)  real  positive  and  often  relatively  high  on-lending  interest  rates  covering  costs;  and \n(x) administrative expense control. \n \n35.  In  recent  years  a  number  of  NGOs  have  been  transformed  into  fully  licensed  and \nregulated MFIs providing microcredit services: CARD Bank in the Philippines, Association of \nCambodian Local Economic Development Agencies, Bancosol in Bolivia, and XAC Bank in \nMongolia.  The  key  factors  to  the  success  of  their  transformation  include  (i)  a  visionary \nmanagement team, (ii) comprehensive staff development programs, (iii) adoption of accounting \npolicies and practices based upon international standards, (iv) new management information \nsystems to meet reporting requirements of regulators and/or supervisors and to track loans; and \n(v) development of new products and processes to meet demand. \n \n36.  The lessons have been incorporated into the design of MSDP and, where possible, \nreinforced through the policy loan, investment loan, and TA. The design is flexible to allow \nintroduction of the best practices during implementation. \n \nE.  International Assistance and Coordination13 \n37.  NGO microcredit programs have been receiving international assistance from United \nNations agencies; World Bank, through the Tajik Social Investment Fund (TASIF); European \nUnion and member partners and organizations; USAID, through Mercy Corps International and \nEurasia Foundation; AKF; ACTED; and CARE International. \n \n38.  Interest in microfinance development in Tajikistan is increasing as evidenced by the \nparticipation at the inaugural funding agency meeting14 on microfinance on 7 February 2002, in \n                                                 \n12\n Yaron, Jacon, Benjamin McDonald Jr., and Gerda Piprek. 1996.

Several multilateral, bilateral, and international NGO agencies expressed interest in \nsupporting legal and regulatory reform, capacity building, and provision of credit. About $16 \nmillion  was  estimated  to  be  provided  over  the  next  several  years.  Besides  ADB,  the  key \nagencies include the World Bank, USAID, IFC, Islamic Development Bank (IDB) AKF, United \nNations  Development  Programme  (UNDP),  Eurasia  Foundation,  Soros  Foundation,  and \ninternational NGOs. \n \n39.  The  World  Bank  is  providing  support  through  four  projects.  Under  the  Second \nAdjustment Credit, approved in 2001 for $35 million, the Government is adopting a wide-ranging \nreform  package  that  includes  strengthening  the  financial  sector  through  improved  banking \nsupervision, disclosure, and better tax treatment of banks. The Farm Privatization Support \nProject, approved in 1999, includes a component to pilot rural savings and credit associations in \nselected provinces to serve newly created private family farms. Support is provided for start-up \ncapital; a credit line for on-lending; the development of rules, regulations, and registration \nrequirements; and training in supervision of NBT staff. This scheme has just commenced. The \nSecond  Poverty  Alleviation  Project15  includes  $1.4  million  to  build  the  capacity  of  the \nmicrofinance unit in TASIF (to be renamed National Social Investment Fund of Tajikistan) and \neligible MFIs, and provide a credit line to MFIs. The Financial Institution and Enterprise Support \nProject  is  scheduled  for  approval  in  late  2002.  It  aims  to  (i)  improve  the  regulatory  and \nenforcement mechanism for the evolution of competitive financial institutions; and (ii) develop a \nsustainable institutional mechanism for the provision of short-, medium-, and long-term credits \nfor micro-, small, medium-sized, and large enterprises, and carry out case-by-case privatization. \n \n40.  IFC, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the Swiss Secretariat for \nEconomic Affairs are providing a $155-million initiative primarily for lending to support the \nbanking sector in Central Asia, including Tajikistan, and to lend to MSEs. Banks will benefit from \na TA program to strengthen their lending and operational capacity. \n \n41.  USAID is financing NGO credit programs. In conjunction with IFC, USAID has expanded \nits activities beyond credit to legal reforms and capacity development. In July 2002 USAID \nsigned an agreement to work with NBT to (i) draft a microfinance law, (ii) prepare related \nexplanatory  notes,  and  (iii)  prepare  a  draft  law  on  changes  and  amendments  to  several \nlegislative acts. The first draft of the microfinance law has been circulated for review and \ndiscussion, and is hoped to be approved by NBT and submitted for legislative action before \nJune 2003. Besides supporting legal reforms and existing NGO microcredit programs, USAID \nrecently launched a new microcredit program in the Ferghana Valley as part of the Regional \nMicrolending Program in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. ACDI/VOCA will provide technical and \nfinancial assistance to the newly established Microentrepreneur Development Support Center of \nTajikistan over the next four years to reach 10,000 self-employed individuals. The center is \nexpected to be a technically and financially sustainable microlending institution. \n \n42.  IDB is proposing to provide $1.1 million commencing in 2003 for three years to increase \nthe access of the rural and urban poor and the \"unbankable\", particularly women, to appropriate \nand reliable microfinance services.16 The project includes a credit line of $700,000 for two \nNGOs (Sitorai Najot and NABWT); and funds for capacity building, external audit, and a project \nimplementation unit.  \n                                                 \n15\nThe Pilot Poverty Alleviation Project was the first major multilateral support to NGOs.

AKDN has two programs with microfinance components and might consolidate these \nprograms under a microfinance bank, which will be established under the banking laws and \nprovide a large range of financial services and broad geographical outreach. A branch network \nwill be established and target underserved populations in urban and rural areas, and lend retail \nto individuals and groups, and wholesale to village organizations, small MFIs, and financial \ncooperatives. Products will be developed to fit the needs of the clientele, with a focus on \nbuilding a sound deposit basis. The timing for the establishment of the bank is not firm but is \nanticipated in the next 12 months. \n \n44.  UN agencies and international NGOs are expected to provide financial and TA support \nfor  several  existing  microcredit  programs.  The  Soros  Foundation  has  supported  legislative \nreform, and will continue to do so, focusing on microfinance legislation and capacity building for \nMFIs. The Eurasia Fund will continue to support training in microfinance. Future international \nassistance  to  NGOs  is  expected  to  focus  on  skills  training,  support  for  the  startup  and \ndevelopment of NGO programs in new locations, support for the continuing development of \nNGO systems, and lines of credit. The surge in external funding, however, will be of lasting \nbenefit only if it supports the creation of sound and commercially viable MFIs. \n \n45.  While substantial resources are required to build the microfinance industry, and funding \nagencies have expressed a strong desire to help, coordination among them is also important. \nThey thus meet and are in constant communication. At the first funding agency meeting in \nFebruary  2002,  they  agreed  that  ADB  would  lead  in  developing  the  legal  and  regulatory \nframework. The lead role in drafting the microfinance law then passed to USAID and IFC.  \n \nF.  Rationale \n46.  Tajikistan has a young and underdeveloped financial sector that cannot meet demand \nfor basic financial services. NGOs provide the bulk of financial services, particularly in rural \nareas. NGOs have already trained a large number of groups of rural people in basic lending \nservices, and to a more limited extent, in savings modalities. NGOs and Government, however, \nneed to develop the capacity to manage and regulate formal MFIs. The policy, legal, regulatory, \nand institutional environment is not appropriate to MFIs, which will thus be unable to reach \nsignificant  scale  and  provide  financial  services  reliably  and  in  a  sustainable  manner. \nGovernment and externally provided funds are insufficient to meet demand for microcredit. \nInstitutional capacity to deliver financial services on a sustainable basis, including deposit-taking \nservices, is needed. MSDP recognizes that the bulk of MFI resources must come from the \neconomy as savings mobilization stimulated through sound, sustainable, and regulated MFIs. \nTherefore, an enabling environment is essential, as is the capacity of NGOs to be transformed \ninto viable MFIs. \n \n47.  To foster growth, innovation, and diversity of financial institutions, including MFIs, a \ncomprehensive financial systems development approach is required. It is in accordance with \nADB\u2019s microfinance development strategy.17 The proposed MSDP is in line with the four pillars \nof  this  strategy:  (i)  creating  an  enabling  policy  environment;  (ii)  improving  the  financial \ninfrastructure, specifically the legal and regulatory environment; (iii) building the institutional \nstrength of MFIs to enhance their sustainability and outreach; and (iv) encouraging innovative \nprograms that support the poor.  \n \n                                                 \n17\n ADB. 2000. Finance for the Poor: Microfinance Development Strategy. Manila. ", "    11 \nIII.  THE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Program Objectives and Scope \n48.  The goal of MSDP is to create a strong, commercially viable microfinance sector. The \npurpose is to establish a regulated microfinance market in which MSEs and poor households \nhave access to financial products provided through sustainable MFIs. The program framework \nis in Appendix 2. \n \n49.  The components include (i) the adoption of policy, regulatory, and institutional actions to \ndevelop a microfinance industry; (ii) capacity building for NBT to regulate and supervise MFIs, \nand  for  NGOs  to  become  formally  licensed  and  regulated  MFIs;  and  (iii)  an  investment \ncomponent  piloting  the  transformation  of  selected  NGO  microcredit  programs  into  formally \nlicensed and regulated MFIs. \n \nB.  Special Features \n50.  MSDP will take steps to develop microfinance in Tajikistan. ADB and the Government \nrecognize the important role that existing NGO microcredit programs can play in developing \nfinancial markets. Specifically, MSDP will help the Government establish a comprehensive \npolicy,  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  framework  to  develop  a  viable  and  sustainable \nindustry. This is of particular importance in a country recently emerging from civil war, while \nadopting a reform agenda to move to a market-oriented system, where an enabling environment \nfor microfinance does not yet exist. This is the first time ADB will take such a comprehensive \napproach in a transition economy (footnote 9). \n \n51.  MSDP is also involved with NGOs and their transformation into licensed and regulated \nMFIs.  Several  NGO  credit  programs  have  already  been  transformed  into  formal  financial \ninstitutions.  While  ADB  has  supported  various  microfinance  programs,  including  the \nestablishment of NGO microcredit programs, Grameen replicators, and creation of savings and \ncredit unions systems, ADB has not exclusively focused on transforming NGOs into formal \nMFIs. These special features require a consultative and flexible approach, involving all key \nstakeholders.  \n \nC.  The Policy Loan \n52.  The policy loan requires the Government to implement a set of agreed-on measures to \nimprove the operating environment for existing NGO microcredit programs and their subsequent \ntransformation into licensed and regulated MFIs. The Government\u2019s development policy letter \nand a policy matrix are in Appendixes 3 and 4, respectively. \n \n1.  Objectives \n53.  The purpose of the MSDP policy loan is to create a legal, regulatory, and supervisory \nenvironment  that  supports  the  development  of  a  strong,  commercially  viable  microfinance \nsector. This environment will allow for the establishment, operation, and growth of a diversified \nrange of institutions offering microfinance services. These institutions could include those that \nare (i) unregistered and unregulated, (ii) accredited and nonprudentially supervised, and (iii) \nformally licensed and prudentially supervised. \n ", "12    \n2.  Components and Outputs \n54.  The policy loan has four components, outlined below with their expected outputs and \nsummarized in a policy matrix (Appendix 4), which identifies monitoring mechanisms, identifies \nresponsible agencies, and lists an implementation time frame. \n \na.  Policy and Strategy \n55.  A government policy and strategy for microfinance development will provide a framework \nto establish an enabling environment. Policy and strategy should be comprehensive and include \na sector agenda. The Government has submitted a policy letter to ADB as a condition for first \ntranche release. The Government will keep ADB informed of policy discussions with other \nmultilateral and bilateral aid agencies that might have an impact on the program, and will \nprovide  ADB  with  an  opportunity  to  comment  on  any  resulting  policy  proposals.  The \nGovernment will consider ADB\u2019s  views before finalizing and implementing any such proposals. \n \nb.  Legal Environment \n56.  A number of laws will require revision to provide an appropriate framework to support the \nestablishment and development of microfinance institutions. Under ADB TA 3555 (footnote 1) a \nlegal specialist with a team of NBT staff reviewed the relevant legislation and identified a \nprogram  for  change.  Further  discussion  with  Government,  NBT,  NGOs,  and  other  funding \nagencies established the following requirements: \n \n57.  Classification  of  Microfinance  Institutions.  A  classification  of  MFIs  should  be \ndeveloped to clarify the status of all NGO microcredit programs and future MFIs, and issues \nrelated to registration and licensing, plus applicable legal and regulatory requirements. The draft \nmicrofinance  law  prepared  by  the  USAID/IFC  team  distinguishes  a  range  of  institutions \nproviding  MF  services  and  establishes  the  legal  basis  for  (i)  microcredit  foundations,  and \nregistered  NGO  microcredit  programs  that  make  microloans  with  funding  agencies  funds; \n(ii) microlending  companies,  which  are  licensed  and  registered,  have  commercial  funding \nsources but do not take deposits, and make microloans; and (iii) microcredit deposit companies, \nwhich take deposits from the public and make microloans.  \n \n58.  Adoption of a Microfinance Law. The draft law is being circulated for comment among \nstakeholders, including ADB, and is expected to be submitted to Parliament for approval by \nJune 2003. The draft law does not consider cooperatives, so a separate law on cooperatives will \nlikely be necessary. \n \n59.  Harmonizing of the Draft Microfinance Law with Relevant Laws. The final enactment \nof a microfinance law will require amendments to laws on the national bank of Tajikistan and on \nbanks and banking activities to (i) provide for the taking of savings deposits for MFIs from \nborrowers, members, and the public; (ii) clarify the application of the provision on licensing; and \n(iii) harmonize the microfinance law with other legislation. MSDP consulting services will ensure \nthat the draft law is harmonized with relevant laws.  \n \n60.  Review of the Tax Code. It will be reviewed and amended to include MFIs and provide \nfor a fair tax regime appropriate to their objectives and activities.  \n \n61.  New legislation is being developed and existing laws reviewed and revised through a \nconsultative process involving all key stakeholders, including relevant government agencies ", "    13 \nsuch  as  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  Ministry  of  Justice  (MOJ),  NBT,  NGOs  engaged  in \nmicrofinance, and funding agencies. \n \nc.  Regulation and Supervision \n62.  NBT regulations 83 and 84, and draft resolution 19 provide for the registration, licensing, \nand regulation of loan societies and nonbank financial institution generally. These regulations \nwill be superseded by those to be drafted pursuant to the draft law. It provides a suitable \ngeneral framework to establish MFIs, lays out operational parameters, and tasks the NBT to \ndevelop regulations and supervise MFIs. A comprehensive set of prudential and nonprudential \nregulations, readily available to institutions and the public, will be prepared for all institutions \nproviding  microfinance  services.  The  regulations  should  include  the  following:  entry \nrequirements,  ownership  restrictions,  minimum  capital  and  capital  adequacy  requirements, \nreserves and loan loss provisioning, requirements for loan security, an asset classification \nscheme,  limitations  on  risk  concentration,  liquidity  reserve  requirements,  management \nqualifications and similar requirements, limitations on types of financial services authorized, \ninternal supervision requirements, audit requirements, and external supervision.  \n \n63.  NBT has limited resources as the sole regulatory agency. It must, however, develop the \ncapacity to supervise licensed and regulated MFIs. Such capacity will include effective off-site \nmonitoring systems that fit with a set of performance indicators and provide early warning of \npotential  problems,  and  systems  and  procedures,  accompanied  by  manuals,  for  on-site \nsupervision. The MSDP investment loan component will help build such capacity. \n \nd.  Institutional Environment \n64.  An  effective  regulatory  and  supervisory  regime  should  be  developed  through  a \nconsultative process involving policymakers and practitioners. Institutions should be established \nto oversee the development of the microfinance sector, including a microfinance policy steering \ncommittee (MPSC), and Government, NBT and NGO technical working group (TWG). For \ndetails of the composition and purpose of these two institutions, see paras. 95 and 99. \n \n65.  If the policy, legal, and regulatory environment is supportive of MFIs, then NGOs should \nrespond positively. Operating licenses are expected to be issued to at least two deposit-taking \nMFIs before the end of the program. \n \n3.  Amount of Loan, Terms, and Sources of Funds \n66.  It is proposed that ADB lend the Borrower SDR2,934,000 ($4 million equivalent) from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The loan will have an amortization period of 24 years, including \na grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% \nthereafter. The Borrower will not relend the proceeds of the program loan. The funds will be \ntransferred from ADB to the Borrower in tranches. The policy loan proceeds will be used to \nfinance the foreign exchange cost of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, \nexcluding listed ineligible items (Appendix 5). The counterpart funds will be used to finance the \nlocal currency costs relating to the implementation of certain programs and other activities \nconsistent with the program objectives. \n ", "14    \n4.  Implementation Arrangements \n67.  Supported by the MPSC, NBT will be the executing agency and cooperate with MOF, \nMOJ,  Office  of  the  President,  and  Ministry  of  State  Revenue  and  Duties  (MSRD)  on  the \nmeasures to be implemented. The MPSC will be chaired by a representative from NBT and will \ninclude representatives from MOF, MOJ, MSRD, and Office of the President. The MPSC will \nmeet at least quarterly to (i) ensure that the policies and actions in connection with the program \nset out in the policy letter and policy matrix are carried out on schedule; (ii) provide interagency \ncoordination on important policy, legal, and regulatory issues related to the establishment and \noperation of MFIs; and (iii) facilitate the coordination and cooperation among the Government, \nNBT, NGOs, and funding agencies. NBT will have overall responsibility for (i) implementing the \nprogram, (ii) ensuring that reform measures are undertaken in line with the agreed-on timetable, \n(iii)  initiating  withdrawals  under  the  loan,  and  (iv)  allocating  and  monitoring  the  use  of \ncounterpart funds. A project management unit (PMU) established in NBT will support ADB\u2019s \ninvestment component and submit quarterly progress reports to ADB.  \n \na.  Procurement and Disbursement  \n68.  Policy loan proceeds will be used to finance foreign exchange cost of items produced \nand  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  listed  ineligible  items  (Appendix  5) \nDisbursement will be in accordance with the simplified disbursement procedures and related \nrequirements for program loans. The Borrower will certify that (i) if loan proceeds finance goods \nalready imported, the value of eligible imports in the period concerned will exceed the amount of \nthe requested withdrawal; or (ii) if the loan proceeds finance items to be imported, the value of \neligible imports in the immediately preceding one-year period will be equal to or greater than the \namount of the requested withdrawal plus all other amounts expected to be withdrawn during the \nsucceeding one-year period. ADB will retain the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to \nverify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certificate. Before withdrawal, the Borrower will open a \ndeposit account with a bank to be agreed on with ADB in which all funds will be deposited. The \naccount will be managed in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB. \n \nb.  Monitoring and Tranching   \n69.  The policy loan will be released in two tranches. The first, $1.5 million equivalent, will be \nreleased upon loan effectiveness, before which the Government must initiate certain institutional \nand policy actions to demonstrate its commitment to reform: (i) release the policy statement on \nmicrofinance,  (ii)  issue  a  presidential  decree  establishing  the  MPSC,  and  (iii)  issue  a \npresidential decree establishing the TWG. \n \n70.  The Government will ensure that NBT (i) monitors the implementation of the program \nand its impacts, and (ii) submits to ADB  quarterly reports on the implementation of the policy \nmatrix, including accomplishment of the measures set forth in the policy letter and policy matrix. \nThe Borrower and ADB will review the implementation of the Program every six months, and \nassess the impact of all relevant reforms in the financial and social security sectors, labor \nmarkets, and the economy in general.  \n \n71.  ADB will undertake an interim review of MSDP before the release of the second tranche. \nIt will be $2.5 million equivalent and is expected to be released within 24 months of the effective \ndate, provided that (i) the Government will have enacted the draft law; (ii) in close consultation \nwith  ADB,  MPSC,  and  TWG,  the  Government  will  have  reviewed  and  amended  the  tax \nlegislation to establish a taxation environment supportive of the establishment and development ", "    15 \nof  MFIs;  (ii)  the  Government  will  have  caused  NBT  to  develop  and  adopt  prudential  and \nnonprudential regulations to supervise diversified categories of MFIs; and (iv) NBT will have \nissued operating licenses to at least two deposit-taking MFIs.  \n \n72.  ADB will also consider the provision of an incentive tranche of $1 million equivalent to be \nreleased up to six months before the second tranche if the draft law has been ratified by \nParliament, and regulations for MFIs approved by NBT. \n \nD.  Investment Loan \n1.  Objectives \n73.  The purpose of the MSDP investment loan is to expand the outreach and sustainability \nof MFIs serving MSEs and poor households by transforming unregulated credit programs to \nlicensed, regulated financial institutions. By the end of the project it is expected that (i) at least \ntwo deposit-taking MFIs will be operating in full compliance with all regulatory requirements; (ii) \nMFI outreach will have increased by 100%, with about 75% of clients being initially poor, and \n50% being women; (iii) MFI savings deposits will reach about 10% of loans outstanding; (iv) MFI \nloans outstanding will reach about TJS9 million ($3.5 million); and (v) MFI loan losses will be \nless than 4%. \n \n2.  Components and Outputs \n74.  The project scope has four components: (i) regulatory framework, (ii) establishment of \nMFIs,  (iii)  institutional  strengthening,  and  (iv)  project  management.  The  project  scope  is \nnationwide, with geographical focus on locations where selected NGOs willing to transform to \nMFIs have existing microfinance programs. \n \na.  Regulatory Framework \n75.  A legal and regulatory environment favorable to MFI operations is a prerequisite to the \nformation of legally registered and licensed MFIs. By agreement, USAID and IFC are providing \nTA to prepare the draft law. Through this component, ADB will focus on developing regulations \nand  increasing  community  awareness  of  all  laws  and  regulations,  and  MFI  activities. \nRegulations will be prepared through a consultative process with key stakeholders, largely \nconducted through the TWG, comprising Government, NBT and NGO representatives (para. \n99).  \nb.  Establishment of Microfinance Institution \n76.  In parallel with the development of a favorable legal and regulatory environment, the \nproject will focus on the transformation of selected NGO microcredit programs into licensed and \nregulated MFIs. The project will work with existing NGO credit programs that have (i) registered \nas a local NGO, (ii) at least three years experience in Tajikistan providing credit, (iii) at least one \nyear\u2019s experience in delivering cash credit to groups and/or individuals, (iv) loan losses of less \nthan 4%, and (v) a willingness and capacity to meet the licensing and regulation requirements to \nbe defined by NBT regulations. These and other criteria for selecting NGO programs will be \nsubject to government and ADB approval. Graduation programs for selected NGO programs will \nbe developed. \n \n77.  The project will work with selected NGOs to establish institutional forms. NGOs will \nbecome either shareholder-owned institutions or member-owned institutions such as savings ", "16    \nand credit unions. With advice and assistance from the project, NGOs will decide on the type of \ninstitutional form to adopt. The project will help NGOs prepare business plans, strategies, \nsystems and procedures, and operating standards to transform and operate an MFI. During \ntransformation, NGOs will provide regularly updated reports on their operations, performance, \nand status of transformation. Financial and management reporting and internal controls will be \nconsistent with Consultative Group on Assisting the Poorest (CGAP) guidelines. \n \n78.  Once the MFI is licensed it will be eligible for a credit line initially for one year and \nsubsequently for up to 10 years, depending on performance, subject to credit-line participation \ncriteria specified below. MFIs will also have to develop diversified savings and loan products \nand other services. As the project will focus on savings, it will emphasize development of at \nleast two savings products such as passbook accounts and term deposits for all MFIs.  \n \n79.  The project will also explore promoting and establishing microfinance services in rural \nareas through commercial banks. The possibility of a partner arrangement between MFIs and a \ncommercial bank will be considered. \n \n80.  Established MFIs will be in the early stage of developing credit and savings services. \nMFIs will have little credibility with commercial banks and may have difficulty obtaining financing \nthrough them. Since deposit mobilization must be backed by adequate liquidity or access to \nliquidity, appropriate liquidity mechanisms are required. To provide sufficient liquidity under \nnormal operations, MFIs will be expected to hold a portion of their assets in near-liquid form, \nprobably on term deposit with a reputable bank. So that sufficient funds are available for \nunexpected customer withdrawals, a pilot liquidity guarantee fund (LGF) should be established \nto provide short-term funds to MFIs on terms similar to the refinance facility provided through \nNBT for commercial banks. An LGF of $100,000 equivalent will be financed in equal parts by \nthe Government/NBT and ADB.  \n \n81.  To be eligible to draw down against LGF, MFIs must comply with NBT regulations and \nmaintain standard levels of liquidity before the need for funds. Based on the amount of savings \nand paid-up capital, the amount an MFI can draw on will be limited, with a draw-down up to 90 \ndays. LGF should be able to make funds available within 24 hours. LGF operational procedures \nwill  be  prepared  and  agreed  on  by  the  Government/NBT,  ADB,  and  NGOs/MFIs.  Further \ndevelopment or dissolution will be agreed on at project completion. \n \nc.  Institutional Strengthening \n82.  While NGOs have been operating credit programs in Tajikistan since 1995, Government \nand NGOs have limited experience in supervising and operating MFIs. Before, during, and after \nNGO programs become MFIs, relevant training must be provided to NBT and NGOs/MFIs.  \n83.  While NBT has experience in supervising banks, it does not have the capacity and \nexpertise to supervise MFIs. Their supervision will be the responsibility of the Supervision \nDepartment  for  banks.  To  strengthen  NBT,  the  project  will  support  the  establishment  of \nsupervision  capacity  by  hiring  two  more  staff;  providing  training  in  accounting,  legal,  and \nregulatory issues, and on-site supervision of MFIs; and providing a study course abroad in \nmicrofinance and supervision. Supervision methods will be reviewed and modified for MFIs. \nNew procedures will be introduced and operating manuals prepared. NBT will then be expected \nto effectively monitor MFIs off site and supervise them on site. ", "    17 \n84.  The transformation of NGO programs into MFIs will require substantial training to ensure \nthat staff have the capability to manage and operate a licensed and fully regulated financial \ninstitution. Head office staff, branch managers, and field supervisors will have to be trained in a \nrange of areas. At the field level, training will be on the job and supported by operation manuals. \nNGOs have their own approaches to training but all training must provide staff with the skills \nrequired. The project will support the preparation of operating procedures and manuals, and \nassess approaches for a system of incentive payments for good staff performance. \n85.  Training  courses  will  be  organized  following  an  annual  consultation  by  the  training \nspecialist to determine the progressive needs of MFIs. The courses will include asset/liability \nmanagement  and  risk  identification  and  mitigation;  product  development  and  pricing;  staff \nmanagement,  performance  measurement,  and  provision  of  incentives;  loan  portfolio \nmanagement; and governance and internal controls. Each course will last 6\u201312 days, have 15\u2013\n20 participants, and will cover 120 trainees. MFIs will meet the travel and per diem costs of the \nparticipants. The courses will be conducted by project staff or other experienced microfinance \npractitioners. Two workshops a year will be held for all MFI field staff and their managers and \nsupervisors. While training will focus on MFIs progressing to licensing and regulation to take \ndeposits, other MFIs will also be eligible to participate in domestic training programs. \nd.  Project Management \n86.  The  project  will  provide  an  organizational  structure  and  technical  expertise. \nImplementation  must  be  timely,  funds  must  be  disbursed  efficiently  and  properly,  and  all \nparticipating agencies must provide reports. A PMU will be established within NBT. The loan will \nfinance the installation of an accounting and management information system for the PMU and \nother  logistical  support,  including  provision  of  office  equipment,  supplies,  vehicles,  and \noperating costs. \n3.  Costs and Financing \n87.  The total project cost is estimated at $5.31 million equivalent, including physical and \nprice  contingencies,  interest  during  implementation,  taxes  and  duties,  and  expected \ncontributions of NGOs/MFIs and clients. Of the total cost, about $1.82 million or 34% is in \nforeign exchange costs, and $3.49 million equivalent or 66% in local currency costs. Cost \nestimates are in Table 1 and Appendix 6.

It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of SDR 2.934 million ($4 million equivalent) from \nits Special Funds resources to finance 75.3% of total project cost. The loan will have an \namortization period of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge at \nthe rate of 1.0% during the grace period and 1.5 % thereafter.  \n90.  ADB will finance vehicles, equipment, consultants, and overseas and domestic training \nfor NBT; vehicles, equipment and furniture, consultants, and operational costs for the PMU; and \nthe interest charge during implementation ($1.4 million). ADB funds will be channeled through a \ncredit line ($2.6 million), and establish a liquidity guarantee fund (50% of the cost paid by ADB) \nfor MFIs. All loan funds under MSDP\u2019s investment component will be channeled through the EA. \n91.  The Government will fund $390,000 equivalent, 7.3% of total project cost, from budget \nresources and in taxes and duties, and thus finance recurrent costs of NBT supervision of MFIs, \nliquidity guarantee fund (50%), and taxes and duties of $105,922. ", "    19 \n92.  NGOs/MFIs  will  fund  $700,000  equivalent,  13.2%  of  total  project  cost,  to  finance \nvehicles, furniture, and equipment; and capital for MFI startup. MFI clients will fund $220,000 \nequivalent, 4.2% of total project cost, comprising savings deposits for lending, and capital for \nMFIs.  \n93.  The Borrower will be the Republic of Tajikistan, which will bear the foreign exchange \nrisk.  \n4.  Implementation Arrangements \na.  Organization and Management Arrangements \n94.  The project management arrangements comprise the MPSC, PMU, and TWG.  \n95.  The MPSC will comprise representatives of NBT (chair), Office of the President, MOF, \nMOJ,  MSRD,  project  director  (NBT),  NGOs  (two  representatives),  and  other  agencies  as \nrequired. The project manager will act as secretary. ADB and other funding agencies will \nparticipate as observers. The MPSC will (i) provide intergovernmental agency coordination on \nimportant policy, legal, and regulatory issues related to the establishment and operation of \nMFIs; and (ii) facilitate the coordination and cooperation between the Government, NBT, NGOs, \nand funding agencies. The two NGO representatives will be selected by the NGO community. \nThe MPSC will meet quarterly during the first 12 months of the project and semiannually \nthereafter, unless circumstances require more frequent meetings. The establishment of the \nMPSC will be a condition for loan effectiveness.  \n96.  The  executing  agency  will  be  NBT.  It  will  (i)  coordinate  the  project;  (ii)  maintain \nappropriate  accounts,  including  records  on  withdrawal  applications  and  disbursements; \n(iii) ensure that procurement is managed in accordance with ADB guidelines; (v) prepare and \nsubmit  quarterly  progress  and  other  reports  in  formats  and  content  agreed  on  with  ADB; \n(vi) ensure timely submission of audited accounts of the project to ADB; and (vi) serve as the \nfocal  point  for  ADB\u2019s  project  review  and  administration  activities  and  between  ADB  and \nNGOs/MFIs. \n97.  NBT  will  appoint  a  project  director.  This  position  is  a  half-time  unfunded  position, \nnominated by NBT and approved by the MPSC. The project director will be responsible for \ncoordinating project implementation, and will countersign with the project manager withdrawal \napplications and disbursement documents. The project director will be appointed as a condition \nof loan negotiations. \n98.  The PMU will host the project manager, domestic and international consultants, and \nother office support staff (secretary/office administrator, interpreters, and drivers). The PMU will \nserve the needs of other funding agency projects (specifically the World Bank's small and \nmedium-sized enterprise credit line) and provide support to MSDP. The project manager will be \na  full-time  domestic  consultant,  who  will  (i)  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  implementation \nactivities, (ii) supervise consultants, and (iii) be responsible and report to the project director. \nThe  PMU  will  (i)  ensure  that  the  project  is  implemented  in  accordance  with  the  design; \n(ii) ensure effective coordination of all activities and the state and local agencies and NGOs \ninvolved;  (iii)  maintain  accounts,  including  records  on  withdrawal  applications  and \ndisbursements;  (iv)  manage  procurement  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines;  (v)  prepare \nquarterly progress and other reports in formats agreed on with ADB; and (vi) provide support to \nthe MPSC and TWG. The Government and NBT will ensure that adequate office space with ", "20    \nappropriate furniture and access to communication facilities is provided for the project team \nthrough the PMU.  \n99.  TWG which includes the Government, NBT, NGO and MFI will be composed of the \nproject director (chair); legal, regulatory and supervision, and foreign investment staff of NBT; \nMOF, MOJ, and the Office of the President; NGOs/MFIs (two representatives); project manager \n(secretary);  and  consultants  as  required.  For  each  agency  and  department  of  NBT,  one \nrepresentative will be nominated, including an alternate. The NGO and/or MFI representatives \nwill be selected by the NGO and/or MFI community in addition to MPSC representatives. The \nTWG will (i) promote a legal and regulatory environment conducive to the development of MFIs; \n(ii) facilitate cooperation among the Government, NBT, and NGOs in developing MFIs and \nrelated laws and regulations; (iii) address issues concerning the licensing and operations of \nMFIs  and  reach  agreement  on  appropriate  actions;  and  (iv)  submit  assessments  and \nrecommendations on MFI policy, legal, regulatory, and operational issues to the MPSC. The \nTWG will function for the period of the project, meeting at least once a month during the first \nyear  and  as  required  thereafter.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  (i)  the  two  NGO \nrepresentatives in the TWG are selected and appointed by the NGO community, and (ii) NBT \nappoints an alternate staff for each NBT staff in the TWG. The Government will also ensure that \nthe  TWG  is  maintained,  with  composition  and  terms  of  reference  satisfactory  to  ADB, \nthroughout the project implementation period unless otherwise agreed on between the Borrower \nand ADB. \nb.  Relending and On-lending Terms and Conditions \n100.  The Borrower will be the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan. It will bear (i) the full \nforeign exchange risk of the total amount of the loans, and (ii) responsibility to repay the ADB \nloans. ADB will lend SDR2,934,000 of the investment loan component to the Borrower. The \nBorrower through a subsidiary loan agreement acceptable to ADB will relend funds in somoni at \n0% interest rate to NBT. These loan funds will be used by NBT for (i) institutional capacity \nbuilding of NBT, which will be entirely responsible for repayments to the Borrower; and (ii) on-\nlending to  participating commercial banks (PCBs), which will assume the credit risk. NBT will \non-lend the proceeds of the credit line in somoni to PCBs at a rate not less than NBT's \npublished discount or refinancing rate, which will be positive in real terms and acceptable to \nADB. PCBs will further on-lend credit-line proceeds to MFIs and subborrowers at market-based \ninterest rates that take into account PCB\u2019s cost of funds and administrative expenses, adding a \nreasonable risk premium to cover potential losses. PCBs will enter into credit agreements with \nMFIs or subborrowers. MFIs will be PCBs\u2019 subborrowers. MFIs will on-lend to MSEs at market-\nbased interest rates that take into account MFI\u2019s cost of funds and administrative expenses, \nplus a reasonable risk premium to cover potential losses.18 MFIs will bear the credit risk for their \non-lending. Implementation arrangements related to the credit line will be reviewed jointly by the \nGovernment, ADB, PCBs, and MFIs at least once every six months, and the arrangements \nadjusted accordingly. Appendix 7 presents a diagram of the investment loan fund flow.  \n \n101.  Initially, a PCB may borrow up to $500,000 equivalent for one year. If loan repayment is \nsatisfactory, and the PCB continues to meet qualification criteria governing commercial bank \nparticipation in MSDP, the PCB may borrow up to $1 million equivalent for 10 years. PCBs may \nuse funds borrowed from NBT solely for on-lending to MFIs and subborrowers, and PCBs must \ndemonstrate to the satisfaction of NBT and ADB that credit-line proceeds are fully on-lent to \n                                                 \n18\n NGOs lend in somoni with repayments indexed to the dollar, thus transferring the foreign exchange risk to the \nborrower.

If a PCB is found not to have complied with the qualification \ncriteria, the PMU and NBT, with the prior approval of ADB, will determine whether the PCB will \n(i) prepare and implement a plan of action to comply, or (ii) be excluded from the project credit \nline. Any PCB not complying for more than one quarter will be excluded from the project. The \nexcluded PCB will pay back to the project all funds made available through the project. The \nPCB may not accelerate or otherwise require the MFIs to repay the corresponding subloans but \nmust use other sources of funds to repay NBT, so long as the MFIs have complied with the \nrelevant MSDP participation criteria. Appendix 12 presents the PCB participation criteria. NBT, \nthrough the PMU, will monitor PCB financial performance and ongoing compliance with the \nparticipation criteria. \n \n102.  Initially, an MFI may borrow up to $250,000 equivalent for one year. If loan repayment is \nsatisfactory on the initial loan and the MFI continues to meet the eligibility requirements, it may \nborrow up to $500,000 for ten years. MFIs may use funds borrowed from PBCs under the credit \nline solely for on-lending to MSEs or individuals, or for the purchase of fixed assets, with the \nMFI subject to the following borrowing limits: (i) at no time will the MFI's ratio of total loans to \nassets be less than 70%; (ii) at no time will the ratio of the MFI's credit-line borrowings to total \nloans be greater than 50%; (iii) at no time will the ratio of the MFI\u2019s fixed to total assets be \ngreater than 10%. If an MFI is found not to have complied with the eligibility criteria or any of the \nthree borrowing limits, the PCB, in consultation with the PMU and NBT, and with the prior \napproval of ADB, will determine whether the MFI concerned will (i) prepare and implement a \nplan of action to comply, or (ii) be excluded from the project credit line. Any MFI that has not \ncomplied for more than one quarter will be excluded from the project and pay back all funds \nreceived through the project. The PCB must repay the same amount to NBT under the PCB\u2019s \ncorresponding loan within 3 working days. In addition to the PCBs, NBT, through the PMU, will \nmonitor MFI financial performance, and compliance with eligibility criteria.  \n \n103.  PCBs and MFIs will maintain accounting systems and records in accordance with local \naccounting standards acceptable to ADB for financial institutions, and will be subject to review \nby ADB missions. PCB and MFI financial and accounting operations are subject to annual audit \nby external auditors acceptable to ADB.  \n \n104.  As the legal and regulatory enabling environment is being constructed, and while NGOs \nare transformed through this evolving environment, the system of fund disbursement via the \ncredit line will be examined and streamlined. Disbursements of the credit line will begin only \nafter  18\u201324  months,  during  which  time  MSDP  project  staff  and  consultants  will  analyze \ncandidate PCBs, using the participation criteria in Appendix 12. \n \n105.  A key objective of MSDP is to help experienced NGO credit programs become licensed \nMFIs, subject to NBT regulation and supervision. Only after a license has been issued and the \nNGO program legally transformed into an MFI will it be eligible to access the credit line. \n \nc.  Eligibility Criteria for Participating Commercial Banks \n106.  MSDP will qualify commercial banks to access the credit line for on-lending to MFIs. \nMSDP project staff and consultants will determine financial and operating soundness of PCBs, \nas well as judge their capacity to analyze the credit risk of MFIs. To participate in the MSDP \ncredit-line component, a PCB must at least be (i) legally licensed; (ii) in compliance with all NBT \nprudential requirements; (iii) rated satisfactory according to NBT on-site examination reports for \nthe  most  recent  two  calendar  years;  (iv)  profitable  for  the  past  two  calendar  years  as \ndemonstrated by externally audited financial statements prepared in IAS format; (v) properly ", "22    \ncapitalized, with capital relative to risk-weighted assets of not less than 15%; (vi) profitable, as \nmeasured by return on average assets for the past two calendar years of at least 2%; (vii) in full \ncompliance with recommended loan classification and loan provisioning requirements; (viii) able \nto demonstrate capacity to analyze credit risk of MFIs; and (ix) be in compliance with additional \ncriteria as recommended by the PMU, NBT, MPSC, and TWG, and approved by ADB. Should \nthe PCB also meet criteria (iii) and (iv) set out for MFI accreditation in para. 107, the PCB may be \nallowed  to  borrow  funds  for  on-lending  directly  to  MSEs  and  individuals  or  for  fixed-asset \npurchases, subject to (i) approval by NBT and ADB, and (ii) compliance with the three financial \nratio limits defined in para. 108. See Appendix 12 for further discussion of criteria for participation \nin MSDP by commercial banks, including recommended loan classification and provisioning \nrequirements, as well as a complete list of NBT prudential requirements.  \n \nd.  Eligibility Criteria for Microfinance Institutions \n107.  MSDP  will  qualify  MFIs  to  participate  in  the  credit  line.  MSDP  project  staff  and \nconsultants will determine financial and operating soundness, as well as judge the capacity of \nMFIs to manage the credit risk of on-lending to MSEs and individuals. At a minimum, to be \neligible for participation to the project, an MFI must (i) be legally licensed; (ii) comply with all NBT \nprudential requirements for MFIs; (iii) have a ratio of average loan size to GDP per capita of not \nmore than 200%; (iv) have at least 50% women borrowing clients; (v) have achieved operational \nself-sufficiency;  (vi)  have  capital  relative  to  risk-weighted  assets  of  15%;  (vii)  be  fully  in \ncompliance  with  recommended  loan  classification  and  loan  provisioning  requirements;  (vi) \npossess  demonstrable  capacity  to  analyze  and  manage  credit  risk  of  MSEs  and  individual \nborrowers; and (vii) comply with additional criteria recommended by PMU, NBT, MPSC, and \nTWG, and approved by ADB. See Appendix 13 for a discussion of MSDP participation criteria for \nMFIs. Once the MFI has been determined to be eligible, it may approach, or may be approached \nby, a PCB. Before on-lending by a PCB to an MFI, the PCB will analyze the MFI. If the PCB \ndecides to lend to the MFI, the PCB will assume the full credit risk of lending to the MFI. PCBs \nwill enter into credit agreements with MFIs, which will be reviewed in advance by, and be \nacceptable in form and substance to, NBT and ADB. The credit agreement will require the PCB \nto incorporate at a minimum MSDP participation criteria for MFIs. \n \ne.  Implementation Schedule \n108.  The project will be implemented over 4 years from the time the loan agreement becomes \neffective, and the loan will be completely drawn down within 5 years. Project implementation will \ncommence  in  2003.  The  pilot  nature  of  MFI  transformation,  the  continuing  reforms  in  the \nfinancial sector, and the relative inexperience in transforming NGO programs into MFIs require \na flexible approach. However, more flexibility will require the Government and ADB to focus on \nproject monitoring and supervision.  \nf.  Consulting Services \n109.  A total of 86 person-months of consulting services, comprising 14 person-months of \ninternational and 72 person-months of domestic expertise will be recruited under the investment \nloan. Expertise and length of service for domestic consultants include  a project manager (48 \nperson-months), computer systems specialist (8 person-months), training specialist (10 person-\nmonths), and accountant (6 person-months). International consultants will be a microfinance \nsector  specialist/team  leader  (7  person-months),  regulatory  and  supervision  specialist  (5 \nperson-months), and accounting and management information systems specialist (2 person-\nmonths). All consultants will report to the project manager. Terms of reference for consultants ", "    23 \nare in Appendix 8. An international firm of consultants, in association with suitable domestic \nconsultants, will be recruited in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultant\u2019s by \nADB and its Borrowers, and other arrangements acceptable to ADB for selection of domestic \nconsultants, using the quality and cost-based selection method. A full technical proposal will be \nused to select the consulting firm. \n110.  Consulting services  will  primarily  help  the  Government  carry  out  the  policy  agenda \noutlined in the policy matrix (Appendix 4). These resources will be focused on developing a \nfavorable legal and regulatory environment for microfinance, while the attached TA focuses on \ncapacity building within NBT and MFIs. Consulting services will also provide administrative \ncapacity to ensure that the project is managed properly.  \ng.  Procurement \n111.  Procurement  will  include  vehicles;  furniture;  equipment  (computers,  printer, \nphotocopiers); and training.  ADB-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement, with equipment to be procured through international \ncompetitive  bidding  for  contracts exceeding  $500,000  equivalent;  and  through  international \nshopping for contracts from $50,000 to $500,000. For packages below $50,000 equivalent, \ndirect purchase, with prior agreement of ADB, may be used.  \nh.  Disbursement \n112.  The Borrower will establish an imprest account in NBT to facilitate the timely release of \nloan funds and pay for all project expenditures, including credit-line operations. The imprest \naccount  will  be  established  immediately  after  loan  effectiveness.  The  initial  amount  to  be \ndeposited into the imprest account will not exceed $250,000 equivalent. The project director will \noperate the imprest account in accordance with the procedures established by NBT and the \nGovernment.  All  withdrawal  applications  will  be  signed  by  the  project  director  and  project \nmanager. The EA will maintain an accounting system and accounting records in accordance \nwith local accounting standards acceptable to ADB (and subject to regular reviews by ADB \nmissions). ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure (SOE) procedure will be used to reimburse eligible \nexpenditures and to liquidate advances provided to the imprest account. Individual payments \nthat  may  be  reimbursed  or  liquidated  under  the  SOE  procedure  will  not  exceed  $25,000 \nequivalent, and the imprest account and SOE procedure will be established and maintained in \naccordance with the Loan Disbursement HandBook and detailed arrangements between the \nGovernment and ADB. To liquidate and replenish the imprest account, the EA is required to \nsubmit to ADB (i) a list of approved loan applications and their amounts, and (ii) the amount \nreleased to PCBs and/or MFIs. \ni.  Accounts, Audit, and Report \n113.  The Government will cause NBT to maintain separate accounts for the project. The \nGovernment will have  such accounts and related financial statements audited annually by \nauditors acceptable to ADB and in accordance with provisions of the loan agreement and \nGuidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by \nADB. The imprest account and SOE records will also be audited as part of the annual audit. The \nGovernment  will  submit  to  ADB  certified  copies  in  English  of  such  audited  accounts  and \nfinancial statements and the reports of the auditors, within six months after the close of each \nfinancial year. In compliance with the requirement for annual audited financial statements, ", "24    \nproceeds of this loan may be used to finance expenditure for private sector auditors and \ntranslations of auditors\u2019 reports into English. \n114.  NBT  will  submit  consolidated  quarterly  progress  reports  to  ADB,  in  English,  on  all \naspects  of  project  implementation.  The  reports  will  include  details  on  overall  progress  in \nimplementation and problems/issues encountered during the reference period, measures taken \nor proposed to be taken to remedy these problems, and the proposed program of activities \nduring the following quarter. Within three months after the closing date of the loan, NBT will \nprepare and submit to ADB, in a format acceptable to ADB, a project completion report on the \nutilization and impact of the project, performance of the project, economic and social benefits \ngenerated, and impact on the financial sector and rural economy.  \nj.  Project Performance Monitoring System \n115.  This is an ambitious project with broad goals and objectives related to poverty reduction, \ngender,  and  financial  sector  development.  The  project  monitoring  system  will  gather  the \nfollowing types of information: \n(i)  Poverty.  Under  the  attached  TA,  a  social  economist  is  tasked  to  develop \nindicators  for  tracking  the  socioeconomic  status  of  MFI  customers  over  the \nproject life. The TA will develop survey techniques to be applied periodically to \nassess the impact of project activities on poverty. The use of surveys and rapid \nassessment techniques supported through project resources is considered the \nmost efficient approach as it does not impose financial burdens for qualitative \ndata  collection  on  the  financial  institutions  involved  in  the  project.  See \nSupplementary Appendix 3 for details on the supporting TA. Key measures of \nMFI outreach related to average loan size and number of borrowers are also \nconsidered to be poverty related. These data will be captured systematically from \nMFIs. \n(ii)  Gender. The project mandates equal participation by women, first as borrowers, \nand also as participants in project activities, notably training. Data related to \nwomen\u2019s participation in project activities will be closely monitored throughout the \nlife of the project. See Appendix 11 for specific gender targets. \n(iii)  Financial Sector Development. A detailed set of financial indicators has been \ndeveloped for PCBs and MFIs to provide timely information on their financial \nperformance.  \n(a)  MFIs.  In  addition  to  standard  financial  reporting,  these  financial \ninstitutions  will  provide  to  the  project  timely  information  related  to \noutreach,  profitability/self-sustainability,  portfolio  quality,  and  efficiency. \nAppendix  13  provides  a  detailed  list  of  monitoring  indicators  to  be \ngathered from MFIs.  \n(b)  PCBs. Banks will also provide periodic financial information to the project \nrelated  to  their  financial  position.  Should  they  be  engaged  in  direct \nlending to MFIs, PCBs will be subject to MFI reporting requirements and \nprovide  the  same  set  of  project  indicators  related  to  outreach, \nprofitability/self-sufficiency, portfolio quality, and efficiency. Appendix 12 \ndetails the PCB financial indicators that will be monitored by the project.  ", "    25 \n116.  An  integrated  system  of  data  collection  and  analysis  encompassing  all  necessary \ninformation will be designed and implemented to monitor the progress in achieving the project \nobjectives. The project performance monitoring system will provide the Government and ADB \nwith the tools to monitor project inputs, outputs, and objectives as provided in the project \nframework; and to assess the project\u2019s technical, social, and economic effects. NBT will submit \nto ADB a quarterly monitoring report on progress towards achieving the project objectives. \nk.  Project Reviews \n117.  Two loan reviews will be conducted in the first year of implementation. Semiannual \nreviews will continue until annual reviews are considered sufficient for effective administration. A \nmore  comprehensive  review  of  the  project  will  be  carried  out  by  the  Government,  NBT, \nNGOs/MFIs, and ADB after 18 months to assess project performance and the need for changes \nin design and implementation. \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Objectives \n118.  The goal of the TA is to build strong, commercially viable MFIs capable of providing \nfinancial  services  to  MSEs  and  poor  households  while  developing  strong  regulatory  and \nsupervisory  institutions  to  support  MFIs.  The  purpose  is  to  (i)  strengthen  the  supervisory \ncapacity  of  NBT  to  oversee  MFIs,  and  (ii)  develop  the  capacity  of  MFIs  to  operate  as \ncommercially viable financial institutions.  \nB.  Scope \n119.  The TA will (i) formulate MFI financial models that feasibly fit microfinance needs and \nNGO capabilities; (ii) work closely with each MFI and candidate MFI in planning, evaluation of \nactivities, development of new financial products, improvement of  governance and internal \ncontrols, and development of staff benefit packages linked to staff performance; (iii) work closely \nwith the NBT MFI supervision section in refining off-site monitoring and appraisal of MFIs; \n(iv) work with NBT staff in developing efficient and effective procedures for on-site inspections; \n(v) explore possible linkages between commercial banks and MFIs in the joint development of \nproducts, placing of deposits, credit lines, and equity investment; (vi) prepare a baseline survey \nof MFI customers and a system for monitoring benefits received by households during the \nproject; and (vii) obtain market information from households concerning demand for a range of \nfinancial services.  \n120.  Training and study tours abroad will be provided to improve the capacity of NBT and \nsenior MFI staff. Two staff from the NBT MFI supervision section will undergo a three-week \nstudy tour of countries that have been successful in developing a MF sector. Eight managers of \nMFIs  will  be  helped  to  attend  formal  courses  in  MF  covering  (i)  governance  and  internal \ncontrols, (ii) product development and pricing, (iii) asset and liability management, including risk \nmanagement, and (iv) planning and appraisal of programs.  \n121.  NBT will provide office space and facilities for 28 person-months of consulting services \nover three years. International expertise includes an MFI specialist (15 person-months) and a \nsocial economist (4 person-months). A domestic product development specialist (6 person-\nmonths) will also be recruited. Three months of consulting service are unallocated in case of \nunexpected requirements. The terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 8. ", "26    \nC.  Costs and Financing \n122.  Total cost of the TA is estimated at $776,200, including foreign exchange costs of \n$500,430 and local currency costs of $275,770 equivalent. The Government has requested \nADB to provide $640,000 equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $139,570 \nequivalent of the local cost equivalent. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis. The \nGovernment  and  NGOs  will  finance  the  balance  of  $136,200  equivalent,  as  in-kind \ncontributions. Cost estimates are in Appendix 9. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n123.  NBT will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The consultants will be part of the PMU \nwithin NBT. Individual consultants will be recruited by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants by ADB and its Borrowers. All TA consultants will report to the project \nmanager of the PMU. \n \nV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n124.  The adoption of a comprehensive financial systems development approach combined \nwith intensive consultation with government agencies, NBT, NGOs and funding agencies is \naimed at maximizing the benefits and impact and mitigating potentially significant risks.  \n \nA.  Financial Analysis of Microfinance Institutions \n125.  Of current NGO microcredit programs, only a few can be expected to become licensed \nand  regulated  deposit-taking  MFIs  under  MSDP.  To  assess  the  potential  for  successful \ntransformation, a detailed appraisal following the CGAP methodology for the appraisal of MFIs \nwas conducted on ACTED and NABWT. These NGOs were selected as they indicated a strong \ninterest in participating in the appraisal; both have recently divested nonfinancial operations to \nfocus exclusively on microfinance, and are restructuring their management and operations to \nmove to MFI licensing and regulation. NABWT is the largest domestic NGO by number of \nborrowers (5,906) and loan portfolio ($788,381). ACTED, while it has a smaller loan portfolio \n($120,633), is the third-largest NGO by number of clients (5,818). Detailed information on these \nNGOs\u2019 operations is contained in Supplementary Appendix 1.  \n \n126.  NABWT and ACTED have a strong financial base on which to transform themselves into \nlicensed and regulated MFIs. \n \nB.  Benefits \n127.  The benefits derive from the individual policy and investment activities, and will include \nthe following: \n \n(i)  Stable, Transparent Legal Foundation for Microfinance. An improved policy, \nlegal,  and  regulatory  environment  will  create  the  conditions  to  formalize \nunlicensed, unregulated financial activity.  \n \n(ii)  Increased  Financial  Diversity.  An  enabling  environment  and  substantial \ncapacity building may result in the transformation of existing NGO microcredit \nprograms into licensed and regulated MFIs, and the establishment of new MFIs.  ", "    27 \n(iii)  Expansion of Financial Service Delivery. Through the licensing of at least two \ndeposit-taking MFIs, the number of borrowers will increase from 15,000 to 38,000 \nin five years, and the combined loan portfolios to $4 million.  \n \n(iv)  Improved  Access  to  Capital  by  MSEs.  Formalized  microcredit  provided \nthrough viable MFIs will benefit thousands of MSEs that rely mainly on their own \nsavings. With constant access to loans provided by commercially viable MFIs, \nMSEs can expand their businesses, benefiting owners and their families directly \nand the broader economy indirectly through increased economic activity.  \n \n(v)  Safe Haven for Savings. MSEs, the poor, and rural dwellers will benefit directly \nfrom having facilities to safeguard savings. Monetary savings allow for income \nsmoothing and accumulation of funds for investment. \n \nC.  Impact \n128.  The  development  of  a  strong  microfinance  sector  will  help  promote  economic \ndevelopment and reduce poverty. Tajikistan\u2019s weak financial sector is not providing the impetus \nfor broad-based development. MSDP attempts to address this situation by focusing on the \ndevelopment of microfinance services. \n \n1.  Economic Impact \n129.  MSDP will increase the number and diversity of financial institutions operating within the \nformal financial sector, which will not necessarily increase competition initially as MFIs and \nbanks have different market segments and clientele. However, MFIs will require safe banking \ninstitutions for deposits, and MSDP will initiate the development of linkages for deposits and \nloans between MFIs and commercial banks. With increased institutional diversity and linkages \nwith the commercial banking sector, an increased volume of deposits in the financial sector will \nhelp stimulate economic activity, increase domestic investment, deepen the financial sector, and \ncontribute to economic growth. \n \n130.  The  indirect  economic  impact  will  derive  from  the  increased  economic  activity  and \nemployment expected to be generated from the availability and access to more reliable and \nsustainable financial services from a varied range of financial institutions. However, finance \nalone will not necessarily generate these indirect economic impacts as other factors, including \ninvestment  laws  and  regulations,  business  capability,  etc.  will  affect  the  outcome  of \nentrepreneurial undertakings. \n \n2.  Impact on Poverty \n131.  NGOs  provide  limited  financial  services,  consisting  of  small  loans  and  compulsory \nsavings, to their clients. They are generally from the poor and most vulnerable groups. Without \nthe support of MSDP these programs will not be able to develop as sustainable and reliable \nfinancial institutions and, therefore, will be limited in their outreach. Further information on the \nimpact  on  poverty  of  the  policy  loan  and  the  investment  loan  are  in  Appendix  10  and \nSupplementary Appendix 3, respectively. \n \n132.  The  establishment  of  an  enabling  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory  environment  for \nmicrofinance  will  provide  a  more  conducive,  reliable,  and  transparent  framework  for \nmicrofinance.  The  environment  and  framework  will  broaden  the  young  and  undeveloped ", "28    \nfinancial system to provide increased access to all segments of the population, contribute to \nequity, and reduce poverty. The framework will facilitate the establishment of new institutions \nand  further  the  development  of  existing  NGO  programs  into  more  sustainable  financial \ninstitutions.  Overall  access  by  the  poor  to  financial  services  should  increase  significantly. \nHowever, the extent of the increase in outreach will initially depend on funding available to \nexpand activities. \n \n133.  The expansion of reliable and convenient access to financial services will also facilitate \nincreased  enterprise  activities  as  more  people  can  take  advantage  of  existing  and  new \nopportunities. Many households save in nonfinancial forms, and these limit risk diversification \nand the contribution to resource allocation and economic growth. MSDP help mobilize financial \nsavings, which will provide household security, allow self-financing of microenterprises, allow \nthe poor to save for investment, and improve household financial management, smooth income \nflows and consumption patterns, and provide collateral for loans. \n \n134.  The transformation of at least two NGO microcredit programs into formally licensed and \nregulated financial institutions is expected to increase their outreach by about 100%. Based on \nthe client profile, 75% of new clients are expected to be poor. The establishment of reliable and \nsustainable MFIs is aimed not only to enable poor clients to move out of poverty, but equally \nalso to prevent those just above the poverty line from falling into deeper poverty.  \n \n135.  Women account for most clients of NGO programs. Of the clients of four NGO agencies \nmost  likely to  become  MFIs,  over  60%  (30\u201385%)  are  women.  While  some  MFIs  such  as \nNABWT focus on women, others such as AKF do not specifically target them. The overall \nimpact of MSDP on women will depend on the NGOs included in the program and that become \nMFIs. These will ensure that women represent at least 50% of total clients. A gender analysis \nand plan is in Appendix 11. \n \nD.  Risk and Safeguards \n136.  Several risks are associated with MSDP. They are discussed below along with ways of \nmitigating them:  \n \n(i)  Unstable  macroeconomic  environment  that  impacts  negatively  on  the \nsubsectors where MSEs operate. The Government's continued commitment to \nreform  has  been  demonstrated  in  the  PRGF  signed  with  IMF.  Continued \nengagement with IMF and World Bank, and improving economic management \nare the key mitigating factors counterbalancing this risk. \n \n(ii)  Ineffective implementation of the draft microfinance law and regulations. \nConsulting  services  under  the  investment  loan  will  provide  expertise  and \nresources  to  NBT  to  implement  the  law  prudently,  and  create  an  effective \nregulatory and supervisory regime. USAID and IFC are also committed to seeing \nthe law implemented.  \n \n(iii)  Delays or difficulties in harmonizing related laws and the Tax Code as they \nrelate to MFIs. Consulting resources of MSDP, and of USAID and IFC, which \nhave signaled their commitment to harmonizing the draft law with existing laws \nand the Tax Code, will substantially mitigate this risk. ", "    29 \n(iv)  Delays or problems in transforming and/or establishing MFIs. The MPSC \nand TWG will continuously identify contentious issues and hold consultations on \nthem, thereby mitigating this risk. Substantial ADB TA for MFI transformation, \nplus USAID and IFC support to transform individual NGO programs, will further \nreduce this risk.  \n \n(v)  Operational and financial risks of PCBs. PCB operational and financial risk will \nbe mitigated by strict criteria and performance monitoring developed under the \nproject, supported by consulting services.  \n \n(vi)  Operational and financial risks of MFIs. The attached TA will mitigate these \nthrough training and institutional capacity building. Operational risk can be further \nmitigated  by  MFI  borrowing  on  the  credit  line  to  finance  the  purchase  of \nappropriate information technology systems to improve accounting and financial \nreporting. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n137.  In addition to the standard assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents, \nthe Government has given the following assurances: \n(i)  The Government will ensure that the policies adopted and actions taken as \ndescribed in the development policy letter continue in effect during and after \nMSDP. \n(ii)  Within  12  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  NBT  will  hire  at  least  two  qualified \nprofessional staff to supervise MFIs. \n(iii)  The  MPSC  will  be  maintained,  with  composition  and  terms  of  reference \nsatisfactory to ADB, throughout implementation. \n(iv)  The MPSC will meet quarterly during the first 12 months of the project and \nsemiannually thereafter, unless circumstances require more frequent meetings. \n(v)  The  TWG  will  be  maintained,  with  composition  and  terms  of  reference \nsatisfactory to ADB, throughout project implementation unless all parties agree to \ndissolve it earlier. \n(vi)  NBT will provide the PMU with adequate office space and support services in a \nform satisfactory to ADB throughout the project.  \n(vii)  The Government will ensure that the criteria developed to select NGO programs, \nPCBs, and MFIs as agreed on among the Government, ADB, PCBs, NGOs, and \nMFIs are strictly adhered to and applied objectively to ensure equal opportunity \nto participate in the project. \n(viii)  The  Government  will  ensure  reasonable  and  consistent  application  of  laws, \nregulations, and procedures for all MFIs. ", "30    \n(ix)  The Government will provide the required counterpart funds in a timely manner \nfrom budget resources during the project.  \n(x)  For external training conducted under the investment component, institutions will \nbe selected and engaged in accordance with procedures acceptable to ADB, \ntaking into account considerations of economy and efficiency. \nB.

The Microfinance Systems Development Program (MSDP) has been prepared based \nlargely on Asian Development Bank (ADB) staff and staff consultant resources. However, a \nsmall-scale technical assistance (SSTA) project1 also provided legal assistance to the National \nBank of Tajikistan (NBT) and initiated technical support for nongovernment organization (NGO) \nmicrocredit programs. A second input of legal assistance by the same consultant was funded by \nthe Open Society Institute (OSI) of the Soros Foundation during the Appraisal Mission. \n \n2.  A  key  change  in  the  nature  of  the  loan  occurred  following  the  Consultative  Group \nMeeting in May 2001. The original technical assistance (TA) loan was converted into a sector \ndevelopment loan. The key processing steps were the following: \n \n(i)  Reconnaissance Mission for a TA loan, 5\u201314 April 2000; \n(ii)  TA Loan Fact-Finding Mission, 5\u201324 August 2000; \n(iii)  TA Processing Mission, 28 February\u201314 March 2001; \n(iv)  A mission seeking government agreement to change the TA loan to a sector \ndevelopment program loan, 20\u201326 June 2001; \n(v)  Loan Fact-Finding Mission, 3\u201315 February 2002;  \n(vi)  Appraisal Mission, 29 April\u201317 May 2002; \n(vii)  Special Mission, 23\u201325 October 2002. \n(viii)  Postappraisal Mission, 1\u201308 February 2003. \n \n3.  A key aspect of processing has been the consultative process initiated by ADB. An initial \nworkshop for NBT and NGOs was convened during the August 2000 Mission. This workshop (i) \nhighlighted to the Government the significant role of NGOs in microfinance, (ii) identified the \nissues and constraints affecting the operations of NGO programs, and (iii) culminated in the \nformation of a government-NGO working group chaired by NBT. The working group has met on \nseveral occasions, usually during ADB missions and with SSTA consultants. \n \n4.  During the Appraisal Mission, NBT chaired a two-day conference on the policy, legal, \nand  regulatory  environment  for  microfinance  for  over  50  representatives  from  NGOs, \nGovernment, NBT, and external funding agencies. ADB and OSI jointly funded the conference. \n \n5.  Aid coordination and cooperation have also been important elements in loan processing. \nThe increasing interest in the development of microfinance culminated in an inaugural donor \nmeeting on microfinance on 7 February 2002, in Dushanbe, organized by the Consultative \nGroup to Assist the Poorest with funding by United States Agency for International Development \n(USAID). The meeting agreed that ADB would lead in developing the legal and regulatory \nframework and also chair the second donor meeting. The second meeting was held during the \nconference on policy, legal, and regulatory reforms for microfinance. An e-mail network has \nbeen established among donors and NGOs. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOUs) from \nthe loan fact-finding and appraisal missions were distributed to all participating donors and \nNGOs. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2000.

The \nmacroeconomic situation has seen steady improvement, with GDP growing at an average annual \nrate of 7% since 1997. The growth, however, is not broad based and reflects favorable international \nmarket conditions for cotton and aluminum, which may prove temporary. Inflation has moderated \nsince 1997 as well. Overall, we expect GDP to grow by 6% per year through 2005, with inflation \nbeing held to a maximum of 5% per year over the same period.   \n \nPoverty reduction is a major objective of our development program. In June 2002 the Parliament \napproved a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, in which the Government estimates that 60% of the \npopulation live is living in poverty. Some poverty studies show a rate closer to 80%. In rural areas \nwhere more than 75% of the people live, there is a much greater degree of extreme poverty, 23% \ncompared to 19% in urban areas. The Government of Tajikistan and the International Monetary \nFund started implementation of the new three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility Program \n(PRGF). The Program represents a great step forward for Tajikistan, and provides substantial \nresources with which to take on the task of poverty reduction.  \n \nThe principal objective of our Poverty Reduction Strategy is to achieve a fair distribution of the \nbenefits of growth and ensure a rise in living standards of the poorest groups of the population. With \nthis objective in mind, the Government aims to encourage the development of an effective financial \nsector capable of mobilizing savings and providing financial intermediation with particular attention to \nthe needs of micro, small and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs), dekhkan farms and farmers, and \npeople living in rural areas.   \n \nThere  has  been  achieved  significant  progress  with  support  of  IFOs  and  donors  in  expanding \nmicrocredit activities targeting MSEs and poorer rural households through programs organized and \nmanaged by non-governmental organizations in Tajikistan. Some of the best programs demonstrate \nmeasurable success, in terms of numbers of clients served, repayment rates (greater than 95%), \nand an ability to recover the cost of program administration through interest and fee charges. These \nsuccesses  create  the  hope  that  by  applying  international  best  practices  in  microfinance,  well \ndesigned  programs  in  Tajikistan  can  grow  to  achieve  significant  outreach  and  financial  self-\nsustainability.   \n \nIn order to meet the overall goals and specific objectives included in the National Poverty Reduction \nStrategy, and in consideration the positive developments within the small but growing microfinance ", " 40 Appendix 3 \nsector, the Government has adopted a Microfinance Sector Development Policy (MF Policy). The \ngoal of the MF Policy is to create a strong financial market capable of providing essential financial \nservices  to  MSEs,  rural  households,  and  the  poor.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  in \ncooperation  with  the  Government  has  created  a  Microfinance  Systems  Development  Program \n(MSDP) that is fully supportive of the Government's MF Policy.   \n \nMSDP will help the Government to deepen the financial sector by increasing the outreach and \nsustainability of market-oriented microfinance services to the poor. This will be achieved through: (i) \nthe development of a conducive policy, regulatory, and institutional environment for microfinance; \nand  (ii)  the  development  of  viable  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs)  to  reach  the  poor.  The \nGovernment considers this ADB program to be a critically important element of the poverty reduction \nstrategy and a vital initiative to deepen financial markets in Tajikistan, providing access to needed \nfinancial services to the poor. \n \nThe Government, through the MF Policy, recognizes the leading role that domestic and international \nNGOs are playing in developing the microfinance sector. The Government has also recognized the \nurgent need for an enabling policy, legal and regulatory framework, to allow these organizations to \nexpand their activities and transform themselves into safe and sound financial institutions. The MF \nPolicy establishes consultative and advisory bodies to ensure full stakeholder participation in the \ncreation of the enabling environment. While process is important, the main emphasis of the MF \nPolicy is to promote the sustainable provision of microfinance services through licensed, and where \nappropriate, regulated microfinancial institutions (MFIs).   \n \nAs part of the Government's program to promote microfinance, a Law on Microfinance Institutions is \nin its final stage of stakeholder review and consultation.  This law will create the proper legal \nfoundation for the licensing of programs now engaged in microfinance, mainly in the provision of \nmicro credit, in Tajikistan. The drafting and enactment of the law represents an important step in the \ndevelopment  of  the  microfinance  sector.  The  Government  and  ADB  are  dedicated  to  further \ndeveloping the enabling environment for microfinance by harmonizing the Law on Microfinance with \nother laws (supported by follow-on efforts from ADB and other donors), and creating appropriate \nregulations and a supervisory regime to make the new Law on Microfinance Institutions effective.   \n \nMr. President, both the Government of Tajikistan and ADB share a common objective of reducing \npoverty. The Government is certain that the measures to be adopted under MSDP will significantly \nstrengthen the outreach, viability, and sustainability of the microfinance sector, and support the goals \nand objectives of the Government's MF Policy and its National Poverty Reduction Strategy. We and \nparticularly rural dwellers and poor households that are now, or who will be, clients of MFIs expect \nthat the microenterprises, will make contribution to economic growth and to improve their standard of \nliving.   \n \nI  wish  to  convey  my  sincere  appreciation  for  the  support  ADB  has  provided  to  facilitate  the \ndevelopment of microfinance in Tajikistan and look forward to the successful implementation of \nMSDP, from which the people of Tajikistan will benefit substantially. The Government pledges to \ncoordinate all MSDP activities with utmost care in order to ensure the optimal use of the resources \nprovided through MSDP. \n \n \n  Respectfully yours, \n \nAkil Akilov /signed/ \n \n ", "    Appendix 4  41\nPOLICY MATRIX \n \nMeasures  Monitoring  Responsible \nObjective  Time Frame \nto be Taken  Mechanism  Agencies \nA.

Gender Status. Women in Tajikistan have suffered from the combined adverse impact \nof the country\u2019s transition to a market economy and the 5\u2013year civil conflict, which ensued \nimmediately  after  independence.  Decreased  economic  activity,  death  of  men,  or  their  out \nmigration  of  men  to  seek  jobs  outside  the  country  intensified  women\u2019s  workload  and \nparticipation in the informal sector and low-paying formal labor market. Women\u2019s limited access \nto productive and remunerative resources has constrained women\u2019s economic opportunities and \nhas confined rural women, especially, to coping strategies for survival. The collapse of social \nsafety nets and social protection measures increased women\u2019s household responsibilities and \nreduced their representation at the community and national levels. With the decrease in public \nsocial expenditures, gender disparities became more pronounced. Net enrolment ratio of girls to \nboys declined dramatically especially in the 7\u201318-year age bracket. Deteriorating health status \namong women and children worsened with the decline in health care services and reduction of \nmunicipal infrastructure, particularly potable drinking water.  \n \n2.  The resumption of peace and the positive economic growth in recent years have yet to \nmake a significant dent in material poverty and its multifaceted dimensions as well as on gender \ndisparities. Disturbing trends that need to be addressed are the (i) sharp decline in labor force \nparticipation, especially among women; (ii) increasing out migration, particularly among young \nrural males, putting additional workload on women-headed households; and (iii) limited access \nto social services for women and children. Rural and poor women are the most disadvantaged \nas they must try to make both ends meet through intensive cultivation of small household plots \nwhile rearing their children and caring for the elderly.  \n \n3.  Gender and Microfinance. The introduction of microfinance services by NGOs in major \npoverty-stricken and previously conflict-ridden regions during the second half of the 1990s was \ntimely as it provided a lifeline support, especially to rural women. Access to microfinance \nservices  gave  women  capital  and  became  for  most  the  foundation  to  build  sustainable \nlivelihoods. By 2001 about 17 NGOs had provided microfinance to around 44,000 borrowers, \nabout 60% of whom are women. Most women beneficiaries have accessed small-scale credit \nlines  to  engage  largely  in  trading  and  service-based  activities.  Some  recent  surveys  of \ninternational NGOs have shown that incomes derived from this informal source have improved \nbeneficiaries\u2019 revenue stream by 20\u201360%, and many female-headed and poor households have \nbeen able to solve their food insecurity. Women also benefited from the training as it honed their \nbusiness  and  management  skills  and  improved  their  awareness  of  their  human  rights.  As \nimmediate income needs are met, women beneficiaries engage in community development \nactivities, participate in local governance, and policy dialogues, and network with other women \ngroups.  \n \n4.  Gender Issues. Partnerships and networking between NGOs and Government have \nlikewise improved the environment for women\u2019s economic empowerment. The basic framework \nfor mainstreaming the gender agenda into the national political arena is laid out in the National \nPlan of Action for Women\u2019s Advancement and the National Program for Equal Opportunities \nbetween Women and Men. However, more policy, regulatory, and supervisory reforms are \nrequired to expand the outreach of microfinance services. To date, only about 8% of the total \npopulation has access to microfinance services. While women clients outnumber men, demand \nfor microfinance services remains large and unmet. For instance, microfinance institution (MFI) \ndeposit schemes are prohibited legally, not only inhibiting MFIs\u2019 capacity to mobilize domestic \nresources but also harming women in general as they save more than men. Women also \nparticipate mainly in group lending schemes rather than higher-end capital activities, partly ", "62   Appendix 11 \nbecause of cultural and social barriers and partly due to legal impediments that delimit equal \naccess  to  ownership  of  productive  assets.  The  human  capital  of  women  will  need  to  be \nupgraded to enable them to access capital and engage in more risky but more profitable \nbusiness  ventures.  Last,  institutional  capacity  building  is  needed  to  ensure  sustainable \nmicrofinance services and to mainstream the gender agenda.  \n \n5.  Gender Strategy and Plan. The objectives of the gender strategy are to (i) ensure \nbroader  participation  of  women  in  microfinance;  (ii)  facilitate  the  formulation  of  a  policy, \nregulatory, and supervisory framework conducive to microfinance development, which will, in \nturn,  mainstream  the  gender  agenda  of  furthering  women\u2019s  economic  and  political \nempowerment; and (iii) lay the foundation for sustainable gender-based NGOs that provide \nmicrofinance services.  \n \n6.  Gender Targets. Activities to be carried out under Microfinance Systems Development \nProgram (MSDP) will consider gender equity. MSDP will mandate the minimum participation of \nwomen in two areas: (i) for all training and other capacity-building exercises, no less than 50% \nof the participants will be women; and (ii) NGOs selected to become MFIs and that wish to avail \nthemselves of the credit line must have at least 50% women microcredit clients.  \n \nComponents and Targets for Gender Strategy \n \n Component   Activity   Approach and Target \nPolicy, legal, regulatory,  -   Government policy and  -   The project will ensure that \nand institutional actions  strategy for  the reforms will not negatively \nto develop MFIs  development of MFIs  impact on the gender agenda \n-   Legislative actions for  of furthering women\u2019s \nMFI classification, tax  economic, social, and political \ncode amendments,  empowerment.  \namendments of laws  -   Target: Policy, legislative, and \ncovering financial  regulatory reforms affecting \ninstitutions, etc.  MFIs \n-   Regulation and \nsupervision \nCapacity building for  -  Training and other in-  -  MSDP capacity-building \n-  National Bank of  house capacity-building  activities will address the \nTajikistan in legal,  activities  essential gender issues \nregulatory, and  related to promoting \nsupervisory  microfinance services and \nrequirements for MFIs;  ensuring the development \nand   and maintenance of a \n-  NGOs becoming  database on gender, income \nformally licensed and  poverty, and microfinance.  \nregulated MFIs  -   Gender target: Project training \nactivities will have no less \nthan 50% women participants.", "  Appendix 11  63 \nPilot-testing of the  - Criteria for MFI selection  -   Women should make up at \ntransformation of  - Identification of MFIs  least 50% of MFIs\u2019 clients.  \nselected NGO  - Operation of MFIs  -   The project will ensure that \nmicrofinance programs  mid- and post-assessment of \ninto formally licensed  gender will be undertaken. \nand regulated MFIs  -   Gender target: MFIs selected \nfor participation in the project \nwill have no less than 50% \nwomen clients. \n ", "64   Appendix 12 \nPROPOSED ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR PARTICIPATING COMMERCIAL BANKS \n \n1.  The project credit line will be available for Microfinance Systems Development Program \n(MSDP) participating commercial banks (PCBs), which will be selected based on the eligibility \ncriteria outlined below, and subject to the approval of the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) and \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). Eligibility will mean that the PCB qualifies to on-lend funds to \nmicrofinance institutions (MFIs). In some special cases, PCBs may be allowed to access ADB \ncredit-line funds for direct on-lending to micro- and small enterprises (MSEs).  \n \nA.  Criteria for Initial Participation \n \n2.  The PCBs will be thoroughly examined to ensure that they comply with the following \neligibility criteria at initial assessment:  \n \n(i)  be legally licensed; \n(ii)  comply with all NBT prudential requirements (see attached list) on the basis of \nperformance without waiver or forbearance by NBT; \n(iii)  have a \"satisfactory\" on-site examination report issued by NBT within the past \nyear; \n(iv)  be profitable for the past 2 calendar years as demonstrated by externally audited \nfinancial statements prepared in international accounting standards (IAS) format; \n(v)  have a return on average assets for past two calendar years of at least 2%; \n(vi)  have capital relative to risk weighted assets of 15%. \n(vii)  demonstrate capacity to analyze credit risk of MFIs; and  \n(viii)  comply with additional criteria as recommended by the project management unit \n(PMU), National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT), microfinance policy steering committee \n(MPSC), technical working group (TWG) and approved by ADB. For new banks, \nNBT and ADB may exercise discretion in the application of criteria (iii), (iv), and \n(v), but will require detailed pro forma financial statements.  \n \nB.  Ongoing Eligibility Criteria for Participating Commercial Banks \n \n3.  Throughout the project period, the PMU at NBT, along with ADB, will monitor PCBs\u2019 \ncompliance with eligibility criteria. PCBs will make quarterly and annual financial statements \navailable to the PMU and ADB so that ongoing eligibility can be verified throughout the project \nperiod. Annual financial statements will be reviewed by an external auditor, who will offer an \nopinion on the accuracy of the accounting and financial presentation. Annual audited financial \nstatements will be submitted to the PMU and ADB within 180 days from the end of the financial \nyear.  \n \n4.   If a PCB is found not to be in compliance with the initial and ongoing participation \ncriteria, the PMU and NBT, with prior approval of ADB, will determine whether the PCB will (i) \nprepare and implement a plan of action with the objective of reaching compliance, or (ii) will be \nexcluded from the project credit line. Any PCB that is not in compliance for more than one \nquarter will be automatically excluded from the project. If a PCB is excluded from the project, it \nwill pay back to the project all funds received. \n ", "    Appendix 12  65\nC.  Participating Commercial Bank Qualification as MFI \n \n5.  Existing or new commercial banks may wish to provide financial services to clients \ncomposed mainly of MSEs and poor households. MSDP will allow PCBs qualified to access \ncredit-line funds to on-lend directly to MSEs, individuals, and groups, so long as the PCB can \ndemonstrate to the PMU, NBT, and ADB that its (i) ratio of average loan size to GDP per capita \nis not more than 200%; and (ii) at least 50% of its borrowing clients are women. In addition, \nPCBs wishing to retail funds directly to MSEs and individuals are subject to the additional \nborrowing limits defined by three financial ratios to which participating MFIs are also subjected: \n \n(i)   total loans of the PCB as a percentage of total assets must be at least 70% (a \nnew  PCB  must  show,  through  its  pro  forma  financial  statements,  that  this \npercentage will be achieved within one year, and then demonstrate compliance \nwithin one year);  \n(ii)   total borrowings of a PCB under the credit line to total loans must be less than \n50%; and  \n(iii)   fixed assets may not be greater than 10% of total assets of the PCB.  \n \nD.  Recommended Level of General Provisions for Loan Losses \n \n6.  PCBs will follow a rule-based system for loan classification and provisioning as outlined \nby NBT (see \"Other Requirements\" in the attached schedule of NBT prudential regulations for \ncommercial banks). In addition to the requirements for specific provisions, PCBs will mandate a \nminimum of 1% general provision for loan losses: that is, at least 1% of the initial principal \namount of every loan made by a PCB will be charged as an expense to create a general loan \nloss reserve.  \n \n7.  A PCB must prepare and provide a copy of its loan ageing schedule\u2014showing the \namount of loans by loan classification (i.e., \"special mention,\" \"substandard,\" \"doubtful,\" and \n\"loss,\") and the amount of provisions set aside by loan classification\u2014to the PMU and ADB \nevery quarter at least, with the annual ageing schedule subject to external audit. \n \nE.

The project credit line will be made available to microfinance institutions (MFIs) through \nparticipating commercial banks (PCBs), with which MFIs will enter into credit agreements. MFIs \nwill  be  qualified  to  participate  in  the  credit-line  component  of  the  Microfinance  Systems \nDevelopment Program (MSDP) based on their meeting the initial participation criteria outlined \nbelow,  and  subject  to  the  approval  of  the  National  Bank  of  Tajikistan  (NBT)  and  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). The amount that an MFI can borrow will be limited by financial ratio \ntests, which will be measured and monitored on an ongoing basis. Continuing participation in \nthe project will depend on meeting certain performance benchmarks. Finally, MFIs will be \nrequired to report specific performance indicators related to their outreach and sustainability. \nThe measures and indicators listed here represent the minimum requirements for initial and \nongoing MFI participation in MSDP, and the minimum set of performance indicators to be \napplied to MFIs.  \n \nA.  Criteria for Initial Participation \n \n2.  MFIs will be thoroughly examined to ensure that they comply with the participation \ncriteria at the time of assessment of initial eligibility. The following is a minimum list of eligibility \ncriteria for MFI participation in MSDP:  \n \n(i)  be legally licensed;  \n(ii)  comply with all NBT prudential requirements for MFIs;  \n(iii)  have a ratio of average loan size to gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of \nnot more than 200 % \n(iv)  have at least 50% women borrowing clients;  \n(v)  have achieved operational self-sufficiency (OSS) (as measured by a positive \nOSS ratio, further defined in section C); \n(vi)  have capital relative to risk-weighted assets of 15%;  \n(vii)  demonstrate capacity to analyze and manage credit risk of micro- and small \nenterprises and individual borrowers; and  \n(viii)  comply with additional criteria recommended by the project management unit \n(PMU), National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT), microfinance policy steering committee \n(MPSC), technical working group (TWG), and approved by ADB.  \n \nB.  Ongoing Participation Criteria  \n \n  1. Borrowing Limits \n \n3.  MFIs must be prevented from depending excessively on the credit line for funding, \nbuilding up excessive amounts of liquidity, and overinvesting in non-earning assets. Financial \nratios will serve to limit the amount that an MFI may borrow. Notwithstanding other financial ratio \ntests to be applied by NBT, to be qualified to participate in the credit line component of MSDP, \nan MFI may at no time have the following: \n \n(i)  total loans less than 70% of total assets;  \n(ii)  borrowings under the credit line greater than 50% of total loans; and \n(iii)  fixed assets greater than 10%of total assets.  \n \n ", "68   Appendix 13 \n2. Periodic Reporting, Compliance, and Noncompliance \n \n4.  Throughout the project period, participating MFIs will provide to PCBs, as well as to the \nproject management unit (PMU) and ADB, reports demonstrating the continuing compliance of \nthe  MFI  with  the  initial  participation  criteria  and  the  three  financial  ratios  that  define  the \nborrowing limits. Compliance reports will be prepared quarterly and be made available to the \nPCBs, PMU, and ADB within 30 days of the end of each quarter. Annual audited financial \nstatements will be submitted to the PCBs, PMU, and ADB within 180 days of the end of the \nfinancial year, and this audited financial report will include an audited compliance report.  \n \n5.   If an MFI is found not to be in compliance with the initial and ongoing participation \ncriteria, the PCB, in consultation with the PMU and NBT, and with the prior approval of ADB, will \ndetermine whether the MFI concerned will (i) prepare and implement a plan of action with the \nobjective of reaching compliance, or (ii) be excluded from the project credit line. Any MFI that is \nnot in compliance for more than one quarter will be automatically excluded from the project. If \nan MFI is excluded from the Project, it will pay back to the PCB all Project funds made available \nthrough the Project. The PCB, in turn, must repay the funds received from the excluded MFI to \nNBT within 3 working days. \n \nC.   Performance Monitoring Indicators \n \n6.  The  performance  of  MFIs  will  be  measured  using  four  categories  of  performance-\nmonitoring  indicators:  outreach,  profitability  and/or  self-sustainability,  portfolio  quality,  and \nefficiency. During implementation, MSDP will prepare a program of indicators for the individual \nMFI. PCBs, in consultation with the PMU and ADB, may use these indicators, particularly the \nfinancial indicators, to develop covenants for inclusion in credit agreements with MFIs. The \nfinancial performance indicators also provide the basis for a rating system for MFIs that could \ninform or condition pricing, i.e., actual performance that surpasses pro forma performance \nindicators could result in a reduction in the pricing of future loans. The program of indicators to \nbe developed for each MFI will include the following: \n \n1.  Outreach Indicators \n \n7.  Outreach of MFIs has two main dimensions: breadth (number of clients) and depth \n(degree  of poverty  of  clients).  The  following indicators  will  be  used  to  evaluate  the  MFIs\u2019 \nperformance in achieving outreach: \n \n(i)  number of active borrowers, measured at the end of each month, quarter, and \nyear;  \n(ii)  number of borrowers served during specific periods: month, quarter, year; \n(iii)  number of loans disbursed during specific periods: month, quarter, year; \n(iv)  percentage of female active borrowers at the end of each month, quarter, year; \n(v)  number of voluntary depositors at the end of each month, quarter, year; \n(vi)  percentage of female voluntary depositors at the end of each month, quarter, \nyear; \n(vii)  total amount of voluntary deposits outstanding at the end each month, quarter, \nyear; and \n(viii)  ratio of the average loan balance to gross national product (GNP) per capita, \nmeasured quarterly, based upon most recent GNP per capita figure published by \nthe International Monetary Fund (IMF).  \n ", "    Appendix 13  69\n8.  Active borrowers include all individuals who have an outstanding loan balance with the \nMFI. This number should be based on the individual borrowers rather than the number of \ngroups. \n \n2.  Profitability/Self-Sustainability \n \n9.  In the case of commercial banks, profitability is measured generally in terms of return on \nequity and return on assets, and these measures are relevant for MFIs as well. MFIs, which are \noften recipients of noncommercial support and/or funding, also need to consider operational \nself-sufficiency and financial self-sufficiency indicators that show the capacity of an MFIs to \ncontinue functioning once support comes to an end. The following indicators will be applied to \nparticipating MFIs to measure profitability and self-sustainability: \n \n(i)  Adjusted return on equity. Net operating income less taxes/adjusted average \nequity. Measures the MFI's ability to generate profits that provide a reasonable \nreturn to investors. \n(ii)  Adjusted return on assets. Net operating income less taxes/adjusted average \ntotal assets. Measures the MFI's ability to generate revenue from investments, \nand convert revenue into profit.  \n(iii)  OSS  ratio.  Operating  revenue/(operating  expense  +  unadjusted  financing \nexpense + loan loss provision expense). Measures the MFI's ability to cover all of \nits actual expenses from its revenue stream. \n(iv)  Adjusted financial self-sufficiency ratio. Adjusted operating revenue/adjusted \n(operating expense + financial expense + loan loss provision expense - net \nextraordinary  income).  Measures  the  MFI's  ability  to  cover  its  total  costs, \nincluding actual costs and imputed costs, of which imputed costs are added to \nsimulate full commercial operating conditions. \n \n10.  Adjustments essentially represent imputed costs that MFIs often do not incur directly due \nto financial support from funding agencies or other agencies. Inflation must also be considered. \nThe value, in real terms, of an MFI's capital must also be maintained. Only after imputing costs \nrelated to inflation and neutralizing the benefits of operational or financial subsidies is it possible \nto determine whether an MFI is commercially viable or approaching commercial viability. After \nadding imputed costs (or subtracting imputed benefits), adjustments to income statement and \nbalance  sheet  figures  must  be  made.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  MFI \nperformance against these profitability and self-sustainability indicators, and will calculate and \nadjust the income statement and balance sheet data according to criteria provided to the PMU \nby the project.  \n \n  3.   Portfolio Quality \n \n11.  The MFI's performance at loan collection must be monitored. Loan classification and \nloan loss provisioning are as important to an MFI as to a commercial bank. NBT regulations \ndeveloped for MFIs are assumed to incorporate similar loan classification and provisioning \nrequirements  as  those  applied  to  commercial  banks.  New  MFIs  should  be  provided  with \nadditional indicators of portfolio quality to help develop a strong credit culture. The following \nindicators will be applied by the PCBs and PMU to monitor MFI portfolio quality:  \n \n(i)  Portfolio at risk (PAR) ratio. PAR (over 30 days)/gross loan portfolio.This is a \nvery conservative indicator of portfolio quality, and measures the financial impact ", "70   Appendix 13 \non the portfolio in case all past due loans go unpaid. PAR is the outstanding \nprincipal amount of all loans that have one or more installments of principal past \ndue  by  a  certain  number  of  days.  PAR  includes  the  entire  unpaid  principal \nbalance (in past due and future installments) but not accrued interest. PAR does \nnot include loans that have been restructured or rescheduled. Under MSDP, ADB \nrecommends MFIs use 30 days as the cut-off for past dues.  \n \n(ii)  Current  due  collection  ratio.  Amount  collected  of  current  loans  due/total \namount of current loan due. This measures the MFI's ability to collect loans in the \nnormal  course  of  business,  that  is,  when  they  come  due,  and  indicates  the \nefficiency of the MFI's ordinary collection activities.  \n \n(iii)  Past due collection ratio. Amount collected of past dues/total amount of past \ndues. This measures the MFI's ability to collect late loans, and indicates the \nefficiency of the MFI in managing extraordinary recovery activities. \n \n  4.  Efficiency \n \n12.  MFIs must  achieve sizeable outreach, which is in many ways a proxy  measure of \npoverty impact. MFIs must also be profitable to attract more investors and capital. Managing \ncredit  risk  properly  is  also  important,  because  loan  losses  can  quickly  erode  capital  and \nundermine financial strength. From the point of view of the customer, the MFI must operate \nefficiently, that is, manage its cost structure to provide services as cost-effectively as possible. \nCost-effectiveness means that the MFI can offer credit products at a lower interest rate, or pay a \nhigher rate of interest on deposits. MSDP will monitor the efficiency of participating MFIs by \nsubjecting MFIs to the following efficiency indicators:  \n \n(i)  Efficiency  ratio. Adjusted operating expense/adjusted (net interest margin \u2013 \nprovisions for loan losses + other recurring income). Adjusted operating expense \nis the numerator. This indicator is a standard banking indicator of efficiency as it \nshows how many units of net revenue are generated for each unit of expenditure; \nit is, in effect, an input-output ratio.  \n \n(ii)  Cost  per  borrower.  Adjusted  operating  expense/average  number  of  active \nborrowers. This is an appropriate indicator for MFIs reaching low-end clients \nbecause it neutralizes the effect of loan sizes. \n \n(iii)  Assets per employee. Operating expense/number of employees. Measures the \nproductivity of the MFI's employees.  \n \n(iv)  Loans per credit officer. Total active loans/number of credit officers. Measures \nthe productivity of the credit department's operations, key to an MFI's profitability.  \n "], "metadata": {"Creator": "R106-03 - Microsoft Word", "CreationDate": "D:20030603152657Z", "Title": "R106-03", "Author": "rsa", "Producer": "Acrobat PDFWriter 5.0 for Windows NT", "ModDate": "D:20030703134449+08'00'"}}
