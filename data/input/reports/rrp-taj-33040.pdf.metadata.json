Thematic: Gender \n \nClassified as category C \n \n \nTajikistan  has  recently  made  great  progress  in  moving  toward  a \nmarket-based  economy. \nthe  past  3  years,  economic \ndevelopment  and  transition  have  accelerated,  yet  the  poverty \nincidence remains high. Recent surveys estimated that in 2002 as \nmuch as 80% of the population is poor.  \n \nThe commercial banking sector, in an early stage of development, \ncannot  meet  the  needs  of  micro-  and  small  enterprises  (MSEs) \nand  poor  households.  Rural  areas  remain  largely  unserved  by \nbanks. In contrast, Tajikistan has seen the emergence of a highly \nactive and potentially effective microfinance sector. By the end of \n2002, around 17 NGOs were carrying out lending activities, which \nare  generally  funded  through  international  grant  assistance.  The \nloans target rural microenterprises and women, and the poor. \n \nto  be \nThe  policy, \ndeveloped  so  that  NGO  programs  and  new  MFIs  can  operate \nlegally and under an effective regime of supervision that supports \nprudent  financial  intermediation,  including  deposit  mobilization. \nNGO microcredit programs do not have the capacity to serve the \nmicrofinance market. However, they have developed a substantial \nlevel of trust with their clients, registered a high percentage of loan \nrepayment,  and  are  developing  approaches  to  sustainability,  but \nrequire  support  in  the  transformation  to  fully  licensed  and \nregulated MFIs. \n \nThe  goal  of  MSDP  is  to  create  a  strong,  commercially  viable \nmicrofinance  sector.  The  purpose  is  to  establish  a  regulated \nmicrofinance  market  in  which  MSEs  and  poor  households  have \naccess \nthrough  sustainable \nmicrofinance institutions. \n \n\nfinancial  products  provided \n\nlegal,  and  regulatory \n\nframework  needs \n\nto \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nThe  Sector  Development \nProgram \n\npolicy \n\n(iv)  an \n\ncommittee \n\nlegal  and \n\nthat  supports \n\n(ii)  developing  an  effective \n\ninvestment  component  piloting \n\nsteering \ntechnical  working  group \n\nMSDP  components  include  (i)  development  of  policy,  legal, \nregulatory,  and  institutional  measures  to  develop  a  microfinance \nindustry;  (ii)  capacity  building  for  the  National  Bank  of  Tajikistan \n(NBT) in regulating and supervising MFIs; (iii) capacity building for \nNGOs  being  transformed  into  formally  licensed  and  regulated \nMFIs;  and \nthe \ntransformation of selected NGO microcredit programs. \n \nThe  purpose  is  to  create  a  legal,  regulatory,  and  supervisory \nenvironment \nthe  development  of  a  strong, \ncommercially viable microfinance sector. The components include \n(i)  adopting  a  strategy  and  policy  to  develop  the  microfinance \nregulatory \nsector; \nenvironment  for  microfinance;  and  (iii)  establishing  institutions  to \noversee the development of microfinance. \n \nThe key reform measures include (i) introduction of a government \nfor  microfinance;  (ii)  establishment  of  a \npolicy  statement \n(MPSC); \nmicrofinance \n(iii) establishment  of  a \n(TWG); \nlaw  on  microfinance  organizations; \n(iv) introduction  of  a \n(v) harmonizing of laws and regulations on MFIs, with Parliament \napproving amendments; (vi) NBT approval of regulations for MFIs; \nand  (vii)  issuance  of  operating  licenses  to  two  deposit-taking \nMFIs. \n \nA  loan  of  SDR2.934  million  ($4  million  equivalent)  is  proposed \nfrom  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  resources.  The  loan  will \nhave an amortization period of 24 years, including a grace period \nof 8 years, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% during the \ngrace period and 1.5% thereafter. \n \nThe  loan  will  be  released  in  two  tranches.  The  first,  $1.5  million \nequivalent,  will  be  released  on  loan  effectiveness,  and  the \nsecond,  $2.5  million  equivalent,  within  two  years  of  the  date  of \nloan  effectiveness,  subject  to  compliance  with  the  agreed-on \nconditions.  An  incentive  tranche  of  $1  million  equivalent  will  be \nconsidered  for  release  before  the  second  tranche  if  the  law  on \nmicrofinance  organizations \nratified  by  Parliament,  and \nregulations for MFIs are approved by NBT. \n \nNBT  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  will  cooperate  on  the \nreform measures with the ministries of finance, justice, and state \nrevenues  and  duties.  A  project  management  unit  (PMU)  will  be \nestablished in NBT. \n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  foreign  exchange \ncosts  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB) member countries, excluding negative listed items. \n\nis \n\nThe Policy Loan     \nObjectives And Scope \n\nPolicy Framework and \n\nActions \n\n Loan Amount and Terms  \n \n \n \n \n \nProgram Period and \n\nTranching \n\nExecuting Agency \n\n Procurement \n\n\f The Investment Loan \nObjectives and Scope \n\n Cost Estimates and \n\nFinancing \n\n \n\nv\n\ninto \n\ntransforming  unregulated  credit  programs \n\nThe  objective  of  the  investment  loan  is  to  expand  the  outreach \nand sustainability of MFIs that serve MSEs and poor households \nby \nlicensed, \nregulated  financial  institutions.  The  scope  has  four  components: \n(i) legal and regulatory framework, (ii) establishment of MFIs, (iii) \ninstitutional  strengthening  of  NBT  and  MFIs,  and  (iv)  project \nmanagement.  The  scope  is  nationwide,  with  the  geographical \nfocus dependent on where the selected NGOs willing to become \nMFIs have microfinance operations. \n \nThe total cost of the investment project is $5.31 million equivalent. \nADB  will  finance  $4  million  equivalent  from  ADF  resources;  the \nGovernment will finance $390,000; NGOs and/or MFIs, $700,000; \nand clients/beneficiaries, $220,000. \n \n\nArrangements \n\n Implementation \n\n Loan Amount and Terms  A  loan  of  SDR2.934  million  ($4  million  equivalent)  is  proposed \nfrom ADF resources. The loan will have an amortization period of \n32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8 years,  with  an  interest \ncharge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5 \nthereafter.  \n \nThe arrangements include the MPSC, National Bank of Tajikistan \n(NBT), PMU, and TWG. The MPSC, chaired by NBT, will include \nrepresentatives  of  key  government  agencies,  NBT,  and  NGOs, \nand will be responsible for overall coordination of the project and \nserve  as  the  main  forum  for  discussion  of  microfinance  policy. \nNBT is the Executing Agency and will coordinate project activities, \nensure proper reporting, and serve as the focal point for ADB and \nNGOs/MFIs.  NBT  will  appoint  a  project  director  and  establish  a \nPMU  to  implement  project  activities.  TWG  will  lead  in  identifying \nkey  issues  in  microfinance  development  and  the  creation  of  an \nenabling  legal  and  regulatory  environment;  facilitate  cooperation \namong key agencies and NGOs; and address operational issues \nrelated to microfinance and MFIs. \n \nThe investment project will be implemented over 4 years and the \nloan completely drawn down in 5 years. \n \nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  will  be  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. A total of 86 person-months of \nconsulting  services/technical  assistance,  comprising  14  person-\nmonths  of  international  and  72  person-months  of  domestic \nexpertise,  will  be  provided  by  an  international  consulting  firm \nrecruited  in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants by ADB and its Borrowers using the quality and cost-\nbased selection method. \n\n Period of Utilization \n \n\nConsulting Services \n\n Procurement and \n\n Estimated Project \n\nCompletion Date \n\n \n\n \n\n31 December 2007 \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nBenefits And Impact \n\nMSDP  will  provide  an  improved  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory \nenvironment  that  will  allow  the  formalization  of  unregulated \nfinancial  activity.  An  enabling  environment  combined  with \nsubstantial  capacity  building  will  result  in  the  transformation  of \nexisting  NGO  microcredit  programs  into  licensed  and  regulated \nMFIs.  New  ones  may  also  be  established  to  increase  diversity \nwithin  the  financial  sector.  Through  the  licensing  of  at  least  two \ndeposit-taking  MFIs,  the  number  of  borrowers  will  increase  from \n15,000 to 38,000 in five years, and increase MFIs\u2019 loan portfolio to \n$4  million.  Formalized  microcredit  provided  through  viable  MFIs \nwill  benefit  thousands  of  MSEs,  which  rely  mainly  on  their  own \nsavings to fund their activities. With improved, constant access to \nloans, MSEs can expand, benefiting the owners and their families \ndirectly, and the broader economy indirectly. MSEs, the poor, and \nrural  dwellers  will  benefit  directly  from  accessible  facilities  to \nsafeguard savings. \n\nthat \n\nfacing \n\nthe  project  are \n\n(i)  an  unstable \nThe  main \nrisks \nmacroeconomic  environment \nimpacts  negatively  on \nsubsectors where MSEs operate, (ii) ineffective implementation of \nthe law on microfinance organizations and regulations, (iii) delays \nor difficulties in harmonizing related laws and the tax code as they \nrelate to MFIs, (iv) delays or problems in the transformation and/or \nestablishment  of  MFIs,  (v)  operational  and  financial  risks  of \nparticipating  commercial  banks  (PCBs),  and  (vi)  operational  and \nfinancial risks of MFIs. \n \nAll \nthese  will  be  addressed  by  mitigating  measures.  The \nreform  has  been \nGovernment's  continued  commitment \ndemonstrated  in  the  Poverty  Reduction  Growth  Facility  recently \nsigned  with \nInternational  Monetary  Fund.

The  commitment  of  USAID  and  IFC  to  individual  NGO \nprograms and their transformation further reduces the risk of (iv). \nPCBs\u2019  operational  and  financial  risk  will  be  mitigated  by  strict \ncriteria and performance monitoring developed under the project, \nsupported  by  consulting  services,  thus  mitigating  risk  (v).  MFIs\u2019 \noperational  and  financial  risks  referred  to  in  item  (vi)  will  be \nmitigated through training and institutional capacity building to be \nprovided to MFIs through the attached TA. Operational risk can be \nfurther mitigated by MFI borrowing on the credit line to finance the \npurchase  of  appropriate \nto \nInformation \nimprove accounting and financial reporting.  \n \nThe  objective  of  the  TA  is  to  develop  viable  MFIs  capable  of \nserving  the  poor.  The  purpose  is  to  strengthen  the  supervisory \ncapacity of NBT and the capacity of MFIs to provide microfinance \nservices efficiently and cost-effectively. The total cost of the TA is \nestimated  at  $776,200  equivalent,  comprising  local  currency  and \nforeign currency costs. ADB will finance $640,000 equivalent, and \nthe Government and NGOs the balance of $136,200 equivalent in \nkind.  The  TA  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  ADB-\nfunded TA Special Fund. ADB will recruit individual consultants in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by ADB \nand its Borrowers. \n\ntechnology  systems \n\n \n\n \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  two  proposed \nloans to the Republic of Tajikistan for the Microfinance Systems Development Program (MSDP). \nThe report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Institutional Strengthening of \nMicrofinance  Systems,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loans,  I,  acting  under  the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES1 \n\nA. \n\nMacroeconomic Context \n\nSince  independence  in  1991,  Tajikistan  has  been  in  transition  to  a  market-oriented \n2. \neconomy.  The  macroeconomic  situation  has  steadily  improved,  with  significant  growth  and \nstabilization supported by structural reforms.2 Economic growth gained  momentum  after 1997, \nalthough  the  Russian  crisis  caused  a  downturn  in  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  from \n5.3%  in  1998  to  3.7%  in  1999.  Following  increased  cotton  and  aluminum  production,  which \ntogether account for about two thirds of export earnings, GDP growth rebounded 8.3% in 2000, \n10.0% in 2001, and 8.0% in 2002. Inflation stabilized at 27.5% in 1999, but slid to 38.6% in 2001 \ndue  to  external  factors  and  problematic  implementation  of  monetary  policy.  The  International \nMonetary Fund (IMF) estimates inflation to decline to 13% in 2002, and further to 5% by 2004.  \n \n3. \nTajikistan  is  highly  dependent  on  foreign  trade,  with  exports  constituting  70%  of  GDP. \nThe  external  current  account  deficit  increased  from  6.6%  of  GDP  in  2000  to  7.0%  in  2001. \nGross foreign exchange reserves stood at 2.1 months of imports at the end of 2001. \n \n4. \nDuring  the  May  2001  Consultative  Group  Meeting  a  financing  gap  of  $26 million  was \nestimated  in  the  budget  for  2002.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  agreed  to  provide \nassistance for the ongoing transition reform agenda, particularly in rural finance and agriculture. \nTajikistan has a high publicly guaranteed external debt burden equivalent to 87% of GDP, due \nto large nonconcessional bilateral borrowings. IMF imposed a debt ceiling of 3% of GDP on the \nexternally  financed  Public  Investment  Program  beginning  in  2002.  Under  the  $128-million \nPoverty  Reduction  Growth  Facility  (PRGF)  (1999\u20132001),  the  Government  failed  to  meet  all  its \nstructural  adjustment  targets  and  misreported  external  debt  levels.  IMF  introduced  a  staff-\nmonitored program from October 2001. An $87-million 3-year PRGF was signed in December \n2002.  \n \n5. \nTajikistan, one of the poorest republics of the former Soviet Union (FSU), stands out as \none of the poorest countries in Asia. Despite progress made since independence, overall living \nstandards have deteriorated drastically, particularly in rural areas, due to the civil war, general \neconomic  contraction,  and  loss  of  social  services.  Tajikistan  ranks  110th  among  174  states \nbased  on  the  human  development  index,  with  an  estimated  per  capita  gross  national  product \n\n                                                 \n1  A project preparatory TA was not conducted for this program. However, a small-scale TA, 3555-TAJ: Support for \nRural  Financial  Systems  Development,  approved  on  6  December  2000,  helped  develop  policy,  legal,  and \nregulatory measures.

Country Assistance Plan (2001-2003). Manila. ADB.  \n\u2014\u2014\u2014. July 2001. Country Strategy Program Update (2002-2004). Manila. ADB.  \n\n\f2\n\n \n\n \n\n(GNP)  of  $290.  The  1999  Tajik  Living  Standards  Survey  indicates  that  over  80%  of  the  6.2 \nmillion people live in poverty, with about 30% \u201dvery poor\u201d and nearly 20% \u201dextremely poor.\u201d3  \n \n6. \nPoverty in rural areas, where 75% of the people live, is more acute than in urban areas. \nThe proportion of people living in extreme poverty is 23.4% in rural areas, and 18.6% in urban \nareas. Only 56% of able-bodied citizens are formally employed, leaving nearly half the working \npopulation  to  look  for  income-generating  opportunities  on  their  own.  Poor  people  engage  in  a \nnumber  of  such  activities  to  make  ends  meet.  In  the  poorest  households,  the  single  largest \nsource of income accounts for only a third of total household income.  \n \n7. \nThe  most  vulnerable  groups  include  pensioners,  the  disabled,  single-headed  family \nhouseholds,  families  with  five  or  more  children,  teachers,  doctors,  and  the  unemployed.  An \nimportant finding of the Tajik Living Standards Survey was that financial hardship is not limited \nto  the  poorest.  Over  25%  of  all  households  have  sold  assets  and  about  33%  have  borrowed \nmoney to buy food. \n \nPoverty  has  a  gender  dimension.  While  poverty  incidence  does  not  vary  between  men \n8. \nand women, the transition has affected women disproportionately due to (i) the collapse of the \nsocial  allowance  and  services;  (ii)  women\u2019s  income  being  four  times  lower  than  men\u2019s;  (iii) \nfemale-headed households having less access to land, irrigation, and agriculture; (iv) women\u2019s \nunemployment being marginally higher than men\u2019s;4 and (v) women being employed mainly in \nthe  low-paid  sectors  such  as  agriculture,  education,  and  health.  The  Government  has  set \npoverty  reduction  as  its  primary  objective,  requiring  a  comprehensive  and  long-term  strategy. \nThe National Poverty Reduction Strategy, endorsed by Parliament on 24 June 2002, focuses on \n(i)  accelerated,  socially  fair,  labor-intensive,  and  export-oriented  economic  growth;  (ii)  efficient \nand  fair  provision  of  basic  social  services;  (iii)  targeted  support  to  the  poorest  groups  of  the \npopulation; and (iv) efficient governance and improvement in security. \n \nMicrofinance  reduces  poverty.  The  small  number  of  micro-  and  small  enterprises \n9. \n(MSEs),  poor  households,  and  rural  dwellers  who  have  access  to  microcredit  have  benefited \nfrom increased and stable incomes. Microfinance is limited to microcredit. Access to small loans \nprovides  working  capital  to  simple  businesses  that  need cash.  In  a  very  poor  country  such  as \nTajikistan,  where  people  have  little  savings,  credit  is  one  of  the  few  sources  of  investment \ncapital.  Microcredit \nits  provision  must  be \ninstitutionalized. New financial services, especially deposit taking, are also important. As MSEs \ngrow, they generate small surpluses that can be reinvested or used to meet household needs. \nCase studies from nongovernment organization (NGO) microcredit programs in Supplementary \nAppendix 1 document the positive impact of microfinance on poverty reduction.  \n \nB. \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\nthousands  of  rural  MSEs,  and \n\nfueling \n\nis \n\n1. \n\nBanking Subsector \n\n10. \nTajikistan  has  a  two-tier  banking  system  comprising  National  Bank  of  Tajikistan  (NBT, \nthe  central  bank);  14  commercial  banks  (4  of  which  are  predominately  state-owned  and  10 \n\n                                                 \n3  World  Bank  (WB).  June  2000. Republic  of  Tajikistan:  Poverty  Assessment,  Report  No.  20285-TJ,  29The  level  of \npoverty varies according to the poverty line used from 17% (using a poverty line of $1.075 a day) to 96% (using the \nminimum consumption basket) (page 18).  \n\n4  While women suffer higher unemployment (29%) than men (25%), women\u2019s share in the workforce has increased \n\nas men migrate for work. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 3\n\nrestructuring  plan  Tajikbankbusiness  was \n\nprivately owned); one branch of a foreign-owned bank; and two loan societies. The country has \nno  stock  market  and  only  a  few  insurance  companies.  Banking  sector  reforms  have  helped \nreduce the number of banks from 27 in 1998 to 14. Minimum capital requirements were raised \nfrom $300,000 in 1996 to $1.5 million for existing banks in 2001. To obtain a license, new banks \nneed $3 million in charter capital. The banking sector continues to be dominated by four banks: \nSavingsbank,  Orionbank,5  Tajikevesheconombank,  and  Agroinvestbank,  which \ntogether \naccounted for 85% of banking sector assets as of November 2002. Overall, the banks have a \nparticularly poor record in loan recovery: the four largest banks' nonperforming loans are equal \nto nearly 94% of their total portfolios. The smaller private banks do better, although still poorly \nby any measure, with 36% of their aggregate loan portfolios nonperforming.  \n \n11. \nNBT has been strengthened but the financial position and operational efficiency of banks \nremain  weak.  The  Problem  Bank  Unit  has  been  established  in  NBT\u2019s  Bank  Supervision \nDepartment.  Under  a \nliquidated,  and \nTajikvesheconombank,  Agroinvestbank,  and  Savingsbank  are  being  restructured.  The \nremaining  banks  cater  mostly  to  a  small  business  clientele  and  shareholder-related  interests. \nSavingsbank is wholly state owned, with other banks either completely privately owned or partly \nowned by ministries, state-owned enterprises, or state-owned farms. Only 8 of 14 banks meet \nthe  $1.5-million  capital  requirement.  The  planned  increase  of  this  requirement  to  $3  million  is \nlikely to lead to further closures. As of July 2002, 3 of 14 banks, accounting for only 12% of total \nbanking sector assets, had met all prudential requirements and on the basis of waivers provided \nby NBT. \n \n12. \nIn 2002 banking sector assets accounted for about 14% of GDP. The amount of lending \nto  the  cotton  sector  is  estimated  to  be  12%  of  GDP  (7%  in  1999).  Credit  to  the  non-cotton \nprivate sector represents barely 2% of GDP. The extreme and growing concentration of lending \nto the cotton sector, given its vulnerability to external price shocks, has a predictably deleterious \neffect  on  system-wide  loan  recovery.  Interest  rates  on  commercial  bank  loans  of  3\u20136-month \ntenor  average  25-30%  per  annum,  while  the  rates  on  3\u20136-month  term  deposits  are  close  to \n22%. The high deposit rates reflect the lack of public confidence in banks, which must offer high \nrates to the public and are, in turn, rewarded with little deposit activity. Rates on treasury bills \naverage about 15%. NBT's discount rate for loans to commercial banks was 20% in February \n2003. Loans are mainly short term.  \n \n13. \nTajikistan suffers from the lowest degree of monetization among members of FSU. The \ndeposit  base  of  banks  was  close  to  $28  million  at  the  end  of  2001,  equivalent  to  only  20%  of \nprivate  sector  credits,  compared  to  an  international  norm  of  around  120%  or  more.  Banks \nappear to be increasing their deposit taking, reflecting increased confidence in the currency, as \nwell  as  positive  real  interest  rates.  The  volume  of  Tajik  workers'  remittances  flowing  in  from \nabroad  is  increasing.  Still,  the  overall  level  of  deposits  remains  low,  with  total  deposits \nequivalent  to  4%  of  GDP.6  The  banking  sector  has  yet  to  prove  itself  capable  of  mobilizing \nsavings from the public and channeling loans to creditworthy borrowers.  \n \n\n                                                 \n5  The  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development  (EBRD)  and  the  International  Finance  Corporation  are \nshareholders. It has the strongest capital Orion Bank also manages the EBRD small and medium-sized enterprise \ncredit line for these banks.  \n\n6  These credit and deposit levels are in marked contrast to those of Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, with domestic \ncredit at 31-44% of GDP, and deposits at 22-33% of GDP. Russia and Ukraine have deposits equal to nearly 20% \nof GDP.  \n\n\f4\n\n \n\n \n\nThe  Government  has  started  to  strengthen  confidence  in  the  banking  sector  by \n14. \n(i) increasing  the  minimum  capital  requirement  with  partial  holding  in  foreign  exchange, \n(ii) enforcing  full  loan  loss  provisioning,  (iii)  making  loan  loss  provisions  100%  tax  deductible, \nand  (iv)  assessing  tax  liabilities  of  banks  according  to  their  fixed  rather  than  total  assets. \nContinued rehabilitation, restructuring, and renovation of the banking subsector are critical and \nbeing supported by the World Bank and IMF.  \n \n\n2. \n\nNongovernment Organizations and Microfinance \n\n15. \nNGO  microcredit  activities  commenced  in  1993  with  the  Aga  Khan  Foundation  (AKF) \nthrough  its  Aga  Khan  Development  Network  (AKDN).  These  programs  have  focused  on \nhumanitarian  relief  and  poverty  reduction  with  microcredit  as  a  component  of  more  diversified \nprograms.  These  NGOs  have  been  financed  by  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies,  and \ninternational NGOs, mostly on a grant basis. \n \n16. \nThe country\u2019s 17 microcredit programs mostly target the rural poor, mainly women and \nvulnerable groups. In most NGO microcredit programs, over 50% of clients, sometimes nearly \n100%, are women. Twelve programs include cash disbursements, and the rest provide credit in \nkind.  By  the  end  of  2001,  NGO  microcredit  programs  had  disbursed  cash  loans  of  more  than \n$6.6  million  to  44,000  borrowers7  and  had  an  aggregate  loan  portfolio  of  $3.0  million,  with  an \naverage  borrower  balance  of  $94.  Around  20,000  more  families  receive  credit  in  kind.  The \nseven largest NGOs, each with a cash loan portfolio exceeding $100,000, account for 94% of all \nborrowers and 97% of total loans outstanding as of the end of 2001. The microfinance market is \ndominated  by  three  NGOs:  AKDN,  National  Association  of  Business  Women  in  Tajikistan \n(NABWT),  and  Agency  for  Technical  Cooperation  and  Development  (ACTED),  accounting  for \nnearly  80%  of  clients.  Four  NGOs  (AKDN,  NABWT,  ACTED,  and  the  Development  Fund) \naccount for 85% of loans outstanding. Six of the larger NGOs had an aggregate 37% growth in \nclients and 79% growth in loan portfolio in 2001. While the aggregate NGO loan portfolio was \nequal to 6% of banking sector assets in 2001, it involved three times the number of households \nserved by the banking sector.  \n \n17. \nNGO credit programs serve far more customers than banks by offering microloans to the \npoor.  Most  microlending  is  to  groups:  95%  by  number  of  loans  and  75%  by  loan  amount. \nLending  is  commonly  for  1\u20133  months  for  group-based  borrowers  and  12  months  for  individual \nborrowers.  Most  groups  have  7\u201312  members.  Individual-member  loan  size  within  groups  is \nusually $20\u2013100, and for individuals, usually $300\u2013$3,000, up to $5,000. Interest rates on group \nlending  are 2\u20134%  per month  and around  2% per  month  for  individual  lending.  Most  lending  is \ndenominated in dollars but disbursed in somoni. Most lending is in the rural areas. Only three \nNGOs  lend  in  urban  areas,  and  mainly  to  groups.  Three  NGOs  have  achieved  loan  recovery \nrates higher than 98% of total lending. Loan loss rates in individual lending have been less than \nfor group lending. Unlike banks, NGO credit programs have developed a culture of repayment \namong  clients.  The  high  rates  of  repayment  in  microfinance  also  demonstrate  that  the  credit \nproducts and underwriting standards and methodology used are appropriate. \n \nThe collection of savings is common to many group lending programs, with saved funds \n18. \naccumulated within the groups and re-lent to members. Poor rural households, in groups, save \nTJS0.5\u20132.0  ($0.08\u20132.0)  each  per  month.  For  wealthier  households,  savings  of  TJS20  ($8.00) \nper month per person are common. One program has more than $53,000 in voluntary savings, \nand another, more than $15,000 in compulsory savings. \n                                                 \n7Consultative Group on Assisting the Poorest (CGAP). 2002. Microfinance Sector Assessment. Tajikistan. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 5\n\n \n19.  Most  NGOs  serve  more  than  one  region.  Khatlon  accounts  for  47%  of  borrowers. \nCoverage, calculated as total borrowers divided by total households, is 5.3% in Khatlon, 4.6% in \nRepublican  Subordination,  1.2%  in  Sughd,  and  30%  in  Gorno-Badakhshan  through  village \norganizations serviced by the AKDN. Loans outstanding from all NGOs total $600,000\u2013900,000 \nper region, underlining the relative lack of NGO credit programs throughout the country. \n \nC. \n\nKey Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nViable and Sustainable Institutions \n\n20. \nTajikistan  has  a  relatively  young,  underdeveloped,  and  inefficient  financial  sector \ndominated  by  a  few  banks.  The  banking  subsector  and  the  smaller  set  of  unlicensed  and \nunregulated  NGOs  together  are  unable  to  meet  the  demand  for  basic  financial  services. \nDemand  for  financial  services  of  all  kinds  is  vast  and  unmet.  Rural  enterprises  and  farming \nhouseholds,  which  often  engage  in  a  variety  of  income-generating  on-  and  off-farm  activities, \nhave  little  access  to  credit  due  to  limited  funds,  perceived  high  risk  of  agriculture  activity,  and \nhigh administration costs in making small loans. Savings mobilization, particularly in rural areas, \nis almost nonexistent.  \n \nAssuming  that  20%  of  rural  and  10%  of  urban  households  make  up  the  market  for \n21. \nmicrofinance, at least 150,000 households, or nearly five times the present combined outreach \nof  all  NGO  microcredit  programs,  could  benefit  from  microfinance.  Most  rural  households  are \nwithout access to deposit services. Based on trends registered in the past two years by NGOs, \nan annual growth rate of 17.5% in numbers of households would yield an outreach of 150,000 \nhouseholds in  10  years.  Satisfying  projected  loan  demand,  assuming  small  individual  loans  of \n$50\u2013300, would require $25 million in new lending. Aggregate NGO microlending for 2001 was \n$3 million. Achieving an average household savings balance of $30 per year for 300,000 rural \nhouseholds  would  provide  a  rural  savings  balance  of  $9  million,  an  amount  equal  to  total \ndomestic  currency  deposits  held  by  banks  in  2000.  Financial  service  providers  need  to  be \nencouraged to intensify efforts to provide services to this large potential market. \n \nViable and sustainable financial institutions capable of providing basic financial services \n22. \nto  the  public  are  almost  completely  lacking.  None  of  the  NGOs  have  achieved  financial \nsustainability.  Inadequate  accounting,  portfolio,  and  management  information  systems  reflect \nweak  governance  and  internal  control.  Financial  intermediation  activities  are  inadequately \nseparated from social ones with regard to financial reporting and staffing. The range of financial \nproducts is limited. The present volume of business is insufficient to allow for full cost recovery \non  operations  and  the  creation  of  an  equity  base  out  of  profits.  Focus  on  organizational  and \nfinancial  planning  is  lacking.  Recently,  however,  three  NGOs  have  begun  to  become  more \ncommercialized  and  specialized  microfinance  institution  (MFIs)  through  (i)  separation  of  head \noffice  from  branch  operations,  (ii)  adoption  of  new  charts  of  accounts  to  produce  financial \nstatements  that  relate  only  to  microfinance  activities,  (iii)  a  search  for  appropriate  accounting \nand  management  software,  (iv)  reorganization  of  departments  and  reallocation  of  staff,  (v) \nimprovements  in  internal  controls  (particularly  internal  audit),  (vi)  separation  of  oversight  from \noperational functions, and (vii) a search for appropriate forms of legal entity and ownership. \n \n23. \nFor  all  their  limitations,  NGOs  are  providing  the  bulk  of  rural  financial  services. \nSubstantial trust already exists between NGOs and their customers, which is a sound basis for \noperation  expansion.  While  NGO  programs  have  institutional  weaknesses,  many  are  now \nexamining ways to become commercially viable. Funds to expand lending, however, will need to \n\n\f6\n\n \n\n \n\ncome  from  a  balanced  mix  of  deposit  mobilization,  borrowings,  and  equity  capital,  which  will \nonly  be  attracted  by  an  appropriate  institutional  form,  maintenance  of  a  well-performing  loan \nportfolio,  and  close  and  responsive  ties  with  communities.  Market  demand  assumes  financial \ngrowth and customer outreach far in excess of the grant resources and/or loan financing likely \nto  be  made  available  to  NGOs  from  international  or  other  external  sources.  Therefore, \nintervention is warranted to develop a sustainable microfinance sector to expand access by the \npoor and rural dwellers to financial services.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPolicy on Microfinance \n\n24. \nThe enabling environment for microfinance suffers from the absence of defined policies \nand  mechanisms,  hindering  NGO  microcredit  programs  from  becoming  commercially  viable \nproviders of diversified financial services. The Government aims to create a formal microfinance \nsector,  in  which  some  NGO  microcredit  programs  will  be  transformed  into  licensed  and \nregulated MFIs. The development policy letter (Appendix 3) indicates the Government's strong \nsupport  for  the  creation  of  a  new,  fully  regulated  financial  subsector  free  of  the  enormous \nproblems of the banks, and targeting most of the population with basic financial services. The \npolicy  letter  recognizes  the  Government's  responsibility  to  establish  an  enabling  legal  and \nregulatory environment for microfinance and encourages NGOs to become regulated MFIs.  \n \n\n3. \n\nExisting Legislation \n\n25. \nNGOs  are  registered  under  the  Law  on  Public  Organizations,  which  applies  only  to \nNGOs  supported  by  external  funding.  The  Law  on  State  Registration  of  Juridical  Persons  and \nLaw on Joint Stock Companies cover the registration of various commercial and noncommercial \nentities, which depends on the form of organization and ownership. Individuals and enterprises, \nhowever, are required to register as a juridical person, and both are assumed to make a profit \nand  so  are  subject  to  a  variety  of  taxes.  Registration  as  a  noncommercial  entity,  which  would \nlogically mean being exempt from profit or income tax (but not necessarily from other taxes), is \ngenerally  not  allowed.  Given  the  changing  status  of  legislation  for  registration,  and  the \nimplications of registering as a commercial or noncommercial entity, it is not clear under which \nlaws NGO credit programs should operate.  \n \n26. \nLicensing of financial institutions is the responsibility of NBT. Whether NGOs operating \nmicrocredit programs should also be registered and licensed with NBT is unclear. As NGOs and \nMFIs will operate varying microfinance programs involving different levels of deposit, credit, and \ntransfer  services,  a  classification  system  of  various  microfinance  organizations  with  relevant \nregistration and licensing requirements and procedures is required. \n \n27. \ninternational \nagreements, thereby removing them from most legislation, including the Tax Code. But the legal \nand regulatory environment focuses on banks and does not provide for the legal establishment \nand  operation  of  NGO  microcredit  programs  and  potential  MFIs.  Laws  do  not  specifically \nrecognize MFIs. They operate differently from other financial institutions, particularly commercial \nbanks, and the legislation needs to reflect these differences.8  \n \n28. \nThe  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)  and  International \nFinance  Corporation  (IFC),  in  close  consultation  with  ADB,  support  the  drafting  of  the  law  on \n\nNGOs  operating  microcredit  programs  now  do  so \n\nlargely  under \n\n                                                 \n8  MFIs differ from commercial banks in that customer transactions are smaller, borrowers are less diverse, the range \n\nof financial products is limited, and MFIs usually do not clear checks. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 7\n\nmicrofinance organizations (microfinance law). The draft is being circulated to stakeholders for \ncomment to define the issues related to the legal framework of NGO credit programs and MFIs. \n \n29. \nIn 1999 the new Tax Code was introduced. The country has 17 national and local taxes. \nAlthough  the  code  is  comprehensive,  assessment  and  frequency  of  collection  are  variable. \nBesides  efforts  to  draft  a  comprehensive  law  regularizing  and  governing  MFI  operations, \ndisparate elements of the code that affect, or potentially affect, MFIs should be harmonized.  \n \n\n4. \n\nRegulation and Supervision \n\n30.  While  the  reform  measures  have  reduced  the  number  of  banks,  ongoing  bank \nrestructurings still burden the 32 NBT Supervision Department staff members, who must resolve \nissues of bank liquidations, bank mergers, and recapitalization; oversee installation and use of \ninternational  accounting  standards  (IAS)  in  all  banks;  improve  off-  and  on-site  monitoring \nsystems  and  procedures;  and  deal  with  continuing  financial  and  management  weaknesses  of \nremaining  banks.  Supervision  is  made  more  difficult  by  the  large  number  of  bank  branches \n(130) and representative offices (over 130). To supervise MFIs, NBT will need more resources \nand  staff,  who  will  require  intensive  training.  Staff  will  need  to  develop  regulations  for  MFIs, \nlicense them, review and analyze regular reports received from them, and inspect them on site \nto enforce compliance with regulations.  \n \nD. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n31. \nADB has considerable experience with microfinance operations in several countries but \nlimited experience in the FSU transition economies, particularly in transforming NGO microcredit \nprograms into licensed and regulated MFIs. MSDP will be ADB\u2019s first experience with a broad \nsector  development  program  in  a  transition  economy.9  Lessons  are  drawn  from  ADB\u2019s \nexperience  in  rural  finance  from  transition  economies,  and  from  transformation  operations  in \nother countries. \n \nThe lessons10 highlight the importance of (i) following a financial systems development \n32. \napproach to provide an enabling environment for commercial microfinance, (ii) focusing on poor \nclients to reduce poverty, (iii) working within the capacity of participating financial institutions to \nminimize distraction from their main functions and to avoid raising their administrative costs, and \n(iv) maximizing the impact of capacity building by providing TA over a period of time and not as \nan isolated instance. Because rural financial markets consist of different market segments with \nmarkedly diverse characteristics, a multiagency approach is necessary to meet different sectors\u2019 \ndemand for financial services.  \n \n33. \nKyrgyz Republic and Mongolia.11 Key lessons include the following:  \n \n \n                                                 \n9  ADB\u2019s  sector  development  operations \n\nADB  has  two  ongoing  projects  to  establish  savings  and  credit  union  systems  in  the \n\nin  microfinance  were  Loans  1805-PAK(SF):  Microfinance  Sector \nDevelopment Program, for $70 million; and 1806-PAK: Microfinance Sector Development Project, for $80 million, \napproved on 13 December 2000. \n\n10 ADB.

All are widely regarded as successful based on the criteria of outreach and \nself-sustainability12  due  to  (i)  favorable  macroeconomic,  agricultural,  and  rural  policies; \n(ii) adequate  investment  in  physical  and  social  rural  infrastructure;  (iii)  high  degree  of \nmanagement  autonomy  in  operational  policy  formulation;  (iv)  staff  policies  that  stress  training, \naccountability, and reward through monetary incentives and promotion; (v) innovative, low-cost \ndistribution systems, and mobile banking; (vi) innovative and flexible loan terms and conditions; \n(vii) close monitoring of loan performance, high collection rates, and low arrears; (viii) domestic \nsavings mobilization as a growing source of funds, diminishing or eliminating the need for aid; \n(ix)  real  positive  and  often  relatively  high  on-lending  interest  rates  covering  costs;  and \n(x) administrative expense control. \n \n35. \nIn  recent  years  a  number  of  NGOs  have  been  transformed  into  fully  licensed  and \nregulated  MFIs  providing  microcredit  services:  CARD  Bank  in  the  Philippines,  Association  of \nCambodian  Local  Economic  Development  Agencies,  Bancosol  in  Bolivia,  and  XAC  Bank  in \nMongolia.  The  key  factors  to  the  success  of  their  transformation  include  (i)  a  visionary \nmanagement team, (ii) comprehensive staff development programs, (iii) adoption of accounting \npolicies  and  practices  based  upon  international  standards,  (iv)  new  management  information \nsystems to meet reporting requirements of regulators and/or supervisors and to track loans; and \n(v) development of new products and processes to meet demand. \n \nThe  lessons  have  been  incorporated  into  the  design  of  MSDP  and,  where  possible, \n36. \nreinforced  through  the  policy  loan,  investment  loan,  and  TA.  The  design  is  flexible  to  allow \nintroduction of the best practices during implementation. \n \nE. \n\nInternational Assistance and Coordination13 \n\n37. \nNGO  microcredit  programs  have  been  receiving  international  assistance  from  United \nNations  agencies;  World  Bank,  through  the  Tajik  Social  Investment  Fund  (TASIF);  European \nUnion and member partners and organizations; USAID, through Mercy Corps International and \nEurasia Foundation; AKF; ACTED; and CARE International. \n \n38. \nInterest  in  microfinance  development  in  Tajikistan  is  increasing  as  evidenced  by  the \nparticipation at the inaugural funding agency meeting14 on microfinance on 7 February 2002, in \n\n                                                 \n12 Yaron,  Jacon,  Benjamin  McDonald  Jr.,  and  Gerda  Piprek.  1996.

Several multilateral, bilateral, and international NGO agencies expressed interest in \nsupporting  legal  and  regulatory  reform,  capacity  building,  and  provision  of  credit.  About  $16 \nmillion  was  estimated  to  be  provided  over  the  next  several  years.  Besides  ADB,  the  key \nagencies  include  the  World  Bank,  USAID,  IFC,  Islamic  Development  Bank  (IDB)  AKF,  United \nNations  Development  Programme  (UNDP),  Eurasia  Foundation,  Soros  Foundation,  and \ninternational NGOs. \n \n39. \nThe  World  Bank  is  providing  support  through  four  projects.  Under  the  Second \nAdjustment Credit, approved in 2001 for $35 million, the Government is adopting a wide-ranging \nreform  package  that  includes  strengthening  the  financial  sector  through  improved  banking \nsupervision,  disclosure,  and  better  tax  treatment  of  banks.  The  Farm  Privatization  Support \nProject, approved in 1999, includes a component to pilot rural savings and credit associations in \nselected provinces to serve newly created private family farms. Support is provided for start-up \ncapital;  a  credit  line  for  on-lending;  the  development  of  rules,  regulations,  and  registration \nrequirements; and training in supervision of NBT staff. This scheme has just commenced. The \nSecond  Poverty  Alleviation  Project15  includes  $1.4  million  to  build  the  capacity  of  the \nmicrofinance unit in TASIF (to be renamed National Social Investment Fund of Tajikistan) and \neligible MFIs, and provide a credit line to MFIs. The Financial Institution and Enterprise Support \nProject  is  scheduled  for  approval  in  late  2002.  It  aims  to  (i)  improve  the  regulatory  and \nenforcement mechanism for the evolution of competitive financial institutions; and (ii) develop a \nsustainable institutional mechanism for the provision of short-, medium-, and long-term credits \nfor micro-, small, medium-sized, and large enterprises, and carry out case-by-case privatization. \n \n40. \nIFC, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the Swiss Secretariat for \nEconomic  Affairs  are  providing  a  $155-million  initiative  primarily  for  lending  to  support  the \nbanking sector in Central Asia, including Tajikistan, and to lend to MSEs. Banks will benefit from \na TA program to strengthen their lending and operational capacity. \n \nUSAID is financing NGO credit programs. In conjunction with IFC, USAID has expanded \n41. \nits  activities  beyond  credit  to  legal  reforms  and  capacity  development.  In  July  2002  USAID \nsigned  an  agreement  to  work  with  NBT  to  (i)  draft  a  microfinance  law,  (ii)  prepare  related \nexplanatory  notes,  and  (iii)  prepare  a  draft  law  on  changes  and  amendments  to  several \nlegislative  acts.  The  first  draft  of  the  microfinance  law  has  been  circulated  for  review  and \ndiscussion,  and  is  hoped  to  be  approved  by  NBT  and  submitted  for  legislative  action  before \nJune  2003.  Besides  supporting  legal  reforms  and  existing  NGO  microcredit  programs,  USAID \nrecently  launched  a  new  microcredit  program  in  the  Ferghana  Valley  as  part  of  the  Regional \nMicrolending  Program  in  Tajikistan  and  Uzbekistan.  ACDI/VOCA  will  provide  technical  and \nfinancial assistance to the newly established Microentrepreneur Development Support Center of \nTajikistan  over  the  next  four  years  to  reach  10,000  self-employed  individuals.  The  center  is \nexpected to be a technically and financially sustainable microlending institution. \n \n42. \nIDB is proposing to provide $1.1 million commencing in 2003 for three years to increase \nthe access of the rural and urban poor and the \"unbankable\", particularly women, to appropriate \nand  reliable  microfinance  services.16  The  project  includes  a  credit  line  of  $700,000  for  two \nNGOs (Sitorai Najot and NABWT); and funds for capacity building, external audit, and a project \nimplementation unit.  \n\n                                                 \n15The Pilot Poverty Alleviation Project was the first major multilateral support to NGOs. It was administered by TASIF, \n\nand funds were channeled to several NGO microcredit programs. \n\n16 Islamic Development Bank. Appraisal Mission. April 2002. Aide Memoire Between the National Bank of Tajikistan \n\nand the Islamic Development Bank. \n\n\f10\n\n \n\n \n\n \n43. \nAKDN  has  two  programs  with  microfinance  components  and  might  consolidate  these \nprograms  under  a  microfinance  bank,  which  will  be  established  under  the  banking  laws  and \nprovide a large range of financial services and broad geographical outreach. A branch network \nwill be established and target underserved populations in urban and rural areas, and lend retail \nto  individuals  and  groups,  and  wholesale  to  village  organizations,  small  MFIs,  and  financial \ncooperatives.  Products  will  be  developed  to  fit  the  needs  of  the  clientele,  with  a  focus  on \nbuilding  a  sound  deposit  basis.  The  timing  for  the  establishment  of  the  bank  is  not  firm  but  is \nanticipated in the next 12 months. \n \n44. \nUN agencies and international NGOs are expected to provide financial and TA support \nfor  several  existing  microcredit  programs.  The  Soros  Foundation  has  supported  legislative \nreform, and will continue to do so, focusing on microfinance legislation and capacity building for \nMFIs.  The  Eurasia  Fund  will  continue  to  support  training  in  microfinance.  Future  international \nassistance  to  NGOs  is  expected  to  focus  on  skills  training,  support  for  the  startup  and \ndevelopment  of  NGO  programs  in  new  locations,  support  for  the  continuing  development  of \nNGO  systems,  and  lines  of  credit.  The  surge  in  external  funding,  however,  will  be  of  lasting \nbenefit only if it supports the creation of sound and commercially viable MFIs. \n \n45.  While substantial resources are required to build the microfinance industry, and funding \nagencies  have  expressed  a  strong  desire  to  help,  coordination  among  them  is  also  important. \nThey  thus  meet  and  are  in  constant  communication.  At  the  first  funding  agency  meeting  in \nFebruary  2002,  they  agreed  that  ADB  would  lead  in  developing  the  legal  and  regulatory \nframework. The lead role in drafting the microfinance law then passed to USAID and IFC.  \n \nF. \n\nRationale \n\n46. \nTajikistan  has  a  young  and  underdeveloped  financial  sector  that  cannot  meet  demand \nfor  basic  financial  services.  NGOs  provide  the  bulk  of  financial  services,  particularly  in  rural \nareas.  NGOs  have  already  trained  a  large  number  of  groups  of  rural  people  in  basic  lending \nservices, and to a more limited extent, in savings modalities. NGOs and Government, however, \nneed to develop the capacity to manage and regulate formal MFIs. The policy, legal, regulatory, \nand  institutional  environment  is  not  appropriate  to  MFIs,  which  will  thus  be  unable  to  reach \nsignificant  scale  and  provide  financial  services  reliably  and  in  a  sustainable  manner. \nGovernment  and  externally  provided  funds  are  insufficient  to  meet  demand  for  microcredit. \nInstitutional capacity to deliver financial services on a sustainable basis, including deposit-taking \nservices,  is  needed.  MSDP  recognizes  that  the  bulk  of  MFI  resources  must  come  from  the \neconomy  as  savings  mobilization  stimulated  through  sound,  sustainable,  and  regulated  MFIs. \nTherefore, an enabling environment is essential, as is the capacity of NGOs to be transformed \ninto viable MFIs. \n \n47. \nTo  foster  growth,  innovation,  and  diversity  of  financial  institutions,  including  MFIs,  a \ncomprehensive  financial  systems  development  approach  is  required.  It  is  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s microfinance development strategy.17 The proposed MSDP is in line with the four pillars \nof  this  strategy:  (i)  creating  an  enabling  policy  environment;  (ii)  improving  the  financial \ninfrastructure,  specifically  the  legal  and  regulatory  environment;  (iii)  building  the  institutional \nstrength  of  MFIs  to  enhance  their  sustainability  and  outreach;  and  (iv)  encouraging  innovative \nprograms that support the poor.  \n \n                                                 \n17 ADB. 2000. Finance for the Poor: Microfinance Development Strategy. Manila. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 11\n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nProgram Objectives and Scope \n\nThe  goal  of  MSDP  is  to  create  a  strong,  commercially  viable  microfinance  sector.  The \n48. \npurpose  is  to  establish  a  regulated  microfinance  market  in  which  MSEs  and  poor  households \nhave access to financial products provided through sustainable MFIs. The program framework \nis in Appendix 2. \n \n49. \nThe components include (i) the adoption of policy, regulatory, and institutional actions to \ndevelop a microfinance industry; (ii) capacity building for NBT to regulate and supervise MFIs, \nand  for  NGOs  to  become  formally  licensed  and  regulated  MFIs;  and  (iii)  an  investment \ncomponent  piloting  the  transformation  of  selected  NGO  microcredit  programs  into  formally \nlicensed and regulated MFIs. \n \nB. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n50.  MSDP  will  take  steps  to  develop  microfinance  in  Tajikistan.  ADB  and  the  Government \nrecognize  the  important  role  that  existing  NGO  microcredit  programs  can  play  in  developing \nfinancial  markets.  Specifically,  MSDP  will  help  the  Government  establish  a  comprehensive \npolicy,  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  framework  to  develop  a  viable  and  sustainable \nindustry.  This  is  of  particular  importance  in  a  country  recently  emerging  from  civil  war,  while \nadopting a reform agenda to move to a market-oriented system, where an enabling environment \nfor  microfinance  does  not  yet  exist.  This  is  the  first  time  ADB  will  take  such  a  comprehensive \napproach in a transition economy (footnote 9). \n \n51.  MSDP is also involved with NGOs and their transformation into licensed and regulated \nMFIs.  Several  NGO  credit  programs  have  already  been  transformed  into  formal  financial \nthe \ninstitutions.  While  ADB  has  supported  various  microfinance  programs, \nestablishment of NGO microcredit programs, Grameen replicators, and creation of savings and \ncredit  unions  systems,  ADB  has  not  exclusively  focused  on  transforming  NGOs  into  formal \nMFIs.  These  special  features  require  a  consultative  and  flexible  approach,  involving  all  key \nstakeholders.  \n \nC. \n\nThe Policy Loan \n\nincluding \n\nThe policy loan requires the Government to implement a set of agreed-on measures to \n52. \nimprove the operating environment for existing NGO microcredit programs and their subsequent \ntransformation  into  licensed  and  regulated  MFIs.  The  Government\u2019s  development  policy  letter \nand a policy matrix are in Appendixes 3 and 4, respectively. \n \n\n1. \n\nObjectives \n\n53. \nThe  purpose  of  the  MSDP  policy  loan  is  to  create  a  legal,  regulatory,  and  supervisory \nenvironment  that  supports  the  development  of  a  strong,  commercially  viable  microfinance \nsector. This environment will allow for the establishment, operation, and growth of a diversified \nrange  of  institutions  offering  microfinance  services.  These  institutions  could  include  those  that \nare  (i)  unregistered  and  unregulated,  (ii)  accredited  and  nonprudentially  supervised,  and  (iii) \nformally licensed and prudentially supervised. \n \n\n\f12\n\n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n54. \nThe  policy  loan  has  four  components,  outlined  below  with  their  expected  outputs  and \nsummarized in a policy matrix (Appendix 4), which identifies monitoring mechanisms, identifies \nresponsible agencies, and lists an implementation time frame. \n \n\na. \n\nPolicy and Strategy \n\nA government policy and strategy for microfinance development will provide a framework \n55. \nto establish an enabling environment. Policy and strategy should be comprehensive and include \na sector agenda. The Government has submitted a policy letter to ADB as a condition for first \ntranche  release.  The  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with  other \nmultilateral  and  bilateral  aid  agencies  that  might  have  an  impact  on  the  program,  and  will \nprovide  ADB  with  an  opportunity  to  comment  on  any  resulting  policy  proposals.  The \nGovernment will consider ADB\u2019s  views before finalizing and implementing any such proposals. \n \n\nb. \n\nLegal Environment \n\n56. \nA number of laws will require revision to provide an appropriate framework to support the \nestablishment and development of microfinance institutions. Under ADB TA 3555 (footnote 1) a \nlegal  specialist  with  a  team  of  NBT  staff  reviewed  the  relevant  legislation  and  identified  a \nprogram  for  change.  Further  discussion  with  Government,  NBT,  NGOs,  and  other  funding \nagencies established the following requirements: \n \nClassification  of  Microfinance  Institutions.  A  classification  of  MFIs  should  be \n57. \ndeveloped  to  clarify  the  status  of  all  NGO  microcredit  programs  and  future  MFIs,  and  issues \nrelated to registration and licensing, plus applicable legal and regulatory requirements. The draft \nmicrofinance  law  prepared  by  the  USAID/IFC  team  distinguishes  a  range  of  institutions \nproviding  MF  services  and  establishes  the  legal  basis  for  (i)  microcredit  foundations,  and \nregistered  NGO  microcredit  programs  that  make  microloans  with  funding  agencies  funds; \n(ii) microlending  companies,  which  are  licensed  and  registered,  have  commercial  funding \nsources but do not take deposits, and make microloans; and (iii) microcredit deposit companies, \nwhich take deposits from the public and make microloans.  \n \n58. \nAdoption of a Microfinance Law. The draft law is being circulated for comment among \nstakeholders,  including  ADB,  and  is  expected  to  be  submitted  to  Parliament  for  approval  by \nJune 2003. The draft law does not consider cooperatives, so a separate law on cooperatives will \nlikely be necessary. \n \n59. \nHarmonizing of the Draft Microfinance Law with Relevant Laws. The final enactment \nof a microfinance law will require amendments to laws on the national bank of Tajikistan and on \nbanks  and  banking  activities  to  (i)  provide  for  the  taking  of  savings  deposits  for  MFIs  from \nborrowers, members, and the public; (ii) clarify the application of the provision on licensing; and \n(iii) harmonize the microfinance law with other legislation. MSDP consulting services will ensure \nthat the draft law is harmonized with relevant laws.  \n \n60. \nfor a fair tax regime appropriate to their objectives and activities.  \n \n61. \nNew  legislation  is  being  developed  and  existing  laws  reviewed  and  revised  through  a \nconsultative  process  involving  all  key  stakeholders,  including  relevant  government  agencies \n\nReview of the Tax Code. It will be reviewed and amended to include MFIs and provide \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 13\n\nsuch  as  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  Ministry  of  Justice  (MOJ),  NBT,  NGOs  engaged  in \nmicrofinance, and funding agencies. \n \n\nc. \n\nRegulation and Supervision \n\n62. \nNBT regulations 83 and 84, and draft resolution 19 provide for the registration, licensing, \nand  regulation  of  loan  societies  and  nonbank  financial  institution  generally.  These  regulations \nwill  be  superseded  by  those  to  be  drafted  pursuant  to  the  draft  law.  It  provides  a  suitable \ngeneral  framework  to  establish  MFIs,  lays  out  operational  parameters,  and  tasks  the  NBT  to \ndevelop regulations and supervise MFIs. A comprehensive set of prudential and nonprudential \nregulations,  readily  available  to  institutions  and  the  public,  will  be  prepared  for  all  institutions \nproviding  microfinance  services.  The  regulations  should \nfollowing:  entry \nrequirements,  ownership  restrictions,  minimum  capital  and  capital  adequacy  requirements, \nreserves  and  loan  loss  provisioning,  requirements  for  loan  security,  an  asset  classification \nscheme, \nliquidity  reserve  requirements,  management \nqualifications  and  similar  requirements,  limitations  on  types  of  financial  services  authorized, \ninternal supervision requirements, audit requirements, and external supervision.  \n \n63. \nNBT has limited resources as the sole regulatory agency. It must, however, develop the \ncapacity to supervise licensed and regulated MFIs. Such capacity will include effective off-site \nmonitoring  systems  that  fit  with  a  set  of  performance  indicators  and  provide  early  warning  of \npotential  problems,  and  systems  and  procedures,  accompanied  by  manuals,  for  on-site \nsupervision. The MSDP investment loan component will help build such capacity. \n \n\nlimitations  on  risk  concentration, \n\ninclude \n\nthe \n\nd. \n\nInstitutional Environment \n\n64. \nAn  effective  regulatory  and  supervisory  regime  should  be  developed  through  a \nconsultative process involving policymakers and practitioners. Institutions should be established \nto oversee the development of the microfinance sector, including a microfinance policy steering \ncommittee  (MPSC),  and  Government,  NBT  and  NGO  technical  working  group  (TWG).  For \ndetails of the composition and purpose of these two institutions, see paras. 95 and 99. \n \nIf the policy, legal, and regulatory environment is supportive of MFIs, then NGOs should \n65. \nrespond positively. Operating licenses are expected to be issued to at least two deposit-taking \nMFIs before the end of the program. \n \n\n3. \n\nAmount of Loan, Terms, and Sources of Funds \n\n66. \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  lend  the  Borrower  SDR2,934,000  ($4  million  equivalent)  from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The loan will have an amortization period of 24 years, including \na  grace  period  of  8 years,  with  an  interest  charge  of  1.0%  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5% \nthereafter.  The  Borrower  will  not  relend  the  proceeds  of  the  program  loan.  The  funds  will  be \ntransferred  from  ADB  to  the  Borrower  in  tranches.  The  policy  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to \nfinance the foreign exchange cost of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, \nexcluding listed ineligible items (Appendix 5). The counterpart funds will be used to finance the \nlocal  currency  costs  relating  to  the  implementation  of  certain  programs  and  other  activities \nconsistent with the program objectives. \n \n\n\f14\n\n \n\n \n\n4. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n67. \nSupported  by  the  MPSC,  NBT  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  cooperate  with  MOF, \nMOJ,  Office  of  the  President,  and  Ministry  of  State  Revenue  and  Duties  (MSRD)  on  the \nmeasures to be implemented. The MPSC will be chaired by a representative from NBT and will \ninclude  representatives  from  MOF,  MOJ,  MSRD,  and  Office  of  the  President.  The  MPSC  will \nmeet at least quarterly to (i) ensure that the policies and actions in connection with the program \nset out in the policy letter and policy matrix are carried out on schedule; (ii) provide interagency \ncoordination on important policy, legal, and regulatory issues related to the establishment and \noperation of MFIs; and (iii) facilitate the coordination and cooperation among the Government, \nNBT, NGOs, and funding agencies. NBT will have overall responsibility for (i) implementing the \nprogram, (ii) ensuring that reform measures are undertaken in line with the agreed-on timetable, \n(iii)  initiating  withdrawals  under  the  loan,  and  (iv)  allocating  and  monitoring  the  use  of \ncounterpart  funds.  A  project  management  unit  (PMU)  established  in  NBT  will  support  ADB\u2019s \ninvestment component and submit quarterly progress reports to ADB.  \n \n\na. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement  \n\n68. \nPolicy  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  foreign  exchange  cost  of  items  produced \nand  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  listed  ineligible  items  (Appendix  5) \nDisbursement  will  be  in  accordance  with  the  simplified  disbursement  procedures  and  related \nrequirements for program loans. The Borrower will certify that (i) if loan proceeds finance goods \nalready imported, the value of eligible imports in the period concerned will exceed the amount of \nthe requested withdrawal; or (ii) if the loan proceeds finance items to be imported, the value of \neligible imports in the immediately preceding one-year period will be equal to or greater than the \namount of the requested withdrawal plus all other amounts expected to be withdrawn during the \nsucceeding one-year period. ADB will retain the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to \nverify  the  accuracy  of  the  Borrower\u2019s  certificate.  Before  withdrawal,  the  Borrower  will  open  a \ndeposit account with a bank to be agreed on with ADB in which all funds will be deposited. The \naccount will be managed in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB. \n \n\nb. \n\nMonitoring and Tranching   \n\n69. \nThe policy loan will be released in two tranches. The first, $1.5 million equivalent, will be \nreleased upon loan effectiveness, before which the Government must initiate certain institutional \nand policy actions to demonstrate its commitment to reform: (i) release the policy statement on \nmicrofinance,  (ii)  issue  a  presidential  decree  establishing  the  MPSC,  and  (iii)  issue  a \npresidential decree establishing the TWG. \n \n70. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  NBT  (i)  monitors  the  implementation  of  the  program \nand its impacts, and (ii) submits to ADB  quarterly reports on the implementation of the policy \nmatrix, including accomplishment of the measures set forth in the policy letter and policy matrix. \nThe  Borrower  and  ADB  will  review  the  implementation  of  the  Program  every  six  months,  and \nassess  the  impact  of  all  relevant  reforms  in  the  financial  and  social  security  sectors,  labor \nmarkets, and the economy in general.  \n \n71. \nADB will undertake an interim review of MSDP before the release of the second tranche. \nIt will be $2.5 million equivalent and is expected to be released within 24 months of the effective \ndate, provided that (i) the Government will have enacted the draft law; (ii) in close consultation \nwith  ADB,  MPSC,  and  TWG,  the  Government  will  have  reviewed  and  amended  the  tax \nlegislation to establish a taxation environment supportive of the establishment and development \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 15\n\nof  MFIs;  (ii)  the  Government  will  have  caused  NBT  to  develop  and  adopt  prudential  and \nnonprudential  regulations  to  supervise  diversified  categories  of  MFIs;  and  (iv)  NBT  will  have \nissued operating licenses to at least two deposit-taking MFIs.  \n \nADB will also consider the provision of an incentive tranche of $1 million equivalent to be \n72. \nreleased  up  to  six  months  before  the  second  tranche  if  the  draft  law  has  been  ratified  by \nParliament, and regulations for MFIs approved by NBT. \n \nD. \n\nInvestment Loan \n\n1. \n\nObjectives \n\nThe purpose of the MSDP investment loan is to expand the outreach and sustainability \n73. \nof  MFIs  serving  MSEs  and  poor  households  by  transforming  unregulated  credit  programs  to \nlicensed, regulated financial institutions. By the end of the project it is expected that (i) at least \ntwo deposit-taking MFIs will be operating in full compliance with all regulatory requirements; (ii) \nMFI  outreach  will  have  increased  by  100%,  with  about  75%  of  clients  being  initially  poor,  and \n50% being women; (iii) MFI savings deposits will reach about 10% of loans outstanding; (iv) MFI \nloans  outstanding  will  reach  about  TJS9  million  ($3.5  million);  and  (v)  MFI  loan  losses  will  be \nless than 4%. \n \n\n2. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n74. \nThe  project  scope  has  four  components:  (i)  regulatory  framework,  (ii)  establishment  of \nMFIs,  (iii)  institutional  strengthening,  and  (iv)  project  management.  The  project  scope  is \nnationwide,  with  geographical  focus  on  locations  where  selected  NGOs  willing  to  transform  to \nMFIs have existing microfinance programs. \n \n\na. \n\nRegulatory Framework \n\n75. \nA legal and regulatory environment favorable to MFI operations is a prerequisite to the \nformation of legally registered and licensed MFIs. By agreement, USAID and IFC are providing \nTA to prepare the draft law. Through this component, ADB will focus on developing regulations \nand  increasing  community  awareness  of  all  laws  and  regulations,  and  MFI  activities. \nRegulations  will  be  prepared  through  a  consultative  process  with  key  stakeholders,  largely \nconducted  through  the  TWG,  comprising  Government,  NBT  and  NGO  representatives  (para. \n99).  \n\nb. \n\nEstablishment of Microfinance Institution \n\n76. \nIn  parallel  with  the  development  of  a  favorable  legal  and  regulatory  environment,  the \nproject will focus on the transformation of selected NGO microcredit programs into licensed and \nregulated MFIs. The project will work with existing NGO credit programs that have (i) registered \nas a local NGO, (ii) at least three years experience in Tajikistan providing credit, (iii) at least one \nyear\u2019s experience in delivering cash credit to groups and/or individuals, (iv) loan losses of less \nthan 4%, and (v) a willingness and capacity to meet the licensing and regulation requirements to \nbe  defined  by  NBT  regulations.  These  and  other  criteria  for  selecting  NGO  programs  will  be \nsubject to government and ADB approval. Graduation programs for selected NGO programs will \nbe developed. \n \n77. \nThe  project  will  work  with  selected  NGOs  to  establish  institutional  forms.  NGOs  will \nbecome  either  shareholder-owned  institutions  or  member-owned  institutions  such  as  savings \n\n\f16\n\n \n\n \n\nand credit unions. With advice and assistance from the project, NGOs will decide on the type of \ninstitutional  form  to  adopt.  The  project  will  help  NGOs  prepare  business  plans,  strategies, \nsystems  and  procedures,  and  operating  standards  to  transform  and  operate  an  MFI.  During \ntransformation,  NGOs  will  provide  regularly  updated  reports  on  their  operations,  performance, \nand status of transformation. Financial and management reporting and internal controls will be \nconsistent with Consultative Group on Assisting the Poorest (CGAP) guidelines. \n \n78. \nOnce  the  MFI  is  licensed  it  will  be  eligible  for  a  credit  line  initially  for  one  year  and \nsubsequently for up to 10 years, depending on performance, subject to credit-line participation \ncriteria  specified  below.  MFIs  will  also  have  to  develop  diversified  savings  and  loan  products \nand  other  services.  As  the  project  will  focus  on  savings,  it  will  emphasize  development  of  at \nleast two savings products such as passbook accounts and term deposits for all MFIs.  \n \n79. \nThe  project  will  also  explore  promoting  and  establishing  microfinance  services  in  rural \nareas through commercial banks. The possibility of a partner arrangement between MFIs and a \ncommercial bank will be considered. \n \n80. \nEstablished  MFIs  will  be  in  the  early  stage  of  developing  credit  and  savings  services. \nMFIs will have little credibility with commercial banks and may have difficulty obtaining financing \nthrough  them.  Since  deposit  mobilization  must  be  backed  by  adequate  liquidity  or  access  to \nliquidity,  appropriate  liquidity  mechanisms  are  required.  To  provide  sufficient  liquidity  under \nnormal  operations,  MFIs  will  be  expected  to  hold  a  portion  of  their  assets  in  near-liquid  form, \nprobably  on  term  deposit  with  a  reputable  bank.  So  that  sufficient  funds  are  available  for \nunexpected customer withdrawals, a pilot liquidity guarantee fund (LGF) should be established \nto  provide  short-term  funds  to  MFIs  on  terms  similar  to  the  refinance  facility  provided  through \nNBT  for  commercial  banks.  An  LGF  of  $100,000  equivalent  will  be  financed  in  equal  parts  by \nthe Government/NBT and ADB.  \n \nTo be eligible to draw down against LGF, MFIs must comply with NBT regulations and \n81. \nmaintain standard levels of liquidity before the need for funds. Based on the amount of savings \nand paid-up capital, the amount an MFI can draw on will be limited, with a draw-down up to 90 \ndays. LGF should be able to make funds available within 24 hours. LGF operational procedures \nwill  be  prepared  and  agreed  on  by  the  Government/NBT,  ADB,  and  NGOs/MFIs.  Further \ndevelopment or dissolution will be agreed on at project completion. \n \n\nc. \n\nInstitutional Strengthening \n\n82.  While NGOs have been operating credit programs in Tajikistan since 1995, Government \nand NGOs have limited experience in supervising and operating MFIs. Before, during, and after \nNGO programs become MFIs, relevant training must be provided to NBT and NGOs/MFIs.  \n\n83.  While  NBT  has  experience  in  supervising  banks,  it  does  not  have  the  capacity  and \nexpertise  to  supervise  MFIs.  Their  supervision  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  Supervision \nDepartment  for  banks.  To  strengthen  NBT,  the  project  will  support  the  establishment  of \nsupervision  capacity  by  hiring  two  more  staff;  providing  training  in  accounting,  legal,  and \nregulatory  issues,  and  on-site  supervision  of  MFIs;  and  providing  a  study  course  abroad  in \nmicrofinance  and  supervision.  Supervision  methods  will  be  reviewed  and  modified  for  MFIs. \nNew procedures will be introduced and operating manuals prepared. NBT will then be expected \nto effectively monitor MFIs off site and supervise them on site. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 17\n\nThe transformation of NGO programs into MFIs will require substantial training to ensure \n84. \nthat  staff  have  the  capability  to  manage  and  operate  a  licensed  and  fully  regulated  financial \ninstitution. Head office staff, branch managers, and field supervisors will have to be trained in a \nrange of areas. At the field level, training will be on the job and supported by operation manuals. \nNGOs  have  their  own  approaches  to  training  but  all  training  must  provide  staff  with  the  skills \nrequired.  The  project  will  support  the  preparation  of  operating  procedures  and  manuals,  and \nassess approaches for a system of incentive payments for good staff performance. \n\nTraining  courses  will  be  organized  following  an  annual  consultation  by  the  training \n85. \nspecialist  to  determine  the  progressive  needs  of  MFIs.  The  courses  will  include  asset/liability \nmanagement  and  risk  identification  and  mitigation;  product  development  and  pricing;  staff \nmanagement,  performance  measurement,  and  provision  of \nloan  portfolio \nmanagement; and governance and internal controls. Each course will last 6\u201312 days, have 15\u2013\n20 participants, and will cover 120 trainees. MFIs will meet the travel and per diem costs of the \nparticipants.  The  courses  will  be  conducted  by  project  staff  or  other  experienced microfinance \npractitioners. Two workshops a year will be held for all MFI field staff and their managers and \nsupervisors.  While  training  will  focus  on  MFIs  progressing  to  licensing  and  regulation  to  take \ndeposits, other MFIs will also be eligible to participate in domestic training programs. \n\nincentives; \n\nd. \n\nProject Management \n\nThe  project  will  provide  an  organizational  structure  and \n\n86. \ntechnical  expertise. \nImplementation  must  be  timely,  funds  must  be  disbursed  efficiently  and  properly,  and  all \nparticipating agencies must provide reports. A PMU will be established within NBT. The loan will \nfinance the installation of an accounting and management information system for the PMU and \nother  logistical  support,  including  provision  of  office  equipment,  supplies,  vehicles,  and \noperating costs. \n\n3. \n\nCosts and Financing \n\nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $5.31  million  equivalent,  including  physical  and \n87. \nprice  contingencies, \ntaxes  and  duties,  and  expected \nimplementation, \ncontributions  of  NGOs/MFIs  and  clients.  Of  the  total  cost,  about  $1.82  million  or  34%  is  in \nforeign  exchange  costs,  and  $3.49  million  equivalent  or  66%  in  local  currency  costs.

The  loan  will  have  an \namortization period of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge at \nthe rate of 1.0% during the grace period and 1.5 % thereafter.  \n\n90. \nADB will finance vehicles, equipment, consultants, and overseas and domestic training \nfor NBT; vehicles, equipment and furniture, consultants, and operational costs for the PMU; and \nthe interest charge during implementation ($1.4 million). ADB funds will be channeled through a \ncredit line ($2.6 million), and establish a liquidity guarantee fund (50% of the cost paid by ADB) \nfor MFIs. All loan funds under MSDP\u2019s investment component will be channeled through the EA. \n\nThe Government will fund $390,000 equivalent, 7.3% of total project cost, from budget \n91. \nresources and in taxes and duties, and thus finance recurrent costs of NBT supervision of MFIs, \nliquidity guarantee fund (50%), and taxes and duties of $105,922. \n\n\f \n\n 19\n\n \n\n93. \nrisk.  \n\nNGOs/MFIs  will  fund  $700,000  equivalent,  13.2%  of  total  project  cost,  to  finance \n92. \nvehicles,  furniture,  and  equipment;  and  capital  for  MFI  startup.  MFI  clients  will  fund  $220,000 \nequivalent,  4.2%  of  total  project  cost,  comprising  savings  deposits  for  lending,  and  capital  for \nMFIs.  \n\nThe  Borrower  will  be  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan,  which  will  bear  the  foreign  exchange \n\n4. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\na. \n\nOrganization and Management Arrangements \n\n94. \n\nThe project management arrangements comprise the MPSC, PMU, and TWG.  \n\n95. \nThe  MPSC  will  comprise  representatives  of  NBT  (chair),  Office  of  the  President,  MOF, \nMOJ,  MSRD,  project  director  (NBT),  NGOs  (two  representatives),  and  other  agencies  as \nrequired.  The  project  manager  will  act  as  secretary.  ADB  and  other  funding  agencies  will \nparticipate  as  observers.  The  MPSC  will  (i)  provide  intergovernmental  agency  coordination  on \nimportant  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory  issues  related  to  the  establishment  and  operation  of \nMFIs; and (ii) facilitate the coordination and cooperation between the Government, NBT, NGOs, \nand funding agencies. The two NGO representatives will be selected by the NGO community. \nThe  MPSC  will  meet  quarterly  during  the  first  12  months  of  the  project  and  semiannually \nthereafter,  unless  circumstances  require  more  frequent  meetings.  The  establishment  of  the \nMPSC will be a condition for loan effectiveness.  \n\n96. \nThe  executing  agency  will  be  NBT.  It  will  (i)  coordinate  the  project;  (ii)  maintain \nappropriate  accounts,  including  records  on  withdrawal  applications  and  disbursements; \n(iii) ensure  that  procurement  is  managed  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines;  (v)  prepare  and \nsubmit  quarterly  progress  and  other  reports  in  formats  and  content  agreed  on  with  ADB; \n(vi) ensure  timely  submission  of  audited  accounts  of  the  project  to  ADB;  and  (vi)  serve  as  the \nfocal  point  for  ADB\u2019s  project  review  and  administration  activities  and  between  ADB  and \nNGOs/MFIs. \n\n97. \nNBT  will  appoint  a  project  director.  This  position  is  a  half-time  unfunded  position, \nnominated  by  NBT  and  approved  by  the  MPSC.  The  project  director  will  be  responsible  for \ncoordinating  project  implementation,  and  will  countersign  with  the  project  manager  withdrawal \napplications and disbursement documents. The project director will be appointed as a condition \nof loan negotiations. \n\n98. \nThe  PMU  will  host  the  project  manager,  domestic  and  international  consultants,  and \nother office support staff (secretary/office administrator, interpreters, and drivers). The PMU will \nserve  the  needs  of  other  funding  agency  projects  (specifically  the  World  Bank's  small  and \nmedium-sized enterprise credit line) and provide support to MSDP. The project manager will be \na  full-time  domestic  consultant,  who  will  (i)  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  implementation \nactivities,  (ii)  supervise  consultants,  and  (iii)  be  responsible  and  report  to  the  project  director. \nThe  PMU  will  (i)  ensure  that  the  project  is  implemented  in  accordance  with  the  design; \n(ii) ensure  effective  coordination  of  all  activities  and  the  state  and  local  agencies  and  NGOs \ninvolved; \nrecords  on  withdrawal  applications  and \ndisbursements;  (iv)  manage  procurement  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines;  (v)  prepare \nquarterly progress and other reports in formats agreed on with ADB; and (vi) provide support to \nthe  MPSC  and  TWG.  The  Government  and  NBT  will  ensure  that  adequate  office  space  with \n\n(iii)  maintain  accounts, \n\nincluding \n\n\f20\n\n \n\n \n\nappropriate  furniture  and  access  to  communication  facilities  is  provided  for  the  project  team \nthrough the PMU.  \n\n99. \nTWG  which  includes  the  Government,  NBT,  NGO  and  MFI  will  be  composed  of  the \nproject  director  (chair);  legal,  regulatory  and  supervision,  and  foreign  investment  staff  of  NBT; \nMOF, MOJ, and the Office of the President; NGOs/MFIs (two representatives); project manager \n(secretary);  and  consultants  as  required.  For  each  agency  and  department  of  NBT,  one \nrepresentative will be nominated, including an alternate. The NGO and/or MFI representatives \nwill  be  selected  by  the  NGO  and/or  MFI  community  in  addition  to  MPSC  representatives.  The \nTWG will (i) promote a legal and regulatory environment conducive to the development of MFIs; \n(ii) facilitate  cooperation  among  the  Government,  NBT,  and  NGOs  in  developing  MFIs  and \nrelated  laws  and  regulations;  (iii)  address  issues  concerning  the  licensing  and  operations  of \nMFIs  and  reach  agreement  on  appropriate  actions;  and  (iv)  submit  assessments  and \nrecommendations  on  MFI  policy,  legal,  regulatory,  and  operational  issues  to  the  MPSC.  The \nTWG  will  function  for  the  period  of  the  project,  meeting  at  least  once  a  month  during  the  first \nyear  and  as  required  thereafter.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  (i)  the  two  NGO \nrepresentatives  in  the  TWG  are  selected  and  appointed  by  the  NGO  community,  and  (ii)  NBT \nappoints an alternate staff for each NBT staff in the TWG. The Government will also ensure that \nthe  TWG  is  maintained,  with  composition  and  terms  of  reference  satisfactory  to  ADB, \nthroughout the project implementation period unless otherwise agreed on between the Borrower \nand ADB. \n\nb. \n\nRelending and On-lending Terms and Conditions \n\n100.  The Borrower will be the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan. It will bear (i) the full \nforeign exchange risk of the total amount of the loans, and (ii) responsibility to repay the ADB \nloans.  ADB  will  lend  SDR2,934,000  of  the  investment  loan  component  to  the  Borrower.  The \nBorrower through a subsidiary loan agreement acceptable to ADB will relend funds in somoni at \n0%  interest  rate  to  NBT.  These  loan  funds  will  be  used  by  NBT  for  (i)  institutional  capacity \nbuilding of NBT, which will be entirely responsible for repayments to the Borrower; and (ii) on-\nlending  to   participating  commercial  banks  (PCBs),  which  will  assume  the  credit  risk.  NBT  will \non-lend  the  proceeds  of  the  credit  line  in  somoni  to  PCBs  at  a  rate  not  less  than  NBT's \npublished  discount  or  refinancing  rate,  which  will  be  positive  in  real  terms  and  acceptable  to \nADB. PCBs will further on-lend credit-line proceeds to MFIs and subborrowers at market-based \ninterest rates that take into account PCB\u2019s cost of funds and administrative expenses, adding a \nreasonable risk premium to cover potential losses. PCBs will enter into credit agreements with \nMFIs or subborrowers. MFIs will be PCBs\u2019 subborrowers. MFIs will on-lend to MSEs at market-\nbased  interest  rates  that  take  into  account  MFI\u2019s  cost  of  funds  and  administrative  expenses, \nplus a reasonable risk premium to cover potential losses.18 MFIs will bear the credit risk for their \non-lending. Implementation arrangements related to the credit line will be reviewed jointly by the \nGovernment,  ADB,  PCBs,  and  MFIs  at  least  once  every  six  months,  and  the  arrangements \nadjusted accordingly. Appendix 7 presents a diagram of the investment loan fund flow.  \n \n101. \nInitially, a PCB may borrow up to $500,000 equivalent for one year. If loan repayment is \nsatisfactory,  and  the  PCB  continues  to  meet  qualification  criteria  governing  commercial  bank \nparticipation in MSDP, the PCB may borrow up to $1 million equivalent for 10 years. PCBs may \nuse funds borrowed from NBT solely for on-lending to MFIs and subborrowers, and PCBs must \ndemonstrate  to  the  satisfaction  of  NBT  and  ADB  that  credit-line  proceeds  are  fully  on-lent  to \n\n                                                 \n18  NGOs  lend  in  somoni  with  repayments  indexed  to  the  dollar,  thus  transferring  the  foreign  exchange  risk  to  the \n\nborrower. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 21\n\neligible MFIs within 3 working days. If a PCB is found not to have complied with the qualification \ncriteria, the PMU and NBT, with the prior approval of ADB, will determine whether the PCB will \n(i) prepare and implement a plan of action to comply, or (ii) be excluded from the project credit \nline. Any PCB not complying for more than one quarter will be excluded from the project. The \nexcluded  PCB  will  pay  back  to  the  project  all  funds  made  available  through  the  project.  The \nPCB may not accelerate or otherwise require the MFIs to repay the corresponding subloans but \nmust  use  other  sources  of  funds  to  repay  NBT,  so  long  as  the  MFIs  have  complied  with  the \nrelevant MSDP participation criteria. Appendix 12 presents the PCB participation criteria. NBT, \nthrough  the  PMU,  will  monitor  PCB  financial  performance  and  ongoing  compliance  with  the \nparticipation criteria. \n \n102. \nInitially, an MFI may borrow up to $250,000 equivalent for one year. If loan repayment is \nsatisfactory on the initial loan and the MFI continues to meet the eligibility requirements, it may \nborrow up to $500,000 for ten years. MFIs may use funds borrowed from PBCs under the credit \nline  solely  for  on-lending  to  MSEs  or  individuals,  or  for  the  purchase  of  fixed  assets,  with  the \nMFI subject to the following borrowing limits: (i) at no time  will the MFI's ratio of total loans to \nassets be less than 70%; (ii) at no time will the ratio of the MFI's credit-line borrowings to total \nloans  be  greater  than  50%;  (iii)  at  no  time  will  the  ratio  of  the  MFI\u2019s  fixed  to  total  assets  be \ngreater than 10%. If an MFI is found not to have complied with the eligibility criteria or any of the \nthree  borrowing  limits,  the  PCB,  in  consultation  with  the  PMU  and  NBT,  and  with  the  prior \napproval  of  ADB,  will  determine  whether  the  MFI  concerned  will  (i)  prepare  and  implement  a \nplan  of  action  to  comply,  or  (ii)  be  excluded  from  the  project  credit  line.  Any  MFI  that  has  not \ncomplied  for  more  than  one  quarter  will  be  excluded  from  the  project  and  pay  back  all  funds \nreceived through the project. The PCB must repay the same amount to NBT under the PCB\u2019s \ncorresponding loan within 3 working days. In addition to the PCBs, NBT, through the PMU, will \nmonitor MFI financial performance, and compliance with eligibility criteria.  \n \n103.  PCBs and MFIs will maintain accounting systems and records in accordance with local \naccounting standards acceptable to ADB for financial institutions, and will be subject to review \nby ADB missions. PCB and MFI financial and accounting operations are subject to annual audit \nby external auditors acceptable to ADB.  \n \n104.  As the legal and regulatory enabling environment is being constructed, and while NGOs \nare  transformed  through  this  evolving  environment,  the  system  of  fund  disbursement  via  the \ncredit  line  will  be  examined  and  streamlined.  Disbursements  of  the  credit  line  will  begin  only \nafter  18\u201324  months,  during  which  time  MSDP  project  staff  and  consultants  will  analyze \ncandidate PCBs, using the participation criteria in Appendix 12. \n \n105.  A key objective of MSDP is to help experienced NGO credit programs become licensed \nMFIs, subject to NBT regulation and supervision. Only after a license has been issued and the \nNGO program legally transformed into an MFI will it be eligible to access the credit line. \n \n\nc. \n\nEligibility Criteria for Participating Commercial Banks \n\n106.  MSDP  will  qualify  commercial  banks  to  access  the  credit  line  for  on-lending  to  MFIs. \nMSDP  project  staff  and  consultants  will  determine  financial and  operating  soundness  of  PCBs, \nas  well  as  judge  their  capacity  to  analyze  the  credit  risk  of  MFIs.  To  participate  in  the  MSDP \ncredit-line component, a PCB must at least be (i) legally licensed; (ii) in compliance with all NBT \nprudential requirements; (iii) rated satisfactory according to NBT on-site examination reports for \nthe  most  recent  two  calendar  years;  (iv)  profitable  for  the  past  two  calendar  years  as \ndemonstrated  by  externally  audited  financial  statements  prepared  in  IAS  format;  (v)  properly \n\n\f22\n\n \n\n \n\ncapitalized,  with  capital  relative  to  risk-weighted  assets  of  not  less  than  15%;  (vi)  profitable,  as \nmeasured by return on average assets for the past two calendar years of at least 2%; (vii) in full \ncompliance with recommended loan classification and loan provisioning requirements; (viii) able \nto demonstrate capacity to analyze credit risk of MFIs; and (ix) be in compliance with additional \ncriteria  as  recommended  by  the  PMU,  NBT,  MPSC,  and  TWG,  and  approved  by  ADB.  Should \nthe PCB also meet criteria (iii) and (iv) set out for MFI accreditation in para. 107, the PCB may be \nallowed  to  borrow  funds  for  on-lending  directly  to  MSEs  and  individuals  or  for  fixed-asset \npurchases, subject to (i) approval by NBT and ADB, and (ii) compliance with the three financial \nratio limits defined in para. 108. See Appendix 12 for further discussion of criteria for participation \nin  MSDP  by  commercial  banks,  including  recommended  loan  classification  and  provisioning \nrequirements, as well as a complete list of NBT prudential requirements.  \n \n\nd. \n\nEligibility Criteria for Microfinance Institutions \n\n107.  MSDP  will  qualify  MFIs  to  participate  in  the  credit  line.  MSDP  project  staff  and \nconsultants  will  determine  financial  and  operating  soundness,  as  well  as  judge  the  capacity  of \nMFIs  to  manage  the  credit  risk  of  on-lending  to  MSEs  and  individuals.  At  a  minimum,  to  be \neligible for participation to the project, an MFI must (i) be legally licensed; (ii) comply with all NBT \nprudential requirements for MFIs; (iii) have a ratio of average loan size to GDP per capita of not \nmore than 200%; (iv) have at least 50% women borrowing clients; (v) have achieved operational \nself-sufficiency;  (vi)  have  capital  relative  to  risk-weighted  assets  of  15%;  (vii)  be  fully  in \ncompliance  with  recommended  loan  classification  and  loan  provisioning  requirements;  (vi) \npossess  demonstrable  capacity  to  analyze  and  manage  credit  risk  of  MSEs  and  individual \nborrowers;  and  (vii)  comply  with  additional  criteria  recommended  by  PMU,  NBT,  MPSC,  and \nTWG, and approved by ADB. See Appendix 13 for a discussion of MSDP participation criteria for \nMFIs. Once the MFI has been determined to be eligible, it may approach, or may be approached \nby,  a  PCB.  Before  on-lending  by  a  PCB  to  an  MFI,  the  PCB  will  analyze  the  MFI.  If  the  PCB \ndecides to lend to the MFI, the PCB will assume the full credit risk of lending to the MFI. PCBs \nwill  enter  into  credit  agreements  with  MFIs,  which  will  be  reviewed  in  advance  by,  and  be \nacceptable in form and substance to, NBT and ADB. The credit agreement will require the PCB \nto incorporate at a minimum MSDP participation criteria for MFIs. \n \n\ne. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n108.  The project will be implemented over 4 years from the time the loan agreement becomes \neffective, and the loan will be completely drawn down within 5 years. Project implementation will \ncommence  in  2003.  The  pilot  nature  of  MFI  transformation,  the  continuing  reforms  in  the \nfinancial sector, and the relative inexperience in transforming NGO programs into MFIs require \na flexible approach. However, more flexibility will require the Government and ADB to focus on \nproject monitoring and supervision.  \n\nf. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n109.  A  total  of  86  person-months  of  consulting  services,  comprising  14  person-months  of \ninternational and 72 person-months of domestic expertise will be recruited under the investment \nloan.  Expertise  and  length  of  service  for  domestic  consultants  include    a  project  manager  (48 \nperson-months), computer systems specialist (8 person-months), training specialist (10 person-\nmonths),  and  accountant  (6  person-months).  International  consultants  will  be  a  microfinance \nsector  specialist/team  leader  (7  person-months),  regulatory  and  supervision  specialist  (5 \nperson-months),  and  accounting  and  management  information  systems  specialist  (2  person-\nmonths). All consultants will report to the project manager.  Terms of reference for consultants \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 23\n\nare  in  Appendix  8.  An  international  firm  of  consultants,  in  association  with  suitable  domestic \nconsultants, will be recruited in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of  Consultant\u2019s by \nADB  and  its  Borrowers,  and  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for  selection  of  domestic \nconsultants, using the quality and cost-based selection method. A full technical proposal will be \nused to select the consulting firm. \n\n110.  Consulting  services  will  primarily  help  the  Government  carry  out  the  policy  agenda \noutlined  in  the  policy  matrix  (Appendix  4).  These  resources  will  be  focused  on  developing  a \nfavorable legal and regulatory environment for microfinance, while the attached TA focuses on \ncapacity  building  within  NBT  and  MFIs.  Consulting  services  will  also  provide  administrative \ncapacity to ensure that the project is managed properly.  \n\ng. \n\nProcurement \n\ninclude  vehicles; \n\n111.  Procurement  will \n(computers,  printer, \nphotocopiers); and training.  ADB-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement,  with  equipment  to  be  procured  through  international \ncompetitive  bidding  for  contracts  exceeding  $500,000  equivalent;  and  through  international \nshopping  for  contracts  from  $50,000  to  $500,000.  For  packages  below  $50,000  equivalent, \ndirect purchase, with prior agreement of ADB, may be used.  \n\nfurniture;  equipment \n\nh. \n\nDisbursement \n\n112.  The Borrower will establish an imprest account in NBT to facilitate the timely release of \nloan  funds  and  pay  for  all  project  expenditures,  including  credit-line  operations.  The  imprest \naccount  will  be  established  immediately  after  loan  effectiveness.  The  initial  amount  to  be \ndeposited into the imprest account will not exceed $250,000 equivalent. The project director will \noperate  the  imprest  account  in  accordance  with  the  procedures  established  by  NBT  and  the \nGovernment.  All  withdrawal  applications  will  be  signed  by  the  project  director  and  project \nmanager.  The  EA  will  maintain  an  accounting  system  and  accounting  records  in  accordance \nwith  local  accounting  standards  acceptable  to  ADB  (and  subject  to  regular  reviews  by  ADB \nmissions). ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure (SOE) procedure will be used to reimburse eligible \nexpenditures  and  to  liquidate  advances  provided  to  the  imprest  account.  Individual  payments \nthat  may  be  reimbursed  or  liquidated  under  the  SOE  procedure  will  not  exceed  $25,000 \nequivalent, and the imprest account and SOE procedure will be established and maintained in \naccordance  with  the  Loan  Disbursement  HandBook  and  detailed  arrangements  between  the \nGovernment  and  ADB.  To  liquidate  and  replenish  the  imprest  account,  the  EA  is  required  to \nsubmit  to  ADB  (i)  a  list  of  approved  loan  applications  and  their  amounts,  and  (ii)  the  amount \nreleased to PCBs and/or MFIs. \n\ni. \n\nAccounts, Audit, and Report \n\n113.  The  Government  will  cause  NBT  to  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  project.  The \nGovernment  will  have  such  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  audited  annually  by \nauditors  acceptable  to  ADB  and  in  accordance  with  provisions  of  the  loan  agreement  and \nGuidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by \nADB. The imprest account and SOE records will also be audited as part of the annual audit. The \nGovernment  will  submit  to  ADB  certified  copies  in  English  of  such  audited  accounts  and \nfinancial  statements  and  the  reports  of  the  auditors,  within  six  months  after  the  close  of  each \nfinancial  year.  In  compliance  with  the  requirement  for  annual  audited  financial  statements, \n\n\f24\n\n \n\n \n\nproceeds  of  this  loan  may  be  used  to  finance  expenditure  for  private  sector  auditors  and \ntranslations of auditors\u2019 reports into English. \n\n114.  NBT  will  submit  consolidated  quarterly  progress  reports  to  ADB,  in  English,  on  all \naspects  of  project  implementation.  The  reports  will  include  details  on  overall  progress  in \nimplementation and problems/issues encountered during the reference period, measures taken \nor  proposed  to  be  taken  to  remedy  these  problems,  and  the  proposed  program  of  activities \nduring  the  following  quarter.  Within  three  months  after  the  closing  date  of  the  loan,  NBT  will \nprepare and submit to ADB, in a format acceptable to ADB, a project completion report on the \nutilization  and  impact  of  the  project,  performance  of  the  project,  economic  and  social  benefits \ngenerated, and impact on the financial sector and rural economy.  \n\nj. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring System \n\n115.  This is an ambitious project with broad goals and objectives related to poverty reduction, \ngender,  and  financial  sector  development.  The  project  monitoring  system  will  gather  the \nfollowing types of information: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nPoverty.  Under  the  attached  TA,  a  social  economist  is  tasked  to  develop \nindicators  for  tracking  the  socioeconomic  status  of  MFI  customers  over  the \nproject  life.  The  TA  will  develop  survey  techniques  to  be  applied  periodically  to \nassess the impact of project activities on poverty. The use of surveys and rapid \nassessment  techniques  supported  through  project  resources  is  considered  the \nmost  efficient  approach  as  it  does  not  impose  financial  burdens  for  qualitative \ndata  collection  on  the  financial  institutions  involved  in  the  project.  See \nSupplementary  Appendix  3  for  details  on  the  supporting  TA.  Key  measures  of \nMFI  outreach  related  to  average  loan  size  and  number  of  borrowers  are  also \nconsidered to be poverty related. These data will be captured systematically from \nMFIs. \n\nGender. The project mandates equal participation by women, first as borrowers, \nand  also  as  participants  in  project  activities,  notably  training.  Data  related  to \nwomen\u2019s participation in project activities will be closely monitored throughout the \nlife of the project. See Appendix 11 for specific gender targets. \n\nFinancial  Sector  Development.  A  detailed  set  of  financial  indicators  has  been \ndeveloped  for  PCBs  and  MFIs  to  provide  timely  information  on  their  financial \nperformance.  \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nIn  addition \n\nto  standard \n\nMFIs. \nfinancial \ninstitutions  will  provide  to  the  project  timely  information  related  to \noutreach,  profitability/self-sustainability,  portfolio  quality,  and  efficiency. \nAppendix  13  provides  a  detailed  list  of  monitoring  indicators  to  be \ngathered from MFIs.  \n\nfinancial  reporting, \n\nthese \n\nPCBs. Banks will also provide periodic financial information to the project \nrelated  to  their  financial  position.  Should  they  be  engaged  in  direct \nlending to MFIs, PCBs will be subject to MFI reporting requirements and \nto  outreach, \nprovide \nprofitability/self-sufficiency,  portfolio  quality,  and  efficiency.  Appendix  12 \ndetails the PCB financial indicators that will be monitored by the project.  \n\nthe  same  set  of  project \n\nindicators  related \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 25\n\n116.  An  integrated  system  of  data  collection  and  analysis  encompassing  all  necessary \ninformation will be designed and implemented to monitor the progress in achieving the project \nobjectives.  The  project  performance  monitoring  system  will  provide  the  Government  and  ADB \nwith  the  tools  to  monitor  project  inputs,  outputs,  and  objectives  as  provided  in  the  project \nframework; and to assess the project\u2019s technical, social, and economic effects. NBT will submit \nto ADB a quarterly monitoring report on progress towards achieving the project objectives. \n\nk. \n\nProject Reviews \n\n117.  Two  loan  reviews  will  be  conducted  in  the  first  year  of  implementation.  Semiannual \nreviews will continue until annual reviews are considered sufficient for effective administration. A \nmore  comprehensive  review  of  the  project  will  be  carried  out  by  the  Government,  NBT, \nNGOs/MFIs, and ADB after 18 months to assess project performance and the need for changes \nin design and implementation. \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nObjectives \n\n118.  The  goal  of  the  TA  is  to  build  strong,  commercially  viable  MFIs  capable  of  providing \nfinancial  services  to  MSEs  and  poor  households  while  developing  strong  regulatory  and \nsupervisory  institutions  to  support  MFIs.  The  purpose  is  to  (i)  strengthen  the  supervisory \ncapacity  of  NBT  to  oversee  MFIs,  and  (ii)  develop  the  capacity  of  MFIs  to  operate  as \ncommercially viable financial institutions.  \n\nB. \n\nScope \n\n119.  The  TA  will  (i)  formulate  MFI  financial  models  that  feasibly  fit  microfinance  needs  and \nNGO capabilities; (ii) work closely with each MFI and candidate MFI in planning, evaluation of \nactivities,  development  of  new  financial  products,  improvement  of  governance  and  internal \ncontrols, and development of staff benefit packages linked to staff performance; (iii) work closely \nwith  the  NBT  MFI  supervision  section  in  refining  off-site  monitoring  and  appraisal  of  MFIs; \n(iv) work with NBT staff in developing efficient and effective procedures for on-site inspections; \n(v) explore possible linkages between commercial banks and MFIs in the joint development of \nproducts, placing of deposits, credit lines, and equity investment; (vi) prepare a baseline survey \nof  MFI  customers  and  a  system  for  monitoring  benefits  received  by  households  during  the \nproject; and (vii) obtain market information from households concerning demand for a range of \nfinancial services.  \n\n120.  Training  and  study  tours  abroad  will  be  provided  to  improve  the  capacity  of  NBT  and \nsenior  MFI  staff.  Two  staff  from  the  NBT  MFI  supervision  section  will  undergo  a  three-week \nstudy tour of countries that have been successful in developing a MF sector. Eight managers of \nMFIs  will  be  helped  to  attend  formal  courses  in  MF  covering  (i)  governance  and  internal \ncontrols, (ii) product development and pricing, (iii) asset and liability management, including risk \nmanagement, and (iv) planning and appraisal of programs.  \n\n121.  NBT will provide office space and facilities for 28 person-months of consulting services \nover  three  years.  International  expertise  includes  an  MFI  specialist  (15  person-months)  and  a \nsocial  economist  (4  person-months).  A  domestic  product  development  specialist  (6  person-\nmonths)  will  also  be  recruited.  Three  months  of  consulting  service  are  unallocated  in  case  of \nunexpected requirements. The terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 8. \n\n\f26\n\n \n\n \n\nC. \n\nCosts and Financing \n\n122.  Total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $776,200,  including  foreign  exchange  costs  of \n$500,430  and  local  currency  costs  of  $275,770  equivalent.  The  Government  has  requested \nADB  to  provide  $640,000  equivalent  to  cover  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $139,570 \nequivalent of the local cost equivalent. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis. The \nGovernment  and  NGOs  will \nin-kind \ncontributions. Cost estimates are in Appendix 9. \n\nthe  balance  of  $136,200  equivalent,  as \n\nfinance \n\nD. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n123.  NBT  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA.  The  consultants  will  be  part  of  the  PMU \nwithin NBT. Individual consultants will be recruited by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants by ADB and its Borrowers. All TA consultants will report to the project \nmanager of the PMU. \n\n \n\nV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n124.  The  adoption  of  a  comprehensive  financial  systems  development  approach  combined \nwith  intensive  consultation  with  government  agencies,  NBT,  NGOs  and  funding  agencies  is \naimed at maximizing the benefits and impact and mitigating potentially significant risks.  \n \nA. \n\nFinancial Analysis of Microfinance Institutions \n\n125.  Of current NGO microcredit programs, only a few can be expected to become licensed \nand  regulated  deposit-taking  MFIs  under  MSDP.  To  assess  the  potential  for  successful \ntransformation, a detailed appraisal following the CGAP methodology for the appraisal of MFIs \nwas conducted on ACTED and NABWT. These NGOs were selected as they indicated a strong \ninterest in participating in the appraisal; both have recently divested nonfinancial operations to \nfocus  exclusively  on  microfinance,  and  are  restructuring  their  management  and  operations  to \nmove  to  MFI  licensing  and  regulation.  NABWT  is  the  largest  domestic  NGO  by  number  of \nborrowers  (5,906)  and  loan  portfolio  ($788,381).  ACTED,  while  it  has  a  smaller  loan  portfolio \n($120,633), is the third-largest NGO by number of clients (5,818). Detailed information on these \nNGOs\u2019 operations is contained in Supplementary Appendix 1.  \n \n126.  NABWT and ACTED have a strong financial base on which to transform themselves into \nlicensed and regulated MFIs. \n \nB. \n\nBenefits \n\n127.  The benefits derive from the individual policy and investment activities, and will include \nthe following: \n \n\nStable, Transparent Legal Foundation for Microfinance. An improved policy, \nlegal,  and  regulatory  environment  will  create  the  conditions  to  formalize \nunlicensed, unregulated financial activity.  \n\nIncreased  Financial  Diversity.  An  enabling  environment  and  substantial \ncapacity  building  may  result  in  the  transformation  of  existing  NGO  microcredit \nprograms into licensed and regulated MFIs, and the establishment of new MFIs.  \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n\f \n\n 27\n\nExpansion of Financial Service Delivery. Through the licensing of at least two \ndeposit-taking MFIs, the number of borrowers will increase from 15,000 to 38,000 \nin five years, and the combined loan portfolios to $4 million.  \n\nImproved  Access  to  Capital  by  MSEs.  Formalized  microcredit  provided \nthrough viable MFIs will benefit thousands of MSEs that rely mainly on their own \nsavings.  With  constant  access  to  loans  provided  by  commercially  viable  MFIs, \nMSEs can expand their businesses, benefiting owners and their families directly \nand the broader economy indirectly through increased economic activity.  \n\nSafe Haven for Savings. MSEs, the poor, and rural dwellers will benefit directly \nfrom  having  facilities  to  safeguard  savings.  Monetary  savings  allow  for  income \nsmoothing and accumulation of funds for investment. \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n\n(v) \n\n \nImpact \n\nC. \n\n128.  The  development  of  a  strong  microfinance  sector  will  help  promote  economic \ndevelopment and reduce poverty. Tajikistan\u2019s weak financial sector is not providing the impetus \nfor  broad-based  development.  MSDP  attempts  to  address  this  situation  by  focusing  on  the \ndevelopment of microfinance services. \n \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Impact \n\n129.  MSDP will increase the number and diversity of financial institutions operating within the \nformal  financial  sector,  which  will  not  necessarily  increase  competition  initially  as  MFIs  and \nbanks  have  different  market  segments  and  clientele.  However,  MFIs  will  require  safe  banking \ninstitutions  for  deposits,  and  MSDP  will  initiate  the  development  of  linkages  for  deposits  and \nloans between MFIs and commercial banks. With increased institutional diversity and linkages \nwith the commercial banking sector, an increased volume of deposits in the financial sector will \nhelp stimulate economic activity, increase domestic investment, deepen the financial sector, and \ncontribute to economic growth. \n \n130.  The  indirect  economic  impact  will  derive  from  the  increased  economic  activity  and \nemployment  expected  to  be  generated  from  the  availability  and  access  to  more  reliable  and \nsustainable  financial  services  from  a  varied  range  of  financial  institutions.  However,  finance \nalone will not necessarily generate these indirect economic impacts as other factors, including \ninvestment  laws  and  regulations,  business  capability,  etc.  will  affect  the  outcome  of \nentrepreneurial undertakings. \n \n\n2. \n\nImpact on Poverty \n\n131.  NGOs  provide  limited  financial  services,  consisting  of  small  loans  and  compulsory \nsavings, to their clients. They are generally from the poor and most vulnerable groups. Without \nthe  support  of  MSDP  these  programs  will  not  be  able  to  develop  as  sustainable  and  reliable \nfinancial institutions  and,  therefore,  will  be  limited  in  their  outreach.  Further  information  on  the \nimpact  on  poverty  of  the  policy  loan  and  the  investment  loan  are  in  Appendix  10  and \nSupplementary Appendix 3, respectively. \n \n132.  The  establishment  of  an  enabling  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory  environment  for \nmicrofinance  will  provide  a  more  conducive,  reliable,  and \nfor \nmicrofinance.  The  environment  and  framework  will  broaden  the  young  and  undeveloped \n\ntransparent \n\nframework \n\n\f28\n\n \n\n \n\nfinancial  system  to  provide  increased  access  to  all  segments  of  the  population,  contribute  to \nequity,  and  reduce  poverty.  The  framework  will  facilitate  the  establishment  of  new  institutions \nand  further  the  development  of  existing  NGO  programs  into  more  sustainable  financial \ninstitutions.  Overall  access  by  the  poor  to  financial  services  should  increase  significantly. \nHowever,  the  extent  of  the  increase  in  outreach  will  initially  depend  on  funding  available  to \nexpand activities. \n \n133.  The expansion of reliable and convenient access to financial services will also facilitate \nincreased  enterprise  activities  as  more  people  can  take  advantage  of  existing  and  new \nopportunities.  Many  households  save  in  nonfinancial  forms,  and  these  limit  risk  diversification \nand the contribution to resource allocation and economic growth. MSDP help mobilize financial \nsavings,  which  will  provide  household  security,  allow  self-financing  of  microenterprises,  allow \nthe poor to save for investment, and improve household financial management, smooth income \nflows and consumption patterns, and provide collateral for loans. \n \n134.  The transformation of at least two NGO microcredit programs into formally licensed and \nregulated financial institutions is expected to increase their outreach by about 100%. Based on \nthe client profile, 75% of new clients are expected to be poor. The establishment of reliable and \nsustainable  MFIs  is  aimed  not  only  to  enable  poor  clients  to  move  out  of  poverty,  but  equally \nalso to prevent those just above the poverty line from falling into deeper poverty.  \n \n135.  Women account for most clients of NGO programs. Of the clients of four NGO agencies \nmost  likely  to  become  MFIs,  over  60%  (30\u201385%)  are  women.  While  some  MFIs  such  as \nNABWT  focus  on  women,  others  such  as  AKF  do  not  specifically  target  them.  The  overall \nimpact of MSDP on women will depend on the NGOs included in the program and that become \nMFIs. These will ensure that women represent at least 50% of total clients. A gender analysis \nand plan is in Appendix 11. \n \nD. \n\nRisk and Safeguards \n\n136.  Several risks are associated with MSDP. They are discussed below along with ways of \nmitigating them:  \n \n\nUnstable  macroeconomic  environment  that  impacts  negatively  on  the \nsubsectors where MSEs operate. The Government's continued commitment to \nreform  has  been  demonstrated  in  the  PRGF  signed  with  IMF.  Continued \nengagement  with  IMF  and  World  Bank,  and  improving  economic  management \nare the key mitigating factors counterbalancing this risk. \n\nIneffective  implementation  of  the  draft  microfinance  law  and  regulations. \nConsulting  services  under  the  investment  loan  will  provide  expertise  and \nresources  to  NBT  to  implement  the  law  prudently,  and  create  an  effective \nregulatory and supervisory regime. USAID and IFC are also committed to seeing \nthe law implemented.  \n\nDelays or difficulties in harmonizing related laws and the Tax Code as they \nrelate  to  MFIs.  Consulting  resources  of  MSDP,  and  of  USAID  and  IFC,  which \nhave  signaled  their  commitment  to  harmonizing  the  draft  law  with  existing  laws \nand the Tax Code, will substantially mitigate this risk. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n\f \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 29\n\nDelays  or  problems  in  transforming  and/or  establishing  MFIs.  The  MPSC \nand TWG will continuously identify contentious issues and hold consultations on \nthem,  thereby  mitigating  this  risk.  Substantial  ADB  TA  for  MFI  transformation, \nplus  USAID  and  IFC  support  to  transform  individual  NGO  programs,  will  further \nreduce this risk.  \n\nOperational and financial risks of PCBs. PCB operational and financial risk will \nbe  mitigated  by  strict  criteria  and  performance  monitoring  developed  under  the \nproject, supported by consulting services.  \n\nOperational  and  financial  risks  of  MFIs.  The  attached  TA  will  mitigate  these \nthrough training and institutional capacity building. Operational risk can be further \nmitigated  by  MFI  borrowing  on  the  credit  line  to  finance  the  purchase  of \nappropriate information technology systems to improve accounting and financial \nreporting. \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents, \n\n137. \nthe Government has given the following assurances: \n\n(i) \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  policies  adopted  and  actions  taken  as \ndescribed  in  the  development  policy  letter  continue  in  effect  during  and  after \nMSDP. \n\n(ii)  Within  12  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  NBT  will  hire  at  least  two  qualified \n\nprofessional staff to supervise MFIs. \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nThe  MPSC  will  be  maintained,  with  composition  and  terms  of  reference \nsatisfactory to ADB, throughout implementation. \n\nThe  MPSC  will  meet  quarterly  during  the  first  12  months  of  the  project  and \nsemiannually thereafter, unless circumstances require more frequent meetings. \n\nThe  TWG  will  be  maintained,  with  composition  and  terms  of  reference \nsatisfactory to ADB, throughout project implementation unless all parties agree to \ndissolve it earlier. \n\nNBT will provide the PMU with adequate office space and support services in a \nform satisfactory to ADB throughout the project.  \n\nThe Government will ensure that the criteria developed to select NGO programs, \nPCBs, and MFIs as agreed on among the Government, ADB, PCBs, NGOs, and \nMFIs are strictly adhered to and applied objectively to ensure equal opportunity \nto participate in the project. \n\n(viii)  The  Government  will  ensure  reasonable  and  consistent  application  of  laws, \n\nregulations, and procedures for all MFIs. \n\n\f30\n\n \n\n \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  Government  will  provide  the  required  counterpart  funds  in  a  timely  manner \nfrom budget resources during the project.  \n\nFor external training conducted under the investment component, institutions will \nbe  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB, \ntaking into account considerations of economy and efficiency. \n\nB. \n\nConditions for Loan Negotiations \n\n138.  The following assurances will apply to the project: \n\nNBT will appoint a project director acceptable to ADB and submit the name and \nposition to ADB. \n\nAt  least  one  NGO  will  submit  to  the  Government  and  ADB  a  letter  of  intent \nexpressing  interest  in  participating  in  the  project  and  willingness  to  become  an \nMFI. \n\nThe  Government  will  submit  to  ADB  an  acceptable  signed  development  policy \nletter  evidencing  the  Government's  commitment  to  a  microfinance  sector \ndevelopment policy. \n\nThe  Borrower  will  have  established  the  PMU,  MPSC,  and  TWG  in  a  manner \nsatisfactory to ADB. \n\nA  subsidiary  loan  agreement  between  the  Borrower  and  NBT,  in  form  and \nsubstance acceptable to ADB, will be signed. \n\nThe program loan agreement and investment loan agreement will have become \neffective at the same time (cross-effectivity). \n\nC. \n\nCondition for Loan Effectiveness \n\nD. \n\nConditions for Disbursement (Investment Loan) \n\n139.  The conditions are the following:  \n\nThe Government develops project management performance criteria acceptable \nto ADB. \n\nBefore the first disbursement of funds under category 4 (credit line to MFIs), the \nfollowing  are  duly  executed  between  the  PCB  with  a  subloan  agreement  with \nNBT,  and  an  eligible  MFI  duly  licensed  by  NBT  and  qualified  to  borrow  funds \nunder  the  project:  (a) at  least  one  subloan  agreement,  in  form  and  substance \nsatisfactory  to  ADB,  duly  executed  between  NBT  and  an  eligible  PCB  and \ndelivered on behalf of NBT and such PCB; and (ii) at least one credit agreement, \nin form and substance satisfactory to ADB.  \n\n\f \n\n31\n\nConditions for Release of Second Tranche of Program Loan \n\nE. \n \n140.

However,  a \nsmall-scale technical assistance (SSTA) project1 also provided legal assistance to the National \nBank of Tajikistan (NBT) and initiated technical support for nongovernment organization (NGO) \nmicrocredit programs. A second input of legal assistance by the same consultant was funded by \nthe Open Society Institute (OSI) of the Soros Foundation during the Appraisal Mission. \n \n2. \nA  key  change  in  the  nature  of  the  loan  occurred  following  the  Consultative  Group \nMeeting in  May 2001.  The original technical assistance (TA) loan was converted into a sector \ndevelopment loan. The key processing steps were the following: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nReconnaissance Mission for a TA loan, 5\u201314 April 2000; \nTA Loan Fact-Finding Mission, 5\u201324 August 2000; \nTA Processing Mission, 28 February\u201314 March 2001; \nA  mission  seeking  government  agreement  to  change  the  TA  loan  to  a  sector \ndevelopment program loan, 20\u201326 June 2001; \n(v) \nLoan Fact-Finding Mission, 3\u201315 February 2002;  \n(vi) \nAppraisal Mission, 29 April\u201317 May 2002; \nSpecial Mission, 23\u201325 October 2002. \n(vii) \n(viii)  Postappraisal Mission, 1\u201308 February 2003. \n\n \n3. \nA key aspect of processing has been the consultative process initiated by ADB. An initial \nworkshop for NBT and NGOs was convened during the August 2000 Mission. This workshop (i) \nhighlighted  to  the  Government  the  significant  role  of  NGOs  in  microfinance,  (ii)  identified  the \nissues  and  constraints  affecting  the  operations  of  NGO  programs,  and  (iii)  culminated  in  the \nformation of a government-NGO working group chaired by NBT. The working group has met on \nseveral occasions, usually during ADB missions and with SSTA consultants. \n \n4. \nDuring  the  Appraisal  Mission,  NBT  chaired  a  two-day  conference  on  the  policy,  legal, \nand  regulatory  environment  for  microfinance  for  over  50  representatives  from  NGOs, \nGovernment, NBT, and external funding agencies. ADB and OSI jointly funded the conference. \n \n5. \nAid coordination and cooperation have also been important elements in loan processing. \nThe  increasing  interest  in  the  development  of  microfinance  culminated  in  an  inaugural  donor \nmeeting  on  microfinance  on  7  February  2002,  in  Dushanbe,  organized  by  the  Consultative \nGroup to Assist the Poorest with funding by United States Agency for International Development \n(USAID).  The  meeting  agreed  that  ADB  would  lead  in  developing  the  legal  and  regulatory \nframework and also chair the second donor meeting. The second meeting was held during the \nconference  on  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory  reforms  for  microfinance.  An  e-mail  network  has \nbeen established among donors and NGOs. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOUs) from \nthe  loan  fact-finding  and  appraisal  missions  were  distributed  to  all  participating  donors  and \nNGOs. \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2000.

The \nmacroeconomic  situation  has  seen  steady  improvement,  with  GDP  growing  at  an  average  annual \nrate of 7% since 1997. The growth, however, is not broad based and reflects favorable international \nmarket  conditions  for  cotton  and  aluminum,  which  may  prove  temporary.  Inflation  has  moderated \nsince  1997  as  well.  Overall,  we  expect  GDP  to  grow  by  6%  per  year  through  2005,  with  inflation \nbeing held to a maximum of 5% per year over the same period.   \n \nPoverty  reduction  is  a  major  objective  of  our  development  program.  In  June  2002  the  Parliament \napproved a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, in which the Government estimates that 60% of the \npopulation live is living in poverty. Some poverty studies show a rate closer to 80%. In rural areas \nwhere more than 75% of the people live, there is a much greater degree of extreme poverty, 23% \ncompared  to  19%  in  urban  areas.  The  Government  of  Tajikistan  and  the  International  Monetary \nFund started implementation of the new three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility Program \n(PRGF).  The  Program  represents  a  great  step  forward  for  Tajikistan,  and  provides  substantial \nresources with which to take on the task of poverty reduction.  \n \nThe  principal  objective  of  our  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  is  to  achieve  a  fair  distribution  of  the \nbenefits of growth and ensure a rise in living standards of the poorest groups of the population. With \nthis objective in mind, the Government aims to encourage the development of an effective financial \nsector capable of mobilizing savings and providing financial intermediation with particular attention to \nthe needs of micro, small and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs), dekhkan farms and farmers, and \npeople living in rural areas.   \n \nThere  has  been  achieved  significant  progress  with  support  of  IFOs  and  donors  in  expanding \nmicrocredit activities targeting MSEs and poorer rural households through programs organized and \nmanaged by non-governmental organizations in Tajikistan. Some of the best programs demonstrate \nmeasurable  success,  in  terms  of  numbers  of  clients  served,  repayment  rates  (greater  than  95%), \nand an ability to recover the cost of program administration through interest and fee charges. These \nsuccesses  create  the  hope  that  by  applying  international  best  practices  in  microfinance,  well \ndesigned  programs  in  Tajikistan  can  grow  to  achieve  significant  outreach  and  financial  self-\nsustainability.   \n \nIn order to meet the overall goals and specific objectives included in the National Poverty Reduction \nStrategy, and in consideration the positive developments within the small but growing microfinance \n\n\f \n40\n\nAppendix 3 \n\nsector,  the  Government  has  adopted  a  Microfinance  Sector  Development  Policy  (MF  Policy).  The \ngoal of the MF Policy is to create a strong financial market capable  of providing essential financial \nservices  to  MSEs,  rural  households,  and  the  poor.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  in \ncooperation  with  the  Government  has  created  a  Microfinance  Systems  Development  Program \n(MSDP) that is fully supportive of the Government's MF Policy.   \n \nMSDP  will  help  the  Government  to  deepen  the  financial  sector  by  increasing  the  outreach  and \nsustainability of market-oriented microfinance services to the poor. This will be achieved through: (i) \nthe  development  of  a  conducive  policy,  regulatory,  and  institutional  environment  for  microfinance; \nand  (ii)  the  development  of  viable  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs)  to  reach  the  poor.  The \nGovernment considers this ADB program to be a critically important element of the poverty reduction \nstrategy  and  a  vital  initiative  to  deepen  financial  markets  in  Tajikistan,  providing  access  to  needed \nfinancial services to the poor. \n \nThe Government, through the MF Policy, recognizes the leading role that domestic and international \nNGOs are playing in developing the microfinance sector. The Government has also recognized the \nurgent need for an enabling policy, legal and regulatory framework, to allow these organizations to \nexpand their activities and transform themselves into safe and sound financial institutions. The MF \nPolicy  establishes  consultative  and  advisory  bodies  to  ensure  full  stakeholder  participation  in  the \ncreation  of  the  enabling  environment.  While  process  is  important,  the  main  emphasis  of  the  MF \nPolicy is to promote the sustainable provision of microfinance services through licensed, and where \nappropriate, regulated microfinancial institutions (MFIs).   \n \nAs part of the Government's program to promote microfinance, a Law on Microfinance Institutions is \nin  its  final  stage  of  stakeholder  review  and  consultation.    This  law  will  create  the  proper  legal \nfoundation  for  the  licensing  of  programs  now  engaged  in  microfinance,  mainly  in  the  provision  of \nmicro credit, in Tajikistan. The drafting and enactment of the law represents an important step in the \ndevelopment  of  the  microfinance  sector.  The  Government  and  ADB  are  dedicated  to  further \ndeveloping the enabling environment for microfinance by harmonizing the Law on Microfinance with \nother  laws  (supported  by  follow-on  efforts  from  ADB  and  other  donors),  and  creating  appropriate \nregulations and a supervisory regime to make the new Law on Microfinance Institutions effective.   \n \nMr. President, both the Government of Tajikistan and ADB share a common objective of reducing \npoverty. The Government is certain that the measures to be adopted under MSDP will significantly \nstrengthen the outreach, viability, and sustainability of the microfinance sector, and support the goals \nand objectives of the Government's MF Policy and its National Poverty Reduction Strategy. We and \nparticularly rural dwellers and poor households that are now, or who will be, clients of MFIs expect \nthat the microenterprises, will make contribution to economic growth and to improve their standard of \nliving.   \n \nI  wish  to  convey  my  sincere  appreciation  for  the  support  ADB  has  provided  to  facilitate  the \ndevelopment  of  microfinance  in  Tajikistan  and  look  forward  to  the  successful  implementation  of \nMSDP,  from  which  the  people  of  Tajikistan  will  benefit  substantially.  The  Government  pledges  to \ncoordinate all MSDP activities with utmost care in order to ensure the optimal use of the resources \nprovided through MSDP. \n \n \n\nRespectfully yours, \n\nAkil Akilov /signed/ \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n41\n\nObjective \n\nMeasures \nto be Taken \n\nMonitoring \nMechanism \n\nResponsible \nAgencies \n\nTime Frame \n\nPOLICY MATRIX \n\nA.

Women in Tajikistan have suffered from the combined adverse impact \nof  the  country\u2019s  transition  to  a  market  economy  and  the  5\u2013year  civil  conflict,  which  ensued \nimmediately  after  independence.  Decreased  economic  activity,  death  of  men,  or  their  out \nmigration  of  men  to  seek  jobs  outside  the  country  intensified  women\u2019s  workload  and \nparticipation in the informal sector and low-paying formal labor market. Women\u2019s limited access \nto productive and remunerative resources has constrained women\u2019s economic opportunities and \nhas  confined  rural  women,  especially,  to  coping  strategies  for  survival.  The  collapse  of  social \nsafety  nets  and  social  protection  measures  increased  women\u2019s  household  responsibilities  and \nreduced their representation at the community and national levels. With the decrease in public \nsocial expenditures, gender disparities became more pronounced. Net enrolment ratio of girls to \nboys declined dramatically especially in the 7\u201318-year age bracket. Deteriorating health status \namong women and children worsened with the decline in health care services and reduction of \nmunicipal infrastructure, particularly potable drinking water.  \n \nThe resumption of peace and the positive economic growth in recent years have yet to \n2. \nmake a significant dent in material poverty and its multifaceted dimensions as well as on gender \ndisparities. Disturbing trends that need to be addressed are the (i) sharp decline in labor force \nparticipation,  especially  among  women;  (ii)  increasing  out  migration,  particularly  among  young \nrural males, putting additional workload on women-headed households; and (iii) limited access \nto social services for women and children. Rural and poor women are the most disadvantaged \nas they must try to make both ends meet through intensive cultivation of small household plots \nwhile rearing their children and caring for the elderly.  \n \n3. \nGender and Microfinance. The introduction of microfinance services by NGOs in major \npoverty-stricken and previously conflict-ridden regions during the second half of the 1990s was \ntimely  as  it  provided  a  lifeline  support,  especially  to  rural  women.  Access  to  microfinance \nservices  gave  women  capital  and  became  for  most  the  foundation  to  build  sustainable \nlivelihoods.  By  2001  about  17  NGOs  had  provided  microfinance  to  around  44,000  borrowers, \nabout  60%  of  whom  are  women.  Most  women  beneficiaries  have  accessed  small-scale  credit \nlines  to  engage  largely  in  trading  and  service-based  activities.  Some  recent  surveys  of \ninternational NGOs have shown that incomes derived from this informal source have improved \nbeneficiaries\u2019 revenue stream by 20\u201360%, and many female-headed and poor households have \nbeen able to solve their food insecurity. Women also benefited from the training as it honed their \nbusiness  and  management  skills  and  improved  their  awareness  of  their  human  rights.  As \nimmediate  income  needs  are  met,  women  beneficiaries  engage  in  community  development \nactivities, participate in local governance, and policy dialogues, and network with other women \ngroups.  \n \nGender  Issues.  Partnerships  and  networking  between  NGOs  and  Government  have \n4. \nlikewise improved the environment for women\u2019s economic empowerment. The basic framework \nfor mainstreaming the gender agenda into the national political arena is laid out in the National \nPlan  of  Action  for  Women\u2019s  Advancement  and  the  National  Program  for  Equal  Opportunities \nbetween  Women  and  Men.  However,  more  policy,  regulatory,  and  supervisory  reforms  are \nrequired  to  expand  the  outreach  of  microfinance  services.  To  date,  only  about  8%  of  the  total \npopulation has access to microfinance services. While women clients outnumber men, demand \nfor microfinance services remains large and unmet. For instance, microfinance institution (MFI) \ndeposit  schemes  are  prohibited  legally,  not  only  inhibiting MFIs\u2019  capacity  to  mobilize  domestic \nresources  but  also  harming  women  in  general  as  they  save  more  than  men.  Women  also \nparticipate  mainly  in  group  lending  schemes  rather  than  higher-end  capital  activities,  partly \n\n\f62\n\n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nbecause  of  cultural  and  social  barriers  and  partly  due  to  legal  impediments  that  delimit  equal \naccess  to  ownership  of  productive  assets.  The  human  capital  of  women  will  need  to  be \nupgraded  to  enable  them  to  access  capital  and  engage  in  more  risky  but  more  profitable \nbusiness  ventures.  Last,  institutional  capacity  building  is  needed  to  ensure  sustainable \nmicrofinance services and to mainstream the gender agenda.  \n \n5. \nGender  Strategy  and  Plan.  The  objectives  of  the  gender  strategy  are  to  (i)  ensure \nbroader  participation  of  women  in  microfinance;  (ii)  facilitate  the  formulation  of  a  policy, \nregulatory,  and  supervisory  framework  conducive  to  microfinance  development,  which  will,  in \nturn,  mainstream \nfurthering  women\u2019s  economic  and  political \nempowerment;  and  (iii)  lay  the  foundation  for  sustainable  gender-based  NGOs  that  provide \nmicrofinance services.  \n \n6. \nGender Targets. Activities to be carried out under Microfinance Systems Development \nProgram (MSDP) will consider gender equity. MSDP will mandate the minimum participation of \nwomen in two areas: (i) for all training and other capacity-building exercises, no less than 50% \nof the participants will be women; and (ii) NGOs selected to become MFIs and that wish to avail \nthemselves of the credit line must have at least 50% women microcredit clients.  \n \n\nthe  gender  agenda  of \n\nComponents and Targets for Gender Strategy \n \n\n Activity \n-   Government policy and \n\n Approach and Target \n\n-   The project will ensure that \n\n Component \nPolicy, legal, regulatory, \nand institutional actions \nto develop MFIs \n\n-  Training and other in-\n\n -  MSDP capacity-building \n\nstrategy for \ndevelopment of MFIs \n-   Legislative actions for \nMFI classification, tax \ncode amendments, \namendments of laws \ncovering financial \ninstitutions, etc. \n-   Regulation and \nsupervision \n\nhouse capacity-building \nactivities \n\nthe reforms will not negatively \nimpact on the gender agenda \nof furthering women\u2019s \neconomic, social, and political \nempowerment.  \n\n-   Target: Policy, legislative, and \nregulatory reforms affecting \nMFIs \n\nactivities will address the \nessential gender issues \nrelated to promoting \nmicrofinance services and \nensuring the development \nand maintenance of a \ndatabase on gender, income \npoverty, and microfinance.  \n-   Gender target: Project training \nactivities will have no less \nthan 50% women participants.\n\nCapacity building for \n-  National Bank of \n\nTajikistan in legal, \nregulatory, and \nsupervisory \nrequirements for MFIs; \nand  \n\n-  NGOs becoming \n\nformally licensed and \nregulated MFIs \n\n\fPilot-testing of the \ntransformation of \nselected NGO \nmicrofinance programs \ninto formally licensed \nand regulated MFIs \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n 63\n\n- Criteria for MFI selection \n- Identification of MFIs \n- Operation of MFIs \n\n-   Women should make up at \nleast 50% of MFIs\u2019 clients.  \n-   The project will ensure that \n\nmid- and post-assessment of \ngender will be undertaken. \n-   Gender target: MFIs selected \nfor participation in the project \nwill have no less than 50% \nwomen clients. \n\n\f64\n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nPROPOSED ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR PARTICIPATING COMMERCIAL BANKS \n\n \n1. \nThe project credit line will be available for Microfinance Systems Development Program \n(MSDP) participating commercial banks (PCBs), which will be selected based on the eligibility \ncriteria outlined below, and subject to the approval of the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) and \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). Eligibility will mean that the PCB qualifies to on-lend funds to \nmicrofinance institutions (MFIs). In some special cases, PCBs may be allowed to access ADB \ncredit-line funds for direct on-lending to micro- and small enterprises (MSEs).  \n \nA. \n \n2. \neligibility criteria at initial assessment:  \n\nThe  PCBs  will  be  thoroughly  examined  to  ensure  that  they  comply  with  the  following \n\nCriteria for Initial Participation \n\n \n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n(viii) \n\nbe legally licensed; \ncomply  with  all  NBT  prudential  requirements  (see  attached  list)  on  the  basis  of \nperformance without waiver or forbearance by NBT; \nhave  a  \"satisfactory\"  on-site  examination  report  issued  by  NBT  within  the  past \nyear; \nbe profitable for the past 2 calendar years as demonstrated by externally audited \nfinancial statements prepared in international accounting standards (IAS) format; \nhave a return on average assets for past two calendar years of at least 2%; \nhave capital relative to risk weighted assets of 15%. \ndemonstrate capacity to analyze credit risk of MFIs; and  \ncomply with additional criteria as recommended by the project management unit \n(PMU), National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT), microfinance policy steering committee \n(MPSC), technical working group (TWG) and approved by ADB. For new banks, \nNBT and ADB may exercise discretion in the application of criteria (iii), (iv), and \n(v), but will require detailed pro forma financial statements.  \n\nOngoing Eligibility Criteria for Participating Commercial Banks \n\n \nB. \n \nThroughout  the  project  period,  the  PMU  at  NBT,  along  with  ADB,  will  monitor  PCBs\u2019 \n3. \ncompliance  with  eligibility  criteria.  PCBs  will  make  quarterly  and  annual  financial  statements \navailable to the PMU and ADB so that ongoing eligibility can be verified throughout the project \nperiod.  Annual  financial  statements  will  be  reviewed  by  an  external  auditor,  who  will  offer  an \nopinion  on  the  accuracy  of  the  accounting  and  financial presentation.  Annual  audited  financial \nstatements will be submitted to the PMU and ADB within 180 days from the end of the financial \nyear.  \n \nIf  a  PCB  is  found  not  to  be  in  compliance  with  the  initial  and  ongoing  participation \n4.  \ncriteria, the PMU and NBT, with prior approval of ADB, will determine whether the PCB will (i) \nprepare and implement a plan of action with the objective of reaching compliance, or (ii) will be \nexcluded  from  the  project  credit  line.  Any  PCB  that  is  not  in  compliance  for  more  than  one \nquarter will be automatically excluded from the project. If a PCB is excluded from the project, it \nwill pay back to the project all funds received. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n65\n\nParticipating Commercial Bank Qualification as MFI \n\nC. \n \n5. \nExisting  or  new  commercial  banks  may  wish  to  provide  financial  services  to  clients \ncomposed  mainly  of  MSEs  and  poor  households.  MSDP  will  allow  PCBs  qualified  to  access \ncredit-line funds to on-lend directly to MSEs, individuals, and groups, so long as the PCB can \ndemonstrate to the PMU, NBT, and ADB that its (i) ratio of average loan size to GDP per capita \nis  not  more  than  200%;  and  (ii)  at  least  50%  of  its  borrowing  clients  are  women.  In  addition, \nPCBs  wishing  to  retail  funds  directly  to  MSEs  and  individuals  are  subject  to  the  additional \nborrowing limits defined by three financial ratios to which participating MFIs are also subjected: \n \n\n(i)  \n\n(ii)  \n\n(iii)  \n\ntotal  loans of  the  PCB  as  a  percentage  of  total  assets  must  be  at  least  70%  (a \nnew  PCB  must  show,  through  its  pro  forma  financial  statements,  that  this \npercentage  will  be  achieved  within  one  year,  and  then  demonstrate  compliance \nwithin one year);  \ntotal  borrowings  of  a  PCB  under  the  credit  line  to  total  loans  must  be  less  than \n50%; and  \nfixed assets may not be greater than 10% of total assets of the PCB.  \n\nNational Bank of Tajikistan Prudential Regulations \n\nRecommended Level of General Provisions for Loan Losses \n\n \nD. \n \nPCBs will follow a rule-based system for loan classification and provisioning as outlined \n6. \nby NBT (see \"Other Requirements\" in the attached schedule of NBT prudential regulations for \ncommercial banks). In addition to the requirements for specific provisions, PCBs will mandate a \nminimum  of  1%  general  provision  for  loan  losses:  that  is,  at  least  1%  of  the  initial  principal \namount of every loan made by a PCB will be charged as an expense to create a general loan \nloss reserve.  \n \n7. \nA  PCB  must  prepare  and  provide  a  copy  of  its  loan  ageing  schedule\u2014showing  the \namount  of  loans  by  loan  classification  (i.e.,  \"special  mention,\"  \"substandard,\"  \"doubtful,\"  and \n\"loss,\")  and  the  amount  of  provisions  set  aside  by  loan  classification\u2014to  the  PMU  and  ADB \nevery quarter at least, with the annual ageing schedule subject to external audit. \n \nE. \n \n8. \nNovember 2002. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe  following  is  a  full  list  of  NBT\u2019s  prudential  regulations  for  commercial  banks  as  of \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n66\n\n \n\nType \n\n1.

MFIs \nwill  be  qualified  to  participate  in  the  credit-line  component  of  the  Microfinance  Systems \nDevelopment  Program  (MSDP)  based  on  their  meeting  the  initial  participation  criteria  outlined \nbelow,  and  subject  to  the  approval  of  the  National  Bank  of  Tajikistan  (NBT)  and  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). The amount that an MFI can borrow will be limited by financial ratio \ntests,  which  will  be  measured  and  monitored  on  an  ongoing  basis.  Continuing  participation  in \nthe  project  will  depend  on  meeting  certain  performance  benchmarks.  Finally,  MFIs  will  be \nrequired  to  report  specific  performance  indicators  related  to  their  outreach  and  sustainability. \nThe  measures  and  indicators  listed  here  represent  the  minimum  requirements  for  initial  and \nongoing  MFI  participation  in  MSDP,  and  the  minimum  set  of  performance  indicators  to  be \napplied to MFIs.  \n \nA. \n \n2. \nMFIs  will  be  thoroughly  examined  to  ensure  that  they  comply  with  the  participation \ncriteria at the time of assessment of initial eligibility. The following is a minimum list of eligibility \ncriteria for MFI participation in MSDP:  \n\nCriteria for Initial Participation \n\n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n(vii) \n\nbe legally licensed;  \ncomply with all NBT prudential requirements for MFIs;  \nhave a ratio of average loan size to gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of \nnot more than 200 % \nhave at least 50% women borrowing clients;  \nhave  achieved  operational  self-sufficiency  (OSS)  (as  measured  by  a  positive \nOSS ratio, further defined in section C); \nhave capital relative to risk-weighted assets of 15%;  \ndemonstrate  capacity  to  analyze  and  manage  credit  risk  of  micro-  and  small \nenterprises and individual borrowers; and  \n\n(viii)  comply  with  additional  criteria  recommended  by  the  project  management  unit \n(PMU), National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT), microfinance policy steering committee \n(MPSC), technical working group (TWG), and approved by ADB.  \n\n1. Borrowing Limits \n\nOngoing Participation Criteria  \n\n \nB. \n \n \n \nMFIs  must  be  prevented  from  depending  excessively  on  the  credit  line  for  funding, \n3. \nbuilding  up  excessive  amounts  of  liquidity,  and  overinvesting  in  non-earning  assets.  Financial \nratios will serve to limit the amount that an MFI may borrow. Notwithstanding other financial ratio \ntests to be applied by NBT, to be qualified to participate in the credit line component of MSDP, \nan MFI may at no time have the following: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\ntotal loans less than 70% of total assets;  \nborrowings under the credit line greater than 50% of total loans; and \nfixed assets greater than 10%of total assets.  \n\n \n \n\n\f68\n\n \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n2. Periodic Reporting, Compliance, and Noncompliance \n \n4. \nThroughout the project period, participating MFIs will provide to PCBs, as well as to the \nproject management unit (PMU) and ADB, reports demonstrating the continuing compliance of \nthe  MFI  with  the  initial  participation  criteria  and  the  three  financial  ratios  that  define  the \nborrowing  limits.  Compliance  reports  will  be  prepared  quarterly  and  be  made  available  to  the \nPCBs,  PMU,  and  ADB  within  30  days  of  the  end  of  each  quarter.  Annual  audited  financial \nstatements  will  be  submitted  to  the  PCBs,  PMU,  and  ADB  within  180  days  of  the  end  of  the \nfinancial year, and this audited financial report will include an audited compliance report.  \n \n5.  \nIf  an  MFI  is  found  not  to  be  in  compliance  with  the  initial  and  ongoing  participation \ncriteria, the PCB, in consultation with the PMU and NBT, and with the prior approval of ADB, will \ndetermine whether the MFI concerned will (i) prepare and implement a plan of action with the \nobjective of reaching compliance, or (ii) be excluded from the project credit line. Any MFI that is \nnot in compliance for more than one quarter will be automatically excluded from the project. If \nan MFI is excluded from the Project, it will pay back to the PCB all Project funds made available \nthrough the Project. The PCB, in turn, must repay the funds received from the excluded MFI to \nNBT within 3 working days. \n \nC.  \n \n6. \nThe  performance  of  MFIs  will  be  measured  using  four  categories  of  performance-\nmonitoring  indicators:  outreach,  profitability  and/or  self-sustainability,  portfolio  quality,  and \nefficiency. During implementation, MSDP will prepare a program of indicators for the individual \nMFI.  PCBs,  in  consultation  with  the  PMU  and  ADB,  may  use  these  indicators,  particularly  the \nfinancial  indicators,  to  develop  covenants  for  inclusion  in  credit  agreements  with  MFIs.  The \nfinancial performance indicators also provide the basis for a rating system for  MFIs that could \ninform  or  condition  pricing,  i.e.,  actual  performance  that  surpasses  pro  forma  performance \nindicators could result in a reduction in the pricing of future loans. The program of indicators to \nbe developed for each MFI will include the following: \n \n\nPerformance Monitoring Indicators \n\n1. \n\nOutreach Indicators \n\n \n7. \nOutreach  of  MFIs  has  two  main  dimensions:  breadth  (number  of  clients)  and  depth \n(degree  of  poverty  of  clients).  The  following  indicators  will  be  used  to  evaluate  the  MFIs\u2019 \nperformance in achieving outreach: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\nnumber  of  active  borrowers,  measured  at  the  end  of  each  month,  quarter,  and \nyear;  \nnumber of borrowers served during specific periods: month, quarter, year; \nnumber of loans disbursed during specific periods: month, quarter, year; \npercentage of female active borrowers at the end of each month, quarter, year; \nnumber of voluntary depositors at the end of each month, quarter, year; \npercentage  of  female  voluntary  depositors  at  the  end  of  each  month,  quarter, \nyear; \ntotal  amount  of  voluntary  deposits  outstanding  at  the  end  each  month,  quarter, \nyear; and \nratio  of  the  average  loan  balance  to  gross  national  product  (GNP)  per  capita, \nmeasured quarterly, based upon most recent GNP per capita figure published by \nthe International Monetary Fund (IMF).  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n69\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nActive borrowers include all individuals who have an outstanding loan balance with the \n8. \nMFI.  This  number  should  be  based  on  the  individual  borrowers  rather  than  the  number  of \ngroups. \n\n2. \n\nProfitability/Self-Sustainability \n\n \n9. \nIn the case of commercial banks, profitability is measured generally in terms of return on \nequity and return on assets, and these measures are relevant for MFIs as well. MFIs, which are \noften  recipients  of  noncommercial  support  and/or  funding,  also  need  to  consider  operational \nself-sufficiency  and  financial  self-sufficiency  indicators  that  show  the  capacity  of  an  MFIs  to \ncontinue functioning once support comes to an end. The following indicators will be applied to \nparticipating MFIs to measure profitability and self-sustainability: \n\n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nAdjusted  return  on  equity.  Net  operating  income  less  taxes/adjusted  average \nequity.  Measures  the  MFI's  ability  to  generate  profits  that  provide  a  reasonable \nreturn to investors. \nAdjusted  return  on  assets.  Net  operating  income  less  taxes/adjusted  average \ntotal  assets.  Measures  the  MFI's  ability  to  generate  revenue  from  investments, \nand convert revenue into profit.  \n\n(iii)  OSS  ratio.  Operating  revenue/(operating  expense  +  unadjusted  financing \nexpense + loan loss provision expense). Measures the MFI's ability to cover all of \nits actual expenses from its revenue stream. \n\n(iv)  Adjusted financial self-sufficiency ratio. Adjusted operating revenue/adjusted \n(operating  expense  +  financial  expense  +  loan  loss  provision  expense  -  net \nextraordinary  income).  Measures  the  MFI's  ability  to  cover  its  total  costs, \nincluding  actual  costs  and  imputed  costs,  of  which  imputed  costs  are  added  to \nsimulate full commercial operating conditions. \n\n \n10. \nAdjustments essentially represent imputed costs that MFIs often do not incur directly due \nto financial support from funding agencies or other agencies. Inflation must also be considered. \nThe value, in real terms, of an MFI's capital must also be maintained. Only after imputing costs \nrelated to inflation and neutralizing the benefits of operational or financial subsidies is it possible \nto determine whether an MFI is commercially  viable or approaching commercial viability. After \nadding  imputed  costs  (or  subtracting  imputed  benefits),  adjustments  to  income  statement  and \nbalance  sheet  figures  must  be  made.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  MFI \nperformance  against  these  profitability  and  self-sustainability  indicators,  and  will  calculate  and \nadjust the income statement and balance sheet data according to criteria provided to the PMU \nby the project.  \n \n \n \n11. \nThe  MFI's  performance  at  loan  collection  must  be  monitored.  Loan  classification  and \nloan  loss  provisioning  are  as  important  to  an  MFI  as  to  a  commercial  bank.  NBT  regulations \ndeveloped  for  MFIs  are  assumed  to  incorporate  similar  loan  classification  and  provisioning \nrequirements  as  those  applied  to  commercial  banks.  New  MFIs  should  be  provided  with \nadditional  indicators  of  portfolio  quality  to  help  develop  a  strong  credit  culture.  The  following \nindicators will be applied by the PCBs and PMU to monitor MFI portfolio quality:  \n \n\n Portfolio Quality \n\n3. \n\n(i) \n\nPortfolio at risk (PAR) ratio. PAR (over 30 days)/gross loan portfolio.This is a \nvery conservative indicator of portfolio quality, and measures the financial impact \n\n\f70\n\n \n\nAppendix 13 \n\non  the  portfolio  in  case  all  past  due  loans  go  unpaid.  PAR  is  the  outstanding \nprincipal amount of all loans that have one or more installments of principal past \ndue  by  a  certain  number  of  days.  PAR  includes  the  entire  unpaid  principal \nbalance (in past due and future installments) but not accrued interest. PAR does \nnot include loans that have been restructured or rescheduled. Under MSDP, ADB \nrecommends MFIs use 30 days as the cut-off for past dues.  \n\nCurrent  due  collection  ratio.  Amount  collected  of  current  loans  due/total \namount of current loan due. This measures the MFI's ability to collect loans in the \nnormal  course  of  business,  that  is,  when  they  come  due,  and  indicates  the \nefficiency of the MFI's ordinary collection activities.  \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n\n \n\nPast  due  collection  ratio.  Amount  collected  of  past  dues/total  amount  of  past \ndues.  This  measures  the  MFI's  ability  to  collect  late  loans,  and  indicates  the \nefficiency of the MFI in managing extraordinary recovery activities. \n\n4. \n\nEfficiency \n\n \n \n \n12.  MFIs  must  achieve  sizeable  outreach,  which  is  in  many  ways  a  proxy  measure  of \npoverty  impact.  MFIs  must  also  be  profitable  to  attract  more  investors  and  capital.  Managing \ncredit  risk  properly  is  also  important,  because  loan  losses  can  quickly  erode  capital  and \nundermine  financial  strength.  From  the  point  of  view  of  the  customer,  the  MFI  must  operate \nefficiently, that is, manage its cost structure to provide services as cost-effectively as possible. \nCost-effectiveness means that the MFI can offer credit products at a lower interest rate, or pay a \nhigher  rate  of  interest  on  deposits.  MSDP  will  monitor  the  efficiency  of  participating  MFIs  by \nsubjecting MFIs to the following efficiency indicators:  \n \n\nEfficiency  ratio.  Adjusted  operating  expense/adjusted  (net  interest  margin  \u2013 \nprovisions for loan losses + other recurring income). Adjusted operating expense \nis the numerator. This indicator is a standard banking indicator of efficiency as it \nshows how many units of net revenue are generated for each unit of expenditure; \nit is, in effect, an input-output ratio.  \n\nCost  per  borrower.  Adjusted  operating  expense/average  number  of  active \nborrowers.
