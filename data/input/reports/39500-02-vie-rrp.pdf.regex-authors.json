I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Ho Chi Minh City \nUrban Mass Rapid Transit Line 2 Investment Program.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n2.  Strategic context of urban transport. The Government of Viet Nam is well aware of \nthe impact of inadequate transport infrastructure on economic growth. Without investment in \npublic transport infrastructure in cities, economic growth will be constrained and the urban \nenvironment will degrade further. The Viet Nam Socio Economic Development Plan for 2011\u2013\n2015 supports investments in public transport to promote economic growth and protect the \nenvironment.  ADB\u2019s  2007\u20132010  Viet  Nam  country  strategy  and  program 2 supports  the \ngovernment's  investment  program  to  improve  urban  transport  infrastructure  and  reduce \ntransportation costs. \n \n3.  Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) is the largest city in Viet Nam, with a population of over 9 \nmillion  that  is  expected  to  grow  to  13.8  million  by  2025.  Private  vehicles  dominate \ntransportation, but road infrastructure is reaching the saturation point, which will worsen as more \nmotorbike users convert to cars with improving household incomes. Road network development \nfaces space limitations and will not be able to meet the expected increase in demand, so private \ntransport is not sustainable as the principal transportation mode. A well-integrated high-capacity \npublic  transport  system  is  essential,  and  a  rail  mass  rapid  transit  (MRT)  system  is  most \nappropriate  for  densely  populated  cities.  Without  improvements  in  major  public  transport \ninfrastructure, combined with policies that support a modal shift to public transport, HCMC\u2019s \neconomic growth will be constrained by high logistics costs and severe congestion.  \n \n4.  The proposed investment program will develop one of three priority urban rail MRT lines \nin HCMC to support the establishment of a sustainable urban transportation system.3 The \nconstruction of MRT Line 2 (MRT2) will facilitate public transport access and connectivity in six \ncentral districts of HCMC, promote a modal shift from private to public transport, and support \nlow-carbon transport that reduces greenhouse gas emissions. \n \n5.  Ho  Chi  Minh  City  public  transport  sector.  The  existing  public  transport  system \nconsists of an inefficient and poorly integrated bus network that is not competitive with private \ntransport and has a modal share below 5%. Traffic planning is weak, and inadequate traffic \nmanagement systems do not promote the use of public transport. Rapid growth in the private \nownership of cars and motorbikes has caused heavy congestion along major routes and inner-\ncity areas, contributing to a dangerous urban environment. With increasing traffic in central \nHCMC, high volume public transport modes are required to both alleviate existing congestion \nand  meet  growing  transportation  demand.  Policy  and  regulatory  measures  are  needed  to \n                                                \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 ADB.2006.Country Strategy and Program: Viet Nam, 2007-2010 Manila. \n3 ADB.2006. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Preparing the Ho Chi Minh City Metro Rail \nSystem Project. Manila (TA 4862-VIE ) and ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam \nfor the Ho Chi Minh City Urban Mass Rapid Transit Line 2 Project. Manila (TA 7343-VIE). The first publication of \nthe investment program in www.adb.org was on 15 March 2006. ", "2 \npromote  public  transport  and  discourage  private  transport,  but  these  measures  cannot  be \nimplemented until a viable public transport system exists for city residents and commuters.  \n \n6.  The prime minister approved in January 2007 the HCMC Urban Transport Master Plan,4 \nwhich proposes developing nine MRT lines, strengthening traffic management, and improving \nthe bus system to support a shift from private to public transport. The key objective of the plan is \nto increase the share of public transport to 45%\u201350%. Slowing the proliferation of private \nvehicles on city roads will contribute to an improved urban environment by reducing accidents \nand air and noise pollution and making urban areas more pedestrian friendly. \n \n7.  Public  transport  financing  and  sustainability.  The public transport improvements \nproposed in the master plan up to 2020 are estimated to cost $5.3 billion, including $4.5 billion \nfor three priority rail MRT lines. The central government provides investment financing for the \ninfrastructure components but not for operational equipment and systems. As annual budgetary \nallocations can meet less than 20% of the plan\u2019s financing requirements, the shortfall requires \nfinancing from other sources such as international financial institutions and the private sector. \nPublic transport services are financed primarily from allocations under the HCMC budget, but \nsources  of  revenue  are  not  maximized.  Bus  fares  are  kept  low  to  compete  with  private \ntransport,5 and there is no reconciliation between fare revenues and expenditures, resulting in \nsubsidized  bus  services.  Cost  recovery  is  further  hampered  by  inefficient  institutional \narrangements for establishing, allocating, and operating bus routes. Improving public transport \nsustainability requires a multipronged approach that includes establishing high-capacity MRT \nlines to offer an efficient, affordable alternative to private vehicles, as well as restricting private \nvehicles through economic and other measures. \n \n8.  Support for sustainable transport in HCMC will be achieved by integrating MRT2 with \nother public transport systems, including improving connectivity to the bus network and new \nfeeder routes, enhancing integration and accessibility at stations, pedestrian-friendly access, \nand  instituting  policy  changes  to  restrict  private  vehicle  use  in  the  city  center.  The \nimplementation of these measures will be supported through a proposed loan using the Clean \nTechnology Fund (CTF)6 and ADB financing in 2012. \n \n9.  Financing modality. The multitranche financing facility is the modality best suited for \nthe proposed investment program. It allows ADB to enter into a sustained partnership with the \ngovernment for the long-term investments needed to implement the urban MRT network, which \nneeds staged financing. All conditions for its use are in place: a coherent strategy and sector \nroad map, a policy framework, an investment program, and a financing plan. \n \n10.  Lessons learned.  For large transport infrastructure projects in Viet Nam, experience \nindicates7 strong support is required to avoid implementation delays, ensure quality of works are \nachieved and build sustainable institutions.  Poor local capacity affects timely implementation of \nland acquisition and resettlement, so adequate time and strengthening are important.  These \nhave been incorporated into the project design and the multitranche financing facility structure. \n                                                \n \n4 Japan International Cooperation Agency. 2004.

The  impact  of  the  investment  program  will  be  the  establishment  of  an  integrated, \nsustainable public transport system in six districts of HCMC. The primary outcome will be \ncompetitive MRT services along the project corridor. \n \nC.  Outputs \n12.  Investment program. The outputs of the investment program will be (i) the construction \nof 11.3 kilometers (km) of a dual track rail MRT line from Ben Thanh to Tham Luong in HCMC, \nincluding  a  depot  at  Tham  Luong;  (ii)  strengthened  planning  and  preparation  of  a  policy \nframework for public transport; and (iii) implementation support for urban transport agencies in \nHCMC. The investment program will consist of two separate projects. \n \n13.  Project 1. This project consists of: \n(i)  MRT Line 2 system development. Initial works to facilitate MTR 2 development, \nincluding site preparation works and the construction of initial buildings at Tham \nLuong depot, remaining depot infrastructure works, initial systems for stations,8 \nand support for preparing functional designs9 and procurement. \n(ii)  MRT implementation support. Support to the implementing agency and other \nHCMC People\u2019s Committee agencies to assist with; \n(a)  project management and implementation for compliance with financier \nrequirements,  MRT  management,  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M), \nand public transport management; \n(b)  program of social development and gender mainstreaming to address key \nsocial development, gender, and public awareness issues; and \n(c)  a  study  of  integrated  sustainable  urban  transport  for  (1)  demand \nforecasting  and  integrated  fares  and  ticketing,  (2)  bus  service \nrestructuring and intermodal facilities, and (3) sustainable transport policy, \nwhose outputs will identify measures to improve public transport that will \nbe implemented under a separate CTF-funded project in 2012. \n \n14.

Financing Plan  \n16.  The government has requested a multitranche financing facility (MFF) in an amount up \nto $540 million through an MFF from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR) to help finance a \npart of the investment program. The MFF is anticipated to comprise two loans, subject to the \ngovernment  submitting  periodic  financing  requests,  the  execution  of  applicable  loan \nagreements, and compliance with the undertakings in a framework financing agreement entered \ninto between the government and ADB. The OCR financing will follow the provisions of the \nordinary operations loan regulations applicable to London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)\u2013based \nloans,10 which will apply to each such loan subject to any modifications that may be included \nunder individual loan agreements. The interest rates for each OCR loan will be determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility. The loan repayment period and other \nterms  and  conditions  for  each  OCR  loan  will  be  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project \nagreements. The government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow \nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany communication or advice from ADB.

Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The HCMC People\u2019s Committee has established a project steering committee led by the \npermanent vice chairman, which is supported by the Urban Railway Council. The executing \nagency will be the HCMC People\u2019s Committee, and the main implementing agency will be the \nManagement Authority for Urban Railways (MAUR). The Department of Transport will be the \nimplementing agency for the integrated sustainable urban transport component. MAUR was \nestablished in 2007 to implement all nine mass transit systems proposed under the Urban \nTransport Master  Plan,  with three MRT  lines under  preparation.  MAUR  has  established a \nproject management unit (PMU) for MRT2. The PMU head will ensure compliance with ADB \nprocurement and consulting guidelines and ADB safeguard policies. The capacity development \nprogram11 will provide extensive technical, financial, and management training to strengthen \nMAUR and compliment other capacity-building programs.  \n \n19.  MAUR will ensure that the investment program follows the detailed arrangements as \ndescribed in the facility administration manual (FAM). Any update of the FAM will become \neffective only after approval by Viet Nam and ADB. In the event of any discrepancy between the \nFAM  and  the  loan  agreements,  the  loan  agreements  will  prevail.

The Urban Transport Master Plan identified MRT2 as a priority line, and implementation \nis being coordinated closely with two other lines being concurrently developed.12 Technology \nchoices  are  based  on  efficient  modern  MRT  systems,  with  stations  designed  for  future \nintegration, depots developed with sufficient land to service future MRT lines13 and common \ntechnical  standards  adopted  for  inter-linked  facilities  between  different  MRT  lines.  Bidding \ndocuments will use a functional design, with the final design of the civil works and systems \ncontracted  on  a  design\u2013build  basis  to  enhance  system  and  equipment  optimization,  allow \ncontract interfaces to be efficiently managed, and achieve the timely completion of works. The \nequipment and systems contractor will offer an option to operate MRT2 as a concession under \nthe main O&M company for the initial 5 years to more effectively train and transfer knowledge to \nthe long-term operator.14 The main O&M company will be a public entity whose organizational \nstructure will be developed under technical assistance provided to MRT1 by other financiers. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n21.  The investment program will directly benefit public transport users and communities in \nsix districts and indirectly benefit all transport users in HCMC. The main benefits are derived \nfrom improved accessibility to better, safer, cheaper, more reliable, and faster transportation, \nwith additional benefits from deferred bus capital costs and reduced road maintenance costs. \nGreenhouse gas emissions and traffic congestion will be alleviated, providing social benefits \nthat include improved air quality, access to government services, and community quality of life.  \n \n22.  Transport demand forecast for MRT2 is 213,000 loadings per day at opening in 2017, \nincreasing to 703,000 loadings per day in 2035. The investment program has an estimated \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 12.4% and an economic net present value of $36.8 \nmillion. While the EIRR is low, it is typical of large investments in projects with long returns, and \nsome  secondary  benefits  not  included  in  the analysis  are  improved  logistics,  increases  in \nproperty values and tax revenues, and high congestion costs that would be incurred without the \nproject. The sensitivity and switching value analysis indicates that the EIRR is sensitive to \nchanges in user benefits or project costs of 5%, so there is moderate risk that the entire \ninvestment program will not reach the EIRR threshold of 12%. While civil works costs are at \nhigh risk of increasing, particularly for the underground section, there are also large upside \npotential benefits as improvements to the road network are unlikely to occur as planned, with \nconstrained capacity increasing private vehicle operating costs. \n \n23.  For  the  financial  analysis,  operating  cost  but  not  capital  cost15 is  covered  by  fare \nrevenue. The base case assumes that, by the start of operation, reorganized bus routes and \nother integration measures to optimize public transport will have been implemented. At the \nassumed fare of D4,000 per boarding, the patronage forecasts and annual fare revenue yields a \n                                                \n12 MRT Line 1 is currently at the bidding stage, and MRT Line 5 is at the feasibility study stage. \n13 The MRT2 depot will also be used for MRT Line 6 in the future. \n14 The long-term operator will be either a state-owned enterprise or under an operating concession agreement. \n15  Under Railway Law 2005, the HCMC People\u2019s Committee will be responsible for financing rolling stock, electrical \nand mechanical systems, land and resettlement, and incremental administration. Based on the financing plan, the \ncentral government is expected to onlend $381 million as a sub-loan in local currency and on-grant $696 million. \n ", "8 \nfare box ratio16 of 0.8 in the starting year of 2017 but thereafter equals or exceeds 1.0. The \ninvestment program is anticipated to require a total subsidy over the project life of $790 million. \nThe financial internal rate of return of the investment program after tax is 3.36%, which exceeds \nthe calculated weighted average cost of capital of 2.10%. If urban public transport system \noptimization does not materialize, the daily fare revenue drops by 40%, and the total subsidy \nrequired is $1.2 billion, a substantial increase in the subsidy burden on the government. \n \nC.  Governance \n24.  National and local governance performance in Viet Nam has improved recently. Public \nfinance  management  reform  has  brought  increased  disclosure  of  public  accounts,  higher \naccounting standards, and budgetary rules progress. The November 2005 Law on Procurement \nand regulations in 2006 and 2008 have established national bidding documents, but substantial \ngaps remain between the new national provisions and international-standard procedures, which \ncan delay implementation. Dialogue continues with the government on these issues, with a view \nto harmonizing national and international procedures. Measures to address corruption have \nimproved, with revisions to the Anti-Corruption Law in August 2007 that established a national \nanticorruption  steering  committee.  The  government  is  committed  to  reforming  national \ninstitutions  to  reduce  malfeasance  waste  and  improve  development  effectiveness.  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \nMinistry of Finance and MAUR. Specific policy requirements are described in the FAM. \n \n25.  The investment program will use international competitive bidding to improve oversight \nand  mitigate  corruption,  which  improves  governance  if  implementation  delays  are  avoided \nthrough  information  sharing.  The  bidding  process  will  be  further  enhanced  by  improved \ntransparency, information disclosure, oversight and monitoring, mitigation of fraud and collusion \nrisks, handling of complaints, and sanctions and remedies.  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social  \n26.  The investment program is a general intervention with indirect poverty reduction impacts. \nMajor beneficiaries will be public and private transport users, with women, students, children, \nand  older  people  expected  to  benefit  the  most  from  improved  transportation,  as  well  as \ncommunities in districts along the project corridor. Local economies are expected to improve as \nimproved and cheaper transport will create business opportunities, reduce congestion, and \nimprove the quality of life. Project districts will benefit from temporary construction jobs and local \nemployment in O&M.  \n27.    The potential adverse social impacts from the project are increased risk of spreading \nHIV/AIDS with the influx of construction workers and increased commuter traffic. Safety risks for \nthe communities along the road are also expected to increase with higher concentrations of \npedestrians near stations. The HIV/AIDS risk will be addressed through HIV/AIDS and human \ntrafficking awareness and prevention and community awareness programs, with civil works \ncontracts incorporating provisions and budgets for these programs. \n28.  Effective gender mainstreaming will ensure that the effectiveness and sustainability of \nthe MRT system is maximized. The gender action plan includes (i) employment targets for \nwomen  and  gender-specific  labor  standards  for  contracts  and  employment  generation;  (ii) \nconsideration  of  gender-inclusive  design  features  in  infrastructure;  (iii)  targets  for  women's \n                                                \n16  Fare revenue divided by O&M cost. \n ", "9 \nparticipation and the inclusion of gender-related content in capacity building; and (iv) mitigating \ngender-related impacts from resettlement and under the HIV/AIDS program. \nE.  Safeguards \n29.  No major environmental impacts are anticipated from the implementation of project 1, \nwhich is environment category B. An initial environmental examination (IEE) was prepared \nbased on ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). Public consultations involving affected \npeople were conducted during IEE preparation in compliance with ADB information disclosure \nand  consultation  requirements.  To  ensure  that  the  project  accords  with  the  environmental \nmanagement plan, MAUR will include the plan in bidding documents for civil works contracts. \nConsultants will assist MAUR in monitoring the environmental performance of contractors. An \nenvironmental assessment and review framework that specifies the requirements for screening, \ncategorization,  environmental  assessment,  and  the  preparation  and  implementation  of \nsafeguard plans for project 2 has been agreed by the HCMC People\u2019s Committee. \n \n30.  A resettlement framework sets out the screening, policy, and planning procedures that \nthe HCMC People\u2019s Committee will follow when preparing a resettlement plan for the project 2 \nmain line and due diligence for remaining depot area. project 1 is category B for involuntary \nresettlement and category C for indigenous peoples. For project 1, a corrective action plan was \nprepared for the nine households affected by land acquisition at the depot priority area. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n31.  The investment program will have several implementation risks, as it involves complex \ndesign standards with multiple interfaces and difficult construction techniques, especially in \nunderground sections. The risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5. \n  \nTable 5: Summary Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInadequate public transport policies  The HCMC People\u2019s Committee to (i) expedite analysis \nbecause of (i) a  lack of public support for  and approve implementing rules and (ii) support the \neffective policies to support a modal shift  implementation of policy measures with CTF financing  \nand (ii) poor enforcement of regulations \nPublic transport systems not integrated  The CTF project to design and implement key measures \nbecause (i) measures are implemented   \nineffectively and (ii) the fare pricing  Demand forecasting and pricing policy determined through \nstructure is not affordable  study under project 1. \nFailure to maintain the MRT2 system once  Consultants to support O&M planning and implementation \noperational    \nHCMC  People\u2019s  Committee  to  assure  adequate  O&M \nfunds \nCost increase and complexity delays  International experts to support project management \n \nDesign auditing and value analysis of detailed design \nLand acquisition delays for project 2  Full consultation and participation of potentially affected \n  people to ensure agreed and acceptable solutions \nCTF = Clean Technology Fund, MRT = mass rapid transit, O&M = operation and maintenance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n ", "10 \n32.  Financial  sustainability  issues  and  policy  reform  present  further  risks  that  require \nmitigation. Public financial management and procurement is the greatest risk during project \nimplementation.  Safeguard  issues  pose  some  risk  for  project  2,  as  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement is required for all underground station construction.17 The key risk that the MRT \nsystem is not integrated with the public transport system is mitigated through CTF financing of \nmeasures to address it. The viability of the investment program relies heavily on achieving the \nestimated patronage. The HCMC  People\u2019s Committee is responsible for ensuring that bus \ntransport is significantly developed before the operation of the MRT lines and for implementing \npolicy changes to encourage the use of public transport over private vehicles. Benefits and \npositive impacts are expected to outweigh any mitigation costs. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n33.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the investment program shall \nconform to ADB's mandatory policies on anticorruption, safeguards, procurement, consulting \nservices,  disclosure,  and  disbursement,  which includes  the  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date), Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), Public Communications Policy (2005), \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time), Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time), and Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, \nas amended from time to time). The detailed implementation arrangements are set forth in the \nFAM. The government has given ADB certain undertakings for the MFF, which are set forth in \nthe framework financing facility. Specific covenants agreed by the government with respect to \nindividual tranches under the MFF are set forth in the loan agreements.  \n \n34.  KfW and the European Investment Bank have agreed to comply with ADB Safeguard \nPolicy Statement requirements for all components financed under the investment program. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n35.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the provision of loans under the multitranche financing facility in an aggregate principal \namount not exceeding $540,000,000 to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Ho Chi Minh \nCity  Urban  Mass  Rapid  Transit  Line  2  Investment  Program  from  ADB's  ordinary  capital \nresources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB's London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the framework financing agreement presented to the Board.  \n \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n \n19 November 2010\n                                                \n17 Stations are constructed using cut and cover, so land has to be cleared of buildings, utilities, and other features. \n ", "  Appendix 1  1111  \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nPerformance Targets \nand Indicators with  Data Sources and  Assumptions  \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms   and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \n     \nContinued strong growth in \nAn integrated,  Public transport  Government statistical \nViet Nam and regional \nsustainable public  percentage share  publications by district  \neconomies \ntransport system in six  increased from 5% in \nPost-evaluation reports \ndistricts of Ho Chi Minh  2008 to 30% by 2025  Risks \nCity \nImplementation of other \nplanned MRT lines delayed \nLower priority for climate \nchange mitigation and \nadaptation \nOutcome      Assumptions \nCompetitive MRT  173,800 daily loadings \nGovernment and public  Government resources are \nservices along the  and 8,500 per direction \ntransport operator  allocated for MRT2 O&M \nproject corridor  peak loading on MRT2 \nstatistics \nby 2018   Sustainable transport \nGovernment traffic surveys  initiatives implemented and \nReduced weighted \nand accident and hospital  acceptance of public \naverage travel time \nrecords  transport modes \nalong MRT2 corridor by \n20% from 2010 level by  Independent public opinion  Risks \n2018  survey \nPolicy and regulatory \nNon-MRT public  Benefit monitoring reports  reforms to support modal \ntransport capacity  shift not enacted in a timely \nMonitoring reports from \nincreased by 100% in  way \nCTF-funded project \nproject districts by 2018 \nIntegrated services not \nfrom 2010 level   \nplanned, implemented, or \nNumber of traffic  operated efficiently \naccidents down from \nPublic transport services not \ntrend by 30% by 2018 \nfinancially sustainable \nfrom 2010 level \nOutputs      Assumption \nProject 1   \nProgress reports  Government demonstrates \n1.
