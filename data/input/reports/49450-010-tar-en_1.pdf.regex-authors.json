The proposed regional transaction TA will provide capacity building and policy advice support \nto a series of ongoing and ensuing projects, comprising projects included in the indicative project \npipeline  under  the  Pacific  Renewable  Energy  Investment  Facility1 (the  \u201cFacility\u201d),  and  other \ninvestment projects in energy planned or proposed in COBPs of PARD DMCs. This transaction TA \nis not, in and of itself, included in any country\u2019s COBP; it is complementary to operations included in \nsuch COBPs. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Justification \n2.  The proposed regional transaction TA will support the sustainability of energy investments \nthroughout the Pacific, including projects to be implemented under the Pacific Renewable Energy \nInvestment Facility (\u201cthe Facility\u201d) and financed by ADB or other sources.  \n \n3.  The Facility was approved on 22 June 2017 for up to $200 million to finance a series of \nindividual small-value renewable energy projects in the 11 smaller Pacific island countries (PIC-11), \nand support regional approaches for energy sector reform, private sector development, and capacity \nbuilding. \n \n4.  The proposed regional transaction TA will support sector reform, private sector development, \nand capacity building in the PIC-11 countries, as well as in countries other than those covered by \nthe Facility (i.e. non-PIC-11 countries - Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and Timor-Leste). \n \n5.  The proposed regional TA is designed to allow for streamlined consultant selection and \nmobilization, as per Staff Instructions on Business Processes for Transaction Technical Assistance, \nand will be financed from available resources, including from a grant from the Green Climate Fund \napproved for $5 million on 15 December 2016 for these purposes, and administered by ADB. The \nproposed regional transaction TA will prepare utility reform and capacity building action plans \n(programs) whose implementation will be financed under ensuing capital investment grants or loans \nin countries covered under the Facility, or processed separately per customary procedures in \ncountries not covered by the Facility. \n \n6.  The provision of adequate electricity service is crucial for ADB\u2019s poverty reduction mandate: \neconomic growth, public health, and general quality of life of our developing member countries\u2019 \n(DMCs\u2019) populations depends on it. Performance of electric utilities in the Pacific varies greatly from \ncountry to country: service is almost universally available in some countries with highly-concentrated \npopulations (e.g. Nauru, Palau, Samoa), while in other countries, service is available in only a few \nmajor urban centers accounting for a small percentage of the total population (e.g. Papua New \nGuinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu). Despite this variation in service availability, most Pacific DMC \nelectric utilities share several common features: (i) their financial and operational performance \ngenerally  fails  to  provide  for  efficient  and  sustainable  service  provision;  (ii)  they  represent  a \nsignificant and recurrent drain on the public purse or have otherwise significant welfare-diminishing \neffects due to highly distortionary subsidy and tariff-formation practices; (iii) their legal, policy, and \nregulatory environments fail to provide adequate stimulus for sector performance improvements and \ninvestments (especially from prospective private-sector partners). \n                                                \n1 https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/reg-49450-004-rrp \n \n ", "2 \n \n7.  With the exception of Fiji, Pacific DMCs remain heavily dependent on diesel for power \ngeneration, which results in high electricity tariffs by international standards with associated negative \nimpacts on economic growth. Expansion of capital-intensive renewable power generation is slow. \nAn overreliance on imported diesel for power generation depletes limited foreign reserves and \nexposes the region\u2019s economies to diesel price shocks. High electricity tariffs increase the cost of \nbusiness for the private sector and place a strain on household incomes. Although renewable power \ngeneration is cost-competitive with diesel generation at current levels of penetration, investment \n(including from the private sector) is constrained by capacity barriers, a need for sector reform, a \nlack of financing options. \n \n8.  Despite many years of ADB\u2019s and other development partners\u2019 support for utility services in \nthe Pacific, service quality and reliability remains poor; in several countries, utility service remains \nunavailable to a significant portion of the population.2 Most utilities have not yet achieved their service \nquality or access objectives, let alone attained financial self-sufficiency. The causes are manifold, \nbut afflict most Pacific utilities similarly, albeit to varying degrees: governance arrangements and \nregulatory policy do not properly incentivize management to achieve appropriate performance \ntargets; utilities are frequently abused as tools of social policy or to serve short-term political \nobjectives; financial management and accounting practices are not designed or practiced to achieve \nappropriate outcome targets; management authorities and functions within utilities are poorly defined \nand  often  fragmented;  utilities\u2019  workforces  are  insufficiently  trained,  supported,  equipped,  or \nincentivized to meet performance expectations, etc. \n \n9.  That is not to say that operational and financial sustainability have not been included among \nstated objectives of ADB\u2019s and other development partners\u2019 interventions. To the contrary, \u201ccapacity-\nbuilding\u201d is a nearly universal feature of our investment projects\u2019 designs, and most often included in \nthe scope of services that implementation consultants are tasked to perform. Typically, capacity-\nbuilding efforts are undertaken within the context of a discrete investment project\u2019s implementation, \nconsisting of the creation of systems and processes within a project management unit (PMU) that is \nestablished explicitly for the purpose of supporting that project\u2019s implementation. It would appear that \nthe common premise for this approach has been that capacity-building within a PMU will catalyze \ncapacity-development and adoption of sound management practices throughout the utility. In other \nwords, the approach assumes that practices, systems, and processes created for the relevant \ninvestment project will be absorbed and adopted for the entire utility, and that the objectives of \nservice quality, availability, and sustainability will thus be achieved. Unfortunately, this has not been \nobserved. More often, assets financed by ADB or other development partners are absorbed into the \npartner  utilities\u2019  existing  dysfunctional  systems,  where  a  \u201cbuild-neglect-rebuild\u201d  approach  to \ninfrastructure services - the antithesis of sustainability - is common. \n \n10.  The persistent poor performance of our Pacific DMCs\u2019 electric utilities calls for a different \napproach  to  investment  in  sustainability.  Attempting  to  engender  better  performance  and  to \ntransform  utilities  through  project-specific  capacity  development,  or  through  incremental \nimprovements in discrete aspects of their operations and practices, does not appear to be working.  \nA  focused  and  holistic  approach  to  utility  reform  is  necessary  for  achievement  of  wholesale \ntransformation of our client utilities, achievement of service quality and availability objectives, and \ntheir long-term sustainability. \n \n                                                \n2  See the Pacific Power Association\u2019s 2013/2014 Fiscal Year Benchmarking Report of its member utilities\u2019 performance. \nThis includes reporting for utilities in Pacific DMCs, with the exception of Timor-Leste. \n ", "3 \n11.  Wholesale reform of our Pacific DMCs\u2019 utilities requires a programmatic approach tailored to \neach utility\u2019s needs. This must begin with a comprehensive diagnostic review of each client utility\u2019s \noperations and the environment in which the utility operates. Internal policies and practices (e.g. \nfinancial management and accounting, operational procedures, maintenance practices, customer \nbilling systems) as well as external factors (e.g. state-owned enterprise governance, regulation, and \nrelevant government policies) need to be thoroughly assessed and understood to determine how \ndeficiencies, gaps,  or  incongruence  in these and  related  areas  combine  to  impede  a  utility\u2019s \nperformance and achievement of sustainability. It is from here that bespoke reform action plans can \nbe designed for each utility. \n \n12.  Investment in utility reform and capacity building is crucial for our Pacific DMCs\u2019 ability to \nrealize their development objectives, in particular in an era of heightened sensitivity to energy \nsecurity and prioritization of transition to renewable energy sources. Mobilizing the significant \ninvestments required to effect this transition to capital-intensive renewable electricity generation \ndemands that utilities demonstrate capacity to efficiently operate and maintain their assets, and that \nthey are at once capable of operating in a financially responsible and sustainable manner, and that \nthe legal, policy, regulatory, and governance arrangements in which they operate allow them to do \nso. \n \n13.  Overall outcome. The proposed regional transaction TA will have the following overall \noutcome: energy security in targeted countries will be improved through the generation of lower-cost \nand  cleaner  energy  by  sustainable  power  utilities.  The  TA  will  facilitate  engagement  with \ngovernments and electric power utilities to assess policy and institutional barriers to efficient, \nsustainable sector operations and impediments to increased capital investment, including private \nsector investment. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities  \n14.  Output  1:  Comprehensive  assessment  of  utilities\u2019  operations  and  performance. \nConsultants will document and report on each utility\u2019s performance against accepted industry-\nstandard metrics and indicators, such as: SAIDI, SAIFI, CAIDI,3 system load factor, energy losses, \nrevenue per kWh (disaggregated by customer class), debt to total assets ratio, operating and current \nratios, debt service coverage ratio, and appropriate labor productivity metrics. (Other indicators and \nmetrics may be identified as appropriate and informative, and can be included.) \n \n15.  Output  2:  Review  of  utilities\u2019  business  processes,  systems,  and  management \npractices. This will include review of utilities\u2019 financial management and accounting, customer \ninformation and billing systems, budget formulation and execution, asset-management systems and \nmaintenance practices, and customer service policies and practices. The review will also examine \nhigher-level  institutional  efficiencies,  including organizational  structure,  management  hierarchy, \ndecision-making  processes,  human  resource  policies  and  procedures,  and  the  management \ninformation system(s) underpinning these processes across the organization. \n \n16.  Output 3: Review of policy, regulatory, and governance arrangements.  Consultants will \nreview  coherence  of  energy-sector  policies  and  their  alignment  with  countries\u2019  energy  sector \ndevelopment and energy security objectives. Sector regulatory arrangements - in law, policy, and in \npractice \u2013 will be similarly assessed, including as these relate to tariff-setting policies and procedures \n                                                \n3  SAIDI, SAIFI, and CAIDI are indexes that measure electric power utility service reliability. (SAIDI is the system average \ninterruption duration index; SAIFI is the system average interruption frequency index; and CAIDI is the customer average \ninterruption duration index.)  \n ", "4 \nand rate design. Corporate governance arrangements for utilities will also be assessed for their \neffectiveness in providing utilities\u2019 managements with resources and incentives for development and \nsustainable operation of power utilities consistent with sector policy objectives and applicable legal \nand  regulatory  requirements. The  Organization for  Economic  Cooperation  and  Development\u2019s \n(OECD) Guidelines on Corporate Governance for State-Owned Enterprises will be used as a \ntouchstone for these assessments. \n \n17.  Output 4: Reform recommendations and policy dialogue. Based on the foregoing reviews, \nconsultants will prepare comprehensive recommendations and action plans to inform policy dialogue \nwith governments, as well as the design of consulting services to support the prescribed reforms, to \nbe included as part of ensuing capital investment projects developed under the Facility, or other \ninvestment projects in the DMCs\u2019 COBPs. \n \n18.  Output 5: Coordination on reform among regional peers. Consultants will employ a \nconsistent approach across countries covered under the proposed regional transaction TA.  This will \nenable coordination and cross-learning among utilities across the region, as well as among other \ndevelopment  partners.  Consultants  will  coordinate  with  the  Pacific  Power  Association  in \ndisseminating lessons learned among utilities within the region. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $5 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by the Green \nClimate Fund and administered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. \n \n20.  Proceeds  from  the  grant  from  the  Green  Climate  Fund  may  not  be  used  for  project \npreparation activities such as feasibility studies, environmental and social safeguards documents, \nfinancial modeling, and other related activities that are eligible for the GCF Project Preparation \nFacility.  The grant will only be used as a means to strengthen capacity building and sector reform.4 \nProceeds from the grant may only be used for assistance to countries that have signed a no-objection \nletter to the program of support approved by the GCF board under which the grant was made, in a \nform acceptable to the GCF. \n \n21.  Governments are expected to provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff and \nother in-kind contributions. Governments are informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB \nto finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  The TA activities for an ensuing project start only after the project concept paper on such \nensuing project is approved by ADB, and only after submission by the relevant country\u2019s government \nof a no-objection letter, satisfactory in form and substance to the Green Climate Fund, indicating the \ncountry\u2019s acceptance of grant support from Green Climate Fund for the purposes described herein.  \nDeployment of consultants will generally be scheduled and agreed in parallel with preparation of the \nrelevant ensuing investment project concept paper (or equivalent under the Facility).
