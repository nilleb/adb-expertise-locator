The  higher-than-\nestimated  costs  have  mainly  resulted  from  unexpected  geological  conditions  found  during \nexcavation works for underground facilities. The overrun will not change the scope of the project \nand  is  relatively  small  in  relation  to  the  original  cost  estimate.  The  financial  and  economic \nviability of the component remains viable despite the overrun. There are no outstanding or new \nsafeguards issues.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe Green Power Development Project has two components: the Dagachhu hydropower \nplant,  and  a  rural  electrification  program.  Now  nearing  completion,  the  run-of-river  generation \nplant will have an installed capacity of 126 megawatts (MW), and its output will be exported to \nIndia  through  an  existing  cross-border  grid  network.2 The  electrification  investment  has  been \ncompleted  and  provides  electricity  to  8,886  households  and  public  institutions  in  remote  rural \nareas by extending an existing grid and through the use of off-grid solar home systems.3  \n \nThe  Dagachhu  hydropower  development  is  the  first  public\u2013private  partnership  in  the \n4. \nBhutan\u2019s  infrastructure  sector.  The  private  partner  is  the  Tata  Power  Company,  one  of  India\u2019s \npremier companies. Its subsidiary, the Tata Power Trading Company, will be the offtaker for the \nplant\u2019s electricity. The government\u2019s investment has been channeled through its national utility, \nthe Druk Green Power Corporation (DGPC). The new assets have been placed under a special \npurpose  company\u2014the  Dagachhu  Hydro  Power  Corporation  (DHPC). The  government  and  its \npublic agencies own 74% of DHPC\u2019s shares.4 The project\u2019s rural electrification component was \nexecuted  by  another  national  utility,  the  Bhutan  Power  Corporation  (BPC),  and  the  Ministry  of \nEconomic Affairs.5 \n \n5. \nThe  remaining  Dagachhu  plant  construction  work  will  be  physically  completed  by  the \noriginal  loan  closing  date  of  31  December  2013.  About  95%  of  the  work  is  done.6 More  than \n98%  of  the  overall  finance  extended  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  been \ndisbursed, except for a small amount set aside for interest during construction.  \n \n\n                                                \n1  ADB.  2008.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loans,  Asian \nDevelopment Fund Grant, Technical Assistance Grant, and Administration of Grant to the Kingdom of Bhutan for \nthe Green Power Development Project. Manila. \n\n2   The Dagachhu hydropower plant is in southwestern Bhutan and 20 kilometers (km) from the border with India. \n3   The rural electrification component has achieved the target within the planned cost and timeframe. \n4  The project\u2019s shares are held by DGPC (59%), the National Pension and Provident Fund of Bhutan (15%), and the \n\nTata Power Company (26%).   \n\n5  BPC is mainly responsible for transmission and distribution while DGPC looks after generation. The off-grid rural \n\nelectrification was carried out by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.  \n\n6  The main works outstanding are (i) 0.3 km of tunnel excavation (out of 11 km in total), and (ii) overall aligning. The \nremaining  rock  conditions  in  the  tunnel  are  good.  The  electromechanical  equipment  has  been  installed  in  an \nunderground powerhouse. The transmission line is ready to evacuate power. \n\n \n\n\fThe  original  project  cost  was  $234.5  million.  ADB  provided  and  administered  $106.3 \n6. \nmillion under the financing plan (Table 1). The hydropower plant cost was estimated at $201.5 \nmillion,  $80.0  million  of  which  was  to  be  provided  by  ADB  in  (i)  a  $29.0  million  loan  from  the \nhard-term  facility  of  the  Asian  Development  Fund,  and  (ii)  a  $51.0  million  loan  from  ordinary \ncapital  resources.  The  project  received  cofinancing  from  an  Austrian  commercial  bank\u2014\noperating under the Austrian export credit agency (OeKB)\u2014and Bhutan\u2019s National Pension and \nProvident Fund (NPPF). The balance has been mobilized as equities from the government and \nproject sponsors including DGPC, NPPF, and the Tata Power Company. \n \n\nTable 1: Original Financing Plan   \n($ million) \n\n  \nSource \nA.

DHPC later signed a certified \nemissions  reduction  purchase  agreement  with  ADB,  which  acts  as  a  trustee  of  the  Future \nCarbon Fund, to sell carbon credits generated from the Dagachhu plant.   \n \n8. \nThe  project  was  classified  as  safeguard  category  B  for  environment  and  resettlement \nand category C for indigenous peoples. No households were relocated for the plant component \nbut  25  were  compensated  for  partial  loss  of  land  for  the  construction  of  access  roads.  All \nenvironmental  safeguards  have  been  complied  with  in  full.  The  cost  overrun  raises  no  new \nsafeguard issues.  \n \nThe  plant\u2019s  planned  capacity  was  optimized  from  114  MW  to  126  MW.7 The  bid  prices \n9. \nfor  the  equipment  were  20%  higher  than  the  estimates,  but  this  extra  cost  was  financed  by \nproportionate  additional  equity  investments  by  the  project  sponsors.8 All  civil  work  costs  fell \nwithin  the  original  estimate.  However,  the  underground  tunneling  excavations  required  extra \nreinforcement due to unexpected poor geological conditions, which raised the cost of the works \nover  time.9 The  civil  work  costs  were  also  increased  by  large  escalations  in  the  labor  and \n\n                                                \n7  This optimization improved generation efficiency but did not change actual output substantially.  \n8  The 20% cost increase was over the original base cost plus contingencies.  \n9  Bad  rock  conditions  led  to  extra  costs.  As  a  result,  the  contractor  was  allowed  to  raise  unit  rates.  Contract \n\nvariations were also required for extra reinforcement.  \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fmaterial prices.10 The two factors combined raised the overall cost estimates for the Dagachhu \nplant  by  16.6%.11 In  spite  of  these  cost  increases,  the  project  remains  technically  sound  and \nfinancially  and  economically  viable.  The  sponsors  are  fully  satisfied  with  the  technical \nperformance of the contractors.12   \n \n10. \nConstruction  of  the  Dagachhu  plant  is  near  completion.  The  overall  project  has  been \nperforming well and is rated satisfactory on the ADB project performance rating system. It meets \nthe standard performance criteria of (i) expected output delivery; (ii) satisfactory implementation \nprogress;  (iii)  satisfactory  compliance  with  safeguard  requirements;  (iv)  successful  risk \nmanagement for  implementation;  and (v)  an  on-track  rating  in  terms  of  technical  performance, \ncontract awards, disbursements, financial management, and safeguard compliance.13 \n \nThe  government  is  requesting  additional  financing  from  ADB  to  complete  the  project. \n11. \nThe government  sees  the  Dagachhu  hydropower  development  as  a  high national  priority. The \nproject  has  been  implemented  along  with  its  Sustainable  Hydropower  Policy,  2008,  which \nintroduced  private  sector  investment  in  hydropower  development  in  Bhutan  for  the  first  time. \nADB  is  also  helping  the  government  prepare  a  second  public\u2013private  partnership  project  to \ngenerate hydropower for export as a follow-up to the Dagachhu project.14 The government thus \naims  to  accelerate  power  exports  through  both  public  and  private  investments.  Based  on  an \numbrella agreement between Bhutan and India, an additional 10,000 MW of hydropower is to be \ndeveloped  and  exported  by  Bhutan  by  2020.15 Bhutan  now  exports  70%  of  the  electricity  it \ngenerates to India, and the power sector is the largest source of both government revenue and \ngross domestic product.16 Hydropower is the backbone of Bhutan\u2019s economy.   \n \nB. \n \n12. \nThe  impact  will  be  sustained  inclusive  economic  growth  through  cross-border  power \ntrade  and  domestic  electricity  access.  The  outcome  will  be  expanded  coverage  of  sustainable \nclean power supply.17 \n\nImpact and Outcome  \n\n \nOutputs  \n\nC. \n \nThe outputs of the Green Power Development Project will be (i) constructed hydropower \n13. \nplant;  (ii)  extended  rural  electrification;  and  (iii)  improved  DGPC  management  systems.  The \nDagachhu hydropower plant is expected to be commissioned in 2014 after construction work is \ncompleted  within  2013.  The  intended  rural  electrification  output  has  already  been  achieved \n(para.  3).  DGPC  management  systems  have  been  improved  as  a  result  of  capacity \ndevelopment technical assistance attached to the project.       \n\n                                                \n10 The unit prices of labor, cement, steel, and fuel were adjusted on the basis of a price adjustment formula under the \n\ncontract because prices for these commodities increased due to inflation over the period.   \n11 Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n12 There  are  two  contractors:  (i)  India\u2019s  Hindustan  Construction  Company  for  civil  works,  and  (ii)  an  Austrian \n\nconsortium of Alstom and Andritz for electromechanical equipment.      \n\n13 Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 ADB. 2011.

Three  mega \nhydropower  projects  with  overall  capacity  of  about  3,000  MW  are  under  construction  under  the  umbrella \nagreement.  \n\n16 The power sector has contributed 30%\u201340% of annual government revenue since 2008.

The executing agency is DGPC, and the implementing agency is DHPC. As the special \npurpose project company, DHPC is fully staffed and functional.  \n \nThe additional financing will be used for extra costs of the existing Dagachhu civil works \n18. \nprocured  under  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  Retroactive  financing  will  be  allowed  for  an \namount  not  exceeding  20%  of  the  additional  financing  loan  amount  for  the  civil  work  costs \nincurred  prior  to  loan  effectiveness  of  the  additional  financing  and  within  12  months  of  the \nsigning of the additional loan agreement.   \n \n19. \ntesting and commissioning.    \n \n20. \nthe project administration manual.21   \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \n\nThe  Dagachhu  hydropower  plant  is  expected  to  be  in  full  operation  in  April  2014  after \n\n                                                \n20 This rate is determined on the prevailing local financial market conditions. \n21  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fAspects  \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n\nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nOctober 2012\u2013December 2013a \n31 December 2013 \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  Dagachhu Hydro Power Corporation \n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nMinistry of Finance and Ministry of Economic Affairs \nDruk Green Power Corporation \n\nRetroactive financing  \n\nDisbursement  \n\nDagachhu Hydro Power Corporation (with 121 staff) \nThe existing civil work contract\u2019s expenditure will be for retroactive \nfinancing. \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon between the government and \nthe Asian Development Bank.  \n\na  Includes 12 months for the retroactive financing period prior to the loan effectiveness date. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nTo  reflect  the  increased  project  cost  in  the  tariff,  DHPC  agreed  to  revise  a  power \n21. \npurchase  agreement  (PPA)  with  the  offtaker.  DHPC  also  adopted  the  foreign  exchange \nfluctuation reserve fund to mitigate the currency exchange risk of foreign debt repayment.22  \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical  \n\nThe generators have been installed in the plant\u2019s underground powerhouse, and 19 km \n22. \nof  220  kV  transmission  lines  from  the  plant  are  completed  and ready  to  evacuate  power.  The \nmajor  remaining  work  is  tunnel  excavation,  although  it  involves  only  0.3 km  of  the  11 km  total \nworks.23 The  assessment  of  an  ADB  project  site  technical  inspection  was  that  this  would  be \ncompleted  before  the  loan  closing  date  of  31  December  2013.  DHPC  intends  to  operate  the \nplant at full generation capacity in the second quarter of 2014, when the next rainy season starts. \nSince Dagachhu will be the country\u2019s fifth major hydropower plant, the staff of DGPC and DHPC \nare  experienced  in  plant  operations.  The  project  construction  designs  and  operations  are \ntechnically sound.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nThe  PPA  base tariff  was  increased  from  Rs2.4  per  kilowatt-hour  to  Rs2.9  per  kilowatt-\n23. \nhour on a cost-plus basis (para. 21). The conservative financial internal rate of return adjusted \nfor  higher  tariffs  and  costs  is  2.61%,  higher  than  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital.24 The \neconomic  adjusted  internal  rate  of  return  is  16.04%,  and  the  Bhutan\u2013India  subregional \n\n                                                \n22 The  power  sales  are  priced  in  Indian  rupees.  To  mitigate  the  foreign  currency  exchange  risk  during  the  loan \nrepayment  period,  part  of  DHPC  profits  and  losses  arising  out  of  the  foreign  exchange  rate  fluctuation  will  be \nreserved in a separate account every year.  \n\n23 This is the status as of 31 July 2013. The excavation work progressed by 0.9 km over 5 months during March\u2013July \n2013. The tunneling works and geological investigation have been supported by experienced resident international \nconsultants under the technical assistance provided by Austria.  \n\n24 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The financial internal rate of return \n(FIRR) and the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) are calculated in real terms on an after-tax basis. WACC \nis  estimated  at  1.60%  in  real  terms.  In  nominal  terms,  FIRR  is  8.17%,  compared  with  a WACC  of  7.29%  (FIRR \nestimated under the original loans was 10.44% in nominal terms). \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\feconomic  internal  rate  of  return  with  the  adjustments  is  22.57%.25 These  results  exceed  the \nhurdle  rates  by  margins  sufficient  to  substantiate  the  project\u2019s  financial  and  economic \nsustainability with the additional financing. \n \n24. \nClimate  change  modeling  analysis  has  suggested  hydrological  increases  in  the  project \narea  for  the  future,  which  would  enable  the  plant  to  increase  annual  generation  output  (para. \n32). The revised PPA includes profit-sharing mechanisms to sell electricity in the India\u2019s power \ntrading market at higher rates. These scenarios will increase the power sales, and improve the \nDagachhu  plant\u2019s financial  and  economic  performance.  Even  under  several  negative  business \nscenarios  considered,  DHPC  will  maintain  the  covenanted  debt  service  coverage  ratio  of  1.2. \nThe additional financing will increase DHPC\u2019s financial leverage where the debt\u2013equity ratio will \nrise from 60:40 to 66:34.  \n\n \nGovernance \n\nC. \n\n25. \nThe ADB capacity development technical assistance provided under the original project \nwas successfully implemented and achieved institutional improvements. As a result, DGPC and \nDHPC  adopted  comprehensive  corporate  policies  and  manuals  on  accounting  and  financial \nmanagement,  inventory  and  procurement  management,  internal  audit,  human  resources,  and \nsafeguards. In 2011, these improvements were supported by management information systems \nprovided  through  an  enterprise  resources  system  package.  The  external  independent  auditor \nreported that these entities have adequate internal control systems, suitable budgetary systems, \nadequate  competitive  bidding,  and  sufficient  organizational  system  control  to  carry  out  their \noperations in an orderly and efficient manner. \n \n26. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government,  DGPC,  and DHPC. The  specific  policy  requirements  and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual. \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\n27. \nThe  project  site  is  in  Dagana  District,  a  remote  area.  During  implementation,  the \nDagachhu  development  has  greatly  improved  the  local  community\u2019s  access  to  many  services \nand opportunities. The following improvements have had a positive poverty and social impact in \nlocal communities:    \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nTransportation. To carry heavy machines and materials, the conditions of roads \nand bridges in the area were drastically improved. These benefits were realized \nearly  on  in  project  construction.  Better  connectivity  and  improved  physical \naccessibility  are  greatly  needed  in  Bhutan\u2019s  remote  communities  due  to  the \ndifficulties of travel in the country\u2019s mountainous terrain.  \nIt \nSocial  services.  DHPC  adopted \nconstructed  and  renovated  school  classrooms  and  provided  school  buses  for \nsafe student transport. It made clinic services available to local people for free.26 \nElectrification. Rural electrification was carried out in project area  communities \nalong  with  Dagachhu  plant\u2019s  construction.  BPC  extended  its  distribution  lines, \nwhich accelerated rural electrification in the project-affected areas and the district \noverall.  This  was  the  main  tangible  benefit  from  power  generation  development \n\nits  corporate  social  responsibilities. \n\n                                                \n25 Economic  Analysis  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2).  The  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn  was  estimated  at  13.80%  under  the  original  loans.  The  subregional  economic  internal  rate  of  return  was \n22.00% as well.  \n\n26 More than 1,600 local people had received the medical services as of February 2013.  \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f(iv) \n\nfor  local  people.  Most  of  households  in  the  project  areas  had  no  access  to \nelectricity previously or only limited access on off-grid solar lighting.27   \nCommercial  activities.  A  local  economic  boon  of  the  project  has  included \nemployment opportunities, rental income,  increased small business activity, and \nsales of farm products to project staff and workers. 28  \n\nSafeguards \n\n \n28. \nThe  original  project  aimed  to  sustain  the  country\u2019s  inclusive  economic  growth  by \npromoting cross-border power trade and access to domestic electricity access.29 Royalties from \nthe  project\u2019s  power  export  revenue  will  help  sustain  affordable  electricity  prices  for  rural \nhouseholds  through  a  clear  regulatory  framework.  The  power  exports  will  also  generate \nadditional government resources to promote socioeconomic development in rural areas.  \n \nE. \n \n29. \nThe cost overrun and additional financing will change neither the project\u2019s scope nor its \noriginal  safeguards  categorizations  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous \npeoples.  DHPC\u2019s  environmental  unit  has  provided  ADB  with  periodic  monitoring  and  updated \nreports on the implementation of safeguards.30 There are no outstanding safeguard issues.31 \n \n30. \nSocial  safeguards.  The project is classified as category B for involuntary resettlement \nand  C  for  indigenous  peoples.  In  June  2008,  DHPC  prepared  a  resettlement  plan.  The \nresettlement  activities  were  carried  out  under  this  plan  at  the  initial  stage  of  project \nimplementation  in  2008\u20132009,  before  the  construction  contract  award.  All  25  affected \nhouseholds who lost part of their land due to construction of plant access roads opted for land \nreplacement.32 Of  these  households,  20  also  received  cash  compensation  for  crop  losses  on \ntheir  land  at  fair  market  value. 33  There  are  no  outstanding  involuntary  resettlement  issues \nassociated with the additional financing.   \n \nEnvironmental  safeguards.  The  project\u2019s  environmental  category  is  B.  Based  on  an \n31. \ninitial  environmental  examination,  an  environmental  management  plan  has  appropriately  been \ncarried  out. 34  During  implementation,  DHPC  conducted  separate  studies  that  included  (i) \nadditional  fish  migration  monitoring;  (ii)  water,  soil,  and  air  quality  measurements;  and  (iii) \nappropriate  minimum  ecological  flow  assessment  based  on  more  data  on  seasonal  water \n                                                \n27 Almost 1,000 households in the project-affected areas were connected to the grid under BPC\u2019s own program after \n\nthe Dagachhu project started.    \n\n28 The  Dagachhu  project  created  about  1,500  job  opportunities,  including  employment  for about  300  local  workers, \n\ndrivers, and helpers hired by DHPC and its contractors.   \n\n29 Summary  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social  Strategy  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2). \nWhile the original project had positive gender impacts through the rural electrification component, the project as a \nwhole needed no gender elements or specific gender measures beyond the core labor standard requirements.    \n30 DHPC  assigned  five  full-time  staff  to  the  unit.  ADB  provided  capacity  development  technical  assistance  to  train \n\nthem and develop the safeguard manuals.  \n\n31 Social  Safeguard  Compliance  Assessment  and  Environmental  Safeguard  Compliance  Assessment  (accessible \n\nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n32 The  affected  households  were  asked  to  choose  land  of  an  equivalent  size  and  similar  productivity  from \ngovernment-owned land to replace what the land they lost. In 2009, all had received ownership certificates for the \nreplacement lands. \n\n33 Cash  compensation  was  done  in  two  stages  in  May  and  September  2008.  Because  recent  market  data  for  crop \nand  tree  prices  were  lacking,  the  compensation  rates  were  revalued  by  the  government\u2019s  property  assessment \nvaluation authority. The resultant rates were 3\u20134 times higher than the previous rates. Bhutan has since based its \napproach to crop compensation in other projects on this practice.   \n\n34 A  team  of  environmental  experts  and  other  experts  from  ADB,  DGPC,  and  DHPC  visited  all  project construction \nsites in May 2013. Site rehabilitation, slope stabilization, and tree planting were in evidence at all the sites. Other \nenvironmental management was satisfactory and reflected the requirements of the environment management plan. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fquantity variation. Bhutan\u2019s National Environment Commission was also involved in the process. \nWhile there were no endangered or long-distance migratory fish in the Dagachhu River, DHPC \nadopted  construction  of  a  fish  ladder  to  help  maintain  the  native  ecosystem.  The  commission \nhas verified periodic assessments of water, soil, and air quality. The minimum ecological water \nwas  found  sufficient  to  aquatic  habitat  conditions. While  DHPC  continues monitoring  activities, \nthere are no existing or developing issues related to environmental safeguards. \n \n32. \nClimate  change  impacts.  Hydropower  resources  are  vulnerable  to  negative  climate \nchange  impacts.  Climate  change  modeling  analyses  were  undertaken  using  eight  climate \nmodels  from  various  organizations.  They  projected  long-term  water  flow  increases  in  the \nDagachhu  watershed  that  should  benefit  the  plant. 35  The  analysis  showed  the  Dagachhu \nhydropower plant to be hydrologically sound and its adaptation design to be effective. The plant \nfaces low technical, financial, social, and environmental risks from climate change. It will have a \npositive  climate  change  impact  under  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism,  eliminating  the \n500,000 tons of potential carbon dioxide emissions that would otherwise be produced each year \nin India by fossil fuels to generate the electricity it will provide for export from Bhutan.  \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nF. \n\n33. \nSince  the  Dagachhu  hydropower  plant  is  near  completion  and  adequate  mitigation \nmeasures have been built into the original design and implementation arrangements, the overall \nproject risks are considered low. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table \n5 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.36  \n \n\nRisks \nConstruction \nrisk \n\nOperational \nrisk \n(management) \n\nOfftake risk \n\nClimate \nchange risk \n\nCurrency risk \n\nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe  major  work  outstanding  involves  only  a  short  distance  of  the  overall  tunnel \nexcavation  works.  The  work  has  been  progressing  steadily,  and  geological  conditions \nhave  been  assessed  as  manageable.  Experienced  international  geologist,  engineers, \nand contractors are on site.     \nThe  plant\u2019s  run-of-river  hydropower  operations  are  straightforward.  DGPC  staff  with \nexperience  operating  existing  hydropower  plants  have  been  assigned  to  DHPC.  The \nprivate  development  partner  (Tata  Power  Company)  has  sufficient  experience  in \nimplementing and operating other hydropower projects.    \nA long-term PPA was signed with one of the leading power trading companies in India. \nThe  offtaker\u2019s  credit  risk  is  further  mitigated  in  the  PPA  by  an  adequate  payment \nsecurity mechanism.   \nClimate change modeling analysis assesses the Dagachhu watershed as hydrologically \nsound.  Sufficient  adaptation  measures  were  adopted  in  the  structures,  facilities,  and \nadjoining areas of the project to address such potential disasters as floods, landslides, \nand earthquakes.       \nDHPC  adopted  a  foreign  exchange  fluctuation  reserve  fund  to  mitigate  the  repayment \nrisk of foreign currency loans.  \n\nDGPC  =  Druk  Green  Power  Corporation,  DHPC  =  Dagachhu  Hydro  Power  Corporation,  PPA  =  power  purchase \nagreement. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\n                                                \n35 Climate Change Risk Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). Under the climate \nchange modeling analysis, the  annual water flow in the Dagachhu watershed is projected to  increase by 1%\u20134% \nduring  the  non-monsoon  months  (November\u2013March)  and  by  10%\u201315%  during  the  monsoon  months  (June\u2013\nOctober) toward 2041\u20132060. \n\n36 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n34. \nThe  government,  DGPC,  and  DHPC  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the \nproject  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  and  disbursement  as  described  in  detail  in  the \nproject administration manual and loan documents. \n \n35. \nThe government, DGPC, and DHPC have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject, which are set forth in the loan and project agreements. A condition for the effectiveness \nof  the  additional  financing  will  be  that  the  subsidiary  loan  by  the  government  to  DHPC  is \nacceptable to ADB in form and substance.  \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n36. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR25,689,000 to the Kingdom of Bhutan for the additional financing of \nthe  Green  Power  Development  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds
