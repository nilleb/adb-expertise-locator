Viet  Nam\u2019s  rapid \neconomic  growth  has  been  impressive  between  1990  and  2010.  Official  development \nassistance  (ODA)  has  played  an  important  role  in  catalyzing  investments,  as  reflected  in  the \ngovernment\u2019s Socioeconomic Development Plan, 2011\u20132015, which states development targets \nand  highlights  the  importance  of  ODA  and  anticipated  increases  in  the  number,  size,  and \ncomplexity  of  investments.  From  2006 to  2010,  signed  ODA for  Viet  Nam  was  $20.26  billion.2 \nThis figure is expected to reach $32.00 billion in 2011\u20132015. \n \n4. \nAid  effectiveness  has  not  kept  pace  with  investment  growth.  Undisbursed  ODA  is  over \n$6 billion and expected to increase to over $10 billion by the end of 2015. As aid is channeled \nthrough  ODA-funded  programs  and  projects,  effectiveness  is  measured  in  terms  of  how  well \nprograms  and  projects  are  implemented,  the  time  required  for  completion,  and  impacts  on \nbeneficiaries.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  track  record  has  been  mixed.  In  general,  ADB  and  development \npartners\u2019  project  evaluation  reports  show  projects  completed  satisfactorily.  The  same  reports \nindicate  poor  project  performance  during  implementation  caused  by,  among  other  problems, \ndelayed project preparation and start-up. Delays cause unnecessary implementation difficulties, \nincrease  transactional  costs  and  postpone  development  benefits  to  the  project  beneficiaries, \nreducing  aid  effectiveness  and  investment  efficiency.  ADB\u2019s  country  assistance  program \nevaluation  (CAPE),3 for  the  period  2001-2008,  directly  fed  into  the  preparation  of  the  country \npartnership  strategy  (CPS)  2012\u20132015. 4  The  CAPE  study  highlighted  \u201cimproving  portfolio \nperformance\u201d,  as  one  of  the  major  issue  for  future  assistance.  Also,  ADB\u2019s  Sector  Assistance \nEvaluation Programs5 highlight the need for additional resources to improve the project design \nand fast track project implementation. ADB\u2019s Viet Nam country portfolio review found that 12\u201318 \nmonths on average separate fact-finding from loan effectiveness, with an additional 2 years for \nproject  start-up  and  the  first  contract  award,  and  that  loan  extensions  add  another  2  years.6 \nComparisons across development partners show portfolio performance indicators for Viet Nam \nto be worse than those of comparable countries in Asia.  \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  According  to  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment,  during  2006\u20132010,  committed  ODA  was  $31.76  billion, \n\nsigned ODA $20.26 billion, and actual disbursement $13.86 billion. \n\n3   ADB. 2009.

Ha Noi (joint paper by the 6 Banks Group: ADB, Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, \nJapan International Cooperation Agency, Export\u2013Import Bank of [the Republic of] Korea, KfW Development Bank, \nand World Bank). \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nDevelopment  partners  and  the  government  realize  the  importance  of  addressing \n5. \nimplementation bottlenecks, including improving the effective utilization of ODA for projects. The \nODA  Inter-Ministerial  Task  Force,  established  in  2004,  conducts  annual  reviews  of  ODA \nutilization in coordination  with  development  partners  including  ADB  and  produces  action  plans \nto  improve  ODA  and  its  use.  Decree  131/2006/ND-CP  on  delegated  management  of  ODA-\nfunded  projects,  currently  undergoing  revision,  is  intended  to  improve  the  utilization  of  ODA \nresources  and  define  the  responsibilities  of  stakeholders  in  Viet  Nam.  The  Aid  Effectiveness \nForum brings together government agencies and development partners for dialogue on various \nimpact  assessment,  and \nimpact  assessment,  environmental \nthemes,  such  as  social \nprocurement,  to  narrow  gaps  between  government  procedures  and  international  practices. \nHowever,  these  initiatives  need  supplemental  concrete  actions  to  address  implementation \ndelays  arising  from  inadequate  project  preparation  and  project  readiness,  the  lack  of  effective \nmechanisms  to  fast-track  project  start-up,  and  the  limited  capacity  of  counterpart  staff  to \nadminister  projects  and  manage  implementation.  This  analysis  is  consistent  with  various \nportfolio performance reviews on Viet Nam (footnote 3), which have identified several underlying \ntechnical, institutional, and financial constraints that hinder smooth project preparation, start-up, \nand implementation. \n \n6. \nProject start-up. After loan negotiations are concluded and loan documents are signed, \nmost  project  management  units  are  reluctant  to  do  so  much  as  invite  expressions  of  interest \nfrom  consultants  until  the  loan  is  declared  effective,  even  where  advance  action7 has  been \napproved.8 In Viet Nam, the legal structure usually restricts any agency implementing an ODA-\nfunded project from spending counterpart funds until the loan is declared effective. On average, \nit takes 8 months to advance from loan signing to loan effectiveness, over 12 months to recruit \nconsultants,  and  18  months  to  get  from  loan  effectiveness  to  the  first  disbursement.  Start-up \ndelays can delay projects for 2\u20133 years. While the revision of Decree 131/2006/ND-CP will allow \nadvance action, the funding needed for advance action may still not be available.9  \n \nCapacity  issues.  Capacity  to  implement  projects  varies  at  in  the  central  government \n7. \nand  in  the  provinces.  In  many  cases,  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  do  not  have \nenough  experience  to  implement  ODA-funded  projects  well.  Even  those  with  experience  may \nlack capacity because of limited financial resources, technical skills, and ability to communicate \nwith development partners. \n \n8. \nThe government needs a facility that will adequately address the technical, institutional, \nand  financial  barriers  to  the  timely  start-up  of  ODA-funded  projects.  The  facility  will  allow \nselected  agencies  to  effectively  prepare  and  implement  ADB-financed  projects,  ensuring \neffective aid utilization. As this can be achieved only if adequate resources are frontloaded, the \nfacility  proposes  to  enable  (i)  better  preparation  of  investment  projects  by  providing  funds  for  \npreparing  feasibility  studies,  detailed  engineering  designs,  and  bidding  documents;  (ii)  quick \nproject  start-up;  (iii)  the  resolution  of  project  implementation  bottlenecks  caused  by  most \nexecuting  and  implementing  agencies\u2019  lack  of  capacity  on  safeguards  (conducting  baseline \nsurveys, updating resettlement plans and compensation plans, and incorporating environmental \nmanagement plans into the bidding documents), procurement (selecting the first consulting firm \nfor  detailed  design  and  supervision),  and  disbursement  (opening  imprest  accounts  and \n\n                                                \n7  Advance  action  is  undertaken  prior  to  loan  effectiveness  to  enable  quick  project  start-up:  initiating  consultant \nrecruitment,  advanced  procurement,  preparing  detailed  engineering  designs  and  bidding  documents,  and \nestablishing the project management unit. \n\n8  ADB. 2011.

The \nfacility  will  improve  project  performance,  enhance  the  quality  of  investments,  speed  up \ndisbursement, and ensure the timely realization of economic benefits. \n \nA  project  design  advance  to  a  borrowing  country  from  the  Project  Design  Facility \n9. \nsupports project formulation, encompassing detailed engineering design, feasibility studies, due \ndiligence,  and safeguard  and  pre-implementation  work  including  advance procurement  actions \nof up to $5 million.10  However, the government has no mechanism to fast-track the processing \nof a project design advance rather than as a loan. The facility intends to go beyond the Project \nDesign Facility by mobilizing funding after simple one-off approval from the Ministry of Planning \nand  Investment  (MPI),  the  executing  agency,  with  no  funding  restriction,  and  by  building \ncapacity  in  the  MPI  to  implement  the  facility  and  in  implementing  agencies  for  project \npreparation  and  advance  action,  including  recruiting  consultants  and  preparing  detailed \nengineering design and bidding documents. \n \n10. \nBy financing detailed engineering designs and bidding and other project documents, the \nfacility  will  accelerate  and  complete  project  preparation  beyond  what  a  typical  project \npreparatory technical assistance grant can accomplish. Indeed, the facility can be an alternative \nto  a  project  preparatory  technical  assistance,  financing  all  project  preparation  from  feasibility \nstudy to bidding documents. The facility is included in ADB\u2019s CPS, 2012\u20132015. \n \n11. \nLessons  from  previous  experience.  In  2010,  the  World  Bank  developed  the  Project \nPreparation  Technical  Assistance  Facility  (PPTAF).  The  PPTAF  supports  World  Bank-funded \nprojects  by  preparing  feasibility  studies,  detailed  designs,  and  bidding  documents  and  by \nproviding resources to speed up project preparation. Several issues were encountered early in \nits  implementation,  mostly  delays  caused  by  the  complicated  application  process  and  lack  of \ncapacity  in  implementing  agencies  to  prepare  and  process  applications.  ADB  is  coordinating \nwith the World Bank on the processing of the facility. Findings from the World Bank\u2019s experience \nhave  been  incorporated  into  the  design  of  the  facility,  which  will  (i)  provide  a  common  project \ncoordination  unit  (PCU)  at  the  MPI  for  the  facility  and  the  PPTAF;  (ii)  recruit  individual \nconsultants rather than a firm for capacity development; (iii) simplify the application form and the \napproval process from 3 steps to 1-step approval by the MPI; and (iv) identify projects early, at \nCPS or during the country programming missions, for possible financing under the facility. \n \nB. \n \nThe impact of the facility will be improved aid effectiveness in Viet Nam. Its outcome will \n12. \nbe  strengthened  capacity  in  the  government  to  fast-track  the  preparation,  start-up,  and \nimplementation of ADB-financed projects in Viet Nam. \n \nC. \n \n13. \nOutput  1:  Production  of  high-quality  project  documents  and  actions  to  fast-track \nproject start-up.

A  PCU  will  be \nestablished under MPI to undertake day-to-day activities. Selected line ministries and provincial \nand city peoples\u2019 committees eligible under Decree 131/2006 will be the implementing agencies \nfor subprojects. \n \nInternational and national consultants specializing in project management will assist the \n19. \nPCU  in  (i)  processing  subproject  proposals  and  applications,  (ii)  ensuring  quality  control,  (iii) \ndeveloping  capacity  in  the  MPI  and  the  implementing  agencies;  and  (iv)  providing  other \nadministrative  support  as  required  by  the  MPI.  The  facility  will  finance  PCU  costs  for  annual \nindependent  audits,  office  equipment,  and  workshops  and  site  visits  while  preparing  or \nimplementing subprojects. ADB will meet at least quarterly with the World Bank and the MPI to \ncoordinate, review issues, and improve the implementation of the facility. \n \nInternational and national individual consultants will be recruited to build the capacity of \n20. \nthe MPI and implementing agencies to prepare and appraise public investments. Audit will be by \na firm selected either by consultant qualification selection or least cost. Consultants required to \nassist implementing agencies in preparing subprojects will be recruited as firms, individuals, or a \ncombination of both. Quality- and cost-based selection at a ratio of 80:20 will be the preferred \nmethod  for  selecting  firms.  Depending  on  the  scope,  nature,  and  value  of  a  particular \nassignment,  implementing  agencies  may,  with  ADB's  prior  approval,  adopt  other  selection \nmethods outlined in ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time \nto time), based on consultant qualification, fixed budget, least cost, or quality. \n \n21. \nTo  be  eligible  for  financing  under  the  facility,  a  subproject  must  be  (i)  included  in  the \nproject pipeline of the CPS or country operations business plan; (ii) a high government priority; \nor (iii) agreed upon by the MPI and ADB during the country programming mission, the country \nprogramming  confirmation  mission,  or  the  country  portfolio  review  mission.  The  implementing \nagency  proposing  a  subproject  will  work  closely  with  the  team  processing  it  (the  subproject \nteam)  to  determine  its  outputs,  activities,  and  budget.  The  time  for  completing  subproject \npreparation will be limited to 3 years. Justification and approval from the MPI will be required for \nany time extension to complete subproject tasks financed under the facility. \n \n22. \nThe  implementing  agencies  will  implement  subprojects  through  project  implementation \nunits  (PIUs).  Each  PIU  will  be  responsible  for  the  (i)  timely  submission  of  the  subproject \nproposal  and  application  to  the  PCU  for  financing  under  the  facility;  (ii)  procurement  of \nconsulting  services  for  the  subproject  preparation  and  implementation,  including  consultant \ncontract  management;  and  (iii)  processing  of  subsequent  investment  loan  for  the  subproject. \nEach  PIU  will  liaise  with  the  PCU  under  the  MPI  and  with  the  subproject  team  to  finalize \nsubproject  preparation  and  advance  action.  The  PIU  will  ensure  that  deliverables  financed \nunder  the  facility  conform  with  government  and  ADB  policies  and  guidelines,  including \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement. \n \n23. \nADB  will  work  closely  with  the  MPI  and  the  implementing  agencies  to  implement  the \nfacility. The ADB team, responsible for implementation of the facility (facility team), will support \nand supervise the MPI\u2019s execution of the facility by (i) exercising no objection to all consultant \nrecruitment  and  procurement  managed  by  the  MPI,  (ii)  ensuring  that  implementation  complies \nwith fiduciary requirements, and (iii) monitoring and evaluating the portfolio of subprojects. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n24. \nThe subproject team will collaborate with the implementing agencies and guide the PIUs \nin preparing subproject proposals and applications and assess the capacity of the implementing \nagencies  for  financial  management,  procurement,  and  safeguard  compliance.  Detailed  project \nimplementation  arrangements  are  included  in  the  project  administration  manual  (PAM).11 The \napproval process for subproject financing under the facility is summarized as follows. Based on \nselection criteria, the implementing agency will discuss the objectives, scope, and budget of the \nproposed subproject with ADB and the MPI to assess the need for facility financing. Thereafter, \nthe implementing agency will prepare and submit to the MPI a funding application. The PCU will \nreview  the  application  and  determine  its  eligibility  within  28  calendar  days  after  receipt.  The \nPCU will then submit a request to ADB to commit financing from the facility. The facility team will \nreview  the  application  and  consult  with  the  subproject  team  on  subproject  scope  and \nimplementation. Upon receiving ADB\u2019s no objection, the standing vice minister or the minister of \nthe  MPI  will  approve  the  subproject.  The  PCU  will  issue  notice  for  the  implementing  agency\u2019s \nPIU  to  proceed  with  implementing  the  subproject.  The  government  has  been  informed  that \nADB\u2019s  approval  of  subproject  financing  under  the facility  does  not  commit  ADB  to finance  the \nensuing subproject. \n \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n\nApril 2013\u2013June 2020 \n30 December 2019 \n\n(i)  Executing agency \n(ii)  Project coordination unit  \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  Selected line ministries and provincial and city peoples\u2019 committees \neligible under Decree 131/2006 \nProject implementation unit under an implementing agency \nShopping \n\nMinistry of Planning and Investment  \nMinistry of Planning and Investment \n\n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\n$20,000 \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services (capacity \ndevelopment) \n\nConsulting services (preparation \nof subprojects) \n\nRetroactive financing and/or \nadvance contracting \nDisbursement \n\nICS (international) \nICS (national) \nConsultant \nqualification or \nleast-cost selection \nFirma and/or \nindividual consultant \nselection \nNone \n\nTwo contracts for \ninformation technology \nequipment and office \nfurniture \n40 person-months \n740 person-months \nOne contract for audit \nservices \n\n$1,040,000 \n$2,260,000 \n$100,000 \n\nTo be determined during \nimplementation \n\nTo be determined \nduring \nimplementation \n\nLoan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon between the government and \nADB.  \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, ICS = individual consultant selection. \na  Firm selection methods are discussed in para. 20. \nSource: Asian Develo0pment Bank. \n \n\n                                                \n11 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \nADB will work closely with the MPI and the implementing agencies. The facility team will \n25. \nsupport  and  supervise  the  MPI\u2019s  execution  of  the  facility  by  (i)  approving  all  consulting  and \nprocurement activities managed by the MPI, (ii) ensuring that implementation complies with the \nfiduciary requirements, and (iii) monitoring and evaluating the portfolio of subprojects. \n \n26. \nBy fast-tracking the preparation, start-up, and implementation of subprojects, the facility \nwill greatly contribute to (i) bridging the gap between the end of the project preparation and loan \neffectiveness,  which  routinely  takes  up  to  2  years;  (ii)  promoting  advance  action;  (iii) \naccelerating  detailed  engineering  designs  and  the  preparation  of  bidding  documents;  (iv) \nbuilding capacity in stakeholders to process and implement ODA-funded projects in general and \nADB-financed  projects  in particular;  and (v) financing transaction advisory  services. The  result \nwill be (i) earlier benefit delivery; (ii) reduced transaction costs as contracts will not substantially \nlag behind loan approval and effectiveness; and (iii) potentially improved subproject quality, as \ninvestment  loans  will  be  well  designed  with  sound  technical  information,  greater  safeguard \ncompliance, and more precise cost estimates firmed up during the detailed engineering design. \n \nB. \n \n27. \nEconomic and financial benefits generated by the facility will be significant but difficult to \nestimate  accurately.  The  facility  will  finance  the  preparation  of  subprojects  that  are  subject  to \nassessment  for  economic  and  financial  viability,  facilitating  early  implementation  and  prompt \ndisbursement.  Subproject  investment  financing  plans  will  be  processed  in  parallel  with  project \npreparation  rather  than  upon  its  completion.  This  will  shorten  the  lag  between  the  approval  of \nthe investment financing plan and substantial disbursement for works and/or goods by up to  2 \nyears, based on experience across the present portfolio. \n \n28. \nThe  facility  will  reduce  foregone  economic  and  social  benefits  by  bringing  subproject \nbenefits  to  beneficiaries  earlier.  Implementing  agencies  to  be  strengthened  during  project \npreparation  will  benefit  from  better  designs  and  higher  returns  in  terms  of  net  present  value. \nSubprojects funded through ordinary capital resources loans will benefit from lower commitment \ncharges  and  potentially  shorter  implementation periods,  both  of  which  will  substantially  reduce \ntotal  subproject  costs.  In  addition,  the  enhanced  capacity  of  government  agencies  to  prepare \nsubprojects will facilitate better project design with higher economic rates of return. \n \nC. \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n29. \nwith  the  government  and  the  MPI.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 9). \n \nThe government  is  taking  concrete  steps  to  battle  corruption  and  has recently  adopted \n30. \nseveral  legal  reforms,  including  introducing  the  Anti-Corruption  Law. 12  The  government \ninspectorate  has  disclosed  the  results  of  investigations  against  corruption,  and  a  legal \nframework has been established to protect and reward people who speak out against corruption. \n \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n12 Law 55/2005/QH11, enacted on 9 December 2005, and Decree 37/2007 on Implementing the Anti-Corruption Law. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nSafeguards \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nThe  financial  management  assessment  and  the  procurement  capacity  assessment \n31. \nreview  demonstrated  that  the  PCU\u2019s  implementation  of  the  World  Bank\u2019s  PPTAF  for  over  2 \nyears has made the MPI better able to manage the facility. \n \nD. \n \n32. \nThe  facility  is  not  expected  to  have  any  impacts  on  gender  or  social  dimensions. \nHowever,  subprojects  may  generate  such  impacts.  Gender,  labor,  HIV/AIDS,  and  other  social \nrisks  related  to  a  subproject  will  be  assessed  by  the  subproject  team  processing  each \nsubproject. \n \nE. \n \n33. \nAs  the  facility  will  focus  on  preparing  subprojects  and  building  the  capacity  of \nstakeholders,  it  is  not  expected  to  have  any  direct  adverse  social  and environmental  impacts. \nThe  facility  is  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  people.  It \nwill  ensure  the  development  of  environmentally  and  socially  viable  subprojects,  which  will \naccord  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  applicable  government  laws  and \nregulations. \n \nF. \n \n34. \nThe dedicated PCU under the MPI has experience preparing projects and implementing \nthe World Bank\u2019s PPTAF for 2 years. The PCU still requires a financial management specialist \nto support  various  aspects  of financial  management,  assist  in providing financial  management \nsupport  to  implementing  agencies  and  PIUs,  manage  the  facility  imprest  account,  prepare \nperiodic  financial  reports  and  annual  financial  statements,  and  arrange  for  annual  audits.  The \nPCU  will  not  be  responsible for  authorizing  or  verifying  the  transactions  of  subprojects  carried \nout  by  implementing  agencies.  The  implementing  agencies  will,  through  the  PIUs,  be  fully \nresponsible and accountable for the financial management of their subprojects, except for audit, \nwhich the PCU will undertake. Integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh costs. \nMajor  risks  and mitigating measures  are  summarized  in Table  4  and  described  in  detail  in the \nrisk assessment and risk management plan.13 \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n \n\n                                                \n13 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nLack of capacity of the Ministry of Planning \nand Investment to execute the project and \nof the implementing agencies to prepare \nand implement sector projects \n(subprojects) \n \nLack of clarity of procedures for \nimplementation arrangements, fund flow \nand budgeting, resulting in delays \n \n\nChanges to the ODA management \nframework, which is under revision, not \nallowing advance actions to be \nimplemented \n \n\nLack of proper governance to select \nsubprojects and using ADB Procurement \nGuidelines. \n \n\nMitigating Measures \nProvision of technical assistance included into the facility \nand intensified training and capacity building through the \nfacility  for  both  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment \nand the implementing agencies. \n\nSimplification of organizational structure agreed with \nWorld Bank; clear separation of the functions of the PCU \n(managed by the MPI) and of PIUs (managed by line \nministries and / or provincial or city people\u2019s \ncommittees);  \nProcedures of fund flow spelled out in the financial \nmanagement manual with direct payment authorized; \nBudget setting decentralized o the implementing \nagencies; budgeting procedures; reflecting the World \nBank\u2019s experience, with a three-step approval process \nsimplified to a single step \n \nUnder the framework of the six Banks\u2019 initiative (footnote \n6), ADB will continue the dialogue with the government \ntoward revising the legislation on ODA management \nframework to ensure that advance action is \ninstitutionalized \n \nThe legal framework on anti-corruption has been \nstrengthened in 2007.
