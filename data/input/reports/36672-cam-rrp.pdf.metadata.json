It will finance basic health services, which leave limited \nby-products, and will help safeguard the environment by putting in \nplace an early warning and response system, which will reduce \nthe environmental costs of disease control, in particular insecticide \nspraying. Medical wastes will be closely monitored.  \n   \nProject Description  The Governments of Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam (the \nCLV  countries)  propose  a  4-year  regional  project  to  improve \ncommunicable disease control (CDC) at regional, national, and \nprovincial levels in partnership with the Western Pacific Regional \nOffice  (WPRO)  of  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO).  The \nDesign and Monitoring Framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nThe Project will strengthen the regional capacity to contain the \nspread of emerging diseases and reduce the burden of common \nendemic  communicable  diseases  within  the  framework  for \nregional collaboration of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). It \nwill (i) strengthen national surveillance and response systems, (ii) \nimprove CDC for vulnerable groups, and (iii) strengthen regional \ncollaboration in CDC. The targeted provinces are important for \nCDC  because  of  regional  connectivity,  their  high  burden  of \ninfectious diseases, and the high degree of vulnerability of their \npopulations.   \n \nThe  first  component  of  the  Project  will  help  develop \ncomprehensive national surveillance and response systems in the \nthree  countries  and  develop  community-based  models  for \ncontrolling outbreaks of diseases, including avian influenza, in 26 \nprovinces (5 in Cambodia, 6 in Lao PDR, and 15 in Viet Nam). \nInstitutional  structures  based  on  the  new  international  health \nregulations (IHR) will be developed; preparedness, surveillance, \nand response will be improved; district laboratory services will be \nimproved; and human resources will be developed. \n \n ", "    iii\n  The  second  component  will  expand  and  integrate  CDC  for \nvulnerable  groups  in  26  priority  provinces  by  (i)  strengthening \nprovincial capacity for CDC; (ii) supporting comprehensive CDC \nfor  vulnerable  groups,  including  control  of  neglected \ncommunicable diseases like dengue and parasitic infections; and \n(iii) improving the continuum of care for the control of human \nimmunodeficiency  virus/acquired  immunodeficiency  syndrome \n(HIV/AIDS) in high-risk populations. \n  \nThe third component will develop productive regional coordination \nfor CDC through regional policy dialogue, operations research for \nHIV/AIDS  control  and  other  fields  through  regional  institutions, \nand project management. The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), \nMyanmar, and Thailand will be invited to participate in regional \nworkshops. \n \nRationale  The CLV countries have made remarkable progress in improving \nthe health of their populations over the past decades, and are \nmaking major efforts to putting in place strong policy frameworks \nand primary health care (PHC) systems. However, as discussed \nat  the  Fifth  Meeting  of  the  GMS  Working  Group  on  Human \nResource  Development  in  Yangon  in  June  2004,  the  CLV \ncountries may not achieve their health-related MDGs based on \ncurrent challenges and efforts.   \n \nTo  achieve  health-related  MDGs  requires  providing  PHC  to \nremote populations suffering from a high burden of infectious and \nreproductive diseases, and improving the affordability and quality \nof  health  care.  This  is  further  complicated  by  the  need  for \ncommunity  action  to  contain  emerging  diseases  like  avian \ninfluenza  and  severe  acute  respiratory  syndrome  (SARS), \ndengue, and HIV/AIDS, which are facilitated by increased market \nintegration, connectivity, and movements of people and goods.  \n \nAt the GMS summit meeting in 2005, the six heads of government \nreaffirmed their vision of a subregion free from poverty and able to \nprovide  sustainable  development  opportunities  for  their \npopulations.  Besides  economic  cooperation  and  integration, \nhuman  development  was  appreciated  as  the  crux  of  the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) for reducing poverty. The \nleaders proposed stronger regional collaboration in CDC in view \nof  HIV/AIDS  and  emerging  infectious  diseases  like  avian \ninfluenza, as part of national health systems development.  \n \n.    ", "iv \n \n  Regional cooperation in CDC is justified if benefits exceed what \ncountries acting on their own can achieve. In CDC, the rationale \nfor  regional  cooperation  can  be  broken  down  into  four  broad \ncategories, namely: (i) transmission of communicable diseases, \n(ii)  technology  transfers,  (iii)  economies  of  scale  and  greater \nleverage, and (iv) regional public goods for health. \n \nCDC and health systems in general have developed in relative \nisolation. International boundaries reinforced national approaches \nto health systems and disease control in the \u201cpre-globalization\u201d \nera, when borders barred the movement of people and goods. \nHowever, in recent years, globalization has transformed borders \nfrom  barriers  to  bridges,  and  this  transformation  has  shifted \nattention to cross-border matters that localities have in common.  \n \nThe emergence in the GMS of SARS and avian influenza have \ndemonstrated  that  the  economic  impact  from  these  diseases \namounts to billions of dollars through declining tourism, reduced \nflows of foreign investment, and export restrictions on livestock \nand animal products. A human avian influenza pandemic may \ncause millions of deaths and an economic meltdown. To enhance \nnational  economic  and  health  security,  epidemics  must  be \ncontained at their source and their potential spread in the region \nminimized. This will require strong regional efforts for CDC. \n \nThe revised IHR of WHO, approved in May 2005, will serve as the \nnew legal framework for actions to prevent the spread of disease \ninternationally. Under the new IHR, countries will be expected to \nreport any public health threat. They will establish and maintain \nminimum  core  surveillance  and  response  capacities  to \nsuccessfully implement the global health security, epidemic alert, \nand response strategy. \n \nRegional economic developments, emerging diseases and their \neconomic impact, and high-level political commitment to attaining \nMDGs have generated strong support for regional cooperation \nacross health sectors. The current GMS setting favors a regional \napproach to CDC that can significantly improve the health of the \npoor in the CLV countries.  \n \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The overall anticipated impact of the GMS Regional CDC Project \nis to contain the spread of epidemic diseases at local level and \nreduce  the  burden  of  common  endemic  diseases  in  the  CLV \ncountries by about 15% in the targeted provinces, and more for \ncertain specific infections. This will help these countries progress \ntoward their health-related MDGs for 2015 of reducing the child \nmortality rate and containing the spread of HIV/AIDS and other \ninfections.   \n \n ", "    v\n  The  expected  project  outcomes  are  (i)  timely  and  adequate \ncontrol of epidemics that are likely to have a major impact on \npublic  health  and  the  economy  in  the  region;  (ii)  improved \ncoverage of prevention and care of communicable diseases in \nvulnerable  populations;  and  (iii)  improved  know-how,  policies, \nstandards,  and  coordination  among  countries  to  improve  CDC \nincluding for HIV/AIDS through intergovernmental cooperation.  \n \nActivities under the Project are pro-poor, focusing on PHC and \ncommunity-based  activities  in  priority  provinces.  Women  and \nchildren will be the major beneficiaries of community interventions. \nPriority will be given to CDC in remote areas including border \nprovinces where many ethnic groups and the poorest reside. \n   \nCost Estimates  The  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  approximately  $38.75  million, \nincluding duties and taxes. Of the total, $19.73 million or 51% is \nthe foreign exchange cost and $19.02 million equivalent or 49% \nrepresents the local currency costs. \n   \nFinancing Plan  The Governments have requested the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to provide a grant of $30.0 million from its Special Funds \nresources  (Asian  Development  Fund  IX  Grants  Program), \nrepresenting 77.4% of the total project cost. WHO will contribute \n$0.9 million for technical experts. The Governments will provide \ncounterpart  funds  totaling  $7.85  million  equivalent,  including \nCambodia $1.98 million, Lao PDR $1.32 million, and Viet Nam \n$4.55 million.  \n \n  \nFinancing Plan \n($ million) \nForeign  Local   \n Source  Exchange  Currency  Total    % \n Asian Development Bank        18.83       11.17   30.00    77.4 \n World Health Organization          0.90         0.00     0.90      2.3 \n Government of Cambodia          0.00         1.98     1.98      5.1 \n Government of the Lao PDR          0.00         1.32     1.32      3.4 \n Government of Viet Nam           0.00         4.55     4.55    11.7 \nTotal        19.73       19.02   38.75  100.0 \nSources: Governments and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n   ", "vi \n \nGrant Amount and Terms  For the Government of Cambodia, a grant of $9.0 million will be \nprovided  from  the  Special  Funds  of  ADB  with  terms  and \nconditions substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft Grant Agreement presented to the Board.  \n \nFor the Government of the Lao PDR, a grant of $6.0 million will be \nprovided  from  the  Special  Funds  of  ADB  with  terms  and \nconditions substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft Grant Agreement presented to the Board.  \n \nFor the Government of Viet Nam, a grant of $15.0 million will be \nprovided  from  the  Special  Funds  of  ADB  with  terms  and \nconditions substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft Grant Agreement presented to the Board. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Up to 30 June 2010 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2009 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agencies  The Ministries of Health of Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam will \nbe the Executing Agencies. \n   \nImplementation  In Cambodia, project implementation will be guided by the health \nArrangements  sector steering committee (SC) of the Ministry of Health (MOH), \nwhich is chaired by the Minister of Health. The Communicable \nDiseases  Control  Department  will  be  the  coordinating \nImplementing Agency (IA). The health sector support program will \nprovide administrative support. Three national institutions and five \nprovinces will also serve as IAs.  \n \nIn the Lao PDR, project implementation will be guided by the \nMOH SC, chaired by the Minister of Health. The Department of \nHygiene and Prevention will be the coordinating IA, and will be \nsupported  by  the  Department  of  Planning  and  Budgeting  in \nplanning,  procurement,  financial  management,  and  reporting. \nThree national institutions and six provinces will also serve as IAs.  \n \nIn Viet Nam, project implementation will be guided by the MOH \nSC  for  ADB-funded  projects,  chaired  by  the  Vice-Minister  of \nHealth for Preventive Services. The Viet Nam Administration of \nPreventive  Medicine  will  be  the  EA  and  coordinating  IA.  Four \nnational institutions and 15 provinces will also serve as IAs.  \n ", "    vii\n  For the region, the regional CDC SC formed under the project \npreparatory technical assistance will continue to meet every  6 \nmonths, with the hosting rotated among the countries. Its function \nis advisory. It will give guidance in project implementation, policy \ndialogue, and the building of regional capacity and cooperation for \nCDC, and will facilitate country decisions on the use of pooled \nfunds for regional activities. It will be chaired by the minister or \nvice-minister  of  the  host  country  and  will  consist  of  leading \nrepresentatives from the national SCs, project directors, and ADB \nand WHO representatives. A regional coordination unit (RCU) to \nbe  set  up  in  Hanoi  will  act  as  the  secretariat  for  regional \ncoordination activities and the management of regional funds.  \n \nTo facilitate the flow of funds for regional activities, $4.3 million, or \n11%  of  the  project  funds,  will  be  administered  by  ADB  as  a \nregional  CDC  fund  for  regional  collaboration, managed  by  the \nRCU. This fund will cover expenditures for the Project\u2019s regional \nSC, technical forums, international consulting services, regional \nstudies,  cross-border  activities,  and  the  RCU  itself.  ADB\u2019s \nadministration  of  the  pooled  regional  funds  is  considered \nnecessary to ensure the efficient release of funds. The regional \nCDC fund will be financed from ADB\u2019s share of the grant on the \nbasis of a ratio of 30:20:50 for Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet \nNam,  respectively.  The  contribution  to  the  RCU  and  regional \nactivities will follow this ratio, subject to country approval, except \nfor the financing of studies, for which the country contributions will \nbe determined on a case-by-case basis by the regional SC.  \n \nWHO has been requested to engage and manage nine types of \ninternational  consulting  services,  including  for  surveillance  and \nresponse,  dengue,  and  endemic  diseases,  as  it  has  special \nexpertise  in  this  area.  ADB  will  provide  $1.6  million  from  the \nregional  CDC  fund\u2014representing  $0.48  million  of  its  grant \nallocation  for  Cambodia,  $0.32  million  for  Lao  PDR,  and  0.80 \nmillion for Viet Nam\u2014and WHO will provide $0.9 million, for a total \nof  $2.5  million.  This  arrangement  has  been  agreed  to  by  the \nrecipients of the grant and is reflected in the grant agreements. \nWHO and  ADB have  agreed to sign a project implementation \nagreement authorizing WHO to recruit and manage international \nexperts according to procedures acceptable to ADB and subject to \nthe approval of candidates by ADB (see para. 93). The project \nimplementation agreement specifies, among others, (i) the type of \nexperts to be provided by WHO, (ii) the manner in which these \nexperts  will  operate  in  close  coordination  with  MOH,  and \n(iii) implementation  arrangements  for  the  selection  of  experts, \nreporting, disbursement, and performance review.  ", "viii \n \nProcurement  ADB-financed goods and services will be procured according to \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and the relevant laws in each \ncountry. However, if there is any inconsistency between ADB\u2019s \nrequirements  and  the  national  laws,  ADB\u2019s  requirements  will \nprevail.  Equipment  will  be  procured  through  (i)  international \ncompetitive  bidding  for  contracts  worth  at  least  $1  million; \n(ii) international shopping for contracts worth at least $100,000 but \nless than $1 million for the Governments of Cambodia and Lao \nPDR,  and  at  least  $350,000  but  less  than  $1  million  for  the \nGovernment  of  Viet  Nam;  and  (iii) local  competitive  bidding  or \ndirect purchase for items valued at less than $100,000 for the \nGovernments of Cambodia and Lao PDR, and less than $350,000 \nfor the Government of Viet Nam. The procurement of equipment \nand supplies will be managed by each EA, which may delegate \nthis task to IAs for items valued at less than $20,000 in Lao PDR \nand Cambodia, and $50,000 in Viet Nam. \n   \nConsulting Services  The Project will provide for 238 person-months of international \nand 1,176 person-months of national consulting services. Of the \ninternational  consultants,  the  regional  project  coordinator,  the \nhealth  system  development  expert,  and  the  HIV/AIDS  chief \ntechnical  adviser  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  as  individual \nconsultants for a total of 68 person-months according to ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. International experts for \nsurveillance  and  response,  outbreak  preparedness,  virology, \ndengue  control,  control  of  endemic  diseases,  legislation,  and \nhealth information system will be contracted for a total of 170 \nperson-months by WHO as implementing agency according to its \nrules and regulations for administrative procedures and practices. \nADB-funded experts engaged by WHO must first be approved by \nADB  and  MOH.  Domestic  consultants  will  be  engaged  as \nindividual  consultants  by  each  MOH  according  to  procedures \nacceptable to ADB. \n     \nProject  Benefits and  The Project will help improve the health of targeted populations \nBeneficiaries  and thereby increase their productivity, and help progress toward \nthe health-related MDGs. The Project will improve prevention and \ncontrol of communicable diseases, intergovernmental cooperation \nin  containing  and  eliminating  diseases,  and  also  contribute  to \nstrengthening national health systems.  \n \nActivities  under  the  Project  are  targeted  toward  the  poor  in \ngeneral  and  those  living  in  remote  locations  including  border \nareas,  where  many  ethnic  groups  and  the  most  poor  reside. \nWomen  and  children  will  be  the  major  beneficiaries  of  these \ncommunity-level interventions.   \n \n ", "    ix\n  The economic benefits of the Project will come from (i) helping \nprevent major epidemics; (ii) productivity gains from an increased \nlifespan  and  reduced  mortality;  (iii) productivity  gains  from \nimproved  achievements  in  education,  especially  through  less \nabsenteeism  and  reduced  dropout  rates;  and  (iv)  public  and \nprivate savings in health expenditures, including indirect costs.  \n \nRisks and Assumptions  The  Project  has  some  technical  risks  in  the  effectiveness  of \ncontrol measures, in particular for dengue and community-based \nsurveillance in general. These technical risks will be mitigated by \npartnering  with  WHO,  hiring  more  national  staff  to  build  local \ncapacity,  and  strengthening  provincial  and  community \ninvolvement.  Institutional  networking  and  regional  collaboration \nwill also help strengthen the implementation capacity of provinces. \n \nPrevious ADB projects showed project management to be critical \nto  achieving  results.  Each  coordinating  IA  will  have  a  project \nmanagement  unit,  which  will  be  supported  by  existing  project \nadministrative  capacity  in  each  MOH  in  areas  like  planning, \nprocurement, financial management, monitoring, and reporting.    \n \nRegional cooperation is known to require considerable front-end \ncosts  with  low  immediate  returns  because  of  an  \u201cincubation \nperiod.\u201d  However,  these  costs  should  be  offset  by  substantial \nbenefits from regional disease control, technology transfer, and \nstrengthened national commitment for health sector development, \nall of which will have long-term value across the region. ADB will \nneed to provide substantial support for regional cooperation and \nensure that this becomes fully institutionalized in terms of budget, \nstaff, responsibility, and authority in the ministries. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  recurrent  costs  amount  to  about  $1.7  million  in \n2009, the final year of implementation, and $1.1 million by 2012. \nThe three governments confirmed that the increased recurrent \ncost resulting from the Project can be covered by their respective \nhealth budgets. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "xi\n103o  00'E 108 o 00'E\nGREATER MEKONG SUBREGION\nREGIONAL COMMUNICABLE DISEASES\nCONTROL PROJECT\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n9\n7\nLao Cai\n1 Yen Bai 6 10\n4\nNuihong 16 Lang Son\n2 8 11\nCAMBODIA PHONGSALY 3 5 12 13 Ke1p8 17Na Duoung\nLuangnamtha HANOI 1419\nLUANGNAMTHA 20 15 Cai Lan\nHoa Binh 21 Haiphong\n23 24\nBan Houei Sai Pak Mong 22\nBOKEO OUDOMXAYLUANGPRABANG HOUAPHANH 25 26\nNam Doth\n20 o 00'N Luangprabang 27 20 o 00'N\nGulf  of  Tonkin\nLAO  PDR Thanh Hoa\nXieng Khouang\nXAYABURY XIENGKHUANG 28\nXAYSOMBOUN\nVang Vieng SPECIAL REGION\nVinh\nVIENTIANE BORIKHAMXAY\nPakkading\nBan Lao 29 PROVINCES\n1.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed grants \nto the Kingdom of Cambodia, the Lao Democratic People\u2019s Republic (Lao PDR), and the \nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Greater Mekong Subregion Regional Communicable \nDiseases Control Project. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Rationale for a Regional Approach  \n \n2.  The  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  Regional  Communicable  Diseases  Control \n(CDC)  Project  is  a  project  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  in  partnership  with  the \nWestern Pacific Regional Office (WPRO) of the World Health Organization (WHO).1 The Project \nwill cover three GMS countries that are in great need of assistance in controlling communicable \ndiseases\u2014Cambodia,  Lao  PDR,  and  Viet  Nam  (the  CLV  countries)\u2014and  offer  regional \narrangements for cooperation with People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Myanmar, and Thailand.2 \n \n3.  Since  1992,  ADB  has  been  supporting  the  GMS  Program  to  increase  economic \ncooperation and integration among Cambodia, the PRC (in particular with Yunnan Province), \nLao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. At the GMS summit meetings in 2002 and 2005, \nthe six heads of government declared their vision of a subregion free from poverty and able to \nprovide sustainable development opportunities for their populations. The Regional Cooperation \nStrategy and Program 2004\u20132008 revolves around four main elements: connectivity and cross-\nborder facilitation; integration of national markets for economic efficiency and private sector \ndevelopment; environmental and natural resource management; and human development.  \n \n4.  Regional cooperation is justified if benefits exceed what countries acting on their own \ncan achieve. Specifically for CDC, the rationale for regional cooperation can be broken down \ninto four broad categories: \n \n(i)  Nature of communicable disease transmission: Communicable diseases are \ntransmitted  by  people,  vectors,  food,  and  elements  throughout  a  particular \ngeographic region irrespective of national borders.  \n \n(ii)  Technology transfer: Regional cooperation enables participating countries to \nshare experiences and knowledge about health policies, system design, and \ndisease control, and apply lessons learned. These technology transfers also \nfacilitate greater consistency, clarity, and transparency among countries in CDC \nand other health matters. \n \n(iii)  Economies  of  scale  and  greater  leverage:  Regional  cooperation  helps  to \nachieve economies of scale for more efficient resource allocation, e.g., sharing \ndesign work, testing, expertise, and procurement. Also, participating countries \ncan acquire greater leverage in attracting donor funding by aggregating particular \nunderfunded endemic diseases. \n \n                                                 \n1  The Project is included in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) program for 2005.  \n2  A regional TA was provided under ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia, the Lao \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic, and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Preparing the Greater Mekong Subregion \nRegional Communicable Diseases Control Project (JSF). Manila. The TA included four regional workshops.  ", "2   \n(iv)  Regional public goods for health: Programs to prevent HIV/AIDS and other \ninfectious diseases are regional public goods (RPGs). The weakest link in a \nchain determines the chain\u2019s overall strength, and thus coordination in disease \nprevention programs and the raising of standards across countries will provide \ngreater protection for the populations in the region.  \n \n5.  CDC and health systems in general have developed in relative isolation. International \nboundaries reinforced national approaches to health systems and disease control in the \u201cpre-\nglobalization\u201d era, when borders barred the movement of people and goods. However, in recent \nyears, globalization has transformed borders from barriers to bridges, and this transformation \nhas shifted attention to cross-border matters that localities have in common. Regional economic \ndevelopments, catalytic events and their economic impact, and high-level political commitment \nto attaining Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have generated strong support for regional \ncooperation across health sectors. The current GMS setting favors a regional approach to CDC \nthat can significantly improve the health of the poor in the CLV countries. \n \n6.  Despite the strong rationale for regional cooperation in CDC and broader health systems \ndevelopment, regional initiatives in the GMS health sector have been limited. New approaches \nto CDC are manifested in the Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance Program (MBDSP), financed \nby the Rockefeller Foundation, and the ongoing revision of the international health regulations \n(IHR) by WHO. With the support of MBDSP, a major landmark was achieved in 2001 when the \nsix GMS ministers of health signed an agreement to share disease information and cooperate to \ncontrol diseases across borders.  \n \n7.  The revised IHR of WHO, approved in May 2005, will serve as the new legal framework \nfor actions to prevent the spread of disease internationally. Under the new IHR, countries will be \nexpected to report any (potential) epidemic or other public health threat. They will establish and \nmaintain minimum core surveillance and response capacities to successfully implement the \nglobal health security, epidemic alert, and response strategy.3 \n \nB.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n8.  As reflected in the United Nations Millennium Statement, \u201cWe the Peoples,\u201d human \ndevelopment is the crux of poverty reduction and economic growth. Four out of eight MDGs \nrelate directly to health and nutrition\u2014reducing child and maternal mortality and malnutrition, \nand  containing  and  beginning  to  reverse  the  trend  of  HIV/AIDS4  and  other  communicable \ndiseases. In the GMS and elsewhere, human development plays a major role in economic \ngrowth and poverty reduction.  \n \n9.  The CLV countries have made remarkable progress in improving the health of their \npopulations over the past decades, and are making major efforts to putting in place strong policy \nframeworks and expanding primary health care (PHC). However, as discussed at the Fifth \nMeeting of the GMS Working Group on Human Resource Development (HRD) in Yangon in \nJune 2004, the CLV countries may not achieve the health-related MDGs of reduction of under-5 \n                                                 \n3  The revised international health requlations were endorsed by the World Health Assembly in May 2005 with a \nproposed implementation date of June 2006.  \n4  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.  \n ", "    3\nchild mortality, maternal mortality, and malnutrition based on current challenges and efforts \n(Appendix 2).5  \n \n10.  Achieving MDGs will require targeting poor and remote populations, women and infants, \nethnic minorities, and people living in border areas. These populations are suffering from a high \nburden of reproductive illnesses and common infections such as malaria, diarrhea, typhoid \nfever,  acute  respiratory  infections,  measles,  tuberculosis,  and  parasitic  infections.  Without \nappropriate care these diseases result in high mortality, disability, and malnutrition. The impact \nof infectious diseases on learning and productivity is profound.  \n \n11.  In the past decade, the region has experienced major increases in HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C \nand dengue, which can spread easier through increased market integration, connectivity, and \nmovements of people and goods. Cambodia has a generalized HIV/AIDS epidemic, the Lao \nPDR is surrounded by countries with generalized or concentrated HIV/AIDS epidemics, and Viet \nNam has a concentrated epidemic in high-risk groups. Social changes and increasing inequity \nare also likely to accelerate the spread of HIV/AIDS.  \n \n12.  More recently, the region has been the center of outbreaks of severe acute respiratory \nsyndrome (SARS) and avian influenza (AI). Already at this level of relatively minor human \nimpact, the economic impact of AI has been substantial, amounting to billions of dollars in \nlosses through declining tourism, reduced flows of foreign investment, and export restrictions on \nlivestock and animal products. A human AI pandemic may cause millions of deaths and an \neconomic meltdown. To enhance national economic and health security, epidemics must be \ncontained at their source and their potential spread in the region minimized, requiring regional \nsupport for CDC. This will require reaching all communities with basic prevention and control \nsystems, including those not reached so far.   \n \n13.  Since the CLV countries emerged from war, their respective Governments have been \nfully committed to building up a network of PHC facilities and improving human resources. At \nthe same time, the private sector has been expanding, with private practitioners, drug shops, \nand  paramedics  becoming  major  providers  of  basic  curative  care.  The  impact  of  these \ndevelopments can be seen in service coverage indicators in Cambodia and the Lao PDR. \nAccess to essential drugs now stands at about 50% in Cambodia, 80% in Lao PDR, and 85% in \nViet Nam. The Lao PDR has achieved this coverage in part through community-based care, in \ncontrast to the more institution-based services in the other countries. However, immunization \nrates are lower in the Lao PDR, at about 36\u201365% compared with 43\u201376% in Cambodia and 78\u2013\n99%  in  Viet  Nam.  Modern  contraceptive  medicine  coverage  among  couples  is  19%  in \nCambodia, 29% in the Lao PDR, and 56% in Viet Nam, another area of concern.  \n \n14.  The market-oriented reforms introduced in the CLV countries in the late 1980s and \n1990s opened up opportunities for private providers. Urban people now have more options in \nselecting their health-care providers. The growth of privately owned pharmacies has made \ndrugs and supplies more widely available. However, few private doctors set up clinics in rural \nareas, where the purchasing power is very low. The private sector is largely unregulated and \noften wasteful and of substandard quality. Affordability of health services has been declining as \nthe gap between the rich and the poor increases.   \n \n                                                 \n5  Millennium Development Goals are standard global targets and are ambitious for Lao PDR, with its difficult terrain, \nhigh poverty, and large ethnic minority population. Current trends indicate that achieving projections will require \nintensified efforts, as further improvements in the indicators will become relatively more difficult.  ", "4   \n15.  In particular, CLV Governments will need to improve access to PHC for vulnerable \npopulations, and improve the affordability and quality of health care. Access to health services is \na  particular  problem  for  ethnic  minorities,  many  of  them  living  in  hilly  areas.  Language \ndifferences  between  health  staff  and  the  ethnic  minorities  present  another  barrier.  Health \nservices use out-of-pocket payment for medicines and services, which the poor can often not \npay for when they require the care. For various reasons, there is a serious lack of qualified staff \nin rural areas. Even more fundamental are problems besetting the health systems themselves \nincluding low staff salaries, supervision and supply constraints, inadequate integration of vertical \nprograms and PHC, limited provincial planning and budgeting capacity, and fiscal constraints. \nAn analysis of the challenges in the health sector is in Appendix 3. \n \n16.  Public expenditures on health do not reflect the recent economic gains. Public health \nspending in the CLV countries is still only about 1.6\u20131.7% of gross domestic product (GDP), \ncausing major financial constraints in public health services. But the countries differ widely in \ntotal health spending, at 11.8% of GDP in Cambodia, 3.1% in the Lao PDR, and 5.1% in Viet \nNam. Per capita spending per year is $30 in Cambodia, $10 in Lao PDR, and $21 in Viet Nam, \ncompared with $49 in PRC, $69 in Thailand, and the international minimum standard of $34. \nAbout 13% of health spending in Viet Nam is donor-financed, versus about 30% in Cambodia \nand the Lao PDR. Public sector spending in the Lao PDR is about 50% of total health spending, \ncompared with 13% in Cambodia and 28% in Viet Nam.  \n \n17.  Following the influx of donors after the war, the Government of Cambodia has taken bold \nsteps  to  bring  donors  together  under  one  program,  and  contract  out  health  services  to \nnongovernment agencies. The Health Sector Support Plan 2003\u201307 is the basis for sector-wide \nmanagement by Cambodia\u2019s Ministry of Health (MOH) and serves as an umbrella framework for \nhealth activities under the National Poverty Reduction Scheme. The plan specifies six key areas \nof  work:  (i)  health  service  delivery,  (ii) behavioral  change  and  communication,  (iii)  quality \nimprovement, (iv) HRD, (v) health financing, and (vi) institutional development.6 MOH follows a \nstrong  system  approach,  promoting  village  health  support  groups  and  health  center \nmanagement  committees,  integrated  management  of  childhood  illnesses  (IMCI),  consumer \nconfidence in health services, and ethical conduct. CDC is to be fully integrated with PHC at \nprovincial level and below.   \n \n18.  The Government of the Lao PDR has consistently tried to build up the national health \nsystem, starting from a very limited capacity. It has succeeded in improving access to services, \nbut must now operate an expanded health system with scant resources for a largely poor \npopulation. The country\u2019s MOH has developed a poverty-focused health development plan for \n2005\u20132010  within  the  general  framework  of  the  National  Growth  and  Poverty  Eradication \nStrategy, the Health Sector Strategy 2020, and the Health Sector Master Plan. The Government \nwants to give every citizen access to essential health care. MOH is undertaking a strategic \nplanning exercise, including the preparation of provincial strategic plans and 5-year plans. It is \nalso forming task forces to review key subsectors and draw up development plans for them. The \nGovernment gives high priority to CDC, and has been increasing funding for CDC programs, in \nparticular for malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS control supported by the Global Fund. While a \nstrong PHC network is in place, integration of CDC and PHC needs more work.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n6  Government of Cambodia, MOH. 2004. Pushing the Momentum for Health Sector Development: The First Health \nSector Annual Operational Plan, 2005. Phnom Penh. \n ", "    5\n19.  The Government of Viet Nam had a pro-health policy for decades, resulting in a well-\ndeveloped  health  system.  However,  the  system  has  suffered  from  some  of  the  negative \nconsequences of much-needed reforms. The Government is making efforts to improve the \npublic health system and address the increasing gap between the rich and the poor through \nfinancing reforms and targeted support. Its aim is to give all communes full access to health \nservices, have health workers in all villages, adjust user fees to suit costs as well as the ability \nto pay, expand health insurance, and improve the supply of drugs and medical equipment. \nViet Nam is now implementing the health development plan for 2001\u20132005, with targets set for \n2010. It is increasing recurrent public health spending to 5% of government expenditure or at \nleast 1% of GDP, and especially targeting disadvantaged areas. Viet Nam\u2019s health development \nstrategy is further elaborated in subsector and area plans. The Government\u2019s health targets for \n2010 include the control of common communicable diseases such as malaria, dengue, hepatitis \nB, and Japanese encephalitis. Integration of CDC and PHC and reaching vulnerable groups at \nprovincial level and below is also a major challenge in Viet Nam. \n \nC.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.  Communicable Disease Priorities \n20.  Emerging Diseases. Outbreaks of newly emerging diseases such as SARS in 2003 and \nAI in 2004 and 2005 have so far had little impact on health in the region, but could have vastly \nmore devastating effects. The case fatality rate for SARS is around 10% and for human AI \nabout 50%. As of the end of May 2005, 50 people in Viet Nam had died from AI, or 80% of all \ndeaths in the region. Cambodia has had four deaths in Kampot province. However, scientists \nindicate that the AI virus may mutate or reassort into another virus that spreads in humans like \nan ordinary flu virus. This could cause a global pandemic with millions of deaths in the region. \n   \n21.  These  emerging  diseases,  even  with  limited  health  impact,  have  major  economic \nconsequences. SARS slowed economic growth by reducing tourism and communication. GDP \nin the region could have declined by 0.2\u20131.8 percentage points if SARS had persisted for one \neconomic quarter, and, GDP in the individual countries could have fallen by 0.5\u20134.0 percentage \npoints if it had gone on for two quarters.7  While the CLV countries do not have a major poultry \nexport industry like Thailand, AI has probably reduced GDP by about 0.5% in Viet Nam.8 More \nimportantly, it has had a major impact at the local level on poor backyard farmers and wet \nmarkets. Viet Nam has culled almost a quarter of its national poultry stock. A human pandemic \nmay cause an economic meltdown.   \n \n22.  The fast spread of these diseases and their potential consequences highlight the need \nfor regional collaboration in CDC. Such a strategy must entail the strengthening of surveillance \nand response systems from community-level workers detecting outbreaks to laboratory facilities \nand provincial and national response centers. Cooperation across the health and agriculture \nsectors is important for AI. AI requires better poultry biosecurity and vaccination, improved \npreparedness and response of public and private services including quarantine arrangements \nand medicines, and risk profiling and monitoring the spread and genotype of the virus in hosts. \nThe ministries of agriculture in the region are performing animal surveillance with assistance \nfrom the Food and Agriculture Organization. Laboratory conditions for the cultivation of the AI \nvirus in the national animal health laboratories are substandard and pose a biohazard.  \n \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2003. Economic Research Department Policy Brief No. 15. Manila. \n8  An initial economic impact assessment is available as a separate report (and has already been circulated within \nADB). ", "6   \n23.  Early and accurate detection is also a vital element in preventing the spread of other \ninfectious diseases like measles, dengue, typhoid, and cholera. Beyond the rise of emerging \ndiseases, the capacities of the CLV countries\u2019 health systems will be further challenged by \nWHO\u2019s introduction of new IHR mandating that governments report any outbreak of infectious \ndiseases (and possibly chemical and radiological threat) starting in June 2006, as discussed \nbelow. The health surveillance and monitoring systems in the CLV countries already required \nlong-term assistance to strengthen the capacity to generate reliable, timely, routine data before \nSARS  and  AI,  and  thus  the  emergence  of  new,  complicated  communicable  diseases  is \ncompounding the pressures placed on the surveillance systems. While most diseases require \nbasic laboratory procedures, some of them, such as AI, require more complicated laboratory \nprocedures for confirmation done in bio-safety level-3 laboratories. \n  \n24.  The CLV countries cannot cope with a major outbreak of emerging disease. At present \nthere are no human vaccines available for the types of newly emerging diseases that are \nthreatening the region. Experience with AI cases in Viet Nam suggests that currently available \ntreatment is of limited benefit. Only few hospitals can manage a limited number of AI cases and \nare not prepared for any major epidemic. Even if vaccines and drugs were available, production \ncapacity  would  not  be  able  to  cope  with  demand.  While  national  preparedness  plans  are \navailable, this has mostly not translated in concrete action plans in the various sectors.  \n    \n25.  HIV/AIDS. The Lao PDR and Viet Nam now have low prevalence of HIV/AIDS, but both \ncountries have neighbors with high prevalence rates, namely, Cambodia and Thailand. Viet \nNam has a growing HIV/AIDS problem in the form of a concentrated epidemic among high-risk \ngroups, including injecting drug users and sex workers. As of 31 May 2005, Viet Nam reported a \ncumulative total of 93,402 cases of HIV cases. The HIV prevalence is about 57% in injecting \ndrug users and 3% in sex workers. The infections are concentrated in cities and along the roads \nand borders in hot spots, in particular the borders with Cambodia and the PRC. Cambodia has a \nmaturing HIV/AIDS epidemic, with around 1.9% of the population aged 15\u201349 infected with \nHIV\u2014down from 2.2% in 2001, but an increasing prevalence among rural women. As a result of \npast high infection rates, Cambodia is estimated to have more than 120,000 people now living \nwith HIV/AIDS, composing 1.9% of the population aged 15\u201349. The impact on GDP and the \ncost of health services is substantial. In the Lao PDR, 1,636 HIV positive cases were detected \nbetween 1990 and 2005. While this figure is low by regional standards, particular \u201chot spots\u201d in \nthe country have emerged, where service women have high HIV prevalence rates; Bokeo, for \ninstance, has 4% HIV prevalence among service women, and Savannakhet 3.2%. The Joint \nUnited Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) expects HIV prevalence in the Lao PDR to \ndouble every 1\u20132 years over the next few years. \n \n26.  HIV/AIDS funding for Viet Nam is substantial but further support is particularly needed \nfor harm reduction, continuum of care, prevention among youth, and regional collaboration and \nresearch. Cambodia is currently only able to provide antiretroviral treatment to half of the AIDS \npatients and needs support for continuum of care. While the Lao PDR has low HIV/AIDS \nprevalence, it must expand prevention and care to contain the epidemic as much as possible.   \n \n27.  Most activities for HIV/AIDS prevention and control can be handled through national and \nprovincial  programs,  but  particular  cross-border  HIV/AIDS  issues  and  challenges  are \ndemonstrating the need for selected regional initiatives as well. A major concern is that the inter-\ncountry  mobility  of  people,  facilitated  in  great  part  by  the  provision  of  roads  and  other \ninfrastructure with the support of international and regional development institutions, will make \nHIV/AIDS  much  more  difficult  to  prevent  and  control.  Sex  workers,  trafficked  women, \nconstruction workers, truck drivers, and other mobile groups moving across different parts of the \n ", "    7\nGMS contribute greatly to the spread of the disease and are often beyond the reach of health \nservice providers for detection and treatment. Regional cooperation is necessary to address \nthese potential sources of transmission. \n \n28.  Neglected Endemic Diseases. Intensive efforts are under way to control and prevent \ncommunicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria in the CLV countries. \nHowever,  acute  respiratory  infections,  infectious  diarrhea,  typhoid,  cholera,  food-borne \ndiseases, dengue, and parasitic diseases are significant causes of morbidity and mortality. \nThese  diseases,  increasingly  being  referred  to  as  neglected  endemic  diseases,  are  often \nconcentrated in poor and ethnic minorities living in remote rural areas (or urban slums in the \ncase of dengue). Thus, neglected diseases primarily affect poor and vulnerable communities, \nand they disproportionately affect women and children. The high morbidity from neglected \ndiseases  affects  school  attendance,  cognitive  development,  physical  growth,  and  overall \nproductivity. Worm infestations like helminthiasis, filariasis, and schistosomiasis, which receive \nvery little donor attention, make up a special group of neglected diseases. Controlling these \ninfections would result in major health and education benefits to children. Highly cost-effective \ninterventions are available to manage most  common infections, but budget shortages and \nselective donor priorities have hampered provincial and local health offices to tackle these \ncommon problems. \n \n29.  In  addition  to  the  comparatively  low  funding  for  neglected  endemic  diseases,  the \nprevention and treatment of these diseases is hampered by the absence of an integrated \napproach to dealing with them at the district and community levels. Integrated local planning for \nmanaging these diseases is insufficient (or absent). Local health planning and services usually \ntake a selective approach to prioritized diseases. The CLV countries have implemented the \nIMCI Program, which manages acute childhood illnesses in an integrated manner, but the \nprogram is not well funded and has limited coverage. Moreover, IMCI is often not implemented \nwell, because disparate vertical programs are often not integrated and dominate the local health \nworkers\u2019 time and attention as well-funded donors\u2019 programs take precedence. These programs \nshould  be  mainstreamed  in  comprehensive  provincial  and  district  health  plans  through  an \nintegrated PHC mechanism. The comprehensive, integrated care mechanism should also link \ndirectly to the surveillance and response system, whereby health workers providing treatment \nfor endemic diseases also feed into the reporting system.  \n \n2.  Vulnerable Populations \n30.  Mobile Populations. A priority in the GMS has been facilitating connectivity among the \nmember countries through the provision of transport infrastructure. Greater connectivity results \nin higher flows of people and goods across borders, bringing both benefits and consequences. \nOne of the most problematic consequences is the spread of communicable diseases such as \nsexually transmitted infections and HIV/AIDS as construction workers, traders, transportation \nproviders, laborers, and service women move into other areas. Busy border crossing areas tend \nto have among the highest prevalence rates of HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases. \n \n31.  Remote Populations. Populations residing in remote locations including border areas \nare often very poor and lack physical access to health-care providers. In parts of the Mekong \nRegion, people may have to travel more than 25 kilometers on foot to a health post. Both public \nand private sector health-care provision decreases as population density falls, as providers find \nit difficult to work in these places. Outreach teams find it difficult to reach remote villages, \nresulting in lower coverage of immunization and other preventive services in these communities. \nQuarantine stations located at borders can help increase coverage for local populations.   ", "8   \n \n32.  Ethnic Minorities. About 60 different ethnic groups live in the GMS. From what is \nknown, they share a high communicable disease burden. Remoteness, migration, language and \nsocial  issues  present  major  obstacles  to  providing  health  care  to  ethnic  minorities.  These \nproblems are compounded by the scarcity of health personnel from ethnic minorities. The Lao \nPDR  has  developed  an  innovative  approach  to  grooming  health  staff  from  ethnic  minority \ngroups, which appears to be working well.  \n \n33.  Poor Women and Children. Gender equity considerations run through all the MDGs, \nincluding the health-related MDGs. Goal 3, to promote gender equality and empower women, \nhas targets and indicators related to gender equality in education and literacy, improvements in \nwomen\u2019s  income,  poverty  related  to  the  share  of  women\u2019s  wage  employment,  as  well  as \nwomen\u2019s representation issues, all of which are important to improving women and children\u2019s \nhealth and the health standards of society overall. Gender considerations are emerging as key \nissues in CDC. It is widely recognized that gender inequality is a principal factor in the HIV/AIDS \npandemic and sexually transmitted infections. Communicable diseases such as malaria are a \nmajor contributing factor to maternal mortality. Youth are also increasingly at risk of HIV/AIDS \nanother infectious because of social changes and increasing travel in the region. Children are \nmore vulnerable to infectious diseases than adults, and to delayed or inappropriate medical \ncare. \n \n3.  Challenges in National Health Systems  \n34.  The ultimate purpose of health sector development is to develop a health system that is \nappropriate to a country\u2019s needs and resources, including those related to infectious diseases. \nCDC has to be an integral part of the health system, and indeed bring about positive changes in \nthe health system as experienced with the HIV/AIDS control program in Cambodia. There are \nmany  generic  issues  in  the  health  system  that  affects  CDC,  including  human  resource \nconstraints,  the  management  of  health  services,  and  affordability  and  financing  of  health \nservices.  CDC  must  also  cope  with  several  specific  challenges  including  (i)  integration  of \ndisease control programs in PHC; (ii) staff constraints for preventive care; (iii) standard setting \nand regulation for CDC, in particular for drugs and for private sector regulation; and (iv) regional \nsurveillance and response.  \n \n35.  The  health systems  in the  three countries  feature  a  dichotomy  between  preventive \nprograms, usually managed centrally, and provincial health services focusing on treatment. The \ncountries lack a comprehensive approach to health system development; as a result, there are \ncoordination  problems  and  inefficiencies  in  the  health  system.  Current  donor  funding \nmechanisms amplify this situation such that periodic ad hoc and unsustainable investments are \nmade in particular programs or disease interventions, to the extent that these also undermine \nother services. Of critical importance in the CLV countries is the development of competent \nprovincial health planning, budgeting, management, and monitoring capacity, with the provinces \nhaving  responsibility  and  authority  for  health  sector  performance,  including  preventive \nprograms. \n \n36.  In all three countries, there is insufficient training and skills in epidemiology among the \nhealth  staff  who  are  responsible  for  disease  programs.  Therefore,  the  countries  tend  to \nparticipate  mainly  in  nationally  organized  activities.  A  challenge  is  to  decentralize  CDC \nmanagement  to  the  provinces,  and  reduce  overlap  in  training,  laboratory  services,  and \nsupervision. Such problems have arisen in part because of the lack of comprehensive and \ncoordinated planning. \n ", "    9\n \n37.  Although the extensive surveillance network covers all levels down to the commune \nhealth centers, the coverage and functioning of the surveillance and response systems need \nstrengthening. This also applies to diseases that receive substantial attention and support. \nSurveillance  is  further  complicated  by  the  use  of  several  separate  systems  for  prioritized \ndiseases that receive financial and technical support from international organizations. As many \npeople, especially in remote regions, use private health-care providers, a significant amount of \ninformation  regarding  communicable  diseases  is  missing  as  it  is  not  part  of  the  current \nsurveillance and response system. The village level appears the weakest link because of the \ngeographical and social barriers, and perhaps the low priority given to prevention. \n \n4.  Shortage of Regional Public Goods \n38.  RPGs receive less attention than global public goods and national public goods, despite \nthe fact that RPGs can help attain global and national public goods. In particular, rates of return \non regional investments are often higher than individual country investments and reduce high \ncosts for smaller economies. This applies equally to RPGs in the health sector. \n \n39.  Clear gaps in RPGs related to health exist within the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations (ASEAN) and the GMS countries. First, there is no comprehensive regional health \ninformation system. Several attempts at regional data and information sharing have been made \n(such as ASEAN Disease Surveillance.net, MBDSP, Asian Collaborative Training Network for \nMalaria  Web  site,  ADB,  and  WPRO);  none  of  these  has  so  far  achieved  a  satisfactory \ninformation  database.  Sharing  of  health  information  will  require  capacity  building  and  also \nconfidence building among the governments. Research with a regional perspective is minimal. \nResearch related to mobility across borders is particularly important for HIV/AIDS. \n \n40.  Aid agencies often prefer to invest in country-focused programs because of the need to \nestablish ownership and the relative ease of arranging lending and grants with a single country. \nBroader-scale health initiatives by the key multilateral institutions tend to be global in scope \ninstead of responding to particular regional needs and solutions. These global initiatives prevail \nover regional ones despite the complexities involved in implementing them worldwide, and they \ntend to lose focus on the \u201cweak links\u201d (i.e., countries with limited capacities) that reduce the \noverall effectiveness of global health initiatives. \n \n41.  The current setting appears in need of regional collaboration in CDC. WHO is revising \nthe IHR. The forthcoming revisions will provide member countries with a common reference \npoint to prevent global health threats and to coordinate international responses to those threats. \nAn important element will be regional capacity building. The recent epidemics have created \nmore political will to exchange information, harmonize quality standards, and learn key lessons \nfrom one another. Additionally, a major landmark was achieved in 2003 when the six GMS \nministers of health signed an agreement to share information as part of the MBDSP financed by \nthe Rockefeller Foundation. Progress in ASEAN and GMS has created a strong institutional \nframework for regional collaboration beyond trade and infrastructure issues.  \n \n42.  Regional cooperation in the health sector among the GMS countries will require building \ntrust and confidence through more frequent and focused dialogue and exchange; developing \nnetworks across the MOHs, public and private health institutes, and other relevant stakeholders; \nlearning  from  one  another\u2019s  experiences;  exchanging  information;  and  embarking  on  joint \nresearch on critical regional health issues. Once the trust and networks are in place, then the \nGMS countries can move on to more challenging regional cooperation health initiatives such as  \nsynchronizing disease control strategies, and setting regional standards for goods and services.   ", "10   \nD.  External Assistance  \n \n43.  The CLV countries receive substantial external assistance to help meet the challenges \nthey face in the health and other sectors. However, assistance for regional CDC has been \nlimited. ADB has provided modest regional support for HIV/AIDS and malaria control.9 Canada, \nthe European Union, WHO and other United Nations agencies also support regional CDC. In \nresponse to the threat of an AI pandemic, ADB, Australia, Canada, France, the European \nUnion, the United States, and the World Bank are planning major support for AI control, some of \nwhich will be regional.   \n \n44.  At country level, total disbursements for Cambodia\u2019s health sector reached $90.3 million \nin 2003, about one third of health spending.10 Major donors are the United States, Japan, and \nthe United Kingdom. ADB supports the Health Sector Support Program (HSSP)11 in partnership \nwith the Department for International Development (United Kingdom) and the World Bank. \nAssistance to HIV/AIDS funding went up from $15 million in 2001 to more than $34 million in \n2003. HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria control will together receive 63% of assistance.12 \nAbout 45% of total donor spending on health is for CDC.   \n \n45.  In the Lao PDR, about one third of health spending is thought to come from external \nassistance. ADB supports PHC development in the northern provinces and is also helping to \nstrengthen PHC planning and management nationwide.13 The Government of Japan provides \nsubstantial support for HRD, child care and education, and infrastructure. External assistance to \nthe Lao health sector, after declining from 1998 to 2003, has improved with new support from \nthe World Bank for PHC development in the southern provinces, and Global Fund assistance for \nmalaria and tuberculosis (but not for HIV/AIDS). About 36% of donor assistance goes to CDC.14   \n \n46.  On an annualized basis, Viet Nam\u2019s health sector received $72 million in assistance in \n2003, which is about 5% of total development assistance.15 By program area, there were 72 \ncommitments for communicable disease projects valued at $155 million at the end of 2003 (14% \nof  total  donor  commitment).  Of  CDC  support,  HIV/AIDS,  malaria,  and  tuberculosis  control \nreceived the greatest levels of assistance. External support is projected to increase from about \n$5 million in 2001 to about $50 million in 2006. About 13% of donor assistance is for CDC. \nAppendix 4 gives a summary of external assistance coordination.   \n \n \n \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2001.

As regional projects are more complex than \nnational projects, there is a risk of following a vertical approach in planning regional projects that \nundermines national efforts for integration and decentralization, and may not be sustainable. On \nthe other hand, regional projects supportive of national programming can work as a catalyst \nthrough  exchanging  ideas,  challenging  governments  and  creating  a  favorable  climate  for \nchange. Strong regional coordination and support as provided in the regional Community Action \nfor the Prevention of HIV/AIDS (footnote 9) has shown to be critical in achieving project impact.  \n \n48.  The CLV countries are slow to start up new projects. Several projects took more than a \nyear to get the implementation arrangements and consulting services in place.16 But after that \ninitial delay, the projects usually proceed well. The proposed project will therefore make use of \nexisting administrative capacity of ongoing projects (footnotes 12, 13, and 16).  \n \n49.  The  public  health  systems  in  CLV  countries  are  facing  serious  staff  and  budget \nconstraints, which in turn affect the capacity of Governments to implement and sustain projects. \nAny project activity should be included in the projections for health sector spending in the \ncoming years, and projects should undertake substantial capacity building at all levels.   \n     \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcomes \n50.  The overall anticipated impact of the GMS Regional CDC Project is to contain the \nspread of epidemic diseases at local level and reduce the burden of common endemic diseases \nin  CLV  countries  by  about  15%  in  the  targeted  provinces,  and  more  for  certain  specific \ninfections. This will help these countries progress toward their health-related MDGs for 2015 of \nreducing the child mortality rate and containing the spread of HIV/AIDS and other infections.17 \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n51.  The expected project outcomes are (i) timely and adequate control of epidemics that are \nlikely to have a major impact on public health and the economy in the region; (ii) improved \ncoverage  of  prevention  and  care  of  communicable  diseases  in  vulnerable  populations,  in \nparticular poor women and children living in border areas; and (iii) improved know-how, policies, \nstandards, and coordination among countries to improve CDC, including for HIV/AIDS, through \nintergovernmental cooperation.  \n \n52.  Activities  under  the  Project  are  pro-poor,  focusing  on  PHC  and  community-based \nactivities in priority provinces. Women and children will be the major beneficiaries of community \ninterventions. Priority will be given to CDC in remote areas including border provinces where \nmany ethnic groups and the poorest reside.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n16  ADB. 2003.

The Project has three components: (i) strengthening national surveillance and response \nsystems; (ii) improving CDC for vulnerable groups; and (iii) strengthening regional cooperation \nin CDC, linking regional, national and provincial levels. In summary, the component outputs are:   \n \n(i)  Comprehensive national surveillance and response systems, including institutional \nstructures;  preparedness,  surveillance,  and  response;  laboratory  services;  and \nHRD\u2014in all three countries nationwide. \n \n(ii)  Expanded and integrated CDC for vulnerable groups in 26 provinces (5 in Cambodia, \n6 in Lao PDR, and 15 in Viet Nam). Most of the project provinces have a high \nproportion of vulnerable groups including ethnic minorities and a high burden of \ncommunicable diseases, and are located along borders or transport corridors.  \n \n(iii)  Productive  regional  coordination  for  CDC18  through  capacity  building  of  MOH, \nregional policy dialogue, support for regional institutions in operations research for \nHIV/AIDS  control  and  other  fields  in  support  of  this  dialogue,  and  project \nmanagement.   \n \n54.   The Project will be implemented over a period of 4 years and will be adjusted yearly on \nthe basis of AOPs to be approved by the national steering committee (SC).   \n \n1.  Component 1: Strengthening National Surveillance and Response Systems \n55.  Component 1 is designed to support the development of national surveillance, response, \nand preparedness systems for communicable diseases in the CLV countries, with a particular \nfocus on preparedness for emerging infectious diseases (e.g., AI, SARS, and dengue) and \nselected endemic diseases such as cholera and typhoid. The activities will mainly involve \nbuilding capacity so that the countries and the region can meet their obligations related to \nimplementing \u201cEarly Warning of Outbreaks and Response Systems,\u201d as required in the draft \nrevisions of the IHR. The component will help develop and implement plans for detecting and \nresponding to emerging infectious diseases, and specifically to the threat of pandemic influenza. \nIt will also help strengthen surveillance of priority diseases not covered by national programs. \nThe four \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d are (i) institutional structures, partnerships, and policies; (ii) systems \nof  surveillance,  response,  and  preparedness;  (iii)  laboratory  services  and  facilities;  and \n(iv) HRD. \n \n56.  The first subcomponent, strengthening institutional structures, partnerships, and policies, \nwill help strengthen communication and collaboration across institutional structures in reviewing \nand revising policies and legislation to facilitate surveillance and response, and in developing \nlong-term strategic plans for controlling communicable diseases. Models and mechanisms will \nbe developed to strengthen partnerships within the health sector and with other sectors. Current \nlegislation and regulations for communicable diseases surveillance and response, including \nthose  related  to  border  quarantine,  will  be  reviewed  and  developed  to  support  the \nimplementation of the revised IHR (once these are endorsed by the WHO Assembly). \n \n57.  The second subcomponent will help strengthen all elements and linkages in the systems \nof surveillance, response, and preparedness. It will be modeled on the WHO guidelines for \n                                                 \n18  The People\u2019s Republic of China, Myanmar, and Thailand will be invited to participate in a regional dialogue. \n ", "    13\nimplementing the IHR. To assess the feasibility of an integrated approach to the surveillance of \nnotifiable diseases, pilot studies will be conducted in 26 provinces and village health volunteers \nwill be trained in surveillance and reporting.19 Community education and mobilization programs \nwill be pilot-tested in selected localities. These will target information on the prevention and \ncontrol  of  communicable  diseases,  and  specifically  on  bird  influenza  and  food  and  water \nhygiene. Preparedness plans for outbreak response, and specifically for pandemic influenza, \nwill be developed and tested in collaboration with the curative services, with local government \nand relevant non-health sectors, and with the community. In Viet Nam, subcomponent 2 will \nalso support eight international quarantine stations and 13 provincial preventive medicine units \nthat perform quarantine activities. Furthermore, a series of three regional technical forums on \nsurveillance and response systems will be held in the three countries. The main purpose of \nthese forums is to coordinate the implementation of project activities under the component, \ndiscuss  emerging  issues,  and  exchange  experiences  and  knowledge  about  ways  of \nstrengthening systems of surveillance, response, and preparedness. \n \n58.  The  third  subcomponent,  strengthening  laboratory  facilities  and  services,  will  help \nstrengthen  the  capacity  of  reference  and  provincial  laboratories  to  diagnose  priority \ncommunicable  diseases,  and  enable  the  laboratories  to  participate  effectively  in  outbreak \nresponse. National systems of quality assurance and bio-safety (including collection, transport, \nand testing of specimens, and waste disposal) will be developed and implemented. Mechanisms \nwill also be developed to facilitate information sharing between laboratories across the country, \nand  between  laboratories  and  the  preventive  health  centers.  A  national  laboratory-based \nsurveillance system for selected pathogens will be developed. The ADB-funded Strengthening \nPreventive  Health  System  Support  Project20  in  Viet  Nam  will  support  the  development  of \nprovincial laboratories and, to a lesser extent, the four regional institutions. In collaboration with \nthis other project, the Project will identify gaps in services across all levels and support their \nstrengthening. \n \n59.  The fourth subcomponent, HRD, will focus on in-service training. The first steps in this \nprocess will be to document the current and the expected future roles and responsibilities of \nstaff at the various levels of the surveillance and response system. The gaps thus identified in \ncurrent  roles  will  form  the  basis  for  customizing  the  training  programs  to  local  needs.  A \ncontinuing  education  program  (in-service  workshops,  outbreak  simulation  exercises,  and \nregional fellowships) will be developed and implemented for all levels of the health workforce, \nincluding hospital and laboratory services. Middle and senior managers will attend international \ncourses in leadership, information management, and the effective use of national data for \nevidence-based policy development, and in health care financing and resource management. \nSupport will be provided to universities and other training institutions for medical professionals in \ndeveloping  and  implementing  undergraduate  curricula  in  surveillance,  response,  and \npreparedness, and in implementing the revised IHR. In Viet Nam, a Field Epidemiology Training \nProgram will be developed, and support will be provided for master\u2019s-level training in public \nhealth and epidemiology in the region and overseas. \n \n2.  Component 2: Improving CDC for Vulnerable Groups  \n60.  This component will reduce the burden of endemic infectious diseases in 26 provinces in \nthe three countries, especially their border provinces with large vulnerable populations. The \ncomponent  will  address  preventable  endemic  communicable  diseases  that  now  receive \n                                                 \n19 See Map and Appendix 4 for characteristics of the selected provinces.  \n20 ADB. 2005.

", "14   \ninsufficient levels of investment and yet (may) cause significant levels of morbidity and mortality \nin poor population groups. Component 2 is divided into three subcomponents: (i) strengthening \nthe capacity for integrated CDC in 26 provinces with a major burden of communicable diseases \nand large vulnerable groups; (ii) controlling priority endemic diseases in priority locations; and \n(iii) improving the continuum of care for HIV/AIDS control in particular \u201chot spots,\u201d and regional \ncoordination  of  HIV/AIDS  control  in  high-risk  populations  related  to  road  access,  migrant \nmovements, and mobile populations.  \n \n61.  The first subcomponent will strengthen the capacity to mainstream IMCI and integrate \nvarious disease control activities (e.g., HIV/AIDS in high-risk groups and endemic diseases) into \nprovincial health services in 26 provinces. CDC is dominated by selected vertical programs for \nmalaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS, and gives much less attention to IMCI for the major health \nproblems of children like acute respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases. The subcomponent \nhas three sets of outputs: (i) mainstreaming CDC in provincial planning and management; \n(ii) providing management tools for integrating CDC in provincial health service delivery; and \n(iii) providing technical, supervision, and quality assurance support for implementation. Many of \nthe 26 provinces are mountainous, with isolated populations that rely on village health workers \nfor health care. The provinces will receive limited additional funds for training and supervision, \nCDC mainstreaming in their health systems, and IMCI expansion. This would help develop the \ncapacity of provinces to scale up CDC. The subcomponent will provide (i) technical assistance \n(TA) and financial support for planning, management, monitoring, and reporting activities; (ii) the \ndevelopment of guidelines and technical manuals and materials; (iii) study tours and experience \nsharing; and (iv) limited investment in equipment and supplies.  \n \n62.  For the second subcomponent, several diseases that pose a heavy burden on poor \ncommunities, many living in border areas, have been identified. While these diseases could be \neradicated or controlled with new medicines and other measures, funding has been lacking, as \nthese are considered minor problems on a national scale. The selection of diseases for the \ncomponent, done in consultation with MOHs, was based on those that are (or could become) \nmajor contributors to ill health in poor populations and children in general, lack significant \nexternal investments for control or elimination, and have demonstrated cost-effective control \nstrategies  involving  communities.  Using  these  criteria,  the  Project  will  support  addressing \n(i) dengue/dengue hemorrhagic fever; (ii) diarrheal diseases; and (iii) worm infections, mainly \nhelminthes,  but  also  the  residual  problems  of  schistosomiasis,  trematode  infections,  and \nfilariasis.21 Behavioral change and communication campaigns for Japanese encephalitis will \nalso  be  supported.  Regional  forums  will  provide  opportunities  for  the  CLV  countries  to \ncoordinate implementation, discuss emerging issues and progress, and exchange experiences \nand knowledge about controlling these diseases. \n \n63.  For the third subcomponent, continuum of care for HIV/AIDS control will be implemented \nin particular \u201chot spots\u201d with high-risk populations and along major transport corridors. Selected \nprovinces will be the focus areas for HIV/AIDS activities under the Project. Activities will include  \nthose targeted for laborers and service women at construction sites, peer education programs, \ntesting and counseling, and treatment with antiretroviral drugs, similar to those in the successful \nADB project (footnote 9). Once again, a series of regional technical forums will be held during \nthe  Project  to  discuss  progress  and  emerging  issues  in  HIV/AIDS.  Additionally,  the \nsubcomponent will link to component 3, operations research for regional HIV/AIDS research and \nrelated activities.  \n \n                                                 \n21 See Appendix 4 for the breakdown of disease interventions in the various provinces.  \n ", "    15\n3.  Component 3: Strengthening Regional Cooperation in CDC  \n64.  The common health sector challenges facing the CLV countries present opportunities for \nintensified or new forms of regional cooperation. The cross-border nature of many diseases \nnecessitates standard setting and joint action. Regional cooperation provides opportunities for \nlearning what works and what does not, provides greater leverage for support, and helps \noptimize the allocation of resources and scale up efforts in key areas that can generate the most \nbenefits.  \n \n65.  An explicit component for regional cooperation in CDC is deemed necessary to provide \nthe leverage and policy focus that specific collaboration on surveillance and disease control may \nlack, and facilitate cross-border dialogue. Hence, the main purposes of this component are to \nenhance  regional  cooperation  in  CDC  among  the  CLV  countries  and  create  sustainable \nfoundations for future cooperation. More specifically, the subsidiary objectives are: (i) increase \ncapacity for health system development in general and health policy and legal frameworks in \nparticular across the region; (ii) promote learning, research, and information exchange across \nthe health sectors of the three countries; and (iii) promote coordination in disease prevention \nand control across borders. \n \n66.  Three subcomponents have been designed: (i) regional coordination for dialogue on \nCDC, (ii) regional operations research and institutional linkages, and (iii) project management. \nThe formulation of subcomponents and their corresponding activities was based on selected \ncriteria, some of which are drawn from the criteria of the GMS Working Group on HRD for \npriority projects. Regional activities should (i) be of national significance to each country and be \nbased on identifiable common interests and goals; (ii) create sustainable foundations (i.e., not \nbe a \u201cone-off\u201d activity); (iii) provide cross-country learning and sharing; (iv) have an impact on \ninequalities within and between the countries; and (v) provide better economies of scale where \napplicable. Overall, regional cooperation should bring added value to national health systems \nand RPGs for health (see also Appendix 5).  \n \n67.  In  response  to  critical  needs  in  the  health  systems  of  the  CLV  countries,  the  first \nsubcomponent will promote regional coordination and peer dialogue among the CLV countries \nand other GMS countries. First, one or two regional SC meetings will be held each year during \nthe Project to assess project implementation and progress, coordinate activities, and identify \nkey issues. The SC will also decide on joint studies. Second, technical forums will be held on \nthe following: (i) specific diseases targeted under the Project, (ii) CDC financing and health \nsystems development, (iii) the targeting of vulnerable groups for health services, (iv) regulations \nand standards in the health sector, and (v) regional surveillance and response for emerging \ndiseases like AI. The main purpose of these forums is to strengthen health systems by (i) \ncarrying out dialogue on the issues; (ii) exchanging ideas and experiences in health policies, \nlaws, financing options, and interventions; and (iii) exploring opportunities to coordinate and \nharmonize policy and legal standards.  \n \n68.  The second subcomponent focuses on regional operations research for HIV/AIDS and \nthe development of linkages among institutions in the GMS for other types of joint research and \ndemand-based initiatives. The Project will support a series of high-quality research studies on \nparticular regional aspects of the HIV/AIDS\u2019s epidemiology in the three countries by building on \nthe extensive database (including baseline and final surveys, prevalence surveys, and records \nof input/output data) generated by JFPR 9006 (footnote 9). Key topics for research include: \n(i) emerging patterns of trafficking in women and the impact on HIV/AIDS, (ii) vulnerability and \nrisk associated with transport corridors, (iii) road construction and other major infrastructure ", "16   \ndevelopment, and (iv) mobility of labor (formal and informal) within and between countries. Also, \nthis subcomponent will promote institutional linkages among health and other institutions in the \nthree  countries  through  an  innovative  approach  to  joint  research  and  the  development  of \nsuccessful  interventions  that  are  based  on  geography  (as  opposed  to  formal  international \nboundaries)  in  cross-border  settings  or  pertain  to  all  three  countries  at  the  national  level. \nConsortia of institutions (e.g., health institutions, health departments, women\u2019s unions, and \nothers) will be invited to develop project proposals and compete for research funds set aside for \nthe Project (a summary of the procedure is in Appendix 5). Priority projects for funding include \nfinancing and health systems development, the targeting of vulnerable groups, cross-border \nhealth issues, and health regulations and standards (such as those for private sector health \nproviders).  \n \n69.  The third subcomponent entails overall project management. The regional SC for the \nProject, based on the committee that oversaw the project preparatory TA for this project, will be \ncontinued. A regional coordination unit (RCU) will be set up in Hanoi. It will function as a \nsecretariat of the regional SC to assist the executing agencies in the CLV countries, coordinate \nthe TA, and provide administrative backstopping. The regional SC meetings will be organized by \nthe agency hosting a particular meeting and the RCU. Additionally, the RCU will be responsible \nfor the regional coordination of the TA, including liaison with stakeholders; data and document \ncollection; support for international consultants; logistics support; and organization of project \nworkshops  involving  all  three  countries.  This  subcomponent  will  also  include  any  required \nproject monitoring and reporting responsibilities not assigned to the CLV countries in their \nindividual agreements with ADB. \n \n70.  Overall, the regional coordination and dialogue component will have four key outputs, \nnamely: (i) greater capacity to strengthen health systems in the region, (ii) greater capacity for \n(and  use  of)  knowledge  sharing  and  institutional  linkages  across  the  CLV  countries, \n(iii) application of \u201cbetter practices\u201d and successful experiences in policies and interventions, \nand (iv) foundations for sustainable and broader health sector cooperation in the future. \n \n71.  Finally,  for Component  3,  it  is  worth  noting  that  ADB  is  now  preparing  a  strategic \napproach to regional cooperation in response to the rapid changes in the international system \nand throughout Asia-Pacific, to position itself both to support existing regional cooperation \ninitiatives and to be prepared to facilitate new forms of regional cooperation that will promote \nregional development. ADB\u2019s Regional and Sustainable Development Department is leading \nthis initiative for an ADB-wide strategic approach to regional cooperation. The draft report (as of \nMarch 2004) of the strategic approach paper advocates focusing on selected priorities and \nRPGs that cut across the Asia-Pacific region, and one suggested priority area is HIV/AIDS. \nHence, the Project would complement the proposed strategic approach.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n72.  Evidently, the first special feature of the Project is the regional approach that it takes to \nCDC  and  health  systems  development.  Typically,  health  systems  improvement  and  CDC \nactivities are conducted in national and local settings. The Project involves regional or bilateral \ninitiatives among the CLV countries, including joint disease control activities and forums for \nexchanging lessons learned and reviewing needs and progress.  \n \n73.  During the GMS HRD working group, all six countries expressed strong support for a \nregional CDC project. However, they decided that the Project would focus on the CLV countries. \nIt  is  hoped  that  a  second  phase  will  include  other  GMS  countries  (PRC,  Myanmar,  and \n ", "    17\nThailand). The Project supports the participation of these countries as observers in the regional \nSCs and as participants in regional technical forums.  \n \n74.  Another feature of the Project is its emphasis on using regional cooperation for national \nhealth systems development. Ultimately, national and local governments are, by and large, \nresponsible for ensuring the health of their citizens, and need to develop the system design, \nlegislation, and resources to make this happen. While health policy and strategies cut across \nborders, health interventions are largely a national, if not local, responsibility. Hence, regional \ncollaboration needs to strengthen national health systems to be relevant, and it is a powerful \ntool for that purpose, through such means as creating a climate of constructive learning and \ncompetition among the countries. \n \n75.  The Project provides important policy support for national health systems development \nthat is in line with the current know-how on improving the effectiveness and efficiency of health \nsystems. It focuses on strengthening the provincial health services using sound management \nprinciples, and on integrating CDC to improve coverage and efficiency.  \n \n76.  Rather than creating a new regional institution, the Project aims to strengthen and \ninstitutionalize regional coordination in MOHs and ensure that it is provided with its own budget, \nstaff, responsibilities, and authority. \n \n77.  The Project will strengthen regional initiatives. Some of these entail obligations deriving \nfrom their membership in global and regional organizations, such as WHO and the ASEAN, \nwhile others are national initiatives supported by a variety of donors. Specifically, the GMS \nGovernments are supporting various initiatives in regional CDC and want to strengthen their \ncollaboration.  They  are  working  toward  a  comprehensive,  sustainable  system  for  regional \ncollaboration in CDC in the GMS and eventually in ASEAN. Most important in the context of \ncontrol of emerging diseases is that WHO will soon require its members to attain the revised \nIHR. The Project will provide important capacity building for IHR. \n \n78.  The Project also has important externalities beyond the health sector, by generating \npolitical goodwill and cooperation among sectors. This will further reinforce the GMS spirit of \npeace, prosperity, and poverty reduction.      \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n79.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $38.75 million, including duties and taxes \n(Table 1). Of the total, $19.73 million, or 51%, is the foreign exchange cost and $19.02 million \nequivalent, or 49%, represents the local currency costs. The first component for surveillance \nand response accounts for 44% of project expenditure, the second component for disease \ncontrol accounts for 44%, and regional cooperation and project management represent 12%. \nTable 2 shows the cost estimates by country.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n81.  The MOH in each country will be the Executing Agency (Appendix 7 provides the project \nstructure).  Each  Executing  Agency  has  overall  responsibility  for  project  coordination  and \nimplementation in each country and will appoint a project director from among its senior officials. \nFor regional activities, 11% of the total project costs, financed from the ADB grant, will be \nmanaged regionally by ADB (para. 89).   \n \n    a.   Cambodia \n \n82.  In Cambodia, the MOH has a policy of harmonizing and integrating projects into regular \nservices and not creating separate project management units. The Project will therefore be \nimplemented through HSSP for national health sector development. HSSP will serve as the \nproject  administrator  representing  the  Executing  Agency,  and  the  Communicable  Disease \nControl Department (CDCD) will be the Implementing Agency (IA). The National Center for \nHIV/AIDS, Dermatology, and Sexually Transmitted Diseases Control; the National Institute of \nPublic Health; the National Center for Parasitology, Entomology, and Malaria Control; and 5 \nprovinces will also serve as IAs. HSSP and CDCD, as the project implementation unit (PMU), \nwill sign an activity-based memorandum of understanding, according to the standard procedure \nfor projects under the HSSP umbrella. The health sector SC for HSSP will review progress and \nguide project implementation. The SC will be chaired by the MOH and will include the secretary \ngeneral for finance of the Ministry of Economy and Finance, two secretaries of state in the \nMOH, two directors general, and the project coordinator of the HSSP. Meetings will be held \nevery 6 months. ADB will receive a copy of the minutes of the SC meeting regarding the Project. \nTechnical working groups for specific disease control activities, such as the national committee \nfor the control of AI, which brings together various ministries, will provide technical guidance.  \n \n83.  The director of the CDCD will be the CDC project director/manager, and this person will \nbe assisted by the directors of the other IAs, and a monitoring and evaluation officer. HSSP will \nbe strengthened with one accountant and one procurement officer for administrative support. \nThe project director/manager will hold monthly project meetings to review implementation and \nreports and agree on the work plan for the next month. The project team will prepare AOPs, \nwhich will be submitted to the SC for approval. At the provincial level, selected activities will be \nimplemented by a \u201cfocal group\u201d in the provincial health departments. For AI, Cambodia has an \ninterministerial task force chaired by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, and a \ngovernment\u2013donor technical coordination committee to guide project activities.     \n     ", "20   \nb.  Lao PDR \n \n84.  In the Lao PDR, the Project will be administered through the Department of Planning \nand  Budgeting  (DPB).  The  Department  of  Hygiene  and  Prevention  (DHP)  will  be  the \ncoordinating IA. The Center for HIV/AIDS/Sexually Transmitted Infections; the National Center \nfor  Laboratory  and  Epidemiology;  the  National  Center  of  Malariology,  Parasitology,  and \nEntomology; and six selected provinces will cooperate with the coordinating IA. The SC of the \nMOH will review progress and guide project implementation. The SC will be chaired by the \nMinister of Health and will include the departmental directors, the Ministry of Finance, the \nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, and the Committee for Planning and Investment. Meetings will be \nheld at least every three months, or more often as required. ADB will receive a copy of the \nminutes of the SC meeting regarding the Project. Monthly technical meetings, to be arranged by \nDHP, will involve the participation of DHP, DPB, and the Lao Resident Mission. DHP will be \nresponsible  for  preparing  a  quarterly  report  and  submitting  it to  the  Executing  Agency  for \nclearance before sending it to ADB.  \n \n85.  The deputy director general of DHP will be the CDC project director, who will be assisted \nby  a  deputy  project  director  and  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  officer.  The  DPM  will  be \nstrengthened with at least one accountant and one procurement officer. At the provincial level, \nselected activities will be implemented by the provincial health offices. For emerging diseases, \nthe Lao PDR has established task forces at various levels, including a ministerial-level task \nforce chaired by the MOH.  \n \n    c.  Viet Nam \n \n86.  In Viet Nam, the Viet Nam Administration of Preventive Medicine (VAPM) will be the  \ncoordinating IA. A PMU will be set up in the VAPM. The National Institute of Hygiene and \nEpidemiology; the National Institute of Malariology, Parasitology and Entomology; the Pasteur \nInstitute in Ho Chi Minh City; the Viet Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Center; and 15 selected \nprovinces will also serve as IAs. The MOH SC for ADB-funded projects will review progress and \nguide project implementation. It will be chaired by the vice-minister of health for preventive \nservices, and include members of VAPM; the Departments of Planning and Finance, Equipment \nand  Construction,  and  Science  and  Training;  the  Ministries  of  Finance  and  Planning  and \nInvestment; and the State Bank of Viet Nam. Meetings will be held every six months. ADB will \nbe provided with a copy of the minutes of the SC meeting. Viet Nam has already established \ntask forces at various levels for AI control, including a ministerial-level task force chaired by the \nMinistry of Agriculture and Rural Development. For HIV/AIDS, the project will coordinate with \nthe national and provincial committees for HIV/AIDS control. \n \n87.  The PMU will have a project director, a deputy project director, a chief accountant, an \naccountant, 2 procurement and planning officers, and 2 monitoring, evaluation, and reporting \nofficers. The project director will hold monthly project meetings to review implementation and \nreports and agree on the work plan for the next month. The IA will prepare AOPs, which will be \nsubmitted to the SC for approval. It will collaborate with other ADB PMUs in the MOH for the \ncapacity building of its staff in ADB procedures, including those for administrative and financial \nmanagement.  At  the  provincial  level,  implementation  will  be  done  through  the  provincial \npreventive medicine centers. These centers will be strengthened with staff, including, as a \nminimum, an accounts officer.  \n \n \n \n ", "    21\n    d.  Regional \n \n88.  The regional CDC SC established under the project preparatory TA will meet every six \nmonths, with the hosting rotated among the three countries. The regional CDC SC is advisory in \nnature. It will give guidance in project implementation, policy dialogue, and the building of \nregional capacity and cooperation for CDC, and will facilitate country decisions on the use of \npooled funds for regional activities. It will be chaired by the minister or vice-minister of the host \ncountry and will consist of leading representatives from the national SCs, project directors, and \nADB and WHO representatives. The RCU will act as the secretariat for regional coordination \nactivities and the management of regional funds, and will include a regional project coordinator, \nan accountant, a procurement officer, and a monitoring and evaluation officer.  \n  \n89.  To facilitate the flow of funds for regional activities, $4.3 million, or 11% of the project \nfunds, will be administered by ADB as a regional CDC fund for regional collaboration, managed \nby the RCU. This fund will cover expenditures for the Project\u2019s regional SC, technical forums, \ninternational consulting services, regional studies, cross-border activities, and the RCU itself. \nADB\u2019s administration of the pooled regional funds is considered necessary for the efficient \nrelease of funds. The regional CDC fund will be financed from ADB\u2019s share of the grant, on the \nbasis  of  a  ratio  of  30:20:50  for  Cambodia,  Lao  PDR,  and  Viet  Nam,  respectively.  The \ncontribution to the RCU and regional activities will follow this ratio, subject to country approval, \nexcept for the financing of studies, which will be decided individually by the countries through \nthe committee. \n \n90.  WHO has been requested to engage and manage nine types of international consulting \nservices, including for surveillance and response, dengue, and endemic diseases, as it has \nspecial expertise in this area. ADB will provide $1.6 million from the regional CDC fund\u2014\nrepresenting $0.48 million of its grant allocation for Cambodia, $0.32 million for Lao PDR, and \n0.80 million for Viet Nam\u2014and WHO will provide $0.9 million, for a total of $2.5 million. This \narrangement has been agreed to by the recipients of the grant and is reflected in the grant \nagreements.  WHO  and  ADB  have  agreed  to  sign  a  project  implementation  agreement \nauthorizing  WHO  to  recruit  and  manage  international  experts  according  to  procedures \nacceptable to ADB and subject to the approval of candidates by ADB (see para. 93). The project \nimplementation agreement specifies, among others, (i) the type of experts to be provided by \nWHO, (ii) the manner in which these experts will operate in close coordination with MOH, and \n(iii) implementation arrangements for the selection of experts, reporting, disbursement, and \nperformance review.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n91.  The Project will be implemented over 4 years, starting in January 2006. The first half-\nyear  activities  will  comprise  the  fielding  of  consultants  and  recruitment  of  staff;  review  of \nbaseline data for monitoring and evaluation; detailed project planning, which will include gender \nand ethnic minority dimensions; curriculum development; and workshops for key implementing \nagents. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 8. \n \n3.  Procurement \n92.  ADB-financed goods and services will be procured according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement and the relevant laws in each country. However, if there is any inconsistency \nbetween ADB\u2019s requirements and the national laws, ADB\u2019s requirements will prevail. Equipment \nwill be procured through (i) international competitive bidding for contracts worth at least $1 ", "22   \nmillion; (ii) international shopping for contracts worth at least $100,000 but less than $1 million \nfor the Governments of Cambodia and Lao PDR, and at least $350,000 but less than $1 million \nfor the Government of Viet Nam; and (iii) local competitive bidding or direct purchase for items \nvalued at less than $100,000 for the Governments of Cambodia and Lao PDR, and less than \n$350,000 for the Government of Viet Nam. Laboratory testing that require the services of the \nPasteur Institute will be done through sole-source procurement. The procurement of equipment \nand supplies will be managed by each MOH as the EA, which may delegate this task to the \nnational institutions and provinces for items valued at less than $20,000 in Lao PDR and \nCambodia, and $50,000 in Viet Nam. The list of procurement packages is in Appendix 9.  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n93.  The Project provides for 238 person-months of international consulting services and \n1,176 person-months of domestic consulting services. Of the international consultants, the \nregional project coordinator, the health system development expert, and the HIV/AIDS chief \ntechnical adviser will be directly engaged by ADB as individual consultants for a total of 68 \nperson-months according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. International experts \nfor  surveillance  and  response,  outbreak  preparedness,  virology,  dengue  control,  control  of \nendemic diseases, legislation, and health information system will be contracted as individual \nconsultants for a total of 170 person-months by WHO as implementing agency according to \nWHO rules and regulations for administrative procedures and practices. ADB-funded experts to \nbe engaged by WHO must have the prior approval of ADB and MOH. Each MOH will engage \ndomestic consultants as individual consultants according to procedures acceptable to ADB. The \noutline terms of reference for consulting services is in Appendix 10.  \n \n  5.  Contracting Research and Training Institutions  \n \n94.  Regional  research  institutions  will  be  contracted  to  study  regional  CDC  issues  and \nstrengthen linkages among health institutions by conducting joint research and programs that \npertain to two or all three countries. Projects will be selected following a competitive process, \nwith proposals invited from consortia of institutions according to a set of clear criteria and \nguidelines issued as part of the study selection process (see Appendix 5). Training will be \nimplemented by government institutions. A list of indicative training packages is in Appendix 11.  \n \n  6.  Accounts and Audit \n \n95.  The Governments will apply sound accounting and auditing standards according to \ninternationally accepted practices. Each MOH has adequate financial management capacity and \nhas gained familiarity with ADB procedures through the implementation of ADB projects. The \nproject  director  in  each  country  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring  proper  records  of  project \nreceipts and expenditures, including the management of sub-accounts. Auditing arrangements \nin the three countries will follow current arrangements with ADB. The Government of Cambodia \nhas currently contracted out auditing to a private accounting firm, but plans to do this through its \nown audit office. In the Lao PDR, the Government will do the auditing according to current \narrangements with ADB. For Viet Nam, the state auditor general of Viet Nam will perform all \nauditing arrangements. WHO has its own internationally accepted accounting and auditing \nstandards. Each IA and WHO will submit the auditors\u2019 reports, copies of the certified accounts \nand related financial statements, including the auditors\u2019 opinion on the use of grant proceeds, \ncompliance  with  grant  covenants,  and  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  statement  of \nexpenditure procedures, to ADB in English within 9 months after the close of each fiscal year.  \n \n ", "    23\n  7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n96.  The  project  management  units  and  the  RCU  will  formulate  AOPs,  complete  with \nexpenditure estimates for each year of implementation. Annual budgets will be reviewed and \napproved by each country\u2019s MOH SC, or in the case of the RCU, by the regional SC, before \nimplementation, and updated after 6 months.  \n \n97.  Each Government will, upon grant effectiveness, open and maintain an imprest account \nin a bank acceptable to ADB or in the treasury, and will also make counterpart funds available. \nThe initial amount to be deposited by ADB in the imprest account of each country will be based \non the estimated expenditure for the first 6 months of project implementation or $900,000 for \nCambodia, $1,000,000 for the Lao PDR, and $2,500,000 for Viet Nam, whichever is lower. The \nimprest account will be established, managed, replenished, and liquidated according to ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook of January 2001, as amended from time to time, and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the MOH of each country and ADB. The statement of \nexpenditure  procedures  will  be  used  for  reimbursing  eligible  expenditures  and  liquidating \nadvances to the imprest account to ensure speedy project implementation. The ceiling on the \nstatement of expenditure per payment is $20,000 for Cambodia and Lao PDR, and $50,000 for \nViet Nam.  \n \n98.  In Cambodia, the MOH will open a project imprest account at the National Bank of \nCambodia, which will be managed by the HSSP administration of MOH. Project funds will flow \nfrom ADB through HSSP to provincial health departments using second-generation imprest \naccounts (SGIAs). In the Lao PDR, the Ministry of Finance will open a project imprest account \nat the Bank of Lao PDR, and DPB of MOH will open an SGIA to manage project funds for MOH \nat any bank. Funds will flow from ADB through the Ministry of Finance to the DPB. In Viet Nam, \nVAPM of MOH will open an imprest account at a commercial bank. Funds will flow from ADB \nthrough the VAPM to national institutions and provinces using SGIAs. The initial amount to be \ndeposited into each of the SGIAs shall be equivalent to 6 months estimated expenditure, but in \nany event not exceeding the equivalent of $20,000 for the provincial SGIAs in Cambodia, \n$250,000 for the DPB SGIA in the Lao PDR, and $50,000 for the national and provincial SGIAs \nin Viet Nam. All commercial banks used for SGIAs must be acceptable to ADB.   \n \n  8.  Reporting  \n \n99.  The CLV Governments will submit annual and semiannual progress reports, and if so \nrequired by ADB will also quarterly reports. The Government of Cambodia will submit biannual \nreports based on the agreed format with the HSSP development partners. The project director \nwill consolidate the reports and address necessary improvements for CDC indicators and the \ninstitutional development aspects of the Project. The progress reports will have information on \nthe physical progress of activities, compliance with grant covenants, organizational and financial \nissues, gender and ethnic minority activities, the proposed program of activities, and expected \nprogress in the next plan period.  \n \n  9.  Project Review \n \n100.  ADB, WHO, and the Governments will carry out project supervisory missions every 6 \nmonths. Before each visit, an updated progress report will be prepared. Reviewers will examine \nrecords of monitoring and evaluation activities and meet with central and local governments, \ncommunity leaders, and project beneficiaries. Within 2 years after project effectiveness, the \nparties  will  undertake  a  comprehensive  midterm  review  to  (i) examine  the  scope,  design, ", "24   \nimplementation  arrangements,  and  other  relevant  issues  in  light  of  the  Governments\u2019 \ndevelopment of CDC strategies and policies; (ii) assess the Project\u2019s progress and achievement \nof  the  objectives;  (iii)  identify  problems  and  constraints;  and  (iv) recommend  any  required \nmodifications, restructuring, and reallocations. \n \n  10.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n101.  Data  collection  will  be  undertaken  to  monitor  progress  in  achieving  the  project \nobjectives. Specifically, the system will provide the Governments, ADB and WHO with the data \nand indicators to monitor project inputs, processes, and outputs as provided in the project \nframework and in key performance indicators to assess the technical, social, and economic \nimpacts of the Project. The Project will conduct baseline and evaluation surveys, drawing upon \nexisting data wherever possible, and collecting new field data only where necessary. Annual \nreports will be submitted to ADB and WHO throughout project implementation; these reports will \ninclude indicators of project completion, delivery, and benefits. The indicative project benefits \nand monitoring and evaluation arrangements are in Appendix 12.  \n \n  11.  Good Governance \n \n102.  The Governments promote good governance, and executing and implementing agencies \nare informed about ADB anti-corruption policy, particularly the section on fraud and corruption, \nas stated in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  \n \n  12.  Capacity of Executing and Implementing Agencies \n \n103.  Each MOH has gained substantial experience in implementing ADB-assisted projects, \nand has staff with training and experience in ADB procedures. Frequent transfer of project \ndirectors is  not  an  issue  in  these  three  countries.  English  language  skills, and  in  general \nfamiliarity with modern administrative and financial management practices, may be improved \nfurther. The Governments have given assurances that capable project staff will be appointed in \na timely manner. The Governments support the decentralization to the provinces, including \ndelegation of financial authorities, for activities to be implemented by the provinces.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n104.  Project Benefits and Beneficiaries. The Project will help improve the health of the \ntargeted  population  and  thereby  increase  their  productivity,  and  help  progress  toward  the \nhealth-related  MDGs.  The  Project  will  improve  prevention  and  control  of  communicable \ndiseases,  intergovernmental  cooperation  in  containing  and  eliminating  diseases,  and  also \ncontribute to strengthening national health systems.  \n \n105.  Activities under the Project are targeted toward the poor in general and those living in \nremote locations including border areas, where many ethnic groups and the most poor reside. \nWomen and children will be the major beneficiaries of these community-level interventions.   \n \n106.  Analysis of Economic and Financial Sustainability. The economic benefits of the \nProject  will  come  from  (i)  helping  prevent  major  epidemics;  (ii) productivity  gains  from  an \nincreased lifespan and reduced mortality; (iii) productivity gains from improved achievements in \neducation, especially through less absenteeism and reduced dropout rates; and (iv) public and \nprivate savings in health expenditures, including indirect costs.  \n \n ", "    25\n107.  The Project\u2019s recurrent costs include integrated service delivery staff costs, procurement \nof medical supplies, and ongoing institutional strengthening costs, which together will account \nfor about $1.7 million in 2009, the year of projection completion. It is envisaged that recurrent \ncosts would be scaled back to about $1.1 million in 2012 as the Project demonstrates the \nbenefits of using items like worm tables and larvicides for dengue and households purchase \nsuch items. The summary economic and financial analysis is in Appendix 13. \n \n108.  Environment. The Project will not have any significant adverse environmental effects. In \ngeneral, it will finance preventive health services, which leave limited by-products, and will help \nsafeguard the environment by putting in place an early warning and response system. This will \nhelp  reduce  the  environmental  costs  of  disease  control,  in  particular  insecticide  spraying. \nProject supervision will closely monitor the issue of medical wastes. \n  \n109.  Social Analysis. The targeted provinces have a high proportion of families living below \nor near the poverty line who depend on subsistence farming for their survival, in particular \namong ethnic minorities. They depend heavily on the availability of a healthy labor force in the \nfamily. Any serious disease or death in the family may throw the family into even deeper \npoverty, malnutrition, and ill health. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in \nAppendix 14.  \n \n110.  Gender. The Project is focusing on health problems of the poor, in particular women and \nchildren, and should not have any adverse social impacts for women and children. The Project \nwill mainstream women\u2019s (including ethnic women) specific health concerns to ensure that \nhealth services take into account their cultural and biological differences. The Project also \nincludes specific interventions benefiting poor children most, such as deworming of school \nchildren.  Prevention  of  disease  and  epidemics  will  generally  help  households  improve \nproductivity, and thereby reduce food shortages. A gender analysis was undertaken during \nproject preparation to ensure that women receive adequate support from the Project (Appendix \n15). Based on this gender analysis, each coordinating IA will prepare country-specific gender \nplans for project implementation. \n \n111.  Ethnic Minorities. Ethnic minorities constitute a major proportion of the population in \nthe three countries, and often reside in relatively remote hills and forests where living conditions \nare  difficult.  They  suffer  disproportionately  from  common  communicable  diseases  such  as \nmalaria, diarrheal diseases, and worm infections, and also have less access to health care \nbecause  of  physical,  financial,  language,  and  cultural  barriers.  The  Project  is  specifically \ntargeting ethnic groups in the selection of provinces, types of interventions, and planning and \nmonitoring arrangements. The ethnic minority development plan is in Appendix 16.   \n \n112.  Risks. The Project has some technical risks in the effectiveness of control measures. \nTechnical risks will be mitigated by partnering with WHO, hiring national consultants for local \ncapacity  building,  and  strengthening  provincial  and  community  involvement.  Institutional \nnetworking and regional collaboration will also help in strengthening stakeholder involvement.  \n \n113.  Previous ADB projects showed project management to be critical to achieving results. \nEach coordinating IA will have a project management unit, which will be supported by existing \nproject  administrative  capacity  in  MOH  in  areas  like  planning,  procurement,  financial \nmanagement, monitoring, and reporting.   \n \n114.  Regional cooperation requires considerable front-end costs with low immediate returns \nbecause of an \u201cincubation period.\u201d However, these costs should be offset by substantial benefits ", "26   \nfrom regional disease control, technology transfer, and strengthened national commitment for \nhealth sector development, all of which will have long-term value across the region. ADB will \nneed to provide substantial support for regional cooperation and ensure that this becomes fully \ninstitutionalized in terms of budget, staff, responsibility, and authority in the ministries. \n \n115.  The sustainability of new services after project completion is a key risk. In Lao PDR, the \nProject will increase the total public health budget by about 4.5% as public health spending is \ncurrently very low. The Government of the Lao PDR is planning a substantial increase in public \nhealth spending over 2006\u20132010. The fiscal situation is expected to have improved substantially \nby  the  time  of  project  completion.  The  Government  of  Viet  Nam  has  updated  Decrees \n73/1999/ND-CP of 18 August 1999 and 10/2002/ND-CP of 16 January 2002 to ensure the \nimplementation  of  Resolution  05/2005/NQ-CP  of  18  April  2005  to  improve  health  sector \nfinancing.  Each  Government  is  committed  to  sustaining  the  capacity  for  operating  the \nsurveillance and response and integrating CDC systems in the targeted provinces. Supplies of \nessential drugs, a direct pro-poor intervention, will be the major items of recurrent costs. The \nProject  will  help  the  Governments  plan  for  these  supplies,  and  will  also  encourage  self-\ntreatment where applicable and preventive health behavior to contain recurrent costs. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Special Assurances \n116.  In addition to the standard assurances, the CLV Governments and MOHs have given the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n117.  Annual Planning and Reporting.

Each Government will screen any proposed civil works and ensure that \ninvoluntary resettlement impacts are avoided. If involuntary resettlement is unavoidable, each \nGovernment  will  prepare  a  resettlement  plan  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement and submit it to ADB for approval prior to commencing land acquisition activities. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  resettlement  plan  will  include  detailed  measurement \nsurveys, compensation unit rates based on replacement cost surveys for all categories of losses \nand allowances and a final database of affected persons. \n \n127.  Environment. Each Government, through MOHs, will ensure that the operation of all \nhealth facilities will comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the respective countries;  \nADB\u2019s environmental policies and regulations, specifically ADB\u2019s Environment Policy, 2002; the \nsummary initial environmental examination; and environmental management plan.  \n \n128.  Accounting  and  Audit.  Each  Government  will  apply  sound  accounting  standards \naccording to internationally accepted practices. Each Government will submit annual audited \nreports within 9 months of the last date of the previous project year.  \n \n129.  Project Sustainability. Each Government will ensure that sufficient funds are available \nto sustain project activities after project completion.  \n \nB.  Conditions for Grant Effectiveness \n130.  The following actions will be required prior to grant effectiveness; \n \n(i)  Each  MOH  will  have  issued  clear  guidelines  for  implementing  the  Project, \nspecifying the roles and responsibilities of the EAs, IAs, and other agencies \nconcerned; and the arrangements for the Project\u2019s fund flow.

The health of a population is a critical determinant of a country\u2019s capacity for social and \neconomic development, and is therefore also a key factor in shaping regional cooperation. At \nmeetings of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), leaders have expressed concerns about the \nhealth sector and identified many regional threats, as well as opportunities, that would greatly \nbenefit from regional cooperation. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) accordingly funded a \nproject preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) for the GMS Regional Communicable Diseases \nControl (CDC) Project1 to analyze the health sector and identify regional health sector priorities \nin three countries\u2014Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), and Viet \nNam. \n \n2.  Newly  emerging  diseases  such  as  avian  influenza  and  severe  acute  respiratory \nsyndrome (SARS) pose new threats to the region\u2019s population and challenges for disease \ncontrol.  Although  these  diseases  have  not  caused  major  fatalities2  compared  to  malaria, \ntuberculosis, acute respiratory infections (ARI), diarrheal diseases, and other, more common \ninfectious diseases, the evident economic impact and the potential for a regional or global \npandemic are making avian influenza (and previously SARS) high priorities among national \nhealth  systems  and  international  health  institutions.  This  is  particularly  so  because  early \nrecognition and referral at the community level is required to avert these diseases that have \nhigh  case  fatality  and  potential  for  a  rapid  epidemic.  In  the  region,  community-based \nsurveillance, preparedness, and response are underdeveloped.  \n \n3.  Nonetheless, it is the ordinary endemic diseases like pneumonia and diarrheal diseases \nthat exact a heavy toll on the population, in particular children. In Cambodia and Lao PDR, \ncommunicable diseases are the most common causes of morbidity and mortality. According to \nmost recent statistics of the World Health Organization (WHO), ARI, diarrheal diseases, and \nmalaria are the most common causes of morbidity in Cambodia, while malaria, ARI, and road \naccidents cause the most deaths. HIV/AIDS3 is not in the top five, but may be masked by ARI, \ntuberculosis, or even road accidents. In Lao PDR, malaria, pneumonia, and gastrointestinal \nproblems  cause  the  most  morbidity  and  mortality.  In  Viet  Nam,  which  has  better  health \nindicators overall, pneumonia, acute pharyngitis, and ARI are the common causes of morbidity, \nwhile  intracranial  injury,  road  transport  accidents,  and  pneumonia  are  common  causes  of \nmortality.4 \n \n4.  Perhaps  because  they  are  relatively  easy  to  prevent  and  treat  with  low-cost \ninterventions, common infections receive less priority than diseases such as HIV/AIDS and \navian  flu.5  There  is  a  potential  danger  that,  as  with  the  polio  eradication  campaign,  new \ndiseases will absorb a considerable level of commitment, staff time, and funding at the cost of \naddressing common illnesses. As Table A3.1 shows, coverage indicators for routine preventive \nand curative services are still low.

Physical accessibility to and by healthcare providers is a key issue for many border \npopulations.  Both  public  and  private  sector  healthcare  provision  decreases  as  population \ndensity falls. Despite the advances over the past decade in building more roads across GMS \nborders, many of the more remote communities are still beyond the reach of conventional health \nservices. They are increasingly being reached through community health workers, village health \nvolunteers, and drug shops, not institutional services.   \n \nTable A3.1: Coverage of Health Services \n \n  Cambodia  Lao PDR  Viet Nam \nIndicator  %  Year  %  Year  %  Year \nMeasles vaccination coverage  65  2003  42  2003  93  2003 \nin children 12\u201323 years of age \nSecond tetanus vaccination for  43  2003  36  2003  79  2003 \npregnant women  \nUse of modern contraceptives  19  2003  29  2003  56  2003 \namong married couples \nAccess to safe water  30  2000  50  2002\u20132003  56  2002 \nAccess to sanitation  21  2000  51  2002\u20132003  73  2000 \nAccess to essential drugs   50  2003  80  2004  85  2004 \nLao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \nSources: ADB Country Program Reports; and www.unicefusa.org. \n \n6.  Even where sufficient coverage is achieved, it does not imply that good quality care is \navailable. In fact, given human resource, financial, and supply constraints, and the general lack \nof  consumer  education  on  what  constitutes  good  health  care,  the  effectiveness  of  these \ninterventions is less than would be assumed. The rise of the private sector, while greatly helping \nto improve coverage, further raises the risk of reduced quality of care, over-prescription with \npossibly medical consequences, and income erosion. Furthermore, there are also no reliable \ndata on the quality of health services, public or private, so the situation is difficult to track.  \n \n7.  Compared with typical health sector problems of management and resources, the issues \nin CDC are somewhat different and have to do with the way CDC is fragmented and donor-\ndriven, with limited accountability and authority at the local level.  \n \nB.  Communicable Diseases Control \n \n8.  In the late 1980s, WHO and partners introduced the concepts of \u201cprimary health care \n(PHC)\u201d and the \u201cdistrict health system\u201d toward health for all. These concepts are still highly \nrelevant and form the central pillars of country health policies today. However, support for PHC, \nfor a variety of reasons, was increasingly replaced by a more selective approach focusing on \ndiseases or subsectors. CDC was increasingly organized through vertical programs for quicker \nimpact. The programs included the expanded program of immunization, the tuberculosis control \nprogram, the malaria control program, and the HIV/AIDS control program. There were also \nprominent programs for child survival, focusing on ARI and diarrheal diseases control, followed \nby the introduction of tools for the Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI), and \nagain, recently, a new regional strategy for child survival.   \n \n9.  The organizational structures of the health systems in the three countries present a \nmajor institutional divide between curative and preventive services, from central to provincial ", "  Appendix 3  35\n \nand down to the district level. This may have helped to provide focus on preventive health \nservices at first. Yet, it did not solve the funding resource constraints of preventive services and \nthe less economically attractive human resource constraints. It also resulted in higher delivery \ncosts, as different providers were used for specific but basic interventions. The same holds true \nfor  laboratory  services,  training,  and  supplies.  Heavily  funded  programs  such  as  polio \neradication also undermined regular services.  \n \n10.  Nowadays, vertical programs are increasingly being integrated with provincial health \nservices.  Interestingly, this  trend  emerged  in part  from  the  managers  of  vertical  programs \nthemselves, who realized that it was very difficult to improve coverage without pooling resources \nat the local level and allowing for decentralized management. The three countries have initiated \nseveral initiatives in this respect. \n \n  1.  CDC in Cambodia \n \n 11.  The institutional setup in the three countries is broadly similar. In Cambodia, the CDC \nDepartment has overall responsibility for surveillance, response, and preparedness through \nthree bureaus: (i) Bureau of CDC and Prevention, (ii) Bureau of Disease Surveillance, and \n(iii) Bureau of Quarantine. In addition, there are national programs for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, \nand  leprosy,  and  for  malaria,  dengue,  and  schistosomiasis.  The  national  programs  are \nindividually responsible for surveillance and control activities for these diseases. The Maternal \nand Child Health Unit is responsible for surveillance and control of cholera and other diarrheal \ndiseases, ARI, and vaccine-preventable diseases (of the National Immunization Program). This \nstructure presents challenges for institutional coordination of activities, including surveillance \nand response.  \n \n12.  The 24 provincial health departments support 67 operational districts in implementing \nthe National Health Policy and ensure equitable distribution of resources. The provinces and \ndistricts do not have dedicated staff for surveillance and response activities. These functions are \nusually allocated to staff in the national programs and the maternal and child health programs. \nThere are three to five staff members working on the national programs at the provincial level \nand three to four staff members at the operational district level. The Ministry of Health (MOH) \nhas created village health groups to promote health in the villages. However, compared with \nother  countries,  Cambodia  provides  modest  village  health  care  at  best.  Community \norganizations are small. There is substantial reliance on the private sector, but it is not part of \nthe reporting system.  \n \n13.  The Government has successfully launched an integrated initiative called the Health \nSector  Support  Plan  (HSSP)  for  2003\u20132007,  which  provides  the  basis  for  sector-wide \nmanagement  and  an  umbrella  framework  for  health  activities  under  the  National  Poverty \nReduction Scheme. The Department of Planning and Health Information has developed the first \nAnnual Operational Plan for 2005. The Annual Operational Plan integrates the implementation \nof HSSP strategies by the various health institutions in Cambodia, within the Medium-Term \nExpenditure Framework.6 MOH delineated 12 priority activities for the health sector, including \npromoting village health support groups and health center management committees, improving \nIMCI, improving consumer confidence in health services, and improving ethical conduct.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n6  Ministry of Health, Government of Cambodia. 2005. Pushing the Momentum for Health Sector Development: The \nFirst Health Sector Annual Operational Plan, 2005. Phnom Penh. ", "36   Appendix 3 \n2.  CDC in Lao PDR \n \n14.  The Department of Hygiene and Prevention under MOH has the main responsibility for \norganizing preventive health services. MOH has 10 affiliated centers, among them the National \nInstitute  of  Public  Health;  National  Center  of  Malarialogy,  Parasitology  and  Entomology; \nNational  Center  for  Laboratory  and  Epidemiology;  and  Center  for  HIV/AIDS/Sexually \nTransmitted Infections. The Government has delegated strategic planning to the 18 provinces, \nand operational management to the districts. The provincial health offices have administrative \nand  technical  responsibilities  for  public  health  services  within  their  provinces,  including \nmanaging units for hygiene and prevention, malaria, and expanded program of immunization. \nEach district health office, with four to five healthcare workers, is responsible for coordinating \nhealth services in its district. CDC is promoted through health centers, health committees, \nvillage health volunteers, and mass organizations (e.g., women and youth unions).  \n \n15.  The health sector is one of four priority sectors in the \u201cNational Growth and Poverty \nEradication Strategy.\u201d The \u201cHealth Sector Strategy to the Year 2020\u201d is one of the key policy \ndocuments7 and is based on four overriding concepts related to healthcare: (i) full coverage and \nservice equity, (ii) early integrated services, (iii) demand-based services, and (iv) self-reliant \nservices. On the basis of these concepts, the Health Sector Strategy identifies six policy areas, \nincluding improving community-based health promotion and disease prevention, and ensuring \nthe quality, safety, and rational use of food and drugs.  \n \n16.  The system is not performing well, as can be seen from the low immunization rates and \nother shortcomings. In particular for remote areas, CDC programs must be integrated to be \neffective. While much capacity building has been achieved in the past decade, the capacities of \nall levels are still seriously constrained. One issue is staff skills. Another is low pay, combined \nwith limited opportunities for income-generating activities in rural areas except farming. The \nGovernment is also facing serious fiscal constraints. Hence, the number of health workers \ncannot be expected to increase significantly in the medium term, although the Government has \nexpanded training for ethnic minority students. The private sector offers other challenges, such \nas the sale of imported counterfeit malaria drugs, which may be a major cause of death in Lao \nPDR. \n  \n3.  CDC in Viet Nam \n \n17.  Among the 14 departments of MOH, the Viet Nam Administration of Preventive Medicine  \n(VAPM) leads the preventive subsector, while Drug Administration, Food Safety and Hygiene, \nthe Center of Health Education, and others also play significant roles. VAPM is responsible for \nthe overall management and supervision of communicable disease surveillance activities. The \npreventive health system includes services delivered by preventive institutions (12 preventive \nmedicine  institutes  and  2  centers)  and  specific  health  programs.  A  network  of  preventive \ninstitutions covers all levels from the central level down to district level. This fragmentation has \nhigh transaction costs and makes planning difficult. However,  this structure is firmly entrenched \nand    integration  will  be  difficult.  The  Government  is  considering  setting  up  a  separate \nDepartment of HIV/AIDS Control. Given the multi-sectoral perspective of HIV/AIDS and the size \nof the program, this move may be justifiable. However, there is a risk in taking HIV/AIDS out of \nprovincial programs.   \n \n18.  PHDs develop annual plans for health services and programs and are responsible for \nmanaging  and  directing  health  care  at  the  provincial  level.  They  manage  the  provincial \n                                                 \n7 Formulated in May 2000. ", "  Appendix 3  37\n \npreventive  medicine  centers  and  other  facilities.  The  preventive  medicine  centers  provide \npreventive health services, including surveillance for the 24 notifiable diseases. They are also \nresponsible for laboratory services. An epidemiological team monitors diseases and responds to \noutbreaks. The district health centers manage and direct health care at the district level. The \ndistrict preventive health teams provide services such as immunization and control of diarrheal \ndiseases, malaria, vitamin A deficiency, and iodine deficiency disorders. The district preventive \nteams consist of five to seven technical staff members. VAPM plans to establish separate \ndistrict preventive centers.  \n \n19.  The commune health center is the lowest level healthcare facility of the public health \nsystem. It is responsible for the primary level of care in the community, including preventive \ncare, normal delivery, drug provision, family planning, and other PHC activities. Viet Nam has \nmore than 10,500 commune health centers, but many of them do not have medical doctors and \ninstead are staffed with assistant doctors and nurses. Village health workers are an integral part \nof the health system in implementing PHC in the community, facilitating outreach programs, and \nconducting environmental health efforts. The current network of village health workers covers \n80% of the villages. While the system is well established and can serve as a model, it needs to \nbe more locally driven rather than simply responding to instructions from above, and it needs \nmore tools and support.  \n \n20.  The National Strategy for People\u2019s Health Care and Protection 2001\u20132010 sets forth \nmore  specific  health  targets  and  strategies.  This  medium-term  strategy  explicitly  calls  for \n(i) reducing morbidity and mortality caused by malaria, dengue fever, hepatitis, and Japanese \nencephalitis;  (ii)  curbing  the  increase  of  HIV/AIDS;  (iii)  preventing  and  controlling  non-\ncommunicable diseases; (iv) improving equity of access to and use of health services; and (v) \nenhancing the quality of health care. Specifically for the preventive health system, Viet Nam \nprepared in 2004 the \u201cMaster Plan on Development of the Preventive Health Network in Viet \nNam by 2010 and Vision by 2020.\u201d The specific objectives of the plan include, among others, \nstrengthening the capacity of preventive medicine at the district level to implement epidemic \nprevention activities in the communities.  \n \nC.  Reasons for Regional Cooperation in CDC \n21.  Communicable diseases do not stop at borders. HIV/AIDS, the SARS crisis in 2003, and \nmore recent concerns about avian flu have highlighted the importance of regional cooperation in \nCDC. Countries are responding to their own limitations and vulnerabilities to the spread of \ninfections from outside their borders by working more closely together. The rapid identification of \na disease outbreak and a coordinated regional response will significantly contain the adverse \nhealth  and  economic  effects  on  populations.  Programs  for  the  prevention  and  control  of \ncommunicable disease outbreaks are, therefore, regional public goods (RPGs), and not merely \nnational public goods. \n \n22.  Common health sector challenges facing Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam give rise to \nopportunities (and demand) for new forms of regional cooperation. The cross-border nature of \nmany diseases, the need for more efficient allocation of limited resources through economies of \nscale, and the necessity for joint actions to prevent or contain disease outbreaks are among the \nbroad reasons for greater regional cooperation among countries in health matters. \n \n23.  For example, people in border areas nowadays cross borders frequently to work, sell or \nbuy goods, engage in road or other infrastructure development, and use the new infrastructure, \nthus facilitating the spread of communicable diseases and making it difficult to treat infected ", "38   Appendix 3 \npeople. New markets along roads and borders also increase the exposure of previously isolated \ncommunities to communicable diseases. Containment of infected people is complicated by \nlimited access to treatment in an area. Common vectors and environments in border districts \nmay lead to transmission. The focus of disease control, therefore, needs to be geographic \nrather than being based on formal boundaries. The health officials of a country must operate in \nunaccustomed ways. Perhaps most importantly, countries can learn from one another what \nworks in matters ranging from the health education needs of ethnic minorities to health sector \nfinancing. Common standards will make it easier for countries to coordinate and exchange staff, \ninformation, services, and goods. Differences in health policies, such as the cost of treatment, \nand  in  the  quality  of  service  may  push  residents  of  border  areas  to  seek  treatment  in  a \nneighboring  country.  And  finally,  working  together  will  provide  important  leverage  and \neconomies of scale.  \n \nD.  New International Health Regulations \n24.  Emerging infections such as SARS, Nipah virus infections, Japanese encephalitis, and \nhuman cases of avian influenza, and epidemic diseases such as meningitis, cholera, typhoid \nfever, and dysentery pose a growing threat to the health of the world\u2019s populations. Their early \nrecognition is often difficult and their containment challenging. Responding appropriately to \nthese infectious threats requires better structures, coordination among health systems, and \nworkforce development to strengthen disease control. \n \n25.  To strengthen national and global health security, epidemics must be contained at their \nsource  and  their  potential  to  spread  in  the  local  and  international  communities  must  be \nminimized. Countries need to increase their capacity for rapid detection and timely response to \npublic health emergencies. They also need to enhance coordination and cooperation with one \nanother in tackling cross-border diseases.  \n \n26.  The recently revised Internal Health Regulations (IHR) provide the legal framework for \nactions to prevent the international spread of disease. Countries will be expected to establish \nand maintain minimum core surveillance and response capacities to successfully implement the \nglobal health security, epidemic alert, and response strategy. These requirements entail (i) at \nthe  community  level,  detecting  illnesses  and  deaths  above  expected  levels  and  reporting \ninformation to appropriate local health personnel; (ii) at the primary public health response level, \nverifying reported events, implementing immediate control measures, and reporting information \nto the national level; and (iii) at the national level, assessing all health event reports within 24 \nhours and reporting public health emergencies of international concern to WHO. The revised \nIHR provide a decision instrument to assist countries in assessing events and immediately \nnotifying  WHO  about  events  that  could  signify  a  \u201cpublic  health emergency  of international \nconcern.\u201d The latter phrase is fully defined in the draft IHR. \n \n27.  WHO guidelines (available in draft form since February 2004) provide countries with the \ndetailed technical information and understanding needed to establish functions that will meet \ntheir capacity requirements. The revised IHR were endorsed by the World Health Assembly in \nMay 2005, with a proposed implementation date in 2006. WHO will support countries in building \nthe technical capacity to comply with the revised IHR. \n \nE.  Current Regional Cooperation Initiatives in CDC \n \n28.  Table A3.2 presents a brief summary of regional CDC initiatives in the GMS countries. \nADB, for the past 13 years, has supported the GMS Program including the health sector, ", "  Appendix 3  39\n \nnotably through the Phnom Penh Plan for leadership training, JFPR 9006: Community Action for \nHIV/AIDS Prevention8, malaria control, and other initiatives. \n \nTable A3.2: Selected Current Regional Collaboration Arrangements  \nin the Mekong Region \n \nRegional Agency  Priorities/Functions \nADB  Regional functions are to mobilize resources to finance regional cooperation, facilitate \ndialogue and participation, and provide information to member countries.

A major challenge is the absence of a coordinated donor approach.9 Also, despite the \nplethora of health information initiatives, there is no comprehensive regional health information \nsystem. A third gap is research with a regional perspective. Studies on mobility across borders \nand infrastructure development and on the crucial factors in the transmission of diseases across \nborders are particularly important for HIV/AIDS. \n \nF.  Challenges in Regional Cooperation \n30.  Cooperation in the health sector among the CLV countries is still in a nascent stage of \ndevelopment. The memoranda of understanding for health sector cooperation are relatively \nrecent, and the agreed-upon frameworks have in most instances not been followed up with \nsufficient action or details about how the frameworks should be implemented. One of the critical \nsuccess factors in new formal cooperation arrangements is the prior existence of informal \nnetworks across the participating countries. The absence of such networks typically causes a \nlag between when the cooperative framework is established and when it is acted on and the \nbenefits are manifested, because the necessary linkages must first be developed between \ninstitutions. This is clearly true of the health ministries, laboratories, and institutes in the CLV \ncountries. The networks are not in place because of limited opportunities for interfacing at the \ntechnical level. Therefore, high-level political agreements to cooperate in the health sector are \nunlikely to bear much fruit until networks and linkages develop among the technical health \nspecialists. \n \n31.  RPGs receive less attention than global and national public goods. In particular, rates of \nreturn on regional investments are often higher than individual country investments and reduce \nthe  costs  for  smaller  economies.  Global  initiatives  prevail  over  regional  ones  despite  the \ncomplexities involved in implementing them worldwide, and they tend to lose focus on the \u201cweak \nlinks\u201d (i.e., countries with limited capacities) that make global health initiatives less effective. \nClear  gaps  in  health  RPGs  exist  within  ASEAN  and  the  GMS  countries.  There  is  no \ncomprehensive regional health information system, and research with a regional perspective \n(e.g., on migrants and HIV/AIDS) is lacking. Another challenge to the provision of RPGs is the \nlack  of  coordination  among  external  agencies.  The  purpose  of  the  regional  strategy  is  to \ndevelop a comprehensive framework to give people in the Asia-Pacific better protection from \nemerging diseases. The focus will be on preventing, detecting, and controlling the emerging \ndiseases that are posing new threats and challenges to the people and health systems in the \nregion. \n \n32.  The current setting favors regional collaboration in CDC. The recent epidemics have \ncreated more political will to exchange information, harmonize quality standards, and learn key \nlessons from one another. Moreover, progress in ASEAN and GMS has created a strong \ninstitutional framework for regional collaboration. A third factor is WHO\u2019s revised IHR. GMS \ncooperation in the health sector should focus on building up the foundation for more effective \n                                                 \n9 The WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific and the Southeast Asia Regional Office of the World Health \nOrganization are now preparing an Asia-Pacific strategy for emerging diseases. ", "  Appendix 3  41\n \nand sustainable collaboration. This will require building trust and confidence through more \nfrequent and focused dialogue and exchange; developing networks across the ministries of \nhealth, health institutes, and other stakeholders; learning from one another\u2019s experiences; and \nembarking on joint research on critical regional health issues. Once the trust and networks are \nin place, then the GMS countries can move on to more challenging regional cooperation on \nhealth  initiatives  such  as  sharing  of  data  systems,  standardization  of  health  policies  and \nregulatory frameworks, and coordination of responses to outbreaks of disease.

Disbursements to the Cambodian health sector in 2003 were estimated to amount to \n$90.3 million, coming mainly from the United States ($22 million), Japan ($8 million), United \nKingdom ($7 million), World Health Organization (WHO) ($4 million), and World Bank ($3 \nmillion).1 This estimate is close to the $103 million estimate provided by the Organization for \nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD)2 for external assistance to Cambodia for \nhealth, nutrition, and population.3 See Figure A4.1. \n \n \nFigure A4.1: Cambodia Health Assistance, by Donor and \nby CDC Allocation, 2003 \n \nWorld  ADB \nBank  2% Japan HIV/AIDS \n3%  9% 38% \nUK\n8%\nOther \n49% \nNon CDC\n55%\nMalaria\nUS\n25% TB  2% \nWHO  EPI 2% \n4%  3% \n \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CDC = communicable diseases control, EPI = Expanded Program on \nImmunization, HIV/AIDS = human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, TB = \ntuberculosis, UK = United Kingdom, US = United States, WHO = World Health Organization. \nSource: Government of Cambodia. 2004.

The country\u2019s Annual Operational Plan for 2005 indicates that the national tuberculosis \nprogram will receive $6.8 million (22%); malaria, dengue, and schistosomiasis, $4.6 million \n(15%); and the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Dermatology, and Sexually Transmitted Diseases \nControl, $7.8 million (26%).6 Donors provide about 50% of all support for national programs, \nwith $3.3 million being channeled through the Health Sector Support Program, and a further \n$12.7 million through the wider donor community.  \n \nB.  External Assistance to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR)  \n \n4.  Estimates of per capita expenditures on health are around $10-$12 per year. Of this \namount, 21\u201335%7 is thought to come from donors. In 1998, total external assistance was \nestimated to be $13.7 million in 1998, with key donors being the World Bank (15%), ADB (8%), \nAustralia (11%), Sweden (13%), and Japan (8%).8  Since then, contributions from Australia, \nGermany,  the  European  Union,  Sweden  and  the  World  Bank  have  been  discontinued  or \nreduced substantially. Estimated external assistance to health, nutrition, and population in the \nLao  PDR  reduced  to  $8.9  million  in  2003  OECD9,  or  8%  of  all  overseas  development \nassistance. Since 2004, external assistance for the sector has been improving, and is likely to \nreach about $15 million in 2005. \n \n5.  Total obligated funds for 2006-2010 amount to $99.3 million. Major donors are the \nGlobal Fund ($16.6 million), the World Bank ($15 million), ADB ($12.7 million), the Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency  ($11.4  million),  the  Global  Alliance  for  Vaccination  and \nImmunization ($6.8 million), the Government of Luxembourg ($5.0 million), the Government of \nIndia ($4.9 million), and the Belgium Technical Cooperation ($4.2 million). Substantial additional \nfunding is expected from ADB, Australia, Canada, the United States and the World Bank for \navian influenza, HIV/AIDS, and health sector development. The share of donor assistance for \nCDC is estimated to be 36%, compared to 38% in 1998, but is likely to increase substantially for \navian  influenza  and  HIV/AIDS.  Excluding  spending  on  global  public  goods  such  as  avian \ninfluenza control, total per capita spending on health is expected to double over the next 5 \nyears, to reach a level comparable with current spending in Viet Nam, and about half the \nrecommended international minimum level of spending on health care. As fiscal constraints are \nlikely to persist over the next five years, external assistance will remain a major component of \nthe public health budget and as such will need to be carefully balanced between investment and \nrecurrent  spending.  Indeed,  a  substantial  share  of  external  assistance  will  be  required  to \noperate and improve the quality of current health services, and make health services affordable \nfor the poor.  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n6  Ministry of Health, Cambodia. 2004.

Key donors to the Viet Nam health sector in 2003 included ADB with a commitment of \n$120 million; the World Bank, $286 million; Japan, nearly $150 million; and the European Union. \nTotal donor commitment to the health sector in 2003 was $1,083 million.10 The World Bank and \nthe  United  Nations  Population  Fund  are  the  largest  donors  in  this  program  area.  On  an \nannualized basis, OECD estimated that the Viet Nam health sector received $72 million in \nassistance  in  2003.

At that time, the World Bank (with \n27% of all assistance) and Japan (18%) were major external supporters of the health sector.11 \nWHO (2004) estimates external assistance to the health sector in 2001 at $43 million, much \nlower than the values suggested for 2003.12 OECD data indicate that levels of assistance have \nbeen increasing since 2000.

By  program  area,  at  the  end  of  2003  communicable  diseases  had  72  project \ncommitments, valued at $155 million (14% of total commitments). The mother and child health \nprogram attracted the most external assistance, with commitments of $364 million in 2003. Of \nCDC support, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis receive the most assistance. With more \nHIV/AIDS funding coming in over the last 1\u20132 years, the level of resources devoted to this \ndisease has increased dramatically. Public sector budget allocations have increased, from $4 \nmillion in 2001 to more than $5 million in 2004. External support is also increasing quickly, from \naround $5 million in 2001 to a projected $50 million in 2006. \n \n9.  Agencies involved in regional assistance are discussed in Appendix 3, Health Sector \nAnalysis, para 28. Since the preparation of this project proposal, several countries or their aid \nagencies have taken or proposed new regional initiatives in response to an increasing likelihood \nof an avian influenza pandemic, including Australia, Canada, the European Union, France, and \nthe  United  States.  Five  Mekong  countries  themselves  (excluding  the  People\u2018s  Republic  of \nChina) have established a public health working group under the Ayeyawady-Chao Phraya-\nMekong Economic Cooperation Strategy (ACMECS). This working group will be focusing on \nCDC, in particular avian influenza, HIV/AIDS, and malaria control. In addition, Governments \nhave signed various bilateral agreements for cross-border cooperation which are often dormant \ndue to a lack of funding and staff resources.      ", "46   Appendix 5 \nREGIONAL DIALOGUE AND COOPERATION \n \nA.  Regional Cooperation and Capacity Building \n \n1.  The Regional Communicable Diseases Control (CDC) Steering Committee established \nunder the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) will continue to meet every 6 months \nin the first year of the Project, and at least once a year in later years, with hosting rotated among \nthe three countries. The Regional CDC Steering Committee will provide guidance on project \nimplementation, policy dialogue, and the building of regional capacity and cooperation for CDC. \nIt will be chaired by the minister or vice-minister of the host country and will consist of leading \nrepresentatives from the national steering committees, project staff, and Asian Development \nBank (ADB) representatives. \n \n2.  The CDC Project, as a regional project, presents unique opportunities for collaboration \namong participating countries, as well as a set of challenges to inter-country cooperation. CLV \ncountries  lack  a  formal  institutional  arrangement  for  responding  to  communicable  disease \noutbreaks at the regional level, but several bilateral arrangements are in place. The Project will \nsupport regional cooperation for CDC by further institutionalizing regional collaboration as a \nstandard feature of ministries of health (MOHs). This requires each MOH to strengthen its \ninstitutional capacity for regional collaboration in terms of structure, staff, budget, authority, and \nresponsibilities. No new separate institutions are being proposed. The regional coordinator will \nbe responsible for building capacity for regional dialogue and cooperation in each MOH. \n \nB.  Management of Regional CDC Funds \n3.  To facilitate the flow of funds for regional activities, $4.3 million, or 11% of the project \nfunds, will be administered by ADB as a regional CDC fund for regional cooperation, managed \nby the regional coordination unit (RCU). This fund will cover expenditures for the Project\u2019s \nregional steering committee (RSC), technical forums, international consulting services, regional \nstudies, cross-border activities, and the RCU itself. ADB\u2019s administration of the pooled regional \nfunds is considered necessary for the efficient release of funds. The reason is that financial \ntransfers for the regional activities between the ministries of finance is a complicated and time-\nconsuming process that could greatly delay the activities. The three governments agreed to this \narrangement according to the grant agreement. \n \n4.  The regional CDC fund will be financed from ADB\u2019s share of the grant on the basis of a \n30:20:50 ratio for Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), and Viet Nam, \nrespectively. The contribution to the RCU and regional activities will follow this same ratio, \nexcept for the financing of studies, which will be decided individually by the countries through \nthe RSC.       \n \n5.  Of this regional CDC fund, $1.6 million will be used to secure technical consulting \nservices through the World Health Organization (WHO). This represents $0.48 million of the \ngrant allocation from ADB for Cambodia, $0.32 million for the Lao PDR, and 0.80 million for \nViet Nam, as provided in the grant agreement with each recipient country, but it excludes \nWHO\u2019s $0.9 million contribution for experts. WHO and ADB will sign an agreement for this \npurpose. The agreement will specify (i) the type of experts to be provided by WHO, (ii) the \nmanner  in  which  these  experts  will  operate  in  close  coordination  with  MOH,  and  (iii)  the \nimplementation  arrangements  such  as  the  selection  of  experts,  reporting,  disbursement \narrangements, and performance review.  \n ", "  Appendix 5   47\nC.  Key Lessons Learned in Regional and Cross-Border Collaboration in Health \n6.  Regional and cross-border cooperation in health matters is not intended to replace \nnational disease control efforts and health services. Instead, it is meant to supplement or \nreinforce these national and local efforts by addressing common gaps or pockets of infection \nthat national and local programs and services have missed.1 Despite the many advantages of \nregional health cooperation, collaboration has been difficult to achieve even in North America. \nGlobalization has had minimal success in bringing together health professionals from both sides \nof a border, even along the US-Mexico border with its high level of interactions and shared \nculture. A pair of researchers has advanced a useful typology of the main barriers to cross-\nborder collaboration, and some of the potential barriers to cross-border health activities are \nsummarized in Table A5.1.2 A key lesson that can be derived from these barriers is that cross-\nborder collaboration in health must involve the central, state/provincial, and local levels, and \nboth public and private sectors. \n \nD.  Vision for Regional Cooperation in Health for the Greater Mekong Subregion  \n \n7.  Cooperation in the health sector among the CLV countries is still in a nascent stage of \ndevelopment. The memorandums of understanding for health sector cooperation are relatively \nrecent, and the agreed upon frameworks have in most instances not been followed up with \nsufficient action or implementation details.  \n \n8.  A critical success factor in effective cooperation arrangements is the prior existence of \ninformal networks across the participating countries. The absence of such networks typically \ncauses a lag between when the cooperative framework is established and when it is acted on \nand the benefits are manifested, because the necessary linkages across institutions need time \nto develop. This is clearly true of the health ministries, laboratories, and health institutes in the \nCLV countries. The networks are not in place because of limited opportunities for interfacing at \nthe technical level. \n \n9.  Achieving greater collaboration in health and other future health objectives will require a \nstrong foundation for regional cooperation that the CLV countries now lack. Component 3 will \ncontribute to developing a better, more sustainable foundation for regional cooperation in the \nhealth sector mainly through (i) specific technical forums that will bring together specialist health \nofficials  to  discuss  key  problems  and  issues,  exchange  knowledge,  and  promote  greater \nfamiliarity  and  understanding  about  one  another\u2019s  systems,  policies,  and  programs;  and \n(ii) cooperative institutional partnerships that will jointly investigate shared problems and identify \nappropriate  regional  solutions.  These  individual  and  institutional  networks  are  basic \nrequirements for regional cooperation and must already be in place for high-level cooperation \nagreements in the health sector to bear fruit. Once the trust and networks are established, then \nthe Greater Mekong Subregion countries can move on to more challenging regional health \ninitiatives such as sharing of data systems, standardization of health policies and regulatory \nframeworks, and coordination of responses to outbreaks of disease. \n \n                                                 \n1  Lemma Merid, 2003. \u201cA Regional Perspective Towards Managing HIV/AIDS in Northeast Africa,\u201d Journal of Health \nand Population in Developing Countries. \n2  The categories of barriers were defined in Homedes, Nuria and Antonio Ugalde. 2003. \u201cGlobalization and Health at \nthe US-Mexico Border,\u201d American Journal of Public Health, volume 93, 2016\u20132022.

Hence, the Project\u2019s short-term contribution to regional collaboration in health will be to \nlay the basic foundation for more advanced information exchange, joint initiatives, and policy or \nprogram harmonization. A medium-term vision for regional cooperation in health in the GMS \ncould  build  on  this  foundation  and  partly  revolve  around  the  revised  International  Health \nRegulations (IHR). The new IHR will provide member countries with a common reference point \nfor coordinating international responses to global health threats, but these responses are likely \nto occur in regional or subregional, as opposed to truly global, contexts. The GMS, perhaps \nthrough a more formal arrangement (but without a physical institution) such as a GMS Health \nCommission with ministers of health as members, could serve as a key building block for IHR. \nThe GMS Health Commission would provide leadership in the development of regional and ", "  Appendix 5   49\ncross-border health strategies for the GMS; coordinate the implementation of the revised IHR \nand their accompanying technical, policy, or legislative requirements among the six countries; \nand ensure high-level commitment and support for local cross-border health initiatives.  \n \nE.  Regional Coordination for Dialogue \n11.  ADB\u2019s Medium-Term Strategy asserts that ineffective institutions and policies are the \nbiggest constraints on growth and development in the medium term. It also states that the \nefficiency of investments depends largely on the quality of the policy and legal frameworks in a \ncountry. Regional policy dialogue has proven to be highly effective in allowing policy makers to \nreflect on critical policy matters, exchange views, and explore cooperative mechanisms.3 The \nrecent health threats from severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian flu have demonstrated \nthe importance of not only technical cooperation among countries but also policy cooperation. \nAn important part of strengthening national health systems and providing greater protection from \nthe spread of diseases is to enhance the legislative, regulatory, and policy frameworks of a \ncountry\u2019s health sector. \n \n12.  Additionally, the CLV countries face several common challenges in the health sector\u2014\namong others, how and where to obtain financing, how to deal with technical constraints in \nimplementing  health  interventions,  how  to  improve  access  to  health  services  for  ethnic \nminorities and the poor\u2014and have gained experience in what works well and what does not. \nWhat is lacking, however, are suitable opportunities to exchange knowledge and learn from one \nanother about particular technical and policy issues. The lessons learned often apply as well to \nother countries or localities, and could be used to develop the health systems in all three \ncountries.  \n \n13.  Thus, the technical forums noted in component 3, subcomponent 1, will feature policy \nand  technical  dialogue  in  a  peer  setting  among  the  CLV  countries  for  health  systems \ndevelopment.4 Health officials from the three countries can (i) exchange ideas and experiences \nin health policies, laws, and financing options; (ii) explore opportunities to coordinate and raise \npolicy and legal standards among the CLV countries; (iii) identify gaps in national policies that \nmake the entire region more vulnerable to communicable diseases, and determine how such \ngaps could be addressed; (iv) exchange lessons learned and \u201cgood practices\u201d related to specific \nhealth interventions, such as improving access to health services for ethnic minorities and \nwomen;5 and (v) coordinate the project activities for targeted diseases. The types of forums \nscheduled are in Table A5.2. \n \n14.  Most of these policy and technical dialogue sessions will be conducted in relatively small \ngroups of appropriate officials from the CLV countries to encourage more open and informal \nexchange.6 Where appropriate, the technical forums should involve other key stakeholders in \naddition to the MOHs. Officials in agriculture, education, water and sanitation, planning, and law \ncould also participate at times, along with ministries, departments, or associations for women. \n                                                 \n3  The effectiveness of the Inter-American Development Bank\u2019s \u201cRegional Policy Dialogue\u201d forum in dealing with a \nrange of policy issues has been acknowledged by the member countries. See Inter-American Development Bank. \n2003. Regional Integration: Strategy Document. Washington, DC.  \n4  These will be in addition to the meetings of the Regional Steering Committee. \n5  One important area to be considered is lessons learned about improving vaccination coverage for ethnic minorities. \nSome provinces and districts of the CLV countries have been much more successful than other areas in increasing \nvaccination coverage rates for similar ethnic minorities. This success has to do not only with having enough health \nworkers but also with communicating with and educating the ethnic minorities about vaccinations. \n6  The  Regional  Steering  Committee,  the  national  committees,  and  the  Executing  Agencies  will  identify  the \nappropriate participants in the dialogue sessions. ", "50   Appendix 5 \nThe countries could request external resource persons or experts to facilitate particular topics, \nbut the objective is for the officials to discuss the issues among themselves, exchange lessons \nlearned, and coordinate project activities. Also, the sessions will be hosted and co-organized by \nthe appropriate department or agency in the three countries on a rotating basis. The agenda for \neach dialogue session will be prepared jointly by the host ministry or department, the RCU, and \nthe project consultants (if any) who are involved in the related activities. The RSC may also \nspecify particular issues, particularly relating to project implementation, that the forums must \naddress. Additionally, the participation of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and Thailand in \nselected policy forums will be of great benefit in view of their experiences and the expected \nimprovement in mutual understanding and cooperation in CDC that would result from it.  \n \nTable A5.2: Proposed Regional Forums \n\u2022  Regional surveillance and response (with a focus on avian influenza) (3 forums) \n\u2022  Health regulations and standards (3 forums) \n\u2022  Disease-specific forums for targeted diseases under the Project7 \n                       \u2013 Regional control of dengue fever (3 forums) \n                       \u2013 HIV/AIDS8 and migrants (3 forums) \n                       \u2013 Eradication and control of parasitic infections: filariasis and schistosomiasis (2 forums) \n                       \u2013 Common childhood illnesses (e.g., acute respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases) \n(2 forums) \n\u2022  Financing and health systems development for communicable disease control (3 forums) \n\u2022  Targeting of vulnerable groups (3 forums) \nHIV/AIDS = human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \nSource:  ADB staff. \n \n15.  An important dimension of the policy and technical dialogue forums is the preparation \nand use of case studies. Case studies are an effective tool for presenting lessons learned and \nassessing the impact of interventions, policies, and financing options. Participating officials will \nbe encouraged to exchange and use case studies during the dialogue sessions. \n \nF.  Funding and Implementation of CLV Consortia Initiatives \n16.  The second subcomponent of component 3 is regional operations research and the \npromotion of institutional linkages. Funds will be set aside for regional operations research on \nHIV/AIDS. Most HIV/AIDS prevention and control is done at the national and community levels, \nbut particular cross-border HIV/AIDS issues and challenges are demonstrating the need for \nselected regional initiatives as well. A major concern is the increasing difficulty of preventing and \ncontrolling HIV/AIDS because of the inter-country mobility of people, facilitated by road and \nother infrastructure projects of international and regional development institutions. Commercial \nservice women, trafficked women, construction workers, truck drivers, and other mobile groups \nmoving across different parts of the GMS contribute greatly to the spread of the disease and \ntheir detection and treatment are often beyond the reach of health service providers.  \n \n17.  The Project will support a series of high-quality research studies on particular regional \naspects of the HIV/AIDS epidemiology in the three countries by building on the extensive \ndatabase (including baseline and final surveys, prevalence surveys, and records of input/output \ndata) generated by the \u201cCommunity Action for the Prevention of HIV/AIDS\u201d Project. Key topics \n                                                 \n7  The disease-specific forums will focus on technical issues related to these diseases, lessons learned, and the \ncoordination of the Project\u2019s activities in this regard.  \n8  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency virus. ", "  Appendix 5   51\nfor  research  include  emerging  women  trafficking  patterns  and  their  impact  on  HIV/AIDS; \nvulnerability and risk associated with transport corridors; road construction and other major \ninfrastructure development; and mobility of labor (formal and informal) within and between \ncountries.  \n \n18.  A specific research agenda will be developed and approved by the PPTA RSC before \nthe Project. Terms of reference for each identified research study will also be prepared in \nadvance. Research projects up to $100,000 will be commissioned through local competitive \nbidding or direct purchase, and only national institutes will be eligible. Research projects of \n$100,001 and up to $1 million will be tendered through international shopping. The research \nfunds will be held by ADB until ready for disbursement. Funds will then be channeled through an \nimprest  account  for  the  RCU  and  released  to  the  institutes  (up  to  $100,000  and  then \nreplenished if necessary). \n \n19.  The main objective of the institutional linkages activity is to establish (or strengthen) \nlinkages  among  health  institutions  in  conducting  joint  research  and  developing  successful \ninterventions based on geography (instead of formal international boundaries) at the local level \nor  pertinent  to  all  three  countries  at  the  national  level.  A  critical  success  factor  in  new \ncooperation arrangements is the prior existence of informal networks across the participating \ncountries. The absence of such networks typically causes a lag between when the cooperative \nframework is established and when it is acted on and the benefits are manifested, because the \nnecessary linkages across institutions take time to develop.  \n \n20.  This is clearly the case regarding health ministries, laboratories, and institutes in the \nCLV countries. The networks are not in place because of limited opportunities for interfacing at \nthe technical level. Therefore, high-level political agreements to cooperate in the health sector \nare unlikely to bear much fruit until networks and linkages develop among the technical health \nspecialists. \n \n21.  Research studies for institutional linkage building (i.e., non-HIV/AIDS research) will be \nselected  in  a  \u201ccompetitive\u201d  process,  with  consortia  of  CLV  institutions  preparing  their  bids \naccording  to  standard  ADB  procedures.  The  consortia  must  each  have  at  least  one \ninstitution/agency from each of the three countries, and can include both public and private \ninstitutions, as well as institutions or associations outside the standard health sector, such as \nwomen\u2019s unions or ministries of women\u2019s affairs (eligible private sector institutions must have a \ntrack record acceptable to the MOH). See Table A5.3 for the preliminary list of potential public \nsector  participating  institutions.  Research  study  designs  should  include  details  on  the \nprocurement of additional equipment necessary to conduct the research project. \n \n22.  Four categories of research topics have been identified as priority areas for institutional \ncooperation in health systems development and CDC among the CLV countries. These are \n(i) financing and health systems development, (ii) targeting of vulnerable groups, (iii) cross-\nborder health issues, and (iv) health regulations and standards. A specific research agenda in \neach of these priority areas will be developed and approved by the PPTA RSC before the \nProject. Terms of reference for each identified research study will also be prepared in advance. \nA Selection Committee composed of vice/deputy health ministers in the CLV countries and ADB \nwill review the applicants\u2019 bids and detailed proposals.9  \n \n                                                 \n9 The Selection Committee may simply be the Regional Steering Committee (RSC) itself or a separate committee \nappointed by the RSC. ", "52   Appendix 5 \n23.  To avoid spreading the funds too thinly across several small projects, no project should \nbe less than $50,000. A minimum threshold is set with a view to producing research results that \napply more widely  (i.e., a \u201cbigger picture\u201d) to the CLV countries rather than many small projects \nof limited use to the countries. Research projects up to $100,000 will be commissioned through \nlocal  competitive  bidding  or  direct  purchase,  and  only  national  institutes  will  be  eligible. \nResearch projects of $100,001 and up to $1 million will be tendered through international \nshopping. The research funds will be held by ADB until ready for disbursement. Funds will then \nbe channeled through an imprest account for the RCU and released to the institutes (up to \n$100,000 and then replenished if necessary). \n \nTable A5.3: Potential Participants from the Public Sector \n \nCambodia  Lao PDR  Viet Nam \nCommunicable Disease  Department of Hygiene and  Viet Nam Administration of \nControl Department  Prevention  Preventive Medicine \nDepartment of Planning and  Department of Planning and  Department of Planning and Finance \nHealth Information  Budgeting \nNational Center for  Center for HIV/AIDS and STI  Viet Nam Administration of \nHIV/AIDS, Dermatology, and  HIV/AIDS, Center for Social \nSTD Control   Diseases Control \nNational Institute of Public  National Center for Laboratory  National Institute of Hygiene and \nHealth   and Epidemiology  Epidemiology, Central Highlands \nInstitute of Hygiene and \nEpidemiology, Pasteur Institutes (Ho \nChi Minh City and Nha Trang) \nNational Center for  National Center of Malarialogy,  National Institute of Malariology, \nParasitology, Entomology,  Parasitology and Entomology  Parasitology, and Entomology \nand Malaria Control \nDepartment of Drug, Food,  Department of Food and Drugs  Department of Food Safety and \nand Cosmetics  Hygiene \nMinistry of Women\u2019s Affairs  Women\u2019s Union, Youth Union  Women\u2019s Union, Youth Union  \nHIV/AIDS = human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, Lao PDR = the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, STD = sexually transmitted disease, STI = sexually transmitted infections. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n24.  For the implementation of research studies, each consortium will be responsible for \nmanaging  the  project  budget  within  the  total  approved  amount,  following  ADB  regulations \nregarding procurement and procedures. The implementation of the project should follow the \nterms of reference approved by the Selection Committee, but amendments can be made with \nwritten approval from the committee. Reporting requirements will be specified in the terms of \nreference. To overcome the initial dearth of contacts, a workshop will be held for prospective \ninstitutions, departments, and others to allow them to learn about the project requirements and \ncriteria and facilitate initial contact among prospective partners.  \n \nG.  Cross-Border Health Activities \n \n25.  The Project will also fund cross-border health activities in which border provinces and \ntheir local communities can formally interact, identify common health needs and solutions, and \ninitiate pilot cross-border projects. Provincial, district, and village health officials will participate \nalong with health nongovernment organizations and community leaders. An initial pilot border \nmeeting will be arranged by Cambodia\u2019s National Committee on Border Health Cooperation. \nCross-border activities that are proposed under the Project are listed in Table A5.4. \n ", "  Appendix 5   53\nTable A5.4: Indicative List of Cross-Border Activities \n \nProposed Activities  Comments \nJoint training of  Quarantine staff and other border health officials will be trained in early \nquarantine staff  diagnosis and rapid testing of malaria and TB among migrants. \n \nPromotion and monitoring  Diarrheal diseases from unsafe food are a major cause of morbidity in \nof food safety and  border areas, where sanitation is generally poor and the people have less \nhygiene   knowledge about how to handle food properly.

The local project \nperformance monitoring system will indicate specific quantitative targets and add indicators \nrelated to local health needs. Health status and health service coverage are linked to the \nMillennium Development Goals and will be measured through national surveys that are already \nplanned. Local surveys (i.e., at district level), will measure the prevalence of specific diseases \nand coverage before and after the Project in targeted areas and among targeted populations, \nand behavioral change among target groups.

The economic analysis of projects helps in identifying and selecting public investments \nthat  will  improve  the  welfare  of  beneficiaries  and  the  country  as  a  whole.  This  appendix \nanalyzes  the  economic  justification  for  the  proposed  investment  in  regional  communicable \ndiseases control (CDC).  \n \nA.  Project Objectives \n \n2.  The overall anticipated impact of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Regional CDC \nProject is containment of the spread of epidemic diseases at the local level and reduction of the \nburden of common endemic diseases in Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao \nPDR), and Viet Nam by about 15% overall, and more for certain specific infections.1 This will \nhelp the CLV countries progress toward their health-related Millennium Development Goals for \n2015. The expected project outcomes are (i) timely and adequate control of epidemics that are \nlikely to have a major impact on the region\u2019s public health and economy; (ii) improved coverage \nof prevention and care of communicable diseases in vulnerable populations, in particular poor \nwomen and children living in border areas; (iii) improved know-how, policies, standards, and \ncoordination of countries to improve CDC, including HIV/AIDS2 control; and (iv) efficient project \nmanagement.  \n \nB.  Project Beneficiaries \n \n3.  The Project has national benefits\u2014resulting from a reduction in the macroeconomic \nimpact of emerging diseases like avian influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), \nand dengue fever, and in the incidence of diseases such as helminthiasis, digestive diseases, \nHIV/AIDS, measles, and other diseases in selected vulnerable populations. The CLV countries \nhave nearly 100 million people, about 17 million of whom live below the international poverty \nline of $1 per day (purchasing power parity). Many of these people are ethnic minorities and \nwomen and children living in remote border areas, where the prevalence of communicable \ndisease is disproportionately high. The proposed project interventions have been designed to \nspecifically address these groups by developing capacity, improving access to health facilities, \nand providing equipment and drugs in priority areas of need. \n \nC.  Rationale for Investment \n \n4.  The economic and equity-based rationales for investing in CDC are extremely high. \nThere are strong linkages between health and the burden of infectious diseases and labor \nproductivity. A range of macroeconomic studies suggest that improved health is empirically \nrelated to economic growth3 (see review in Macroeconomics and Health: Investing in Health for \nEconomic Development, J. Sachs and others), and specifically in relation to CDC, research \nindicates that high prevalence of diseases such as malaria or HIV/AIDS is associated with \nsignificantly lower rates of economic growth. For example, the impact of HIV/AIDS on the \nannual rate of economic growth ranges from 0% to 2% (Bloom and Mahal 1997, Bonnel 2000).4 \n \n                                                 \n1  The Project covers Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam. Other GMS countries (People\u2019s Republic of China, \nMyanmar, and Thailand) will take part in regional dialogue. \n2  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n3  Sachs, J. and others. 2001.

Health Nutrition and Infectious Disease and Economic Growth in Cambodia. Bangkok. ", "  Appendix 13  69\n5.  Despite the high economic rates of return estimated for investments in the health sector, \nprivate participation is suboptimal. This under-investment is due to the market failures that \ncharacterize health investment and the need to promote regional public goods. Market failures \ninclude incomplete information about the benefits of investments in health and nutrition and the \nway  in  which  such  investments  can  be  made  cost-effective;  economies  of  information; \nexternalities in some markets, for example, in markets for investments to prevent and treat \ninfectious diseases; differences between private and social discount rates, leading to private \ndecisions that do not adequately reflect long-term benefits; and intra-household decision making \nthat favors adults (and especially male adults) over children (and especially over girls), leading \nto under-investment in children\u2019s human capital, and especially in girls\u2019 human capital, relative \nto socially desired levels.5 \n \n6.  The total Asian Development Bank (ADB) investment of $30 million for the Project will \nfocus  on  infectious  diseases  with  market  failure  characteristics\u2014such  as  communicable \ndiseases that spread across borders. Economic development and greater connectivity bring a \nwide range of benefits for the countries in the region, but they also facilitate more rapid spread \nof diseases across borders. The SARS outbreak in 2003 and the avian influenza epidemics in \n2004 and 2005 highlighted the vulnerability of the local economy to even relatively minor (in \nterms of number of people dying) disease outbreaks. Although SARS did not have much direct \nimpact on the CLV countries in terms of infected people and fatalities, the disease had profound \neconomic impact and slowed economic growth temporarily. Avian influenza is having a limited \nmacroeconomic impact, mainly through export restrictions, but at a micro level it has a major \nimpact on poor farmers. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is likely to be \na human influenza pandemic with major human and economic costs. Therefore, it is vital to \ndevelop capacity to slow down and contain new outbreaks. \n \nD.  Cost-Benefit Analysis \n \n7.  The quantitative cost-benefit analysis for the Project follows the methods outlined in \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.6 The analysis covers 25 years and is in \nconstant 2005 dollar prices. Key assumptions are as follows: \n \n(i)  Discount rate. The economic opportunity cost of capital was assumed to be \n12%. Most health project analyses tend to use 3% as a discount factor; therefore, \nfuture benefits are likely to be given greater value. To harmonize this analysis \nwith the appraisal of other projects in non-health sectors, a higher discount rate is \nused.  \n \n(ii)  Economic cost of labor. The opportunity cost of labor or the shadow wage rate \nfor both urban and rural adults was calculated at $200 per year.  \n \nE.  Economic Costs \n \n8.  Base investment costs are in constant 2005 dollar prices. Taxes and duties account for a \nsmall proportion of the project costs. Incremental recurrent costs are calculated for the 25 years \nafter the 5-year project implementation period. These costs are initially high relative to the \nproportion of overall costs because the investment will cover the procurement of drugs and \n                                                 \n5   Knowles, J. 2003.

Economic Benefits \n \n9.  The Project will improve the socioeconomic condition of the target beneficiaries. Key \nproject benefits are to be estimated in the following ways: (i) cost savings due to increased \nhealth awareness and reduced disease prevalence, (ii) enhanced income of both rural and \nurban income earners who care for the sick, and (iii) decreased costs associated with the \noutbreak of emerging diseases such as SARS or avian influenza. These benefits are calculated \nfor  surveillance  and  response  and  the  control  of  communicable  diseases  in  vulnerable \npopulations, as well as sexually transmitted infection/HIV in migrant populations in the region. \nThe analysis is based on the cost of investments and recurrent expenditure over a 25-year \nperiod (table available on request). \n \n10.  Component 1 is designed to strengthen the surveillance and response system as a \nwhole.  A  better-functioning  system,  which  includes  disease  reporting,  diagnosis,  and \nresponsiveness, will increase capacity to identify and curtail the spread of infectious disease. \nPreventing and quickly responding to outbreaks of endemic diseases such as measles, cholera, \ntyphoid, and a range of other notifiable diseases including SARS and avian influenza will reduce \nthe number of cases and, hence, the burden of disease in the CLV countries.7 However, the \nincidence of emerging diseases is difficult to estimate, given the limited history of SARS and \navian influenza. \n \n11.  Targeted surveillance and response, along with targeted control of endemic diseases, \nwill  reduce  the  burden  of  these  diseases  and  generate  economic  benefits  largely  through \nreduced out-of-pocket expenditures. A number of surveys have been undertaken across the \nCLV countries examining the economic costs that outbreaks of dengue and HIV/AIDS inflict on \nhousehold incomes, savings, and expenditure. In summary, the findings show that  \n \n(i)  increased health awareness and improved communicable disease control \nleads  to  cost  savings.  Resource  or  out-of-pocket  savings  may  flow  from  a \nreduction in (a) transport costs, as a result of better access to health services, and \n(b) the cost of treatment, as a result of more efficient and rational diagnosis and \ntreatment.8  Better  health  resulting  from  health  awareness  activities  means \nsignificantly less out-of-pocket health expenditures. In the case of Cambodia, \nsavings  of  $4\u2013$6  per  person  were  assumed  for  public  health  project \nimplementation. \n \n(ii)  the income of rural and urban adults increases. Adults often have to care for \nsick children or may contract infectious disease themselves and suffer reduced \nwork productivity. The nature of these productivity losses has received limited \nattention in the literature, although demographic and household surveys indicate \nthat considerable time is lost in transporting family members to health facilities \n(see footnote 6).  \n \n                                                 \n7  For baseline assumptions, see the report on the project preparatory technical assistance. \n8  ADB. 2002.

The \navian  influenza  outbreak  since  late  2003  is  estimated  to  have  cost  Mekong \ncountries $563 million. The largest component of economic impact relates to \nmarket  restrictions  and  their  impact  on  integrated  commercial  producers  and \npoultry  input  suppliers  in  Thailand.  USDA  (2005)  estimated  $137  million  in \nintegrated producer costs and $186 million in supplier costs in 2004. At this stage, \nthe economic impact on the health sector and people is relatively small, largely \nbecause only 64 human cases have been identified so far. ADB (2004) noted that \n\u201cIf the epidemic remains confined to animals, as has been the case up to now, it is \nlikely that the aggregate impact on the economies of the region will be relatively \nlimited and hardly perceptible given the underlying strong growth trends projected \nfor the Asian and Pacific region in 2004.\u201d Among the countries affected, Thailand \nwill feel the strongest impact because of the importance of the industry in its \nexport sector. ADB estimated that the SARS epidemic, which lasted one quarter, \nled to business losses of $59 billion (measured as total final expenditures) and \nreduced gross domestic product by about $18 billion (0.8%). The CLV countries \nwere not subject to the major economic impact of these losses.    \n \nG.  Economic Internal Rate of Return \n \n12.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated to be 34%, and the economic \nnet present value is $29 million. This EIRR probably underestimates the total economic benefits \nfrom the Project. Other factors must be considered; these include improvements in health and \neducation systems efficiency; in decentralization and local capacity; in women\u2019s knowledge, \nskills, employment opportunities, and access to services (gender benefits); and in cognitive \ndevelopment and school performance. \n \nH.  Financial Sustainability Analysis \n \n13.  The  Project\u2019s  recurrent  costs  include  the  staff  costs  of  integrated  service  delivery, \nprocurement of medical supplies, and ongoing institutional strengthening costs, which together \naccount for about $1.7 million in 2009, the final year of project implementation, but are expected \nto  decline  to  $1.1  million  by  2012.  These  costs  represent  only  a  minor  percentage  of \ngovernment health expenditure in Cambodia and Viet Nam, and a modest sum in Lao PDR, for \nwhich provisions have been made in future health budgets. It is envisaged that recurrent costs \nwould be scaled back as households purchase items such as worm tablets.  \n \nI.  Conclusions \n \n14.  The economic and social benefits of undertaking the CDC Project are substantial, given \nthe recent trends in poverty, health, and education services in the CLV countries. The analysis \nabove demonstrates a high expected EIRR of 34%. However, because a number of economic \nbenefits of CDC are hard to quantify, certain benefits are likely to have been underestimated. \n \n ", "72   Appendix 14 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n  \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nIs the sector identified as a national \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes   Yes \npriority in country poverty partnership \npriority in country poverty analysis?        No    No \nagreement?   \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam: \nProgress  toward  poverty  reduction  has  occurred  in  provinces  along  and  adjoining  the  East\u2013West  (Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic [Lao PDR] and Viet Nam) and Phnom Penh\u2013Ho Chi Minh City (Cambodia and Viet Nam) corridors, \nand along the Mekong River connecting northern Cambodia with southern Lao PDR. The health status of populations in \nthe border areas of these provinces has lagged behind the status achieved in urban areas. Many people still have limited \naccess to health care, belong to vulnerable ethnic minorities, and cannot afford basic health services. While these \ncorridors help increase connectivity and economic growth through trade and tourism, transport corridors also facilitate the \nspread of communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS and avian influenza in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS).  \n \nThe Project will help contain the spread of emerging and epidemic diseases and reduce the burden of common endemic \ndiseases  in  Cambodia,  Lao  PDR,  and  Viet  Nam  by  15%  of  the  current  disability-adjusted  life  year  (DALY)  by \n(i) strengthening national surveillance and response systems, (ii) improving communicable disease control (CDC) for \nvulnerable groups, and (iii) strengthening regional cooperation. The Project will help minimize the social and economic \nimpact of communicable diseases, and help the countries progress toward their health-related Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) for 2015 of reducing under-5 mortality rates and containing, as far as possible, the spread of HIV/AIDS. \nThe Project will also focus its investment in border areas and along economic corridors where communities have little or \nno access to health care. \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention \nCambodia. In 1993\u20131999, Cambodia experienced a reduction in poverty from 39% to 36%. Estimates show that about \n15\u201320% of the population lives in extreme poverty. Poverty in Cambodia is concentrated in rural and remote areas. The \npoverty rate in urban areas is estimated at 29.7% compared with 40.1% in rural areas. Poverty is due to a number of \nfactors, including the limited sources of economic growth, exclusion of the poor from the mainstream economy, limited \naccess to and poor quality of social services, unavailability of credit, and lack of productive assets and resources (e.g., \nland, forestry, and fisheries). A number of indigenous hill tribe groups, primarily located in Ratanakiri and Mondulkiri \nprovinces, are among the poorest and most vulnerable segments of Cambodia\u2019s population. \n \nLao PDR. Poverty incidence fell from 45% in 1992\u20131993 to 30% by 2002\u20132003. The sharp reduction in poverty incidence \nwas associated with consecutive years of strong economic growth, achievement of rice self-sufficiency, and increased \ncross-border trade. However, poverty levels differ between urban and rural areas, and regionally across the country. For \ninstance, the northern part of the Lao PDR has a poverty incidence of about 52%. By focusing primarily on the poor \nnorthern provinces and the GMS East\u2013West Economic Corridor, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) emphasizes \ndevelopment opportunities from cross-border trade and movement and the importance of the private sector along border \nareas and key economic corridors. \n \nViet Nam. Data from the 2002 Multipurpose Household Survey confirmed a continuing decline in the incidence of poverty, \nfrom 58% in 1993 to 29% in 2002. The decline in the last 5 years was not uniform across the country: poverty dropped \nmost sharply in the Mekong Delta area (from 37% in 1998 to 23%) but remained highest in the Central Highlands (about \n52%). The underdeveloped state of infrastructure in poor regions causes the gap between them and other regions in the \ncountry to widen. High and stable economic growth in the past several years has been a major contributor to poverty \nreduction, but the benefits from economic growth have not been evenly distributed. \n \nThe Project will focus on surveillance and response and control of selected diseases, which will mainly benefit the poor \nand other vulnerable groups. These groups suffer from a higher burden of disease, particularly communicable diseases, \nand have limited access to both public and private health services. At least 47% of the project benefits will accrue to the \npopulation living below the poverty line. Ethnic minorities in the three countries will benefit from the Project's focus on \nremote areas and its commitment to train local health workers and community volunteers. Targeted surveillance and \nresponse, along with targeted control of endemic diseases, will reduce the burden of communicable diseases and \ngenerate economic benefits as follows: (i) increased health awareness will lead to improvements in health, which in turn \nwill significantly decrease out-of-pocket health expenditures; (ii) improved health services for infants and children will \nreduce the number of sick children, thereby improving school attendance and overall physical and cognitive development; \nand (iii) strengthened disease surveillance and response systems will help avoid costs associated with outbreaks (e.g., \nthe avian influenza outbreak is estimated to have cost the Mekong countries about $563 million since 2003).  \n \n ", "  Appendix 14  73\nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nA stakeholder analysis helped to identify key project stakeholders, their Project-related interests, and the ways in which \nthey affect project feasibility and success. This was especially important in identifying potential activities (e.g., technical \nforums) aimed at strengthening regional cooperation in CDC among the GMS countries. Primary institutional stakeholders \nare the ministries of health (MOHs), line ministries, development partners, and mass organizations. Local communities, \nespecially village health volunteers,  will be highly involved through training, reporting, and the implementation of \ninformation, education, and communication activities. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nA participation strategy is integrated into the overall project design. During project design, MOHs carried out initial \nconsultations with different stakeholders and held three regional workshops. The involvement of stakeholders will \ncontinue during project implementation. Collaboration with other departments within MOH and line ministries will be \nimportant in coordinating efforts and avoiding duplication of information, education, and communication materials for \ncommunicable diseases. Local health workers and community volunteers will be trained to implement project activities, \nand their involvement will complement CDC efforts at the community level.  \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nWomen in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam, especially ethnic minority women, remain particularly vulnerable to \npoverty. Cambodia has among the lowest levels of gender equity in Asia as measured by the gender-related development \nindex (0.557) and the gender empowerment index (0.364). Rural and ethnic minority women in these countries carry out \nmore than half of total agricultural production, as well as the additional workload around the home. Women workers earn \nconsiderably less than male workers, and women consistently consume fewer calories than males, as indicated by the \nhigher malnutrition, mortality, and morbidity rates for girls and women than for males.  \n \nMaternal and child mortality in the region is high, but most of the primary causes are preventable. Acute respiratory \ninfections, infectious diarrhea, and parasitic diseases are significant causes of morbidity and mortality among women and \nchildren. A lack of awareness of CDC and low-quality health services disproportionately affect the poor and vulnerable \ngroups, including ethnic minorities. Poor women are particularly vulnerable to sexual exploitation.  \n \nA gender analysis was conducted during project preparation to ensure that gender concerns in CDC were identified and \naddressed in the overall project design. A gender action plan (GAP) with monitoring indicators has been developed to \nensure that gender-related health issues were integrated into the implementation of the regional project. Country-specific \nGAPs based on the project GAP will be prepared during implementation with monitoring indicators refined for each \ncountry. National social development specialists will be recruited to assist the project management unit in each country in \npreparing, implementing, and monitoring specific GAPs. The GAP is found in Appendix 15. \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes     No \nE.

The objective of the ethnic minority development plan (EMDP) is to ensure that ethnic \nminorities included in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Regional Communicable Diseases \nControl Project (the Project) in Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), and \nViet Nam will benefit fully from the proposed communicable disease control (CDC) activities. \nThe specific needs and views of ethnic minorities were considered in the design of the Project. \nThe Project will have no adverse effects on the ethnic minority population. The EMDP ensures \ncompliance with the Policy on Indigenous Peoples of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and \ncurrent government regulations in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam.  \n \nA.  Ethnic Groups \n \n2.  In  Cambodia,  about  10%  of  the  population  can  be  classified  as  ethnic  minorities. \nIndigenous groups (or hill tribe groups) are concentrated in the four northeastern provinces of \nRattanakiri (66% of the population in these provinces, Mondolkiri (71%), Stung Treng (7%), and \nKratie  (8%).  These  populations  are  among  the  poorest  and  most  vulnerable  groups  in \nCambodia and live in physical and cultural isolation. In the Lao PDR, there are officially 46 \nethnic groups that live mainly in the northern region of the country near borders. Ethnic minority \ngroups compose about 32% of the Lao PDR population. Larger ethnic groups include the \nHmong,  Khmu,  Phutai,  Kor,  and  Katu.  In  Viet  Nam,  there  are  officially  54  ethnic  groups \nbelonging to different family and language groups composing 14% of the total population. They \nare spread out over 45 provinces and live mainly in mountainous areas. About 31 ethnic \nminority groups live mainly in the Northern Uplands and about 19 ethnic minority groups live \nmainly in the Central Highlands.  \n \nB.  Health Challenges of Ethnic Groups \n \n3.  In the three countries, the infant and child mortality rates and maternal mortality ratios \nare generally higher in the provinces with a high proportion of ethnic minorities. Ethnic minorities \nin all three countries suffer more often from common infectious diseases than the majority ethnic \ngroups. These diseases include diarrheal diseases, acute respiratory infections, tuberculosis, \nmalaria,  measles,  and  other  infections  often  associated  with  poor  living  conditions  and \nmalnutrition.  Minority  peoples  are  also  at  special  risk  of  infection  with  the  human \nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV) because of lack of access to education, poverty, lack of culturally \nappropriate information in their own languages, cultural and social breakdown within some \ncommunities, nontraditional drug use, and a relatively high involvement in the sex trade and \nother forms of exploited labor. However, they are at less risk of dengue and other emerging \ndiseases, which are more common in the lowlands (Appendix 3). \n \n4.  Cambodia\u2019s northeastern provinces have a higher incidence of infectious diseases than \nother provinces. In Lao PDR, where more than 90% of births occur at home in the presence of a \nrelative or a traditional birth attendant, about 60% of all maternal deaths occur during childbirth. \nIn Viet Nam, the infant mortality rate has dropped, from 90 per 1,000 live births in 1980 to 36 per \n1,000 live births in 1996 (Appendix 3). But the rate is higher in the Northern Uplands (52 per \n1,000 live births in 1996) and Central Highlands (55 per 1,000 live births in 1996). Poverty and \nimbalanced economic growth contribute to poor nutrition and high child mortality and morbidity \nrates. Similarly, maternal mortality has been reported at almost 160 per 100,000 live births in \nrural areas and nearly four times higher in remote mountainous areas. Common causes of \nmaternal death are hemorrhage, pre-eclampsia, malaria, sepsis resulting from abortion, and \nobstructed labor causing the uterus to rupture.  ", "  Appendix 16  79\nC.  Access to Health Care \n \n5.  Hygienic living conditions and basic preventive and curative care can address most \ninfections,  malnutrition,  and  maternal  complications.  However,  ethnic  minorities  have  less \nphysical, social, and financial access to health care because of their isolation. Prenatal care and \nservices to handle complicated births are often not available in remote rural settings. Rural and \nethnic minority women rarely have any form of antenatal care, in part because of cultural \ninhibitions and language barriers. Ethnic minority women often do not use health services \nbecause of their (perceived) high cost. Many are very poor and lack cash.  \n \nD.  Legal Frameworks and Principles \n \n6.  Each Government has a clear legal framework and set of principles in support of ethnic \nminorities.  Cambodia\u2019s  Rectangular  Strategy  (2004\u20132008),  Second  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment  Plan  (2001\u20132005),  and  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  (2003\u20132005) \nemphasize equity and social justice for everyone, including ethnic minorities. In the Lao PDR, \nrecent laws and decisions reflect ethnic concerns in the development process in all sectors. The \nNational Socio-Economic Development Plan (2001\u20132005) has adopted as its objective the \nalleviation of poverty for ethnic groups in remote areas. The Constitution highlights the right of \nethnic groups to protect, preserve, and promote their customs, and prohibits acts of division and \ndiscrimination (Article 8). Viet Nam\u2019s Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy \n(2001\u20132010)  deals  directly  with  issues  of  gender  and  ethnic  minorities.  The  Government \nrecognizes ethnic minorities as poor and underprivileged groups. Current government policies \nand programs aim to enhance the health status of ethnic minorities. The Central Party Executive \nCommittee  Directive  N06-CT/TW  (2002)  provides  guidelines  for  the  Ministry  of  Health  to \nformulate polices with priority given to people in remote and mountainous areas, especially \nethnic minorities.  \n \nE.  The Project \n \n7.  The Project has three components: (i) strengthening national surveillance and response \nsystems;  (ii)  improving  provincial  CDC  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable,  in  particular  women, \nchildren, and ethnic minorities; and (iii) strengthening regional cooperation in CDC.  \n \n8.  Three  subcomponents  of  the  Project  provide  special  focus  on  vulnerable  groups \nincluding ethnic minorities: (i) a community-based surveillance and response system that will \naim to reach remote living populations, to achieve timely control of epidemics like malaria and \nmeasles, but also avian influenza, encephalitis, and other epidemics; (ii) improved CDC in these \npopulations  as  a  result  of  better  access  to  promotive,  preventive,  and  basic  curative \ninterventions  through  village  health  workers;  and  (iii)  HIV/AIDS  control  through  behavioral \nchange and communication among high-risk groups, including ethnic minorities, in \u201chot spots.\u201d   \n \nF.  Ethnic Minority Development Plan \n \n9.  ADB policy aims to protect ethnic minorities from the adverse effects of development \nand to ensure that ethnic minorities benefit from development projects and programs. The \nProject will create favorable conditions for better surveillance and response, improved access to \ncommunicable  disease  services,  and  more  effective  subregional  collaboration  for  better \nresponse to and preparedness for pandemic outbreaks. The EMDP for the Project is based on \ngovernment guidelines in the countries and ADB policy on indigenous peoples. It proposes two ", "80   Appendix 16 \navenues  for  improving  CDC  for  vulnerable  populations:  village-based  health  care  and \ncommunity-based action for CDC.  \n \n10.  Village-Based Health Care. To give remote communities better access to health care, \nthe  Project  will  improve  village-based  health  care  by  training  village  workers  from  ethnic \nminorities. These workers will carry out health promotion and prevention campaigns including \nthose for avian influenza and HIV/AIDS, provide basic treatment, and improve preparedness for \ncommon emergencies. For each ethnic group, specific cultural issues will be identified at the \nlocal level and incorporated in the local design to make services more acceptable. Materials and \ntraining programs will be designed to take into account the level of education and language of \nthe target groups. Revolving funds for drugs will be set up at the village level, where this is \nfeasible. These funds could also be used to improve water and sanitation coverage and other \nlocally identified activities for disease prevention and control.  \n \n11.  Community-Based  Action  for  CDC.  The  Project  will  also  explore  community-\nmobilization for CDC. It will develop a participation strategy appropriate for ethnic minorities to \nimprove surveillance and response at the community level, and to improve control of endemic \ndiseases, by mobilizing leadership and mass organization, and providing demonstration models.  \n \nG.  Project Benefits  \n \n12.  The Project will help improve the health of the population in the targeted provinces, \npromote  progress  toward  the  health-related  Millennium  Development  Goals,  and  intensify \nintergovernmental cooperation to contain diseases and strengthen national health systems. The \nProject design fully integrates the health needs of vulnerable groups, including ethnic minorities \nat the community level. Specific activities focus on primary health care in remote areas, and \nthese consist of community-based interventions.  \n \n13.  The following specific measures will be adopted in country-specific plans to integrate \nethnic minority issues in regional, national, and local CDC interventions. Monitoring indicators \nspecific to each country will be developed during implementation.  \n \n(i)  Data on the incidence of diseases, by gender and by ethnicity, will be collected to \nstrengthen surveillance systems. \n(ii)  Surveys  conducted  will  include  culturally  appropriate  questions,  and  specific \nquestions pertaining to CDC health needs and ethnic minorities.  \n(iii)  Provincial preventive health plans will include specific actions for addressing the \npreventive  health  needs  of  ethnic  minority  groups.  Provinces  with  a  high \npopulation of ethnic minorities will be given at least an equal share in provincial \nfunds. \n(iv)  Information,  education,  and  communication  materials  and  behavioral  change \ncommunication activities will be developed for vulnerable groups, including ethnic \nminorities.  Guidelines  and  training  materials  will  consider  traditional  health \npractices, and the cultural, educational, and linguistic needs of ethnic minorities \nin the targeted provinces. \n(v)  Specific activities  in  \u201chot  spots\u201d  will  be  culturally  appropriate  to cross-border \npopulations, will capture the health-seeking behaviors and attitudes of ethnic \ngroups,  and  will  train  and  employ  health  workers  from  similar  ethnic \nbackgrounds. \n(vi)  Policies and practices related to border quarantine will consider the needs of \ncross-border populations (e.g., ethnic minority groups and migrants).  ", "  Appendix 16  81\n(vii)  To share information with GMS countries that are not included in the Project, \neach regional technical forum will include discussions about issues pertaining to \nCDC among ethnic minority and vulnerable groups, including updates on any \nassociated activities. \n(viii)   Proposals  submitted  for  regional  operations  research  for  HIV/AIDS  and \ninstitutional linkages should clearly illustrate the impact of the proposed research \non the health needs of ethnic groups, classified by gender where appropriate.   \n \nH.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  The  implementation  arrangements  and  estimated  costs  of  the  EMDP  have  been \nintegrated  into  the  overall  arrangements  and  total  budget  of  the  Project.  The  project \nmanagement unit in each country will supervise the implementation of the EMDP, and national \ninstitutes and provincial preventive health offices involved in the Project will implement the plan. \nThree national social development specialists, one for each country, will be hired for 18 person-\nmonths each during the Project. Each social development specialist will help develop country-\nspecific implementation guidelines to integrate the specific measures set out in the EMDP. The \nspecialist will work with the regional international technical experts to adapt and integrate the \nEMDP into project activities for each country. Measures and targets will be integrated into the \nassessment of preventive health needs, the preparation of provincial health plans, and training \nactivities (including the training of trainers) in each province.  \n \n15.  The monitoring of the EMDP is part of the overall project performance monitoring and \nevaluation  system.  The  three  national  social  development  specialists  will  help  the  project \nmanagement unit establish project indicators for the effective monitoring and evaluation of \nproject  activities  in  each  country.  Ethnic  minorities  will  be  consulted  during  project \nimplementation to ensure that the project interventions consider adequately the needs of ethnic \nminority groups and that these groups share proportionately in project benefits. Each project \nmanagement unit will consolidate quarterly updates from provinces on the progress of the \nEMDP implementation. Progress reports will include updates on ethnic minorities, and the \nmidterm review will pay special attention to the effects of the Project on ethnic minority and \nother vulnerable groups. Adjustments will be made, if necessary, during the Project to better \nmeet the health needs of ethnic minorities in communicable disease control.
