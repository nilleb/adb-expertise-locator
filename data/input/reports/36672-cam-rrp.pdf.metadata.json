It  will  finance  basic  health  services,  which  leave  limited \nby-products, and will help safeguard the environment by putting in \nplace  an  early  warning  and  response  system,  which  will  reduce \nthe environmental costs of disease control, in particular insecticide \nspraying. Medical wastes will be closely monitored.  \n \nThe  Governments  of  Cambodia,  Lao  PDR,  and  Viet  Nam  (the \nCLV  countries)  propose  a  4-year  regional  project  to  improve \ncommunicable  disease  control  (CDC)  at  regional,  national,  and \nprovincial levels in partnership with the Western Pacific Regional \nOffice  (WPRO)  of  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO).  The \nDesign and Monitoring Framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nThe  Project  will  strengthen  the  regional  capacity  to  contain  the \nspread  of  emerging  diseases  and  reduce  the  burden  of  common \nendemic  communicable  diseases  within \nfor \nregional collaboration of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). It \nwill (i) strengthen national surveillance and response systems, (ii) \nimprove  CDC  for  vulnerable  groups,  and  (iii)  strengthen  regional \ncollaboration  in  CDC.  The  targeted  provinces  are  important  for \nCDC  because  of  regional  connectivity,  their  high  burden  of \ninfectious  diseases,  and  the  high  degree  of  vulnerability  of  their \npopulations.   \n \nThe \nthe  Project  will  help  develop \ncomprehensive national surveillance and response systems in the \nthree  countries  and  develop  community-based  models \nfor \ncontrolling outbreaks of diseases, including avian influenza, in 26 \nprovinces  (5  in  Cambodia,  6  in  Lao  PDR,  and  15  in  Viet  Nam). \nInstitutional  structures  based  on  the  new  international  health \nregulations  (IHR)  will  be  developed;  preparedness,  surveillance, \nand response will be improved; district laboratory services will be \nimproved; and human resources will be developed. \n \n\nfirst  component  of \n\nframework \n\nthe \n\n \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nProject Description \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nRationale \n\n \n\niii\n\nvulnerable  groups, \n\nThe  second  component  will  expand  and  integrate  CDC  for \nvulnerable  groups  in  26  priority  provinces  by  (i)  strengthening \nprovincial  capacity  for  CDC;  (ii)  supporting  comprehensive  CDC \nfor \ncontrol  of  neglected \nincluding \ncommunicable diseases like dengue and parasitic infections; and \n(iii)  improving  the  continuum  of  care  for  the  control  of  human \nimmunodeficiency  virus/acquired \nimmunodeficiency  syndrome \n(HIV/AIDS) in high-risk populations. \n  \nThe third component will develop productive regional coordination \nfor CDC through regional policy dialogue, operations research for \nHIV/AIDS  control  and  other  fields  through  regional  institutions, \nand project management. The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), \nMyanmar,  and  Thailand  will  be  invited  to  participate  in  regional \nworkshops. \n \nThe CLV countries have made remarkable progress in improving \nthe  health  of  their  populations  over  the  past  decades,  and  are \nmaking major efforts to putting in place strong policy frameworks \nand  primary  health  care  (PHC)  systems.  However,  as  discussed \nat  the  Fifth  Meeting  of  the  GMS  Working  Group  on  Human \nResource  Development  in  Yangon  in  June  2004,  the  CLV \ncountries  may  not  achieve  their  health-related  MDGs  based  on \ncurrent challenges and efforts.   \n \nTo  achieve  health-related  MDGs  requires  providing  PHC  to \nremote populations suffering from a high burden of infectious and \nreproductive diseases, and improving the affordability and quality \nof  health  care.  This  is  further  complicated  by  the  need  for \ncommunity  action  to  contain  emerging  diseases  like  avian \ninfluenza  and  severe  acute  respiratory  syndrome  (SARS), \ndengue, and HIV/AIDS, which are facilitated by increased market \nintegration, connectivity, and movements of people and goods.  \n \nAt the GMS summit meeting in 2005, the six heads of government \nreaffirmed their vision of a subregion free from poverty and able to \ntheir \nsustainable  development  opportunities \nprovide \nintegration, \npopulations.  Besides  economic  cooperation  and \nhuman  development  was  appreciated  as \nthe \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) for reducing poverty. The \nleaders  proposed  stronger  regional  collaboration  in  CDC  in  view \nof  HIV/AIDS  and  emerging \nlike  avian \ninfluenza, as part of national health systems development.  \n \n.    \n\ninfectious  diseases \n\nthe  crux  of \n\nfor \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n\nRegional  cooperation  in  CDC  is  justified  if  benefits  exceed  what \ncountries  acting  on  their  own  can  achieve.  In  CDC,  the  rationale \nfor  regional  cooperation  can  be  broken  down  into  four  broad \ncategories,  namely:  (i)  transmission  of  communicable  diseases, \n(ii)  technology  transfers,  (iii)  economies  of  scale  and  greater \nleverage, and (iv) regional public goods for health. \n \nCDC  and  health  systems  in  general  have  developed  in  relative \nisolation. International boundaries reinforced national approaches \nto  health  systems  and  disease  control  in  the  \u201cpre-globalization\u201d \nera,  when  borders  barred  the  movement  of  people  and  goods. \nHowever,  in  recent  years,  globalization  has  transformed  borders \nfrom  barriers  to  bridges,  and  this  transformation  has  shifted \nattention to cross-border matters that localities have in common.  \n \nThe  emergence  in  the  GMS  of  SARS  and  avian  influenza  have \ndemonstrated  that  the  economic  impact  from  these  diseases \namounts  to  billions  of  dollars  through  declining  tourism,  reduced \nflows  of  foreign  investment,  and  export  restrictions  on  livestock \nand  animal  products.  A  human  avian  influenza  pandemic  may \ncause millions of deaths and an economic meltdown. To enhance \nnational  economic  and  health  security,  epidemics  must  be \ncontained  at  their  source  and  their  potential  spread  in  the  region \nminimized. This will require strong regional efforts for CDC. \n \nThe revised IHR of WHO, approved in May 2005, will serve as the \nnew legal framework for actions to prevent the spread of disease \ninternationally.  Under  the  new  IHR,  countries  will  be  expected  to \nreport  any  public  health  threat.  They  will  establish  and  maintain \nminimum  core  surveillance  and \nto \nsuccessfully implement  the global health security, epidemic alert, \nand response strategy. \n \nRegional  economic  developments,  emerging  diseases  and  their \neconomic impact, and high-level political commitment to attaining \nMDGs  have  generated  strong  support  for  regional  cooperation \nacross health sectors. The current GMS setting favors a regional \napproach  to  CDC  that  can  significantly  improve  the  health  of  the \npoor in the CLV countries.  \n \n \nThe overall anticipated impact of the GMS Regional CDC Project \nis  to  contain  the  spread  of  epidemic  diseases  at  local  level  and \nreduce  the  burden  of  common  endemic  diseases  in  the  CLV \ncountries  by  about  15%  in  the  targeted  provinces,  and  more  for \ncertain specific infections. This will help these countries progress \ntoward  their  health-related  MDGs  for  2015  of  reducing  the  child \nmortality  rate  and  containing  the  spread  of  HIV/AIDS  and  other \ninfections.   \n \n\nresponse  capacities \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\nv\n\nThe  expected  project  outcomes  are  (i)  timely  and  adequate \ncontrol  of  epidemics  that  are  likely  to  have  a  major  impact  on \npublic  health  and  the  economy  in  the  region;  (ii)  improved \ncoverage  of  prevention  and  care  of  communicable  diseases  in \nvulnerable  populations;  and  (iii)  improved  know-how,  policies, \nstandards,  and  coordination  among  countries  to  improve  CDC \nincluding for HIV/AIDS through intergovernmental cooperation.  \n \nActivities  under  the  Project  are  pro-poor,  focusing  on  PHC  and \ncommunity-based  activities  in  priority  provinces.  Women  and \nchildren will be the major beneficiaries of community interventions. \nPriority  will  be  given  to  CDC  in  remote  areas  including  border \nprovinces where many ethnic groups and the poorest reside. \n \nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  approximately  $38.75  million, \nincluding  duties  and  taxes.  Of  the  total,  $19.73  million  or  51%  is \nthe  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $19.02  million  equivalent  or  49% \nrepresents the local currency costs. \n \nThe  Governments  have  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  to  provide  a  grant  of  $30.0  million  from  its  Special  Funds \nresources  (Asian  Development  Fund \nIX  Grants  Program), \nrepresenting  77.4%  of  the  total  project  cost.  WHO  will  contribute \n$0.9  million  for  technical  experts.

The  Communicable \nDiseases  Control  Department  will  be \nthe  coordinating \nImplementing Agency (IA). The health sector support program will \nprovide administrative support. Three national institutions and five \nprovinces will also serve as IAs.  \n \nIn  the  Lao  PDR,  project  implementation  will  be  guided  by  the \nMOH  SC,  chaired  by  the  Minister  of  Health.  The  Department  of \nHygiene  and  Prevention  will  be  the  coordinating  IA,  and  will  be \nsupported  by  the  Department  of  Planning  and  Budgeting  in \nplanning,  procurement,  financial  management,  and  reporting. \nThree national institutions and six provinces will also serve as IAs.  \n \nIn  Viet  Nam,  project  implementation  will  be  guided  by  the  MOH \nSC  for  ADB-funded  projects,  chaired  by  the  Vice-Minister  of \nHealth  for  Preventive  Services.  The  Viet  Nam  Administration  of \nPreventive  Medicine  will  be  the  EA  and  coordinating  IA.

It  will  give  guidance in project  implementation,  policy \ndialogue, and the building of regional capacity and cooperation for \nCDC,  and  will  facilitate  country  decisions  on  the  use  of  pooled \nfunds  for  regional  activities.  It  will  be  chaired  by  the  minister  or \nvice-minister  of  the  host  country  and  will  consist  of  leading \nrepresentatives from the national SCs, project directors, and ADB \nand  WHO  representatives.  A  regional  coordination  unit  (RCU)  to \nbe  set  up  in  Hanoi  will  act  as  the  secretariat  for  regional \ncoordination activities and the management of regional funds.  \n \nTo facilitate the flow of funds for regional activities, $4.3 million, or \n11%  of  the  project  funds,  will  be  administered  by  ADB  as  a \nregional  CDC  fund  for  regional  collaboration,  managed  by  the \nRCU.  This  fund  will  cover  expenditures  for  the  Project\u2019s  regional \nSC,  technical  forums,  international  consulting  services,  regional \nitself.  ADB\u2019s \nstudies,  cross-border  activities,  and \nadministration  of \nis  considered \nnecessary  to  ensure  the  efficient  release  of  funds.  The  regional \nCDC  fund  will  be  financed  from  ADB\u2019s  share  of  the  grant  on  the \nbasis  of  a  ratio  of  30:20:50  for  Cambodia,  Lao  PDR,  and  Viet \nNam,  respectively.  The  contribution  to  the  RCU  and  regional \nactivities  will  follow  this  ratio,  subject  to  country  approval,  except \nfor the financing of studies, for which the country contributions will \nbe determined on a case-by-case basis by the regional SC.  \n \nWHO  has  been  requested  to  engage  and  manage  nine  types  of \ninternational  consulting  services,  including  for  surveillance  and \nresponse,  dengue,  and  endemic  diseases,  as  it  has  special \nexpertise  in  this  area.  ADB  will  provide  $1.6  million  from  the \nregional  CDC  fund\u2014representing  $0.48  million  of  its  grant \nallocation  for  Cambodia,  $0.32  million  for  Lao  PDR,  and  0.80 \nmillion for Viet Nam\u2014and WHO will provide $0.9 million, for a total \nof  $2.5  million.  This  arrangement  has  been  agreed  to  by  the \nrecipients  of  the  grant  and  is  reflected  in  the  grant  agreements. \nWHO  and  ADB  have  agreed  to  sign  a  project  implementation \nagreement  authorizing  WHO  to  recruit  and  manage  international \nexperts according to procedures acceptable to ADB and subject to \nthe  approval  of  candidates  by  ADB  (see  para.  93).  The  project \nimplementation agreement specifies, among others, (i) the type of \nexperts  to  be  provided  by  WHO,  (ii)  the  manner  in  which  these \nexperts  will  operate \nin  close  coordination  with  MOH,  and \n(iii) implementation  arrangements  for  the  selection  of  experts, \nreporting, disbursement, and performance review.  \n\n\fviii \n\nProcurement \n\n \n\nADB-financed  goods  and  services  will  be  procured  according  to \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines for  Procurement  and  the  relevant  laws  in  each \ncountry.  However,  if  there  is  any  inconsistency  between  ADB\u2019s \nrequirements  and  the  national  laws,  ADB\u2019s  requirements  will \nprevail.  Equipment  will  be  procured  through  (i)  international \ncompetitive  bidding  for  contracts  worth  at  least  $1  million; \n(ii) international shopping for contracts worth at least $100,000 but \nless  than  $1  million  for  the  Governments  of  Cambodia  and  Lao \nPDR,  and  at  least  $350,000  but  less  than  $1  million  for  the \nGovernment  of  Viet  Nam;  and  (iii) local  competitive  bidding  or \ndirect  purchase  for  items  valued  at  less  than  $100,000  for  the \nGovernments of Cambodia and Lao PDR, and less than $350,000 \nfor  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam.  The  procurement  of  equipment \nand  supplies  will  be  managed  by  each  EA,  which  may  delegate \nthis task to IAs for items valued at less than $20,000 in Lao PDR \nand Cambodia, and $50,000 in Viet Nam. \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  for  238  person-months  of  international \nand  1,176  person-months  of  national  consulting  services.  Of  the \ninternational  consultants,  the  regional  project  coordinator,  the \nhealth  system  development  expert,  and  the  HIV/AIDS  chief \ntechnical  adviser  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  as \nindividual \nconsultants  for  a  total  of  68  person-months  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  International  experts  for \nsurveillance  and  response,  outbreak  preparedness,  virology, \ndengue  control,  control  of  endemic  diseases,  legislation,  and \nhealth  information  system  will  be  contracted  for  a  total  of  170 \nperson-months by WHO as implementing agency according to its \nrules and regulations for administrative procedures and practices. \nADB-funded experts engaged by WHO must first be approved by \nADB  and  MOH.  Domestic  consultants  will  be  engaged  as \nindividual  consultants  by  each  MOH  according  to  procedures \nacceptable to ADB. \n     \nThe  Project  will  help  improve  the  health  of  targeted  populations \nand thereby increase their productivity, and help progress toward \nthe health-related MDGs. The Project will improve prevention and \ncontrol of communicable diseases, intergovernmental cooperation \nin  containing  and  eliminating  diseases,  and  also  contribute  to \nstrengthening national health systems.  \n \nActivities  under  the  Project  are  targeted  toward  the  poor  in \ngeneral  and  those  living  in  remote  locations  including  border \nareas,  where  many  ethnic  groups  and  the  most  poor  reside. \nWomen  and  children  will  be  the  major  beneficiaries  of  these \ncommunity-level interventions.   \n \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\nProject  Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n\fRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\nix\n\nand \n\nand \n\nprovincial \n\nstrengthening \n\nThe  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  will  come  from  (i)  helping \nprevent major epidemics; (ii) productivity gains from an increased \nlifespan  and  reduced  mortality;  (iii) productivity  gains \nfrom \nimproved  achievements  in  education,  especially  through  less \nabsenteeism  and  reduced  dropout  rates;  and  (iv)  public  and \nprivate savings in health expenditures, including indirect costs.  \n \nThe  Project  has  some  technical  risks  in  the  effectiveness  of \ncontrol  measures,  in  particular  for  dengue  and  community-based \nsurveillance in general. These technical risks will be mitigated by \npartnering  with  WHO,  hiring  more  national  staff  to  build  local \ncapacity, \ncommunity \ninvolvement.  Institutional  networking  and  regional  collaboration \nwill also help strengthen the implementation capacity of provinces. \n \nPrevious ADB projects showed project management to be critical \nto  achieving  results.  Each  coordinating  IA  will  have  a  project \nmanagement  unit,  which  will  be  supported  by  existing  project \nadministrative  capacity  in  each  MOH  in  areas  like  planning, \nprocurement, financial management, monitoring, and reporting.    \n \nRegional  cooperation  is  known  to  require  considerable  front-end \ncosts  with  low  immediate  returns  because  of  an  \u201cincubation \nperiod.\u201d  However,  these  costs  should  be  offset  by  substantial \nbenefits  from  regional  disease  control,  technology  transfer,  and \nstrengthened national commitment for health sector development, \nall of which will have long-term value across the region. ADB will \nneed  to  provide  substantial  support  for  regional  cooperation  and \nensure that this becomes fully institutionalized in terms of budget, \nstaff, responsibility, and authority in the ministries. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  recurrent  costs  amount  to  about  $1.7  million  in \n2009,  the  final  year  of  implementation,  and  $1.1  million  by  2012. \nThe  three  governments  confirmed  that  the  increased  recurrent \ncost resulting from the Project can be covered by their respective \nhealth budgets. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f103  00'Eo\n\n108  00'Eo\n\nGREATER MEKONG SUBREGION\nREGIONAL COMMUNICABLE DISEASES\nCONTROL PROJECT\n\n9\n\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\nCAMBODIA\n\nLuangnamtha\nLUANGNAMTHA\n\nPHONGSALY\n\nBan Houei Sai\n\nOUDOMXAY\n\nBOKEO\n\nPak Mong\n\nLUANGPRABANG\n\nLuangprabang\n\nHOUAPHANH\n\n20  00'No\n\n1\n\n2\n\n7\n\nLao Cai\n\nYen Bai\n4\n\n8\n\n3\n\n5\n\n6\n\n10\n\nNuihong\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n16\n\nLang Son\n\n18\nKep\n\n17\n\nNa Duoung\n\nHANOI\n\n14 19\n\n20\n\n15\n\nCai Lan\n\nHoa Binh\n\n23\n\n24\n\n21\n\n22\n\nHaiphong\n\n27\n\n25\n\n26\nNam Doth\n\nThanh Hoa\n\nGulf  of  Tonkin\n\nL A O  P D R\n\nXAYABURY\n\nXieng Khouang\n\nXIENGKHUANG\n\nVang Vieng\n\nXAYSOMBOUN\nSPECIAL REGION\n\nVIENTIANE\n\nVIENTIANE\n\nVIENTIANE\nMUNICIPALITY\n\n28\n\nBORIKHAMXAY\nPakkading\n\nBan Lao\n\nVinh\n\n29\n\nT H A I L A N D\n\nDa Nang\n\nKHAMMUANE\n\nThakhek\n\nTanap\n\n30\n\nDong Ha\n\n31\n\nHue\n\nSavannakhet\n\nSAVANNAKHET\n\n32\n\nM\n\ne\nk\n\no\n\nn\n\ng\n\n \n \n\nR\n\ni\n\nv\n\ne\n\nr\n\nSARAVANE\n\nSEKONG\n\nPakse\n\nAttapeau\n\nCHAMPASACK\n\nATTAPEU\n\n33\n\n34\n\n36\n\nProject Area\n\nNational Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nRoad\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\n35\n\nDung Quat\n\nDietri\n\n38\n\n37\n\nQuy Nhon\n\nV I E T  N A M\n\n39\n\n40\n\nNha Trang\n\n42\n\nDa Lat\n\n43\n\n44\n\n49\n\nPhan Thiet\n\nThap Cham\n\nODDAR MEACHEY\n\nBANTEAY MEANCHEY\n\nPoipet\n\nSIEM  REAP\n\nSisophon\n\nPREAH   VIHEAR\n\nSiem Reap\n\nKRONG\nPAILIN BATTAMBANG\n\nTonle Sap\n\nVeune Kham\n\nRATTANAK\nKIRI\n\nDong Kralor\n\nSTUNG TRENG\n\nStung Treng\n\nPURSAT\n\nKOMPONG\nCHHNANG\n\nKOMPONG\nTHOM\n\nC A M B O D I A\n\nKRATIE\n\nKampong Cham\n\nMONDOL  KIRI\n\n41\n\nKOMPONG\nCHAM\n\n45\n\nPREY\nVENG\n\n46\n\nSVAY\nRIENG\n\nKANDAL\nSvay Rieng\n\n47\nDo Dau\n51\n\n48\n\nKRONG PREAN\nSIHANOUK\n\nSihannoukville\n\nTAKEO\n\nKAMPOT\n\nKampot\n\nKRONG KAEB\n\nHa Tien\n\n55\n\n54\n\n52\n\n53\n\nHo Chi Minh City\n50\n\nVung Tau\n\n12  00'No\n\nGulf  of  Thailand\n\nKoh Kong\n\nPHNOM PENH\nKOMPONG\nSPEU\n\nKOH  KONG\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\nN\n\nKilometers\n\n58\n\n59\n\n60\n\n56\n\n57\n\n61\n\n62\n\n63\n\n64\n\nNan Can\n\no\n103  00'E\n\nSOUTH  CHINA\nSEA\n\n108  00'Eo\n\nxi\n\n20  00'No\n\nPROVINCES\n\n1.

At the GMS summit meetings in 2002 and 2005, \nthe six heads of government declared their vision of a subregion free from poverty and able to \nprovide sustainable development opportunities for their populations. The Regional Cooperation \nStrategy and Program 2004\u20132008 revolves around four main elements: connectivity and cross-\nborder  facilitation;  integration  of  national  markets  for  economic  efficiency  and  private  sector \ndevelopment; environmental and natural resource management; and human development.  \n \n4. \nRegional  cooperation  is  justified  if  benefits  exceed  what  countries  acting  on  their  own \ncan  achieve.  Specifically  for  CDC,  the  rationale  for  regional  cooperation  can  be  broken  down \ninto four broad categories: \n \n\nNature  of  communicable  disease  transmission:  Communicable  diseases  are \ntransmitted  by  people,  vectors,  food,  and  elements  throughout  a  particular \ngeographic region irrespective of national borders.  \n\nTechnology  transfer:  Regional  cooperation  enables  participating  countries  to \nshare  experiences  and  knowledge  about  health  policies,  system  design,  and \ndisease  control,  and  apply  lessons  learned.  These  technology  transfers  also \nfacilitate greater consistency, clarity, and transparency among countries in CDC \nand other health matters. \n\nEconomies  of  scale  and  greater  leverage:  Regional  cooperation  helps  to \nachieve  economies  of  scale  for  more  efficient  resource  allocation,  e.g.,  sharing \ndesign  work,  testing,  expertise,  and  procurement.  Also,  participating  countries \ncan acquire greater leverage in attracting donor funding by aggregating particular \nunderfunded endemic diseases. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1  The Project is included in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) program for 2005.  \n2  A  regional  TA  was  provided  under  ADB.  2004.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia,  the  Lao \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic, and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Preparing the Greater Mekong Subregion \nRegional Communicable Diseases Control Project (JSF). Manila. The TA included four regional workshops.  \n\n\f2 \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\nRegional  public  goods  for  health:  Programs  to  prevent  HIV/AIDS  and  other \ninfectious  diseases  are  regional  public  goods  (RPGs).  The  weakest  link  in  a \nchain  determines  the  chain\u2019s  overall  strength,  and  thus  coordination  in  disease \nprevention  programs  and  the  raising  of  standards  across  countries  will  provide \ngreater protection for the populations in the region.  \n\n \n5. \nCDC  and  health  systems  in  general  have  developed  in  relative  isolation.  International \nboundaries  reinforced  national  approaches  to  health  systems  and  disease  control  in  the  \u201cpre-\nglobalization\u201d era, when borders barred the movement of people and goods. However, in recent \nyears,  globalization  has  transformed  borders  from  barriers  to  bridges,  and  this  transformation \nhas shifted attention to cross-border matters that localities have in common. Regional economic \ndevelopments, catalytic events and their economic impact, and high-level political commitment \nto attaining Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have generated strong support for regional \ncooperation across health sectors. The current GMS setting favors a regional approach to CDC \nthat can significantly improve the health of the poor in the CLV countries. \n \nDespite the strong rationale for regional cooperation in CDC and broader health systems \n6. \ndevelopment, regional initiatives in the GMS health sector have been limited. New approaches \nto CDC are manifested in the Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance Program (MBDSP), financed \nby the Rockefeller Foundation, and the ongoing revision of the international health regulations \n(IHR) by WHO. With the support of MBDSP, a major landmark was achieved in 2001 when the \nsix GMS ministers of health signed an agreement to share disease information and cooperate to \ncontrol diseases across borders.  \n \nThe revised IHR of WHO, approved in May 2005, will serve as the new legal framework \n7. \nfor actions to prevent the spread of disease internationally. Under the new IHR, countries will be \nexpected to report any (potential) epidemic or other public health threat. They will establish and \nmaintain  minimum  core  surveillance  and  response  capacities  to  successfully  implement  the \nglobal health security, epidemic alert, and response strategy.3 \n \nB. \n \nAs  reflected  in  the  United  Nations  Millennium  Statement,  \u201cWe  the  Peoples,\u201d  human \n8. \ndevelopment  is  the  crux  of  poverty  reduction  and  economic  growth.  Four  out  of  eight  MDGs \nrelate  directly  to  health  and  nutrition\u2014reducing  child  and  maternal  mortality  and  malnutrition, \nand  containing  and  beginning  to  reverse  the  trend  of  HIV/AIDS4  and  other  communicable \ndiseases.  In  the  GMS  and  elsewhere,  human  development  plays  a  major  role  in  economic \ngrowth and poverty reduction.  \n \n9. \nThe  CLV  countries  have  made  remarkable  progress  in  improving  the  health  of  their \npopulations over the past decades, and are making major efforts to putting in place strong policy \nframeworks  and  expanding  primary  health  care  (PHC).  However,  as  discussed  at  the  Fifth \nMeeting  of  the  GMS  Working  Group  on  Human  Resource  Development  (HRD)  in  Yangon  in \nJune 2004, the CLV countries may not achieve the health-related MDGs of reduction of under-5 \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n                                                 \n3   The  revised  international  health  requlations  were  endorsed  by  the  World  Health  Assembly  in  May  2005  with  a \n\nproposed implementation date of June 2006.  \n\n4   Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3\n\nchild  mortality,  maternal  mortality,  and  malnutrition  based  on  current  challenges  and  efforts \n(Appendix 2).5  \n \n10. \nAchieving MDGs will require targeting poor and remote populations, women and infants, \nethnic minorities, and people living in border areas. These populations are suffering from a high \nburden  of  reproductive  illnesses  and  common  infections  such  as  malaria,  diarrhea,  typhoid \nfever,  acute  respiratory  infections,  measles,  tuberculosis,  and  parasitic  infections.  Without \nappropriate care these diseases result in high mortality, disability, and malnutrition. The impact \nof infectious diseases on learning and productivity is profound.  \n \n11. \nIn the past decade, the region has experienced major increases in HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C \nand  dengue,  which  can  spread  easier  through  increased  market  integration,  connectivity,  and \nmovements  of  people  and  goods.  Cambodia  has  a  generalized  HIV/AIDS  epidemic,  the  Lao \nPDR is surrounded by countries with generalized or concentrated HIV/AIDS epidemics, and Viet \nNam has a concentrated epidemic in high-risk groups. Social changes and increasing inequity \nare also likely to accelerate the spread of HIV/AIDS.  \n \n12.  More recently, the region has been the center of outbreaks of severe acute respiratory \nsyndrome  (SARS)  and  avian  influenza  (AI).  Already  at  this  level  of  relatively  minor  human \nimpact,  the  economic  impact  of  AI  has  been  substantial,  amounting  to  billions  of  dollars  in \nlosses through declining tourism, reduced flows of foreign investment, and export restrictions on \nlivestock  and  animal  products.  A  human  AI  pandemic  may  cause  millions  of  deaths  and  an \neconomic  meltdown.  To  enhance  national  economic  and  health  security,  epidemics  must  be \ncontained at their source and their potential spread in the region minimized, requiring regional \nsupport  for  CDC.  This  will  require  reaching  all  communities  with  basic  prevention  and  control \nsystems, including those not reached so far.   \n \n13. \nSince  the  CLV  countries  emerged  from  war,  their  respective  Governments  have  been \nfully  committed  to  building  up  a  network  of  PHC  facilities  and  improving  human  resources.  At \nthe  same  time,  the  private  sector  has  been  expanding,  with  private  practitioners,  drug  shops, \nand  paramedics  becoming  major  providers  of  basic  curative  care.  The  impact  of  these \ndevelopments  can  be  seen  in  service  coverage  indicators  in  Cambodia  and  the  Lao  PDR. \nAccess to essential drugs now stands at about 50% in Cambodia, 80% in Lao PDR, and 85% in \nViet Nam. The Lao PDR has achieved this coverage in part through community-based care, in \ncontrast  to  the  more  institution-based  services  in  the  other  countries.  However,  immunization \nrates are lower in the Lao PDR, at about 36\u201365% compared with 43\u201376% in Cambodia and 78\u2013\n99%  in  Viet  Nam.  Modern  contraceptive  medicine  coverage  among  couples  is  19%  in \nCambodia, 29% in the Lao PDR, and 56% in Viet Nam, another area of concern.  \n \n14. \nThe  market-oriented  reforms  introduced  in  the  CLV  countries  in  the  late  1980s  and \n1990s  opened  up  opportunities  for  private  providers.  Urban  people  now  have  more  options  in \nselecting  their  health-care  providers.  The  growth  of  privately  owned  pharmacies  has  made \ndrugs  and  supplies  more  widely  available.  However,  few  private  doctors  set  up  clinics  in  rural \nareas,  where  the  purchasing  power  is  very  low.  The  private  sector  is  largely  unregulated  and \noften wasteful and of substandard quality. Affordability of health services has been declining as \nthe gap between the rich and the poor increases.   \n \n\n                                                 \n5  Millennium Development Goals are standard global targets and are ambitious for Lao PDR, with its difficult terrain, \nhigh  poverty,  and  large  ethnic  minority  population.  Current  trends  indicate  that  achieving  projections  will  require \nintensified efforts, as further improvements in the indicators will become relatively more difficult.  \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nIn  particular,  CLV  Governments  will  need  to  improve  access  to  PHC  for  vulnerable \n15. \npopulations, and improve the affordability and quality of health care. Access to health services is \na  particular  problem  for  ethnic  minorities,  many  of  them  living  in  hilly  areas.  Language \ndifferences  between  health  staff  and  the  ethnic  minorities  present  another  barrier.  Health \nservices  use  out-of-pocket  payment  for  medicines  and  services,  which  the  poor  can  often  not \npay for when they require the care. For various reasons, there is a serious lack of qualified staff \nin rural areas. Even more fundamental are problems besetting the health systems themselves \nincluding low staff salaries, supervision and supply constraints, inadequate integration of vertical \nprograms  and  PHC,  limited  provincial  planning  and  budgeting  capacity,  and  fiscal  constraints. \nAn analysis of the challenges in the health sector is in Appendix 3. \n \n16. \nPublic  expenditures  on  health  do  not  reflect  the  recent  economic  gains.  Public  health \nspending  in  the  CLV  countries  is  still  only  about  1.6\u20131.7%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP), \ncausing  major  financial  constraints  in  public  health  services.  But  the  countries  differ  widely  in \ntotal health spending, at 11.8% of GDP in Cambodia, 3.1% in the Lao PDR, and 5.1% in Viet \nNam. Per capita spending per year is $30 in Cambodia, $10 in Lao PDR, and $21 in Viet Nam, \ncompared  with  $49  in  PRC,  $69  in  Thailand,  and  the  international  minimum  standard  of  $34. \nAbout 13% of health spending in Viet Nam is donor-financed, versus about 30% in Cambodia \nand the Lao PDR. Public sector spending in the Lao PDR is about 50% of total health spending, \ncompared with 13% in Cambodia and 28% in Viet Nam.  \n \n17. \nFollowing the influx of donors after the war, the Government of Cambodia has taken bold \nsteps  to  bring  donors  together  under  one  program,  and  contract  out  health  services  to \nnongovernment agencies. The Health Sector Support Plan 2003\u201307 is the basis for sector-wide \nmanagement by Cambodia\u2019s Ministry of Health (MOH) and serves as an umbrella framework for \nhealth activities under the National Poverty Reduction Scheme. The plan specifies six key areas \nof  work:  (i)  health  service  delivery,  (ii) behavioral  change  and  communication,  (iii)  quality \nimprovement, (iv) HRD, (v) health financing, and (vi) institutional development.6 MOH follows a \nstrong  system  approach,  promoting  village  health  support  groups  and  health  center \nmanagement  committees,  integrated  management  of  childhood  illnesses  (IMCI),  consumer \nconfidence  in  health  services,  and  ethical  conduct.  CDC  is  to  be  fully  integrated  with  PHC  at \nprovincial level and below.   \n \n18. \nThe  Government  of  the  Lao  PDR  has  consistently  tried  to  build  up  the  national  health \nsystem, starting from a very limited capacity. It has succeeded in improving access to services, \nbut  must  now  operate  an  expanded  health  system  with  scant  resources  for  a  largely  poor \npopulation. The  country\u2019s  MOH  has  developed  a  poverty-focused  health  development  plan  for \n2005\u20132010  within  the  general  framework  of  the  National  Growth  and  Poverty  Eradication \nStrategy, the Health Sector Strategy 2020, and the Health Sector Master Plan. The Government \nwants  to  give  every  citizen  access  to  essential  health  care.  MOH  is  undertaking  a  strategic \nplanning exercise, including the preparation of provincial strategic plans and 5-year plans. It is \nalso forming task forces to review key subsectors and draw up development plans for them. The \nGovernment gives high priority to CDC, and has been increasing funding for CDC programs, in \nparticular for malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS control supported by the Global Fund. While a \nstrong PHC network is in place, integration of CDC and PHC needs more work.  \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n6  Government of Cambodia, MOH. 2004. Pushing the Momentum for Health Sector Development: The First Health \n\nSector Annual Operational Plan, 2005. Phnom Penh. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n\nThe  Government  of  Viet  Nam  had  a  pro-health  policy  for  decades,  resulting  in  a  well-\n19. \ndeveloped  health  system.  However,  the  system  has  suffered  from  some  of  the  negative \nconsequences  of  much-needed  reforms.  The  Government  is  making  efforts  to  improve  the \npublic  health  system  and  address  the  increasing  gap  between  the  rich  and  the  poor  through \nfinancing  reforms  and  targeted  support.  Its  aim  is  to  give  all  communes  full  access  to  health \nservices, have health workers in all villages, adjust user fees to suit costs as well as the ability \nto  pay,  expand  health  insurance,  and  improve  the  supply  of  drugs  and  medical  equipment. \nViet Nam is now implementing the health development plan for 2001\u20132005, with targets set for \n2010.  It  is  increasing  recurrent  public  health  spending  to  5%  of  government  expenditure  or  at \nleast 1% of GDP, and especially targeting disadvantaged areas. Viet Nam\u2019s health development \nstrategy is further elaborated in subsector and area plans. The Government\u2019s health targets for \n2010 include the control of common communicable diseases such as malaria, dengue, hepatitis \nB, and Japanese encephalitis. Integration of CDC and PHC and reaching vulnerable groups at \nprovincial level and below is also a major challenge in Viet Nam. \n \nC. \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nCommunicable Disease Priorities \n\n20. \nEmerging Diseases. Outbreaks of newly emerging diseases such as SARS in 2003 and \nAI in 2004 and 2005 have so far had little impact on health in the region, but could have vastly \nmore  devastating  effects.  The  case  fatality  rate  for  SARS  is  around  10%  and  for  human  AI \nabout 50%. As of the end of May 2005, 50 people in Viet Nam had died from AI, or 80% of all \ndeaths  in  the  region.  Cambodia  has  had  four  deaths  in  Kampot  province.  However,  scientists \nindicate that the AI virus may mutate or reassort into another virus that spreads in humans like \nan ordinary flu virus. This could cause a global pandemic with millions of deaths in the region. \n   \n21. \nThese  emerging  diseases,  even  with  limited  health  impact,  have  major  economic \nconsequences. SARS slowed economic growth by reducing tourism and communication. GDP \nin the region could have declined by 0.2\u20131.8 percentage points if SARS had persisted for one \neconomic quarter, and, GDP in the individual countries could have fallen by 0.5\u20134.0 percentage \npoints if it had gone on for two quarters.7  While the CLV countries do not have a major poultry \nexport industry like Thailand, AI has probably reduced GDP by about 0.5% in Viet Nam.8 More \nimportantly,  it  has  had  a  major  impact  at  the  local  level  on  poor  backyard  farmers  and  wet \nmarkets. Viet Nam has culled almost a quarter of its national poultry stock. A human pandemic \nmay cause an economic meltdown.   \n \n22. \nThe fast spread of these diseases and their potential consequences highlight the need \nfor regional collaboration in CDC. Such a strategy must entail the strengthening of surveillance \nand response systems from community-level workers detecting outbreaks to laboratory facilities \nand  provincial  and  national  response  centers.  Cooperation  across  the  health  and  agriculture \nsectors  is  important  for  AI.  AI  requires  better  poultry  biosecurity  and  vaccination,  improved \npreparedness  and  response  of  public  and  private  services  including  quarantine  arrangements \nand medicines, and risk profiling and monitoring the spread and genotype of the virus in hosts. \nThe  ministries  of  agriculture  in  the  region  are  performing  animal  surveillance  with  assistance \nfrom  the  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization.  Laboratory  conditions  for  the  cultivation  of  the  AI \nvirus in the national animal health laboratories are substandard and pose a biohazard.  \n \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2003. Economic Research Department Policy Brief No. 15. Manila. \n8  An  initial  economic  impact  assessment  is  available  as  a  separate  report  (and  has  already  been  circulated  within \n\nADB). \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nEarly  and  accurate  detection  is  also  a  vital  element  in  preventing  the  spread  of  other \n23. \ninfectious  diseases  like  measles,  dengue,  typhoid,  and  cholera.  Beyond  the  rise  of  emerging \ndiseases,  the  capacities  of  the  CLV  countries\u2019  health  systems  will  be  further  challenged  by \nWHO\u2019s introduction of new IHR  mandating that governments report any outbreak of infectious \ndiseases  (and  possibly  chemical  and  radiological  threat)  starting  in  June  2006,  as  discussed \nbelow.  The  health  surveillance  and  monitoring  systems  in  the  CLV  countries  already  required \nlong-term assistance to strengthen the capacity to generate reliable, timely, routine data before \nSARS  and  AI,  and  thus  the  emergence  of  new,  complicated  communicable  diseases  is \ncompounding  the  pressures  placed  on  the  surveillance  systems.  While  most  diseases  require \nbasic  laboratory  procedures,  some  of  them,  such  as  AI,  require  more  complicated  laboratory \nprocedures for confirmation done in bio-safety level-3 laboratories. \n  \nThe CLV countries cannot cope with a major outbreak of emerging disease. At present \n24. \nthere  are  no  human  vaccines  available  for  the  types  of  newly  emerging  diseases  that  are \nthreatening the region. Experience with AI cases in Viet Nam suggests that currently available \ntreatment is of limited benefit. Only few hospitals can manage a limited number of AI cases and \nare not prepared for any major epidemic. Even if vaccines and drugs were available, production \ncapacity  would  not  be  able  to  cope  with  demand.  While  national  preparedness  plans  are \navailable, this has mostly not translated in concrete action plans in the various sectors.  \n    \nHIV/AIDS. The Lao PDR and Viet Nam now have low prevalence of HIV/AIDS, but both \n25. \ncountries  have  neighbors  with  high  prevalence  rates,  namely,  Cambodia  and  Thailand.  Viet \nNam has a growing HIV/AIDS problem in the form of a concentrated epidemic among high-risk \ngroups, including injecting drug users and sex workers. As of 31 May 2005, Viet Nam reported a \ncumulative  total  of  93,402  cases  of  HIV  cases.  The  HIV  prevalence  is  about  57%  in  injecting \ndrug users and 3% in sex workers. The infections are concentrated in cities and along the roads \nand borders in hot spots, in particular the borders with Cambodia and the PRC. Cambodia has a \nmaturing  HIV/AIDS  epidemic,  with  around  1.9%  of  the  population  aged  15\u201349  infected  with \nHIV\u2014down from 2.2% in 2001, but an increasing prevalence among rural women. As a result of \npast high infection rates, Cambodia is estimated to have more than 120,000 people now living \nwith  HIV/AIDS,  composing  1.9%  of  the  population  aged  15\u201349.  The  impact  on  GDP  and  the \ncost of health services is substantial. In the Lao PDR, 1,636 HIV positive cases were detected \nbetween 1990 and 2005. While this figure is low by regional standards, particular \u201chot spots\u201d in \nthe  country  have  emerged,  where  service  women  have  high  HIV  prevalence  rates;  Bokeo,  for \ninstance,  has  4%  HIV  prevalence  among  service  women,  and  Savannakhet  3.2%.  The  Joint \nUnited Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) expects HIV prevalence in the Lao PDR to \ndouble every 1\u20132 years over the next few years. \n \n26. \nHIV/AIDS  funding  for  Viet  Nam  is  substantial  but  further  support  is  particularly  needed \nfor harm reduction, continuum of care, prevention among youth, and regional collaboration and \nresearch. Cambodia is currently only able to provide antiretroviral treatment to half of the AIDS \npatients  and  needs  support  for  continuum  of  care.  While  the  Lao  PDR  has  low  HIV/AIDS \nprevalence, it must expand prevention and care to contain the epidemic as much as possible.   \n \n27.  Most activities for HIV/AIDS prevention and control can be handled through national and \nprovincial  programs,  but  particular  cross-border  HIV/AIDS \nissues  and  challenges  are \ndemonstrating the need for selected regional initiatives as well. A major concern is that the inter-\ncountry  mobility  of  people,  facilitated  in  great  part  by  the  provision  of  roads  and  other \ninfrastructure with the support of international and regional development institutions, will make \nHIV/AIDS  much  more  difficult  to  prevent  and  control.  Sex  workers,  trafficked  women, \nconstruction workers, truck drivers, and other mobile groups moving across different parts of the \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7\n\nGMS contribute greatly to the spread of the disease and are often beyond the reach of health \nservice  providers  for  detection  and  treatment.  Regional  cooperation  is  necessary  to  address \nthese potential sources of transmission. \n \nNeglected  Endemic  Diseases.  Intensive  efforts  are  under  way  to  control  and  prevent \n28. \ncommunicable  diseases  such  as  HIV/AIDS,  tuberculosis,  and  malaria  in  the  CLV  countries. \nHowever,  acute  respiratory  infections,  infectious  diarrhea,  typhoid,  cholera,  food-borne \ndiseases,  dengue,  and  parasitic  diseases  are  significant  causes  of  morbidity  and  mortality. \nThese  diseases,  increasingly  being  referred  to  as  neglected  endemic  diseases,  are  often \nconcentrated  in  poor  and  ethnic  minorities  living  in  remote  rural  areas  (or  urban  slums  in  the \ncase  of  dengue).  Thus,  neglected  diseases  primarily  affect  poor  and  vulnerable  communities, \nand  they  disproportionately  affect  women  and  children.  The  high  morbidity  from  neglected \ndiseases  affects  school  attendance,  cognitive  development,  physical  growth,  and  overall \nproductivity. Worm infestations like helminthiasis, filariasis, and schistosomiasis, which receive \nvery  little  donor  attention,  make  up  a  special  group  of  neglected  diseases.  Controlling  these \ninfections would result in major health and education benefits to children. Highly cost-effective \ninterventions  are  available  to  manage  most  common  infections,  but  budget  shortages  and \nselective  donor  priorities  have  hampered  provincial  and  local  health  offices  to  tackle  these \ncommon problems. \n \nIn  addition  to  the  comparatively  low  funding  for  neglected  endemic  diseases,  the \n29. \nprevention  and  treatment  of  these  diseases  is  hampered  by  the  absence  of  an  integrated \napproach to dealing with them at the district and community levels. Integrated local planning for \nmanaging these diseases is insufficient (or absent). Local health planning and services usually \ntake  a  selective  approach  to  prioritized  diseases.  The  CLV  countries  have  implemented  the \nIMCI  Program,  which  manages  acute  childhood  illnesses  in  an  integrated  manner,  but  the \nprogram is not well funded and has limited coverage. Moreover, IMCI is often not implemented \nwell, because disparate vertical programs are often not integrated and dominate the local health \nworkers\u2019 time and attention as well-funded donors\u2019 programs take precedence. These programs \nshould  be  mainstreamed  in  comprehensive  provincial  and  district  health  plans  through  an \nintegrated  PHC  mechanism.  The  comprehensive,  integrated  care  mechanism  should  also  link \ndirectly  to  the  surveillance  and  response  system,  whereby  health  workers  providing  treatment \nfor endemic diseases also feed into the reporting system.  \n \n\n2. \n\nVulnerable Populations \n\n30.  Mobile Populations. A priority in the GMS has been facilitating connectivity among the \nmember countries through the provision of transport infrastructure. Greater connectivity results \nin higher flows of people and goods across borders, bringing both benefits and consequences. \nOne  of  the  most  problematic  consequences  is  the  spread  of  communicable  diseases  such  as \nsexually  transmitted  infections  and  HIV/AIDS  as  construction  workers,  traders,  transportation \nproviders, laborers, and service women move into other areas. Busy border crossing areas tend \nto have among the highest prevalence rates of HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases. \n \nRemote  Populations.  Populations  residing  in  remote  locations  including  border  areas \n31. \nare  often  very  poor  and  lack  physical  access  to  health-care  providers.  In  parts  of  the  Mekong \nRegion, people may have to travel more than 25 kilometers on foot to a health post. Both public \nand private sector health-care provision decreases as population density falls, as providers find \nit  difficult  to  work  in  these  places.  Outreach  teams  find  it  difficult  to  reach  remote  villages, \nresulting in lower coverage of immunization and other preventive services in these communities. \nQuarantine stations located at borders can help increase coverage for local populations.   \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n32. \nEthnic  Minorities.  About  60  different  ethnic  groups  live  in  the  GMS.  From  what  is \nknown, they share a high communicable disease burden. Remoteness, migration, language and \nsocial  issues  present  major  obstacles  to  providing  health  care  to  ethnic  minorities.  These \nproblems are compounded by the scarcity of health personnel from ethnic minorities. The Lao \nPDR  has  developed  an  innovative  approach  to  grooming  health  staff  from  ethnic  minority \ngroups, which appears to be working well.  \n \nPoor  Women  and  Children.  Gender  equity  considerations  run  through  all  the  MDGs, \n33. \nincluding  the  health-related  MDGs.  Goal  3,  to  promote  gender  equality  and  empower  women, \nhas targets and indicators related to gender equality in education and literacy, improvements in \nwomen\u2019s  income,  poverty  related  to  the  share  of  women\u2019s  wage  employment,  as  well  as \nwomen\u2019s  representation  issues,  all  of  which  are  important  to  improving  women  and  children\u2019s \nhealth and the health standards of society overall. Gender considerations are emerging as key \nissues in CDC. It is widely recognized that gender inequality is a principal factor in the HIV/AIDS \npandemic  and  sexually  transmitted  infections.  Communicable  diseases  such  as  malaria  are  a \nmajor contributing factor to maternal mortality. Youth are  also increasingly at risk of HIV/AIDS \nanother infectious because of social changes and increasing travel in the region. Children are \nmore  vulnerable  to  infectious  diseases  than  adults,  and  to  delayed  or  inappropriate  medical \ncare. \n \n\n3. \n\nChallenges in National Health Systems  \n\n34. \nThe ultimate purpose of health sector development is to develop a health system that is \nappropriate to a country\u2019s needs and resources, including those related to infectious diseases. \nCDC has to be an integral part of the health system, and indeed bring about positive changes in \nthe health system as experienced with the HIV/AIDS control program in Cambodia. There are \nmany  generic  issues  in  the  health  system  that  affects  CDC,  including  human  resource \nconstraints,  the  management  of  health  services,  and  affordability  and  financing  of  health \nservices.  CDC  must  also  cope  with  several  specific  challenges  including  (i)  integration  of \ndisease control programs in PHC; (ii) staff constraints for preventive care; (iii) standard setting \nand regulation for CDC, in particular for drugs and for private sector regulation; and (iv) regional \nsurveillance and response.  \n \n35. \nThe  health  systems  in  the  three  countries  feature  a  dichotomy  between  preventive \nprograms, usually managed centrally, and provincial health services focusing on treatment. The \ncountries lack a comprehensive approach to health system development; as a result, there are \ncoordination  problems  and  inefficiencies  in  the  health  system.  Current  donor  funding \nmechanisms amplify this situation such that periodic ad hoc and unsustainable investments are \nmade  in  particular  programs  or  disease  interventions,  to  the  extent  that  these  also  undermine \nother  services.  Of  critical  importance  in  the  CLV  countries  is  the  development  of  competent \nprovincial health planning, budgeting, management, and monitoring capacity, with the provinces \nhaving  responsibility  and  authority  for  health  sector  performance,  including  preventive \nprograms. \n \n36. \nIn all three countries, there is insufficient training and skills in epidemiology among the \nhealth  staff  who  are  responsible  for  disease  programs.  Therefore,  the  countries  tend  to \nparticipate  mainly  in  nationally  organized  activities.  A  challenge  is  to  decentralize  CDC \nmanagement  to  the  provinces,  and  reduce  overlap  in  training,  laboratory  services,  and \nsupervision.  Such  problems  have  arisen  in  part  because  of  the  lack  of  comprehensive  and \ncoordinated planning. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n37. \nAlthough  the  extensive  surveillance  network  covers  all  levels  down  to  the  commune \nhealth  centers,  the  coverage  and  functioning  of  the  surveillance  and  response  systems  need \nstrengthening.  This  also  applies  to  diseases  that  receive  substantial  attention  and  support. \nSurveillance  is  further  complicated  by  the  use  of  several  separate  systems  for  prioritized \ndiseases that receive financial and technical support from international organizations. As many \npeople, especially in remote regions, use private health-care providers, a significant amount of \ninformation  regarding  communicable  diseases  is  missing  as  it  is  not  part  of  the  current \nsurveillance  and  response  system.  The  village  level  appears  the  weakest  link  because  of  the \ngeographical and social barriers, and perhaps the low priority given to prevention. \n \n\n4. \n\nShortage of Regional Public Goods \n\n38. \nRPGs receive less attention than global public goods and national public goods, despite \nthe fact that RPGs can help attain global and national public goods. In particular, rates of return \non  regional  investments  are  often  higher  than  individual  country  investments  and  reduce  high \ncosts for smaller economies. This applies equally to RPGs in the health sector. \n \n39. \nClear  gaps  in  RPGs  related  to  health  exist  within  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian \nNations  (ASEAN)  and  the  GMS  countries.  First,  there  is  no  comprehensive  regional  health \ninformation system. Several attempts at regional data and information sharing have been made \n(such  as  ASEAN  Disease  Surveillance.net,  MBDSP,  Asian  Collaborative  Training  Network  for \nMalaria  Web  site,  ADB,  and  WPRO);  none  of  these  has  so  far  achieved  a  satisfactory \ninformation  database.  Sharing  of  health  information  will  require  capacity  building  and  also \nconfidence building among the governments. Research with a regional perspective is minimal. \nResearch related to mobility across borders is particularly important for HIV/AIDS. \n \n40. \nAid agencies often prefer to invest in country-focused programs because of the need to \nestablish ownership and the relative ease of arranging lending and grants with a single country. \nBroader-scale  health  initiatives  by  the  key  multilateral  institutions  tend  to  be  global  in  scope \ninstead of responding to particular regional needs and solutions. These global initiatives prevail \nover regional ones despite the complexities involved in implementing them worldwide, and they \ntend  to  lose  focus  on  the  \u201cweak  links\u201d  (i.e.,  countries  with  limited  capacities)  that  reduce  the \noverall effectiveness of global health initiatives. \n \n41. \nThe  current  setting  appears  in  need  of  regional  collaboration  in  CDC.  WHO  is  revising \nthe  IHR.  The  forthcoming  revisions  will  provide  member  countries  with  a  common  reference \npoint to prevent global health threats and to coordinate international responses to those threats. \nAn  important  element  will  be  regional  capacity  building.  The  recent  epidemics  have  created \nmore political will to exchange information, harmonize quality standards, and learn key lessons \nfrom  one  another.  Additionally,  a  major  landmark  was  achieved  in  2003  when  the  six  GMS \nministers of health signed an agreement to share information as part of the MBDSP financed by \nthe  Rockefeller  Foundation.  Progress  in  ASEAN  and  GMS  has  created  a  strong  institutional \nframework for regional collaboration beyond trade and infrastructure issues.  \n \n42. \nRegional cooperation in the health sector among the GMS countries will require building \ntrust  and  confidence  through  more  frequent  and  focused  dialogue  and  exchange;  developing \nnetworks across the MOHs, public and private health institutes, and other relevant stakeholders; \nlearning  from  one  another\u2019s  experiences;  exchanging  information;  and  embarking  on  joint \nresearch  on  critical  regional  health issues.  Once  the  trust and  networks  are in  place,  then  the \nGMS countries can move on to more challenging regional cooperation health initiatives such as  \nsynchronizing disease control strategies, and setting regional standards for goods and services.   \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nExternal Assistance  \n\nD. \n \n43. \nThe CLV countries receive substantial external assistance to help meet the challenges \nthey  face  in  the  health  and  other  sectors.  However,  assistance  for  regional  CDC  has  been \nlimited. ADB has provided modest regional support for HIV/AIDS and malaria control.9 Canada, \nthe  European  Union,  WHO  and  other  United  Nations  agencies  also  support  regional  CDC.  In \nresponse  to  the  threat  of  an  AI  pandemic,  ADB,  Australia,  Canada,  France,  the  European \nUnion, the United States, and the World Bank are planning major support for AI control, some of \nwhich will be regional.   \n \n44. \nAt country level, total disbursements for Cambodia\u2019s health sector reached $90.3 million \nin 2003, about one third of health spending.10 Major donors are the United States, Japan, and \nthe United Kingdom. ADB supports the Health Sector Support Program (HSSP)11 in partnership \nwith  the  Department  for  International  Development  (United  Kingdom)  and  the  World  Bank. \nAssistance  to  HIV/AIDS  funding  went  up  from  $15  million  in  2001  to  more  than  $34  million  in \n2003.  HIV/AIDS,  tuberculosis  and  malaria  control  will  together  receive  63%  of  assistance.12 \nAbout 45% of total donor spending on health is for CDC.   \n \n45. \nIn  the  Lao  PDR,  about  one  third  of  health  spending  is  thought  to  come  from  external \nassistance.  ADB  supports  PHC  development  in  the  northern  provinces  and  is  also  helping  to \nstrengthen  PHC  planning  and  management  nationwide.13  The  Government  of  Japan  provides \nsubstantial support for HRD, child care and education, and infrastructure. External assistance to \nthe Lao health sector, after declining from 1998 to 2003, has improved with new support from \nthe World Bank for PHC development in the southern provinces, and Global Fund assistance for \nmalaria and tuberculosis (but not for HIV/AIDS). About 36% of donor assistance goes to CDC.14   \n \n46. \nOn an annualized basis, Viet Nam\u2019s health sector received $72 million in assistance in \n2003,  which  is  about  5%  of  total  development  assistance.15  By  program  area,  there  were  72 \ncommitments for communicable disease projects valued at $155 million at the end of 2003 (14% \nof  total  donor  commitment).  Of  CDC  support,  HIV/AIDS,  malaria,  and  tuberculosis  control \nreceived the greatest levels of assistance. External support is projected to increase from about \n$5  million  in  2001  to  about  $50  million  in  2006.  About  13%  of  donor  assistance  is  for  CDC. \nAppendix 4 gives a summary of external assistance coordination.   \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n9  ADB.  2001.

As regional projects are more complex than \nnational projects, there is a risk of following a vertical approach in planning regional projects that \nundermines national efforts for integration and decentralization, and may not be sustainable. On \nthe  other  hand,  regional  projects  supportive  of  national  programming  can  work  as  a  catalyst \nthrough  exchanging  ideas,  challenging  governments  and  creating  a  favorable  climate  for \nchange. Strong regional coordination and support as provided in the regional Community Action \nfor the Prevention of HIV/AIDS (footnote 9) has shown to be critical in achieving project impact.  \n \n48. \nThe CLV countries are slow to start up new projects. Several projects took more than a \nyear to get the implementation arrangements and consulting services in place.16 But after that \ninitial delay, the projects usually proceed well. The proposed project will therefore make use of \nexisting administrative capacity of ongoing projects (footnotes 12, 13, and 16).  \n \n49. \nThe  public  health  systems  in  CLV  countries  are  facing  serious  staff  and  budget \nconstraints, which in turn affect the capacity of Governments to implement and sustain projects. \nAny  project  activity  should  be  included  in  the  projections  for  health  sector  spending  in  the \ncoming years, and projects should undertake substantial capacity building at all levels.   \n     \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcomes \n\nThe  overall  anticipated  impact  of  the  GMS  Regional  CDC  Project  is  to  contain  the \n50. \nspread of epidemic diseases at local level and reduce the burden of common endemic diseases \nin  CLV  countries  by  about  15%  in  the  targeted  provinces,  and  more  for  certain  specific \ninfections. This will help these countries progress toward their health-related MDGs for 2015 of \nreducing the child mortality rate and containing the spread of HIV/AIDS and other infections.17 \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n51. \nThe expected project outcomes are (i) timely and adequate control of epidemics that are \nlikely  to  have  a  major  impact  on  public  health  and  the  economy  in  the  region;  (ii)  improved \ncoverage  of  prevention  and  care  of  communicable  diseases  in  vulnerable  populations,  in \nparticular poor women and children living in border areas; and (iii) improved know-how, policies, \nstandards, and coordination among countries to improve CDC, including for HIV/AIDS, through \nintergovernmental cooperation.  \n \n52. \nActivities  under  the  Project  are  pro-poor,  focusing  on  PHC  and  community-based \nactivities in priority provinces. Women and children will be the major beneficiaries of community \ninterventions.

In summary, the component outputs are:   \n \n\nComprehensive  national  surveillance  and  response  systems,  including  institutional \nstructures;  preparedness,  surveillance,  and  response;  laboratory  services;  and \nHRD\u2014in all three countries nationwide. \n\nExpanded and integrated CDC for vulnerable groups in 26 provinces (5 in Cambodia, \n6  in  Lao  PDR,  and  15  in  Viet  Nam).  Most  of  the  project  provinces  have  a  high \nproportion  of  vulnerable  groups  including  ethnic  minorities  and  a  high  burden  of \ncommunicable diseases, and are located along borders or transport corridors.  \n\nProductive  regional  coordination  for  CDC18  through  capacity  building  of  MOH, \nregional  policy  dialogue,  support  for  regional  institutions  in  operations  research  for \nHIV/AIDS  control  and  other  fields  in  support  of  this  dialogue,  and  project \nmanagement.   \n\n The Project will be implemented over a period of 4 years and will be adjusted yearly on \n\n \n54. \nthe basis of AOPs to be approved by the national steering committee (SC).   \n \n\n1. \n\nComponent 1: Strengthening National Surveillance and Response Systems \n\n55. \nComponent 1 is designed to support the development of national surveillance, response, \nand  preparedness  systems  for  communicable  diseases  in  the  CLV  countries,  with  a  particular \nfocus  on  preparedness  for  emerging  infectious  diseases  (e.g.,  AI,  SARS,  and  dengue)  and \nselected  endemic  diseases  such  as  cholera  and  typhoid.  The  activities  will  mainly  involve \nbuilding  capacity  so  that  the  countries  and  the  region  can  meet  their  obligations  related  to \nimplementing  \u201cEarly  Warning  of  Outbreaks  and  Response  Systems,\u201d  as  required  in  the  draft \nrevisions  of  the  IHR.  The  component  will  help  develop  and  implement  plans  for  detecting  and \nresponding to emerging infectious diseases, and specifically to the threat of pandemic influenza. \nIt  will  also  help  strengthen  surveillance  of  priority  diseases  not  covered  by  national  programs. \nThe four \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d are (i) institutional structures, partnerships, and policies; (ii) systems \nof  surveillance,  response,  and  preparedness;  (iii)  laboratory  services  and  facilities;  and \n(iv) HRD. \n \n56. \nThe first subcomponent, strengthening institutional structures, partnerships, and policies, \nwill help strengthen communication and collaboration across institutional structures in reviewing \nand  revising  policies  and  legislation  to  facilitate  surveillance  and  response,  and  in  developing \nlong-term  strategic  plans  for  controlling  communicable  diseases.  Models  and  mechanisms  will \nbe developed to strengthen partnerships within the health sector and with other sectors. Current \nlegislation  and  regulations  for  communicable  diseases  surveillance  and  response,  including \nthose  related  to  border  quarantine,  will  be  reviewed  and  developed  to  support  the \nimplementation of the revised IHR (once these are endorsed by the WHO Assembly). \n \n57. \nThe second subcomponent will help strengthen all elements and linkages in the systems \nof  surveillance,  response,  and  preparedness.  It  will  be  modeled  on  the  WHO  guidelines  for \n\n                                                 \n18  The People\u2019s Republic of China, Myanmar, and Thailand will be invited to participate in a regional dialogue. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13\n\nlaboratories \n\nthe  capacity  of  reference  and  provincial \n\nimplementing the IHR. To assess the feasibility of an integrated approach to the surveillance of \nnotifiable diseases, pilot studies will be conducted in 26 provinces and village health volunteers \nwill be trained in surveillance and reporting.19 Community education and mobilization programs \nwill  be  pilot-tested  in  selected  localities.  These  will  target  information  on  the  prevention  and \ncontrol  of  communicable  diseases,  and  specifically  on  bird  influenza  and  food  and  water \nhygiene.  Preparedness  plans  for  outbreak  response,  and  specifically  for  pandemic  influenza, \nwill be developed and tested in collaboration with the curative services, with local government \nand  relevant  non-health  sectors,  and  with  the  community.  In  Viet  Nam,  subcomponent  2  will \nalso support eight international quarantine stations and 13 provincial preventive medicine units \nthat  perform  quarantine  activities.  Furthermore,  a  series  of  three  regional  technical  forums  on \nsurveillance  and  response  systems  will  be  held  in  the  three  countries.  The  main  purpose  of \nthese  forums  is  to  coordinate  the  implementation  of  project  activities  under  the  component, \nissues,  and  exchange  experiences  and  knowledge  about  ways  of \ndiscuss  emerging \nstrengthening systems of surveillance, response, and preparedness. \n \nThe  third  subcomponent,  strengthening  laboratory  facilities  and  services,  will  help \n58. \nto  diagnose  priority \nstrengthen \ncommunicable  diseases,  and  enable  the  laboratories  to  participate  effectively  in  outbreak \nresponse. National systems of quality assurance and bio-safety (including collection, transport, \nand testing of specimens, and waste disposal) will be developed and implemented. Mechanisms \nwill also be developed to facilitate information sharing between laboratories across the country, \nand  between  laboratories  and  the  preventive  health  centers.  A  national  laboratory-based \nsurveillance system for selected pathogens will be developed. The ADB-funded Strengthening \nPreventive  Health  System  Support  Project20  in  Viet  Nam  will  support  the  development  of \nprovincial laboratories and, to a lesser extent, the four regional institutions. In collaboration with \nthis  other  project,  the  Project  will  identify  gaps  in  services  across  all  levels  and  support  their \nstrengthening. \n \nThe fourth subcomponent, HRD, will focus on in-service training. The first steps in this \n59. \nprocess  will  be  to  document  the  current  and  the  expected  future  roles  and  responsibilities  of \nstaff at the various levels of the surveillance and response system. The gaps thus identified in \ncurrent  roles  will  form  the  basis  for  customizing  the  training  programs  to  local  needs.  A \ncontinuing  education  program  (in-service  workshops,  outbreak  simulation  exercises,  and \nregional  fellowships)  will  be  developed  and  implemented  for  all  levels  of  the  health  workforce, \nincluding hospital and laboratory services. Middle and senior managers will attend international \ncourses  in  leadership,  information  management,  and  the  effective  use  of  national  data  for \nevidence-based  policy  development,  and  in  health  care  financing  and  resource  management. \nSupport will be provided to universities and other training institutions for medical professionals in \ndeveloping  and \nin  surveillance,  response,  and \npreparedness, and in implementing the revised IHR. In Viet Nam, a Field Epidemiology Training \nProgram  will  be  developed,  and  support  will  be  provided  for  master\u2019s-level  training  in  public \nhealth and epidemiology in the region and overseas. \n \n\nimplementing  undergraduate  curricula \n\n2. \n\nComponent 2: Improving CDC for Vulnerable Groups  \n\n60. \nThis component will reduce the burden of endemic infectious diseases in 26 provinces in \nthe  three  countries,  especially  their  border  provinces  with  large  vulnerable  populations.  The \ncomponent  will  address  preventable  endemic  communicable  diseases  that  now  receive \n                                                 \n19 See Map and Appendix 4 for characteristics of the selected provinces.  \n20 ADB. 2005. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to Viet \n\nNam for the Preventive Health System Support Project. Manila. \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\ninsufficient levels of investment and yet (may) cause significant levels of morbidity and mortality \nin poor population groups. Component 2 is divided into three subcomponents: (i) strengthening \nthe capacity for integrated CDC in 26 provinces with a major burden of communicable diseases \nand  large  vulnerable  groups;  (ii)  controlling  priority  endemic  diseases  in  priority  locations;  and \n(iii) improving the continuum of care for HIV/AIDS control in particular \u201chot spots,\u201d and regional \ncoordination  of  HIV/AIDS  control  in  high-risk  populations  related  to  road  access,  migrant \nmovements, and mobile populations.  \n \nThe  first  subcomponent  will  strengthen  the  capacity  to  mainstream  IMCI  and  integrate \n61. \nvarious disease control activities (e.g., HIV/AIDS in high-risk groups and endemic diseases) into \nprovincial health services in 26 provinces. CDC is dominated by selected vertical programs for \nmalaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS, and gives much less attention to IMCI for the major health \nproblems of children like acute respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases. The subcomponent \nhas  three  sets  of  outputs:  (i)  mainstreaming  CDC  in  provincial  planning  and  management; \n(ii) providing  management  tools  for  integrating  CDC  in  provincial  health  service  delivery;  and \n(iii) providing technical, supervision, and quality assurance support for implementation. Many of \nthe 26 provinces are mountainous, with isolated populations that rely on village health workers \nfor health care. The provinces will receive limited additional funds for training and supervision, \nCDC mainstreaming in their health systems, and IMCI expansion. This would help develop the \ncapacity of provinces to scale up CDC. The subcomponent will provide (i) technical assistance \n(TA) and financial support for planning, management, monitoring, and reporting activities; (ii) the \ndevelopment of guidelines and technical manuals and materials; (iii) study tours and experience \nsharing; and (iv) limited investment in equipment and supplies.  \n \nFor  the  second  subcomponent,  several  diseases  that  pose  a  heavy  burden  on  poor \n62. \ncommunities, many living in border areas, have been identified. While these diseases could be \neradicated or controlled with new medicines and other measures, funding has been lacking, as \nthese  are  considered  minor  problems  on  a  national  scale.  The  selection  of  diseases  for  the \ncomponent,  done  in  consultation  with  MOHs,  was  based  on  those  that  are  (or  could  become) \nmajor  contributors  to  ill  health  in  poor  populations  and  children  in  general,  lack  significant \nexternal  investments  for  control  or  elimination,  and  have  demonstrated  cost-effective  control \nstrategies  involving  communities.  Using  these  criteria,  the  Project  will  support  addressing \n(i) dengue/dengue  hemorrhagic  fever;  (ii)  diarrheal  diseases;  and  (iii)  worm  infections,  mainly \nhelminthes,  but  also  the  residual  problems  of  schistosomiasis,  trematode  infections,  and \nfilariasis.21  Behavioral  change  and  communication  campaigns  for  Japanese  encephalitis  will \nalso  be  supported.  Regional  forums  will  provide  opportunities  for  the  CLV  countries  to \ncoordinate implementation, discuss emerging issues and progress, and exchange experiences \nand knowledge about controlling these diseases. \n \n63. \nFor the third subcomponent, continuum of care for HIV/AIDS control will be implemented \nin particular \u201chot spots\u201d with high-risk populations and along major transport corridors. Selected \nprovinces will be the focus areas for HIV/AIDS activities under the Project. Activities will include  \nthose targeted for laborers and service women at construction sites, peer education programs, \ntesting and counseling, and treatment with antiretroviral drugs, similar to those in the successful \nADB project (footnote 9). Once again, a series of regional technical forums will be held during \nthe  Project \nthe \nsubcomponent will link to component 3, operations research for regional HIV/AIDS research and \nrelated activities.  \n \n\nto  discuss  progress  and  emerging \n\nin  HIV/AIDS.  Additionally, \n\nissues \n\n                                                 \n21 See Appendix 4 for the breakdown of disease interventions in the various provinces.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15\n\n3. \n\nComponent 3: Strengthening Regional Cooperation in CDC  \n\n64. \nThe common health sector challenges facing the CLV countries present opportunities for \nintensified  or  new  forms  of  regional  cooperation.  The  cross-border  nature  of  many  diseases \nnecessitates  standard  setting  and  joint  action.  Regional  cooperation  provides  opportunities  for \nlearning  what  works  and  what  does  not,  provides  greater  leverage  for  support,  and  helps \noptimize the allocation of resources and scale up efforts in key areas that can generate the most \nbenefits.  \n \n65. \nAn explicit component for regional cooperation in CDC is deemed necessary to provide \nthe leverage and policy focus that specific collaboration on surveillance and disease control may \nlack,  and  facilitate  cross-border  dialogue.  Hence,  the  main  purposes  of  this  component  are  to \nenhance  regional  cooperation  in  CDC  among  the  CLV  countries  and  create  sustainable \nfoundations for future cooperation. More specifically, the subsidiary objectives are: (i) increase \ncapacity  for  health  system  development  in  general  and  health  policy  and  legal  frameworks  in \nparticular  across  the  region;  (ii)  promote  learning,  research,  and  information  exchange  across \nthe  health  sectors  of  the  three  countries;  and  (iii)  promote  coordination  in  disease  prevention \nand control across borders. \n \n66. \nThree  subcomponents  have  been  designed:  (i)  regional  coordination  for  dialogue  on \nCDC, (ii) regional operations research and institutional linkages, and (iii) project management. \nThe  formulation  of  subcomponents  and  their  corresponding  activities  was  based  on  selected \ncriteria,  some  of  which  are  drawn  from  the  criteria  of  the  GMS  Working  Group  on  HRD  for \npriority projects. Regional activities should (i) be of national significance to each country and be \nbased on identifiable common interests and goals; (ii) create sustainable foundations (i.e., not \nbe a \u201cone-off\u201d activity);  (iii) provide  cross-country learning and sharing; (iv) have an impact on \ninequalities within and between the countries; and (v) provide better economies of scale where \napplicable.  Overall,  regional  cooperation  should  bring  added  value  to  national  health  systems \nand RPGs for health (see also Appendix 5).  \n \n67. \nIn  response  to  critical  needs  in  the  health  systems  of  the  CLV  countries,  the  first \nsubcomponent will promote regional coordination and peer dialogue among the CLV countries \nand other GMS countries. First, one or two regional SC meetings will be held each year during \nthe  Project  to  assess  project  implementation  and  progress,  coordinate  activities,  and  identify \nkey issues. The SC will also decide on joint studies. Second, technical forums will be held on \nthe  following:  (i)  specific  diseases  targeted  under  the  Project,  (ii)  CDC  financing  and  health \nsystems development, (iii) the targeting of vulnerable groups for health services, (iv) regulations \nand  standards  in  the  health  sector,  and  (v)  regional  surveillance  and  response  for  emerging \ndiseases  like  AI.  The  main  purpose  of  these  forums  is  to  strengthen  health  systems  by  (i) \ncarrying  out  dialogue  on  the  issues;  (ii)  exchanging  ideas  and  experiences  in  health  policies, \nlaws,  financing  options,  and  interventions;  and  (iii)  exploring  opportunities  to  coordinate  and \nharmonize policy and legal standards.  \n \n68. \nThe  second  subcomponent  focuses  on  regional  operations  research  for  HIV/AIDS  and \nthe development of linkages among institutions in the GMS for other types of joint research and \ndemand-based  initiatives.  The  Project  will  support  a  series  of  high-quality  research  studies  on \nparticular regional aspects of the HIV/AIDS\u2019s epidemiology in the three countries by building on \nthe extensive database (including baseline and final surveys, prevalence surveys, and records \nof  input/output  data)  generated  by  JFPR  9006  (footnote  9).  Key  topics  for  research  include: \n(i) emerging patterns of trafficking in women and the impact on HIV/AIDS, (ii) vulnerability and \nrisk  associated  with  transport  corridors,  (iii)  road  construction  and  other  major  infrastructure \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\ndevelopment, and (iv) mobility of labor (formal and informal) within and between countries. Also, \nthis subcomponent will promote institutional linkages among health and other institutions in the \nthree  countries  through  an  innovative  approach  to  joint  research  and  the  development  of \nsuccessful  interventions  that  are  based  on  geography  (as  opposed  to  formal  international \nboundaries)  in  cross-border  settings  or  pertain  to  all  three  countries  at  the  national  level. \nConsortia  of  institutions  (e.g.,  health  institutions,  health  departments,  women\u2019s  unions,  and \nothers) will be invited to develop project proposals and compete for research funds set aside for \nthe Project (a summary of the procedure is in Appendix 5). Priority projects for funding include \nfinancing  and  health  systems  development,  the  targeting  of  vulnerable  groups,  cross-border \nhealth  issues,  and  health  regulations  and  standards  (such  as  those  for  private  sector  health \nproviders).  \n \nThe  third  subcomponent  entails  overall  project  management.  The  regional  SC  for  the \n69. \nProject, based on the committee that oversaw the project preparatory TA for this project, will be \ncontinued.  A  regional  coordination  unit  (RCU)  will  be  set  up  in  Hanoi.  It  will  function  as  a \nsecretariat of the regional SC to assist the executing agencies in the CLV countries, coordinate \nthe TA, and provide administrative backstopping. The regional SC meetings will be organized by \nthe agency hosting a particular meeting and the RCU. Additionally, the RCU will be responsible \nfor the regional coordination of the TA, including liaison with stakeholders; data and document \ncollection;  support  for  international  consultants;  logistics  support;  and  organization  of  project \nworkshops  involving  all  three  countries.  This  subcomponent  will  also  include  any  required \nproject  monitoring  and  reporting  responsibilities  not  assigned  to  the  CLV  countries  in  their \nindividual agreements with ADB. \n \nOverall,  the  regional  coordination  and  dialogue  component  will  have  four  key  outputs, \n70. \nnamely: (i) greater capacity to strengthen health systems in the region, (ii) greater capacity for \n(and  use  of)  knowledge  sharing  and  institutional  linkages  across  the  CLV  countries, \n(iii) application  of  \u201cbetter  practices\u201d  and  successful  experiences  in  policies  and  interventions, \nand (iv) foundations for sustainable and broader health sector cooperation in the future. \n \n71. \nFinally,  for  Component  3,  it  is  worth  noting  that  ADB  is  now  preparing  a  strategic \napproach to regional cooperation in response to the rapid changes in the international system \nand  throughout  Asia-Pacific,  to  position  itself  both  to  support  existing  regional  cooperation \ninitiatives  and  to  be  prepared  to  facilitate  new  forms  of  regional  cooperation  that  will  promote \nregional  development.  ADB\u2019s  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department  is  leading \nthis initiative for an ADB-wide strategic approach to regional cooperation. The draft report (as of \nMarch  2004)  of  the  strategic  approach  paper  advocates  focusing  on  selected  priorities  and \nRPGs  that  cut  across  the  Asia-Pacific  region,  and  one  suggested  priority  area  is  HIV/AIDS. \nHence, the Project would complement the proposed strategic approach.  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n72. \nEvidently, the first special feature of the Project is the regional approach that it takes to \nCDC  and  health  systems  development.  Typically,  health  systems  improvement  and  CDC \nactivities are conducted in national and local settings. The Project involves regional or bilateral \ninitiatives  among  the  CLV  countries,  including  joint  disease  control  activities  and  forums  for \nexchanging lessons learned and reviewing needs and progress.  \n \nDuring  the  GMS  HRD  working  group,  all  six  countries  expressed  strong  support  for  a \n73. \nregional CDC project. However, they decided that the Project would focus on the CLV countries. \nIt  is  hoped  that  a  second  phase  will  include  other  GMS  countries  (PRC,  Myanmar,  and \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17\n\nThailand). The Project supports the participation of these countries as observers in the regional \nSCs and as participants in regional technical forums.  \n \n74. \nAnother feature of the Project is its emphasis on using regional cooperation for national \nhealth  systems  development.  Ultimately,  national  and  local  governments  are,  by  and  large, \nresponsible  for  ensuring  the  health  of  their  citizens,  and  need  to  develop  the  system  design, \nlegislation,  and  resources  to  make  this  happen.  While  health  policy  and  strategies  cut  across \nborders,  health  interventions  are  largely  a  national,  if  not  local,  responsibility.  Hence,  regional \ncollaboration  needs  to  strengthen  national  health  systems  to  be  relevant,  and  it  is  a  powerful \ntool  for  that  purpose,  through  such  means  as  creating  a  climate  of  constructive  learning  and \ncompetition among the countries. \n \nThe  Project  provides  important  policy  support for  national health  systems  development \n75. \nthat is in line with the current know-how on improving the effectiveness and efficiency of health \nsystems.  It  focuses  on  strengthening  the  provincial  health  services  using  sound  management \nprinciples, and on integrating CDC to improve coverage and efficiency.  \n \n76. \nRather  than  creating  a  new  regional  institution,  the  Project  aims  to  strengthen  and \ninstitutionalize regional coordination in MOHs and ensure that it is provided with its own budget, \nstaff, responsibilities, and authority. \n \n77. \nThe Project will strengthen regional initiatives. Some of these entail obligations deriving \nfrom  their  membership  in  global  and  regional  organizations,  such  as  WHO  and  the  ASEAN, \nwhile  others  are  national  initiatives  supported  by  a  variety  of  donors.  Specifically,  the  GMS \nGovernments  are  supporting  various  initiatives  in  regional  CDC  and  want  to  strengthen  their \ncollaboration.  They  are  working  toward  a  comprehensive,  sustainable  system  for  regional \ncollaboration  in  CDC  in  the  GMS  and  eventually  in  ASEAN.  Most  important  in  the  context  of \ncontrol  of  emerging  diseases  is  that  WHO  will  soon  require  its  members  to  attain  the  revised \nIHR. The Project will provide important capacity building for IHR. \n \n78. \nThe  Project  also  has  important  externalities  beyond  the  health  sector,  by  generating \npolitical  goodwill  and  cooperation  among  sectors.  This  will  further  reinforce  the  GMS  spirit  of \npeace, prosperity, and poverty reduction.      \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $38.75  million,  including  duties  and  taxes \n79. \n(Table 1). Of the total, $19.73 million, or 51%, is the foreign exchange cost and $19.02 million \nequivalent,  or  49%,  represents  the  local  currency  costs.  The  first  component  for  surveillance \nand  response  accounts  for  44%  of  project  expenditure,  the  second  component  for  disease \ncontrol  accounts  for  44%,  and  regional  cooperation  and  project  management  represent  12%. \nTable 2 shows the cost estimates by country.

Each  Executing  Agency  has  overall  responsibility  for  project  coordination  and \nimplementation in each country and will appoint a project director from among its senior officials. \nFor  regional  activities,  11%  of  the  total  project  costs,  financed  from  the  ADB  grant,  will  be \nmanaged regionally by ADB (para. 89).   \n \n \n \nIn Cambodia, the MOH has a policy of harmonizing and integrating projects into regular \n82. \nservices  and  not  creating  separate  project  management  units.  The  Project  will  therefore  be \nimplemented  through  HSSP  for  national  health  sector  development.  HSSP  will  serve  as  the \nproject  administrator  representing  the  Executing  Agency,  and  the  Communicable  Disease \nControl  Department  (CDCD)  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  (IA).  The  National  Center  for \nHIV/AIDS,  Dermatology,  and  Sexually  Transmitted  Diseases  Control;  the  National  Institute  of \nPublic  Health;  the  National  Center  for  Parasitology,  Entomology,  and  Malaria  Control;  and  5 \nprovinces will also serve as IAs. HSSP and CDCD, as the project implementation unit (PMU), \nwill sign an activity-based memorandum of understanding, according to the standard procedure \nfor projects under the HSSP umbrella. The health sector SC for HSSP will review progress and \nguide project implementation. The SC will be chaired by the MOH and will include the secretary \ngeneral  for  finance  of  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance,  two  secretaries  of  state  in  the \nMOH,  two  directors  general,  and  the  project  coordinator  of  the  HSSP.  Meetings  will  be  held \nevery 6 months. ADB will receive a copy of the minutes of the SC meeting regarding the Project. \nTechnical working groups for specific disease control activities, such as the national committee \nfor the control of AI, which brings together various ministries, will provide technical guidance.  \n \n83. \nThe director of the CDCD will be the CDC project director/manager, and this person will \nbe assisted by the directors of the other IAs, and a monitoring and evaluation officer. HSSP will \nbe  strengthened  with  one  accountant  and  one  procurement  officer  for  administrative  support. \nThe  project  director/manager  will  hold  monthly  project  meetings  to  review  implementation  and \nreports  and  agree  on  the  work  plan  for  the  next  month.  The  project  team  will  prepare  AOPs, \nwhich will be submitted to the SC for approval. At the provincial level, selected activities will be \nimplemented by a \u201cfocal group\u201d in the provincial health departments. For AI, Cambodia has an \ninterministerial  task  force  chaired  by  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Forestry  and  Fisheries,  and  a \ngovernment\u2013donor technical coordination committee to guide project activities.     \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n \n\nc. \n\nLao PDR \n\nViet Nam \n\nb. \n \n84. \nIn  the  Lao  PDR,  the  Project  will  be  administered  through  the  Department  of  Planning \nand  Budgeting  (DPB).  The  Department  of  Hygiene  and  Prevention  (DHP)  will  be  the \ncoordinating IA. The Center for HIV/AIDS/Sexually Transmitted Infections; the National Center \nfor  Laboratory  and  Epidemiology;  the  National  Center  of  Malariology,  Parasitology,  and \nEntomology; and six selected provinces will cooperate with the coordinating IA. The SC of the \nMOH  will  review  progress  and  guide  project  implementation.  The  SC  will  be  chaired  by  the \nMinister  of  Health  and  will  include  the  departmental  directors,  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  the \nMinistry  of  Foreign  Affairs,  and  the  Committee  for  Planning  and  Investment.  Meetings  will  be \nheld  at  least  every  three  months,  or  more  often  as  required.  ADB  will  receive  a  copy  of  the \nminutes of the SC meeting regarding the Project. Monthly technical meetings, to be arranged by \nDHP,  will  involve  the  participation  of  DHP,  DPB,  and  the  Lao  Resident  Mission.  DHP  will  be \nresponsible  for  preparing  a  quarterly  report  and  submitting  it  to  the  Executing  Agency  for \nclearance before sending it to ADB.  \n \nThe deputy director general of DHP will be the CDC project director, who will be assisted \n85. \nby  a  deputy  project  director  and  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  officer.  The  DPM  will  be \nstrengthened with at least one accountant and one procurement officer. At the provincial level, \nselected activities will be implemented by the provincial health offices. For emerging diseases, \nthe  Lao  PDR  has  established  task  forces  at  various  levels,  including  a  ministerial-level  task \nforce chaired by the MOH.  \n \n \n \n86. \nIn  Viet  Nam,  the  Viet  Nam  Administration  of  Preventive  Medicine  (VAPM)  will  be  the  \ncoordinating  IA.  A  PMU  will  be  set  up  in  the  VAPM.  The  National  Institute  of  Hygiene  and \nEpidemiology;  the  National  Institute  of  Malariology,  Parasitology  and  Entomology;  the  Pasteur \nInstitute in Ho Chi Minh City; the Viet Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Center; and 15 selected \nprovinces will also serve as IAs. The MOH SC for ADB-funded projects will review progress and \nguide  project  implementation.  It  will  be  chaired  by  the  vice-minister  of  health  for  preventive \nservices, and include members of VAPM; the Departments of Planning and Finance, Equipment \nand  Construction,  and  Science  and  Training;  the  Ministries  of  Finance  and  Planning  and \nInvestment; and the State Bank of Viet Nam. Meetings will be held every six months. ADB will \nbe  provided  with  a  copy  of  the  minutes  of  the  SC  meeting.  Viet  Nam  has  already  established \ntask forces at various levels for AI control, including a ministerial-level task force chaired by the \nMinistry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development.  For  HIV/AIDS,  the  project  will  coordinate  with \nthe national and provincial committees for HIV/AIDS control. \n \n87. \nThe  PMU  will  have  a  project  director,  a  deputy  project  director,  a  chief  accountant,  an \naccountant,  2  procurement  and  planning  officers,  and  2  monitoring,  evaluation,  and  reporting \nofficers.  The  project  director  will  hold  monthly  project  meetings  to  review  implementation  and \nreports and agree on the work plan for the next month. The IA will prepare AOPs, which will be \nsubmitted  to  the  SC  for  approval.  It  will  collaborate  with  other  ADB  PMUs  in  the  MOH  for  the \ncapacity building of its staff in ADB procedures, including those for administrative and financial \nmanagement.  At  the  provincial  level,  implementation  will  be  done  through  the  provincial \npreventive  medicine  centers.  These  centers  will  be  strengthened  with  staff,  including,  as  a \nminimum, an accounts officer.  \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n21\n\n \n\nd. \n\nRegional \n\n \n \n88. \nThe regional CDC SC established under the project preparatory TA will meet every six \nmonths, with the hosting rotated among the three countries. The regional CDC SC is advisory in \nnature.  It  will  give  guidance  in  project  implementation,  policy  dialogue,  and  the  building  of \nregional  capacity  and  cooperation  for  CDC,  and  will  facilitate  country  decisions  on  the  use  of \npooled funds for regional activities. It will be chaired by the minister or vice-minister of the host \ncountry and will consist of leading representatives from the national SCs, project directors, and \nADB  and  WHO  representatives.  The  RCU  will  act  as  the  secretariat  for  regional  coordination \nactivities and the management of regional funds, and will include a regional project coordinator, \nan accountant, a procurement officer, and a monitoring and evaluation officer.  \n  \nTo  facilitate  the  flow  of  funds  for  regional  activities,  $4.3  million,  or  11%  of  the  project \n89. \nfunds, will be administered by ADB as a regional CDC fund for regional collaboration, managed \nby  the  RCU.  This  fund  will  cover  expenditures  for  the  Project\u2019s  regional  SC,  technical  forums, \ninternational  consulting  services,  regional  studies,  cross-border  activities,  and  the  RCU  itself. \nADB\u2019s  administration  of  the  pooled  regional  funds  is  considered  necessary  for  the  efficient \nrelease of funds. The regional CDC fund will be financed from ADB\u2019s share of the grant, on the \nbasis  of  a  ratio  of  30:20:50  for  Cambodia,  Lao  PDR,  and  Viet  Nam,  respectively.  The \ncontribution to the RCU and regional activities will follow this ratio, subject to country approval, \nexcept  for  the  financing  of  studies,  which  will  be  decided  individually  by  the  countries  through \nthe committee. \n \n90.  WHO has been requested to engage and manage nine types of international consulting \nservices,  including  for  surveillance  and  response,  dengue,  and  endemic  diseases,  as  it  has \nspecial  expertise  in  this  area.  ADB  will  provide  $1.6  million  from  the  regional  CDC  fund\u2014\nrepresenting $0.48 million of its grant allocation for Cambodia, $0.32 million for Lao PDR, and \n0.80  million  for  Viet  Nam\u2014and  WHO  will  provide  $0.9  million,  for  a  total  of  $2.5  million.  This \narrangement  has  been  agreed  to  by  the  recipients  of  the  grant  and  is  reflected  in  the  grant \nagreements.  WHO  and  ADB  have  agreed  to  sign  a  project  implementation  agreement \nauthorizing  WHO  to  recruit  and  manage  international  experts  according  to  procedures \nacceptable to ADB and subject to the approval of candidates by ADB (see para. 93). The project \nimplementation  agreement  specifies,  among  others,  (i)  the  type  of  experts  to  be  provided  by \nWHO, (ii) the manner in which these experts will operate in close coordination with MOH, and \n(iii) implementation  arrangements  for  the  selection  of  experts,  reporting,  disbursement,  and \nperformance review.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n91. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  4  years,  starting  in  January  2006.  The  first  half-\nyear  activities  will  comprise  the  fielding  of  consultants  and  recruitment  of  staff;  review  of \nbaseline data for monitoring and evaluation; detailed project planning, which will include gender \nand ethnic minority dimensions; curriculum development; and workshops for key implementing \nagents. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 8. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n92. \nADB-financed  goods  and  services  will  be  procured  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement  and  the  relevant  laws  in  each  country.  However,  if  there  is  any  inconsistency \nbetween ADB\u2019s requirements and the national laws, ADB\u2019s requirements will prevail. Equipment \nwill  be  procured  through  (i)  international  competitive  bidding  for  contracts  worth  at  least  $1 \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\nmillion; (ii) international shopping for contracts worth at least $100,000 but less than $1 million \nfor the Governments of Cambodia and Lao PDR, and at least $350,000 but less than $1 million \nfor the Government of Viet Nam; and (iii) local competitive bidding or direct purchase for items \nvalued  at  less  than  $100,000  for  the  Governments  of  Cambodia  and  Lao  PDR,  and  less  than \n$350,000  for  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam.  Laboratory  testing  that  require  the  services  of  the \nPasteur Institute will be done through sole-source procurement. The procurement of equipment \nand  supplies  will  be  managed  by  each  MOH  as  the  EA,  which  may  delegate  this  task  to  the \nnational  institutions  and  provinces  for  items  valued  at  less  than  $20,000  in  Lao  PDR  and \nCambodia, and $50,000 in Viet Nam. The list of procurement packages is in Appendix 9.  \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n5. \n\nContracting Research and Training Institutions  \n\nThe  Project  provides  for  238  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and \n93. \n1,176  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services.  Of  the  international  consultants,  the \nregional  project  coordinator,  the  health  system  development  expert,  and  the  HIV/AIDS  chief \ntechnical  adviser  will  be  directly  engaged  by  ADB  as  individual  consultants  for  a  total  of  68 \nperson-months according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. International experts \nfor  surveillance  and  response,  outbreak  preparedness,  virology,  dengue  control,  control  of \nendemic  diseases,  legislation,  and  health  information  system  will  be  contracted  as  individual \nconsultants  for  a  total  of  170  person-months  by  WHO  as  implementing  agency  according  to \nWHO rules and regulations for administrative procedures and practices. ADB-funded experts to \nbe engaged by WHO must have the prior approval of ADB and MOH. Each MOH will engage \ndomestic consultants as individual consultants according to procedures acceptable to ADB. The \noutline terms of reference for consulting services is in Appendix 10.  \n \n \n \n94. \nRegional  research  institutions  will  be  contracted  to  study  regional  CDC  issues  and \nstrengthen  linkages  among  health  institutions  by  conducting  joint  research  and  programs  that \npertain  to  two  or  all  three  countries.  Projects  will  be  selected  following  a  competitive  process, \nwith  proposals  invited  from  consortia  of  institutions  according  to  a  set  of  clear  criteria  and \nguidelines  issued  as  part  of  the  study  selection  process  (see  Appendix  5).  Training  will  be \nimplemented by government institutions. A list of indicative training packages is in Appendix 11.  \n \n \n \nThe  Governments  will  apply  sound  accounting  and  auditing  standards  according  to \n95. \ninternationally accepted practices. Each MOH has adequate financial management capacity and \nhas  gained  familiarity  with  ADB  procedures  through  the  implementation  of  ADB  projects.  The \nproject  director  in  each  country  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring  proper  records  of  project \nreceipts and expenditures, including the management of sub-accounts. Auditing arrangements \nin the three countries will follow current arrangements with ADB. The Government of Cambodia \nhas currently contracted out auditing to a private accounting firm, but plans to do this through its \nown  audit  office.  In  the  Lao  PDR,  the  Government  will  do  the  auditing  according  to  current \narrangements  with  ADB.  For  Viet  Nam,  the  state  auditor  general  of  Viet  Nam  will  perform  all \nauditing  arrangements.  WHO  has  its  own  internationally  accepted  accounting  and  auditing \nstandards. Each IA and WHO will submit the auditors\u2019 reports, copies of the certified accounts \nand  related  financial  statements,  including  the  auditors\u2019  opinion  on  the  use  of  grant  proceeds, \ncompliance  with  grant  covenants,  and  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  statement  of \nexpenditure procedures, to ADB in English within 9 months after the close of each fiscal year.  \n \n\nAccounts and Audit \n\n6. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n23\n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n \n96. \nThe  project  management  units  and  the  RCU  will  formulate  AOPs,  complete  with \nexpenditure  estimates  for  each  year  of  implementation.  Annual  budgets  will  be  reviewed  and \napproved  by  each  country\u2019s  MOH  SC,  or  in  the  case  of  the  RCU,  by  the  regional  SC,  before \nimplementation, and updated after 6 months.  \n \n97. \nEach Government will, upon grant effectiveness, open and maintain an imprest account \nin a bank acceptable to ADB or in the treasury, and will also make counterpart funds available. \nThe initial amount to be deposited by ADB in the imprest account of each country will be based \non  the  estimated  expenditure  for  the  first  6  months  of  project  implementation  or  $900,000  for \nCambodia, $1,000,000 for the Lao PDR, and $2,500,000 for Viet Nam, whichever is lower. The \nimprest account will be established, managed, replenished, and liquidated according to ADB\u2019s \nLoan  Disbursement  Handbook  of  January  2001,  as  amended  from  time  to  time,  and  detailed \narrangements  agreed  upon  between  the  MOH  of  each  country  and  ADB.  The  statement  of \nexpenditure  procedures  will  be  used  for  reimbursing  eligible  expenditures  and  liquidating \nadvances  to  the  imprest  account  to  ensure  speedy  project  implementation.  The  ceiling  on  the \nstatement of expenditure per payment is $20,000 for Cambodia and Lao PDR, and $50,000 for \nViet Nam.  \n \nIn  Cambodia,  the  MOH  will  open  a  project  imprest  account  at  the  National  Bank  of \n98. \nCambodia, which will be managed by the HSSP administration of MOH. Project funds will flow \nfrom  ADB  through  HSSP  to  provincial  health  departments  using  second-generation  imprest \naccounts (SGIAs). In the Lao PDR, the Ministry of Finance will open a project imprest account \nat the Bank of Lao PDR, and DPB of MOH will open an SGIA to manage project funds for MOH \nat any bank. Funds will flow from ADB through the Ministry of Finance to the DPB. In Viet Nam, \nVAPM  of  MOH  will  open  an  imprest  account at  a  commercial  bank.  Funds  will  flow  from  ADB \nthrough the VAPM to national institutions and provinces using SGIAs. The initial amount to be \ndeposited into each of the SGIAs shall be equivalent to 6 months estimated expenditure, but in \nany  event  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $20,000  for  the  provincial  SGIAs  in  Cambodia, \n$250,000 for the DPB SGIA in the Lao PDR, and $50,000 for the national and provincial SGIAs \nin Viet Nam. All commercial banks used for SGIAs must be acceptable to ADB.   \n \n \n \n99. \nThe  CLV  Governments  will  submit  annual  and  semiannual  progress  reports,  and  if  so \nrequired by ADB will also quarterly reports. The Government of Cambodia will submit biannual \nreports based on the agreed format with the HSSP development partners. The project director \nwill  consolidate  the  reports  and  address  necessary  improvements  for  CDC  indicators  and  the \ninstitutional development aspects of the Project. The progress reports will have information on \nthe physical progress of activities, compliance with grant covenants, organizational and financial \nissues, gender and ethnic minority activities, the proposed program of activities, and expected \nprogress in the next plan period.  \n \n \n \n100.  ADB,  WHO,  and  the  Governments  will  carry  out  project  supervisory  missions  every  6 \nmonths. Before each visit, an updated progress report will be prepared. Reviewers will examine \nrecords  of  monitoring  and  evaluation  activities  and  meet  with  central  and  local  governments, \ncommunity  leaders,  and  project  beneficiaries.  Within  2  years  after  project  effectiveness,  the \nparties  will  undertake  a  comprehensive  midterm  review  to  (i) examine  the  scope,  design, \n\nProject Review \n\nReporting  \n\n8. \n\n9. \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\n10. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nimplementation  arrangements,  and  other  relevant  issues  in  light  of  the  Governments\u2019 \ndevelopment of CDC strategies and policies; (ii) assess the Project\u2019s progress and achievement \nof  the  objectives;  (iii)  identify  problems  and  constraints;  and  (iv) recommend  any  required \nmodifications, restructuring, and reallocations. \n \n \n \n101.  Data  collection  will  be  undertaken  to  monitor  progress  in  achieving  the  project \nobjectives. Specifically, the system will provide the Governments, ADB and WHO with the data \nand  indicators  to  monitor  project  inputs,  processes,  and  outputs  as  provided  in  the  project \nframework  and  in  key  performance  indicators  to  assess  the  technical,  social,  and  economic \nimpacts of the Project. The Project will conduct baseline and evaluation surveys, drawing upon \nexisting  data  wherever  possible,  and  collecting  new  field  data  only  where  necessary.  Annual \nreports will be submitted to ADB and WHO throughout project implementation; these reports will \ninclude  indicators  of  project  completion,  delivery,  and  benefits.  The  indicative  project  benefits \nand monitoring and evaluation arrangements are in Appendix 12.  \n \n \n \n102.  The Governments promote good governance, and executing and implementing agencies \nare informed about ADB anti-corruption policy, particularly the section on fraud and corruption, \nas stated in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  \n \n \n \n103.  Each  MOH  has  gained  substantial  experience  in  implementing  ADB-assisted  projects, \nand  has  staff  with  training  and  experience  in  ADB  procedures.  Frequent  transfer  of  project \ndirectors  is  not  an  issue  in  these  three  countries.  English  language  skills,  and  in  general \nfamiliarity  with  modern  administrative  and  financial  management  practices,  may  be  improved \nfurther. The Governments have given assurances that capable project staff will be appointed in \na  timely  manner.  The  Governments  support  the  decentralization  to  the  provinces,  including \ndelegation of financial authorities, for activities to be implemented by the provinces.  \n \n\nCapacity of Executing and Implementing Agencies \n\nGood Governance \n\n12. \n\n11. \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n104.  Project  Benefits  and  Beneficiaries.  The  Project  will  help  improve  the  health  of  the \ntargeted  population  and  thereby  increase  their  productivity,  and  help  progress  toward  the \nhealth-related  MDGs.  The  Project  will  improve  prevention  and  control  of  communicable \ndiseases,  intergovernmental  cooperation  in  containing  and  eliminating  diseases,  and  also \ncontribute to strengthening national health systems.  \n \n105.  Activities  under  the  Project  are  targeted  toward  the  poor  in  general  and  those  living  in \nremote locations including border areas, where many ethnic groups and the most poor reside. \nWomen and children will be the major beneficiaries of these community-level interventions.   \n \n106.  Analysis  of  Economic  and  Financial  Sustainability.  The  economic  benefits  of  the \nProject  will  come  from  (i)  helping  prevent  major  epidemics;  (ii) productivity  gains  from  an \nincreased lifespan and reduced mortality; (iii) productivity gains from improved achievements in \neducation, especially through less absenteeism and reduced dropout rates; and (iv) public and \nprivate savings in health expenditures, including indirect costs.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n25\n\n107.  The Project\u2019s recurrent costs include integrated service delivery staff costs, procurement \nof  medical  supplies,  and  ongoing  institutional  strengthening  costs,  which  together  will  account \nfor  about  $1.7  million in  2009,  the  year  of  projection completion.  It  is  envisaged  that  recurrent \ncosts  would  be  scaled  back  to  about  $1.1  million  in  2012  as  the  Project  demonstrates  the \nbenefits  of  using  items  like  worm  tables  and  larvicides  for  dengue  and  households  purchase \nsuch items. The summary economic and financial analysis is in Appendix 13. \n \n108.  Environment. The Project will not have any significant adverse environmental effects. In \ngeneral, it will finance preventive health services, which leave limited by-products, and will help \nsafeguard the environment by putting in place an early warning and response system. This will \nhelp  reduce  the  environmental  costs  of  disease  control,  in  particular  insecticide  spraying. \nProject supervision will closely monitor the issue of medical wastes. \n  \n109.  Social Analysis. The targeted provinces have a high proportion of families living below \nor  near  the  poverty  line  who  depend  on  subsistence  farming  for  their  survival,  in  particular \namong ethnic minorities. They depend heavily on the availability of a healthy labor force in the \nfamily.  Any  serious  disease  or  death  in  the  family  may  throw  the  family  into  even  deeper \npoverty,  malnutrition,  and  ill  health.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in \nAppendix 14.  \n \n110.  Gender. The Project is focusing on health problems of the poor, in particular women and \nchildren, and should not have any adverse social impacts for women and children. The Project \nwill  mainstream  women\u2019s  (including  ethnic  women)  specific  health  concerns  to  ensure  that \nhealth  services  take  into  account  their  cultural  and  biological  differences.  The  Project  also \nincludes  specific  interventions  benefiting  poor  children  most,  such  as  deworming  of  school \nchildren.  Prevention  of  disease  and  epidemics  will  generally  help  households  improve \nproductivity,  and  thereby  reduce  food  shortages.  A  gender  analysis  was  undertaken  during \nproject preparation to ensure that women receive adequate support from the Project (Appendix \n15).  Based  on  this  gender  analysis,  each  coordinating  IA  will  prepare  country-specific  gender \nplans for project implementation. \n \n111.  Ethnic  Minorities.  Ethnic  minorities  constitute  a  major  proportion  of  the  population  in \nthe three countries, and often reside in relatively remote hills and forests where living conditions \nare  difficult.  They  suffer  disproportionately  from  common  communicable  diseases  such  as \nmalaria,  diarrheal  diseases,  and  worm  infections,  and  also  have  less  access  to  health  care \nbecause  of  physical,  financial,  language,  and  cultural  barriers.  The  Project  is  specifically \ntargeting  ethnic  groups  in  the  selection  of  provinces,  types  of  interventions,  and  planning  and \nmonitoring arrangements. The ethnic minority development plan is in Appendix 16.   \n \n112.  Risks.  The  Project  has  some  technical  risks  in  the  effectiveness  of  control  measures. \nTechnical  risks  will  be  mitigated  by  partnering  with  WHO,  hiring  national  consultants  for  local \ncapacity  building,  and  strengthening  provincial  and  community  involvement.  Institutional \nnetworking and regional collaboration will also help in strengthening stakeholder involvement.  \n \n113.  Previous  ADB  projects  showed  project  management  to  be  critical  to  achieving  results. \nEach coordinating IA will have a project management unit, which will be supported by existing \nproject  administrative  capacity  in  MOH  in  areas  like  planning,  procurement,  financial \nmanagement, monitoring, and reporting.   \n \n114.  Regional  cooperation  requires  considerable  front-end  costs  with  low  immediate  returns \nbecause of an \u201cincubation period.\u201d However, these costs should be offset by substantial benefits \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\nfrom  regional  disease  control,  technology  transfer,  and  strengthened  national  commitment  for \nhealth  sector  development,  all  of  which  will  have  long-term  value  across  the  region.  ADB  will \nneed to provide substantial support for regional cooperation and ensure that this becomes fully \ninstitutionalized in terms of budget, staff, responsibility, and authority in the ministries. \n \n115.  The sustainability of new services after project completion is a key risk. In Lao PDR, the \nProject will increase the total public health budget by about 4.5% as public health spending is \ncurrently very low. The Government of the Lao PDR is planning a substantial increase in public \nhealth spending over 2006\u20132010. The fiscal situation is expected to have improved substantially \nby  the  time  of  project  completion.  The  Government  of  Viet  Nam  has  updated  Decrees \n73/1999/ND-CP  of  18  August  1999  and  10/2002/ND-CP  of  16  January  2002  to  ensure  the \nimplementation  of  Resolution  05/2005/NQ-CP  of  18  April  2005  to  improve  health  sector \nfinancing.  Each  Government  is  committed  to  sustaining  the  capacity  for  operating  the \nsurveillance and response and integrating CDC systems in the targeted provinces. Supplies of \nessential  drugs,  a  direct  pro-poor  intervention,  will  be  the  major  items  of  recurrent  costs.  The \nProject  will  help  the  Governments  plan  for  these  supplies,  and  will  also  encourage  self-\ntreatment where applicable and preventive health behavior to contain recurrent costs. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecial Assurances \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the CLV Governments and MOHs have given the \n\n116. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n117.  Annual Planning and Reporting. Each Government, through the MOH, will ensure that \nthe Project is implemented based on national AOPs approved by the national SC and submitted \nto ADB for concurrence no later than 31 January 2006 and in each year thereafter. The national \nAOPs  will  be  based  on  AOPs  submitted  by  all  IAs,  covering  all  project  activities  with  a \ncorresponding  budget.  Each  MOH  will  also  submit  annual  reports  and  semiannual  reports,  or \nquarterly reports if so required by ADB, including minutes of the national SC.   \n \n118.  Government  Financing.  Each  Government  will  ensure  that  all  necessary  counterpart \nfunds  for  project  implementation  are  provided  in  a  timely  manner  and,  to  such  end,  each \nGovernment will make timely submissions of annual budget appropriation requests and take all \nother measures necessary or appropriate for prompt disbursement of appropriate funds during \neach year of project implementation. \n \n119.  Operations  and  Maintenance.  Each  Government  shall  ensure  that  annually  adequate \nbudget  is  made  available  to  the  26  provinces  for  the  operations  and  maintenance  of  project \nactivities during and after the Project.      \n \n120.  Regional  Coordination.  Each  Government  will  fully  support  the  Project\u2019s  regional \nimplementation  arrangements,  this  being  a  regional  project,  including  the  regional  steering \ncommittee,  the  regional  CDC  fund,  the  regional  studies  and  forums,  and  the  engagement  of \ncertain international experts through WHO using project funds.  \n \n121.  Surveillance and Response. Each Government, through the MOH, will ensure that the \nsurveillance  and  response  activities  are  technically  sound,  efficient,  participatory,  sustainable, \nand in accordance with the IHR.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n27\n\nIntegrating  CDC.  Each  Government,  through  the  MOH,  will  ensure  that  the  provincial \n122. \nproject  activities  are  implemented  in  a  manner  that  supports  integrating  CDC  in  the  provincial \nhealth services. The MOH and provinces will submit to ADB implementation plans for integrated \nCDC in the provinces covered under the Project. The MOH will submit to ADB for approval by \n30  June  2006,  and  an  annual  update  on  changes,  if  any,  to  the  integrated  CDC  plans  by  31 \nJanuary of each year of the Project\u2019s duration.  \n \n123.  HIV/AIDS Control. Each Government, through the MOH, will ensure that the HIV/AIDS \nactivities  will  be  planned  in  consultation  with  their  respective  national  and  provincial  HIV/AIDS \ncontrol  SC  and  the  national  and  provincial  health  committees,  to  ensure  mainstreaming  of \nHIV/AIDS  control.  The  MOH  will  further  ensure  that  targeted  high-risk  groups  will  be  provided \ncontinuum of care.   \n \n124.  Ethnic  Minority  Development  Plan.  Each  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Ethnic \nMinority Development Plan will be prepared by MOH based on the general guidelines set forth \nin the agreed project Ethnic Minority Development Plan (Appendix 16), and will be implemented \nin  a  timely  manner  and  have  the  resources  to  increase  the  quality  of,  and  access  to,  health \nservices received by ethnic minorities.  \n \n125.  Gender Action Plan. Each Government will ensure that a national Gender Action Plan \nwill  be  prepared  by  MOH  based  on  the  general  guidelines  set  forth  in  the  regional  Gender \nAction Plan (Appendix 15). The gender action plans will be implemented in a timely manner and \nhave adequate resources allocated for both its preparation and implementation.  \n \n126.  Resettlement. Each Government will screen any proposed civil works and ensure that \ninvoluntary  resettlement  impacts  are  avoided.  If  involuntary  resettlement  is  unavoidable,  each \nGovernment  will  prepare  a  resettlement  plan  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement and submit it to ADB for approval prior to commencing land acquisition activities. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  resettlement  plan  will  include  detailed  measurement \nsurveys, compensation unit rates based on replacement cost surveys for all categories of losses \nand allowances and a final database of affected persons. \n \n127.  Environment.  Each  Government,  through  MOHs,  will  ensure  that  the  operation  of  all \nhealth facilities will comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the respective countries;  \nADB\u2019s environmental policies and regulations, specifically ADB\u2019s Environment Policy, 2002; the \nsummary initial environmental examination; and environmental management plan.  \n \n128.  Accounting  and  Audit.  Each  Government  will  apply  sound  accounting  standards \naccording  to  internationally  accepted  practices.  Each  Government  will  submit  annual  audited \nreports within 9 months of the last date of the previous project year.  \n \n129.  Project Sustainability. Each Government will ensure that sufficient funds are available \nto sustain project activities after project completion.  \n\n \n\nB. \n\nConditions for Grant Effectiveness \n\n130.  The following actions will be required prior to grant effectiveness; \n \n\n(i) \n\nEach  MOH  will  have  issued  clear  guidelines  for  implementing  the  Project, \nspecifying  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  EAs,  IAs,  and  other  agencies \nconcerned; and the arrangements for the Project\u2019s fund flow.  \n\n\f28 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n(iii) \n\nThe  PMUs  will  have  been  established  and  become  operational  in  a  manner \nsatisfactory to ADB.  \n\nAt  least  two  of  the  CLV  countries  will  have  duly  executed  and  delivered  their \ngrant agreements and all conditions for the effectiveness of the grants will have \nbeen fullfilled. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n131. \nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve a grant of $9 million to \nthe  Government  of  Cambodia,  $6  million  to  the  Government  of  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic \nRepublic,  and  $15  million  to  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion \nRegional  Communicable  Diseases  Control  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  with \nsuch  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft \nGrant Agreements presented to the Board.  \n \n\n \n \nHARUHIKO KURODA \nPresident \n \n\n \n \n28 October 2005 \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nDesign \nSummary \nImpact \nContain the spread of \nepidemic diseases at local \nlevel, and reduce the \nburden of common \nendemic diseases by \nabout 15% in the targeted \nprovinces, and more for \ncertain specific infections, \nin the CLV countries.

At \nmeetings of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), leaders have expressed concerns about the \nhealth  sector  and  identified  many  regional  threats,  as  well  as  opportunities,  that  would  greatly \nbenefit  from  regional  cooperation.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  accordingly  funded  a \nproject preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) for the GMS Regional Communicable Diseases \nControl (CDC) Project1 to analyze the health sector and identify regional health sector priorities \nin  three  countries\u2014Cambodia,  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR),  and  Viet \nNam. \n \n2. \nNewly  emerging  diseases  such  as  avian  influenza  and  severe  acute  respiratory \nsyndrome  (SARS)  pose  new  threats  to  the  region\u2019s  population  and  challenges  for  disease \ncontrol.  Although  these  diseases  have  not  caused  major  fatalities2  compared  to  malaria, \ntuberculosis,  acute  respiratory  infections  (ARI),  diarrheal  diseases,  and  other,  more  common \ninfectious  diseases,  the  evident  economic  impact  and  the  potential  for  a  regional  or  global \npandemic  are  making  avian  influenza  (and  previously  SARS)  high  priorities  among  national \nhealth  systems  and  international  health  institutions.  This  is  particularly  so  because  early \nrecognition  and  referral  at  the  community  level  is  required  to  avert  these  diseases  that  have \nhigh  case  fatality  and  potential  for  a  rapid  epidemic.  In  the  region,  community-based \nsurveillance, preparedness, and response are underdeveloped.  \n \n3. \nNonetheless, it is the ordinary endemic diseases like pneumonia and diarrheal diseases \nthat  exact  a  heavy  toll  on  the  population,  in  particular  children.  In  Cambodia  and  Lao  PDR, \ncommunicable diseases are the most common causes of morbidity and mortality. According to \nmost  recent  statistics  of  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO),  ARI,  diarrheal  diseases,  and \nmalaria are  the most common causes of morbidity in Cambodia, while malaria, ARI, and road \naccidents cause the most deaths. HIV/AIDS3 is not in the top five, but may be masked by ARI, \ntuberculosis,  or  even  road  accidents.  In  Lao  PDR,  malaria,  pneumonia,  and  gastrointestinal \nproblems  cause  the  most  morbidity  and  mortality.  In  Viet  Nam,  which  has  better  health \nindicators overall, pneumonia, acute pharyngitis, and ARI are the common causes of morbidity, \nwhile  intracranial  injury,  road  transport  accidents,  and  pneumonia  are  common  causes  of \nmortality.4 \n \n4. \nPerhaps  because  they  are  relatively  easy  to  prevent  and  treat  with  low-cost \ninterventions,  common  infections  receive  less  priority  than  diseases  such  as  HIV/AIDS  and \navian  flu.5  There  is  a  potential  danger  that,  as  with  the  polio  eradication  campaign,  new \ndiseases will absorb a considerable level of commitment, staff time, and funding at the cost of \naddressing common illnesses. As Table A3.1 shows, coverage indicators for routine preventive \nand  curative  services  are  still  low.  Surveys  also  confirm  that  the  poor  and  ethnic  minorities \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.

Both  public  and  private  sector  healthcare  provision  decreases  as  population \ndensity  falls.  Despite  the  advances  over  the  past  decade  in  building  more  roads  across  GMS \nborders, many of the more remote communities are still beyond the reach of conventional health \nservices. They are increasingly being reached through community health workers, village health \nvolunteers, and drug shops, not institutional services.   \n\n \n\n \n\nTable A3.1: Coverage of Health Services \n\nYear \n2003 \n\nCambodia \n% \n65 \n\n \nIndicator \nMeasles vaccination coverage \nin children 12\u201323 years of age \nSecond tetanus vaccination for \npregnant women  \nUse of modern contraceptives \namong married couples \nAccess to safe water \nAccess to sanitation \nAccess to essential drugs  \nLao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \nSources: ADB Country Program Reports; and www.unicefusa.org. \n\n2000 \n2000 \n2003 \n\n30 \n21 \n50 \n\n2003 \n\n2003 \n\n43 \n\n19 \n\n% \n42 \n\n36 \n\n29 \n\n50 \n51 \n80 \n\nLao PDR \n\nViet Nam \n\nYear \n2003 \n\n2003 \n\n2003 \n\n2002\u20132003 \n2002\u20132003 \n2004 \n\n% \n93 \n\n79 \n\n56 \n\n56 \n73 \n85 \n\nYear \n2003 \n\n2003 \n\n2003 \n\n2002 \n2000 \n2004 \n\nCommunicable Diseases Control \n\n \n6. \nEven  where  sufficient  coverage  is  achieved,  it  does  not  imply  that  good  quality  care  is \navailable. In fact, given human resource, financial, and supply constraints, and the general lack \nof  consumer  education  on  what  constitutes  good  health  care,  the  effectiveness  of  these \ninterventions is less than would be assumed. The rise of the private sector, while greatly helping \nto  improve  coverage,  further  raises  the  risk  of  reduced  quality  of  care,  over-prescription  with \npossibly  medical  consequences,  and  income  erosion.  Furthermore,  there  are  also  no  reliable \ndata on the quality of health services, public or private, so the situation is difficult to track.  \n \n7. \nCompared with typical health sector problems of management and resources, the issues \nin  CDC  are  somewhat  different  and  have  to  do  with  the  way  CDC  is  fragmented  and  donor-\ndriven, with limited accountability and authority at the local level.  \n \nB. \n \n8. \nIn  the  late  1980s,  WHO  and  partners  introduced  the  concepts  of  \u201cprimary  health  care \n(PHC)\u201d  and  the  \u201cdistrict  health  system\u201d  toward  health  for  all.  These  concepts  are  still  highly \nrelevant and form the central pillars of country health policies today. However, support for PHC, \nfor  a  variety  of  reasons,  was  increasingly  replaced  by  a  more  selective  approach  focusing  on \ndiseases or subsectors. CDC was increasingly organized through vertical programs for quicker \nimpact. The programs included the expanded program of immunization, the tuberculosis control \nprogram,  the  malaria  control  program,  and  the  HIV/AIDS  control  program.  There  were  also \nprominent programs for child survival, focusing on ARI and diarrheal diseases control, followed \nby  the  introduction  of  tools  for  the  Integrated  Management  of  Childhood  Illnesses  (IMCI),  and \nagain, recently, a new regional strategy for child survival.   \n \n9. \nThe  organizational  structures  of  the  health  systems  in  the  three  countries  present  a \nmajor  institutional  divide  between  curative  and  preventive  services,  from  central  to  provincial \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n35\n\n \n\n1. \n\nCDC in Cambodia \n\nand  down  to  the  district  level.  This  may  have  helped  to  provide  focus  on  preventive  health \nservices at first. Yet, it did not solve the funding resource constraints of preventive services and \nthe less economically attractive human resource constraints. It also resulted in higher delivery \ncosts, as different providers were used for specific but basic interventions. The same holds true \nfor  laboratory  services,  training,  and  supplies.  Heavily  funded  programs  such  as  polio \neradication also undermined regular services.  \n \n10. \nNowadays,  vertical  programs  are  increasingly  being  integrated  with  provincial  health \nservices.  Interestingly,  this  trend  emerged  in  part  from  the  managers  of  vertical  programs \nthemselves, who realized that it was very difficult to improve coverage without pooling resources \nat the local level and allowing for decentralized management. The three countries have initiated \nseveral initiatives in this respect. \n \n \n \n 11. \nThe  institutional  setup  in  the  three  countries  is  broadly  similar.  In  Cambodia,  the  CDC \nDepartment  has  overall  responsibility  for  surveillance,  response,  and  preparedness  through \nthree  bureaus:  (i)  Bureau  of  CDC  and  Prevention,  (ii)  Bureau  of  Disease  Surveillance,  and \n(iii) Bureau  of  Quarantine.  In  addition,  there  are  national  programs  for  HIV/AIDS,  tuberculosis, \nand  leprosy,  and  for  malaria,  dengue,  and  schistosomiasis.  The  national  programs  are \nindividually responsible for surveillance and control activities for these diseases. The Maternal \nand Child Health Unit is responsible for surveillance and control of cholera and other diarrheal \ndiseases, ARI, and vaccine-preventable diseases (of the National Immunization Program). This \nstructure  presents  challenges  for  institutional  coordination  of  activities,  including  surveillance \nand response.  \n \n12. \nThe  24  provincial  health  departments  support  67  operational  districts  in  implementing \nthe  National  Health  Policy  and  ensure  equitable  distribution  of  resources.  The  provinces  and \ndistricts do not have dedicated staff for surveillance and response activities. These functions are \nusually allocated to staff in the national programs and the maternal and child health programs. \nThere are three to five staff members working on the national programs at the provincial level \nand  three  to  four  staff members  at  the  operational  district level.  The Ministry  of  Health  (MOH) \nhas  created  village  health  groups  to  promote  health  in  the  villages.  However,  compared  with \nother  countries,  Cambodia  provides  modest  village  health  care  at  best.  Community \norganizations are small. There is substantial reliance on the private sector, but it is not part of \nthe reporting system.  \n \n13. \nThe  Government  has  successfully  launched  an  integrated  initiative  called  the  Health \nSector  Support  Plan  (HSSP)  for  2003\u20132007,  which  provides  the  basis  for  sector-wide \nmanagement  and  an  umbrella  framework  for  health  activities  under  the  National  Poverty \nReduction Scheme. The Department of Planning and Health Information has developed the first \nAnnual Operational Plan for 2005. The Annual Operational Plan integrates the implementation \nof  HSSP  strategies  by  the  various  health  institutions  in  Cambodia,  within  the  Medium-Term \nExpenditure  Framework.6  MOH  delineated  12  priority  activities  for  the  health  sector,  including \npromoting village health support groups and health center management committees, improving \nIMCI, improving consumer confidence in health services, and improving ethical conduct.  \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n6  Ministry of Health, Government of Cambodia. 2005.

MOH has 10 affiliated centers, among them the National \nInstitute  of  Public  Health;  National  Center  of  Malarialogy,  Parasitology  and  Entomology; \nNational  Center \nfor  HIV/AIDS/Sexually \nTransmitted Infections. The Government has delegated strategic planning to the 18 provinces, \nand  operational  management  to  the  districts.  The  provincial  health  offices  have  administrative \nand  technical  responsibilities  for  public  health  services  within  their  provinces,  including \nmanaging  units  for  hygiene  and  prevention,  malaria,  and  expanded  program  of  immunization. \nEach  district  health  office,  with  four  to  five  healthcare  workers,  is  responsible  for  coordinating \nhealth  services  in  its  district.  CDC  is  promoted  through  health  centers,  health  committees, \nvillage health volunteers, and mass organizations (e.g., women and youth unions).  \n \n15. \nThe  health  sector  is  one  of  four  priority  sectors  in  the  \u201cNational  Growth  and  Poverty \nEradication  Strategy.\u201d  The  \u201cHealth  Sector  Strategy  to  the  Year  2020\u201d  is  one  of  the  key  policy \ndocuments7 and is based on four overriding concepts related to healthcare: (i) full coverage and \nservice  equity,  (ii)  early  integrated  services,  (iii)  demand-based  services,  and  (iv)  self-reliant \nservices. On the basis of these concepts, the Health Sector Strategy identifies six policy areas, \nincluding  improving  community-based  health  promotion  and  disease  prevention,  and  ensuring \nthe quality, safety, and rational use of food and drugs.  \n \n16. \nThe system is not performing well, as can be seen from the low immunization rates and \nother  shortcomings.  In  particular  for  remote  areas,  CDC  programs  must  be  integrated  to  be \neffective. While much capacity building has been achieved in the past decade, the capacities of \nall levels are still seriously constrained. One issue is staff skills. Another is low pay, combined \nwith  limited  opportunities  for  income-generating  activities  in  rural  areas  except  farming.  The \nGovernment  is  also  facing  serious  fiscal  constraints.  Hence,  the  number  of  health  workers \ncannot be expected to increase significantly in the medium term, although the Government has \nexpanded training for ethnic minority students. The private sector offers other challenges, such \nas the sale of imported counterfeit malaria drugs, which may be a major cause of death in Lao \nPDR. \n  \n\n3. \n\nCDC in Viet Nam \n\n \n17. \nAmong the 14 departments of MOH, the Viet Nam Administration of Preventive Medicine  \n(VAPM)  leads  the  preventive  subsector,  while  Drug  Administration,  Food  Safety  and  Hygiene, \nthe Center of Health Education, and others also play significant roles. VAPM is responsible for \nthe  overall management  and  supervision  of  communicable  disease  surveillance  activities.  The \npreventive  health  system  includes  services  delivered  by  preventive  institutions  (12  preventive \nmedicine  institutes  and  2  centers)  and  specific  health  programs.  A  network  of  preventive \ninstitutions covers all levels from the central level down to district level. This fragmentation has \nhigh transaction costs and makes planning difficult. However,  this structure is firmly entrenched \nand    integration  will  be  difficult.  The  Government  is  considering  setting  up  a  separate \nDepartment of HIV/AIDS Control. Given the multi-sectoral perspective of HIV/AIDS and the size \nof the program, this move may be justifiable. However, there is a risk in taking HIV/AIDS out of \nprovincial programs.   \n \nPHDs  develop  annual  plans  for  health  services  and  programs  and  are  responsible  for \n18. \nmanaging  and  directing  health  care  at  the  provincial  level.  They  manage  the  provincial \n                                                 \n7 Formulated in May 2000. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n37\n\n \n\npreventive  medicine  centers  and  other  facilities.  The  preventive  medicine  centers  provide \npreventive  health  services,  including  surveillance  for  the  24  notifiable  diseases.  They  are  also \nresponsible for laboratory services. An epidemiological team monitors diseases and responds to \noutbreaks.  The  district  health  centers  manage  and  direct  health  care  at  the  district  level.  The \ndistrict preventive health teams provide services such as immunization and control of diarrheal \ndiseases, malaria, vitamin A deficiency, and iodine deficiency disorders. The district preventive \nteams  consist  of  five  to  seven  technical  staff  members.  VAPM  plans  to  establish  separate \ndistrict preventive centers.  \n \n19. \nThe  commune  health  center  is  the  lowest  level  healthcare  facility  of  the  public  health \nsystem.  It  is  responsible  for  the  primary  level  of  care  in  the  community,  including  preventive \ncare,  normal  delivery,  drug  provision,  family  planning,  and  other  PHC  activities.  Viet Nam  has \nmore than 10,500 commune health centers, but many of them do not have medical doctors and \ninstead are staffed with assistant doctors and nurses. Village health workers are an integral part \nof the health system in implementing PHC in the community, facilitating outreach programs, and \nconducting  environmental  health  efforts.  The  current  network  of  village  health  workers  covers \n80% of the villages. While the system is well established and can serve as a model, it needs to \nbe  more  locally  driven  rather  than  simply  responding  to  instructions  from  above,  and  it  needs \nmore tools and support.  \n \nThe  National  Strategy  for  People\u2019s  Health  Care  and  Protection  2001\u20132010  sets  forth \n20. \nmore  specific  health  targets  and  strategies.  This  medium-term  strategy  explicitly  calls  for \n(i) reducing  morbidity  and  mortality  caused  by  malaria,  dengue  fever,  hepatitis,  and  Japanese \nencephalitis;  (ii)  curbing  the  increase  of  HIV/AIDS;  (iii)  preventing  and  controlling  non-\ncommunicable diseases; (iv) improving equity of access to and use of health services; and (v) \nenhancing  the  quality  of  health  care.  Specifically  for  the  preventive  health  system,  Viet  Nam \nprepared  in  2004  the  \u201cMaster  Plan  on  Development  of  the  Preventive  Health  Network  in  Viet \nNam  by  2010  and  Vision  by  2020.\u201d  The  specific  objectives  of  the  plan  include,  among  others, \nstrengthening  the  capacity  of  preventive  medicine  at  the  district  level  to  implement  epidemic \nprevention activities in the communities.  \n \nC. \n\nReasons for Regional Cooperation in CDC \n\n21. \nCommunicable diseases do not stop at borders. HIV/AIDS, the SARS crisis in 2003, and \nmore recent concerns about avian flu have highlighted the importance of regional cooperation in \nCDC.  Countries  are  responding  to  their  own  limitations  and  vulnerabilities  to  the  spread  of \ninfections from outside their borders by working more closely together. The rapid identification of \na  disease  outbreak  and  a  coordinated  regional  response  will  significantly  contain  the  adverse \nhealth  and  economic  effects  on  populations.  Programs  for  the  prevention  and  control  of \ncommunicable disease outbreaks are, therefore, regional public goods (RPGs), and not merely \nnational public goods. \n \n22. \nCommon health sector challenges facing Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam give rise to \nopportunities (and demand) for new forms of regional cooperation. The cross-border nature of \nmany diseases, the need for more efficient allocation of limited resources through economies of \nscale, and the necessity for joint actions to prevent or contain disease outbreaks are among the \nbroad reasons for greater regional cooperation among countries in health matters. \n \nFor example, people in border areas nowadays cross borders frequently to work, sell or \n23. \nbuy goods, engage in road or other infrastructure development, and use the new infrastructure, \nthus  facilitating  the  spread  of  communicable  diseases  and  making  it  difficult  to  treat  infected \n\n\f38 \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\npeople. New markets along roads and borders also increase the exposure of previously isolated \ncommunities  to  communicable  diseases.  Containment  of  infected  people  is  complicated  by \nlimited  access  to  treatment  in  an  area.  Common  vectors  and  environments  in  border  districts \nmay  lead  to  transmission.  The  focus  of  disease  control,  therefore,  needs  to  be  geographic \nrather than being based on formal boundaries. The health officials of a country must operate in \nunaccustomed  ways.  Perhaps  most  importantly,  countries  can  learn  from  one  another  what \nworks in matters ranging from the health education needs of ethnic minorities to health sector \nfinancing. Common standards will make it easier for countries to coordinate and exchange staff, \ninformation, services, and goods. Differences in health policies, such as the cost of treatment, \nand  in  the  quality  of  service  may  push  residents  of  border  areas  to  seek  treatment  in  a \nneighboring  country.  And  finally,  working  together  will  provide  important  leverage  and \neconomies of scale.  \n \nD. \n\nNew International Health Regulations \n\n24. \nEmerging  infections such  as  SARS,  Nipah  virus  infections, Japanese  encephalitis, and \nhuman  cases  of  avian  influenza,  and  epidemic  diseases  such  as  meningitis,  cholera,  typhoid \nfever, and dysentery pose a growing threat to the health of the world\u2019s populations. Their early \nrecognition  is  often  difficult  and  their  containment  challenging.  Responding  appropriately  to \nthese  infectious  threats  requires  better  structures,  coordination  among  health  systems,  and \nworkforce development to strengthen disease control. \n \n25. \nTo strengthen national and global health security, epidemics must be contained at their \nsource  and  their  potential  to  spread  in  the  local  and  international  communities  must  be \nminimized. Countries need to increase their capacity for rapid detection and timely response to \npublic health emergencies. They also need to enhance coordination and cooperation with one \nanother in tackling cross-border diseases.  \n \nThe  recently  revised  Internal  Health  Regulations  (IHR)  provide  the  legal  framework  for \n26. \nactions  to  prevent  the  international  spread  of  disease.  Countries  will  be  expected  to  establish \nand maintain minimum core surveillance and response capacities to successfully implement the \nglobal  health  security,  epidemic  alert,  and  response  strategy.  These  requirements  entail  (i)  at \nthe  community  level,  detecting  illnesses  and  deaths  above  expected  levels  and  reporting \ninformation to appropriate local health personnel; (ii) at the primary public health response level, \nverifying reported events, implementing immediate control measures, and reporting information \nto the national level; and (iii) at the national level, assessing all health event reports within 24 \nhours  and  reporting  public  health  emergencies  of  international  concern  to  WHO.  The  revised \nIHR  provide  a  decision  instrument  to  assist  countries  in  assessing  events  and  immediately \nnotifying  WHO  about  events  that  could  signify  a  \u201cpublic  health  emergency  of  international \nconcern.\u201d The latter phrase is fully defined in the draft IHR. \n \n27.  WHO guidelines (available in draft form since February 2004) provide countries with the \ndetailed  technical  information  and  understanding  needed  to  establish  functions  that  will  meet \ntheir capacity requirements. The revised IHR were endorsed by the World Health Assembly in \nMay 2005, with a proposed implementation date in 2006. WHO will support countries in building \nthe technical capacity to comply with the revised IHR. \n \nE. \n \n28. \nTable A3.2 presents a brief summary of regional CDC initiatives in the GMS countries. \nADB,  for  the  past  13  years,  has  supported  the  GMS  Program  including  the  health  sector, \n\nCurrent Regional Cooperation Initiatives in CDC \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n39\n\n \n\nnotably through the Phnom Penh Plan for leadership training, JFPR 9006: Community Action for \nHIV/AIDS Prevention8, malaria control, and other initiatives. \n \n\nTable A3.2: Selected Current Regional Collaboration Arrangements  \nin the Mekong Region \n \n\nRegional Agency \nADB \n\nWHO/WPRO \n(in GMS, includes \nCambodia, PRC, Lao PDR, \nViet Nam) \n\nWHO/SEARO \n(in  GMS,  includes  Myanmar \nand Thailand) \nRed Cross/Red Crescent \nSocieties (regional office in \nBangkok; offices in 11 \nSoutheast Asian countries)  \nASEAN+3 Emerging \nInfectious Diseases \nProgram \n(focuses on emerging \ndiseases) \nSEA Nations Infectious \nDiseases Outbreak \nSurveillance Network \n(sponsored by Indonesia \nand the ASEAN Secretariat; \ninitially developed by the \nNAMRU-2).  \nMBDS Project (sponsored \nby the Rockefeller \nFoundation, since 1998; \ninvolves Cambodia, PRC, \nLao PDR, Myanmar, \nThailand, and Viet Nam) \n\nAsian Collaborative Training \nNetwork for Malaria (ACT \nMalaria) \n\nCambodia, Lao PDR, and \nViet Nam Development \nTriangle (proposed since \n1999) \n\nOther collaborative \ninitiatives among the CLV \ncountries \n\nPriorities/Functions \nRegional functions are to mobilize resources to finance regional cooperation, facilitate \ndialogue  and  participation,  and  provide  information  to  member  countries.

The ministers of health signed an MOU in \n2001  to  facilitate  communications  and  strengthen  overall  cooperation  on  CDC.  The \nfirst phase (2001\u20132003) built trust among partners, a model for regional collaboration, \nthe  MBDSnet.org  Web  site,  and  guidelines  on  outbreak  investigations.  The  current \nproject for CDC covers border crossings. \nEstablished in 1999 with the signing of an MOU, ACT Malaria now has 11 members\u2014\nBangladesh, Cambodia, PRC, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, \nSingapore,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam\u2014and  focuses  on  human  resource  development \nfor malaria control. \nIn  2002,  the  plan  was  to  cover  seven  provinces:  Ratanakiri  and  Strung  Treng  in \nCambodia, Attapeu and Sekong in the Lao PDR, and Kon Tum, Dac Lac, and Gia Lai \nin Viet Nam. However, in June 2004 a proposal to expand the coverage was made, \nand the three prime ministers announced that the Development Triangle would focus \non transport networks, electricity, trade, tourism, human resource training, and health \ncare.  \nThe governments in the region have signed various bilateral agreements and MOUs \non training, research, CDC, information exchange, quarantine, use of health services \nacross borders, blood safety, and counterfeit drugs.  \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB.  2001.

A third gap is research with a regional perspective. Studies on mobility across borders \nand infrastructure development and on the crucial factors in the transmission of diseases across \nborders are particularly important for HIV/AIDS. \n \nF. \n\nChallenges in Regional Cooperation \n\nCooperation in the health sector among the CLV countries is still in a nascent stage of \n30. \ndevelopment.  The  memoranda  of  understanding  for  health  sector  cooperation  are  relatively \nrecent,  and  the  agreed-upon  frameworks  have  in  most  instances  not  been  followed  up  with \nsufficient action or details about how the frameworks should be implemented. One of the critical \nsuccess  factors  in  new  formal  cooperation  arrangements  is  the  prior  existence  of  informal \nnetworks  across  the  participating  countries.  The  absence  of  such  networks  typically  causes  a \nlag  between  when  the  cooperative  framework  is  established  and  when  it  is  acted  on  and  the \nbenefits  are  manifested,  because  the  necessary  linkages  must  first  be  developed  between \ninstitutions.  This  is  clearly  true  of  the  health  ministries,  laboratories,  and  institutes  in  the  CLV \ncountries. The networks are not in place because of limited opportunities for interfacing at the \ntechnical level. Therefore, high-level political agreements to cooperate in the health sector are \nunlikely  to  bear  much  fruit  until  networks  and  linkages  develop  among  the  technical  health \nspecialists. \n \n31. \nRPGs receive less attention than global and national public goods. In particular, rates of \nreturn on regional investments are often higher than individual country investments and reduce \nthe  costs  for  smaller  economies.  Global  initiatives  prevail  over  regional  ones  despite  the \ncomplexities involved in implementing them worldwide, and they tend to lose focus on the \u201cweak \nlinks\u201d  (i.e.,  countries  with  limited  capacities)  that  make  global  health  initiatives  less  effective. \nClear  gaps  in  health  RPGs  exist  within  ASEAN  and  the  GMS  countries.  There  is  no \ncomprehensive  regional  health  information  system,  and  research  with  a  regional  perspective \n(e.g., on migrants and HIV/AIDS) is lacking. Another challenge to the provision of RPGs is the \nlack  of  coordination  among  external  agencies.  The  purpose  of  the  regional  strategy  is  to \ndevelop  a  comprehensive  framework  to  give  people  in  the  Asia-Pacific  better  protection  from \nemerging  diseases.  The  focus  will  be  on  preventing,  detecting,  and  controlling  the  emerging \ndiseases  that  are  posing  new  threats  and  challenges  to  the  people  and  health  systems  in  the \nregion. \n \nThe  current  setting  favors  regional  collaboration  in  CDC.  The  recent  epidemics  have \n32. \ncreated more political will to exchange information, harmonize quality standards, and learn key \nlessons  from  one  another.  Moreover,  progress  in  ASEAN  and  GMS  has  created  a  strong \ninstitutional  framework  for  regional  collaboration.  A  third  factor  is  WHO\u2019s  revised  IHR.  GMS \ncooperation  in  the  health  sector  should  focus  on  building  up  the  foundation  for  more  effective \n\n                                                 \n9  The  WHO  Regional  Office  for  the  Western  Pacific  and  the  Southeast  Asia  Regional  Office  of  the  World  Health \n\nOrganization are now preparing an Asia-Pacific strategy for emerging diseases. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n41\n\n \n\nand  sustainable  collaboration.  This  will  require  building  trust  and  confidence  through  more \nfrequent  and  focused  dialogue  and  exchange;  developing  networks  across  the  ministries  of \nhealth, health institutes, and other stakeholders; learning from one another\u2019s experiences; and \nembarking on joint research on critical regional health issues. Once the trust and networks are \nin  place,  then  the  GMS  countries  can  move  on  to  more  challenging  regional  cooperation  on \nhealth  initiatives  such  as  sharing  of  data  systems,  standardization  of  health  policies  and \nregulatory frameworks, and coordination of responses to outbreaks of disease. \n\n\f42 \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE COORDINATION \n\nExternal Assistance to Cambodia \n\n \nA. \n \nDisbursements  to  the  Cambodian  health  sector  in  2003  were  estimated  to  amount  to \n1. \n$90.3  million,  coming  mainly  from  the  United  States  ($22  million),  Japan  ($8  million),  United \nKingdom  ($7  million),  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  ($4  million),  and  World  Bank  ($3 \nmillion).1  This  estimate  is  close  to  the  $103  million  estimate  provided  by  the  Organization  for \nEconomic  Cooperation  and  Development  (OECD)2  for  external  assistance  to  Cambodia  for \nhealth, nutrition, and population.3 See Figure A4.1. \n \n\n \nFigure A4.1: Cambodia Health Assistance, by Donor and \nby CDC Allocation, 2003 \n\n \n\nWorld \nBank \n3% \n\nOther \n49% \n\nWHO \n4% \n\nADB \n2%  Japan\n9%\n\nUK\n8%\n\nUS\n25%\n\nNon CDC\n55%\n\nHIV/AIDS \n38% \n\nMalaria\n2% \n\nTB \n2% \n\nEPI\n3% \n\n \n\n \nADB = Asian  Development  Bank, CDC =  communicable  diseases control, EPI = Expanded Program  on \nImmunization,  HIV/AIDS  =  human  immunodeficiency  virus/acquired  immunodeficiency  syndrome,  TB  = \ntuberculosis, UK = United Kingdom, US = United States, WHO = World Health Organization. \nSource:  Government  of  Cambodia.  2004.

Of  this \namount,  21\u201335%7  is  thought  to  come  from  donors.  In  1998,  total  external  assistance  was \nestimated to be $13.7 million in 1998, with key donors being the World Bank (15%), ADB (8%), \nAustralia  (11%),  Sweden  (13%),  and  Japan  (8%).8    Since  then,  contributions  from  Australia, \nGermany,  the  European  Union,  Sweden  and  the  World  Bank  have  been  discontinued  or \nreduced  substantially.  Estimated  external  assistance  to  health,  nutrition,  and  population  in  the \nLao  PDR  reduced  to  $8.9  million  in  2003  OECD9,  or  8%  of  all  overseas  development \nassistance. Since 2004, external assistance for the sector has been improving, and is likely to \nreach about $15 million in 2005. \n \n5. \nTotal  obligated  funds  for  2006-2010  amount  to  $99.3  million.  Major  donors  are  the \nGlobal  Fund  ($16.6  million),  the  World  Bank  ($15  million),  ADB  ($12.7  million),  the  Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency  ($11.4  million),  the  Global  Alliance  for  Vaccination  and \nImmunization ($6.8 million), the Government of Luxembourg ($5.0 million), the Government of \nIndia ($4.9 million), and the Belgium Technical Cooperation ($4.2 million). Substantial additional \nfunding  is  expected  from  ADB,  Australia,  Canada,  the  United  States  and  the  World  Bank  for \navian  influenza,  HIV/AIDS,  and  health  sector  development.  The  share  of  donor  assistance  for \nCDC is estimated to be 36%, compared to 38% in 1998, but is likely to increase substantially for \navian  influenza  and  HIV/AIDS.  Excluding  spending  on  global  public  goods  such  as  avian \ninfluenza  control,  total  per  capita  spending  on  health  is  expected  to  double  over  the  next  5 \nyears,  to  reach  a  level  comparable  with  current  spending  in  Viet  Nam,  and  about  half  the \nrecommended international minimum level of spending on health care. As fiscal constraints are \nlikely to persist over the next five years, external assistance will remain a major component of \nthe public health budget and as such will need to be carefully balanced between investment and \nrecurrent  spending.  Indeed,  a  substantial  share  of  external  assistance  will  be  required  to \noperate and improve the quality of current health services, and make health services affordable \nfor the poor.  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n6  Ministry of Health, Cambodia. 2004.

The mother and child health \nprogram attracted the most external assistance, with commitments of $364 million in 2003. Of \nCDC  support,  HIV/AIDS,  malaria,  and  tuberculosis  receive  the  most  assistance.  With  more \nHIV/AIDS  funding  coming  in  over  the  last  1\u20132  years,  the  level  of  resources  devoted  to  this \ndisease  has  increased  dramatically.  Public  sector  budget  allocations  have  increased,  from  $4 \nmillion in 2001 to more than $5 million in 2004. External support is also increasing quickly, from \naround $5 million in 2001 to a projected $50 million in 2006. \n \n9. \nAgencies  involved  in  regional  assistance  are  discussed  in  Appendix  3,  Health  Sector \nAnalysis, para 28. Since the preparation of this project proposal, several countries or their aid \nagencies have taken or proposed new regional initiatives in response to an increasing likelihood \nof an avian influenza pandemic, including Australia, Canada, the European Union, France, and \nthe  United  States.  Five  Mekong  countries  themselves  (excluding  the  People\u2018s  Republic  of \nChina)  have  established  a  public  health  working  group  under  the  Ayeyawady-Chao  Phraya-\nMekong  Economic  Cooperation  Strategy  (ACMECS).  This  working  group  will  be  focusing  on \nCDC,  in  particular  avian  influenza,  HIV/AIDS,  and  malaria  control.  In  addition,  Governments \nhave signed various bilateral agreements for cross-border cooperation which are often dormant \ndue to a lack of funding and staff resources.      \n\n\f46 \n\n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nREGIONAL DIALOGUE AND COOPERATION \n \n\nRegional Cooperation and Capacity Building \n\nA. \n \nThe  Regional  Communicable  Diseases  Control  (CDC)  Steering  Committee  established \n1. \nunder the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) will continue to meet every 6 months \nin the first year of the Project, and at least once a year in later years, with hosting rotated among \nthe  three  countries.  The  Regional  CDC  Steering  Committee  will  provide  guidance  on  project \nimplementation, policy dialogue, and the building of regional capacity and cooperation for CDC. \nIt will be chaired by the minister or vice-minister of the host country and will consist of leading \nrepresentatives  from  the  national  steering  committees,  project  staff,  and  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB) representatives. \n \n2. \nThe CDC Project, as a regional project, presents unique opportunities for collaboration \namong participating countries, as well as a set of challenges to inter-country cooperation. CLV \ncountries  lack  a  formal  institutional  arrangement  for  responding  to  communicable  disease \noutbreaks at the regional level, but several bilateral arrangements are in place. The Project will \nsupport  regional  cooperation  for  CDC  by  further  institutionalizing  regional  collaboration  as  a \nstandard  feature  of  ministries  of  health  (MOHs).  This  requires  each  MOH  to  strengthen  its \ninstitutional capacity for regional collaboration in terms of structure, staff, budget, authority, and \nresponsibilities. No new separate institutions are being proposed. The regional coordinator will \nbe responsible for building capacity for regional dialogue and cooperation in each MOH. \n \nB. \n\nManagement of Regional CDC Funds \n\n3. \nTo  facilitate  the  flow  of  funds  for  regional  activities,  $4.3  million,  or  11%  of  the  project \nfunds, will be administered by ADB as a regional CDC fund for regional cooperation, managed \nby  the  regional  coordination  unit  (RCU).  This  fund  will  cover  expenditures  for  the  Project\u2019s \nregional steering committee (RSC), technical forums, international consulting services, regional \nstudies, cross-border activities, and the RCU itself. ADB\u2019s administration of the pooled regional \nfunds  is  considered  necessary  for  the  efficient  release  of  funds.  The  reason  is  that  financial \ntransfers for the regional activities between the ministries of finance is a complicated and time-\nconsuming process that could greatly delay the activities. The three governments agreed to this \narrangement according to the grant agreement. \n \n4. \nThe regional CDC fund will be financed from ADB\u2019s share of the grant on the basis of a \n30:20:50 ratio for Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), and Viet Nam, \nrespectively.  The  contribution  to  the  RCU  and  regional  activities  will  follow  this  same  ratio, \nexcept  for  the  financing  of  studies,  which  will  be  decided  individually  by  the  countries  through \nthe RSC.       \n \n5. \nOf  this  regional  CDC  fund,  $1.6  million  will  be  used  to  secure  technical  consulting \nservices  through  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO).  This  represents  $0.48  million  of  the \ngrant  allocation  from  ADB  for  Cambodia,  $0.32  million  for  the  Lao  PDR,  and  0.80  million  for \nViet Nam,  as  provided  in  the  grant  agreement  with  each  recipient  country,  but  it  excludes \nWHO\u2019s  $0.9  million  contribution  for  experts.  WHO  and  ADB  will  sign  an  agreement  for  this \npurpose.  The  agreement  will  specify  (i)  the  type  of  experts  to  be  provided  by  WHO,  (ii)  the \nmanner  in  which  these  experts  will  operate  in  close  coordination  with  MOH,  and  (iii)  the \nimplementation  arrangements  such  as  the  selection  of  experts,  reporting,  disbursement \narrangements, and performance review.  \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n  47\n\nC. \n\nKey Lessons Learned in Regional and Cross-Border Collaboration in Health \n\nVision for Regional Cooperation in Health for the Greater Mekong Subregion  \n\n6. \nRegional  and  cross-border  cooperation  in  health  matters  is  not  intended  to  replace \nnational  disease  control  efforts  and  health  services.  Instead,  it  is  meant  to  supplement  or \nreinforce  these  national  and  local  efforts  by  addressing  common  gaps  or  pockets  of  infection \nthat national and local programs and services have missed.1 Despite the many advantages of \nregional health cooperation, collaboration has been difficult to achieve even in North America. \nGlobalization has had minimal success in bringing together health professionals from both sides \nof  a  border,  even  along  the  US-Mexico  border  with  its  high  level  of  interactions  and  shared \nculture.  A  pair  of  researchers  has  advanced  a  useful  typology  of  the  main  barriers  to  cross-\nborder  collaboration,  and  some  of  the  potential  barriers  to  cross-border  health  activities  are \nsummarized in Table A5.1.2 A key lesson that can be derived from these barriers is that cross-\nborder  collaboration  in  health  must  involve  the  central,  state/provincial,  and  local  levels,  and \nboth public and private sectors. \n \nD. \n \n7. \nCooperation in the health sector among the CLV countries is still in a nascent stage of \ndevelopment. The memorandums of understanding for health sector cooperation are relatively \nrecent,  and  the  agreed  upon  frameworks  have  in  most  instances  not  been  followed  up  with \nsufficient action or implementation details.  \n \n8. \nA  critical  success  factor  in  effective  cooperation  arrangements  is  the prior  existence  of \ninformal  networks  across  the  participating  countries.  The  absence  of  such  networks  typically \ncauses a lag between when the cooperative framework is established and when it is acted on \nand the benefits are manifested, because the necessary linkages across institutions need time \nto develop. This is clearly true of the health ministries, laboratories, and health institutes in the \nCLV countries. The networks are not in place because of limited opportunities for interfacing at \nthe technical level. \n \n9. \nAchieving greater collaboration in health and other future health objectives will require a \nstrong  foundation  for  regional  cooperation  that  the  CLV  countries  now  lack.  Component  3  will \ncontribute  to  developing  a  better,  more  sustainable  foundation  for  regional  cooperation  in  the \nhealth sector mainly through (i) specific technical forums that will bring together specialist health \nofficials  to  discuss  key  problems  and  issues,  exchange  knowledge,  and  promote  greater \nfamiliarity  and  understanding  about  one  another\u2019s  systems,  policies,  and  programs;  and \n(ii) cooperative institutional partnerships that will jointly investigate shared problems and identify \nappropriate  regional  solutions.  These \ninstitutional  networks  are  basic \nrequirements  for  regional  cooperation  and  must  already  be  in  place  for  high-level  cooperation \nagreements in the health sector to bear fruit. Once the trust and networks are established, then \nthe  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  countries  can  move  on  to  more  challenging  regional  health \ninitiatives  such  as  sharing  of  data  systems,  standardization  of  health  policies  and  regulatory \nframeworks, and coordination of responses to outbreaks of disease. \n \n\nindividual  and \n\n                                                 \n1  Lemma Merid, 2003. \u201cA Regional Perspective Towards Managing HIV/AIDS in Northeast Africa,\u201d Journal of Health \n\nand Population in Developing Countries. \n\n2  The categories of barriers were defined in Homedes, Nuria and Antonio Ugalde. 2003. \u201cGlobalization and Health at \nthe US-Mexico Border,\u201d American Journal  of Public Health, volume 93,  2016\u20132022.

A  medium-term  vision  for  regional  cooperation  in  health  in  the  GMS \ncould  build  on  this  foundation  and  partly  revolve  around  the  revised  International  Health \nRegulations (IHR). The new IHR will provide member countries with a common reference point \nfor coordinating international responses to global health threats, but these responses are likely \nto  occur  in  regional  or  subregional,  as  opposed  to  truly  global,  contexts.  The  GMS,  perhaps \nthrough  a  more  formal  arrangement  (but  without  a  physical  institution)  such  as  a  GMS  Health \nCommission with ministers of health as members, could serve as a key building block for IHR. \nThe  GMS  Health  Commission  would  provide  leadership  in  the  development  of  regional  and \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n  49\n\ncross-border  health  strategies  for  the  GMS;  coordinate  the  implementation  of  the  revised  IHR \nand  their  accompanying  technical,  policy,  or  legislative  requirements  among  the  six  countries; \nand ensure high-level commitment and support for local cross-border health initiatives.  \n \nE. \n\nRegional Coordination for Dialogue \n\n11. \nADB\u2019s  Medium-Term  Strategy  asserts  that  ineffective  institutions  and  policies  are  the \nbiggest  constraints  on  growth  and  development  in  the  medium  term.  It  also  states  that  the \nefficiency of investments depends largely on the quality of the policy and legal frameworks in a \ncountry. Regional policy dialogue has proven to be highly effective in allowing policy makers to \nreflect  on  critical  policy  matters,  exchange  views,  and  explore  cooperative  mechanisms.3  The \nrecent health threats from severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian flu have demonstrated \nthe  importance  of  not  only  technical  cooperation  among  countries  but also  policy  cooperation. \nAn important part of strengthening national health systems and providing greater protection from \nthe  spread  of  diseases  is  to  enhance  the  legislative,  regulatory,  and  policy  frameworks  of  a \ncountry\u2019s health sector. \n \n12. \nAdditionally, the CLV countries face several common challenges in the health sector\u2014\namong  others,  how  and  where  to  obtain  financing,  how  to  deal  with  technical  constraints  in \nimplementing  health  interventions,  how  to  improve  access  to  health  services  for  ethnic \nminorities  and  the  poor\u2014and  have  gained  experience  in  what  works  well  and  what  does  not. \nWhat is lacking, however, are suitable opportunities to exchange knowledge and learn from one \nanother about particular technical and policy issues. The lessons learned often apply as well to \nother  countries  or  localities,  and  could  be  used  to  develop  the  health  systems  in  all  three \ncountries.  \n \n13. \nThus,  the  technical  forums  noted  in  component  3,  subcomponent  1,  will  feature  policy \nand  technical  dialogue  in  a  peer  setting  among  the  CLV  countries  for  health  systems \ndevelopment.4 Health officials from the three countries can (i) exchange ideas and experiences \nin health policies, laws, and financing options; (ii) explore opportunities to coordinate and raise \npolicy and legal standards among the CLV countries; (iii) identify gaps in national policies that \nmake  the  entire  region  more  vulnerable  to  communicable  diseases,  and  determine  how  such \ngaps could be addressed; (iv) exchange lessons learned and \u201cgood practices\u201d related to specific \nhealth  interventions,  such  as  improving  access  to  health  services  for  ethnic  minorities  and \nwomen;5  and  (v)  coordinate  the  project  activities  for  targeted  diseases.  The  types  of  forums \nscheduled are in Table A5.2. \n \n14.  Most of these policy and technical dialogue sessions will be conducted in relatively small \ngroups  of  appropriate  officials  from  the  CLV  countries  to  encourage  more  open  and  informal \nexchange.6  Where  appropriate,  the  technical  forums  should  involve  other  key  stakeholders  in \naddition to the MOHs. Officials in agriculture, education, water and sanitation, planning, and law \ncould  also  participate  at  times,  along  with  ministries,  departments,  or  associations for  women. \n                                                 \n3   The  effectiveness  of  the  Inter-American  Development  Bank\u2019s  \u201cRegional  Policy  Dialogue\u201d  forum  in  dealing  with  a \nrange of policy issues has been acknowledged by the member countries. See Inter-American Development Bank. \n2003. Regional Integration: Strategy Document. Washington, DC.  \n\n4  These will be in addition to the meetings of the Regional Steering Committee. \n5  One important area to be considered is lessons learned about improving vaccination coverage for ethnic minorities. \nSome provinces and districts of the CLV countries have been much more successful than other areas in increasing \nvaccination coverage rates for similar ethnic minorities. This success has to do not only with having enough health \nworkers but also with communicating with and educating the ethnic minorities about vaccinations. \n\n6  The  Regional  Steering  Committee,  the  national  committees,  and  the  Executing  Agencies  will  identify  the \n\nappropriate participants in the dialogue sessions. \n\n\f50 \n\n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nThe countries could request external resource persons or experts to facilitate particular topics, \nbut the objective is for the officials to discuss the issues among themselves, exchange lessons \nlearned, and coordinate project activities. Also, the sessions will be hosted and co-organized by \nthe appropriate department or agency in the three countries on a rotating basis. The agenda for \neach dialogue session will be prepared jointly by the host ministry or department, the RCU, and \nthe  project  consultants  (if  any)  who  are  involved  in  the  related  activities.  The  RSC  may  also \nspecify  particular  issues,  particularly  relating  to  project  implementation,  that  the  forums  must \naddress. Additionally, the participation of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and Thailand in \nselected  policy  forums  will  be  of  great  benefit  in  view  of  their  experiences  and  the  expected \nimprovement in mutual understanding and cooperation in CDC that would result from it.  \n \n\nTable A5.2: Proposed Regional Forums \n\n\u2022  Regional surveillance and response (with a focus on avian influenza) (3 forums) \n\u2022  Health regulations and standards (3 forums) \n\u2022  Disease-specific forums for targeted diseases under the Project7 \n\n                       \u2013 Regional control of dengue fever (3 forums) \n                       \u2013 HIV/AIDS8 and migrants (3 forums) \n                       \u2013 Eradication and control of parasitic infections: filariasis and schistosomiasis (2 forums) \n                       \u2013 Common childhood illnesses (e.g., acute respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases) \n\n(2 forums) \n\n\u2022  Financing and health systems development for communicable disease control (3 forums) \n\u2022  Targeting of vulnerable groups (3 forums) \n\nHIV/AIDS = human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \nSource:  ADB staff. \n \n15. \nAn  important  dimension  of  the  policy  and  technical  dialogue  forums  is  the  preparation \nand use of case studies. Case studies are an effective tool for presenting lessons learned and \nassessing the impact of interventions, policies, and financing options. Participating officials will \nbe encouraged to exchange and use case studies during the dialogue sessions. \n \nF. \n\nFunding and Implementation of CLV Consortia Initiatives \n\nThe  second  subcomponent  of  component  3  is  regional  operations  research  and  the \n16. \npromotion of institutional linkages. Funds will be set aside for regional operations research on \nHIV/AIDS. Most HIV/AIDS prevention and control is done at the national and community levels, \nbut  particular  cross-border  HIV/AIDS  issues  and  challenges  are  demonstrating  the  need  for \nselected regional initiatives as well. A major concern is the increasing difficulty of preventing and \ncontrolling  HIV/AIDS  because  of  the  inter-country  mobility  of  people,  facilitated  by  road  and \nother infrastructure projects of international and regional development institutions. Commercial \nservice women, trafficked women, construction workers, truck drivers, and other mobile groups \nmoving  across  different  parts  of  the  GMS  contribute  greatly  to  the  spread  of  the  disease  and \ntheir detection and treatment are often beyond the reach of health service providers.  \n \n17. \nThe  Project  will  support  a  series  of  high-quality  research  studies  on  particular  regional \naspects  of  the  HIV/AIDS  epidemiology  in  the  three  countries  by  building  on  the  extensive \ndatabase (including baseline and final surveys, prevalence surveys, and records of input/output \ndata) generated by the \u201cCommunity Action for the Prevention of HIV/AIDS\u201d Project. Key topics \n\n                                                 \n7  The  disease-specific  forums  will  focus  on  technical  issues  related  to  these  diseases,  lessons  learned,  and  the \n\ncoordination of the Project\u2019s activities in this regard.  \n\n8   Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency virus. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n  51\n\nfor  research  include  emerging  women  trafficking  patterns  and  their  impact  on  HIV/AIDS; \nvulnerability  and  risk  associated  with  transport  corridors;  road  construction  and  other  major \ninfrastructure  development;  and  mobility  of  labor  (formal  and  informal)  within  and  between \ncountries.  \n \n18. \nA  specific  research  agenda  will  be  developed  and  approved  by  the  PPTA  RSC  before \nthe  Project.  Terms  of  reference  for  each  identified  research  study  will  also  be  prepared  in \nadvance.  Research  projects  up  to  $100,000  will  be  commissioned  through  local  competitive \nbidding  or  direct  purchase,  and  only  national  institutes  will  be  eligible.  Research  projects  of \n$100,001  and  up  to  $1  million  will  be  tendered  through  international  shopping.  The  research \nfunds will be held by ADB until ready for disbursement. Funds will then be channeled through an \nimprest  account  for  the  RCU  and  released  to  the  institutes  (up  to  $100,000  and  then \nreplenished if necessary). \n \n19. \nThe  main  objective  of  the  institutional  linkages  activity  is  to  establish  (or  strengthen) \nlinkages  among  health  institutions  in  conducting  joint  research  and  developing  successful \ninterventions based on geography (instead of formal international boundaries) at the local level \nor  pertinent  to  all  three  countries  at  the  national  level.  A  critical  success  factor  in  new \ncooperation  arrangements  is  the  prior  existence  of  informal  networks  across  the  participating \ncountries. The absence of such networks typically causes a lag between when the cooperative \nframework is established and when it is acted on and the benefits are manifested, because the \nnecessary linkages across institutions take time to develop.  \n \n20. \nThis  is  clearly  the  case  regarding  health  ministries,  laboratories,  and  institutes  in  the \nCLV countries. The networks are not in place because of limited opportunities for interfacing at \nthe technical level. Therefore, high-level political agreements to cooperate in the health sector \nare unlikely to bear much fruit until networks and linkages develop among the technical health \nspecialists. \n \n21. \nResearch  studies  for  institutional  linkage  building  (i.e.,  non-HIV/AIDS  research)  will  be \nselected  in  a  \u201ccompetitive\u201d  process,  with  consortia  of  CLV  institutions  preparing  their  bids \naccording  to  standard  ADB  procedures.  The  consortia  must  each  have  at  least  one \ninstitution/agency  from  each  of  the  three  countries,  and  can  include  both  public  and  private \ninstitutions,  as  well  as  institutions  or  associations  outside  the  standard  health  sector,  such  as \nwomen\u2019s unions or ministries of women\u2019s affairs (eligible private sector institutions must have a \ntrack record acceptable to the MOH). See Table A5.3 for the preliminary list of potential public \nsector  participating  institutions.  Research  study  designs  should  include  details  on  the \nprocurement of additional equipment necessary to conduct the research project. \n \n22. \nFour categories of research topics have been identified as priority areas for institutional \ncooperation  in  health  systems  development  and  CDC  among  the  CLV  countries.  These  are \n(i) financing  and  health  systems  development,  (ii)  targeting  of  vulnerable  groups,  (iii) cross-\nborder health issues, and (iv) health regulations and standards. A specific research agenda in \neach  of  these  priority  areas  will  be  developed  and  approved  by  the  PPTA  RSC  before  the \nProject. Terms of reference for each identified research study will also be prepared in advance. \nA Selection Committee composed of vice/deputy health ministers in the CLV countries and ADB \nwill review the applicants\u2019 bids and detailed proposals.9  \n \n\n                                                 \n9  The  Selection  Committee  may  simply  be  the  Regional  Steering  Committee  (RSC)  itself  or  a  separate  committee \n\nappointed by the RSC. \n\n\f52 \n\n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nTo avoid spreading the funds too thinly across several small projects, no project should \n23. \nbe less than $50,000. A minimum threshold is set with a view to producing research results that \napply more widely  (i.e., a \u201cbigger picture\u201d) to the CLV countries rather than many small projects \nof limited use to the countries. Research projects up to $100,000 will be commissioned through \nlocal  competitive  bidding  or  direct  purchase,  and  only  national  institutes  will  be  eligible. \nResearch  projects  of  $100,001  and  up  to  $1  million  will  be  tendered  through  international \nshopping. The research funds will be held by ADB until ready for disbursement. Funds will then \nbe  channeled  through  an  imprest  account  for  the  RCU  and  released  to  the  institutes  (up  to \n$100,000 and then replenished if necessary). \n \n\nTable A5.3: Potential Participants from the Public Sector \n\nCambodia \n\nLao PDR \n\nViet Nam \n\n \n\nCommunicable Disease \nControl Department \nDepartment of Planning and \nHealth Information \nNational Center for \nHIV/AIDS, Dermatology, and \nSTD Control  \nNational Institute of Public \nHealth  \n\nDepartment of Hygiene and \nPrevention \nDepartment of Planning and \nBudgeting \nCenter for HIV/AIDS and STI \n\nNational Center for Laboratory \nand Epidemiology \n\nViet Nam Administration of \nPreventive Medicine \nDepartment of Planning and Finance \n\nViet Nam Administration of \nHIV/AIDS, Center for Social \nDiseases Control \nNational Institute of Hygiene and \nEpidemiology, Central Highlands \nInstitute of Hygiene and \nEpidemiology, Pasteur Institutes (Ho \nChi Minh City and Nha Trang) \nNational Institute of Malariology, \nParasitology, and Entomology \n\nDepartment of Food and Drugs \n\nNational Center of Malarialogy, \nParasitology and Entomology \n\nDepartment of Food Safety and \nHygiene \nWomen\u2019s Union, Youth Union  \n\nNational Center for \nParasitology, Entomology, \nand Malaria Control \nDepartment of Drug, Food, \nand Cosmetics \nMinistry of Women\u2019s Affairs  Women\u2019s Union, Youth Union \nHIV/AIDS  =  human  immunodeficiency  virus/acquired  immunodeficiency  syndrome,  Lao  PDR  =  the  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, STD = sexually transmitted disease, STI = sexually transmitted infections. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n24. \nFor  the  implementation  of  research  studies,  each  consortium  will  be  responsible  for \nmanaging  the  project  budget  within  the  total  approved  amount,  following  ADB  regulations \nregarding  procurement  and  procedures.  The  implementation  of  the  project  should  follow  the \nterms  of  reference  approved  by  the  Selection Committee,  but  amendments  can  be  made  with \nwritten  approval  from  the  committee.  Reporting  requirements  will  be  specified  in  the  terms  of \nreference.  To  overcome  the  initial  dearth  of  contacts,  a  workshop  will  be  held  for  prospective \ninstitutions, departments, and others to allow them to learn about the project requirements and \ncriteria and facilitate initial contact among prospective partners.  \n \nG. \n \nThe  Project  will  also  fund  cross-border  health  activities  in  which  border  provinces  and \n25. \ntheir local communities can formally interact, identify common health needs and solutions, and \ninitiate pilot cross-border projects. Provincial, district, and village health officials will participate \nalong  with  health  nongovernment  organizations  and  community  leaders.  An  initial  pilot  border \nmeeting  will  be  arranged  by  Cambodia\u2019s  National  Committee  on  Border  Health  Cooperation. \nCross-border activities that are proposed under the Project are listed in Table A5.4. \n \n\nCross-Border Health Activities \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n  53\n\nTable A5.4: Indicative List of Cross-Border Activities \n \n\nProposed Activities \nJoint training of \nquarantine staff \n\nPromotion and monitoring \nof food safety and \nhygiene  \n\nCoordinated \nimmunization campaigns \nacross the border, in \nparticular among ethnic \nminorities \n\nBinational TB referral and \ncase management \n\nDeployment of mobile \nhealth units in border \nareas \n\nEnrollment of women into \nprenatal care earlier in \ntheir pregnancies  \n\nArrangements for the \ntransfer of patients \nrequiring more \nspecialized treatment in \nnearby health facilities \nacross the border \n\nComments \nQuarantine  staff  and  other  border  health  officials  will  be  trained  in  early \ndiagnosis and rapid testing of malaria and TB among migrants. \n \nDiarrheal  diseases  from  unsafe  food  are  a  major  cause  of  morbidity  in \nborder  areas,  where sanitation  is  generally  poor  and  the people have  less \nknowledge  about  how  to  handle  food  properly.  Coordinated  campaigns \namong  border  communities  will  have  economies  of  scale  and  broaden \nproject reach. \n \nIncreased  vaccination  coverage  has  produced  a  dramatic  decline  in  the \nincidence  of  some  infectious  diseases.  To  detect,  control,  and  prevent \ninfectious  diseases  that  are  vaccine-preventable,  border  regions  must \ncoordinate  their  immunization  campaigns  so  as  not  to  miss  children  and \nwomen in remote areas or moving across borders. \n \nReducing  tuberculosis  rates  requires  active  surveillance,  including  testing \nat-risk populations, providing curative therapy to TB patients, and ensuring \nthat therapy is completed. All this is necessary to prevent drug-resistant TB, \nwhich is more difficult and expensive to deal with. \n \nThe establishment of mobile health units in border areas could significantly \nextend  the  provision  of  health-care  services.  People  in  border  areas  are \noften located far from stationary health facilities and often cannot afford the \ncosts  of  transportation  to  receive  services  or,  if  already  ill,  are  physically \nunable to make a long journey. \n \nAccess to prenatal care remains an issue on both sides of the border in the \nCLV  countries.  To  reduce  negative  outcomes  at  delivery  for  both  the \nmothers and the newborns, early start of prenatal care is important for the \nidentification of health problems and risk factors. \n \nIn  certain  border  areas,  specialized  health  facilities  or  providers  are \navailable  across  the  border,  but  immigration,  quarantine,  and  other \nobstacles  prevent  patients  from  getting  the  care  they  need.  An  existing \nmemorandum  of  understanding  between  Cambodia  and  the  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic  Republic,  for  example,  calls  for  such  cooperation  in  treating \nnationals from the other side of the border, but the details that would allow \nthis to happen still have to be agreed. \n\nCLV = Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, and Viet Nam; TB = tuberculosis. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n \nTable A6.1: Cambodia: Cost Categories, by Year and Source of Financing, 2006\u20132009 \n($\u2019000) \n \n2007 \n\n2009 \n\n  \n \n\n  \n \n\n2006 \n\n2008 \nADB/WHO  Gov\u2019t  ADB/WHO  Gov\u2019t  ADB/WHO  Gov\u2019t  ADB/WHO  Gov\u2019t  ADB/WHO  Gov\u2019t \n\nTotal \n\n5\n4\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n6\n \n\ni\n\n  \n \nA.

The  local  project \nperformance  monitoring  system  will  indicate  specific  quantitative  targets  and  add  indicators \nrelated  to  local  health  needs.  Health  status  and  health  service  coverage  are  linked  to  the \nMillennium Development Goals and will be measured through national surveys that are already \nplanned. Local surveys (i.e., at district level), will measure the prevalence of specific diseases \nand  coverage  before  and  after  the  Project  in  targeted  areas  and  among  targeted  populations, \nand  behavioral  change  among  target  groups.  Given  the  preventive  nature  of  many  of  the \ninterventions,  the  Project  will  also  rely  on  output  and  process  indicators  to  monitor  progress. \nInput indicators will also be carefully documented to help in cost and economic analysis. \n\n \nTable A12: Project Indicators and Targets \n \n\nType \nA.

This  appendix \nanalyzes  the  economic  justification  for  the  proposed  investment  in  regional  communicable \ndiseases control (CDC).  \n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe overall anticipated impact of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Regional CDC \nProject is containment of the spread of epidemic diseases at the local level and reduction of the \nburden of common endemic diseases in Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao \nPDR),  and  Viet  Nam  by  about  15%  overall,  and  more  for  certain  specific  infections.1  This  will \nhelp the CLV countries progress toward their health-related Millennium Development Goals for \n2015. The expected project outcomes are (i) timely and adequate control of epidemics that are \nlikely to have a major impact on the region\u2019s public health and economy; (ii) improved coverage \nof prevention and care of communicable diseases in vulnerable populations, in particular poor \nwomen  and  children  living  in  border  areas;  (iii)  improved  know-how,  policies,  standards,  and \ncoordination of countries to improve CDC, including HIV/AIDS2 control; and (iv) efficient project \nmanagement.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe  Project  has  national  benefits\u2014resulting  from  a  reduction  in  the  macroeconomic \nimpact  of  emerging  diseases  like  avian  influenza,  severe  acute  respiratory  syndrome  (SARS), \nand dengue fever, and in the incidence of diseases such as helminthiasis, digestive diseases, \nHIV/AIDS, measles, and other diseases in selected vulnerable populations. The CLV countries \nhave  nearly  100  million  people,  about  17  million  of  whom  live  below  the  international  poverty \nline  of  $1  per  day  (purchasing  power  parity).  Many  of  these  people  are  ethnic  minorities  and \nwomen  and  children  living  in  remote  border  areas,  where  the  prevalence  of  communicable \ndisease  is  disproportionately  high.  The  proposed  project  interventions  have  been  designed  to \nspecifically address these groups by developing capacity, improving access to health facilities, \nand providing equipment and drugs in priority areas of need. \n \nC. \n \nThe  economic  and  equity-based  rationales  for  investing  in  CDC  are  extremely  high. \n4. \nThere  are  strong  linkages  between  health  and  the  burden  of  infectious  diseases  and  labor \nproductivity.  A  range  of  macroeconomic  studies  suggest  that  improved  health  is  empirically \nrelated to economic growth3 (see review in Macroeconomics and Health: Investing in Health for \nEconomic  Development,  J.  Sachs  and  others),  and  specifically  in  relation  to  CDC,  research \nindicates  that  high  prevalence  of  diseases  such  as  malaria  or  HIV/AIDS  is  associated  with \nsignificantly  lower  rates  of  economic  growth.  For  example,  the  impact  of  HIV/AIDS  on  the \nannual rate of economic growth ranges from 0% to 2% (Bloom and Mahal 1997, Bonnel 2000).4 \n \n\nRationale for Investment \n\n                                                 \n1  The  Project  covers  Cambodia,  Lao  PDR,  and  Viet  Nam.  Other  GMS  countries  (People\u2019s  Republic  of  China, \n\nMyanmar, and Thailand) will take part in regional dialogue. \n\n2   Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n3  Sachs, J. and others. 2001.

Bangkok. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n69\n\nDespite the high economic rates of return estimated for investments in the health sector, \n5. \nprivate  participation  is  suboptimal.  This  under-investment  is  due  to  the  market  failures  that \ncharacterize health investment and the need to promote regional public goods. Market failures \ninclude incomplete information about the benefits of investments in health and nutrition and the \nway  in  which  such  investments  can  be  made  cost-effective;  economies  of  information; \nexternalities  in  some  markets,  for  example,  in  markets  for  investments  to  prevent  and  treat \ninfectious  diseases;  differences  between  private  and  social  discount  rates,  leading  to  private \ndecisions that do not adequately reflect long-term benefits; and intra-household decision making \nthat favors adults (and especially male adults) over children (and especially over girls), leading \nto under-investment in children\u2019s human capital, and especially in girls\u2019 human capital, relative \nto socially desired levels.5 \n \nThe  total  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  investment  of  $30  million  for  the  Project  will \n6. \nfocus  on  infectious  diseases  with  market  failure  characteristics\u2014such  as  communicable \ndiseases  that  spread  across  borders.  Economic  development  and  greater  connectivity  bring  a \nwide range of benefits for the countries in the region, but they also facilitate more rapid spread \nof diseases across borders. The SARS outbreak in 2003 and the avian influenza epidemics in \n2004  and  2005  highlighted  the  vulnerability  of  the  local  economy  to  even  relatively  minor  (in \nterms of number of people dying) disease outbreaks. Although SARS did not have much direct \nimpact on the CLV countries in terms of infected people and fatalities, the disease had profound \neconomic impact and slowed economic growth temporarily. Avian influenza is having a limited \nmacroeconomic  impact,  mainly  through  export  restrictions,  but  at  a  micro  level  it  has  a  major \nimpact on poor farmers. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is likely to be \na  human  influenza  pandemic  with  major  human  and  economic  costs.  Therefore,  it  is  vital  to \ndevelop capacity to slow down and contain new outbreaks. \n \nD. \n \nThe  quantitative  cost-benefit  analysis  for  the  Project  follows  the  methods  outlined  in \n7. \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.6 The analysis covers 25 years and is in \nconstant 2005 dollar prices. Key assumptions are as follows: \n\nCost-Benefit Analysis \n\nDiscount  rate.  The  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  was  assumed  to  be \n12%. Most health project analyses tend to use 3% as a discount factor; therefore, \nfuture  benefits  are  likely  to  be  given  greater  value.  To  harmonize  this  analysis \nwith the appraisal of other projects in non-health sectors, a higher discount rate is \nused.  \n\nEconomic cost of labor. The opportunity cost of labor or the shadow wage rate \nfor both urban and rural adults was calculated at $200 per year.  \n\nEconomic Costs \n\n \nE. \n \n8. \nBase investment costs are in constant 2005 dollar prices. Taxes and duties account for a \nsmall proportion of the project costs. Incremental recurrent costs are calculated for the 25 years \nafter  the  5-year  project  implementation  period.  These  costs  are  initially  high  relative  to  the \nproportion  of  overall  costs  because  the  investment  will  cover  the  procurement  of  drugs  and \n\n                                                 \n5   Knowles, J. 2003.

Recurrent costs are likely to scale down after 5 years, as beneficiaries \nprocure drugs with out-of-pocket financing.  \n \nF. \n \n9. \nThe  Project  will  improve  the  socioeconomic  condition  of  the  target  beneficiaries.  Key \nproject  benefits  are  to  be  estimated  in  the  following  ways:  (i)  cost  savings  due  to  increased \nhealth  awareness  and  reduced  disease  prevalence,  (ii)  enhanced  income  of  both  rural  and \nurban  income  earners  who  care  for  the  sick,  and  (iii)  decreased  costs  associated  with  the \noutbreak of emerging diseases such as SARS or avian influenza. These benefits are calculated \nfor  surveillance  and  response  and  the  control  of  communicable  diseases  in  vulnerable \npopulations,  as  well  as  sexually  transmitted  infection/HIV  in  migrant  populations  in  the  region. \nThe  analysis  is  based  on  the  cost  of  investments  and  recurrent  expenditure  over  a  25-year \nperiod (table available on request). \n \n10. \nComponent  1  is  designed  to  strengthen  the  surveillance  and  response  system  as  a \nincludes  disease  reporting,  diagnosis,  and \nwhole.  A  better-functioning  system,  which \nresponsiveness,  will  increase  capacity  to  identify  and  curtail  the  spread  of  infectious  disease. \nPreventing and quickly responding to outbreaks of endemic diseases such as measles, cholera, \ntyphoid, and a range of other notifiable diseases including SARS and avian influenza will reduce \nthe  number  of  cases  and,  hence,  the  burden  of  disease  in  the  CLV  countries.7  However,  the \nincidence  of  emerging  diseases  is  difficult  to  estimate,  given  the  limited  history  of  SARS  and \navian influenza. \n \nTargeted  surveillance  and  response,  along  with  targeted  control  of  endemic  diseases, \n11. \nwill  reduce  the  burden  of  these  diseases  and  generate  economic  benefits  largely  through \nreduced  out-of-pocket  expenditures.  A  number  of  surveys  have  been  undertaken  across  the \nCLV countries examining the economic costs that outbreaks of dengue and HIV/AIDS inflict on \nhousehold incomes, savings, and expenditure. In summary, the findings show that  \n \n\nincreased  health  awareness  and  improved  communicable  disease  control \nleads  to  cost  savings.  Resource  or  out-of-pocket  savings  may  flow  from  a \nreduction in (a) transport costs, as a result of better access to health services, and \n(b) the cost of treatment, as a result of more efficient and rational diagnosis and \ntreatment.8  Better  health  resulting  from  health  awareness  activities  means \nsignificantly  less  out-of-pocket  health  expenditures.  In  the  case  of  Cambodia, \nfor  public  health  project \nsavings  of  $4\u2013$6  per  person  were  assumed \nimplementation. \n\nthe income of rural and urban adults increases. Adults often have to care for \nsick  children  or  may  contract  infectious  disease  themselves  and  suffer  reduced \nwork  productivity.  The  nature  of  these  productivity  losses  has  received  limited \nattention  in the  literature,  although  demographic  and  household  surveys  indicate \nthat  considerable  time  is  lost  in  transporting  family  members  to  health  facilities \n(see footnote 6).  \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\n                                                 \n7  For baseline assumptions, see the report on the project preparatory technical assistance. \n8  ADB.  2002.

The \navian  influenza  outbreak  since  late  2003  is  estimated  to  have  cost  Mekong \ncountries  $563  million.  The  largest  component  of  economic  impact  relates  to \nmarket  restrictions  and  their  impact  on  integrated  commercial  producers  and \npoultry  input  suppliers  in  Thailand.  USDA  (2005)  estimated  $137  million  in \nintegrated producer costs and $186 million in supplier costs in 2004. At this stage, \nthe  economic  impact  on  the  health  sector  and  people  is  relatively  small,  largely \nbecause only 64 human cases have been identified so far. ADB (2004) noted that \n\u201cIf the epidemic remains confined to animals, as has been the case up to now, it is \nlikely that the aggregate impact on the economies of the region will be relatively \nlimited and hardly perceptible given the underlying strong growth trends projected \nfor the Asian and Pacific region in 2004.\u201d Among the countries affected, Thailand \nwill  feel  the  strongest  impact  because  of  the  importance  of  the  industry  in  its \nexport sector. ADB estimated that the SARS epidemic, which lasted one quarter, \nled  to  business  losses  of  $59  billion  (measured  as  total  final  expenditures)  and \nreduced  gross  domestic  product  by  about  $18  billion  (0.8%).  The  CLV  countries \nwere not subject to the major economic impact of these losses.    \n\nFinancial Sustainability Analysis \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return \n\n \nG. \n \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated to be 34%, and the economic \n12. \nnet present value is $29 million. This EIRR probably underestimates the total economic benefits \nfrom the Project. Other factors must be considered; these include improvements in health and \neducation  systems  efficiency;  in  decentralization  and  local  capacity;  in  women\u2019s  knowledge, \nskills,  employment  opportunities,  and  access  to  services  (gender  benefits);  and  in  cognitive \ndevelopment and school performance. \n \nH. \n \n13. \nThe  Project\u2019s  recurrent  costs  include  the  staff  costs  of  integrated  service  delivery, \nprocurement of medical supplies, and ongoing institutional strengthening costs, which together \naccount for about $1.7 million in 2009, the final year of project implementation, but are expected \nto  decline  to  $1.1  million  by  2012.  These  costs  represent  only  a  minor  percentage  of \ngovernment health expenditure in Cambodia and Viet Nam, and a modest sum in Lao PDR, for \nwhich provisions have been made in future health budgets. It is envisaged that recurrent costs \nwould be scaled back as households purchase items such as worm tablets.  \n \nI. \n \n14. \nThe economic and social benefits of undertaking the CDC Project are substantial, given \nthe recent trends in poverty, health, and education services in the CLV countries. The analysis \nabove demonstrates a high expected EIRR of 34%. However, because a number of economic \nbenefits of CDC are hard to quantify, certain benefits are likely to have been underestimated. \n\nConclusions \n\n \n \n\n\f72 \n\n \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n  \n \n\nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n  Yes \n    No \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n Yes \n  No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam: \nProgress  toward  poverty  reduction  has  occurred  in  provinces  along  and  adjoining  the  East\u2013West  (Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic [Lao PDR] and Viet Nam) and Phnom Penh\u2013Ho Chi Minh City (Cambodia and Viet Nam) corridors, \nand along the Mekong River connecting northern Cambodia with southern Lao PDR. The health status of populations in \nthe border areas of these provinces has lagged behind the status achieved in urban areas. Many people still have limited \naccess  to  health  care,  belong  to  vulnerable  ethnic  minorities,  and  cannot  afford  basic  health  services.  While  these \ncorridors help increase connectivity and economic growth through trade and tourism, transport corridors also facilitate the \nspread of communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS and avian influenza in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS).  \n \nThe Project will help contain the spread of emerging and epidemic diseases and reduce the burden of common endemic \ndiseases  in  Cambodia,  Lao  PDR,  and  Viet  Nam  by  15%  of  the  current  disability-adjusted  life  year  (DALY)  by \n(i) strengthening  national  surveillance  and  response  systems,  (ii)  improving  communicable  disease  control  (CDC)  for \nvulnerable  groups,  and  (iii)  strengthening  regional  cooperation.  The  Project  will  help  minimize  the  social  and  economic \nimpact of communicable diseases, and help the countries  progress toward their health-related Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) for 2015 of reducing under-5 mortality rates and containing, as far as possible, the spread  of HIV/AIDS. \nThe Project will also focus its investment in border areas and along economic corridors where communities have little or \nno access to health care. \n\nTargeting Classification: Targeted intervention \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \nCambodia. In 1993\u20131999, Cambodia experienced a reduction in poverty  from 39% to 36%. Estimates show that about \n15\u201320% of the population lives in extreme poverty. Poverty in Cambodia is concentrated in rural and remote areas. The \npoverty  rate  in  urban  areas  is  estimated  at  29.7%  compared  with  40.1%  in  rural  areas.  Poverty  is  due  to  a  number  of \nfactors,  including  the  limited  sources  of  economic  growth,  exclusion  of  the  poor  from  the  mainstream  economy,  limited \naccess to and poor quality of social services, unavailability of credit, and lack of productive assets and resources (e.g., \nland,  forestry,  and  fisheries).  A  number  of  indigenous  hill  tribe  groups,  primarily  located  in  Ratanakiri  and  Mondulkiri \nprovinces, are among the poorest and most vulnerable segments of Cambodia\u2019s population. \n \nLao PDR. Poverty incidence fell from 45% in 1992\u20131993 to 30% by 2002\u20132003. The sharp reduction in poverty incidence \nwas  associated  with  consecutive  years  of  strong  economic  growth,  achievement  of  rice  self-sufficiency,  and  increased \ncross-border trade. However, poverty levels differ between urban and rural areas, and regionally across the country. For \ninstance,  the  northern  part  of  the  Lao  PDR  has  a  poverty  incidence  of  about  52%.  By  focusing  primarily  on  the  poor \nnorthern  provinces  and  the  GMS  East\u2013West  Economic  Corridor,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  emphasizes \ndevelopment opportunities from cross-border trade and movement and the importance of the private sector along border \nareas and key economic corridors. \n \nViet Nam. Data from the 2002 Multipurpose Household Survey confirmed a continuing decline in the incidence of poverty, \nfrom 58% in 1993 to 29% in 2002. The decline in the last 5 years was not uniform across the country: poverty dropped \nmost sharply in the Mekong Delta area (from 37% in 1998 to 23%) but remained highest in the Central Highlands (about \n52%). The underdeveloped state of infrastructure in poor regions causes the gap between them and other regions in the \ncountry  to  widen.  High  and  stable  economic  growth  in  the  past  several  years  has  been  a  major  contributor  to  poverty \nreduction, but the benefits from economic growth have not been evenly distributed. \n \nThe Project will focus on surveillance and response and control of selected diseases, which will mainly benefit the poor \nand other vulnerable groups. These groups suffer from a higher burden of disease, particularly communicable diseases, \nand have limited access to both public and private health services. At least 47% of the project benefits will accrue to the \npopulation  living  below  the  poverty  line.  Ethnic  minorities  in  the  three  countries  will  benefit  from  the  Project's  focus  on \nremote  areas  and  its  commitment  to  train  local  health  workers  and  community  volunteers.  Targeted  surveillance  and \nresponse,  along  with  targeted  control  of  endemic  diseases,  will  reduce  the  burden  of  communicable  diseases  and \ngenerate economic benefits as follows: (i) increased health awareness will lead to improvements in health, which in turn \nwill  significantly  decrease  out-of-pocket  health  expenditures;  (ii)  improved  health  services  for  infants  and  children  will \nreduce the number of sick children, thereby improving school attendance and overall physical and cognitive development; \nand  (iii)  strengthened  disease  surveillance  and  response  systems  will  help  avoid  costs  associated  with  outbreaks  (e.g., \nthe avian influenza outbreak is estimated to have cost the Mekong countries about $563 million since 2003).  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n73\n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nA stakeholder analysis helped to identify key project stakeholders, their Project-related interests, and the ways in which \nthey affect project feasibility and success. This  was especially important in identifying potential activities (e.g., technical \nforums) aimed at strengthening regional cooperation in CDC among the GMS countries. Primary institutional stakeholders \nare the ministries of health (MOHs), line ministries, development partners, and mass organizations. Local communities, \nespecially  village  health  volunteers,  will  be  highly  involved  through  training,  reporting,  and  the  implementation  of \ninformation, education, and communication activities. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \nA  participation  strategy  is  integrated  into  the  overall  project  design.  During  project  design,  MOHs  carried  out  initial \nconsultations  with  different  stakeholders  and  held  three  regional  workshops.  The  involvement  of  stakeholders  will \ncontinue  during  project  implementation.  Collaboration  with  other  departments  within  MOH  and  line  ministries  will  be \nimportant  in  coordinating  efforts  and  avoiding  duplication  of  information,  education,  and  communication  materials  for \ncommunicable  diseases.  Local  health  workers  and  community  volunteers  will  be  trained  to  implement  project  activities, \nand their involvement will complement CDC efforts at the community level.  \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No \n\nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nWomen  in  Cambodia,  Lao  PDR,  and  Viet  Nam,  especially  ethnic  minority  women,  remain  particularly  vulnerable  to \npoverty. Cambodia has among the lowest levels of gender equity in Asia as measured by the gender-related development \nindex (0.557) and the gender empowerment index (0.364). Rural and ethnic minority women in these countries carry out \nmore than half of total agricultural production, as well as the additional workload around the home. Women workers earn \nconsiderably  less  than  male  workers,  and  women  consistently  consume  fewer  calories  than  males,  as  indicated  by  the \nhigher malnutrition, mortality, and morbidity rates for girls and women than for males.  \n \nMaternal  and  child  mortality  in  the  region  is  high,  but  most  of  the  primary  causes  are  preventable.  Acute  respiratory \ninfections, infectious diarrhea, and parasitic diseases are significant causes of morbidity and mortality among women and \nchildren.  A  lack  of  awareness  of  CDC  and  low-quality  health  services  disproportionately  affect  the  poor  and  vulnerable \ngroups, including ethnic minorities. Poor women are particularly vulnerable to sexual exploitation.  \n \nA gender analysis was conducted during project preparation to ensure that gender concerns in CDC were identified and \naddressed  in  the  overall  project  design.  A  gender  action  plan  (GAP)  with  monitoring  indicators  has  been  developed  to \nensure that gender-related health issues were integrated into the implementation of the regional project. Country-specific \nGAPs  based  on  the  project  GAP  will  be  prepared  during  implementation  with  monitoring  indicators  refined  for  each \ncountry. National social development specialists will be recruited to assist the project management unit in each country in \npreparing, implementing, and monitoring specific GAPs. The GAP is found in Appendix 15. \nHas an output been prepared? \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\nE.

The EMDP ensures \ncompliance with the Policy on Indigenous Peoples of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and \ncurrent government regulations in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam.  \n \nA. \n \n2. \nIn  Cambodia,  about  10%  of  the  population  can  be  classified  as  ethnic  minorities. \nIndigenous groups  (or  hill  tribe  groups)  are  concentrated  in  the  four  northeastern provinces  of \nRattanakiri (66% of the population in these provinces, Mondolkiri (71%), Stung Treng (7%), and \nKratie  (8%).  These  populations  are  among  the  poorest  and  most  vulnerable  groups  in \nCambodia  and  live  in  physical  and  cultural  isolation.  In  the  Lao  PDR,  there  are  officially  46 \nethnic groups that live mainly in the northern region of the country near borders. Ethnic minority \ngroups  compose  about  32%  of  the  Lao  PDR  population.  Larger  ethnic  groups  include  the \nHmong,  Khmu,  Phutai,  Kor,  and  Katu.  In  Viet  Nam,  there  are  officially  54  ethnic  groups \nbelonging to different family and language groups composing 14% of the total population. They \nare  spread  out  over  45  provinces  and  live  mainly  in  mountainous  areas.  About  31  ethnic \nminority  groups  live  mainly  in  the  Northern  Uplands  and  about  19  ethnic  minority  groups  live \nmainly in the Central Highlands.  \n \nB. \n \nIn  the  three  countries,  the  infant  and  child  mortality  rates  and  maternal  mortality  ratios \n3. \nare generally higher in the provinces with a high proportion of ethnic minorities. Ethnic minorities \nin all three countries suffer more often from common infectious diseases than the majority ethnic \ngroups.  These  diseases  include  diarrheal  diseases,  acute  respiratory  infections,  tuberculosis, \nmalaria,  measles,  and  other  infections  often  associated  with  poor  living  conditions  and \nmalnutrition.  Minority  peoples  are  also  at  special  risk  of \nthe  human \nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV) because of lack of access to education, poverty, lack of culturally \nappropriate  information  in  their  own  languages,  cultural  and  social  breakdown  within  some \ncommunities,  nontraditional  drug  use,  and  a  relatively  high  involvement  in  the  sex  trade  and \nother  forms  of  exploited  labor.  However,  they  are  at  less  risk  of  dengue  and  other  emerging \ndiseases, which are more common in the lowlands (Appendix 3). \n \nCambodia\u2019s northeastern provinces have a higher incidence of infectious diseases than \n4. \nother provinces. In Lao PDR, where more than 90% of births occur at home in the presence of a \nrelative or a traditional birth attendant, about 60% of all maternal deaths occur during childbirth. \nIn Viet Nam, the infant mortality rate has dropped, from 90 per 1,000 live births in 1980 to 36 per \n1,000  live  births  in  1996  (Appendix  3).  But  the  rate  is  higher  in  the  Northern  Uplands  (52  per \n1,000 live births in 1996) and Central Highlands (55 per 1,000 live births in 1996). Poverty and \nimbalanced economic growth contribute to poor nutrition and high child mortality and morbidity \nrates.  Similarly,  maternal  mortality  has  been  reported  at  almost  160  per  100,000  live  births  in \nrural  areas  and  nearly  four  times  higher  in  remote  mountainous  areas.  Common  causes  of \nmaternal  death  are  hemorrhage,  pre-eclampsia,  malaria,  sepsis  resulting  from  abortion,  and \nobstructed labor causing the uterus to rupture.  \n\nHealth Challenges of Ethnic Groups \n\ninfection  with \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 16 \n\n79\n\nAccess to Health Care \n\nLegal Frameworks and Principles \n\nC. \n \n5. \nHygienic  living  conditions  and  basic  preventive  and  curative  care  can  address  most \ninfections,  malnutrition,  and  maternal  complications.  However,  ethnic  minorities  have  less \nphysical, social, and financial access to health care because of their isolation. Prenatal care and \nservices to handle complicated births are often not available in remote rural settings. Rural and \nethnic  minority  women  rarely  have  any  form  of  antenatal  care,  in  part  because  of  cultural \ninhibitions  and  language  barriers.  Ethnic  minority  women  often  do  not  use  health  services \nbecause of their (perceived) high cost. Many are very poor and lack cash.  \n \nD. \n \nEach Government has a clear legal framework and set of principles in support of ethnic \n6. \nminorities.  Cambodia\u2019s  Rectangular  Strategy \n(2004\u20132008),  Second  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment  Plan  (2001\u20132005),  and  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  (2003\u20132005) \nemphasize  equity  and  social justice  for  everyone,  including  ethnic  minorities.  In  the  Lao  PDR, \nrecent laws and decisions reflect ethnic concerns in the development process in all sectors. The \nNational  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan  (2001\u20132005)  has  adopted  as  its  objective  the \nalleviation of poverty for ethnic groups in remote areas. The Constitution highlights the right of \nethnic groups to protect, preserve, and promote their customs, and prohibits acts of division and \ndiscrimination  (Article  8).  Viet  Nam\u2019s  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy \n(2001\u20132010)  deals  directly  with  issues  of  gender  and  ethnic  minorities.  The  Government \nrecognizes  ethnic  minorities  as  poor  and  underprivileged  groups.  Current  government  policies \nand programs aim to enhance the health status of ethnic minorities. The Central Party Executive \nCommittee  Directive  N06-CT/TW  (2002)  provides  guidelines  for  the  Ministry  of  Health  to \nformulate  polices  with  priority  given  to  people  in  remote  and  mountainous  areas,  especially \nethnic minorities.  \n \nE. \n \n7. \nThe Project has three components: (i) strengthening national surveillance and response \nsystems;  (ii)  improving  provincial  CDC  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable,  in  particular  women, \nchildren, and ethnic minorities; and (iii) strengthening regional cooperation in CDC.  \n \n8. \nThree  subcomponents  of  the  Project  provide  special  focus  on  vulnerable  groups \nincluding  ethnic  minorities:  (i)  a  community-based  surveillance  and  response  system  that  will \naim to reach remote living populations, to achieve timely control of epidemics like malaria and \nmeasles, but also avian influenza, encephalitis, and other epidemics; (ii) improved CDC in these \npopulations  as  a  result  of  better  access  to  promotive,  preventive,  and  basic  curative \ninterventions  through  village  health  workers;  and  (iii)  HIV/AIDS  control  through  behavioral \nchange and communication among high-risk groups, including ethnic minorities, in \u201chot spots.\u201d   \n \nF. \n \nADB  policy  aims  to  protect  ethnic  minorities  from  the  adverse  effects  of  development \n9. \nand  to  ensure  that  ethnic  minorities  benefit  from  development  projects  and  programs.  The \nProject will create favorable conditions for better surveillance and response, improved access to \ncommunicable  disease  services,  and  more  effective  subregional  collaboration  for  better \nresponse to and preparedness for pandemic outbreaks. The EMDP for the Project is based on \ngovernment guidelines in the countries and ADB policy on indigenous peoples. It proposes two \n\nEthnic Minority Development Plan \n\nThe Project \n\n\f80 \n\n \n\nAppendix 16 \n\navenues  for  improving  CDC  for  vulnerable  populations:  village-based  health  care  and \ncommunity-based action for CDC.  \n \n10. \nVillage-Based Health Care. To give remote communities better access to health care, \nthe  Project  will  improve  village-based  health  care  by  training  village  workers  from  ethnic \nminorities.  These  workers  will  carry  out  health  promotion  and  prevention  campaigns  including \nthose for avian influenza and HIV/AIDS, provide basic treatment, and improve preparedness for \ncommon  emergencies.  For  each  ethnic  group,  specific  cultural  issues  will  be  identified  at  the \nlocal level and incorporated in the local design to make services more acceptable. Materials and \ntraining programs will be designed to take into account the level of education and language of \nthe  target  groups.  Revolving  funds  for  drugs  will  be  set  up  at  the  village  level,  where  this  is \nfeasible. These funds could also be used to improve water and sanitation coverage and other \nlocally identified activities for disease prevention and control.  \n \n11. \nCommunity-Based  Action  for  CDC.  The  Project  will  also  explore  community-\nmobilization for CDC. It will develop a participation strategy appropriate for ethnic minorities to \nimprove surveillance and response at the community level, and to improve control of endemic \ndiseases, by mobilizing leadership and mass organization, and providing demonstration models.  \n \nG. \n \n12. \nThe  Project  will  help  improve  the  health  of  the  population  in  the  targeted  provinces, \npromote  progress  toward  the  health-related  Millennium  Development  Goals,  and  intensify \nintergovernmental cooperation to contain diseases and strengthen national health systems. The \nProject design fully integrates the health needs of vulnerable groups, including ethnic minorities \nat  the  community  level.  Specific  activities  focus  on  primary  health  care  in  remote  areas,  and \nthese consist of community-based interventions.  \n \nThe  following  specific  measures  will  be  adopted  in  country-specific  plans  to  integrate \n13. \nethnic  minority  issues  in  regional,  national,  and  local  CDC  interventions.  Monitoring  indicators \nspecific to each country will be developed during implementation.  \n\nProject Benefits  \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nData on the incidence of diseases, by gender and by ethnicity, will be collected to \nstrengthen surveillance systems. \nSurveys  conducted  will  include  culturally  appropriate  questions,  and  specific \nquestions pertaining to CDC health needs and ethnic minorities.  \n\n(iv) \n\n(iii)  Provincial preventive health plans will include specific actions for addressing the \npreventive  health  needs  of  ethnic  minority  groups.  Provinces  with  a  high \npopulation of ethnic minorities will be given at least an equal share in provincial \nfunds. \nInformation,  education,  and  communication  materials  and  behavioral  change \ncommunication activities will be developed for vulnerable groups, including ethnic \nminorities.  Guidelines  and  training  materials  will  consider  traditional  health \npractices, and the cultural, educational, and linguistic needs of ethnic minorities \nin the targeted provinces. \nSpecific  activities  in  \u201chot  spots\u201d  will  be  culturally  appropriate  to  cross-border \npopulations,  will  capture  the  health-seeking  behaviors  and  attitudes  of  ethnic \ngroups,  and  will \nfrom  similar  ethnic \nbackgrounds. \n\ntrain  and  employ  health  workers \n\n(v) \n\n(vi)  Policies  and  practices  related  to  border  quarantine  will  consider  the  needs  of \n\ncross-border populations (e.g., ethnic minority groups and migrants).  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 16 \n\n81\n\n(vii)  To  share  information  with  GMS  countries  that  are  not  included  in  the  Project, \neach regional technical forum will include discussions about issues pertaining to \nCDC  among  ethnic  minority  and  vulnerable  groups,  including  updates  on  any \nassociated activities. \n(viii)   Proposals  submitted \n\nfor  HIV/AIDS  and \nfor  regional  operations  research \ninstitutional linkages should clearly illustrate the impact of the proposed research \non the health needs of ethnic groups, classified by gender where appropriate.   \n\n \nImplementation Arrangements \n\nH. \n \n14. \nThe  implementation  arrangements  and  estimated  costs  of  the  EMDP  have  been \nintegrated  into  the  overall  arrangements  and  total  budget  of  the  Project.  The  project \nmanagement unit in each country will supervise the implementation of the EMDP, and national \ninstitutes and provincial preventive health offices involved in the Project will implement the plan. \nThree national social development specialists, one for each country, will be hired for 18 person-\nmonths each during the Project. Each social development specialist will help develop country-\nspecific implementation guidelines to integrate the specific measures set out in the EMDP. The \nspecialist  will  work  with  the  regional  international  technical  experts  to  adapt  and  integrate  the \nEMDP into project activities for each country.  Measures and targets will be integrated into the \nassessment of preventive health needs, the preparation of provincial health plans, and training \nactivities (including the training of trainers) in each province.  \n \n15. \nThe  monitoring  of  the  EMDP  is  part  of  the  overall  project  performance  monitoring  and \nevaluation  system.  The  three  national  social  development  specialists  will  help  the  project \nmanagement  unit  establish  project  indicators  for  the  effective  monitoring  and  evaluation  of \nproject  activities \nin  each  country.  Ethnic  minorities  will  be  consulted  during  project \nimplementation to ensure that the project interventions consider adequately the needs of ethnic \nminority  groups  and  that  these  groups  share  proportionately  in  project  benefits.  Each  project \nmanagement  unit  will  consolidate  quarterly  updates  from  provinces  on  the  progress  of  the \nEMDP  implementation.  Progress  reports  will  include  updates  on  ethnic  minorities,  and  the \nmidterm  review  will  pay  special  attention  to  the  effects  of  the  Project  on  ethnic  minority  and \nother  vulnerable  groups.  Adjustments  will  be  made,  if  necessary,  during  the  Project  to  better \nmeet the health needs of ethnic minorities in communicable disease control. \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 14 October 2005) \n", "Cambodia \n", "Currency Unit\nKR1.00\n$1.00\n", "riel (KR) \n$0.000243 \nKR4,120 \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", "Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \n", "Currency Unit\nKN1.00\n$1.00\n", "kip (KN) \n$0.000092 \nKN10,855 \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", "Currency Unit\nD1.00\n$1.00\n", "dong (D) \n$0.000063 \nD15,903 \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", " \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "Viet Nam \n", "ADB  \nAI \nAIDS \nAOP \nARI \nASEAN \nCDC \nCDCD \nCLV \nDHP \n", "DPB \n", "EIRR \nEMDP \nGDP \nGMS \nHIV \nHRD \nHSSP \nIA \nIHR \nIMCI \nLao PDR \nMBDSP \nMDG \nMOH \nOECD \nPHC \nPMU \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n \nAsian Development Bank \navian influenza \nacquired immunodeficiency syndrome \nannual operational plan \nacute respiratory infection \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations \ncommunicable disease control \nCommunicable Disease Control Department, Cambodia \nCambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, and Viet Nam \nDepartment  of  Hygiene  and  Prevention,  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic \nDepartment of Planning and Budgeting, Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic \neconomic internal rate of return \nethnic minority development plan \ngross domestic product \nGreater Mekong Subregion \nhuman immunodeficiency virus \nhuman resource development \nhealth sector support program \nimplementing agency \ninternational health regulations \nintegrated management of childhood illnesses \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \nMekong Basin Disease Surveillance Program \nMillennium Development Goal \nMinistry of Health \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development \nprimary health care \nproject management unit \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", "PPTA \nPRC \nRCU \nRPG \nSARS \nSC \nSGIA \nTA \nVAPM \nWHO \nWPRO \n", "project preparatory technical assistance \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \nregional coordination unit \nregional public good \nsevere acute respiratory syndrome \nsteering committee \nsecond-generation imprest account \ntechnical assistance \nViet Nam Administration of Preventive Medicine \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  World Health Organization \n\u2013  Western Pacific Regional Office, World Health Organization \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal years (FY) of the Governments of Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic, and Viet Nam end on 31 December. \n", "(ii) \n", "In this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars. \n", "The report was prepared by V. de Wit (team leader, senior health specialist), J.
