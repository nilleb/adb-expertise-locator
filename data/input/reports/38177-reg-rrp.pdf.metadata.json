Demonstrating  ADB\u2019s  long-term \nengagement  in  the  sector,  the  Project  will  reinforce  the  ongoing \ncustoms  legal  and  institutional  reforms  supported  by  the  program \nloans,  and  strengthen  the  two  countries\u2019  participation  in  regional \ncustoms cooperation.  \n \nThe  Project  comprises  two  components  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic \nand  Tajikistan  to  develop  (i)  a  unified  automated  information \nsystem (UAIS), and (ii) customs border-post infrastructure. \n \nThis  first  component  consists  of  three  interrelated  subcomponents \nto  (i)  develop  core  UAIS  application  systems  and  associated \ncommunications \noperations-support \ninfrastructure \nto  support  UAIS  operation  (i.e.,  provide  and \nstrengthen  communication  links  between  customs  headquarters, \nregional customs offices, and border posts), and (iii) train staff and \ndevelop a public awareness campaign to ensure sustainability and \nbroad-based support for customs modernization. \n \nThe  second  component  aims  to  (i)  improve  customs  border  posts \nand  facilities,  (ii)  provide  customs  operations  and  antismuggling \nequipment,  and  (iii)  extend  capacity  building  and  promote  border \ninteragency cooperation. \n\nsystems, \n\ndevelop \n\n(ii) \n\n\f \n\n \n\nRationale \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\niii \n \n \n\nin \n\ntrade \n\nfacilitation \n\nSince  independence  in  1991,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan \nhave  been  in  transition  to  private  sector-led  and  market-oriented \neconomies.  Since  both  countries  are  highly  dependent  on \ninternational  trade,  development  of  an  outward-oriented  trading \nenvironment is an integral part of the transition strategy. Significant \nprogress  has  been  made  in  trade  liberalization  and  trade-related \npolicy  reforms  in  both  countries  as  evidenced  by  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization in 1998 and \nTajikistan\u2019s preparatory progress in this regard.  \n \nProgress \nis  equally  significant  and  has \neffectively  complemented  trade  policy  reforms.  As  tariffs  have \ncome  down,  trade  facilitation  in  terms  of  reducing  government \nbureaucracy, and harmonizing and automating trade procedures is \nwidely  recognized  as  just  as  important  as  trade  liberalization \nmeasures.  Of  all  the  agencies  relevant  to  trade  facilitation  and \nborder controls, customs administration is commonly recognized as \none  of  the  most  important  because  of  its  border  control  functions, \nrevenue  collection,  and  prevention  of  smuggling  and  drug \ntrafficking. \n \nThe customs administrations of the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan \nare relatively young, with weak institutional capacity, low efficiency, \nand poor governance. To address these weaknesses, in 2002 both \ncountries  launched  comprehensive  modernization  programs  to \nfacilitate  trade  and  thus  reduce  the  most  critical  bottleneck. \nSupported  by  ADB  and  other  major \nfinancial \ninstitutions,  both  countries  adopted  a  comprehensive  program  of \nreforms and modernization consisting of (i) improving the customs \nlegal and regulatory framework, (ii) strengthening governance and \ninstitutional  capacity,  (iii)  promoting  regional  customs  cooperation, \nand  (iv)  developing  customs  infrastructure  to  improve  operational \nefficiency and revenue collection.  \n \nSignificant  progress  has  been  made,  particularly  with  legal  and \ninstitutional  reforms,  and  strengthening  of  cooperation  with  the \ncustoms  administrations  of  neighboring  countries.  However,  the \nbenefits  of  customs  legal  and  institutional  reforms  and  regional \ncustoms  cooperation  initiatives  cannot  be  fully  realized,  unless \nthere is commensurate development and modernization of customs \nphysical  infrastructure  to  improve  efficiency  and  transparency  of \ncustoms services. The Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan do not have \nadequate information and communication technology infrastructure \nto support automated customs services. The border-post conditions \nare poor because of inadequate budget support and the effects of \nthe civil war in Tajikistan.  \n \n \n\ninternational \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nObjectives \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\nThe Project is directly relevant to ADB\u2019s strategic objectives in the \ntwo  countries.  The  overall  objective  of  the  Country  Strategy  and \nProgram  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  for  2004\u20132006  is  to  reduce \npoverty  by  promoting  private  sector-led  economic  growth  and \nproviding selective support for human development. ADB supports \nprivate sector-led economic growth through (i) agriculture and rural \ndevelopment,  (ii)  financial  sector  development,  and  (iii)  regional \ncooperation with an emphasis on trade and transport infrastructure. \nThe  Country  Strategy  and  Program  for  Tajikistan  for  2004\u20132008 \nfocuses on promoting economic growth through rural development \nand regional cooperation. \n \nTrade facilitation is a strategic pillar of ADB\u2019s Regional Cooperation \nStrategy  and  Program  for  2005\u20132007  and  the  Project  is  a  priority \nproject. ADB supports trade facilitation by helping to (i) modernize \ncustoms  infrastructure,  including  customs  legal  and  physical \ninfrastructure;  (ii)  develop  customs-supporting  infrastructure  by \nfostering  customs  intermediaries  and  their  associations  (such  as \nbrokers\u2019  associations);  and \nregional  customs \ncooperation to address issues of common concerns (e.g., regional \ntransit development), and complement country-specific support. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  objectives  are  to  (i)  improve  the  efficiency  and \ntransparency  of  customs  services,  and  reinforce  the  ongoing \ncustoms legal reforms and simplification of custom procedures; and \n(ii)  facilitate  trade  and  promote  regional  customs  cooperation \nthrough concerted customs reforms and modernization in the East \nand Central Asian region. \n \nThe total project cost is estimated at $22.75 million equivalent. The \nKyrgyz  component  is  estimated  to  cost  $9.37  million  equivalent \n(foreign  exchange  cost  of  $4.83  million  and  local  currency  cost  of \nis \n$4.54  million  equivalent),  and \nestimated to cost $13.38 million equivalent (foreign exchange cost \nof $8.42 million and local currency cost of $4.96 million equivalent). \n \n($ million) \n \nPercent \n \n\n \nSource \nKyrgyz Republic \n\nthe  Tajikistan  component \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nTotal \nCost \n \n\n(iii)  support \n\n \n\n \n\nADB \nGovernment  \n   Total \n \nTajikistan \n\n4.83 \n0.00 \n4.83 \n \n \n\nADB \nGovernment  \n   Total \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \n\n8.42 \n0.00 \n8.42 \n\n \n\n2.67 \n1.87 \n4.54 \n \n \n\n2.28 \n2.68 \n4.96 \n\n7.50 \n1.87 \n9.37 \n \n \n\n10.70 \n2.68 \n13.38 \n\n80 \n20 \n100 \n \n \n\n80 \n20 \n100 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nLoan Amount and Terms \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nv \n \n\nLoans  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights \n(SDR)  5,106,000  ($7.5  million  equivalent)  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic \nand  SDR7,266,000  ($10.7  million  equivalent)  for  Tajikistan  will  be \nprovided from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources.

Each  government  will \nestablish a project steering committee (PSC) before or immediately \nafter \nthe  overall  direction  and \nto  guide \ncoordinate  issues  related  to  project  implementation.  In  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic,  the  PSC  will  be  headed  by  the  chair  of  Committee  for \nRevenues  and  include  the  CSD  head  and  deputy  head.  In \nTajikistan,  the  PSC  will  be  chaired  by  the  MSRD  minister  and \ninclude the CSD head and deputy head. Both PSCs will comprise \nrepresentatives  from  relevant  Government  agencies  and  private \nsector. \n \nThe  chair  of  the  Committee  for  Revenues  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic \nand  the  MSRD  minister  in  Tajikistan  will  be  designated  as  the \nproject directors with overall responsibility for project management. \nEach  project  director  will  appoint  a  senior  CSD  staff  member  as \ndeputy  project  director.  To  oversee  day-to-day  project \nimplementation,  a  full-time  project  management  office  (PMO)  will \nbe set up within the Committee for Revenues for the Kyrgyz project \nand the CSD for the Tajikistan project component. The PMO will be \nheaded by a qualified PMO director and deputy director assisted by \na  group  of  qualified  technical  and  administrative  specialists.  The \nPMO  will \nthroughout  project \nimplementation  and  be  assisted  by  international  and  domestic \nconsultants financed by the loan and the accompanying TA. \n \n\nremain  adequately  staffed \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \n\nExecuting Agency \n\n \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAll services, supplies, and equipment to be financed by ADB will be \nprocured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement. \nEquipment and materials for packages valued at $500,000 or more \nwill  be  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding.  Supply \ncontracts  and  items  costing  less  than  $500,000  will  be  procured \nusing  international  shopping.  Equipment  and  materials  costing \n$100,000 or less will be procured through direct purchase.  \n \nCivil works contracts estimated at $1 million equivalent or more will \nbe  carried  out  by  prequalified  contractors  using  international \ncompetitive bidding, while those valued below $1 million equivalent \nwill  use  local  competitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB. \nForce account, with an upper limit of $50,000 per package, will be \napplied to border-post infrastructure development. \n \n\nfirm(s)  of \n\nThe  consultants  will  be  engaged  either  as  individuals,  and/or \ninternational  consultants  with  domestic \nconsulting \nassociates  to  be  selected  following  the  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection method, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants. The implementing agencies and ADB have agreed \nthat  most  of  the  consultants  will  be  hired  through  firms.  Domestic \nconsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The  Kyrgyz  component  will \nrequire  about  20  person-months  of  international  and  45  person-\nthe  Tajikistan \nmonths  of  domestic  consulting  services;  and \ncomponent,  24  person-months  of  international  and  52  person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nvii \n \n \n\nThe Project is expected to have an economic internal rate of return \nof 21.50% for the Kyrgyz component and 23.34% for the Tajikistan \ncomponent. The main benefits accruing include economic benefits \nfrom  (i)  trade  expansion  and  associated  economic  growth  and \nemployment  generation,  and  (ii)  efficiency  gains  from  reduced \ntransaction costs and waiting times at border crossings and inland \nclearance points. The Project will have a positive impact on overall \neconomic development because trade is an engine for growth and \ncustoms  services  modernization  is  key  for  facilitating  trade  and \nimproving the enabling environment for private sector-led economic \ndevelopment.  \n \nThe  Project  will  have  a  positive  regional  impact  by  (i)  improving \ntransit conditions of the two countries, greatly facilitating trade with \nneighboring  countries,  (ii)  contributing  to  the  improvement  of  the \noverall  trading  and  investment  environment  in  the  region  through \nstrengthened regional customs cooperation for trade facilitation and \nprevention of smuggling and drug trafficking.  \n \nReduced  transaction  costs  make  trade  in  small  volumes  possible \nand  therefore  directly  benefit  poor  and  small  traders.  The  overall \nsocial  benefit  derives  from  increased  revenue  collection  that \ncontributes  to  sound  fiscal  management  and  provision  of  social \nservices.  \n \n\nThe  governments  are  fully  committed  to  customs  modernization \nand  trade  facilitation  thus  mitigating  the  risk  of  lack  of  political \ncommitment  for  customs  reform  and  modernization.  The  adoption \nof  the  revised  customs  codes  provides  the  legal  foundation  for \nsimplifying  customs  procedures,  and  automating  and  applying \nthese at border posts. Project-specific risks may include (i) lack of \ncommitment  to  change  management,  and  resistance  from  vested \ninterest groups that benefit from lack of transparency and inefficient \ncustoms  clearance  systems, \nlack  of  consultation  and \ncooperation  with  the  trade  community  and  relevant  government \nagencies,  (iii)  the  implementing  agencies\u2019  difficulty  recruiting  and \nretaining  competent  and  experienced \ntechnology \npersonnel,  and  (iv)  inadequate  budget  provision  for  maintenance \nand  following  phases  of  customs  modernization.  These  risks  are \nmitigated  by  the  ongoing  measures  adopted  by  the  two  countries\u2019 \nexecuting  agencies,  the  project  and  TA  design,  and  government \nassurances. \n \n\ninformation \n\n(ii) \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n \n\n\fviii \n\n \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\n \n\nthe \n\nis  supported  by \n\nTwo accompanying grant-financed TAs will be provided; one each \nto  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  to  help  ensure  that  (i) \nthrough  automation  and  border-post \ncustoms  modernization \ninfrastructure  development \ninstitutional \nstructure  and  the  business  processes  of  the  CSDs,  and  (ii)  the \nUAIS  and  border-post  infrastructure  development  are  carried  out \nwith sound supervision and quality assurance. Each TA consists of \nthree  components:  (i)  change  management  and  public-private \npartnership \nfor  customs  modernization,  (ii)  reengineering  of \ncustoms  business  processes,  and  (iii)  quality  and  security \nassurance of the UAIS and border-post infrastructure development. \n \nEach  TA  is  expected  to  cost  $600,000  equivalent,  comprising \n$400,000  in  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $200,000  equivalent  in \nlocal  currency  cost.  ADB  will  provide  the  TAs  on  a  grant  basis, \n$500,000  each  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  from  the \nJapan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan,  to \nfinance  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $100,000  equivalent \nof  the  local  currency  cost.  The  Government  will  finance  the \nremaining $100,000 equivalent of local currency cost. \n \nThe  TAs  will  finance  14  person-months  of  international  consulting \nfor  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  12  person-months  for  Tajikistan,  and \n58  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  for  each  country.

The TA consultants will \nwork  closely  with  the  implementing  agencies,  relevant  agencies \nand  institutions,  the  PMO,  private  sector  stakeholders,  and  ADB \nstaff.  \n \n\ninternational  and  domestic  consultants \n\ninclude                   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  the  proposed \nloans  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan  for  the  Regional  Customs \nModernization  and  Infrastructure  Development  Project.  The  report  also  describes  proposed \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  Capacity  Building  and  Institutional  Strengthening  for  Customs \nModernization and Infrastructure Development in each of the Kyrgyz Republic and the Republic \nof  Tajikistan,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loans,  I,  acting  under  the  authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, will approve the TAs.  \n \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n2. \nRecognizing  the  importance  of  trade  for  countries\u2019  transition  to  a  market  economy  and \nprivate sector-led economic development, most of the Central Asian republics have embarked \non  comprehensive  trade  policy  reforms  and  trade  facilitation  measures  since  gaining \nindependence in the early 1990s. Due to their land-locked conditions, they rely on each other for \ntransit  trade;  the  benefits  of  trade  can  only  be  realized  through  concerted  regional  efforts  to \nimprove  the  trading  environment.  Such  a  concerted  effort  is  being  rigorously  pursued  by  the \nCentral Asian republics, as demonstrated by their (i) collective commitment to accession to the \nWorld  Trade  Organization  (WTO)  and  reform  of  trade  policies  according  to  WTO  rules  and \nagreements;  and  (ii)  concerted  efforts  to  reform  customs  codes  and  modernize  customs \nservices as key measures to facilitate trade.  \n \n3. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) plays a major role to provide support for a regional \nand  concerted  approach  for  trade  policy  reforms  and  trade  facilitation.  In  2002,  the  Regional \nTrade  Facilitation  and  Customs  Cooperation  Program  (RTFCCP)  was  launched  as  part  of  the \nbroad  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  Program.  The  RTFCCP  is  a \ncombination  of  support  for  (i)  bilateral  and  regional  customs  cooperation  initiatives,  and  (ii) \ncountry-specific activities with strong regional orientation. A key objective of the RTFCCP is to \npromote concerted customs reforms and modernization of the CAREC member countries in an \neffort to harmonize customs legal frameworks and procedures. To support the CAREC member \ncountries\u2019  accession  to  WTO  and  trade  policy  reforms,  a  trade  policy  committee  was  recently \ncreated as part of the CAREC Program to be coordinated by the International Monetary Fund. \nThe first trade policy committee meeting was conducted as part of the Senior Officials\u2019 Meeting \non  13\u201314  September  2004  in  preparation  for  the  Third  Ministerial  Conference  on  31  October \nand 1 November 2004.  \n \n4. \nThe  Project  is  a  continuation  of  ADB\u2019s  support  for customs reforms and modernization \nfor the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan following the launch of the RTFCCP.

The Project \nwill  support  the  implementation  of  the  two  countries\u2019  poverty  reduction  strategies  by  (i) \nimproving governance practices and (ii) promoting sustained economic growth. It will reinforce \nthe  ongoing  customs  legal  and  institutional  reforms  supported  by  the  program  loans,  and \nstrengthen the two countries\u2019 participation in regional customs cooperation activities supported \nby ADB. The Project Framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nSince independence in 1991, the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan have been in transition \n5. \nto  private  sector-led  and  market-oriented  economies.  Development  of  an  outward-oriented \ntrading  environment  is  an  integral  part  of  the  transition  strategy.  Both  countries  are  highly \ndependent  on  international  trade,  with  exports  in  2003  accounting  for  31%  of  gross  domestic \nproduct  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  57%  for  Tajikistan.  However,  the  two  countries\u2019  external \nsectors are vulnerable to changes in terms-of-trade due to the dominance of raw materials and \nagriculture  products  in  exports  and  the  narrow  production  base.  With  a  combination  of  trade \nliberalization and trade facilitation measures, the governments aim to diversify exports, broaden \nthe  production  base,  and  improve  the  enabling  environment  for  foreign  direct  investment  and \ntrade, including transit trade of neighboring countries. Recent economic development and sector \nanalysis are provided in Appendix 2.  \n \nSignificant  progress  has  been  made  in  trade  liberalization  and  trade-related  policy \n6. \nreforms in both countries. The Kyrgyz Republic became a WTO member in 1998 in recognition \nof  its  achievements  in  trade  and  trade-related  policy  reforms.  Tajikistan  is  in  the  advanced \nstages of WTO accession. The tariff structure is compliant with WTO\u2019s rules, with the adoption \nof a single tariff band of 5%, except for areas subject to preferential agreements and treaties. A \nwide  range  of  trade-related  policies  have  been  amended  in  conformity  with  the  relevant  WTO \nagreements, particularly in foreign direct investment policy and financial services liberalization. \n \nProgress  in  trade  facilitation  is  equally  significant  and  effectively  complements  trade \n7. \npolicy  reforms.  As  tariffs  have  come  down,  trade  facilitation  in  terms  of  reducing  government \nbureaucracy and harmonizing and automating trade procedures is widely recognized as just as \nimportant as trade liberalization measures. Among all the agencies relevant to trade facilitation \nand  border  controls,  the  customs  administration  is  commonly  recognized  as  one  of  the  most \nimportant,  because  of  its  revenue  collection  function  and  prevention  of  smuggling  and  drug \ntrafficking. \n \nThe  customs  administrations  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan\u2014the  customs \n8. \nservices  departments  (CSDs)\u2014are  relatively  young,  with  weak  institutional  capacity,  low \nefficiency,  and  poor  governance. \nlaunched  comprehensive \nmodernization programs to address this most critical bottleneck of trade facilitation.5 Supported \nby  major  international  financial  institutions,  both  countries  adopted  a  program  of  reforms \n                                                \n2   ADB.  2002.

ADB \nhas been supporting the reform agenda through a program loan for each country. By 24 June \n2004, the Kyrgyz Republic had complied with all six core conditions in the policy matrix for the \nsecond  tranche  release  of  the  program  loan,  and  six  of  the  eight  monitoring  conditions.  The \nsecond  tranche  was  released  on  15  September  2004.  Tajikistan  has  complied  with  five  of  the \neight core conditions, while the remaining three are expected to be complied with by the end of \nDecember 2004\u2014the target date for the second tranche release. The revised Customs Code of \nTajikistan  was  submitted  to  Parliament  on  30  September  2004  to  comply  with  a  major  core \ncondition.  Tajikistan\u2019s  CSD  is  also  actively  (i)  pursuing  a  transit  agreement  with  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic,  and  (ii)  facilitating  the  development  of  a  brokers\u2019  association  to  comply  with  the  two \nremaining  core  conditions.  CSD  has  also  made  considerable  progress  in  complying  with \nTajikistan\u2019s  24  monitoring  conditions.  A  description  of  major  accomplishments  of  the \ngovernments\u2019 reform programs follows.6 \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nGovernment Reform Program \n\nLegal  and  Regulatory  Framework.  The  main  focus  has  been  the  revision  of  the \n9. \nCustoms  Code.  The  Legislative  Chamber  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  Parliament  ratified  the  new \nCustoms  Code  on  13  April  2004,  and  the  Kyrgyz  President  approved  it  on  12  July  2004.  For \nTajikistan,  the  final  version  of  the  revised  Customs  Code  was  submitted  to  Parliament  on  30 \nSeptember  2004.  The  revised  customs  codes  have  two  important  features:  (i)  they  are  in  line \nwith  the  Revised  Kyoto  Convention,  which  serves  as  a  benchmark  for  reforms  and  customs \nmodernization  of  customs  administrations  worldwide;  and  (ii)  they  provide  detailed  regulations \nand  procedural  guidance  for  all  customs  control  regimes,  which  will  greatly  help  reduce  the \nnumber  of  existing  customs  regulations.  The  existence  of  multiple  customs  regulations  is  a \nmajor source of confusion, corruption, and tension between customs officers and traders during \ncustoms  clearance.  Simplification  of  the  existing  customs  regulations  and  procedures  is  a  key \nobjective  of  revising  the  customs  codes.  Concerted  customs  legal  reforms  in  line  with  the \ninternational  conventions  support  the  process  of  harmonizing  customs  procedures  in  the \nECAR\u2014a major RTFCCP initiative.  \n \n10. \nGovernance and Institutional Reform. The CSDs in both countries have implemented \nseveral  measures  to  enhance  staff  morale,  strengthen  internal  management,  and  reduce \ncorruption. Human resource management has significantly improved through the adoption of a \nstaff appraisal system that objectively evaluates staff performance, and a compensation system \nthat  responds  to  staff  evaluation  and  rewards  outstanding  performance.  To  reduce  corruption, \nboth  the  revised  customs  codes  and  codes  of  conduct  include  articles  and  regulations \nprohibiting  customs  officers  from  acting  as  customs  intermediaries.  To  improve  transparency \nand client-orientation of customs services, both the CSDs (i) maintain periodicals to inform the \npublic of customs statistics and legal and regulatory changes, (ii) maintain a consultative council \nto dialogue with traders and their representatives, and (iii) conduct regular surveys to strengthen \nclient  orientation  of  customs  services.  These  legal  and  personnel  measures  help  reduce \ncorruption and improve professionalism of customs officers.  \n \n\n                                                \n6   Two progress reports were prepared for the second tranche release of the program loans for the Kyrgyz Republic \n\nand Tajikistan.  \n\n\f 4\n\nRegional  Customs  Cooperation.7  The  launch  of  the  RTFCCP  has  significantly \n11. \nstrengthened the two countries\u2019 policy dialogue and cooperation with customs administrations of \nneighboring  countries.  The  customs  cooperation  activities  supported  by  the  regional  TA  is \ncoordinated and supervised by the Customs Cooperation Committee, comprising heads of the \ncustoms  departments  of  eight  ADB  developing  member  countries  in  the  ECAR,  including  the \nKyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan.  The  Customs  Cooperation  Committee  serves  as  an  effective \nforum  for  addressing  regional  issues  of  common  concern,  such  as  developing  transit \narrangements and sharing customs data to reduce corruption. Customs officials from the Kyrgyz \nRepublic  and  Tajikistan  cochair  the  transit  development  initiative,  and  are  actively  promoting \ntransit  agreements  initially  involving  Kazakhstan,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and  Tajikistan.  The \nKyrgyz  Republic  entered  into  a  transit  agreement  with  Kazakhstan  on  26  March  2004. \nSponsored  by  ADB,  the  customs  administrations  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan \nconducted two rounds of consultation on a draft transit agreement, and both parties agreed to \ntarget  the  signing  of  the  agreement  by  the  end  of  2004.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  also  making \nprogress  in  developing  a  data-sharing  agreement  with  the  customs  office  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China\u2014to be signed by the end of 2004. Tajikistan recently opened a new border \npost with the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n  \n12. \nDevelopment of Customs Physical Infrastructure. Development of customs physical \ninfrastructure  is  an  integral  part  of  government  efforts  to  facilitate  trade,  improve  revenue \ncollection,  reduce  corruption,  and  stop  smuggling  and  drug  trafficking.  Of  the  Customs \nCooperation  Committee  member  countries,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  have  the  least \ninfrastructure  capacity  in  terms  of  customs  automation  and  border-post  facilities,  because  of \ninadequate budget support and destruction during the civil war in the case of Tajikistan. Neither \ncountry  has  an  automated  customs  declaration  system  for  exports  and  imports.  Their  limited \ninformation  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  infrastructure  does  not  support  modern \ncustoms practices based on risk management and postentry audit as promulgated in the revised \nCustoms Code and the Revised Kyoto Convention.8 Without customs automation and adequate \nborder-post  infrastructure,  the  benefits  of  customs  legal  reforms  and  procedure  simplification \ncannot  be  fully  realized,  and  regional  customs  cooperation  initiatives  cannot  be  effectively \ncarried out. \n \nIn the Kyrgyz Republic, a local area network is only available in CSD headquarters and \n13. \ntwo regional customs offices. Servers and a limited number of computers are available at CSD \nheadquarters. Communication between the headquarters and the 15 regional customs offices is \nthrough  the  Government\u2019s  wide  area  network,  which  has  low  capacity  and  functions  poorly. \nNone of the border posts have communication facilities, resulting in delay of the submission of \ncustoms statistics to customs headquarters.  \n \n14. \nOf the five regional offices in Tajikistan, only one has telecommunications tools for data \nexchange  through  a  radio  communications  data-transfer  system.  Data  exchange  between \n\n                                                \n7  ADB.  2004.  Regional  Trade  Facilitation  and  Customs  Cooperation  Program,  Progress,  and  Future  Directions. \n\nManila. \n\n8 Risk management is a broadly recognized modern customs technique allowing customs to clear increasing volumes   \nof  goods,  while  minimizing  the  risk  of  not  detecting  wrongly  declared  transactions  as  well  as  those  covered  by \nfraudulent  documents.  Its  application  requires  establishment  of  risk  profiles  in  a  computer  system  that  contain \ninformation on the history of transactions of traders, origin, and route of their imports. Traders with \u201clow risk profile\u201d \nare distinguished from those with \u201chigh risk profiles\u201d allowing customs to facilitate traders with low risk profiles and \ndevote  more  resources  to  inspect  traders  with  high  risk  profiles.  Post-entry  audit  allows  customs  to  examine  the \nbook and records of traders especially those identified as high risk. It helps improve the risk profiles and strengthen \nthe risk management system.  \n \n\n\f  5\n\nborder posts and regional offices are carried out using floppy disks. A major source of revenue \nloss  and  corruption  at  border  posts  has  been  the  lack  of  technology  capacity  to  capture \nimporters\u2019  entry  data  for  customs  declaration  in  a  centralized  location  to  calculate  duties  and \ntaxes  and  validate  the  entry.  The  quality  of  customs  statistics  is  poor  and  cannot  be  readily \nverified  and  easily  distributed  to  the  relevant  Government  agencies  for  trade  facilitation  and \nantismuggling purposes.  \n \n15. \nThe border-post conditions in both countries are poor mainly due to inadequate budget \nprovision for construction and maintenance. Very few border posts have permanent structures \noriginally  designed \ninspection  and \nfor  customs  operations.  Customs  equipment \nantismuggling  purposes  is  rarely  present  or  operational.  Very  few  customs  posts  have \nequipment for weighing and preventing contraband and drug trafficking. At most border posts, \nelectricity  supply  is  unstable  and  at  best  provided  only  7-8  hours  a  day,  thus  increasing \nopportunities for illicit trade.  \n \n16. \nRecognizing these constraints and the need to modernize customs services to improve \ntransparency  and  fight  corruption,  both  governments  adopted  strategies  to  develop  a  unified \nautomated information system (UAIS). The UAIS as a development concept is embraced by all \nthe  customs  administrations  joining  the  RTFCCP  under  the  CAREC  Program.  It  includes  not \nonly developing software and hardware for automating customs declaration, but also introducing \nmodern  customs  techniques  (e.g.,  simplified  customs  procedures  and  a  risk  management \nsystem),  management  information  system,  change  management,  and  capacity  building  and \ninstitution building to ensure broad-based support and sustainability of the UAIS. The Project is \nan  important  step  in  helping  the  governments  realize  the  concept  of  the  UAIS  and  develop \nborder-post infrastructure.  \n \n\nfor \n\n2. \n\nThe Asian Development Bank Strategy \n\nThe  Project  is  directly  relevant  to  ADB\u2019s  strategic objectives for the two countries. The \n17. \noverall objective of the Country Strategy and Program for the Kyrgyz Republic (2004\u20132006) is to \nreduce  poverty,  supported  by  (i)  promotion  of  private  sector-led  economic  growth  and  (ii) \nselective support for human development. Regional cooperation with an emphasis on trade and \ntransport  infrastructure  is  a  priority  area  in  support  of  private  sector-led  development.  ADB\u2019s \nCountry  Strategy  and  Program  for  Tajikistan  (2004\u20132008)  focuses  on  promoting  economic \ngrowth through (i) rural development and (ii) regional cooperation.  \n \nTrade  facilitation  is  a  strategic  pillar  of  ADB\u2019s  Regional  Cooperation  Strategy  and \n18. \nProgram for 2005\u20132007 and the Project is a priority. ADB adopts a three-pronged strategy for \ntrade  facilitation  to  help  (i)  modernize  customs  infrastructure,  including  customs  legal  and \nphysical  infrastructure;  (ii)  develop  customs-supporting  infrastructure  by  fostering  customs \nintermediaries  and  their  associations,  such  as  brokers\u2019  associations;  and  (iii)  support  regional \ncustoms  cooperation  to  address  issues  of  common  concern  and  complement  country-specific \nsupport. \n \n\n3. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n \n19. \nKnowledge-sharing  is  the  main  activity  of  the  RTFCCP,  particularly  in  sharing  country \nexperience  and  lessons  learned  in  developing  the  UAIS  according  to  country  circumstances. \nSeveral  forums  focused  on  this  issue,  including  the  August  2003  seminar  in  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic;  and  the  April  2004  conference  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China.  Several  customs \nadministrations  in  the  ECAR  have  developed  or  are  planning  to  develop  their  own  UAIS. \n\n\f 6\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nNonetheless,  lessons  learned  were  gathered  not  only  from  ECAR  members,  but  from  other \ncountries  and  regions,  such  as  Australia,  the  Philippines,  and  member  countries  of  the \nEuropean Union (EU). \n \n20.   Major  lessons  learned  that  are  reflected  in  the  Project  and  TA  design  include  the \nfollowing: \n \n\nSequencing of modernization and procedure reengineering. At the Customs \nCooperation  Committee  Seminar  held  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  in  August  2003, \ncountry  representatives  developed  10  general  principles  for  applying  ICT  to \ncustoms  modernization.9  A  key  principle  is  that  countries  must  first  reform \ncustoms \nto  country  circumstances  and \ninternational  best  practices,  and  then  use  ICT  to  reinforce  the  reform  process. \nICT should not be used to reengineer poor and antiquated customs procedures \nin  the  hope  that  it  will  help  solve  inefficiency,  corruption,  and  other  problems. \nADB\u2019s support for customs legal and procedure reforms, followed by support for \ncustoms infrastructure development, is in line with this key lesson learned. \n\nlaws  and  procedures  according \n\nImportance  of  compatibility.  The  EU\u2019s  experience  with  integrating  national \nautomated  customs  information  systems  to  develop  the  newly  computerized \ntransit  system  shows  that  no  existing  ICT  system  is  ideal.  One  of  the  key \nattributes of the national systems is that they are compatible with each other and \ncan readily transfer data, taking into consideration international conventions such \nas  the  Revised  Kyoto  Convention  and  common  documentation  standards  such \nas  the  Single  Administrative  Document  administered  by  the  United  Nations \nEconomic Commission for Europe. \n\nPhased  rollout  and  development.  Customs  modernization  has  high  economic \nand  social  benefits,  but  is  a  long-term  and  costly  endeavor.  It  requires \ncomprehensive planning, with prioritization and sequencing of development and \nimplementation.  Experience  in  the  Philippines  shows  that  project  completion  in \ncomputerization does not mean the conclusion of the entire project. In fact, it is \nonly  a  milestone  to  mark  the  start  of  modernization.  Adequate  financial  support \nmust be provided for following phases of development to upgrade and maintain \nthe system, and keep up the momentum of customs modernization.  \n\nCapacity  building  and  human  resource  development.  Human  resource \ndevelopment is essential to maintain the newly developed or adopted system and \nconstantly  upgrade  and  adapt  it  to  the  country\u2019s  circumstances.  Computers  are \nonly tools; effective performance depends on the user\u2019s skills. Users must be well \ntrained  to  maintain  and  upgrade  the  system  to  support  the  overall  efficiency  of \ncustoms  operations.  However,  a  key  challenge  is  to  realize  the  benefits  of \ntraining.  A  major  lesson  learned  from  training  supported  by  the  EU\u2019s  Transport \nCorridor  Europe-Caucasus-Asia  Program  is  that  training  is  generally  ineffective \nimplementation  purposes  and \nunless \nmeasurable  outcomes.  The  Project  takes  into  account  this  important  lesson \nlearned by (i) introducing incentives and performance measures to maximize the \nimpact of training, and (ii) ensuring that lower ranking and operations staff are the \n\nis  conducted  with  well-defined \n\nit \n\n                                                \n9   Summary of  Discussions of the ICT Working Group. Seminar on Trade Facilitation and Customs Modernization, 4-\n8 August 2003, Issyk-Kul, Kyrgyz Republic. Available: http://www.adb.org/Documents/Events/2003/CCC/Trade_ \n\n  Facilitation_Customs_Modernization/ICT_final_English.pdf. \n\n\f  7\n\nmain  beneficiaries  of  training.  The  human  resource  policy  will  be  revised, \nsupported by the accompanying TA, to provide incentives for staff to acquire new \nskills to meet the challenge of customs modernization.  \n\n(v) \n\nChange  management  and  public  consultation.  Change  management  and \nconsultation  with  customs  staff  and  stakeholders  (such  as  traders  and  brokers) \nare  essential.  Migration  to  automation  is  often  met  with  concerns  because \nautomation  is  unknown  to  most  customs  officers  and  a  manual  operation  in \ncustoms  services  is  the  norm  for  many  developing  countries.  The  benefits  of \nautomation must be emphasized and explained, and fears allayed by a dedicated \ngroup\u2014the change management team. \n\n4. \n\nExternal Assistance and Aid Coordination \n\n \n\n \n\n21. \nIn  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  the  International  Monetary  Fund  and  United  States  Agency  for \nInternational  Development  (USAID)  have  supported  customs  legal  reforms  through  TA  and \nengagement of long-term consultants to help revise the Customs Code in line with the Revised \nKyoto  Convention.  The  EU  through  its  TA  for  the  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States \n(TACIS)  has  been  supporting  customs  modernization  by  providing  special  customs  equipment \nand  pilot  projects  on  automated  data  exchange  at  two  customs  border  posts  between  the \nKyrgyz  Republic  and  Kazakhstan.  The  EU\u2019s  Eurocustoms  has  supported  training  on  modern \ncustoms practices. The World Bank provided a small grant to equip the customs headquarters \nwith  computers  and  servers.  The  Government  of  the  United  States  also  provided  funding  for \ncustoms equipment and associated training. \n \n22. \nIn  Tajikistan,  the  International  Monetary  Fund  and  World  Bank  have  supported  civil \nservice reforms and customs legal reforms through their policy-based and structural adjustment \nprograms.  The  EU,  Swiss  State  Secretariat  for  Economic  Affairs,  and  USAID  have  been \nsupporting  revision  of  the  Customs  Code  and  Tax  Code,  and  accession  to  WTO.  USAID  has \nprovided consulting services to help develop a strategy and investment plan for modernizing tax \nservices;  this  complements  ADB\u2019s  support  for  developing  a  strategy  and  investment  plan  for \ncustoms modernization. These efforts have helped the Government realize its long-term goal of \nintegrating customs and tax services through ICT. \n \n23. \nThe Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan governments play the lead role in aid coordination in \ntheir  respective  countries.  The  Prime  Minister  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  directly  oversees  the \nprogress of reforms supported by ADB\u2019s program loan, and chairs the Commission for Customs \nReforms and Modernization, comprising representatives from relevant public and private sector \nagencies and major funding agencies. The minister for State Revenues and Duties in Tajikistan \noversees  the  reform  progress,  and  chairs  the  Consultative  Group  for  Customs  Reforms  and \nModernization for interagency consultation. ADB is recognized as the lead institution in support \nof  customs  reforms  and  modernization  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  because  of  the \ncomprehensive  packages  of  support  extended  and  planned  long-term  engagement  in  the \nsector. Following the support for customs legal reforms through the program loans, the Project \nwill extend a comprehensive package of support combining physical infrastructure development \nwith  support  for  change  management,  consultation  with  private  sector  stakeholders  and  other \nborder  agencies,  and  capacity  building  and  institutional  strengthening.  Such  comprehensive \nsupport makes the Project unique among the assistance provided by the development partners. \nCompared with the general training on international conventions and modern customs practices \nprovided by other development agencies, training provided under the Project will be conducted \nwith  clear  implementation  purposes  and  measurable  outcomes.  Incentives  for  training  will  be \n\n\f 8\n\nprovided through a change in human resource policy, for staff to embrace the opportunities and \nchallenges of customs modernization. The emphasis on behaviorial change and improved staff \ncompetency  represents  the  value-added  and  niche  of  the  Project  in  training  provided  by  the \ndevelopment  partners.  Appendix  4  provides  detailed  information  on  external  assistance  in  the \ncustoms area. \n \n\n5. \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\nPolicy  dialogue  has  been  focusing  on  reform  initiatives  supported  by  the  ongoing \n24. \nprogram loans for the two countries, particularly in (i) customs legal reform, and (ii) promotion of \ncustoms intermediaries and their associations. Besides progress in revising the Customs Code, \nthe  Kyrgyz  Republic  adopted  a  new  law  on  customs  intermediaries  on  24  June  2004  and  the \nTajikistan  CSD  will  facilitate  establishment  of  a  brokers\u2019  association  in  the  near  future.  The \nadoption  of  the  new  customs  codes  provides  the  legal  foundation  for  simplified  customs \nprocedures and their automation. Promotion of customs intermediaries and their association will \nstrengthen the client orientation of customs services and stakeholders\u2019 participation in customs \nmodernization.  \n \n25. \nProject  sustainability  is  another  focus  of  policy  dialogue.  Extensive  discussions  were \nheld  on  other  countries\u2019  experiences  with  developing  a  UAIS  so  that  that  the  lessons  learned \ncould be incorporated in the design of the Project and the accompanying TA. The emphasis on \nchange  management,  human  resource  development,  and  reengineering  of  the  customs \nbusiness process in the Project reflects the lessons learned. Development of the UAIS has high \neconomic  and  social  returns,  but  also  entails  significant  financial  costs,  not  only  for  system \ndevelopment, but also for maintenance and upgrading to keep up with technology development. \nTherefore,  the  Project  should  be  viewed  as  an  initial  phase  of  UAIS  development,  and  its \npriorities should be the core UAIS application systems. To maintain the momentum of customs \nmodernization, the governments are advised (as reflected in the project assurances) to ensure \nadequate  budgetary  support  for  maintenance  and  upgrading,  and  implementation  of  the  next \nphase of the UAIS in the near future. \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nObjectives \n\nThe  Project\u2019s  objectives  are  (i)  improved  efficiency  and  transparency  of  customs \n26. \nservices,  to  reinforce  the  ongoing  customs  legal  reforms  and  simplification  of  custom \nprocedures;  and  (ii)  trade  facilitation  and  promotion  of  regional  customs  cooperation  through \nconcerted customs reforms and modernization in the ECAR.  \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nThe Project comprises two components each for the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan for \n\n27. \ndevelopment of: (i) the UAIS, and (ii) border-post infrastructure. \n \n\n1. \n\nDevelopment of the UAIS \n\nThis  component  consists  of  three  interrelated  subcomponents:  (i)  developing  the  core \n28. \nUAIS  application  systems  and  associated  operation-support  systems;  (ii)  developing \ncommunications infrastructure to support UAIS operation (i.e., providing and strengthening the \ncommunication  links  between  the  CSDs\u2019  headquarters,  regional  customs  offices,  customs \n\n\f  9\n\nborder  posts,  and  inland  clearance  points);  and  (iii)  providing  training  and  a  public  awareness \ncampaign to ensure sustainability and broad-based support for customs modernization efforts. \nThe major components and functions of the UAIS for customs services are given in Appendix 5. \n \n\na. \n\nDevelopment of Core Application Systems of the UAIS \n\n29.  \nThis subcomponent consists of (i) establishing the operating environment on which the \ndatabase systems and application software will operate; (ii) installing a database system for the \nmanagement  and  integration  of  various  databases,  and  (iii)  developing  the  core  operation \nsystems  of  the  UAIS,  including  the  (a)  core  elements  of  the  customs  declaration  processing \nsystem10  that  forms  the  backbone  of  the  UAIS;  (b)  operations  support  systems,  such  as  the \ncustoms intelligence system and WTO valuation system; and (c) selected management support \nsystems, such as human resource management and financial management systems. \n\n \n\nb. \n\nDevelopment of Communication Infrastructure \n\nThis involves (i) installing a communications network connecting the CSD headquarters, \n30. \nregional offices, and priority customs border posts with associated protocol for communications; \n(ii) providing telecommunications services to connect customs posts with the CSD headquarters \nand  regional  offices;  (iii)  installing  small-scale  local  area  networks  in  the  regional  offices  and \npriority  border  posts;  and  (iv)  upgrading  the  capacity  of  the  existing  wide  area  network  to \nfacilitate  data-sharing  and  communication  with \nthe  CSDs,  agencies,  and  customs \nadministrations of other countries.  \n \n\nc. \n\nHuman Resource Development and Public Awareness Campaign \n\n31. \nThis  includes  (i)  training  for  customs  officers  on  basic  computer  skills  and  applications \nsystems;  (ii)  advanced  training  on  system  administration,  network  management,  systems \ndevelopment,  and  systems  maintenance  and  support;  (iii)  training  on  modern  customs \ntechniques  based  on  risk  management  and  postentry  audit;  and  (iv)  consultation  with \nstakeholders and relevant border agencies to ensure sustainability and broad-based support for \nthe modernization effort and simplification of border procedures through automation. \n \n\n2. \n\nBorder-Post Infrastructure Development \n\n32. \nThe  second  component  aims  to  (i)  improve  customs  border  posts  and  facilities,  (ii) \nprovide customs operations and antismuggling equipment, and (iii) extend capacity building and \npromote border interagency cooperation.  \n \n\na. \n\nImprovement of Customs Border Posts and Facilities11  \n\n33. \nThis  subcomponent  will  address  inadequate  infrastructure  for  customs  operations.  It \ncovers  (i)  construction  and  rehabilitation  of  border  posts  and  facilities;  and  (ii)  provision  and \nreorganization of border-post facilities to strengthen customs processing capacity and facilitate \ntrade in line with modern customs practices.  \n \n\n                                                \n10  The customs declaration processing system aims to automate and simplify major customs control procedures for \ntrade  movement.  The  core  application  systems  cover  major  customs  control  regimes  such  as  import  entry \nprocessing, export processing, and transit movement. \n\n11 Including inland clearance points and terminals. \n\n\f 10\n\nb. \n\nProvision of Customs Operations and Antismuggling Equipment  \n\n34. \nEquipment  will  be  provided  for  priority  border  posts  to  enable  customs  officers  to \neffectively  undertake  their  customs  control  and  antismuggling  function.  Each  selected  border \npost will be provided with operations and search facilities (e.g., mobile inspection platform, X-ray \nmachines, and detectors). The reduced reliance on manual checks is expected to significantly \nimprove  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  customs  control.  This  subcomponent  will  also  include \nacquisition  of  mobile  intervention  equipment  (e.g.,  patrol  vehicles)  to  carry  out  patrols  along \nmajor transit routes and the borders. \n \n\nc. \n\nCapacity Building and Border Interagency Cooperation \n\nThis  subcomponent  includes  provision  of  training  to  customs  officers  on  modern \n35. \ncustoms  control  practices  and  the  use  of  newly  acquired  equipment,  as  well  as  training  on \ninvestigation techniques. In view of the multiple parties involved in trade facilitation and border \ncontrols,  this  subcomponent  will  include  creation  of  cooperative  partnerships  between  border \ninspection  agencies  and  traders  to  simplify  border-post  procedures,  and  provide  effective \ncoordination and management of border-post facilities.  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nThe  Project  has  several  features  relevant  to  thematic  priorities  and  development \n\n36. \napproaches promoted by ADB.  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nFirst,  the  Project  will  promote  private  sector  participation  in  the  process  of \ncustoms  modernization.  Consultation  with  traders  and  their  representatives  will \nbe held during project implementation and through existing forums, such as the \nConsultative  Council,  where  customs  and  private  sector  stakeholders  meet \nregularly  to  exchange  views  and  discuss  major  nontrade  barriers  and  customs \nregulatory  issues.  Such  public-private  partnerships  will  enhance  the  client \norientation of customs services.  \nSecond,  change  management,  human  resource  development,  and  institutional \nstrengthening are key components of the Project and accompanying TA. These \nefforts  will  ensure  that  the  organizational  structure  and  personnel  policy  are \ncompatible with automation, and customs modernization is broadly supported by \ncommensurate development in staff capacity.  \nThird,  the  Project  presents  a  unique  opportunity  to  deepen  regional  customs \ncooperation under the RTFCCP. The CSDs of the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan \nwill  establish  a  joint  working  group  for  regular  consultation  and  project \nimplementation.  Other  countries  joining  the  RTFCCP  have  already  expressed \ninterest in sharing their knowledge on UAIS development and offering advice on \nfunctional and technical specifications of the UAIS. The Project will also offer an \nopportunity  to  broaden  knowledge  sharing  and  customs  modernization  in  areas \nsuch as change management.  \nFourth,  the  Project  will  complement  ADB\u2019s  transport  facilitation  initiatives  by \nimproving border posts and the inland clearance points along ADB-financed road \nprojects in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan.  \n\n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n37. \nThe total project cost is estimated at $22.75 million equivalent. The Kyrgyz component is \nestimated  to  cost  $9.37  million  equivalent  (foreign  exchange  cost  of  $4.83  million  and  local \n\n\f  11\n\ncurrency  cost  of  $4.54  million  equivalent),  and  the  Tajikistan  component  is  estimated  to  cost \n$13.38  million  equivalent  (foreign  exchange  cost  of  $8.42  million  and  local  currency  cost  of \n$4.96 million equivalent).

The  loans  will  have  an  amortization  period  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8 \nyears,  with  an  interest  charge  of  1%  per  year  on  principal  amount  disbursed during the grace \nperiod, and 1.5% per year during the remaining amortization period.  \n \n39. \nFor  the  Kyrgyz  component,  the  loan  will  finance  80%  of  the  total  project  cost  including \nthe full amount of the foreign exchange cost estimated at $4.83 million, and about 59% of the \nlocal  currency  cost  estimated  at  $2.67  million.  For  the  Tajikistan  component,  the  loan  will \n\n\f 12\n\nfinance  80%  of  the  total  project  cost  including  the  full  amount  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost \nestimated at $8.42 million, and about 46% of the local currency cost estimated at $2.28 million. \nThe remaining $1.87 million equivalent for the Kyrgyz Republic and $2.68 million for Tajikistan \nwill  be  provided  by  the  respective  governments  as  counterpart  financing.  The  counterpart \nsupport includes taxes and duties, part of the civil works for both countries, and part of training \ncosts for Tajikistan.  \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nLocal \nCurrency \n \n2.67 \n1.87 \n4.54 \n \n \n2.28 \n2.68 \n4.96 \n\nTotal \nCost \n \n7.50 \n1.87 \n9.37 \n \n \n10.70 \n2.68 \n13.38 \n\n \nPercent \n \n80 \n20 \n100 \n \n \n80 \n20 \n100 \n\nForeign \nExchange \n \n4.83 \n0.00 \n4.83 \n \n \n8.42 \n0.00 \n8.42 \n\n \nSource \nKyrgyz Republic \nADB \nGovernment \n      Total \n \nTajikistan \nADB \nGovernment \n      Total \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n40. \nExecuting  and  Implementing  Agencies.  For  the  Kyrgyz  component,  the  Ministry  of \nFinance  (MOF)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA),  and  the  Committee  for  Revenues  under \nMOF,  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency.  For  the  Tajikistan  component,  the  Ministry  of  State \nRevenues  and  Duties  (MSRD)  will  be  the  EA,  and  MSRD\u2019s  CSD  will  be  the  Implementing \nAgency. The EAs will have overall responsibility for the implementation of project activities. The \norganization charts for the EAs are in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n41. \nProject  Steering  Committee.  Each  EA  will  establish  a  project  steering  committee \n(PSC)  before  or  immediately  after  loan  effectiveness  to  guide  the  overall  direction  and \ncoordinate  issues  related  to  project  implementation.  In  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  the  PSC  will  be \nheaded by the chair of MOF\u2019s Committee for Revenues and include the CSD head and a deputy \nhead.  In  Tajikistan,  the  PSC  will  be  chaired  by  the  MSRD  minister  and  include  the  CSD  head \nand deputy head. Other PSC members may include relevant ministries and agencies (such as \nthe  drug  control  agency)  and  private  sector  stakeholders.  The  PSCs  will  also  serve  as \nmechanisms for private sector participation in customs modernization. This is in addition to the \nconsultative  councils  existing  in  the  two  countries  where  customs  and  private  sector \nstakeholders  meet  regularly  to  discuss  customs-related  issues  and  address  major  nontrade \nbarriers facing traders and their representatives. The PSCs will meet twice a year or as needed. \n \n42.  Management. The chair of the Committee for Revenues in the Kyrgyz Republic and the \nMSRD  minister  in  Tajikistan  will  be  the  project  directors  with  overall  responsibility  for  project \nmanagement. The respective project director will appoint a senior CSD staff member as deputy \nproject director. To oversee day-to-day project implementation, a full-time project management \noffice (PMO) will be set up within the Committee for Revenues for the Kyrgyz project component \nand the CSD for the Tajikistan project component. The PMO will be headed by a qualified PMO \n\n\f  13\n\ndirector  and  deputy  director  selected  on  a  competitive  basis,  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  PMO \ndirector will be assisted by a group of qualified technical and administrative specialists who may \ninclude  loan  finance  officer/accountant,  procurement  specialist,  ICT  and  training  specialists, \ncustoms infrastructure specialist, and office manager and interpreter. Such staff will be selected \nby the Government on a competitive basis. The PMO will remain adequately staffed throughout \nproject  implementation  and  be  assisted  by  international  and  domestic  consultants  financed \nunder the loan and the accompanying TA. The PMO will have the following responsibilities: (i) \nplanning  and  scheduling  of  project  activities;  (ii)  administration  of  procurement  activities  and \nselection of consultants; (iii) bookkeeping and maintenance of project accounts, and preparation \nand consolidation of liquidation reports; (iv) supervision and monitoring of the work program and \nproject performance; (v) coordination of field activities; (vi) engagement of consultants or firms \nto  conduct  audits  of  the  project  account  and  financial  statements;  (vii)  liaison  with  ADB, \nconcerned  Government  agencies,  and  private  sector  stakeholders;  and  (viii)  preparation  of \nquarterly and annual project monitoring and progress reports. \n \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  in  5  years  starting  in  January  2005.  The  project \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n43. \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 7.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n44. \nThe PMO will be responsible for procurement of all equipment, services, and civil works \nfinanced under the Project. All services, supplies, and equipment to be financed by ADB will be \nprocured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Equipment  and  materials  for \npackages  valued  at  $500,000  or  more  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive \nbidding.  Supply  contracts  and  specialized  items  estimated  to  cost  less  than  $500,000  will  be \nprocured  using  international  shopping.  Minor  items  of  equipment  and  materials  costing \n$100,000 or less will be procured through direct purchase. \n \n45. \nCivil  works  contracts  estimated  at  $1  million  equivalent  or  more  will  be  carried  out  by \nprequalified  contractors  using  international  competitive  bidding,  while  those  valued  below  $1 \nmillion  equivalent  will  be  carried  out  using  local  competitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to \nADB.  Civil  works  will  be  required  to  install  ICT  equipment  and  develop  border-post \ninfrastructure. If the civil works\u2019 size, nature, and location make them unsuitable for competitive \nbidding, and if the EA has the facilities and capacity to implement them expeditiously and at a \nreasonable  cost,  then  ADB  may  agree  to  force  account  procedures.  Force  account  will  be \napplied to civil works related to border-post infrastructure development, and will have an upper \nlimit  for  a  package  of  $50,000.  The  award  of  all  civil  works  contracts  will  be  subject  to  ADB \napproval. The indicative list of contract packages is in Appendix 8. The EAs were advised of the \nneed to maintain transparency and accountability in procuring goods and services, as required \nunder ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy.  \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n46. \nThe  Project  will  finance  international  and  domestic  consulting  services  for  project \nimplementation. The terms of reference for the consulting services include systems analysis and \ndesign  (technical  specifications,  hardware  and  software  strategy),  systems  development  and \nintegration, systems implementation, and project management advice. About 20 person-months \nof  international  and  45  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  will  be  required  for  the \nKyrgyz  Republic,  while  24  person-months  of  international  and  52  person-months  of  domestic \nconsulting  services  will  be  required  for  Tajikistan.  The  terms  of  reference  for  the  consulting \n\n\f 14\n\nservices  are  in  Appendix  9.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  either  as  individuals,  and/or \nconsulting firm(s) of international consultants with domestic associates to be selected following \nthe quality- and cost-based selection method, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof  Consultants.  The  CSDs  and  ADB  have  agreed  that  most  of  the  consultants  will  be  hired \nthrough  a  firm.  Domestic  consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB.  Advance  recruitment  of  consultants  will  be  undertaken  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  The  advance  action  includes \nfinalizing  the  terms  of  reference  and  evaluation  criteria,  identifying  suitable  candidates,  and \nranking the candidates and submitting their names and qualifications for ADB approval, together \nwith  the  draft  contract  for  the  negotiation.  The  governments  were  informed  that  approval  of \nadvance action does not commit ADB to finance the Project or to finance the recruitment costs.  \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements  \n\n47. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook.  To  expedite  project  implementation  through  timely  release  of  loan  proceeds,  the \ngovernments  will  each  establish  an  imprest  account  promptly  after  loan  effectiveness  with  an \ninitial deposit of $500,000 equivalent from loan proceeds. The ceiling of total advances at any \ntime  is  not  to  exceed  the  estimated  expenditures  for  the  next  6  months  or  10%  of  the  loan \namount,  whichever  is  lower.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established  at  a  bank  acceptable  to \nADB, and will be managed and liquidated in accordance with detailed arrangements agreed on \nby the implementing agencies and ADB, consistent with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. \nStatement of expenditure (SOE) procedures will be used to reimburse, liquidate, and replenish \nthe  imprest  account  for  eligible  expenditures  not  exceeding  $20,000  per  payment.  Force \naccount procedures will be used to reimburse expenditures for civil works involving the use of \nthe EAs\u2019 work force, equipment, and other resources. ADB reserves the right to conduct spot or \nrandom  checks  of  expenditures  covered  by  SOE.  Notwithstanding  the  Government\u2019s  own \ndisbursement  procedures,  sufficient  supporting  documentation,  as  defined  in  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook, must be kept to substantiate all expenditures incurred from the loan \nproceeds. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n48. \nIn  view  of  the  governments\u2019  inadequate  financial  management  capacity,  the  PMOs  will \nmaintain  separate  accounts  exclusively  for  the  Project  and  will  register  in  such  accounts  all \nreceipts and payments for the Project. Each PMO will include a loan finance officer/accountant \nto ensure that the Project is managed according to sound accounting principles and procedures. \nThe accounts and financial statements for each fiscal year, including the imprest account and \nSOE  records,  will  be  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audit \nreport  will  include  a  statement  verifying  that  the  loan  disbursed  by  ADB  against  the  SOEs  is \nused  for  the  purposes  for  which  the  loan  is  provided.  The  implementing  agencies  will  provide \nADB  with  an  audit  report,  together  with  audited  accounts  and  financial  statements  within  6 \nmonths after the end of each fiscal year. Both the financial statements and auditor\u2019s report will \nbe  in  English.  The  implementing  agencies  were  informed  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  submission  of \naudited accounts. If the delay in submitting financial statement is more than 6 months, ADB will \nnot issue a commitment letter and may not approve new contract awards. If the delay is more \nthan 12 months, loan disbursements may be suspended or the loan may be canceled. \n \nTo  ensure  effective  implementation,  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  Project  will  be \n49. \ncontinuous,  with  timely  reporting.  The  PMO  will  submit  brief  quarterly  and  annual  reports  to \nADB,  indicating  progress  made  and  problems  encountered  during  the  review  period,  steps \ntaken  or  proposed  to  be  taken  to  remedy  the  problems,  proposed  program  of  activities,  and \n\n\f  15\n\nexpected progress during the following period. Within 3 months of physical project completion, \nthe  EAs  will  submit  to  ADB  a  completion  report  providing  details  about  implementation,  costs, \nbenefits, and other information requested by ADB. \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n50. \nThe  implementing  agencies  will  each  establish  an  appropriate  project  performance \nmanagement  system  in  the  PMO  within  1  year  of  effectiveness.  For  periodic  monitoring,  key \nindicators  and  baseline  conditions  will  be  developed  through  surveys  and  incorporated  in  the \nregular  reporting  system.  The  implementing  agencies  and  ADB  have  agreed  on  a  preliminary \nset of project performance indicators, which are incorporated in the Project Framework. Project \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  reports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  on  a  quarterly  basis.  On  project \ncompletion,  the  impacts  of  the  Project  will  be  evaluated  according  to  a  schedule  and  terms  of \nreference agreed upon by the EAs and ADB. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n51. \nThe  EAs  and  ADB  will  jointly  review  the  Project  at  least  twice  during  the  first  year  of \nproject implementation and at least once a year thereafter, and will monitor overall performance \nof the PMO. After 3 years of implementation, a comprehensive midterm review of the Project will \nbe  carried  out  jointly  by  the  EAs  and  ADB,  to  identify  any  problems  and  constraints \nencountered,  and  assess  the  need  for  midterm  modification  of  the  project  scope  and \nimplementation  arrangements.  Technical  and  budgetary  changes  to  the  project  document \nrequested or arising from the review will also be considered, as will be the inclusion of additional \nactivities  or  the  consideration  of  possible  expansion  of  activities/areas  over  the  remaining \nproject life. \n \n\n9. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n52. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  the  EAs.  Attention  was  drawn  to  the \nsection on fraud and corruption in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants. ADB emphasized that ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy requires borrowers (including \nbeneficiaries  of  ADB  loans),  as  well  as  consultants,  bidders,  suppliers,  and  contractors  under \nADB-financed  contracts,  to  observe  the  highest  standards  of  ethics  during  the  recruitment, \nprocurement, and execution of such contracts; and that sanctions as per the guidelines, would \nbe taken if fraud and corruption were discovered. The EAs are committed to creating corruption-\nfree  environments  and  would  like  the  Project  to  be  implemented  strictly  following  ADB\u2019s \nguidelines.  \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \n\nA. \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\nAn accompanying grant-financed TA will be provided to each of the Kyrgyz Republic and \n53. \nTajikistan12  to  ensure  that  (i)  customs  modernization  through  automation  and  border-post \ninfrastructure  development  is  supported  by  the  institutional  structure  and  the  business \nprocesses  of  the  two  countries\u2019  CSDs,  and  that  (ii)  the  UAIS  and  border-post  infrastructure \ndevelopment are carried out with sound supervision and quality assurance. Each TA consists of \n\n                                                \n12 The TA for Tajikistan was first listed in the ADB Business Opportunities (ADBBO) (Internet version) on 31 March \n\n2004 and the TA for the Kyrgyz Republic was listed in the ADBBO on 9 July 2004.  \n\n\f 16\n\nthree  components:  (i)  change  management  and  public-private  partnership  for  customs \nmodernization,  (ii)  reengineering  of  customs  business  processes,  and  (iii)  quality  and  security \nassurance of the UAIS and border-post infrastructure development. Appendix 10 includes cost \nestimates and outline terms of reference for consultants. \n \n54. \nChange  Management  and  Public-Private  Partnership.  This  component  will  ensure \nthat  the  customs  administration\u2019s  organizational  structure  and  human  resource  policy  support \nthe  customs  modernization  efforts,  and  that  the  potential  impact  of  customs  modernization  on \nthe  organizational  structure  and  staff  employment  is  properly  explained  and  fears  are  allayed. \nTherefore,  the  main  task  under  this  component  is  to  review  the  organizational  structure  and \nhuman resource policy (including in-house training capacity) and propose necessary changes to \nsupport  the  customs  modernization  efforts.  It  will  support  the  integration  of  all  the  project \ncomponents  to  develop  a  master  plan  and  maximize  the  development  impact  of  customs \nmodernization.  The  component  will  also  support  (i)  consultation  with  traders  and  their \nrepresentatives to ensure stakeholders\u2019 participation and support, and (ii) design and conduct of \na survey of pilot border posts to provide the benchmarks and inputs for the project performance \nmanagement system and project evaluation. \n \n55. \nReengineering  of  Customs  Business  Processes.  This  component  will  help  ensure \nthat  customs  practices  and  procedures  are  in  line  with  the  Revised  Customs  Code,  Revised \nKyoto Convention, and customs-related WTO agreements; and that automation and procedural \nchanges reinforce each other. The TA will support the review of all customs control procedures \nand documentation, and provide inputs for design of the UAIS. \n \nQuality  and  Security  Assurance.  The  TAs  will  support  an  ICT  systems  development \n56. \naudit  to  establish  quality  and  security  assurance  for  the  systems  development  plan  and \nimplementation,  and  the  security  aspects  to  cover  all  the  components  of  the  UAIS  (e.g., \ndatabases, data transfers, services, workstations). This component will also provide for quality \naspects and supervision for civil works and border infrastructure equipment. \n \nB. \n\nCosts Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nThe  cost  of  each  of  the  TAs  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  is  estimated  at \n57. \n$600,000  equivalent,  including  $400,000  in  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $200,000  equivalent  in \nlocal currency. ADB will provide, on a grant basis, $500,000 each to the Kyrgyz Republic and \nTajikistan  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan,  to  finance  the \nentire  foreign  exchange  costs  and  $100,000  equivalent  of  local  currency  costs.  Each \ngovernment\u2019s  contribution  of  $100,000  will  cover  office  accommodations,  provision  of  support \nstaff, local communication, and logistic support for workshops and seminars. \n  \nC. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n58. \nFor  the  Kyrgyz  TA,  MOF  will  be  the  EA,  and  the  Committee  for  Revenues  the \nImplementing Agency. For the Tajikistan TA, MSRD will be the EA, and CSD the Implementing \nAgency. The TAs will commence in January 2005 and be completed by December 2007 in order \nto  support  project  implementation.  The  PSCs  will  be  charged  with  overseeing  government \ncoordination, and providing timely guidance and management support to the respective TAs. All \nequipment  to  be  purchased  under  the  TAs  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nfacility  will  be  established,  as \nGuidelines \nworkshops/training/seminars require funds prior to the conduct of the events. \n \n\nfor  Procurement.  An  advance  payment \n\n\f  17\n\nThe TAs will finance 14 person-months of international consulting in the Kyrgyz Republic \n59. \nand  12  person-months  in  Tajikistan,  and  58  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  for  each \ncountry. The proposed international and domestic consultants include specialists in (i) customs \nmodernization and change management (2 person-months international and 10 person-months \ndomestic  for  each  country),  (ii)  customs  automation  and  procedures  (8  person-months \ninternational  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  6  person-months  international  for  Tajikistan;  and  24 \nperson-months  domestic  for  each  country),  (iii)  ICT  quality  and  security  assurance  (4  person-\nmonths international and 18 person-months domestic for each country), and (iv) civil works and \nconstruction  supervision  (6  person-months  domestic  for  each  country).  The  breakdown  of \nconsulting requirements is indicative and subject to change at the consultant selection stage.  \n \n60. \nIn  consultation  with  the  EAs,  ADB  will  engage  qualified  firm(s)  of  international \nconsultants  with  domestic  associates  and  additional  individual  consultants  as  necessary  to \nprovide  services  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  reference  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection  method,  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  consultants  will  work \nclosely with the respective implementing agency, relevant agencies and institutions, the project \nPMO, private sector stakeholders, and ADB staff. \n \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nThe project benefits include \n\n61. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\ntrade  facilitation  and  enhanced  revenue  collection  by  simplifying  procedures, \nautomating customs declaration, and introducing modern customs controls based \non risk management and postentry audit; \nprevention  of  smuggling  and  drug  trafficking  by  developing  an  ICT-based \nintelligence  system  and  enhanced  exchange  of  information  between  customs \nheadquarters and border posts, and cooperation between border agencies; \nreduced  corruption  and \nimproving \ntransparency  of  customs  services,  and  minimizing  direct  interfaces  between \ncustoms officers and traders and their representatives; \nsupport  for  regional  customs  cooperation  by  promoting  concerted  customs \nreforms and modernization essential for improving regional trading environment, \nand providing the ICT infrastructure to address issues of common concern, such \nas transit development and data sharing; and \nstrengthened  human  resource  management  and \ninstitutional  capacity  by \nintroducing  a  management  information  system,  and  modern  accounting  and \nfinancial management practices. \n\nimproved  governance  practices  by \n\n \nA. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n62. \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  have  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  21.50%  for  the \nKyrgyz  component  and  23.34%  for  the  Tajikistan  component.  The  Project  will  have  a  positive \nimpact on the overall economic development of the two countries because trade is an engine for \ngrowth,  and  modernization  of  customs  services  is  key  for  facilitating  trade  and  improving  the \nenabling  environment \ninvestment  and  private  sector-led  economic \ndevelopment.  The  main  benefits  that  accrue  to  the  Project  include  (i)  economic  benefits  from \nimproved trade and associated economic growth and employment generation; and (ii) reduced \ntransaction  costs  due  to  enhanced  customs  integrity  and  reduced  waiting  times  at  border \ncrossings and inland clearance points. The Project is expected to reduce transaction costs for \n\nforeign  direct \n\nfor \n\n\f 18\n\ntrade  in  two  ways:  (i)  efficiency  gain  by  automating  customs  services  and  improving  border \nclearance facilities, and (ii) reduced corruption by minimizing direct interfaces between customs \nofficers and traders and their representatives. Other nonquantifiable benefits include improved \ninstitutional capacity of the customs administration, strengthened regional customs cooperation, \nand improved transit and investment conditions in the ECAR. \n \n63. \nThe  fiscal  impact  of  the  Project  is  expected  to  be  positive.  Improvement  in  the  overall \nefficiency of customs services, enhanced customs integrity, more selective approach to customs \ncontrols based on risk management, and stronger enforcement capacity will enable the CSDs to \nboth expand the official volume of trade and deter underreporting and undervaluation. Increased \ntrade volume through formal channels will boost the CSDs\u2019 revenue collection. Automation will \nimprove  transparency  and  reduce  corruption  by  minimizing  direct  interfaces  between  customs \nofficers  and  traders  and  their  representatives.  Enhanced  customs  integrity  reduces  revenue \nleakage  resulting  from  smuggling  and  undervaluation.  The  introduction  of  a  risk  management \nsystem  under  the  Project  will  result  in  an  increased  rate  of  detection  of  smuggling  and  drug \ntrafficking. All these project outcomes will enhance the CSDs\u2019 revenue collection and contribute \nto  sound  fiscal  management  for  poverty  reduction  and  provision  of  social  services.  The \neconomic and financial analyses are included in Appendix 11. \n \nB. \n\nRegional Benefits \n\n64. \nThe Project will have a positive regional impact by (i) improving transit conditions of the \ntwo countries that will greatly facilitate trade of neighboring countries, and (ii) contributing to an \nimproved  overall  trading  and  investment  environment  in  the  ECAR  through  strengthened \nregional customs cooperation.  \n \n65. \nTransit development for international trade is vital for ECAR member countries because \nof  their  small-economies  and  land-locked  natures.  They  depend  on  each  other  to  trade  within \nthe  ECAR  as  well  as  with  major  trading  partners  in  the  rest  of  the  world.  Automation  coupled \nwith improved border facilities and customs integrity will strengthen the national transit systems \nand improve the transit conditions in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan. Further improvement in \nthe  regional  transit  conditions  requires  active  cooperation  of  ECAR  member  countries  to \nestablish a viable regional transit arrangement. Development of a regional transit arrangement \nsupported  by  computerized  national  transit  systems  is  a  major  initiative  of  the  RTFCCP  under \nthe CAREC Program. However, progress has been slow because of significant disparity in the \ncustoms infrastructure conditions of the member countries. Several member countries including \nthe  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  do  not  have  a  unified  automated  information  system  to \nsupport their national transit systems and allow timely sharing of customs data and intelligence \ninformation for transit control. The Project will help the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan to catch \nup  with  customs  infrastructure  development  of  the  neighboring  countries  and  effectively \nparticipate  in  the  development  of  a  regional  transit  arrangement.  Through  faster  and  more \neffective data sharing, the Project will also help implementation of the transit agreement recently \nsigned  between  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Kazakhstan,  and  a  proposed  transit  agreement \nbetween the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan expected to be signed by the end of 2004. \n \nC. \n\nSocial and Poverty Impact \n\n66. \nThe poor will benefit from employment generated from enhanced trade and foreign direct \ninvestment.  Reduced  transaction  costs  make  trade  in  small  volumes  possible  and  therefore \ndirectly benefits the poor and small traders. Civil work for border-post development financed by \nthe Project will directly benefit the poor through employment. The poor will also benefit from the \nCSDs\u2019  greater  revenue  contribution  to  the  governments\u2019  budget.  Customs  revenue  collection \n\n\f  19\n\nrepresents a significant percentage of the governments\u2019 budget (currently estimated at around \n35%). Adequate revenue collection is the key for sound fiscal management for poverty reduction \nand sustainable economic development. The Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \nis in Appendix 12. \n \nD. \n\nEnvironmental Impact  \n\n67. \nADB has classified the Project in environmental category C based on the site visits and \nassessment  under  the  project  preparatory  TAs.  Site  visits  were  made  to  the  regional  customs \noffices and border posts to examine the infrastructure development requirements. Construction \nand civil works will be required at the border posts and inland clearance points selected for the \nProject  for  establishing  permanent  customs  structures,  reorganization  of  border-post  facilities, \nand  installation  of  equipment  for  the  development  of  communications  networks.  Some  of  the \nmore remote locations will also require generators because they either have no main electricity \nor  the  supply  is  unreliable.  All  construction,  rehabilitation,  and  installation  activities  will  be \ncarried out within the premises of the existing customs properties, which are located at the side \nof existing road and rail structures. No land acquisition or resettlement is required.  \n \n68. \nDuring  construction  some  minor  noise  and  dust  pollution  will  occur;  most  will  be \ncontained within existing structures. The civil work contracts will include mitigating measures to \nminimize such pollution. Therefore, the environmental impact of the Project is minimal and can \nbe kept to acceptable levels by implementing mitigation measures in the civil works contracts. \nThe environmental analysis is included in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \nE. \n\nProject Risks  \n\n69. \nThe  governments  are  fully  committed  to  customs  modernization  and  trade  facilitation, \nwhich  mitigates  the  risk  of  lack  of  political  commitment.  The  adoption  of  the  revised  Customs \nCode in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan\u2019s firm commitment to WTO accession and to revise \nthe  Customs  Code  provide  the  legal  foundation  for  simplifying  and  automating  customs \nprocedures.  Project-specific risks may include (i) lack of commitment to change management, \nand resistance from vested interest groups that benefit from lack of transparency and inefficient \ncustoms clearance systems; (ii) lack of consultation and cooperation with the trade community \nand relevant government agencies, (iii) the implementing agencies\u2019 difficulty to recruit and retain \ncompetent  and  experienced  information  technology  personnel,  and  (iv)  inadequate  budget \nprovision  for  maintenance  and  following  phases  of  customs  modernization.  These  risks  are \nmitigated by ongoing measures adopted by the two countries\u2019 EAs, the project and TA design, \nand government assurances.  \n \n70. \nBoth  EAs  fully  embrace  change  management  as  a  key  component  for  customs \nmodernization  to  ensure  broad-based  support  and  manage  resistance  from  vested  interest \ngroups  benefiting  from  lack  of  transparency  and  inefficient  customs  services.  Senior \nmanagement of the two EAs are firmly committed to customs modernization, and accountability \nof  a  team  dedicated  to  customs  modernization  and  project  implementation.  Strong  emphasis \nhas  also  been  given  to  consultation  with  private  sector  stakeholders  through  both  the  existing \nmechanism and a new mechanism introduced under the Project.  \n \n71. \nReorganization is already ongoing to prepare for customs modernization. In the Kyrgyz \nRepublic,  the  division  in  charge  of  customs  automation  was  recently  expanded  into  a \ndepartment  with  an  increase  in  staff  positions.  In  Tajikistan,  the  division,  Programming  and \nSystem  Development,  has  been  established  within  the  department  in  charge  of  customs \nautomation.  This  has  resulted  in  an  increase  in  staff  positions  in  the  department.  The  Project \n\n\f 20\n\noffers  an  opportunity  to  attract  qualified  ICT  specialists  to  join  the  customs  modernization \nefforts.  The  EAs  will  give  special  attention  to  staff  retention,  especially  for  specialists  who  join \nproject implementation.  \n \nThe  potential  counterpart  fund  risk  has  been  mitigated  by  the  governments\u2019  strong \n72. \nsupport  for  the  Project  and  their  assurances.  The  MOFs  of  both  countries  assured  ADB  that \nadequate counterpart funds will be provided during project implementation and requested their \nrespective  implementing  agencies  to  submit  a  proposal  for  the  counterpart  funds.  Adequate \nfunding  for  maintenance  and  expansion  of  customs  modernization  is  expected  to  be  available \nbeyond the implementation period with the MOFs\u2019 assurance of supporting following phases of \ncustoms automation and border-post infrastructure development.  \n \nThe  potential  risk  of  project  delay  could  be  due  to  (i)  inadequate  attention  to  planning \n73. \nand  (ii)  lack  of  experience  with  ADB\u2019s  project  implementation  procedures.  The  former  is \nmitigated by the governments\u2019 assurance to set up a working group before loan negotiations to \nprepare  a  master  plan  for  project  implementation,  and  the  latter  will  be  mitigated  by  intensive \ntraining on project implementation and support from ADB review missions. \n \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Kyrgyz  and  Tajikistan  governments  have \n\n74. \ngiven the following assurances, which are incorporated in the respective legal documents. \n \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  Working  Group  comprising  EA  and  CSD  staff \nwill  prepare  master  plan  for  the  development  of  the  UAIS  and  border-post \ninfrastructure. The master plan will be completed during the first year of project \nimplementation.  The  master  plan  for  the  UAIS  will  include  functional  and \ntechnical  specifications,  priority  and  sequencing  of  the  development  of  various \napplication  systems  for  the  UAIS,  piloting  testing,  change  management, \nconsultation, and training measures. \n\nThe  Government  will  establish  a  PSC  to  consult  with  relevant  government \nagencies  and  private  sector  stakeholders  before  or  immediately  after  loan \neffectiveness. \n\nThe Government will ensure that the EA implements the training plan (as part of \nthe master plan). \n\nThe Government will ensure that during project implementation (a) CSD prepares \nan operation plan indicating counterpart fund requirements for the following year, \nand  (b)  MOF  allocates  and  disburses  necessary  counterpart  funds  on  a  timely \nbasis. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  EA  conducts  an  independent  audit  on  the \nproject  account  and  financial  statement  within  6  months  after  the  close  of  each \nfiscal year during project implementation. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f  21\n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  EA  establishes  a  project  performance \nmanagement  system  with  assistance  of  consultants  within  1  year  from  the \ncommencement of project implementation.  \n\nBy the end of year 3 of project implementation, the Government will ensure the \ndevelopment of an investment plan for upgrading the UAIS and customs border-\npost infrastructure.  \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n \n\n \nB. \n\nCondition for Loan Disbursement \n\n75. \nThe  Government  agreed  to  the  following  condition  for  withdrawal  of  loan  proceeds, \nwhich  is  incorporated  in  the  Loan  Agreement:  establishment  of  the  PMO  in  a  manner \nsatisfactory to ADB. \n \n \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n76. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 5,106,000 to \nthe  Kyrgyz  Republic  for  the  Regional  Customs  Modernization  and  Infrastructure \nDevelopment  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  an  interest \ncharge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per \nannum  thereafter;  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and \nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board; and \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 7,266,000 to \nthe  Republic  of  Tajikistan  for  the  Regional  Customs  Modernization  and \nInfrastructure Development Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an \ninterest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% \nper annum thereafter;

The  service  sector  grew  at  5.8%,  the  highest  rate  for  the  past  decade. \nDeregulation  and  steady  growth  in  tourism  was  attributable  to  the  growth.  However,  the \nagriculture  sector  grew  at  only  3.8%  due  to  unfavorable  weather.  Inflation  continued  its \ndownward trend in 2003, growing at 3% compared with 3.7% in 2002 and 9.6% in 2001. \n \n2 \nThe  fiscal  deficit  decreased  by  0.4%  to  5.0%  of  GDP  in  2003.  It  was,  however,  higher \nthan targeted due to the unanticipated spending on disaster relief and emergency rehabilitation. \nTotal tax and duty revenues increased by 0.8% of GDP to 18.7% of GDP in 2003 because of \nimproved tax and duty collection. The value-added tax (VAT) was introduced on large farms in \nApril  2003.  Property  tax  legislation  was  approved  and  is  likely  to  be  introduced  in  2005  after \nagreements  on  valuation  and  exemption  limits.  Excise  duties  on  petroleum  fuels  were  cut  by \n50% resulting in a sharp fall in smuggling and a rise in revenue.  \n \n3. \nThe Government maintained prudent fiscal policy in 2003 as part of its debt reduction \nstrategy. As a result, public investment fell to 3.6% of GDP in 2003 from 4.7% in the previous \nyear.  The  debt-servicing  burden  eased  as  the  Government  successfully  negotiated  with  the \nmajority  of  bilateral  creditors  following  the  understandings  reached  in  the  Paris  Club  in  March \n2002.  The  understandings  with  the  Paris  Club  creditors  include  a  goodwill  clause  that  the \ncountry  may  be  able  to  secure  still  more  debt  restructuring,  including  substantial  reduction  of \ndebt  outstanding  provided  that  the  ongoing  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Facility  is \nsuccessfully completed. \n \nThe trade deficit increased in 2003 to $82.7 million. This was due to strong imports and \n4. \nreduced  smuggling  of  oil  products  resulting  from  the  success  of  the  excise  tax  reform.  During \n1993\u20132003, exports increased from $340 million to $580 million, while imports increased from \n$448  million  to  $717  million.  In  2003,  exports  accounted  for  30%  of  GDP,  while  imports \naccounted  for  37%.  Approximately  50%  of  imports  come  from  the  Russian  Federation, \nKazakhstan,  and  Uzbekistan.  The  Russian  Federation  and  Central  Asian  countries  are  also \nmajor destinations of Kyrgyz exports.  \n \n\n2. \n\nCustoms Administration \n\n5. \nEstablished in 1991, the customs administration has a decade of experience in customs \nservices.  The  Customs  Services  Department  (CSD)  is  placed  under  the  Committee  for \nRevenues of the Ministry of Finance, along with the Tax Department. CSD employs about 1,270 \nofficers working in the headquarters, regional offices, and border posts. There are 15 customs \nregions  and  65  border  crossing  points  (of  which  4  are  railways).  CSD  processed  70,000 \ndeclarations  in  2002  consisting  of  45,974  imports  and  23,765  exports  declarations.  These \nfigures  only  relate  to  freight  traffic  and  exclude  personal  declarations  such  as  those  made  by \npassengers at the airports and border posts. \n  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\nCustoms  Legal  Framework.  A  major  change  in  the  Customs  Code  was  introduced  in \n6. \nDecember  1998  as  part  of  the  country\u2019s  effort  to  join  the  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO). \nFurther  revision  has  been  made  in  the  past  few  years  in  an  effort  to  streamline  customs \nregulations  and  adopt  modern  customs  practices  based  on  risk  management  and  postentry \naudit. The revised Customs Code was adopted on 13 April 2004. Parliament ratified a separate \nlaw  on  customs  licensing  on  24  June  2004  to  stipulate  the  legal  status  and  regulation  of \ncustoms  intermediaries.  Currently,  only  the  so-called  infrastructure  staff,  originally  hired  and \ntrained by CSD, have the authority to prepare declarations and act as obligatory intermediaries \nbetween importers and CSD. They also operate bonded warehouses and clearance sheds, for \nwhich they charge fees, and are responsible for the sale of unclaimed goods.  \n \n7. \ndemonstrate CSD\u2019s commitment to customs modernization:  \n \n\nCustoms  Control.  The  approach  to  clearance  and  general  customs  operations \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nWTO\u2019s valuation system is in force. \nCSD  has  introduced  the  Single  Administrative  Document  as  the  standard \ndeclaration  form,  which  unifies  all  customs  documents  in  the  Central  Asian \ncountries. \nData  is  shared  with  the  Tax  Department  for  VAT  control  purposes,  and  a \ntaxpayer identification number issued by the Tax Department is in use. \nThe  concept  of  selectivity  for  physical  examinations  is  fully  understood  in  CSD \nheadquarters,  and  \u201cgreen  corridors\u201d  are  introduced  at  selected  border  posts  to \nallow  approved  importers  to  be  entitled  to  simplified  procedures,  such  as \naccelerated  border  processing  and  deferred  payment  of  duty  (subject  to  0.3% \ninterest), and direct clearance on the premises of importers is envisaged. \nA streamlined system for settling out of court minor customs violations is used. \n\n \n8. \nRevenue Collection. CSD collects customs duty, excise tax, and VAT on international \ntrade.  The  contribution  of  customs  revenues  to  the  fiscal  budget  has  been  rising,  currently \naccounting  for  over  one  third  of  all  revenues.  During  2000\u20132003,  total  customs  revenue \ncollections increased by more than 100% in dollar terms. In 2003, CSD contributed $114 million \nto the Government budget. The efficient collection of revenue by CSD is critical to the national \neconomy and to poverty reduction and other social sector programs.  \n \n9. \nIn addition to CSD acting as a revenue collection agency on behalf of the Government, it \nis  authorized  to  collect  fees  on  transaction  charges  based  on  0.15%  of  import  value.  The \nrevenue generated from such fees is insufficient to cover overall CSD expenditure and therefore \nthe  Ministry  of  Finance  provides  a  budget  allocation  of  about  $1  million  per  annum.  Of  the \nrevenue from the fee collection and budget provision, approximately two thirds is spent on staff \nremuneration.  Of  the  remainder,  half  is  spent  on  equipment  and  a  mere  3%  on  building \nmaintenance. The remaining fund is insufficient for major customs infrastructure undertaking.  \n \n10. \nInformation and Communication Technology Infrastructure Conditions. CSD does \nnot have the core customs application systems and adequate communications infrastructure to \nautomate  customs  services  and  support  modern  customs  control  practices  based  on  risk \nmanagement  as  promulgated  in  the  revised  Customs  Code.  Communication  within  the \nheadquarters is provided by a corporate local area network. The connection of computers and \nprinters via dual servers enables E-mail and limited Internet access.  \n \n11. \nCommunication  between  regional  CSD  offices  and  headquarters  is  through  the \nGovernment\u2019s  wide  area  network,  which  cannot  accommodate  the  growing  volume  of \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\ninformation flow and performs poorly. None of the border posts have communications facilities \nresulting in delayed submission of customs statistics to headquarters.  \n \n12. \nRegional  Customs  Cooperation.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  a  member  of  the  Eurasian \nEconomic Community, which includes Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russian Federation, and Tajikistan. \nIt was created in 2000 to promote trade and economic cooperation among the members within \nthe  framework  of  a  customs  union.  From  the  beginning,  the  countries  agreed  to  remove  all \ntariffs and nontariff barriers among the members and to keep external tariffs low. At the annual \nmeeting  held  in  May  2003  in  Dushanbe,  Tajikistan,  members  agreed  to  have  a  similar  tariff \nstructure for external trade rather than a common external tariff in view of varied stages in WTO \naccession. The objective of having a common external tariff is now deferred to 2010.  \n \nThe  Kyrgyz  CSD  is  a  member  of  the  ADB-sponsored  Regional  Customs  Cooperation \n13. \nProgram for East and Central Asia consisting of seven other countries. The program provides a \nforum for the Kyrgyz CSD to advance a number of bilateral initiatives to improve regional transit \nconditions,  share  customs  information,  and  pilot  test  joint  customs  processing.  The  Kyrgyz \nRepublic entered into a transit agreement with Kazakhstan on 26 March 2004, and initiated joint \nborder processing with Kazakhstan at one border post effective July 2004. Sponsored by ADB, \nthe  customs  administrations  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  conducted  two  rounds  of \nconsultation on a draft transit agreement in June and August 2004, and both parties agreed to \nreconvene  soon  to  finalize  the  draft  agreement.  The  Kyrgyz  CSD  has  also  made  progress  in \ndeveloping  an  agreement  on  data  sharing  with  the  customs  department  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China. \n \nB.  \n\nTajikistan \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Development \n\nEconomic  development  remained  buoyant  in  2003,  growing  at  a  brisk  pace  of  10.2% \n14. \ncompared  with  9.1%  in  2002.  While  cotton  and  aluminum,  the  two  traditional  pillars  of  the \neconomy,  remain  important  driving  forces,  growth  has  become  more  broad-based.  Economic \ndiversification  is  led  in  part  by  the  rapid  expansion  of  the  service  sector  growing  at  14.7%  in \n2003.  Inflation  grew  at  16.4%  in  2003  compared  with  14.2%  in  2002  and  an  average  rate  of \n35%  during  1999  and  2001.  High  inflation  was  mainly  due  to  sharp  increases  in  prices  of \nimported grains and wheat flour, and tariff increases for electricity and gas introduced under the \nenergy sector reforms.  \n \n15. \nExternal  debt  declined  to  65%  of  GDP  from  82%  of  the  previous  year.  The  Russian \nFederation  and  Uzbekistan  are  two  major  creditors  from  which  Tajikistan  imports  oil  and  gas. \nThe external debt will be eased because of the recent agreement with the Russian Federation \nto write off $250 million in exchange for ownership of space facilities. \n \n16. \nThe economy of Tajikistan is highly dependent on foreign trade, with exports equivalent \nto  57%  of  GDP.  Cotton  and  aluminum  are  responsible  for  over  80%  of  export  earnings, \nrendering the economy extremely vulnerable to changes in the terms of trade, i.e., the prices of \nthese  commodities  in  the  international  market.  Imports  are  dominated  by  raw  materials, \nparticularly aluminum oxide for aluminum processing, gas for providing heating in major cities, \npetroleum products, and grain and flour. Major export destinations are Iran, Latvia, Netherlands, \nRussian  Federation,  Switzerland,  Turkey,  and  Uzbekistan,  while  imports  mainly  come  from \nAzerbaijan,  Kazakhstan,  Russian  Federation,  Ukraine,  and  Uzbekistan.  Despite  the  favorable \nconditions  for  cotton  and  aluminum  on  the  international  market,  the  trade  deficit  widened  in \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n29 \n\n \n\n \n\n2003  due  to  the  increase  in  imports  associated  with  strong  growth.  Exports  reached  $798 \nmillion, and imports $881 million. However, the current account deficit narrowed due to a sharp \nincrease in remittance from migrant workers reaching $202 million in 2003 compared with $65 \nmillion in 2002.  \n\n2. \n\nCustoms Administration  \n\n17. \nCustoms  administration,  CSD,  is  under  the  Ministry  of  State  Revenue  and  Duties \n(MSRD). It has about 1,500 employees located at the headquarters, regional offices, and border \nposts and inland clearance points.  \n \n18. \nCSD plays a crucial role in trade facilitation, revenue collection, and curbing smuggling \nand drug trafficking. Despite its infancy, CSD\u2019s contribution to the national budget is significant \nwith over one third of all revenues. With its sizable contribution to the national budget, effective \nand efficient customs services are critical to the country\u2019s economic growth and development.  \n \nCustoms Legal Reforms. The Customs Code has been revised and is widely circulated \n19. \nto relevant authorities and organizations for comments and suggestions. It was submitted to the \nParliament  on  30  September  2004.  A  key  objective  of  the  revision  of  the  Customs  Code  is  to \nreduce and simplify the existing customs regulations and procedures. The revised code has two \nimportant features: it is compliant with the Revised Kyoto Convention, which is the benchmark \nfor  reforms  and  modernization  of  customs  administrations  worldwide;  and  it  provides  detailed \nregulations and procedural guidance to help significantly reduce the number of existing customs \nregulations.  \n \n20. \nRevenue  Collection.  CSD  collects  import  duties,  excise  taxes,  and  VAT  on  imported \ngoods. In 2003, total revenues collected were $103 million compared with $72 million in 2002, \nand $49 million in 2001. The introduction of the VAT resulted in the sharp increase in revenue \ncollection. In addition, CSD collects a fee of 0.15% on the value of goods cleared, and penalties \nimposed on inappropriate customs declaration and undervaluation. The fee collected amounted \nto $2.3 million in 2003, which represents a major source for staff salary, pension and insurance, \nand infrastructure development. Additionally, MSRD as a whole receives about $2 million from \nthe Government as part of the administrative budget.  \n \n21. \nCustoms  Infrastructure.  CSD  has  no  automated  declaration  system  or  adequate \ncommunications infrastructure to support modern customs practices, such as risk management \nand postentry audit. Among the five regional offices, only one has telecommunications tools for \ndata exchange through a radio communications data transfer system. Data exchange between \nborder  posts  and  regional  offices  are  carried  out  using  floppy  disks.  The  lack  of  technology \ncapacity  to  capture  importers\u2019  entry  data  for  customs  declaration  in  a  centralized  place  for \ncalculating  duties  and  taxes  and  validating  the  entry  is  a  major  source  of  revenue  loss  and \ncorruption  at  border  posts.  The  quality  of  customs  statistics  is  poor  and  cannot  be  easily \ndistributed  to  the  relevant  government  agencies  for  trade  facilitation  and  antismuggling \npurposes.  \n \n\n22. \nThe border-post conditions are poor due to the civil war and inadequate budget provision \nfor  maintenance.  Very  few  border  posts  have  permanent  structures  originally  designed  for \ncustoms  operations.  Very  few  customs  posts  have  equipment  for  weighing  and  preventing \ncontraband and drug trafficking. In most border posts, electricity supply is unstable and at best \nprovided only for 7\u20138 hours a day, which gives opportunities for increased illicit trade. Without \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\ncustoms  automation  and  adequate  border-post  infrastructure,  the  benefit  of  customs  legal \nreforms and procedure simplification cannot be fully realized.  \n \n23. \nRegional  Customs  Cooperation.  Tajikistan  is  a  member  of  the  Eurasian  Economic \nCommunity  pursing  the  objective  of  forming  a  customs  union  of  the  member  countries.

The  with-project  scenario  provides  significant  improvement  in \nefficiency of customs services resulting from automation, better border facilities, and simplified \ncustoms  procedures.  Corruption  would  be  reduced  because  of  less  direct  interfaces  between \ncustoms  officers  and  traders  and  their  representatives.  As  a  result,  economic  benefits \nassociated with (i) incremental increase in trade from improving the overall trading environment \nand  an  increase  in  foreign  direct  investment,  and  (ii)  time  savings  from  reduced  transaction \ncosts  at  border  posts  and  inland  clearance  points.  These  two  benefits  are  included  in  the \nmeasurement of the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) through a set of assumptions (para. \n3). The without-project  scenario  would  be  the  current  situation  where  customs  declaration  are \nprocessed  manually  and  no  major  changes  are  made  to  border-post  conditions  because  the \nrevenue generated from customs services fees is not even adequate for maintenance.  \n \n2. \nThe  EIRR  is  calculated  over  25  years.  The  benefits  consist  of  incremental  increase  in \ntrade and time savings. The EIRRs are 21.50% for the Kyrgyz component and 23.34% for the \nTajikistan component. The regional benefits resulting from improved transit conditions in the two \ncountries  are  not  quantified  as  they  mainly  accrue  to  neighboring  countries.  Another  major \nnonquantified  benefit  is  the  promotion  of  the  transport  sector  in  the  East  and  Central  Asian \nRegion. \n \n3. \n\nSpecifically, the main assumptions for the EIRR are as follows: \n \n(i) \n\nEconomic  project  cost.  The  Kyrgyz  component  is  estimated  to  cost  $8.98 \nmillion, while the Tajikistan component is estimated to cost $12.73 million.1 \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\nIncremental  recurrent  cost.  Cost  for  maintenance,  replacement,  and  upgrade \nof equipment and the system are about $898,000/annum for the Kyrgyz Republic \nand $1.08 million/annum for Tajikistan over 25 years. \n\nBenefits  from  reduced  transaction  cost.  Modernization  of  customs  services \nsupported  by  the  ongoing  customs  legal  reforms,  including  the  approval  of  the \nrevised customs codes, will contribute to speeding up of the customs clearance \nprocedures.  As  a  result,  the  transaction  costs  and  losses  associated  with  long \nprocessing time will decline considerably. The annual savings on transport costs \nat  border  crossings  and  inland  terminals  under  the  Project  will  progressively \nreach about $1.9 million in the Kyrgyz Republic and $2.8 million in Tajikistan by \nthe end of 2029, compared with small progress expected without the Project.2 \n\n                                                \n1 Costs exclude price escalation, taxes and duties, interest, and commitment charges. \n2 Currently, the customs declaration has to be submitted to customs control where it is checked and registered in a \njournal. It then goes to the cashier\u2019s desk, and physical inspection of goods. Relevant parts of the declaration are \nsubmitted to the regional statistics office. The procedures generally take 1.5 hours to cross the border and complete \ncustoms  clearance.  The  project  activities  are  estimated  to  reduce  the  time  costs  of  customs  clearances  by  10 \nminutes, and as such, yield benefits to both the government and traders. It is assumed that (i) 200 trucks cross the \nborder  posts  each  day,  (ii)  there  are  330  working  days  per  year,  and  (iii)  truck  costs  are  $6  per  hour.  It  is  also \nassumed  that  185  customs  officers  are  engaged  in  processing  the  above-cited  transactions  and  that  their \nremuneration  is  at  the  rate  of  $0.12  per  hour  (based  on  data  from  the  National  Statistics  Commission,  Kyrgyz \nRepublic). \n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n \n\nThe estimated cost-benefits achievement path is as follows: 2005\u20145%, 2006\u2014\n20%, 2007\u201430%, 2008\u201440%, 2009 and thereafter\u201450%. \n\nBenefits  from  expansion  of  trade.  At  present,  the  growth  of  foreign  trade  is \nrestrained  partly  due  to  lack  of  efficient  and  transparent  customs  services.  The \nProject will address these major constraints and contribute to the development of \nan  enabling  trading  environment  in  the  two  countries.  Delivery  of  goods  will \nbecome  more  reliable  and  efficient;  this  will  stimulate  the  development  of  the \ntrade  sector  and  of  logistics  services.  In  the  medium-term,  these  factors  are \nexpected to contribute to a sustained increase in trade. The economic benefits of \nexpanded \ntransportation  and  other \ncommercial  services  related  to  foreign  trade  leading  to  creation  of  new  jobs, \nbroadening  of  tax  base,  and  growth  of  customs  duties  and  fees.  Due  to  the \ndifficulty to quantify the broad economic benefit of expanded trade, the benefit is \nassumed to be 20% of the benefit from reduced transaction costs. \n\ntrade  will  stimulate  growth  of  cargo \n\n \n4.  \nAdditional  technical  assumptions  in  calculating  the  financial  and  economic  costs  and \nbenefits of the Project based on the Guidelines on Economic and Financial Analysis of Projects \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) include  \n \n\nmain indicators and coefficients are expressed in dollars;  \nthe period of analysis covers 25 years (2005\u20132029), carried out in constant 2004 \ndollar prices, with domestic prices used as the numeraire; \nfinancial costs are converted into economic costs by excluding taxes and duties, \nand price contingencies;  \neconomic costs are calculated based on the annual project cost disbursements, \nwith incremental recurrent costs estimated at about 10% of capital costs; and  \ntradable  goods  of  capital  and  operation  and  maintenance  costs  are  adjusted \nbased  on  a  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  of  1.10  (based  on  ADB  guidelines). \nTradable goods are about 70% of project costs. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\nYear \n\n2005 \n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010\u20132029 \n\nTable A11.1: Economic Cost-Benefit \n($ million)  \nKyrgyz Republic  \n\nCosts  \n\n1.18 \n2.09 \n2.55 \n3.01 \n1.68 \n20.92 \n31.42 \n \n \n\n \n \n\nBenefits \n\n   0.22 \n   0.87 \n1.31 \n1.79 \n2.18 \n47.36 \n53.73 \n   21.50% \n3.04 \n\nTajikistan \n\nCosts  \n\nBenefits \n\n1.55 \n2.84 \n3.49 \n4.14 \n2.24 \n25.42 \n39.67 \n \n \n\n \n \n\n0.28 \n1.12 \n1.68 \n2.23 \n2.79 \n          69.84 \n          77.94 \n\n  23.34% \n5.54 \n\nTotal \nEIRR \nNPV @ 12% \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return.

Improvement  in  the  overall \nefficiency  of  customs  services,  enhanced  customs  integrity,  more  selective  approaches  to \ncustoms controls based on risk management, and stronger enforcement capacity will enable the \ncustoms  service  departments  (CSDs)  to  both  expand  the  official  volume  of  trade  and  deter \nunderreporting and undervaluation. Increased trade volume will boost revenue collection by the \nCSDs.  Automation  will  improve  transparency  and  reduce  corruption  by  minimizing  direct \ninterfaces  between  customs  officers  and  traders  and  their  representatives;  enhanced  customs \nintegrity  reduces  revenue \nfrom  smuggling  and  undervaluation.  The \nintroduction  of  a  risk  management  system  under  the  Project  will  result  in  increased  rate  of \ndetection  of  smuggling  and  drug  trafficking,  which  will  also  have  a  positive  impact  on  revenue \ngeneration. The Project will enhance the CSDs\u2019 contribution to the Government budget.  \n \n \n\nleakage  resulting \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan: \n \nThe Project is a continuation of Asian Development Bank (ADB) support for customs reform and modernization for the \nKyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan under the Regional Trade Facilitation and Customs Cooperation Program launched in \n2002.  The  Project  aims  to  improve  efficiency  and  transparency  of  customs  services  thereby  contributing  to  the \nenhancement of the enabling environment for international trade and foreign direct investment. The poor will benefit \nfrom  employment  generated  from  enhanced  trade  and  foreign  direct  investment.  The  Project  is  expected  to  reduce \ntransaction  costs  for  trade  in  two  ways:  (i)  efficiency  gain  through  automation  of  customs  services  and  improved \nborder  clearance  facilities,  and  (ii)  reduced  corruption  by  minimizing  direct  interfaces  between  customs  officers  and \ntraders  and  their  representatives.  Reduced  transaction  cost  makes  trade  in  small  volume  possible  and  therefore \ndirectly benefits the poor and small traders. Civil work for border-post development financed by the Project will directly \nbenefit the poor through employment.  \n \nImproved  efficiency  and  governance  will  enhance  revenue  collection  by  the  customs  services  departments.  This \nrevenue represents a significant percentage of the government budget (currently estimated at around 35%). Adequate \nrevenue  collection  is  the  key  for  sound  fiscal  management  for  poverty  reduction  and  sustainable  economic \ndevelopment. The poor will benefit from improved provision of social services from the government budget.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                   Proposed Poverty Classification: Other \n \nThe ADB country strategies and programs for the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan show that the incidence of poverty \nfor both countries remains high in spite of recent progress in economic development and macroeconomic stabilization. \n \nFor the Kyrgyz Republic, latest available data shows that almost half of the population is poor. The level of poverty \npeaked at an estimated 55.3% on a per capita expenditure basis in 1999, following the Russian Federation\u2019s financial \ncrisis. Subsequent economic recovery significantly reduced aggregate poverty, with the headcount index of absolute \npoverty declining by about 11% in 2000\u20132002. Despite this progress, poverty remains high, with an estimated 44.4% \nof the population living in absolute poverty and 13.8 % living in extreme poverty in 2002.  \n \nRural  poverty  declined  over  1998\u20132001  at  an  average  rate  of  8%  per  year  largely  due  to  better  performance  of  the \nagriculture sector. However, rural poverty continues to be significantly higher than urban poverty. About three quarters \nof the poor people in 2001 were living in rural areas.  \n  \nThere  is  general  consensus  on  the  causes  and  determinants  of  poverty  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  The  emergence  of \nhigh  levels  of  poverty  can  be  traced  to  the  disintegration  of  the  Soviet  Union,  which  caused  severe  reductions  in \nproduction due to the disruption of geographically spread production and distribution chains and the loss of traditional \nmarkets.  This  in  turn  led  to  rapidly  increasing  unemployment  at  a  time  when  the  state\u2019s  capacity  to  respond  was \nimpaired  by  the  loss  of  federal  budgetary  support  and  a  sharp  shrinkage  of  the  revenue  base.  The  continuing  high \nlevels of poverty are largely due to challenges in the reform of state institutions and the restructuring of society and the \neconomy according to market rules and mechanisms, specifically: (i) difficulties creating and sustaining opportunities \nfor gainful employment on a substantial scale; (ii) problems relating to external and domestic market development for \nKyrgyz  products,  reflecting  the  landlocked  nature  of  country  with  its  trade  and  transit  problems,  limited  natural \nresources, and small domestic market; (iii) limited capacity of the state to address essential needs in the social sectors \ndue  to  fiscal  constraints;  and  (iv)  continuing  corruption  and  inefficiency  in  the  instruments  of  state  governance  that \ninhibit private enterprise and legitimate entrepreneurial activity. \n \nPoverty reduction is the overarching objective of the Comprehensive Development Framework of the Kyrgyz Republic \nfor 2001\u20132010. The Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy, which is a medium-term operational plan (2003\u2013\n2005) to implement the goals of the Comprehensive Development Framework, envisages a three-pronged approach \nto development: (i) building an effective and transparent state, (ii) building a fair society, and (iii) promoting sustainable \neconomic growth. The importance of regional cooperation to this landlocked country particularly in trade, and transport \nlinks for enhancing exports is stressed in the Poverty Reduction Strategy. \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n53 \n\nFor  Tajikistan,  poverty  likewise  increased  dramatically  after  1991  with  the  collapse  of  the  former  Soviet  Union.  The \nWorld  Bank's  earlier  estimates  show  that  over  80%  of  the  1999  population  lived  below  the  poverty  line.  Poverty  is \nmore pronounced in rural than in urban areas, with 81% of the poor living in rural areas. Families with many children \nand old people living alone have the highest risk of poverty. Female-headed families account for almost 30% of the \npoor.  \n \nAccording to the recent preliminary assessment by the World Bank, the incidence of poverty has come down to 68% \nfrom the previous level of 83% as estimated by the 1999 survey. However, much of the improvement comes from the \nurban sector. The poverty incidence remains high in rural areas, particularly in the southern part of the country. \n \nThe major causes of poverty in Tajikistan are: (i) a decline in output, wage levels, and employment resulting from the \ncollapse of the Soviet Union and the civil war; (ii) severance of central subsidies and fiscal adjustment, which reduced \nthe access of the poor to vital social services, health, education, and heating; and (iii) rising inequality. \n \nThe  Tajikistan  Government\u2019s  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy,  finalized  in  June  2002,  has  three  main  pillars  to  reduce \npoverty: (i) sustained high economic growth; (ii) improved governance; and (iii) improved access to social services, in \npart through better targeting. The strategy views growth of the agricultural sector and increased agricultural exports\u2014\nas  well  as  adequate  infrastructure  for  energy,  transport,  water  supply,  and  communications\u2014as  key  to  achieving \neconomic growth and poverty reduction. \n \nThe Project supports the two countries\u2019 poverty reduction strategies. The Project provides investment and assistance \nto (i) strengthen governance and transparency, and improve institutional capability in customs services to improve the \nenabling  environment  for  market-oriented  and  private  sector-led  economic  development;  (ii)  improve  operational \nefficiency  to  facilitate  trade  and  improve  revenue  collection,  which  generates  employment  and  ensures  adequate \nprovision of social services; and (iii) develop an effective mechanism for good regional cooperation in customs service \nthat  would  in  the  longer-term  stimulate  trade  and  economic  growth,  benefiting  the  poor  and  non-poor  in  the  whole \nregion. \n\nC.
