THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Government of the \nUnited Kingdom, both to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the National Motorway M-4 Gojra\u2013\nShorkot Section Project.1 \n \n2.  The proposed project will construct a 62-kilometer (km) four-lane, access-controlled \nmotorway  connecting  Gojra  and  Shorkot  in  Punjab  Province,  and  improve  the  institutional \ncapacity of the National Highway Authority (NHA), particularly for managing safeguards and \ncontracts.2  The project will facilitate north\u2013south connectivity, improve quality and efficiency of \nroad transport services, and promote inclusive economic growth. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  In Pakistan, the transport sector contributes about 10% to the gross domestic product \n(GDP). It is estimated that 2.3 million people (about 6% of the total employed labor force of \nPakistan) earn their livelihoods from this sector. Road transport dominates Pakistan's transport \nsystem, accounting for almost 96% of freight traffic in ton-kilometers and 92% of passenger \ntraffic in passenger-kilometers. Much of the country\u2019s 12,500 km national highway network was \nbuilt before the 1950s. About 75% of it consists of two-lane undivided roads of 6\u20137 meters (m) \nin width. With a growing economy fueled mainly by growth in manufacturing and a relatively high \npopulation  growth,  traffic  demand  is  on  the  rise.  However,  slow-moving  trucks  and \nnonmotorized traffic, poor road conditions, and frequent truck overloading are impeding the \nefficiency and safety of road transport. To reduce the traffic load on the heavily used national \nhighways,  the government  began  in  the  1990s to  build  high-speed, fully  access-controlled \nnational motorways with four or more lanes. To date, around 900 km of the planned 2,800 km \nare operational. \n \n4.  Pakistan\u2019s domestic investment and trade flows concentrate on one major north\u2013south \ntransport corridor, which connects the key centers of economic activity. Comprising national \nhighways and motorways with a total length of about 1,800 km, the corridor runs from the port \ncity of Karachi in the south, passes through primary production and population centers such as \nKhanewal,  Multan,  Muzaffargarh,  Lahore,  Faisalabad,  Islamabad,  and  Peshawar,  before \nreaching Torkham, on the northern border with Afghanistan. The economy of the area served by \nthe corridor accounts for 80%\u201385% of Pakistan's GDP. As a result of Pakistan\u2019s accession to \nthe Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program in 2010, this transport \ncorridor now forms an integral part of the CAREC corridors 5 and 6, opening a vital trading link \nbetween landlocked Central Asian nations and the country\u2019s warm-water ports of Gwadar, \nKarachi, and Port Qasim on the Arabian Sea. \n \n5.  The motorway M-4, connecting Faisalabad with Multan, will be a part of the north\u2013south \ntransport corridor. Its area of influence, which includes Faisalabad, Multan, and the entire \nPunjab  Province,  accounts for  about  56%  of  the  country's  population  and for  59%  of the \ncountry's GDP. The M-4 will extend the already completed M-1, M-2, and M-3 motorways \nsouthward and shorten the distance between Multan and the twin cities of Islamabad and \nRawalpindi in the north. The Faisalabad\u2013Gojra section (58 km) of the M-4 was completed in \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The project is included in Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2014. Country Operations Business Plan: Pakistan, \n2015\u20132017. Manila. \n ", "2 \n2014  under  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  financing,3 and  the  Khanewal\u2013Multan  section \n(57 km) will be completed in 2015 under financing from the Islamic Development Bank. \n \n6.  The proposed project will finance the construction of the 62 km Gojra\u2013Shorkot section. \nAchievement of its full benefits will depend on the completion of the remaining 64 km Shorkot\u2013\nKhanewal section, which is currently anticipated to be financed through additional financing of \nthe project in 2016.4 Upon completion, the new M-4 will provide a four-lane, access-controlled \nalternative  to  the  existing  narrow  and  congested  routes,  notably  in  the  heavily  trafficked \nFaisalabad and Khanewal\u2013Multan\u2013Muzaffargarh areas. \n \n7.  The national highway N-5 is part of the north\u2013south transport corridor, and Pakistan's \nlongest and most important highway. Its section between Lahore and Multan is a four-lane road \nthrough highly urbanized areas carrying an average daily traffic volume of 20,000 vehicles. \nCurrently, the majority of long-distance traffic from Karachi to Islamabad and onward leaves the \nN-5 after Multan to use the local road network before reaching the M-2. These two-lane roads \nare unsafe, having at-grade access points from local dwellings and businesses throughout. The \ncompleted M-4 will attract most of this long-distance traffic and also divert traffic from the N-5, \nwhich will help alleviate congestion on that road. Overall, the M-4 will provide an efficient \ninternational link between the north of Pakistan and beyond, and southern Punjab, Sindh, and \nthe ports of Karachi and Gwadar in southern Pakistan. \n \n8.  ADB has been the lead agency for road sector development in Pakistan since 2005 and \nhas coordinated its activities closely with other development partners, including the World Bank \nand the Japan International Cooperation Agency. The collaboration between the development \npartners was instrumental in transforming the NHA from a government administration to a \nservice-oriented asset manager, equipped with an effective road asset management system. \nThis is illustrated by the creation of two NHA divisions dedicated to managing the road assets \nand  improving  business  processes\u2014Environment,  Afforestation,  Land,  and  Social  (EALS) \nDivision; and Public\u2013Private Partnership Division. As the NHA embarks on the next stage of \nroad development under the government\u2019s Vision 2025, continued capacity building will be \nneeded to improve transport efficiency and quality of service. \n \n9.  Vision 2025 envisages modernization of transport infrastructure and greater regional \nconnectivity as one of the seven pillars to achieve its stated medium-term goals. 5 The project is \nconsistent with the strategic goals and government priorities. An enhanced north\u2013south corridor \nwill reduce the time and cost of moving goods and people along the entire logistic and supply \nchain, removing one of the key constraints to raising competitiveness, attracting private sector \ninvestment, increasing productivity, as well as deepening and diversifying the industrial base, all \nof which are essential for providing sustainable jobs to a growing population. The project is also \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2015\u20132019 for Pakistan6 and fits with ADB\u2019s \n                                                \n3  This section was financed under tranche 1 of the multitranche financing facility (MFF) for ADB. 2007. Report and \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche Financing Facility to the \nIslamic Republic of Pakistan for the National Trade Corridor Highway Investment Program. Manila (approved in \nDecember 2007 and to close in December 2017). Construction of subsequent sections, i.e., section 2 of Gojra\u2013\nShorkot (62 km) and section 3 of Shorkot\u2013Khanewal (64 km), was originally part of tranche 1. However, at the \nrequest of the government in September 2008, these two sections were excluded and reserved for a later tranche \nunder the MFF because of cost overruns and delays in land acquisition and resettlement compensation. In view of \nthe required versus the available construction period before the MFF closing in 2017, sections 2 and 3 are now \nbeing prepared as standalone projects outside the MFF.  \n4  ADB. 2014.

The investment demand to bring Pakistan transport infrastructure on a sustained growth \ntrajectory is huge. ADB is mobilizing additional resources to complement its own and, in June \n2015, secured a grant contribution of \u00a3262 million over 2015\u20132020 from the Government of the \nUnited Kingdom to the development of the Pakistan Economic Corridors Program. The main \nfocus of the program is to finance strategic sections of the CAREC corridors in Pakistan, which \nis  fully  aligned  with  Pakistan\u2019s  Vision  2025,  the  CAREC  Transport  and  Trade  Facilitation \nStrategy 2020, and ADB\u2019s strategic objectives. \n \n11.  ADB\u2019s leading role in Pakistan\u2019s road sector development has yielded lessons: keep \nproject  designs  simple;  limit  the  number  of  components  and  implementing  agencies  to  a \nmanageable level; make sure that cost estimates are realistic and that sufficient counterpart \nfunds are made available; and adopt realistic timeframes for land acquisition and resettlement of \naffected people. These lessons are adequately incorporated in the design of this project. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact will be the modernization of transportation infrastructure and greater regional \nconnectivity to support a vibrant and growing economy, as highlighted in Vision 2025. The \noutcome will be an efficient and safer transport corridor between Islamabad, Faisalabad, and \nMultan that enhances the connectivity between the various parts of the country. \n \nC.  Outputs \n13.  The  project  outputs  will  be:  (i)  62  km  of  four-lane,  access-controlled  motorway \nconnecting Gojra and Shorkot constructed and operational, and (ii) the safeguard and contract \nadministration capacity of the NHA strengthened. \n \n14.  Motorway construction. The proposed Gojra\u2013Shorkot section of motorway M-4 is a \nfour-lane access-controlled road facility with shoulders of 3.65 m. The design speed is 120 km \nper hour, the maximum grade is 4%. The scope of construction work includes earthwork, \nasphalt  concrete  pavement,  bridges,  crossing  structures  (underpasses  and  pipe  culverts), \ninterchanges, weigh bridges, toll plaza and rest areas, and roadside improvements and safety \nengineering features such as traffic signs, road markings, traffic barriers, guardrails, and road \nlighting. \n \n15.  Institutional capacity improvement. The project will improve the NHA\u2019s institutional \ncapacity, particularly for managing safeguards and contracts, through workshops and hands-on \ntraining provided by the social safeguard management consultant and the contract specialist \nunder  the  construction  supervision  firm.  Separately,  ADB  will  process  large-scale  capacity \ndevelopment technical assistance (TA) for the Pakistan transport sector in 2016. The capacity \ndevelopment TA of about $15 million equivalent, to be funded by the Government of the United \nKingdom and administered by ADB, will focus on (i) developing a national transport sector \npolicy; (ii) scaling up the national road asset management system, including support to the NHA \nto improve Pakistan\u2019s highway operation and maintenance (O&M) arrangements; (iii) advancing \nthe national road safety program; and (iv) strengthening transport facilitation. \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2014.

The government has requested (i) a loan of $178 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital\nresources (OCR), and (ii) a grant of \u00a358.85 million from the Government of the United Kingdom \nto help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of \n5 years, custom-tailored repayment method, an annual interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge \nof 0.15% per year (interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in the loan), \nand such other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \nBased on this, the average loan maturity is 15.99 years and the maturity premium payable to \nADB is 0.10% per annum. The grant, fully administered by ADB, will finance the civil works for \nthe project. \n18. The financing plan is in Table 2.

ADB\u2019s  financial  assistance  to  Pakistan  is  limited  in  size  relative  to  the  country\u2019s\ninfrastructure financing needs. At the same time, considerable potential exists to attract some of \nthe liquidity currently available in the domestic and regional financial markets to infrastructure to \ncomplement and leverage ADB\u2019s own lending. To this end, the government has agreed that it \nwill use best efforts to substitute approximately $100 million of the principal amount of ADB\u2019s \nOCR loan with an equivalent amount of commercial cofinancing in Pakistan rupees, on terms \nand conditions acceptable to ADB, by no later than 6 months after the effective date of the OCR ", "5 \nloan  agreement.  If  such  commercial  cofinancing  is  realized,  the  ADB  Board  of  Directors\u2019 \napproval for such an arrangement will be separately requested. \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n20. The NHA will be the executing agency. The project implementation unit (PIU) under the\nNHA\u2014which implemented the M-4 Faisalabad\u2013Gojra section and has suitably qualified staff, \nincluding  project  directors,  engineers,  and  financial  and  safeguard  specialists\u2014will  be \nresponsible for day-to-day management of the project. A general manager heads the PIU. \n21. All procurement financed under the ADB loan will follow international competitive bidding\nprocedures pursuant to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) \nand ADB\u2019s prior review. A consulting firm\u2014Renardet S.A. Ing\u00e9nieurs Conseils\u2014was recruited in \n2010  through  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  to  provide  design  review  and  construction \nsupervision services for the motorway M-4 (Faisalabad\u2013Khanewal) project (footnote 3). Given \nthat supervision for the project road is part of the original service scope and the consultant\u2019s \noverall performance is satisfactory, the NHA asked to continue the services of the consulting \nfirm for the project. Engagement of the firm on a single-source basis will be carried out in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime). \n22.

The engineering of the civil works for motorway M-4 is based on pertinent guidelines,\nstandards,  and  specifications.10 Notable  safety  design  features  include  motorway  signage, \nemergency parking areas, reflectorized lane markings, rumble strips, antiglare arrangements, \nand  arrangements  for  driving  in  fog.11 A  comprehensive  safety  audit  of  the  design  was \nconducted during the design review. A further safety audit will be carried out after completion of \nthe civil works to ensure that the designed standards are fully realized and conform to best \ninternational practices. The M-4 envisages a toll collection system, an emergency call service \nfor motorists, and a centralized operation center with close-circuit TV system. Similar to other \noperational motorways, the NHA will outsource the toll collection operations and maintenance to \nthe private sector. The National Highways & Motorways Police will enforce traffic and safety \nregulations and laws, including those applicable to vehicle overloading, speeding, and other \nviolations. Overall, the operation, management, and maintenance of motorways in Pakistan are \ndeemed efficient and effective. \n24. The engineering phase also included climate adaptation measures to manage potential\nenvironmental impacts, such as from storms and floodwater, and high ambient temperature \nduring summer. The road embankment is sufficiently high (3\u20134 m on average, increasing to 5\u2013\n6 m near underpasses and drainage structures, and 6\u20137 m near bridges) to withstand the sheet \nflows  of  the  highest  floods.  The  design  provides  adequate  cross-drainage  structures  and \nhydraulic structures over perennial water channels as well as canals and rivers. The design of \nthese  structures  took  into  account  the  flood  levels  of  the  past  100  years.  The  impact  of \ntemperature on asphaltic pavement layers is mitigated by adopting pavement specifications \nsuitable for the climate in the project area\u2014mean maximum temperature of 41oC in summer and \nminimum temperature of 4oC in winter. \nB.  Economic and Financial \n25. The economic evaluation of the project was carried out for the completion of the M-4\ncorridor and was undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Economic Analysis of \nProjects.12 The project has an economic internal rate of return of 13.2%, and a net present value \nof PRs3,754 million at a 12% discount rate. The two calculated benefits are: (i) vehicle operating \ncosts (65.8% of total benefits) and (ii) time savings (34.2% of total benefits). Lack of sufficient \ndata makes it impossible to estimate the road safety benefits. However, the move from an \nunsegregated two-lane road to a segregated four-lane road with restricted access ramps is \nlikely to yield a considerable safety dividend. The estimated rate of return on the project is \ntherefore considered conservative and the project is economically viable. \n26. The project road will be tolled after opening to traffic. Over the project life span, the\nforecast  toll  revenue  will  be  sufficient  to  cover  O&M  of  the  project  road,  contributing  an \nadditional 2% to the NHA\u2019s annual O&M budget. The Road Maintenance Fund\u2014a pool of toll \nrevenues, penalties, and other funds provided by the government and established in 2003 \nthrough Road Maintenance Account Rules\u2014is earmarked to finance O&M of the entire national \nhighway  network.

Nevertheless, the \nNHA  needs  to  strengthen  its  financial  performance  on  the  national  highway  network  by \nrationalizing its toll rates (the current tariff of about PRs1.24 per passenger car/km is considered \none of the lowest globally), and expand and implement more viable toll-based projects. The \nstrategic capacity development TA will include the preparation of a detailed action plan for \nimplementing the restructuring of the NHA\u2019s balance sheet. \n \nC.  Governance \n27.  The NHA\u2019s capacity for procurement and financial management, and for implementing \nthe project, was assessed and found to be sufficient to manage international procurement and \nto maintain the accounting systems, financial controls, and audit arrangements. Its financial \naccounting, auditing rules, and internal control systems follow generally accepted international \npractices. The NHA maintains separate project records and accounts adequate to identify the \nworks, goods, and services financed from the loan proceeds, financing resources received, \nexpenditures  incurred  for  the  project,  and  use  of  local  funds,  including  adequate  internal \ncontrols  and  financial  reporting  arrangements.  The  project  accounts  and  related  financial \nstatements  will  be  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  national  and  international  auditing \nstandards by the Auditor General of Pakistan and by a chartered accountant. \n \n28.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  NHA.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 9). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n29.  Pakistan\u2019s per capita GDP is $1,296.3 and grew by 4.0% in 2014.13 The national poverty \nrate is 33%, marked by urban\u2013rural disparity (18% urban and 46% rural poverty incidence), \nwhile 21% of the population is below the extreme poverty line. The Punjab (where the project is \nsituated) is among the least-poor provinces in Pakistan with a poverty incidence of only 19% \n(national level: 21%). Within the province, however, poverty levels are uneven\u2014the southern \npart has an above-average incidence compared with a relatively lower incidence observed in \nthe northern districts. The project alignment passes through two districts of central Punjab, i.e., \nToba Tek Singh, with a poverty headcount index of 10%, and Jhang at 26% (2012). The main \ndirect  beneficiaries  of  the  project  will  be  the  local  population,  transport  operators,  freight \nforwarders, and those trading in agricultural products, as better connectivity through M-4 will \nenable access to markets countrywide and thus lead to better socioeconomic networking and \neasier access to health, education, and social facilities. \n \n30.  The project design includes traffic signs, markings, fencing, underpasses, and controlled \nexit\u2013entry traffic at interchanges, which will boost the connectivity of inhabitants along both \nsides of the M-4 while improving road safety. It will produce several other benefits such as lower \ntransportation costs, shorter travel times, and shorter shipment times for edible and perishable \nagricultural products, all of which will ultimately contribute to sustainable economic growth. \nDiversion of freight and intercity traffic from existing national highways to the project motorway \nwill reduce congestion and aid traffic flow, and boost the safety of local communities in the area. \nDuring construction, the local population will benefit from short-time jobs, and opportunities to \nsell food and goods to construction workers. The roadside rest areas with amenities for both \ngenders will allow the local population to sell produce, food, and drinks to travelers. \n                                                \n13 Country Economic Indicators (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n ", "8 \n31.  The  prevalence  rate  of  HIV/AIDS  in  the  country  is  0.10%  (2011)  and  considered \nrelatively low. However, the risk of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections is always \na concern because the main reasons for their prevalence are sexual transmissions and unsafe \ninjections, practices that are not sufficiently discussed and regulated, particularly not in rural \nareas.14 Further, during and after implementation, region-wide population movements across \nthe project areas are expected and may increase the risk of human trafficking. Such risks will be \nmitigated by conducting awareness campaigns targeting workers and local populations during \nimplementation.  The  contractor  will  be  required  to  conduct  these  campaigns,  under  the \noversight of the construction supervision consultant and the NHA, and such requirement will be \nincluded in the bid documents and contracts for civil works. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n32.  Environment. Since the M-4 alignment passes through undisturbed agricultural land \nand given the large scale of the operation, the project has been categorized A for environment. \nIn 2007, as required by ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002), an environmental impact assessment \n(EIA) report was prepared and approved for the entire M-4. Subsequently, the EIA report was \nupdated  to  meet  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  new \nnational legal requirements, and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website in July 2014. The revised EIA \nincorporates environmental management costs, new public consultations, and also includes an \nassessment of the cumulative impacts of the complete M-4 motorway project. This updated EIA \nwas posted on ADB\u2019s website in August 2015. The project design has factored in climate \nchange risks and mitigation measures as well as community concerns. \n \n33.  The environmental impacts identified are largely concentrated in the construction phase. \nSoil erosion, dust, and noise impacts are likely to be significant. Noise impacts will persist into \nthe  operational  phase.  The  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  includes  measures  to \nminimize  anticipated  impacts  during  construction  and  operation.  Prior  to  construction, \ncontractors will update the EMP into a site-specific environmental management plan (SSEMP). \nThe SSEMP will be based on a risk assessment approach to select impact- and site-appropriate \nmitigation measures such as barriers for construction and operational noise. The construction \nsupervision  consultant,  the  EALS  Division  of  the  NHA,  and  ADB  will  closely  monitor  the \nimplementation  of  the SSEMP.  The  NHA  will  submit  semiannual  environmental  monitoring \nreports to ADB for disclosure on the ADB website. \n \n34.  The EALS Division is headed by a general manager and supported by the director \n(environment) who is in charge of EMP implementation. Three environmental deputy directors \nare each responsible for different projects. The deputy director for this project will make sure \nthat the provisions of the SSEMP are implemented. Capacity building at the EALS environment \nsubdivision, and of the contractors and supervision consultants will also be conducted by ADB\u2019s \nCentral and West Asia Department, through its ongoing TA for Sustainable Environmental \nManagement of Projects in Central and West Asia.15 \n \n35.  Involuntary resettlement. The project is classified as category A since it will affect \n36 villages  and  3,674  households  by  displacing  26,762  people.  Of  these,  213  people  in \n29 households will either be physically displaced or lose 10% or more of productive assets. \nLand acquisition and resettlement activities have been substantially completed. The NHA has \nprepared and submitted to ADB the final land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) based \n                                                \n14 Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Inter-Provincial Coordination. 2012.

The LARP was disclosed on ADB\u2019s \nwebsite on 15 July 2015. Public consultation and information disclosure were undertaken while \npreparing the LARP, including displaced people and the communities along the project road. \nConsultation and information sharing will continue throughout project implementation. \n \n36.  Resettlement activities will be managed and implemented by the NHA, through PIU, and \nsupported by the EALS Division and the social safeguard management consultant. The PIU has \ndemonstrated  capacity  for  implementing  involuntary  resettlement.  A  functioning  grievance \nredress mechanism has been established. Internal monitoring reports will be prepared by the \nPIU  and  social  safeguard  management  consultant,  and  included  in  the  quarterly  progress \nreports of the supervision consultant. A qualified and experienced external monitoring agency \nwill verify the executing agency's monitoring reports, monitor LARP implementation, identify \nissues, and recommend corrective measures. \n \n37.  Indigenous peoples. The project is classified as category C since the project road is \nlocated in the settled areas of Punjab Province, where no indigenous peoples as defined under \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement reside. No indigenous communities will be affected by the \nproject and, accordingly, no indigenous peoples planning documents are required. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n38.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.16 The project procurement classification is \ncategory B. Overall, the risks are deemed manageable by adopting mitigating measures, and \nthe integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs of mitigation. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nWeak financial  The NHA has requested the government to equitize the debt and clean its \nmanagement  balance sheet, and will (i) expand the toll base, rationalize tolls, and allocate the \narrangements for  revenue to the road maintenance fund; and (ii) expand PPP-based road \nroad sector  construction to reduce the government subsidy.a Capacity development technical \nmaintenance  assistance will help build capacity and carry out analytical work, underpinned by \nongoing ADB policy dialogue to prepare and implement the sector reform \nagenda. \nDelayed land  The NHA has largely completed land acquisition and resettlement for the project. \nacquisition and  An independent land valuation study has been carried out to identify any price \nresettlement, and  differential and ensure compensation at full replacement cost in accordance with \ninadequate  the approved land acquisition and resettlement plan. \nsafeguard  The external monitoring agency for land acquisition and resettlement has started \narrangements  its independent evaluation; and the social safeguard management consultant has \nbeen recruited and will mobilize once the civil works commence. \nDuring construction, the NHA and the construction supervision consultant will \nimplement the environmental management plan, monitor the implementation \nprocess, and regularly submit to ADB their safeguard monitoring reports. \nCost overruns, e.g.,  Project cost estimates are based on completed detailed design and the most \nbecause prices of  recent unit prices of similar civil works. \ncommodities and  Adequate contingencies are budgeted in the project investment to account for \nraw materials rise  any unforeseen factors; and a technical auditor will be engaged to review design \nmore than budgeted  changes when necessary. \nLate completion of  Detailed design of the remaining Shorkot\u2013Khanewal section completed; the NHA \nthe remaining M-4  has started land acquisition and resettlement for the section as well as advance \n                                                \n16 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nShorkot\u2013 Khanewal  procurement preparation. \nsection  The government included ADB financing for the Shorkot\u2013Khanewal section in the \ncountry operations business plan, 2015\u20132017. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, NHA = National Highway Authority, PPP = public\u2013private partnership. \na  Tolls and other revenues amount to 20% of the NHA\u2019s road construction and maintenance expenditure.
