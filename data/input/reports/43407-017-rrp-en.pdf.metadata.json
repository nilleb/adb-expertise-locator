The Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, or Republic Act No. 11469 (Bayanihan Law),2 which \nwas signed into law on 24 March 2020, empowers the government to provide an ECA of \u20b15,000\u2013\n\u20b18,000 per month for 2 months to around 18 million low-income households / families nationwide.3 \nThe  Department  of  Social  Welfare  and  Development  (DSWD)  and  the  local  government  units \nhave been designated as the key agencies through which the ECA will be delivered. The SPSP-\nAF  II  will  build  on  the  decade-long  support  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  the \ngovernment\u2019s  Pantawid  Pamilyang  Pilipino  Program  (4Ps),  which  provides  conditional  cash \ntransfers  (CCTs)  to  improve  the  health  and  education  of  nearly  4.28  million  households \nnationwide. This proposed EAL will fund part of the ECA to these 4Ps households so that they \ncan cope with the unfolding economic, health, and social costs of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \n3. \n4Ps: Design and conditionalities. The 4Ps was launched by the government in 2008 to \ntarget poor households and help them improve the education and health of their children, as a \npathway out of poverty.4 The CCTs are as follows: (i) for the education grant, for 10 months each \nyear, the 4Ps households receive \u20b1300 per month for children in elementary or secondary school, \n\u20b1500 per month for children in grades 7\u201310, and \u20b1700 per month for children in grades 11\u201312, \nprovided the children attend at least 85% of classes each month;5 and (ii) for the health grant, the \n4Ps  households  receive  a  fixed  amount  of  \u20b1750  per  month  for  12  months  (irrespective  of  the \nnumber  of  children),  provided  they  fulfill  the  following  conditions:  (a)  pregnant  women  avail \nthemselves  of  pre-  and  post-natal  care,  and  are  attended  during  childbirth  by  trained  health \nprofessionals; (b) parents attend regular family development sessions; (c) children aged 5 years \nand under receive regular preventive health check-ups and vaccination; and (d) children aged 6\u2013\n14 years receive deworming pills biannually. Households exit from the  4Ps either when all the \nchildren enrolled for education grants reach 18 years of age and/or graduate out of senior high \nschool,6 or if they fail to comply with the conditions despite repeated reminders. \n \nADB\u2019s past engagement. On 2 September 2010, ADB approved the Social Protection \n4. \nSupport  Project  (footnote  1)  for  $400  million  to  support  the  government\u2019s  social  protection \nprogram through CCTs under the 4Ps. On 9 February 2016, ADB approved the first additional \n\n \n\n1   ADB. 2010. Philippines: Social Protection Project. Manila. The original loan became effective on 12 January 2011 \nand closed  financially  after full  disbursement on  5 June  2017;  ADB.  2016.  Philippines:  Social  Protection  Support \nProject (Additional Financing). Manila. \n\n2   Accessible at https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/downloads/2020/03mar/20200324-RA-11469-RRD.pdf  \n3   The Bayanihan Law will remain in effect only for 3 months unless extended by the Congress of the Philippines.  \n4   Initially,  only  those  households  below  the  poverty  line  with  children  younger  than  14  years  old  and/or  pregnant \nwomen, as identified by the National Household Targeting System for Poverty Reduction in  2009 (Listahanan 1), \nwere included under the 4Ps. With the launch of the kindergarten to grade 12 Program (which extended school from \ngrade 10 to grade 12) by the Department of Education in 2015, the 4Ps raised the age cap of children from 14 to 18 \nyears to enable them to complete senior high school. \n\n5   Each 4Ps household can register up to three eligible children for the education grant. \n6   Based on the operations manual of the 4Ps, if the child beneficiary turns 19 during the school year, he or she shall \n\ncontinue to receive education grants until the end of that school year.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nfinancing  of  SPSP  (SPSP-AF  or  the  ongoing  project)  (footnote  1)  for  $400  million  to  support \nexpansion of the 4Ps. The DSWD served as the executing agency for the SPSP, the SPSP-AF, \nand the associated technical assistance grants. \n \nGood  performance  of  SPSP-AF.  The  SPSP-AF\u2019s  outcome  is  increased  household \n5. \nconsumption and increased utilization of education and health services by 4Ps families, especially \nmothers  and  children.  The  outputs  are  (i)  national  targeting  system  to  select  poor  families \nimplemented efficiently, (ii) conditional health and education cash grants provided to poor families, \n(iii)  capacity  for  CCT  program  operations  strengthened,  and  (iv)  systems  for  monitoring  and \nevaluating social protection programs improved. The SPSP-AF is performing well, with project \nperformance rated on track annually since loan effectiveness in 2016. By 8 January 2020, the \nentire additional financing of $400 million had been disbursed. The project has no technical issues \nand has satisfactorily achieved most of its expected results. School attendance of 4Ps children \n(aged  3\u201318  years)  was  95.8%  as  compared  to  the  target  of  90.0%.  About  83.7%  of  pregnant \nwomen delivered their babies in health facilities, exceeding the target of 70.0%. Nearly 85.21% \nof births were delivered by skilled health personnel.7 The project has consistently complied with \nsafeguards  and  financial  covenants.  The  SPSP-AF  was  scheduled  to  close  on  30  June  2020. \nHowever, the government, in its letter dated 28 March 2020 to the ADB President, requested for \na  second  additional  financing  to  be  processed  on  a  fast-track  basis  to  support  the  DSWD  in \nproviding  the  ECA  to  4Ps  households  nationwide.  The  SPSP-AF  II  meets  all  of  the  eligibility \ncriteria for additional financing including (i) satisfactory implementation progress, (ii) satisfactory \ncompliance with safeguard policy requirements, (iii) successful management of risks, and (iv) a \nrating of highly satisfactory or satisfactory in the project performance ratings. \n \nThe  COVID-19  pandemic  is  an  unprecedented  global  emergency.  While  there  has  not \n6. \nbeen any destruction of physical infrastructure as is normally experienced during natural hazards \nor non-natural disasters, the economic, health, and social disruption caused by the pandemic is \nunparalleled (paras. 7\u20138). By providing immediate, short-term transitional assistance in the form \nof an ECA, the EAL will support the DSWD in addressing the urgent basic needs of the poor 4Ps \nhouseholds whose livelihoods have been disrupted. ADB is coordinating with other development \npartners including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Government of Australia, \nthe International Labour Organization, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, the World Bank, and \nthe World Food Programme.8  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n7. \nAdverse impact of COVID-19 outbreak. As in many other countries around the world, \nthe  Philippines\u2014and  particularly  its  poor  and  vulnerable  people\u2014has  been  hit  hard  by  the \nCOVID-19 pandemic.9 It poses a very high health risk for the elderly and for those with underlying \nhealth problems. As of 18 April 2020, the Philippines had recorded 6,087 COVID-19 cases, with \n397  deaths.  The  government  declared  community  quarantine  covering  the  National  Capital \nRegion (NCR) on 15 March 2020. This was extended to the entire island of Luzon on 17 March \n\n \n\n7   Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8   For details refer to Emergency Assistance Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9  The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-2019 outbreak a public health emergency of international \n\nconcern in 30 January 2020. On 12 March 2020, the WHO declared it to be a global pandemic. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\n2020. This quarantine has subsequently been extended until 30 April 2020.10 The Office of the \nPresident of the Philippines has declared a state of calamity for the country until 17 September \n2020. As a result of the community quarantine, factories have shut down, malls and restaurants \nclosed, supply chains cut, and public transportation halted. While the Philippine economy grew at \na  steady  average  annual  rate  of  6.5%  during  2012\u20132019,  growth  is  expected  to  be  adversely \naffected  by  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Projections  made  by  the  National  Economic  and \nDevelopment Authority of the Philippines show that the quarantine could reduce gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) growth to potentially negative levels in 2020.11 \n \n8. \nPotential increase in poverty, hunger, and other vulnerabilities. While the poverty rate \nin the Philippines declined from 25.2% in 2012 to 23.3% in 2015 and to 16.6% in 2018,12 absolute \npoverty and inequality remain high. Nearly 17.6 million people continue to live under the poverty \nline.  Approximately  14.2  million  live just  above  the  line  and  are  vulnerable  to  sliding  back  into \npoverty.13 Due to to the sudden loss of livelihoods due to the quarantine, the poor, indigent elderly \nand informal sector workers and daily wage laborers have lost their livelihoods. They have limited \ncash  and  are  unable  to  purchase  adequate  food  and  other  basic  necessities.  With  the  loss  of \nincome and growing food insecurity, compounded by the health risk and cost of COVID-19, the \nprospects for these poor households are very grim. Unless addressed on an emergency basis, \nthis could roll back the progress made by the Philippines in its fight against poverty. Since the \nCOVID-19 pandemic has unfolded, the DSWD has identified approximately 6.5 million poor and \nvulnerable households and 2.9 million indigent senior citizens as beneficiaries of  the proposed \nECA based on different targeting protocols.14 In addition, it is estimated that there are around 7.7 \nmillion  informal  sector  workers  and  daily  wage  earners  nationwide. 15 The  DSWD  has  issued \nguidelines to implement the Social Amelioration Program mandated by the Bayanihan Law. \n \n9. \nVulnerable  segments  \u2013  4Ps  households.  The  4Ps  program  targets  4.4  million \nbeneficiaries  covering  eligible  poor  households  with  children  0\u201318  or  with  pregnant  women, \nhomeless street families, families in need of special protection, and indigenous peoples. As of 29 \nFebruary  2020,  there  were  4.28  million  active  households  nationwide  under  the  4Ps.  Around \n85.3% of these households are headed by female grantees. There are 643,414 indigenous people \nhouseholds  (i.e.  15.0%  of  total  active  4Ps  households).  Approximately,  202,000  (4.7%) \nhouseholds have a person with disability. In all, 7.8 million children aged 3-18 years old children \n(51.7% females) are registered under the 4Ps. Given the reach of the 4Ps, providing ECA to these \nhouseholds is a top priority of the government, and will be supported under the proposed loan. \nThere is a distinct risk that some of the gains achieved under the 4Ps CCT interventions over the \nyears may get rolled back if these households are not given ECA to meet their food, medicine, \nand other basic needs during this crisis.   \n \n10. \nChoice of modality. Building on ADB\u2019s ongoing 4Ps support through additional financing \nwill be faster and more effective in reinforcing the government\u2019s emergency COVID-19 response \n\n \n\n10   Local governments in Visayas and Mindanao have followed suit and imposed \u201cenhanced community quarantine\u201d \nmeasures, including in regional economic hubs and tourism sites (e.g., Cebu, Iloilo, Bohol, Boracay, Leyte, Davao, \nCagayan de Oro, and Bukidnon), which will further impact poor and vulnerable people in these island groups. \n11   National Economic Development Authority. 2020.

The proposed SPSP-AF II meets all eligibility criteria for \nan EAL (para. 11).16 It will be limited only to the transition phase of the government\u2019s COVID-19 \nresponse,  and  will  support  the  DSWD  in  providing  immediate  and  short-term  transitional \nassistance to the poor 4Ps households whose livelihoods have been disrupted by the COVID-19 \npandemic and quarantine measures. The loan will have a one year implementation period (i.e., \nfrom April 2020 to April 2021). The SPSP-AF II will use DSWD\u2019s targeting mechanisms and time-\ntested cash delivery systems to provide the ECA to approximately 3.67 million 4Ps households \n(out of the total 4.28 million 4Ps households) that have cash cards issued by the Land Bank of \nthe Philippines (LBP). The DSWD continues to have strong ownership of the ongoing SPSP-AF.  \n \n11. \nEmergency  assistance  loan  eligibility.  The  proposed  SPSP-AF  II  meets  all  eligibility \nrequirements  for  an  EAL  as  laid  down  under  the  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy \n(footnote 18):  \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\nthe government\u2019s request for assistance has been received (para. 5), \nthe potential impact on social needs and priorities has been identified in a damage \nand needs assessment,17 \nthe  COVID-19  pandemic  involves  significant  economic  dislocation  and  the \nproposed EAL is intended to address immediate needs, \nno security risks to ADB staff are anticipated, and \nthe level of burden and risk sharing among the stakeholders is appropriate. \n\nProject Description \n\n \nB. \n \n12. \nThe proposed SPSP-AF II is aligned with the following impact: income poverty and non-\nincome poverty reduced.18 The outcome of the overall project will remain the same:  household \nconsumption and the use of education and health services by 4Ps households (especially mothers \nand children) are increased. The project will support this outcome through the output described \nin para. 13.  \n \n13. \nUnconditional ECA for 4Ps households having cash cards delivered on time. The \nSPSP-AF  II  will  fund  ECA  of  between  \u20b15,000  and  \u20b18,000  ($98.30  - $157.30)  per  month  for 2 \nmonths to 3.67 million 4Ps households who have cash cards.19 The specific amount of the ECA \nper household will depend on the region and the prevailing minimum wage there. The DSWD will \nrequire nearly $726.1 million to provide ECA to all 4Ps households nationwide for a period of 2 \nmonths. Of this, $637.1 million will be required for the 86% of 4Ps households (i.e., 3.67 million) \nwhich have cash cards. ADB will fund $200 million of this amount.  \n \nC. \n \n14. \nADB  is  supporting  the  government  in  responding  to  the  unprecedented  social  and \neconomic disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic through several channels. First, ADB approved \na $3 million grant on 14 March 2020 to help procure critical medical supplies and equipment to \n\nValue Added by ADB \n\n \n\n16  ADB. 2004. Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy. Manila (para. 92). \n17  Summary Assessment of Damages and Needs (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18  National  Economic  and  Development  Authority.  2017.  Philippine  Development  Plan  2017\u20132022.  The  impact \n\nstatement is unchanged. \n\n19 The LBP and its conduits, along with the DSWD, organize over-the-counter CCT payments for the 4Ps households \nwho don\u2019t have cash cards. However, because of the quarantine, this arrangement cannot be used. The DSWD is \ndelivering ECA via local government units to these households. Since it will not be possible for ADB to undertake \nfiduciary assessment of the local government units, the second additional financing project will be restricted to the \n86% of 4Ps households (around 3.67 million) with cash cards.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nhelp with COVID-19 treatment.20 Second, ADB approved a $5 million technical assistance project \non  31  March  2020  to  support  the  government  by  leveraging  private  sector  participation  in \nproviding essential food supplies to about 55,000 poor households in the NCR and neighboring \nareas.21 This grant has been provided as \u201cbridge support\u201d until the provision of the ECA through \nSPSP-AF  II  and  other  assistance  from  the  government.  Third,  the  proposed  Expanded  Social \nAssistance Project (ESAP) in the amount of $500 million will continue ADB\u2019s decade-long support \nfor the 4Ps CCT program till 2023.22  \n \nFourth, ADB is designing an EAL to address the immediate needs of improving COVID-\n15. \n19 surveillance, infection prevention, control measures, and diagnostic and treatment capacity. It \nwill also support medium- and long-term investments for future pandemic preparedness. Fifth, the \nproposed COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support Program ($1.5 billion) will support \ncritical public spending, help finance the government\u2019s COVID-19 response and relief packages, \nand support counter-cyclical fiscal stimulus.23  \n \n16. \nADB has been supporting the DSWD\u2019s social protection programs, which include the 4Ps \nand  community-driven  development.  In  collaboration  with  the  DSWD  and  other  development \npartners,  ADB  has  helped  to  strengthen  the  national  household  targeting  system,  enhancing \ninstitutional capacity, developing credible monitoring and evaluation systems, and generating and \ndisseminating knowledge. Having demonstrated positive results over the years, these programs \nare well-placed to support collective efforts to mitigate the adverse impact of COVID-19 on poor \nand vulnerable households. \n \nD. \n \n17. \nThe overall project is estimated to cost $637.1 million (Table 1). ADB will partly finance \nexpenditures related to providing the ECA to approximately 3.67 million 4Ps households which \nhave cash cards. \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plans \n\n \nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n13.7 \n6,353.3 \n\n635.2 \n\n \n \n\n635.2 \n \n \n \n \n\nItem \nA.

The 4Ps National Program \nManagement Office will continue to remain as the implementation unit. A financial management \nassessment has been undertaken as part of the due diligence process. Since the loan will provide \nurgent cash support to alleviate the immediate economic and financial hardships faced by poor \nand  vulnerable  households,  it  will  have  a  1-year  implementation  period  with  full  disbursement \nexpected. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail \nin the project administration manual. \n\n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n\nApril 2020\u2013April 2021 \n30 April 2021  \n31 October 2021 \n\n24   Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nSecretary, DSWD (chair) \nRelevant undersecretaries and assistant secretaries (members) \n\n \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nEstimated loan closing date \nManagement \n\n(i)  Oversight body \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nAspects \n\n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies \n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \nConsulting services \nRetroactive financing  \n\nDisbursement  \n\nArrangements \n\nDSWD \nPantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program NPMO and RPMO \nNPMO (15 managerial staff) and RPMO (17 managerial staff), supported by \ncontractual staff \nNot applicable \nNot applicable \nWithdrawals  from  the  loan  account  may  be  made  to  finance  eligible \nexpenditures incurred in connection with the ECA to about 3.67 million 4Ps \nhouseholds  that  are  paid  via  cash  card  under  the  project  before  the  loan \neffectiveness, provided that the expenditures for the ECA have been incurred \nafter the emergeny occurred but not earlier than 12 months before the date \nof the loan agreement and up to 30% of the loan proceeds. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  following  ADB's  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed between the government and ADB.   \n\n4Ps = Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program, ADB = Asian Development Bank, DSWD = Department of Social Welfare \nand  Development,  ECA  =  emergency  cash  assistance,  NPMO  =  National  Program  Management  Office,  RPMO  = \nRegional Program Project Management Office. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\n \nA. \n \n21. \nA  detailed  technical  review  of  the  DSWD\u2019s  targeting  protocol,  payroll  preparation,  and \npayments mechanism for making the ECA to 4Ps households with cash cards has been made. \nThe funds will be released through the LBP, using the same cash cards which are used for paying \nCCTs to 4Ps households. This arrangement is quite robust and time tested. \n \nB. \n \nA standard economic rate of return analysis does not have to be done for this additional \n22. \nfinancing.25 Since the proposed SPSP-AF II will utilize the DSWD\u2019s existing targeting protocol and \ncash-card-based  delivery  system  for  the  4Ps,  the  marginal  cost  for  distributing  the  ECA  is \nnegligible. The ECA will help the 4Ps households with cash cards smooth out their consumption \nof  food  and  other  basic  needs  and  help  to  cope  with  this  unprecedented  crisis.  Since  poor \nhouseholds  have  a  higher  marginal  utility  of  consumption  than  the  general  population,  this \nredistribution  will  be  enhance  overall  welfare. The  economic  benefits  are  substantial  while  the \ncosts are negligible, thus, indicating a high economic rate of return. \n \n23. \nShort-term  GDP  growth  is  likely  to  contract  substantially  because  of  the  quarantine \nmeasures.  The  project\u2019s  contribution  is  approximately  4.7%  of  the  total  cost  of  emergency \nassistance  for  4Ps  and  non-4Ps  beneficiaries  (estimated  at  $4.2  billion)  and  31.4%  of  the \nassistance provided to active 4Ps beneficiaries with cash cards. The national government\u2019s debt \nhad been declining since 2010. While it will be impacted by the crisis, there are adequate fiscal \nresources to absorb increases in government spending for the ECA. \n \nC. \n \n24. \nThe Bayanihan Law is a temporary emergency measure (footnote 3) under which the ECA \nwill be urgently provided to 4Ps households to help them meet their food and other basic needs. \n\nSustainability \n\n25   Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of link documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nGovernance \n\n Poverty, Social, and Gender \n\nThe government\u2019s 4Ps program has been institutionalized through Republic Act No. 11310 in April \n2019.26 ADB\u2019s proposed ESAP for $500 million will extend support for the CCTs until 2023.  \n \nD. \n \n25. \nThe  government  continues  to  strengthen  its  public  financial  management.  Significant \nimprovements  in  transparency,  policy-based  budgeting,  and  asset\u2013liability  management  have \nbeen  made  since  the  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability  assessment  of  2007. 27 \nHowever, budget reliability, accounting and reporting, and external audit remained weak and are \ncurrently  being  addressed  by  the  government.  At  the  4Ps  level,  the  premitigation  financial \nmanagement  risk  is  rated  substantial.  The  Commission  on  Audit  conducts  annual  audit  of  the \n4Ps.  Most  observations  are  resolved  within  the  fiscal  year.28 The  DSWD  has  a  good  financial \nmanagement  system  with  internal  controls  for  its  programs.  It  has  extensive  experience  of \nundertaking  large-scale  programs  and  working  with  multiple  development  partners.  Technical \nassistance  support  is  being  provided  by  ADB  to  further  strengthen  the  DSWD\u2019s  financial \nmanagement system.29 With this support, the risk is moderate. \n \nE. \n \n26. \nThe key  causes  of  poverty  and  vulnerability  include  high  inequality  of  income, \nunderinvestment in human capital, catastrophic health expenditure, and frequent natural hazards. \nThe poverty rate in the Philippines declined from 25.2% in 2012 to 16.6% in 2018. Despite this \ndecline, absolute poverty and the risk of vulnerability remain high, especially with the rapid spread \nof  the  COVID-19  across  the  Philippines.  The  expanded  quarantine  from  mid-March  2020  has \ndeprived not only the poor but also informal sector workers, including daily wage workers of their \nlivelihoods. They are now finding it difficult to pay for food, medicines, and other basic necessities. \nThe  project  is  categorized  as  having  a  gender  equity  theme  as  the  COVID-19  crisis  may \npotentially  aggravate  inequality  and  disproportionately  impact  poor  people,  especially  poor \nwomen. Of the 4.28 million 4Ps households, 85.3% are headed by female grantees. Key gender \nissues include (i) income loss since many poor women work in informal sectors as daily wage \nearners; (ii) increased negative social behavior including heightened gender-based violence as a \nresult  of  anxiety  and  stress  around  loss  of  employment,  disease  transmission,  and  forced \nconfinement; and (iii) disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on women because of their roles as \nprimary household and family caregivers. \n \nF. \n \n27. \ncategories are as follows.30 \n \n28. \nactivity with potential adverse environmental impacts. \n \n\nEnvironment (category C).

The project is categorized B as it will have positive \nimpact on indigenous households by providing them with the ECA to help cope with this crisis. Of \nthe total active 4Ps households, 643,414 (15%) households are those of indigenous people. An \nindigenous people\u2019s plan (IPP) has been prepared following the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement \non  indigenous  peoples  safeguards.31 The  plan  specifies  safeguard  provisions  to  be  monitored \nduring project implementation to ensure that indigenous peoples can access and receive benefits \nfrom  project  activities.  The  SPSP-AF  II  will  ensure  that  indigenous  peoples  are  aware  of  the \nadditional support provided by the government during the COVID-19 pandemic. The IPP specifies \nsafeguard  provisions  to  be  monitored  during  project  implementation  to  ensure  that  indigenous \npeople  are  not  excluded  from  the  list  of  grantees  for  additional  cash  grants  and  other  health \nservices. It provides guidance to ensure that indigenous people are consulted and aware of the \nsupport  provided  by  the  government  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  The  IPP  specifies  that \nindigenous communities will be provided with relevant and adequate information on how to protect \ntheir families from infection. It will ensure culturally appropriate and gender-sensitive consultation \nprocesses  are  used  when  engaging  tribal  leaders,  indigenous  communities,  and  indigenous \npeoples representatives. \n \nG. \n \n31. \nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.32 There are no high risks to this project. \n \n\nSummary of Risks and Risks Management Plan \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Risk Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nWidespread COVID-19 infection and \nassociated enhanced community quarantine \naffect the 4Ps payment delivery mechanisms, \ne.g., processing of payroll, LBP \ndocumentation, and release of funds. \nHousehold grantees have limited access to \nATMs because of community quarantine \nmeasures. \nNPMO and other DSWD field staff \noverstretched because of the high workload \nand work-from-home arrangements.  \n\nMitigating Measures \nPayroll and grant allocations will be prepared while awaiting the \nfund releases from the DBM.
