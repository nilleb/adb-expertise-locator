Through \ntechnical  assistance  from  provincial  councils,  LAs  will  apply  for \nfinance from the Local Loans and Development Fund (LLDF). The \nProject  also  involves  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity \nin  urban \nbuilding  of  state,  provincial,  and \nmanagement  and  urban  service  provision,  as  well  as  poverty \nreduction initiatives developed through stakeholder participation.     \n \nThe huge influx of mostly poor migrants into cities and towns has \noverwhelmed  infrastructure  systems  originally  designed  for  much \nsmaller  populations.  With  limited  infrastructure  and  services,  the \nold  and  new  urban  centers  are  not  capable  of  adequately \nsupporting  the  increasing  economic  productivity  of  households. \nThe  urban  poor  suffer  disproportionately  from  bad  environmental \nsanitation,  resulting  in  illness  caused  by  water-  and  vector-borne \ndisease.  Urban  service  deficiencies  include  deteriorated  roads, \ninadequate  supplies  of  potable  water,  and  poor  drainage  and \ndomestic sanitation. The vast majority of urban residents still rely \non  septic  tanks  or  have  no  sanitation  facilities;  only  23%  of \nhouseholds  have  sewerage  connections.  Uncontrolled  dumping \nand low collection levels of solid waste add to these problems.       \n \nThe  expected  impact  of  the  Project  is  increased  growth  potential \nof  and  reduced  poverty  in  urban  centers  of  Sri  Lanka.  The \nexpected  outcome  is  improved  quality  of  life  for  urban  residents, \nincluding  the  poor  and  the  disadvantaged,  and  enhanced  urban \nproductivity in at least 68 urban towns. \n \nThe estimated project cost is $66.7 million equivalent, comprising \nforeign  exchange  costs  of  $21.1  million  and  local  currency  costs \nequivalent  to  $45.6  million,  including  taxes  and  duties  of  $7.7 \nmillion.   \n \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\nCost Estimates \n\n \n\n \n\n\f iv \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nSource \n\nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \nLocal Authority \nTotal \nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n($ million equivalent) \nPercent \n(%) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n21.1 \n                  0  \n                0\n21.1 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n28.9 \n12.0 \n4.7 \n45.6 \n\nTotal \nCost \n50.0 \n12.0 \n  4.7 \n66.7 \n\n75.0 \n18.0 \n   7.0 \n100.0 \n\nfrom \n\nthe  Special  Funds  resources  of \n\n \n \nA  loan  of  SDR34,496,000  {$50.0  million  equivalent}  will  be \nthe  Asian \nprovided \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB).  The  loan  will  have  a  32-year  term \nincluding  a grace  period  of  8  years,  and  an  interest  rate  of  1.0% \nper  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter.  For  the  basic  infrastructure  credit  line,  the  Ministry  of \nFinance  and  Planning  will  provide  funding  to  LLDF  through  a \nSubsidiary  Loan  Agreement  on  terms  and  conditions  satisfactory \nto  ADB.  LLDF  will  transfer  the  money  partially  as  loans  and \npartially  as  grants  to  LAs  through  Subloan  agreement  and  grant \nagreements  on  terms  and  conditions  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The \nsubborrowers will receive the loans at the prevailing market-based \nrate  based  on  Sri  Lanka  Inter-Bank  Offer  Rate  (SLIBOR)  12-\nmonth  average.  The  rate  will  be  reviewed  twice  every  year  in \nJanuary and July. \n \n31 October 2011 \n \n30 April 2012 \n\n \nMinistry of Provincial Councils and Local Government  \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Provincial  Councils  and  Local  Government \n(MPCLG) will set up a project coordination unit, led by a full-time \nproject  director  with  experience  in  handling  externally  funded \nprojects  and  local  government  infrastructure  issues.  The  unit  will \n(i) consolidate the overall project implementation plan and annual \nwork  plan,  (ii)  assist  the  provincial  councils  in  implementing  the \npolicy  support  program,  (iii)  monitor  and  supervise  project \nadministration and coordination activities, (iv) organize monitoring \nand  evaluation  exercises,  and  (v)  prepare  necessary  project \nreports and the project completion report.  \n \nA  project  appraisal  unit  will  be  established  within  LLDF.  The  unit \nwill  (i)  assist  LAs  in  meeting  the  requirements  for  funding \nactivities,  (ii)  review  the  eligibility  of  LAs  for  grant-funding  for \ninfrastructure,  (iii)  compile  annual  data  on  the  technical  and \nfinancial  performance  of  LAs,  and  (iv)  manage  disbursements  of \nfunds to LAs. \n \nIn  each  of  the  eight  provincial  councils,  at  the  office  of  the \ncommissioner  of \n(CLG),  a  Subproject \ncoordination unit will be set up, headed by the CLG. The unit will \n\nlocal  government \n\n\f \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\nv\n\nthe \n\nif  required;  (iv)  undertaking \n\nbe  responsible  for  (i)  preparing  an  annual  development  program \nfor  the  respective  province;  (ii)  accounting  for  expenditures;  (iii) \nimplementing  resettlement  plans  and  ensuring  environmental \nmitigation  measures \ninitial \nevaluation  of  LA  Subproject  proposals;  (v)  managing  project \ndevelopment assistance available to LAs for project identification, \nfeasibility studies, and implementation; (vi) managing the funds for \nLA  support  for  the  development  of  business  plans  and  the \nfinancial  and  local  improvement  plan,  (vii)  providing  assistance \nand  support  to  LAs  with  weak  capacity  in  implementing  civil \nworks; \n(viii)  conducting  project  quality  assurance,  and \nperformance monitoring and evaluation. \n \nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  under  the  Project  will  be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement \nand  the  Government\u2019s  tender  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB. \nLocal  procurement  will  be  the  preferred  mode  for  all  project \nactivities. None of the Project\u2019s civil works contracts are expected \nto exceed $500,000 in cost. Local competitive bidding procedures \nacceptable to ADB will be followed with bidding periods of at least \n21  days.  Equipment  and  materials  will  be  procured  under \ninternational competitive bidding where the estimated cost is more \nthan  $500,000  equivalent,  by  international  shopping  where  the \nestimated cost is between $300,000 and $500,000 equivalent and \nthrough  local  procurement  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  where \nthe  estimated  cost  is  $300,000  equivalent  or  less.  Minor  items \ncosting less than $100,000 equivalent may be purchased through \ndirect purchase. \n \nConsulting \nproject \nimplementation and to strengthen the institutional, administrative, \nand  financial  capacities  of  LAs  and  LLDF;  236  person-months  of \ninternational  and  580  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  will \nbe  required.  Consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  by \nAsian  Development  Bank  and  Its  Borrowers,  using  the  quality- \nand  cost-based  selection  method  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the selection and engagement of domestic \nconsultants. \n \nThe  main  benefits  of  the  Project  will  be  (i)  an  increasingly  more \ncapable  and  accountable  local  government  governance  system; \n(ii)  a  foundation  for  sustainable  and  reliable  urban  services;  and \n(iii)  improved  economic  and  social  conditions  in  the  participating \nLAs from investments in roads, drainage, community water, solid \nwaste management, and other basic urban facilities and services \n(including sanitation).  \n \nThe  Project  will  benefit  several  groups.  Households  and \nbusinesses will benefit from a more accountable, responsive, and \nempowered \nfrom \nimprovements  in  urban  services  and  investments,  and  in  the \n\nlocal  government,  as  well  as  directly \n\nrequired \n\nservices \n\nfacilitate \n\nare \n\nto \n\n \n\n\fRisks and Assumptions \n\n vi \n\n \n\nfrom \n\ninvestments \n\nin  environmental \n\nurban environment. Elected LA governments will gain from having \ntheir  legitimacy  enhanced,  as  a  result  of  their  improved  ability  to \nprovide  services,  and  from  greater  financial  and  managerial \nautonomy.  The  urban  poor  will  obtain  health  and  productivity \nbenefits \ninfrastructure \n(drainage,  community  water,  solid  waste  management,  etc.),  as \nthey suffer disproportionately from the ill effects of the lack of such \nservices. Finally, predominantly local private contractors and their \nworkers,  as  well  as  suppliers,  will  benefit  from  the  flow  of  more \nthan  $42.6  million  in  contracts  for  municipal  civil  works  and \nequipment over the 6 years of the Project. About 4 million people, \nthe  population  of  at  least  68  new  municipalities,  will  benefit  from  \nthe capacity-building component.    \n \nGiven the innovative design adopted in the Project, where LAs will \nbe  responsible  for  identifying  and  preparing  Subprojects  and \nwhere  the  strengthened  LLDF  will  appraise  credit  worthiness  of \nLAs  and  viability  of  Subprojects,  inherent  risks  need  to  be \nmonitored carefully throughout project implementation. At present, \nLAs lack experience to prepare Subproject proposals for external \nfunding.  Similarly,  LLDF's  role  as  a  fully  functioning  financial \nintermediary  is  new;  in  the  past  it  served  mainly  as  a  debt \ncollector  for  MPCLG.  Under  the  Project,  however,  the  roles  and \nfunctions of LAs and LLDF are expected to go through substantial \nchange.  LAs  need  to  develop  a  sense  of  ownership  for  the \nSubprojects  they  will  develop.  LLDF  will  have  to  be  reborn  as  a \ncompetent financial intermediary to efficiently channel the financial \nresources  made  available  under  the  Project  to  LAs.  Foreseen \nrisks include (i) lack of awareness and suitably qualified personnel \nin LAs and the CLG office to assume the new responsibilities; (ii) \ninsufficient  support \nthe  envisaged \nfrom  policymakers \ntransformation of LAs and LLDF; (iii) poor performance of LAs in \nrepaying the LLDF loans, which may trigger the use of guarantees \nby provincial councils, and (iv) political interference in Subproject \nselection. These risks are mitigated to the greatest extent possible \nby  (i)  ensuring  LLDF\u2019s  readiness  prior  to  subloan  disbursement \nunder  component  B  through  a  tailored  institutional  strengthening \nprogram  for  LLDF;  (ii)  clearly  defined  eligibility  conditions  and \nSubproject  approval  criteria;  (iii)  carefully  designed  awareness \nand  capacity-building  programs  for  LAs  and  provincial  councils; \nand  (iv)  increased  supervision,  through  a  supporting  technical \nassistance project and regular loan review missions. \n \nSubproject  selection  will  prioritize  rehabilitation  of  existing  basic \nurban  infrastructure  over  new  construction  involving  small-  to \nmedium-scale  civil  and  building  works  at  sites  previously  or \ncurrently  used  for  the  same  or  similar  purposes.  The  Subproject \nselection  criteria  rules  out  Subprojects  classified  as  environment \nsafeguard  category  \u201cA\u201d  or  \u201cB  sensitive.\u201d  The  Project  is  not \nexpected to result in significant land acquisition and resettlement, \nor to have adverse impact on indigenous people.  \n\nfor

\n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Local  Government  Infrastructure \nImprovement Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nSri  Lanka  has  a  relatively  high  population  density  of  295  people  per  square  kilometer \n(km2), greater than that of the Philippines or Viet Nam. The country\u2019s high population density is \na major factor in the Government\u2019s economic development strategy, industrialization policy, and \nsupport of medium- and small-sized towns. The current urban population is about 5 million; 1.5 \nmillion reside in Colombo. The prolonged conflict and low productivity in rural areas have had a \nsevere  impact  on  urban  centers.  Many  rural  people  fled  to  urban  areas,  which  in  some  cases \nhave grown by 300% during the past two decades. Urban migration has converted some small \nrural towns to urban centers. On average, the urban population is growing nearly twice as fast \nas  the  rural  population.  The  urban  population  now  represents  about  27%  of  the  national  total \nand  is  still  growing  rapidly,  at  nearly  6%  per  year  compared  with  a  total  national  population \ngrowth rate of around 1%. The degree of urbanization is projected to reach 45% by 2015.  \n \n3. \nCondition  of  Urban  Areas.  With  limited  infrastructure  and  services,  the  old  and  new \nurban centers are not capable of adequately supporting the increasing economic productivity of \nhouseholds.  Living  conditions  in  urban  centers  are  poor  for  most  residents.  The  urban  poor \nsuffer disproportionately from poor environmental sanitation resulting in illness caused by water- \nand  vector-borne  disease.  Urban  service  deficiencies  include  deteriorated  roads,  inadequate \nsupplies  of  potable  water,  and  poor  drainage  and  domestic  sanitation.  Poverty  incidence  in \nurban areas stood at 8% in 2002. The vast majority of urban residents still rely on septic tanks \nor have no sanitation facilities; only 23% of households have sewerage connections; and of the \ntotal  58,350  km  of  local  authority  (LA)  roads,  25-40%  are  in  very  poor  condition  and  may  not \nmeet national standards. Uncontrolled dumping and low collection levels of solid waste add to \nthese problems.  \n \n4. \nInadequate  Local  Infrastructure  Services.  The  prolonged  political  situation,  financial \nconstraints, and 20 years of civil strife have impeded LA provision of essential public services. \nThe  difficult  conditions  have  also  hampered  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  Major \nurban deficiencies include (i) most towns have intermittent piped water supply services provided \nby  the  National  Water  Supply  and  Drainage  Board  (NWSDB);  (ii)  areas  without  piped  waste \nschemes are serviced by tubewells; many are run privately or through community schemes and \nthus  have  different  tariffs;  (iii)  most  tertiary  roads  are  in  a  complete  state  of  disrepair;  (iv) \ndrainage  problems  are  fairly  widespread;  encroachment  into  low-lying  paddy  fields  and  river \nbasins  is  rampant;  (v)  very  few  LAs  have  a  systemized  waste  management  system;  waste \ncollection  is  generally  carried  out  manually,  is  not  separated,  and  is  dumped  on  public  roads \ndue to lack of proper collection space; (vi) only Colombo has a piped sewerage system; and (vii) \nprimary LA health care facilities are limited due to weak capacity and financial resources.  \n \nB. \n \nCreation  of  Provincial  Councils.  In  Sri  Lanka,  devolution  was  perceived  as  an  exit \n5. \nstrategy  from  civil  conflict  in  the  north  and  the  east.  In  1987  the  Government  took  a  major \ninitiative for decentralization through the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which led to \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n \n\n\f 2 \n\nthe  creation  of  an  additional  tier  of  government,  the  provincial  councils,1  in  1988.  The \namendment  carved  out  a  provincial  sphere  of  governance,  specifying  an  area  of  legislative, \nexecutive,  and  financial  competence  to  be  exercised  by  the  councils.  Article  154  in  the \nConstitution  contains  three  lists  of  competencies:  the  responsibilities  of  the  center  (Reserved \nList),  the  provinces  (Provincial  List),  and  an  area  of  overlapping  responsibilities  (Concurrent \nList).  Through  this  process,  institutions  of  local  self-government  that  had  operated  under  a \ncentralized  system  became  a  devolved  subject  of  the  provincial  council.  The  operational \naspects,  such  as  LA  operation  and  administration,  were  assigned  to  the  provinces.  However, \nthe  central  Government  retains  powers  over  LAs,  providing  technical  support  for  planning, \nappraisal, procurement, and management.  \n \n6. \nThree  Types  of  Local  Authorities.  Sri  Lanka  has  three  types  of  LAs  under  the \nprovincial councils: (i) municipal councils constituted in cities and large towns, (ii) urban councils \nfor  less  urbanized  areas,  and  (iii)  pradeshiya  sabhas  created  in  periurban  and  rural  areas.  All \nthree  have  separate  enabling  laws  providing  the  legal  and  policy  environment  for  local \ngovernment institutions to operate and function. The three types of LAs are created, regulated, \nand operated by three different ordinances.  \n \n7. \nResponsibility of Local Authorities. LAs, being created by Parliament, are subject to \ngeneral supervision and control by the Government through the Ministry of Provincial Councils \nand  Local  Government  (MPCLG).  Following  the  devolution  system,  the  LAs  are  placed  under \nthe  provincial  councils.  In  the  present  system,  provincial  councils  cannot  reduce  the  existing \npowers  of  LAs,  and  if  necessary,  LAs  can  be  vested  with  additional  powers.  Numerous  laws \nconfer powers to LAs on various aspects of local administration, such as the Local Government \nService Ordinance and the Urban Development Authority Act. The main powers and functions of \nLAs are described in their respective acts and ordinances. For example, they have the power to \nacquire  land,  enter  into  contracts,  raise  funds,  purchase  material  and  equipment,  and  employ \nstaff. But their main responsibility is to provide conveniences and well-being to the community. \nConsequently, they are responsible for providing physical infrastructure such as roads, drains, \nparks,  libraries,  and  housing;  and  for  promoting  public  health.  Hence,  this  Project  fits  with  the \ndecentralized  system  currently  in  place,  and  aims  to  strengthen  LA  powers  to  improve  the \nprovision of basic infrastructure services in their respective areas.2 \n \nPhysical  Planning  and  Legal  Framework.  Seven  laws3  govern  the  existing  legal \n8. \nframework  of  urban  planning  and  land  management.  Urban  planning  involves,  among  others, \nthe Urban Development Authority operating in UDA \u201cdeclared\u201d areas, and Board of Investment \nwith  overriding  powers  for  board-approved  projects  and  areas.4  NWSDB  is  the  main  agency \nresponsible for water supply and manages over 75% of piped water schemes, especially areas \ndependent on NWSDB water sources. LAs operate and maintain the remaining schemes, often \nreceiving  bulk  treated  water  from  NWSDB.  LAs  are  responsible  for  communal  water  supply \n(e.g., tubewells); in some cases, to achieve full cost recovery, the water tariffs are higher than \nthe NWSDB national tariff.   \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Originally, nine provincial councils were organized, but in 1991, the north and east councils were suspended, and \n\nmerged as a single entity, resulting in eight provincial councils.  \n\n2   This Project will be part of ADB\u2019s ongoing support to strengthening Sri Lanka\u2019s governance, as referred to in ADB. \n2004.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Fiscal Management Reform Program. Appendix 14 (page 81). \nManila.  \n\n3  They  include  Urban  Development  Authority  Law,  No.  41  of  1978;  Town  and  Country  Planning  Ordinance  (as \n\namended in 2001); and Provincial Councils Act, No. 42 of 1987. \n\n4  Other agencies, such as Ceylon Tourist Board and Coast Conservation Department have planning authority over \n\ncertain territories/land use in the country.  \n\n\f \n\n3\n\n9. \nLimited Local Resource Mobilization and Local Loans and Development Fund. LA \nsources  of  revenue,  especially  for  recurrent  expenditure,  are  low.  In  2003,  about  36%  of  the \ntotal recurrent revenue for municipal councils was provided as a government grant, and about \n42%  in  the  case  of  urban  councils  and  pradeshiya  sabhas.5  Sources  of  revenue,  along  with \nshared  taxes  and  grants,  are  inadequate  to  meet  the  needs  of  basic  urban  infrastructure \nservices.  The  main  revenue  sources  include  the  stamp  duty  levied  on  property  and  other \ntransactions,  and  the  assessment  tax  levied  on  the  deemed  value  of  property  and  rents.  The \nacreage tax levied by the pradeshiya sabhas is gradually decreasing, due to large tracts of land \nbeing converted to housing use. Recurrent expenditures are increasing and now represent an \naverage  of  70%  of  total  expenditures.  Of  these,  over  40%  are  consumed  by  personnel  costs. \nConsequently, spending on maintaining LA assets is a low proportion of total expenditure, and \nLAs are unable to afford new investment in basic urban services. Although provincial councils \nhave  extensive  revenue  authorities,  in  reality,  revenues  available  to  them  are  limited.  On \naverage, provincial councils\u2019 own-source revenues account for only 10% of their expenditures. \nRecurrent expenditure is financed by own recurrent revenues and from a revenue grant (block \ngrant) funded by the central Government. The Local Loans and Development Fund (LLDF) was \ncreated in 1916 to improve access to financing for local capitalized repairs. LLDF is a statutory \nbody  operating  under  MPCLG  (Appendix  2).  Its  main  functions  include  granting  and \nadministering  loans  for  investment  in  LA  infrastructure  development  and  revenue-generating \nprojects. Except for MPCLG supervision and control, LLDF is not under any control or subject to \nregulations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.6  \n \n10. \nInstitutional  and  Staff  Capacity.  Another  factor  fundamental  to  sustainable  urban \ndevelopment is the LA institutional framework and staff capacity. LAs should be fully responsible \nand accountable for providing local services. Although Sri Lanka has a large bureaucracy, the \nlevel  and  quality  of  local  staff  is  generally  not  high.  In  2004,  almost  1  million  public  servants \nwere  employed  by  all  levels  of  government;  63%  were  employed  by  the  central  Government, \n32%  by  provincial  councils,  and  5%  by  LAs.7  LAs  need  to  improve  their  human  resource \ncapabilities,  particularly  in  financial  management  and  technical  skills  to  manage  infrastructure \nunder its control. Except for Colombo and other larger municipal councils, LAs have few senior \nengineers, planners, or financial specialists, although the larger LAs do have midlevel technical \npersonnel. The Project will provide technical consultants to fill in the gaps and help LAs develop \nsolid Subprojects proposals. During the Project, the technical consultants\u2019 input will be gradually \nreduced;  LA  technical  staff  are  expected  to  assume  responsibility  for  preparing  Subproject \nproposals.      \n \n11. \nExternal Assistance and Lessons Learned. Several externally funded projects in the \narea of urban infrastructure have been implemented during the past decade (Appendix 3). The \nSustainable Cities Programme of the United Nations-Habitat and United Nations Development \nProgramme evolved into the Urban Governance Support Programme (2004\u20132005). It provided \ncapacity-building support to the Urban Development Authority and some selected municipalities. \nPilot  projects  in  solid  waste  management  have  produced  tangible  progress  in  the  areas  of \ngarbage  collection  and  communal  participation,  and  instilled  confidence  in  LA  staff  and  local \ncommunities concerned. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been the major development \npartner  in  the  urban  sector  in  recent  years.  ADB\u2019s  Urban  Development  and  Low-Income \n\n                                                 \n5   Capital  and  recurrent  combined:  For  local  authorities,  between  50%  and  60%  of  total  expenditure  (capital  and \ncurrent)  is  from  own  revenues  (61%  for  municipal  councils,  56%  for  urban  councils,  and  55%  for  pradeshiya \nsabhas).  \n\n6  As on 31 December 2004, the total amount of loans granted to LAs was SLRs377 million. LLDF keeps a margin on \n\ninterest to cover its overhead, thus causing no burden to the Treasury. \n\n7  ADB.  2004.  Review  of  Governance  and  Public  Management  for  Sri  Lanka.  Manila.  More  than  60%  of  provincial \n\nemployees are primary and secondary school teachers. \n\n \n\n\f 4 \n\ntaken  up  due \n\nHousing (Sector) Project8 is evaluated as satisfactory; 97% of the loan has been disbursed and \nprincipal  output  targets  achieved.  However,  three  of  nine  subsectors  identified  in  the  24  core \nSubprojects9  were  not  subsequently \nto  difficulties  encountered  during \nimplementation.  Commercial  facilities,  such  as  bus  terminals  and  traffic  improvements  were \nprovided  and  put  into  use;  however,  other  basic  infrastructure,  such  as  water  supply  and \nsanitation  components  did  not  fully  meet  the  expectations  of  the  provincial  councils  and  LAs \nconcerned.  \n \n12. \nProject  Development  Process.  A  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA) \nprepared  the  proposed  Project.  A  series  of  consultations  were  held  with  MPCLG,  all  eight \nparticipating  provincial  councils,  and  participating  LAs.  Project  design  incorporates  lessons \nlearned (para. 11): setting out clear plans for institutional strengthening and implementation of \nthe delivery of basic urban infrastructure that local populations actually demand and are willing \nto  maintain.  The  Project  is  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  development  priorities  and  ADB\u2019s \ncountry  strategy  and  program  (2004\u20132008)  to  improve  infrastructure  and  services  provision, \nparticularly  water  supply  and  sanitation.  These  constitute  a  basic  human  right;  representing  a \ncrucial  factor  in  preventing  illness  and  raising  universal  health  status.  Following  the \nstakeholders\u2019 discussion, wherein a detailed questionnaire was circulated to all LAs. Responses \nwere  received  from  189  LAs  representing  nearly  two  thirds  of  the  eligible  LAs.  Based  on  the \nscores  from  the  questionnaire  and  a  decision  by  the  second  Steering  Committee  meeting,  68 \npriority  LAs  were  selected  (Appendix  4).  Local  government  capacity  building  is  needed  to \nprioritize and commit investment. The most critical strategic choice made by the project design \nis to place modest capital directly in the hands of the LAs and to allow them to decide on the \nsubsectors  and  support  them  to  enhance  their  powers  to  collect  revenues,  which  falls  under \ntheir existing rights.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n13. \nThe expected impact of the Project is increased growth potential of and reduced poverty \nin the selected LAs of Sri Lanka. The expected outcome is improved urban environments, long-\nterm improvement of the economy, and improved living conditions for the LA population outside \nColombo.  The  Project  will  (i)  improve  urban  management,  planning,  and  financing  capacity  of \nthe  sector  institutions,  especially  LAs,  to  ensure  sustainable  provision  of  urban  infrastructure \nand services; (ii) enhance urban livelihoods; and (iii) increase Government and LA staff capacity \nfor administering urban infrastructure supply and maintenance works. \n \nB. \n \n14. \nThe  Project  will  comprise  three  components.  Component  A:  provincial/municipal/urban \nmanagement  improvement,  includes  three  key  areas:  (i)  infrastructure  development  planning \nand financial management support to LAs (Financial and Local Improvement Plans), (ii) Project \nDevelopment  Assistance  (PDA)  support  to  provincial  councils,  and  (iii)  strengthening  of  LLDF \nfund  management.  Component  B:  basic  local  government  infrastructure  and  services  delivery \nwill  improve  LA  infrastructure  and  services,  namely  (i)  community  water  supply;  (ii)  roads;  (iii) \ndrainage and community sewerage; (iv) solid waste management; and (v) basic health clinics, \npublic  libraries,  and  recreational  parks  through  finance  provided  by  LLDF.  Component  C: \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                 \n8   ADB.  1998,  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Urban Development and Low-Income Housing (Sector) Project,  \nManila. The project was completed in June 2005; the loan account closing is expected in 2005.  \n\n9   Solid waste management, sites and services, and guided land development \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nSpecial Features \n\ncapacity building and implementation assistance covers project coordination and administration \nfor MPCLG, provincial councils, LAs, and LLDF.   \n \nC. \n \nLA  Demand-Based  Project.  The  Project  represents  a  shift  in  ADB\u2019s  approach  from \n15. \nsupply-driven central Government-led investment to a more decentralized approach of providing \nLAs with the decision-making role. LAs will identify, design, and apply for Subproject finance to \nLLDF.  Subprojects  are  not  predefined  at  the  feasibility  study  stage.  The  aim  is  for  LAs \nthemselves to plan the improvement of their basic infrastructure and living conditions (Appendix \n5 provides the urban sector analysis). The approach shift stems from lessons learned from ADB \nand other foreign-aided projects, with the Government\u2019s decentralization initiatives. Investment \nprograms for LA infrastructure should be implemented by LAs in the interest of building capacity \nthrough learning by doing and promoting sustainable investment. Many provincial councils and \nLAs  stated  during  the  project  preparatory  TA  that  they  were  not  involved  in  the  design  for \nbuildings and facilities provided through previous projects, because they were prioritized by the \ncentral  agency  from  Colombo.  When  a  typical  externally  financed  project  ends,  the \ninfrastructure will often deteriorate, because no budget is set aside at the LA, and the LA has no \nkeen  interest  in  maintaining  it,  because  those  facilities  were  not  local  top  priorities.  In  this \nProject,  provincial  councils  and  LAs  will  have  a  say  in  the  decision  making  on  Subproject \nidentification, formulation, and implementation. Provincial councils will have the responsibility of \nrecovering loans and interests due from their LAs and ensure repayment. Provincial councils will \nhave authority to recover/intercept funds due to any defaulting LA for repayment of loans under \nthe Project. \n \nLA  Infrastructure  Financed  by  LLDF  and  Project  Development  Assistance.  LLDF \n16. \nwill provide credit, which is mixture of grant and loan. The Government is strongly committed to \nLLDF  as  the  primary  vehicle  for  financing  local  infrastructure,  and  this  Project  will  support \nMPCLG\u2019s  efforts  to  strengthen  LLDF  to  fulfill  its  mandate.  Preliminarily  financial  management \nassessment  and  due  diligence  were  conducted.10  Further  LLDF  capacity  building  (including  a \nbusiness  plan  and  finance  operational  guidelines),  necessary  guidelines,  comprehensive \nfinancial due diligence reports, and relevant legal documents will be prepared in the early stage \nof the Project and separate TA.11 PDA will be provided to the target 68 LAs of all 8 provinces.12 \nThe consultative approach for Subproject design is the key principle for designing the Project, \nas  well  as  a  bottom-up  approach  to  strengthen  LAs  to  plan,  develop,  and  finance  urban \ninfrastructure. This will lead to the improvement of local government performance to their local \nconstituencies.  \n \nD. \n \n\nComponents \n\n1. \n\nComponent A: Provincial/Municipal/Urban Management Improvement \n\ninfrastructure  Subprojects \n\n \n17. \nComponent  A  will  provide  in-service  training  to  provincial  councils,  LAs,  and  LLDF \nofficials and staff. It will assist LAs in providing reference kits for provincial council and LA staff \nto  prioritize \nlocalities,  compile  Subproject  proposal \napplications,  and  prepare  Financial  and  Local  Improvement  Plans  (FLIPs).  The  FLIPs  will \nconsider  ways  to  improve  provincial  council  and  LA  financial  management  as  well  as  ensure \nsocial and environmental safeguard compliance.13 A significant part of the capacity building will \n                                                 \n10   Appendix 2 and supplementary appendixes I and J provided details.  \n11   Subject to ADB approval within 2005 \n12  However, this does not prevent other non-shortlisted LAs from attending workshops and training in the Project. \n13  These include guidance on (i) National Voluntary Resettlement Policy and Environmental Impact Assessment Law, \n\ntheir \n\nin \n\n(ii) resettlement framework, and (iii) Indigenous Peoples Development Framework.   \n\n \n\n\f 6 \n\nbe contracted out to private and nongovernment entities such as universities. This component \nwill include training in basic infrastructure planning and budgeting, as well as basic engineering \n(design and supervision) skills needed by LAs/provincial councils and LLDF.  \n \n\na. \n\nLocal Authority Capacity Building \n\n \n\nb. \n\nfor  revenue  enhancement  and \n\nProvincial Council Capacity Building \n\n \n18.  \nLA  Financial  and  Local  Improvement  Plan.  The  FLIP  will  be  introduced  as  a \nmechanism for LAs to identify and implement simple initiatives that can be taken up by the LAs \nwithin their existing legal and regulatory framework. Funding under the FLIP will be as a grant to \nLAs  through  their  respective  provincial  councils.  LAs  participating  in  the  Project  will  be \nencouraged  to  develop  and  adopt  an  action  plan  that  outlines  concrete  steps  with  clear \nmilestones to increase their revenue base. The FLIP will precede capital investment in the LA \nand  address  the  issue  of  Subproject  sustainability.  The  action  plan  will  serve  as  the  LA\u2019s \ncommitment  to  undertake  identified  reforms  while  it  implements  an  infrastructure  Subproject, \nduring which it has to achieve predefined milestones. The thrust of the FLIP will comprise two \ncomponents:  an  action  plan  and  milestones \nfinancial \nmanagement. Through an overall review of current revenue and cost analysis, LAs will develop \nan action plan and targets for improved governance and financial management based on their \nneeds.  For  instance,  while  one  LA  may  need  support  to  improve  tax14  administration  and \nrecovery, another LA may need support for updating accounts or setting up a complaint redress \nsystem.15  MPCLG  intends  to  replicate  the  FLIP  initiative  across  LAs  in  Sri  Lanka  beyond  the \nProject. LAs can also avail of a small amount of seed money for experimenting with innovative \ninitiatives  for  urban  infrastructure  and  service  provision,  provided  that  those  proposals  have \nlinkages to LLDF financing during the Project.16  \n \n \n \n19. \nIn each of the eight provincial councils, the Project will provide capacity-building support \nthrough  the  office  of  the  commissioner  of  local  government  (CLG),  which  will  include  (i) \nassessment  of  LA  Subproject  implementation  performance;  (ii)  development  of  a  citizen\u2019s \ngrievance  redress  system  on  infrastructure  deficiency,  operation,  and  maintenance;  and  (iii) \nPDA support.  \n \nProject  Development  Assistance.  Low  capacity  of  provincial  councils  and  LAs  to \n20. \nformulate, develop, and implement infrastructure projects was identified as a major impediment \nto  the  provision  of  improved  services.  The  Project  aims  to  provide  assistance  through  PDA  at \neach of the provincial councils, using three international TA advisers. Each adviser will cover up \nto three provincial councils. These teams of consultants will serve as a \u201chelp desk\u201d to cater to \nany need from an LA office or provincial council\u2019s Subproject coordination unit (SPCU) offices \nfor \nfinancial  management  (including  FLIP  assistance)  and  general  day-to-day  project \ndevelopment.  Gradually,  the  expertise  and  skills  of  the  consultants  will  be  transferred  to \ninput  being  reduced  by  50%  during  project \nprovincial  council  staff,  with  consultant \nimplementation.  Provincial  council  staff  will  be  able  to  take  over  the  support  function  for  LA \nproject development. A user-friendly operations manual will be prepared for use by the borrower \nLAs  and  the  evaluator,  i.e.,  LLDF.  Details,  which  cover  eligibility  criteria,  borrowing  capacity, \nflow of funds, conditions in subloan and grant agreements, and procurement guidelines will be \nincluded.  At  each  provincial  council,  a  funding  pool  will  be  set  up  for  hiring  international  and \nnational advisers. Provincial councils will develop a consultant roster comprised of mostly local \n                                                 \n14  For example, property tax, land tax, and stamp duty (para. 9).  \n15  A FLIP will have a shortlist of easily verifiable standard performance indicators against which the participating LAs \n\nwill be evaluated for eligibility under component B.  \n\n16  Separate  criteria  for  \u201dcommunity  innovation  funding\u201d  will  be  set  up  in  the  first  year  through  FLIP  assistance.  The \n\nFLIP formulation and implementation plans are the most important conditions for this funding.  \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nexperts,  such  as  university  faculty  (e.g.,  urban  planning  and  infrastructure  design)  and \nprofessional members (e.g., chartered engineers and accountants). The prepared proposals will \nbe screened by the provincial councils, be subject to provincial council endorsements, and be \nsubmitted  to  LLDF.  Although  the  provincial  councils  will  manage  PDA,  the  LAs  will  be  the \nprimary beneficiaries.  \n \n\nc. \n\nLLDF Strengthening \n\nimprovement  of  existing \n\nfunctions,  and  strengthen \n\n \n21. \nAssistance  to  LLDF.  The  role  of  LLDF  under  the  Project  is  (i)  to  provide  financial \nresources  to  LAs  for  small-  and  medium-sized  infrastructure,  equipment,  and  consulting \nservices;  (ii)  to  examine  LA  capacity  to  plan,  implement,  and  manage  basic  infrastructure \ninvestments, and to integrate the associated expenditures (LA contributions to the investment, \noperation, and maintenance costs) and revenues into their budgets; and (iii) to enhance LLDF \nitself  to  develop  a  solid  foundation  for  a  sustainable,  expandable  LA  infrastructure  financing \nmechanism. To initiate this process, LLDF will have to prepare a time-bound business plan for \nperformance \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s primary financial intermediary (as defined in ADB\u2019s Operation Manual D6/OP of \n23  December  2003)  in  the  LA  infrastructure  finance  sector  in  Sri  Lanka.17  This  will  include \npreparation  of  an  operations  manual  outlining  credit  and  grant  appraisal  requirements,  and \nfinancial  projections.  A  preliminary  financial  management  assessment  and  financial  analysis \nfound LLDF to be financially sound.18 LLDF has a very low administration cost on lending. Upon \ncompletion  of  a  business  plan,  operational  manual,  codes  of  conduct,  and  associated  model \nagreements;  and  once  the  project  appraisal  unit  is  set  up;  ADB  will  field  a  review  mission  to \nassess the readiness of LLDF to commence financing operations under component B. \n \nStudy on a Future LLDF Role. Once component B disbursement is on track according \n22. \nto  the  projected  schedule,  special  studies  will  be  conducted  for  developing  a  credit-rating \nmechanism  to  evaluate  the  creditworthiness  of  LAs.  This  may  expand  to  developing  and \nmanaging  a  separate  grant  window  for  non-revenue-generating  projects  and  treasury \nmanagement  and  credit  enhancements,  such  as  provincial  guarantees,  escrows,  and  debt-\nservice reserve funds as potential future functions of LLDF.   \n \n\nits  capacity  as \n\n2. \n\nComponent B: Basic Local Government Infrastructure and Service Delivery  \n\n \nFor  component  B  investments,  each  LA,  with  guidance  and  support  from  its  provincial \n23. \ncouncil,  will  prepare  a  Subproject  application  comprising  a  package  of \ninfrastructure \nimprovements.  After  LLDF  approves  a  Subproject  application  (para.  41),  the  LA  will  receive  a \nmixture  of  grant  and  loan  from  LLDF  for  infrastructure  and  service  delivery.  Sector  details, \ndetailed  selection  criteria,  and  Subproject  appraisal  process  are  given  in  Appendix  4.  The \nfollowing components will be eligible for financing under each Subproject:  \n \n\na. \n\nCommunity Water Supply \n\n \n24. \nThe Government aims to achieve full water supply for the population by 2010. The World \nBank estimates that around 98% of the urban  population and 70% of the rural population has \naccess  to  safe  water.  However,  studies  undertaken  in  the  project  preparatory  TA  reveal  that \n\n                                                 \n17  A  separate  advisory  TA  will  be  provided  for  LLDF  to  reorient  its  functions  and  operations  in  view  of  the  new \nresponsibilities mandated under the Project. A new business plan as well as a comprehensive operations manual \nwill be developed for approval by LLDF\u2019s board. The manual will include (i) a lending policy on which component B \nwill  be  disbursed,  and  (ii)  a  human  resource  strategy  upon  which  the  recruitment  of  new  staff  members  will  be \nbased.  Once  the  overall  operational  framework  is  developed  under  the  TA  and  new  staff  recruited,  additional \ncapacity building will be provided under the Project (component A).   \n\n18  Supplementary appendixes H and I.  \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\naccess to safe drinking water range from 10% to 55% in most LAs. Only a few schemes operate \n24 hours a day, and most schemes provide service ranging from a few hours every other day to \n12  hours  a  day.  This  intermittent  service  is  frequently  due  to  a  lack  of  water  resources,  or \ninadequate  expansion  of  the  scheme  to  meet  demand.  The  main  technical  options  for  water \nsupply  under  the  Project  are  (i)  groundwater  wells  with  hand  pumps,  (ii)  rainwater  harvesting, \n(iii)  piped  systems  with  overhead  tank,  and  (iv)  gravity  pipe  system.  Typically,  20\u201350%  of  the \nlocal population in a town do not have water supply services. Extension and rehabilitation of the \nexisting piped supply, and construction of new schemes as appropriate to serve the remaining \n20\u201350%  of  the  unserved  population  through  both  spring  and  tubewell  sources,  will  be  part  of \nthis subcomponent.19 \n \n\nb. \n\nLocal Authority Roads \n\n \nLAs  are  responsible  for  construction  and  maintenance  of  class  D,  E,  and  other \n25. \nunclassified  roads,  which  are  primarily  tertiary  roads.20  Generally,  tertiary  roads  are  of  poor \nquality, with the degree of quality inversely related to the class; almost all LAs lack technical and \nfinancial resources. The Subprojects will include rehabilitation and repair of existing roads within \nthe urban core area and improvement of traffic management. Provincial councils will take a lead \nrole  in  developing  and  implementing  the  works  for  intermunicipality  road  link  (class  D) \nimprovements  across  neighboring  LA  boundaries.  The  Project  will  prioritize  rehabilitation  of \nexisting gravel roads over new road construction.  \n  \n\nc. \n\nLocal Authority Drainage and Communal Sewerage \n\n \n26. \nDrainage  problems  are  fairly  widespread.  With  the  increase  in  urbanization  more \nsurfaces are paved and impermeable areas are enlarged, thus increasing both the volume and \npeak  rate  of  runoff.  Older  drains  and  culverts  are  inadequate  and  need  to  be  expanded  and \ncapacity increased. Low-lying towns experience the worst problems, but even LAs in hill areas \nreport problems. Equipment needs are frequently cited. Improved urban planning is fundamental \nto solving drainage and flood control problems, with work including (i) elimination of blockages, \nobstructions, and encroachments on existing drainage paths; (ii) construction of new drains to \nserve  previously  unserved  areas;  and  (iii)  construction  of  missing  links.  Some  municipalities \nmay  opt  for  repair  and  improvement  of  existing  sanitation  systems.  Most  LAs  rely  on  septic \ntanks and pit latrines because construction of proper sanitation facilities is difficult due to high \nwater  tables  and  rock  outcrops.  Poor  conditions  reflect  institutional  problems  and  insufficient \nawareness of the importance of a clean and pleasant environment for sound livelihood, tourism, \nand other socioeconomic interests.   \n  \n\nd. \n\nSolid Waste Management \n\n \n27. \nSolid  waste  management  services  are  generally  available  in  urban  areas,  but  in  a \nmanner that is rudimentary, unsightly, and potentially hazardous to health and the environment, \nespecially  in  low-income  areas.  Lack  of  disposal  facilities  is  critical  in  most  LAs.  Solid  waste \nmanagement  systems  supported  by  the  Project  will  need  to  be  consistent  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  recently  adopted  National  Solid  Waste  Management  Strategy.  This  component \nwill improve collection efficiencies of household wastes and other (commercial, institutional, and \nhazardous medical) wastes within the core urban areas, and ensure improved arrangements for \ndisposal.21   \n \n\n                                                 \n19  Tariffs will be levied at full cost recovery (recurrent from outset, and capital overtime) for community water supply.  \n20  The Road Development Authority is responsible for the national highway network (category A) and some category \n\nB roads.   \n\n21  A solid waste collection and disposal tariff will be levied for full cost recovery.  \n\n\f \n\n9\n\ne. \n \n\nBasic Health Clinics, Pubic Libraries, and Recreational Parks \n\n3. \n\nComponent C: Project Coordination and Administration Support \n\n28. \nSmall municipal facilities to be provided under this component will be identified through \nintensive  consultation  between  the  LA  and  the  local  population  during  implementation.  This \ncomponent  will  be  developing  basic  health  clinics;  public  libraries;  small  recreation  parks;  and \nLAs institutional infrastructure with ADB\u2019s prior approval  \n \n \n \nThis  component  will  cover  incremental  administration  costs  and  counterpart  staff  of \n29. \nMPCLG, provincial councils, and LAs. It will also include some consulting services to (i) provide \nadministration  and  coordination  support \nfor \nto \nimplementation  of  project  components,  including  the  development  and  implementation  of  the \nproject  performance  management  system  (PPMS);  (ii)  assist  SPCUs  in  supporting  the  LAs  to \nbuild  project  awareness;  (iii)  strengthen  the  national  steering  committee  (NSC);  and  (iv) \nimplement  and  enhance  community  development  strategies,22  particularly  for  prioritizing \nSubprojects and maintaining infrastructure.23 \n \nE. \n \n30. \nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $66.7 million equivalent (including taxes of \n$7.7 million), of which $ 21.1 million (31.6%) is the foreign exchange cost including $1.3 million \nin  interest  charges  during  construction,  and  $45.6  million  equivalent  (68.4%)  is  the  local \ncurrency cost.

Tools  to  Support \nParticipatory Urban Decision Making. Colombo).       \n\n23  Participatory  mechanisms  embedded  in  the  Project  are  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  initiative  for \n\ndecentralization and participatory governance.   \n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nF. \n \n31. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  SDR34,496,000  ($50.0  million  equivalent) \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 32-year \nterm, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest rate of 1% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The ADB loan represents 75.0% of the total cost of the \nProject  and  will  cover  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  of  $21.1  million  (including  interest  and \nother  charges  amounting  to  $1.3  million),  and  $28.9  million  equivalent,  or  63.3%,  of  the  local \ncurrency  cost.  The  local  currency  cost  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  cover  portions  of  the  civil \nworks  and  equipment,  consulting  services,  and  project  implementation  support,  but  excludes \nduties  and  taxes  estimated  at  $7.7  million.  ADB's  financing  of  local  currency  expenditure  is \njustified  by  the  nature  of  the  Project,  which  will  address  local  poverty  and  economic  growth \nwithin  the  project  areas  and  the  entire  country.  The  Government  and  LAs  will  provide  local \ncurrency financing of $16.7 million equivalent, or 25.0% of the total project cost24 to cover part of \nthe  cost  of  civil  works,  consulting  services,  and  counterpart  staff  required  for  the  proposed \ncentral PCU and SPCUs. The proposed financing plan is summarized in Table 2.  \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plana  \n($ million) \n \n\n \nSource \n\nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment of Sri Lanka \nLocal Authorities \n \n\nTotal \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\n \nTotal Cost \n\n \nPercent \n\n21.1 \n  0.0 \n  0.0 \n21.1 \n\n28.9 \n12.0 \n  4.7 \n45.6 \n\n50.0 \n12.0 \n  4.7 \n66.7 \n\n 75.0 \n  18.0 \n    7.0 \n100.0 \n\na The allocation of loan proceeds in the loan agreement will be presented in the special drawing right equivalent of \nUS dollars.

Manila. \n\n        Source: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n\n \n32. \nThe Government will relend the LLDF credit line portion of the loan equivalent to $42.6 \nmillion  in  both  foreign  exchange  and  local  currency  in  accordance  with  the  subsidiary  loan \nagreements  with  the  terms  and  conditions  and  implementation  arrangements  satisfactory  to \nADB. Onlending terms from the Government to LLDF is the same rate as that applicable to ADB \nloans.  Conditions  for  the  credit  line  are  detailed  in  para.  42.  As  LLDF  is  a  primary  purpose \ndevelopment finance institution, designed to provide finance to local government authorities in a \nsustainable  fashion  and  at  interest  at  market-based  rates,  it  will  not  cause  market  distortions; \nthis demand cannot be met through domestic financial systems. As the Project will be providing \nmostly  non-revenue-generating  infrastructure,  e.g.,  roads  and  drainage,  release  of  the  grant \ncomponent is justified. The relending interest on the loan portion will enable LLDF to repay the \ngrant portion to the Government. Procurement and repayment requirements will be compiled in \ndetail in the LLDF operational guidelines to be developed in component A.  \n \nG. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nNational Arrangements  \n\n \n33.  MPCLG will be the Executing Agency. An interministerial NSC, chaired by the secretary \nof  MPCLG,  will  be  established  to  oversee  the  Project,  and  include  representatives  of  the \n                                                 \n24  Assessment  of  some  LA  financial  standing  records  indicates  that  they  have  the  ability  to  meet  their  counterpart \nfinancing  requirements  (supplementary  appendix  H).  The  FLIP  will  also  examine  each  LA\u2019s  capacity  to  shoulder \nthe counterpart funding.  \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nMinistry  of  Finance  and  Planning  (MoFP),  External  Resources  Department,  National  Planning \nDepartment, Finance Commission, Department of National Budget, Foreign Aid Utilization and \nBudget  Monitoring  Department,  Ministry  of  Urban  Development  and  Water  Supply  (Urban \nDevelopment  Authority  and  NWSDB),  Central  Environmental  Authority,  National  Physical \nPlanning  Department,  LLDF,  provincial  chief  secretaries,  urban  councils,  pradeshiya  sabhas, \nand civil society; chairpersons of the Association of Municipal Councils; and the project director \nof the PCU (member secretary). The NSC will be established and hold its first meeting within 3 \nmonths of the effectiveness date of the Project. The NSC will meet at least once every 6 months \nto review project progress and guide future direction of the Project. \n \n34.  MPCLG will set up a PCU, led by a full-time project director with experience in handling \nexternally  funded  projects  and  local  government  issues.  The  project  director  will  be  charged \nexclusively with project execution and have no other duties within MPCLG. The project director, \nsupported  by  the  PCU,  will  coordinate  activities  under  the  Project;  and  be  directly  responsible \nfor  overall  project  quality,  monitoring  and  supervision,  and  reporting.  Overall  implementation \narrangements  are in  Appendix  7.  Based  on  the  financial  management  assessment  and  ADB's \nprevious experience with MPCLG, financial management arrangements for components A and \nC are deemed sufficient.  \n \n35. \nThe  PCU  will  (i)  consolidate  the  overall  project  implementation  plan  and  annual  work \nplan, (ii) assist the provincial councils and  LAs in implementing the capacity-building program, \n(iii) monitor and supervise project administration and coordination activities, (iv) lead monitoring \nand  evaluation  exercises,  and  (v)  prepare  quarterly  project  reports  and  the  project  completion \nreport.  The  project  director  will  be  supported  by  a  full-time  compliance  officer  (legal, \nprocurement,  documentation,  environment,  and  social  compliance),  senior  accountant,  and \nadministrative staff (supplemented by consultants as necessary).  \n \n36. \nFor  component  B  implementation,  a  Project  Appraisal  Unit  (PAU)  will  be  established \nwithin LLDF. The unit will (i) assist the provincial councils in meeting requirements for funding \nactivities, (ii) review the eligibility of LAs and grant-funded activities, (iii) compile annual data on \nthe technical and financial performance of the LAs, and (iv) manage disbursements of funds to \nthe LAs. The unit will be staffed by a fund manager with economic/financial background, a civil \nengineer,  an  environment  and/or  social  development  specialist,  and  accountants.  The  LLDF \nBoard will approve the operation guidelines, business plan, and other documents and financial \nreports  to  be  prepared  and  compiled  through  LLDF  capacity  building  in  component  A.  The \nBoard  will  review  annually  the  performance  of  LLDF  and  the  participating  LAs.  The  existing \nBoard  of  Commissioners  will  be  expanded  to  include  one  representative  from  the  civil  society \nnominated  by  the  provincial  councils.  An  initial  financial  management  assessment  of  LLDF \nidentified areas to be strengthened prior to commencing financing operations under component \nB; as such the financial management arrangements for this component are deemed sufficient. \nThe PAU will operate under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer of LLDF and will liaise \nwith the Project Director on a regular basis, at least quarterly. \n \n\n2. \n\nProvincial Arrangements  \n\nIn each of the provincial councils, at the CLG office, an SPCU will be set up. The SPCU \n37. \nwill  be  headed  by  the  CLG,  supported  by  a  full-time  accountant,  civil  engineer,  assistant \nengineer,  and  support  staff.  In  addition  a  part-time  financial  management  specialist  and \ncompliance  officer  will  be  available.  Staffing  will  be  supplemented  by  consultants  (including \nsocial  development/environment  expert)  as  necessary.  The  SPCU  will  be  responsible  for  (i) \n\n \n\n\f 12 \n\npreparing  an  annual  development  program  for  the  respective  province;25  (ii)  accounting  for \nexpenditures;  (iii)  implementing  resettlement  plans  and  ensuring  environmental  mitigation \nmeasures if required; (iv) undertaking the initial evaluation of Subproject proposals from LAs; (v) \nmanaging  PDA;  (vi)  maintaining  and  managing  funds  for  LA  support  for  developing  business \nplans  and  implementing  the  FLIP;  (vii)  assisting  and  supporting  LAs  with  weak  capacity  in \nimplementing  civil  works;  and  (viii)  conducting  project  quality  assurance,  and  performance \nmonitoring  and  evaluation.  The  number  of  technical  staff  deputed  from  the  CLG  office  to  the \nSPCU will depend on the size of the province and the workload of the Subprojects.26 Training of \nSPCU  staff  will  be  organized  at  the  beginning  of  the  Project  for  civil  works,  Subproject \nappraisals,  environmental  and  social  safeguards,  contract  management,  and  regular  project \nadministrative responsibilities. A provincial steering committee will be set up in each of the eight \nprovinces to provide overall strategic guidance and coordination support. The chief secretary of \nthe  province  will  chair  the  provincial  steering  committee  and  members  will  include the  CLG  of \nthe province (member secretary), Secretary of the Provincial Local Government Ministry; district \nsecretaries; regional representatives of the Central Environment Authority, NWSDB, and Urban \nDevelopment  Authority;  and  the  chairpersons  of  selected  LAs.  Each  SPCU  will  have  an \naccounting  section,  directly  under  the  CLG,  to  deal  with  procedural  aspects,  recording  of \nfinancial transactions, and preparation of liquidation statements and replenishment requests to \nLLDF. At least 50% of the SPCU staff should be mainstreamed by provincial councils before the \ncompletion of the Project.  \n \n\n3. \n\nSubproject Appraisal   \n\n \n38. \nParticipating LAs, based on stakeholder consultations and community  prioritization, will \nidentify  Subprojects  and  submit  them  to  the  CLG  at  their  respective  provincial  council.  The \nSPCU under CLG, at the provincial council will check the Subproject for (i) any coordination for \na  joint  proposal  with  another  (or  more)  LA(s)  (e.g.,  roads,  solid  waste),  (ii)  needs  of  the  local \ncommunities,  (iii)  financial  and  economic  feasibility,  (iv)  environmental  and  social  impacts,  (v) \npreferred  government  strategy,  and  (vi)  sustainability.  If  the  Subproject  does  not  satisfy  all \ncriteria  on  technical  grounds,  the  SPCU  can  help  the  LA  identify  a  technical  expert  from  the \nconsultants  on  the  roster.  The  SPCU  under  CLG,    will,  on  behalf  of  the  LA,  submit  the \ncompleted  application  to  LLDF.  LLDF  will  be  responsible  for  appraising  the  Subproject.  In \naddition to assessing the technical feasibility and financial affordability/sustainability, LLDF will \nlook at regional balance and past performance of the LA. Once LLDF approves the Subproject, \nthe  provincial  council  or  the  LA  will  give  a  call  for  tenders.  ADB  will    assess  the  first  two \nSubprojects from each of the five subsectors. Then ADB will only review Subprojects valued at \nmore than $500,000. Each SPCU will have a tender board, which will evaluate all tenders and \ngive the final award. For each Subproject approved by LLDF, the LA will assign a focal person \nwithin  the  LA  office  to  look  after  location-specific  information  at  the  SPCU  for  design  and \nsupervision  of  the  civil  works.  Details  of  Subproject  selection,  appraisal,  and  tendering  are  in \nAppendix 4.    \n \n\n4. \n\nPrinciples to Guide Operation of Project Funds  \n\n \nThe principles for operation of the project funds under component B include (i) a regional \n39. \nbalance for infrastructure funding will be maintained through a predefined transparent allocation \nprocess  (para.  39  and  Appendix  4);  (ii)  Subprojects  must  comply  with  predefined  appraisal \ncriteria for each sector and must be limited to identified services; (iii) Subprojects selected must \n                                                 \n25  This serves as the basis for LAs to explore joint submission for any local infrastructure that would stretch beyond \n\nthe boundaries of an LA (e.g., road, drainage, or solid waste).  \n\n26  As a minimum, the SPCU will need staff capable of appraising the Subprojects on technical grounds (e.g., water, \n\nroad, drainage, etc.).     \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nform  part  of  the  functions  devolved  to  LAs,  and  be  under  the  line  function  of  the  LAs;  (iv)  an \noverall balance must be maintained at each province for the various categories of LAs with up to \n50%  funding  available  for  pradeshiya  sabhas;  (v)  all  funding  to  LAs  will  be  in  addition  to  the \nexisting  central  support;  (vi)  the  grant  component  to  LAs  will  be  40%  municipal  council,  50% \nunion  council,  and  60%  pradeshiya  sabhas,  of  the  project  cost;  (vii)  the  maximum  cumulative \nborrowing for individual LAs will be restricted to twice its own revenues; (viii) loans to LAs will be \ngiven  by  provincial  councils  with  provincial  guarantees;  (ix)  the  LA  contribution  must  be  a \nminimum 7% of the overall cost of each Subproject, (x) investment in an individual subsector is \nnot to exceed 30% of total infrastructure funding in each province; the minimum investment in \neach  subsector  is  to  be  at  least  5%  of  the  overall  funding;  (xi)  representation  of  all  provinces \n(except  Colombo  district)  is to  be ensured;  and  (xii)  incremental  revenues  of  LAs must  not  be \nset against a reduction in block grants or other funds due from provincial councils or against an \nincrease in recurring expenditure. \n \n\n5. \n\nFund Flow Mechanism \n\n \n40.  MPCLG  will  receive  the  funds  from  MoFP;  this  will  include  the  entire  amount  received \nfrom  ADB  and  the  counterpart  Government  funding.  The  funding  for  components  A  and  C, \nwhich will equal $10.2 million, will flow directly from MPCLG as a grant to the provincial councils \nand  LLDF.  LAs  will  receive  their  grants  for  FLIP  development  and  implementation  and  PDA \nthrough the provincial councils. Depending on the tender cost, the provincial councils or the LAs \nwill place the call for tenders. The total allocation for each provincial council (component A) will \nbe decided based on its population and poverty figures. \n \n41. \nLLDF  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  for  loan  disbursement  and  recovery  for \ncomponent B of the Project. LLDF will receive $42.6 million as a loan from the Government on \nthe same borrowing terms as disbursed by ADB to the Government. The Government will bear \nthe  foreign  exchange  risk.  The  entire  ADB  loan  is  to  be  repaid  to  the  Government  after  an  8-\nyear  grace  period,  in  24  equal  annual  installments  as  per  the  back-to-back  arrangement  with \nADB.  LLDF  will  disburse  the  funds  received  from  the  Government  (through  MPCLG)  as  part \ngrant and part loan as defined for the various categories of LAs. More than 60% of the funds will \nbe channeled to LAs through LLDF as grants.27 LLDF will set up a revolving fund generated by \nrepayments  from  LAs  on  their  borrowed  loan  portions.  LLDF  will  reinvest  the  money  received \nand  will  repay  the  Government  over  32  years.  Preliminary  financial  projections  indicate  that \nLLDF  will  be  financially  self-sufficient  under  these  arrangements.  Details  of  disbursement \narrangements at LLDF and the LAs are outlined in Appendix 4. LLDF will transfer funds to LAs \nfor  approved  Subprojects  on  a  6-month  projection  basis;  the  funds  may  be  liquidated  on  a \nstatement-of-expenditure  basis.  Depending  on  the  tender  cost,  tenders  for  civil  works  will  be \ncalled by the provincial councils or the LAs.  \n \n\n6. \n\nCapacity Assessment for the LAs to Borrow \n\n \n42.  Most Subprojects under the Project are not revenue generating in nature and will need \nto  be  considered  against  the  overall  LA  financial  capacity.28  Under  the  Project,  LAs  will  be \nsupported  to  develop  detailed  FLIPs  to  increase  their  own-source  revenue  to  repay  the  loan \nportion  and  strengthen  financial  discipline.  Under  the  FLIPs,  LAs  will  target  average  annual \n\n                                                 \n27  The loan component will have a 12-year term and a 2-year grace period for principal repayment. It will be repaid in \n40 equal quarterly installments thereafter; the market rate is to be charged on outstanding loans from LAs. The rate \nwill be Sri Lanka Inter-Bank Offer Rate (SLIBOR) 12 months. \n\n28  Para. 15 describes the provincial council guarantee, in case of LA default on repayment.  \n\n \n\n\f 14 \n\nincreases  of  10%  in  their  own-source  revenues.29  To  mitigate  risks  of  an  LA  being  unable  to \nrepay the loan and interest amounts, the maximum loan given will not be more than two times \nthe own-source revenue of the respective LA. In addition, a provincial guarantee for repayment \nwill be obtained against each LLDF loan. Initial assessment of the financial viability of loan and \ninterest repayment of the LA with two sample LAs show positive results. The Project will ensure \nthat the initiatives taken through this Project will be sustained by (i) LAs ensuring their transition \nto  more  transparent  and  plan-based  organization  through  the  FLIP,  (ii)  building  capacity  of \nprovincial  council  and  LA  staff,  and  iii)  allocating  the  LLDF  loan  on  a  performance  basis.  LA \nperformance  will  be  constantly  assessed  by  LLDF  before  financing  is  provided  for  a  second \nloan,  thus  incentives  will  encourage  LAs  to  strive  for  better  efficiency  in  delivery  and \nmaintenance of infrastructure.   \n \n\n7. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n43. \nThe Project will be implemented over 6 years. Implementation is expected to commence \nin  the  first  quarter  of  2006.  Start-up  activities  will  include  appointment  of  the  project  director; \nestablishment of the NSC and provincial steering committees; recruitment of project staff (PCU \nand  SPCU),  consultants,  and  technical  advisers;  preparation  of  training  manual;  and \nprocurement  of  immediately  required  equipment.  The  project  implementation  schedule  is  in \nAppendix 8.  \n \n\n8. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n44. \nProcurement of goods and services under the Project will be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and the Government\u2019s tender procedures acceptable to \nADB.  Local  procurement  will  be  the  preferred  mode  for  all  project  activities.  None  of  the \nProject\u2019s  civil  works  contracts  are  expected  to  exceed  $500,000.  Local  competitive  bidding \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB  will  be  followed  with  bidding  periods  of  at  least  21  days. \nEquipment  and  materials  will  be  procured  using  international  competitive  bidding  where  the \nestimated  cost  is  more  than  $500,000  equivalent,  international  shopping  where  the  estimated \ncost  is  between  $300,000  and  $500,000  equivalent,  and  local  procurement  procedures \nacceptable to ADB where the estimated cost is $300,000 equivalent or less. Minor items costing \nless than $100,000 equivalent may be purchased through direct purchase. \n \n\n9. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n45. \nConsulting  services  (236  person-months  of  international  and  580  person-months  of \ndomestic  consultants)  are  required  to  facilitate  project  implementation  and  to  strengthen  the \ninstitutional,  administrative,  and  financial  capacities  of  the  LAs  and  LLDF.  Consultants  will  be \nneeded for components A and C. Consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by the Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers \nand  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  selection  and  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants, using a quality- and cost-based selection method. The proposed consultant input in \ncomponents A and C is described in Appendix 9.30 Of component A consultancies, PDA support \nto  the  SPCUs  (A-2),  support  to  LLDF  and  (A-3),  and  component  C:  PCU  coordination  and \nadministration support will be engaged through a firm.  \n \n46. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998) was explained to and discussed with the Government \nand  MPCLG.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \n                                                 \n29  Thorough analysis of existing LA\u2019s tax base can be achieved, particularly by strengthening (i) assessment rate, (ii) \n\nservice tax, and (iii) stamp duty. Appendix 2 (paras. 30\u201333) provides more details.   \n\n30  Terms of reference for consultants are available in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n\n\f \n\n15\n\ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n\n10. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \nTo  ensure  the  timely  release  of  loan  proceeds and  to  expedite  project implementation, \n47. \nan  imprest  account  will  be  established  at  the  Central  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  for  MPCLG,  promptly \nafter  loan  effectiveness.  The  initial  amount  will  be  no  more  than  a  6-month  projected \ndisbursement, or 10% of the Loan, whichever is less. The imprest account will be established, \nmanaged, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook and detailed \narrangements agreed upon by ADB and the Government. Statement of expenditure procedures \nmay  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures  not  exceeding  $50,000  per  payment,  and  to \nliquidate  advances  made  into  the  imprest  account  in  accordance  with  the  guidelines.  MPCLG \nwill  coordinate  the  timely  release  of  funds.  A  second  generation  imprest  account  will  be \nestablished  for  LLDF.  The  initial  amount  will  be  no  more  than  a  6-month  projected \ndisbursement, or $1 million, whichever is less. Auditors satisfactory to ADB will audit the use of \nthe  imprest  account  and  SOE  procedures.  A  separate  audit  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest \naccount and SOE procedures will be included in the annual audit report.    \n \n\n11. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \nThe PCU, SPCUs, and LLDF will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to \n48. \nidentify  financing  resources  they  receive  and  expenditures  made  on  the  Project,  including  the \ngoods,  works,  and  services  financed  by  the  loan  proceeds  and  local  funds.  These  project \naccounts  and  related  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound \nauditing standards by auditors acceptable to ADB. The Government will submit annual audited \nreports  and  related  financial  statements  to  ADB  within  6  months  after  the  end  of  each  fiscal \nyear. LLDF will be subject to annual audit, and in addition to the audited project accounts, ADB \nwill receive a copy of the audited financial statements of LLDF. The audit of imprest accounts \nand statement of expenditures will be carried out as part of the annual audit, with the auditor\u2019s \nopinion of that part separately set out in the auditor\u2019s report.31  \n \n49. \nThe PCU and SPCUs will prepare brief progress reports each month. Project activities \nwill  be  similarly  reported  in  separate  monthly  reports.  Subproject  completion  reports,  which \nidentify  project  impact,  will  be  prepared  for  each  Subproject.  Within  3  months  of  the  physical \ncompletion  of  the  Project,  the  Government  will  submit  to  ADB  an  overall  project  completion \nreport providing a detailed evaluation on the impact on the beneficiaries. \n \n\n12. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n50. \nTo  ensure  that  Subprojects  are  managed  efficiently  and  that  project  benefits  are \nmaximized,  ADB  developed  the  Project  Performance  Management  System  Handbook.  The \nsystem  will  establish  a  cause-and-effect  relationship  between  the  Project  and  its  impact.  The \nProject\u2019s  PPMS  will  also  be  set  up  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  handbook  and  the  project \nobjectives.  The  PPMS  will  comprise  (i)  Subproject  baseline  data  and  output  targets  set  up \nduring  the  FLIP  and  Subproject  implementation  manual  preparation  within  component  A;  (ii) \n                                                 \n31  During the ADB tsunami emergency loan inception mission, the Audit General\u2019s Office indicated that it often does \nnot  receive  financial  information  in  time,  creating  difficulty  with  the  6-month  audit  deadline.  ADB  will  request  that \nunaudited financial information be prepared 3 months from the end of the fiscal year and be available for audit. \n\n \n\n\f 16 \n\ncomprehensive implementation-related performance dully collected and recorded by LLDF and \nthe SPCUs, which is periodically audited by the PCU; and (iii) postcompletion performance and \nimpact  data  collected  by  the  PCU  (MPCLG).  The  system  will  establish  a  set  of  monitorable \ntargets and indicators. Baseline and impact data will be disaggregated by provincial council, LA \nsize,  and  other  dimensions  to  be  discussed  during  project  inception.  Implementation \nperformance monitoring will integrate financial and nonfinancial aspects. The PCU will establish \nan effective PPMS within 1 year of the effective date.   \n \n\n13. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n51. \nBesides  the  regular  performance  review  and  evaluation  carried  out  by  the  PCU  and \nSPCUs, ADB will review the Project twice a year to assess implementation progress. This will \nbe complemented by an extensive internal project monitoring process, from self-monitoring by \nparticipating communities, up through the SPCUs and LLDF. A review mission (using one of the \nannual  review  missions)  will  be  fielded  when  LLDF  operational  guidelines,  business  plan,  and \nother  necessary  rule  and  financial  due  diligence  reports  are  finalized.  Component  B  will \ncommence  when  the  review  result  is  deemed  satisfactory.  In  addition,  a  comprehensive \nmidterm review will be carried out by the Government, the PCU, SPCUs, and ADB after 3 years \nfrom commencement. The midterm review will (i) review the scope, design, and implementation \narrangements of the Project; (ii) identify changes needed since the time of project appraisal; (iii) \nassess  implementation  performance  against  project  indicators;  (iv)  review  and  establish \ncompliance  with  loan  covenants;  and  (v)  identify  problems  and  constraints,  and  if  necessary \nrecommend changes in the design or implementation arrangements. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nExpected Project Benefits and Impacts \n\n \nA. \n \n52. \n The  main  benefits  of  the  Project  will  be  (i)  an  increasingly  more  capable  and \naccountable local government governance system; (ii) a foundation for sustainable and reliable \nurban  services  through  more  effective  LA  management  and  finance;  and  (iii)  improved \neconomic  and  social  conditions  in  the  participating  LAs  from  investments  in  roads,  drainage, \ncommunity water, solid waste management, and other small-scale community facilities. \n \n53. \nThe  Project  will  benefit  several  groups.  Households  and  businesses  in  LAs  will  benefit \nfrom  a  more  accountable,  responsive,  and  empowered  local  government,  as  well  as  directly \nfrom improvements in urban services and investments, and in the urban environment. Elected \nLA governments will gain from enhancement of their legitimacy, as a result of improved ability to \nprovide  services  and  from  greater  financial  and  managerial  autonomy.  The  urban  poor  will \nobtain health and productivity benefits from the investments in environmental infrastructure, as \nthey  suffer  disproportionately  from  the  ill  effects  of  the  lack  of  such  services.  Finally, \npredominantly local private contractors and their workers, as well as suppliers, will benefit from \nthe flow of more than $42 million in contracts for municipal civil works and equipment over the 6 \nyears of the Project. At least 4 million people, the total population of at least 68 municipalities, \nwill benefit from changes in the legal and institutional framework and from the capacity-building \ncomponent. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 10.  \n \n54. \nResettlement  and  Indigenous  Peoples.  The  Project  provides  direct  social  benefits \nthrough increased access to basic urban infrastructure and services, and enhances the potential \nfor  investments  and  economic  growth  in  poor  areas.  The  Project  is  not  expected  to  result  in \nsignificant  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  Subproject  selection  criteria  ensure  that \nSubprojects  resulting  in  significant  resettlement  will  not  be  part  of  the  Project.  Further,  the \nProject  will prioritize  rehabilitation of  existing  basic  urban infrastructure  over  new  construction. \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nWhere  land  acquisition  is  required,  the  use  of  Government  land  will  be  preferred,  avoiding \nprivate  land  in  Subproject  siting  and  alignment.  If  any  land  acquisition  and  involuntary \nresettlement  will  be  required  in  Subprojects,  the  Government  and  LLDF  will  follow  the \nresettlement framework. The Project will monitor the LA decision-making process to ensure that \ndecisions  are  reached  in  a  participatory  manner,  and  no  vulnerable  groups  are  adversely \nimpacted by Subprojects. Project design includes an indigenous peoples framework to ensure \nproject benefits are equally shared, should a Subproject have impacts on indigenous peoples. \n \n55. \nEnvironment.  The  Project  is  classified  as  \u201cFI,\u201d  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment \nPolicy  (2002).  An  environmental  assessment  of  financial  intermediation  loans  was  prepared. \nSubprojects  will  be  designed  to  maximize  environmental  benefits  including  improved  drinking \nwater  quality  through  improvements  in  water  supply;  reduced  depletion  of  water  resources  by \nimproving  the  management  of  existing  water  supply  schemes;  improved  surface  and \ngroundwater quality, and solid waste management; reduced flooding through drainage; reduced \nair  pollution  from  improving  roads;  and  improved  health  and  increased  social  benefits  from \ndeveloping  institutional  infrastructure  including  health,  education,  community  parks,  and \nadministrative facilities.   \n \n56. \nSubproject selection will prioritize rehabilitation of existing basic urban infrastructure over \nnew construction involving small- to medium-size civil and building works at sites previously or \ncurrently  used  for  the  same  or  similar  purposes.32  The  Subproject  selection  criteria  rules  out \nSubprojects that would be classified as category \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB sensitive\u201d in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy.  During  project  preparation,  an  initial  environmental  examination  was \nconducted.  Subprojects  will  not  generate  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts.  Most \npotential  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  temporary  and  localized,  and  can  be  addressed \nthrough  Subproject  design  and  mitigation  measures  incorporated  in  contractors\u2019  contracts.  To \nensure  compliance  with \nthe  Government  and  ADB\u2019s  environmental  guidelines  and \nrequirements,  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures  were  prepared  to  guide \nSubproject implementation and are in the environmental assessment of financial intermediation. \n \n57. \nSustainability.  Initial  financial  projections  and  a  financial  management  assessment \nwere  prepared  for  LLDF  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  Financial  Governance  and \nManagement of Investment Projects Financed by ADB to assess the viability and sustainability \nof the Project. This preliminary financial due diligence indicates that LLDF will be financially self-\nsufficient, and upon completion of capacity development activities under component A, will have \nsufficient  financial  management  capacity.  An  initial  affordability  assessment  of  two  sample \ncommunities  indicates  sufficient  demand  to  justify  the  size  of  component  B,  and  that  LAs  will \nhave  the  capacity  to  absorb  debt  service  and  recurrent  cost  obligations.  The  Project  is \nconsidered both financially viable and sustainable. \n \nB. \n \n58. \nGiven  the  innovative  design  adopted  in  the  Project,  where  LAs  will  be  responsible  for \nidentifying  and  preparing  Subprojects  and  where  the  strengthened  LLDF  will  appraise \ncreditworthiness  of  LAs  and  viability  of  Subprojects,  inherent  risks  need  to  be  monitored \ncarefully  throughout  project  implementation.  At  present,  LAs  lack  experience  to  prepare \nSubproject proposals for external funding. Similarity, LLDF's role as a fully functioning financial \nintermediary  is  new;  it  served  mainly  as  a  debt  collector  for  MPCLG  in  the  past.  Under  the \nProject,  however,  the  roles  and  functions  of  LAs  and  LLDF  are  expected  to  change \nsubstantially. LAs need to develop a sense of ownership for the Subprojects they will develop. \nLLDF will have to become a competent financial intermediary to efficiently channel the financial \n\nMajor Risks \n\n                                                 \n32  Sample Specifications for Potential Sub-Projects is in Appendix 11. \n\n \n\n\f 18 \n\nresources made available under the Project to LAs. Foreseen risks include (i) lack of awareness \nand suitably qualified personnel in LAs and the CLG offices to assume the new responsibilities; \n(ii) insufficient support from policymakers for the envisaged transformation of LAs and LLDF; (iii) \npoor performance of LAs in repaying LLDF loans, which may trigger the use of guarantees by \nprovincial  councils;  and  (iv)  political  interference  in  Subproject  selection.  These  risks  are \nmitigated  to  the  greatest  extent  possible  by  (i)  ensuring  LLDF\u2019s  readiness  prior  to  subloan \ndisbursement  under  component  B  through  a  tailored  institutional  strengthening  program  for \nLLDF;  (ii)  clearly  defining  eligibility  conditions  and  Subproject  approval  criteria;  (iii)  carefully \ndesigning  awareness  and  capacity-building  programs  for  LAs  and  provincial  councils;  and  (iv) \nincreasing supervision, by supporting TA project and regular loan review missions. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n59. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe  Government  and  ADB  agree  that  the  project  implementation  arrangements \nreflect  the  present  Government  administrative  structure  in  the  project  area  and \nthat  this  may  be  changed  during  project  implementation.  If  the  Government \nproposes  to  change  the  administrative  structure  in  the  project  area,  the \nGovernment  will  immediately  notify  ADB  of  such  change  and  will  take  all  steps \nnecessary  to  ensure  that  the  project  arrangements  are  revised  in  consultation \nwith  ADB  to  reflect  the  new  administrative  structure  and  the  viability  of  the \nProject.   \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  throughout  project  implementation,  adequate  \nallocations of the required counterpart funds are made, approved, and released \nin a timely manner to ensure proper project implementation. The Government will \nensure  that  immediately  upon  loan  effectiveness,  an  imprest  account  is \nestablished in the Central Bank of Sri Lanka for MPCLG. \nThe  Government  will  provide  adequate  office  space  for  the  Project,  and  will \nensure that the facilities provided under the Project are operated and maintained \nappropriately, and adequate budget will be provided for this purpose.  \nThe  Government  will  ensure,  and  cause  MPCLG  to  ensure,  that  all  lands  and \nrights-of-way  required  for  the  Project  are  made  available  in  a  timely  manner, \nadequate  compensation  is  provided  prior  to  the  commencement  of  civil  works, \nand  involuntary  resettlement  is  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement \nframework  agreed  upon  between  the  Government  and  ADB,  the  Government\u2019s \nNational  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy,  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement (1995). The Borrower shall ensure that a Resettlement Plan (RP) is \nprepared  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval  for  the  first  Subproject,  involving \nland acquisition or resettlement activities. This will serve as a model for preparing \nRP  for  any  subsequent  Subproject  involving  land  acquisition  or  resettlement \nactivities.   \nThe  Government  will  ensure,  and  cause  MPCLG  to  ensure,  that  the  design, \nconstruction,  operation,  and  implementation  of  all  Subproject  facilities  is  carried \nout  in  accordance  with  the  environmental  assessment  framework  agreed  upon \nbetween  the  Government  and  ADB;  complies  with  Government  environmental \nlaws  and  regulations  and  ADB  environmental  policies  and  regulations;  and  any \nadverse  environmental  impacts  arising  from  the  construction,  operation,  and \nimplementation of the Subproject facilities will be minimized by implementing the \nother \nenvironmental  mitigation \n\nand  management  measures, \n\nand \n\n\f \n\n19\n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nrecommendations  specified  in  environmental  assessment  reports  (e.g.,  initial \nenvironmental evaluations).   \nThe Government will ensure that Subprojects will not affect vulnerable population \ngroups, such as indigenous peoples. In the event of their involvement in any of \nthe Subprojects, the Government will ensure that the Subprojects are carried out \nin accordance with the indigenous peoples development framework agreed upon \nbetween the Government and ADB, and comply with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous \nPeoples (1998).  \nThe Government will ensure that all the Subprojects meet, to the satisfaction of \nADB, the agreed selection criteria and implementation arrangements; and that all \nSubprojects are, to the satisfaction of ADB, properly controlled and monitored. \n\n(x) \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  civil  works  contractors  comply  with  all \napplicable  labor  laws.  Bidding  documents  will  include  a  clause  prohibiting  child \nlabor  for  construction  and  maintenance  activities,  and  a  clause  regarding  equal \npay  for  men  and  women  for  work  of  equal  value.  Compliance  with  these \nprovisions will be strictly monitored during project implementation.  \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  annual  block  grant  allocation  currently \nprovided from the central Government to LAs continues to be provided, and does \nnot decrease, irrespective of this Project, and whether the total revenue level of \neach  LA  increases.  The  Government  will  disburse  the  funds  to  LAs  in  a  timely \nmanner.  \nThe Government will ensure that LAs involved in this Project, with the assistance \nof consulting services, will have developed long-term operation and maintenance \nprocedures  and  sustainable  funds,  which  represent  not  less  than  5%  of  the \nSubproject  costs  to  operate  and  maintain  the  assets  upgraded  or  constructed \nunder this Project.   \nConsistent with  ADB\u2019s  and  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  the  project \nfunds  are  utilized  effectively  and  efficiently  to  implement  the  Project  and  to \nachieve the project objectives.    \nThe Government will ensure that at least 50% of the technical staff engaged by \nthe  SPCUs  during  the  Project  are  retained  and  mainstreamed  in  provincial \ncouncils before project completion.   \n\n(xii) \n\n(xi) \n\n(xiii)  The  Government,  MPCLG,  and  LLDF  will  ensure  that  all  project  interventions \ncontribute  to,  or  do  not  detract  from,  ongoing  peace  building  and  community \nreconciliation.  In  the  event  that  during  project  implementation  any  intervention \nhas or is thought to have a negative impact on such peace building or community \nreconciliation efforts, the Government and ADB will mutually determine whether \nthe intervention should be continued, redesigned, suspended, or cancelled. \n\nCondition for Loan Negotiations \n\n \nB. \n \n60. \nThe  Mission  and  the  Government  agreed  that  the  following  will  be  a  condition  to  be \nfulfilled by the Government prior to loan negotiations: Prior to loan negotiations, the Government \nwith concurrence of ADB will appoint a project director responsible for overall administration and \ncoordination of the Project and for monitoring the overall implementation of the Project.  \n \nC. \n \n61. \neffectiveness: \n \n\nThe  Mission  and  the  Government  agreed  that  the  following  will  be  conditions  to  loan \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\n \n\n\f (i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(i)  \n\n(ii) \n\n 20 \n\n \nD.  \n \n62. \n \n\n \n\nThe Government will have constituted an NSC. The NSC will be responsible for \noverall strategic guidance and management, policy approval, and coordination of \nthe various project stakeholders.  \nThe  Government  will  have  set  up  a  PCU  under  the  authority  of  MPCLG.  The \nPCU  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project  administration  and  coordination,  and \noverall project monitoring and evaluation. \nThe Government will have completed the selection process for setting up SPCUs \nin  each  of  the  eight  provincial  councils  under  each  of  the  eight  CLGs  and  send \nADB  the  list  of  selected  members.  The  SPCUs  will  be  responsible  for  overall \nsupport  and  guidance  to  the  LAs  and  overall  performance  monitoring  and \nevaluation. \nLLDF will have entered into a project agreement with ADB. \nA  subsidiary  loan  agreement  satisfactory  to  ADB  will  be  signed  and  will  have \nbecome effective between the Government and LLDF. \n\nConditions for Loan Disbursement \n\nThe Government will ensure that \n\neach  provincial  council  will  have  signed  a  letter  of  commitment,  satisfactory  to \nADB, detailing its commitments to implement the relevant terms and conditions of \nthe loan agreement to the extent within its responsibilities and committing itself to \nenter,  promptly  as  required,  into  a  guarantee  agreement  with  LLDF  for  the \nguarantee of the subloans to be provided to the LAs under its jurisdiction, before \nany disbursement under component A; and \nLLDF has prepared a 5-year business plan, an operations manual, a model loan \nagreement  for  LLDF  subloans,  a  model  guarantee  agreement  and  a  model \nperformance  agreement  for  LLDF  subgrants  acceptable  to  ADB  before  any \ndisbursement under component B of the Project. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of  the \n63. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  34,496,000  to  the  Democratic  Socialist \nRepublic of Sri Lanka for the Local Government Infrastructure Improvement Project from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in \nthe draft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n \n \n \n28 October 2005 \n\n\f                                                                                                                                    Appendix 1 \n\n21\n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \n \n \nImpact  \nProvide sustainable \neconomic growth and \npoverty reduction through \nthe provision of urban \ninfrastructure services \nand the promotion of \nurban management \nimprovement to urban \nLAs in Sri Lanka. \n\n \nOutcome \nImproved urban \nmanagement and living \nconditions for LA \npopulation outside of \nColombo \n \n \n\n \nPerformance Targets/Indicators \n\n \n \n \nBy end of Project plus 3 years (2014): \nImproved participation and access to \nbasic services \n\u2022 \n\nImproved basic service levels in \nabout 50 LAs through investment in \ninfrastructure and operation and \nmaintenance  \n\n\u2022  About $5 million additional annual \ninvestment in infrastructure on an \nongoing basis; project pipeline of \nabout 20 new projects annually for \nLLDF \n\n\u2022  Provincial councils, LAs, and \n\ncommunity are strengthened to take \nactive participation in basic services \nin about 50 LAs \n\n\u2022  Long-term finance on a sustainable \nbasis is available to LAs through \nLLDF \n\n \n \n\u2022  About 30 participating LAs increase \ntheir financial viability and own-\nsource revenues by 40% by end of \nProject above baseline established \nat end of year 1 \n\n\u2022  FLIP adopted and implemented by \n\nat least 30 LAs \n\n\u2022  About 50 LAs able to borrow from \n\nLLDF \n\nLAs \n\n\u2022  Citizen-redress system used in 30 \n\n\u2022  Development and use of operation \n\nand appraisal manual, etc. for LLDF \n\u2022  About 80 subprojects implemented \n \n\n \nOutputs \nPart A:  \nUrban \nProvincial/Municipal/ \nUrban Management \nImprovement \n \n\n \n\n \n\nData Sources/ \nReporting \nMechanisms \n\n \n \n\u2022  Government \neconomic \npolicy \nframework \n\n\u2022  National \n\nbudget for \nLAs \n\n\u2022  Reports of \nvarious aid \nagencies  \n\nAssumptions and \nRisks \n\n \nAssumption \n\u2022  Macroeconomic \n\nstability. \n\n \nRisks \n\u2022  Natural disaster \n\u2022  Civil conflicts \n\u2022  Enabling framework \n\nfor decentralization not \neffective \n\n\u2022  No improvement in \n\nfiscal transfer system \nbetween provincial \ncouncils and LAs \n\n \n\n \n\u2022  PPMS \n\u2022  Central Bank \nannual \nreport/local \ngovernment \nbudgets \n\u2022  LLDF annual \nreports \n\u2022  LA annual \nreports \n\n \nAssumptions \n\u2022  Favorable political and \n\nmacroeconomic \nconditions \n\u2022  Government \ncommitted to \nstrengthening local \ngovernment capacity \nthrough \ndecentralization \n\nRisks \n\u2022  Community \n\nparticipation is not \naccepted  \n\n\u2022  Interference in project \noperation and revenue \nenhancement efforts \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n      Appendix 1 \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \n \nA.1.

Created under the Local Loans \nand  Development  Ordinance  No.22  of  1916,  which  has  been  amended  from  time  to  time,  the \nmain functions of LLDF include granting and administering loans for investment in infrastructure \ndevelopment  and  revenue-generating  projects  of  local  authorities  (LAs).  LLDF  is  still  not \nautonomous;  it  is  still  under  the  general  supervision  of  MPCLG  (para.  6).  Since  it  does  not \naccept deposits from the general public, it is not under any control or subject to regulation of the \nCentral Bank of Sri Lanka. \n \n\n1. \n\nStatus and Mandated Functions  \n\n \n2. \nThe prime objective of LLDF is to meet the capital investment needs of the LAs through \nlending. It advances loans to LAs at a market-based rate of interest, as well as to any person or \nbody for any purpose of public utility. LLDF loans are subject to limits of borrowing powers of the \nLA as prescribed in their governing law/ordinance.  \n \nIn  its  early  stages  (1930\u20131950),  LLDF  provided  loan  facilities  to  state  officers  and \n3. \ncooperative  societies.  But  after  1950,  its  activities  were  limited  to  LAs.  Until  1984,  the \nDepartment of Local Government managed LLDF. One of the highlights of this period was the \ninability of LLDF to fully utilize treasury allocations1. In 1985, LLDF was assigned to the Urban \nPlanning  Unit  under  the  Municipal  Management  Project.  During  this  period  LLDF  was \nrecognized  by  LAs  as  a  nodal  funding  agency.  Since  UPU  was  dissolved  in  1995,  LLDF \nrecruited  permanent  staff  and  has  since  managed  on  its  own.  For  the  first  5  years,  i.e.,  until \n2000  the  Treasury  made  all  salary  reimbursements.  Since  then,  LLDF  has  not  relied  on  the \nTreasury for recurrent expenditures. During 2003, LLDF management transferred to MPCLG. \n \n4. \nLLDF  is  primarily  capitalized  through  sums  appropriated  by  the  central  Government \n(General  Treasury  through  MPCLG),  and  recovery  of  repayment  of  its  loans.  The  law  also \nprovides  for  sourcing  of  loans  by  LLDF  from  the  consolidated  fund,  commercial  banks, \ngovernment-sponsored  lending  institutions,  and  loans  from  LAs  themselves.  Presently,  LLDF \nreceives  funds  from  the  Treasury  in  the  form  of  loan  at  a  concessionary  rate  of  interest \nrepayable  to  the  Treasury  in  25  years.  As  on  31  December  2004,  the  total  amount  of  loans \ngranted to LAs was SLRs377 million. LLDF keeps a margin on interest to cover its overheads, \nthus causing no burden to the Treasury with regard to LLDF management.  \n \n5. \nLLDF could set up a trust fund; contribute to the central revenue stream when directed \nby the minister in charge; and pay all expenses incurred for LLDF administration and all sums \nthat  from  time-to-time  may  be  payable,  by  way  of  principal  or  interest,  on  sums  lent  to  the \ncommissioners by LLDF.  \n \n\n2. \n\nOrganization Structure and Functional Staffing  \n\n \n6. \nA board of commissioners consisting of 13 members manages the LLDF. Chaired by the \nMPCLG  secretary,  the  board  includes  all  commissioners  of  local  government  (CLGs),  public \nofficers  nominated  by  the  minister  in  charge  of  irrigation,  power,  highways,  and  finance.  The \nminister  with  the  local  government  portfolio  appoints  all  commissioners.  The  commissioners \nconstitute  the  body  corporate.  The  chief  executive  officer  looks  after  the  day-to-day \n                                                 \n1   Local Loans and Development Fund. 2003. Annual Reports and Accounts.

Other  than  the \naccounts assistant, none of the other staff have technical skills. LLDF recently engaged about \n24 graduate trainees to work in the districts (CLGs). Overheads of fund administration are borne \nby the income earned by the fund.   \n\n \n3. \n\nLLDF Operations, Loan Portfolio, Debt Securitization, Loan Recovery, and \nFinancial Viability \n\n \n7. \nWhile  the  market  rate  for  commercial  loans  in  Sri  Lanka  is  13%  per  annum,  LLDF \nlending rates range from 6.5% to 10% per annum depending on the type of development. The \ntenure  for  repayment  of  loans  is  presently  5  years  for  equipment  and  10  years  for  all  others \n(with a grace period of 2 years for loan repayment). The margin on loans given to LAs is 2%. \n \nHowever,  not  only  is  the  number  of  loans  advanced  negligible,  the  overall  net  support \n8. \nfrom the Treasury has been insignificant. Between 1994 and 2003, the Treasury allocated only \nSLRs348.6  million;  LLDF  repaid  the  Treasury  SLRs348.6  million.2  The  cumulative  net  outflow \nfrom the Treasury was only about SLRs20.9 million, which is not likely to increase judging from \nthe present weak macroeconomic scenario.  \n\n \nTable A2.1: LLDF Borrowing from the Government Treasury  \n \n\n \nTime Period \n\nLoan Period \n(years) \n\nInterest Rate \n(%) \n\nTotal Amount \n(SLRs million) \n\nLoan Balance End 2003 \n(SLRs million) \n\n1972\u20131989 \n1990\u20131999 \n2000\u20132003 \nLLDF = Local Loans and Development Fund. \nSource: LLDF, 2004. \n\n40 \n25 \n25 \n\n9.25 \n9.25 \n6.00 \n\n185 \n172 \n179 \n\n                     77 \n                   131 \n                   164 \n\n \nAt  present,  the  LLDF  loan  portfolio  has  more  than  600  active  loans  (Table  A2.2).

The  weighted  average  interest  rate  ranges  from \n11%  for  municipal  councils,  9.6%  for  urban  councils,  and  9.1%  for  pradeshiya  sabhas.  The \noverall average interest rate is 9.2%. In 2003 and 2004, approximately 60\u201385% of loans were \nreleased to pradeshiya sabhas, 12\u201322% to urban councils, and 1\u201315% to municipal councils. \n \n\nTable A2.2: Details of Treasury Loans Provided by LLDF to Local Authorities \n \n\n \n \nLocal Authority \n\n \nTotal No \nof Loans \n\n \nAverage Size \n(SLRs million) \n\nWeighted Average \nInterest Rates \n (%) \n\nTotal Loan \nAmount \n(SLRs million) \n\nTotal Loan \nBalance \n (SLRs million) \n\nMunicipal Council \nUrban Council \nPradeshiya Sabhas \nTotal \nLA = local authority, LLDF = Local Loans and Development Fund. \nSource: LLDF data, 2004. \n\n        1.87 \n        1.05 \n        0.76 \n        1.01 \n\n    110 \n    113 \n    395 \n    618 \n\n       11.0 \n         9.6 \n         9.1 \n         9.2 \n\n         205.8 \n         118.2 \n         299.5 \n         623.5 \n\n         112.6 \n           72.1 \n         178.5 \n         363.2 \n\n \n10. \nLLDF  is  empowered  by  its  governing  ordinance  to  take  security  for  repayment  of  all \nloans given to LAs, with interest, in the form of either a mortgage of immovable property, or any \nrate or tax together with a personal security. It is empowered to recover loans from LAs in case \n                                                 \n2   LLDF obtained loans up to the value of SLRs536 million between 1972 and 2003, and has a total loan balance of \n\nSLRs372 million owing to the Treasury at the end of 2003. As at end of 2004, it stood at SLRs1,072 million. \n\n\f    Appendix 2 \n\n27\n\nof  a  default3  in  the  same  manner  as  a  debt  to  the  State  under  the  State  Debtor  Ordinance. \nAlthough provided with reasonably strong recovery powers, LLDF has not been able to exercise \nthese in the past, even in the case of chronic defaulters.  \n \n11. \nLoan recoveries of LLDF loans have improved over the last few years with recovery of \ncapital and interest averaging around 78%. While the rate of recovery of capital is higher from \nmunicipal councils and the rate of recovery of interest is higher from urban councils, recovery of \nboth capital and interest was lower in pradeshiya sabhas in the last 2 years. Overall the LLDF \nappears  to  be  quite  effective  in  recovering  loans.  Although  these  figures  augur  well,  if  all  the \narrears of loans taken previously are accounted for the recovery rates decline sharply. This is \nlargely  because  a  large  number  of  loans  provided  to  LAs  in  the  north  and  east  cannot  be \nrecovered as they are affected by the civil unrest as well as by the recent tsunami disaster.  \n \n\nTable A2.3: Loan Recoveries of LLDF (Treasury) Loans in 2004 \n \n\nLoan Recoveries \n\nCapital  \nMunicipal Council \nUrban Council \nPradeshiya Sabhas \nTotal \n\nInterest \nMunicipal Council \nUrban Council \nPradeshiya Sabhas \nTotal \n\n  \n         11.33 \n           7.39 \n         15.36 \n         34.08 \n\nCapital and Interest \nMunicipal Council \nUrban Council \nPradeshiya Sabhas \nTotal \nLLDF = Local Loans and Development Fund. \n\n  \n         31.71 \n         16.31 \n         56.58 \n       104.60 \n\n     Source: LLDF data, 2004. \n\nTreasury Loans Recovery in 2004 \n(SLRs million) \n\nTotal Receivable \n          20.38 \n            8.92 \n          41.22 \n          70.52 \n\nTotal Received \n      16.32 \n        7.18 \n      33.72 \n      57.22 \n\nArrears \n\n      4.06 \n      1.74 \n        7.5 \n      13.3 \n\nCollection \nEfficiency % \n80.1 \n80.5 \n81.8 \n81.1 \n\n        7.38 \n        5.21 \n      11.49 \n      24.08 \n\n  \n      23.70 \n      12.39 \n      45.21 \n      81.30 \n\n      3.95 \n      2.18 \n      3.87 \n    10.00 \n\n  \n      8.01 \n      3.92 \n    11.37 \n    23.30 \n\n  \n\n65.1 \n70.5 \n74.8 \n70.7 \n\n74.7 \n76.0 \n79.9 \n77.7 \n\n \nOn the whole, LLDF has not been able to develop into a sustainable local government \n12. \nfund  with  a  strong  corpus.  An  indication  of  this  is  that  total  loans  extended  were  less  than \nrecoveries of principal and interest by about SLRs58.6 million in 2004. While this position may \nto  an  extent  reflect  the  recoveries  made  on  account  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nloans, overall it does not reflect a very promising growth-oriented fund, unless a major capacity-\nbuilding effort is initiated to transform LLDF. \n\n \n4. \n\nLending Margins and Operating Margins  \n\n \n13. \nAverage  LLDF  lending  and  operating  costs,  with  respect  to  loans  provided  under \nTreasury funds are presented in Table A2.4.

Net  income  after  tax \nplummeted by 82% even though net interest income (interest earned less Interest paid) fell by \nonly 39%. This resulted from the massive provision of SLRs4.0 million for bad debts, in LLDF\u2019s \nfiscal year ending March 2004. Profit margins fell both before and after tax (Table A2.5). \n \n\nTable A2.5: LLDF Performance \n \n\nItem \n\nProfit After Tax/Net Worth \n\nProfit Before Tax/Net Worth \n\n \n\n1.0% \n\n2.7% \n\n2.7% \n\n \n\n5.9% \n\n5.9% \n\n5.5% \n\nEarnings Before Interest And Tax/Capital Employed\n\n                   Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nAs  heavy  provisioning  was  done  in  2003/04  (some  of  it  no  doubt  relating  to  earlier \n15. \nyears), performance should improve next year. However, interest spread needs to be protected \nas it fell from 24% to 15%.  \n \n16. \nAnalysis  of  the  balance  sheet  reveals  that  LLDF  is  heavily  leveraged  with  the  debt\u2013\nequity ratio standing at a worrisome 16.24. In fact, it has worsened greatly since 2002/03 when \nit  stood  at  8.04.This  situation  has  been  caused  by  a  huge  increase  of  1,028%  in  borrowings \nfrom  the  Treasury\u2500Urban  Development  and  Low-Income  Housing  (Sector)  Project5.  The \nborrowings  increased  from  SLRs48.6  million  to  SLRs548.0  million.  The  debt-equity  ratio  does \nnot  take  into  account  the  large  increase  of  SLRs7.9  million  (256%)  in  interest  payable  on  the \nproject. \n \n17. \nOn  the  cash-flow  front,  debtors  increased  by  86%  (from  SLRs559.7  million  to \nSLRs1,038.6  million),  and  other  receivables  (interest  and  cash  balance)  by  95%  (from \nSLRs75.3 million to SLRs146.6 million), thus impacting cash flow adversely. \n \n18. \nThese  trends  do  not  portend  well  for  the  future  if  extended  linearly.  Steps  need  to  be \ntaken to lift income to higher levels, to increase equity so as to reduce leverage, and manage \nreceivables  efficiently.  Armed  with  new  powers,  LLDF  should  not  provide  for  bad  debts  in  the \nfuture. \n\n                                                 \n4   Based on analysis of annual financial statements for the years 2002/03 and 2003/04. \n5   ADB.  1998.

The \nUrban  Development  and  Low  Income  Housing  Project  in  2000  (total  loans  will  be  SLRs2,300 \nmillion  by  mid  2005)  focused  on  development  of  17  urban  centers  through  the  Urban \nDevelopment  Ministry.  The  total  loan  component  is  SLRs2,378  million.  Under  this  project, \nLLDF\u2019s  margin  in  the  1st  year  was  SLRs80  million.  LLDF was  not  involved  in  the  appraisal  of \nsubprojects,  and  was  only  brought  in  as  a  recovery  agency  by  entering  into  a  tripartite \nagreement with ADB and MPCLG. \n \nTable A2.6: Recovery of the Urban Development and Low Income Housing Project Loans \n(2004) \n \n\nLoan Recovery in 2004 \n(SLRs million) \n\nItem \n\nTotal Receivable \n\nTotal Received \n\nArrears \n\nCollection \nEfficiency (%) \n\nCapital  \nInterest a \n \n a  Interest  received  up  to  31  January  2005  was  SLRs14.4  million,  thus  increasing  the  collection  efficiency  of \ninterest to 85% and of total to 85%. \nSource: Local Loans and Development Fund, 2004. \n\n              2.47 \n            16.99 \n            19.46 \n\n            2.00 \n            8.90 \n          10.90 \n\n          81.0 \n          52.4 \n          56.0 \n\n   0.47 \n   8.09 \n   8.56 \n\nTotal \n\n7. \n\n \nAccounts and Audit Policies and Assessment  \n\n \n20. \nLLDF created the internal Audit and Management Committee in 2000 consisting of two \nmembers  of  the  board  of  commissioners  and  the  internal  auditor  to  ensure  that  accounts  are \nfinalized  and  annual  reports  are  submitted  to  Parliament  according  to  the  Public  Finance \nCircular No. PF/PE 21. This has facilitated timely submission of accounts to the auditor general \nof  Sri  Lanka.  The  committee  also  looks  into  irregularities  in  accounting  and  submits  formal \nreports to LLDF. LLDF operations have led to improved financial results. In 2003, for example, it \nhad a surplus of SLRs3.8 million as compared with a surplus of SLRs2.5 million in 2002. \n \n21. \nThe  auditor  general  who  submits  audit  reports  to  Parliament  conducts  the  audit. \nAccounts and audit of LLDF are now completed on time; these are completed up to 2003. By \nand  large,  the  audit  reports  have  found  that  financial  statements  conform  to  the  stated \naccounting  policies  and  present  a  true  and  fair  view  of  LLDF\u2019s  financial  position.  They \nnevertheless point to the lapses as well. According to the audit report for 2003\u20132004 the year, \nfor example, SLRs508.8 million of loans and SLRs83.64 million of interests are outstanding. \n  \nB. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Financial Intermediary Transformation \n \n8. \n\nLoan and Project Conditions  \n\n \nThe  following  assurances/conditions  must  be  met  by  the  Government  before  funds  for \n22. \ncomponent B of the Project\u2014relating to LLDF and project funds\u2014will be disbursed: (i) prepare a \nstrategy  and  time-bound  action  plan  for  performance  improvement  of  existing  functions,  and \ntransformation  into  a  full  financial  intermediary,  (ii)  provide  a  provincial  council  guarantee  and \nintercept  mechanism  assurance  for  subproject  loans  to  individual  LAs,  and  (iii)  ensure \ncompliance of the principles for the operation of the project fund. \n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n9. \n\nProposed Organizational Structure \n\n10. \n\nBusiness Plan/Implementation Schedule  \n\n \n23. \nStrengthening LLDF will involve the use of specialists. A core team of four members will \ninclude  (i)  a  fund  manager  with  economic/financial  background,  (ii)  a  civil  engineer  with \ninfrastructure finance knowledge, (iii) an environment and/or social development specialist, and \n(iv)  accountants.  In  addition,  a  core  group  of  sector  specialists  may  be  engaged  to  provide \nsupport for various LLDF activities (including a marketing expert).  \n \n \n \n24. \nLLDF  strengthening  is  an  integral  part  of  successful  project  implementation.  LLDF  will \nneed  to  carry  out  a  number  of  activities  to  improve  performance  of  its  existing  functions  and \ntransforming  itself  into  an  autonomous  and  sustainable  development  financial  intermediary  for \nproviding  long-term  finance  for  infrastructure  to  LAs.  The  initial  task  is  identifying  staffing \nrequirements for areas to be addressed by the business plan. A strategy will be developed and \nsupport  provided  for  strengthening  project  evaluation,  legal  documentation,  debt  recovery \nstructures,  and  development  of  a  marketing  strategy.  In  addition,  guidelines  and  systems \nrequired for stringent project appraisal, loan documentation, and monitoring and loan recovery \nwill be set up. In addition, a strategy for engagement with provincial councils and LAs, and legal \nrecourse for debt recovery under project loans will be developed. The second task will include \nanalyzing the existing loan portfolio and identifying priority sectors. As a part of the evaluation of \nLAs  and  subprojects,  chronic  loan  defaulters  will  be  identified  and  listed.  Based  on  the  final \nbusiness  plans,  additional  staffing  requirements  will  be  identified.  A  team  of  sector  specialists \nwill be identified and made available to provide support for implementing various components of \nthe business plan. Training needs assessment of the existing staff vis-\u00e0-vis the requirements of \nthe  business  plan  will  also  be  undertaken  to  upgrade  the  skills  of  existing  staff.  Marketing  of \nLLDF will be an important component; workshops and other awareness-building exercises will \nbe  conducted  in  an  effort  to  build  demand  and  the  loan  application  pipeline.  Since  subproject \nfunding will have been initiated, reforms in treasury management especially for unlent funds will \nbe  undertaken.  Once  the  business  plans,  strategies,  and  systems  are  ready;  these  will  be \nsubmitted for approval by the LLDF board and ADB. When LLDF is approved as a full finance \nintermediary institution (complying with ADB OM D6 requirement), component B disbursement \ncan commence.  \n \nC. \n \n25. \n\nTable A2.7 provides the composition of project funding available to LAs.  \n\nFinancial Viability of LLDF as Project Fund Manager \n\n \nTable A2.7: Project Funding Ratio by LA Type \n\n \n\nFunding Structure  \n\n \n\nLLDF Funding \n 53% \n    Loan Component \n 40% \n    Grant Component \n   7% \nLA Contribution (minimum) \nTotal \n100% \nLLDF = Local Loans and Development Fund. \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nMunicipal \nCouncil \n\nUrban \nCouncil \n\nPradeshiya \nSabhas \n\n \n\n \n\n 43% \n 50% \n   7% \n100% \n\n 33% \n 60% \n   7% \n100% \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n26. \nLoans provided by LLDF to LAs under the Project will have a term of 12 years with a 2-\nyear  grace  period  for  principal  repayment  and  to  be  repaid  in  40  equal  quarterly  installments \nthereafter;  with  interest  of  SLIBOR  (12  month)  per  annum  to  be  charged  on  the  outstanding \n\n\f    Appendix 2 \n\n31\n\nloan. The maximum lending level is restricted to two times the respective LAs own revenues to \nensure repayment. The maximum lending level has been estimated as $1.6 million for municipal \ncouncils, $290,000 for urban councils, and $160,000 for pradeshiya sabhas. Based on this and \nloan components for each type of LA, an average project size of 30% and a project mix of 20% \nfor municipal councils, 30% for urban councils, and 50% for PS, the average subproject size is \nestimated at $317,700 (Table A2.8). \n \n\nTable A2.8: Average Loan Size \n\n \n\nItem \n\nMunicipal Council \n ($) \n\nUrban Council  \n($) \n\nPradeshiya Sabhas  \n($) \n\nMaximum Project Capacity (average) \nAverage Project Size (assuming 30%) \nProject Mix \n\nWeighted Average Project Size \n\n3,075,000 \n   923,000 \n20% \n\n674,000 \n202,000 \n30% \n\n317,700 \n\n485,000 \n145,000 \n50% \n\nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nRelease of Funds to Local Authorities.

The projection\u2019s assumptions are the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\nThe Government will cover all exchange risks associated with the ADB loan. \nThe LLDF loan amount remains constant in dollar terms. \nInterest is charged on the loan component of funds loaned to the LAs at 10% \nper annum the amount is to be repaid by the LAs from the 3rd year onward in \n10 equal annual installments. \nAvailable  surplus  funds  (on  return  from  LAs)  will  be  reinvested  by  LLDF \nand interest will be earned on the cumulative balance at 10% per annum.  \nLLDF  will  repay  the  Government  from  9th  year  onward  in  96  quarterly \ninstallments.  It  will  pay  interest  to  Government  at  1%  per  annum  on  the \noutstanding  loan  amount  during  the  8-year  grace  period  and  at  1.5%  per \nannum thereafter.  \nThe  LAs  will  make  all  payments  on  a  timely  basis  (paras.  30\u201333).  Delay  in \npayments  may  adversely  affect  LLDF\u2019s  schedule  of  repayment  to  the \nGovernment. \n\n29. \nThe net result of these transactions will be that LLDF will be in a comfortable position to \nmeet its loan and interest commitments. Table A2.10 shows the net flows of LLDF in the first 5 \nyears, while Table A2.10 shows the net flows of LLDF in the last 5 years of the repayment cycle. \nAccording  to  the  analysis,  LLDF  will  have  a  positive  annual  balance,  and  due  to  the \nreinvestment of surplus funds at 10% per annum, will be able to substantially increase its loan \n\n\f32 \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nportfolio.  Under  these  assumptions,  LLDF  will  end  the  cycle  of  repayment  (year  32)  with  an \navailable  cumulative  balance  of  about  $74.98  million.

As part of \ntheir jurisdictional powers, LAs are authorized to collect revenues against some of the services \nprovided by them in form of user charges (direct services), tax, fines, cesses, etc. Although cost \nrecovery  by  LAs  is  not  predominant,  it  has  the  potential  to  become  a  major  source  of  own \nrevenue. Unfortunately, most LAs are already hard pressed to provide even the minimum level \nof  basic  services  due  to  resource  and  institutional  constraints.  LAs  have  the  power  to  impose \nthe following taxes within their jurisdiction:   \n\nLA Options to Repay an LLDF Loan \n\n \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\nLA assessment rate (similar to property tax), \nentertainment tax, \ntax on animals and vehicles, \nlicence fees (stamp duties), \nrents, and  \nuser charges (service tax). \n\n\f    Appendix 2 \n\n33\n\n \n\nThese  taxes  are  critical  and  can  provide  buoyancy  to  the  overall  revenues  of  LAs,  which  is \ncritical for their financial autonomy and sustainability. \n \n31.  \nThe  assessment  rates  (or  Property  Tax)  can  be  increased  if  property  valuation  can  be \nmade  more  frequently  and  the  process  is  simplified.  Currently,  valuation  of  property  is  made \nonce  in  five  years  and  sometimes  even  longer  if  there  is  a  backlog  in  the  Department  of \nValuation (DV). At present LA has to make a request to the DV at least two years ahead of time \nif the valuation is to be completed in time. In practice the LAs, do not send the request two years \nin advance and the process of valuation takes longer to complete, depriving the LA of additional \nrevenue. If the valuation process is simplified, and the time frame for valuation shortened, rate \nincreases  could  be  made  more  frequently.  Furthermore,  due  to  poor  collection  efforts,  many \nlocal authorities are unable to collect their dues. Warrant costs to be collected from defaulting \nratepayers  cannot  exceed  10%  of  the  assessment  rates  and  therefore  is  dependent  on  the \nexisting  rates.  If  assessment  rates  are  increased,  the  warrant  costs  would  similarly  increase.  \nAssessment rate is allowed at maximum 12% of the assessed property value; which is in many \nLAs  currently  imposed  to  only  3-4%.  Many  mayors  said  during  appraisal  that  they  are \nconsidering to increase this to at last 5-6% level.     \n \n32.  \nThe local authorities have been authorized to collect an annual tax only from industries, \ntrades,  and  businesses.  Rents  on  buildings  are  authorized  by  the  Acts,  but  the  Council  of  the \nLocal  Authority  must  pass  a  resolution  to  decide  on  the  rent  to  be charged,  which  is currently \nbased on the annual value. If the estimated valuation rates are low, as is usually the case, the \nrental  value  may  not  be  equal  to  the  market  value,  resulting  in  reduced  revenue.  Currently, \ncertain  market  stalls  are  auctioned  on  an  annual  basis  to  the  highest  bidder.  In  such  cases, \nproperties can be rented at market rates by LAs. Due to poor collection efforts by the LA, the full \namount of the dues payable within the existing legal framework is also not usually collected. \n \n33.  \nThere are many activities, which full cost recovery can be made. This group comprises \nof  activities  mainly  of  a  service  nature  and  includes  such  services  as,  clearing  of  blocked  or \noverflowing  latrine  pits,  clearing  of  blocked  drains  and  drainage,  cutting  and  clearing  of \nobstructions such as trees on roads and by-lanes, garbage collection, provision of street lights, \npublic  toilets,  visitor  rest  areas  and  markets,  and  regulation  and  control  of  commercial  and \nbusiness activities. In many LAs, service tax is imposed for commercial buildings and residential \nbuildings  which  are  within  100  meter  radius  from  a  specific  intersection  where  public  utility \n(communal water) is provided. By expanding the supply coverage, LAs can issue ordinance to \nincrease the radius to 300m.    \n\n\fEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SECTOR \n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n34\n\nType of \nAssistance \nLoan \n\nSource \n\nWorld \nBank \n\nYear \nStart  End \n1986  1995 \n\nAmount \n($ million)\n13.00 \n\nGrant \n\nUSAID \n\n1990  1990 \n\n \n\nADB \n\n1993  1999 \n\n27.00 \n\n1995  2001 \n\n39.00 \n\nLoan \n\nLoan \n\n \n \nGrant \n\nGrant \n\nWorld \nBank \n\n \n \nUN-\nHabitat/ \nUNDP \nUNDP \n\n \n \n \n1999  2003 \n\n2004  2005 \n\n \n \n \n0.57 \n \n0.25 \n\nLoan \n\nADB \n\n2000  2004 \n\n70.00 \n\nGrant \n\nGTZ \n\n2002  2005 \n\n3.04 \n\nProject Name \n\n1.

Following a consultative \nprocess, the selection framework discussed during the stakeholders\u2019 workshop. The participants \nsuggested  excluding  economic  growth  impulse.  The  remaining  four  parameters  were  then \nassigned equal weights, which were then allocated to the indicators of the four parameters.  \n \nTo collect the primary quantitative data for LA selection, a questionnaire was prepared in \n2. \nconsultation  with  the  Ministry  of  Provincial  Councils  and  Local  Government  (MPCLG),  It  was \ndiscussed  in  a  meeting  of  all  eight  provincial  commissioners  of  local  government  (CLGs), \nchaired  by  the  MPCLG  secretary,  MPCLG.  The  questionnaires  were  distributed  to  LAs  in  all \ndistricts  other  than  Colombo  through  the  office  of  the  CLGs.  Completed  questionnaires  were \nreceived from 189 LAs from the nine provinces. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nLAs that secured a score of 60 and more were selected for the Project. Subsequently, \nfollowing the advice of the Project Steering Committee to ensure selection of at least one LA in \neach  district,  three  more  LAs  were  selected  in  the  three  districts  (excluding  Colombo)  on  the \nbasis  of  the  highest  score  in  these  districts.  These  are  Elpitiya  pradeshiya  sabha  in  Galle \ndistrict,  Dehiattkandiya  pradeshiya  sabha  in  Ampara,  and  Karaichchi  pradeshiya  sabha  in \nKilnochchi  district.  Thus  in  all,  68  LAs  are  selected  for  the  Project  (component  A)  (Table  A4). \nThe  project  preparatory  TA  team  conducted  field  visits  to  35  LAs  for  initial  identification  of \nsubproject and scoping.  \n \n4. \nAlthough the TA has identified a few subprojects, the 68 shortlisted LAs can still identify \nnew  subprojects.  The  subproject  selection  and  approval  process  is  outlined  in  Figure  A4. \nParticipating LAs, based on stakeholder consultations and community prioritization, can identify \nsubprojects  and  submit  them  to  the  CLG,  which  will  assess  the  subprojects  based  on \npredetermined  criteria  para.  6.  If  a  forwarded  subproject  does  not  satisfy  all  criteria,  the \nrespective  LA  will  be  required  to  reconsider  and  may  be  provided  support  from  subproject \ncoordination unit (SPCU). Once the CLG approves a subproject, the LA must prepare detailed \nfeasibility reports with assistance from the Project, and then submit the proposal to the project \ncoordination unit (PCU) for approval.  \n \nThe  PCU  will  reassess  the  subproject  against  a  set  of  criteria  paras.  6\u201311.  If  the \n5. \nsubproject does not satisfy all criteria on technical grounds, the PCU can help the LA identify a \ndesign; supervision support will be provided by a panel of consultants/contractors (identified by \nthe  PCU),  who  will  assist  the  SPCU  and  LA  in  preparing  detailed  feasibility  studies.  Once  the \nLocal Loans and Development Fund (LLDF) approves the subproject, the LA will give a call for \ntenders. Each LA-SPCU will have a tender board, which will evaluate all tenders and give the \nfinal award. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will assess the first two subprojects from each \nof  the  five  subsectors.  Then  ADB  will  only  review  those  valued  at  more  than  $500,000. \nHowever,  ADB  will  review  all  subprojects  that  will  incur  land  acquisition  and  involuntary \nresettlement.  For  cases  where  the  technical  feasibility  reports  of  the  SPCU  are  directly \napproved  by  the  PCU,  the  design  and  supervision  support  will  be  identified.  Otherwise,  the \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 4                                                                                             \n\nsame support team, which assisted in preparing the detailed feasibility studies, will be retained \nfor supervision of implementation and ensuring quality control and timeliness of delivery.   \n \n\nTable A4: Local Authorities Selected for Phase 1 \nfor Infrastructure Investment under the Project  \n\nTangalle  \n\nBatticaloa \n\nLocal Authority \n\nS.No \n1 \nKoralaipattu  \n2 \nTrincomalee Town and Gravets \n3 \nRatnapura  \n4 \nUkkuwela \n5 \nVavuniya \n6 \nHingurangoda \nKanthale \n7 \n8  Weeraketiya \n9 \nKuliyapitiya \n10  Chilaw \n11 \n12  Warakkapola \n13  Gampola \n14  Rajanganaya \n15 \n16  Mathale \n17  Dambulla \n18 \n19  Dompe \n20  Mulatiyana \n21 \nBeliaththa \n22  Mannar \n23  Chavakachcheri \n24 \nVilgamuwa \n25  Mahiyanganaya \n26 \nThunukkai \n27  Madevachchiya \n28  Gampaha \n29  Welimada \nThihagoda \n30 \nTangalle \n31 \nKamburupittiya \n32 \nEhaliyagoda \n33 \nKegalle \n34 \n\nLankapura \n\nTotal \n75 \n75 \n73 \n72 \n70 \n70 \n70 \n69 \n69 \n69 \n68 \n68 \n68 \n67 \n67 \n67 \n67 \n66 \n65 \n65 \n65 \n65 \n65 \n65 \n64 \n64 \n64 \n63 \n63 \n63 \n63 \n63 \n63 \n63 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nLocal Authority \n\nS.No \nKottiyagama \n35 \nManmunai South Eruvil Pattu  \n36 \n37 \nPallepola \n38  Walapane \n39  Walallaavita \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n66 \n67 \n68 \n\nRatnapura \nBalangoda \nJaffna \nPachchilaipalli \nKurunagale \nIbbagamuwa \nThalawa \nKaathankudi \nNuwaraeliya \nPanadura \nMonaragala \nBandarawela \nEmbilipittiya \n  Manthai East \n  Vavuniya South \n  Valvettithurai \n  Variyapola \n  Nikeweratiya \n  Kobeikanne \n  Mawathagama \n  Kiribawa \n  Udubaddawa \n  Thimbulagala \n  Kahatagasdehiliya \n  Trincomalee \n  Thalawakkale/ Lindula \n  Dehiaththakandiya * \n  Elpitiya a \n  Karaichchi * \n\nTotal \n63 \n63 \n63 \n63 \n62 \n62 \n62 \n62 \n62 \n62 \n62 \n62 \n62 \n62 \n61 \n61 \n61 \n61 \n61 \n61 \n61 \n61 \n61 \n61 \n61 \n61 \n61 \n61 \n61 \n61 \n61 \n57 \n56 \n54 \n\nGeneral Subproject Selection Criteria  \n\nS.No = subproject number. \na Selected as per the suggestion of the Project Steering Committee. \nSource: GoSL-Asian Development Bank PPTA survey result. \n \n \nC.  \n \n6. \nSubprojects  will  be  identified  on  the  basis  of  needs  of  the  local  communities,  financial \nand economic feasibility, environmental impact assessment, preferred government strategy, and \nsustainability.  Accordingly,  the  selection  of  subprojects  will  be  made  in  terms  of  the  following \ngeneral criteria: \n \n(i) \n\nPriority  requirement  of  community  and  link  to  development  plan.  The \nsubproject  should  be  in  line  with  the  priority  requirements  of  the  community  at \nlarge  and  should  address  the  basic  urban  infrastructure  requirements  of  the  LA \n\n\f  Appendix 4 \n\n37\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\narea.  This  will  be  ascertained  through  on-site  consultations  with  community-\nbased  organizations  by  using  tools  such  as  participatory  rapid  appraisal,  and \nparticipatory  learning  and  action,  which  allow  rapid  assessment  of  community \nneeds and priorities. The proposed subproject should be in conformity with local \nmaster  plans  and  vision  statement  (if  available),  and/or  regional  development \nplans, as well as local development goals. Subproject integration with local and \nregional plans will ensure a balanced sustainable development of the region.  \nTechnical  feasibility  of  the  subproject.  The  subproject  must  be  technically \nfeasible and the least-cost solution alternative, taking into consideration the need \nto  meet  reasonable  increases  in  demand.  The  equipment,  material,  and  other \nresources  as  required  can  be  acquired  in  or  transferred  to,  the  subproject \nlocation without unreasonable obstruction or delay. \nFinancial state of the LA. The overall financial health of the LA will be assessed \nin  terms  of  own  revenue  as  a  proportion  of  total  revenue,  and  trend  of \ndependence on provincial/national government.  Revenue-generating capacity of \nexisting  projects,  expenditures  as  a  proportion  of  expenditure  norms  and  other \nindicators  of  financial  strength  will  be  used  to  determine  capacity  to  repay  and \nensure sustainability of the proposed subproject. LAs that have taken loans and \ndefaulted  on  loan  and/or  interest  repayment  will  not  be  eligible  for  loans  under \nthe Project.  \nQuality control. Quality control in terms of quality of work/processes as well as \nquality  of  proposed  output  will  be  key  criteria  for  subproject  appraisal.  Quality \ncontrol  techniques  suggested  by  the  LA  during  subproject  design,  construction, \nsupervision,  and  operation  will  be  closely  assessed.  This  is  not  only  likely  to \nminimize failures but also increase life and benefits of the proposed subproject. \nIncrease  in  revenue  potential  and  creditworthiness  for  absorbing  loans. \nThe possible impact of the proposed subproject on tax compliance and increase \nin revenue collection of the LA will be closely studied. The loan would be capped \nat 2 times the LA\u2019s own revenues. \nOperation and maintenance (O&M). Inadequate budgetary allocation for O&M \nwill  result  in  physical  neglect  of  a  subproject.  Fiscal  capacity  of  the  LAs  for \neffective O&M will be assessed to ensure the smooth flow of project benefits; the \nLA will be required to set up a separate account for O&M by depositing 5% of the \nproposed project cost before initiating the subproject.  \nEconomic  and  financial  returns.  Evaluation  of  economic  and  financial  returns \nfrom  the  subproject  will  be  closely  studied.  Therefore,  the  LA  will  need  to \ncalculate  economic  and  financial internal  rates of  return  according  to  LLDF  and \nADB  guidelines.  The  findings  will  be  evaluated  vis-\u00e0-vis  other  criteria  including \nenvironmental  and  social  impact,  etc.  In  addition,  LLDF  will  assess  economic \njustification  of  the  subprojects,  based  on  issues  listed  in  Supplementary \nAppendix  F,  paras.  37\u250053.  These  include  (i)  overall  state  of  services  in  the \nprovincial council and LA, (ii) demand for the service, (iii) estimate of benefits, (iv) \ntechnical  specifications  and  quantification  of  costs,  (v)  cost  of  capital  and  user \ncharges, (vi) net benefits, and (vii) risk factors.  \n\n(viii)  Environmental impact. An environmental assessment will be undertaken for all \nsubprojects.  LAs  will  undertake  a  preliminary  screening  using  a  rapid \nenvironmental  assessment  checklist  ensuring  compliance  with  specific \nenvironmental criteria for subproject selection, and an environmental and project \nbrief  for  review  as  part  of  the  assessment  of  subprojects.  Subprojects  cleared \nafter  the  preliminary  assessment  will  require  compliance  with  Government  and \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 4                                                                                             \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n (xii) \n\nADB  guidelines  on  environmental  assessment.  Procedures  to  be  followed  for \nenvironmental  assessment  of  financial  intermediation  loans  and  review  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix B.  \nSocial and resettlement issues. LAs will assess social and resettlement issues \nto  ensure  that  subprojects  will  not  have  significant  adverse  social  and \nresettlement  issues.  Subprojects  assessed  to  have  significant  resettlement \nimpacts  will  not  be  undertaken.  For  subprojects  requiring  land  acquisition  or \nresettlement  activities,  a  detailed  assessment  of  resettlement  impacts  will  be \nundertaken by LAs consistent with Government and ADB policy. LAs will prepare \na  Resettlement  Plan  for  subprojects  with  resettlement  impacts.  A  resettlement \nframework  to  guide  the  formulation  of  resettlement  plans  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix  D.  The  Government  will  prepare  and  submit  a  Resettlement  Plan  for \nADB  approval  for  the  first  subproject  involving  land  acquisition  or  resettlement \nactivities.  This  will  serve  as  a  model  for  preparing  Resettlement  Plan  for  any \nsubsequent subproject involving land acquisition or resettlement activities. \nIndigenous  people\u2019s  issues.  LAs  will  undertake  a  preliminary  assessment  of \nsubproject  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples.  Subprojects  with  impacts  on \nindigenous  peoples  will  require  a  detailed  social  impact  assessment  and  an \nindigenous  peoples\u2019  development  plan.  An  indigenous  peoples  development \nframework to guide the LAs is in Supplementary Appendix E. \nGender. LAs will evaluate the impacts of proposed subprojects on gender issues \nbased on the following principles: (i) maximum participation of women, especially \nthose  from  poor/low-income  households,  in  community-based  decision  making \n(quantitative  targets  may  help);  (ii)  gender-equal  responsibility  in  construction \nand  O&M;  (iii)  consideration  for  women\u2019s  time  and  space  constraints  and/or \nrequirements;  (iv)  gender  disaggregated  data  collection  whenever  possible;  (v) \nuse  of  gender \ncommunity-based \nresponsive  nongovernment  and/or \norganizations;  and  (vi)  gender  awareness  among  the  LA  officials.  A  written \nagreement  from  the  LA  accepting  the  responsibility  for  maintenance  of  the \nsubproject infrastructure is available. \nImproving  governance.  The  subproject  includes  improving  and  strengthening \nlocal  governance  and  efficiency  through  support  for  improved  infrastructure \nprovision  in  the  LA.  As  this  is  the  most  critical  criteria,  the  assessment  of \nsubprojects will be made in terms of factors such as improving staff performance, \nincreased  technical  capacity,  public  participation  in  decision  making  (and \nimplementation  and  O&M  wherever  possible),  increased  willingness  to  pay, \nimproved financial health and creditworthiness of the LA, etc.   \n\nSector-Specific Subproject Selection Criteria  \n\n \nD. \n \nThis section outlines the broad sector-specific criteria as guidelines for the selection of \n7. \nsubprojects.    The  detailed  sector-specific  criteria  will  be  developed  by  the  PCU  at  the  time  of \nimplementation.  \n \nCommunity  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation.  The  objectives  should  be  to  improve \n8. \naccess to safe drinking water, improve sanitation, minimize water-borne diseases, and improve \nhealth conditions. The focus should be on areas with a large population with little or no access \nto safe drinking water. Other criteria include the following: \n  \n\n(i) \n\nFor  new  schemes,  the  number  of  connections  should  not  exceed  500  and  the \nrespective  LA  and/or  a  community-based  organization  agree  to  manage  the \nscheme. \n\n\f(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n \n(i) \n\n  Appendix 4 \n\n39\n\nFor  water  supply  systems,  the  numbers  of  families  to  be  served  for  each \ninstallation should be consistent with national policies. For wells, at least 20\u201325 \nfamilies should benefit from one well, consistent with national policy standards.  \nFor sanitation facilities, the number of families to be served should be consistent \nwith national policy standards. \nA  potable  water  source  is  not  available  within  a  radius  of  500  meters  from  the \nsettlement. \nThe  water  resources  board  and/or  the  National  Water  Supply  and  Drainage \nBoard have carried out preliminary investigations, and have certified that potable \nwater  of  sufficient  quantity  and  quality  is  available,  and  the  abstraction of  water \nwould  not  create  adverse  impacts  to  existing  water  users  or  the  groundwater \ntable, in both the short and long term. \nFor tubewells, beneficiary communities have agreed to contribute labor and other \nmaterials  in  kind  for  the  installation  of  hand  pumps  and  construction  of \nbasements,  together  estimated  to  be  about  5\u201310%  of  the  total  cost  of  civil  and \nmechanical works for a typical tubewell.  \nFor  open  dug  wells,  beneficiary  communities  have  agreed  to  voluntarily \ncontribute10% of the total cost of civil works in kind or labor.  \n\n(viii)  For  sanitation  facilities,  beneficiaries  have  agreed  to  voluntarily  contribute  the \n\nlabor required for construction of the civil works.  \nBeneficiaries  have  agreed  to  maintain  the  wells,  and  have  formed  a  water \nmanagement organization for this purpose.  \nThe  overall  community,  especially  women,  have  agreed  to  the  location  of  the \nwells.  \nAn appropriate agency has agreed to provide TA to beneficiaries for maintenance \nof tubewells.  \n\n(xii)  No land acquisition to construct the wells is required.  \n(xiii)  Where the location of a well on privately owned land is unavoidable, a written and \nlegally valid assurance from the landholder must be available allowing permanent \naccess of other beneficiaries to the well.  \n\n \n9. \nAccess  and  LA  Roads.  The  objectives  should  be  to  improve  access  and  to  minimize \ntravel  time.  The  subprojects  should  be  limited  to  selected  rural  and  LA  roads  (class  D  and  E) \nand other unclassified roads only. Broad selection criteria include the following: \n\nPriority  to  be  given  to  roads  serving  agricultural  or  fisheries  activities  that  link \nvillages and relocation schemes included in the project scope to nearby market \ncenters  and  townships, as  identified  by  the  communities  and  included  in  village \ndevelopment plans. \n(ii) \nRoads to be improved should benefit a substantial proportion of population. \n(iii)  Where possible, the scope of repairs is limited to existing road alignments, where \nno land acquisition is required, except for internal and access roads for relocation \nof villages. \n\n(iv)  More  than  50%  of  beneficiary  families  have  agreed  to  participate  in  the \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nconstruction and to carry out maintenance after rehabilitation. \nThe  estimated  base  cost,  should  be  in  line  with  ongoing  similar  initiatives.  The \ncurrent price in 2005 is less than SLRs500,000/kilometer. \nConfirmation is to be available that the beneficiaries are the original landowners \nor occupiers, and not new settlers. \n\n \n10. \ndisposal of the solid waste in the LAs. Broad selection criteria include the following: \n\nSolid  Waste  Management.  The  objectives  should  be  to  improve  collection,  and  safe \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 4                                                                                             \n\n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n \n(i) \n\nActivities improve collection and disposal by at least by 30% in LA areas. These \nshould  include  improvements  to  household  storage,  street  cleaning,  and  street-\nside primary storage. \nActivities promote public awareness of the population on household management \nof solid waste. \nActivities  demonstrate  availability  of  a  suitable  site  for  safe  disposal  of  solid \nwaste. \nActivities improve on-site and disposal site for solid waste treatment.     \nActivities  demonstrate  community  involvement  in  selection  of  sites  for  safe \ndisposal of solid waste, including acceptance of the site for disposal.  \n\n(vi)  Where possible, state land should be selected for disposal of solid waste.  \n(vii)  Hazardous waste should be treated separately.  \n\n \n11. \ndisposal of the runoff and grey water in the LAs.

On average, the urban population is growing nearly twice \nas fast as the rural population. The degree of urbanization is projected to reach 45% by 2015.   \n \n2. \nPublic infrastructure investment has been considerably below what is needed to sustain \nrapid  growth  of  the  economy  and  increasing  urbanization.  Generally,  the  level  and  quality  of \ninfrastructure  is  inadequate  and  poor.  Most  towns  experience  problems  with  congestion, \noverloaded  infrastructure  services,  intermittent  and  low-quality  water  supply,  irregular  and \nfluctuating  voltage  electrical  services,  and  substandard  roads  hampering  integration  of  the \nnational  economy  and  trade.  Sanitation,  drainage,  and  solid  waste  management  are  other \ncritical problems.  \n \nWide  regional  disparities  exist  in  the  quality  and  level  of  public  infrastructure  services. \n3. \nWestern  Province  generally  has  better  infrastructure  services,  notably  in  Colombo  District  and \nits environs. The incidence of poverty in urban areas (8% in 2002) is much lower than in rural \nareas (25%) (footnote 1). Per capita incomes in urban areas are more than 60% higher than the \nnational average.2 These numbers provide some indication of the affordability and willingness to \npay for infrastructure services in urban areas. However, these numbers are heavily influenced \nby Colombo district, where the medium household income is almost twice the national average. \nFor  the  seven  provinces  where  data  are  available,3 Sabaragamuwa  Province  is  the  poorest; \nNorth Central and Uva provinces also record per capita incomes significantly below the national \naverage. \n \n4. \n \n\nNational responsibility for urban affairs rests with two ministries: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government, with line responsibility \nfor provincial and local councils; the Local Loans and Development Fund (LLDF) \n(for loans to LAs), and the Sri Lanka Institute of Local Government (for training); \nboth are attached to the ministry; and \nthe  Ministry  of  Urban  Development,  Housing,  and  Construction,  with \nresponsibility  for  providing  technical  support  to  local  government  in  planning, \nappraisal,  procurement,  and  management;  the  Urban  Development  Authority \n(UDA)  for  designation  of  urban  areas,  planning,  and  development  (including \ncapital investment plans); it is attached to the ministry. \n\n \n5. \nThe  National  Water  Supply  and  Drainage  Board  (NWSDB),  National  Housing \nDevelopment  Authority,  Road  Development  Authority,  and  Ceylon  Electricity  Board  play \nimportant roles in providing essential infrastructure services to urban areas. Provincial councils \nand  local  authorities  (LAs)  have  limited  financial  and  personnel  resources  to  provide  urban \ninfrastructure  services.4 Civic  amenities  are  their  main  responsibility,  including  operation  and \n\n                                                 \n1   Lack  of  an  official  definition  and  criteria  for  measuring  the  degree  of  urbanization  means  that  estimations  vary \n\nwidely, with the official level at about 22%.   \n\n2   Department  of  Census  and  Statistics,  Government  of  Sri  Lanka.  2004.  Household  Income  and  Expenditure \nSurvey\u20132002  Colombo.  For  purposes  of  the  survey,  areas  governed  by  either  municipal  or  urban  councils  were \nconsidered urban.   \n\n3   Data for the north and east are not available. \n4   A major exception is the Greater Colombo Economic Commission.   \n\n\f     Appendix 5 \n\n43\n\nfrom  NWSDB.  Service  delivery \n\nis  reportedly  deteriorating,  reflecting \n\nmaintenance  of  roads  and  drainage,  water  distribution  systems,  public  toilets,  solid  waste \nsystems, markets, and health facilities. \n \n6. \nWater Supply. The Government aims to achieve full water supply for the population by \n2010. The World Bank estimates that around 98% of urban population has access to safe water \nand  70%  of  the  rural  population. 5  However,  studies  undertaken  in  the  project  preparatory \ntechnical assistance (TA) reveal that access to safe drinking water ranges from 10% to 55% in \nmost  LAs.  In  1990,  the  Government  adopted  the  principle  of  community  management  of \nservices,  backed  by  measures  to  strengthen  local  institutions  in  implementing  and  sustaining \nwater supply programs.6 The trend, however, has been to greater centralization; NWSDB is the \nmain agency responsible for water  supply and  manages over 75% of piped water  schemes in \nthe  country.  LAs  operate  and  maintain  the  remaining  schemes,  most  receiving  bulk  treated \nwater \nthe  weak \nperformance and financial position of NWSDB. The National Water Resources Act, reviewed by \nthe Cabinet in December 2004, but not yet approved, is meant to revitalize the water sector. A \nwater services reform bill is under consideration, and plans are under way to privatize NWSDB.7 \nThe current institutional arrangements result in poor water supply. The Project should contribute \nto  changing  these  institutional  arrangements,  allowing  LAs  to  contract  with  alternative  water \nsuppliers.  NWSDB  should  continue  to  address  bulk  water  supply,  but  on  a  competitive  basis. \nPrivate sector participation should be encouraged8 and LAs should be free to levy water tariffs \nthat will ensure a full supply of potable water.   \n \n7. \nSewerage  and  Sanitation.  Sewerage  and  sanitation  are  related  to  water  supply; \nwastewater  generation  increases  with  the  availability  of  water  and  increased  use  of  flush \nlatrines.9 Only Colombo has a piped sewerage system, other areas rely on septic tanks and pit \nlatrines  because  construction  of  proper  sanitation  facilities  is  difficult  due  to  high  water  tables \nand  rock  outcrops.  Coastal  towns  dispose  of  wastewater  into  the  sea,  reducing  the  tourism \npotential.  Project  preparatory  TA  studies  show  that  only  25%  to  50%  of  the  population  has \naccess  to  safe  sewerage  and  sanitation  facilities  in  most  LAs.  Poor  conditions  reflect \ninstitutional  problems  and  perhaps  insufficient  awareness  of  the  importance  of  a  clean  and \npleasant  environment  to  health,  livelihoods,  tourism,  and  other  social  and  economic  interests. \nThe Project should include efforts to increase the priority given by LAs to the sector.  \n \n8. \nDrainage.  Drainage  problems  are  serious  in  many  urban  areas  leading  to  inundation \nduring  the  monsoon  season  resulting  in  stagnant  water,  frequently  polluted  by  wastewater \n(sewage) and solid waste. Low-lying towns experience the worst problems, but even LAs in hill \nareas report problems. Equipment needs are frequently cited, although assurance that LAs will \nhave  sufficient  funds  to  operate  and  maintain  the  equipment  is  in  question.  Better  urban \nplanning  is  fundamental  to  solving  drainage  and  flood  control  problems.  Road  drainage  is \ninadequate, reflecting in some cases lack of proper design and of operation and maintenance of \ntertiary roads. Realignment of responsibilities may be necessary to solve such issues under the \nnational authority or the provincial councils. The Project will need to address these issues.  \n \n\n                                                 \n5   World Bank. 2004. World Development Indicators. Washington, DC. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) country \nstrategy and program update indicates that 98% of the urban population has access to safe water, while only 70% \nof  the  rural  population;  presumably  these  are  official  figures  (ADB.  2004.  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update \n(2005\u2013-2006): Sri Lanka. Manila.    \n\n6   Proclaimed in 1990 at the New Delhi Global Consultation on Future Water Supply and Sanitation Development.    \n7   This is a highly controversial issue.  \n8   ADB, together with the World Bank, provided key assistance in privatizing the Colombo urban water supply. \n9   The  percentage  of  households  with  latrine  facilities  is  high  across  most  districts,  except  in  the  case  of  Puttaiam \n\nDistrict. Department of Census and Statistics Sri Lanka. \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n9. \nSolid  Waste  Management.  Services  are  generally  available  in  urban  areas,  but  in  a \nmanner that is rudimentary, unsightly, and potentially hazardous to health and the environment, \nespecially  in  low-income  areas.  Lack  of  disposal  facilities  is  critical  in  most  LAs.  The \nGovernment  has  recently  adopted  a  National  Solid  Waste  Management  Strategy.  Solid  waste \nmanagement  systems  supported  under  the  Project  will  need  to  be  consistent  with  this.  The \noption of private sector participation also needs to be explored.   \n \n10. \nTertiary  Roads.  LAs  are  responsible  for  constructing  and  maintaining  class  D  and  E \nroads,  which  are  primarily  tertiary  roads.  Generally,  tertiary  roads  are  of  poor  quality,  with  the \ndegree  of  quality  inversely  related  to  the  class  as  almost  all  LAs  lack  technical  and  financial \nresources.  LAs  are  spending  far  less  than  they  should  on  maintenance. 10  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) is also supporting development of a road sector master plan, which \nshould  help  identify  institutional  issues.11 In  addition,  road  investment  under  the  Project  will \nneed  to  be  carefully  coordinated  with  those  under  other  projects,  notably  those  supported  by \nADB, World Bank, and Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC). From the perspective \nof  strengthening  local  governance,  the  challenge  will  be  to  ensure  that  investments  are \nidentified, planned, implemented, and monitored by LAs, while drawing on provincial and central \nexpertise  for  technical  inputs.  The  Project  will  also  need  to  secure  assurance  that  proper \nprovision is made for operation and maintenance.   \n \nCommunity  Health.  Public  health  responsibilities  of  LAs  are  clearly  minimal.  LAs  are \n11. \ngenerally,  but  not  always,  expected  to  provide  facilities  for  health  clinics;  this  is  normally \naccommodated by providing space in a general purpose community center. Medical staff, drug \nsupplies,  and  equipment  are  supplied  by  provincial  councils.  The  Project  could  contribute  to \nstrengthening local governance in the field of community (and preventive) health care, but this \nwould require realignment of governmental responsibilities\u2014at least in practice if not in law. In \nthe  current  socioeconomic  and  political  economy  context,  this  is  unlikely.  Community  health \nservices rank low in the priority needs of LAs surveyed for the Project. \n\n \nUrban Planning \n\nB. \n \n12. \nToo  many  laws  (as  many  as  seven)  crowd  the  existing  legal  framework  of  urban \nplanning  and  land  management.12 Of  these,  the  Town  and  Country  Planning  Ordinance  after \namended in 2001 led to the creation of the National Physical Planning Department (NPPD), the \nmain physical planning department of the Government. NPPD has wide powers to formulate a \nnational  physical  planning  policy  and  basic  regional  policy  parameters  and  regional  structure \nplans for the different regions. NPPD has completed regional structure plans for five of the nine \nregions  through  the  engagement  of  consultants.  However,  these  need  to  be  approved  by  the \nNational  Steering  Committee  chaired  by  the  President  of  Sri  Lanka.  The  National  Steering \nCommittee has not yet met.  \n \n13. \nPlanning  involves  several  groups.  UDA,  which  has  to  operate  within  the  national  and \nregional  policy  framework  provided  by  NPPD,  is  responsible  for  planning  specific  areas  for \n\n                                                 \n10  This  is  also  a  serious  problem  for  national  and  provincial  roads.  A  road  maintenance  fund  was  established,  but \n\ninsufficient budget allocation has been made to it. \n\n11  ADB. 2004.

The latter includes capacity building for institutions involved in the road \nsector. \n\n12  Urban Development Authority Law, No. 41 of 1978; Town and Country Planning Ordinance (as amended in 2001); \nHousing  &  Town  Improvement  Ordinance;  Greater  Colombo  Economic  Commission  (present  BOI  Act);  Ceylon \nTourist Board Act; Coast Conservation Act; and Provincial Councils Act, No. 42 of 1987. \n\n\f     Appendix 5 \n\n45\n\nprojects;  currently  198  areas  are  designated  as  \u201cdeclared\u201d areas.  These  areas  are  now  under \ninterim  development  control  until  the  development  plans  are  approved  by  the  Planning \nCommittee and the minister and is gazetted under provisions of the UDA law. Until now only six \ndevelopment  plans  have  been  gazetted.  The  Greater  Colombo  Economic  Commission  that  is \ndesignated as the Board of Investment has overriding powers for Board of Investment-approved \ninvestment  projects  that  are  located  within  the  designated  export  promotion  zones  and  other \nareas. The Housing and Town Improvement Ordinance now operates only within built-up areas \nlocated  in  pradeshiya  sabhas.  The Ceylon  Tourist  Board  has  powers  to  regulate  development \nwithin  designated  tourist  development  or  resort  areas  to  ensure  protection  of  amenities  and \npromote  an  environment  conducive  for  tourism  development.  The  Coast  Conservation \nDepartment  has  jurisdiction  over  planning  and  regulation  of  development  in  the  coastal  zone \nthat comprises of an area 300 meters seaward and 1 kilometer landward. Since the tsunami, the \nwidth of the coastal zone and planning restrictions are under review by the Coast Conservation \nDepartment. \n \n14. \nThe UDA Law supersedes physical planning powers of the LAs. Although planning and \ndevelopment  control  powers  of  UDA  is  now  delegated  to  LAs,  they  are  required  to  follow  the \ninterim planning and building regulations formulated and gazetted by UDA in 1986 until separate \ndevelopment plans are formulated for each area with the participation of LAs concerned. \n \nThus, several national organizations are involved in regional and local physical planning \n15. \nthat should logically be carried out by provincial councils and LAs. The Commission of Inquiry \non  Local  Government  Reforms  has  suggested  building  the  capacity  of  LAs  to  enable  them  to \nregain their lost powers. The Project will be instrumental in enhancing LA institutional capacity \nto enable the restoration of urban planning to them. The Cabinet recently approved the Cabinet \nSubcommittee  on  Legal  Reforms\u2019  suggestion  to  designate  LAs  as  the  planning  authority  as \nrecommended by the Commission of Inquiry on Local Government Reforms. \n\n \n\nLand Management \n\nC. \n \n16. \nImplementation of urban development plans and projects require regulation of land use \naccording to the provisions of the development plan, as well as power to make land available for \ninfrastructure services and other development activities. Planning organizations, such as NPPD, \nhave  powers  only  to  regulate  land  use  through  land  use  zoning  and  other  planning  controls, \nwhich help to carry out regulatory planning. However, urban development planning requires not \nonly  regulation  of  land  use  but  also  the  promotion  of  required  urban  development  activities  to \ncomprehensively implement an urban development plan. UDA has the regulatory power, as well \nas  development  promotion  and  land  management  powers,  to  accomplish  the  objectives  of \ndevelopment plans. Legal provisions exist in the Land Acquisition Act (Chapter 460 of legislative \nenactments)  to  acquire  private  lands  for  essential  public  purposes.  The  normal  acquisition \nprocedure  under  Section  38  is  a  highly  cumbersome  and  time-consuming  process  involving \nabout  44  steps  and  leads  to  appeals,  ownership,  and  valuation  inquiries;  court  cases;  and \nrestraining  orders  in  many  cases.  Furthermore,  LAs  do  not  have  the  finances  and  capacity  to \ncarry  out  land  acquisition,  which  at  times  takes  well  over  5  years  to  complete.  Due  to  delays \ninvolved in normal acquisition procedures (under Section 38); a more expeditious and less time-\nconsuming procedure is provided under Section 38a for the acquisition of lands for urgent public \npurposes.  This  requires  a  special  certificate  to  be  issued  by  the  minister  who  initiates  the \nacquisition of land required for an urgent public purpose. However, only organizations such as \nUDA, which has the institutional capacity and the resources to provide the initial deposit with the \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nacquiring officer, can make use of this provision to acquire land. Acquisition of Crown Land13 is \nconducted  under  the  Crown  Lands  Ordinance  through  an  application  to  the  Commissioner  of \nLands who is a central government functionary. Although LAs enjoy powers of land acquisition, \ntheir existing institutional and human resource capacity constrain actual acquisition of land and \nthey have to ask other agencies, such as UDA, for this. \n\n \nEnvironment \n\nD. \n \n17. \nSri Lanka is presently facing significant environmental problems due to high exploitation \nof  its  natural  resources  resulting  from  high  population  growth,  poverty,  lack  of  awareness, \nenvironmentally insensitive and irresponsible behavior, etc. Various studies clearly indicate that \ndegradation of coastal resources and forest and water resources continues.14 Although pollution \ndue  to  anthropogenic  activities  is  of  critical  concern,  pollution  control  in  general,  and  in \nindustries  in  particular,  has  made  good  advances  recently  due  to  the  establishment  of  strict \nstandards  and  regulations.  Better  enforcement  has  also  resulted  in  improved  environmental \nstatus. This has, however, meant sewerage and wastewater treatment systems are slowly being \nimplemented throughout the country.  \n \n18. \nThe environmental responsibilities of LAs are mainly confined to pollution control, public \nhealth  and  safety,  and  prevention  of  nuisance.  Environmental  management  with  regard  to \nnatural resources is mainly carried out by the national agencies (line agencies). However, LAs \nare often invited to participate in activities and projects implemented by these agencies.  \n \n19. \nRecently,  pollution  control  responsibilities  have  been  delegated  to  LAs  for  all  low-\npolluting  industries.  In  addition,  UDA  planning  responsibilities  are  being  implemented  through \nthe  LAs.  Planning  requirements  also  deal  with  many  aspects  of  environmental  management \nincluding  location  decisions.  In  areas  of  health  and  sanitation,  responsibilities  of  LAs  include \nconducting clinics for children and mothers, maintaining sanitary conditions in eating places and \nfood stalls, preventing contamination of wells, and promoting good sanitation practices among \nthe public.  \n \n20. \nLA  success  in  achieving  good  result  in  these  areas  depends  on  many  factors  such  as \nleadership, income, technical strength of staff, and staff commitment. In all these areas LAs are \nfacing problems, including lack of technical expertise. Enforcement of sanitation regulations and \nlaws  is  the  responsibility  of  public  health  inspectors.  However,  as  most  of  the  inspectors  are \nofficers  seconded  by  the  Ministry  of  Health,  LAs  are  unable  to  benefit  from  them  due  to  their \nshort tenure and lack of clout. Implementation of planning regulation is done through planning \ncommittees. In the case of UDA declared areas, UDA assistance is provided to LAs on a regular \nbasis,  which  is  satisfactory.  The  problems  are  mostly  cited  in  areas  not  declared  by  UDA.  In \nthese  areas,  LAs\u2019  ability  to  control  development  activities  is  extremely  poor  due  to  the  lack  of \nland-use plans. The importance of developing land-use plans for all LAs was highlighted during \nmany  discussions.

While \nincome poverty in Sri Lanka appears to be low, nonincome poverty appears to be increasing. Basic urban infrastructure is \ngenerally in poor condition and deteriorating. Approximately 30% of the population lack access to safe drinking water, 24% \nto safe sanitation facilities, and 56% to hygienic toilets. Inadequate sanitation is a leading cause of public health problems \nin communities. Poor and deficient basic urban infrastructure hinders improvement in the livelihood of poor communities. \nStudies  identify  that  the  poor  from  the  lowest  income  quintile  groups,  estate  plantation  labor  communities,  small  rural \nagricultural communities, and war-affected internally displaced persons are among those most seriously affected by a lack \nof  basic  urban  infrastructure.  Consumption  data  show  that  in  the  poorest  quintile  (average  monthly  household \nconsumption  of  SLRs821)  only  61%  have  access  to  safe  drinking  water  compared  with  the  richest  quintile  with  89% \nhaving access; only 55% of the poorest quintile have access to safe sanitation compared with 89% in the richest, and only \n84% of the poorest quintile have access to latrines compared with 94% in the richest. \n \nThe disparity in household incomes is growing. The Gini concentration ratiob increased from 0.43 in 1980 to 0.47 in 2002. \nIncome  varies  widely  between  urban  and  rural  areas  with  average  monthly  household  income  in  the  rural  areas  of \nSLRs11,712 (2002)\u2014only half of its urban counterpart SLRs22,420 (2002). Intraprovincial inequality is high: the average \nhousehold  monthly  income  of  the  poorest  province  of  Sabaragamuwa  (SLRs8,439)  is  only  48%  that  of  its  Western \nProvince  counterpart  (SLRs17,732).  Basic  urban  infrastructure  is  unequally  distributed.  This  exacerbates  the  slow \neconomic  growth  and  social  development  experienced  by  poor  regions.  The  higher  degrees  of  poverty  experienced  in \nSabaragamuwa, Uwa, and conflict-affected northeast provinces illustrates this. Most of these areas are considered rural \nand  are  administered  by  rural  local  authorities  (LAs)  or  pradeshiya  sabhas.  More  than  80%  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  poor  live  in \npradeshiya  sabahs.  While  national  average  levels  of  access  to  basic  urban  infrastructure,  access  to  safe  sanitation, \ndrinking water, toilets, and health services is low, these are even poorer in pradeshiya sabahs, especially when compared \nto that in urban and relatively developed regions such as Western Province. \n \nImproving basic urban infrastructure  will result in directly reducing  nonincome poverty,  and is likely to result in indirectly \nreducing income poverty through human development and associated economic growth. The Project is designed to assist \nselected LAs in developing management capabilities, and strengthening capacity in the delivery of community-prioritized \nbasic urban services. It will also improve and expand basic urban infrastructure and services particularly in the categories \nof  (i)  community  water  supply  and  sanitation,  (ii)  access  and  LA  roads,  (iii)  solid  waste  management,  (iv)  drainage \nimprovements,  and  (v)  institutional  infrastructure  (health,  education,  common  community  facilities,  and  administrative \nfacilities).  \n \nB. \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nNationally, the  poverty  headcount  does not  appear very  high  at 22.7%.  However, large differences  in  poverty  are found \nacross  the  country.  The  poverty  levels  for  rural  and  urban  populations  for  example  are  24.7%  and  7.9%,  respectively. \nSome differences are found in income inequality between rural and urban areas with Gini concentration ratios of 0.46 and \n0.48,  respectively.  In  2002,  poverty  headcounts  in  the  region  varied.  The  lowest  level  of  poverty  was  in  the  Western \nProvince,  where  the  poverty  headcount  was  only  9.2%.  In  comparison,  the  poverty  in  Uva  was  31.8%,  Sabaragamuwa \n28.9%, Southern 23.6%, North Western 22.3%, Central 20.8%, and North Central 18.1%.c When examined by district, the \nvariability  increases  further  with  poverty  headcounts  ranging  from  32.4%  in  Moneragalato  5.0%  in  Colombo;  and  Gini \nconcentration ratios ranging from 0.56 in Moneragala to 0.40 in Nuwara Eliya, Hambantota, and Polonnaruwa.  \n \nAside  from  the  relatively  high  levels  of  poverty  and  income  inequality  in  certain  districts  and  provinces,  the  income \nstructure is such that a large number of the population are near-poverty. When poverty is defined using two poverty lines, \n1996  data  show  that  a  higher  poverty  line  of  SLRs950  classifies  26%  as  poor;  while  a  lower  poverty  line  of  SLRs791 \nclassifies 19% as poor.d This shows that although the number of core poor may not be so high, a large number of near-\n\nPoverty Analysis                                                                     Proposed Classification: General intervention \n\n\f52 \n\n       Appendix 10 \n\npoor are highly vulnerable. This is significant considering the high dependence on the primary sector, and one event such \nas a natural calamity can result in poverty due to loss of productive assets.  \n \nThis  vulnerability  is  further  aggravated  by  the  lack  of  basic  urban  infrsstructure.  A  high  degree  of  nonincome  poverty \nresults from the lack of basic urban  infrastructure; access varies  widely  across  provinces and districts. Using  water and \nsanitation as an example, while 95.8% of the population in Colombo have access to safe drinking water, only 58.6% of the \npopulation in Ratnapura have access.e Similarly 97.6% of the population in Matara have latrine facilities while only 28.4% \nin Batticaloa have such facilities.  \n \nA field-level analysis was conducted in 22 LAs through (i) information collection from LAs; (ii) key informant interviews in \nLAs;  (iii)  focus  group  discussions  with  stakeholders  including  subproject  beneficiaries,  community-based  and  other  civic \norganizations,  and  basic  urban  service  providers;  (iv)  participatory  needs  assessment  aimed  at  identifying  basic \ninfrastructure needs and priorities; (v) strengths-weaknesses-opportunities-threats analysis involving stakeholders; and (vi) \nquestionnaire for potential beneficiaries. The analysis shows that poor households have very limited access to basic urban \ninfrastructure.  For  example,  the  analysis  shows  that  a  third  of  the  lowest-income  households,  with  average  monthly \nhousehold incomes of less than SLRs1,000, have no access to safe drinking water. Of these low-income households only \n50% had access to sanitation.  \n \nParticipatory assessment identifies improved drinking water supply and access roads for improved economic opportunities \nas the most important needs of LAs, particularly in rural areas. Eight of 22 LAs surveyed (37%) identified water supply as \ntheir  first  priority  while  18%  identified  access  roads.  The  lack  of  access  to  safe  drinking  water  required  households  to \nspend  considerable  time  and  effort  in  fetching  water.  This  burden  was  especially  pronounced  for  poor  households  and \nfemale members of these households. Public health issues arise from the use of unprotected water sources for drinking\u2014\nthis  increases  the  burden  on  poor  households.  Inadequate  access  roads  limit  the  marketing  of  produce  from  poor \ncommunities.  The  lack  of  access  roads  also  increases  the  difficulties  in  accessing  basic  urban  infrastructure  such  as \nhealth  centers  and  schools.  Children  in  poor  communities  walk  several  kilometers  to  attend  school.  The  participatory \nneeds  assessment  also  identified  the  need  for  sanitation,  drainage,  improved  solid  waste  management,  and  improved \ninstitutional infrastructure.  \n \nBy  strengthening  LA  capacity  and  providing  basic  urban  infrastructure,  an  enabling  environment  will  be  created  for \ndelivering basic infrastructure services in a sustained manner. The Project\u2019s LA selection criteria ensure that the Project \nwill consider and prioritize LAs where poverty is high and basic infrastructure services are lacking. The Project provides \ndirect  benefits  through  increased  access  to  basic  urban  infrastructure  and  services,  and  enhances  the  potential  for \ninvestments  and  economic  growth  in  poor  areas.  Key  benefits  expressed  by  stakeholders  include  enabling  small \nproducers to market products without experiencing hardships and exploitation from agents and reduced social exclusion \nwith increased transportation and mobility from access roads; increased time for productive labor for income generation; \nand improved health from improved access to drinking  water. Solid  waste subprojects will provide better  waste disposal \nfacilities to nearly half of the LA population. Water supply and sanitation subprojects are aimed at serving at least one fifth \nof the LA population currently severely constrained due to lack of access to or the poor quality of current infrastructure and \nservices. The Project, through the provision of basic urban infrastructure and services, will promote human development \nenvisioned to enable the poor to take advantage of potential social and economic resources and opportunities. \n\n \n\n   No \n\n    Yes \n\nParticipation Process \n\n \nC. \nIs there a stakeholder analysis:                      \n \nExtensive community consultation was undertaken in 22 representative LAs. This included (i) information collection from \nLAs;  (ii)  key  informant  interviews  in  22  LAs;  (iii)  focus  group  discussions  in  22  LAs  involving  357  stakeholders  such  as \nsubproject  beneficiaries  (including  potentially  vulnerable  groups  such  as  poor  and  low  income  groups);  nongovernment, \ncommunity-based, and other  civic organizations; and basic urban service providers; (iv) participatory needs assessment \naimed  at  identifying  basic  infrastructure  needs  and  priorities  through  16  group  discussions;  (v)  analysis  of  strengths, \nweaknesses,  opportunities,  and  threats  in  12  LAs  involving  stakeholders;  and  (vi)  questionnaire  for  234  potential \nbeneficiaries.  These  activities  aimed  at  ascertaining  stakeholders\u2019  response  to  improved  infrastructure  services;  the \ncommunities\u2019  needs  and  demands;  affordability;  and  impacts  on  women,  indigenous  people,  estate  plantation  workers, \ndifferent ethnicities, small farmers, and other disadvantaged groups. Community and stakeholder consultations reveal the \nfollowing: (i) better access roads will give the poor access to services, decrease travel time, and provide better access to \nmarkets  and  educational  facilities;  this  is  perceived  as  a  major  project  benefit;  (ii)  safe  drinking  water  saves  time  for \nwomen for additional income-earning opportunities, and improve health and hygienic conditions; these are perceived to be \nmajor project benefits; (iii) communities are prepared to pay for improved services, and the operation and maintenance of \nsubprojects; and (iv) they perceive that increased access to services will reduce poverty and improve quality of life. \n\n\f                                                                                                  \n\n                   Appendix 10 \n\n53\n\n   No \n\n    Yes \n\n \nIs there a participation strategy:                             \n \nMuch  of  the  Project  will  be  implemented  through  stakeholder  participation  and  consultations  using  a  community-driven \napproach  (including  United  Nations  Development  Programme  and  United  Nations-Habitat  Sustainable  Cities  Program). \nSubproject  identification,  formulation,  design,  and  selection  will  be  carried  out  through  community  consultations.  During \nthe social analysis, community preferences were identified. Local participation in the subprojects through active civic and \ncommunity-based  organizations  will  be  encouraged.  During  the  field  analysis  some  active  local  nongovernment \norganizations were found to be engaged in solid waste management, recycling, and implementation of low-cost sanitation \nand toilet facilities in some LAs. Beneficiary participation and the involvement of all stakeholders including nongovernmen, \ncivic, and community-based organizations will promote a bottom- up participatory process, proven effective and successful \nin other ongoing aid-supported projects in the sector.   \n \n\n \nGender and Development \nD. \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nNational indicators show that women in Sri Lanka have an equivalent status to men in terms of education (literacy rate for \nwomen is 89.2% compared with men at 92.3%; net enrolment ratio for girls is 95.6% for ages 6\u201310 and 97.1% for boys), \nhealth (life expectancy is 76.4 for women, 71.7 for men; infant mortality is 15.6 per 1,000 girls, 22.6 per 1,000 boys), and \npoverty  (percentage  of  poor  households  headed  by  women  is  21.5%  compared  with  23.0%  for  households  headed  by \nmen).  However,  the  labor  force  participation  rate  for  women  is  only  33.6%  compared  with  67.9%  for  men,  and  female \nprofessional and technical workers comprise only 22.9% of total workers. \n \nFocus group discussions and field investigations show that in the project areas, women bear the primarily responsibility for \nmanaging the domestic environment. Their tasks include water collection and ensuring solid waste disposal. The Project \nwill benefit  women largely through reduced  time for collecting  water and  other  household chores related to  disposing  of \nsolid  waste.  This  reduces  their  burden  from  manual  work,  increases  time  for  productive  activities,  which  will  raise \nhousehold  income  and  potentially  their  status  in  the  household,  and  increase  social  and  leisure  time.  Other  externally \nsupported  projects  (including  United  Nations  Development  Programme  and  United  Nations-Habitat  Sustainable  Cities \nProgram) in Sri Lanka have consistently demonstrated that women in poverty reduction programs involving water supply, \nsanitation,  and  microfinance  have  elicited  women\u2019s  active  participation  and  benefited  women.  Other  benefits  from  the \nProject are likely to benefit women and men equally. Subproject design will ensure women are provided equal access to \npotential  skills  training  and  employment  opportunities,  and  promote  women\u2019s  active  participation  in  community-based \nbasic urban infrastructure provision and management. \n \nHas an output been prepared?                               \n \nE. \n\nSocial Safeguards and Other Social Risks \n\n    Yes \n\n          \n\n   No \n\n \n\n \n\nIssues \n\nResettlement \n\nAffordability \n\nLabor \n\nPlan \nPrepared \n\nResettlement \nFramework \n\nSignificant/Not \nSignificant/ \nUncertain/ None \n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None  \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None  \n\n Significant \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nthat \n\nNo  significant  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is \nexpected  to  take  place.

If  any  land  acquisition  and \ninvoluntary  resettlement  will  be  required  in  subprojects, \nthe Government will follow the resettlement framework.  \nFocus  group  discussions  show  that  direct  and  indirect \npayment  burdens  on  beneficiaries  must  be  affordable. \nBased on the survey undertaken during the field analysis \nof 154 households, 70% were willing to pay SLRs200 or \nmore  (up  to  amounts  beyond  SLRs500)  per  month.f \nCommunities also expressed willingness to contribute to \noperation and maintenance for other subprojects.  \nThe Project will not result in negative labor impacts.
