THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Shaanxi Green Intelligent Transport and Logistics \nManagement Demonstration Project. The project will support Shaanxi Province in developing and \ndemonstrating  climate-resilient  and  green  intelligent  transport,  logistics,  and  supply  chain \nmanagement ecosystems for low-carbon growth. \n \n2.  The PRC is the world\u2019s largest emitter of greenhouse gases (GHGs), and mitigating these \nemissions requires large-scale integration of low-carbon development solutions. The proposed \nproject will assist Shaanxi Province in reducing GHG emissions by improving operations, facilities, \nand safety in the transport and logistics sector. The development of multimodal logistics systems \nand financial intermediation facility will also support private sector development, increasing \nparticipation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the provision of logistics services. \nThe adoption of Group of Twenty (G20) principles1 for high-quality infrastructure investments will \ntransform Shaanxi Province into a low-carbon region and demonstrate innovative approaches to \nenvironmental protection in the Yellow River Basin.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  National commitment to low-carbon development and air quality improvement.  \nThe PRC, the world\u2019s largest emitter of GHGs, is committed to addressing the issue of global \nwarming. The PRC is a signatory to the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change, and its Nationally Determined Contribution includes an ambitious \ntarget to peak carbon emissions by 2030; and has recently announced its goal to be carbon \nneutral by 2060. Environmental sustainability is a priority for the government, and innovative \ngreen development is one of the five core development principles in the PRC\u2019s Thirteenth Five-\nYear Plan, 2016\u20132020. As part of this effort, the government aims to maintain acceptable national \nair quality levels in major cities for 80% of days by the end of 2020. \n \n4.  Role of the transport and logistics sector in reducing emissions. The transport and \nlogistics sector in the PRC is a rapidly growing source of GHG emissions and other air pollution. \nCarbon dioxide (CO ) equivalent emissions from the transport sector were 827.9 million tons \n2\n(8.6% of national emissions) in 2014.3 In the last decade, this share has been increasing at an \naverage annual rate of 2.8%. Unless actions are taken earlier to adopt low-carbon technologies, \nthe PRC transport sector will continue to contribute to GHG emissions.4  Reducing GHG emissions \nfrom the transport sector is crucial to achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement. The future \nvision and road map of the PRC\u2019s transport and logistics sector is presented in the Outline for \nBuilding the PRC\u2019s Strength in Transport.5 The document prioritizes (i) establishing a green, low-\ncarbon, and efficient modern logistics system; and (ii) accelerating the development of new \nbusiness modes. The National Logistics Hub Planning and Construction Plan provides a road \n \n1  Government of Japan, Ministry of Finance. G20 Principles for Quality Infrastructure Investment.

The transport and logistics \nsector in Shaanxi Province plays an important and strategic role in supporting provincial and \nnational economic activity. Xi\u2019an, the capital and main first-tier city of Shaanxi Province, functions \nas a major hub for national and international traffic, and this role is expanding rapidly. The total \nvalue of goods handled by logistics facilities in Shaanxi Province increased from CNY3.6 trillion \nin 2014 to CNY5.1 trillion in 2018, an average annual increase of 9.1%.7 However, the logistics \nindustry in Xi\u2019an has not evolved to meet the increase in service requirements, and future growth is \nconstrained by a lack of capacity and modern logistics facilities. The per capita storage capacity of \nXi\u2019an is 0.8 cubic meters, which is far lower than other first-tier cities in the PRC, e.g., the per capita \nstorage capacity of Shanghai is 1.8 cubic meters.8 Logistics facilities in second-tier cities of \nShaanxi such as Ankang and Yan\u2019an need to be developed to decentralize operations and \ndecongest Xi\u2019an. Refrigerated warehouse capacity in the PRC is concentrated in wealthier \nprovinces, and the lack of adequate cold storage facilities and refrigerated trucks in Shaanxi \nProvince results in the contamination, spoilage, and wastage of food and medicines.9 \n \n6.  The transport terminals in Xi\u2019an include numerous small private facilities in the inner city \nwithin the ring road. This concentration leads to heavy freight traffic in the area, contributing to \ncongestion and air pollution. Xi\u2019an is ranked as the eighth most congested city in the PRC.  \nThe municipal government of Xi\u2019an has imposed restrictions on the movement of trucks in the city \nduring certain times of the day to mitigate the congestion and pollution, but these measures \nincrease logistics costs and delays. Freight transport in Shaanxi Province is dominated by road-\nbased movements, with 75% of freight by volume transported by road, 24% by railway, and 1% \nby inland waterways. Increasing the volume of freight transported by railway and inland waterways \nwould reduce GHG emissions and logistics costs but integrating these different transport modes \nrequires modernized and efficient multimodal logistics facilities. \n \n7.  Logistics facilities in Shaanxi Province use suboptimal cargo handling methods, including \nsemi-mechanical loading and unloading systems, energy-inefficient technologies, and outdated \nlogistics operations, all of which contribute to higher costs and GHG emissions. Automation of \nlogistics  management  systems  consistent  with  G20  high-quality  principles  can  improve \nefficiencies, reduce costs, and lower the consumption of energy and materials. The information \nand communications technology (ICT) systems are not integrated, and the absence of real-time \ntraffic monitoring contributes to congestion and delays in responses to accidents. The main \nplayers in logistics operations in Shaanxi Province are private SMEs acting under government \nregulations and policy incentives. Most of these SMEs offer limited logistics services, are not \nintegrated,  and  have  limited  access  to  technical  and  financial  resources  to  upgrade  their \noperations.10 \n \n8.  Shaanxi Province\u2019s commitment to low-carbon development. The Shaanxi Provincial \nGovernment, in line with the national government\u2019s priorities, is working to reduce GHG emissions \nfrom the transport and logistics sector, which comprise 9% of Shaanxi Province\u2019s total emissions. \n \n6  Government of the PRC, National Development and Reform Commission and Ministry of Transport. 2019. National \nLogistics Hub Cities Plan. Beijing. \n7  Shaanxi Provincial Government. 2018. Status and Analysis of Logistics Industry in Shaanxi, 2018. Xi\u2019an. \n8  The current total storage capacity is 83,000 m2, and the utilization rate is above 95%. No specific data is available \nfor Ankang, but the lack of storage capacity is considered more severe compared to Yan\u2019an. \n9  Deloitte. 2015. Investment Promotion Report of China's Logistics Industry 2014\u20132015, Simplified Version. Shanghai. \n10 A very limited number of large international and domestics operators are based in Shaanxi Province. \n ", "3 \nThe target set by the Shaanxi Provincial Government during the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan is to \nreduce CO  emission intensity (CO  emissions per unit of gross domestic product) by 18% in 2020 \n2 2\nfrom the 2015 level.11   \n \n9.  The Shaanxi Provincial Government recognizes the key role of the transport and logistics \nsector in reducing GHG emissions. Its medium- and long-term development plan for the logistics \nindustry identifies the following challenges: (i) the need for greening and transforming the logistics \nindustry; (ii) limited awareness about innovative logistics concepts; (iii) low capacity of logistics \noperators,  especially  SMEs;  (iv)  lack  of  a  logistics  service  network;  and  (v)  weak  policy \nimplementation. The Shaanxi Port Development Initiative, included in the Thirteenth Five-Year \nPlan, is addressing the concentration of logistics facilities in the center of Xi\u2019an, which is one of \nthe main causes of operational inefficiencies in delivering logistics services in Shaanxi Province. \nThis initiative includes a decongestion plan to move some logistics activities from the center of \nXi\u2019an to peripheral locations and to establish logistics facilities in other cities in Shaanxi Province, \nincluding  Ankang  and  Yan\u2019an.  The  Shaanxi  Provincial  Government  is  also  supporting  the \nimplementation of the National Logistics Hub Planning and Construction Plan (para. 4), which has \ndesignated Xi\u2019an and Yan\u2019an as national demonstration hubs for sector innovations.12 \n \n10.  Demonstrating green intelligent transport and logistics management in Shaanxi \nProvince. The project will demonstrate how improving operations in the transport and logistics \ncapacities can contribute to a reduction in GHG emissions and other air pollution in Shaanxi \nProvince. The project will establish multimodal systems and climate-friendly logistics facilities in \nAnkang, Xi\u2019an, and Yan\u2019an. Multimodal centers will support the shift of freight transport from roads \nto railway, lowering the energy and carbon intensity of the sector. The logistics facilities in Xi\u2019an \nwill improve market connectivity and agricultural value chain linkages between local farmers, \nagribusiness, and markets. The project will develop an integrated information technology platform \nthat will connect all the facilities with the Shaanxi Provincial Transport Department (SPTD) \nsystems to facilitate better traffic planning and management. The project\u2019s financial intermediation \nprogram will help SMEs (at least 30% of which will be managed by women) leverage private \nsector funding to green and modernize their logistics operations. The project will engage with the \nprivate sector and explore partnerships to operate and maintain facilities, where possible. The \nproject will also improve capacity and knowledge sharing, including developing a strategy to \nimprove  the  capacity  of  the  SPTD  and  the  logistics  industry  to  take  advantage  of  future \nopportunities. \n \n11.  Alignment  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030.  The  project  will  focus  on  two  of  the  seven \noperational priorities of Strategy 2030 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB): operational priority 3 \n(tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental \nsustainability); and operational priority 4 (making cities more livable).13 This will be achieved by \ndeveloping more efficient, safe, green, and sustainable logistics systems as identified in ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan for the PRC, 2019\u20132021.14 \n \n12.

Demonstration effect. The climate-friendly, green, and intelligent logistics facilities will \nsupport  capacity  building  in  Shaanxi  Province  to  achieve  net  zero  emissions  logistics \ninfrastructure based on the best practices followed by some of the leading international private \nlogistics service providers. The experience and knowledge gained from the innovative designs \nand interventions can be replicated in other cities in and outside the PRC through workshops and \nregional forums like the ADB transport forum. \n \n14.  Relevance in the COVID-19 situation. In emergency pandemic situations, it is essential \nto maintain supply chains for essential goods and services. In line with the recommendations of \nthe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the project enables better logistics \nfacilities and processes to store food and agricultural produce, and supports maintenance of \nmarket access and distribution channels.16 The facilities developed by the project will also \nstrengthen Shaanxi Province\u2019s capacity to store and distribute medicine and vaccines. The smart \nfeatures designed in the project will enable better quality assurance and efficient inventory \nmanagement of medical products. Also, the project will introduce sanitary and phytosanitary \nprocesses in the cold storage facilities that help in the containment of animal-borne diseases, \nzoonoses, and contaminants. \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n15.  The project is aligned with the following impact: green economic development in Shaanxi \nProvince enhanced (footnote 12). \n \n16.  The project will have the following outcome: low-carbon, efficient, and climate-friendly \nlogistics services in Shaanxi Province improved.17 \n \n17.  Output 1: Low-carbon and intelligent logistics facilities and transport systems \ndesigned  and  demonstrated.  This  output  will  develop  low-carbon  and  intelligent  logistics \nfacilities and transport systems in strategic locations throughout Shaanxi Province.

The funding arrangement to SMEs will \nfacilitate the provision of greener and more efficient logistics services, and also support gender \ninclusiveness by earmarking at least 30% of the financing for SMEs managed by women. \n \n19.  Output 3: Knowledge on green intelligent transport and logistics management \nshared and replicated. The output will (i) expose the project implementing entities (PIEs) to \ninternational best practices outside the PRC and roll out training programs focused on these best \npractices and low-carbon technologies; (ii) roll out knowledge-sharing programs, workshops and \npublications, and Shaanxi logistics expos; and (iii) train the SPTD to review its priorities, and \nidentify future challenges and opportunities for logistics management in Shaanxi Province. The \nShaanxi  experience  will  be  disseminated  through  national  and  international  fora  thereby \nfacilitating the replication of best practices of the Project within and outside the PRC. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n20.  ADB and German development cooperation through KfW supported the government in \ndesigning the project by providing expert resources to incorporate international best practices.19  \nIn addition, ADB\u2019s intervention helped develop the SPTD\u2019s capacity to include green and low-\ncarbon design components in the project, including concepts that improve the efficiency of \noperations.20 A joint report with KfW was prepared, which resulted in incorporating additional low-\ncarbon development features in the project design, such as solar-based power, the construction \nof energy management systems for the logistics facilities, and sponge city elements.21 The project \nhas further developed the work done by other development partners, such as the World Bank and \nGerman development cooperation through KfW, to green the sector and lower GHG emissions.22 \nThe  project  was  designed  to  have  a  significant  impact  in  Shaanxi  Province;  this scale  of \nintervention was made possible through cofinancing from German development cooperation \nthrough KfW. In addition, through the financial intermediation loan component, the project will help \nSMEs to access additional private domestic financing, including from the identified entrusted \nbank. This will help the SMEs transform their operations to adopt green and smart business \npractices. \n \n \n \n18 Sponge city techniques in logistics facilities refers to structures that are designed to absorb rainwater and utilize it to \nreduce floods. \n19 ADB.

The SPTD will be the executing agency for the project. The Foreign Capital Utilization \nCenter (FCUC) of the SPTD will be the implementing agency. The FCUC will establish the project \nmanagement office under the SPTD. The five PIEs, which are state-owned enterprises, as owners \nof  the  facilities,  will  implement  the  different  components  of  the  project  under  the  FCUC\u2019s \ncoordination. The PIEs are (i) Shaanxi Railway Investment Logistics Company Limited, (ii) Yan\u2019an \nNew District Municipal Public Utilities Company Limited, (iii) Ankang Henkou Demonstration Zone \nInvestment  and  Development  Corporation,  (iv)  Shaanxi  Provincial  Traffic  Monitoring  and \nOperations Center, and (v) Shaanxi Provincial Communication investment Group Company \nLimited. The Ministry of Finance will relend to Shaanxi Provincial Finance Department (SPFD); \nthe SPFD will onlend to the SPTD, Yan\u2019an City Government, and Ankang Municipal Government \nand who will further onlend to the PIEs. The provision of FIL under output 2 will be administered \nby Shaanxi Provincial Communication Investment Group Co. Ltd., for which an FIL account will \nbe established at the BOC Shaanxi under an FIL facility management agreement between the \nSPFD and BOC. Specific selection criteria, such as modernizing operations of SMEs by using \ngreen and smart practices, will be used. Also, funds flow and accounting arrangements for the \nFIL are provided in the PAM (footnote 23). The FCUC will recruit the PMC to assist with project \nmanagement,  technical  support,  safeguards  monitoring  and  implementation  of  the  social \ndevelopment action plan, and the communication strategy. The PMC will also cater to the \nreporting needs of ADB and KfW. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 \nand described in detail in the PAM (footnote 23).

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n26.  The project is technically viable based on the feasibility studies conducted separately for \nthe  components  under  output  1  (para.  17)  and  the  provincial  logistics  information  and \ncommunication technology system of output 2 (para. 18). The studies of the logistics parks \nincluded the following attributes: (i) technical design of the facilities to meet the projected demand; \n(ii) location, scale, and layout; (iii) traffic management; and (iv) the construction plan. Suitable \nengineering solutions were selected based on cost-effectiveness; climate, environmental, and \nsocial impacts; and compliance with domestic standards in the PRC consistent with the adoption \nof international best practices. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n27.  Economic analysis. The economic viability of the project and its outputs were assessed. \nThe project is economically viable, with an estimated economic internal rate of return of 12.7% and \na  net  present  value  of CNY1,833.1  million  at  a  9.0%  discount  rate.  All  project  outputs  are \neconomically viable. Six categories of economic benefits have been quantified: (i) reductions in \nGHG emissions; (ii) cost savings in the handling of cargo, particularly through automated loading \nand unloading operations; (iii) savings from the reduction of traffic congestion; (iv) additional storage \nspace; (v) reductions in transport costs; and (vi) reductions in shipping time. Also, the project will \ngenerate benefits from reduced air pollution (other than GHGs) and traffic crashes, but these have \nnot been quantified because of the lack of available data. Sensitivity analysis shows that the \nproject remains economically viable under likely scenarios. The capital cost would have to \nincrease by 38% or total benefits would have to decrease by 22% for the rate of return to decrease \nto the threshold.24 \n \n28.  Financial  analysis.  The  analysis  included  (i)  financial  evaluations  of  the  revenue-\ngenerating components to determine the project\u2019s financial viability and  (ii) an  incremental \nrecurrent  cost  analysis  of  the  SPTD  to  examine  the  project\u2019s  financial  sustainability.25  \nThe  financial  evaluations  reveal  that  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  of  each  revenue-\ngenerating subproject exceeds the weighted average cost of capital, indicating that the project is \nfinancially viable. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the project remains financially viable when it \nis influenced by adverse changes in key quantifiable variables. Due diligence conducted on BOC, \nthe entrusted bank, confirmed that it is financially sound and meets the financial obligations and \n \n24 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nADB\u2019s eligibility criteria for the proposed FIL component. Integrity due diligence confirmed that \nBOC complies with ADB\u2019s integrity standards. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n29.  The SPTD will be responsible for funding the costs of operation and maintenance (O&M) \nof the project. The financial sustainability analysis demonstrates that the SPTD will have sufficient \nfinancial resources to cover the incremental recurrent costs for O&M for the project. Further, the \nPIEs are exploring engagement of private sector entities for O&M. Two of the five PIEs\u2014Ankang \nHenkou Demonstration Zone Investment and Development Corporation, and Shaanxi Provincial \nCommunication Investment Group Co. Ltd. will explore forming a strategic alliance with leading \nprivate sector logistics management companies to operate and maintain the facilities. Further, a \ncommercial bank will implement the FIL component. The facilities incorporate climate-friendly \nsolutions, such as use of renewable energy sources and water conservation adopting sponge city \nmethods. Smart systems used in the projects enable data-based management solutions. Based \non the climate risk and adaptation assessment, various adaptation options were proposed to \naddress future climate risks. These include designing sufficient cooling capacity and adopting \nequipment with high energy efficiency for the extreme high temperature risks and increasing \ndesign standards for stormwater management systems for an increase of 6%\u201310% flooding \nintensity. The subprojects are required to develop appropriate operational procedures to adapt to \nand minimize climate risks. These initiatives, coupled with strong commitments by the SPTD and \nPIEs, make the project interventions sustainable. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n30.  Financial  management.  The  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Management  Assessment  Technical  Guidance  Note.26  \nAn assessment of the financial management capacity of the executing agency, implementing \nagency,  and  PIEs  confirmed  that  all  have  adequate  financial  management  systems  and \nprocedures in place to implement the project efficiently. The financial management risk is rated \nmoderate.  Given  that  the  PIEs  are  less  familiar  with  ADB  loan  proceeds  disbursement \nrequirements and procedures, a financial management specialist has been included in the PMC \nteam,  and  on-the-job  training  in  ADB  disbursements  will  be  provided  to  improve  project \nimplementation efficiency further. \n \n31.  Procurement and anticorruption. A strategic procurement planning review was carried \nout to identify procurement risks, develop mitigating measures, review procurement options, and \nagree on fit-for-purpose procurement arrangements, considering the procurement capacity of the \nPIEs, executing agency, and implementing agency, as well as the market context. Value for money \nwill be achieved by using advance contracting as well as counterpart financing to leverage \nimplementation efficiency from procurement-ready packages. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, \nas amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 23). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n32.  The project will benefit citizens in three project cities, including 7.32 million women \n(49.02%), 5.33 million rural residents (35.71%), 0.38 million poor people (2.54%), and 0.13 million \nethnic minority people (0.90%). The development of a transport and logistics management system \n \n26 ADB. 2015. Financial Management Technical Guidance Note. Manila. \n ", "10 \nthroughout Shaanxi will provide a more livable environment, contribute to improved health \noutcomes, lower GHG emissions, and support business development needs of SMEs in Shaanxi \nProvince. Likewise, the project will directly create 973 job opportunities during construction and \n904 during the operation period. \n \n33.  The project is categorized some gender elements. Gender assessment was conducted, \nand the project identified opportunities to strengthen skills training for women, particularly in green \nand smart logistics management. Interviews and survey with the Shaanxi Women\u2019s Enterprise \nAssociation and female-owned logistics operators indicate that SMEs led by women continue to \nface  barriers  in  accessing  financial  services  and  knowledge  on  green  logistics.  A  social \ndevelopment and gender action plan (SDGAP) has been developed to support the following:  \n(i) public\u2013private partnership and green logistics skills training opportunities for at least 30% \nwomen staff of the SPTD and PIEs, (ii) training on new IT skills is conducted for at least 80% of \nthe female IT professionals in the SPTD, (iii) at least 30% of SMEs financed through the FIL are \nled by women, (iv) at least 50% of the participants in the awareness-raising activities about green \nand intelligent logistics are women, (v) at least 30% of jobs generated by the project are provided \nto women, and (vi) sex-disaggregated data is collected.27 A social and gender development \nspecialist will be engaged for SDGAP implementation. Semiannual SDGAP monitoring and \nreporting will be carried out by an external monitor. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n34.  Environment (category B). Initial environmental examinations, including environmental \nmanagement plans (EMPs), were prepared following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) \nand the PRC national regulations for the project. An environment and social management system \nwas developed for the FIL component. The executing and implementing agencies are committed \nto implementing the agreed EMPs and environment and social management system. None of the \nsubprojects will involve environmentally sensitive ecosystems or cultural heritage sites. The FIL \nwill exclude environment category A subprojects from ADB financing. Potential impacts during \nconstruction and operation\u2014including soil erosion, noise, dust emissions, construction waste and \nwastewater,  and  occupational  and  community  health  and  safety\u2014are  mostly  temporary, \npredictable, and reversible, and can be mitigated through adherence to national regulations and \nimplementation of the EMPs. Potential impacts during operation\u2014which include wastewater, \nlocomotive and vehicle exhaust, dust generated from loading and unloading, noise and vibration, \ndomestic and kitchen waste, packaging and hazardous (oily) waste, and occupational and \ncommunity  health  and  safety\u2014will  be  mitigated  through  the  implementation  of  the  EMPs. \nMeaningful public consultations have been conducted. Grievance redress mechanisms will be \nestablished. Sufficient budget has been allocated in the EMPs to ensure proper implementation \nof  mitigation  and  monitoring  measures  during  construction  and  operation.  Environmental \nmonitoring reports will be submitted to ADB semiannually during construction and annually during \noperation. Initial environmental examinations will be updated as necessary and disclosed on the \nADB website if unanticipated impacts are identified during project implementation. A climate risk \nand adaptation assessment has been conducted and the findings of the assessment will be \nincorporated in the project design. \n \n35.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). A total of 2,035.26 mu of land is required for \nimplementing facilities identified in output 1 (para. 17).28 All prior land acquisition and house \ndemolition conducted were not in anticipation of ADB financing. Except for the Civilian Aerospace \n \n27 Social Development and Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 m2). \n ", "11 \nPark  (where  limited  information  was  obtained  during  due  diligence,  land  acquisition,  and \nresettlement), implementation for the other facilities were assessed based on ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement requirements.29 There are no outstanding or legacy issues on the land allocated \nfor the Railroad Multimodal Commodity Logistics Park and YGUDDA facilities. However, for the \nAnkang  Inland  Port  Logistics  Park  subproject,  there  are  175  households  affected  by  land \nacquisition that have yet to receive their compensation payment by December 2020. In the Hi-\nCity Park in Xi\u2019an there are 24 affected households that received full payment but are still in \ntransition  as  construction  of  their  permanent  relocation  houses  is  yet  to  be  completed.30  \nThe respective PIEs have committed to time-bound corrective actions as specified in the due \ndiligence reports. Further, an external monitor will be engaged, and semiannual monitoring \nreports will be submitted to ADB. Under the FIL component, subprojects classified as category A \nor B for involuntary resettlement are excluded from ADB financing. \n \n36.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The population of scattered ethnic minorities in the \nthree project cities accounts for 0.9% of the total municipal population. The project will benefit all \nresidents, and it does not have differential impacts on any specific ethnic minority communities \nthat would trigger ADB\u2019s indigenous peoples policy requirements. The social analysis has confirmed \nthat they will not suffer any adverse impacts because of the project.31 Under the FIL component, \nsubprojects classified as category A or B for indigenous peoples are excluded from ADB financing. \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n37.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.32 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nInefficient  O&M  of  A study on future improvements in logistics will be conducted under the \nlogistics facilities  project.
