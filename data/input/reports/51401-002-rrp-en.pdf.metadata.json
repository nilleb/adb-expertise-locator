However, it does not fall under the eligibility criteria for climate mitigation finance as defined by the\njoint multilateral development bank methodology on tracking climate finance, which notes that not all activities that reduce greenhouse gases in the short\nterm are eligible to be counted towards climate mitigation finance. Accordingly, greenfield fossil fuel projects are excluded, and climate mitigation finance\nis considered zero.\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank\nThis document must only be generated in eOps.\n\n26102020142441962869\n\nGenerated Date: 27-Oct-2020 14:31:48 PM\n\n\f0\n\n20\n\n50\n\nKilometers (km)\n\nFuping\n\nHANZHONG\nXixiang\n\n\u0000\u0000  \u0000\u0000\u2019No\n\nGANSU\n\nBinxian\n\nXIANYANG\n\no\n\u0000\u0000\u0000  \u0000\u0000\u2019E\n\nTongchuan\n\nWEINAN\n\no\n\u0000\u0000\u0000  \u0000\u0000\u2019E\n\no\n\u0000\u0000\u0000  \u0000\u0000\u2019E\nMap of Shaanxi Province \n\nPucheng\n\nDali\n\nINNER MONGOLIA\nAUTONOMOUS REGION\n\nYULIN\n\nQianxian\n\nXianyang\n\nXI\u2019AN\n\nBaoji\n\n\u0000\u0000  \u0000\u0000\u2019No\n\nTaibai\n\n\u0000\nXI'ANXI'AN\n\n\u0000\n\n\u0000\n\nLintong\n\nWeinan\n\n\u0000\u0000  \u0000\u0000\u2019No\n\nNINGXIA HUI  \nAUTONOMOUS\nREGION\n\nFuping\n\nSHANGLUO\n\nGANSU\n\nSHANXI\n\nYAN'AN\n\nTONGCHUAN\n\nXIANYANG\n\nSHAANXI\nSHAANXI\n\nWEINAN\n\nHUBEI\n\nBAOJI\n\nXI\u2019AN\n\nHENAN\n\nSHANGLUO\n\nHANZHONG\n\no\n\n\u0000\u0000  \u0000\u0000\u2019N\n\nSHANGLUO\n\nANKANG\n\no\n\n\u0000\u0000  \u0000\u0000\u2019N\n\nHUBEI\n\nZhen'an\n\no\n\u0000\u0000\u0000  \u0000\u0000\u2019E\n\no\n\u0000\u0000\u0000  \u0000\u0000\u2019E\n\nZhen'an\n\nANKANG\n\nAnkang\n\u0000\n\nBaihe\n\n\u0000\u0000  \u0000\u0000\u2019No\n\nPingli\n\nHUBEI\n\nSICHUAN\n\no\n\u0000\u0000\u0000  \u0000\u0000\u2019E\n\nCHONGQING\n\no\n\u0000\u0000\u0000  \u0000\u0000\u2019E\n\nSHAANXI GREEN INTELLIGENT\nTRANSPORT AND LOGISTICS\nMANAGEMENT DEMONSTRATION\nPROJECT\nIN THE\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA \n\n\u0000\n\n\u0000\n\n\u0000\n\n\u0000\n\n\u0000\n\nCivilian Aerospace New Town Logistics Park Subproject\n\nRailroad Multimodal Bulk Commodity Logistics Park in Xi'an Subproject\n\nAnkang Hengkou Demonstration Zone Subproject\n\nYan'an Green Urban District Demonstration Area Subproject\n\nSICHUAN\n\n0\n\n20\n\n50\n\nKilometers (km)\n\nCHONGQING\no\n\u0000\u0000\u0000  \u0000\u0000\u2019E\n\nYULIN\n\no\n\u0000\u0000\u0000  \u0000\u0000\u2019E\n\nSuide\n\nXi'an High-tech New Town Logistics Park Subproject\n\nWuqi\n\nZhidan\n\n\u0000\u0000  \u0000\u0000\u2019No\n\nAnsai\n\nYanchuan\n\n\u0000\n\nYan'an\n\nYAN'AN\n\nQingjian\n\n\u0000\u0000  \u0000\u0000\u2019No\n\nYichuan\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nRoad\n\nRiver\n\nPrefecture Boundary\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nGANSU\n\nFuxian\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\n0\n\n20\n\n50\n\nHuanglong\n\nKilometers (km)\n\nTONGCHUAN\n\no\n\u0000\u0000\u0000  \u0000\u0000\u2019E\n\nWEINAN\n\nThis map was produced by the cartography unit of the Asian Development Bank. \nThe boundaries, colors, denominations, and any other information shown on this \nmap do not imply, on the part of the Asian Development Bank, any judgment on the \nlegal status of any territory, or any endorsement or acceptance of such boundaries, \ncolors, denominations, or information. \n\n\u0000\u0000-\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 AV\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Shaanxi Green Intelligent Transport and Logistics \nManagement Demonstration Project. The project will support Shaanxi Province in developing and \ndemonstrating  climate-resilient  and  green  intelligent  transport,  logistics,  and  supply  chain \nmanagement ecosystems for low-carbon growth. \n \nThe PRC is the world\u2019s largest emitter of greenhouse gases (GHGs), and mitigating these \n2. \nemissions requires  large-scale integration  of  low-carbon  development solutions.  The  proposed \nproject will assist Shaanxi Province in reducing GHG emissions by improving operations, facilities, \nand safety in the transport and logistics sector. The development of multimodal logistics systems \nand  financial  intermediation  facility  will  also  support  private  sector  development,  increasing \nparticipation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the provision of logistics services. \nThe adoption of Group of Twenty (G20) principles1 for high-quality infrastructure investments will \ntransform Shaanxi Province into a low-carbon region and demonstrate innovative approaches to \nenvironmental protection in the Yellow River Basin.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nNational  commitment  to  low-carbon  development  and  air  quality  improvement.  \nThe PRC,  the  world\u2019s  largest  emitter  of GHGs,  is  committed  to addressing  the  issue  of  global \nwarming. The PRC is a signatory to the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change, and its Nationally Determined Contribution includes an ambitious \ntarget  to  peak  carbon  emissions  by  2030;  and  has  recently  announced  its  goal  to  be  carbon \nneutral  by  2060.  Environmental  sustainability  is  a  priority  for  the  government,  and  innovative \ngreen development is one of the five core development principles in the PRC\u2019s Thirteenth Five-\nYear Plan, 2016\u20132020. As part of this effort, the government aims to maintain acceptable national \nair quality levels in major cities for 80% of days by the end of 2020. \n \nRole of the transport and logistics sector in reducing emissions. The transport and \n4. \nlogistics sector in the PRC is a rapidly growing source of GHG emissions and other air pollution. \nCarbon  dioxide  (CO2)  equivalent  emissions  from  the  transport  sector  were  827.9  million  tons \n(8.6% of national emissions) in 2014.3 In the last decade, this share has been increasing at an \naverage annual rate of 2.8%. Unless actions are taken earlier to adopt low-carbon technologies, \nthe PRC transport sector will continue to contribute to GHG emissions.4  Reducing GHG emissions \nfrom the transport sector is crucial to achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement. The future \nvision and road map of the PRC\u2019s transport and logistics sector is presented in the Outline for \nBuilding the PRC\u2019s Strength in Transport.5 The document prioritizes (i) establishing a green, low-\ncarbon,  and  efficient  modern  logistics  system;  and  (ii)  accelerating  the  development  of  new \nbusiness  modes.

The transport and logistics \nsector  in  Shaanxi  Province  plays  an  important  and  strategic  role  in  supporting  provincial  and \nnational economic activity. Xi\u2019an, the capital and main first-tier city of Shaanxi Province, functions \nas a major hub for national and international traffic, and this role is expanding rapidly. The total \nvalue of goods handled by logistics facilities in Shaanxi Province increased from CNY3.6 trillion \nin  2014  to  CNY5.1  trillion  in  2018,  an  average  annual  increase  of  9.1%.7  However,  the  logistics \nindustry in Xi\u2019an has not evolved to meet the increase in service requirements, and future growth is \nconstrained by a lack of capacity and modern logistics facilities. The per capita storage capacity of \nXi\u2019an is 0.8 cubic meters, which is far lower than other first-tier cities in the PRC, e.g., the per capita \nstorage  capacity  of  Shanghai  is  1.8  cubic  meters.8  Logistics  facilities  in  second-tier  cities  of \nShaanxi  such  as  Ankang  and  Yan\u2019an  need  to  be  developed  to  decentralize  operations  and \ndecongest  Xi\u2019an.  Refrigerated  warehouse  capacity  in  the  PRC  is  concentrated  in  wealthier \nprovinces,  and  the  lack  of  adequate  cold  storage  facilities  and  refrigerated  trucks  in  Shaanxi \nProvince results in the contamination, spoilage, and wastage of food and medicines.9 \n \n6. \nThe transport terminals in Xi\u2019an include numerous small private facilities in the inner city \nwithin the ring road. This concentration leads to heavy freight traffic in the area, contributing to \ncongestion  and  air  pollution.  Xi\u2019an  is  ranked  as  the  eighth  most  congested  city  in  the  PRC.  \nThe municipal government of Xi\u2019an has imposed restrictions on the movement of trucks in the city \nduring  certain  times  of  the  day  to  mitigate  the  congestion  and  pollution,  but  these  measures \nincrease logistics costs and delays. Freight transport in Shaanxi Province is dominated by road-\nbased movements, with 75% of freight by volume transported by road, 24% by railway, and 1% \nby inland waterways. Increasing the volume of freight transported by railway and inland waterways \nwould reduce GHG emissions and logistics costs but integrating these different transport modes \nrequires modernized and efficient multimodal logistics facilities. \n \n7. \nLogistics facilities in Shaanxi Province use suboptimal cargo handling methods, including \nsemi-mechanical loading and unloading systems, energy-inefficient technologies, and outdated \nlogistics operations, all of which contribute to higher costs and GHG emissions. Automation of \nlogistics  management  systems  consistent  with  G20  high-quality  principles  can  improve \nefficiencies, reduce costs, and lower the consumption of energy and materials. The information \nand communications technology (ICT) systems are not integrated, and the absence of real-time \ntraffic  monitoring  contributes  to  congestion  and  delays  in  responses  to  accidents.  The  main \nplayers in logistics operations in Shaanxi Province are private SMEs acting under government \nregulations  and  policy  incentives.  Most  of  these  SMEs  offer  limited  logistics  services,  are  not \nintegrated,  and  have  limited  access  to  technical  and  financial  resources  to  upgrade  their \noperations.10 \n \n8. \nShaanxi Province\u2019s commitment to low-carbon development. The Shaanxi Provincial \nGovernment, in line with the national government\u2019s priorities, is working to reduce GHG emissions \nfrom the transport and logistics sector, which comprise 9% of Shaanxi Province\u2019s total emissions. \n\nLogistics Hub Cities Plan.

Status and Analysis of Logistics Industry in Shaanxi, 2018. Xi\u2019an. \n8  The current total storage capacity is 83,000 m2, and the utilization rate is above 95%. No specific data is available \n\nfor Ankang, but the lack of storage capacity is considered more severe compared to Yan\u2019an. \n\n9  Deloitte. 2015. Investment Promotion Report of China's Logistics Industry 2014\u20132015, Simplified Version. Shanghai. \n10  A very limited number of large international and domestics operators are based in Shaanxi Province. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fThe target set by the Shaanxi Provincial Government during the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan is to \nreduce CO2 emission intensity (CO2 emissions per unit of gross domestic product) by 18% in 2020 \nfrom the 2015 level.11   \n \nThe Shaanxi Provincial Government recognizes the key role of the transport and logistics \n9. \nsector in reducing GHG emissions. Its medium- and long-term development plan for the logistics \nindustry identifies the following challenges: (i) the need for greening and transforming the logistics \nindustry; (ii) limited awareness about innovative logistics concepts; (iii) low capacity of logistics \noperators,  especially  SMEs;  (iv)  lack  of  a  logistics  service  network;  and  (v)  weak  policy \nimplementation.  The  Shaanxi  Port  Development  Initiative,  included  in the  Thirteenth  Five-Year \nPlan, is addressing the concentration of logistics facilities in the center of Xi\u2019an, which is one of \nthe main causes of operational inefficiencies in delivering logistics services in Shaanxi Province. \nThis initiative includes a decongestion plan to move some logistics activities from the center of \nXi\u2019an to peripheral locations and to establish logistics facilities in other cities in Shaanxi Province, \nincluding  Ankang  and  Yan\u2019an.  The  Shaanxi  Provincial  Government  is  also  supporting  the \nimplementation of the National Logistics Hub Planning and Construction Plan (para. 4), which has \ndesignated Xi\u2019an and Yan\u2019an as national demonstration hubs for sector innovations.12 \n \n10. \nDemonstrating  green  intelligent  transport  and  logistics  management  in  Shaanxi \nProvince. The project will demonstrate how improving operations in the transport and logistics \ncapacities  can  contribute  to  a  reduction  in  GHG  emissions  and  other  air  pollution  in  Shaanxi \nProvince. The project will establish multimodal systems and climate-friendly logistics facilities in \nAnkang, Xi\u2019an, and Yan\u2019an. Multimodal centers will support the shift of freight transport from roads \nto railway, lowering the energy and carbon intensity of the sector. The logistics facilities in Xi\u2019an \nwill  improve  market  connectivity  and  agricultural  value  chain  linkages  between  local  farmers, \nagribusiness, and markets. The project will develop an integrated information technology platform \nthat  will  connect  all  the  facilities  with  the  Shaanxi  Provincial  Transport  Department  (SPTD) \nsystems to facilitate better traffic planning and management. The project\u2019s financial intermediation \nprogram  will  help  SMEs  (at  least  30%  of  which  will  be  managed  by  women)  leverage  private \nsector funding to green and modernize their logistics operations. The project will engage with the \nprivate  sector  and  explore partnerships  to  operate and  maintain  facilities,  where  possible.  The \nproject  will  also  improve  capacity  and  knowledge  sharing,  including  developing  a  strategy  to \nimprove  the  capacity  of  the  SPTD  and  the  logistics  industry  to  take  advantage  of  future \nopportunities. \n \n11. \nAlignment  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030.  The  project  will  focus  on  two  of  the  seven \noperational priorities of Strategy 2030 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB): operational priority 3 \n(tackling  climate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental \nsustainability);  and  operational  priority  4  (making  cities  more  livable).13  This  will  be  achieved  by \ndeveloping  more  efficient,  safe,  green,  and  sustainable  logistics  systems  as  identified  in  ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan for the PRC, 2019\u20132021.14 \n \n12. \nLessons.

The funding arrangement to SMEs will \nfacilitate the provision of greener and more efficient logistics services, and also support gender \ninclusiveness by earmarking at least 30% of the financing for SMEs managed by women. \n \n19. \nOutput  3:  Knowledge  on  green  intelligent  transport  and  logistics  management \nshared  and  replicated.  The  output  will  (i)  expose  the  project  implementing  entities  (PIEs)  to \ninternational best practices outside the PRC and roll out training programs focused on these best \npractices and low-carbon technologies; (ii) roll out knowledge-sharing programs, workshops and \npublications,  and  Shaanxi  logistics  expos;  and  (iii)  train  the  SPTD  to  review  its  priorities,  and \nidentify future challenges and opportunities for logistics management in Shaanxi Province. The \nShaanxi  experience  will  be  disseminated  through  national  and  international  fora  thereby \nfacilitating the replication of best practices of the Project within and outside the PRC. \n \nC. \n \n20. \nADB  and German  development  cooperation  through KfW  supported the government  in \ndesigning the project by providing expert resources to incorporate international best practices.19  \nIn  addition,  ADB\u2019s  intervention  helped  develop  the  SPTD\u2019s  capacity  to  include  green  and  low-\ncarbon  design  components  in  the  project,  including  concepts  that  improve  the  efficiency  of \noperations.20 A joint report with KfW was prepared, which resulted in incorporating additional low-\ncarbon development features in the project design, such as solar-based power, the construction \nof energy management systems for the logistics facilities, and sponge city elements.21 The project \nhas further developed the work done by other development partners, such as the World Bank and \nGerman development cooperation through KfW, to green the sector and lower GHG emissions.22 \nThe  project  was  designed  to  have  a  significant  impact  in  Shaanxi  Province;  this  scale  of \nintervention  was  made  possible  through  cofinancing  from  German  development  cooperation \nthrough KfW. In addition, through the financial intermediation loan component, the project will help \nSMEs  to  access  additional  private  domestic  financing,  including  from  the  identified  entrusted \nbank.  This  will  help  the  SMEs  transform  their  operations  to  adopt  green  and  smart  business \npractices. \n \n \n\nValue Added by ADB \n\n \n\n18 Sponge city techniques in logistics facilities refers to structures that are designed to absorb rainwater and utilize it to \n\n19 ADB.

The  studies  of  the  logistics  parks \nincluded the following attributes: (i) technical design of the facilities to meet the projected demand; \n(ii)  location,  scale,  and  layout;  (iii)  traffic  management;  and  (iv)  the  construction  plan.  Suitable \nengineering  solutions  were  selected  based  on  cost-effectiveness;  climate,  environmental,  and \nsocial impacts; and compliance with domestic standards in the PRC consistent with the adoption \nof international best practices. \n \nB. \n \n27. \nEconomic analysis. The economic viability of the project and its outputs were assessed. \nThe project is economically viable, with an estimated economic internal rate of return of 12.7% and \na  net  present  value  of  CNY1,833.1  million  at  a  9.0%  discount  rate.  All  project  outputs  are \neconomically  viable.  Six  categories  of  economic  benefits  have  been  quantified:  (i)  reductions  in \nGHG emissions; (ii) cost savings in the handling of cargo, particularly through automated loading \nand unloading operations; (iii) savings from the reduction of traffic congestion; (iv) additional storage \nspace; (v) reductions in transport costs; and (vi) reductions in shipping time. Also, the project will \ngenerate benefits from reduced air pollution (other than GHGs) and traffic crashes, but these have \nnot  been  quantified  because  of  the  lack  of  available  data.  Sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the \nproject  remains  economically  viable  under  likely  scenarios.  The  capital  cost  would  have  to \nincrease by 38% or total benefits would have to decrease by 22% for the rate of return to decrease \nto the threshold.24 \n \nFinancial  analysis.  The  analysis  included  (i)  financial  evaluations  of  the  revenue-\n28. \ngenerating  components  to  determine  the  project\u2019s  financial  viability  and  (ii)  an  incremental \nrecurrent  cost  analysis  of  the  SPTD  to  examine  the  project\u2019s  financial  sustainability.25  \nThe  financial  evaluations  reveal  that  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  of  each  revenue-\ngenerating subproject exceeds the weighted average cost of capital, indicating that the project is \nfinancially viable. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the project remains financially viable when it \nis influenced by adverse changes in key quantifiable variables. Due diligence conducted on BOC, \nthe entrusted bank, confirmed that it is financially sound and meets the financial obligations and \n\n24 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nSustainability \n\nADB\u2019s eligibility criteria for the proposed  FIL component. Integrity due diligence  confirmed that \nBOC complies with ADB\u2019s integrity standards. \n \nC. \n \n29. \nThe SPTD will be responsible for funding the costs of operation and maintenance (O&M) \nof the project. The financial sustainability analysis demonstrates that the SPTD will have sufficient \nfinancial resources to cover the incremental recurrent costs for O&M for the project. Further, the \nPIEs are exploring engagement of private sector entities for O&M. Two of the five PIEs\u2014Ankang \nHenkou Demonstration Zone Investment and Development Corporation, and Shaanxi Provincial \nCommunication Investment Group Co. Ltd. will explore forming a strategic alliance with leading \nprivate sector logistics management companies to operate and maintain the facilities. Further, a \ncommercial  bank  will  implement  the  FIL  component.  The  facilities  incorporate  climate-friendly \nsolutions, such as use of renewable energy sources and water conservation adopting sponge city \nmethods. Smart systems used in the projects enable data-based management solutions. Based \non  the  climate  risk  and  adaptation  assessment,  various  adaptation  options  were  proposed  to \naddress  future  climate  risks.  These  include  designing  sufficient  cooling  capacity  and  adopting \nequipment  with  high  energy  efficiency  for  the  extreme  high  temperature  risks  and  increasing \ndesign  standards  for  stormwater  management  systems  for  an  increase  of  6%\u201310%  flooding \nintensity. The subprojects are required to develop appropriate operational procedures to adapt to \nand minimize climate risks. These initiatives, coupled with strong commitments by the SPTD and \nPIEs, make the project interventions sustainable. \n \nD. \n \n30. \nFinancial  management.  The  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Management  Assessment  Technical  Guidance  Note.26  \nAn  assessment  of  the  financial  management  capacity  of  the  executing  agency,  implementing \nagency,  and  PIEs  confirmed  that  all  have  adequate  financial  management  systems  and \nprocedures in place to implement the project efficiently. The financial management risk is rated \nmoderate.  Given  that  the  PIEs  are  less  familiar  with  ADB  loan  proceeds  disbursement \nrequirements and procedures, a financial management specialist has been included in the PMC \nteam,  and  on-the-job  training  in  ADB  disbursements  will  be  provided  to  improve  project \nimplementation efficiency further. \n \n31. \nProcurement and anticorruption. A strategic procurement planning review was carried \nout to identify procurement risks, develop mitigating measures, review procurement options, and \nagree on fit-for-purpose procurement arrangements, considering the procurement capacity of the \nPIEs, executing agency, and implementing agency, as well as the market context. Value for money \nwill  be  achieved  by  using  advance  contracting  as  well  as  counterpart  financing  to  leverage \nimplementation efficiency from procurement-ready packages. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, \nas  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 23). \n \nE. \n \n32. \nThe  project  will  benefit  citizens  in  three  project  cities,  including  7.32  million  women \n(49.02%), 5.33 million rural residents (35.71%), 0.38 million poor people (2.54%), and 0.13 million \nethnic minority people (0.90%).

Likewise, the project will directly create 973 job opportunities during construction and \n904 during the operation period. \n \n33. \nThe project is categorized some gender elements. Gender assessment was conducted, \nand the project identified opportunities to strengthen skills training for women, particularly in green \nand smart  logistics  management.  Interviews  and  survey  with  the  Shaanxi  Women\u2019s  Enterprise \nAssociation and female-owned logistics operators indicate that SMEs led by women continue to \nface  barriers  in  accessing  financial  services  and  knowledge  on  green  logistics.  A  social \ndevelopment  and  gender  action  plan  (SDGAP)  has  been  developed  to  support  the  following:  \n(i)  public\u2013private  partnership  and  green  logistics  skills  training  opportunities  for  at  least  30% \nwomen staff of the SPTD and PIEs, (ii) training on new IT skills is conducted for at least 80% of \nthe female IT professionals in the SPTD, (iii) at least 30% of SMEs financed through the FIL are \nled by women, (iv) at least 50% of the participants in the awareness-raising activities about green \nand intelligent logistics are women, (v) at least 30% of jobs generated by the project are provided \nto  women,  and  (vi)  sex-disaggregated  data  is  collected.27  A  social  and  gender  development \nspecialist  will  be  engaged  for  SDGAP  implementation.  Semiannual  SDGAP  monitoring  and \nreporting will be carried out by an external monitor. \n \nF. \n \n34. \nEnvironment (category B). Initial environmental examinations, including environmental \nmanagement plans (EMPs), were prepared following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) \nand the PRC national regulations for the project. An environment and social management system \nwas developed for the FIL component. The executing and implementing agencies are committed \nto implementing the agreed EMPs and environment and social management system. None of the \nsubprojects will involve environmentally sensitive ecosystems or cultural heritage sites. The FIL \nwill  exclude environment  category  A  subprojects from  ADB financing.  Potential  impacts  during \nconstruction and operation\u2014including soil erosion, noise, dust emissions, construction waste and \nwastewater,  and  occupational  and  community  health  and  safety\u2014are  mostly  temporary, \npredictable, and reversible, and can be mitigated through adherence to national regulations and \nimplementation  of  the  EMPs.  Potential  impacts  during  operation\u2014which  include  wastewater, \nlocomotive and vehicle exhaust, dust generated from loading and unloading, noise and vibration, \ndomestic  and  kitchen  waste,  packaging  and  hazardous  (oily)  waste,  and  occupational  and \ncommunity  health  and  safety\u2014will  be  mitigated  through  the  implementation  of  the  EMPs. \nMeaningful  public  consultations  have  been  conducted.  Grievance  redress  mechanisms  will  be \nestablished. Sufficient budget has been allocated in the EMPs to ensure proper implementation \nof  mitigation  and  monitoring  measures  during  construction  and  operation.  Environmental \nmonitoring reports will be submitted to ADB semiannually during construction and annually during \noperation. Initial environmental examinations will be updated as necessary and disclosed on the \nADB website if unanticipated impacts are identified during project implementation. A climate risk \nand  adaptation  assessment  has  been  conducted  and  the  findings  of  the  assessment  will  be \nincorporated in the project design. \n \n35. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B).  A  total  of  2,035.26  mu  of  land  is  required  for \nimplementing  facilities  identified  in  output  1  (para.  17).28  All  prior  land  acquisition  and  house \ndemolition conducted were not in anticipation of ADB financing. Except for the Civilian Aerospace \n\n27 Social Development and Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 m2). \n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fPark  (where  limited  information  was  obtained  during  due  diligence,  land  acquisition,  and \nresettlement), implementation for the other facilities were assessed based on ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement requirements.29 There are no outstanding or legacy issues on the land allocated \nfor the Railroad Multimodal Commodity Logistics Park and YGUDDA facilities. However, for the \nAnkang  Inland  Port  Logistics  Park  subproject,  there  are  175  households  affected  by  land \nacquisition that have yet to receive their compensation payment by December 2020. In the Hi-\nCity  Park  in  Xi\u2019an  there  are  24  affected  households  that  received  full  payment  but  are  still  in \ntransition  as  construction  of  their  permanent  relocation  houses  is  yet  to  be  completed.30  \nThe  respective  PIEs  have  committed  to  time-bound  corrective  actions  as  specified  in  the  due \ndiligence  reports.  Further,  an  external  monitor  will  be  engaged,  and  semiannual  monitoring \nreports will be submitted to ADB. Under the FIL component, subprojects classified as category A \nor B for involuntary resettlement are excluded from ADB financing. \n \n36. \nIndigenous peoples (category C).
