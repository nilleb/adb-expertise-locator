The project  will  also include (i)  improving \nabout 15 km of secondary roads connecting to the section, (ii) increasing road safety through road \nsafety works and a road safety awareness campaign, (iii) implementing overload control, and (iv) \npursuing  the  performance-based  maintenance  (PBM)  contracting  initiative.  The  project  will \nexpand the efforts of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other development partners in this \ncritical economic corridor, and will enhance inclusive economic growth and regional connectivity. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nStrategic location. Georgia is located at the crossroads of transit routes linking Europe \nand Asia. In accordance with its 2020 socioeconomic development strategy,1 the government is \ncommitted  to  develop  the  country  as  a  regional  transport  and  logistics  hub  for  trade  between \nEurope and Central Asia and even East Asia. Georgia\u2019s main trade partners include Turkey (trade \nturnover of $1.629 billion), the Russian Federation ($1.190 billion), and the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina ($966 million).2 \n \n4. \nRegional connectivity. The government is investing substantially in infrastructure to take \nadvantage of its location and tourism attractions, emphasizing the country\u2019s backbone for transit \ntrade: the East\u2013West and North\u2013South transport corridors. Forming part of the CAREC Program\u2019s \nCorridor 2, the EWH stretches more than 410 km from Sarpi on the Black Sea, at the border with \nTurkey,  through  the  center  of  the  country  to  the  capital  of  Tbilisi,  and  on  to  the  border  with \nAzerbaijan. This link is of particular significance in the region for landlocked countries. The EWH \nrepresents about 2% of Georgia\u2019s road network length and 30% of its international road network; \nit carries more than 60% of the country\u2019s foreign trade and serves a daily average of more than \n13,300 vehicles. Its average annual traffic growth from 2009 to 2018 was 7%, nearly double the \naverage gross domestic product growth during the same period (3.9%). It is being upgraded with \nassistance from ADB, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the European Investment Bank \n(EIB), the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and the World Bank. \n \n5. \nRoad sector policy context. The government\u2019s transport investments have focused on \nroad transport, with rail and ports financed largely by the private sector. The Ministry of Regional \nDevelopment and Infrastructure (MRDI) developed an action plan for 2018\u20132021, which budgeted \nGEL10,231 million for infrastructure development, of which about GEL7,324 million was allocated \nfor road improvement (72%).3 The government has targeted its financing and priority interventions \non the EWH, the North\u2013South Corridor, and critical sections of the secondary road network.4 \n \n\n \n\n1  Government of Georgia. 2014. Socio-Economic Development Strategy of Georgia: Georgia 2020. Tbilisi. \n2  The Observatory of Economic Complexity. Where does Georgia import from? (2017) (accessed 17 May 2019). \n3  Government of Georgia, MRDI. 2018. Regional Development Programme of Georgia, 2018\u20132021. Tbilisi. \n4  Government of Georgia, MRDI, Roads Department. 2018. 2017 Annual Report. Tbilisi. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nSector performance. The 22,000 km road network has about 1,520 km of international \n6. \nroads and 5,370 km of secondary roads managed by the Roads Department under the MRDI, as \nwell as 15,000 km of local roads managed by district administrations. While 8% of international \nroads are in good or fair condition, about 40% of secondary roads and 60% of local roads are in \npoor condition. Traveling through and within Georgia can be time-consuming, uncomfortable, and \nexpensive\u2014disproportionately affecting women\u2019s access to jobs, markets, and public services. \n \n7. \nRoad  maintenance  expenditure,  including  rehabilitation  and  periodic  and  routine \nmaintenance, has increased to an average of $26,700 per km, which compares favorably with \nother  countries  in  the  region.5  The  government  has  made  continued  efforts  to  improve  road \nmaintenance  planning,  budgeting,  and  efficiency  by  developing  a  road  asset  management \nsystem, pilot testing PBM contracts, and assessing tolling options. The road asset management \nsystem is being fed into a 5-year rolling planning and programming process. \n \n8. \nPerformance-based maintenance. The Roads Department contracts all its construction \nand  maintenance  activities  to  the  private  sector  through  open  competitive  bidding.  Most  road \nmaintenance is carried out through traditional input-based contracts. One PBM contract is under \nimplementation  (Kakheti  region)  and  two  PBM  contracts  are  being  prepared  under  ADB  and \nWorld Bank  financing.  The  Roads  Department  intends  to  expand  the  PBM  approach  to  other \nregions and apply it countrywide after conducting an experience analysis that will consider each \nregion\u2019s particularities. A fourth PBM contract will be implemented under the proposed project. \n \n9. \nOverload  monitoring  and  control.  Another  complementary  measure  to  ensure  the \nlongevity  of  the  road  network  is  axle  load  monitoring  and  control.  Overloaded  vehicles  create \nsignificant  road  damage,  accelerating  road  deterioration.  This  is  particularly  relevant  for  PBM \ncontract  management,  as  it  affects  the  amount  of  investment  needed  to  maintain the  required \nperformance level. A program providing portable scales for overload control and a pilot project \nconsisting of the installation of a weigh-in-motion site on the EWH with corresponding adjacent \nweigh bridges, will be implemented under the proposed project.6 \n \n10. \nOther initiatives. The East\u2013West Highway (Khevi\u2013Ubisa Section) Improvement Project \napproved  by  ADB  on  27  September  2018  addresses  this  challenge  by  supporting  a  road \nmaintenance sustainability strategy for all highways in Georgia and providing project management \ntraining.7 The government recently sought assistance from development partners to implement  \ne-tolling (para. 35). \n \nRoad safety. Road safety has been improving overall, and some promising developments \n11. \nhave taken place. The road traffic fatality rate declined from 15.4 deaths per 100,000 people in \n2010  to  12.3  deaths  per  100,000  people  in  2018,8  but  remains  higher  than  the  rate  in \nEuropean   countries  such  as  Sweden  (2.8)  and  the  United  Kingdom  (3.1).  In  2015,  the \ngovernment  enacted  the  revised  Law  on  Road  Traffic,  which  included  road  safety-related \namendments.  It  also  approved  a  National  Road  Safety  Strategy  in  2016  and  subsequently \nestablished  an  interagency  Road  Safety  Commission.9  Road  safety  investment  planning  and \nperformance tracking systems are being developed following the approaches and methodologies \nof  the  International  Road  Assessment  Programme.  Systematic  road  safety  audits  and  public \n\n5  Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6   Weigh-in-motion devices are designed to capture and record axle weights and gross vehicle weights as vehicles \n\n \n\ndrive over a measurement site. \n\n7  ADB.

Tbilisi. \n\n\fawareness campaigns are needed to support  government efforts to reduce road traffic injuries \nand fatalities. \n \n12. \nNeed for the road. At the end of April 2019, more than 45% of the EWH was completed, \nwith  about  190  km  upgraded  and  140  km  under  construction  or  about  to  be  mobilized.  One \nimportant  missing  link  is  the  59  km  segment  from  Chumateleti  to  Argveta,  which  covers \nsubsections F1\u2013F4 (para. 13). The segment passes through mountainous terrain, ravines, and \nnumerous  river  crossings.  The  feasibility  study  prepared  under  World  Bank  financing  in  2015 \nconsidered this part of the corridor a bottleneck in the EWH.10 Improvements are either completed \nor underway on each side of this segment. The existing two-lane road is a winding road where \ncars, buses, and trucks need to reduce their speed. Heavy transit traffic going through small towns \nand villages also poses environmental and safety problems for the local population and tourists \nusing the road. The completed EWH will be an essential national and regional link. Moreover, a \nWorld Bank study demonstrated wide ranging impacts, including that reduced transportation costs \nafter corridor improvements benefit the rural population to a greater extent as it is more reliant on \ntransportation and sensitive to price changes than urban population.11  \n \n13. \nDevelopment support. Major development partners have committed to financing this part \nof the EWH. The project\u2019s feasibility study broke up this segment of the EWH into five subsections: \nF0, F1, F2, F3, and F4. The World Bank and the EIB are financing F0 and F1. Construction on \nF0 is ongoing and the civil works contract for F1 was awarded in July 2019. Additional financing \nfor  tranche  3  of  the  ADB-financed  Road  Corridor  Investment  Program  financed  the  detailed \ndesigns for F2 (Khevi\u2013Ubisa), F3 (Ubisa\u2013Shorapani), and F4 (Shorapani\u2013Argveta).12 Civil works \nfor  F2,  financed  under  the  East\u2013West  Highway  (Khevi\u2013Ubisa  Section)  Improvement  Project \n(footnote 7), are ongoing. Civil works are also ongoing for F3, which is financed by the EIB through \na loan approved on 3 September 2018.13 JICA financing was anticipated for F4 , but this approach \nwas discontinued and the loan was cancelled on 19 April 2019. F4 is the last remaining bottleneck \nof the segment. \n \n14. \nStrategic fit. The project is aligned with the regional cooperation and integration strategic \npriority of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 (para. 4),14 and operational cluster 3 (infrastructure and economic \nconnectivity) of CAREC 2030.15 Improving the project road is a government priority, as reflected \nby the government\u2019s investment in F0\u2013F3 and request for assistance for F4 dated 22 May 2019. \nThe project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2019\u20132023 for Georgia, which \naims to develop economic corridors for private sector development to create more jobs, combat \npoverty, and facilitate interregional trade.16 \n \n15. \nLessons. Since 2009, ADB has financed preparatory studies and five road projects\u2014four \nstand-alone projects and one multitranche financing facility\u2014totaling $1.17 billion. Lessons from \nthese  projects  include  the  need  to  (i)  complete  the  detailed  design  and  initiate  advance \n\n \n\n10  Government of Georgia,  MRDI. 2015.

Not  only  have  these  lessons  been \nincorporated into the project design, which creates synergy with other ADB-assisted interventions, \nbut  projects  for  future  engagement  are  already  benefiting  as  project  preparation  (including \nsafeguard documents and detailed design) under ADB loans is now standard practice in Georgia. \nContinuous support and dialogue with the government and development partners active in the \nsector will help ensure sound project operation and management upon its completion. \n \nB. \n \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impacts:  (i)  economic  growth  and  regional \n16. \nconnectivity  supported  (footnote  1),  and  (ii)  infrastructure  and  economic  connectivity  cluster \nimproved (footnote 15). The project will have the following outcome: efficiency and safety of road \ntransport along the EWH improved.20 \n \n17. \nOutput 1: Shorapani and Argveta section constructed. This output will involve (i) the \nconstruction of 14.7 km of an access-controlled dual two-lane carriageway or a four-lane divided \nhighway to a 100-kilometer-per-hour (km/h) design standard, partly on new alignment; and (ii) the \nimprovement  of  about  15  km  of  secondary  roads  connecting  to  the  EWH.  It  will  include  the \nconstruction of a rest stop with separate toilet facilities for women and men; features that make it \naccessible to the elderly, children, and people with disabilities; and commercial stalls, of which \n50% will be allocated for women. \n \n18. \nOutput 2: Road safety increased. This output will include (i) the execution of road safety \nworks on the EWH; and (ii) the development and implementation of a gender-sensitive road safety \nawareness campaign for roadside villages and schools, with women comprising at least 50% of \nparticipants, and training for female community mobilizers. \n \n19. \nOutput 3: Overload control implemented. This output will comprise (i) the procurement \nof 38 portable scales to be deployed in six priority municipalities, and (ii) a pilot project that will \ninstall at least one weigh-in-motion site on the EWH with corresponding adjacent weigh bridges. \n \n20. \nOutput 4: Performance-based maintenance contract implemented. The PBM contract \nwill  cover  about  150  km  of  international  and  connecting  secondary  roads.  It  has  output-  and \nperformance-based  components  and  consist  of  (i)  initial  rehabilitation  or  repairs;  (ii)  routine \nmaintenance, which will comprise lump-sum monthly payments for every kilometer meeting the \ndefined operation and maintenance service levels; (iii) periodic maintenance (resurfacing); and \n(iv) emergency maintenance works. \n \nC. \n \n ADB  has  become  the  government\u2019s  lead  development  partner  in  the  transport  sector. \n21. \nWith this project, ADB\u2019s support for the sector will reach $1 billion over a 2-year period.

The project road is an access-controlled dual carriageway or a four-lane \ninternational road with a total width of  27.60 meters (m), comprising traffic lanes (4 x 3.75 m), \npaved shoulders (5.00 m), median (5.00 m), and unpaved shoulders (2.60 m). The median width \nvaries depending on the terrain. The design speed is 100 km/h, which is reduced to 80 km/h in \nmountainous  sections.  The  road  design  follows  the  Standard  on  Geometrical  and  Structural \nRequirements for the  Public  Motor  Roads  of  Georgia with reference  to relevant  clauses  of the \nTrans-European  Motorway  standards.  Only  short  sections  will  follow  the  existing  alignment \nbecause of the terrain and the design standard adopted. Frontage roads, four interchanges, and \naccess  roads  to  these  interchanges  will  maintain  local  traffic  along  the  project  highway.  The \nterrain requires the construction of 14 bridges with a total length of 5.0 km and 12 tunnels with a \ntotal  length  of  8.5  km  (for  both  directions  cumulatively),  making  the  project  technically  highly \ncomplex.  \n \nRoad safety. The road design meets internationally accepted standards and practices in \n29. \nterms of road safety; the design review team included an international road safety specialist for \nthis purpose. The tunnels have been designed to reflect the provisions of the European Union \nDirective 2004/54/EC on minimum safety requirements for tunnels in the Trans-European Road \nNetwork. The design will be subjected to detailed road safety audits before construction, during \nconstruction, and before final acceptance of the completed road, in close coordination with the \ntraffic police and relevant government agencies. \n \n30. \nTechnical  due  diligence  confirmed  that  the  technical  design,  alignment,  cross-section, \nbridges,  tunnels,  drainage  structures,  pavements,  and  climate  and  road  safety  provisions  are \nappropriate for a road of this standard in this location and for the projected traffic volume. \n \nB. \n \n31. \nThe economic evaluation of the project was undertaken using the highway development \nand  management  model,  following  relevant  ADB  guidelines.27  For  the  economic  analysis,  the \nwith-project  scenario  assumed  a  new  four-lane  road  will  be  provided,  safety  features  will  be \nimproved, and tunnels and bridges will be constructed to modern standards. Without the project, \nthe  EWH  is  expected  to  require  significant  periodic  maintenance.  Future  traffic  was  estimated \nbased on classified traffic counts conducted in 2017 and available gross domestic product growth \nforecasts (footnote 5). \n  \n32. \nThe  project  is  economically  viable,  with  an  estimated  economic  internal  rate  of  return \n(EIRR)  of 11.3%  and  a net  present  value  of  $65.1  million  at  a  9%  discount  rate.  The  principal \nquantifiable benefits are reduced vehicle operating costs and reduced travel time. Sensitivity tests \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\n \n27  ADB. 2017.

The project\u2019s EIRR is 9.6% if crash cost savings are excluded \nand values of time are not increased in real terms. However, the EIRR does not capture larger \nregional beneficial impacts, particularly for neighboring landlocked countries. \n \n33. \ngovernment\u2019s maintenance program. \n \nC. \n \n34. \nAssessments  of  the  MRDI\u2019s  road  asset  management  practices  and  capabilities  during \nprevious project preparation activities showed that steady increases in road sector funding since \n2004 led to major backlog recovery. Annual expenditure for road maintenance and rehabilitation \nnearly doubled from GEL218 million in 2014 to GEL407 million in 2018. During 2014\u20132018, the \ncompound  annual  growth rate of road maintenance  and rehabilitation expenditure  was  13.3%, \nwhile the average annual inflation rate was 3.6%. Over the same period, the compound annual \ngrowth  rate  of  road-related  revenues  was  15.1%,  which  was  1.2%\u20132.1%  of  gross  domestic \nproduct.  The  annual  average  incremental  maintenance  costs  associated  with  the  project  are \nestimated to be in line with current expenditure ($26,700 per km) and equivalent to about 0.2% of \nthe overall road maintenance and rehabilitation expenditure in 2018. \n \n35. \nRecognizing  the  need  to  expand  its  revenue  base  to  cater  for  future  needs,  the \ngovernment  has  sought  assistance  from  development  partners  to  assess  the  potential  and \nsuitability of road tolling. Two studies supported by the World Bank and the European Bank for \nReconstruction  and  Development  have  recommended  tolling  as  a  viable  revenue  source.  The \ngovernment  is  recruiting  consultants  to  conduct  further  feasibility  studies  on  priority  highway \nsections. The financial analysis concluded that the MRDI has sufficient financial capacity, within \ngovernment budgetary procedures, to meet recurrent expenditures to operate and maintain the \nproject road adequately. \n \nD. \n \nFinancial management. The financial management assessment (FMA) followed relevant \n36. \nADB guidelines. Although the Roads Department is the implementing agency for the project, the \nETCIC will assist with project financial management activities and have full primary responsibility \nfor  disbursements  and  their  related  accounting  and  control.  As  such,  the  FMA  primarily \nconsidered the ETCIC\u2019s financial management capacity with regard to funds flow arrangements, \nstaffing, accounting and financial reporting systems, financial information systems, and internal \nand external auditing arrangements. The  assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk\u2014\nboth  inherent  risk  and  control  risk\u2014is  moderate  mainly  because  of  (i)  the  growing  portfolio  of \nexternally funded projects that may lead to insufficient staffing within the ETCIC; and (ii) lack of \nvariance analysis between budgeted and actual expenditure that may lead to inadequate financial \nreporting.  The  FMA  concluded  that  subject  to  addressing  the  above  points,  the  ETCIC  has \nsufficient and appropriate financial management capacity to support project implementation. The \nMRDI,  the  Roads  Department,  and  the  ETCIC  will  maintain  adequate  and  separate  project \nrecords and accounts, which an independent auditor will audit annually. \n \nProcurement. The project procurement risk assessment, undertaken following relevant \n37. \nADB  guidelines,  considered  the  Roads  Department\u2019s  capacity  with  regard  to  organization  and \nstaffing,  information  management,  procurement  practices,  complaints  and  dispute  resolution \nmechanisms, and accountability measures. The assessed procurement risk is moderate because \n\nGovernance \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nof (i) the growing portfolio of externally funded projects that may lead to insufficient staffing within \nthe Roads Department, and (ii) record management systems and procedures that need further \nimprovement. The project procurement risk assessment concluded that, subject to addressing the \nabove  points,  the  Roads  Department  has  sufficient  and  appropriate  procurement  capacity  to \nimplement  the  project.  The  project  procurement  arrangements  chosen  for  the  civil  works \ncomponent are based on experience gained through the contracts awarded for the other EWH \nsections (F0, F1, F2, and F3) and the market insight  they provided. The best value for money \nwould be  achieved  by  designing  one works  package to be  procured through  open  competitive \nbidding  using  the  one-stage,  one-envelope  system\u2014to  be  awarded  to  the  lowest  evaluated \nsubstantially responsive bidder.  \n \n38. \nInstitutional  capacity.  The  MRDI  and  the  Roads  Department  adequately  understand \nADB\u2019s procurement and financial management policy and procedures as a result of the sizable \nportfolio of ADB-assisted transport operations. Weaknesses on land acquisition and resettlement \nare being addressed through regional technical assistance, which includes on-the-job training of \nthe  Roads  Department  staff  and  implementation  of  grievance  management  tools.29  An \nexperienced consultant has been assigned to work with the Roads Department on a continuous \nbasis to help improve compliance with ADB\u2019s social safeguards requirements. \n \n39. \nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the government, the MRDI, and the Roads Department. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 23). \n \nE. \n \n40. \nThe project will support poverty reduction by facilitating increased and safe movement of \npeople and goods, as well as access to economic opportunities and social services. The project \nwill benefit the residents of the villages by providing (i) skills building programs that will enhance \nthe marketability of products developed in the area, and (ii) spaces to sell these and produce from \ntheir farms. The project is categorized general intervention with no specific direct intervention on \npoverty reduction. It will ensure compliance with core labor standards, with a preference for local \nlabor, and will prohibit child labor among contractors. The project will take measures to cushion \nthe negative impacts of land acquisition in the affected communities. \n \n41. \nThe  project  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  It  will  include  gender-  and \nsocially inclusive features that will facilitate the safe access and mobility of travelers and residents \nfrom  nearby  villages.  These  include  (i)  an  all-weather  rest  stop  at  the  interchange  nearest \nZestafoni that will have (a) separate toilets for men and women; and (b) commercial spaces for \nselling agricultural produce and agricultural products (e.g., cheese), 50% of which will be reserved \nfor female entrepreneurs; (ii) skills training on product development, packaging, and marketing \nfor  processed  agricultural  products,  with  women  comprising  50%  of  participants;  (iii)  capacity \nbuilding  for  women  as  community  mobilizers  for  road  safety  awareness;  and  (iv)  road  safety \nawareness-raising programs for communities, with women making up at least 50% of participants. \n \nThe Roads Department will engage a gender specialist to ensure the quality and timely \n42. \nimplementation  of  the  gender  action  plan.31  Aside  from  supporting  the  implementation  of  the \ngender action plans of road projects, the Roads Department is taking steps to promote gender \nequity in its organization. It established in 2019 a gender focal point. The Roads Department will \n\n29 ADB. 2018. Technical Assistance for Supporting Social Safeguards in the Central and West Asia Region.

The draft environmental impact assessment was disclosed \n44. \non 28 May 2019.33 This draft was submitted by the Roads Department and reviewed by ADB and \nall key elements required for disclosure were present, including the use of International Finance \nCorporation standards for noise modeling in line with the Safeguard Policy Statement. The project \nwill  have  significant  adverse  impacts  that  are  irreversible  and  diverse.  The  alignment  will  be \npartially  new  and  will  require  significant  tunneling  and  bridge-building  activities  with  significant \ncommunity impacts from resettlement and land conversion. Works will require the construction of \n10 bridges in the Borimela, Dzirula, and Kvirila rivers, resulting in the loss of riparian habitat.34 \nTunneling  and  cutting  will  require  the  disposal  of  700,000  cubic  meters  of  spoil  during \nconstruction.35  Impacts  on  noise,  vibration,  air  quality,  and  surface  water  will  occur  during \nconstruction.  The  short-term  nature  of  impacts  means  they  will  generally  not  be  significant  if \nmitigation  is  implemented  correctly,  although  cumulative  impacts  from  traffic  because  of  the \nsimultaneous  construction  of  the  F1\u2013F4  subsections  will  need  to  be  well  managed.  During \noperations, the road will significantly improve local road safety by removing through traffic from \nlocal roads. However, the road will result in the permanent loss of 28 hectares of natural habitat, \nwhich will require reinstatement and off-site habitat compensation to meet ADB\u2019s safeguard policy \nrequirements.  In  addition,  noise  impacts  from  the  new  alignment  will  be  significant,  requiring \ntargeted mitigation and potential resettlement for 24 properties to ensure the project remains in \ncompliance  during  operation.  The  Roads  Department  has  the  expertise  to  manage  the \ncontractors\u2019 environmental performance adequately. \n \n45. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  A).  According  to  the  preliminary  inventory, \ninvoluntary  resettlement  affects  455 households  (2,047  persons)  of  which  426  are  severely \naffected  households,  including  21  that  are  physically  displaced.  A  LARP  prepared  for  JICA  is \nunder implementation and more than 85% completed. Due diligence is being performed on the \nLARP. A corrective action plan prepared to cover gaps between JICA and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement consists primarily of (i) an upward revision of severely affected households under the \nLARP,  with  a  consequent  upward revision  in the  budget  for  allowances;  and (ii) minor  upward \nrevisions in the allowances to reflect recent revisions to road sector LARPs in Georgia.36  \n \n46. \narea, as defined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n47. \nThe construction supervision consultant\u2019s resettlement and environmental specialists will \nassist the Roads Department to ensure compliance with the project\u2019s safeguard requirements and \nprepare semiannual safeguards monitoring reports for ADB\u2019s review and disclosure. The Roads \nDepartment will also engage qualified and experienced external monitors to verify environmental \nand resettlement impacts. \n\nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).
