Key  infrastructure  investments  include  (i) \ndrainage;  (ii)  water  supply;  (iii)  sanitation;  (iv)  cyclone  shelters;  and  (v)  other  municipal \ninfrastructure  including  emergency  access  roads  and  bridges,  solid  waste  management,  bus \nterminals,  slum  improvements,  boat  landings,  and  markets.3 Investments  will  benefit  the  poor \nand  women.  The  Ministry  of  Local  Government,  Rural  Development  and  Cooperatives \n(MLGRDC),  acting  through  its  Local  Government  Engineering  Department  (LGED)  and  the \nDepartment of Public Health Engineering (DPHE), will be the executing agencies of the project.4 \nProject management and administration support will be provided under the project.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nThe  project  is  prioritized  in  the  government\u2019s  Strategic  Program  for  Climate  Resilience \n3. \n(2010) under the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience, and will demonstrate new approaches for \nin  coastal  pourashavas. 5  The \nintegrating  climate  resilience \ngovernment\u2019s  Sixth  Five-Year  Plan,  2011\u20132015  targets  assistance  to  vulnerable  coastal \npopulations  requiring  investments  in  climate-resilient  infrastructure  and  urban  planning. 6 The \nproject is consistent with the Bangladesh country partnership strategy, which targets assistance \nto vulnerable coastal areas in adapting to the risks of climate change,7 and is consistent with the \nADB Urban Operational Plan to promote climate-change-resilient cities.8   \n\ninto  urban  development \n\n4. \nClimate  change  is  a  critical  development  issue for  Bangladesh. The  country\u2019s  low-lying \ncoastal zone (consisting of 19 districts with an estimated population of 38.1 million, of which 8.6 \nmillion  is  urban)  is  highly  vulnerable  to  cyclones,  storm  surges,  sea  level  rise,  and  salinity \nintrusion.  A  1.5\u00b0C  increase  in  temperature  and  4%  increase  in  precipitation  (the  median \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2   Batch  1  towns:  Amtali,  Galachipa,  Mathbaria,  and  Pirojpur.  Batch  2  towns:  Barguna,  Bhola,  Daulat  Khan,  and \nKalapara. Towns were selected based on their vulnerability, population size, density, and level of past investment.  \n\n3  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance.  \n4   DPHE will act on behalf of MLGRDC as co-executing agency for the water supply and sanitation components.  \n5  Government of Bangladesh.

The  central  and  southwestern  regions  of  the  country  are \nparticularly  vulnerable.  Cyclone  Sidr  in  2007  (a  Category  5  storm  with  wind  speed  of  260 \nkilometers  per  hour)  resulted  in  economic  losses  of  $1.7  billion  (2.6%  of  gross  domestic \nproduct). The poor and women are disproportionately affected and have the lowest capacity to \ncope  with  losses.  There  is  a  high  demand  for  climate-resilient  infrastructure  and  disaster \npreparedness to improve the wellbeing of residents and reduce migration to larger cities.   \n \n5. \nCoastal  towns  suffer  from  large  infrastructure  deficits  and  natural  resource  constraints \nthat exacerbate sensitivity to climate change. A shortage of drains and severe siltation and solid \nwaste build up result in severe flooding and extended water logging (lasting up to 7 days during \nmonsoon  rains).  Water  supply  suffers  from  (i)  low  access  to  piped  water,  (ii)  salinity \ncontamination  of  shallow  and  middle  aquifers,  and  (iii)  unsustainable  groundwater  extraction. \nFeasibility  study  surveys  found  that  residents  without  piped  water  supplies  who  rely  on \ncommunity pond sand filter systems pay as much as 2\u20134 times more for water of inferior quality \ncompared  to  similar  towns  with  piped  supplies.  There  is  a  high  willingness  to  pay  (up  to \n50%more) for improved services. While there is generally high coverage of household sanitation \n(up to 94% of households have toilets), there is no septage management or treatment systems, \nresulting  in  polluted  waterways  and  a  high  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases,  with  large \noutbreaks occurring after disasters.10 Emergency access roads are in poor condition, and most \ncyclone shelters are structurally unsafe as a result of extensive exposure to cyclones and poor \nmaintenance.  There  is  an  acute  need  for  new,  higher-capacity  multi-use  cyclone  shelters \nlocated in core urban areas accessible to poorer populations. It is critical that new investments \nare  designed  that  consider  climate  change  to manage  the  long-term  costs  of natural  disasters \nand ensure investments deliver intended benefits. \n \n6. \nThe  high  vulnerability  of  coastal  towns  is  also  linked  to  poor  governance  and  low \nadaptive  capacity. 11 Urban  planning  is  in  its  infancy  and  development  controls  are  only  now \nemerging. Many pourashavas lack established mechanisms for public participation, particularly \nin the allocation of municipal budgets. Low tax collection efficiency (on average 57% in coastal \ntowns)  reflects  outdated  financial  management  practices,  including  limited  computerization  of \naccounts  and  billing  systems,  and  irregular  tax  assessments.  There  is  an  urgent  need  to \nstrengthen institutional capacity, public awareness, and knowledge management to complement \nphysical investments as part of an integrated approach for building climate change resilience.  \n \n7. \nincentivize  governance \nimprovement and build resilience by linking each stage of investment to demonstrated reforms, \nas  proven  highly  effective  in  previous  ADB  urban  projects  in  Bangladesh.  The  eight  project \ntowns are divided into two batches of four, with each town entitled to two stages of investment \n(stages  1  and  2). 12  Towns  will  receive  funding  under  each  stage  if  they  fulfill  agreed \n\nPerformance-based  approach.  The  project  aims \n\nto \n\n                                                \n9   World Bank. 2010. Economics of Adaptation to Climate Change: Bangladesh.

A \nperformance evaluation committee will evaluate each pourashava. \n \n8. \nLessons.  The  project  reflects  the  successful  experience  in  governance-led  investment \nthrough  performance-based  allocation  from  the  first  and  second  Urban  Governance  and \nInfrastructure Improvement (Sector) Projects.14 The project also reflects findings of downscaled \nclimate  modeling  from  the  technical  assistance  on  Strengthening  the  Resilience  of  the  Urban \nWater Supply, Drainage, and Sanitation to Climate Change in Coastal Towns.15  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n9. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  improved  wellbeing  in  coastal  towns.  The  outcome  of \nthe project will be increased climate and disaster resilience in coastal towns benefiting the poor \nand women. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe project will have the following outputs.  \n\n10. \n \n\n1. \n\nOutput 1: Improved climate-resilient municipal infrastructure  \n\n11. \nStage 1: Climate and disaster risk-reducing infrastructure. Priority infrastructure will \nfill  critical  deficits  to  strengthen  climate  and  disaster  resilience  and  include  the  design, \nrehabilitation,  and  construction  of  (i)  drainage  systems;  (ii)  cyclone  shelters;  (iii)  water  supply \nsystems;  (iv)  sanitation  systems;  (v)  emergency  access  roads,  bridges,  and  culverts;  and  (vi) \nsolid  waste  management  systems. 16 Infrastructure  will  be  designed  considering  climate \nprojections for the year 2040. The project will develop climate-resilient community infrastructure \nin poor, vulnerable areas as part of larger infrastructure contracts.17 Climate-resilient measures \nwill include, but are not limited to, increasing drainage capacity; raising infrastructure levels for \nroads, cyclone shelters, water and sanitation facilities; and identifying non-saline water sources. \nGroundwater  sources  will  be  prioritized  as  a  least-cost  option  where  salinity  levels  are  within \ngovernment standards. A design consulting firm will screen all subprojects for climate resilience, \nand prepare all engineering designs, bidding, and safeguard documents.  \n \nStage  2:  Local  economic  infrastructure. This component will support local economic \n12. \ndevelopment activities and will include the design, rehabilitation, and construction of (i) markets, \n(ii) bus terminals, (iii) boat landings, and (iv) commercially important roads. These investments \nwill also consider climate resilience in the planning and design stage.   \n \n \n                                                \n13  Performance  criteria  are  in  Appendix  5  of  the  Project  Administration  Manual,  which  is  accessible  from  the  list  of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2. Towns not fulfilling criteria within the stipulated timeframe are dropped, and funds \nwill be reallocated.  \n\n14 ADB.  2008.

Municipal  governance  and  service  delivery  improvements.  Capacity  building \nactivities under this subcomponent will focus on (i) strengthening municipal finance systems to \nimprove local revenues, (ii) enhancing citizen participation in pourashava planning and decision \nmaking  process, 18  (iii)  strengthening  technical  capacity  and  institutional  arrangements  for \nimproved  service  delivery  and  O&M  at  the  pourashava  level,  and  (iv)  promoting  private  sector \nparticipation in fecal sludge management.  \n \n14. \nNon-structural  measures  to  reduce  climate  and  disaster  risk.  Capacity  building \nsupport  will  strengthen  the  ability  of  pourashavas  to  prepare  and  respond  to  climate-related \nrisks and disasters by (i) reviewing and updating the urban master plans, local building codes, \nand  engineering  design  standards  of  LGED  and  DPHE  to  incorporate  climate  change  and \ndisaster  resilient  measures;  (ii)  improving  water  safety  planning  and  groundwater  monitoring \nthrough  the  development  of  water  safety  plans  and  guidelines;  and  (iii)  establishing  disaster \nmanagement  standing  committees  in  each  pourashava,  and  delivering  appropriate  technical \ntraining for the members of such committees.  \n \n15. \nPublic  awareness,  behavior  change,  and  community  mobilization.  Knowledge- \nbased awareness-raising activities will focus on (i) education and communication campaigns to \nraise  public  awareness  of  climate  change  and  disaster-related  risks  and  preparedness;  waste \nreduction,  reuse  and  recycling;  and  the  links  between  water,  sanitation  and  hygiene;  (ii) \nlivelihood  training  programs  for  poor  households  targeting  women;  and  (iii)  community \nmobilization  to  enable  poor  communities  to  access  and  use  climate-resilient  infrastructure \n(under output 1). The institutional capacity-building consultants will support these activities.  \n \n\n3. \n\nOutput 3: Project management and administration supported \n\nA  project  management  and  supervision  consultant  firm  will  be  recruited  to  support    (i) \n16. \noverall  project  management,  performance  monitoring,  and  reporting;  (ii)  contract  management \nincluding capacity development in e-procurement processes and procedures; (iii) quality control \nof  engineering  designs  and  construction  supervision;  and  (iv)  compliance  with  ADB  safeguard \npolicies.  A  project  internal  audit  consultant  will  be  recruited  to  conduct  independent  and \nobjective third-party internal auditing and post-procurement review services.  \n \nD. \n \n17. \nThe estimated project cost is $117.10 million (Table 1). Infrastructure costs are allocated \nas follows: (i) batch 1, stage 1: $31.31 million; (ii) batch 1, stage 2: $6.50 million; and (iii) batch \n2: $32.81 million.19 The project administration manual (PAM) has detailed cost estimates.20 \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\n                                                \n18 Town- and ward-level committees will be formed under the project to improve citizen participation. \n19 Stage 2 funds are allocated based on population size.

The economic analysis was conducted for subprojects for stage 1 \nin the four Batch 1 pourashavas only.28 Representative subprojects were analyzed to estimate \nthe viability of three scenarios: (i) the present situation without the project, (ii) investment without \nfuture climate resilience measures, and (iii) investment with future climate resilience measures. \nThe  overall  economic  internal  rate  of  return  for  Batch  1  pourashavas  (stage  1)  is  23.0%,  with \nfuture  climate  resilience  measures.  The  subproject  economic  internal  rates  of  return  were \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n                                                \n26 Technical subproject selection criteria are in the PAM (footnote 20). \n27 A summary of all climate resilience measures is in the Climate Change: Project Adaptation Report (accessible from \n\nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n28 Batch 1, stage 2 and batch 2, stage 1 and 2 subprojects will be evaluated by the project management supervision \n\nconsultant economist once the project scope is defined. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n14.0%\u201317.7%  for  water  supply;  14.2%\u201330.0%  for  sanitation;  18.1%\u201342.9%  for  drainage; 29 \n20.3%\u201324.7%  for  roads;  21.1%\u201322.2%  for  bridges;  and  16.5%\u201335%  for  cyclone  shelters. \nSensitivity  analysis  confirms  that  all  the  subprojects  are  robust.  The  results  are  most  likely \nunderestimated because some project benefits are not easily quantifiable and cumulative, and \nthus  not  included  in  this  analysis  (e.g.,  the  impact  of  death  and  trauma  from  disaster  events). \nThe feasibility survey indicates that willingness to pay is sufficient to meet O&M costs and debt \nservice, while the affordability analysis indicates the proposed water supply tariff increases are \neconomically and socially viable. \n \n24. \nFinancial  analysis.  The  financial  analysis  focused  on  the  capacity  of  batch  1 \npourashavas to pay O&M costs and service debt. The overall financial position of each sample \npourashava  is  projected  reflecting  incremental  revenue  and  expenditures.  The  tariffs  of \nrevenue-generating  components  (i.e.,  water  supply  and  sanitation)  are  not  set  for  full  cost \nrecovery;  however,  by  improving  operational  efficiency,  adopting  a  tariff  plan  with  increases \nevery 4 years, and increasing property tax collection efficiency, the pourashavas are expected \nto generate sufficient revenue to meet O&M costs and service debt to sustain infrastructure and \nservice delivery for all subprojects supported under the project. The financial projections show \nthat  the  water  supply  components  will  require  a  time-bound  cross-subsidy  in  two  out  of  three \nbatch 1 pourashavas receiving water supply investments; the respective pourashavas have the \ncapacity  to  cover  these  through  general  revenues.  Loan  covenants  include  requirements  for \nintroduction of volumetric water tariffs to ensure financial viability, and a minimum cost-recovery \nratio. Performance criteria include a target for improving property tax collection efficiency rates \nto a minimum of 80%. \n \nC. \n \n25. \nBangladesh  has  implemented  key  governance  and  anticorruption  reforms,  including \nestablishing  an  independent  Anti-Corruption  Commission  in  2004,  and  enacting  the  Right  to \nInformation  Act  in  2009,  the Whistleblower  Protection  Act  in  2011,  and the  Money  Laundering \nPrevention  Act  in  2012.  A  comprehensive  national  integrity  strategy  was  adopted  in  2012  to \naddress corruption holistically and strengthen governance institutions in a phased manner. The \nfinancial management assessment of LGED, DPHE, and sample batch 1 pourashavas indicated \nthat\u2014with  the  support  of  a  dedicated  financial  management  consultant  in  the  project \nmanagement unit (PMU), an accounts officer in the PMU, and a dedicated project accountant in \neach  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)\u2014there  will  be  adequate  financial  management \ncapabilities and support for project implementation. 30  The capacity of LGED\u2019s and pourashava \nfinance and  accounting staff  will  be  further  strengthened  through  training  programs  conducted \nunder the project. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed  with  the  government  and  the  LGED,  DPHE,  and  pourashavas.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 20).  \n \n26.  While  LGED  has  proven  experience  in  ADB  procurement,  local  officials  have  limited \nexperience  implementing  large  infrastructure  projects.  Procurement  capacity  assessments  of \nsample  pourashavas  indicated  that  a  procurement  specialist  in  the  PMU  will  provide \npourashavas  with  adequate  procurement  support  to  implement the  project.  E-procurement  will \nbe  implemented  for  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB)  packages.  Other  measures  to  ensure \ntransparency include the presentation of detailed information on procurement at public meetings \nto supplement web-based disclosure. Capacity of PIU staff will be further strengthened through \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n29 The economic analysis for drainage includes the solid waste component. \n30 The financial management specialist will provide capacity support to both PMU and all PIUs. \n\n \n\n\ftraining  programs  conducted  under  the  project,  including  e-procurement,  auditing,  quality \ncontrol, community participation, monitoring, reporting, and evaluation. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n27. \nPoverty  rates  in  coastal  pourashavas  are  50%,  which  exceeds  the  national  average  of \n31.5%.  The  poor  are  disproportionately  affected  by  climate  hazards  because  they  live  in \ntemporary  structures  in  high  risk  areas  (e.g.,  outside  protective  embankments),  and  have  less \ncapacity  to  cope  with  disaster.  They  depend  directly  on  climate-sensitive  sectors  of  the \neconomy such as agriculture and fisheries. They have poor access to basic services, and suffer \nfrom high rates of waterborne diseases due to salinity and biological contamination, especially \nafter  disasters.  The  project  will  mobilize  community-based  organizations  to  improve  access  to \nsafe drinking water and sanitation in poor communities. New cyclone shelters will be located in \npoor and vulnerable areas. The poor will benefit from targeted livelihood training programs and \nemployment  opportunities  associated  with  construction  activities.  Town-  and  ward-level \ncommittees formed under the project will involve the poor.  \n \n28. \nGender. The project is classified as a gender equity theme. The project will significantly \nbenefit  women\u2019s  safety  during  disasters  by  improving  access  and  quality  of  cyclone  shelters \nwith separately designed spaces for women. Women will be encouraged to play a major role in \ncommunity-based  organizations  and  town-  and  ward-level  committees  formed  in  each \npourashava.  Special  attention  will  be  given  to  empowering  women  by  building  their  technical \ncapacity and skills through targeted livelihood training, and participation in water- and sanitation-\nrelated programs, where women will take leadership positions in water safety planning activities. \nCore  labor  standards,  including  equal  wages  for  work  of  equal  value,  will  be  practiced. \nResources are allocated for implementation and monitoring of the project\u2019s gender action plan.31 \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n29. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environmental  safeguards,  category  B  for \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  and  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples.  Draft  initial  environmental \nexaminations  were  prepared  and  disclosed  for  sample  subprojects  in  batch  1  towns  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS, 2009) and government laws. Project \nlocations  are  located  outside  sensitive  and  protected  areas,  and  any  construction  impacts  will \nbe mitigated through implementation of environmental management plans that will form part of \ncontract documents. Draft resettlement plans were prepared and disclosed in accordance with \nthe  ADB\u2019s  SPS for  sample  subprojects  in  batch  1  towns.  Impacts  to  153  affected  persons  will \noccur  as  a  result  of  4.45  hectares  of  private  land  acquisition,  and  physical  relocation  of  six \nresidential  and  business  structures  for  drainage  works.  The  project  will  not  affect  indigenous \npeoples.  Significant  safeguard  impacts  will  be  avoided  in  future  subprojects,  which  will  be \nguided  by  the  relevant  safeguard  frameworks,  and  monitored  as  part  of  the  semi-annual \nsafeguard monitoring reports. Consultants will support carrying out safeguards-related tasks.  \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n30.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4. 32  The  integrated \nbenefits of the project are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\n                                                \n31 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n32 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nRisks \nBWDB \nflood  control  systems  not \nimproved  reducing  effectiveness  of \ndrainage investments under project \nWeak financial and technical capacity \nof pourashavas to meet the increased \ndemand for O&M. \nGovernance  risks  related  to  financial \nmanagement and procurement.  \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \nLoan  covenant  requires  repair  of  BWDB  flood  control  systems  prior  to \ncontract award.
