(BOC),  a  state-owned \ncommercial bank (SOCB) in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), as a key step in the financial \nreform of the PRC banking sector.    \n \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n\nA. \n\nIndustry Background and Sector Reform \n\n1. \n\nOverview of PRC Financial System and State-Owned Commercial Banks \n\n \n2. \nBanks clearly dominate the PRC\u2019s financial system and at present account for 54% of the \ntotal assets of all financial institutions in the PRC.1 In 2005, the PRC\u2019s banking system comprises \nfour nationwide SOCBs, 12 nationwide joint-stock commercial banks, 112 city commercial banks, \n8  rural  commercial  banks,  about  2,000  urban  credit  cooperatives,  and about  28,000  rural  credit \ncooperatives.2 Assets of these financial institutions have grown at a compounded annual growth \nrate (CAGR) of 13% since 2000 and stood at $3.8 trillion at the end of 2004, about the same as \nthe assets of the United Kingdom\u2019s financial sector (Figure 1).  \n \n \n\nFigure 1: PRC Banking Industry Assets 2000\u20132004 \n\n3.8\n\n3.4\n\n2.4 \n\n2.7\n\n2.8\n\n$ trillion \n\n1.4 \n\n1.5\n\n1.7\n\n1.8\n\n2.0 \n\n2000 \n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004 \n\nState-owned banks Others\n\nJoint-stock banks City commercial bank \n\n \n\nSource: KPMG analysis. \n\n \n\n \n3. \nThe ratio of bank assets to stock market capitalization plus bonds outstanding in the PRC \nexceeds 300%, a far higher ratio than in most industrial countries and even in many developing \ncountries. For example, India, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, and the United States all have ratios \nless than 100%. \n                                            \n \n1   China Banking Regulatory Commission. 2004. Presentation at ADB\u2019s 37th Annual Meeting, Republic of Korea, May \n\n2004.  \n\n2   Source: KPMG research.  \n\n4.00 \n\n3.50 \n\n3.00 \n\n2.50 \n\n2.00 \n\n1.50 \n\n1.00 \n\n0.50 \n\n0.00 \n\n1 \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \nThe banking industry is controlled by the four SOCBs: the Industrial and Commercial Bank \n4. \nof  China  (ICBC),  BOC,  the  China  Construction  Bank  (CCB)  and  the  Agricultural  Bank  of  China \n(ABC).  Their  combined  assets  as  of  year-end  2004  were  CNY16.9  trillion.  This  represented \n53.6%  of  total  financial  system  resources,  69.5%  of  total  domestic  bank  assets,  and  130%  of \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP).  The  four  SOCBs  also  accounted  for  about  90%  of  all  loans  to \nstate-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  and  70%  of  all  loans  to  state-controlled  infrastructure  projects. \nThe  SOCBs  play  a  major  role  in  the  allocation  of  funds  throughout  the  economy  as  well  as \nserving as an important gauge of the overall health of the financial system.  \n \nB. \n \n5. \nThe PRC banking sector was originally regulated by the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC). \nSince 1998, responsibilities have been divided between PBOC and the China Banking Regulatory \nCommission  (CBRC).  PBOC,  guided  by  the  State  Council,  is  responsible  for  formulating  and \nimplementing monetary policy and for enacting safeguards to ensure financial stability. CBRC is \nthe main regulator of the banking sector and its responsibilities include formulating and enforcing \nthe supervisory rules and regulations governing bank institutions. \n\nFinancial Sector Reforms  \n\n \n6. \nThe  PRC  regulators  place  numerous  restrictions  on  permissible  products,  services,  and \nactivities  of  domestic  and  foreign  banks.  For  example,  there  are  still  restrictions  on  commercial \nbanks  offering  fee-based  products.  Interest  rates  on  loans  and  deposits  offered  by  commercial \nbanks are still subject to PBOC regulations even after recent reform measures that gave banks \nmore  latitude  in  setting such  interest  rates.  On  the  other  hand,  the  PRC  Government  has  been \ngradually reforming the banking sector by allowing new product offerings and expanding the limits \nwithin  which  commercial  banks  may  set  their  CNY  lending  rates.  In  particular,  on  29 October \n2004,  the  PBOC  removed  the  upper  limit  for  CNY  lending  rates  (other  than  rates  on  mortgage \nloans  to  individuals)  charged  by  financial  institutions,  excluding  credit  cooperatives,  while \nretaining the lower limit for such rates. Since that date, all deposit-taking institutions have been \npermitted  to  decrease  (but  not  increase)  CNY  deposit  rates  to  below  the  corresponding  PBOC \nbenchmark rates. These changes give banks more freedom to develop products to meet market \nneeds and to offer more flexibility in determining pricing of their products. \n \nDespite  focused  monetary  and  financial  sector  reforms,3  the  PRC  financial  sector  does \n7. \nnot  yet  meet  the  needs  of  a  market  economy.  Indirect  monetary  policy  instruments  (e.g.,  open \nmarket  operations)  are  not  fully  developed  and  interest  rate  policy  remains  inflexible. 4  The \nregulatory and supervisory framework for banks and nonbank financial institutions remains weak. \nDespite  substantial  progress,  the  capital  markets  are  still  underdeveloped  and  have  not  been \nadequately regulated and supervised. 5  \n \nA developed financial system mobilizes investments, manages risks, and reduces the cost \n8. \nof  doing  business.  An  inefficient  financial  system  restricts  economic  growth  by  failing  to  fund \n\n                                            \n \n3  Among  others,  adoption  of  the  Central  Bank  and  Commercial  Bank  Laws  in  1995,  Securities  Law  in  1999, \nestablishment  of  China  Securities  Regulatory  Commission  and  China  Insurance  Regulatory  Commission  as \nindependent regulators, setting up four asset management companies to help address NPL problems, allowing more \nforeign  participation  in  the  financial  sector  and  separating  CBRC  from  PBOC  in  2003,  finalizing  the  transfer  of \nPBOC\u2019s formerly all-encompassing regulatory powers over the financial services industry.  \n\n4  In April 2004 it was announced that the hitherto regulated commercial interest rate would be liberalized and that the \n\ninterest rate ceiling for commercial lending would be removed (while certain floor rates would remain). \n\n5  PRC did not have a capital market until early 1990s. \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nworthwhile  projects  and  businesses,  and  by  misdirecting  funds  to  less  productive  investors  and \nborrowers.  High  transaction  costs  result  in  low  economic  benefits.  The  PRC\u2019s  banking  system \nhas not yet developed into playing an efficient role in intermediation.  \n \n9. \nTo  address  these  problems,  the  PRC  is  undertaking  a  historic  transformation  of  its \nbanking and financial sector. The three central pillars of this transformation are: (i) reducing NPLs, \nparticularly in the SOCBs;6 (ii) restructuring the SOCBs to make them more commercially viable \nand to avoid new NPLs; and (iii) promoting a stronger credit culture and competitiveness in the \nbanking  and  financial  sector  as  a  whole  to  prepare  for  market  shifts,  such  as  interest  rate \nliberalization  and  local  currency  operations  by  foreign  banks.  The  success  of  these  interlinked \nmeasures  will  determine  the  ability  of  the  PRC  to  generate  the  positive  and  sustainable  credit \nexpansion needed to fuel the growing economy.  \n \n\n1. \n\nWorld Trade Organization Accession and Competition from Foreign Banks \n\n \n10. \nThe  PRC\u2019s  accession  to  the  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO)  further  emphasizes  the \nurgency of SOE and financial sector reform, especially with respect to the four SOCBs. Given that \nWTO entry effectively opens the PRC\u2019s financial sector to foreign participants, the PRC\u2019s financial \ninstitutions will face increasing competition and challenges.  \n \n11. \nIn an attempt to penetrate the growing and lucrative PRC banking market, foreign financial \ninstitutions  have  invested  in  several  PRC  banks  over  the  past  few  years.  Although  the  pace  of \nthese  investments  has  increased,  it  is  worth  noting  that  so  far  they  have  been  limited  to \ninvestments in city banks and joint-stock banks.7 No foreign investment in any of the SOCBs has \nyet reached financial closure.  \n\n \n2. \n\nSOCB Restructuring and Corporatization \n\n \n12. \nGiven  the  dominant  role  that  the  four  SOCBs  have  in  the  overall  PRC  financial  system, \nthe  Government  can  not  afford  to  put  the  survival  of  the  four  SOCBs  at  risk.  Therefore,  in  an \nattempt  to  prepare  for  future  competition  from  foreign  banks  and  to  respond  to  the  other \nchallenges  faced  by  the  four  banks,  the  Government  has  increased  its  support  for  shareholder \nreform. It selected BOC as one of two SOCBs to be restructured into joint stock companies 8 and \nto undergo major corporate restructuring. \n \nC. \n \n\nTrends in the PRC Banking Industry \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Growth Has Led to Growing Demand for Banking Products \n\n \n13. \nThe  PRC\u2019s  GDP  increased  from  $150  billion  in  1980  to  $1.8  trillion  in  2005,  with  an \naverage annual growth of 9.4%. Its foreign trade rose during the same period from $20 billion to \n$1.2 trillion, surpassing that of Japan. The PRC is currently the sixth largest economy in the world \nand its GDP growth continues to outpace those of other countries. If the average GDP growth of \n                                            \n \n6   To  aid  in  the  transformation  and  restructuring,  the  Government  established  four  asset  management  companies \n(AMCs)  in  1999.  Cinda  AMC  is  responsible  for  NPLs  from  the  CCB  and  the  China  Development  Bank  (CDB),  the \nHuarong  AMC  for  the  ICBC,  the  Orient  AMC  for  the  BOC,  and  the  Great  Wall  AMC  for  the  ABC.  In  the  following \nyears, the SOCBs transferred a total of CNY1.37 trillion NPLs at face value to these AMCs. \n\n7   All of the investments have been minority equity stakes usually between 5\u201320%. PRC regulations regarding foreign \ninvestment  limit  any  one  foreign  investor  to  20%  and  foreign  investors  in  aggregate  to  25%  equity  stakes  in  a \ndomestic financial institution.   \n\n8   The other one is CCB. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nthe  last  10  years  continues,  by  2010  the  PRC  could  become  the  fourth  largest  economy  in  the \nworld, surpassing the United Kingdom and France; by 2015 it could be the third largest economy, \nsurpassing Germany. The PRC is rated A- by Standard & Poor\u2019s and A2 by Moody\u2019s. \n \n14. \nThis economic growth has substantially increased per capita income. In particular, the per \ncapita  annual  disposable  income  of  urban  households  has  risen  significantly  over  the  past  3 \nyears (Table 1). Such growth will foster a growing demand for banking products and services.  \n \n\nTable 1: Key Economic Data \n\n \nAs of the year ended 31 December \n\nCompound Annual \nGrowth Rate \n \n(2000\u20132004) \n11.1% \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n10.7% \n\n8.0 \n\n2002 \n10,240\n8.0\n1,285\n7,997\n7,703\n\n2003 \n11,669\n9.1\n1,292\n9,032\n8,472\n\n2004 \n13,652 a\n9.5 a\n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n  9,422 \n\n2001 \n2000 \n8,947  9,731\n7.3\n1,267  1,276\n7,086  7,651\n6,280  6,860\n\nItem \nNominal GDP (CNY billion) \nReal GDP growth (%) \nPopulation (in millions) \nGDP per capita (CNY) \nPer capita annual \ndisposable income of urban \nhouseholds (CNY) \n \u2014 = not available, GDP = gross domestic product. \na Based on preliminary estimates by the National Bureau of Statistics of the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n Source: National Bureau of Statistics of the PRC. \n \n15. \nLoans  by  and  deposits  with  financial  institutions  have  grown  rapidly.

PRC corporations are the \ngrowth  engine  of  the  country\u2019s  economic  development.  In  the  past,  a  large  majority  of  loans  by \nPRC  financial  institutions  have  been  made  to  SOEs,  a  trend  which  will  change  as  financial \nreforms  continue.  In  addition,  newly  founded  privately-owned  corporations  are  becoming \nincreasingly important borrowers. \n \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\n17. \nAs the PRC banking industry has been reformed, banking institutions have been allowed \nto offer consumer lending products. Rising incomes are likely to foster growing consumer demand \nfor banking products and services. It is anticipated that retail banking will continue to grow, with \nincreasing demands for mortgages and other consumer loans. According to the National Bureau \nof  Statistics,  consumer  loans  in  the  PRC  totaled  CNY2.0  trillion  in  2004,  representing  10.5%  of \ntotal loans and 14.6% of GDP, and grew at a compound annual growth rate of 36.5% from 2002 \nto 2004. \n \n18.  Mortgage  loans  represented  the  majority  of  overall  consumer  loans  in  2003,  and  were \nfueled  by  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  reform  the  housing  system,  under  which  employees  of \nstate-owned  enterprises  previously  received  free  or  subsidized  housing.  Mortgage  loans  have \ngrown  rapidly  from  CNY609.9  billion  in  2001  to  over  CNY1.2  trillion  in  2003,  according  to  the \nMinistry of Construction. \n \n19. \nThe  vast  majority  of  bank  cards  in  the  PRC  are  debit  cards.  There  are  approximately \n517,000 credit and points-of-sale and 67,000 automated teller machines (ATMs) in the PRC. The \ncredit  card  market  has  so  far  been  limited  for  a  variety  of  reasons,  including  the  limited \nacceptance  of  cards  by  merchants,  the  underdevelopment  of  a  national  payment  infrastructure, \nand  the  absence  of  a  nationwide  consumer  credit  information  system.  According  to  the  PRC \nUnionpay,  an  electronic  interbank  information  exchange  and  transaction  network,  at  the  end  of \n2004, 815 million banking cards had been issued in the PRC, only 11 million of which were credit \ncards. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nThe Investee Company \n\n \nA. \n \n20. \nEstablished in  1921,  BOC  is  the  second  largest of  the  PRC\u2019s  four  SOCBs  as  ranked  by \ntotal  assets.  After  the  founding  of  the  PRC  in  1949,  BOC  was  restructured  to  specialize  in \ninternational  trade  finance.  At  the  same  time,  its  operations  were  merged  into  the  new  central \nbank,  PBOC.  In  1979,  at  the  onset  of  PRC\u2019s  economic  reforms,  BOC  was  separated  from  the \nPBOC and became the PRC\u2019s designated foreign exchange bank. Today, traditional commercial \nbanking  constitutes  the  majority  of  BOC\u2019s  business,  which  comprises  corporate  banking,  retail \nbanking,  and  banking  with  financial  institutions.  In  line  with  the  developing  trends  in  the \ninternational  financial  industry,  BOC  has  strengthened  its  commercial  banking  business  while \nexpanding its investment banking and insurance activities.  \n \n21. \nBOC  operates  11,307  domestic  branches  and  603  overseas  branches,  and  has \nsubsidiaries in 27 countries and regions around the world. At the end of 2003, it had more than \n188,000 staff. Domestic lending represents about three quarters of its gross loans and over 80% \nof  domestic  loans  are  corporate  loans  (about  half  of  which  are  to  SOEs).  BOC  also  dominates \nforeign exchange services and accounts for about 50% of PRC\u2019s foreign currency deposit market.  \n \n22. \nBOC has the most extensive global network of the PRC\u2019s banks. It maintains a significant \npresence in Hong Kong, China, and in Macau, China. Its subsidiary, Bank of China (Hong Kong) \nLimited (BOCHK), is the second largest banking group in Hong Kong, China, with approximately \n17% of the domestic deposit market at the end of 2003.9 BOCHK\u2019s financial performance is the \n                                            \n \n9 In 2001, BOC successfully restructured its operations in Hong Kong by merging 10 of its member banks into BOCHK, \na  locally  registered  bank.  In  July  2002,  BOCHK  listed  successfully  on  the  Hong  Kong  Stock  Exchange.  The  $2.8 \nbillion  offering  was  over-subscribed  by  7.5  times,  indicating  strong  support  not  only  for  BOCHK  but  also  for  the \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nstrongest  in  the  BOC  group.  In  2003,  the  combined  Hong  Kong,  China,  and  Macau,  China, \noperations accounted for 22.5% of total assets of the Group, and 23.8% of total operating profit \nbefore provisions. In 2004, these operations accounted for 23.1% of total assets, and 38.3% of \ntotal operating profit before provisions. \n \nIn  December  2003,  the  Government  injected  $22.5  billion10 of  fresh  capital  into  BOC. \n23. \nBefore this capital injection, the entire balance of BOC\u2019s shareholders\u2019 equity was transferred to \nprovisions  to  absorb  write-offs  of  NPLs.  BOC  issued  CNY26.07  billion  in  subordinated  debt  in \n2004 to further strengthen its regulatory capital adequacy ratio and to fund its future growth. \n \n24. \nBOC is rated BBB- by Standard & Poor\u2019s. The rating reflects the Government support as \ndemonstrated by the capital injection in 2003, BOC\u2019s sale of problem loans, and reform initiatives \nby the bank itself, all of which have led to considerable improvements in BOC\u2019s financial profile.  \n \n25. \nIn August 2004, BOC announced that it had reorganized itself into a joint-stock company, \n100% owned by Central SAFE Investments Ltd. (SAFE). SAFE is a state owned company set up \nat  the  end  of  2003  to  hold  the  shares  in  BOC  on  behalf  of  the  PRC  Government.  The  new \ncompany has taken over the assets and liabilities, claims, and employees of the former BOC and \nmaintains its business scope.  \n \nBOC  has  used  its  former  international  focus  to  take  a  leading  position  among  the  PRC \n26. \nbanks. Domestically, it has strong market share in the PRC and in Hong Kong, China, and Macau, \nChina. It also occupies niche positions in other overseas markets and has the largest overseas \nbranch network of all PRC banks.  \n \n\nBOC  has  been  negotiating  with  a  number  of  potential  investors,  including  ADB,  on  the \n\nIV. \n\nPROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\n \n27. \nsale of a strategic equity stake. \n \n28. \nvaluation and resulting shareholding of ADB remains subject to negotiation. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nADB\u2019s  exact  shareholding  will  be  a  function  of  the  yet-to-be  finalized  pricing.  Exact \n\n \nA. \n \n\nJustification for the ADB Investment  \n\n1. \n\nInvestment Rationale \n\n \n29. \nIt is a consensus view among academic researchers that the main underlying cause of the \n1997  Asian  financial  crisis  was  related  to  the  poor  quality  of  the  affected  countries\u2019  financial \ninstitutions.  There  is  therefore  concern  about  the  capacity  of  the  PRC  banking  system  and \nespecially of its dominant players, the four SOCBs. Strengthening the financial system to promote \nefficient  resource  utilization  will  be  fundamental  to  restructuring  industry,  achieving  better \n\n                                                                                                                                               \n \n\ncorporatization  and  listing  of  PRC  state-owned  commercial  banks  in  general.  Shortly  after  the  listing,  BOCHK  was \nincluded  into  key  international  benchmarks  such  as  the  MSCI  Hong  Kong  Index,  signifying  the  importance  of  the \nbank in global financial markets. The deal was a landmark in the development of the BOC and a significant move in \nthe  reform  of  the  PRC\u2019s  banking  industry.  This  became  a  key  channel  for  BOC  to  introduce  modern  commercial \nbanking practices into the PRC. BOC continues to hold a 65.91% equity stake in BOCHK. \n\n10  The capital injection was made from the PRC Government\u2019s foreign exchange reserves. \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nintegration  among  regions,  bolstering  macroeconomic  performance,  and  allowing  the  PRC  to \nopen  its  financial  markets  to  the  world  without  risking  undue  financial  instability.  Despite  the \nimportant  steps  taken  over  recent  years,  the  fundamental  capabilities  and  incentives  of  the \nfinancial system to allocate credit efficiently remain impaired. \n \nThe PRC Government has decided to partially restructure BOC through strategic sales of \n30. \nequity  stakes,  followed by  an  IPO.  It  believes  that  such  strategic  investors  will  ensure  that  best \npractices in terms of corporate governance, management, credit and technology are transferred \nto BOC. The PRC\u2019s accession to the WTO and the expected increase in foreign competition has \nheightened the importance of equipping BOC with such practices.  \n \n\n2. \n\nDevelopment Impact and Effectiveness \n\n \nThe  proposed  investment  will  promote  best  credit  and  governance  practices.  BOC\u2019s  \n31. \nrestructuring  will  serve  as  a  demonstration  model  and  will  catalyze  reforms  and  restructuring \nwithin  other  financial  institutions.  Broad-based  restructuring  in  the  financial  sector  will  be \nnecessary  as  the  PRC  prepares  for  intensified  competition  from  foreign  players  entering  the \nfinancial sector as a result of WTO accession. \n \n\n3. \n\nValue Added of the Asian Development Bank \n\nAsian Development Bank Sector and Country Strategies \n\n \n32. \nADB\u2019s  proposed  investment  in  BOC  will  add  value  by  (i)  providing  direct  support  for \ncorporate  governance  and  implementation  of  safeguards,  and  (ii)  supporting  financial  sector \nreform in the PRC. \n \nB. \n \n33 \nADB\u2019s strategy in the PRC financial sector focuses on supporting the PRC Government to \nestablish a conducive policy and institutional framework and an efficient market infrastructure for \nthe financial markets. The role of the financial sector in delivering ADB\u2019s operational objectives is \ncritical, particularly in areas of poverty reduction, governance, and private sector development.11 \n \nADB\u2019s  PRC  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP)  aims  to  address  poverty  primarily \n34. \nthrough  pro-poor  economic  growth,  which  has  at  its  center  the  enhancement  of  markets  by \npromoting  good  governance  and  expanding  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations,  especially  in \npreparation  for  the  intensified  competition  in  the  financial  sector  brought  about  by  the  WTO \naccession.  \n \n35. \nThe  CSP  recommends  that  ADB  should  enhance  governance  by  (i)  encouraging \ngovernment  agencies,  SOEs  and  financial  institutions  to  adopt  sound  corporate  governance \nstandards in harmony with international best practices; (ii) strengthening the legal, regulatory, and \nsupervisory \nfinancial  market  regulators, \nsupervisors,  industry  associations,  and  individual  banks  and  other  financial  institutions;  and  (iii) \nsetting  minimum  criteria  for  sound  corporate  governance  standards  by  market  participants.  In \naddition, and with respect to ADB\u2019s private sector operations, the CSP makes specific reference \nto  ADB  taking  equity  positions  in  domestic  financial  institutions  to  promote  financial  sector \n\ninstitutional  capabilities  of \n\nframework,  and \n\nthe \n\n                                            \n \n11 ADB. 2003.

Within  ADB,  the  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  (PSOD),  the  East  and  Central \nAsia  Governance  and  Finance  Division  (ECGF),  and  the  PRC  Resident  Mission  (PRCM)  have \nworked closely together with respect to financial sector reforms in the PRC. ADB public sector\u2019s \nactivities  have  been  focused  on  policy  dialogue  with  the  PRC  Government  and  knowledge \ntransfer, while PSOD has concentrated on private sector transactions. The two approaches work \nhand-in-hand and complement each other.  \n \nD. \n \nThe proposed investment is in line with ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy.13 The strategy \n37. \nstates  that  ADB  seeks  to  promote  \u201csound  and  efficient  banking  systems  and  capital  markets,\u201d \nsince  these  are  seen  as  \u201cindispensable  for  macroeconomic  stability,  mobilizing  savings,  and \nensuring availability of long-term financing, an essential requirement for pro-poor growth.\u201d This is \nsupported by a recent United Nations report,14 which noted that \u201c[\u2026] it is impossible for a country \nto  progress  without  domestic  investment  based  on  domestic  savings.  This  requires  financial \ninstitutions  that  can  effectively  manage  risk  and  allocate  capital  to  productive  investment.\u201d \nHowever, the report continues, a financial sector should have a high private sector participation, \nas best practices are typically driven by leading private sector banks. \n \n38. \nThe  financial  sector  is  the  most  effective  and  efficient  conduit  in  any  economy  for \nchanneling funds from savings and other sources of capital to companies and entrepreneurs who \ninvest the funds in projects and operations which create economic value and economic growth. \nFinance is the  oil  for the engines of growth.  The financial system is  the system  of institutions  and \noperations  that  enable  financial  resources  to  be  put  to  productive  use.  The  impact  on  poverty  is \ntypically indirect, and takes place through the multiplier effects a functioning financial sector has \non the economy as a whole, including SMEs and other pro-poor growth-engines. Indirect effects \nenable the economy to function better, increase employment, improve the scale and efficiency of \ncapital  utilization,  and  lead  to  higher  labor  productivity  and  demand. 15  In  the  PRC,  lack  of \nfinancing has been identified as the greatest perceived obstacle to doing business.16 \n \nE. \n \n39. \nBOC  has  been  classified  as  financial  intermediary  (FI)  with  respect  to  environmental \nconcerns. ADB has provided BOC with all applicable ADB policies and discussed their relevance \nand  importance.  BOC  will  be  required  to  (i)  adopt  an  appropriate  environmental  management \nsystem, consisting of a (a) policy and (b) procedures to ensure compliance with applicable local \nlaws; and (ii) undergo training in environmental impact assessment and auditing.  \n                                            \n \n12 This is emphasized again in ADB. 2005.

Despite the monetary and financial sector reforms,2 the financial sector does \n1. \nnot  meet  the  needs  of  a  market  economy.  Indirect  monetary  policy  instruments  (e.g.,  open \nmarket  operations)  are  not  fully  developed  and  interest  rate  policy  remains  inflexible.  The \nregulatory  and  supervisory  framework  for  banks  and  nonbank  financial  institutions  remains \nweak.  Despite  substantial  progress, 3  the  capital  markets  are  underdeveloped  and  not \nadequately  regulated  and  supervised.  Weaknesses  in  the  banking  sector,  high  levels  of  non-\nperforming  loan  (NPLs),  incomplete  state-owned  enterprise  (SOE)  reforms,  and  incomplete \npension  reforms  remain  causes  of  concern.  The  People\u2019s  Bank  of  China  (PBOC),  the  China \nSecurities  Regulatory  Commission  (CSRC),  the  China  Insurance  Regulatory  Commission \n(CIRC),  and  the  China  Banking  Regulatory  Commission  (CBRC)  are  placing  increased \nemphasis on improving corporate governance in the financial sector. \n\nPlans  have  been  announced \n\n \nBanking.  There  are  4  state-owned  commercial  banks  (SOCBs),4 3  policy  banks,5 12 \n2. \njoint-stock banks, 112 city commercial banks, as well as foreign banks.6 Banking dominates the \nfinancial  market  with  around  80%  share  in  total  assets.7 The  profitability  of  SOCBs  and  the \npolicy banks is lower than what would be acceptable to commercial banks in a market economy. \nSOCBs  and  policy  banks  devote  most  of  their  lending  to  SOEs  or  designated  development \nprojects,  while  the  joint-stock  and city  commercial  banks  are  more  private  sector-oriented  and \nlend to SMEs.8 \n \n3. \njoint-stock \ncommercial banks to merge and restructure. The SOCBs will be corporatized as an initial step in \nthe restructuring process. They are at different stages of launching their restructuring initiatives. \nOver the last 4 years, they have closed more than 21,000 branch offices and shed more than \n100,000  personnel.  The  joint-stock  commercial  banks  are  now  moving  to  list  on  the  stock \nexchanges. \n \n4. \nThe five-category loan classification system was adopted at the end of 2001, after trial \ntesting  in  Guangdong  province. 9  Commercial  banks  now  stop  interest  accrual  if  a  loan  is \noverdue by 90 days. Banks are requested to make adequate loan provisioning for bad debts.10 \nAccording to PBOC, the NPL level for the four SOCBs was 26.5% of the total loans as of the \nend of 2001. BOC is to reduce the NPL ratio to 15% by 2004 and to less than 10% by 2005\u2013\n2006.11 \n \n\nto  modernize  SOCBs  and  encourage \n\n                                            \n1   ADB. 2004.

Over 30 foreign banks obtained licenses to conduct yuan business before WTO accession. \n7   As of 2000, banking sector deposits stood at CNY12 trillion (150% of GDP), while loans were below CNY10 trillion. \n8   Twelve percent of total SOCB lending was to private enterprises; 80% of non-SOCB lending went to small and \n\nmedium-sized enterprises. \n\n9   The five categories are standard, special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss. \n10 Although general provisioning before tax is allowed up to 1% of the total outstanding loans. \n11  Official estimates of NPLs are considered an underestimate by some foreign observers. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nCapital Markets. Although the capitalization of the securities market continues to grow, \n5. \nSOEs  dominate  the  listed  firms.  About  70%  of  the  SOE  shares  are  nontradable.  The \ngovernment dominates the listed firms. The  government and regulators are exploring options to \nsell state shares without disrupting the markets and allow entry of foreign securities firms in line \nwith WTO accession agreement. \n  \n6. \nmanaged, corporate governance of listed enterprises has the following weaknesses:  \n \n\n \nWhile  market  forces  will  exert  pressure  on  how  listed  enterprises  are  organized  and \n\nfragmented control structure for SOEs; \n\nopaque ownership structures; \n\n(i) \n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\npoor  internal  control  arrangements,  with  generally  dominant  management  and \nboard  of  directors,  weak  independent  board  of  supervisors,  and  inadequate \nprotection of minority shareholder rights; \n\n(iv) \n\nlow or no professional requirements for membership of boards; \n\n(v) \n\nrestrictions on resale of shares held by promoters and directors; and \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(vi) \n\npoor  disclosure  practices,  lack  of  transparency,  poor  accounting  and  auditing \npractices, and misleading or fraudulent financial statements. \n\n \nFundamental changes are needed to strengthen the capital market. The Securities Law, \n7. \nCompany  Law,  Trust  Law,  and  other  related  regulations  need  to  be  rationalized  to  clarify \nCSRC\u2019s  investigative,  enforcement,  and  disciplinary  powers.  However,  the  implicit  preference \nfor listings by SOEs continues, despite the recent efforts to change the quota system. \n \n8. \nState-Owned  Enterprises. While the SOEs were the backbone of the PRC\u2019s economy \nduring the central planning era, their role in gross domestic product has declined over the last \ntwo  decades. 12  The  financial  performance  of  some  SOEs  has  been  weak  due  to  poor \nmanagement,  poor  technology,  political  interference,  poor  investment  decisions,  soft  budget \nconstraints, overemployment, heavy social welfare responsibilities, and lack of competitiveness. \nIn recent years, however, the performance of some SOEs has improved. \n \nBeginning in 1997, the Government of the PRC launched a campaign to reform SOEs to \n9. \nrestructure large SOEs that were able to compete globally and privatize small ones. Thousands \nof  smaller  SOEs  were  sold,  closed, or  merged.  About  26  million  SOE  workers  were  laid  off  in \n1998\u20132001.  Despite  the  corporatization  that  transformed  most  SOEs  into  limited  liability \ncompanies and about 1,000 SOEs being listed in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, \ncorporate  governance  standards  of  SOEs  need  substantial  improvement.  In  2002,  the  State \nEconomic  and  Trade  Commission  (SETC)  and  CSRC  formulated  codes  of  conduct  for  listed \nSOEs. No assessment has been made to verify the compliance of SOEs with these codes. \n \n10. \nRural  Finance.  The  rural  financial  system  comprises  a  policy  bank  (Agricultural \nDevelopment  Bank  of  China),  a  commercial  bank  (Agricultural  Bank  of  China),  and  the  rural \ncredit cooperative (RCC) system. Over 28,000 RCCs account for 13% of deposits and 10% of \n\n                                            \n12  The  contribution  of  SOEs  to  GDP  fell  from  58%  in  1980  to  37%  in  2000,  and  the  share  of  the  SOEs  in  gross \n\nindustrial output fell from 37% in 1994 to 25% in 2000, but they still account for 55% of employment. \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n15 \n\nloans  of  the  banking  sector,  and  60%  of  agricultural  loans.  RCCs  are  controlled  by  various \nlevels  of  governments  to  channel  funds  to  SOEs,  township  and  village  enterprises  with \ngovernment  connections,  and  government  agencies  such  as  the  state  grain  bureaus.  Rural \nhouseholds, especially those with low incomes, lack access to formal credit. Large numbers of \nrural households must turn to moneylenders, friends, or relatives in the informal credit market. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f% \nStake \n\nAmount \n(CNY \nmillion) \n\nPurchase \nPrice/Book \nValue of Equity \n(multiple) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n16 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n\nMAJOR EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN THE PEOPLE\u2019S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\u2019S  \nFINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS BY FOREIGN STRATEGIC INVESTORSa \n(CNY million) \n\nDate \n\nInvestor \n\nPRC Bank \n\n \nSept-99 \n\nNov-01 \n\n \nInternational Finance \nCorporation \nInternational Finance \nCorporation \nHSBC \n\nDec-01 \nDec-01   Shacom \nMar-02 \n\n \nBank of Shanghai \n\nBank of Nanjing \n\nBank of Shanghai \nBank of Shanghai \nBank of Shanghai \n\nDec-02 \nDec-03 \n\nDec-03 \n\nDec-03 \nJun-04 \n\nAug-04 \nSep-04 \n\nNov-04 \n\nDec-04 \nJan-05 \nMar-05 \nJun-05 \n\nInternational Finance \nCorporation \nCitibank \nThe Government of \nSingapore Investment \nCorporation \nInternational Finance \nCorporation \nHang Seng Bank  \nNewbridge Capital \n\nHSBC \nCommonwealth Bank of \nAustralia \nStandard Chartered \n(pending) \nICBC (Asia) \nTemasek \nING (pending) \nBank of America \n(pending)b \n\nPudong Development \nIndustrial Bank \n\nIndustrial Bank \n\nIndustrial Bank \nShenzhen Development \nBank \nBank of Communications \nJinan City Commercial \nBank \nTianjin Bohai Bank (new \nbank) \nChinese Mercantile Bank \nMinsheng Bank \nBank of Beijing \nChina Construction Bank \n\n5.0 \n\n15.0 \n\n8.0 \n3.0 \n2.0 \n\n5.0 \n5.0 \n\n4.0 \n\n16.0 \n17.9 \n\n19.9 \n11.0 \n\n20.0 \n\n100.0 \n4.6 \n19.9\n19.9\n\n183 \n\n219 \n\n518 \n\u2014 \n208 \n\n600 \n540 \n\n432 \n\n1,726 \n1,235 \n\n14,461 \n141 \n\n\u2014 \n\n794 \n\u2014 \n1,780 \n26,000 \n\n2005 \n\nHSBC \n\nPing An Insurance \n\n16.0\n\n1,040 \n\n2005 \n\nCarlyle Group (pending)  China Pacific Insurance \n\n25.0\n\n3,244 \n\n\u2014 = not available, CNY = yuan, HSBC = Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp., ICBC = Industrial and Commercial Bank \nof China. \na   Goldman Sachs\u2019 research estimates and press reports. \nb  Based on press reports.

China\u2019s  (PRC\u2019s)  central  bank,  the  People\u2019s  Bank  of  China \n1. \n(PBOC),  was  formerly  also  the  PRC\u2019s  banking  industry  regulator.  In  April  2003,  the  State \nCouncil  established  the  China  Banking  Regulatory  Commission  (CBRC,  and  together  with \nPBOC,  referred  to  as  the  Regulator),  to  take  over  most  of  the  banking  supervisory  functions \nfrom  PBOC.  After  these  reforms,  CBRC  became  the  primary  banking  industry  regulator, \nresponsible  for  the  supervision  and  administration  of  all  banks  in  the  PRC  and  their  business \nactivities.  PBOC  retained  certain  supervisory  functions,  and  became  primarily  responsible  for \nformulating and implementing monetary policy as the PRC\u2019s central bank. \n \n2. \nKey laws applicable to banks in the PRC include the Commercial Bank Law, Company \nLaw, PBOC Law, and Law on the Supervision and Administration of Banking Business. In the \ncourse of implementing these laws, the Regulator has issued various regulations, circulars, and \nnotices covering specific issues. \n \n3. \nAccording  to  the  Commercial  Bank  Law,  the  establishment  of  commercial  banks  and \ntheir branches is subject to examination and approval by the Regulator. The minimum amount \nof registered capital for the establishment of a nation wide commercial bank is CNY1 billion and \nthe registered capital should be paid up in full. When establishing a branch, commercial banks \nshould allocate appropriate amounts of working capital to the branch in the light of the proposed \nscale  of  operations  of  the  branch.  The  total  working  capital  allocated  to  the  branches  of  a \ncommercial bank should not exceed 60% of the total capital of the head office.  \n \n\nB. \n\nRegistered Capital and Shareholder Qualifications \n\n \nAny  change  of  a  commercial  bank\u2019s  registered  capital  is  subject  to  the  approval  of  the \n4. \nRegulator. Under the Commercial Bank Law, investments in a commercial bank by a domestic \nentity are subject to the approval of the Regulator if the investment amounts to more than a 5% \ninterest in the bank. \n \n5. \nSome  dated  (1994)  regulations  setting  out  the  qualifications  for  domestic  corporate \nshareholders  in  financial  institutions  are  being  applied  while  new  regulations  are  being \nprepared.  The  qualification  requirements  of  domestic  corporate  investors  (excluding  financial \ninstitutions) under the regulations include the following: \n \n\nThe  investor  should  be  a  legal  person  registered  with  the  PRC  State \nAdministration for Industry and Commerce or its competent branches. \n\nThe  investor  must  repay  its  bank  loans  promptly  and  must  be  profitable  for  the \npast 3 years before its investment. \n\nThe investor\u2019s net assets should be no less than 30% of its total assets after its \nannual profit distribution. \n\nThe  investor\u2019s  aggregated  investment  in  other  enterprises  (including  financial \ninstitutions) should not be more than 50% of the investor\u2019s net assets.  \n\n(v) \n\nThe investor may not borrow from banks to finance its investment. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n                                            \n1 Source: Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\f32 \n\n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe  requirements  and  procedures  applicable  to  foreign  equity  participation  in  a \n6. \ncommercial  bank  are  set  out  in  the  Administrative  Measures  on  Foreign  Financial  Institutions\u2019 \nInvestment  in  Domestic  Financial  Institutions,  issued  by  CBRC  in  December  2003  (Foreign \nInvestment Measures).   \n \n7. \nThe  Foreign  Investment  Measures  apply  to  investment  by  foreigners  in  \u201cdomestic \nfinancial  institutions\u201d.  A  distinction  is  drawn  between  \u201cforeign-invested  financial  institutions\u201d \n(which  by  definition  must  in  aggregate  have  25%  or  more  foreign  investment)  and  \u201cdomestic \nfinancial  institutions\u201d  (which  must  by  definition  at  all  times  have  less  than  25%  foreign \ninvestment). Increasing foreign investment beyond this cap would result in the conversion of the \nbank  from  a  \u201cdomestic  financial  institution\u201d  into  a  \u201cforeign-invested  financial  institution\u201d,  which \nwill be subject to various restrictions set out in PRC laws and regulations on foreign participation \nin the PRC banking sector. The Foreign Investment Measures also provide for a cap of 20% on \neach respective foreign investor. \n \n8. \nUnder the Foreign Investment Measures, a foreign investor in a PRC bank is required to \nbe a \u201cfinancial institution\u201d, which includes \u201cfinancial holding companies\u201d, banks and other types \nof financial institutions. The foreign investor is required to meet the following qualifications: \n \n\nThe investor\u2019s total assets at the end of the preceding fiscal year should not be \nless than $10 billion. \n\nDuring  the  preceding  2  consecutive  years,  the  investor  should  have  been \nprofitable  and  have  maintained  a  good  long-term  credit  rating  from  an \ninternational rating institution acknowledged by CBRC. \n\n(iii)  Where the investor is a commercial bank, it should have a capital adequacy ratio \nof not less than 8%; and in case of a nonbank financial institution, a ratio of total \ncapital to total risk-weighted assets of at least 10%. \n\nThe investor should have sound internal control systems. \n\nThe  investor  should  be  registered  in  a  jurisdiction  with  a  sound  financial \ninstitutions regulatory system and \u201cgood economic conditions\u201d. \n\nForeign  investors  are  required  to  invest  in  \u201cgood  faith\u201d  and  \u201cfor  the  long  term\u201d,  so  that \n\nThe  target  bank  must  apply  to  CBRC  for  approval  of  the  investment  by  the  foreign \n9. \nfinancial institution. Key documents to be submitted with the application include (i) shareholders \nand/or board resolutions of the foreign investor and the target bank approving the transaction; \n(ii) a letter of intent signed by the parties; and (iii) the financial statements and other background \ninformation  with  respect  to  the  foreign  investor,  such  as  the  relevant  rating  reports  and \napprovals of the foreign investor\u2019s regulator. \n \n10. \nexit strategies such as put options may not be permitted. \n \n11. \nCBRC is required to make a decision on whether or not to approve the application within \nthree months from the date on which it receives the complete set of application documents. This \ntime  period  may  recommence  several  times  if  CBRC  requires  changes  or  additions  to  the \ndocument package provided.  \n \n12. \nbank within 60 business days after receiving CBRC\u2019s approval.  \n \n \n\nThe  foreign  investor  must  make  its  registered  capital  contribution  in  full  to  the  target \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "RRP: PRC 38917 \n", " \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION \n \nOF THE \n \nPRESIDENT \n \nTO THE \n \nBOARD OF DIRECTORS \n \nON A  \n \nPROPOSED EQUITY INVESTMENT \n \nIN \n \nBANK OF CHINA LTD. \n  \nIN THE PEOPLE\u2019S REPUBLIC OF CHINA \n \n \n", "September 2005\n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 5 September 2005) \n \n", "Currency Unit \u2013 yuan (CNY) \nCNY1.00 = $0.1233 \n$1.00 = CNY8.11 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", " \nADB \nAMC \nARC \nBOC \nBOCC \nCAGR \nCAR \nCBRC \nCSP \nDMC \nECGF \nGAAP \nGIAS \nIFRS \nIFC \nIPO \nIRR \nMDB \nMOF \nNPA \nNPL \nPBOC \nPRC \nPRCM \nPSOD \nPSOP \nSME \nSOCB \nSOE \nTA \nWTO \n", " \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", " \nAsian Development Bank \nasset management company \nasset reconstruction company \nBank of China \nBank of Communications \ncompounded annual growth rate \ncapital adequacy ratio \nChina Banking Regulatory Commission \ncountry strategy and program \ndeveloping member country \nEast and Central Asia Governance Finance and Trade Division \ngenerally accepted accounting principles \ngap information analysis system \ninternational financial reporting standards \nInternational Finance Corporation \ninitial public offering \ninternal rate of return \nmultilateral development bank \nMinistry of Finance \nnonperforming asset \nnonperforming loan \nPeople\u2019s Bank of China \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \nResident Mission of People\u2019s Republic of China \nPrivate Sector Operations Department \nPrivate Sector Operations Division \nsmall or medium-sized company \nstate-owned commercial bank \nstate-owned enterprise \ntechnical assistance \nWorld Trade Organization \n", "NOTE \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars \n", "This report was prepared by W.
