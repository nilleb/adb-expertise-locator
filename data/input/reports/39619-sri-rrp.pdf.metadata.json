Consulting \nservices  will  be  provided  to  support  project  implementation, \nstrengthening the project management capability of the Eastern \nProvincial  Road  Development  Department  (EPRDD)  and  North \nCentral Provincial Road Development Authority (NCPRDA). \n \nOverall road sector management capacity in both provinces will \nbe  enhanced  by  (i)  modernizing  the  EPRDD  office,  and  (ii) \nimproving the capacity of EPRDD and NCPRDA to manage road \nassets. \n \nThose  who  live  in  eastern  Sri  Lanka  have  especially  suffered \nfrom the consequences of the country\u2019s prolonged conflict. With \nthe  holding  of  elections  in  the  Eastern  Province,  and  the \nconstitution  of  the  Provincial  Council,  the  Government  of  Sri \nLanka has focused on Eastern Province's development (and that \nof  adjacent  provinces)  within  the  framework  of  devolution \nintroduced  by  the  13th  amendment  to  the  Constitution.  The \nProject  will  support  the  Government's  objective  by  improving \nprovincial  roads    and  strengthening  and  enhancing  capacity  of \ndevolved  structures  of  provincial  road  institutions  in  Eastern \nProvince and adjacent NCP. \n \nThe  Project  will  improve  connectivity  in  the  provinces\u2019  transport \nnetworks. Improved roads\u2014in conjunction with a range of other \nthe  country \ncarefully  coordinated  measures  proposed \npartnership  strategy \nto  strengthen \nadministrative  and  absorptive  capacity  in  poorer  regions\u2014will \ncontribute  to  poverty  reduction.  By  improving  connectivity  to \nneglected  areas,  the  Project  will  support  socially  inclusive \ndevelopment.  Therefore,  because  it  will  contribute  to  reducing \n\n(CPS)  and  designed \n\nin \n\n \n\nBorrower \n \nClassification  \n \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\ndisparities in Sri Lanka, the Project is in line with the CPS. \nThe  institutional  capacities  of  EPRDD  and  NCPRDA  must  be \nstrengthened,  particularly \nin  planning,  programming,  and \ncontract  administration.  The  Project  will  also  help  strengthen \ntheir institutional capacity in road asset management. \n \nThe  impact  will  be  an  overall  improvement  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s \ntransport  system.  Transport  of  goods  and  services  will  be \nenhanced, contributing to economic growth and community well \nbeing.  The  Project's  immediate  outcome  will  be  an  improved \nroad  network  and  institutional  capacity  in  Eastern  Province  and \nNCP. \n \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $78.0 million, \nincluding  taxes  and  duties  of  $8.0  million  and  interest  during \nconstruction of $2.8 million.  \n \nThe  financing  plan  includes  a  loan  in  various  currencies \nequivalent  to  SDR45,320,000  ($70  million  equivalent)  from \nSpecial Funds resources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \nThe  loan  will  have  a  32-year  term,  including  an  8-year  grace \nperiod, an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per year during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per year thereafter, and such other terms \nand  conditions  as  are  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project \nagreements. \n \nUntil 30 June 2014 \n \n31 December 2013 \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency  \n \nImplementing Agencies \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\n \n\n \nMinistry of Local Government and Provincial Councils (MLGPC) \n \nEastern Provincial Council through EPRDD \nNorth Central Provincial Council through NCPRDA \n \nMLGPC,  through  the  existing  project  coordinating  unit  that  is \nresponsible  for  coordinating  project  preparatory  activities  for  all \nprovincial  roads,  will  be  responsible  for  overall  coordination  of \nthe Project, including provision of policy and technical guidance \nand  interagency  coordination.  For  procurement  and  project \nimplementation,  EPRDD  and  NCPRDA,  led  by  a  provincial \ndirector  and  general  manager,  respectively,  will  be  responsible \nfor  day-to-day  implementation.  The  provincial  director  and \ngeneral  manager  have  been  delegated  adequate  technical  and \nadministrative  authority  for  expeditious  project  implementation. \nAssisted by MLGPC, EPRDD and NCPRDA will engage project \nimplementation  consultants  separately  to  act  as  engineers  for \nthe civil works contracts. \n \n \n\n\fProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\niii\n\nto \n\nof \n\ntime)  and \n\nconsultants \n\ninternational \n\nperson-months \n\ntransport  efficiency  and  expanding  access \n\n \nProcurement  under  the  loan  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from \ntime \ntender  procedures \nthe  Government's \nacceptable  to  ADB.  Supply  contracts  will  be  procured  under \nnational  competitive  bidding  procedures  if  the  contract  values \nare  $100,000\u2013$1,000,000,  and  shopping  if  less  than  $100,000. \nAs  requested  by  the  Government,  national  competitive  bidding \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB  will  be  adopted  for  civil  works. \nThere  will  be  22  road,  4  bridge,  and  2  building  works  contract \npackages, ranging between $0.2 million and $3.4 million. \n \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nConsultants  will  be  recruited \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from \ntime to time). For each province, an international consulting firm \nin  association  with  national  consulting  firm(s)  will  be  hired  as \nproject  implementation  consultants,  which  will  assume  the  role \nof  the  engineer  for  the  civil  works  contracts.  In  total,  about \n70 \nand \n1,514 person-months of national consultants will be required.  \n \nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  the  improvement  of  the  overall \nperformance  of  road  sector  in  Eastern  Province  and  NCP  by \nimproving \nto \neconomic  opportunities  and  public  services.  The  beneficiaries \nwill  be  people,  companies,  government  agencies,  and \nnongovernment  agencies \ntransport \nservices  directly  and  indirectly.  Communities  served  by  the \nproject  roads  will  benefit  from  improved,  lower-cost,  and  faster \ntransport  services,  and  thereby  obtain  improved  access  to \neconomic opportunities and social services. The benefits are not \nconfined  to  any  specific  ethnic  or  other  social  group.  The \nimproved  roads  will  facilitate  movement  of  goods  and  people, \nand  improve  livelihood  activities  of  the  communities  along  the \nroads,  including  returned  internally  displaced  people.  The  local \nlabor force will have access to employment opportunities during \nthe  construction  phase  and  maintenance.  Transport  operators, \ncarrying both passengers and freight, will benefit from improved \nroads  in  terms  of  lower  vehicle-operating  costs,  time-savings, \nand  improved  road  safety,  thereby  increased  productivity. \nGovernment and nongovernment agencies served by the project \nroads  will  improve  their  service  delivery  due  to  improved \ntransport efficiency. \n \n \nThe  risk  of  initial  delays  has  been  mitigated  through  ensuring \nproject implementation readiness during processing. A feasibility \nstudy,  detailed  design  and  procurement  assistance  were \nprovided  through  the  ongoing  technical  assistance  loan  for  the \nRoad  Project  Preparatory  Facility.  Advance  actions  are  being \ntaken  with  the  objective  of  awarding  about  50  percent  of \n\nthat  use  project  road \n\n \n\n\floan, \n\nleaving \n\nfinancing  under \n\ncontracts  immediately  following  loan  effectiveness.  The  risk  of \ndelay  in  releasing  counterpart  funds  has  been  mitigated  by \nproviding  90%  of \nthe \nthe \nGovernment to finance only tax and duties.  \n \nPerformance-based  maintenance  after  completion  will  be \nincluded in the civil works contracts. The EPRDD and NCPRDA \nroad asset management systems will be strengthened for better \nplanning and budgeting. Maintenance budgets will be increased \nto  meet  requirements,  and  EPRDD  and  NCPRDA's  strict \nmonitoring  systems  for  implementation  will  minimize  the  risk  of \nunderutilizing  these  budgets.  The  Eastern  and  North  Central \nProvincial Councils have agreed to dedicate their vehicle license \nfee  revenues  to  routine  road  maintenance.  At  least  70%  of  the \nrequired funds for periodic road maintenance will be provided by \n2012, with gradual increases of 10% every year. \n \nThere  are  general  risks  associated  with  communal  tension  and \nsensitivities,  history,  political  uncertainty,  return  of  displaced \npersons, and considerable security staff presence. Such conflict-\nsensitive  considerations,  including  distribution  fairness  among \ndifferent ethnic groups, were taken into account when selecting \nthe roads and agreed upon by the Government and the Eastern \nand  North  Central  provincial  councils.  In  line  with  the  key \noperational  guidelines  provided  in  the  CPS  on  working  in \nthe  Project  has  been  prepared \nconflict-affected  areas, \nemphasizing \ninvolving  stakeholders  and \nbeneficiaries.   \n \nIn  conjunction  with  the  Project,  capacity-building  technical \nassistance (TA) will be provided for institutional development of \nprovincial  road  agencies  in  Eastern  Province  and  NCP  to  (i) \nmodernize the offices, (ii) improve business processes, and (iii) \nmanage  road  assets,  strengthening  their  ability  to  support  the \ndevolution  process  under \nthe \nConstitution.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $950,000,  of  which \nADB will finance $800,000 on a grant basis from its TA funding \nprogram. Consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from \ntime  to  time).  International  consulting  inputs  of  22  person-\nmonths, and 14 person-months of national consulting inputs, will \nbe  required.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  from  March  2010  to \nFebruary 2012. \n\nthe  13th  amendment  of \n\ntransparency  and \n\niv \n\n \n\n \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\n\f80  00'Eo\n\no\n81  30'E\n\nP a l k     S t r a i t\n\nJaffna\n\nKankasanturai\n\nKodikamam\n\nP a l k     B a y\n\nKilinochchi\n\nMullaittivu\n\nTanniyuttu\n\n9  00'No\n\nTalaimannar\n\nMannar\n\nMankulam\n\nN O R T H E R N\n\nPuliyankulam\n\nVavuniya\n\nSRI  LANKA\nEASTERN AND NORTH CENTRAL\nPROVINCIAL ROAD PROJECT\n\nProject Province\n\nNational Capital\n\nChief Provincial Town\n\nCity/Town\n\nProject Road\n\nNational Road\n\nProvincial Road\n\nRiver\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\n9  00'No\n\nG u l f    o f   M a n n a r\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\nHorowupotana\n\nTrincomalee\n\nB a y     o f     B e n g a l\n\nWelikanda\n\nValaichchenai\n\nPolonnaruwa\n\nDambulla\n\nE A S T E R N\n\nBatticaloa\n\nAnuradhapura\n\nN O R T H  C E N T R A L\n\nTambuttegama\n\nPuttalam\n\nKekirawa\n\nN O R T H\nW E S T E R N\n\nChilaw\n\nMadampe\n\nKurunegala\n\nMatale\n\nPolgahawela\n\nMawanella\n\nC E N T R A L\n\nKandy\n\nNegombo\n\nWarakapola\n\nMinuwangoda\n\nKegalle\n\nGampola\n\n7  00'No\n\nGampaha\n\nColombo\n\nAvissawella\n\nTalawakele\n\nNuwara Eliya Badulla\n\nWelimada\n\nSRI JAYAWARDENEPURA KOTTE\n\nMoratuwa\n\nWESTERN\n\nHatton\n\nRatnapura\n\nU V A\n\nBandarawela\n\nWellawaya\n\nMonaragala\n\nAmpara\n\n7  00'No\n\nKalutara\n\nAlutgama\n\nPelmadulla\n\nBalangoda\n\nS A B A R A G A M U W A\n\nElpitiya\n\nAmbalangoda\n\nHikkaduwa\n\nS O U T H E R N\n\nAkuressa\n\nGalle\n\nMatara\n\nTangalle\n\n80  00'Eo\n\no\n81  30'E\n\nI N D I A N      O C E A N\n\nHambantota\n\nN\n\n0\n\n10 20 30 40 50\n\nKilometers\n\n09-0945 HR\n\n\f \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Eastern and North Central Provincial \nRoad  Project  (the  Project).

In  October  2006,  administration  of  Eastern \nProvince  separated  from  the  combined  North-East  Provincial  Council.  An  elected  civil \nadministration  was  then  established  in  2008,  when  the  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  took \nadministrative  control  over  Eastern  Province.  To  catch  up  with  developments  in  other  parts  of \nthe country, the Government has been focusing on the development of Eastern Province and its \nadjacent  provinces.  It  plans  to  redevelop  and  integrate  the  province  into  the  wider  economy. \nThe  Project  will  support  the  Government's  objective  by  improving  provincial  roads  in  Eastern \nProvince  and  adjacent  North  Central  Province  (NCP).  The  project  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. Details of the provincial road analysis are in Appendix 2.  \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n3.  \nSri  Lanka  has  a  road  network  of  about  116,000  kilometers  (km),  comprising  about \n11,700  km  of  national  highways  (classes  A  and  B);  15,500  km  of  provincial  roads  (classes  C \nand  D);  65,000  km  of  local  authority  roads  (class  E);  and  the  remainder  being  unclassified \nroads. 1  Road  transport  accounts  for  90%  of  passenger  and  95%  of  freight  land  transport. \nVehicle ownership and road traffic continue to grow rapidly. \n \nWhile  the  road  network  is  extensive  (1.6  km  per  square  kilometer  [km2]),  most  roads \n4. \nwere  built  more  than  60  years  ago.  Standards  are  inadequate  to  keep  up  with  the  growing \npassenger and freight traffic. Moreover, due to neglect of road maintenance, road conditions are \noften  poor.  It  is  estimated  that  the  percentages  of  the  national  and  provincial  roads  in \nmaintainable condition are only 60% and 40%, respectively. \n \n5. \nThere  are  several  agencies  involved  in  the  management  of  road  infrastructure.  The \nMinistry  of  Highways  and  Road  Development  has  overall  responsibility  for  policies  and \nprograms  concerning  national  roads.  The  Road  Development  Authority  is  responsible  for \nplanning  and  managing  the  development  and  maintenance  of  national  roads.  Following  the \npassage of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution in 1987, responsibility for provincial roads \nwas devolved to provincial councils. The Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Councils \n(MLGPC) is the provincial councils' representative in the Cabinet, responsible for national-level \npolicy  and  legislation.  Within  provinces,  provincial  road  agencies  are  responsible  for  planning \nand  managing  the  development  and  maintenance  of  provincial  roads.  Several  different \nstructures  were  adopted  for  these  agencies,  including  creating  a  separate  road  department \n\n                                                 \n1   Class  A  roads  are  national  highways  connecting  different  provinces,  major  cities,  and  ports.  Class  B  roads  are \nnational  highways  within  a  province  connecting  major  urban  areas.  Class  C  roads  are  surfaced  provincial  roads \nand  major  feeder  roads  connecting  towns  and  villages.  Class  D  roads  are  other-surfaced  provincial  roads  and \nminor  feeder  roads  connecting  settlements  with  markets.  Class  E  roads  are  unsurfaced  or  gravel  local  roads, \nproviding access to specific locations. Unclassified roads include plantation, forest, and irrigation roads. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nunder the provincial council, assigning responsibilities to provincial engineering or public works \ndepartments, and establishing a separate road development authority.  \n \n6. \nIn  late  2005,  supported  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  World  Bank,  the \nRoad  Maintenance  Trust  Fund  was  established  to  finance  routine  and  periodic  road \nmaintenance.  Since  80%  of  traffic  volume  is  on  national  roads  in  Sri  Lanka,  however,  funds \nhave been mainly allocated for national roads. Currently, with World Bank assistance, the fund\u2019s \neffectiveness is being reviewed. Yet the need for provincial road maintenance remains urgent\u2014\nand as the responsibility to maintain provincial roads is with provincial councils, there is a need \nto find a mechanism for financing provincial road maintenance at the provincial level. ADB and \nthe World Bank have conducted coordinated policy dialogues on this matter. \n \n\n1. \n\nEastern Province \n\n7. \nThe  province  consists  of  three  districts:  Ampara,  Batticaloa,  and  Trincomalee.  Nearly \none  third  of  its  boundary  is  the  eastern  sea  coast  of  Sri  Lanka.  Trincomalee  has  a  natural  \ndeep-water harbor, the fifth largest in the world. Beaches were popular with tourists; however, \nover  the  past  two  decades,  they  have  also  witnessed  many  intermittent  armed  conflicts. \nTrincomalee  is  not  developed  other  than  for  flour  processing,  cement  manufacture,  and  oil \nstorage  facilities.  The  province\u2019s  economy  is  focused  on  agriculture,  animal  husbandry,  and \nfisheries. \n \n8. \nIts  population  is  estimated  at  1.46 million,  made  up  of  40.3%  Sri  Lankan  Tamil, 37.6% \nSri Lankan Moor, and 21.6% Sinhalese.2 Due to the conflict, Eastern Province was not included \nin  the  last  poverty  study.  However,  it  is  understood  that  its  poverty  is  among  the  worst  in  the \ncountry. Per capita income in 2007 was SLRs119,131 per year, or 66.6% of the national level. \nWhile  the  area  represents  15%  of  the  country,  its  gross  domestic  product  in  2007  was \nSLRs177,863, or 4.97% of the national gross domestic product. \n \n9. \nThe  road  network  includes  857  km  of  national  highways,  1,098  km  of  provincial  roads \n(classes  C  and  D),  4,838  km  of  rural  roads  (class  E),  and  3,412  km  of  other  roads.  The  road \ndensity is 1.02 km per km2, while the national road density is 1.60 km per km2. Most of its roads \nwere  severely  damaged  and  neglected  during  the  conflict.  About  30%  of  provincial  roads  are \ngravel  and  earth  roads.  Only  20%  are  in  good  condition.  Where  access  is  possible,  riding \nconditions are poor, vehicle speeds are low, and vehicle-operating costs are high.  \n\nThe Eastern Provincial Road Development Department (EPRDD) is responsible for the \n10. \nconstruction, maintenance, and administration of the provincial road network. It is headed by a \nprovincial  director  who  works  directly  under  the  authority  of  the  province\u2019s  Secretary  of  road \ndevelopment.  Key  personnel  under  the  provincial  director  include  a  deputy  director,  four  chief \nengineers,  a  chief  accountant,  an  administrative  officer,  and  other  support  staff.  Three  chief \nengineers are responsible for monitoring the works executed by respective executive engineers. \nOne  chief  engineer  is  responsible  for  planning,  design,  and  quality  control.  A  special  unit  for \nmachinery and equipment is kept for deployment within the province. \n\n11. \nSome  EPRDD  staff  members  were  involved  in  ADB-financed  projects,  including \nprovincial and rural road components of the ADB-funded Conflict-Affected Areas Rehabilitation \nProject,  Tsunami-Affected  Areas  Rebuilding  Project,  and  North  East  Community  Restoration \n\n                                                 \n2  Department of Census & Statistics. 2001 Census. \n\n \n\n\fand  Development  Project, 3 as  well  as  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA)-\nfunded Pro-Poor Eastern Infrastructure Development Project.4 \n \n12. \nIn  2007,  the  estimated  fleet  of  motorized  vehicles  in  Eastern  Province  was  92,091,  or \naround  4.1%  of  the  national  fleet.  Motorcycles  make  up  almost  70%  of  the  fleet.  In  2007, \nEastern Province developed procedures for collecting revenue from vehicle license fees. For the \nperiod January\u2013November 2008, this revenue was almost SLRs100 million. \n \nBudgetary  expenditure  for  provincial  roads  is  funded  by  the  Government,  and  has \n13. \nsteadily  increased:  SLRs159.0  million  in  2006,  SLRs193.1  million  in  2007,  and  SLRs215.0 \nmillion  in  2008.  The  actual  expenditures,  however,  were  only  SLRs97.1  million,  SLRs105.2 \nmillion, and SLRs70.3 million, respectively, due to unreleased funds. \n \n14. \nThere are around 130 interprovincial bus services per day, and 500 buses are operating \nwithin the province\u2014the lowest bus penetration in the country. There are 47 dedicated rural bus \nservices that are subsidized, providing important connections between rural and town centers. \nTwo-wheelers  and  hand  tractors  are  also  used  extensively,  as  are  small  trucks  and  vans. \nTrucking is deregulated, and rates are competitive. \n \n\n2. \n\nNorth Central Province \n\n15. \nNCP has two administrative districts, Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa, named after their \nrespective  capital  cities.  Anuradhapura  was  the  capital  of  Sri  Lanka  from  the  4th  century  BC \nuntil the beginning of the 11th century AD. The capital then moved east to Polonnaruwa, where \nit  stood  until  the  end  of the  13th  century  AD.  The  ruins  of  the  cities  have  been  designated  as \ncultural heritage sites and are immensely popular with tourists. \n \n16. \nThe province is considered poor and is sparsely populated, as the land tends to be dry \ntropical  woodland.  Having  more  than  10,000  water  reservoirs,  irrigated  paddy  fields  are  the \nlargest  employment  provider.  The  area  presently  contributes  over  20%  of  the  country's  paddy \nproduction,  in  addition  to  vegetables  and  animal  husbandry.  Its  share  of  the  national  gross \ndomestic  product  is  around  4%,  and  it  had  a  2007  per  capita  income  of  SLRs117,384,  which \nwas 65.7% of the national level and one of the lowest gross domestic product growth rates in \nthe country. The province is home to about 1.1 million people, of whom 17.5% exist below the \npoverty line as compared to 15.0% nationally. \n \nThe road network includes 1,141 km of national highways, about 1,951 km of provincial \n17. \nroads, 11,835 km of rural roads, and 1,173 km of other roads. Road density is 0.84 km per km2, \nfar below of the national average of 1.60 km per km2. About 22% of the provincial roads require \nreconstruction, 18% require rehabilitation, while 38% and 22% are in fair and good conditions, \nrespectively.  More  than  37%  are  gravel  or  earth  roads.  From  2003  to  2007,  the  vehicle  fleet \nincreased  at  an  average  annual  growth  rate  of  16.6%,  most  due  to  motorcycles  and  \nthree-wheelers.  \n\n                                                 \n3 ADB.  2003.

Japan. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nResponsibility  for  managing  provincial  roads  in  NCP  lies  with  the  North  Central \n18. \nProvincial  Road  Development  Authority  (NCPRDA),  which  is  headed  by  a  board  of  directors, \none of whom is appointed as the chairperson. The next in line is the general manager, who is \nresponsible  for  the  execution  of  NCPRDA\u2019s  work  program  and  administration.  There  are  two \ndeputy general managers for engineering and for financial and human resources development. \nThe deputy general manager (engineering) manages roadwork with the assistance of the three \nchief  engineers.  Out  of  these  three,  two  are  handle  operations  in  the  two  districts.  The  other \nchief  engineer  (planning,  design,  and  quality  control)  is  supported  by  another  four  executive \nengineers  for  planning,  design,  and  quality  control.  All  maintenance  and  improvement  work  is \ncontracted to private contractors. NCPRDA does not operate specific machinery but maintains a \nfairly good laboratory for quality control.   \n \nCapacity  building  was  provided  to  NCPRDA  through  the  ADB-funded  Road  Sector \n19. \nDevelopment  Project 5  (RSDP).  A  software  program  for  maintaining  a  road  inventory  and \ncondition database for provincial road networks was in place. However, road rehabilitation and \nmaintenance  have  not  been  conducted  regularly  due  to  the  inconsistency  and  inadequacy  of \navailable funds. Most are still handled on an ad-hoc basis. \n \n20. \nBudgetary  expenditures  for  provincial  roads  are  funded  by  the  Government,  which \ntotaled  SLRs365  million  in  2006,  SLRs425  million  in  2007,  and  SLRs325  million  in  2008.  On \naverage, actual expenditures are about 70% of the allocations. The low utilization is mostly due \nto unreleased allocations or delayed release during the later part of the year, making it difficult \nto complete all planned work programs. \n \nThe  Department  of  Motor  Traffic  collects  revenue  from  vehicle  registration  within  the \n21. \nprovince. Revenues related to road use are mainly from these fees, which were about SLRs90.0 \nmillion in 2006, SLRs118.0 million in 2007, and SLRs120.8 million in 2008. The relatively high \nincrease  in  2007  was  due  to  improvement  of  vehicle  registration  system  and  an  increase  in \nfees.  \n \n22. \nThe Road Passenger Transport Authority is responsible for regularizing the provision of \nomnibus transport and is authorized to issue route permits for intraprovincial buses. There are \nabout  652  private  omnibuses  and  262  state-owned  buses.  Other  passenger  vehicles  include \nschool  vans,  office  vans,  two-wheelers,  and  three-wheelers  or  taxis.  Trucking  is  deregulated \nwith competitive rates. Railways also provide services, but mostly for the transport of fuel and \ncement. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n23. \nIn Sri Lanka, high poverty levels are linked to lack of access to infrastructure; similarly, \npoor  infrastructure  constrains  growth.  Rural  enterprises  cite  transport  as  a  major  obstacle  to \nstarting or operating a business. Provincial roads provide essential connectivity, linking national \nroads,  which  connect  consumer  areas,  and  local  roads,  which  connect  rural  agricultural \nproduction  areas.  Provincial  roads  also  facilitate  essential  bus  services,  ensuring  access  to \neconomic opportunities and inclusive growth. In Eastern Province and NCP, therefore, improved \nprovincial  roads  and  resulting  benefits  will  help  balance  socioeconomic  disparities  within  the \nprovinces and keep up with national-level economic growth. \n\n                                                 \n5 ADB.  2002.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  and \nTechnical Assistance Grants to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Road Sector Development \nProject. Manila (Loan SRI-1986, for $56.5 million, approved on 19 December). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nDecentralization of Provincial Road Management \n\n1. \n \n24. \nIn accordance with the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, responsibility for managing \nthe  development  and  maintenance  of  provincial  roads  lies  with  provincial  councils.6 However, \ntechnical capabilities, training facilities, knowledge bases of codes and practices, and databases \nare  still  retained  at  the  central  Government  level.  As  a  result,  provincial-level  capacity  has \nlagged, especially in the newly established Provincial Council in Eastern Province.   \n \nADB  and  JICA  have  assisted  some  provincial  road  agencies  with  capacity  building  in \n25. \nplanning,  budgeting,  and  contract  management.  Therefore,  NCPRDA's  capacity  is  more \nadvanced  than  that  of  EPRDD.  Below  are  analyses  of  agencies\u2019  capacity  in  performing  their \nmandates  to  manage  provincial  road  networks,  including  (i)  planning  and  programming,  (ii) \nproject  preparation,  (iii)  procurement  and  contract  management,  and  (iv)  monitoring  and \nevaluation of program implementation. \n \n26. \nPlanning  and  Programming.  Provincial  road  agencies  are  to  develop  and  maintain  a \nroad  inventory  and  condition  database\u2014a  prerequisite  for  preparing  annual  or  rolling  road \nrehabilitation and maintenance programs along with associated budgets.   \n \n27. \nIn  NCP,  inventory,  road  condition  database,  and  road  maintenance  management \nsystems  are  in  place,  and  have  been  used  to  prepare  road  maintenance  budgets  for  2007 \nonward. Implementation of plans, however, has been constrained by a lack of funds. To ensure \nsustainability, \nto  be  updated,  a  \n3-year rolling plan developed, and more stable financing secured. \n \n28. \nIn Eastern Province, while the existing structure is reasonably sound from an operational \nperspective,  it  does  not  have  the  planning  capacity  to  fulfill  EPRDD's  mandate.  Although \nEPRDD has an inventory in place, no systematic road condition assessments are carried out for \nuse in the budget estimating process. Budgets are estimated based on a generalized scope of \nwork for important roads only as well as some indicative work for a certain number of km up to \nthe anticipated maximum amount of money approved from historical allocation. \n \nProject Preparation. Based on the work program and approved budget, provincial road \n29. \nagencies  are  to  identify  and  formulate  projects,  and  prepare  detailed  design  and  bidding \ndocuments. Both agencies have the capacity to prepare domestically funded projects, mainly for \nmaintenance. For road rehabilitation and reconstruction projects (mostly foreign-funded), project \npreparatory  work\u2014including  feasibility  studies,  detailed  design,  bidding  documents,  and \nprocurement  actions\u2014are  carried  out  with  the  significant  involvement  of  the  Government  (i.e., \nMLGPC).  However,  under  the  Project,  in  line  with  the  devolution  process,  the  agencies  have \nbeen involved throughout the preparation period.  \n \n30. \nin \nprocurement  and  contract  management  of  domestically  funded  projects.  For  externally  funded \nprojects, MLGPC has extensive experience in both procurement and contract management.  \n \n31. \nUnder  the  Project,  all  civil  works  contracts  have  been  procured  using  national \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  and  packaged  to  promote  provincial-level  procurement  and \n\nProcurement  and  Contract  Management.  Both  agencies  are  experienced \n\nthe  road  maintenance  management  system  needs \n\n                                                 \n6  An important milestone in the long-term solution to the conflict, the 13th Amendment to the Constitution attempts to \ndecentralize administration by devolution. It established nine provincial councils and granted them powers to plan, \nexecute, and manage selected functions. \n\n\f \n\n \n\ncontract  management.  To  strengthen  provincial  road  agencies\u2019  capacity  and  to  ensure  that \nADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  are  strictly  followed,  a \nnational procurement specialist has been provided to each agency throughout the procurement \nprocess, and an international procurement specialist has been fielded during the bid evaluation \nperiod. \n \n32. \nFor  engagement  of  project  implementation  consultants,  MLGPC  has  coordinated  the \nrecruitment, as it involves international firms. To ensure project ownership and accountability of \ncontract  administration,  each  province  will  have  a  separate  team  of  consultants  under  a \nseparate contract. \n \n33.  Monitoring and Evaluation of Program Implementation. This role is to be carried out \nby the planning, design, and quality control unit of the provincial road agencies. NCPRDA has \nstaffed  this  unit,  and  the  unit  head  (chief  engineer)  has  just  been  appointed.  In  EPRDD,  a \nsimilar unit has been recently established, and developing the capacity of this unit will be critical. \n \n\n2. \n\nRoad Financing \n\n34. \nThere is a serious imbalance between the decentralization of expenditures and revenues \nat the provincial level. The devolution design did not envision any significant revenue sharing, \nand  with  limited  assigned  revenues,  vertical  imbalances  have  been  addressed  solely  by  a \nsystem of provincial grants from the central Government.  \n \n35. \nCurrently,  of  the  total  financial  needs  for  both  recurrent  and  capital  expenditures,  the \nGovernment allocates more than 90% of all provincial council budgetary needs, with provincial \nrevenue  accounting  for  only  10%  (i.e.,  devolved  revenues).  Of  total  provincial  revenues,  \n20%\u201325%  is  earned  from  the  vehicle  license  fees.  Provincial  councils  do  not  have  specific \nguidelines for allocating funds to the road sector. \n \n36. \nIn general, road sector expenditures are funded from central Government funds, foreign \nor  external  funds,  and  provincial  revenues.  While  rehabilitation  of  provincial  roads  has  relied \nheavily  on  foreign-funded  projects,  the  existing  level  of  domestic  funding  is  insufficient  for \nprovincial road agencies to maintain their road networks. There is a need to increase the level of \nroad  budgets  and  to  assign  a  greater  amount  to  road  maintenance  based  on  road  conditions. \nProper  planning  needs  to  be  developed,  and  the  Government's  commitment  to  provide \nadequate financing for maintenance needs to be secured.  \n \n37. \nUnder  the  Project,  Eastern  Province  and  NCP  agreed  to  dedicate  their  vehicle  license \nfee revenues to road maintenance, which will be sufficient to finance routine maintenance and a \nportion  of  periodic  maintenance.  Funds  will  be  disbursed  in  such  a  way  to  meet  the  stable \nnetwork needs to avoid further deterioration of the network. To increase quality of construction \nand  efficiency  of  maintenance  work,  performance-based  road  rehabilitation  and  maintenance \ncontracts will be introduced under the Project.  \n \nTo secure periodic maintenance financing for provincial roads, the Government and both \n38. \nprovinces  agreed  that  at  least  70%  of  required  funds  for  periodic  maintenance  of  provincial \nroads  will  be  provided  to  the  provincial  councils  by  2012,  with  a  yearly  increase  of  10%  until \n100% of the requirement is reached. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3. \n\nPast and Proposed Institutional Capacity Program \n\nUnder  the  ADB-funded  Southern  Provincial  Roads  Improvement  Project7 (SPRIP),  an \n39. \ninstitutional development program was implemented in Southern Province to establish capacity \nfor  efficient  and  effective  management  of  its  provincial  road  network.  The  SPRIP  reorganized \nthe  Southern  Provincial  Road  Development  Authority  by  (i)  formulating  more  efficient  work \nprocedures,  and  (ii)  introducing  appropriate  modern  road  management  tools  and  information \nand communication technologies. Due to its success, the same approach had been replicated in \nfour more provinces (North Central, North Western, Uva, and Western) through the RSDP, and \nin  two  other  provinces  (Central  and  Sabaraghamuwa)  through  the  JICA-funded  Provincial \nRoads  Improvement  Project.  The  progress,  achievement,  and  lessons  of  the  institutional \ndevelopment  program  under  both  projects  were  assessed  as  summarized  in  Supplementary \nAppendix A.  \n \n40.  While  the  institutional  development  program  under  the  SPRIP  was  considered \nsuccessful, the same under the RSDP was considered only a moderate success. The success \nof the former was due to the program being dedicated to a single provincial road agency and the \nconsulting  team  being  based  at  that  office,  providing  hands-on  training  for  day-to-day  road \nnetwork  management  as  well  as  project  management.  Under  the  latter  project,  a  generic \nprogram  that  targeted  all  provinces  has  not  necessarily  delivered  the  desired  outcomes. \nMoreover, as the main consultant is based in Colombo at the MLGPC, the consultant had much \nless  direct  interaction  with  the  four  provincial  road  agencies,  resulting  in  less  effective \nassistance.   \n \nTo  support  the  devolution  process,  the  Project  will  continue  to  support  capacity \n41. \ndevelopment of provincial road agencies in Eastern Province and NCP through TA, taking into \nconsideration the different stages of development and capacity of each. With regard to project \nmanagement  capacity,  two  separate  consulting  teams  for  project  implementation  located  in \neach province will provide hands-on training to each agency. There will be no separate project \nmanagement  unit  for  the  Project,  but  its  functions  will  be  internalized  in  the  agency\u2019s \norganizational structures, so that skills can be retained.  \n \n\n4. \n\nExternal Assistance and Coordination \n\n42. \nSince  1980,  ADB  has  provided  12  loans,  totaling  $591  million,  for  the  road  sector, \nincluding multisector projects. The principal bilateral sources of external assistance have been \nthe People's Republic of China, France, Japan, Republic of Korea, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Spain, \nand  Sweden.  ADB  is  the  largest  provider  among  multilateral  development  institutions\u2014and  is \nthe  lead  development  partner\u2014followed  by  the  European  Union,  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme, and World Bank. Coordination among development partners in Sri Lanka has been \nstrong. The list of external assistance in the road sector is in Appendix 3. \n \n43. \nThe  Project  was  prepared  in  close  coordination  with  JICA  and  the  World  Bank.  The \nfeasibility study and detailed design of 2,400 km of provincial roads in all nine provinces were \nprovided  through  the  ongoing  ADB-funded  Road  Project  Preparatory  Facility. 8  Under  the \n\n                                                 \n7 ADB.  1997.

Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Technical \nAssistance Loan to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Road Project Preparatory Facility. Manila \n(Loan 2080-SRI, for $15 million, approved on 13 April). \n\n\f \n\n \n\nProject,  ADB  will  finance  improvement  of  provincial  roads  in  Eastern  Province  (Batticaloa  and \nTrincomalee districts) and NCP. The World Bank will finance improvement of provincial roads in \nEastern  Province  (Ampara  District)  and  Uva  Province.  JICA  will  finance  improvement  of \nprovincial roads in Central and Sabaragamuwa provinces and rural roads in Eastern Province. \nIn  summary,  three  major  development  partners  in  the  road  sector  are  cofinancing  the \nGovernment's program to develop road network in Sri Lanka. \n \n\n5. \n\nLessons Learned \n\nADB's  country  assistance  program  evaluation  in  2007 9  states  that  given  budgetary \n44. \nconstraints,  the  demand  for  government  counterpart  funds  for  externally  funded  projects \ncompetes  with  and  crowds  out  maintenance  funds.  The  overall  balance  among  maintenance \nand rehabilitation is sometimes overlooked. Another risk is the inadequate institutional capacity \nfor maintenance of roads by local authorities. These risks are manageable and can be mitigated \nwith measures to strengthen capacity and funding for maintenance. \n \nThis evaluation also identified key challenges relevant to the Project, including the risk of \n45. \nproject implementation in conflict-affected areas. As suggested, a conflict risk assessment and \nits  effects  on  project  implementation  have  been  carried  out.  In  accordance  with  its \nrecommendations, the roads to be improved are spread throughout the provinces and reach all \ncommunities. Selection of roads has been agreed with the Eastern Provincial Council and North \nCentral  Provincial  Council.  Civil  works  have  been  packaged  within  a  wide  range  of  national \ncontractor capacities. Moreover, since the Project will rehabilitate existing roads, the prospect of \nland acquisition has been minimized. \n \n46. \nfollowing lessons that have been addressed under the Project.  \n\nThe  SPRIP  was  rated  successful  in  its  project  completion  report,  and  includes  the \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nTo avoid continued deterioration of roads, time between project preparation and \nimplementation has been kept as short as possible. The detailed design of roads \nwas completed in January 2009, and procurement was started in March 2009.  \nRoads to be included in the Project have been selected taking into account local \nnetwork effects, including connection with other classes of roads.  \nThe  Government  has  assured  effective  and  consistent  budget  allocation  and \nexpenditure.  Coordination  with  relevant  utilities,  such  as  water,  electricity,  and \ntelecommunications, has occurred to avoid unnecessary delays as well as utility \nline work after roadwork is completed.  \nEnvironmental  clearance  for  each  road  has  been  obtained  from  the  relevant \nauthority.  Quarries  for  construction  material  have  been  identified,  and  their \nclearance is being processed.  \nA  project  performance  management  system  is  being  designed  through  close \nconsultation  and  workshops  with  stakeholders.  Surveys  had  been  conducted, \nand additional surveys and further monitoring will occur under the Project.  \nIn cooperation with the Institute for Construction Training and Development, local \ncontractors  have  been  trained  on  International  Federation  of  Consulting \nEngineers  conditions  of  contracts,  contract  management,  performance-based \nmaintenance  contracts,  and  in  ADB's  procurement  and  consultant  selection \nprocess.  Further  training  on  construction  planning  and  management  will  be \nprovided during implementation.  \n\n                                                 \n9 ADB. 2007. Country Assistance Program Evaluation for Sri Lanka Inclusive Development and Conflict Resolution: \n\nMajor Challenges in the Future. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nThe  previous  two  projects  (RSDP  and  SPRIP)  were  implemented  successfully  without \n47. \nmajor  delays.  Moreover,  all  civil  works  contracts  were  executed  by  national  contractors, \nresulting  in  a  stronger  contracting  industry.  Nevertheless,  as  more  responsibilities  of  project \nimplementation  are  given  to  the  provincial  level  under  the  Project,  there  is  a  risk  of  initial \nimplementation delays. This is being addressed by adopting a project implementation readiness \nfilter.  A  feasibility  study,  detailed  design,  and  bidding  documents  have  been  completed  under \nthe Road Project Preparatory Facility. Procurement specialists have been provided to assist the \nprovincial road agencies in conducting advance actions. Loan negotiations was held only when \nphase  1  procurement  has  been  substantially  completed.  Consultants  will  assist  throughout \nproject implementation, and a realistic project implementation period has been developed with \nallowances for the capacity-building process and unforeseen delays. \n \n\nGovernment Development Strategy and ADB's Country Strategy \n\n6. \n \n \n48. \nSri Lanka is on track to achieve the Millennium Development Goal for reducing poverty. \nHowever, the prolonged conflict have devastated much of the east and north, aggravating the \nalready high income and other social differentials between these two regions and the rest of the \ncountry.  The  Government\u2019s  goal  is  to  achieve  high  economic  growth  that  benefits  the  entire \npopulation  and  leads  to  the  social  development  of  the  entire  country.  To  achieve  this,  the \nGovernment\u2019s strategy\u2014entitled Mahinda Chinthana: Vision for a New Sri Lanka \u2013 A Ten Year \nHorizon  Development  Framework  2006\u20132016 10 \u2014focuses  on  strengthening  the  investment \nclimate,  including  road  network  improvement  and  socially  inclusive  and  regionally  balanced \ngrowth. \n \n 49. \nADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS)  2009\u20132011  recognizes  that  achieving  high \nand  equitable  growth  will  be  vital  to  reduce  poverty  further.  One  key  obstacle  to  growth  is  a \nserious  infrastructure  bottleneck,  especially  in  the  current  transport  network  that  provides \ninadequate  connectivity  between  global  and  domestic  markets  as  well  as  between  hinterland \nand economic centers.  \n \n50. \nThe Project will improve connectivity in the transport networks of two relatively poor and \nconflict-affected  provinces.  The  provision  of  improved  roads\u2014in  conjunction  with  a  range  of \nto  strengthen \nother  carefully  coordinated  measures  proposed \nadministrative  and  absorptive  capacity  in  poorer  regions\u2014will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction. \nThe  Project  will  improve  connectivity  to  neglected  areas,  supporting  socially  inclusive \ndevelopment, and reduce disparities in Sri Lanka; therefore, the Project is relevant to achieving \nthe objective of the CPS. \n \n\nthe  CPS,  designed \n\nin \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\n \nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n51. \nIn support of the CPS, the project impact will be an overall improvement of Sri Lanka\u2019s \ntransport system. Transport of goods and services will be enhanced, contributing to economic \ngrowth and community well being. The Project\u2019s immediate outcome will be the improved road \nnetwork and institutional capacity in Eastern Province and NCP. \n \n\n                                                 \n10 2006. Mahinda Chinthana: Vision for a New Sri Lanka \u2013 A Ten Year Horizon Development Framework 2006\u20132016. \n\nColombo. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n52. \n\nProject outputs are \n(i) \n\napproximately  370  km  of  provincial  roads  rehabilitated  and  improved,  and \nselected bridge links rehabilitated or replaced; \nenhanced  project  management  capability  of  EPRDD  and  NCPRDA,  achieving \nefficient project implementation; and  \nan improved EPRDD office. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n53. \nRoad Rehabilitation. About 150 km of roads in Eastern Province and 220 km of roads \nin NCP will be rehabilitated.11 The use of the existing road corridor will be maximized to achieve \nthe  optimal  combination  of  economy  and  desired  road  improvement  without  land  acquisition. \nDouble  bituminous  surface  treatment  will  be  applied.  Bridges  and  culverts  will  also  be \nrehabilitated  and  replaced.  The  technical  approach  and  design  standard  of  the  roads  are  in \nAppendix 4, and the list of contract packages is in Appendix 5. \n \nThe roads were selected from the long-list proposed by both provinces. The criteria for \n54. \nshort-listing the roads included the role of the road in connecting economic and social services \nand  national  highways,  traffic  volume,  road  conditions,  poverty  index,  and  the  importance  of \nroad  to  bus  services.  A  feasibility  study  was  then  conducted,  considering  (i)  engineering  and \ntraffic aspects, (ii) treatment options and cost estimates, (iii) social and environmental aspects, \nand (iv) economic internal rate of returns. The final list of roads then was validated in terms of \ndistribution fairness among different ethnic groups. \n \nProject  Management.  The Project will provide project implementation consultants and \n55. \nfinance  incremental  expenditures  for  successful  project  implementation.  The  consultants  will \nprovide on-the-job training with extensive hands-on technical and managerial skills to provincial \nroad agency staff in project and contract management. \n \n56. \nEPRDD  Office  Improvement.  While  a  capacity  development  TA  will  be  provided  to \nstrengthen the capacity of the provincial road agencies in managing the provincial road network, \nupgrading  the  EPRDD  office  and  relevant  equipment  will  be  required  and  will  be  provided  for \nunder the loan.  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nDevolution Process Support. Devolution of power in line with the 13th Amendment to \n57. \nthe Constitution is an important milestone in achieving a long-term solution of the conflict. The \ninstitutional and legal aspects related to devolution are assessed in Supplementary Appendix B. \nThe  Project  will  support  this  devolution  process  by  improving  provincial  capacity  and  by \nstrengthening provincial ownership of road network management. Toward institutional capacity, \na capacity development TA will be provided to strengthen provincial road agencies to carry out \ntheir main responsibility\u2014managing and maintaining the provincial road network efficiently and \neconomically.  EPRDD's  organizational  effectiveness  will  be  enhanced  by  improving  its \nmanagement structure, streamlining staff allocation, and modernizing basic office facilities and \nthe  management  information  system.  EPRDD  and  NCPRDA's  capacity  for  sustainable  road \nasset  management  will  be  improved  by  developing  and  implementing  systematic  steps  for \nmonitoring, planning, and programming procedures. \n\n                                                 \n11  \n\nIn Eastern Province, ADB will cover roads in Batticaloa and Trincomalee districts, totaling 150 km of roads, while \nthe World Bank covers 70 km of roads in Ampara District. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nTo increase ownership, more responsibilities of project preparation and implementation \n58. \nhave been given to provincial authorities. The Project has adopted a simple structure, allowing \nprovincial road agencies to concentrate on their core mandate, to improve and maintain assets, \nand  to  implement  the  Project  smoothly.  Both  provinces  have  roles  in  procurement,  project \nimplementation,  and  administration  of  imprest  accounts.  All  project  preparatory  works  have \nbeen  completed,  and  procurement  assistance  is  being  provided.  On-the-job  training  with \nextensive  hands-on  technical  and  managerial  skills  will  be  provided  to  EPRDD  and  NCPRDA \nstaff during project implementation.  \n \n59. \nConflict  Sensitivity. In line with the key operational guidelines provided in the CPS on \nworking in conflict-affected areas, the Project has been prepared emphasizing transparency and \ninvolving  stakeholders  and  beneficiaries.  A  conflict  awareness  assessment  was  carried  out \n(Appendix 6). As an integral part of the Government\u2019s Eastern Revival Plan,12 the Project seems \nto be universally welcome and viewed positively, and it is not perceived to benefit any one group \nat the expense of others. As the Project is intended to improve existing roads (and is creating no \nnew roads), it is expected that there will be no resettlement issues, and no land will be claimed \nfor the purposes of the Project.  \n \n60. \nCollaboration  among  Development  Partners.  Under  the  ADB-funded  Road  Project \nPreparatory  Facility,  a  feasibility  study  and  detailed  design  for  all  nine  provinces\u2019  provincial \nroads  were  prepared.  In  parallel,  the  three  partners  ADB,  JICA,  and  the  World  Bank  have \nagreed to support the Government's objective to develop the road network. A joint review during \nproject implementation will be explored. \n \nIn  Eastern  Province,  ADB,  JICA,  and  the  World  Bank  assistance  will  cover  the  whole \n61. \nprovince, benefitting all ethnic groups (Muslim, Sinhalese, and Tamil). The improved provincial \nroads will be connected to local roads financed by JICA; moreover, while ADB will provide TA \nfor  strengthening  EPRDD\u2019s  capacity  in  road  asset  management  and  procurement,  the  World \nBank  will  strengthen  capacity  in  safeguard  matters,  and  JICA  will  provide  training  in  road \nconstruction  works  to  Eastern  Province  laborers,  who  will  then  be  ready  to  be  hired  by \ncontractors.13 Under  the  Project,  civil  works  were  packaged  so  they  could  be  implemented  by \nboth local and national contractors, providing employment opportunities to local laborers during \nimplementation. All contracts will be implemented in two phases, with relatively a short gap, so \nthat they will benefit all communities simultaneously. \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n62. \nThe project investment cost is estimated at $78 million, including taxes and duties of $8 \nmillion (Table 1).  The detailed cost estimates by expenditure category and by financier are in \nAppendix 7.  \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n12  2007.

The  loan  will  have  an  amortization \nperiod of 32 years, including an 8-year grace period, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% \nper year during the grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter. \n \n64. \nAs  requested  by  the  Government,  the  loan  will finance  all  expenses,  or  almost  90%  of \nthe  project  cost,  and  the  Government  will  only  finance  taxes  and  duties.14 This  will  ease  the \nGovernment\u2019s  burden  to  provide  counterpart  funding.  It  is  also  consistent  with  the  CPS \napproach,  considering  a  difficult  macroeconomic  environment  and  the  focus  on  development \noutside  developed  Western  Province,  including  support  for  the  Government's  plan  to  develop \nEastern Province.

The \nimplementation \n65. \nimplementation arrangements have been agreed to by the Government and synchronized with \nJICA and the World Bank's project implementation arrangements.  \n \nThe Executing Agency for the Project is MLGPC, responsible for overall coordination of \n66. \nproject  implementation,  including  provision  of  policy  and  technical  guidance  and  interagency \ncoordination. The current project coordination unit of the RSDP and  Road Project Preparatory \nFacility will assist MLGPC in performing its role. The unit is led by a project coordinator, assisted \nby  a  chief  accountant,  an  office  engineer,  and  various  support  staff  members.  It  has  actively \nassisted  Eastern  Province  and  NCP  during  project  preparation  and  with  advance  actions  for \nprocurement and consultant selection. \n \nThe  implementing  agencies  (IAs)  are  EPRDD  for  Eastern  Province  and  NCPRDA  for \n67. \nNCP. The IAs will be responsible for project management, including (i) procurement, (ii) day-to-\nday  project  implementation,  (iii)  withdrawal  application  certification,  (iv)  progress  report \npreparation,  and  (v)  maintenance  of  project  accounts  and  completion  of  loan  financial  records \nfor auditing purposes.  \n \n68. \nFor  Eastern  Province,  the  IA  will  be  led  by  the  EPRDD  provincial  director,  assisted  by \nthe  chief  engineer  in  Trincomalee,  chief  engineer  in  Batticaloa,  chief  accountant,  office \nengineer, and various support staff members. For NCP, the IA will led by the NCPRDA general \nmanager,  assisted  by  chief  engineer  of  operation  1,  chief  engineer  of  operation  2,  chief \naccountant, office engineer, and various support staff members.  \n \nA  national  steering  committee  has  been  established  to  oversee  and  monitor  project \n69. \nimplementation as well as the adequacy of overall project funding and that for nonproject roads. \nIt is chaired by the MLGPC secretary and consists of chief secretaries of Eastern Province and \nNCP and representatives from EPRDD, Finance Commission, Ministry of Finance and Planning \n(External  Resource  and  National  Planning  departments),  Ministry  of  Highways  and  Road \nDevelopment,  NCPRDA,  and  project  coordination  unit.  The  steering  committee  will  meet  as \nrequired  but  at  least  quarterly.  When  and  as  necessary,  representatives  from  the  Central \nEnvironmental  Authority,  Geological  Survey  and  Mines  Bureau,  and  utilities  (electricity, \ntelecommunications, water, and drainage) will be invited.15  \n \n70. \nIn each province, a provincial coordination committee has been established, responsible \nfor  monitoring  project  implementation  at  the  provincial  level.  The  committee  is  chaired  by  the \nchief secretary of the province, with representation from EPRDD or NCPRDA and the respective \nproject implementation consultants (ex officio nonvoting).  The committees will conduct monthly \nmeetings.  As  and  when  necessary,  provincial  representatives  from  the  Central  Environmental \nAuthority,  Geological  Survey  and  Mines  Bureau,  and  utilities  (electricity,  telecommunications, \nwater, and drainage) will be invited.16  \n\n                                                 \n15  The committee will also cover the World Bank-funded project; therefore, the chief secretary of Uva Province, and \nUva-provincial  road  development  department  will  be  part  of  the  committee.  The  quarterly  meetings  will  be \nconducted jointly.  \n\n16  Similarly,  the  provincial  coordination  committee  in  Eastern  Province  will  also  cover  the  World  Bank-  and  \nJICA-funded  projects;  therefore,  their  project  implementation  consultants  will  also  be  part  of  the  committee  (ex \nofficio nonvoting). The monthly meeting will be conducted jointly. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n71. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  in  about  4  years,  reflecting  the  time  required  for \ncapacity  building  within  the  IAs  and  among  the  national  contractors,  with  support  from  the \nproject implementation consultants. Procurement of civil works will be done in two phases. It is \nexpected that the Project could be declared effective in October 2009, and will be completed by \n31 December 2013. A detailed project implementation schedule is in Appendix 9. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n72. \nAll  procurement  under  the  loan  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines.  Supply  contracts  will  be  procured  under  national  competitive  bidding \nprocedures if the contract values are $100,000\u2013$1,000,000; and shopping if less than $100,000.  \n \n73. \nAs  requested  by  the  Government,  for  civil  works,  national  competitive  bidding \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB  have  been  adopted.  Post-qualification  has  been  exercised  for \ncivil works contracts, with a bid period of 30 days, applying a single-stage two-envelope bidding \nprocedure. The use of these procedures is justified as the Project is located in a conflict-affected \narea, where foreign contractors are not likely to be interested in bidding. The works are simple \nand can be carried out by domestic contractors. The previous two projects (RSDP and SPRIP) \nalso  adopted  national  competitive  bidding  for  all  civil  works,  and  both  were  successfully \nimplemented without significant delay.  \n \n74. \nThe road and bridge civil works will be undertaken in 26 contract packages, ranging from \n$0.2 million to $3.4 million, and building works of two contract packages, valued at about $0.4 \nmillion  each.  Civil  works  are  packaged  based  on  their  geographical  location  and  convenience \nfor  contractors  to  mobilize  and  organize,  and  will  be  implemented  in  two  phases.  The \nprocurement plan is in Appendix 10. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n75. \nConsultants  will  be  recruited  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). IAs, assisted by MLGPC, will  hire consulting teams as \nproject implementation consultants separately, which will assume the role of the engineer for the \ncivil works contracts, respectively. The consultants will support IAs in implementing the Project, \nand  strengthen  IAs'  capacity  in  contract  management,  project  performance  monitoring,  and \nevaluation.  Consultants  will  be  selected  using  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedures, \nwith a 90:10 proportion of quality to cost. About 70 person-months of international consultants \nand 1,514 person-months of national consultants will be required. The outline terms of reference \nfor the consultants are in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Contracting \n\n76. \nADB  supports  the  Government\u2019s  initiative  to  take  advance  procurement  action  and  to \nprovide  necessary  resources  for  advance  action.  The  advance  action  was  approved  by \nManagement  on  29  January  2009.  The  Government  has  been  advised,  however,  that  support \nfor advance action does not commit ADB to finance the Project. No retroactive financing will be \nrequired.  Assessment  of  the  procurement  capacity  of  EPRDD  and  NCPRDA  was  conducted, \nand  procurement  specialists  have  been  fielded  to  provide  assistance  throughout  the \nprocurement process. \n  \n\n \n\n\fTo  monitor  progress,  a  detailed  procurement  schedule  was  developed  (Supplementary \n77. \nAppendix  D).  Phase  1  technical  bid  evaluation  report  has  been  approved  by  ADB  on  9  June \n2009.  Request  for  consultant  proposals  has  been  issued  on  26  June  2009.  Accordingly,  it  is \nexpected  that  phase  1  civil  works  contracts  and  consultant  contracts  could  be  awarded \nimmediately after loan becomes effective. \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n78. \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine the records and accounts of IAs and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other \nservice providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n79. \nEPRDD  and  NCPRDA's  governance  will  be  strengthened  under  this  Project.  Bidding \ndocuments  for  civil  works  under  the  Project  are  standardized  following  internationally \nharmonized documents. For project management and monitoring, a strict monitoring system will \nbe introduced. The project targets, progress, and achievements will be disclosed to the public at \nthe  IA  head  offices, construction sites,  and  their  websites. Procurement  specialists  have  been \nfielded to assist IAs in the procurement process.  \n \n80. \nEPRDD and NCPRDA have outsourced all road rehabilitation and maintenance work to \nthe  private  sector.  To  enhance  competition  and  capacity  of  the  construction  industry, \nprocurement  will  not  be  restricted  by  contractor  registration  rules.  Quality  and  availability  of \nconstruction  material  quarries,  especially  in  Eastern  Province,  are  being  assessed,  and  the \nfindings  will  be  made  available  to  all  contractors.  Training  is  provided  for  both  skilled  and \nunskilled  laborers  in  Eastern  Province,  under  which  a  database  of  local  laborers  will  be  made \navailable  to  contractors.  These  actions  will  help  increase  competition  between  contractors, \nincrease  work  quality,  and  reduce  costs.  For  the  Project,  ADB  procurement  procedures  will \nenhance \nfair  competition,  and  ADB  disbursement  procedures  and \nInternational  Federation  of  Consulting  Engineers-based  contract  management  will  mitigate \ncorruption during implementation. \n  \n\ntransparency  and \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n81. \nLoan  disbursements  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  the  agreed  detailed  arrangements.  An \nimprest  account  will  be  established  at  the  Central  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  with  MLGPC.  Initial \nadvances and the maximum amount to be deposited to the account will, in total, be equivalent \nto  the  estimated  eligible  expenditures  for  the  next  6  months  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount, \nwhichever  is  lower.  One  second-generation  imprest  account  (SGIA)  will  be  established  at  the  \nproject coordination unit of the  MLGPC. Two  SGIAs will be established and operated by chief \nsecretary  of  each  provincial  council,  opened  for  EPRDD  and  NCPRDA  at  state  banks \nacceptable  to  ADB.  The  initial  advances  of  SGIAs  will  be  the  estimated  expenditures  for  6 \nmonths or 10% of the loan amount to be financed through each SGIA, whichever is lower.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nThe  respective  chief  secretaries  will  be  responsible  for  project  implementation  through \n82. \nEPRDD  and  NCPRDA,  including  monthly  reconciliation  of  the  accounts  and  provision  of \nsupportive documents for withdrawal applications by MLGPC for liquidation or replenishment of \nthe  SGIAs.  The  project  coordination  unit,  EPRDD,  and  NCPRDA  have  sufficient  capacity  to \nadminister the accounts, and have adequate accounting and internal controls. The flow of funds \nis illustrated in Appendix 11. \n \n83. \nThe  imprest  accounts  will  be  established,  managed,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with \nADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook, and detailed arrangements agreed to by the Government \nand ADB. Statement of expenditure procedures will be used to reimburse, liquidate, or replenish \nthe imprest account for any individual payments not exceeding the equivalent of $100,000.  \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n84. \nEPRDD, MLGPC, and NCPRDA will maintain separate project records and accounts to \nidentify  the  financing  resources  received  and  expenditures  made  on  the  Project.  The  project \naccounts  and  related  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  in  accordance  with \nappropriate auditing standards consistently applied by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. \nThe audited reports and financial statements will be submitted to ADB not later than 6 months \nafter  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year.  The  imprest  accounts  and  statement  of  expenditure  will  be \naudited  as  part  of  the  regular  annual  audit.  The  auditor\u2019s  opinion  of  the  examination  of  the \nimprest  account  and  statement  of  expenditure  will  be  set  out  in  the  auditor\u2019s  report.  EPRDD, \nMLGPC,  and  NCPRDA  are  aware  of  ADB's  policy  on  delayed  submission  and  also  of  the \nimportance of satisfactory and acceptable audited reports. ADB reserves the right to verify the \nfinancial  accounts  of  EPRDD,  MLGPC,  and  NCPRDA  to  confirm  that  the  share  of  ADB's \nfinancing is used in accordance with ADB's policies and procedures. \n \n85. \nEPRDD and NCPRDA will separately prepare and submit to ADB (and copies provided \nto MLGPC) monthly progress reports in electronic form, containing basic data, implementation \nprogress,  major  issues  and  proposed  remedial  measures,  and  work  to  be  undertaken  in  the \nfollowing period. The monthly reports should be received by ADB within 15 days of the end of \nthe month. Every quarter, EPRDD and NCPRDA will submit more detailed reports to MLGPC, \nwhich  will  consolidate  the  report  and  submit  it  to  ADB.  In  addition  to  the  basic  information \nprovided  in  the  monthly  reports,  the  quarterly  reports  will  include  any  changes  to  the \nimplementation  schedule,  utilization  of  funds,  achievement  of  outputs  and  outcome,  and \ncompliance with loan covenants. The format and content of both monthly and quarterly reports \nwill be attached to the project administration memorandum to be agreed upon at the inception \nreview mission. \n \n86.  Within  3  months  of  project  completion,  in  collaboration  with  EPRDD  and  NCPRDA, \nMLGPC will submit to ADB a project completion report with a detailed evaluation of the project \ndesign,  costs,  contractor  and  consultant  performance,  social  and  economic  impact,  economic \nrate of return, and other details as requested by ADB. The project performance indicators will be \ncompared with those of the control roads.  \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n87. \nThe  achievement  of  the  project  performance  targets  will  be  assessed  following  the \ndesign  and  monitoring  framework.  EPRDD  and  NCPRDA,  assisted  by  project  implementation \nconsultants,  will  establish  a  project  performance  management  system.  Indicators  to  be \nmonitored include (i) traffic volume, (ii) bus and freight transport fares, (iii) travel time or riding \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nspeed, (iv) vehicle-operating costs, (v) surface roughness, and (vi) road accidents. In addition, \nsocioeconomic  secondary  data  will  be  obtained  at  the  divisional  secretary  level,  including  (i) \nnumber  of  businesses,  (ii)  household  income,  (iii)  vehicle  ownership,  (iv)  unemployment  rate, \nand (v) land value. These indicators will be monitored before and after construction, both on the \nproject  roads  and  on  some  control  roads.  In  addition,  every  year  during  the  project  period, \nEPRDD and NCPRDA will also monitor the (i) road maintenance budget, (ii) ratio of staff\u2013km of \nprovincial  road,  and  (iii)  road  maintenance  cost  per  km.  Achievement  of  the  institutional \ndevelopment  program  will  also  be  monitored.  For  civil  works,  progress  will  be  monitored  and \nreported  monthly  by  the  project  implementation  consultants.  Project  impact  on  the  conflict \nsituation, if any, will be monitored, and any negative impact will be remedied immediately. The \nproject beneficiaries' satisfaction will be surveyed during and after project implementation. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n88. \nA project inception mission will be fielded soon after the loan agreements for the Project \nare signed; thereafter, regular reviews will follow at least annually. As necessary, special loan \nadministration missions and a midterm review mission will be fielded, under which any changes \nin  scope  or  implementation  arrangement  may  be  required  to  ensure  achievement  of  project \nobjectives.  EPRDD,  MLGPC,  and  NCPRDA  will  monitor  project  implementation  in  accordance \nwith  the  schedule  and  time-bound  milestones,  and  keep  ADB  informed  of  any  significant \ndeviations that may result in the milestones not being met.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nIn  conjunction  with  the  Project,  a  capacity  development  TA  will  be  provided  to  (i) \n89. \nmodernize  EPRDD's  office,  (ii)  improve  business  processes,  and  (iii)  manage  road  assets. \nLessons learned from the previous institutional development program in NCPRDA will be taken \ninto  consideration.  As  the  TA  implementation  is  expected  to  be  relatively  simple,  the  TA  falls \nunder category B. The TA is estimated to cost $950,000, of which ADB will finance $800,000 on \na grant basis from the ADB TA funding program (TASF-IV resources). Counterpart staff for the \nTA will be the EPRDD provincial director, NCPRDA general manager, chief engineer of planning \nand monitoring in both provinces, and planning division of both provinces. \n \n90. \nThe TA will provide required consultant inputs and necessary equipment and facility for \nthe purpose of road asset management. Upgrading the EPRDD office will be financed under the \nLoan. Individual consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants.  Disbursements  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook.17 International consulting inputs of 22 person-months and 14 person-\nmonths  of  national consulting inputs  will be  required.  The TA  will  be  implemented  from  March \n2010  to  February  2012.  The  Government  will  provide  office  space.  The  details  of  the  TA, \nincluding the terms of reference, are in Appendix 12.  \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nOverall,  the  Project  will  contribute  to  the  improvement  of  the  road  sector  in  Eastern \n91. \nProvince  and  NCP  by  improving  transport  efficiency  and  expanding  access  to  economic \nopportunities  and  public  services.  The  beneficiaries  will  be  people,  companies,  government \nagencies,  and  nongovernment  agencies  that  use  project  road  transport  services  directly  and \nindirectly. Communities served by the project roads will benefit from improved, lower-cost, and \n\n                                                 \n17 ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook. Manila. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nfaster  transport  services,  and  thereby  obtain  improved  access  to  economic  opportunities  and \nsocial  services.  Transport  operators  carrying  both  passengers  and  freight  will  benefit  from \nimproved  roads  in  terms  of  lower  vehicle-operating  costs,  time-savings,  improved  road  safety, \nand  thereby,  increased  productivity.  Government  and  nongovernment  agencies  served  by  the \nproject roads will improve their service delivery due to improved transport efficiency. \n \nA. \n\nTechnical Aspect \n\nThe Project will improve about 14% of the provincial road network in Eastern Province \n92. \nand  11%  in  NCP.  Road  asset  management  and  maintenance  will  be  strengthened.  As  the \nGovernment  relies  heavily  on  external  financing  for  road  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction,  the \nProject will have significant impact in the provincial road network in both provinces.  \n \nB. \n\nInstitutional Aspect \n\n93. \nThe  Project  will  improve  management  of  the  provincial  road  network  through  an \ninstitutional development program, assisted by the capacity development TA. The enhancement \nof  the  provincial  road  agencies\u2019  capacity  for  road  asset  management  will  improve  road \nadministration  governance  and  accountability,  and  create  an  environment  that  encourages \nefficiency and competition. \n \nC. \n\nEconomic Aspect \n\n94. \nThe overall improvement of the provincial road network will increase transport efficiency. \nThis  will  contribute  to  growth  of  a  wide  range  of  economic  activities  that  use  road  transport \nservices. Without the improvements, traffic will incur high transport operating costs due to poor \nroad conditions. With the improvements, these costs will be reduced. \n \nAn economic analysis was carried out using the standard practice, comparing the road \n95. \nlifecycle  and  user  costs  with  and  without  the  Project.  Based  on  the  analysis,  the  proposed \nimprovements were considered economically viable, with an estimated overall economic internal \nrate  of  return  of  28.3%.  A  sensitivity  analysis  was  also  carried  out  considering  the  potential \nadverse  scenario\u2014increasing  project  costs  and  reducing  benefits.  The  resulting  economic \ninternal rates of return remained above the 12% threshold. The summary of economic analysis \nis in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \nThe financial internal rate of return calculation was not required as the Project does not \n96. \ngenerate  revenue.  Public  expenditure  review  of  provincial  roads  in  both  provinces  was \ncompleted (Supplementary Appendix F). Assessments were carried out with regard to EPRDD \nand NCPRDA's capacity in planning, budgeting, internal control and audit arrangements, as well \nas  financial  management  and  reporting  management.  Both  follow  the  government  accounting \nstandard  and  general  accounting  principals.  They  have  the  financial  management  capacity  to \neffectively implement the Project. \n \nD. \n\nEnvironmental Aspect \n\n97. \nThe  Project  is  a  class  B  project  in  accordance  with  ADB  environmental  assessment \nrequirements.  Initial  environmental  examinations  were  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nEnvironment Policy (2002) and environmental guidelines. No significant adverse environmental \nimpacts  are  expected.  The  project  road  improvement  proposals  have  been  approved  by  the \nCentral  Environmental  Authority,  and  its  recommendations  have  been  incorporated  in  the \n\n \n\n\fenvironmental  management  plan  as  well  as  bidding  documents.  The  summary  initial \nenvironmental examinations are in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \nE. \n\nSocial Aspect \n\n98. \nThe inadequate condition of transport services prevents the poor from gaining access to \neconomic opportunities and social services. The Project will improve the road network, thereby \nalleviating  this  constraint.  The  project  roads  serve  the  poorest  provinces  in  the  country\u2014\ncommunities  located  away  from  the  centers  of  economic  activities.  Improvement  of  the  road \nnetwork will open the communities up to a range of new opportunities; increase availability and \nfrequency of transport service; and improve access to markets, employment opportunities, and \nsocial services. They will facilitate movement of goods and people, and will improve livelihood \nactivities of the communities along the roads, including returned internally displaced people. \n \n99. \nFrom  experience  of  a  previous  project  (SPRIP),  road  improvements  will  lead  to  more \nfrequent and reliable bus services, and all passengers benefit from reduced travel time. Faster \ntravel,  at  lower  cost,  allows  workers  to  find  better  work  opportunities  and  to  earn  more  (e.g., \nthrough overtime). Both producers and consumers of agricultural produce will also benefit from \nimproved freight services. \n \n100.  The  roads  included  in  the  Project  were  selected  upon  consideration  of  their  role  in \nproviding connectivity to communities, the poverty situation, and coverage of transport services. \nEach  road  plays  a  significant  role  by  connecting  to  local  feeder  roads,  resulting  in  a  wider \nspread of indirect benefits. The benefits are not confined to any specific ethnic or other social \ngroup. Local laborers will have employment opportunities during implementation. \n \n101.  No new roads will be developed, and the road improvement work is within the existing  \nright-of-way.  Nevertheless,  in  the  event  of  unforeseen  requirement  of  land  acquisition  during \nimplementation, resettlement plans will be prepared following the relevant national laws as well \nas ADB's Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), in accordance with the approved resettlement \nframework (Appendix 13).  \n \n102.  A  grievances  redress  committee  will  be  established  within  each  divisional  secretary, \nchaired by the respective divisional secretary, chief engineer, community-level mediation board, \nand community leader. The aim is to resolve issues quickly, amicably, transparently, and out of \ncourts to facilitate project implementation. The resident engineers of the project implementation \nconsultants  will  maintain  a  complaint  register  and  forward  these  to  the  grievance  redress \ncommittee. The details of the grievances and the reasons that led to acceptance or rejection of \nthe particular grievances will be recorded. \n \n103.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in  Appendix  14.  To  enable \ncommunities  in  the  project  area  to  maximize  benefits  of  the  Project,  a  proposal  for  promoting \ngender-responsive access to road rehabilitation-related opportunities under the Project is being \ndeveloped, to be financed on grant basis from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction.  \n \nF. \n\nRisks \n\n104.  The  major  risks  for  the  Project  are  (i)  implementation  delays,  (ii)  delay  in  releasing \ncounterpart  funds,  (iii)  inadequate  post-project  road  maintenance,  and  (iv)  conflict.  The  risk  of \ninitial  delays  has  been  mitigated  through  ensuring  project  implementation  readiness  during \nprocessing.  Feasibility  study,  detailed  design,  and  procurement  assistance  were  provided \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nthrough the TA loan for the Road Project Preparatory Facility. Advance actions are being taken \nwith the objective of awarding contracts immediately following the loan signing. The risk of delay \nin  releasing  counterpart  funds  has  been  mitigated  by  providing  90%  financing  under  the  loan, \nleaving the Government with financing only tax and duties.  \n \n105.  Performance-based  maintenance  after  completion  will  be  included  in  the  civil  works \ncontracts  to  secure  maintenance  of  the  project  roads.  Through  the  capacity  development  TA \nproject,  EPRDD  and  NCPRDA  road  asset  management  systems  will  be  strengthened  for \nobjective  planning  and  budgeting.  A  3-year  rolling  road  maintenance  plan  will  be  developed. \nVehicle license fee revenues will be dedicated to routine maintenance. Budgets will be gradually \nincreased to meet maintenance requirements, and EPRDD and NCPRDA's monitoring systems \nfor implementation will minimize the risk of underutilizing these budgets. \n \n106.  There  are  general  risks  associated  with  communal  tension  and  sensitivities,  history, \npolitical uncertainty, return of displaced persons, and considerable security staff presence. Also, \nan unforeseen requirement of land acquisition may emerge during implementation, for which a \nresettlement  plan  will  then  need  to  be  prepared.  The  Project  is  not  expected  to  contribute  to \nsocial  tensions,  as  the  beneficial  outcomes  of  the  Project\u2014with  the  JICA-  and  World  \nBank-financed  projects\u2014are  shared  equitably  among  the  major  ethnic  groups  and  across  the \ntarget  area.  The  Project  can  potentially  make  a  positive  contribution  to  the  rebuilding  of  the \ninfrastructure in post-conflict-affected areas. \n \n107.  On security, because the east and north have been taken over fully by the Government, \na  serious  threat  is  less  likely.  While  it  is  possible  that  some  events  could  affect  project \nimplementation,  it  is  highly  unlikely  that  there  will  be  any  direct  threats  to  the  Project.  All \ncommunities are likely to see the Project as part of the overall improvement of living conditions \nand the creation of new livelihood opportunities. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n108. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n109.  Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation. The Government will ensure that: \n\nEPRDD  and  NCPRDA  will  maintain  the  project  roads  to  a  proper  standard  and \nthe  benefits  of  the  rehabilitated  roads  will  be  realized  over  their  expected \nlifetimes;  \nEPC and NCPC will commit all revenues from vehicle license fees to routine road \nmaintenance in their respective provinces; \nprovincial  road  investment  plans  for  2012\u20132014,  including  road  maintenance \nplans, will be prepared and completed by 30 September 2011; \ncommencing  in  fiscal  year  2012,  at  least  70%  of  the  required  periodic \nmaintenance financing of the provincial roads, based on the investment plan, will \nbe made available to EPC and NCPC and will be increased by 10% annually until \n100% of the required funds is reached; and \nEPC  and  NCPC  will  release  annual  allocated  funds  for  road  maintenance  and \nrehabilitation on a timely basis. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n110.  Project  Management. The Government, through EPC and NCPC, will provide EPRDD \nand NCPRDA adequate staff, resources, and facilities to implement the Project. \n \n\n \n\n\f111.  Environment. The Government will ensure that EPRDD and NCPRDA will \n\n112.  Construction Labor. EPRDD and NCPRDA will ensure that contractors will \n\nthe  Project \n\nimplement,  and  operate \n\ndesign, \nEnvironment Policy and the Government\u2019s environmental policy and regulations; \nimplement mitigation measures identified in the initial environmental examination \nreports in a timely and efficient manner; and \nsubmit  to  ADB  semiannual  reports  on  the  implementation  of  the  environmental \nmanagement plans. \n \n\nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \n\nprovide  appropriate  information  to  construction  workers  on  the  risks  of  sexually \ntransmitted infections and HIV/AIDS;  \nprovide  safe  and  healthy  working  conditions,  including  appropriate  sanitation \nfacilities for female workers;  \ncomply with all applicable labor laws, including equal pay for equal work, no child \nlabor,  and  provision  of  appropriate  facilities  for  children  of  the  construction \nworkers at construction campsites; and \nprovide equal opportunities for women and men in the construction activities. \n \n\nthe  Project  will  make  every  effort  to  avoid  land  acquisition  or  involuntary \nresettlement;  \nin the event that any land acquisition or resettlement becomes necessary or any \npotential impact on indigenous peoples is identified, a suitable resettlement plan \nwill be drawn up in accordance with the resettlement framework; in consultation \nwith  the  affected  peoples;  with  the  approval  of  ADB;  in  compliance  with  the \napplicable  national \nInvoluntary \nResettlement Policy and Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998); and implemented \nin accordance with its terms; and \na grievances redress mechanism will be established within 3 months after date of \nloan effectiveness to redress any project-related concerns raised by project road \nusers and communities along the project roads. \n\nregulations,  policies,  and  ADB\u2019s \n\nlaws, \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i)  \n\n(ii)  \n\n(iii)  \n\n \n\n113.

Trincomalee  has  a  natural  deepwater \nharbour, the fifth largest in the world. However, it has been developed only for flour processing, \ncement  manufacture,  and  oil  storage  facilities.  The  beaches  of  Eastern  Province  are  popular \nwith  tourists,  but  current  limited  access  constrains  tourism  development.  The  economy  relies \nmainly on agriculture, animal husbandry, and fisheries.   \n\n2. \nThe  province  had  an  estimated  population  of  1.46  million  in  2007.  Life  in  Eastern \nProvince has been subject to disruptions due to intermittent armed conflicts in the area over the \nlast two decades. Due to the conflict situation, the province was not included in the last poverty \nstudy, however, poverty in the province is among the worst in the country. Per capita income in \n2007 for the province was SLRs119,131 per year, or 66.6% of national per capita income. While \nthe  area  represents  15%  area  of  the  country,  its  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  2007  was \nSLRs177,863, or 4.97% of the national GDP. \n \n\n1. \n\nProvincial Road Network and Traffic Volume \n\n3. \nThe  province\u2019s  road  network  includes  857  kilometers  (km)  of  national  highways,  \n1,098 km of provincial roads, 4,838 km of rural roads, and 3,412 km of other roads. The road \ndensity is 1.02 km/square kilometre (km2), while the national road density is 1.5 km/km2. About \n30% of provincial roads are gravel and earth; only 20% are in good condition. About 65% are in \npoor  or  very  poor  condition,  requiring  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction.  Where  access  is \npossible, riding conditions are poor, vehicle speeds low, and vehicle-operating costs high.  \n\nIn 2007, the estimated fleet of motorized vehicles in Eastern Province was 92,091; this \n4. \naccounted  for  4.1%  of  the  total  fleet  in  Sri  Lanka.  From  2003  to  2007,  the  vehicle  fleet  in  the \nprovince increased at an average annual growth rate of 8.5%. However this growth was mostly \ndue  to  motorcycles  and  three-wheelers.  The  typical  average  speed  on  the  provincial  road \nnetwork is 10 km/hour. \n \n\n2. \n\nProvincial Road Asset Management \n\nThe Eastern Provincial Road Development Department (EPRDD) is responsible for the \n5. \nconstruction, maintenance, and administration of the provincial road network. It is headed by a \nprovincial  director  who  works  directly  under  the  authority  of  the  province's  secretary  of  road \ndevelopment.  The  provincial  director  is  assisted  by  a  deputy  director,  four  chief  engineers,  a \nchief  accountant,  an  administrative  officer,  and  other  support  staff.  Four  executive  engineers \nreport to the respective chief engineer in the three districts. \n\n6. \nEPRDD\u2019s  capacity  for  core  processes  requires  strengthening  and  reorganizing, \nespecially  in  the  areas  of  policy  making,  planning,  and  programming.  It  has  not  developed  a \nproper mechanism for regular road condition assessment, which is required to develop annual \ndevelopment  and  budgetary  plans.  The  road  conditions  were  assessed  based  on  information \nprovided by EPRDD field officers and complaints made by the public. Only a road inventory is \ncurrently available. \n \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n25 \n\n3. \n\nRoad Transport Regulation and Industry \n\n7. \nThe provincial commissioner of motor traffic, under the chief secretary, administers the \nmotor vehicle fleet. The National Transport Commission Act regulates omnibus transport within \nthe province and provides powers to district government agents within the province.   \n\n8. \nAbout 500 buses are operating within the province. Bus penetration is among the lowest \nin  the  country  at  278  buses  per  million  people;  the  national  average  is  around  800  buses  per \nmillion.  Forty-seven  dedicated  rural  bus  services  are  subsidized;  payments  are  made  on \ncertification of delivery and attainment of standards monitored by a local user committee. These \nprovide important connections between rural and town centers within the province.  \n\nNo regulatory provisions are in place for other vehicles operating within the province for \n9. \nfee or reward. Two-wheeler or hand tractors are used extensively, as are small trucks and vans. \nTrucking  is  deregulated  and  independent  small-scale  operators  provide  vehicles  ranging  from  \n2  ton  to  multiaxle  container  flat  beds.  Rates  are  competitive.  The  railway  provides  one  mixed \ngoods trains each to Trincomalee and Batticaloa, mostly used for the transport of flour, fuel, and \ncement. About 72% of households have a bicycle.  \n \n\n4. \n\nProvincial Road Expenditure and Revenue \n\n10. \nRoad  sector  expenditure  in  Eastern  Province  is  mainly  funded  from  the  central \nGovernment, foreign funds, and provincial revenues. Of these, the major source of funding for \nEPRDD  is  the  Block  Grant  and  Province  Specific  Development  Grant  (PSDG);  the  central \nGovernment allocates both through the provincial budget.  \n \n\nTable A2.1: Utilization of Road Capital Funds \n\n \n\n \nSource \nProvince Specific \nDevelopment Grants \u2013 \nProvincial Roads \nSource: Eastern Provincial Road Development Department. \n\nAllocation \nExpenditure \nUtilization (%) \n\n2004\n42.4\n40.0\n94.3\n\nRs Million \n2006\n116.6\n56.2\n48.2\n\n2005\n100.7\n75.3\n74.8\n\n2007 \n170.8 \n85.4 \n50.0 \n\n2008 Oct.\n175.0\n53.1\n30.3\n\n11. \nEPRDD  was  not  able  to  fully  utilize  the  PSDG  or  meet  the  criteria  based  on  matching \ngrants  during  2004\u20132008.  This  is  largely  because  the  allocations  were  not  released  to  the \nprovincial  council  or  were  released  only  during  the  latter  part  of  the  year,  thus  making \ncompletion of all the planned work programs difficult.  \n\n12. \nEPRDD executes routine maintenance work on the provincial road network and operates \nferry services by using the Block Grant received from the Treasury. Allocations for maintenance \nare  irregular,  and  expenditure  utilization  is  inconsistent.  Utilization  varies  sharply  from  year  to \nyear with a low of 50% in 2005 and a high of 96.5% in 2006.  \n \n\n \nSource \nBlock Grant: Road \nMaintenance Component \n\n \n\nTable A2.2: Utilization of Road Maintenance Funds \nRs Million \n2006 \n42.4\n40.9\n96.5\n\nAllocation \nExpenditure \nUtilization (%) \n\n2004 \n31.8\n31.7\n99.7\n\n2005 \n31.8\n15.9\n50.0\n\n2007 \n22.3 \n19.8 \n88.8 \n\n2008 Oct. \n40.0\n17.2\n43.0\n\nSource: Eastern Provincial Road Development Department. \n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n26 \n \n\nB. \n\nNorth Central Province \n\n13. \nNorth  Central  Province  (NCP)  has  two  administrative  districts:  Anuradhapura  and \nPolonnaruwa,  named  after  their  capital  cities.  Both  cities  have  an  ancient  history  with \nAnuradhapura dating to the 4th century BC and Polonnaruwa from the 11th to 13th century AD. \nThe  ruins  of  these  cities  are  designated  as  cultural  heritage  sites  and  are  immensely  popular \nwith international and local tourists.  \n\nThe  province  is  located  in  the  low-country  dry  zone;  flat  terrain  prevails  across  most \n14. \nparts  of  the  province  and  the  land  tends  to  be  dry  tropical  woodlands.  NCP  has  more  than \n10,000  tanks,  or  small  water  reservoirs,  which  sometimes  interconnect  to  comprise  one \ncontinuous water reservoir system. The Mahaweli River Development Scheme irrigates a large \narea of dry woodlands now contributing to more than 20% of paddy production in the country. \nMore  than  75,000  families  have  settled  in  new  townships  in  the  area  during  the  last  two \ndecades.  \n\nThe province had an estimated population of 1.1 million in 2007, or 103 people/km2, the \n15. \nlowest  population  density  in  the  country.  It  also  has  the  largest  land  area  at  10,531  km2.  The \narea  presently  contributes  more  than  20%  of  the  country's  paddy  production,  in  addition  to \nvegetables  and  animal  husbandry.  Its  share  of  the  national  GDP  is  around  4%;  per  capita \nincome in 2007 was SLRs117,384, which was 65.7% of the national level, and it has one of the \nlowest  GDP  growth  rates.  Approximately  245,000  people  (17.5%)  live  below  the  poverty  line \ncompared with 15% nationally.  \n \n\n1. \n\nProvincial Road Network and Traffic Volume \n\n16. \nNCP\u2019s  road  network  includes  1,141  km  of  national  highways,  1,951  km  of  provincial \nroads, 11,835 km of rural roads, and 1,173 km of other roads. Road density is 0.84 km/km2, far \nbelow the national average of 1.5 km/km2. About 22% of provincial roads require reconstruction, \n18% require rehabilitation, 38% are in fair condition, and 22% in good condition. The provincial \nroad  network  comprises  741.5  km  of  gravel-surfaced  roads  and  1,230.5  km  of  metalled  and \ntarred roads. The network has 84 bridges and 944 culverts and other road-related assets. The \nmajority  of  provincial  roads  are  single  lane  of  2\u20134  meters.  Most  provincial  roads  provide  an \nimportant  link  between  national  roads  connecting  consumer  areas  and  local  roads  connecting \nrural agricultural production areas. They are an essential component of the provision of rural\u2013\nurban linkages. Most such routes support bus service. As the road network is the main transport \nmode  in  the  province,  it  needs  to  be  improved  to  balance  disparities  within  the  province  and \nkeep up with national economic growth. \n\n17. \nIn  2007,  NCP  had  a  fleet  of  about  104,810  motorized  vehicles,  accounting  for  4.7%  of \nthe total fleet in Sri Lanka. From 2003 to 2007, the vehicle fleet in NCP increased at an average \nannual  rate  of  16.6%;  most  of  this  growth  was  from  motorcycles  and  three-wheelers.  On \nprovincial  roads,  traffic  volume  generally  ranges  from  500  to  1,000  vehicles  per  day.  Four-\nwheeled  or  larger  vehicles  typically  make  up  30%  of  traffic.  Average  speeds  on  the  provincial \nroad network are 20 km/hr.  \n \n\n2. \n\nProvincial Road Asset Management \n\nThe North Central Provincial Roads Development Authority (NCPRDA) is responsible for \n18. \nthe construction, maintenance, and administration of the provincial road network. It is headed by \na  board  of  directors;  one  member  is  appointed  as  the  chairperson.  The  general  manager  is \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\nresponsible  for  execution  of  the  work  program  and  administration.  Two  deputy  general \nmanagers are responsible for engineering and for financial and human resource development. \nThe deputy general manager (engineering) deals with operation functions of road works with the \nassistance  of  three  chief  engineers:  two  handle  operations  in  the  four  divisions  under  an \nexecutive engineer. The other chief engineer (planning, design, and quality control) is supported \nby four executive engineers for planning, design, and quality control works.  \n\n19. \nBusiness  procedures  have  improved  with  the  establishment  of  NCPRDA,  according  to \nproposals made under the Institutional Development Program of the Road Sector Development \nProject. Since NCPRDA has a board of management, it is authorized to take certain decisions \nregarding procurement and biding procedures, quality control, assets management, and project \nmanagement of approved works programs. A software program for maintaining a road inventory \nand condition database for provincial road network is in place. \n\n20. \nNCPRDA  has  a  reasonably  well-equipped  quality  control  laboratory.  They  have  staff \nincluding  a  chief  engineer  and  an  executive  engineer  for  quality  control.  The  Road  Sector \nDevelopment  Project  provides  some  laboratory  equipment.  However,  NCPRDA  needs  to \ncontinue  regular  road  condition  assessment  and  updating  of  its  database,  which  will  give \nobjective information on maintenance and rehabilitation priorities. \n \n\n3. \n\nRoad Transport Regulation and Industry \n\n21. \nThe  Central  Province  Road  Passenger  Transport  Authority  was  set  up  by  statute  to \nregularize the provision of omnibus transport together with the Department of Motor Traffic, and \nto  collect  revenue  licenses  of  the  vehicles  registered  within  the  province.  About  1,100  buses \nprovide  public  transport  within  NCP.  The  56  dedicated  rural  bus  services  are  subsidized  with \npayment made on certification of delivery and attainment of standards monitored by a local user \ncommittee.  \n\n22. \nOther vehicles operating within the province for fee or reward such as school vans, office \nvans, and three-wheelers or taxis are regulated by Act No. 3 of 2006 and by Gazette No. 1518 \nof  2007.  Trucking  is  deregulated  and  rates  are  competitive.  The  railway  provides  two  goods \ntrains mostly used for transport of fuel and cement.  \n\n23. \nThe  Provincial  Motor  Traffic  Department  issues  annual  revenue  licenses  for  motor \nvehicles  registered  to  addresses  within  the  province  and  collects  such  revenues.  Bicycles  are \nthe most common vehicle; 80.1% of households possess a bicycle.  \n \n\n4. \n\nProvincial Roads Expenditure and Revenue \n\nRoad  sector  expenditure  in  NCP  is  funded  from  central  Government  funds,  foreign \n24. \nfunds,  and  provincial  revenue.  Of  these,  the  major  source  of  funding  is  the  Block  Grant  and \nPSDG,  which  the  central  Government  allocates  through  the  provincial  budget.  Being  an \nauthority, NCPRDA is able to collect revenue for certain services such as for reinstatement of \nroad  damage  by  utility  agencies.  NCP  collected  SLRs148  million  (about  22%  of  total  income) \nfrom  annual  vehicle  revenue  license  fees.  This  income  is  obtained  by  the  Treasury  and \nreallocated under general expenditure to different ministries through the budget.  \n\nCapital  expenditure  for  provincial  roads  such  as  improvement  and  rehabilitation  are \n25. \nfunded through the PSDG on a work program submitted by NCPRDA and as agreed to by the \nFinance Commission. NCPRDA was not able to fully utilize the PSDG during 2004\u20132008. This \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n28 \n \n\nlargely resulted because the funds were not released to the provincial council or were released \nonly during the latter part of the year.  \n \n\nTable A2.3: Utilization of Road Capital Funds \n\nSource \n\nProvincial Specific \nDevelopment Grants \u2013 \nProvincial Roads \n\nAllocation \nExpenditure \nUtilization (%) \n\n2004 \n140.0\n112.5\n80.4\n\n2005 \n230.0\n170.2\n74.0\n\nRs Million \n2006 \n285.0 \n192.8 \n67.6 \n\n2007 \n375.0 \n170.0 \n45.3 \n\n2008 Oct. \n250.0\n160.0\n64.0\n\nSource: North Central Provincial Road Development Authority. \n \n26.  Maintenance  of  roads  is  funded  by  the  Block  Grant  received  from  the  central \nGovernment.  No  regular  allocations  were  made  for  maintenance  during  2004\u20132007.  The \nutilization of the Block Grant varies sharply from year to year with a low of 31.8% in 2007 and a \nhigh of 92.3% in 2006. Even though release of the funds is not cited as a reason unlike the case \nof capital expenditure, it is charged that most of the due funds reach NCPRDA only during the \nlatter part of the year making execution of all annual plans difficult before the end of year.  \n \n\nTable A2.4: Utilization of Road Maintenance Funds \n\nSource \n\nBlock Grant-Road \nMaintenance Component \n\nAllocation

AND TECHNICAL APPROACH \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n31 \n\n \n\n \n \nA. \n\nDesign Criteria \n\n1. \nDesign Standards and Guidelines. The Project consists of class C and D roads within \nthe  provincial  road  network.  The  following  design  standards  and  guidelines,  established  in \nconsultation  with  the  Road  Development  Authority  (RDA)  and  provincial  road  agency  officials, \nare applied: \n \n\nCross  section:  (a)  Road  Design  Manual  and  Bridge  Design  Manual\u2014RDA's \nstandard;  (b)  AASHTO\u2014Geometric  Design  of  Highways  and  Streets  5th  edition \n(2004); (c) TRL\u2014Overseas Road Note 6, A Guide to Geometric Design (1988), \nand (d) Austroads\u2014Rural Road Design (2003). \n\nBridges:  RDA's  Sri  Lanka  Bridge Design  Manual  of  1997,  based  on  the  British \nStandards Code of Practice for Bridge Design (BS5400:1990). \n\nPavement:  (a)  Transport  Research  Laboratory\u2019s  Road  Note  31,  4th  Edition \n(TRL-RN31), basis of RDA's pavement design process;  (b) AASHTO Pavement \nDesign Guide, and (c) design life for new pavements: 10-year life with provision \nfor overlays during or at the end of that period to extend the life to 15\u201320 years. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(iv) \n\nDrainage: RDA's standards incorporating relevant standards from AASHTO and \nthe British Standard Design Manual for Roads and Bridges. \n\n \n2. \nPavement  Treatment. Existing road pavement consists of either bituminous surface or \nunsealed gravel. Many roads have mixed sections of bituminous and gravel. Some sections of \nbituminous  pavements  have  deteriorated  as  gravel.  Double  bituminous  surface  treatment \n(DBST) will be applied to all projects roads. \n \n3. \nCross  Section.  Road  cross  sections  vary  depending  on  projected  traffic  volume, \ngeometric  condition,  and  terrain.  In  general,  the  cross  section  consists  of  carriageway  \n4.5\u20136.5  meters  (m),  shoulder  1.0\u20131.5  m  each  side,  with  drainage  and  berm  as  required. \nSidewalks (typically 1.2 m wide) for bridges are considered on a case-by-case basis, depending \non bridge length, location, and pedestrian and traffic volume. Use of the existing road corridor \n(existing  road  cross  section  and  provision  for  utilities)  is  maximized  to  achieve  the  optimal \ncombination of economy and desired road improvement without land acquisition. \n \n4. \nAlignment  and  Traffic  Facilities.  In  general,  the  proposed  improvements  follow  the \nexisting horizontal and vertical alignment. The only minor changes are applied to the horizontal \nalignment  for  very  short  sections  to  enhance  road  safety,  to  ease  the  radius  of  curves,  or \nminimize  blind  spots.  The  road  safety  aspects  relate  mostly  to  localized  sections  of  the  road \nalignments.  In  densely  populated  areas,  roads,  bridges,  and  associated  sidewalks  are  made \naccessible for all, including the disabled. \n \n5. \nRoad  Safety.  The  road  safety  aspects  are  related  mostly  to  localized  sections  of  the \nalignments.  Based  on  the  road  safety  inspections,  carried  out  on  all  roads  during  the  field \nevaluation,  the  detailed  design,  wherever  possible,  incorporates  improvements  to  road  width \nand alignment, including installing precautionary speed signs to slow down for oncoming curves \nor low speed areas. \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n6. \nDrainage. To minimize local flooding or ponding, side drains are reconstructed to direct \nsurface  flows  away  from  road  pavements  and  linked  to  streams  or  watercourses.  For  existing \ndrainage  structures  (retained  or  repaired),  the  waterways  are  restored  by  removing  settled \nmaterials and debris.  \n \n7. \nBridges.  Improvements  comprise  repairing  and  or  replacing  existing  bridge  structures, \nincluding  structural  renovation  of  substructure  and  superstructure  elements  together  with \ninstallation or  repair  of  guardrails  and  improvement  of  causeways  and  vented  drifts.  The  work \ninvolves  five  major  existing  bridges  with  overall  length  greater  than  20  m  and  three  major \nbridges  comprising  steel  frame  or  composite  plate  girder  construction.  Materials  and \nconstruction  methods  are  in  accordance  with  Technical  Specifications,  Part  1  Standard \nSpecification  for  Construction  and  Maintenance  of  Roads  and  Bridges  1989  (Sri  Lanka), \nmodified to suit project requirements. \n \nB. \n\nProvince-Specific Improvement Design \n\n8. \nEastern Province.

Road \nimprovements  in  Eastern  Province  and  its  adjacent  North  Central  Province  (NCP)  are  badly \nneeded  to  support  economic  and  social  development.  Such  infrastructure  improvements  also \nappear to be welcomed by all communities in both provinces, as long as they are perceived to \nbe equitably distributed geographically and benefit all communities (both in terms of generating \nemployment and facilitating commerce and access to markets and services). The project team \nhas engaged in several consultations to ensure stakeholder participation and acceptance. While \nunder  the  Project,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  finance  the  improvement  of \nprovincial  roads  in  two  districts  of  Eastern  Province,  namely  Batticaloa  and  Trincomalee,  the \nWorld  Bank  will  cover  Ampara,  the  remaining  district.  More  broadly,  nationally,  the  Project  is \nclosely  coordinated  with  similar  projects  of  both  the  World  Bank  and  the  Japan  International \nCooperation  Agency \nto  ensure  national  conflict  sensitivity  of  overall  provincial  road \nimprovement. \n \nA. \n \n2. \nEastern  Province  experienced  some  of  the  worst  violence  in  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  decades-long \nconflict, although the situation in the province has stabilized since the Sri Lankan Government \nliberated the east from control by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in July 2007. Sri \nLanka\u2019s  Eastern  Province  is  unique in  its  demographics:  Tamils  account  for  about  40%  of  the \ntotal  population,  Moslems  account  for  38%,  and  Sinhalese  about  22%.  However,  the  balance \nbetween  the  three  communities  varies  significantly  over  Eastern  Province\u2019s  three  districts: \nTrincomalee (46% Moslem, 29% Tamil, 25% Sinhalese), Batticaloa (25% Moslem, 75% Tamil, \nless than 1% Sinhalese), and Ampara (44% Moslem, 18% Tamil, 37% Sinhalese). \n \nElections  to  the  Eastern  Provincial  Council  were  held  on  10  May  2008,  and  the  first \n3. \nsession  of  the  Eastern  Provincial  Council  took  place  in  Trincomalee  on  4  June  2008. \nDevelopment  in  Eastern  Province  is  a  high  priority  for  the  national  Government.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  3-year  Eastern  Revival  development  plan  focuses  on  resettlement  of  internally \ndisplaced persons, revitalizing the regional economy, improving infrastructure, supporting social \nrehabilitation  and  improved  housing,  and  rebuilding  public  institutions.  The  plan  is  seen  as \ncritical to the long-term stability of the province (and, indeed, of the country as a whole), to gain \nsupport of the Tamil and Moslem communities who form a majority in the region, and to prevent \na return to armed conflict. While much activity is under way to develop the economy and rebuild \nthe infrastructure of Eastern Province, reconciliation among the communities in this post-conflict \nperiod will inevitably require time. \n \nIn NCP, the population is more than 90% Sinhalese, less than 2% Tamil, and 5%\u201310% \n4. \nMoslem.  NCP  has  experienced  sporadic  violence  over  the  years,  mainly  because  it  borders \nNorthern and Eastern Provinces, which have been the main focus of the conflict with the LTTE. \nFor  the  past  two  decades,  development  in  NCP  has  been  constrained  by  the  province\u2019s \nproximity to the conflict. \n \n5. \nThe Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy and conflict sensitivity \nguidelines. Nationally, it balances development in conflict-affected regions with development in \nother  parts  of  the  country,  both  directly  through  ADB-supported  activities  and  through \ncoordination  with  the  support  of  other  key  development  partners.  Secondly,  ADB  has  taken \nsteps to ensure equity in the spread of benefits and opportunities created by the Project (across \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nSecurity Situation \n\nboth communal and geographic lines). ADB has coordinated provincial road improvement plans \nwith those of the World Bank and the Japan International Cooperation Agency to ensure wider \ncoverage of such improvements. Also, ADB has coordinated with other development partners in \ncomplementary  training  and  capacity-building  activities  to  strengthen  road  agencies  and \ncontractors,  as  well  as  develop  skills  to  assist  local  labor  to  participate  actively  in  project \nimplementation. \n \nB. \n \n6. \nGovernment plans to normalize security in the province are under way, and the number \nof military- and police-based checkpoints in Trincomalee and Batticaloa is being reduced. The \npresence of security in the provinces is expected to decrease over time, especially following the \nrecent  military  victory  over  the  LTTE  in  the  north.  This  will  positively  affect  commerce  and \neconomic  development  in  Eastern  Province.  While  the  presence  of  paramilitary  groups  has \nbeen  a  cause  of  concern  and  tension  in  Eastern  Province,  the  Government  is  moving  ahead \nwith plans to disarm and/or integrate armed groups into the police and military. \n \n7. \nPeople  seem  to  be  relieved  that  the  situation  is  relatively  stable,  but  uncertainty  (and, \ntherefore,  apprehension)  about  the  future  remains.  Some  of  the  underlying  factors  causing \ntensions in Eastern Province are still present, however, the trend on the security front has been \npositive.  \n \n\n8. \nThe scenarios for the near future of Eastern Province are varied, and, while some events \ncould affect project implementation at some point, direct threats to the Project are not likely. All \ncommunities are likely to see the Project as part of the overall improvement of living conditions \nand the creation of new livelihood opportunities. \n \n9. \nAs  the  security  situation  in  the  Northern  Province  normalizes,  when  the  A9  (the  main \nnorth\u2013south  highway)  is  fully  opened,  and  as  development  plans  move  steadily  forward  in  the \nnorth, then NCP should benefit. \n \nC. \n\nProject Context \n\n \n\n10. \nBecause the Project is intended to improve existing provincial roads (and is creating no \nnew ones), it does not involve any resettlement issues; and no land is to be claimed for it. This \nis important as land issues have often been a key factor behind the conflict. \n \n11. \nThe  roads  to  be  improved  are  based  on  a  list  submitted  to  ADB  by  NCP  and  Eastern \nProvince. In the case of Eastern Province, the selection of roads and the rationale and criteria \nused in their selection was discussed with the Provincial Council following its election. \n \n12.  While  disputes  over  issues  such  as  land  and  water  surrounding  some  development \nprojects  in  Eastern  Province  have  led  to  tensions  between  communities,  road  development \nprojects  seem  to  be  universally  welcome  and  viewed  positively,  as  long  as  they  are  not \nperceived to benefit any one group at the expense of others. \n \n13. \nAs  the  Project  is  implemented,  ADB  will  be  mindful  of  equity  in  the  schedule  on  which \nimprovements  are  made.  The  Project  has  been  designed  in  ways  that  will  benefit  all \ncommunities  reasonably  equally  (or  at  least  will  not  favor  some  at  the  perceived  expense  of \nothers), but the implementation is another dimension of the Project that ADB will monitor.  \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n37\n\nConclusion \n\n \nD. \n \n14. \nEastern  Province  is  the  most  complex  region  of  Sri  Lanka,  with  a  history  of  communal \ntension, violence, displacement (and return of internally displaced people), and land disputes. At \npresent, any development partner should be aware of the general risks associated with historic \ntensions. Conflict sensitivity considerations are essential for projects in Eastern Province in this \npost-conflict  period.  However,  road  projects,  as  long  as  they  are  implemented  with  an \nawareness of the prevailing sensitivities among the communities, are not likely to be a great risk \n(certainly less so than projects in some other sectors). Furthermore, the economic situation in \nNCP is likely to improve, and better provincial roads will be a significant factor. \n\n\fDETAILED COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($ Million) \n\n \nTotal Cost\n\n \nADB\n\n \nGovernment \n\nADB\n(%)\n\nGovernment Cost Share\n\n3\n8\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n7\n \n\ni\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nItem \nA.

The Project is designed to use only the existing right-of-way (ROW), about 7\u20138 meters. \nAll rehabilitation components related to roads and bridges such as the carriage way, pavement, \nand drainage facilities will be within the existing ROW. The consultant engineers and engineers \nof  provincial  road  agencies  of  each province  jointly  conducted  field  assessments  to  determine \nroad  rehabilitation  needs  and  possible  permanent  and  temporary  land  acquisition  and  other \nresettlement  impacts  of  selected  roads.  The  assessment  process  involved  measuring  the \nexisting  ROW  and  pavement  widths; \ntaking \nphotographs;  and  measuring  bridge  dimensions  including  span  length,  deck  width,  and  water \nlevel at bridge sites. In the absence of recent land survey drawings and maps prepared by the \nprovincial road agency or survey department indicating the existing ROW and road boundaries \nfor  each  road,  consultant  engineers  and  the  staff  of  provincial  road  agencies  determined \nwhether the existing road corridor of each road is adequate to meet rehabilitation requirements \nof  selected  roads  and  bridges.  In  the  case  of  bridges,  the  Project  will  not  increase  the \ncarriageway  width.  However,  some  bridges  that  are  unsafe  and  cannot  be  repaired  will  be \nreplaced with new bridges. Based on the information available from the engineers' assessments \nand  using \ntheir  guidance,  resettlement  specialists  carried  out  sample  surveys,  rapid \nassessments  based  on  field  observations,  walk-through  surveys  and  discussions  with  local \naffected people. \n \n2. \nAlthough  the  project  feasibility  study  (July  2008)  and  detailed  engineering  study \n(February  2009)  indicate  that  no  land  acquisition  is  required  for  the  purposes  of  the  Project, \nexact actual permanent and temporary impacts from the rehabilitation works will be known only \nduring project implementation. The rehabilitation works could have some impacts on lands and \nbuildings  adjacent  to  the  boundary  walls,  drainages,  and  canals.  Moreover,  some  land \nacquisition might be required for the construction of new bridges. The common feature of rural \nroads  is  that  pavements,  shoulders,  and  side  drains  are  very  narrow  or  nonexistent  in  some \nroad  sections  so  that  the  implementing  agencies  may  decide  to  acquire  minimum  land  for \nproper  rehabilitation  works.  Services  relocation  such  as  shifting  of  telephone  and  electricity \ntransmission  lines  may  require  land  acquisition.  Some  road  sections  in  semi-urban  and  urban \nareas  may  require  widening  and  realignment  to  ensure  road  safety  and  smooth  traffic  flow.  In \nsuch  cases,  the  project  implementing  agencies  will  formulate  short  resettlement  plans  and \nsubmit  them  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  review  and  approval  before  any \nconstruction work in the road section is started. The potential number of households or the land \narea acquired in such a situation would be small based on field assessments.  \n \n3.  \nThis  resettlement  framework  was  formulated  to  ensure  that  if  land  acquisition \n(permanent  or  temporary),  physical  relocation,  and  other  impacts  are  identified  during  project \nimplementation,  appropriate  compensation  and  relocation  programs  will  be  prepared  and \nimplemented  to  meet  Sri  Lankan  laws,  National  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (2001),  and \nADB's Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) requirement.           \n \n \n \n \n\n\f(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n52 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nPolicy Framework and Entitlements \n\nB. \n \n4. \nThe  policy  framework  and  entitlements  specific  to  the  Project  are  based  on  the \nrequirements  of  the  Government  of  Sri  Lanka,  principally  the  Land  Acquisition  Act  (1950  and \nrevised in 1979) and the National Involuntary Resettlement Policy, and also ADB\u2019s Involuntary \nResettlement Policy. The policy principles adopted for the Project include the following:  \n\nAvoid, minimize, and mitigate negative land acquisition and resettlement impacts \nby reviewing alternatives for the Project.  \n\nIf involuntary resettlement is unavoidable, displaced people should be assisted to \nreestablish themselves and improve their quality of life.  \n\nGender  quality  and  equity  should  be  ensured  and  adhered  to  throughout  the \npolicy.  \n\nAffected  people  should  be  fully  involved  in  the  selection  of  relocation  sites, \nlivelihood  compensation,  and  development  options  at  the  earliest  opportunity; \ncash  compensation  will  be  used  since  the  Project  would  require  only  a  small \namount of land, if any.  \n\nCash compensation at replacement cost will be paid for any privately owned strip \nof land before commencement of construction works. \n\nCompensation for structures and other assets should be based on replacement \ncost 1  including  transaction  costs,  and  should  be  paid  promptly  before  the \ncommencement of construction works.  \n\nLand  acquisition,  compensation,  and  relocation,  if  required,  should  be  planned \nand implemented with full participation of the provincial and local authorities and \nthe affected people.  \n\n(viii)  Affected  people  who  do  not  have  document  title  to  land  are  eligible  for \n\ncompensation as stated in the entitlement matrix.  \n\nVulnerable groups affected by the Project should be identified and provided with \nappropriate assistance to substantially improve their living standards.  \n\nThe  Government  should  bear  full  costs  of  land  acquisition,  compensation, \nrelocation, and improvement of living standards of affected vulnerable groups. \n\n \nPeople  affected  by  the  Project  will  be  identified  and  categorized  in  each  entitlement \n5. \nmatrix of the subproject short resettlement plan to provide  various types of compensation and \nresettlement assistance that will help in the restoration of their livelihoods, at least, to preproject \nstandards.  The  matrix  in  Table  A13  shows  broad  categories  of  properties  affected  and \nentitlements.  \n \n6.  \nThe main categories of potential impacts include (i) loss of land, (ii) boundary walls and \nfences  to  be  reconstructed,  (iii)  residential  and/or  commercial  structures  affected  (fully  or \npartially),  (iv)  services  relocation,  and  (v)  land  used  for  alternate  structures  as  the  bridges  for \npedestrians during the construction of new bridges. \n\n                                                 \n1  Replacement cost means the cost of replacement of lost assets and income. If land, it means the cost of buying \nreplacement  land  near  the  lost  land  with  equal  productive  potential  plus  the  cost  of  preparing  the  land  to  levels \nsimilar to those of the affected land and cost of any registration and transfer taxes. If structures, it means current \nmarket value of building materials, required labor without deduction for depreciation and/or salvageable materials. \nFor crops and trees, it will be based on economic production, age, and type. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n53 \n\nType of Losses \n\nTemporarily affected \nland (during \nconstruction) \nregardless of land \nownership  \nPermanent loss of \nland (with land title \nand/or ownership \nrecords) \n\nLoss of crops and \ntrees by cultivators \nregardless of the land \nownership \n\nPermanent loss of \nstructures and \nimmovable assets by \nowners (regardless of \nthe land title) \nPhysical \ndisplacement \n\nLoss of structures and \nimmovable assets by \nowners  \n\nRestoration of cultural \nand/or community \nstructures \n\nTable A13: Entitlement Matrix \n\nEntitlement \n\nImplementation Issues \n\nRental payment during the temporary use of \naffected person\u2019s land \n\nCash compensation at replacement cost will be \napplied. \n\n \n\nCash compensation at replacement cost. If sown or \nstanding crops are damaged or uprooted, the owner \nof the affected crops will be compensated in cash \nfor the loss of unharvested crops, at the mature \ncrop value to be assessed on the basis of current \nmarket rates. \nCompensation for loss of fruit trees at replacement \ncost is based on the present income and crop-\nbearing capacity. \nCompensation for structures and/or assets at full \nreplacement costs without deduction for \ndepreciation and/or salvageable materials. The cost \nwill include transportation and labor costs. \n\nCompensation at replacement cost, or  \nresettlement support to rebuild the house and other \nstructures \nIf income or livelihood affected, appropriate and \nsufficient assistance to improve or at least or \nrestore income and livelihood  \nCash compensation for structures at full \nreplacement costs without depreciation  \n\nComplete restoration work or cash compensation \nfor rehabilitation and/or rebuilding of affected \ncommon property resources and cultural structures \nand installations  \n\nThe land will be restored to \nits previous or better \nquality. \n\nPayment will be made at \nthe divisional secretariat as \nsoon as the Ministry of \nFinance approves the \nproposal for payment.  \nThe trees and crops are \nidentified and listed by the \nGrama Niladaris. The trees \nare valued by specialized \nagencies such as the \nCoconut Development \nBoard, Rubber Research \nInstitute, and divisional \nsecretaries. \nIf the affected person belong \nto a vulnerable group \nalternative location to live \nwill be provided. \n\nThe implementing agencies \nwill be responsible to find \nsuitable land for a house \nplot.  \n\nOwners of the affected \nstructures will be allowed to \ntake the salvageable \nmaterials  \nTo be paid to the formal or \nlocally recognized patrons \nand/or user group leaders. \n\nProcedures  \n\n \nC. \n \n7. \nFor  each  road  to  be  rehabilitated  or  bridge  to  be  rebuilt,  the  implementing  agency  will \nascertain  actual  resettlement  impacts  including  land  acquisition  requirements  and  relocation \ncost estimates. The following checklist will be helpful to identify resettlement impacts: \n \n\nWill the rehabilitation works require any land acquisition? \n\n(i) \n(ii)  Who owns the land and who uses the land? \n(iii) \n\nIf private land, how many owners and/or users (tenants and/or sharecroppers) \nare affected? \nIf the affected land is state land, are there any encroachers or squatters? \n\n(iv) \n(v)  Will any houses, structures, trees, and crops be affected? \n(vi)  Will any households and commercial structures need to be physically replaced? \n(vii)  Will indigenous people, ethnic minorities, and/or poorest groups be affected?   \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n8. \n\nIn preparing a resettlement plan, the following procedures must be followed: \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nCarry out consultations with various stakeholders to obtain their advice to avoid \nor minimize impacts and to identify the needs and preferences of those affected. \nUndertake  census  (100%  coverage),  asset  inventory,  detailed  measurement \nsurveys, and a socioeconomic survey of a sample population.  \nAnalyze  data  to  identify  different  categories  of  affected  people  based  on  the \ndegree and scale of impacts of the subproject.  \nFormulate  a  time-bound  schedule  for  implementation,  procedures  for  grievance \nredress, monitoring and evaluation procedures, and budget. \nPrepare  a  draft  short  resettlement  plan  following  the  entitlements  matrix.  If  new \ncategories  of  affected  people  and  types  of  losses  are  identified,  these \nentitlements  will  be  included  in  the  resettlement  plan  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy. \nTranslate  into  local  languages  and  discuss  the  draft  resettlement  plan  during \nconsultation  and  public  meetings  for  comments.  Incorporate  comments  and \nsuggestions in the final resettlement plan and disclose it to the affected people. \nSubmit the resettlement plan to ADB for review and concurrence. The approved \nresettlement plan will be implemented before the award of construction contracts.  \n\nImplementation Arrangements, Consultation, and Grievance Mechanisms \n\n \nD. \n \n9. \nThe implementing agencies (IAs) are Eastern Provincial Road Development Department \nand  North  Central  Provincial  Road  Development  Authority.  Ministry  of  Local  Government  and \nProvincial Councils will be responsible for overall coordination of the Project through its project \ncoordination unit. A national resettlement specialist will be recruited as necessary. \n  \n10. \nGrievances pertaining to resettlement impacts will be handled by the grievances redress \ncommittee  established  under  the  chairperson  of  the  divisional  secretary  in  each  divisional \nsecretary  area  with  the  assistance  of  the  Grama  Niladhari  (rural  officers)  and  community \nmediation board in villages and IAs. \n \nResettlement  plans  will  be  disclosed  through  the  IAs'  field  offices  and  local  Grama \n11. \nNiladhari offices.

Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n\nSri Lanka is on track to achieve the Millennium Development Goal for reducing poverty. However, conflicts that \nbegan  in  1983  and  the  tsunami  in  2004  have  devastated  much  of  the  north  and  east  of  the  country.  This  has \naggravated  the  already  high  income  and  other  social  indicator  differentials  between  these  two  regions  and  the \nrest of the country. The goal of the Government\u2019s national development plan is to achieve high economic growth \nthat benefits the entire population and leads to the social development of the country. To achieve this goal, the \nGovernment\u2019s  strategy.  Mahinda  Chinthana\u2013Sri  Lanka  (adopted  in  2007)  focuses  on  (i)  strengthening  the \ninvestment  climate,  and  (ii)  achieving  socially  inclusive  and  regionally  balanced  growth.  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership  strategy  2009\u20132011  recognizes  that  achieving  high  and  equitable  growth  will  be  vital  to  reduce \npoverty  further.  One  of  the  key  obstacles  to  growth  that  the  country  partnership  strategy  identifies  is  a  serious \ninfrastructure  bottleneck,  especially  the  current  transport  network  that  does  not  provide  adequate  connectivity \nbetween global and domestic markets.  \n\nThe  Project  will  improve  connectivity  in  the  transport  networks  of  two  relatively  poor  and  conflict-affected \nprovinces: Eastern Province and North Central Province (NCP). The provision of improved roads\u2014in conjunction \nwith a range of other carefully coordinated measures proposed in the country partnership strategy and designed \nto strengthen administrative and absorptive capacity in the poorer regions\u2014will contribute to poverty reduction by \nencouraging  farmers  to  diversify  their  incomes  by  selling  higher-value  products  or  providing  labor  in  nearby \nmarkets. Road network improvements will increase agricultural productivity by improving the supply of key inputs \nsuch as seeds, fertilizers, and technical services. By reducing local travel costs and travel times, the Project will \nfacilitate regular and timely attendance at schools, faster and more regular access to health centers, as well as \neasier access to local government departments and other service providers, thereby further stimulating the kinds \nof investments that will strengthen regional development. \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1.    Key  Issues.  In  2006,  Sri  Lanka  ranked  104th  of  179  countries  according  to  the  United  Nations'  human \ndevelopment  index  (HDI).  Similarly,  of  the  157  countries  with  both  HDI  and  gender-related  development  index \nvalues, Sri Lanka ranks 92nd.a The national poverty incidence in Sri Lanka has remained static at around 22% \nsince the 1990s. Poverty reduction has been slow during the past decade and uneven across sectors\u2014rapid in \nthe  urban  sector,  but  slow  or  stagnant  in  rural  and  estate  sectors.  Poverty  in  rural  areas  is  consistently  higher \nthan in urban areas, and national development-related achievements often conceal large discrepancies between \nindividual  districts  and/or  provinces.  About  5%  of  the  total  project  beneficiary  population  is  urban,  while  the \nremaining 95% is rural. \n\nClimatic and agroecological conditions are more or less similar in both Eastern Province and NCP. Both regions \ndepend  on  the  northeast  monsoons  (November  to  February)  for  water,  and  experience  prolonged  periods  of \ndrought during the summer months. This has led to the development of agriculture-based livelihood systems that \ncombine both irrigated and rain-fed paddy cultivation with \"chena\" farming (slash-and-burn or shifting cultivation) \nmarked  by  the  annual  planting  of  coarse  grains,  legumes,  oilseeds,  and  vegetables.  More  that  200,000  of  Sri \nLanka\u2019s poorest families depend on chena cultivation for subsistence. Every year, if and when the rains come, \ncrops and vegetables flood the market at the same time causing prices to drop.  \n\nThe  causes  of  poverty  in  Sri  Lanka  are  complex  and  interlinked.  The  probability  of  being  poor  decreases  with \nmarket  integration,  educational  attainment,  and  the  availability  and  quality  of  basic  infrastructure  such  as \nelectricity, roads, and water and sanitation. The poverty head count index among influential areas of candidate \nroads  in  NCP  ranges  from  14  to  31.  In  Eastern  Province,  the  poverty  head  count  index  ranges  from  17  to  46. \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n2.  Design Features  \n\nBased on the 2001 assessment by the Department of Census and Statistics, 156,000 people in Anuradhapura \ndistrict  (NCP),  and  89,000  in  Polonnaruwa  district  (NCP)  live  below  the  poverty  line.  Less  than  half  of  the \npopulation has access to electricity and less than 10% use gas for cooking. The most common cooking fuel is \nfirewood.  \n\nThe  Project's  main  pro-poor  design  feature  is  the  devolution  of  management  responsibilities  to  the  provincial \nauthorities and the provision of assistance in support of their mandate to facilitate the achievement of sustainable \nand  equitable  human  development  through  participatory  systems of  good  governance and  local  administration. \nOther features include specific clauses in the contract documents to encourage civil works contractors to employ \nlocal workers including women during the construction and maintenance phases, and to ensure that contractors \ncomply with all applicable labor laws, including elimination of gender differentiated wages.  \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \n\nKey  Issues. Due to the long prevailing conflict in Sri Lanka, the livelihoods of people in much of the north and \neast of the country have been devastated. These regions, especially Eastern Province, were also affected by the \ntsunami that ravaged so much of coastal South and Southeast Asia in December 2004. Although the north and \neast  combined  made  up  about  14%  of  the  population  on  the  island  in  2003,  the  regional  economy  contributed \nonly 8% of national gross domestic product. Agriculture and fisheries continue to make up a significant part of the \neconomy,  but  the  importance  of  the  sector  has  eroded  during  the  conflict  years.  Before  the  conflict,  paddy, \nonions,  chilies,  tobacco,  fruits,  dairy  products,  and  fish  were  sold  in  significant  quantities  to  other  parts  of  the \ncountry.  However,  due  to  transportation  difficulties  and  the  trade  embargo,  commercial  agriculture  throughout \nmuch of the region was transformed into subsistence agriculture.  \n\nEastern Province roads in particular are seriously dilapidated. No rehabilitation and little maintenance have been \ncarried  out  for  the  last  decade  or  more.  This  seriously  impedes  efforts  to  reduce  poverty  along  with  other \ndevelopment interventions planned for the region. However, with provincial elections in Eastern Province having \ngone ahead as planned on 10 May 2008, the prospect of political stability and development is enhanced there \nand  in  neighboring  regions.  Trincomalee  is  the  capital  of  Eastern  Province  and  one  of  the  foremost  regional \ncenters  in  Sri  Lanka.  It  has  an  important  natural  harbor  and  deep-water  port  connecting  Sri  Lanka  with  the \noutside  world.  Anuradhapura  is  the  administrative  capital  of  NCP.  Many  industries  such  as  paddy  processing \nmills, concrete workshops, hotels, shops, and vehicle service stations are located along the project roads in its \nvicinity.  \n\nA  key  indicator  of  the  likely  social  impact  of  improving  the  project  roads  is  the  number  of  urban  centers  and \nservice delivery institutions located in their vicinity.  \n\nTable A14.1 shows these numbers for the project roads. \u201cOther institutions\u201d includes banks, divisional secretariat \noffices, and police stations. These tend to be located in a single urban center in each divisional secretary division. \nThroughout  the  country,  251  of  these  administrative  units  are  under  central  Government  control.  Rural \ncommunities  located  at  considerable  distance  from  these  small  urban  centers  are  often  among  the  most \neconomically and socially disadvantaged. Improving transport links is one of the most direct ways to remove this \ndisadvantage. \n\nTable A14.1: Numbers of Urban Centers and Service Delivery Institutions \n\n \n\nProvince \n\nSchools \n\nHospitals \n\nEastern Province \n\nNorth Central Province \n\n52 \n\n40 \n\n22 \n\n7 \n\n40 \n\n46 \n\nSource: 2007.

Consultation and Participation \n\n128,964 \n\n74.0 \n\n25.0 \n\n1. A summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n\nThe  consultation  and  participation  process  was  initiated  during  field  surveys  conducted  from  August  to \nSeptember  2007  with  residents  living  within  25  meters  of  the  proposed  roads'  existing  center  lines.  This  was \nfollowed  by  a  series  of  community  consultations  that  took  place  during  the  detailed  design  phase  (May\u2013June \n2008).  A  variety  of  stakeholders  including  both  male  and  female  road  users  were  consulted  individually  and  in \ngroups.  The  views  of  drivers,  farmers,  local  officials,  business  owners,  teachers,  housewives,  and  students  on \nthe proposed road improvements were sought in order to obtain relevant suggestions for enhancing the Project's \nbenefits and mitigating the negative impacts.  \n\nAll  road  users  mentioned  time  savings  as  a  potentially  significant  benefit  from  the  Project.  Local  stakeholders \nexpect  that  public  transit  service  will  improve  (i.e.,  more  frequent  and  lower  cost  buses).  A  second  key  issue \nraised  by  the  stakeholders  is  related  to  road  design.  Many  complaints  were  received  about  inadequate  road \nwidth,  lack  of  drainage,  and  inadequate  road  shoulders.  All  these  problems  create  difficulties  for  road  users. \nStakeholders also expressed concern about the quality of routine maintenance. \n \n2. Level of consultation and participation during the project implementation and monitoring.  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3.  Was a consultation and participation plan prepared? \n \nThe  project  implementation  consultant  under  the  Project  will  assist  the  respective  provincial  road  agencies  to \nmonitor project impacts through consultations with stakeholders and road users. \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues.  \n \nKey  gender  issues  in  the  transport  sector  in  Sri  Lanka  include  jobs,  awareness  campaigns  on  HIV/AIDS  and \nhuman trafficking risks, and special support to vulnerable (i.e., poor, elderly, or disabled) households headed by \nwomen.  The  Project  will  not  provide  any  specific  gender-related  benefits.  However,  a  parallel  assistance  for \npromoting gender-responsive access to road rehabilitation-related opportunities is being proposed to be \nfinanced under Japan Funds for Poverty Reduction. \n \n \n \n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n \n2.

The \nconsultant will monitor the \ncontractor\u2019s compliance with all \nstaffing and labor provisions in \nthe contract. \n \n \n\n \nAffordability \n\n \nThe Project will \nreduce the cost of \ntransportation and \ngoods purchased \nfrom outside. \n \n \n\n   Action \n   No Action \n\n\f \n\n \nIssue \n\nOther Risks and/or \nVulnerabilities \nHIV/AIDS \nHuman trafficking \nOthers(conflict, \n\npolitical instability, etc), \nplease specify \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n59 \n\nPlan or Other Measures \nIncluded in Design \n\n \n\n  Plan \n  Other Action \n   No Action \n\n \nStrategy to Address Issue \nSexually transmitted diseases \nand HIV/AIDS as a result of the \npossible influx of migrant \nlaborers and construction \nworkers is rather low due to the \npriority to be given to local \nhiring of labor and the still \nstrong social control in the \nvillages. However, as a \npreventive measure, \nappropriate and timely \ninformation and awareness to \nconstruction workers on the \nrisks of sexually transmitted \ndiseases and HIV/AIDS and \nantitrafficking of women and \nchildren will be made part of the \nhealth and safety program at \ncampsites during construction. \nThe consultant will monitor the \ncontractor\u2019s compliance with all \nstaffing and labor provisions in \nthe contract.  \n\n \nSignificance \nSri Lanka has a low \nprevalence rate of \nHIV/AIDS infection, \nand no cases of \nhuman trafficking \nwere reported \nduring surveys and \ninterviews along \nthe candidate \nroads. This is \nindicated by the \nstatistical data \navailable from Sri \nLanka\u2019s National \nHIV/AIDS control \nagency\u2019s website.b  \n \nA potential risk is \nthat unforeseen \ncircumstances \ncould increase \npolitical instability in \nthe East. However, \nreconstruction and \ndevelopment \nactivities are \nessential to ensure \nthe reduction of \nregional disparities.  \n \n\nIV.  MONITORING AND EVALUATION \n\n \nAre  social  indicators  included  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  to  facilitate  monitoring  of  social \ndevelopment activities and/or social impacts during project implementation?  \n \na   The HDI provides a composite measure of three dimensions of human development: living a long and healthy life (measured \nby life expectancy), being educated (measured by adult literacy and enrolment at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels) and \nhaving  a  decent  standard  of  living  (measured  by  purchasing  power  parity  income).  The  gender-related  development  index, \nmeasures achievements in the same dimensions using the same indicators as th e HDII but captures inequalities in achievement \nbetween  women  and  men.
