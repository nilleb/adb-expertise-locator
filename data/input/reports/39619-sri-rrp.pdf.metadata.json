The \nsummary is in Supplementary Appendix G. \n   \nProject Description  The  Eastern  and  North  Central  Provincial  Road  Project  (the \nProject) will rehabilitate about 370 kilometers (km) of provincial \nroads in Eastern Province and North Central Province (NCP). \nPavement  will  be  strengthened,  and  bridges,  drainage,  and \nculverts will be improved or replaced as necessary. Consulting \nservices  will  be  provided  to  support  project  implementation, \nstrengthening the project management capability of the Eastern \nProvincial Road Development Department (EPRDD) and North \nCentral Provincial Road Development Authority (NCPRDA). \n \nOverall road sector management capacity in both provinces will \nbe  enhanced  by  (i)  modernizing  the  EPRDD  office,  and  (ii) \nimproving the capacity of EPRDD and NCPRDA to manage road \nassets. \n   \nRationale  Those who live in eastern Sri Lanka have especially suffered \nfrom the consequences of the country\u2019s prolonged conflict. With \nthe  holding  of  elections  in  the  Eastern  Province,  and  the \nconstitution  of  the  Provincial  Council,  the  Government  of  Sri \nLanka has focused on Eastern Province's development (and that \nof  adjacent  provinces)  within  the  framework  of  devolution \nintroduced  by  the  13th  amendment  to  the  Constitution.  The \nProject  will  support  the  Government's  objective  by  improving \nprovincial roads  and strengthening and enhancing capacity of \ndevolved  structures  of  provincial  road  institutions  in  Eastern \nProvince and adjacent NCP. \n \nThe Project will improve connectivity in the provinces\u2019 transport \nnetworks. Improved roads\u2014in conjunction with a range of other \ncarefully  coordinated  measures  proposed  in  the  country \npartnership  strategy  (CPS)  and  designed  to  strengthen \nadministrative and absorptive capacity in poorer regions\u2014will \ncontribute  to  poverty  reduction.  By  improving  connectivity  to \nneglected  areas,  the  Project  will  support  socially  inclusive \ndevelopment. Therefore, because it will contribute to reducing \n ", "ii   \ndisparities in Sri Lanka, the Project is in line with the CPS. \nThe institutional capacities of EPRDD and NCPRDA must be \nstrengthened,  particularly  in  planning,  programming,  and \ncontract  administration.  The  Project  will  also  help  strengthen \ntheir institutional capacity in road asset management. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  impact  will  be  an  overall  improvement  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s \ntransport  system.  Transport  of  goods  and  services  will  be \nenhanced, contributing to economic growth and community well \nbeing. The Project's immediate outcome will be an improved \nroad network and institutional capacity in Eastern Province and \nNCP. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $78.0 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $8.0 million and interest during \nconstruction of $2.8 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  The  financing  plan  includes  a  loan  in  various  currencies \nequivalent  to  SDR45,320,000  ($70  million  equivalent)  from \nSpecial Funds resources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \nThe loan will have a 32-year term, including an 8-year grace \nperiod, an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per year during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per year thereafter, and such other terms \nand conditions as are set forth in the draft loan and project \nagreements. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2014 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2013 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency   Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Councils (MLGPC) \n   \nImplementing Agencies  Eastern Provincial Council through EPRDD \nNorth Central Provincial Council through NCPRDA \n   \nImplementation  MLGPC, through the existing project coordinating unit that is \nArrangements  responsible for coordinating project preparatory activities for all \nprovincial roads, will be responsible for overall coordination of \nthe Project, including provision of policy and technical guidance \nand  interagency  coordination.  For  procurement  and  project \nimplementation,  EPRDD  and  NCPRDA,  led  by  a  provincial \ndirector and general manager, respectively, will be responsible \nfor  day-to-day  implementation.  The  provincial  director  and \ngeneral manager have been delegated adequate technical and \nadministrative authority for expeditious project implementation. \nAssisted by MLGPC, EPRDD and NCPRDA will engage project \nimplementation consultants separately to act as engineers for \nthe civil works contracts. \n   \n \n ", "  iii\n \nProcurement  Procurement under the loan will be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from \ntime  to  time)  and  the  Government's  tender  procedures \nacceptable  to  ADB.  Supply  contracts  will  be  procured  under \nnational competitive bidding procedures if the contract values \nare $100,000\u2013$1,000,000, and shopping if less than $100,000. \nAs requested by the Government, national competitive bidding \nprocedures acceptable to ADB will be adopted for civil works. \nThere will be 22 road, 4 bridge, and 2 building works contract \npackages, ranging between $0.2 million and $3.4 million. \n   \nConsulting Services  Consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). For each province, an international consulting firm \nin association with national consulting firm(s) will be hired as \nproject implementation consultants, which will assume the role \nof  the  engineer  for  the  civil  works  contracts.  In  total,  about \n70  person-months  of  international  consultants  and \n1,514 person-months of national consultants will be required.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will contribute to the improvement of the overall \nBeneficiaries  performance of road sector in Eastern Province and NCP by \nimproving  transport  efficiency  and  expanding  access  to \neconomic opportunities and public services. The beneficiaries \nwill  be  people,  companies,  government  agencies,  and \nnongovernment  agencies  that  use  project  road  transport \nservices  directly  and  indirectly.  Communities  served  by  the \nproject roads will benefit from improved, lower-cost, and faster \ntransport  services,  and  thereby  obtain  improved  access  to \neconomic opportunities and social services. The benefits are not \nconfined  to  any  specific  ethnic  or  other  social  group.  The \nimproved roads will facilitate movement of goods and people, \nand improve livelihood activities of the communities along the \nroads, including returned internally displaced people. The local \nlabor force will have access to employment opportunities during \nthe construction phase and maintenance. Transport operators, \ncarrying both passengers and freight, will benefit from improved \nroads in terms of lower vehicle-operating costs, time-savings, \nand  improved  road  safety,  thereby  increased  productivity. \nGovernment and nongovernment agencies served by the project \nroads  will  improve  their  service  delivery  due  to  improved \ntransport efficiency. \n \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The risk of initial delays has been mitigated through ensuring \nproject implementation readiness during processing. A feasibility \nstudy,  detailed  design  and  procurement  assistance  were \nprovided through the ongoing technical assistance loan for the \nRoad Project Preparatory Facility. Advance actions are being \ntaken  with  the  objective  of  awarding  about  50  percent  of \n ", "iv   \ncontracts immediately following loan effectiveness. The risk of \ndelay  in  releasing  counterpart  funds  has  been  mitigated  by \nproviding  90%  of  financing  under  the  loan,  leaving  the \nGovernment to finance only tax and duties.  \n \nPerformance-based  maintenance  after  completion  will  be \nincluded in the civil works contracts. The EPRDD and NCPRDA \nroad asset management systems will be strengthened for better \nplanning and budgeting. Maintenance budgets will be increased \nto  meet  requirements,  and  EPRDD  and  NCPRDA's  strict \nmonitoring systems for implementation will minimize the risk of \nunderutilizing  these  budgets.  The  Eastern  and  North  Central \nProvincial Councils have agreed to dedicate their vehicle license \nfee revenues to routine road maintenance. At least 70% of the \nrequired funds for periodic road maintenance will be provided by \n2012, with gradual increases of 10% every year. \n \nThere are general risks associated with communal tension and \nsensitivities,  history,  political  uncertainty,  return  of  displaced \npersons, and considerable security staff presence. Such conflict-\nsensitive considerations, including distribution fairness among \ndifferent ethnic groups, were taken into account when selecting \nthe roads and agreed upon by the Government and the Eastern \nand  North  Central  provincial  councils.  In  line  with  the  key \noperational  guidelines  provided  in  the  CPS  on  working  in \nconflict-affected  areas,  the  Project  has  been  prepared \nemphasizing  transparency  and  involving  stakeholders  and \nbeneficiaries.   \n   \nTechnical Assistance  In  conjunction  with  the  Project,  capacity-building  technical \nassistance (TA) will be provided for institutional development of \nprovincial road agencies in Eastern Province and NCP to (i) \nmodernize the offices, (ii) improve business processes, and (iii) \nmanage road assets, strengthening their ability to support the \ndevolution  process  under  the  13th  amendment  of  the \nConstitution. The TA is estimated to cost $950,000, of which \nADB will finance $800,000 on a grant basis from its TA funding \nprogram. Consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime  to  time).  International  consulting  inputs  of  22  person-\nmonths, and 14 person-months of national consulting inputs, will \nbe required. The TA will be implemented from March 2010 to \nFebruary 2012. \n ", "80 o 00'E 81o  30'E\nP a l k     S t r a i t KankasantKuroadiikamam EASTERN ASNRDI   NLAONRKTAH CENTRAL\nJaffna PROVINCIAL ROAD PROJECT\nKilinochchi\nProject Province\nP a l k     B a y\nNational Capital\nMullaittivu\nChief Provincial Town\nTanniyuttu\nCity/Town\nMankulam Project Road\nTalaimannar\n9 o 00'N NORTHERN National Road 9 o 00'N\nMannar Puliyankulam Provincial Road\nRiver\nVavuniya Provincial Boundary\nGulf   of   Mannar Boundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\nTrincomalee\nHorowupotana\nAnuradhapura\nNORTH  CENTRAL\nB a y     o f     B e n g a l\nTambuttegama\nPuttalam\nKekirawa\nWelikanda\nPolonnaruwa Valaichchenai\nDambulla\nEASTERN Batticaloa\nNORTH\nWESTERN\nChilaw\nMadampe Kurunegala Matale\nCENTRAL\nPolgahawela Kandy\nMawanella Ampara\nNegombo Warakapola\nMinuwangoda Kegalle\nGampola\nGampaha\n7 o 00'N Talawakele Nuwara Eliya Badulla 7 o 00'N\nColombo Avissawella Welimada\nU V A\nSRI JAYAWARDENEPURA KOTTE Hatton Monaragala\nMoratuwa WESTERN Bandarawela\nRatnapura\nWellawaya\nPelmadulla Balangoda\nKalutara\nSABARAGAMUWA\nAlutgama\nElpitiya\nAmbalangoda\nSOUTHERN\nHikkaduwa Akuressa N\nHambantota\nGalle\nMatara Tangalle\n0 10 20 30 40 50\nKilometers\nI N D I A N      O C E A N\n80 o 00'E 81o  30'E\n09-0945 HR", " \nI.

RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  Since 1983, Sri Lanka has suffered from prolonged conflict, and its population in the east \nhas particularly suffered from its consequences. In October 2006, administration of Eastern \nProvince  separated  from  the  combined  North-East  Provincial  Council.  An  elected  civil \nadministration  was  then  established  in  2008,  when  the  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  took \nadministrative control over Eastern Province. To catch up with developments in other parts of \nthe country, the Government has been focusing on the development of Eastern Province and its \nadjacent provinces. It plans to redevelop and integrate the province into the wider economy. \nThe Project will support the Government's objective by improving provincial roads in Eastern \nProvince  and  adjacent  North  Central  Province  (NCP).  The  project  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. Details of the provincial road analysis are in Appendix 2.  \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.   Sri Lanka has a road network of about 116,000 kilometers (km), comprising about \n11,700 km of national highways (classes A and B); 15,500 km of provincial roads (classes C \nand D); 65,000 km of local authority roads (class E); and the remainder being unclassified \nroads.1 Road transport accounts for 90% of passenger and 95% of freight land transport. \nVehicle ownership and road traffic continue to grow rapidly. \n \n4.  While the road network is extensive (1.6 km per square kilometer [km2]), most roads \nwere built more than 60 years ago. Standards are inadequate to keep up with the growing \npassenger and freight traffic. Moreover, due to neglect of road maintenance, road conditions are \noften  poor.  It  is  estimated  that  the  percentages  of  the  national  and  provincial  roads  in \nmaintainable condition are only 60% and 40%, respectively. \n \n5.  There are several agencies involved in the management of road infrastructure. The \nMinistry  of  Highways  and  Road  Development  has  overall  responsibility  for  policies  and \nprograms  concerning  national  roads.  The  Road  Development  Authority  is  responsible  for \nplanning and managing the development and maintenance of national roads. Following the \npassage of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution in 1987, responsibility for provincial roads \nwas devolved to provincial councils. The Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Councils \n(MLGPC) is the provincial councils' representative in the Cabinet, responsible for national-level \npolicy and legislation. Within provinces, provincial road agencies are responsible for planning \nand  managing  the  development  and  maintenance  of  provincial  roads.  Several  different \nstructures were adopted for these agencies, including creating a separate road department \n                                                 \n1  Class A roads are national highways connecting different provinces, major cities, and ports. Class B roads are \nnational highways within a province connecting major urban areas. Class C roads are surfaced provincial roads \nand major feeder roads connecting towns and villages. Class D roads are other-surfaced provincial roads and \nminor feeder roads connecting settlements with markets. Class E roads are unsurfaced or gravel local roads, \nproviding access to specific locations. Unclassified roads include plantation, forest, and irrigation roads. \n ", "   \nunder the provincial council, assigning responsibilities to provincial engineering or public works \ndepartments, and establishing a separate road development authority.  \n \n6.  In late 2005, supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and World Bank, the \nRoad  Maintenance  Trust  Fund  was  established  to  finance  routine  and  periodic  road \nmaintenance. Since 80% of traffic volume is on national roads in Sri Lanka, however, funds \nhave been mainly allocated for national roads. Currently, with World Bank assistance, the fund\u2019s \neffectiveness is being reviewed. Yet the need for provincial road maintenance remains urgent\u2014\nand as the responsibility to maintain provincial roads is with provincial councils, there is a need \nto find a mechanism for financing provincial road maintenance at the provincial level. ADB and \nthe World Bank have conducted coordinated policy dialogues on this matter. \n \n1.  Eastern Province \n7.  The province consists of three districts: Ampara, Batticaloa, and Trincomalee. Nearly \none third of its boundary is the eastern sea coast of Sri Lanka. Trincomalee has a natural  \ndeep-water harbor, the fifth largest in the world. Beaches were popular with tourists; however, \nover  the  past  two  decades,  they  have  also  witnessed  many  intermittent  armed  conflicts. \nTrincomalee is not developed other than for flour processing, cement manufacture, and oil \nstorage facilities. The province\u2019s economy is focused on agriculture, animal husbandry, and \nfisheries. \n \n8.  Its population is estimated at 1.46 million, made up of 40.3% Sri Lankan Tamil, 37.6% \nSri Lankan Moor, and 21.6% Sinhalese.2 Due to the conflict, Eastern Province was not included \nin the last poverty study. However, it is understood that its poverty is among the worst in the \ncountry. Per capita income in 2007 was SLRs119,131 per year, or 66.6% of the national level. \nWhile  the  area  represents  15%  of  the  country,  its  gross  domestic  product  in  2007  was \nSLRs177,863, or 4.97% of the national gross domestic product. \n \n9.  The road network includes 857 km of national highways, 1,098 km of provincial roads \n(classes C and D), 4,838 km of rural roads (class E), and 3,412 km of other roads. The road \ndensity is 1.02 km per km2, while the national road density is 1.60 km per km2. Most of its roads \nwere severely damaged and neglected during the conflict. About 30% of provincial roads are \ngravel and earth roads. Only 20% are in good condition. Where access is possible, riding \nconditions are poor, vehicle speeds are low, and vehicle-operating costs are high.  \n10.  The Eastern Provincial Road Development Department (EPRDD) is responsible for the \nconstruction, maintenance, and administration of the provincial road network. It is headed by a \nprovincial director who works directly under the authority of the province\u2019s Secretary of road \ndevelopment. Key personnel under the provincial director include a deputy director, four chief \nengineers, a chief accountant, an administrative officer, and other support staff. Three chief \nengineers are responsible for monitoring the works executed by respective executive engineers. \nOne chief engineer is responsible for planning, design, and quality control. A special unit for \nmachinery and equipment is kept for deployment within the province. \n11.  Some  EPRDD  staff  members  were  involved  in  ADB-financed  projects,  including \nprovincial and rural road components of the ADB-funded Conflict-Affected Areas Rehabilitation \nProject, Tsunami-Affected Areas Rebuilding Project, and North East Community Restoration \n                                                 \n2  Department of Census & Statistics. 2001 Census. \n ", " \nand Development Project,3 as well as the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)-\nfunded Pro-Poor Eastern Infrastructure Development Project.4 \n \n12.  In 2007, the estimated fleet of motorized vehicles in Eastern Province was 92,091, or \naround 4.1% of the national fleet. Motorcycles make up almost 70% of the fleet. In 2007, \nEastern Province developed procedures for collecting revenue from vehicle license fees. For the \nperiod January\u2013November 2008, this revenue was almost SLRs100 million. \n \n13.  Budgetary  expenditure  for  provincial  roads  is  funded  by  the  Government,  and  has \nsteadily increased: SLRs159.0 million in 2006, SLRs193.1 million in 2007, and SLRs215.0 \nmillion in 2008. The actual expenditures, however, were only SLRs97.1 million, SLRs105.2 \nmillion, and SLRs70.3 million, respectively, due to unreleased funds. \n \n14.  There are around 130 interprovincial bus services per day, and 500 buses are operating \nwithin the province\u2014the lowest bus penetration in the country. There are 47 dedicated rural bus \nservices that are subsidized, providing important connections between rural and town centers. \nTwo-wheelers and hand tractors are also used extensively, as are small trucks and vans. \nTrucking is deregulated, and rates are competitive. \n \n2.  North Central Province \n15.  NCP has two administrative districts, Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa, named after their \nrespective capital cities. Anuradhapura was the capital of Sri Lanka from the 4th century BC \nuntil the beginning of the 11th century AD. The capital then moved east to Polonnaruwa, where \nit stood until the end of the 13th century AD. The ruins of the cities have been designated as \ncultural heritage sites and are immensely popular with tourists. \n \n16.  The province is considered poor and is sparsely populated, as the land tends to be dry \ntropical woodland. Having more than 10,000 water reservoirs, irrigated paddy fields are the \nlargest employment provider. The area presently contributes over 20% of the country's paddy \nproduction, in addition to vegetables and animal husbandry. Its share of the national gross \ndomestic product is around 4%, and it had a 2007 per capita income of SLRs117,384, which \nwas 65.7% of the national level and one of the lowest gross domestic product growth rates in \nthe country. The province is home to about 1.1 million people, of whom 17.5% exist below the \npoverty line as compared to 15.0% nationally. \n \n17.  The road network includes 1,141 km of national highways, about 1,951 km of provincial \nroads, 11,835 km of rural roads, and 1,173 km of other roads. Road density is 0.84 km per km2, \nfar below of the national average of 1.60 km per km2. About 22% of the provincial roads require \nreconstruction, 18% require rehabilitation, while 38% and 22% are in fair and good conditions, \nrespectively. More than 37% are gravel or earth roads. From 2003 to 2007, the vehicle fleet \nincreased  at  an  average  annual  growth  rate  of  16.6%,  most  due  to  motorcycles  and  \nthree-wheelers.  \n                                                 \n3 ADB. 2003.

Responsibility  for  managing  provincial  roads  in  NCP  lies  with  the  North  Central \nProvincial Road Development Authority (NCPRDA), which is headed by a board of directors, \none of whom is appointed as the chairperson. The next in line is the general manager, who is \nresponsible for the execution of NCPRDA\u2019s work program and administration. There are two \ndeputy general managers for engineering and for financial and human resources development. \nThe deputy general manager (engineering) manages roadwork with the assistance of the three \nchief engineers. Out of these three, two are handle operations in the two districts. The other \nchief engineer (planning, design, and quality control) is supported by another four executive \nengineers for planning, design, and quality control. All maintenance and improvement work is \ncontracted to private contractors. NCPRDA does not operate specific machinery but maintains a \nfairly good laboratory for quality control.   \n \n19.  Capacity  building  was  provided  to  NCPRDA  through  the  ADB-funded  Road  Sector \nDevelopment  Project5 (RSDP).  A  software  program  for  maintaining  a  road  inventory  and \ncondition database for provincial road networks was in place. However, road rehabilitation and \nmaintenance have not been conducted regularly due to the inconsistency and inadequacy of \navailable funds. Most are still handled on an ad-hoc basis. \n \n20.  Budgetary  expenditures  for  provincial  roads  are  funded  by  the  Government,  which \ntotaled SLRs365 million in 2006, SLRs425 million in 2007, and SLRs325 million in 2008. On \naverage, actual expenditures are about 70% of the allocations. The low utilization is mostly due \nto unreleased allocations or delayed release during the later part of the year, making it difficult \nto complete all planned work programs. \n \n21.  The Department of Motor Traffic collects revenue from vehicle registration within the \nprovince. Revenues related to road use are mainly from these fees, which were about SLRs90.0 \nmillion in 2006, SLRs118.0 million in 2007, and SLRs120.8 million in 2008. The relatively high \nincrease in 2007 was due to improvement of vehicle registration system and an increase in \nfees.  \n \n22.  The Road Passenger Transport Authority is responsible for regularizing the provision of \nomnibus transport and is authorized to issue route permits for intraprovincial buses. There are \nabout 652 private omnibuses and 262 state-owned buses. Other passenger vehicles include \nschool vans, office vans, two-wheelers, and three-wheelers or taxis. Trucking is deregulated \nwith competitive rates. Railways also provide services, but mostly for the transport of fuel and \ncement. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n23.  In Sri Lanka, high poverty levels are linked to lack of access to infrastructure; similarly, \npoor infrastructure constrains growth. Rural enterprises cite transport as a major obstacle to \nstarting or operating a business. Provincial roads provide essential connectivity, linking national \nroads,  which  connect  consumer  areas,  and  local  roads,  which  connect  rural  agricultural \nproduction areas. Provincial roads also facilitate essential bus services, ensuring access to \neconomic opportunities and inclusive growth. In Eastern Province and NCP, therefore, improved \nprovincial roads and resulting benefits will help balance socioeconomic disparities within the \nprovinces and keep up with national-level economic growth. \n                                                 \n5 ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan and \nTechnical Assistance Grants to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Road Sector Development \nProject. Manila (Loan SRI-1986, for $56.5 million, approved on 19 December). \n ", " \n1.  Decentralization of Provincial Road Management \n \n24.  In accordance with the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, responsibility for managing \nthe development and maintenance of provincial roads lies with provincial councils.6 However, \ntechnical capabilities, training facilities, knowledge bases of codes and practices, and databases \nare still retained at the central Government level. As a result, provincial-level capacity has \nlagged, especially in the newly established Provincial Council in Eastern Province.   \n \n25.  ADB and JICA have assisted some provincial road agencies with capacity building in \nplanning,  budgeting,  and  contract  management.  Therefore,  NCPRDA's  capacity  is  more \nadvanced than that of EPRDD. Below are analyses of agencies\u2019 capacity in performing their \nmandates to manage provincial road networks, including (i) planning and programming, (ii) \nproject  preparation,  (iii)  procurement  and  contract  management,  and  (iv)  monitoring  and \nevaluation of program implementation. \n \n26.  Planning and Programming. Provincial road agencies are to develop and maintain a \nroad inventory and condition database\u2014a prerequisite for preparing annual or rolling road \nrehabilitation and maintenance programs along with associated budgets.   \n \n27.  In  NCP,  inventory,  road  condition  database,  and  road  maintenance  management \nsystems are in place, and have been used to prepare road maintenance budgets for 2007 \nonward. Implementation of plans, however, has been constrained by a lack of funds. To ensure \nsustainability,  the  road  maintenance  management  system  needs  to  be  updated,  a  \n3-year rolling plan developed, and more stable financing secured. \n \n28.  In Eastern Province, while the existing structure is reasonably sound from an operational \nperspective,  it  does  not  have  the  planning  capacity  to  fulfill  EPRDD's  mandate.  Although \nEPRDD has an inventory in place, no systematic road condition assessments are carried out for \nuse in the budget estimating process. Budgets are estimated based on a generalized scope of \nwork for important roads only as well as some indicative work for a certain number of km up to \nthe anticipated maximum amount of money approved from historical allocation. \n \n29.  Project Preparation. Based on the work program and approved budget, provincial road \nagencies  are  to  identify  and  formulate  projects,  and  prepare  detailed  design  and  bidding \ndocuments. Both agencies have the capacity to prepare domestically funded projects, mainly for \nmaintenance. For road rehabilitation and reconstruction projects (mostly foreign-funded), project \npreparatory  work\u2014including  feasibility  studies,  detailed  design,  bidding  documents,  and \nprocurement actions\u2014are carried out with the significant involvement of the Government (i.e., \nMLGPC). However, under the Project, in line with the devolution process, the agencies have \nbeen involved throughout the preparation period.  \n \n30.  Procurement  and  Contract  Management.  Both  agencies  are  experienced  in \nprocurement and contract management of domestically funded projects. For externally funded \nprojects, MLGPC has extensive experience in both procurement and contract management.  \n \n31.  Under  the  Project,  all  civil  works  contracts  have  been  procured  using  national \ncompetitive bidding procedures and packaged to promote provincial-level procurement and \n                                                 \n6  An important milestone in the long-term solution to the conflict, the 13th Amendment to the Constitution attempts to \ndecentralize administration by devolution. It established nine provincial councils and granted them powers to plan, \nexecute, and manage selected functions. \n ", "   \ncontract management. To strengthen provincial road agencies\u2019 capacity and to ensure that \nADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) are strictly followed, a \nnational procurement specialist has been provided to each agency throughout the procurement \nprocess, and an international procurement specialist has been fielded during the bid evaluation \nperiod. \n \n32.  For engagement of project implementation consultants, MLGPC has coordinated the \nrecruitment, as it involves international firms. To ensure project ownership and accountability of \ncontract  administration,  each  province  will  have  a  separate  team  of  consultants  under  a \nseparate contract. \n \n33.  Monitoring and Evaluation of Program Implementation. This role is to be carried out \nby the planning, design, and quality control unit of the provincial road agencies. NCPRDA has \nstaffed this unit, and the unit head (chief engineer) has just been appointed. In EPRDD, a \nsimilar unit has been recently established, and developing the capacity of this unit will be critical. \n \n2.  Road Financing \n34.  There is a serious imbalance between the decentralization of expenditures and revenues \nat the provincial level. The devolution design did not envision any significant revenue sharing, \nand with limited assigned revenues, vertical imbalances have been addressed solely by a \nsystem of provincial grants from the central Government.  \n \n35.  Currently, of the total financial needs for both recurrent and capital expenditures, the \nGovernment allocates more than 90% of all provincial council budgetary needs, with provincial \nrevenue  accounting  for  only  10%  (i.e.,  devolved  revenues).  Of  total  provincial  revenues,  \n20%\u201325% is earned from the vehicle license fees. Provincial councils do not have specific \nguidelines for allocating funds to the road sector. \n \n36.  In general, road sector expenditures are funded from central Government funds, foreign \nor external funds, and provincial revenues. While rehabilitation of provincial roads has relied \nheavily on foreign-funded projects, the existing level of domestic funding is insufficient for \nprovincial road agencies to maintain their road networks. There is a need to increase the level of \nroad budgets and to assign a greater amount to road maintenance based on road conditions. \nProper  planning  needs  to  be  developed,  and  the  Government's  commitment  to  provide \nadequate financing for maintenance needs to be secured.  \n \n37.  Under the Project, Eastern Province and NCP agreed to dedicate their vehicle license \nfee revenues to road maintenance, which will be sufficient to finance routine maintenance and a \nportion of periodic maintenance. Funds will be disbursed in such a way to meet the stable \nnetwork needs to avoid further deterioration of the network. To increase quality of construction \nand efficiency of maintenance work, performance-based road rehabilitation and maintenance \ncontracts will be introduced under the Project.  \n \n38.  To secure periodic maintenance financing for provincial roads, the Government and both \nprovinces agreed that at least 70% of required funds for periodic maintenance of provincial \nroads will be provided to the provincial councils by 2012, with a yearly increase of 10% until \n100% of the requirement is reached. \n \n ", " \n3.  Past and Proposed Institutional Capacity Program \n39.  Under the ADB-funded Southern Provincial Roads Improvement Project7 (SPRIP), an \ninstitutional development program was implemented in Southern Province to establish capacity \nfor efficient and effective management of its provincial road network. The SPRIP reorganized \nthe Southern Provincial Road Development Authority by (i) formulating more efficient work \nprocedures, and (ii) introducing appropriate modern road management tools and information \nand communication technologies. Due to its success, the same approach had been replicated in \nfour more provinces (North Central, North Western, Uva, and Western) through the RSDP, and \nin  two  other  provinces  (Central  and  Sabaraghamuwa)  through  the  JICA-funded  Provincial \nRoads  Improvement  Project.  The  progress,  achievement,  and  lessons  of  the  institutional \ndevelopment program under both projects were assessed as summarized in Supplementary \nAppendix A.  \n \n40.  While  the  institutional  development  program  under  the  SPRIP  was  considered \nsuccessful, the same under the RSDP was considered only a moderate success. The success \nof the former was due to the program being dedicated to a single provincial road agency and the \nconsulting team being based at that office, providing hands-on training for day-to-day road \nnetwork  management  as  well  as  project  management.  Under  the  latter  project,  a  generic \nprogram  that  targeted  all  provinces  has  not  necessarily  delivered  the  desired  outcomes. \nMoreover, as the main consultant is based in Colombo at the MLGPC, the consultant had much \nless  direct  interaction  with  the  four  provincial  road  agencies,  resulting  in  less  effective \nassistance.   \n \n41.  To  support  the  devolution  process,  the  Project  will  continue  to  support  capacity \ndevelopment of provincial road agencies in Eastern Province and NCP through TA, taking into \nconsideration the different stages of development and capacity of each. With regard to project \nmanagement capacity, two separate consulting teams for project implementation located in \neach province will provide hands-on training to each agency. There will be no separate project \nmanagement  unit  for  the  Project,  but  its  functions  will  be  internalized  in  the  agency\u2019s \norganizational structures, so that skills can be retained.  \n \n4.  External Assistance and Coordination \n42.  Since 1980, ADB has provided 12 loans, totaling $591 million, for the road sector, \nincluding multisector projects. The principal bilateral sources of external assistance have been \nthe People's Republic of China, France, Japan, Republic of Korea, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Spain, \nand Sweden. ADB is the largest provider among multilateral development institutions\u2014and is \nthe lead development partner\u2014followed by the European Union, United Nations Development \nProgramme, and World Bank. Coordination among development partners in Sri Lanka has been \nstrong. The list of external assistance in the road sector is in Appendix 3. \n \n43.  The Project was prepared in close coordination with JICA and the World Bank. The \nfeasibility study and detailed design of 2,400 km of provincial roads in all nine provinces were \nprovided  through  the  ongoing  ADB-funded  Road  Project  Preparatory  Facility.8 Under  the \n                                                 \n7 ADB. 1997.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Technical \nAssistance Loan to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Road Project Preparatory Facility. Manila \n(Loan 2080-SRI, for $15 million, approved on 13 April). \n ", "   \nProject, ADB will finance improvement of provincial roads in Eastern Province (Batticaloa and \nTrincomalee districts) and NCP. The World Bank will finance improvement of provincial roads in \nEastern  Province  (Ampara  District)  and  Uva  Province.  JICA  will  finance  improvement  of \nprovincial roads in Central and Sabaragamuwa provinces and rural roads in Eastern Province. \nIn  summary,  three  major  development  partners  in  the  road  sector  are  cofinancing  the \nGovernment's program to develop road network in Sri Lanka. \n \n5.  Lessons Learned \n44.  ADB's  country  assistance  program  evaluation  in  20079 states  that  given  budgetary \nconstraints,  the  demand  for  government  counterpart  funds  for  externally  funded  projects \ncompetes with and crowds out maintenance funds. The overall balance among maintenance \nand rehabilitation is sometimes overlooked. Another risk is the inadequate institutional capacity \nfor maintenance of roads by local authorities. These risks are manageable and can be mitigated \nwith measures to strengthen capacity and funding for maintenance. \n \n45.  This evaluation also identified key challenges relevant to the Project, including the risk of \nproject implementation in conflict-affected areas. As suggested, a conflict risk assessment and \nits  effects  on  project  implementation  have  been  carried  out.  In  accordance  with  its \nrecommendations, the roads to be improved are spread throughout the provinces and reach all \ncommunities. Selection of roads has been agreed with the Eastern Provincial Council and North \nCentral Provincial Council. Civil works have been packaged within a wide range of national \ncontractor capacities. Moreover, since the Project will rehabilitate existing roads, the prospect of \nland acquisition has been minimized. \n \n46.  The  SPRIP  was  rated successful  in  its  project  completion  report, and  includes  the \nfollowing lessons that have been addressed under the Project.  \n(i)  To avoid continued deterioration of roads, time between project preparation and \nimplementation has been kept as short as possible. The detailed design of roads \nwas completed in January 2009, and procurement was started in March 2009.  \n(ii)  Roads to be included in the Project have been selected taking into account local \nnetwork effects, including connection with other classes of roads.  \n(iii)  The Government has assured effective and consistent budget allocation and \nexpenditure. Coordination with relevant utilities, such as water, electricity, and \ntelecommunications, has occurred to avoid unnecessary delays as well as utility \nline work after roadwork is completed.  \n(iv)  Environmental clearance for each road has been obtained from the relevant \nauthority.  Quarries  for  construction  material  have  been  identified,  and  their \nclearance is being processed.  \n(v)  A project performance management system is being designed through close \nconsultation and workshops with stakeholders. Surveys had been conducted, \nand additional surveys and further monitoring will occur under the Project.  \n(vi)  In cooperation with the Institute for Construction Training and Development, local \ncontractors  have  been  trained  on  International  Federation  of  Consulting \nEngineers  conditions  of  contracts,  contract  management,  performance-based \nmaintenance  contracts,  and  in  ADB's  procurement  and  consultant  selection \nprocess.  Further  training  on  construction  planning  and  management  will  be \nprovided during implementation.  \n                                                 \n9 ADB. 2007. Country Assistance Program Evaluation for Sri Lanka Inclusive Development and Conflict Resolution: \nMajor Challenges in the Future. Manila. \n ", " \n47.  The previous two projects (RSDP and SPRIP) were implemented successfully without \nmajor  delays.  Moreover,  all  civil  works  contracts  were  executed  by  national  contractors, \nresulting in a stronger contracting industry. Nevertheless, as more responsibilities of project \nimplementation are given to the provincial level under the Project, there is a risk of initial \nimplementation delays. This is being addressed by adopting a project implementation readiness \nfilter. A feasibility study, detailed design, and bidding documents have been completed under \nthe Road Project Preparatory Facility. Procurement specialists have been provided to assist the \nprovincial road agencies in conducting advance actions. Loan negotiations was held only when \nphase 1 procurement has been substantially completed. Consultants will assist throughout \nproject implementation, and a realistic project implementation period has been developed with \nallowances for the capacity-building process and unforeseen delays. \n \n6.  Government Development Strategy and ADB's Country Strategy \n   \n48.  Sri Lanka is on track to achieve the Millennium Development Goal for reducing poverty. \nHowever, the prolonged conflict have devastated much of the east and north, aggravating the \nalready high income and other social differentials between these two regions and the rest of the \ncountry. The Government\u2019s goal is to achieve high economic growth that benefits the entire \npopulation and leads to the social development of the entire country. To achieve this, the \nGovernment\u2019s strategy\u2014entitled Mahinda Chinthana: Vision for a New Sri Lanka \u2013 A Ten Year \nHorizon  Development  Framework  2006\u2013201610\u2014focuses  on  strengthening  the  investment \nclimate, including road network improvement and socially inclusive and regionally balanced \ngrowth. \n \n 49.  ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy (CPS) 2009\u20132011 recognizes that achieving high \nand equitable growth will be vital to reduce poverty further. One key obstacle to growth is a \nserious  infrastructure  bottleneck,  especially  in  the  current  transport  network  that  provides \ninadequate connectivity between global and domestic markets as well as between hinterland \nand economic centers.  \n \n50.  The Project will improve connectivity in the transport networks of two relatively poor and \nconflict-affected provinces. The provision of improved roads\u2014in conjunction with a range of \nother  carefully  coordinated  measures  proposed  in  the  CPS,  designed  to  strengthen \nadministrative and absorptive capacity in poorer regions\u2014will contribute to poverty reduction. \nThe  Project  will  improve  connectivity  to  neglected  areas,  supporting  socially  inclusive \ndevelopment, and reduce disparities in Sri Lanka; therefore, the Project is relevant to achieving \nthe objective of the CPS. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n51.  In support of the CPS, the project impact will be an overall improvement of Sri Lanka\u2019s \ntransport system. Transport of goods and services will be enhanced, contributing to economic \ngrowth and community well being. The Project\u2019s immediate outcome will be the improved road \nnetwork and institutional capacity in Eastern Province and NCP. \n \n                                                 \n10 2006. Mahinda Chinthana: Vision for a New Sri Lanka \u2013 A Ten Year Horizon Development Framework 2006\u20132016. \nColombo. \n ", "   \nB.  Outputs \n52.  Project outputs are \n(i)  approximately  370  km  of  provincial  roads  rehabilitated  and  improved,  and \nselected bridge links rehabilitated or replaced; \n(ii)  enhanced project management capability of EPRDD and NCPRDA, achieving \nefficient project implementation; and  \n(iii)  an improved EPRDD office. \n \n53.  Road Rehabilitation. About 150 km of roads in Eastern Province and 220 km of roads \nin NCP will be rehabilitated.11 The use of the existing road corridor will be maximized to achieve \nthe optimal combination of economy and desired road improvement without land acquisition. \nDouble  bituminous  surface  treatment  will  be  applied.  Bridges  and  culverts  will  also  be \nrehabilitated and replaced. The technical approach and design standard of the roads are in \nAppendix 4, and the list of contract packages is in Appendix 5. \n \n54.  The roads were selected from the long-list proposed by both provinces. The criteria for \nshort-listing the roads included the role of the road in connecting economic and social services \nand national highways, traffic volume, road conditions, poverty index, and the importance of \nroad to bus services. A feasibility study was then conducted, considering (i) engineering and \ntraffic aspects, (ii) treatment options and cost estimates, (iii) social and environmental aspects, \nand (iv) economic internal rate of returns. The final list of roads then was validated in terms of \ndistribution fairness among different ethnic groups. \n \n55.  Project Management. The Project will provide project implementation consultants and \nfinance incremental expenditures for successful project implementation. The consultants will \nprovide on-the-job training with extensive hands-on technical and managerial skills to provincial \nroad agency staff in project and contract management. \n \n56.  EPRDD Office Improvement. While a capacity development TA will be provided to \nstrengthen the capacity of the provincial road agencies in managing the provincial road network, \nupgrading the EPRDD office and relevant equipment will be required and will be provided for \nunder the loan.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n57.  Devolution Process Support. Devolution of power in line with the 13th Amendment to \nthe Constitution is an important milestone in achieving a long-term solution of the conflict. The \ninstitutional and legal aspects related to devolution are assessed in Supplementary Appendix B. \nThe  Project  will  support  this  devolution  process  by  improving  provincial  capacity  and  by \nstrengthening provincial ownership of road network management. Toward institutional capacity, \na capacity development TA will be provided to strengthen provincial road agencies to carry out \ntheir main responsibility\u2014managing and maintaining the provincial road network efficiently and \neconomically.  EPRDD's  organizational  effectiveness  will  be  enhanced  by  improving  its \nmanagement structure, streamlining staff allocation, and modernizing basic office facilities and \nthe management information system. EPRDD and NCPRDA's capacity for sustainable road \nasset management will be improved by developing and implementing systematic steps for \nmonitoring, planning, and programming procedures. \n                                                 \n11   In Eastern Province, ADB will cover roads in Batticaloa and Trincomalee districts, totaling 150 km of roads, while \nthe World Bank covers 70 km of roads in Ampara District. \n ", " \n58.  To increase ownership, more responsibilities of project preparation and implementation \nhave been given to provincial authorities. The Project has adopted a simple structure, allowing \nprovincial road agencies to concentrate on their core mandate, to improve and maintain assets, \nand to implement the Project smoothly. Both provinces have roles in procurement, project \nimplementation, and administration of imprest accounts. All project preparatory works have \nbeen  completed,  and  procurement  assistance  is  being  provided.  On-the-job  training  with \nextensive hands-on technical and managerial skills will be provided to EPRDD and NCPRDA \nstaff during project implementation.  \n \n59.  Conflict Sensitivity. In line with the key operational guidelines provided in the CPS on \nworking in conflict-affected areas, the Project has been prepared emphasizing transparency and \ninvolving stakeholders and beneficiaries. A conflict awareness assessment was carried out \n(Appendix 6). As an integral part of the Government\u2019s Eastern Revival Plan,12 the Project seems \nto be universally welcome and viewed positively, and it is not perceived to benefit any one group \nat the expense of others. As the Project is intended to improve existing roads (and is creating no \nnew roads), it is expected that there will be no resettlement issues, and no land will be claimed \nfor the purposes of the Project.  \n \n60.  Collaboration among Development Partners. Under the ADB-funded Road Project \nPreparatory Facility, a feasibility study and detailed design for all nine provinces\u2019 provincial \nroads were prepared. In parallel, the three partners ADB, JICA, and the World Bank have \nagreed to support the Government's objective to develop the road network. A joint review during \nproject implementation will be explored. \n \n61.  In Eastern Province, ADB, JICA, and the World Bank assistance will cover the whole \nprovince, benefitting all ethnic groups (Muslim, Sinhalese, and Tamil). The improved provincial \nroads will be connected to local roads financed by JICA; moreover, while ADB will provide TA \nfor strengthening EPRDD\u2019s capacity in road asset management and procurement, the World \nBank will strengthen capacity in safeguard matters, and JICA will provide training in road \nconstruction  works  to  Eastern  Province  laborers,  who  will  then  be  ready  to  be  hired  by \ncontractors.13 Under the Project, civil works were packaged so they could be implemented by \nboth local and national contractors, providing employment opportunities to local laborers during \nimplementation. All contracts will be implemented in two phases, with relatively a short gap, so \nthat they will benefit all communities simultaneously. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n62.  The project investment cost is estimated at $78 million, including taxes and duties of $8 \nmillion (Table 1).  The detailed cost estimates by expenditure category and by financier are in \nAppendix 7.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n12  2007.

Financing Plan \n63.  The Government has requested a loan of SDR45,320,000 ($70 million equivalent) from \nADB\u2019s Special Fund resources to help finance the Project. The loan will have an amortization \nperiod of 32 years, including an 8-year grace period, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% \nper year during the grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter. \n \n64.  As requested by the Government, the loan will finance all expenses, or almost 90% of \nthe project cost, and the Government will only finance taxes and duties.14 This will ease the \nGovernment\u2019s  burden  to  provide  counterpart  funding.  It  is  also  consistent  with  the  CPS \napproach, considering a difficult macroeconomic environment and the focus on development \noutside developed Western Province, including support for the Government's plan to develop \nEastern Province.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n65.  The  organization  of  project  implementation  is  illustrated  in  Appendix  8.  The \nimplementation arrangements have been agreed to by the Government and synchronized with \nJICA and the World Bank's project implementation arrangements.  \n \n66.  The Executing Agency for the Project is MLGPC, responsible for overall coordination of \nproject implementation, including provision of policy and technical guidance and interagency \ncoordination. The current project coordination unit of the RSDP and Road Project Preparatory \nFacility will assist MLGPC in performing its role. The unit is led by a project coordinator, assisted \nby a chief accountant, an office engineer, and various support staff members. It has actively \nassisted Eastern Province and NCP during project preparation and with advance actions for \nprocurement and consultant selection. \n \n67.  The implementing agencies (IAs) are EPRDD for Eastern Province and NCPRDA for \nNCP. The IAs will be responsible for project management, including (i) procurement, (ii) day-to-\nday  project  implementation,  (iii)  withdrawal  application  certification,  (iv)  progress  report \npreparation, and (v) maintenance of project accounts and completion of loan financial records \nfor auditing purposes.  \n \n68.  For Eastern Province, the IA will be led by the EPRDD provincial director, assisted by \nthe  chief  engineer  in  Trincomalee,  chief  engineer  in  Batticaloa,  chief  accountant,  office \nengineer, and various support staff members. For NCP, the IA will led by the NCPRDA general \nmanager,  assisted  by  chief  engineer  of  operation  1,  chief  engineer  of  operation  2,  chief \naccountant, office engineer, and various support staff members.  \n \n69.  A national steering committee has been established to oversee and monitor project \nimplementation as well as the adequacy of overall project funding and that for nonproject roads. \nIt is chaired by the MLGPC secretary and consists of chief secretaries of Eastern Province and \nNCP and representatives from EPRDD, Finance Commission, Ministry of Finance and Planning \n(External  Resource  and  National  Planning  departments),  Ministry  of  Highways  and  Road \nDevelopment, NCPRDA, and project coordination unit. The steering committee will meet as \nrequired  but  at  least  quarterly.  When  and  as  necessary,  representatives  from  the  Central \nEnvironmental  Authority,  Geological  Survey  and  Mines  Bureau,  and  utilities  (electricity, \ntelecommunications, water, and drainage) will be invited.15  \n \n70.  In each province, a provincial coordination committee has been established, responsible \nfor monitoring project implementation at the provincial level. The committee is chaired by the \nchief secretary of the province, with representation from EPRDD or NCPRDA and the respective \nproject implementation consultants (ex officio nonvoting). The committees will conduct monthly \nmeetings. As and when necessary, provincial representatives from the Central Environmental \nAuthority, Geological Survey and Mines Bureau, and utilities (electricity, telecommunications, \nwater, and drainage) will be invited.16  \n                                                 \n15  The committee will also cover the World Bank-funded project; therefore, the chief secretary of Uva Province, and \nUva-provincial road development department will be part of the committee. The quarterly meetings will be \nconducted jointly.  \n16  Similarly,  the  provincial  coordination  committee  in  Eastern  Province  will  also  cover  the  World  Bank-  and  \nJICA-funded projects; therefore, their project implementation consultants will also be part of the committee (ex \nofficio nonvoting). The monthly meeting will be conducted jointly. \n ", "   \n2.  Implementation Period \n71.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  in  about  4  years,  reflecting  the  time  required  for \ncapacity building within the IAs and among the national contractors, with support from the \nproject implementation consultants. Procurement of civil works will be done in two phases. It is \nexpected that the Project could be declared effective in October 2009, and will be completed by \n31 December 2013. A detailed project implementation schedule is in Appendix 9. \n \n3.  Procurement \n72.  All  procurement  under  the  loan  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines. Supply contracts will be procured under national competitive bidding \nprocedures if the contract values are $100,000\u2013$1,000,000; and shopping if less than $100,000.  \n \n73.  As  requested  by  the  Government,  for  civil  works,  national  competitive  bidding \nprocedures acceptable to ADB have been adopted. Post-qualification has been exercised for \ncivil works contracts, with a bid period of 30 days, applying a single-stage two-envelope bidding \nprocedure. The use of these procedures is justified as the Project is located in a conflict-affected \narea, where foreign contractors are not likely to be interested in bidding. The works are simple \nand can be carried out by domestic contractors. The previous two projects (RSDP and SPRIP) \nalso  adopted  national  competitive  bidding  for  all  civil  works,  and  both  were  successfully \nimplemented without significant delay.  \n \n74.  The road and bridge civil works will be undertaken in 26 contract packages, ranging from \n$0.2 million to $3.4 million, and building works of two contract packages, valued at about $0.4 \nmillion each. Civil works are packaged based on their geographical location and convenience \nfor  contractors  to  mobilize  and  organize,  and  will  be  implemented  in  two  phases.  The \nprocurement plan is in Appendix 10. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n75.  Consultants will be recruited in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). IAs, assisted by MLGPC, will hire consulting teams as \nproject implementation consultants separately, which will assume the role of the engineer for the \ncivil works contracts, respectively. The consultants will support IAs in implementing the Project, \nand strengthen IAs' capacity in contract management, project performance monitoring, and \nevaluation. Consultants will be selected using quality- and cost-based selection procedures, \nwith a 90:10 proportion of quality to cost. About 70 person-months of international consultants \nand 1,514 person-months of national consultants will be required. The outline terms of reference \nfor the consultants are in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n5.  Advance Contracting \n76.  ADB supports the Government\u2019s initiative to take advance procurement action and to \nprovide  necessary  resources  for  advance  action.  The  advance  action  was  approved  by \nManagement on 29 January 2009. The Government has been advised, however, that support \nfor advance action does not commit ADB to finance the Project. No retroactive financing will be \nrequired. Assessment of the procurement capacity of EPRDD and NCPRDA was conducted, \nand  procurement  specialists  have  been  fielded  to  provide  assistance  throughout  the \nprocurement process. \n  \n ", " \n77.  To monitor progress, a detailed procurement schedule was developed (Supplementary \nAppendix D). Phase 1 technical bid evaluation report has been approved by ADB on 9 June \n2009. Request for consultant proposals has been issued on 26 June 2009. Accordingly, it is \nexpected  that  phase  1  civil  works  contracts  and  consultant  contracts  could  be  awarded \nimmediately after loan becomes effective. \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n78.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations \nand the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of IAs and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other \nservice providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n79.  EPRDD and NCPRDA's governance will be strengthened under this Project. Bidding \ndocuments  for  civil  works  under  the  Project  are  standardized  following  internationally \nharmonized documents. For project management and monitoring, a strict monitoring system will \nbe introduced. The project targets, progress, and achievements will be disclosed to the public at \nthe IA head offices, construction sites, and their websites. Procurement specialists have been \nfielded to assist IAs in the procurement process.  \n \n80.  EPRDD and NCPRDA have outsourced all road rehabilitation and maintenance work to \nthe  private  sector.  To  enhance  competition  and  capacity  of  the  construction  industry, \nprocurement will not be restricted by contractor registration rules. Quality and availability of \nconstruction material quarries, especially in Eastern Province, are being assessed, and the \nfindings will be made available to all contractors. Training is provided for both skilled and \nunskilled laborers in Eastern Province, under which a database of local laborers will be made \navailable to contractors. These actions will help increase competition between contractors, \nincrease work quality, and reduce costs. For the Project, ADB procurement procedures will \nenhance  transparency  and  fair  competition,  and  ADB  disbursement  procedures  and \nInternational  Federation  of  Consulting  Engineers-based  contract  management  will  mitigate \ncorruption during implementation. \n  \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n81.  Loan  disbursements  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time), and the agreed detailed arrangements. An \nimprest  account  will  be  established  at  the  Central  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  with  MLGPC.  Initial \nadvances and the maximum amount to be deposited to the account will, in total, be equivalent \nto  the  estimated  eligible  expenditures  for  the  next  6  months  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount, \nwhichever is lower. One second-generation imprest account (SGIA) will be established at the  \nproject coordination unit of the MLGPC. Two SGIAs will be established and operated by chief \nsecretary  of  each  provincial  council,  opened  for  EPRDD  and  NCPRDA  at  state  banks \nacceptable to ADB. The initial advances of SGIAs will be the estimated expenditures for 6 \nmonths or 10% of the loan amount to be financed through each SGIA, whichever is lower.  \n \n ", "   \n82.  The respective chief secretaries will be responsible for project implementation through \nEPRDD  and  NCPRDA,  including  monthly  reconciliation  of  the  accounts  and  provision  of \nsupportive documents for withdrawal applications by MLGPC for liquidation or replenishment of \nthe SGIAs. The project coordination unit, EPRDD, and NCPRDA have sufficient capacity to \nadminister the accounts, and have adequate accounting and internal controls. The flow of funds \nis illustrated in Appendix 11. \n \n83.  The imprest accounts will be established, managed, and liquidated in accordance with \nADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook, and detailed arrangements agreed to by the Government \nand ADB. Statement of expenditure procedures will be used to reimburse, liquidate, or replenish \nthe imprest account for any individual payments not exceeding the equivalent of $100,000.  \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n84.  EPRDD, MLGPC, and NCPRDA will maintain separate project records and accounts to \nidentify the financing resources received and expenditures made on the Project. The project \naccounts  and  related  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  in  accordance  with \nappropriate auditing standards consistently applied by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. \nThe audited reports and financial statements will be submitted to ADB not later than 6 months \nafter the end of each fiscal year. The imprest accounts and statement of expenditure will be \naudited as part of the regular annual audit. The auditor\u2019s opinion of the examination of the \nimprest account and statement of expenditure will be set out in the auditor\u2019s report. EPRDD, \nMLGPC, and NCPRDA are aware of ADB's policy on delayed submission and also of the \nimportance of satisfactory and acceptable audited reports. ADB reserves the right to verify the \nfinancial  accounts  of  EPRDD,  MLGPC,  and  NCPRDA  to  confirm  that  the  share  of  ADB's \nfinancing is used in accordance with ADB's policies and procedures. \n \n85.  EPRDD and NCPRDA will separately prepare and submit to ADB (and copies provided \nto MLGPC) monthly progress reports in electronic form, containing basic data, implementation \nprogress, major issues and proposed remedial measures, and work to be undertaken in the \nfollowing period. The monthly reports should be received by ADB within 15 days of the end of \nthe month. Every quarter, EPRDD and NCPRDA will submit more detailed reports to MLGPC, \nwhich will consolidate the report and submit it to ADB. In addition to the basic information \nprovided  in  the  monthly  reports,  the  quarterly  reports  will  include  any  changes  to  the \nimplementation  schedule,  utilization  of  funds,  achievement  of  outputs  and  outcome,  and \ncompliance with loan covenants. The format and content of both monthly and quarterly reports \nwill be attached to the project administration memorandum to be agreed upon at the inception \nreview mission. \n \n86.  Within 3 months of project completion, in collaboration with EPRDD and NCPRDA, \nMLGPC will submit to ADB a project completion report with a detailed evaluation of the project \ndesign, costs, contractor and consultant performance, social and economic impact, economic \nrate of return, and other details as requested by ADB. The project performance indicators will be \ncompared with those of the control roads.  \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n87.  The achievement of the project performance targets will be assessed following the \ndesign and monitoring framework. EPRDD and NCPRDA, assisted by project implementation \nconsultants,  will  establish  a  project  performance  management  system.  Indicators  to  be \nmonitored include (i) traffic volume, (ii) bus and freight transport fares, (iii) travel time or riding \n ", " \nspeed, (iv) vehicle-operating costs, (v) surface roughness, and (vi) road accidents. In addition, \nsocioeconomic secondary data will be obtained at the divisional secretary level, including (i) \nnumber of businesses, (ii) household income, (iii) vehicle ownership, (iv) unemployment rate, \nand (v) land value. These indicators will be monitored before and after construction, both on the \nproject roads and on some control roads. In addition, every year during the project period, \nEPRDD and NCPRDA will also monitor the (i) road maintenance budget, (ii) ratio of staff\u2013km of \nprovincial  road,  and  (iii)  road  maintenance  cost  per  km.  Achievement  of  the  institutional \ndevelopment program will also be monitored. For civil works, progress will be monitored and \nreported  monthly  by  the  project  implementation  consultants.  Project  impact  on  the  conflict \nsituation, if any, will be monitored, and any negative impact will be remedied immediately. The \nproject beneficiaries' satisfaction will be surveyed during and after project implementation. \n \n10.  Project Review \n88.  A project inception mission will be fielded soon after the loan agreements for the Project \nare signed; thereafter, regular reviews will follow at least annually. As necessary, special loan \nadministration missions and a midterm review mission will be fielded, under which any changes \nin scope or implementation arrangement may be required to ensure achievement of project \nobjectives. EPRDD, MLGPC, and NCPRDA will monitor project implementation in accordance \nwith  the  schedule  and  time-bound  milestones,  and  keep  ADB  informed  of  any  significant \ndeviations that may result in the milestones not being met.  \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n89.  In  conjunction  with  the  Project,  a  capacity  development  TA  will  be  provided  to  (i) \nmodernize EPRDD's office, (ii) improve business processes, and (iii) manage road assets. \nLessons learned from the previous institutional development program in NCPRDA will be taken \ninto consideration. As the TA implementation is expected to be relatively simple, the TA falls \nunder category B. The TA is estimated to cost $950,000, of which ADB will finance $800,000 on \na grant basis from the ADB TA funding program (TASF-IV resources). Counterpart staff for the \nTA will be the EPRDD provincial director, NCPRDA general manager, chief engineer of planning \nand monitoring in both provinces, and planning division of both provinces. \n \n90.  The TA will provide required consultant inputs and necessary equipment and facility for \nthe purpose of road asset management. Upgrading the EPRDD office will be financed under the \nLoan. Individual consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants.  Disbursements  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook.17 International consulting inputs of 22 person-months and 14 person-\nmonths of national consulting inputs will be required. The TA will be implemented from March \n2010 to February 2012. The Government will provide office space. The details of the TA, \nincluding the terms of reference, are in Appendix 12.  \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n91.  Overall, the Project will contribute to the improvement of the road sector in Eastern \nProvince  and  NCP  by  improving  transport  efficiency  and  expanding  access  to  economic \nopportunities and public services. The beneficiaries will be people, companies, government \nagencies, and nongovernment agencies that use project road transport services directly and \nindirectly. Communities served by the project roads will benefit from improved, lower-cost, and \n                                                 \n17 ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook. Manila. \n ", "   \nfaster transport services, and thereby obtain improved access to economic opportunities and \nsocial  services.  Transport  operators  carrying both  passengers  and  freight  will  benefit  from \nimproved roads in terms of lower vehicle-operating costs, time-savings, improved road safety, \nand thereby, increased productivity. Government and nongovernment agencies served by the \nproject roads will improve their service delivery due to improved transport efficiency. \n \nA.  Technical Aspect \n92.  The Project will improve about 14% of the provincial road network in Eastern Province \nand 11% in NCP. Road asset management and maintenance will be strengthened. As the \nGovernment relies heavily on external financing for road rehabilitation and reconstruction, the \nProject will have significant impact in the provincial road network in both provinces.  \n \nB.  Institutional Aspect \n93.  The  Project  will  improve  management  of  the  provincial  road  network  through  an \ninstitutional development program, assisted by the capacity development TA. The enhancement \nof  the  provincial  road  agencies\u2019  capacity  for  road  asset  management  will  improve  road \nadministration  governance  and  accountability,  and  create  an  environment  that  encourages \nefficiency and competition. \n \nC.  Economic Aspect \n94.  The overall improvement of the provincial road network will increase transport efficiency. \nThis will contribute to growth of a wide range of economic activities that use road transport \nservices. Without the improvements, traffic will incur high transport operating costs due to poor \nroad conditions. With the improvements, these costs will be reduced. \n \n95.  An economic analysis was carried out using the standard practice, comparing the road \nlifecycle and user costs with and without the Project. Based on the analysis, the proposed \nimprovements were considered economically viable, with an estimated overall economic internal \nrate of return of 28.3%. A sensitivity analysis was also carried out considering the potential \nadverse  scenario\u2014increasing  project  costs  and  reducing  benefits.  The  resulting  economic \ninternal rates of return remained above the 12% threshold. The summary of economic analysis \nis in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n96.  The financial internal rate of return calculation was not required as the Project does not \ngenerate  revenue.  Public  expenditure  review  of  provincial  roads  in  both  provinces  was \ncompleted (Supplementary Appendix F). Assessments were carried out with regard to EPRDD \nand NCPRDA's capacity in planning, budgeting, internal control and audit arrangements, as well \nas financial management and reporting management. Both follow the government accounting \nstandard and general accounting principals. They have the financial management capacity to \neffectively implement the Project. \n \nD.  Environmental Aspect \n97.  The Project is a class B project in accordance with ADB environmental assessment \nrequirements.  Initial  environmental  examinations  were  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nEnvironment Policy (2002) and environmental guidelines. No significant adverse environmental \nimpacts are expected. The project road improvement proposals have been approved by the \nCentral  Environmental  Authority,  and  its  recommendations  have  been  incorporated  in  the \n ", " \nenvironmental  management  plan  as  well  as  bidding  documents.  The  summary  initial \nenvironmental examinations are in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \nE.  Social Aspect \n98.  The inadequate condition of transport services prevents the poor from gaining access to \neconomic opportunities and social services. The Project will improve the road network, thereby \nalleviating  this  constraint.  The  project  roads  serve  the  poorest  provinces  in  the  country\u2014\ncommunities located away from the centers of economic activities. Improvement of the road \nnetwork will open the communities up to a range of new opportunities; increase availability and \nfrequency of transport service; and improve access to markets, employment opportunities, and \nsocial services. They will facilitate movement of goods and people, and will improve livelihood \nactivities of the communities along the roads, including returned internally displaced people. \n \n99.  From experience of a previous project (SPRIP), road improvements will lead to more \nfrequent and reliable bus services, and all passengers benefit from reduced travel time. Faster \ntravel, at lower cost, allows workers to find better work opportunities and to earn more (e.g., \nthrough overtime). Both producers and consumers of agricultural produce will also benefit from \nimproved freight services. \n \n100.  The roads included in the Project were selected upon consideration of their role in \nproviding connectivity to communities, the poverty situation, and coverage of transport services. \nEach road plays a significant role by connecting to local feeder roads, resulting in a wider \nspread of indirect benefits. The benefits are not confined to any specific ethnic or other social \ngroup. Local laborers will have employment opportunities during implementation. \n \n101.  No new roads will be developed, and the road improvement work is within the existing  \nright-of-way. Nevertheless, in the event of unforeseen requirement of land acquisition during \nimplementation, resettlement plans will be prepared following the relevant national laws as well \nas ADB's Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), in accordance with the approved resettlement \nframework (Appendix 13).  \n \n102.  A grievances redress committee will be established within each divisional secretary, \nchaired by the respective divisional secretary, chief engineer, community-level mediation board, \nand community leader. The aim is to resolve issues quickly, amicably, transparently, and out of \ncourts to facilitate project implementation. The resident engineers of the project implementation \nconsultants  will  maintain  a  complaint  register  and  forward  these  to  the  grievance  redress \ncommittee. The details of the grievances and the reasons that led to acceptance or rejection of \nthe particular grievances will be recorded. \n \n103.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in  Appendix  14.  To  enable \ncommunities in the project area to maximize benefits of the Project, a proposal for promoting \ngender-responsive access to road rehabilitation-related opportunities under the Project is being \ndeveloped, to be financed on grant basis from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction.  \n \nF.  Risks \n104.  The major risks for the Project are (i) implementation delays, (ii) delay in releasing \ncounterpart funds, (iii) inadequate post-project road maintenance, and (iv) conflict. The risk of \ninitial delays has been mitigated through ensuring project implementation readiness during \nprocessing.  Feasibility  study,  detailed  design,  and  procurement  assistance  were  provided \n ", "   \nthrough the TA loan for the Road Project Preparatory Facility. Advance actions are being taken \nwith the objective of awarding contracts immediately following the loan signing. The risk of delay \nin releasing counterpart funds has been mitigated by providing 90% financing under the loan, \nleaving the Government with financing only tax and duties.  \n \n105.  Performance-based maintenance after completion will be included in the civil works \ncontracts to secure maintenance of the project roads. Through the capacity development TA \nproject,  EPRDD  and  NCPRDA  road  asset  management  systems  will  be  strengthened  for \nobjective planning and budgeting. A 3-year rolling road maintenance plan will be developed. \nVehicle license fee revenues will be dedicated to routine maintenance. Budgets will be gradually \nincreased to meet maintenance requirements, and EPRDD and NCPRDA's monitoring systems \nfor implementation will minimize the risk of underutilizing these budgets. \n \n106.  There are general risks associated with communal tension and sensitivities, history, \npolitical uncertainty, return of displaced persons, and considerable security staff presence. Also, \nan unforeseen requirement of land acquisition may emerge during implementation, for which a \nresettlement plan will then need to be prepared. The Project is not expected to contribute to \nsocial  tensions,  as  the  beneficial  outcomes  of  the  Project\u2014with  the  JICA-  and  World  \nBank-financed projects\u2014are shared equitably among the major ethnic groups and across the \ntarget area. The Project can potentially make a positive contribution to the rebuilding of the \ninfrastructure in post-conflict-affected areas. \n \n107.  On security, because the east and north have been taken over fully by the Government, \na  serious  threat  is  less  likely.  While  it  is  possible  that  some  events  could  affect  project \nimplementation, it is highly unlikely that there will be any direct threats to the Project. All \ncommunities are likely to see the Project as part of the overall improvement of living conditions \nand the creation of new livelihood opportunities. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n108.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n109.  Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation. The Government will ensure that: \n(i)  EPRDD and NCPRDA will maintain the project roads to a proper standard and \nthe  benefits  of  the  rehabilitated  roads  will  be  realized  over  their  expected \nlifetimes;  \n(ii)  EPC and NCPC will commit all revenues from vehicle license fees to routine road \nmaintenance in their respective provinces; \n(iii)  provincial  road  investment  plans  for  2012\u20132014,  including  road  maintenance \nplans, will be prepared and completed by 30 September 2011; \n(iv)  commencing  in  fiscal  year  2012,  at  least  70%  of  the  required  periodic \nmaintenance financing of the provincial roads, based on the investment plan, will \nbe made available to EPC and NCPC and will be increased by 10% annually until \n100% of the required funds is reached; and \n(v)  EPC and NCPC will release annual allocated funds for road maintenance and \nrehabilitation on a timely basis. \n \n110.  Project Management. The Government, through EPC and NCPC, will provide EPRDD \nand NCPRDA adequate staff, resources, and facilities to implement the Project. \n \n ", " \n111.  Environment. The Government will ensure that EPRDD and NCPRDA will \n(i)  design,  implement,  and  operate  the  Project  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy and the Government\u2019s environmental policy and regulations; \n(ii)  implement mitigation measures identified in the initial environmental examination \nreports in a timely and efficient manner; and \n(iii)  submit to ADB semiannual reports on the implementation of the environmental \nmanagement plans. \n \n112.  Construction Labor. EPRDD and NCPRDA will ensure that contractors will \n(i)  provide appropriate information to construction workers on the risks of sexually \ntransmitted infections and HIV/AIDS;  \n(ii)  provide  safe  and  healthy  working  conditions,  including appropriate  sanitation \nfacilities for female workers;  \n(iii)  comply with all applicable labor laws, including equal pay for equal work, no child \nlabor,  and  provision  of  appropriate  facilities  for  children  of  the  construction \nworkers at construction campsites; and \n(iv)  provide equal opportunities for women and men in the construction activities. \n \n113.  Land Acquisition.  The Government, EPC and NCPC will ensure, and make EPRDD \nand NCPRDA ensure, that:  \n(i)   the  Project  will  make  every  effort  to  avoid  land  acquisition  or  involuntary \nresettlement;  \n(ii)   in the event that any land acquisition or resettlement becomes necessary or any \npotential impact on indigenous peoples is identified, a suitable resettlement plan \nwill be drawn up in accordance with the resettlement framework; in consultation \nwith the affected peoples; with the approval of ADB; in compliance with the \napplicable  national  laws,  regulations,  policies,  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy and Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998); and implemented \nin accordance with its terms; and \n(iii)   a grievances redress mechanism will be established within 3 months after date of \nloan effectiveness to redress any project-related concerns raised by project road \nusers and communities along the project roads. \n \nVII.

Eastern Province \n1.  Eastern Province, along the eastern seaboard of Sri Lanka, has three administrative \ndistricts,  i.e.,  Ampara,  Batticaloa,  and  Trincomalee.  Trincomalee  has  a  natural  deepwater \nharbour, the fifth largest in the world. However, it has been developed only for flour processing, \ncement manufacture, and oil storage facilities. The beaches of Eastern Province are popular \nwith tourists, but current limited access constrains tourism development. The economy relies \nmainly on agriculture, animal husbandry, and fisheries.   \n2.  The  province  had  an  estimated  population  of  1.46  million  in  2007.  Life  in  Eastern \nProvince has been subject to disruptions due to intermittent armed conflicts in the area over the \nlast two decades. Due to the conflict situation, the province was not included in the last poverty \nstudy, however, poverty in the province is among the worst in the country. Per capita income in \n2007 for the province was SLRs119,131 per year, or 66.6% of national per capita income. While \nthe area represents 15% area of the country, its gross domestic product (GDP) in 2007 was \nSLRs177,863, or 4.97% of the national GDP. \n \n1.  Provincial Road Network and Traffic Volume \n3.  The  province\u2019s  road  network  includes  857  kilometers  (km)  of  national  highways,  \n1,098 km of provincial roads, 4,838 km of rural roads, and 3,412 km of other roads. The road \ndensity is 1.02 km/square kilometre (km2), while the national road density is 1.5 km/km2. About \n30% of provincial roads are gravel and earth; only 20% are in good condition. About 65% are in \npoor  or  very  poor  condition,  requiring  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction.  Where  access  is \npossible, riding conditions are poor, vehicle speeds low, and vehicle-operating costs high.  \n4.  In 2007, the estimated fleet of motorized vehicles in Eastern Province was 92,091; this \naccounted for 4.1% of the total fleet in Sri Lanka. From 2003 to 2007, the vehicle fleet in the \nprovince increased at an average annual growth rate of 8.5%. However this growth was mostly \ndue to motorcycles and three-wheelers. The typical average speed on the provincial road \nnetwork is 10 km/hour. \n \n2.  Provincial Road Asset Management \n5.  The Eastern Provincial Road Development Department (EPRDD) is responsible for the \nconstruction, maintenance, and administration of the provincial road network. It is headed by a \nprovincial director who works directly under the authority of the province's secretary of road \ndevelopment. The provincial director is assisted by a deputy director, four chief engineers, a \nchief accountant, an administrative officer, and other support staff. Four executive engineers \nreport to the respective chief engineer in the three districts. \n6.  EPRDD\u2019s  capacity  for  core  processes  requires  strengthening  and  reorganizing, \nespecially in the areas of policy making, planning, and programming. It has not developed a \nproper mechanism for regular road condition assessment, which is required to develop annual \ndevelopment and budgetary plans. The road conditions were assessed based on information \nprovided by EPRDD field officers and complaints made by the public. Only a road inventory is \ncurrently available. \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  25 \n3.  Road Transport Regulation and Industry \n7.  The provincial commissioner of motor traffic, under the chief secretary, administers the \nmotor vehicle fleet. The National Transport Commission Act regulates omnibus transport within \nthe province and provides powers to district government agents within the province.   \n8.  About 500 buses are operating within the province. Bus penetration is among the lowest \nin the country at 278 buses per million people; the national average is around 800 buses per \nmillion.  Forty-seven  dedicated  rural  bus  services  are  subsidized;  payments  are  made  on \ncertification of delivery and attainment of standards monitored by a local user committee. These \nprovide important connections between rural and town centers within the province.  \n9.  No regulatory provisions are in place for other vehicles operating within the province for \nfee or reward. Two-wheeler or hand tractors are used extensively, as are small trucks and vans. \nTrucking is deregulated and independent small-scale operators provide vehicles ranging from  \n2 ton to multiaxle container flat beds. Rates are competitive. The railway provides one mixed \ngoods trains each to Trincomalee and Batticaloa, mostly used for the transport of flour, fuel, and \ncement. About 72% of households have a bicycle.  \n \n4.  Provincial Road Expenditure and Revenue \n10.  Road  sector  expenditure  in  Eastern  Province  is  mainly  funded  from  the  central \nGovernment, foreign funds, and provincial revenues. Of these, the major source of funding for \nEPRDD is the Block Grant and Province Specific Development Grant (PSDG); the central \nGovernment allocates both through the provincial budget.  \n \nTable A2.1: Utilization of Road Capital Funds \n    Rs Million \nSource  2004 2005 2006 2007  2008 Oct.\nProvince Specific  Allocation  42.4 100.7 116.6 170.8  175.0\nDevelopment Grants \u2013  Expenditure  40.0 75.3 56.2 85.4  53.1\nProvincial Roads  Utilization (%)  94.3 74.8 48.2 50.0  30.3\nSource: Eastern Provincial Road Development Department. \n11.  EPRDD was not able to fully utilize the PSDG or meet the criteria based on matching \ngrants during 2004\u20132008. This is largely because the allocations were not released to the \nprovincial  council  or  were  released  only  during  the  latter  part  of  the  year,  thus  making \ncompletion of all the planned work programs difficult.  \n12.  EPRDD executes routine maintenance work on the provincial road network and operates \nferry services by using the Block Grant received from the Treasury. Allocations for maintenance \nare irregular, and expenditure utilization is inconsistent. Utilization varies sharply from year to \nyear with a low of 50% in 2005 and a high of 96.5% in 2006.  \n \nTable A2.2: Utilization of Road Maintenance Funds \n    Rs Million \nSource  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008 Oct. \nBlock Grant: Road  Allocation  31.8 31.8 42.4 22.3  40.0\nMaintenance Component  Expenditure  31.7 15.9 40.9 19.8  17.2\nUtilization (%)  99.7 50.0 96.5 88.8  43.0\nSource: Eastern Provincial Road Development Department. \n ", "26  Appendix 2 \n \nB.  North Central Province \n13.  North  Central  Province  (NCP)  has  two  administrative  districts:  Anuradhapura  and \nPolonnaruwa,  named  after  their  capital  cities.  Both  cities  have  an  ancient  history  with \nAnuradhapura dating to the 4th century BC and Polonnaruwa from the 11th to 13th century AD. \nThe ruins of these cities are designated as cultural heritage sites and are immensely popular \nwith international and local tourists.  \n14.  The province is located in the low-country dry zone; flat terrain prevails across most \nparts of the province and the land tends to be dry tropical woodlands. NCP has more than \n10,000  tanks,  or  small  water  reservoirs,  which  sometimes  interconnect  to  comprise  one \ncontinuous water reservoir system. The Mahaweli River Development Scheme irrigates a large \narea of dry woodlands now contributing to more than 20% of paddy production in the country. \nMore  than  75,000  families  have  settled  in  new  townships  in  the area  during  the  last  two \ndecades.  \n15.  The province had an estimated population of 1.1 million in 2007, or 103 people/km2, the \nlowest population density in the country. It also has the largest land area at 10,531 km2. The \narea presently contributes more than 20% of the country's paddy production, in addition to \nvegetables and animal husbandry. Its share of the national GDP is around 4%; per capita \nincome in 2007 was SLRs117,384, which was 65.7% of the national level, and it has one of the \nlowest GDP growth rates. Approximately 245,000 people (17.5%) live below the poverty line \ncompared with 15% nationally.  \n \n1.  Provincial Road Network and Traffic Volume \n16.  NCP\u2019s road network includes 1,141 km of national highways, 1,951 km of provincial \nroads, 11,835 km of rural roads, and 1,173 km of other roads. Road density is 0.84 km/km2, far \nbelow the national average of 1.5 km/km2. About 22% of provincial roads require reconstruction, \n18% require rehabilitation, 38% are in fair condition, and 22% in good condition. The provincial \nroad network comprises 741.5 km of gravel-surfaced roads and 1,230.5 km of metalled and \ntarred roads. The network has 84 bridges and 944 culverts and other road-related assets. The \nmajority of provincial roads are single lane of 2\u20134 meters. Most provincial roads provide an \nimportant link between national roads connecting consumer areas and local roads connecting \nrural agricultural production areas. They are an essential component of the provision of rural\u2013\nurban linkages. Most such routes support bus service. As the road network is the main transport \nmode in the province, it needs to be improved to balance disparities within the province and \nkeep up with national economic growth. \n17.  In 2007, NCP had a fleet of about 104,810 motorized vehicles, accounting for 4.7% of \nthe total fleet in Sri Lanka. From 2003 to 2007, the vehicle fleet in NCP increased at an average \nannual  rate  of  16.6%;  most  of  this  growth  was  from  motorcycles  and  three-wheelers.  On \nprovincial roads, traffic volume generally ranges from 500 to 1,000 vehicles per day. Four-\nwheeled or larger vehicles typically make up 30% of traffic. Average speeds on the provincial \nroad network are 20 km/hr.  \n \n2.  Provincial Road Asset Management \n18.  The North Central Provincial Roads Development Authority (NCPRDA) is responsible for \nthe construction, maintenance, and administration of the provincial road network. It is headed by \na board of directors; one member is appointed as the chairperson. The general manager is ", "  Appendix 2  27 \nresponsible  for  execution  of  the  work  program  and  administration.  Two  deputy  general \nmanagers are responsible for engineering and for financial and human resource development. \nThe deputy general manager (engineering) deals with operation functions of road works with the \nassistance  of  three  chief  engineers:  two  handle  operations  in  the  four  divisions  under  an \nexecutive engineer. The other chief engineer (planning, design, and quality control) is supported \nby four executive engineers for planning, design, and quality control works.  \n19.  Business procedures have improved with the establishment of NCPRDA, according to \nproposals made under the Institutional Development Program of the Road Sector Development \nProject. Since NCPRDA has a board of management, it is authorized to take certain decisions \nregarding procurement and biding procedures, quality control, assets management, and project \nmanagement of approved works programs. A software program for maintaining a road inventory \nand condition database for provincial road network is in place. \n20.  NCPRDA has a reasonably well-equipped quality control laboratory. They have staff \nincluding a chief engineer and an executive engineer for quality control. The Road Sector \nDevelopment  Project  provides  some  laboratory  equipment.  However,  NCPRDA  needs  to \ncontinue  regular  road  condition  assessment  and  updating  of  its  database,  which  will  give \nobjective information on maintenance and rehabilitation priorities. \n \n3.  Road Transport Regulation and Industry \n21.  The Central Province Road Passenger Transport Authority was set up by statute to \nregularize the provision of omnibus transport together with the Department of Motor Traffic, and \nto collect revenue licenses of the vehicles registered within the province. About 1,100 buses \nprovide public transport within NCP. The 56 dedicated rural bus services are subsidized with \npayment made on certification of delivery and attainment of standards monitored by a local user \ncommittee.  \n22.  Other vehicles operating within the province for fee or reward such as school vans, office \nvans, and three-wheelers or taxis are regulated by Act No. 3 of 2006 and by Gazette No. 1518 \nof 2007. Trucking is deregulated and rates are competitive. The railway provides two goods \ntrains mostly used for transport of fuel and cement.  \n23.  The  Provincial  Motor  Traffic  Department  issues  annual  revenue  licenses  for  motor \nvehicles registered to addresses within the province and collects such revenues. Bicycles are \nthe most common vehicle; 80.1% of households possess a bicycle.  \n \n4.  Provincial Roads Expenditure and Revenue \n24.  Road sector expenditure in NCP is funded from central Government funds, foreign \nfunds, and provincial revenue. Of these, the major source of funding is the Block Grant and \nPSDG,  which  the  central  Government  allocates  through  the  provincial  budget.  Being  an \nauthority, NCPRDA is able to collect revenue for certain services such as for reinstatement of \nroad damage by utility agencies. NCP collected SLRs148 million (about 22% of total income) \nfrom  annual  vehicle  revenue  license  fees.  This  income  is  obtained  by  the  Treasury  and \nreallocated under general expenditure to different ministries through the budget.  \n25.  Capital expenditure for provincial roads such as improvement and rehabilitation are \nfunded through the PSDG on a work program submitted by NCPRDA and as agreed to by the \nFinance Commission. NCPRDA was not able to fully utilize the PSDG during 2004\u20132008. This ", "28  Appendix 2 \n \nlargely resulted because the funds were not released to the provincial council or were released \nonly during the latter part of the year.  \n \nTable A2.3: Utilization of Road Capital Funds \nRs Million \nSource   \n2004  2005  2006  2007  2008 Oct. \nProvincial Specific  Allocation  140.0 230.0 285.0  375.0  250.0\nDevelopment Grants \u2013  Expenditure  112.5 170.2 192.8  170.0  160.0\nProvincial Roads  Utilization (%)  80.4 74.0 67.6  45.3  64.0\nSource: North Central Provincial Road Development Authority. \n \n26.  Maintenance  of  roads  is  funded  by  the  Block  Grant  received  from  the  central \nGovernment.  No  regular  allocations  were  made  for  maintenance  during  2004\u20132007.  The \nutilization of the Block Grant varies sharply from year to year with a low of 31.8% in 2007 and a \nhigh of 92.3% in 2006. Even though release of the funds is not cited as a reason unlike the case \nof capital expenditure, it is charged that most of the due funds reach NCPRDA only during the \nlatter part of the year making execution of all annual plans difficult before the end of year.  \n \nTable A2.4: Utilization of Road Maintenance Funds \nRs Million \nSource   \n2004  2005  2006  2007  2008 Oct. \nAllocation  35.0 40.0 80.0  50.0  75.0\nBlock Grant-Road \nExpenditure  30.8 19.4 73.8  15.9  \u2014\nMaintenance Component \nUtilization (%)  88.0 48.5 92.3  31.8  \u2014\nSource: North Central Provincial Road Development Authority.

\n \n \nA.  Design Criteria \n1.  Design Standards and Guidelines. The Project consists of class C and D roads within \nthe provincial road network. The following design standards and guidelines, established in \nconsultation with the Road Development Authority (RDA) and provincial road agency officials, \nare applied: \n \n(i)  Cross section: (a) Road Design Manual and Bridge Design Manual\u2014RDA's \nstandard; (b) AASHTO\u2014Geometric Design of Highways and Streets 5th edition \n(2004); (c) TRL\u2014Overseas Road Note 6, A Guide to Geometric Design (1988), \nand (d) Austroads\u2014Rural Road Design (2003). \n \n(ii)  Bridges: RDA's Sri Lanka Bridge Design Manual of 1997, based on the British \nStandards Code of Practice for Bridge Design (BS5400:1990). \n \n(iii)  Pavement:  (a)  Transport  Research  Laboratory\u2019s  Road  Note  31,  4th  Edition \n(TRL-RN31), basis of RDA's pavement design process;  (b) AASHTO Pavement \nDesign Guide, and (c) design life for new pavements: 10-year life with provision \nfor overlays during or at the end of that period to extend the life to 15\u201320 years. \n \n(iv)  Drainage: RDA's standards incorporating relevant standards from AASHTO and \nthe British Standard Design Manual for Roads and Bridges. \n \n2.  Pavement Treatment. Existing road pavement consists of either bituminous surface or \nunsealed gravel. Many roads have mixed sections of bituminous and gravel. Some sections of \nbituminous  pavements  have  deteriorated  as  gravel.  Double  bituminous  surface  treatment \n(DBST) will be applied to all projects roads. \n \n3.  Cross  Section.  Road  cross  sections  vary  depending  on  projected  traffic  volume, \ngeometric  condition,  and  terrain.  In  general,  the  cross  section  consists  of  carriageway  \n4.5\u20136.5  meters  (m),  shoulder  1.0\u20131.5  m  each  side,  with  drainage  and  berm  as  required. \nSidewalks (typically 1.2 m wide) for bridges are considered on a case-by-case basis, depending \non bridge length, location, and pedestrian and traffic volume. Use of the existing road corridor \n(existing road cross section and provision for utilities) is maximized to achieve the optimal \ncombination of economy and desired road improvement without land acquisition. \n \n4.  Alignment and Traffic Facilities. In general, the proposed improvements follow the \nexisting horizontal and vertical alignment. The only minor changes are applied to the horizontal \nalignment for very short sections to enhance road safety, to ease the radius of curves, or \nminimize blind spots. The road safety aspects relate mostly to localized sections of the road \nalignments. In densely populated areas, roads, bridges, and associated sidewalks are made \naccessible for all, including the disabled. \n \n5.  Road Safety. The road safety aspects are related mostly to localized sections of the \nalignments. Based on the road safety inspections, carried out on all roads during the field \nevaluation, the detailed design, wherever possible, incorporates improvements to road width \nand alignment, including installing precautionary speed signs to slow down for oncoming curves \nor low speed areas. ", "32  Appendix 4 \n \n6.  Drainage. To minimize local flooding or ponding, side drains are reconstructed to direct \nsurface flows away from road pavements and linked to streams or watercourses. For existing \ndrainage structures (retained or repaired), the waterways are restored by removing settled \nmaterials and debris.  \n \n7.  Bridges. Improvements comprise repairing and or replacing existing bridge structures, \nincluding  structural  renovation  of  substructure  and  superstructure  elements  together  with \ninstallation or repair of guardrails and improvement of causeways and vented drifts. The work \ninvolves five major existing bridges with overall length greater than 20 m and three major \nbridges  comprising  steel  frame  or  composite  plate  girder  construction.  Materials  and \nconstruction  methods  are  in  accordance  with  Technical  Specifications,  Part  1  Standard \nSpecification  for  Construction  and  Maintenance  of  Roads  and  Bridges  1989  (Sri  Lanka), \nmodified to suit project requirements. \n \nB.  Province-Specific Improvement Design \n8.  Eastern Province. Existing cross sections, in general, have a narrow carriageway width \nof 3.5\u20134.0 m. Most roads have existing seal, gravel and seal, or gravel surfaces. All road \nsurfaces have many potholes with existing seal breaking up. Improvements will provide a right-\nof-way of 7.5\u201310.0 m, increasing the carriageway width to a minimum of 4.5 m and up to 6.0 m \nwith  shoulders  of  1.0\u20131.5  m.  All  roads  will  be  improved  with  DBST  surface  treatment. \nImprovements include repairing or replacing 36 bridges along the project roads. \n \n9.  North Central Province. Existing cross sections, in general, have narrow carriageway \nwidth of 3.5\u20134.0 m. Most roads have existing seal, gravel and seal, or gravel surface. All road \nsurfaces have many potholes with poor surface condition. Improvements will provide a right-of-\nway generally of 7.5\u201310.5 m, increasing the carriageway width to a minimum of 4.5 m and up to \n6.5 m with shoulders of 1.0\u20131.5 m. All road surfaces will be improved with DBST surface \ntreatment. Improvements include repairing or replacing 24 bridges along the project roads. \n ", "   \nINDICATIVE CONTRACT PACKAGES \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\n 5\n3           \n  3\n ", " \n3\n4\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\n 5\n \n \nNCB = national competitive bidding, pkg = package, rd = road. \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff in consultation with Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Councils, Provincial Road Development Department, and \nProvincial Road Development Authority (detail design stage). \n ", "  Appendix 6  35\nCONFLICT AWARENESS ASSESSMENT \n \n1.  The Project, aiming to improve provincial roads, is an integral part of the Government\u2019s \nMahinda  Chinthana  (nationally)  and  Eastern  Revival  plan  for  Eastern  Province.  Road \nimprovements in Eastern Province and its adjacent North Central Province (NCP) are badly \nneeded to support economic and social development. Such infrastructure improvements also \nappear to be welcomed by all communities in both provinces, as long as they are perceived to \nbe equitably distributed geographically and benefit all communities (both in terms of generating \nemployment and facilitating commerce and access to markets and services). The project team \nhas engaged in several consultations to ensure stakeholder participation and acceptance. While \nunder  the  Project,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  finance  the  improvement  of \nprovincial roads in two districts of Eastern Province, namely Batticaloa and Trincomalee, the \nWorld Bank will cover Ampara, the remaining district. More broadly, nationally, the Project is \nclosely coordinated with similar projects of both the World Bank and the Japan International \nCooperation  Agency  to  ensure  national  conflict  sensitivity  of  overall  provincial  road \nimprovement. \n \nA.  Background \n \n2.  Eastern Province experienced some of the worst violence in Sri Lanka\u2019s decades-long \nconflict, although the situation in the province has stabilized since the Sri Lankan Government \nliberated the east from control by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in July 2007. Sri \nLanka\u2019s Eastern Province is unique in its demographics: Tamils account for about 40% of the \ntotal population, Moslems account for 38%, and Sinhalese about 22%. However, the balance \nbetween  the  three  communities  varies  significantly  over  Eastern  Province\u2019s  three  districts: \nTrincomalee (46% Moslem, 29% Tamil, 25% Sinhalese), Batticaloa (25% Moslem, 75% Tamil, \nless than 1% Sinhalese), and Ampara (44% Moslem, 18% Tamil, 37% Sinhalese). \n \n3.  Elections to the Eastern Provincial Council were held on 10 May 2008, and the first \nsession  of  the  Eastern  Provincial  Council  took  place  in  Trincomalee  on  4  June  2008. \nDevelopment  in  Eastern  Province  is  a  high  priority  for  the  national  Government.  The \nGovernment\u2019s 3-year Eastern Revival development plan focuses on resettlement of internally \ndisplaced persons, revitalizing the regional economy, improving infrastructure, supporting social \nrehabilitation and improved housing, and rebuilding public institutions. The plan is seen as \ncritical to the long-term stability of the province (and, indeed, of the country as a whole), to gain \nsupport of the Tamil and Moslem communities who form a majority in the region, and to prevent \na return to armed conflict. While much activity is under way to develop the economy and rebuild \nthe infrastructure of Eastern Province, reconciliation among the communities in this post-conflict \nperiod will inevitably require time. \n \n4.  In NCP, the population is more than 90% Sinhalese, less than 2% Tamil, and 5%\u201310% \nMoslem. NCP has experienced sporadic violence over the years, mainly because it borders \nNorthern and Eastern Provinces, which have been the main focus of the conflict with the LTTE. \nFor  the  past  two  decades,  development  in  NCP  has  been  constrained  by  the  province\u2019s \nproximity to the conflict. \n \n5.  The Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy and conflict sensitivity \nguidelines. Nationally, it balances development in conflict-affected regions with development in \nother  parts  of  the  country,  both  directly  through  ADB-supported  activities  and  through \ncoordination with the support of other key development partners. Secondly, ADB has taken \nsteps to ensure equity in the spread of benefits and opportunities created by the Project (across ", "36  Appendix 6 \nboth communal and geographic lines). ADB has coordinated provincial road improvement plans \nwith those of the World Bank and the Japan International Cooperation Agency to ensure wider \ncoverage of such improvements. Also, ADB has coordinated with other development partners in \ncomplementary  training  and  capacity-building  activities  to  strengthen  road  agencies  and \ncontractors, as well as develop skills to assist local labor to participate actively in project \nimplementation. \n \nB.  Security Situation \n \n6.  Government plans to normalize security in the province are under way, and the number \nof military- and police-based checkpoints in Trincomalee and Batticaloa is being reduced. The \npresence of security in the provinces is expected to decrease over time, especially following the \nrecent military victory over the LTTE in the north. This will positively affect commerce and \neconomic development in Eastern Province. While the presence of paramilitary groups has \nbeen a cause of concern and tension in Eastern Province, the Government is moving ahead \nwith plans to disarm and/or integrate armed groups into the police and military. \n \n7.  People seem to be relieved that the situation is relatively stable, but uncertainty (and, \ntherefore, apprehension) about the future remains. Some of the underlying factors causing \ntensions in Eastern Province are still present, however, the trend on the security front has been \npositive.  \n \n8.  The scenarios for the near future of Eastern Province are varied, and, while some events \ncould affect project implementation at some point, direct threats to the Project are not likely. All \ncommunities are likely to see the Project as part of the overall improvement of living conditions \nand the creation of new livelihood opportunities. \n \n9.  As the security situation in the Northern Province normalizes, when the A9 (the main \nnorth\u2013south highway) is fully opened, and as development plans move steadily forward in the \nnorth, then NCP should benefit. \n \nC.  Project Context \n \n10.  Because the Project is intended to improve existing provincial roads (and is creating no \nnew ones), it does not involve any resettlement issues; and no land is to be claimed for it. This \nis important as land issues have often been a key factor behind the conflict. \n \n11.  The roads to be improved are based on a list submitted to ADB by NCP and Eastern \nProvince. In the case of Eastern Province, the selection of roads and the rationale and criteria \nused in their selection was discussed with the Provincial Council following its election. \n \n12.  While disputes over issues such as land and water surrounding some development \nprojects in Eastern Province have led to tensions between communities, road development \nprojects  seem  to  be  universally  welcome  and  viewed  positively,  as  long  as  they  are  not \nperceived to benefit any one group at the expense of others. \n \n13.  As the Project is implemented, ADB will be mindful of equity in the schedule on which \nimprovements  are  made.  The  Project  has  been  designed  in  ways  that  will  benefit  all \ncommunities reasonably equally (or at least will not favor some at the perceived expense of \nothers), but the implementation is another dimension of the Project that ADB will monitor.  \n ", "  Appendix 6  37\n \nD.  Conclusion \n \n14.  Eastern Province is the most complex region of Sri Lanka, with a history of communal \ntension, violence, displacement (and return of internally displaced people), and land disputes. At \npresent, any development partner should be aware of the general risks associated with historic \ntensions. Conflict sensitivity considerations are essential for projects in Eastern Province in this \npost-conflict  period.  However,  road  projects,  as  long  as  they  are  implemented  with  an \nawareness of the prevailing sensitivities among the communities, are not likely to be a great risk \n(certainly less so than projects in some other sectors). Furthermore, the economic situation in \nNCP is likely to improve, and better provincial roads will be a significant factor.

Project Background \n \n1.  The Project consists of the rehabilitation of about 370 kilometers (km) of provincial roads \nin  Eastern  Province  (Batticaloa  and  Trincomalee  districts)  and  North  Central  Province \n(Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa districts), and the rehabilitation or replacement of 33 minor \nbridges. The Project is designed to use only the existing right-of-way (ROW), about 7\u20138 meters. \nAll rehabilitation components related to roads and bridges such as the carriage way, pavement, \nand drainage facilities will be within the existing ROW. The consultant engineers and engineers \nof provincial road agencies of each province jointly conducted field assessments to determine \nroad rehabilitation needs and possible permanent and temporary land acquisition and other \nresettlement  impacts  of  selected  roads.  The  assessment  process  involved  measuring  the \nexisting  ROW  and  pavement  widths;  identifying  existing  drainage  deficiencies;  taking \nphotographs; and measuring bridge dimensions including span length, deck width, and water \nlevel at bridge sites. In the absence of recent land survey drawings and maps prepared by the \nprovincial road agency or survey department indicating the existing ROW and road boundaries \nfor  each  road,  consultant  engineers  and  the  staff  of  provincial  road  agencies  determined \nwhether the existing road corridor of each road is adequate to meet rehabilitation requirements \nof  selected  roads  and  bridges.  In  the  case  of  bridges,  the  Project  will  not  increase  the \ncarriageway width. However, some bridges that are unsafe and cannot be repaired will be \nreplaced with new bridges. Based on the information available from the engineers' assessments \nand  using  their  guidance,  resettlement  specialists  carried  out  sample  surveys,  rapid \nassessments based on field observations, walk-through surveys and discussions with local \naffected people. \n \n2.  Although  the  project  feasibility  study  (July  2008)  and  detailed  engineering  study \n(February 2009) indicate that no land acquisition is required for the purposes of the Project, \nexact actual permanent and temporary impacts from the rehabilitation works will be known only \nduring project implementation. The rehabilitation works could have some impacts on lands and \nbuildings  adjacent  to  the  boundary  walls,  drainages,  and  canals.  Moreover,  some  land \nacquisition might be required for the construction of new bridges. The common feature of rural \nroads is that pavements, shoulders, and side drains are very narrow or nonexistent in some \nroad sections so that the implementing agencies may decide to acquire minimum land for \nproper rehabilitation works. Services relocation such as shifting of telephone and electricity \ntransmission lines may require land acquisition. Some road sections in semi-urban and urban \nareas may require widening and realignment to ensure road safety and smooth traffic flow. In \nsuch cases, the project implementing agencies will formulate short resettlement plans and \nsubmit  them  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  review  and  approval  before  any \nconstruction work in the road section is started. The potential number of households or the land \narea acquired in such a situation would be small based on field assessments.  \n \n3.   This  resettlement  framework  was  formulated  to  ensure  that  if  land  acquisition \n(permanent or temporary), physical relocation, and other impacts are identified during project \nimplementation,  appropriate  compensation  and  relocation  programs  will  be  prepared  and \nimplemented to meet Sri Lankan laws, National Involuntary Resettlement Policy (2001), and \nADB's Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) requirement.           \n \n \n \n ", "52  Appendix 13 \nB.  Policy Framework and Entitlements \n \n4.  The  policy  framework  and  entitlements  specific  to  the  Project  are  based  on  the \nrequirements of the Government of Sri Lanka, principally the Land Acquisition Act (1950 and \nrevised in 1979) and the National Involuntary Resettlement Policy, and also ADB\u2019s Involuntary \nResettlement Policy. The policy principles adopted for the Project include the following:  \n(i)  Avoid, minimize, and mitigate negative land acquisition and resettlement impacts \nby reviewing alternatives for the Project.  \n(ii)  If involuntary resettlement is unavoidable, displaced people should be assisted to \nreestablish themselves and improve their quality of life.  \n(iii)  Gender quality and equity should be ensured and adhered to throughout the \npolicy.  \n(iv)  Affected  people  should  be  fully  involved  in  the  selection  of  relocation  sites, \nlivelihood compensation, and development options at the earliest opportunity; \ncash compensation will be used since the Project would require only a small \namount of land, if any.  \n(v)  Cash compensation at replacement cost will be paid for any privately owned strip \nof land before commencement of construction works. \n(vi)  Compensation for structures and other assets should be based on replacement \ncost1 including  transaction  costs,  and  should  be  paid  promptly  before  the \ncommencement of construction works.  \n(vii)  Land acquisition, compensation, and relocation, if required, should be planned \nand implemented with full participation of the provincial and local authorities and \nthe affected people.  \n(viii)  Affected  people  who  do  not  have  document  title  to  land  are  eligible  for \ncompensation as stated in the entitlement matrix.  \n(ix)  Vulnerable groups affected by the Project should be identified and provided with \nappropriate assistance to substantially improve their living standards.  \n(x)  The  Government  should  bear  full  costs  of  land  acquisition,  compensation, \nrelocation, and improvement of living standards of affected vulnerable groups. \n \n5.  People affected by the Project will be identified and categorized in each entitlement \nmatrix of the subproject short resettlement plan to provide various types of compensation and \nresettlement assistance that will help in the restoration of their livelihoods, at least, to preproject \nstandards.  The  matrix  in  Table  A13  shows  broad  categories  of  properties  affected  and \nentitlements.  \n \n6.   The main categories of potential impacts include (i) loss of land, (ii) boundary walls and \nfences  to  be  reconstructed,  (iii)  residential  and/or  commercial  structures  affected  (fully  or \npartially), (iv) services relocation, and (v) land used for alternate structures as the bridges for \npedestrians during the construction of new bridges. \n                                                 \n1  Replacement cost means the cost of replacement of lost assets and income. If land, it means the cost of buying \nreplacement land near the lost land with equal productive potential plus the cost of preparing the land to levels \nsimilar to those of the affected land and cost of any registration and transfer taxes. If structures, it means current \nmarket value of building materials, required labor without deduction for depreciation and/or salvageable materials. \nFor crops and trees, it will be based on economic production, age, and type.

Procedures  \n \n7.  For each road to be rehabilitated or bridge to be rebuilt, the implementing agency will \nascertain actual resettlement impacts including land acquisition requirements and relocation \ncost estimates. The following checklist will be helpful to identify resettlement impacts: \n \n(i)  Will the rehabilitation works require any land acquisition? \n(ii)  Who owns the land and who uses the land? \n(iii)  If private land, how many owners and/or users (tenants and/or sharecroppers) \nare affected? \n(iv)  If the affected land is state land, are there any encroachers or squatters? \n(v)  Will any houses, structures, trees, and crops be affected? \n(vi)  Will any households and commercial structures need to be physically replaced? \n(vii)  Will indigenous people, ethnic minorities, and/or poorest groups be affected?   ", "54  Appendix 13 \n8.  In preparing a resettlement plan, the following procedures must be followed: \n \n(i)  Carry out consultations with various stakeholders to obtain their advice to avoid \nor minimize impacts and to identify the needs and preferences of those affected. \n(ii)  Undertake  census  (100%  coverage),  asset  inventory,  detailed  measurement \nsurveys, and a socioeconomic survey of a sample population.  \n(iii)  Analyze data to identify different categories of affected people based on the \ndegree and scale of impacts of the subproject.  \n(iv)  Formulate a time-bound schedule for implementation, procedures for grievance \nredress, monitoring and evaluation procedures, and budget. \n(v)  Prepare a draft short resettlement plan following the entitlements matrix. If new \ncategories  of  affected  people  and  types  of  losses  are  identified,  these \nentitlements will be included in the resettlement plan in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy. \n(vi)  Translate into local languages and discuss the draft resettlement plan during \nconsultation  and  public  meetings  for  comments.  Incorporate  comments  and \nsuggestions in the final resettlement plan and disclose it to the affected people. \n(vii)  Submit the resettlement plan to ADB for review and concurrence. The approved \nresettlement plan will be implemented before the award of construction contracts.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements, Consultation, and Grievance Mechanisms \n \n9.  The implementing agencies (IAs) are Eastern Provincial Road Development Department \nand North Central Provincial Road Development Authority. Ministry of Local Government and \nProvincial Councils will be responsible for overall coordination of the Project through its project \ncoordination unit. A national resettlement specialist will be recruited as necessary. \n  \n10.  Grievances pertaining to resettlement impacts will be handled by the grievances redress \ncommittee  established  under  the  chairperson  of  the  divisional  secretary  in  each  divisional \nsecretary  area  with  the  assistance  of  the  Grama  Niladhari  (rural  officers)  and  community \nmediation board in villages and IAs. \n \n11.  Resettlement plans will be disclosed through the IAs' field offices and local Grama \nNiladhari offices. IAs will carry out their own internal monitoring activities and submit quarterly \nprogress reports to the project coordination unit and ADB, reporting progress on planning and \nimplementation of resettlement plans.. \n \nE.  Resettlement Financing \n \n12.  The  provincial  councils  will  bear  the  associated  costs  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement, if any. The estimated cost will include measures for (i) planning and budgeting for \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  costs,  annual  budget,  sources  of  funding;  \n(ii) arrangements for approval of plan cost estimates; and (iii) the flow of funds to reach people \naffected without delay in the event of land acquisition or any other resettlement impact. \n \nF.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n13.  The monitoring and evaluation mechanisms will be included in the resettlement plan, if \nany, to monitor the effectiveness of resettlement plan implementation. The external monitoring \nand evaluation activities will be carried out, as required, by a consultant to be engaged on an \nintermittent basis, as necessary, under the Project.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nSri Lanka is on track to achieve the Millennium Development Goal for reducing poverty. However, conflicts that \nbegan in 1983 and the tsunami in 2004 have devastated much of the north and east of the country. This has \naggravated the already high income and other social indicator differentials between these two regions and the \nrest of the country. The goal of the Government\u2019s national development plan is to achieve high economic growth \nthat benefits the entire population and leads to the social development of the country. To achieve this goal, the \nGovernment\u2019s  strategy.  Mahinda  Chinthana\u2013Sri  Lanka  (adopted  in  2007)  focuses  on  (i)  strengthening  the \ninvestment  climate,  and  (ii)  achieving  socially  inclusive  and  regionally  balanced  growth.  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership strategy 2009\u20132011 recognizes that achieving high and equitable growth will be vital to reduce \npoverty further. One of the key obstacles to growth that the country partnership strategy identifies is a serious \ninfrastructure bottleneck, especially the current transport network that does not provide adequate connectivity \nbetween global and domestic markets.  \nThe Project will improve connectivity in the transport networks of two relatively poor and conflict-affected \nprovinces: Eastern Province and North Central Province (NCP). The provision of improved roads\u2014in conjunction \nwith a range of other carefully coordinated measures proposed in the country partnership strategy and designed \nto strengthen administrative and absorptive capacity in the poorer regions\u2014will contribute to poverty reduction by \nencouraging farmers to diversify their incomes by selling higher-value products or providing labor in nearby \nmarkets. Road network improvements will increase agricultural productivity by improving the supply of key inputs \nsuch as seeds, fertilizers, and technical services. By reducing local travel costs and travel times, the Project will \nfacilitate regular and timely attendance at schools, faster and more regular access to health centers, as well as \neasier access to local government departments and other service providers, thereby further stimulating the kinds \nof investments that will strengthen regional development. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1.  Key Issues. In 2006, Sri Lanka ranked 104th of 179 countries according to the United Nations' human \ndevelopment index (HDI). Similarly, of the 157 countries with both HDI and gender-related development index \nvalues, Sri Lanka ranks 92nd.a The national poverty incidence in Sri Lanka has remained static at around 22% \nsince the 1990s. Poverty reduction has been slow during the past decade and uneven across sectors\u2014rapid in \nthe urban sector, but slow or stagnant in rural and estate sectors. Poverty in rural areas is consistently higher \nthan in urban areas, and national development-related achievements often conceal large discrepancies between \nindividual districts and/or provinces. About 5% of the total project beneficiary population is urban, while the \nremaining 95% is rural. \nClimatic and agroecological conditions are more or less similar in both Eastern Province and NCP. Both regions \ndepend on the northeast monsoons (November to February) for water, and experience prolonged periods of \ndrought during the summer months. This has led to the development of agriculture-based livelihood systems that \ncombine both irrigated and rain-fed paddy cultivation with \"chena\" farming (slash-and-burn or shifting cultivation) \nmarked by the annual planting of coarse grains, legumes, oilseeds, and vegetables. More that 200,000 of Sri \nLanka\u2019s poorest families depend on chena cultivation for subsistence. Every year, if and when the rains come, \ncrops and vegetables flood the market at the same time causing prices to drop.  \nThe causes of poverty in Sri Lanka are complex and interlinked. The probability of being poor decreases with \nmarket  integration,  educational  attainment,  and  the  availability  and  quality  of  basic  infrastructure  such  as \nelectricity, roads, and water and sanitation. The poverty head count index among influential areas of candidate \nroads in NCP ranges from 14 to 31. In Eastern Province, the poverty head count index ranges from 17 to 46. ", "56  Appendix 14 \nBased on the 2001 assessment by the Department of Census and Statistics, 156,000 people in Anuradhapura \ndistrict (NCP), and 89,000 in Polonnaruwa district (NCP) live below the poverty line. Less than half of the \npopulation has access to electricity and less than 10% use gas for cooking. The most common cooking fuel is \nfirewood.  \n2.  Design Features  \nThe Project's main pro-poor design feature is the devolution of management responsibilities to the provincial \nauthorities and the provision of assistance in support of their mandate to facilitate the achievement of sustainable \nand equitable human development through participatory systems of good governance and local administration. \nOther features include specific clauses in the contract documents to encourage civil works contractors to employ \nlocal workers including women during the construction and maintenance phases, and to ensure that contractors \ncomply with all applicable labor laws, including elimination of gender differentiated wages.  \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \nKey Issues. Due to the long prevailing conflict in Sri Lanka, the livelihoods of people in much of the north and \neast of the country have been devastated. These regions, especially Eastern Province, were also affected by the \ntsunami that ravaged so much of coastal South and Southeast Asia in December 2004. Although the north and \neast combined made up about 14% of the population on the island in 2003, the regional economy contributed \nonly 8% of national gross domestic product. Agriculture and fisheries continue to make up a significant part of the \neconomy, but the importance of the sector has eroded during the conflict years. Before the conflict, paddy, \nonions, chilies, tobacco, fruits, dairy products, and fish were sold in significant quantities to other parts of the \ncountry. However, due to transportation difficulties and the trade embargo, commercial agriculture throughout \nmuch of the region was transformed into subsistence agriculture.  \nEastern Province roads in particular are seriously dilapidated. No rehabilitation and little maintenance have been \ncarried out for the last decade or more. This seriously impedes efforts to reduce poverty along with other \ndevelopment interventions planned for the region. However, with provincial elections in Eastern Province having \ngone ahead as planned on 10 May 2008, the prospect of political stability and development is enhanced there \nand in neighboring regions. Trincomalee is the capital of Eastern Province and one of the foremost regional \ncenters in Sri Lanka. It has an important natural harbor and deep-water port connecting Sri Lanka with the \noutside world. Anuradhapura is the administrative capital of NCP. Many industries such as paddy processing \nmills, concrete workshops, hotels, shops, and vehicle service stations are located along the project roads in its \nvicinity.  \nA key indicator of the likely social impact of improving the project roads is the number of urban centers and \nservice delivery institutions located in their vicinity.  \nTable A14.1 shows these numbers for the project roads. \u201cOther institutions\u201d includes banks, divisional secretariat \noffices, and police stations. These tend to be located in a single urban center in each divisional secretary division. \nThroughout  the  country,  251  of  these  administrative  units  are  under  central  Government  control.  Rural \ncommunities  located  at  considerable  distance  from  these  small  urban  centers  are  often  among  the  most \neconomically and socially disadvantaged.

Consultation and Participation \n1. A summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nThe  consultation  and  participation  process  was  initiated  during  field  surveys  conducted  from  August  to \nSeptember 2007 with residents living within 25 meters of the proposed roads' existing center lines. This was \nfollowed by a series of community consultations that took place during the detailed design phase (May\u2013June \n2008). A variety of stakeholders including both male and female road users were consulted individually and in \ngroups. The views of drivers, farmers, local officials, business owners, teachers, housewives, and students on \nthe proposed road improvements were sought in order to obtain relevant suggestions for enhancing the Project's \nbenefits and mitigating the negative impacts.  \nAll road users mentioned time savings as a potentially significant benefit from the Project. Local stakeholders \nexpect that public transit service will improve (i.e., more frequent and lower cost buses). A second key issue \nraised by the stakeholders is related to road design. Many complaints were received about inadequate road \nwidth, lack of drainage, and inadequate road shoulders. All these problems create difficulties for road users. \nStakeholders also expressed concern about the quality of routine maintenance. \n \n2.

Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues.  \n \nKey gender issues in the transport sector in Sri Lanka include jobs, awareness campaigns on HIV/AIDS and \nhuman trafficking risks, and special support to vulnerable (i.e., poor, elderly, or disabled) households headed by \nwomen. The Project will not provide any specific gender-related benefits. However, a parallel assistance for \npromoting gender-responsive access to road rehabilitation-related opportunities is being proposed to be \nfinanced under Japan Funds for Poverty Reduction. \n \n \n \n ", "58  Appendix 14 \n \n2.
