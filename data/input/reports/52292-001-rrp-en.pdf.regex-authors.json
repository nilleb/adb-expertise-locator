THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed debt \ninvestment in bonds of up to B5,000,000,000 (or its equivalent in United States dollars) to be \nissued by B.Grimm Power Public Company Limited (B.Grimm) for the Thailand Green Bond \nProject. \n \n2.  The project entails the construction and refinancing of 16 solar power plants in Thailand, \nfor a total of 98.5 megawatts (MW). B.Grimm will issue corporate bonds to finance these solar \nassets.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  subscribe  to  the  bonds  subject  to  their \nrecognition as green bonds in compliance with the International Capital Markets Association's \nGreen Bond Principles (GBP), which ADB will facilitate. ADB will also assist B.Grimm with its \napplication to the Climate Bond Initiative (CBI) for the bonds to be certified as climate bonds under \nits Climate Bond Standards (CBS). ADB\u2019s participation is crucial for GBP compliance and CBI \ncertification, and the project will contribute to the development of the green bond market in \nThailand and the region because these will be the first GBP-compliant green bonds issued by an \nenergy company, and the first CBI-certified climate bonds in Thailand. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n3.  Project identification. The finance sector worldwide is beginning to respond to global \nwarming and climate change, and joining the collective efforts to tackle these unprecedented \nchallenges by mainstreaming climate mitigation and adaptation in its investment decisions. An \nincreasing number of institutional investors and banks have begun to \u201cdecarbonize\u201d, i.e., suspend \nnew investment in and lending to coal- and other fossil-fuel-related companies and projects, and \nalso divest themselves from such exposures in their existing portfolios.1 This also means that \nmore and more institutional investors are prioritizing and favoring investments in renewable \nenergy and climate change mitigation/adaptation, and looking for credible and verifiable means \nto evidence  it.  They need to  assure their clients, shareholders, and  other stakeholders of \ntransparency and accountability, and to demonstrate that they are responsible investors. This \ntransition is equally important for project developers and other issuers because any companies \nand projects with significant greenhouse gas emissions can be penalized in the capital markets, \nwhereas evidence of climate-friendly investments can result in favorable financing terms. \n \n4.  Green bonds are innovative financial instruments to promote such efforts, whereby the \nproceeds are used exclusively to finance or refinance, in part or in full, new or existing green \nprojects with environmental or climate-related benefits. The GBP and CBS are the two most well-\nrecognized standards of green bonds based on international best practice, while there are other \nstandards as well as \u201cself-declared\u201d green bonds.2 Green bonds serve as a vehicle for financing \ninvestments in green and climate-smart projects that contribute to the achievement of a low-\ncarbon future under the Paris Agreement on climate change and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \nDevelopment of the United Nations. The green bond market is growing rapidly and reached an \nannual issuance amount of $173 billion in 2017 globally, from just $0.5 billion in 2008. \n                                                 \n1  For instance, Standard Chartered Bank announced on 25 September 2018 that it had decided to end its financing of \nnew  coal-fired  power  plants:  https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-stanchart-coal/stanchart-quits-lending-to-new-coal-\nfired-power-stations-in-climate-change-effort-idUKKCN1M50I9 (last accessed 27 October 2018). \n2  Green bonds certified by the CBI to be complying with the CBS are called \u201cclimate bonds\u201d. The key differences \nbetween the GBP and CBS are that the CBS requires external reviews (which the GBP recommends but not \nrequires), and that climate bonds should be certified. Therefore, climate bonds are a subset of green bonds.  ", "2 \n5.  However, the issuance of green bonds has been concentrated in developed markets so \nfar, with the exception of the People\u2019s Republic of China and India. Issuance of green bonds by \nprivate sector issuers in most of the developing markets in Asia remains limited, mainly because \nthe issuers are unfamiliar with the certification process and investors lack the experience. For \ninstance, green bond issuance in the economies covered by the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations (ASEAN) accounted for only 5% of green bond issuance in all of Asia in the first half of \n2018. Further, many self-declared \u201cgreen bonds\u201d issued in Asia to date are often considered not \nin line with international best practice by the experts. This calls for the (i) establishment of local \nprivate sector green bond markets in the region and (ii) issuance of demonstrational genuine \ngreen bonds by a credible issuer with an international certification and/or a confirmation from an \nexperienced institution in this field.  \n \n6.  ADB is well positioned to play this role through \u201cOne ADB\u201d approach. First, from the \nregulatory side, ADB\u2019s extensive engagement in capital market development in the region enables \nit to showcase innovative products and  bring in international best practice. Indeed,  ADB\u2019s \nSoutheast Asia Department provided technical assistance to help the ASEAN Capital Markets \nForum establish the ASEAN Green Bond Standards, a regional standard based on the GBP.3 \nSecondly, from the private sector side, ADB Private Sector Operations Department can help \nensure the eligibility of the bonds as green bonds and/or climate bonds in accordance with the \nrelevant principles and standards, by leveraging the experience and skills from closing the Tiwi \nand MakBan Geothermal Power Green Bonds Project in the Philippines.4 \n \n7.  Against this backdrop of huge untapped markets and opportunities for ADB, green bond \nissuance in ASEAN economies is expected to accelerate. Thailand, in particular, has great \npotential for an active green bond market because it has a huge renewable energy potential, and \nits bond market is the largest among ASEAN bond markets. While Thailand\u2019s energy production \nstill  depends  heavily on fossil fuels and  although  renewable energy sources  are currently \ncontributing only 9%, this is projected to increase to 15%\u201320% by 2036 under Thailand\u2019s Power \nDevelopment Plan, 2015\u20132036.5 This translates into additional renewable capacity of 3,500 to \n6,000 MW. The Thai bond market's annual issuance of long-term corporate bonds totaled B823 \nbillion in 2017. However, renewable energy projects to date have been mainly financed by banks. \nNotwithstanding its growing needs and huge potential, the country\u2019s first green bond complying \nwith GBP was only issued in June 2018, by a local bank. \n  \n8.  B.Grimm is a leading energy company in Thailand with a growing presence in other \nASEAN countries such as the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Viet Nam, and has a proven \nrelationship with ADB through an equity investment and loan administration,6 and a loan facility.7 \nB.Grimm is transforming itself from a Thai-based local gas-fired independent power producer into \na renewable-energy-focused developer with a regional presence. Following its successful initial \npublic offering (IPO) and completion of the first solar power plants, it aims to champion itself as \nthe market leader in renewable energy and green bond issuance in Thailand and the region. In \nthe past, the company typically sought bank financing for its power plants at the project level. Now \n                                                 \n3  The proposed green bonds will also comply with the ASEAN Green Bond Standards. ADB. 2015.

", "3 \nthat the successful IPO and the investment grade local rating have significantly improved its \naccess to the capital markets, it also seeks opportunities to issue corporate bonds. ADB has \nidentified B.Grimm as the ideal partner based on the positive experience from the existing \nprojects, and also on the relationship ADB has built with the company and other key players in \nThailand\u2019s energy sector. \n \n9.  Project design. The project involves the issuance of corporate bonds for the construction \nand refinancing of 16 utility-scale solar power plants in Thailand. The total installed capacity of \nthe 16 plants is 98.5 MW, of which 9 plants totaling 67.7 MW (Yanhee and Sakeo subprojects) \nare completed and operational, while 7 plants totaling 30.8 MW (War Veterans Organization and \nAgricultural Cooperatives subprojects) are under construction. The plant size ranges from 2.3 MW \nto 8 MW, and the plants have power purchase agreements with the Provincial Electricity Authority \n(PEA) and the Metropolitan Electricity Authority  (MEA) under Thailand\u2019s Very Small Power \nProducer (VSPP) program. B.Grimm will issue corporate bonds to which ADB will subscribe. The \nrepayment of the bonds will be made from B.Grimm\u2019s overall cash flows. \n \n10.  ADB will facilitate that the  bonds will comply with the International Capital Markets \nAssociation GBP, and will also assist B.Grimm in obtaining certification of the bonds as climate \nbonds meeting the CBS by CBI. ADB will monitor whether B.Grimm upholds its commitment to \ncontinued compliance with the GBP and CBS.8 The key criteria for the bonds to be eligible as \ngreen  and  climate  bonds  are:  (i)  project  selection  and  nomination,  (ii) B.Grimm\u2019s  internal \nprocesses and controls of funds raised by the bonds, (iii) B.Grimm\u2019s internal reporting and \ncontrols associated with internal proceeds management and information, (iv) eligibility of the \nnominated projects and assets, and (v) reporting to ADB. \n \n11.  These will be the first GBP-compliant green bonds in Thailand issued by an energy \ncompany. They will also be the country's first climate bonds meeting the CBS once certified by \nCBI. Notwithstanding the growing interest among the issuers and investors, and  a rapidly \nincreasing issuance amount globally, the green bond segment in Thailand is still in its infancy \nbecause local market players lack the requisite experience. The project will contribute to the \ndevelopment of the green bond market in Thailand by showcasing genuine green and climate \nbonds (i.e., in conformance with international best practice and certified) to local issuers and \ninvestors, and ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department plans to roll out a program to \nencourage other competent and trustworthy market players in different areas\u2014such as energy, \nwater, transport, and other infrastructure\u2014to issue green bonds. \n \n12.  The project complements ADB\u2019s existing equity investment in B.Grimm, which played an \nimportant role in attracting third-party investors and establishing confidence in the equity market. \nThe project extends its assistance to the debt capital markets to showcase the company as the \nleading green bond issuer. B.Grimm has adopted and is implementing ADB\u2019s environmental and \nsocial  safeguard  standards  through  ADB\u2019s  equity  investment,  which  also  helps  boost  the \ncredibility of the company\u2019s commitment to the GBP and CBS, and creates competitive financing \noptions for B.Grimm to expand its renewable energy portfolio. \n \n                                                 \n8  ADB has engaged a consultant to independently audit the project\u2019s compliance with the GBP and the CBS. The \nconsultant will issue an assurance report to ADB, which represents conformity with the GBP, and will also be sufficient \nfor climate bond certification by the CBI. ADB will confirm the green bond status based on the assurance report, \nwhile the CBI will issue a third-party certification. Consultant fees are funded by ADB\u2019s Sustainable Development \nand Climate Change Department under ADB. 2014.

ADB\u2019s assistance will be deployed for the \nrefinancing  of  B.Grimm\u2019s  existing  solar  plants,  and  construction  of  its  new  solar  plants  in \nThailand.18 The bonds comprise a 5-year bond of up to B1,500 million and a 7-year bond of up to \nB3,500 million, both with a bullet repayment. [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n27.  Catalytic impact. ADB\u2019s participation in B.Grimm\u2019s bond program includes assistance to \nensure both that the bonds will comply with the GBP and obtain climate bond certification. \nAssociation with ADB will also help make the GBP and climate bonds better known in the region. \nSuch instruments and standards are not yet well-recognized in the Thai and ASEAN capital \nmarkets, and local or regional bond investors and issuers do not yet have the requisite expertise \nor experience to establish green bond status or third-party certification. The successful issuance \nof these bonds with ADB\u2019s confirmation as green bonds and climate bond certification by CBI will \nfoster confidence among issuers as they see the benefits associated with green bonds (franchise \nvalue enhancement, industry leadership, reputation enhancement, integration of sustainable \nprinciples and greenhouse gas emissions reduction into the strategy) and help promote further \ninvestments in renewable energy and other climate-friendly businesses. Overall, this will channel \nmore funding into, or enable easier access to funding for, renewable energy and other climate-\nfriendly projects. Further, B.Grimm\u2019s environmental and social management system (ESMS), \nwhich exceeds national standards, will become widely known and put other players in the market \nunder more pressure to catch up in this respect. \n \n28.  Green bond program. With the proposed project, ADB will potentially kickstart a program \nfor green bond issuance by the private sector, which will mobilize additional commercial investors \nand issuers into this emerging asset class. By leveraging its regional presence, ADB will replicate \ngreen bond issuance in accordance with international best practice in Thailand and in other \nASEAN economies, with possible effects on other bond markets in Asia. \n \nC.  Risks \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED].  \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n29.  ADB categorized the investment in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009)  as  follows:  environment  (category  B),  involuntary  resettlement  (category  C),  and \nindigenous peoples (category C).19 Its Safeguard Policy Statement Safeguard Requirements 4 \nfor general corporate finance project applies. \n \n30.  ADB undertook due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social impacts \nof the project and the measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse \n                                                 \n18  The entire ADB financing amount including the refinancing portion will be counted as climate finance. With regard to \ncarbon dioxide emission reduction, only the portion from the subprojects under construction will be counted.  \n19 ADB. Safeguard Categories. ", "8 \nimpacts in the safeguard reports and plans. The environmental and social measures and the \ninstitutional  capacity  and  commitment  of  B.Grimm  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and \nenvironmental impacts are deemed adequate. The operational subprojects are assets to which \nthe  proceeds  of  ADB\u2019s  previously  approved  equity  investment  were  applied  in  2017.  The \ncorporate ESMS audit that was undertaken while processing the earlier investment applies to this \nproject (footnote 6). An audit of selective assets was also undertaken at the time which covered \nthe operational subprojects. Corrective actions to address the findings of that corporate audit and \nensure  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  were  fully  carried  out  and \nincorporated in B.Grimm\u2019s ESMS prior to ADB\u2019s equity subscription in 2017. It was agreed that \nthe ESMS be implemented for all subprojects that utilize ADB\u2019s debt and equity financing, and \nwill be applied on a best-effort basis for non-ADB funded subprojects. \n \n31.  Environment. An existing facilities audit was undertaken by an external party to assess \nthe subprojects\u2019 compliance with B.Grimm\u2019s ESMS and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \nSafeguard Requirements 1\u20133. The audit reviewed all the subprojects with a focus on the seven \nsubprojects under construction that are nearly completed, with scheduled commercial operation \ndates in December 2018. B.Grimm has advised that flooding studies were completed for each \nsite and that the results were factored into the technical design. A review of the local environment \nreports found some gaps in biodiversity assessment and climate risk assessment conducted for \nthe subprojects. Three of the subprojects are in the lower portion of the Central Basin Important \nBird  Area,  which  is  a  wintering  area  for  the  Manchurian  Reed-warbler  (VU).20 The  three \nsubprojects were developed on former agricultural lands and are not in legally protected areas. \nThe  photovoltaic  panels  have  anti-glare  surfaces  with  row  separation  minimizing  risks  to \nbirds. The  subprojects  are  located  no  more  than  approximately  fifty  meters  from  existing \ntransmission lines. Although the project sites are not likely to have a significant impact on the \nspecies since they have an average size of 7.8 hectares\u2014compared with a total important bird \narea of 190,000 hectares\u2014additional studies and actions will be required. The audit also found \nopportunities for improving occupational health and safety, enforcement of the local labor code, \ngrievance redress mechanism record keeping, and environmental monitoring record keeping. \nB.Grimm has committed to implement a corrective action plan to fill the gaps identified by the \naudit, including (i) biodiversity assessment for the three sites, (ii) measures to maintain or restore \nthe Manchurian Reed-warbler habitat within the green areas of those sites, (iii) occupational \nhealth and safety improvements, and record-keeping improvements applicable for all subprojects. \n \n32.  Social safeguards. Land for subprojects in operation or under construction for which ADB \nproceeds will be used were purchased through negotiated settlements with individual landowners \non mutually agreed terms. No outstanding legacy issues pertaining to land for the subprojects \nwere found. The subprojects are in areas where typically no distinct or vulnerable ethnic minority \ngroups reside who could be adversely or beneficially affected. Therefore, involuntary resettlement \nand/or indigenous people issues are not envisaged for the project. \n \n33.  Other social dimensions. The project is classified as having no gender elements.21 \nB.Grimm will (i) apply ADB's prohibited investment activities list and (ii) ensure that investments \n                                                 \n20 VU (vulnerable) refers to the IUCN Red list status of the Manchurian reed-warbler in 2017, as assessed by Bird Life \nInternational in 2016. \n21 During due diligence, gender assessment of B.Grimm\u2019s human resource and corporate social responsibility \napproaches was conducted. Given that (i) ADB\u2019s financing will be channeled to completed and close-to-complete \nsolar subprojects which have low staffing requirements; and (ii) at the corporate level, 44% of B.Grimm\u2019s Board of \nDirectors are female, its company president is female, and 47% of its headquarter staff are female, no gender \nelements for this transaction is pursued. However, B.Grimm has agreed to continue to explore and implement other \n ", "9 \nusing ADB funds comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and abide by national laws and \nregulations. The ESMS sets out requirements, as applicable, for compliance with national labor \nlaws and measures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor standards, pursuant \nto ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy (2001).22 The ESMS will also contain requirements, as \napplicable, for information disclosure and consultation with affected people in line with ADB \nstandards. B.Grimm will report regularly to ADB on (i) its and its investments\u2019 compliance with \nsuch laws and (ii) the measures taken.23 \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n34.  B.Grimm was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n \n35.  The proposed debt investment is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and \nsingle exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n \n36.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),24 \nADB will proceed with the proposed assistance  upon establishing that  the Government of \nThailand has no objection to the proposed assistance to B.Grimm Power Public Company Limited. \nADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, \nfollowing approval of the proposed assistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n37.  I am satisfied that the proposed  debt investment would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nproposed debt investment in bonds of up to B5,000,000,000 (or its equivalent in United States \ndollars) from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to be issued by B.Grimm Power Public Company \nLimited for the Thailand Green Bond Project in Thailand, with such terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n8 November 2018 \n                                                 \ngender measures such as better working conditions and workplace environment for female staff; gender targeted \nopportunities for staff training and community development activities, as part of ADB\u2019s ongoing engagement as a \nshareholder. \n22 ADB. 2003.
