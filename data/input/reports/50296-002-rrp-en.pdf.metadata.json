Bhutan, a landlocked country with a population of 780,000, has made great strides \nin basic education, and it now needs to accelerate the development of a skilled workforce to meet \nthe economic needs for competitiveness and sustained growth. Bhutan\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan, \n2018\u20132023 prioritizes skills development for jobs.2 \n  \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \nBhutan  made  impressive  progress  in  socioeconomic  development  over  2007\u20132017.  Its \n3. \neconomy grew at an average annual rate of 7.7% during this period.3 The country doubled its per \ncapita gross domestic product and halved the poverty rate.4 However, such rapid development \nwas largely driven by the capital-intensive hydropower sector and did not lead to adequate job \ncreation.  Economic diversification and job creation are among the top priorities of the government. \n \n4. \nBhutan faces high youth unemployment. The youth unemployment rate of 13.2% in 2016 \nwas 6 times the average national unemployment rate and has been rising in recent years.5 At the \nsame  time,  employers  find  it  difficult  to  recruit  skilled  workers.  Skills  shortages  are  one  of  the \ncritical  constraints  to  the  growth  of  the  private  sector  and  diversification  of  the  economy. 6 \nAccording to the National Workforce Plan, 2016\u20132022, based on a survey of employers in three \npriority sectors (construction, tourism, and production), more than 33% of employers face skills \nshortages,  impacting on  productivity  and business  performance.7 The  National Workforce  Plan \nestimates  that  78,000  jobs  will  be  generated  by  the  construction,  tourism,  and  manufacturing \nsectors during 2016\u20132022. In 2017, over 14,000 new secondary and tertiary education graduates \nentered the labor market. Equipping these new graduates with market-oriented skills needed by \nindustry will help reduce the skills shortages. \n \n5. \nChallenges  in  skills  development.  The  skills  development  system  in  Bhutan  faces \nconstraints  in  access.  In  2016,  only  6.9%  of  grade  10  students  enrolled  in  TVET.  The  current \n                                                \n1  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  $425,000  in  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.

Thimphu.  \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nannual intake capacity of the public technical training institutes (TTIs) is limited, catering to only \nabout 635 students, compared to 3,000 grade 10 graduates and nearly 6,000 grade 12 graduates \nentering  the  workforce  in  2016.8 Outdated  equipment  in  TTIs  is  in  dire  need  of  replacement. \nTrainers  lack  capacity  and  professional  development.  The  TTIs  offer  courses  at  the  basic \ncertificate level and in traditional areas (e.g., electrical, mechanical, welding, automobile, masonry, \nplumbing,  and  carpentry).  These  are  not  preferred  by  youth  mainly  due  to  lack  of  career \nprogression  and  low  social  recognition.  Opportunities  for  skills  upgrading  through  advanced \ncourses will lead to better job prospects. In addition, training is required for emerging occupations, \nincluding service sector jobs such as information technology (IT) and IT-enabled services, food \nand  beverage,  tourism  and  hospitality,  and  media  and  communication.  Career  guidance  with \nexposure  to  the  world  of  work  to  school  students  will  increase  their  awareness  of  skills \ndevelopment opportunities leading to jobs. \n \n6. \nSkills development in the country also faces the challenge of lack of quality and relevance. \nAn estimated 80% of training programs is delivered at the basic certificate level, which does not \ncommand much market value. There is a shortage of middle and advanced skills, with demand \nlargely met by foreign workers.  International collaborations in TVET will contribute to enhancing \nthe capacities of trainers. IT-based teaching and learning processes in schools and TTIs will help \nto prepare the youth for an increasingly digital marketplace. Schools are preponderantly geared \nto academic education without sufficient preparation for the world of work. Labor market surveys \nreveal that Bhutanese youth do not possess the skills that employers are looking for, which gives \nrise  to  skills  mismatches.  Partnerships  with  private  sector  training  providers  to  deliver  market-\nrelevant courses will help address such mismatches and improve job placements. \n \nOpportunities  in  skills  development.  The  government  attaches  great  importance  to \n7. \nskills development for jobs and is highly committed to improving the TVET sector. A number of \npolicy documents provide the basis for this. The TVET Blueprint, 2016\u20132026 articulates the vision \nfor improving and transforming the skills development system. The Education Blueprint, 2014\u2013\n2024 outlines priorities for enhancing education quality, including strengthening TVET in schools. \nThe  Economic  Development  Policy  of  2016  aims  to  diversify  the  economy,  which  requires \nappropriately  skilled  human  capital. 9  The  government  plans  to  expand  capacities  for  TVET \nprovision, and raise the proportion of higher secondary students enrolling in TVET to 20% by 2024 \nfrom  the  current  6.9%.  The  government  plans  to  offer  more  diversified  learning  opportunities \nincluding vocational training to secondary school students (grades 9\u201312).  \n \n8. \nPrior experience of the Asian Development Bank. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nhas  long-standing  experience  in  supporting  TVET  and  school  education  in  Bhutan. 10  ADB \nfinanced the establishment of the TTIs, forming the backbone of public sector TVET institutions, \nunder the Basic Skills Development Project from 2001 to 2006. The validation report by ADB\u2019s \nIndependent Evaluation Department noted that the project was instrumental in skilling young labor \n\n                                                \n8   The total capacity of 635 is across all seven public TTIs in Bhutan. The project will cover five major TTIs.  \n9   The Economic Development Policy outlines the critical need for diversification beyond the hydropower sector.   \n10  Related ADB support includes the following: ADB. 1990.

ADB technical assistance (TA) helped to develop the TVET Blueprint, \nwhich provides the vision for reforms and targets in the TVET sector. The government asked ADB \nto support its implementation. \n \n9. \nValue added by the Asian Development Bank\u2019s assistance. ADB is well placed to build \non  past  collaborations  in  TVET  and  school  education.  ADB\u2019s  value  addition  will  be  to  (i)  help \nelevate standards in TTIs; (ii) provide green technology equipment for the delivery of existing and \nnew courses in the TTIs;12 (iii) assist the government in rebranding TVET courses to attract more \nyouth,  and  modernizing  teaching  and  training  pedagogy;  (iv)  strengthen  private  sector \nengagement  in the  delivery  of  courses  that  are  in demand  in the market;  and  (v)  demonstrate \ngood practices in integrating TVET and career guidance in school education. The grant supports \nthe inclusive economic growth pillar of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 and is fully \naligned with the government\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan.13 ADB support is crucial to augment the \nfinancial  and  technical  capacity  of  the  government  to  implement  the  TVET  Blueprint.  ADB  will \nenable a knowledge sharing forum to bring together key agencies such as Helvetas, the World \nBank, the government of Australia, and the Japan International Cooperation Agency to synergize \nsupport for TVET, labor market analysis, and capacity development. \n \nB. \n \n10. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  skilled  human  capital  for  equitable \nsocioeconomic development increased. The project will have the following outcome: employability \nof TVET graduates and secondary school graduates improved.14 \n  \nC. \n \nOutput  1:  Access  to  skills  development  increased.  The  capacity  of  five  TTIs \n11. \nparticipating in the project to enroll students for skills training will nearly double by 2023.15 The \nTTIs  will  venture  into  training  for  emerging  occupations  by  introducing  additional  courses. \nSpecifically,  the  project  will  (i)  establish  a  new  flagship TTI  in  Thimphu  in  a  new  campus  with \nmodern facilities and upgraded courses at the diploma level, and improve the TTI in Samthang \nwith new classrooms, workshops, and dormitories; (ii) provide green technology equipment and \ntools, including IT equipment, in the five TTIs; and (iii) introduce at least six new courses, including \nat  the  middle  and  advanced  (diploma)  levels  and  in  new  disciplines. 16 These  much-needed \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                \n11  ADB. 2010. Completion Report: Basic Skills Development Project in Bhutan.  Manila; and Independent Evaluation \nDepartment. 2011. Validation Report: Basic Skills Development Project in Bhutan. Manila. The overall performance \nof  the  Basic  Skills  Development  Project  was  rated  partly  successful,  as  some  of  the  outputs  were  only  partially \nachieved and the design of project management was fragmented. \n\n12  Green technology equipment includes Computer Numerical Control machines, three-dimensional workstations for \nsimulation and virtual welders, that will consume less electricity and raw materials. The simulators will supplement \ntheoretical and classroom teaching prior to practice on real machines.  \n13  ADB. 2014. Country Partnership Strategy: Bhutan, 2014\u20132018. Manila. \n14  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n15  The annual enrollment capacity in the TTIs in Chumey, Khuruthang, Rangjung, Samthang and Thimphu will increase \n\nfrom 466 in 2017 to 919 in 2023 \n\n16  Diploma courses will be introduced for the first time in the TTIs. The project will introduce national diploma courses \nin electrical and construction technology; National Certificate Level 3 courses in welding and hybrid automobiles; \nand courses in diversified disciplines, including computer applications (graphic design and animation), logistics, and \npackaging and food production.   \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\ninvestments will enable the enrollment of a larger cohort of students in the TTIs as per the TVET \nBlueprint.  This  output  will  benefit  a  total  of  2,200  students  in  TTIs  over  5  years,  including  an \nadditional  450  students  enrolled  during  the  project  period  (32%  female).  Increasing  access  to \nTVET  for  women  will  increase  gender  equality  in  workforce  participation  and  wage  rates.  The \nintroduction of advanced courses will raise the workforce skill level and support the economy\u2019s \nefforts to move up the value chain in the industry and service sectors.17 \n \n12. \nOutput  2:  Quality  and  relevance  of  skills  development  enhanced.  To  enhance  the \nquality and market relevance of TVET, the project will (i) deliver training of trainer programs to at \nleast 60% of trainers in TTIs, offering exposure to training practices by leading regional and/or \ninternational TVET institutions, and workplace experience; (ii) deliver skills training in emerging \noccupations in partnership with private sector training providers and civil society organizations, \nbenefiting  800  students  (32%  female and  5%  persons  with  disabilities) 18 ;  and  (iii)  provide \nimproved  teaching  and  learning  resources,  including  e-resources,  in  the  five  TTIs  to  develop \nfuture-ready IT skills in graduates.19 The upgrading of the capacities of trainers will be undertaken \nin partnership with international institutions, particularly for the delivery of diploma courses with \ninnovative  pedagogy.  The  project  will  establish  new  employment-linked  contracts  with  private \nsector training providers based on a competitive selection process to assure better job outcomes. \nPartnerships with civil society organizations will increase opportunities for skills training for jobs \nor  self-employment  for  disadvantaged  youth,  particularly  those  with  disabilities.  Equal \nopportunities for women and disadvantaged youth to benefit from higher-quality skills training and \ntraining  in  emerging  occupations  will  lead  to  better  paid  jobs  and  economic  and  social \nempowerment. \n \nOutput  3:  Vocational  orientation  of  secondary  school  students  improved.  To \n13. \nencourage a larger number of secondary school students to take up skills training, the project will \nsupport the introduction of TVET elective subjects in seven pilot schools that will be upgraded as \n\u201cTVET  premier  schools\u201d.  Specifically,  the  project  will  (i)  improve the  skills  of  secondary  school \nstudents by offering TVET elective subjects in grades 9\u201312 in seven pilot schools linked to TTIs, \nbenefiting 400 students (32% female); (ii) provide career guidance with exposure to the world of \nwork to secondary students (grades 7\u201312) benefiting 30,000 students (40% female); and (iii) offer \ninformation  and communication technology-enriched teaching  and learning to improve  modern \ncompetencies,  such  as  critical  thinking,  problem  solving,  teamwork,  and  communication,  in \ngrades 7\u201312 in the seven pilot schools, benefiting 2,500 students (40% female). These actions \nwill  enable  secondary  school  students,  including  girls,  to  make  appropriate  career  choices  for \nbetter job prospects. The project will establish 13 TVET laboratories in the seven pilot schools to \noffer TVET courses with a structured curriculum and trained junior instructors. The pilot schools \nwill have formal linkages with the five TTIs and one Institute of Zorig Chusum (a training institute \nfor traditional arts and crafts) for curriculum, teacher training, and credit transfer arrangements. \n\n \n14. \nOutput  4:  Governance  and  institutional  capacity  for  technical  and  vocational \neducation  and  training  improved.  The  project  will  (i)  operationalize  an  integrated  and  web-\nbased TVET management information system (MIS) and an employment services portal; and (ii) \nfacilitate international partnerships for capacity development in at least one TTI. Currently, there \nis no centralized information system to track the enrollment and progress of students across the \n                                                \n17  In  2016,  industry  accounted  for  41%  of  gross  domestic  product;  the  service  sector  accounted  for  42%;  and \n\nagriculture, livestock, and forestry accounted for about 16%.  \n\n18  The private sector training providers will offer courses in tourism and hospitality, food processing and packaging, \n\nmultimedia, animation and communication, and other areas identified through ongoing needs assessment. \n\n19 The  project  will  equip  the  TTIs  with  a  range  of  e-resources,  such as multimedia-based self-learning modules  for \n\nvarious courses which will also inculcate problem solving and project-based learning. \n\n \n\n\fTTIs. The new TVET MIS will provide sex-disaggregated data on TVET across the TTIs. An online \ncentral  admissions  system for the TTIs  will  be  introduced.  Timely  and reliable information and \nforecasting in key areas of skills demand are needed for TVET providers to effectively develop \nthe required workforce. The MOLHR will host and operate the new TVET MIS and the employment \nservices portal and maintain it during project implementation and beyond. The project will support \ninitiatives  to  assess  future  demand.  To  prepare  Bhutanese  youth  to  be  globally  mobile  and \ncompetitive, the project will pursue international collaborations and potential institutional twinning \nfor capacity development. \n \nD. \n \n15. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $18  million  (Table  1).

The  budget  proposals  for  the  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan  include \nprovisions for the project, including government counterpart contributions and budget allocation \nfor  recurrent  costs.  The  civil  works  in  the  project  will  adopt  disaster  risk  resilient  features  and \ninclude  energy-efficient  equipment  and fixtures.  The  equipment  to  be  supplied  to the  TTIs  will \nembody green technologies where possible. The MOLHR and MOE have adequate capacities to \nundertake curriculum revisions and develop materials and standards for the TVET courses in TTIs \nand in schools, which will be supplemented with international collaborations and TA. The project \nwill establish performance-based partnership agreements with private sector providers to deliver \nmarket-oriented skills training programs with extensive on-the-job training and job placements. \nThe private sector partnerships will extend skills training for fast-growing service sector jobs. The \nestablishment  of  an  online  TVET  MIS  including  an  online  student  admissions  system,  will \ncontribute to improving evidence-based planning and timely implementation. \n \n21. \nClimate  change. The  project  risk  is  rated medium  on  climate change based  on  ADB\u2019s \nclimate risk screening report.21 Adaptation measures like retaining walls, and mitigation measures, \nsuch as energy efficient lights and appliances, will be incorporated in the design of buildings to \nensure  that  they  will  be  resistant  to  climate  change.  The  associated  carbon  dioxide  emission \nreductions from the proposed mitigation measures are estimated to be 114 tons per year. \n \nB. \n \n22. \nEconomic  returns  from  the  project  will  be  derived  by  students  transitioning  into \nemployment  after  skills  training  at  the  TTIs,  TVET  premier  schools,  and  on-the-job  training  in \nindustries, compared to nonparticipants. Industries and employers are expected to benefit from \nincreased  availability  of  skilled  workers.  A  larger  number  of  TVET  graduates  will  benefit  from \nhigher  wages  compared  to  unskilled  workers.  The  cumulative  net  incremental  benefits  will \nbecome positive within 4 years of implementation. The project\u2019s economic internal rate of return \nis estimated at a high 19.28% which reflects extensive skills shortages that currently prevail in \nBhutan. Sensitivity analysis was carried out with a 20% reduction in quantified benefits and a 20% \nincrease in costs (capital and operations). The economic internal rate of return continued to be \nmore than 6%, indicating that the project is a sound investment. \n \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n                                                \n21 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nGovernance \n\nThe financial analysis assessed the sustainability of the project at the national and project \n23. \nlevels.  It  assessed  the  government\u2019s  capacity  and  commitment  to  provide  adequate  financial \nsupport  to  implement  the  project  and  mainstream  it  after  project  completion.  The  analysis \nconcluded that the government has the capacity to absorb and sustain the benefits of the project \nconsidering  the  increased  budget  allocations  proposed  for  the  TVET  and  school  education \nsubsectors in the Twelfth Five-Year Plan. \n \nC. \n \n24. \nADB undertook a detailed financial management capacity assessment of the MOLHR and \nMOE. Bhutan has made exemplary progress in building its public financial management system \nto provide fiscal discipline and rational allocation of resources in line with its five-year plans. The \ngovernment is pursuing further improvements through the Public Financial Management Reform \nStrategy,  2017\u20132021  to  improve  transparency  and  accountability. 22  Despite  strong  systems, \nproject  financial  management  risk,  prior  to  mitigation  is  rated  substantial  primarily  because  of \ninadequate capacity for financial management, internal controls on compliance with procedures, \ncontrol over fixed assets, and timely follow-up on internal and external audits. Mitigation measures \ninclude the appointment of full-time financial management personnel in the PMUs (supported by \nfinancial management  consultants),  and  improved financial monitoring  and asset  management \ncontrols. The internal audit teams of the respective ministries will present half-yearly internal audit \nreports to the steering committee. An annual statutory external audit report will be submitted within \n6 months of the end of the government financial year. \n \n25. \nADB undertook a procurement risk assessment at  the country and TVET sector levels. \nWhile  the  procurement  system  has  several  strong  features  such  as  e-procurement,  there  are \ninstitutional  weaknesses  in  linking  procurement  planning,  budget  provisions  and  fund  release, \nand  capacity  constraints  for  timely  procurement  management  and  monitoring.  Mitigation \nmeasures include dedicated full-time procurement staff in the PMUs, supported by intermittent \nprocurement management consultants. A design and supervision consultant will be engaged to \nmonitor all the civil works in the project. ADB will undertake two external fiduciary reviews covering \nfinancial  management  processes  and  selected  post  procurement  audits.  After  mitigation,  the \nproject\u2019s financial management and procurement risks are moderate. The detailed risk mitigation \nplan is included in the PAM. \n \n26. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MOLHR  and  MOE.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM.23 \n \nD. \n \nThe project has pro-poor and gender-sensitive dimensions. The main beneficiaries will be \n27. \nthe  youth who  have completed grade  10  and can  pursue job-oriented  skills  development. The \nproject provides opportunities to rural youth.24 The majority of students taking up TVET come from \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n                                                \n22 Government  of  Bhutan,  Ministry  of  Finance.  2017.  Public  Financial  Management  Reforms  Strategy,  2017\u20132021. \n\nThimphu. \n\n23  The Anticorruption Commission of Bhutan is currently investigating some of the MOLHR\u2019s training programs. The \n\nMOLHR will provide an action plan on the findings when the inquiry has been completed. \n\n24  The five TTIs participating in the project are located in the far east (Rangjung), in the central region (Chumey), in the \nwest (Khuruthang and Samthang), and in the capital city of Thimphu. All TTIs offer free training and free residential \nfacilities, ensuring affordability of training for members of poor communities. \n\n \n\n \n\n\ffamilies in which the head of household has little or no education and comes from an agro-farming \nbackground.25 The government is proactively tackling the issue of unemployment among youth, \nwho are currently recognized as a vulnerable group in Bhutan.26 The project will offer affordable \nskills training programs to poor youth while also providing skills upgradation to workers through \ndiploma courses which will enable them to access better paid jobs. \n \n28. \nFemale secondary school students and TVET trainees will benefit from skills development \nand  career  counseling.  In  line  with  the  target  to  increase  female  enrollment  in  TTIs,  32%  of \nresidential facilities will be reserved for female students. Training delivery through private sector \ntraining  providers  includes  mandatory  targets  for  females  and  people  with  disabilities.  Media \ncampaigns and advocacy will be undertaken to encourage poor and female students to avail of \nfree TVET opportunities, and break gender stereotypes. While the project will support participation \nof women in courses that are popular among females (such as tourism and hospitality, tailoring \nand/or dressmaking, food packaging, IT and IT-enabled services, design, and animation), it will \nalso encourage women to take up male-dominated courses in sectors such as automotive and \nconstruction based on interest and job market demand. \n \nE. \n \n29. \ncategories are as follows.27 \n \n30. \nEnvironment (category B). Potential impacts are mainly associated with construction of \nnew buildings for TTIs and include increased noise and dust levels, waste generation, and traffic \ncongestion. These impacts are temporary and of short duration and can be mitigated through the \nenvironmental management plan, environmental monitoring plan, and compliance with relevant \ngovernment regulations. The initial environmental examination was disclosed on the ADB website \non 15 June 2018. An environment safeguard specialist will monitor and report on compliance with \nADB  environmental  requirements  during  implementation.  The  PMUs  will  set  up  a  project \ngrievance  redress  mechanism  to  resolve  complaints  in  a  timely  manner.  Consultations  with \nstakeholders were undertaken during project preparation. \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  C).  The  project  entails  no  land  acquisition, \n31. \nresettlement,  or  any  physical  and  economic  displacement.  Improvements  to  buildings  and \nfacilities will take place within existing campuses and/or premises owned by the government. \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nSafeguards \n\n \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).
