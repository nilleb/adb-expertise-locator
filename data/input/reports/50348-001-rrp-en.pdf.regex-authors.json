THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed grants \nto the Republic of Kiribati and to Nauru for the Improving Internet Connectivity for Micronesia \nProject. \n \n2.  The Government of Kiribati and the Government of Nauru have requested the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  support  a  submarine  internet  cable  project  connecting  the \nMicronesian subregion with the world. The project will finance (i) the submarine cable connection \nbetween Kiritimati island of Kiribati to a proposed transpacific cable system connecting Australia \nand Hawaii and (ii) Nauru\u2019s share of the East Micronesia Cable (EMC) system. The EMC system \nwill be cofinanced by the World Bank and ADB, and will connect Tarawa, Kiribati; Nauru, and \nKosrae State, Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) to Pohnpei, FSM.1 The Kosrae and Tarawa \nportions of the EMC system will be financed by the World Bank.2 The project will complement the \nongoing and existing cable systems connecting all the major islands in the North Pacific region.3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The economy. The Micronesian countries participating in the project (FSM, Kiribati, and \nNauru) are highly dependent on official development assistance, external fund flows, and rents \nfrom a limited set of natural resources such as oceanic fisheries and phosphate (for Nauru, and \npreviously,  Kiribati).  Small  and  dispersed  populations  and  geographic  isolation  limit  the \nopportunities for productive business activity. \n \n4.  Internet promoting connectivity and growth. A submarine cable would provide higher \ncapacity and quality broadband internet at much lower cost to the Micronesian subregion, making \nthe  internet  more  accessible  and  affordable  to  the  impacted  population  (about  75,000). \nHarnessing  information and  communication technology  (ICT)  could facilitate  education  and \ntraining for the labor force, raise overall efficiency in the delivery of basic public services, and \nopen new business opportunities. Lower internet costs would boost regional trade (in services \nsuch as tourism and back-office functions, for example) and allow the region to form a sizable \nmarket for digital products and services.4 It would also strengthen the existing regional public \ngoods and encourage new ones by allowing countries to share the limited knowledge and human \nresources available in the Pacific. Moreover, a regional initiative will help the countries achieve \nsignificant savings compared with individual cable investments by each state.5 \n \n5.  Structure  and  governance  of  the  information  technology  industry.  In  all  three \nparticipating countries, telecommunication (or telecom) services are relatively weak, although the \ndemand for cellular phones (the primary form of internet connection) and internet services is \n                                                \n1  Pohnpei, FSM is already connected to the international cable hub in Guam via Hantru-1 submarine cable system. \n2  http://projects.worldbank.org/P161363?lang=en and http://projects.worldbank.org/P159632?lang=en. \n3  The North Pacific system comprises the ADB-financed connection for Palau, the World Bank-financed connections \nfor Yap and Chuuk States of FSM, and the Government of the United States-financed connections for the Republic \nof the Marshall Islands and Pohnpei State, FSM. \n4  ADB. 2015. Aid for Trade in Asia and the Pacific: Thinking Forward About Trade Costs and the Digital Economy. \nManila.  https://www.adb.org/publications/aid-trade-asia-and-pacific-thinking-forward-about-trade-costs-and-digital-\neconomy. \n5  ADB. 2016. Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020. Manila. \n ", "2 \nstrong and growing. In Kiribati, basic cell phone penetration is more than 34% of the population, \nspread over eight (of the 22 inhabited) islands, including Tarawa and Kiritimati; however, only 2G \nis available on six of these islands. Cell phone use is widespread in Nauru (Digicel provides about \n17,000 cell phone connections for a population of 10,000).6 Internet access in Kiribati, Nauru, and \nKosrae, FSM is via satellite\u2014including [The] Other Three Billion (O3b)\u2014with limited bandwidth. \nPohnpei is the only state in the FSM with submarine cable connectivity, while the islands of Yap \nand Chuuk are in the process of connecting via submarine cables, funded by the World Bank.7 In \nthe interim, FSM Telecommunication Corporation has contracted O3b to provide internet service \nto Yap and Chuuk. Competition in the sector is limited in all three countries: the FSM is reliant \nsolely on FSM Telecommunications Corporation, although legislation allows for new entrants; in \nKiribati, Amalgamated Telecom Holdings Kiribati Ltd is the main telecom provider in Tarawa, while \nKiribati\u2019s second mobile service licensee, Ocean Links, is about to set up its operation; and in \nNauru, services are provided by government-owned Cenpac Net Incorporated and Digicel. \n \n6.  In  2013,  the  World  Bank  assisted  Kiribati  in  setting  up  a  telecom  regulator,  the \nCommunications Commission of Kiribati, responsible for the full range of services.8 In May 2017, \nthe Government of Nauru passed the Telecommunications and Regulatory Affairs Act 2017 and \nestablished the Department of Telecommunications and Regulatory Affairs under the minister of \ntelecommunications.9 The minister appointed the head of the department. The department head \nalso plays the role of a telecom regulator. In 2014, the FSM enacted the FSM Telecommunication \nAct, which provides for an independent telecom regulator. Continued technical assistance from \nthe World Bank and ADB will facilitate the operating environment needed to pass on cost \nreductions to the final consumer. \n \n7.  The affordability and quality of the service limits internet usage. The use of O3b provides \nsome interim relief in countries, but limited bandwidth capacity and weather disruptions are still \nmajor constraints. The retail internet prices are still significantly above those achievable with \nservice provision based on a fiber-optic cable.10 \n \n8.  Regional approach to internet connectivity. The distance from the nearest internet hub \nhas been the major cost constraint for Kiribati and Nauru when it comes to installing and operating \nindependent submarine cable systems for their limited demand. In 2016, the FSM, Kiribati, and \nNauru agreed to explore a technical solution for a regional cable system to connect Kosrae in the \nFSM, Tarawa in Kiribati, and Nauru; and set up a steering committee to prepare legal and \ntechnical details for the cable solution. The World Bank supported consultants for the FSM (for \nthe Kosrae connection) and Kiribati (Tarawa connection). ADB funded a project coordination team \nto support the steering committee as well as technical and legal consultants to support Nauru in \nits participation in the steering committee.11 The technical team under the steering committee \nrecommended the EMC system, connecting Tarawa and Nauru to Pohnpei (which is already \nconnected to the internet hub in Guam via the Hantru-1 cable system), with a spur to Kosrae in \nthe FSM. The regional approach will help the countries share the capital and operational cost \n                                                \n6  Digicel Nauru is 20% government-owned and the dominant service provider in Nauru.  \n7  http://projects.worldbank.org/P130592?lang=en. \n8  The  Communications  Commission  of  Kiribati  is  responsible  for  operator  licensing,  type  approval,  radio \ncommunication licensing, Kiribati Radio Frequency Spectrum Plan, numbering rules (8-digit-based services and \nnumber portability), and universal access. \n9  http://ronlaw.gov.nr/nauru_lpms/index.php/act/view/1218. \n10 The affordability index for broadband in Micronesia is more than 20.00% of gross national income based on the \naverage price of a 1GB (monthly package, computer-based) broadband plan, compared with 4.88% in Australia. \n11 ADB. 2013.

Kiritimati in Kiribati is about 2,000 kilometers (km) east of Tarawa, making extending the \nEMC system to connect Kiritimati financially unviable. An independent cable system to the nearest \ninternet hub in Hawaii (about 2,000 km away) is also too costly to be financially viable. In January \n2017, Southern Cross Cable Company (SXC) announced a new cable system, Southern Cross \nNEXT (NEXT), which will pass within approximately 400 km of Kiritimati. This provides an \nopportunity for Kiritimati to connect via a spur and branching unit.13 ADB funded technical \nconsultants  to  help  Kiribati  negotiate  the  technical  configuration,  bandwidth  capacity,  and \noperational agreement with SXC for the connection (footnote 11). \n \n10.  Kiribati  and  Nauru  have  set  up  Bwebweriki  Net  Limited  (BNL)  and  Nauru  Cable \nCorporation (NCC), their respective state-owned enterprises, to prepare, install, operate, and own \ntheir portion of the EMC system in Kiribati and Nauru, and manage the Kiritimati connection. BNL \nwill be responsible in Kiribati and NCC in Nauru to provide wholesale internet capacity to local \ntelecom players in an equitable and nondiscriminatory way. \n \n11.  The project is included in ADB\u2019s regional operations business plan14 and is consistent with \nthe national development plans and strategies of Kiribati and Nauru.15 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The project is aligned with the following impact: improved telecommunications in the \nMicronesian subregion.16 The project will have the following outcome: low-cost and high-quality \ninternet service in Kosrae (FSM), Kiribati, and Nauru, achieved. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n13.  Output 1: EMC system connecting the islands of Kosrae (FSM), Tarawa (Kiribati), \nand Nauru to Pohnpei in the FSM. ADB will be financing Nauru\u2019s share of output 1, which will \nbe achieved through (i) the construction of the EMC system and landing station in Nauru, (ii) \nefficient and effective operation of NCC by the Government of Nauru, and (iii) timely negotiation \nand signing of the C&MA between the consortium members. Nauru will be supported by a project \nmanagement unit (PMU), funded under the project to implement output 1. \n \n14.  Output 2: Submarine cable connection from Kiritimati (Kiribati) to the NEXT cable \nsystem. Output 2 will be achieved through (i) the construction of a spur, branching unit, and \nlanding station in Kiritimati by SXC; (ii) efficient and effective operation of BNL by the Government \nof Kiribati; and (iii) timely negotiation and signing of the master purchase agreement (MPA), \nlanding party agreement (LPA), and capacity use agreement (CUA) between BNL and SXC. \nThese agreements will give Kiribati the right to use the spur, branching unit, and landing station \n                                                \n12 BNl, NCC, and FSM Telecommunications Cable Corporation will set up the consortium under C&MA to implement \nand operate the EMC system. \n13 https://www.southerncrosscables.com/. \n14 ADB. 2016.

The project is estimated to cost $40.0 million (Table 1). Detailed cost estimates by \nexpenditure category and financier are included in the project administration manual (PAM).17 In \nKiribati, ADB will fund the leasing, by the Government of Kiribati from SXC, of the branching unit, \nspur, and capacity in NEXT cable for Kiritimati. In Nauru, ADB will fund Nauru\u2019s portion of the \nEMC supply and installation, and construction of the cable landing station in Nauru. ADB will also \nfund the PMUs in Kiribati and Nauru. \n \nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates ($ million) \nItem  Amount \nA.  Base Costa    \n  1.

The World Bank \nwill provide joint grant financing of $36.2 million to the project (footnote 2) to fund the Tarawa and \nthe FSM component of the EMC system. The Government of Kiribati and the Government of \nNauru will make the proceeds of the grants available to the cable operating companies, BNL in \nKiribati and NCC in Nauru, through onlending arrangements.18 The Government of Kiribati and \nthe Government of Nauru will exempt taxes and duties of $3.0 million. The Government of Nauru \nwill also support the operation of NCC during project implementation with a cash contribution of \n$0.4 million. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economic  Development  (MFED)  in  Kiribati  and  the \nDepartment of Finance and Economic Planning (DFEP) in Nauru will be the executing agencies \nfor the project. The Government of Kiribati has established BNL, which will work with NCC and \nthe FSM Telecommunications Cable Corporation, to install and operate the EMC system for the \nTarawa portion of the EMC system, and will directly contract SXC (justified in para. 9) for the \ninternet service for Kiritimati island. NCC as the cable operating entity for Nauru will implement \nand operate the submarine cable with respect to the Nauru portion of the EMC system, in \ncollaboration with other consortium members.  \n \n18.  For the EMC system, the three cable companies of Kiribati, Nauru, and the FSM (NCC, \nBNL, and FSM Telecommunications Cable Corporation) will sign a C&MA to formalize the \noperating  and  cost-sharing  mechanism  for  the  EMC  system.  NCC  and  BNL  will  be  the \nimplementing agencies19 and wholesale providers of the submarine internet bandwidth in their \nrespective  countries.  NCC  and  BNL  will  be  responsible  for  the  procurement  and  financial \nmanagement activities outlined below.  \n \n19.  The consortium members, under the supervision of the steering committee, will implement \nthe  EMC  system.  For  this,  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  will  enter  into  a  memorandum  of \nunderstanding that sets out detailed collaboration and coordination arrangements in relation to \nthis procurement, and the project more generally. The World Bank will be the coordinating \ncofinancier. Pursuant to the memorandum of understanding, the World Bank\u2019s guidelines and \nstandard bidding documents will be used, but all procurement decisions will be taken by mutual \nagreement between ADB and the World Bank. The World Bank\u2019s and ADB\u2019s procurement \nguidelines are largely harmonized, except for references to debarment lists. The final bidding \ndocuments will be agreed between ADB, the World Bank, and the respective governments. ADB \nwill be involved throughout the review process and exercise procurement oversight in accordance \nwith its usual procurement procedures and practices to ensure that the procurement is also \nundertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to \ntime), and that no company on ADB\u2019s sanction list participates in the bidding process. The World \nBank and ADB will use their best efforts to give effect to the other\u2019s eligibility requirements and \ndebarment lists. Further, contracts between the bidder and the borrower will contain a provision \npermitting the World Bank and ADB to inspect the project and to inspect and audit all records and \naccounts of any bidders, contractors, suppliers, or service providers as they relate to the project \nin accordance with their respective policies and procedures. \n \n20.  NCC will be responsible for the procurement of a civil works contractor to build the landing \nstation facilities in Nauru. Procurement will be conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \n                                                \n18 The terms and conditions of the subsidiary grant agreements will be subject to ADB\u2019s endorsement. \n19 ADB will enter into project agreements with NCC and BNL. \n ", "6 \nGuidelines. NCC will set up a PMU to coordinate with other steering committee members, \nvendors, and the financier. \n \n21.  As permitted under ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (para. 3.6[c]), using direct contracting \nwith SXC of Australia as the only service provider for a contract of about $20 million, BNL will sign \na service agreement covering MPA, CUA and LPA for the right to use for 25 years the branching \nunit and spur connecting Kiritimati island to SXC\u2019s NEXT system, the landing station, as well as \nthe terminal equipment in Kiritimati. BNL will have a capacity of 30 gigabits per second on NEXT \nfor the next 15 years through the CUA. The CUA will also include SXC\u2019s provision of operation \nand maintenance for the branching unit and spur for 15 years. Kiribati will have a PMU to \ncoordinate  the  work  in  Kiritimati.  The  PMUs  will  also  help  the  executing  agencies  and \nimplementing agencies to meet all the technical and safeguard-related project covenants. \n \n22.  Two consulting firms will be recruited to support NCC and BNL in the implementation of \nthe respective components of the project for a total of about 100 person-months of inputs. \nConsultants will be recruited using the quality- and cost-based selection method (with a quality\u2013\ncost ratio of 90:10), in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended from time to time). \n \n23.  Retroactive financing and contracting. The Government of Kiribati has requested \nADB\u2019s approval of retroactive financing for the reimbursement of $0.35 million paid to SXC in May \n2017 for marine surveys needed to better understand technical specifications and improve the \nnegotiation position for the Kiritimati connection. SXC conducted surveys for the entire length of \nits  cable,  and  inclusion  of the  Kiritimati  section  obviated  the  costs for  a  separate  survey. \nRetroactive financing will be less than 2% of the total ADB grant amount and is for eligible \nexpenditures incurred prior to grant effectiveness, but not earlier than 12 months prior to the \nsigning of the grant agreement. The Government of Kiribati understands that approval of this \nretroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the project. Following SXC\u2019s requirement, \nKiribati has signed the contracts with SXC in November 2017 (before ADB Board of Directors \nconsideration) to allow SXC to finalize the selection of the cable supplier.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n \n25.  A submarine cable is the preferred, most cost-effective, and most sustainable method for \ninternet connectivity, with well-established and proven technology. In both Kiritimati and Nauru, \nthe cable landing stations will be connected to the existing local networks for internet service to \nthe public, offices, and institutions. The EMC system will interconnect to Hantru-1 cable system \nin Pohnpei, FSM to reach Guam. The regional approach will help NCC share significant capital \nand operational costs. NEXT brought a cost-effective opportunity to connect Kiritimati through a \nbranching unit and spur. This will significantly reduce the cable operating risk and cost for \nKiritimati. \n \n26.  NCC and BNL will act as wholesale internet bandwidth providers and sell to local telecom \noperators in an equitable and nondiscriminatory way, following the telecom regulatory policy in \ntheir country. The telecommunication regulators will be responsible for maintaining the quality and \nprice of internet service. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n27.  Financial. The financial viability was assessed based on the financial sustainability of the \ncable wholesale providers over the cable\u2019s estimated life (2 years of system implementation, 15 \nyears  of right  of  use for  Kiritimati,  and  25  years  of full  operation for  Nauru).  A  top-down \nmethodology is used to predict adoption rates by benchmarking other broadband connectivity \nprojects in the Pacific region that correspond to the islands\u2019 current demand distribution across \nits telecommunication services. Price per Megabits per second was set to ensures cost recovery \nand competitiveness of high-speed satellite services, passing on potential financial benefits to \ncustomers through wholesale price reductions. Tourist subscribers, particularly in the case of \nKiritimati, were also considered in the analysis. \n \n ", "8 \n28.  The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is estimated at 8.2% for the Kiritimati, Kiribati \ncomponent and 8.3% for the Nauru connection. Each is about equal to the respective weighted \naverage costs of capital. Cash flows for both components are sensitive to revenue and cost \nshocks, but risks are considered low because (i) demand and resulting revenue projections were \nconsidered at a growth rate well below similar implementations in the Pacific; and (ii) cable system \ncost and operating cost estimates are based on similar cable project developments in the region.  \n \n29.  Economic. The project\u2019s economic benefits largely arise from an expansion in internet \npenetration facilitated by improvements in coverage (i.e., Kiribati\u2019s current O3b system does not \nreach the outer islands including Kiritimati) capacity, reliability, and affordability. Benefits are \nvalued based on consumers\u2019 willingness to pay, which corresponds to the entire area under their \ndemand curve. This is the sum of two components: (i) the annual consumer surplus and (ii) the \nannual revenue per user for retail internet services.21 \n \n30.  Evaluating project costs against benefits, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) under \nthe base-case scenario is estimated at 14.0% for the Kiritimati connection and 10.3% for the \nNauru component.22 Both are above the minimum required EIRR for ADB investment projects of \n9%. Sensitivity analysis confirms that economic viability is maintained even with a 20% lower \nprojected benefit, a 10% capital cost overrun, or a 10% increase in operating expenditures. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n31.  Financial management. Public financial management performance in Kiribati\u2014including \nbudgeting  management,  monitoring,  and  evaluation\u2014has  improved  with  broader  economic \nreforms.23 Nauru has an underdeveloped Public Finance Management system, though significant \nimprovements were made in some of the Public Finance Management indicators since the initial \nassessment in 2010.24 In May 2017, the Audit Office tabled public accounts for fiscal year 2014 \nduring a parliamentary session, closing a 15-year audit gap. \n \n32.  BNL and NCC are newly established, so the financial management risk is assessed as \nhigh. During implementation, both BNL and NCC will be supported by PMUs with an experienced \nfinance and accounting specialist to manage accounting and reporting within 6 months of the \nproject effectiveness date. A comprehensive time-bound action plan has been developed in the \nPAM to mitigate the risk. \n \n33.  Procurement capacity. Overall, the procurement risk in Nauru is high.25 The steering \ncommittee has been supported by a consulting firm, funded by ADB, to prepare the procurement \ndocuments and conduct the bidding process for the EMC. Kiribati\u2019s procurement governance is \ninadequate with thin distribution of limited procurement skills, incomplete scope of audit, and \nvariations in policies and practices.26 The Kiritimati component of the project will be procured \nthrough a direct lease from SXC. ADB funded a technical consultant to support the Government \n                                                \n21 For conservative valuation, benefits are considered to grow in line with real gross domestic product growth (assumed \nat 2.0% per annum) and capped between 2.5% and 3.5% of gross domestic product. \n22 Economic analysis of the project was undertaken on the basis of constant 2017 prices and a world price numeraire, \nusing a standard conversion factor of 0.83 for Kiribati and 0.89 for Nauru, and a shadow wage rate factor of 0.90 for \nKiribati and 0.85 for Nauru. The methodology is detailed in Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Kiribati. 2014.

NCC and BNL will recruit permanent staff\u2014including a chief executive officer, technical \nengineer, and accountant\u2014to run their business before the cable systems become operational. \nThere will be sufficient overlap between the permanent staff and PMU consultants to maintain an \nuninterrupted business operation. \n \n35.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the governments, MFED, and DFEP. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 20). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n36.  In Kiribati and Nauru, causes of poverty and hardship include limited access to basic social \nservices and limited access to opportunities for gainful income. Better internet access can \nintroduce new livelihood opportunities for women who tend to stay on their island, whereas many \nyoung men travel overseas. More reliable internet will also offer the potential to improve delivery \nof government and social services through ICT application in health, education, and governance. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n37.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.27 \n \n38.  Environment (category B). Laying the cable on the seafloor will affect a narrow corridor \nand the project will have site-specific impacts that can be readily mitigated and/or managed. The \nproject will impact a corridor about 0.3\u20130.5 meters wide on the seafloor and, in some locations, \nup to 0.75 meters beneath the sediment. An environmental and social impact assessment was \nprepared for the main part of the cable (Kosrae\u2013Nauru\u2013Kiribati) and an initial environmental \nexamination was undertaken for the Kiritimati section. A detailed oceanographic survey of the \nalignment  will  be  completed  during  the  design  period  and  will  include  updating  of  the \nenvironmental  and  social  impact  assessment,  initial  environmental  examination,  and \nenvironmental management plan, and integration of the updated environmental management \nplan in the contract specifications. Compliance will be monitored by the PMUs. Overall project \nprogress reports will include safeguard matters and be submitted to ADB each quarter. \n \n39.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The project has been classified as \ncategory C on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. Due diligence confirmed that the \nproject components in Kiribati and Nauru do not require land acquisition and resettlement, and do \nnot impact any distinct and vulnerable group of indigenous peoples. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n40.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.28 \n \n                                                \n27 ADB.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n41.  The Government of Kiribati, Government of Nauru, DFEP, and MFED have assured ADB \nthat implementation of the project shall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those \nconcerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the PAM and grant documents. \n \n42.  The Government of Kiribati, Government of Nauru, DFEP, and MFED have agreed with \nADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the draft grant agreements and \nproject agreements. \n \n43.  As a condition to effectiveness of the grant to the Republic of Kiribati, the subsidiary grant \nagreement between the Government of Kiribati and BNL, in form and substance satisfactory to \nADB, will have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the government and BNL and will \nhave become legally binding upon the government and BNL in accordance with its terms. As a \ncondition to effectiveness of the grant to Nauru, (i) the C&MA will have been signed on behalf of \nNCC,  BNL  and  FSM  Telecommunications  Cable  Corporation  upon  terms  and  conditions \nsatisfactory to ADB; (ii) NCC, BNL and FSM Telecommunications Cable Corporation will have \nobtained approval for the financing of their respective shares of the C&MA, including cofinancing \nfrom development partners (if applicable); and (iii) the subsidiary grant agreement between the \nGovernment of Nauru and NCC, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, will have been duly \nexecuted and delivered on behalf of the government and NCC and will have become legally \nbinding upon the government and NCC in accordance with its terms.  \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n44.  I am satisfied that the proposed grants would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the grant not exceeding \n$21,600,000 to the Republic of Kiribati and the grant not exceeding $15,000,000 to Nauru, both \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund), for the Improving Internet \nConnectivity for Micronesia Project, on terms and conditions that are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft grant and project agreements presented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n6 March 2018\n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nTelecommunications in the Micronesian subregion improved \nData Sources and \nPerformance Indicators  Reporting \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks  \nOutcome  By 2020:  a.
