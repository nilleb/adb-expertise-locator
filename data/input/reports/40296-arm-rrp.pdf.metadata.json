An initial environmental examination (IEE) for two \nAssessment  core  subprojects  was  undertaken.  A  summary  IEE  and  an \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  procedure  were  also \nprepared.    \nProject Description  The Project follows a sector lending approach and supports the \nGovernment\u2019s  objective  of  human  development  by  providing \nimproved  access  to  sustainable  water  supply  and  sanitation \n(WSS)  services.  The  Project  consists  of  two  components: \n(i) component  A:  municipal  infrastructure  rehabilitation  and \nimprovement, and (ii) component B: management improvement \nand  capacity  development.  Component  A  consists  of  about \n18 subprojects,  each  covering  a  cluster  of  small  towns  and \nvillages.  Component  B  focuses  on  improving  the  operating \nefficiency  of  WSS  service  providers.  The  Project  will  cover \n16 towns and 125 villages in seven provinces; and provide WSS \nservices to about 576,000 people, about 25% of whom are living \nbelow the poverty line. \n \nRationale  Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the efficiency of \n  water  management  in  Armenia  declined  because  of  economic \ncollapse, inadequate investments, and lack of management skills. \nConsequently, capital investments in infrastructure and operation \nand maintenance of WSS systems throughout the country were \nneglected. Consumers faced serious problems with shortage and \npoor quality of drinking water, and lack of wastewater disposal \nfacilities.  At  present,  over  60%  of  the  WSS  infrastructure  in \n50 towns and 300 villages is in very poor condition, and about \n50% of the water and sewer networks needs major rehabilitation \nand/or  replacement.  Mechanical  and  electrical  equipment  is \nobsolete and the system designs and standards are outdated. \nSewer pipes are broken and clogged, and wastewater treatment \nplants are not operating fully. Unaccounted-for water ranges from \n40%  to  90%  in  various  towns  and  villages,  and  most  people \nreceive water for only 2\u20138 hours a day. Poor sanitation facilities \nand  leaking  sewers  are  creating  serious  health  risks  and \nenvironmental  hazards.  The  Government  of  Armenia  (the \nGovernment) has mobilized $170 million of investment in the WSS \nsector from the international donor community for disbursement \nbetween  1997  and  2011.  Since  there  is  a  considerable  gap \nbetween the overall needs and available financial resources, the \nGovernment requested assistance from the Asian Development ", "ii   \nBank (ADB) for the proposed Project to (i) improve the existing \naverage 6 hours of drinking water supply to at least 12 hours for \nall by 2012 with safety and reliability, (ii) ensure safe disposal of \nsewage  from  the  project  area,  and  (iii)  improve  the  operating \nefficiency of water service providers to ensure the sustainability of \nthe proposed interventions. By 2020, the Government intends to \nachieve 24-hour supply and 100% coverage of safe drinking water \n(from 88% in 2007), as well as 90% sanitation coverage (from \n60% in 2007).  \nTo  facilitate  systematic  improvement  of  WSS  services,  the \nGovernment  approved  a  water  policy  in  2002.  It  subsequently \nintroduced institutional and sector reforms by strengthening the \nlegislative  and  regulatory  framework,  restructuring  sector \ninstitutions, and mobilizing financial resources for infrastructure \nimprovement. It also approved the following laws: (i) Water Code, \n2002; (ii) Fundamental Provisions of the National Water Policy, \n2005;  and  (iii)  National  Water  Program,  2006.  These  legal \ninstruments have provided a foundation for improving the quality \nand efficiency of the WSS systems. \n \nTo  manage  and  administer  the  WSS  systems  effectively,  the \nGovernment  established  five  independent  WSS  operators. \nArmenian Water and Sewerage Company (AWSC) and Yerevan \nWater  and  Sewerage  Company  (YWSC)  are  the  two  main \noperators.  The  other  three  operators  are  small  municipal \ncompanies responsible for management of WSS systems in their \nmunicipalities.  \nAWSC  is  responsible  for  management  of  WSS  systems  in \n37 towns  and  300  villages.  Since  October  2004,  it  has  been \nmanaged  by  an  international  private  contractor  through  a \nmanagement  contract.  The  main  reasons  for  deciding  to \nimplement a management contract were as follows: (i) tariffs were \ntoo low to support a commercial operation, and the Government \nneeded to increase tariffs progressively or develop a system of \npublic  subsidies  compatible  with  private  sector  participation; \n(ii) the regulatory framework was new at that time and needed to \nbe experienced before implementing a long-term private sector \narrangement; (iii) the country lacked a good track record in public-\nprivate partnership; and (iv) the Government was facing difficulties \ngetting key stakeholders to agree to the long-term involvement of \nthe  private  sector  in  WSS.  Within  the  first  2.5  years,  the \nmanagement  contractor  improved  the  efficiency  of  AWSC\u2014\nincreasing revenue collection by 24%; decreasing energy costs by \n15%, water losses by 20%, and the number of employees by \n40%; and increasing the number of metered connections by 76%. \nThe performance targets in the management contract-controlled \narea for 2008 are 12-hour supply, 98% water safety compliance, \n76%  metered  water  connections,  and  90%  financial  operating \nefficiency. The current management contract will expire in October \n2008 and contains an option to extend for a further 2 years. The ", "  iii\nGovernment is exploring various options for deeper involvement \nof private operators in management of the company, including an \nextension of the current management contract, or establishing a \nlong-term lease or concession arrangement.  \nYWSC  is  responsible  for  management  of  the  WSS  system  in \nYerevan (the capital) and 33 nearby villages. Since 2005, YWSC \nhas  been  managed  and  operated  by  an  international  private \noperator through a 10-year lease contract.  \nThe Project will cover selected towns and villages under AWSC\u2019s \nresponsibility  and  some  selected  villages  under  none  of  the \noperators.  \nImpact and Outcome  The  impact  of  the  Project  is  improved  public  health  and \nenvironment for about 576,000 people living in the project towns \nand villages. The outcome of the Project is improved access to \nsustainable WSS in the project areas. The Project will focus on \noptimizing the operation of existing infrastructure and maximizing \nthe operating efficiency of WSS service providers, followed by \nconstructing new infrastructure. \n  \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $45.0 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $6.7 million.  \n \nFinancing Plan   ($ million) \n  Source  Total   %   \n  ADB  36.00  80.00  \n  Government    9.00  20.00  \n \n     Total  45.00  100.00  \n  ADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: ADB estimates. \nAllocation and Relending  It  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  in  various  currencies \nTerms  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  23,498,000  ($36  million \nequivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The loan will \nhave a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, and an \ninterest charge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter. \n \nThe  Government  will  relend  the  loan  to  AWSC,  the \nimplementation agency, under a subsidiary loan agreement upon \nthe same terms and conditions as the ADB loan. AWSC will bear \nthe foreign exchange risk and the Government will finance all the \ntaxes and duties. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2013 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2012 \nCompletion Date \nExecuting Agency  State Committee of Water Systems (SCWS), Ministry of Territorial \nAdministrations  \n ", "iv   \n   \nImplementation  A  project  coordination  unit  (PCU)  will  be  established  within \nArrangements  SCWS. A project management unit (PMU) will be established in \n  AWSC.  The  PMU,  supported  by  technical  and  management \n  consultants,  will  be  responsible  for  subproject  identification, \n  designs, construction supervision, and improvement of operational \n  efficiency and management of AWSC and the user communities. \n  The PCU will appraise the feasibility studies of the subprojects. A \n  project governing council (PGC) will be established at SCWS to \n  monitor  project  implementation  and  ensure  consistency  with \n  government  policies  and  programs.  The  Government  plans  to \n  prepare,  appraise,  and  award  all  the  contracts  within  the  first \n  2.5 years. \n   \nProcurement  All procurement financed under the Project will be carried out in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). Contracts for civil works estimated to \ncost  more  than  $1  million  equivalent  and  contracts  for  goods \nestimated to cost more than $500,000 equivalent will be procured \nusing international competitive bidding (ICB). Civil works contracts \nestimated to cost $1 million equivalent or less will be procured \nthrough  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB).  Goods  contracts \nestimated to cost between $100,000 and $500,000 equivalent will \nbe procured through NCB. Goods contracts estimated to cost less \nthan $100.000 equivalent will be carried out through shopping \nprocedures.  Goods  valued  below  $10,000  may  be  purchased \ndirectly from the supplier. \n \nConsulting Services  Inputs of 1,120 person-months of national consultants are planned \nfor project implementation and management support to the PCU \nand PMU. This type of consulting services is not new to Armenia \nand national consultants have already been providing high quality \nand  cost-effective  services.  The  selection  and  engagement  of \nthese consulting services will be in accordance with the quality \nand cost-based selection method of ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \nProject Benefits and  The  Project  is  expected  to  benefit  16  towns  and  about \nBeneficiaries  125 villages with an overall population of about 576,000 people, \n  25% of whom are living below the poverty line. The Project will \nimprove  public  health  and  environment  in  project  towns  and \nvillages.  Related  benefits  include  time  and  cost  savings  from \npurchasing,  fetching,  treating,  and  storing  water;  improved \nhygiene  and  health;  reduced  medical  outlays;  and  increased \nproductive  days.  The  Project  will  support  improvements  in \ntechnical and financial capacities, and operational efficiency of the \nservice providers.   \n ", "  v\nRisks and Assumptions  Potential risks associated with the Project include the following: \n(i) start-up delays may occur because AWSC is unfamiliar with the \nuse of ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines, (ii) delays may occur in \nagreed improvements to be made in financial and legal reforms, \nand (iii) the upward adjustment in tariffs may not be supported by \nall communities.   \n \nThe  Project  includes  the  following  measures  to  mitigate  these \nrisks: (i) during the Loan Fact-Finding Mission, AWSC was given \ndetailed  orientation  on  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  and \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. AWSC has already initiated \nadvance procurement actions under ADB\u2019s guidance. AWSC will \nbe further trained during the Loan Inception Mission; (ii) ADB\u2019s \npolicy  dialogue  with  the  Government  has  focused  on  sector \nimprovements  and  reforms.  To  ensure  compliance,  the \nGovernment  will  hold  PGC  meetings  quarterly  to  monitor \nimplementation of these reforms within the agreed time frame. \nThe ADB team will consistently follow up and work closely with the \nGovernment on the agreed actions; and (iii) the public outreach \nprogram\u2014including  media  campaign,  community  mobilization, \nand public workshops\u2014will be implemented to achieve community \nawareness and ownership in service delivery. Under this program, \nbeneficiaries will be involved in planning, designing, implementing, \nand operation and maintenance of the subprojects. Communities \nwill be educated in proper water and hygiene practices, and in \ntheir  responsibilities  as  beneficiaries  to  pay  for  the  improved \nservices.  \n \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Armenia for the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  Armenia is a mountainous landlocked country located in the southern Caucasus. It has a \nland area of approximately 28,700 square kilometers and shares land borders with Azerbaijan, \nGeorgia,  Iran,  and  Turkey.  Based  on  National  State  Statistics  Association  estimates,  the \npopulation was about 3.22 million in 2006 of which about 64% lives in urban areas and the \nremainder in rural villages. About half the urban population lives in Yerevan, the capital city. The \npopulation is forecast to grow at 0.3% per annum through 2015. For administrative purposes, \nArmenia is divided into 10 marzes (provinces) that are subdivided into districts, and consist of \ntowns and villages. The proportion of the population living in poverty was 29.8% in 2005. Most \nof the country\u2019s poor lives in regional towns where the incidence of poverty is about 38%. \n3.  To  improve  people\u2019s  living  standards,  the  environment,  and  public  health,  the \nGovernment  of  Armenia  (the  Government)  is  prioritizing  improved  delivery  of  water  and \nsanitation (WSS) services. To address serious difficulties being faced by the majority of the \npopulation because of unsafe and unreliable water supply and inadequate sanitation facilities, \nthe Government has mobilized financial resources, strengthened the legislative and regulatory \nframework, and restructured sector institutions. Since there is a considerable gap between the \noverall needs and available financial resources, the Government requested assistance from the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to prepare the proposed Project. ADB approved a small-scale \ntechnical assistance1 (TA) and fielded a Loan Fact-Finding Mission from 29 May to 15 June \n2007.  This  report  is  based  on  the  TA  report  and  the  Mission\u2019s  understanding  with  the \nGovernment. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.    \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n4.  Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the efficiency of WSS management in \nArmenia  declined  because  of  economic  collapse,  inadequate  investments,  and  lack  of \nmanagement  skills.  Consequently,  capital  investments  in  infrastructure  and  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) of WSS systems throughout the country were neglected. Consumers faced \nserious problems with shortage and poor quality of drinking water, and lack of wastewater \ndisposal facilities. At present, over 60% of the WSS infrastructure in 50 towns and 300 villages \nis  in  very  poor  condition,  and  about  50%  of  the  water  and  sewer  networks  need  major \nrehabilitation  and/or  replacement.  In  several  towns  and  villages,  mechanical  and  electrical \nequipment is obsolete, and the system designs and standards are outdated. Sewer pipes are \nbroken and clogged, and wastewater treatment plants are not operating fully. Unaccounted-for \nwater (UFW) ranges from 40% to 90% and most people receive water for only 2\u20138 hours a day. \nPoor sanitation facilities and leaking sewers are creating serious health risks and environmental \nhazards. \n5.  The sector performance indicators for 2006 show the following:  \n(i)  About 88% of the population has access to drinking water supply. Out of this, 75% \nhas access to piped water supply. About 15% receives 24-hour services and others \nreceive intermittent water supply for 2\u20138 hours. The remaining 12% has no access \nto safe drinking water and relies on unsafe water sources. In rural areas, about 51% \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Armenia for the Municipal Service and Infrastructure \nDevelopment Sector Project. Manila (TA 4925-ARM, approved on 2 April, for $150,000).  ", "2 \nof households have taps inside houses; the rest rely on shared, external yard taps \nor  public  standpipes.  Drinking  water  is  drawn  mainly  (96%)  from  groundwater \nsources  through  boreholes,  wells,  and  springs.  The  groundwater  resources  are \ngenerally high quality.  \n(ii)  In urban areas, about 60% of households have access to sanitation services but the \nsystems  are  seriously  degraded.  In  rural  areas,  communities  make  their  own \nprovision for sanitation, which is inadequate.  \n(iii)  The operating efficiency2 of water service providers ranges from 25% to 40%, \nprompting high government subsidies. UFW ranges from 40% to 90% and revenue \ncollection efficiency3 ranges from 50% to 75%. The main causes of low operating \nefficiency are low revenue, high operating costs, and high UFW. Low revenue is \nmainly caused by low quality of management and services, inefficiency of billing and \ncollection, inadequate legal powers given to service providers against non-payers, \nand a poor existing tariff structure with no system of future tariff planning. High costs \nare due to overdesigned and dilapidated faulty infrastructure, old and inefficient \npumps, high cost of electricity, and lack of system maintenance. The high level of \nUFW  is  due  to  system  leakages,  illegal  connections,  and  service  payment \ndefaulters.  \n6.  To facilitate systematic improvement of WSS services, the Government approved a \nwater  policy  in  2002.  It  subsequently  introduced  institutional  and  sector  reforms  by \nstrengthening the legislative and regulatory framework, restructuring sector institutions, and \nmobilizing financial resources for infrastructure improvement. It also adopted an important water \npolicy and legal framework comprising the following: (i) Water Code, 2002; (ii) National Water \nPolicy, 2005; and (iii) National Water Program, 2006. This framework covers, among others, the \nestablishment of water management institutions; the principles of integrated water management \nand river basin management; management, protection, and conservation of water resources; \nsupervision  of  water  standards  and  reserves;  security  of  adequate  water  supply  to  the \npopulation and the economy; and mandatory preparation of short, medium, and long-term \ninvestment  programs.  This  provides  the  foundation  for  the  policy,  and  the  sustainable \nmanagement and operation of the WSS systems. The main principles of the National Water \nPolicy relevant to the WSS sector are (i) provision of safe drinking water of the required quantity \nand  sanitation  to  meet  the  basic needs  of all  the  population,  including  socially  vulnerable \ngroups; (ii) efficient management of water resources and water systems by the application of \nwater  pricing  criteria;  (iii)  assuring  the  gradual  introduction  of  a  24-hour  water  supply; \n(iv) maintaining sanitary and hygienic standards; (v) assuring water resources management \nthrough  \u201cuser  pays\u201d  and  \u201cpolluter  pays\u201d  principles  and  cost  recovery  approaches;  and \n(vi) managing water resources and water systems in a transparent and participatory manner, \nassuring gender policy principles and public participation processes. The summary of the WSS \nsector policy is in Appendix 2, the summary of the sector road map is in Appendix 3, and the \nsector investment plan in Supplementary Appendix A. \n7.  In January 2004, the Government adopted the Law on Regulatory Body for Public \nServices which entrusted the Public Services Regulatory Commission with the authority to \nregulate public utilities in the energy, water, and telecommunications sectors. The law sets an \nenabling legal framework for an independent agency responsible for setting fair and just tariffs in \na transparent and sustainable manner.   \n                                                 \n2 Operating efficiency is the ration of revenue from water sales and operating cost. \n3 Revenue received as percentage of the amount billed. \n ", "3 \n8.  The Government\u2019s law on local self-government delegates responsibility for providing \nWSS services to the local level. Local town municipalities and village administrations own the \nwater distribution networks within their administrative areas. The state owns the water resources \nand main infrastructure from source to the town or village entry point, and delivers bulk water \nthrough established WSS companies. Town municipalities and village administrations can either \n(i) buy bulk water from the water company and manage the distribution networks themselves, \nwhich only works well when town municipalities and village administrations have adequate \ncapacity and the WSS is simple to operate; or (ii) enter into an agreement with the water \ncompany to manage the WSS systems and collect the water tariff directly from individual \nconsumers. Town municipalities and village administrations in general lack the managerial and \ntechnical capacity and financial resources to manage WSS systems, so they are gradually \nadopting option (ii).  \n9.  The legislation has enabled restructuring of the sector institutions. The State Committee \nof Water Systems (SCWS) was established as a key sector governing body. Its responsibilities \ninclude  (i)  management,  operation,  and  safe  use  of  all  state-owned  WSS  systems; \n(ii) participation  in  preparation  and  implementation  of  the  National  Water  Program;  and \n(iii) development and implementation of the water sector investment policy and programs. To \ndischarge  its  duties  and  responsibilities,  SCWS  has  established  five  independent  WSS \ncompanies. Yerevan Water and Sewerage Company (YWSC) covers the capital city and 33 \nnearby villages. The Armenian Water and Sewerage Company (AWSC) delivers service to 37 \ntowns and about 300 villages throughout the country. Shirak Water and Sewerage Company \n(SWSC), Lori Water and Sewerage Company (LWSC), and Nor Akunq Water and Sewerage \nCompany (NWSC) are small regional service providers for towns and villages in their respective \nregions. \n10.  YWSC is a commercial company managed and operated through a lease contract by an \ninternational water utility operator. The three regional water companies are owned 51% by the \nGovernment and 49% by the respective municipalities, and are operated and managed as \npublic municipal entities. AWSC is owned by the Government, and has 4 regional branches and \n34  sector  units  spread  over  the  country.  It  has  an  experienced  and  well-trained  team  of \nengineers, financial managers, and technical specialists; and has been managed through a \nmanagement contract by an international water utility operator since 2004. The main reasons for \ndeciding to implement a management contract were as follows: (i) tariffs were too low to support \na  commercial  operation,  and  the  Government  needed  to  increase  tariffs  progressively  or \ndevelop  a  system  of  public  subsidies  compatible  with  private  sector  participation;  (ii)  the \nregulatory framework was new at that time and needed to be experienced before implementing \na long-term private sector arrangement; (iii) the country lacked a good track record in public-\nprivate partnership; and (iv) the Government was facing difficulties convincing key stakeholders \nto agree to long-term involvement of the private sector in WSS. Within the first 2.5 years, the \nmanagement contractor improved the efficiency of AWSC\u2014increasing revenue collection by \n24%; decreasing energy costs by 15%, water losses by 20%, and the number of employees by \n40%; and increasing the number of metered connections by 58%.4 The performance targets in \nthe  management  contract-controlled  area  for  2008  are  12-hour  supply,  98%  water  safety \ncompliance,  76%  metered  water  connections,  and  90%  financial  operating  efficiency.  The \ncurrent management contract will expire in October 2008 and contains an option to extend for \nfurther 2 years. The Government is exploring various options for deeper involvement of private \noperators in management of the company, including extension of the current management \ncontract, or establishing a long-term lease or concession arrangement. A team of experts \nfinanced by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) will review the \n                                                 \n4 Armenian Water and Sewerage Company Progress Report, 2007 \n ", "4 \npotential for long-term private sector involvement. ADB undertook a study on the performance of \nAWSC  and  the  options  for  public-private  partnership  in  the  WSS  system  in  Armenia 5  \n(Supplementary Appendix B). Given the success of the management contract for AWSC, which \nhas brought increased system knowledge and improved performance for AWSC, the study \nrecommends  to  (i)  develop  a  10-year  lease  arrangement  for  AWSC,  to  commence  after \nOctober 2008 when the existing management contract expires; (ii) in parallel, make a major \nadjustment to tariffs to achieve cost recovery of O&M costs and replace the current subsidy; and \n(iii) include three small regional companies in the AWSC lease arrangement. \n  \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n11.  Municipal Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Improvement. The degraded condition of \nWSS infrastructure throughout the country and the high level of UFW are major contributors to \nthe poor quality of service and high operating costs. The overdesigned and aging WSS systems \nhave  made  it  impossible  to  operate  the  WSS  systems  efficiently  and  effectively.  The \nGovernment\u2019s main priority is to improve people\u2019s living standard by providing them with basic \nservices, mainly safe and reliable water supply and improved sewerage facilities. This will be \nachieved through financial investments and effective management in (i) water supply, focusing \nas a first priority on optimal use of the existing infrastructure by rehabilitating and replacing the \ndeteriorated water supply infrastructure, reducing leakage, and improving supply pressure; then \nextending new mains to reinforce supply to new consumers and installing water meters to all \nconsumers; and (ii) sewerage improvement by cleaning existing sewers and carrying out urgent \nrepairs of damaged sewers that are polluting water supply in selected towns and villages, and \nextension of sewers to new consumers, followed by wastewater treatment.  \n12.  Operational  and  Financial  Management.  In  general,  the  WSS  companies  have \nsufficient  managerial  and  technical  capability,  but  suffer  from  a  centralized  management \nstructure that lacks clearly defined statements of functions, duties and responsibilities, and \noperating procedures. To become sustainable, companies need to improve their operational \nefficiency,  reform  their  management  structure,  and  introduce  cost-saving  and  revenue-\nimproving measures to make operations more efficient and cost-effective.   \n13.  Sound financial management is the key to improving the operating efficiency of the water \nsupply companies. Financial management needs to be improved in two main areas: (i) revenue \ncollection,  which  can  be  increased  by  (a)  reforming  billing  and  collection  procedures; \n(b) updating the consumer database to register all new and illegal consumers, and classifying \ncustomers by their payment history and targeting intermittent payers and persistent non-payers \nwith  public  outreach  programs,  and  granting  legal  powers  to  companies  to  enforce  a \ndisconnection  policy  for  defaulters  of  WSS  bills,  and  metering  all  the  connections;  and \n(ii) operating costs, which can be reduced by introducing improved cost control and budgeting \nsystems and procedures and by implementing cost reduction techniques. Prime areas for cost \nreduction include reducing electricity costs and eliminating redundant administrative costs.       \n14.  Tariff Reform. The sector urgently needs a clear and transparent system of tariff setting \nto take into account the service costs and impact of inflation. At present, an inflexible tariff \nstructure applies a standard rate across the country. The cost of supplying water from a source \nthat requires pumping is higher than the cost of supplying water by gravity. This cost difference \nis not reflected in the tariff, so there is an internal cross-subsidy as consumers in low production \ncost areas subsidize consumers in high production cost areas. In general, the tariffs are low and \nthe tariff structure is not adequate. Further, the Government has to subsidize the revenue \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Armenia for the Study on Analysis and Evaluation of the \nOptions for Public-Private Partnership in Water Supply and Sanitation System of Armenia. Manila. \n ", "5 \nshortfall because of the low collection efficiency. To help ensure the sustainability of the overall \nWSS operations, there is an urgent need to rationalize existing tariffs with an adequate tariff \nstructure for all types of domestic, commercial, and bulk consumers; meter all the connections; \nand introduce a tariff plan that includes progressive tariff revision, taking into account service \ncost and inflation. All these measures should be linked with improved service delivery and \nsound operational management to ensure people\u2019s willingness to pay.  \n15.  Service  Delivery  Targets.  The  Government  aims  to  achieve  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals with respect to WSS and by 2015, halve the number of people who are \ncurrently without access to safe water and adequate sanitation. SCWS is updating the sector \nstrategy for providing safe and reliable water supply to the population in three stages: \n \n(i)  For poor rural communities in remote areas, which are not covered by existing \nservice providers, the target is to provide a basic lifeline supply of 50 liters per capita \nper day (lpcd) through public standpipes located not more than 100 meters from the \nhouse.  \n(ii)  For towns and villages, where safe drinking water can be supplied by the local water \ncompany, the target for 2012 is piped water supply for at least 12 hours per day with \ncost recovery through the tariff sufficient to cover O&M costs. \n(iii)  The ultimate target for 2020 is to provide 24-hour water supply to all towns and \nvillages, with adequate pressure and full cost recovery. \n16.  Policy Dialogue. ADB\u2019s policy dialogue with the Government has focused on (i) cost \nrecovery and tariff reforms by (a) rationalizing existing low tariffs and implementing a tariff plan \nthat includes progressive tariff revision to ensure full cost recovery and adequate funds for loan \nrepayment;  (b)  eliminating  government  subsidy  on  tariffs;  (c)  granting  legal  powers  to \ncompanies to enforce disconnection policy for defaulters of WSS bills to improve collection \nefficiency, deter nonpayment, and ensure the sustainability of WSS operations; (ii) enterprise \nreforms and corporate governance, ensuring full autonomy for AWSC to manage and operate \nWSS services without any outside interference, disseminate annual reports on its operation and \ndevelopment each year, and implement a systematic program of organization development; \n(iii) water conservation through metering all the connections and urgently reducing UFW; and \n(iv)  institutionalization  of  community-based  operations  to  address  the  existing  problem  of \nunclear ownership of systems in villages and weak management for O&M. \n17.  External Assistance. The Government has attracted investments in the WSS sector \nfrom  the  international  donor  community  amounting  to  about  $170  million  for  disbursement \nbetween  1997  and  2011.  Yerevan  has  received  about  $56  million  and  the  other  regions \n$114 million. The proposed Project will be the first WSS project financed by ADB in Armenia.   \n18.  The World Bank has supported projects for Yerevan water supply, municipal water and \nwastewater, and rural dam safety. German development cooperation through Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr \nWiederaufbau (KfW) has invested in the three regional water supply companies. The Japan \nSocial Development Fund has implemented a community water supply project and Millennium \nChallenge Corporation is supporting irrigation infrastructure. EBRD has approved a project for \nLake  Sevan  environmental  protection  and  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  is \nundertaking a feasibility study on rural water supply and sanitation. The United States Agency \nfor International Development is planning a water supply project for two small towns. Further \ndetails are in Appendix 4.   \n19.  Lessons  Learned.  A  review  of  ADB-wide  experience  with  rehabilitation  assistance \nindicates that projects should (i) be prepared promptly, (ii) focus on infrastructure investment in \ncombination with management improvement, (iii) feature a flexible implementation process, \n ", "6 \n(iv) provide  strong  consulting  support  and  ADB  supervision  during  implementation,  (v)  be \nsupported by prompt government action, (vi) ensure that decision making on core issues of \nproject design and implementation be decentralized to achieve timely project preparation and \nimplementation, and (vii) ensure that intensive consultations with all stakeholders are held and \nall the required information is disseminated during preparation and implementation of projects.    \n20.  Since this is ADB\u2019s first project in the WSS sector in Armenia, it has no direct experience \nin  this  sector  in  Armenia.  However,  experience  from  other  externally  assisted  projects  in \nArmenia shows that (i) the well-developed legal and regulatory framework enables smooth \nimplementation  of  sector  reforms,  (ii)  decentralization  of  water  sector  operations  and \nmanagement through the creation of area-based water companies is effective and can deliver \nimprovements in the key sector performance indicators, (iii) improvements in service delivery \nalone  do  not  necessarily  yield  increased  revenue,  and  (iv)  public  outreach  programs  to \npersuade people to pay, and enforceable sanctions against persistent non-payers are needed. \nADB\u2019s  experience  in  similar  projects  in  other  regions  shows  that  improvements  in  O&M, \nincluding  specific  programs  to  reduce  levels  of  UFW,  represent  a  cost-effective  and \nenvironmentally  responsible  approach  to  water  management  and  should  form  essential \ncomponents of future ADB-financed projects. The proposed Project has been carefully designed \nto reflect each of these lessons. \n21.  Sector Loan Approach. The Project could not be processed as a standard project loan \nbecause of the large number of relatively small subprojects that are geographically dispersed \nand needed to be implemented urgently. The sector loan approach is based on the following. \n(i)  The  Government\u2019s  sector  policies,  development  objectives,  and  approach  to \nregional WSS systems development are well formulated. Progress in implementing \npolicies  has  been  satisfactory  and  the  Government  is  consistently  updating  its \nsector policies with donor support. \n(ii)  Sector  institutions  are  well  developed  and  their  capacity  will  strengthen  with \nadditional  strengthening  and  support  provided  under  the  Project.  SCWS,  the \nExecuting Agency (EA), and AWSC, the Implementing Agency (IA), have substantial \nexperience of implementing similar projects. \n(iii)  The  sector  investment  plan  and  planned  subprojects  are  well  conceived  and \nappropriately formulated. \n22.  The Government has submitted three documents needed for sector lending: (i) sector \ndevelopment  plan,  (ii)  description  of  sector  policies,  and  (iii)  assessment  of  capacity  to \nimplement the plan. These documents have been found in order.   \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n23.  The  impact  of  the  Project  is  improved  public  health  and  environment  for  about \n576,000 people living in 16 towns and about 125 villages through safe and reliable water supply \nand improved sewerage and sanitation facilities. The Project will help the Government provide \nthe required institutional and management support to AWSC and local municipal governments \nto enable them to be more self-disciplined in financial, managerial, and technical aspects. \n24.  The  outcome  is  improved  access  to  safe,  reliable,  and  sustainable  WSS  services \nmanaged on commercial principles and environmentally sound practices. The Project will focus \nfirst  on  optimizing  the  operation  of  existing  infrastructure  and  maximizing  the  operating \nefficiency of WSS service providers, followed by constructing new infrastructure. \n ", "7 \n25.  The Government provided a list of indicative 18 subprojects covering towns and villages \nwhere there is a desperate need for urgent WSS improvements (Appendix 5). The project team \nreviewed the feasibility studies of two candidate subprojects. One represents a typical provincial \ntown and the other a typical group of five village communities. The purpose of the review was to \ndemonstrate  the  approaches  and  procedures  of  subproject  selection  and  appraisal.  The \nappraisal indicates that both subprojects are feasible in terms of technical, institutional, social, \nfinancial, economic, and environmental aspects (Supplementary Appendix C).  \n \nB.  Outputs \n26.  The  Project  comprises  the  following  main  components:  (i)  municipal  infrastructure \nrehabilitation and improvement, and (ii) management improvement and development.  \n1.   Component A:  Municipal Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Improvement \n27.  This  component  comprises  two  parts:  (i)  rehabilitation  and  extension  of  distribution \nsystems, and (ii) improvement of sewerage systems. The first part will address rehabilitation \nand replacement of the deteriorated water supply infrastructure by reducing leakage; improving \nsupply pressure; constructing new mains to connect new consumers, particularly poorly served \nlow-income  communities;  installing  water  meters  to  all bulk  and  domestic  consumers,  and \nrepairing/remodeling  water  intakes,  pumps,  flow  meters,  valves,  and  treatment  units;  and \nproviding new storage reservoirs and tubewells at technically viable locations. The second part \nwill address improvement of the sewerage system by cleaning existing sewers and carrying out \nurgent repairs/replacement of damaged sewers that are polluting water supply in selected towns \nand villages. This part also includes the provision of sewer cleaning machinery and other \nessential equipment required for efficiently operating WSS systems.    \n28.  By  redesigning  the  overall  WSS  systems,  this  component  addresses  the  existing \nproblems  of  the  systems  being  overdesigned/under-designed.  It  also  includes  updating  of \nconsumer databases, conversion of illegal connections to registered accounts, and monitoring \nof water quality. To demonstrate 100% water supply coverage, 100% metering, 24-hour water \nsupply with the desired pressure, and 100% collection efficiency, the Project will select a pilot \nzone  and  concentrate  resources  to  undertake  the  related  actions.  This  will  help  gain  the \nconfidence of all consumers in the project area in an efficient and strongly governed WSS \nsystem, and help the IA to replicate it smoothly. Selection of the pilot zone will be based on \nactive participation and strong commitment of the users, apart from technical considerations to \nisolate the zone hydraulically for the required water pressure after addressing all the water \nlosses.        \n2.  Component B: Management Improvement and Capacity Development \n29.  This  component  addresses  core  issues  and  challenges  being  faced  by  AWSC, \nmunicipalities,  and  communities  in  managing  the  WSS  systems  efficiently.  Management \nefficiency will be improved by a combination of technical, financial, legal, and public outreach \nmeasures. The overall tasks to be carried out are as follows. \n   a.  Improvement of Operating Efficiency of AWSC \n30.  Planned interventions are (i) training in technical and financial management for AWSC \nstaff,  including  mapping  and  asset  management;  (ii)  improving  the  financial  management \nsystem by introducing improved accounting procedures, computerized billing, and management \ninformation systems (including budgeting, inventory of assets and staffing, O&M of assets, \nbilling,  revenue  collection,  and  reporting  systems);  (iii)  rationalizing  existing  tariffs  and \n ", "8 \nintroducing a tariff plan that includes progressive tariff revision by including inflation and cost of \nservices; (iv) measures for cost reduction such as electricity and redundant administrative costs; \n(v) increasing public awareness on water quality and sustainability of facilities, and options for \nimproving delivery of WSS services; and (vi) improving regulatory systems to ensure that laws, \nstandards, rules, and regulations are equitably and consistently applied. Wherever possible, \ntechnical training will be linked to measurable outputs to help determine whether skill levels \nhave  been  achieved  and  technical  training  is  applied.  The  design  and  implementation  of \nmeasures for improved municipal management will be coordinated with ongoing projects funded \nby other donors. \n31.  Under  this  subcomponent,  AWSC  will  receive  assistance  to  strengthen  the  service \ncontracts  between  the  company  and  municipal  governments  on  the  use  of  locally  owned \ndistribution networks, and between the company and communities taking a bulk water supply\u2014\nto define the relationship between the parties better. A disconnection policy for non-payers will \nbe framed to formulate proposals for empowering AWSC to implement this policy, and an \nincentive plan will be prepared for regular payers. A human resource development strategy will \nbe furnished, which will include rightsizing and training of staff and improved business rules. \nThis will clearly define the functions, duties, and responsibilities of the management structure \ngiving it autonomy to manage the systems independently. A public outreach program will be \nimplemented  to  achieve  community  ownership  in  service  delivery.  Under  this  program, \nbeneficiaries will be approached for their involvement in planning, designing, implementing, and \nO&M of the subprojects. Communities will be educated in proper water and hygiene practices, \nand their responsibilities as beneficiaries to pay for the improved services. It will be ensured that \ngood practices and lessons are disseminated both within Armenia and in other regions.  \n32.  This  subcomponent  will  support  AWSC\u2019s  plan  of  organizational  restructuring  and \nperformance improvement, which will result in establishing and streamlining operations of the \nfinancial, technical, and asset management and procurement directorates.  \nb.  Improvement of Communities\u2019 Management Skills \n33.  This subcomponent will build the capacity of communities to operate, manage, and \nmaintain  their  own  small-scale  WSS  systems  effectively  in  a  sustainable  manner.  Major \nactivities will comprise (i) training programs in technical management and operation of small \nwater  systems,  including  water  source  protection;  (ii)  preparation  of  manuals  in  the  local \nlanguage for regular sampling, testing, and treatment of drinking water; (iii) basic WSS system \nmaintenance and repair, and reporting to AWSC for assistance in case of major breakdowns; \n(iv)  improved  financial  management,  including  budgeting,  billing  and  collection,  and \nbookkeeping; and (v) overall system administration.  \nC.  Special Features \n34.  Optimization of Existing Infrastructure. The Project will adopt a logical sequence of \ninterventions.  Since  large  investments  already  made  on  the  existing  infrastructure  are  not \ndelivering efficient services, the primary focus will be on optimizing the operation of existing \ninfrastructure and maximizing the operating efficiency of WSS service providers, instead of \nupfront  construction  of  new  infrastructure.  This  will  allow  the  Project  to  economize  the \ninvestment, achieve considerable development impacts, and ensure sustainability of the WSS \nsystem with sound technical and financial management.    \n35.  Pilot Zoning. To demonstrate 100% water supply coverage, 100% metering, 24-hour \nwater supply, and 100% collection efficiency, the Project will select a pilot zone and fix all the \nidentified problems related to physical interventions and improved governance. This will help \ngain the confidence of consumers in the project area in an efficient and strongly governed WSS \n ", "9 \nsystem that can work for people\u2019s welfare, and help the IA to replicate it smoothly in other \nproject areas.    \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n36.  The project investment cost is estimated at $45.0 million, including $6.7 million of taxes \nand duties. A summary of the cost estimates is in Table 1, and detailed cost estimates are in \nAppendix 6. \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n  Item  Amounts \nA.  Base Cost a b  \n  1.

Financing Plan \n37.  The Government has requested a loan of $36.0 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a \ngrace period of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  The  Government  will  finance  about  $9.0  million  (20%).  The \nfinancing plan is summarized in Table 2 and details are in Appendix 6.  \n38.  The country cost-sharing limit has not yet been determined for Armenia. At present,   \nADB financing in Armenia has a cost-sharing limit that would have applied to Armenia prior to \nthe Innovation and Efficiency Initiative policies as of August 2005, which is 75%. Considering \nthat the Project targets poor communities that are currently facing serious problems of shortage \nand poor quality of drinking water caused by deteriorated infrastructure, a 5% variance from the \nsaid cost-sharing limit is justified.    \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total  % \nAsian Development Bank  36.00  80.00 \nGovernment    9.00  20.00 \n  Total  45.00  100.00 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "10 \n \n39.  The Government of Armenia will relend the loan to AWSC under a subsidiary loan \nagreement upon the same terms and conditions as the ADB loan. AWSC will bear the foreign \nexchange risk and the Government will finance all the taxes and duties. The project flow of \nfunds is in Appendix 7.  \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n40.  SCWS,  the  EA,  will  coordinate  project  implementation  and  establish  a  project \ncoordination unit (PCU) headed by a project coordinator. The PCU, comprised of two national \nwater supply and sewerage consultants, and one national financial analyst/economist, will be \nresponsible for appraising subprojects, and preparing the project completion report with AWSC. \nA representative of the PCU will be included in the procurement tender commission. The PCU \nwill coordinate closely with ADB, the project management unit (PMU), and other government \nagencies. The PCU will ensure that its technical staff is involved in the feasibility studies, which \nwill facilitate appraising the subproject in a timely manner. \n41.  AWSC, the IA, will establish a PMU to implement the Project located both inside and \noutside AWSC\u2019s existing service zone. The PMU, supported by a team of consultants, will be \nresponsible for preparing the subproject feasibility studies, detailed engineering designs, and \ntender documents; and undertaking construction supervision of all subprojects. The PMU will be \nheaded  by  a  project  manager  and  staffed  by  the  WSS  engineer/monitoring  specialist, \nprocurement  specialist,  financial/accounting  specialist,  and  support  staff.  The  PMU,  in \ncoordination with the PCU, will recruit the project consultants. Appendix 8 shows the project \nimplementation  framework  and  Supplementary  Appendix  D  elaborates  implementation \narrangements.  \n42.  A project governing council (PGC) will be set up as a high-level advisory body within \n1 month of loan effectiveness. The PGC will (i) be headed by the chair of SCWS, part of the \nMinistry  of  Territorial  Administrations  which  coordinates  all  the  municipalities  and  local \nadministrations; and (ii) include senior officers from AWSC, Ministry of Finance and Economy,  \nMinistry of Nature Protection (the environment agency), SCWS, and other ministries as may be \nrequired,, and civil society representatives of the project beneficiaries. The PGC shall operate in \naccordance  with  Resolution  No.  765  \u201cOn  the  Activities  of  Project  Implementation  with  the \nProceeds of Loans and Grants Provided to the Republic of Armenia by Foreign States and \nInternational Financial Institutions\u201d, dated December 22, 1999; and shall be responsible for \n(i) guiding the overall policy and strategic direction of the Project, (ii) reviewing and evaluating \nproject/subproject performance, and (iii) assisting with coordination among other donor-funded \nprojects relating to the WSS. The PGC will meet quarterly to ensure orderly implementation, \nprovide policy guidance on ongoing and new government initiatives, and facilitate interagency \ncooperation and coordination among concerned national and local government bodies. \n2.  Subproject Selection, Preparation, and Appraisal \n43.  The subprojects will be selected in accordance with the following basic criteria: (i) the \nsubproject is in conformity with the Government\u2019s sector policies, development objectives, and \nstrategy of WSS system development; (ii) the existing water supply network and equipment of \nthe  subproject  are  dilapidated,  corroded,  and  leaking  and/or  sewer  pipes  are  broken  and \nclogged\u2014resulting in serious water supply shortages and adverse environmental problems; \n(iii) the subproject is technically viable, considering least-cost and technically sound options, \nand is economically and financially feasible; (iv) for villages that are not covered under AWSC, \nvillage administration/communities will, on a long-term basis and in a manner acceptable to \n ", "11 \nSCWS, commit to (a) provide periodic (at least semi-annual) inspection of the WSS system, \nwater source and catchments, water supply treatment, and otherwise comply with technical and \nsanitary requirements in accordance with Armenia\u2019s legislation, and (b) engage managerial and \ntechnical support and training from AWSC with respect to operation and maintenance of WSS \nsystem within their responsibility; (v) the subproject complies with ADB safeguard policies and \nhas no significant environmental impacts; and (vi) the subproject can be completed within the \nproject implementation period. Further details are in Appendix 9.  \n44.  The subprojects will be located both within and outside AWSC\u2019s existing service zone. \nMunicipalities located outside the AWSC service zone, to be included under the Project, are \nthose that intend to join the AWSC service zone. Among the municipalities not served by any \nservice provider, priority will be given to those that currently receive bulk water from AWSC. \n45.  The PMU, with the support of technical consultants and participation of PCU technical \nstaff, and in consultation with local governments and beneficiary communities, will prepare a \nfeasibility study for each short-listed subproject. The PMU will prepare and submit to PCU the \nfeasibility  study  report,  which  will  include  technical,  financial,  environmental,  and  social \nsafeguard assessments. The PCU will prepare the subproject appraisal report for the EA\u2019s \napproval.  The  subproject  appraisal  report  for  the  first  subproject,  and  for  any  subproject \nexceeding $2 million equivalent, will require ADB approval. \n3.  Implementation Period \n46.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  in  5  years,  starting  in  2008.  An  estimated \nimplementation  period  is  based  on  the  large  number  and  wide  geographic  distribution  of \npotential  subprojects.  The  implementation  schedule  of  the  Project  is  in  Appendix  10.  The \nGovernment plans to prepare, appraise, and award all the contracts within the first 2.5 years. \n \n4.  Procurement \n47.   Except as otherwise provided below, procurement financed under the Project will be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). Contracts for civil works estimated to cost more than $1 million equivalent and contracts \nfor goods estimated to cost more than $500,000 equivalent will be procured using international \ncompetitive bidding (ICB). Civil works contracts estimated to cost $1 million equivalent or less \nwill be carried out through national competitive bidding (NCB). Goods contracts estimated to \ncost between $100,000 and $500,000 equivalent will be procured through NCB. Procurement \nunder NCB will be carried out in accordance with Armenia\u2019s law on procurement of 1 January \n2005, subject to modification and clarifications set forth in the Loan Agreement. Goods contracts \nestimated to cost less than $100,000 equivalent will be procured through shopping procedures. \nGoods valued below $10,000 may be purchased directly from the supplier. In such cases, ADB \nshould be satisfied that the price paid is reasonable. The award of all contracts shall be subject \nto prior approval by ADB. The procurement plan is in Appendix 11. \n \n48.  The country presently imports pipes, pumping equipment and fittings from non-ADB \nmember countries. Restricting procurement of this equipment procurement to ADB member \ncountries  may  preclude  civil  works  contractors  under  the  Project  from  obtaining  the  best \neconomic terms, and may seriously erode economic efficiency. It is proposed that civil work \ncontractors under the Project be allowed to procure this equipment for WSS improvement works \nfrom all countries, including from countries that are not ADB members. \n \n49.  Simple,  minor,  and  remotely  located  civil  works  may  be  difficult  to  undertake  by \ncontractors at a reasonable cost. Such works may be undertaken by AWSC using its own staff \n ", "12 \n(force account), provided the works cost less than $10,000 equivalent. Force account will only \nbe used if AWSC has adequate construction facilities, including equipment and the capacity to \nundertake the works expeditiously and at a reasonable cost. \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n50.  To  support  project  implementation  and  build  the  long-term  capacity  of  SCWS  and \nAWSC, which are responsible for the planning and delivery of WSS services, 1,120 person-\nmonths  of  national  consulting  services  will  be  provided,  covering:  (i)  package A:  project \nimplementation and management support to the PCU and PMU, including subproject feasibility \nstudy, appraisal, and training (324 person-months); and (ii) package B: detailed engineering \ndesign and construction supervision (796 person-months). For package A, individual national \nconsultants will be recruited and tasks under package B will be carried out by a firm. The \nGovernment has agreed to recruit individual consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s procedures \nfor recruiting individual consultants. This type of consulting services is not new to Armenia and \nnational consultants have already been providing high quality and cost-effective services on \nother projects. Supplementary Appendix E details the terms of reference for consultants. \n51.  Selection and engagement of consulting services for package B will be in accordance \nwith  the  quality  and  cost-based selection  method  and  full  technical proposal  under  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n6.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n52.  To meet the service delivery targets set by the Government, it is essential to commence \nthe  preparation  of  subprojects  in  2007.  The  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  approve \nadvance contracting and retroactive financing for feasibility studies, taking preparatory actions \nto establish the PCU and PMU, and start recruitment of project implementation consultants. The \nconsultants, PMU, and PCU will undertake necessary surveys and prepare subproject feasibility \nstudies and detailed engineering designs.     \n53.  Advance contracting allows the Government to undertake procurement procedures, at its \nown risk, prior to the loan becoming effective. The Government was informed that, for expenses \nincurred  under  advance  contracting  to  be  eligible  for  ADB\u2019s  retroactive  financing,  such \nprocedures  (including  advertising)  must  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  and \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. Once the loan becomes effective, up to 20% of the loan \nmay be used to finance eligible expenditures incurred, pursuant to advance contracting, during \nthe period not exceeding 12 months prior to signing the Loan Agreement. Alternatively, the \nGovernment may opt for advance contracting without retroactive financing, in which case the \nprocurement procedures completed under advance contracting do not conclude with the award \nof  contract  until  after  the  loan  becomes  effective.  The  Government  acknowledges  that  it \nundertakes such advance contracting at its own risk, and that any concurrence by ADB with the \nprocedures, documentation, or proposal for award of contract does not commit ADB to finance \nany such expenditures or the Project. The ADB project team provided orientation to AWSC staff \nregarding ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.   \n \n7.  Anticorruption Policy \n54.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  EA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \n ", "13 \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n8.  Disbursement Arrangements \n55.  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). The PMU of AWSC, as IA, will open and \nmanage an imprest account after loan effectiveness. Disbursements from the imprest account \nwill be supported by an appropriate withdrawal application and related documentation. Such \ndocumentation will demonstrate that the goods/services (i) were produced and procured from \nADB  member  countries,  and  (ii)  are  eligible  for  ADB  financing.  The  initial  amount  to  be \ndeposited into the imprest accounts will not exceed the estimated eligible expenditure for the \nnext 6 months, or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. The statement of expenditures \nprocedure may be used for reimbursement of eligible expenditures; any individual payment to \nbe reimbursed or liquidated under the procedure will not exceed the equivalent of $100,000. \n9.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n56.  The PMU will prepare quarterly progress reports indicating progress made, problems \nencountered  during  the  review  period,  steps  taken  or  proposed  to  remedy  the  problems, \nproposed program of activities, and progress expected for the following quarter. The PMU will \nensure that the reports are consolidated and submitted to ADB in a timely manner. Within \n6 months of physical completion of the Project, the PMU, in coordination with the PCU, will \nsubmit a project completion report. \n57.  The PCU and PMU will maintain records and accounts that identify the goods and \nservices financed from the loan proceeds, financing resources received, expenditures incurred \nfor the Project, and use of local funds. The accounts will be established and maintained in \naccordance with sound accounting principles and appropriate accounting standards. The annual \nproject accounts of PCU and PMU, and each set of financial statements, will be audited by \nauditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  A  separate  audit  report  on  the  use  of  imprest  accounts  and \nstatement of expenditures procedure will be provided to ADB. The audit reports, management \nletter, and related financial statements will be submitted to ADB not later than 6 months after the \nend of the fiscal year to which they relate, or the project closing date if earlier. ADB has \ninformed the Government of its policy on submission of audited accounts, which covers failure \nto submit audited accounts and financial statements by the due date. A formal warning will be \nissued for accounts more than 6 months overdue, and disbursements will be suspended for \naccounts that are 12 months overdue.  \n \n10.  Project Performance Management and Evaluation \n58.  A  short-list  of  verifiable  performance  indicators  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  was \nprepared during the TA (Supplementary Appendix F). SCWS and AWSC will ensure that a \ncomprehensive  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS)  is  established  and \nmaintained to monitor and evaluate the technical performance and social and economic benefits \nof the Project, especially for the poor and for women. The performance monitoring indicators \nand procedures will be tested with respect to data availability and other constraints, revised if \nnecessary, and institutionalized as part of the Project\u2019s management information system. The \nPMU will be responsible for establishing the PPMS, and monitoring and assessment of the \nperformance  of  subprojects  at  6-month  intervals.  To  measure  the  Project\u2019s  impact  on \nbeneficiaries, particularly low-income groups, baseline information established during the TA will \n ", "14 \nbe updated at the beginning of implementation of each project component. This information will \nbe  the  basis  for  determining  the  resulting  impacts.  Indicators  that  can  be  monitored  will \ncomprise:  (i)  institutional  improvement  indicators,  covering  revenue  generation,  financial \nmanagement,  O&M,  and  UFW;  (ii)  subproject  implementation  indicators  for  the  various \ncategories, including levels of coverage and service delivery; and (iii) sectoral impact indicators, \ncovering economic growth, public health, and community participation. AWSC will continue to \nupdate and forward the PPMS to ADB at 6-month intervals for at least 3 years after project \ncompletion. The relevance and practicability of data collection for the indicators were confirmed \nwith SCWS and AWSC.  \n \n11.  Project Review \n59.  Review missions will be undertaken twice a year for the first 2 years and once a year \nthereafter. ADB and the Government will undertake a midterm review 3 years after project \nimplementation  begins.  This  review  will  include  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  scope, \nimplementation arrangements, resettlement, achievement of scheduled targets, and progress \nwith the policy reform agenda and capacity building measures. Feedback from PPMS activities \nwill also be analyzed.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Environmental Impacts and Benefits \n60.  Overall,  the  Project  provides  environmental  benefits  by  improving  sanitation  and \nproviding  safe,  reliable  water  supply  to  towns,  villages,  and  communities.  Two  initial \nenvironmental  examinations  (IEEs)  were  carried  out  (Supplementary  Appendix  G)  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002), Environmental Assessment Guidelines,6 \nand Armenian environmental guidelines. One IEE was prepared for a provincial town and the \nother for a group of five village communities.  \n61.  The  IEEs  demonstrated  that  towns  and  communities  in  Armenia  have  WSS \ninfrastructure in dire need of rehabilitation. The sample town showed that 70% of the total water \nsupplied  is  lost  through  leakage.  In  addition,  water  supply  is  only  available  for  typically             \n4\u20136 hours a day because electricity is costly. Furthermore, rural communities have not had \nconstant water supply in more than 15 years. Since then, they buy water delivered by tankers \nfrom bigger communities or manually transport water from springs. \n62.  To improve the WSS systems, the Project includes the construction and rehabilitation of \nwater supply mains and distribution pipelines, repair of water pump stations, construction and \nrehabilitation of sewer pipelines, and construction and repair of water storage reservoirs. These \nphysical  improvements  do  not  pose  any  significant  adverse  environmental  effects.  The \nproposed sources, both spring and groundwater, demonstrate good water quality. \n63.  The screening process carried out for the IEEs has identified minor possible adverse \nenvironmental impacts likely to be caused by the Project. Most potential negative impacts may \noccur during construction. However, they will be temporary and can be mitigated to acceptable \nlevels. Effort will be made to (i) protect the sources, (ii) minimize construction pollution and \nwaste,  and  (iii)  limit  specific  impacts  related  to  the  pipeline  routes.  A  summary  IEE  is  in \nAppendix 12. \n64.  To  ensure  environmentally  sustainable  implementation  of  the  subprojects,  an \nenvironmental assessment and review procedure was prepared in accordance with applicable \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2003. Environmental Assessment Guidelines. Manila. \n ", "15 \nenvironmental  requirements  of  ADB  and  the  Government,  including  an  environmental \nmonitoring and management plan. This will guide AWSC during the environmental assessment \nprocess for subprojects to prevent or mitigate adverse environmental impacts with mitigation \nmeasures  (Supplementary  Appendix  H).  In  addition,  a  proposed  institutional  arrangement \ninvolving representatives from SCWS, Ministry of Health, and Ministry of Nature Protection will \nensure  minimization  of  any  adverse  environmental  issues  and  compliance  with  all \nenvironmental policies of Armenia. Overall, according to the findings of the IEEs, the Project will \nhave significant positive impacts on the quality of life and environment for beneficiaries; and will \nensure environmental safeguards for implementing a continuous, reliable water supply and \nadequate sanitation facilities.  \nB.  Social Dimensions \n1.  Poverty Reduction and Social Benefits \n65.  Poverty and social analysis was conducted during project preparation. The Project will \nbenefit a total population of about 576,000 people (of which 49% live in regional towns and 51% \nin rural communities) through safe drinking water and improved sanitation. Of the total, about \n140,000 beneficiary households (about 25% of the households) are poor and receive poverty \nfamily  benefit.  The  poverty  reduction  and  strategy  paper 7   highlights  the  importance  of \ninvestments in basic rural infrastructure. It gives priority to the construction and rehabilitation of \nrural roads, optimization of health and educational facilities, improving access to safe and \nreliable drinking water, ensuring 24-hour supply and improving the quality of the water supply, \nand an irrigation program aimed at increasing the share of irrigated land and regulation of the \nirrigation  water  supply  systems.  A  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in \nAppendix 13 and details are in Supplementary Appendix I. \n66.  The Project will support poverty reduction by (i) reducing the incidence of waterborne \ndiseases, costs of medical care, and sick days taken\u2014reducing household health expenditures; \n(ii) decreasing the workload for women in the house\u2014providing the opportunity for them to \nbecome more involved in social and economic activities; (iii) providing safer and more reliable \nwater supplies; (iv) improving the quality of life of the urban and rural population, particularly the \npoor, by increasing their access to safe drinking water and improving hygiene and sanitation. \n67.  A survey and interviews were conducted with key stakeholders, including consumer \norganizations,  SWSC  employees,  and  condominiums.  The  results  indicated  that  people\u2019s \npriorities  for  the  Project  included  improving  (i)  hours  and  quality  of drinking  water  supply, \n(ii) basic  sanitation,  (iii)  service  affordability  for  socially  vulnerable  groups,  and  (iv)  public \nawareness programs and participatory schemes.  \n68.  Armenia\u2019s social protection for the poor includes a family benefit program that assists \nabout 30% people below the poverty line.8 The ongoing meter installation program has enabled \nhouseholds  to  reduce  water  service  expenditure  significantly.  The  affordability  analysis \nundertaken during the TA indicates that expenditure for water is within acceptable international \nstandards of 2\u20135% of household income. Awareness and education programs related to water \nsector development issues\u2014such as water conservation, tariff increase, and promoting public \nhygiene\u2014will be part of the project implementation. Social indicators (such as accessibility of \nwater supply services to all social groups), gender, and health indicators related to waterborne \ndiseases will be assessed through socioeconomic surveys and monitored annually as part of \nthe PPMS. \n                                                 \n7  Republic of Armenia. 2003. Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. Yerevan. \n8  The poverty line was AMD20,289 ($58.7) per person per month at the end of 2005. \n ", "16 \n69.  Gender. A large part of the Project\u2019s benefits will accrue to women. The Project will \naddress  gender  issues  by  (i)  strengthening  the  role  of  women  representatives  in  sector \nmanagement; (ii) involving women\u2019s groups in community-level project activities; (iii) including \nwomen  from  local  government  institutions  in  training  activities;  (iv)  conducting  community \ntraining and mobilization campaigns for project beneficiaries in towns and villages to ensure \nactive participation of women; (v) encouraging women to participate in project implementation \nactivities;  and  (vi)  monitoring  effects  on  women  during  project  implementation  through  the \nmonitoring and evaluation system, in consultation with local governments.  \n2.  Indigenous People \n70.  An initial social assessment was carried out during project processing, covering all \npotential subprojects. Detailed socioeconomic evaluation of 125 communities and 16 towns has \nbeen conducted and six consultation meetings were held, including site visits with one town and \nfive communities. Extensive research on the remaining project areas has also been conducted. \nThese consultations confirmed that all people living in the project areas are ethnic Armenian so \nthere is no indigenous peoples\u2019 issue. \n3.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n71.  An initial resettlement due diligence screening shows that the Project will not have any \nresettlement issues. All possible resettlement needs were assessed in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  were  evaluated  in  terms  of  the  proposed \nconstruction to see if any people, land, businesses, crops, or other items of value would be \naffected by the Project. In accordance with the due diligence, all available engineering design \ndocuments were analyzed, community leaders were consulted, site visits were conducted, and \nconstruction  information  was  obtained  from  the  EA  and  IA.  Analysis  of  the  two  candidate \nsubprojects shows that they will not have any land acquisition or resettlement issues because \nall construction works will be located on property owned by AWSC, municipal land, or within \nrights-of-way assigned to municipal infrastructure. \n72.  If resettlement issues arise with future subprojects, the resettlement framework (RF) has \nbeen prepared to guide the PMU during detailed design and subproject implementation. The RF \n(Supplementary Appendix J) contains arrangements for preparing full or short resettlement \nplans (RPs) in preparation of the loan\u2019s subprojects, depending on the significance of the \ninvoluntary resettlement impacts. The RF includes (i) project description, with the likely scope, \nextent, and magnitude of the resettlement effects; (ii) screening procedures; (iii) resettlement \npolicy  principles  and  eligibility  criteria  that  are  consistent  with  the  policy  and  cover  all \ninvestments,  subprojects,  and  components  under  the  loan;  (iv)  resettlement  entitlements; \n(v) resettlement design criteria; and (vi) administrative, resourcing, and financing arrangements \nfor preparation, approval, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of full or short RPs. It also \nsets  out  provisions  for  strengthening  the  capacity  of  the  relevant  EA,  project  sponsor,  or \nfinancial intermediary to address resettlement issues. AWSC will screen subprojects before \nsubproject implementation and ensure, if needed, that the RP is prepared before the award of \nthe  civil  works  contracts  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy. \nResettlement implementation will be monitored by AWSC and an independent body.  \n \nC.  Institutional and Financial Benefits \n73.  The management improvement and development component under the Project and \ncontinued  policy  dialogue  with  SCWS,  AWSC,  and  self-served  communities  will  support \ninstitutional and financial reforms that will provide a more viable and sustainable basis for \nmanaging and operating the WSS systems. Supplementary Appendix K provides further details. \n \n ", "17 \nD.  Economic Analysis \n74.  The  economic  analysis  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nEconomic Analysis of Projects;9 and covers the economic rationale for government intervention, \nand goals and general design of the water supply sector investment plan (Appendix 14). The \neconomic rationale is sound, based on social responsibility to provide basic social services and \ncontrolling natural monopoly in drinking water supply. The goals of the investment plan are to \n(i) meet targets for water supply development, aiming for expanded service in both urban and \nrural  communities,  including  border  areas  strategic  to  national  security;  (ii)  increase \ncollaboration between the Government and the private sector; and (iii) improve the general \nhealth and well-being of the inhabitants, and increased awareness of the environment/ecology. \nThe  targets  of  the  investment  are  clearly  defined,  legally  established,  and  consistent  with \ngovernment goals for sustainable development in water supply as reflected in the water supply \nand sanitation investment plan covering 2000\u20132012. The plan to meet the targets is based on \nwater supply systems designed using least-cost solutions to best fit economies of scale; and \nbased on type and availability of water resources, different design technologies, locations, and \nplanning  horizons.  Other  project  goals  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  water  policy  as \nembodied in the Water Code include economic tools for water resources management and \nprotection, cost recovery and sustainability tariffs, conservation and economic use of water, and \nefficient decentralized management. \n75.  Economic analysis of the two candidate subprojects was undertaken as representative \nof  the  subprojects  included  in  the  sector  investment  plan.  The  major  economic  benefits \nassumed  are  based  on  resource  cost  savings  from  time  spent  by  households  on  water \ncollection.  Data  on  time  savings  for  water  collection  are  based  on  focus  discussions  with \npotential  beneficiaries  in  the  subproject  communities.  The  discussions  aided  in  eliciting \ninformation on the estimated time spent by household members collecting water from available \nsources, based on distance traveled and the average number of times the activity is performed \neach day. Data on average family income and minimum wages in the locality have been used to \nvalue the cost of the activity. The economic costs, consisting of capital investment and operating \ncosts, have been converted from financial costs using shadow pricing. The conversion factors \napplied are based on infrastructure projects of similar scope in the Central Asian region. The \nresults of the analysis show that undertaking the subprojects will result in an economic internal \nrate of return (EIRR) of 25% for Abovyan and 17.3% for Ararat. Tested under adverse economic \nconditions, the subprojects will yield EIRR exceeding the Economic Opportunity Cost of Capital \nat 12%. The benefit-cost ratio is 1.26 for the Abovyan subproject and 1.27 for the Ararat \nsubproject. Other benefits that cannot be quantified will accrue in general terms to economic \ndevelopment of the project areas as a result of improved water supply and sanitation. These \ninclude increased economic activities and output of commerce and industry, and improved \noperations of institutions such as schools and hospitals that require safe and sufficient water \nsupply.  Economic  benefits  will  likewise  accrue  from,  among  others,  increased  consumer \nsatisfaction; increased health benefits caused by disease prevention and a reduction in mortality \nrate; and increased fire protection, especially in crowded settlements and commercial areas. \n \nE.  Financial Evaluation \n76.  Financial analysis for the two subprojects was also undertaken. The analysis was based \non estimates using first quarter 2007 prices and demand projections consistent with existing \nlevels. The project cost estimates and financial projections in nominal terms after tax were \nconverted into real terms by adjusting for foreign and domestic inflation and currency fluctuation. \n                                                 \n9 ADB. 2007. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "18 \nThe financial internal rate of return for both subprojects is found to be well above the weighted \naverage  cost  of  capital  of  1.58%,  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis.  The  subprojects  are \nconsidered both financially viable and sustainable based on tariffs that are affordable even to \nrural communities. Sensitivity and risk analyses indicate that the financial internal rate of return \nfor the subprojects is robust under adverse conditions. \n77.  Financial  projections  were  prepared  for  the  subprojects  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects (footnote 9) of water supply projects (Appendix \n15). For these particular subprojects, the projected financial statements indicate that financial \nrevenues will be sufficient to cover O&M costs. As the two subprojects are typical of the other \nsubprojects, in terms of physical characteristics and their intended design scope, the indications \nare that the other subprojects will likewise be viable investments.  \n \nF.  Affordability Analysis and Project Sustainability \n78.  The subprojects will be prepared through the active participation of target beneficiaries \nfrom the initial stage of planning, design, and construction. Villages that will not join the AWSC \nservice zone will be responsible for O&M of the local schemes. Based on the sample focused \ndiscussions in the Ararat subproject with five villages, there is an apparent willingness among \nthe population to avail of and pay for improved water supplies. In towns and communities that \nare currently under AWSC service jurisdiction and where water service is deficient, willingness \nto  pay  for  improved  water  supply  service  is  high.  The  affordability  analysis  compares  the \naverage price of monthly water consumption to average monetary income in areas classified \n\u201curban\u201d for areas conceived to be under AWSC service, and \u201crural\u201d for areas outside AWSC \ncoverage. These values were found to be within acceptable limits of 5% of household income. \nFor instance, a candidate subproject in the Ararat region reflects revenues sufficient to cover \nO&M costs and depreciation, at affordable tariffs. However, a mechanism for tariff subsidization \nmust be established, especially in rural communities, in cases where affordability will limit \ntechnical  design  options.  The  Government  is  currently  evaluating  various  options  with  the \nassistance of the World Bank. \n  \nG.  Risks \n79.  Potential risks associated with the Project include (i) start-up delays caused by AWSC\u2019s \nunfamiliarity with the use of ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines, (ii) delays in agreed improvements \nto financial and legal reforms, and (iii) lack of community support for the upward adjustment in \ntariff.   \n \n80.  The Project includes the following measures to mitigate these risks: (i) during the Loan \nFact-Finding Mission, AWSC was given detailed orientation on ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \nand Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. AWSC has initiated advance procurement actions \nunder ADB\u2019s guidance and it will be further trained during the Loan Inception Mission; (ii) ADB\u2019s \npolicy dialogue with the Government has focused on the sector improvements and reforms. To \nensure  its  compliance,  the  Government  will  hold  PGC  meetings  quarterly  to  monitor \nimplementation of these reforms within the agreed time frame. The ADB team will consistently \nfollow up and work closely with the Government on the agreed actions; (iii) the public outreach \nprogram\u2014including media campaign, community mobilization, and public workshops\u2014will be \nimplemented to achieve community awareness and ownership in service delivery. Under this \nprogram, beneficiaries will be involved in planning, designing, implementing, and O&M of the \nsubprojects. Communities will be educated in proper water and hygiene practices, and in their \nresponsibilities as beneficiaries to pay for the improved services.  \n ", "19 \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n81.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and SCWS have given the \nfollowing specific assurances, which are to be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  SCWS will ensure that all subprojects to be financed under the Project are selected \nas per agreed subproject selection criteria. \n(ii)  The Government will ensure to provide AWSC and other service providers with \nadequate enforcement mechanisms and powers to effectively collect service fees \nand penalize defaulters of WSS bills in order to improve the collection efficiency, \ndeter nonpayment, and to ensure sustainability of WSS operations. \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that (a) a tariff plan is prepared for annual tariff settings \nthat takes into account the service costs and inflation which is implemented by \nJanuary 2009; and (b) a tariff is adopted in January 2010 that fully covers the \noperating cost.  \n(iv)  The Government will ensure that, to the extent possible, none of the subprojects will \nentail any land acquisition, conversion, donation, or restrictions of access that will \ntrigger ADB's Involuntary Resettlement Policy and that all project facilities remain, \nand project activities are conducted, within existing rights-of-way.

Introduction \n1.  Following  the  collapse  of  the  Soviet  Union,  the  performance  efficiency  of  water \nmanagement in Armenia declined because of mismanagement by weak institutions, inadequate \ncoordination  mechanisms,  and  economic  collapse.  Consequently,  the  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) of water supply and sanitation (WSS) systems throughout the country was \nneglected. Consumers faced serious problems with shortage and poor quality of drinking water, \nand lack of wastewater disposal facilities. In 50 towns and 300 villages, over 60% of the WSS \ninfrastructure is in very poor condition and about 50% of the water and sewer networks need \nimmediate  replacement.  Mechanical  and  electrical  equipment  is  obsolete  and  the  system \ndesigns and standards are outdated. Sewer pipes are broken and clogged, and wastewater \ntreatment plants are not operating. Unaccounted-for water ranges from 40% to 90% in various \ntowns and villages, and most people receive water for only 2\u20138 hours per day. Water supply is \nnot adequately disinfected and further pollution risks exist because of infiltration of groundwater \ninto the leak-prone distribution network. About 88% of small rural communities have access to \npiped water systems but only 50% houses have an inside water tap. Similarly, sewer systems, \nseptic tanks, and other sanitation facilities are broken and clogged\u2014creating serious health \nrisks and environmental hazards. \n2.  To improve WSS services, the Government has implemented comprehensive policy, \ninstitutional,  and  sector  reforms  by  strengthening  the  legislative  and  regulatory  framework, \nrestructuring  sector  institutions,  and  mobilizing  financial  resources  for  infrastructure \nimprovement. It also approved the following laws: (i) Water Code (the Code), 2002; (ii) National \nWater Policy (the Policy), 2005; and (iii) National Water Program (the Program), 2006. These \nlegal instruments provided the foundation for Armenia\u2019s WSS policy. \nB.  The Water Code   \n3.  The main objectives of the Code are (i) the establishment of appropriate water resource \nmanagement mechanisms; (ii) the conservation and protection of water resources including \nmitigation of pollution and consistent maintenance, and ensuring adequate monitoring of water \nstandards and overall national water reserve; (iii) to ensure adequate safe supply of drinking \nwater supply and its safe disposal, with regulated tariffs in place; (iv) to ensure efficient O&M of \nWSS  systems;  and  (v)  to  ensure  effective  management  for  systematic  development  and \nprotection of WSS systems.  \n4.  The  Code  required  the  creation  of  several  important  water  management  bodies, \nincluding  the  (i)  National  Water  Council,  (ii)  Dispute  Resolution  Commission,  (iii)  Water \nResources Management and Protection Body, (iv) Water Basin Management Bodies, (v) Water \nSystems Management Body, (vi) Board to Regulate Water Users Associations and Federation \nof Water Users Associations, and (vii) Regulatory Commission. The Code sets out the duties, \nfunctions, and responsibilities of each body. It also calls for the preparation of the Policy and the \nProgram, and sets out the principal objectives of each. It covers the conditions for the issuance \nand use of water use permits, and the use and management of state-owned water systems. The \nCode establishes the conditions for setting water quality standards and compliance criteria. An \nimportant provision of the Code deals with economic incentives, fees, and tariffs for WSS \nsystems.  \n \n ", "Appendix 2  25 \n \nC.  National Water Policy  \n \n5.  The main principles of the Policy relevant to the WSS sector are (i) provision of safe \ndrinking  water  of  the  required  quantity  and  sanitation  to  meet  the  basic  needs  of  all  the \npopulation, including socially vulnerable groups; (ii) efficient management of water resources \nand  water  systems  by  the  application  of  water  pricing  criteria;  (iii)  assuring  the  gradual \nintroduction  of  a  24-hour  water  supply;  (iv)  maintaining  sanitary  and  hygienic  standards; \n(v) assuring water resources management through \u201cuser pays\u201d and \u201cpolluter pays\u201d principles \nand cost recovery approaches; and (vi) managing water resources and water systems in a \ntransparent and participatory manner, assuring gender policy principles and public participation \nprocesses. \n \n6.  The Policy sets out the principles for developing the Program. It is envisaged that the \nProgram will present and update annually a detailed proposal for national water resources and \nwater  systems  development  and  management.  The  Program  will  propose  a  short-term \n(5 years), medium-term (10 years), and long-term (15 years) agenda to include all foreseeable \nwater resources and water systems development and management actions.  \n \nD.   Institutional Framework \n7.  The  Code  has  enabled  the  creation  of  a  new  institutional  framework  that  is  being \nimplemented by three agencies. The Ministry of Nature Protection, through its Water Resources \nManagement  Agency,  is  implementing  water  resources  management  and  protection.  The \nMinistry of Territorial Administration, through its State Committee of Water Systems (SCWS), is \nimplementing the management and operation of WSS systems. The Public Services Regulatory \nCommission is an independent body responsible for implementing tariff policy, including setting \ntariffs for different types of water use. \n8.  For the WSS sector, the key agency is SCWS. To manage and administer the WSS \nsystems, the following five closed joint stock companies have been created.  \n \n(i)  Armenian  Water  and  Sewerage  Company  (AWSC)  is  responsible  for  the \nmanagement, operation, maintenance, rehabilitation, improvement, and extension of \nWSS systems and services in 47 towns and more than 300 villages in Armenia. \nSince October 2004, AWSC has been managed and operated by an international \ncontractor through a management contract, with a life of 4 years until October 2008 \nand  an  option  to  extend  for  a  further  2  years  until  October  2010.  The  private \nmanagement  contractor  undertook  effective  management  measures  that  have \nimproved the operational performance of AWSC. To date, the collection rate has \nincreased from 59.0% to 82.6%; the proportion of energy in the operation costs \ndecreased by 36.2% to 21.5%; metering of connections has increased from 40% to \n71%; and the number of connections has increased from 259,900 to 267,100. \n(ii)  Yerevan Water and Sewerage Company (YWSC) is responsible for the operation, \nmanagement, and maintenance of WSS services in Yerevan and 33 nearby villages. \nSince 2005, YWSC has been managed and operated by an international contractor \nthrough a lease contract with a life of 10 years until 2015.  \n(iii)  Lori  Water  and  Sewerage  Company  (LWSC)  was  established  in  2005  and  is \nresponsible for WSS services in Lori region.  \n(iv)  Shirak Water and Sewerage Company (SWSC) was established in 2005 and is \nresponsible for WSS services in Shirak region. \n(v)  Nor Akunq Water and Sewerage Company (NWSC) was established in 2005 and is \nresponsible for WSS services in Nora Akunq region. \n ", "26   Appendix 2 \n9.  About 600 communities throughout Armenia are not covered by the established closed \njoint stock companies and make their own arrangements for WSS services. \n \nE.   Emerging Policy Issues \n10.  Based on the analysis of the Code and the Policy, and discussions with SCWS and \nAWSC, the following issues have been identified. \n11.  Management. In view of the small size of Armenia\u2019s population, the five closed joint \nstock companies lose the benefit of economies of scale, and small regional companies are not \nvery  effective  as  operating  costs  are  high  and  local  experience  is  deficient.  Improved \noperational efficiency is considered to be achieved by merging LWSC, SWSC, and NWSC with \nAWSC.  \n \n12.  Considering the ongoing improvements in the performance of WSS operation under \nAWSC, through the management contractor, the current management contract needs to be \nextended to 2010 in accordance with the contract option and the company should be prepared \nfor a lease contract which could be awarded in 2010 when the management contract expires. \nThe 10-year lease will allow preparation of AWSC towards concession, if investment is still an \nissue at that time and operator\u2019s view of concession risks improves. \n \n13.  Community-based  water  systems  are  under-resourced  and  poorly  operated  and \nmaintained.  A  local  government  and  community  based  training  program  in  the  operation, \nmanagement, and maintenance of small, community-based water supply systems\u2014covering \nsource protection, basic maintenance, financial management, and administration\u2014should be \nimplemented to improve operational and maintenance capability and capacity at the local level. \n \n14.  Tariffs.  At  present,  an  inflexible  tariff  structure  applies  a  standard  rate  across  the \ncountry. The cost of supplying water from a source that requires pumping is higher than the cost \nof supplying water by gravity. This cost difference is not reflected in the tariff, so there is an \ninternal cross-subsidy as consumers in low production cost areas subsidize consumers in high \nproduction cost areas. In general, the tariffs are low and the tariff structure is inadequate. \nFurther, the Government has to subsidize the revenue shortfall because of the low collection \nefficiency. There is an urgent need to rationalize the existing tariffs with a adequate tariff \nstructure for all type of domestic, commercial, and bulk consumers; meter all the connections; \nand introduce a tariff plan that includes progressive tariff revision, taking into account service \ncost and inflation. This will help ensure the sustainability of the overall WSS operations. All \nthese  measures  should  be  linked  with  improved  service  delivery  and  sound  operational \nmanagement to ensure people\u2019s willingness to pay. \n \n15.  Legal Framework. Existing contracts between service providers and municipalities do \nnot  fully  define  delineation  and  compensation  of  long-term  investments  made  by  service \nproviders in assets leased from municipalities. This kind of legal deficiency brings uncertainty \ninto the service providers\u2019 long-term financial positions and capital budgeting. Further, existing \nlegislation does not grant adequate legal powers to service providers to penalize defaulters of \nWSS bills.  \n \n16.  Current  tax  legislation  is  rigid  and  does  not  allow  service  providers  to  use  rapid \namortization of equipment purchase, limiting companies\u2019 ability to mobilize financial resources \nfor timely asset replacement and capital repair. The Government plans to address these gaps in \nthe near future. \n ", "   \nWATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SECTOR ROAD MAP \n \nIndicators \nBenchmarks   Past 5 Years  Current 2007  2008\u20132012  2013\u20132017  2018\u20132022 \n(+5 Years)  (+10 Years)  (+15 Years) \n         \nA.

The Government, represented by the State Committee of Water Systems (SCWS), has \nidentified total 19 towns and 263 villages that need immediate rehabilitation and improvement of \nexisting water supply and sanitation (WSS) systems, and construction of new WSS systems. All \nof the proposed towns and 145 out of 263 villages are currently served by the Armenian Water \nand  Sewerage  Company  (AWSC);  the  remaining  villages  are  not  covered  by  any  service \nprovider.  \n \nA.  Basic Criteria for Subproject Selection \n2.  Considering  the  large  number  of  proposed  towns  and  villages,  and  limited  loan \nresources, the investment subprojects will be carried out using the sector approach based on \nthe following selection criteria:    \n \n(i)  the  subproject  is  in  conformity  with  the  Government\u2019s  sector  policies, \ndevelopment objectives, and strategy of WSS system development; \n(ii)  the  existing  water  supply  network  and  equipment  of  the  subproject  are \ndilapidated, corroded and leaking, and/or sewer pipes are broken and clogged\u2014\nresulting in serious water supply shortages and adverse environmental problems;  \n(iii)  the subproject is technically viable, considering the least-cost and technically \nsound options, and economically and financially feasible;  \n(iv)  for  villages  that  are  not  covered  under  AWSC,  the  village \nadministration/communities  will,  on  a  long-term  basis  and  in  a  manner \nacceptable  to  SCWS,  commit  (i)  to  provide  periodic  (at  least  semi-annual) \ninspection  of  the  WSS  system,  water  source  and  catchments,  water  supply \ntreatment, and otherwise comply with technical and sanitary requirements in \naccordance  with  Armenia\u2019s  legislation,  and  (ii)  to  engage  managerial  and \ntechnical  support  and  training  from  AWSC  with  respect  to  operation  and \nmaintenance of WSS system within their responsibility; \n(v)  the subproject complies with Asian Development Bank (ADB) safeguard policies \nand has no significant environmental impacts (i.e., do not fall within category A or \ncategory  B  sensitive  subprojects  according  to  categorization  under  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy [2002]);  \n(vi)  communities are willing to participate in the subproject planning and design; and \n(vii)  the subproject can be completed within the project implementation period. \n \nB.  Subproject Prioritization \n3.  For  proposed  towns  and  villages  presently  covered  by  AWSC,  the  investment \nsubprojects will be prioritized based on the following criteria:  \n \n(i)  the proximity to the existing water source and distribution network supplying \nmultiple communities; and \n(ii)  the current WSS service is characterized by (a) insufficient quantity (less than \n24-hour service) because of high technical losses, (b) poor quality caused by  \n ", "38  Appendix 9 \ndilapidated distribution network and equipment, and (c) high cost of alternative \nsupplies.  \n \n4.  For  communities  not  currently  served  by  any  of  the  existing  WSS  providers,  the \ninvestment subprojects will be prioritized based on the following criteria:  \n \n(i)  safe and affordable alternative water supply is not available and/or the incidence \nof waterborne and related diseases are high; \n(ii)  existing water supply facilities or piped water supply system are deficient; \n(iii)  the potential for a water supply scheme that can serve multiple villages and \nreliable water sources is available;  \n(iv)  village administration/communities will provide commitment to undertake periodic \n(at  least  semiannual)  inspection  of  the  WSS  system,  water  source  and \ncatchments, water supply treatment, and otherwise comply with technical and \nsanitary requirements in accordance with the Government\u2019s legislation; and \n(v)   village administration/communities will arrange managerial and technical support \nand training from AWSC with respect to operation and maintenance of WSS \nsystem within its responsibility. \n \nC.  Subproject Prioritization for Feasibility Study \n4.  For proposed towns and villages presently covered by AWSC and prioritized according \nto criteria explained in section B, the feasibility studies will be carried out/prioritized based on \n(i) people\u2019s commitment to participate in system planning, design, and implementation; and to \npay agreed tariffs for improved services based on the detailed analysis of communities\u2019 demand \nand willingness to pay. Based on the results of these analyses, the communities will provide a \nwritten undertaking through water users\u2019 groups for the payments for improved and sustainable \nservices; and (ii) the data on area population, identified supply sources and their output and \ndistance measurements, the health and sanitation situation, and the environmental issues in the \narea have been identified. \n5.  For communities not currently served by any of the existing WSS providers, the priority \nfor undertaking feasibility studies will be set based on (i) village administration/communities\u2019 \nsigning a limited service agreement that will include semiannual inspection of the systems,  \nwater  source  and  catchments,  chlorination,  and  repair  of  WSS  system;  (ii)  presence  of \ncommunity-based organizations that are committed to run the system based on 100% operation \nand maintenance costs to be borne by the users; and (iii) village administration/communities\u2019 \nwillingness to receive training from AWSC in technical and financial management including  \noperation and maintenance, and tariff setting and budgeting.    \n ", "   \nIMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE \n \n2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012\nProject Stage/Component Activity A S ONDJFMAMJ J ASON D 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4\nStart-up Stage Establish PCU and PMU\n                     Notification of PCU and PMU\n                     Recruitment of Project Coordinator\n                     Recruitment of Project Manager\nRecruitment of Individual Consults (Package A)\n                     Advertisement in Newspapers\n                     Short-listing of Consultants\n                     Evaluation of Consultants\n                    ADB Approval and Selection\nRecruitment of Domestic Firm (Package B)\n                     Shorlisting of Firms\n                     First Submission for ADB Approval\n                     Issuance of Request for Proposals (RFPs)\n                     Submission of RFP and Evaluation \n                     Second Submission for ADB Approval\n                     Opening of Financial Proposals\n                    Third Submission\n                     Final Selection\nLoan Effectiveness\nUpdating Project Implementation Plan (PIP)\nOpening of Imprest Account\nFirst Withdrawal to Imprest Account\nPrequalification of Contractors\nImplementation of \nComponent A:  Baseline Socioeconomic Survey\nMunicipal Infrastructure\nRehabilitation and  Customer Needs Assessments\nImprovement\nTechnical Surveys\nFeasibility Studies\nA\n                       First Group of six Subprojects p\np\n                       Second Group of six Subprojects e\nn\n                      Third Group of six Subprojects d\nix\nA   p  p  r  a  i s  a  l   o  f   SFuirbstp Grorojeucpt sof six Subprojects    3App\n  e\n                      Second Group of six Subprojects   3nd\n                      Third Group of six Subprojects 9ix 1\nDetailed Engineering Design 0 \n                        First Group of six Subprojects\n3\n                       Second Group of six Subprojects 9\n \n                       Third Group of six Subprojects  \n ", " \n2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012\nProject Stage/Component Activity A S ONDJFMAMJ J ASON D 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 2\nPreparation of Bid Docs and  Bid  Invitation  1\n                         First Group of six Subprojects   \n \n \n                         Second Group of six Subprojects   \n \n                        Third Group of six Subprojects  A\nBid Evaluation and Award of Contracts p\n                        First Group of six Subprojects p\ne\nn\n                        Second Group of six Subprojects d\nix\n                        Third Group of six Subprojects    1\n0\nImplementation of Subproject  \n \nImplementation of    \nComponent B:    \nManagement Improvement  Training in Technical and Financial Management\nand  Development\nImprovement of Financial Management System\nRationalizing Existing Tariff and Introducing\n a Tariff Plan\nImplementation of Cost Reduction Measures\nImprovement and Measurement of Overall \nOperating Efficiency\nImprovement of Regulatory System\nImplementation of Public  Outreach Program\nWater Quality Monitoring and Rectification\nData Collection and Updating of PPMS  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PCU = project coordination unit, PMU = project management unit, PPMS = project performance management system. \nSource: ADB estimates.\n ", "Appendix 11  41 \n   \nPROCUREMENT PLAN \n \nCountry  Republic of Armenia \nName of Borrower  Republic of Armenia \nProject Name  Armenia:  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector \nProject \n   \nLoan Amount  $36 million \nExecuting Agency  State Committee of Water Systems \nDate of first Procurement Plan  Loan Approval Scheduled for October 2007 \nDate of this Procurement Plan  June 2007 \n \nA.

Introduction \n1.  This  summary  initial  environmental  examination  (SIEE)  analyzes  the  potential \nenvironmental  impacts  associated  with  the  Project\u2019s  water  and  wastewater  infrastructure \nimprovements, based on the initial environmental examination (IEE) reports prepared for the \ntwo  candidate  subprojects  during  the  processing  of  the  Project.  The  Project  is  classified \ncategory B under the guidelines of the Asian Development Bank (ABD). According to ADB \npolicy  for  category  B  projects,  an  IEE  is  required  as  the  first  stage  in  developing  an \nenvironmental assessment. The Law on Environmental Impact Expertise requires upgrading of \ninfrastructure projects such as this to be subjected to environmental assessment. \n2.  The  Project  has  taken  a  sector  approach  and  IEEs  have  been  prepared  for  two \ncandidate  subprojects\u2014one  core  town  subproject  located  in  Abovyan  and  five  subproject \nvillages  located  in  the  Ararat  Marz  (province)  for  the communities  of  Surenavan,  Armash, \nEraskh, Lanjar, and Paruyr Sevak. No significant adverse environmental impacts were noted in \nany of the subprojects analyzed. Minor environmental impacts identified can be readily mitigated \nusing proven technology and construction contract and management measures. The IEEs for \nthese subprojects were reviewed by ADB. Implementation of these subprojects will be subject to \nthe  approval  of  these  IEEs  by  the  Ministry  of  Nature  Protection  (MNP).  Based  on  the \nenvironmental assessment and review procedures (Supplementary Appendix H), which have \nbeen  prepared  in  accordance  with  applicable  government  and  ADB  environmental \nrequirements, IEEs will be conducted for the remaining subprojects as part of feasibility studies \nand submitted to the Ministry of Nature Protection for approval before implementation. The IEEs \nfor the first subproject and all subprojects above $2 million will require ADB approval. \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n3.  The  principle  outcome  of  the  Project  is  improved  access  to  safe,  reliable,  and \nsustainable water supply and sanitation (WSS) services. Project components comprise two \nparts: (i) rehabilitation and extension of distribution systems, and (ii) improvement of sewerage \nsystems. The first part will address rehabilitation and replacement of the deteriorated existing \nwater supply infrastructure. The second part will address improvement of the sewerage system \nby cleaning existing sewers and carrying out urgent repairs/replacement of damaged sewers \nthat are polluting water supplies in selected towns and villages. \n4.  Lack of water supply is a major problem in the two candidate subprojects, as analyzed \nin Abovyan and the rural communities in Ararat Valley. In Abovyan, 50-year old pipelines are in \ndire need of rehabilitation and inoperable pumps urgently need repair. Over 70% of the total \nwater supply is lost through leakage caused by old water supply infrastructure, and the water \nsupply is only available intermittently for 4\u20136 hours per day. Further, the rural communities of \nSurenavan, Armash, Eraskh, Lanjar, and Paruyr Sevak studied in the IEE analysis have not had \nconstant water supply in more than 15 years since the collapse of the Soviet Union.  \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n5.  Armenia is a landlocked country in Asia Minor between the Black and Caspian seas, \nbordered by Georgia on the north, Azerbaijan on the east, Iran on the south, and Turkey on the \nwest.  The  subproject  town  of  Abovyan  receives  an  average  of  550  millimeters  (mm)  of \nprecipitation  per  year  and  has  temperatures  ranging  from  \u201310\u02daC  to  25\u02daC.  The  subproject \nvillages located in Ararat Valley have a dry (average of 225 mm per year) and hot climate \n(average temperature of 40\u02daC). The mountainous communities located on the border of Armenia \nand Azerbaijan have colder temperatures ranging from \u201316\u02daC to 20\u02daC and average precipitation \nof 600 mm. \n ", "44  Appendix 12 \n \n \n6.  Springs and groundwater are the primary sources for the water supply systems in the \nproject area. The water supply for Abovyan comes from springs collected in an infiltration gallery \nand supplemented by deep well water. The communities are fed by springs. There is sufficient \nsupply  from  the  proposed  sources  but  the  intermittent  supply  of  electricity,  and  continued \nleaking pipes, cause intermittent water supply to consumers.   \n \n7.  With the proposed water supply sources, no foreseen water quality issues need to be \nmitigated because the water quality is good or proposed treatment measures are to be taken \nunder the Project. On-site wastewater treatment facilities, if in place, lack maintenance and \nbasic hygiene requirements. In Abovyan, the sewer lines and sewerage collectors are in need of \nrehabilitation. Within the communities, there is basic sewage system infrastructure including a \ncommon septic tank, pipes to discharge wastewater into storm water drains for dilution or open-\npit latrines.  \n \n8.  The  Project  includes  poor  communities.  In  the  candidate  subproject  communities,      \n75\u201390% of families receive subsidies from the Government. Approximately 80\u201390% of the \nmembers of the community farm a small number of livestock or produce crops. The towns and \ncommunities have basic schools and limited medical facilities. Overall, populations are stable or \ndecreasing. \n \n9.  IEE fieldwork and interviews did not reveal concern with vegetation at the subproject \nsites, as it is of low value and can be regrown easily. There are no cultural archeological or \nheritage sites found within the project areas, except cemeteries. All designs for subprojects \nalready analyzed have diverted pipelines around cemeteries. \n \nD.  Screening of Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n10.  Identified  negative  impacts  during  construction  are  moderate  in  extent  and  can  be \nmitigated. All potential environmental impacts and respective mitigation measures are listed in \nTable A12.4.

Institutional Arrangements and Monitoring Program \n11.  The government institution responsible for the implementation of the proposed Project is \nthe project management unit (PMU) in the Armenian Water and Sewage Company (AWSC), \nwhich  will  perform  the  bulk  of  work  and  prepare  all  environmental  documents  with  the \nassistance  of  an  environmental  specialist.  The  organizations  that  will  perform  overall \ncoordination and review relevant project documents include the State Committee of Water \n ", "Appendix 12  45 \n \n   \nSystems (SCWS). It will establish the project coordination unit (PCU) and set up an interagency \nproject governing council (PGC) headed by the chair of SCWS, with board members including \nministry representatives and provincial/local board members. ADB will also perform reviews of \nmajor  documents.  Provincial  and  town  or  community  governments  will  be  involved  in  the \nprocess of monitoring at the local level. The Project will not include any category A subprojects, \nbased on the established screening criteria. A summary of the environmental assessment and \nreview procedures, and respective responsibilities, are summarized in Table A12.2.  \n \nTable A12.2: Institutional Arrangements and Responsibilities  \n \nOrganization  Responsibilities  \nPMU  AWSC  \u2022  Establishing environmental classifications and determining need for subproject IEEs \n\u2022  Screening and preparation of subproject IEEs and submission of subproject IEEs to MNP  \n\u2022  Preparation of subproject monitoring and management plans for MNP review \n\u2022  Ensuring contract document includes environmental clearance certificate and conditions \n\u2022  Implementing environmental mitigation and monitoring measures  \n\u2022    Performing water quality monitoring and reporting to MNP and local governments \n\u2022  Performing civil works surveys \n\u2022  Informing affected people and community focus groups before or during consultation in the \nearly stage of IEE preparation, and conducting continuing consultation during \nimplementation in accordance with ADB and government requirements  \n\u2022  Undertaking remedial action when unexpected environmental impacts occur during \nimplementation \n\u2022  Submitting quarterly reports to MNP and ADB \nPMU\u2019s  National  \u2022  Assisting the PMU in classifying the Project and preparing IEEs and EMMPs \nEnviron- Environ- \u2022  Ensuring environmental clearance conditions for MNP approval \nmental  mental  \u2022  Incorporating environmental requirements in civil work contracts \nGroup  Specialist   \u2022  Updating and implementing environmental mitigation measures, as required \n\u2022  Providing environmental training, and conducting information disclosure and consultations \nPCU  SCWS  \u2022  Overall coordination with government entities and supervision responsibilities \n\u2022  Submitting IEEs for MNP approval \nInteragency  SCWS  \u2022  Reviewing environmental clearance of physical investments \nGoverning  and Reps  \u2022  Providing guidance for upholding environmental policy requirements \nCouncil   \nLocal Govts    \u2022  Coordinating with PMU and making key decisions on behalf of the community \nADB = Asian Development Bank, AWSC = Armenian Water and Sewerage Company, EMMP = environmental \nmanagement and monitoring plan, IEE = initial environmental examination, MNP = Ministry of Nature Protection,  \nPCU = project coordination unit, PMU= project management unit.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n12.  Environmental Monitoring. Water quality sampling will be conducted four times a year \n(each season) at the time of discharge, commencing at least 12 months before construction to \nestablish a baseline. The PMU, assisted by the environment specialist, will be responsible for \nconducting periodic monitoring. During the operation, daily, monthly, or seasonal water quality \nmonitoring shall take place depending on the location (i.e., at the source versus locations \nthroughout the network distribution system). All water samples must adhere to Ministry of Health \nwater quality guidelines.  \n13.  Environmental Capacity. AWSC acting as the PMU has significant experience with \nwater quality sampling and implementing environmental mitigation measures. An environmental \nspecialist is working full-time for AWSC for its existing water supply projects. A lawyer also \nworks with AWSC to handle involuntary resettlement issues. In conjunction with this available \nexpertise, the project plan includes hiring an environmental specialist to perform the technical \nand management tasks indicated in Table A12.2.  \n14.

Public Consultation and Information Disclosure \n \n15.  According to the fundamentals of the Legislation on Nature Protection, every citizen has \na  right  to  request  complete  information  concerning  the  environmental  situation  with  new \nconstruction projects. ADB also requires public consultation in the environmental assessment \nprocess.  For  category  B  projects,  the  borrower  must  consult  with  groups  affected  by  the \nproposed project and with local nongovernment organizations. The consultation needs to be \ncarried out as early as possible in the project cycle so that views of affected groups are taken \ninto account in the design of the Project and its environmental mitigation measures.  \n \n16.  For  the  two  subprojects  analyzed  to  date,  ADB  conducted  six  public  consultations \nincluding  the  subproject  town  and  each  subproject  community  during  April  2007.  The \nconsultations were open community meetings at the town halls, where attendees included \nwomen.  Information  on  subproject  design  plans  was  disseminated  via  posters  and  oral \ncommunications. Overall, the populations wanted to participate in the design, monitoring, and \nconstruction of the subprojects. Their greatest environmental concerns included the degradation \nof land, and drinking and irrigation water as well as limited potable water service. Continuous \npublic consultation with the project-affected communities will be carried out during the detailed \ndesign and implementation period to address their concerns through sustainable designs and by \nkeeping the communities involved at all project stages. \n \nG.  Conclusions \n \n17.  The proposed Project is unlikely to cause any adverse environmental impacts because \n(i) potential negative impacts associated with the design, construction, and operation of the \nproposed subproject activities are likely to be temporary and localized in extent, and can be \nmitigated to acceptable levels using proven technology and management measures; and (ii) an \nenvironmental  management  and  monitoring  plan  was  prepared  to  ensure  environmentally \nsustainable implementation of the subprojects. Based on the findings of the two subproject \nIEEs,  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures,  and  the  subproject  selection \ncriteria for the Project, it is likely that subsequent subproject environmental assessment will not \nwarrant a detailed Environmental Impact Assessment. \n ", "   \nTable 12.4: Summary of Environmental Impacts, Mitigation Measures, and Responsible Institutions \n \nProject Activity and  Proposed Mitigation Measures  Responsible \nPotential Impacts  Institutions \nDesign and Location     \nSource Abstraction  \u2022  Perform detailed design to show necessary abstraction limit for communities during dry season   PMU \n\u2022  Providing sufficient supply   \u2022  Undertake confirmatory flow measurements on spring source in two annual dry seasons \nSource Protection  \u2022  Provide a protection buffer zone of at least 100 m upstream of the intake and its immediate catchment, area and  PMU \n\u2022  Protecting raw water  restrict access.

No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Republic of Armenia: \n \nThe Project will benefit a total population of about 576,000 people, of which 49% lives in regional cities and 51% in \nrural communities, through the provision of clean water and improvement of hygiene and sanitation. The Project will \nsupport poverty reduction by (i) decreasing the incidence of waterborne diseases, costs of medical care, and sick days \ntaken, thus reducing household health expenditures; (ii) diminishing the workload for women in the house, thus \nproviding the opportunity for them to become more involved in social and economic activities; (iii) providing safer and \nmore reliable water supplies; (iv) improving the quality of life of the urban and rural population, particularly the poor, by \nincreasing  their  access  to  safe  drinking  water,  thereby  improving  hygiene  and  sanitation;  and  (v)  providing \nemployment opportunities to the poor. \n \nThe  Project  will  improve  public  health  by  reducing  waterborne  diseases  through  improved  water  supply  and \nwastewater management services. The poor (who are likely to suffer most from incidence of waterborne diseases) and \nwomen (who are often in charge of collecting and storing drinking water, as well as taking care of ill household \nmembers) will benefit most from the improvement in increased access and improved water quality as a result of the \nProject. Health indicators related to waterborne diseases will be monitored annually as part of the project preparatory \nmonitoring system. The Project will also create job opportunities for both skilled and unskilled labor during the project \nimplementation stage. The person-days to be utilized by the Project and possibilities of involving the local workforce \nwill be specified during the detailed design stage.  \n \nThe priority of improving water access and quality, especially in rural areas, is reflected in nationalized Millennium \nDevelopment Goal (MDG) indicators and the poverty reduction and strategy paper monitoring framework. The Project \nwill reduce non-income poverty by improving living conditions and public health, and improving the water supply of \n40% of regional urban communities and 26.4% of rural communities in the country. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                         Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention (MDG 7 Target 10) \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nPoverty and social analysis has been an integral part of the project preparation, and has been based on primary and \nsecondary data obtained through quantitative and qualitative methodologies. The poverty analysis hinged on data \nanalysis at the country and region level, as well as project area, and involved household surveys, stakeholder \nconsultations through focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and field assessment.  \n \nAs of January 2006, the total population of Armenia was 3,219,200 people (64.1% urban and 35.9% rural). About \n23.3%  of  the  population  resides  in  the  project  area,  including  386,043  people  from  rural  communities  and \n364,535 from  urban  (regional  cities)  communities.  The  natural  population  growth  rate  in  2005  was  3.5  (per \n1,000 people). The growth rate of the rural population (3.9) exceeds urban population growth (3.2). However, because \nof industrial growth, the internal migration from urban to rural settlements that occurred in the past reversed bringing \nmore young labor force to urban settlements. The share of the rural population remained stable compared to urban \nareas because of a higher birth rate.  \n \nBy the end of 2005, 29.8% of Armenia\u2019s population (about 960,000 people) was classified poor (income below \nAMD20,289 per month) and 4.6% (150,000 people) very poor (income below AMD13,266 per month). In 2005, per \ncapita gross domestic product was estimated at AMD697,400. The poorest section of the population is concentrated in \nregional towns and regions with a predominantly rural population, where economic opportunities are limited and where \nclimatic and geographic conditions are most unfavorable for agricultural activities. Recent poverty data indicates that \nthe gains from high economic growth rates have not been equally distributed among the population or across different \nregions of the country. Growth has mostly benefited the capital, Yerevan, while poverty reduction for people living in \nrural areas and regional cities has been comparatively low. The Government has declared rural poverty reduction, and \nin broader terms regional development, a priority.  \n \nCurrently, there are marked differences between the quality of and access to water supply in urban and rural \nsettlements. In 2005, 97.5% of urban and 72.8% of rural households had access to a centralized water supply system. \nHowever, access to a centralized water supply system is not a guarantee of 24-hour water supply. While the vast \n ", "    Appendix 13          49   \nmajority of urban households (about 87%) have indoor water taps, only 51% of rural households have access to home \ntaps. In 2005, 38.9% of households had water 1\u20135 hours a day and only 28.3% of households with a centralized water \nsupply system reported having water 24 hours a day. The operating connection for the rest of the rural households \nconsists of boreholes and public standpipes.  \nLack or absence of access to clean drinking water leads to a number of problems, including: (i) negative impact on \nhealth\u2014lack of clean drinking water causes major hygiene and sanitation problems and increases risk of waterborne \ndisease; (ii) opportunity cost (in money or time)\u2014limited availability or absence of individual water taps imposes \nsignificant time and money costs on people, as they are forced to collect water from a suitable source or pay to \npurchase drinking water delivered by road tanks. Moreover, people spend 2\u20133 hours per daya collecting and storing \ndrinking water. The burden of these time costs often falls disproportionately on females, so a solution to these \nproblems will have gender, as well as social, benefits for the communities; and (iii) negative psychological and \neconomic development impact\u2014absence or lack of clean water causes low morale and has a negative impact on local \nresidents\u2019 work productivity, since they cannot perform basic person hygiene practices. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nStakeholder analysis has been conducted during project preparation through public participation and consultation with \nkey stakeholders. The purpose of the stakeholder analysis was to identify their needs, interest, capacity, and level of \ninfluence  in  the  project  design,  implementation,  and  monitoring.  Stakeholder  consultations  and  focus  group \ndiscussions were conducted with 120 people in the subproject town and each subproject community during April\u2013May \n2007. Issues discussed included qualitative aspects of poverty in subproject communities; gender issues; benefits of \nimproved water services (especially to the poor and women); and willingness of involvement in design, monitoring, \nand evaluation activities for the Project. During these consultation exercises, community members also voiced their \nkey environmental concerns and ideas on improving sanitation. \n \nBased on the public consultations, focus group discussion, and rapid participatory appraisal, a participation strategy \nhas been developed to (i) promote active participation of the beneficiary and affected population in project planning, \nimplementation,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation;  (ii)  promote  active  participation  of  the  stakeholders  in  the \nimplementation of the capacity building program on the effective management of water resources and water systems \nin the project communities; (iii) enhance project benefits to the beneficiary populations; (iv) obtain their support for the \nProject; and (v) raise their social acceptance of the user fees. \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe poverty and social analysis indicates that women will benefit most from the Project, since most household chores \nare water-related and are mainly performed by women. Benefits resulting from access to clean and stable water \nsupply and improved water quality, increased health status, and time saving from performing water-related household \nactivities, will all benefit women to a certain degree. The Project will encourage women to participate in the project \ndesign and implementation through active involvement of women in monitoring and evaluation of the project impact on \nhealth, sanitation, and general living conditions. The public awareness program will target women\u2019s engagement as \npromoters on public health, hygiene improvement, and project benefits.  \n \nHas an output been prepared?

Introduction \n1.  The economic analysis covers the whole sector Project as well as the representative \nsubprojects. It assesses the rationale for government intervention in the sector, its capacity to \nexecute the sector investment plan, the plan\u2019s goals, design of the plan, and the implementation \nstrategy. \n \nB.  Rationale for Government Intervention \n2.  The rationale for government intervention results from increasing concern over the poor \ncondition of water supply services in both urban and rural communities\u2014despite the transfer of \nsystems management and operations to private water providers, especially in urban centers. \nCurrently,  there  are  five  independent  operators  with  different  types  of  ownership  and \nmanagement. Yerevan Water and Sewerage Company is a private company that operates \nunder a lease contract, and covers the capital and adjacent 33 rural communities. Armenian \nWater and Sewerage Company (AWSC) is a state company that operates under a management \ncontract with a private operator, and covers 37 towns and 300 communities. The municipal \nenterprises, Lori Water and Sewerage, Shirak Water and Sewerage, and Nor Akunq Water and \nSewerage are jointly owned by the Government and respective municipalities on a 49\u201351% \nsharing  basis  and  operate  systems  in  communities  in  their  respective  regions.  Current \noperations  are  continually  plagued  by  high  water  wastage  because  of  deficiencies  in  the \nmetering program, and poor cash position caused by a low collection ratio and low water tariffs \nthat result in low cost recovery\u2014leading to high reliance on government subventions, either \nthrough tax discounts or energy cost subsidy, and measures like partial debt relief. \n \n3.  The problems are even more pronounced in rural communities at marz (province) and \nregional levels. By detail, water supply services in these areas are under the responsibility of \nlocal government or community administration. However, studies show that (i) where such \ncentralized systems exist, services continue to deteriorate because little can be done to improve \nand rehabilitate the systems because of lack of funds; and (ii) other sectors vie for whatever is \navailable. As most of these supply systems are in various stages of deterioration and some are \ndysfunctional, residents are forced to use alternative, unsafe sources of water. Operated by the \nlocal government or the communities out of their own budget appropriations, only 2% of the \nwater supply infrastructure is in good order, and 63% is of a poor standard and continues to \nprovide unreliable water supply. Although 50% of households have access to direct water taps, \nthe rest rely on boreholes, public standpipes, and delivered water. The limited number of \nindividual  water  taps,  or  their  unavailability,  imposes  substantial  time  and  money  costs  to \nresidents who on average, spend between one overhaul. Such systems depend on subsidies to \ncover financial needs for large-scale system repair or extension works. Consequently, under the \npresent institutional context, many local government and community-based water systems are \nneither institutionally nor financially independent water operators. Water supply is rationed to a \nfew hours a day and schedules are often not met. \n \n4.  Government involvement in the investment plan is justified because there is significant \nscope to improve water supply in both urban and rural communities through the provision of \nfinancial  and  technical  support  and  institutional  capacity  development  which  only  the \nGovernment can provide effectively at present. Institutional and economic reforms embedded in \nthe decentralization efforts have yet to see results. Although the Government transferred the \nresponsibility of managing and operating water supply services through recent policies, there is \nstill a need for central level management to develop and address the medium- and long-term \nneeds  of  the  water  supply  sector  sufficiently.  The  manifold  problems  characterizing  the \n ", "52  Appendix 14 \nenterprises  to  supply  service  to  urban  and  rural  communities  still  require  government \nintervention. The Government has taken initial steps to strengthen enterprise service provision \ncapability  through  its  various  legal  issuances.  However,  these  entities  now  require  further \neconomic support and regulation to see through the intentions of such transfer. It is also \nincumbent upon the Government to attract further external financial resources to free some of \nits own resources to support related prioritized programs on health improvement, environmental \nprotection, community empowerment, and sustainable economic development in the affected \nareas. \n \nC.  Goals of the Project \n5.  The goals of the Project are consistent with government economic policy, which ensures \nsustainable growth by improving the public health and environment in project towns and villages  \nthrough focused social infrastructure development and closing the disparity between urban and \nrural communities. Major investment programs have been undertaken and are currently ongoing \nin the public utilities sector wherein the Government has recognized the inadequacy of water \nsupply systems as well as in the institutional settings in which they operate. Until 2000, the \nGovernment applied the state budget to finance sector investments in the capital and most \nurban towns and cities, while directing the local administration budget toward funding those for \nrural communities. Since then, it adopted the strategy aimed to carry out reforms in the water \nsphere, which included measures on institutional, legal, economic, and organizational changes \nin future water resources management and water economy. This led to the adoption of the \ndecree \u201cOn Concept of Reforms of Water Resources and Economy\u201d, 2001, which opened the \ndoors for sourcing of internal and external investments to support the plan economically through \nissuance of implementation guidelines. The Water Code, 2002, has brought into legislation the \nfundamental provisions for the proposed National Water Policy. The law, when passed, will \nensure regular updates of water resource assessment, water reserve availability, and projected \ndemand. \n \n6.  The goals set out in the development of the proposed Project are directly relevant to the \ninvestment plan and concur with the plan\u2019s goals. By 2012, the Project aims to provide improved \nwater supply service to about 576,000 inhabitants in 16 urban towns and 125 rural communities. \nOf the rural sites, about 60 are situated in remote and border areas and identified by the State \nCommittee of Water Systems (SCWS) as among those areas in the country with the lowest \naccess to water supplies. Most of the rural communities targeted in the Project have never \nexperienced  piped  water  supply  service.  Scarcity  of  water  resources  in  many  of  these \nsettlements has been given high emphasis in project planning.  \n \n7.  The Project will contribute to the promotion of water conservation and prevention of \nwastage through the installation of water meters and appropriate tariff setting. Tariffs will be \nstructured so that they are cost-based and acceptable to the consuming public, especially the \npoor who make up the majority even in urban-type settlements. Tariffs will likewise be set to \ncover all operation and maintenance costs and depreciation for rural areas, and debt repayment \nfor  urban  areas.  Consistent  with  decentralization  policies,  selected  subprojects  in  rural \ncommunities will strengthen community ownership of the water supply system, helping improve \nsustainability. Through public outreach programs incorporated in the Project, communities will \nbe educated in proper water and hygiene practices, and their responsibilities as beneficiaries. \n \n ", "Appendix 14  53 \n   \nD.  Subproject Selection Criteria and Design \n8.  Subprojects  will  be  prioritized,  since  the  size  and  scope  of  the  Project  prevent  all \ninvestments from being undertaken simultaneously. The Government demonstrates, through \nSCWS, its willingness and capability to conduct the selection process by identifying towns, \nvillages, and communities that need immediate development of their water supply systems. \nSCWS has established, and agreed with the Ministry of Finance and Economy and Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), an initial priority list of 18 towns and 303 villages. The list includes 46 \nvillages that (i) are not currently included in the management zone of the AWSC, (ii) receive \nbulk supply of water from AWSC, and (iii) will be the first priority for project investments in the \nzone not covered by AWSC. \n9.  Foremost, the selection will (i) directly address the basic needs of the population in \nterms of drinking water supply; (ii) reflect the water supply strategies set by the Government, \nincluding health and sanitation and environmental concerns; (iii) not be in conflict with those \nunder other projects; (iv) be justified by a feasibility study that covers technical, institutional, \neconomic, financial, environmental, and social aspects; (v) adopt the least-cost solution among \navailable alternatives; (vi) be based on the detailed analysis of demand and communities\u2019 \nwillingness to pay for improved services; and (vii) be and remain sustainable, given proper \nmaintenance. For subprojects covered by AWSC or any of the other water companies, the \neconomic criteria include a financial internal rate of return (FIRR) higher than the opportunity \ncost of capital, as well as an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of at least 12% to be \ndetermined through detailed feasibility study. For selections not covered by any of the water \ncompanies, the financial viability requirement through the FIRR is waived, but the minimum \nEIRR must be satisfied. \n10.  A structured approach will be adopted for the appraisal and approval of subprojects \nincluded  in  the  Project.  Subprojects  for  rural  communities  will  be  selected  based  on \nnonavailability of safe and affordable alternative water supply, deficient service where systems \nexist, potential for multiple villages served by a single source, high incidence of waterborne and \nrelated diseases, and willingness of inhabitants to participate in the Project. Subprojects for \nurban towns will be selected based on proximity to the existing water distribution network, \ndeficient water supply service characterized by insufficient quantity (less than a 24-hour service) \nand poor quality, high cost of alternative supplies, and willingness of inhabitants to participate in \nthe Project and pay for the service. \n11.  The Project\u2019s selection criteria emphasize inhabitants\u2019 willingness not only to participate \nin the Project but in planning and design activities where their participation is invaluable. The \ncriteria also require communities to (i) request inclusion in the Project formally through their \nlocal administration or village or block representatives, (ii) assist in pre-feasibility data collection, \n(iii) provide support in tariff setting, and (iv) form the village administrations that would manage \nand maintain the installations and payment collection for rural communities.  \n12.  Each water supply system will be designed at least cost, and from several available \nalternatives  concurred  by  the  beneficiaries,  in  terms  of  location,  planning  horizon,  and \ncomponent design. Tariffs for each subproject will be based on user willingness to pay and \naffordability. To ensure greater sustainability, the equity principle in designing tariffs will be \napplied.  Tariffs  will  be  volume-based,  so  metering  is  required.  For  areas  where  only \nrehabilitation is to be carried out, people are already connected. However, meter charges will be \nrecovered in easy installments with the monthly water charges. In the poorest communities, the \nGovernment  agrees  to  subsidize  connection  and  meter  charges.  Market  surveys  will  be \nconducted during the feasibility stage to gather sufficient information in support of detailed \ndemand analysis based on consumer willingness to connect. User willingness to connect will \n ", "54  Appendix 14 \nhave strong bearing in the selection of subprojects. The demand analysis will provide sufficient \ninformation to determine incremental and non-incremental usage, as well as an estimate of \ntechnical and nontechnical losses. \n13.  The availability of local contractors, timely release of counterpart funds, and capacity of \nproject management support and design consultants will all be considered. Technical planning \nand design will be in accordance with overall sector strategies and will not be in conflict with \nthose applied in other sector development programs. \n \nE.  Subproject Economic Analysis \n14.  At least two alternatives were assessed for each subproject based on the pre-feasibility \nstudy options in terms of demand, source type and availability, and technical design. The \noptimum  alternative  per  subproject  has  been  selected  for  economic  evaluation.  Standard \nbenefit-cost analysis following ADB guidelines has been undertaken to measure the economic \nviability of both subprojects as representative of all the other subprojects for inclusion under the \nProject. \n15.  The major economic benefits assumed for the Project include cost savings on non-\nincremental  supply  to  connected  and  unconnected  user  households.  The  non-incremental \nbenefits  are  quantified using  the  resource cost  savings approach  for  time  spent  on  water \ncollection.  Focus  group  discussions  were  conducted  in  Abovyan  and  Ararat  sample \ncommunities, which aided in eliciting information on the estimated time spent by household \nmembers collecting water from available sources, based on distance traveled and the average \nnumber  of  times  the  activity  is  performed  each  day.  Data  on  average  family  income  and \nminimum wages in the locality have been used to value the cost of the activity. The economic \ncosts, consisting of capital investment and operating costs, have been converted from financial \ncosts using shadow pricing. The conversion factors applied are based on infrastructure projects \nof similar scope in the Central Asian region. To calculate the EIRR, only resource cost savings \nwere used. \n16.  Based on the focus group discussions in the two subprojects, over 50% of households \nindicated that 1\u20134 hours are spent each day fetching water from available wells, springs, or the \nclosest open irrigation canals because of the water shortage. In the Abovyan subproject, rural \nhouseholds and those not connected to any piped system spend an average of 1 hour to collect \nwater daily. In the five rural communities under the Ararat subproject, households have no \naccess to piped water. Most of the households spend an average of 2.5\u20133.0 hours each day \ncollecting  water.  The  incremental  benefits  of  increased  volume  sales  are  based  on  the \ndifference between the current level of water usage\u2014at less than 9 cubic meters (m3) per \nhousehold  per  month  in  Ararat  communities  and  22  m3  in  Abovyan\u2014and  the  estimated \nincreased consumption as a result of the investments. Detailed demand and willingness to pay \nanalysis was conducted, which indicated high willingness to pay for improved services. Several \ncommunities in the project area are currently paying much higher tariffs for water supply through \npurchase of better quality of water from venders. Selection of future subprojects will be mainly \nbased on this analysis to ensure that subprojects are demand-based and will be sustainable \nthrough users\u2019 commitment to pay for the improved services.   \n17.  The  benefit-cost  ratio  (BCR)  and  EIRR  have  been  derived  for  the  representative \nsubprojects. Generally, with average economic cost lower than average economic price of \nwater, the proposed Project is economically feasible, as this will also result in a BCR greater \nthan 1.0. For the Abovyan subproject and the five communities in Ararat subproject, the BCR is \nestimated to be over 1.0, averaging 1.26. For the Project as a whole, the BCR is estimated at \n1.26. The BCR results are summarized in Table A14.1. \n ", "Appendix 14  55 \n   \nTable A14.1: Benefit-Cost Ratio Analysis \n \nParticulars Abovyan Ararat Abov + Ararat All Project\nAverage economic tariff, AMD/m3              7 5                3 00    \nAverage economic cost, AMD/m3              6 0                2 36    \nBenefits, AMD million         2 ,234                5 66               2 ,800           42,976\n  Collection-time savings         2 ,234                5 66               2 ,800  \nCosts, AMD million         1 ,778                4 46               2 ,224           34,132\nCapital investment            5 70                4 12                  9 82  \nOperation & maintenance         1 ,208                  3 3               1 ,242  \nBenefit-Cost Ratio           1 .26               1 .27                 1 .26              1 .26  \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n18.  The results of the economic analysis show the EIRR at 25% for the Abovyan subproject \nfor  the  base  case  scenario,  and  17.3%  for  the  Ararat  subproject.

Sector Benefits \n19.  The Project will have both direct and indirect benefits. The previous section shows that \nthe sector project is economically justified with total expected benefits at AMD42,976 million \noutweighing  total  costs  at  AMD34,132  million,  resulting  in  a  BCR  of  1.26.  The  combined \neconomic net present value of benefits for the two subprojects amounts to almost AMD580 \nmillion. This would translate to about AMD15,400 per capita for a typical subproject beneficiary. \nApplying this value to the total target project beneficiaries would result in net benefits amounting \nto AMD8,850 million for the Project as a whole. \n \n20.  The Project will also provide indirect economic benefits through training of involved staff \nin technical and financial management, institutional development, and community governance. \nOther benefits that cannot be quantified using currently limited data will accrue in general terms \nto  economic  development  of  the  project  areas  as  a  result  of  improved  water  supply  and \nsanitation. These include increased economic activities and output of commerce and industry, \nand improved operations of institutions such as schools and hospitals that require safe and \nsufficient  water  supply.  Economic  benefits  will  accrue  from,  among  others:  (i)  increased \nconsumer satisfaction; (ii) increased health benefits from disease prevention and a reduction in \nthe mortality rate; and (iii) increased fire protection, especially in crowded settlements and \ncommercial areas \n ", "56  Appendix 15 \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.   Introduction \n1.  The financial analysis was prepared in accordance with the Guidelines for the Financial \nGovernance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by the Asian Development \nBank1 and the Framework for the Economic and Financial Appraisal of Urban Development \nSector Projects.2 The analysis determines the level of cost recovery from users required to \ncover  all  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  expenses  and  eventually  capital  to  achieve \nfinancial sustainability. The analysis was done for two representative water supply subprojects: \nAbovyan subproject, located in Kotayk Marz, and the subproject for five rural communities in \nArarat marz (province). \nB.  Financial Projections \n2.  Projections are based on information in the final pre-feasibility study reports. Projections \nusing pro forma financial statements are in nominal terms and are prepared for the period \n2008\u20132025. Capital inputs are projected to commence in 2008 with expenditures for surveys, \ndetailed design, initial construction, community awareness activities, and institutional support. \nThe subproject is expected to be completed in 2009. Revenue and cost streams for internal rate \nof return (IRR) calculations are in real terms and include a residual value that incorporates \nreplacements. \n1.  System Operation and Maintenance \n3.  The areas covered under the Abovyan subproject form part of the North East District \noperations  of  the  Armenian  Water  and  Sewerage  Company  (AWSC).  Management  and \ndevelopment of the subproject will continue to be the responsibility of the district. The physical \nand institutional improvements proposed through the Project are seen to raise the existing level \nof service from one of physical disrepair that led to its very poor financial standing, to one that is \nsustainable and self-sufficient. \n4.  At this stage in project preparation, implementation arrangements for the five Ararat \ncommunities are still under discussion. The most appropriate alternative being considered for \nthe subproject is to delegate management and O&M of the local water supply and sanitation \n(WSS) network to village administrations. A specially trained WSS specialist will undertake \nminor system maintenance, set and collect tariffs, and issue directives on improvement of \nservice delivery. The Project includes training components to develop WSS management skills \nat community level. It is designed so that village administrations will collect payment for services \nrendered. Revenues will essentially be used for system O&M. Any extra cash will be set aside \nfor future replacements and possible service extension. However, not all communities accepted \nthrough the selection process will have the capability to pay for service. In this case, subsidies \nmay be channeled through the community administration to the vulnerable group of users. The \nlevel and timing of subsidization will have to be identified and agreed with the source during \nproject implementation. In the case of the five Ararat communities, subproject tariffs are set so \nthat the source of the subsidy, whether marz or community administration level, can recover its \ninputs when the subproject finally attains financial self-sufficiency. \n \n2.  Cost and Financing \n5.  The investment cost has two major components: (i) physical infrastructure, consisting of \ncivil  works,  materials  and  equipment,  and  other  development  costs  (including  detailed \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003. Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by the \nAsian Development Bank. Manila. \n2  ADB. 1994. Framework for the Economic and Financial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector Projects. Manila. \n ", "Appendix 15  57 \n \nengineering, construction supervision, and taxes and duties); and (ii) institutional strengthening, \nconsisting of skills improvement, public outreach program, and project management support. \nTaxes and duties, and allowances for physical and price contingencies, are also included. \nForeign inflationary allowance is assumed at 2.4% annually; for domestic inflation, 4% in 2008 \nand 3% thereafter. \n \n6.  O&M costs include expenses for personnel salaries, power and fuel, chemical treatment, \nand  plant  and  equipment  maintenance.  Depreciation  is  assumed  at  2%  for  civil  works \n(calculated on a 50-year economic life of components) and 6.7% for materials and equipment \n(calculated on a 15-year economic life). Capital outlays during post-construction are budgeted \nthrough provision of reserves for replacing fully depreciated assets. Asset replacements are to \nbe financed out of net operating income. Annual domestic inflation is assumed at 4% in 2008, \nand 3% from 2009 onward. \n \n7.  The investment will be financed through a mix of ADB loan, estimated at $36 million, or \n80% of the total capital investment, and government contribution at $9 million, or 20% of the \ntotal capital investment. The terms of the ADB loan to the Government follow ADB\u2019s Asian \nDevelopment Fund terms and include a 32-year loan period with a 8-year grace period, and \ninterest  of  1%  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  thereafter.  Any  further  lending  from  the \nGovernment through a subsidiary agreement will be on the same terms and conditions as \napplied in the principal agreement between ADB and the Government. The Abovyan subproject \nwill require a total investment of AMD844,604 million. The subproject for five rural communities \nin Ararat will cost AMD611,106 million. \n \n3.  Tariffs, Cost Recovery, and Viability Parameters \n \n8.  Subproject tariffs are calculated based on the following cost recovery principles: \n \n(i)  all O&M cost recovery from the start of operation; and \n(ii)  all O&M cost from start of operation and partial recovery of depreciation, during \nthe initial years, graduating into full cost recovery, and where applicable, interest \non loan, in the succeeding years as affordability levels permit. \n \n9.  Tariffs are likewise calculated so that they remain within the affordability of the low-\nincome household, set at about 5% of average household income, in both urban and rural \ncommunities. At the projected tariff levels, the subproject is deemed viable when the IRR is \nhigher than the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Any subsidy provided to cover direct \nO&M  cost,  depreciation,  and  loan  interest  may  be  recouped  from  the  service  provider  or \ncommunity user group running the subproject when excess cash is available after covering all \nother cash requirements. The priority of recouping subsidy will follow this order: (i) direct O&M \ncost, (ii) depreciation, and (iii) loan interest. \n \nC.  Financial Evaluation \n1.  Proposed Tariffs \n10.  In the areas of the Abovyan subproject, households are presently charged AMD140 per \ncubic meter (m3). Water service is 2\u20136 hours on a good day, with a chance of being rationed \nseveral days per week. In the five rural communities in the Ararat subproject, households buy \nwater from tankers or vendors. Average monthly water expenditure for these households could \neasily  reach  AMD2,000\u2013AMD3,000  or  $6\u2013$9.  In  Abovyan,  average  monthly  household \nconsumption  is  about  7  m3,  based  on  individual  metered  connections.  In  the  Ararat \ncommunities, household consumption of drinking water is 2\u20133 m3 per month. Water acquired \nfrom water tankers or vendors is usually for drinking purposes only. \n \n ", "58  Appendix 15 \n11.  Since the subproject schemes are designed for metered in-yard connections, the tariffs \nare volume-based and structured to prevent wastage. Presently, in the subproject areas, no \ndistinction is made on household tariffs as a function of their monthly income. Therefore, the \nsame tariffs apply for the different categories of users. However, in the near future, when \noperations will have attained some financial stability, a distinction will have to be made to \naccount  for  consumption  levels  and  by  consumer  category.  The  structure  should  aim  to \ndifferentiate tariffs so that the poor within the community who have lower disposable income will \nat least be able to cover their basic water needs. Higher-income households that generally \nrequire more, and consequently incur higher marginal costs, should be made to pay more.  \n \n12.  The proposed average tariff for the Abovyan subproject will remain at AMD140 per m3 \nfor the initial 2 years of operation. This is the rate approved by the Public Services Regulatory \nCommission  charged  in  the  district  and  other  urban-type  communities.  However,  to  attain \nfinancial viability throughout the study period, a 10% increase by 2012 and a 10% increase \nevery 5 years starting by 2017 are needed. At these tariffs, partial subsidization is required, \namounting to AMD210 million by 2012 to cover direct O&M cost fully; and AMD316 million by \n2014  to  cover  O&M,  depreciation,  and  loan  interest  fully.

WACC, Financial Internal Rate of Return, and Sensitivity Analyses \n \n14.  The WACC is calculated in real terms and used as hurdle rate to the financial internal \nrate of return (FIRR) as a basis for measuring subproject viability. Funding sources are the \nproposed ADB loan at 80% and capital contributions from the Government and/or co-financiers \nat 20%. Long-term inflation is estimated at an average of 2.4% for foreign cost and an average \nof 4.0% for local costs. The rates are computed on an after-tax basis, resulting in the WACC in \nreal terms estimated at 1.58% (Table A15.3). \n \n \nTable A15.3: Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n \nCapital \nInvestment  Investment  Capital Cost \nParticulars  Cost After \n(AMD '000)  Weight  (%)  Taxa\nADB Loan      1.38  1.10 \nGrace period      0.25   \nRegular period      1.13   \nWACC, nominal after tax        1.10 \nLess: Foreign inflation rate        2.40 \nWACC, real        0.00 \nEquity         \nCurrent interest rate on long-term treasury bonds      10.00  10.00 \nPlus: risk premium      2.00     2.00 \nWACC, nominal      12.00   12.00 \nLess: Domestic inflation rate           4.00 \nWACC, real           8.00 \n         \nADB Loan  677,648  80%  0.00    0.00 \nEquity  166,956  20%  8.00     1.58 \nWACC           1.58 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, WACC = weighted average cost of capital. \na  Applied at 20%. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n15.  Based on the tariff schedules given in Tables A15.1 and A15.2, the two representative \ncore subprojects can attain financially viability, but will require operational subsidies during the \ninitial years of operation. The Abovyan subproject has an IRR of 7.8% against the WACC at \n1.58%. The subproject for five rural communities in Ararat will give an IRR of 3.1% at the same \nWACC level.  \n16.  Sensitivity tests were undertaken to determine the effects of (i) a 20% increase in \ninvestment cost, (ii) a 20% increase in O&M cost, (iii) a 20% decrease in revenue, and (iv) a     \n1-year  delay  in  project  implementation.  In  all  sensitivity  scenarios,  the  FIRR  for  both  the \nAbovyan and Ararat subprojects exceeds the WACC. The subprojects will cover the full O&M \ncosts from the first year of operation and generate annual surplus sufficient to meet part of the \ndepreciation cost, after which full cost recovery (including loan interest cover) is achievable by \n2015. Both subprojects remain robust under all adverse circumstances.

Affordability Analysis \n17.  From initial field investigations conducted during pre-feasibility study preparation, there \nhas been an apparent willingness among the urban and rural population in the subprojects to \navail of and pay for improved service . Affordability analysis is conducted to ensure that the \nproposed water tariffs do not exceed the prescribed limit of 5% of the monthly household \nincome of potential beneficiaries. To measure affordability, the average monthly water bill is set \nagainst average household income. Based on the planned tariff increases, water bills will be on \naverage below 5% of income of average income households in Abovyan and Ararat. The \naffordability analysis is given in Table A15.5. \n \nTable A15.5: Affordability Analysis \n \n  Average  Average  Average HH  Average  Average  Average HH  Average Bill \nSubproject  HH  Consumption  Consumption  Tariff/m3 Bill  Income  to Income \n  Size  (lpcd)  (m3/month)  (AMD)  (AMD/month)  (AMD/month)  (%) \nAbovyan  4  120  14  173  2,461  61,994  4.0 \n               \nArarat Five \nCommunities  4  120  14  158  2,248  47,077  4.8 \nHH = household, lpcd = liter per capita per day, m3 = cubic meter. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n4.  Conclusion \n18.  The proposed subprojects for Abovyan and the five rural communities in Ararat are \nfound to be financially viable. To ensure sustainability, the proposed tariff schedules will have to \nbe followed. Likewise, subsidy requirements during the initial years of operation will have to be \nagreed with the possible source/s. The timely infusion of subsidies is essential to operations, \nand will complement subproject efforts to generate sufficient revenue by proper imposition of the \nrequired tariffs and their regular collection. Failure to implement these fundamental measures \nwould likely only lead again to the state of physical disrepair and very poor financial condition, \nwhich are familiar characteristics of the water supply sector at present. \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20071102113257+08'00'", "Author": "MZA", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 7.0.5 for Word", "Keywords": "rrp:armenia 40296, water resources management, armenian water sector,sanitation sector project,sustainable water supply, municipal infrastructure rehabilitation ", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0.5 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20071102144754+08'00'", "Company": "Licenced User", "SourceModified": "D:20071102014549", "Title": "Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project"}}
