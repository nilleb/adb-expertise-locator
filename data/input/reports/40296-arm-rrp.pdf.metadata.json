An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  for  two \ncore  subprojects  was  undertaken.  A  summary  IEE  and  an \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  procedure  were  also \nprepared.    \n\nThe  Project  follows  a  sector  lending  approach  and  supports  the \nGovernment\u2019s  objective  of  human  development  by  providing \nimproved  access  to  sustainable  water  supply  and  sanitation \n(WSS)  services.  The  Project  consists  of \ntwo  components: \n(i) component  A:  municipal \nrehabilitation  and \ninfrastructure \nimprovement,  and  (ii)  component  B:  management  improvement \nand  capacity  development.  Component  A  consists  of  about \n18 subprojects,  each  covering  a  cluster  of  small  towns  and \nvillages.  Component  B  focuses  on  improving  the  operating \nefficiency  of  WSS  service  providers.  The  Project  will  cover \n16 towns  and  125  villages  in  seven  provinces;  and  provide  WSS \nservices to about 576,000 people, about 25% of whom are living \nbelow the poverty line. \n\nFollowing  the  dissolution  of  the  Soviet  Union,  the  efficiency  of \nwater  management  in  Armenia  declined  because  of  economic \ncollapse, inadequate investments, and lack of management skills. \nConsequently,  capital  investments  in  infrastructure  and  operation \nand  maintenance  of  WSS  systems  throughout  the  country  were \nneglected. Consumers faced serious problems with shortage and \npoor  quality  of  drinking  water,  and  lack  of  wastewater  disposal \nfacilities.  At  present,  over  60%  of  the  WSS  infrastructure  in \n50 towns  and  300  villages  is  in  very  poor  condition,  and  about \n50%  of  the  water  and  sewer  networks  needs  major  rehabilitation \nand/or  replacement.  Mechanical  and  electrical  equipment  is \nobsolete  and  the  system  designs  and  standards  are  outdated. \nSewer  pipes  are  broken  and  clogged,  and  wastewater  treatment \nplants are not operating fully. Unaccounted-for water ranges from \n40%  to  90%  in  various  towns  and  villages,  and  most  people \nreceive  water  for  only  2\u20138  hours  a  day.  Poor  sanitation  facilities \nleaking  sewers  are  creating  serious  health  risks  and \nand \nenvironmental  hazards.  The  Government  of  Armenia \n(the \nGovernment) has mobilized $170 million of investment in the WSS \nsector  from  the  international  donor  community  for  disbursement \nbetween  1997  and  2011.  Since  there  is  a  considerable  gap \nbetween  the  overall  needs  and  available  financial  resources,  the \nGovernment  requested  assistance  from  the  Asian  Development \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nBank  (ADB)  for  the  proposed  Project  to  (i)  improve  the  existing \naverage 6 hours of drinking water supply to at least 12 hours for \nall  by  2012  with  safety  and  reliability,  (ii)  ensure  safe  disposal  of \nsewage  from  the  project  area,  and  (iii)  improve  the  operating \nefficiency of water service providers to ensure the sustainability of \nthe  proposed  interventions.  By  2020,  the  Government  intends  to \nachieve 24-hour supply and 100% coverage of safe drinking water \n(from  88%  in  2007),  as  well  as  90%  sanitation  coverage  (from \n60% in 2007).  \n\nregulatory \n\nframework, \n\nTo  facilitate  systematic  improvement  of  WSS  services,  the \nGovernment  approved  a  water  policy  in  2002.  It  subsequently \nintroduced  institutional  and  sector  reforms  by  strengthening  the \nlegislative  and \nrestructuring  sector \ninstitutions,  and  mobilizing  financial  resources  for  infrastructure \nimprovement. It also approved the following laws: (i) Water Code, \n2002;  (ii)  Fundamental  Provisions  of  the  National  Water  Policy, \n2005;  and  (iii)  National  Water  Program,  2006.  These  legal \ninstruments  have  provided  a  foundation  for  improving  the  quality \nand efficiency of the WSS systems. \n \nTo  manage  and  administer  the  WSS  systems  effectively,  the \nGovernment  established \nindependent  WSS  operators. \nArmenian  Water  and  Sewerage  Company  (AWSC)  and  Yerevan \nWater  and  Sewerage  Company  (YWSC)  are  the  two  main \nthree  operators  are  small  municipal \noperators.  The  other \ncompanies responsible for management of WSS systems in their \nmunicipalities.  \n\nfive \n\nfor  deciding \n\ninternational  private  contractor \n\nAWSC  is  responsible  for  management  of  WSS  systems  in \n37 towns  and  300  villages.  Since  October  2004,  it  has  been \nthrough  a \nmanaged  by  an \nmanagement  contract.  The  main  reasons \nto \nimplement a management contract were as follows: (i) tariffs were \ntoo  low  to  support  a  commercial  operation,  and  the  Government \nneeded  to  increase  tariffs  progressively  or  develop  a  system  of \npublic  subsidies  compatible  with  private  sector  participation; \n(ii) the regulatory framework was new at that time and needed to \nbe  experienced  before  implementing  a  long-term  private  sector \narrangement; (iii) the country lacked a good track record in public-\nprivate partnership; and (iv) the Government was facing difficulties \ngetting key stakeholders to agree to the long-term involvement of \nthe  private  sector  in  WSS.  Within  the  first  2.5  years,  the \nmanagement  contractor  improved  the  efficiency  of  AWSC\u2014\nincreasing revenue collection by 24%; decreasing energy costs by \n15%,  water  losses  by  20%,  and  the  number  of  employees  by \n40%; and increasing the number of metered connections by 76%. \nThe  performance  targets  in  the  management  contract-controlled \narea  for  2008  are  12-hour  supply,  98%  water  safety  compliance, \n76%  metered  water  connections,  and  90%  financial  operating \nefficiency. The current management contract will expire in October \n2008 and contains an option to extend for a further 2 years. The \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nGovernment  is  exploring  various  options  for  deeper  involvement \nof private operators in management of the company, including an \nextension  of  the  current  management  contract,  or  establishing  a \nlong-term lease or concession arrangement.  \n\nYWSC  is  responsible  for  management  of  the  WSS  system  in \nYerevan (the capital) and 33 nearby villages. Since 2005, YWSC \nhas  been  managed  and  operated  by  an  international  private \noperator through a 10-year lease contract.  \n\nThe Project will cover selected towns and villages under AWSC\u2019s \nresponsibility  and  some  selected  villages  under  none  of  the \noperators.  \n\nimpact  of \n\nthe  Project \n\nThe \nimproved  public  health  and \nis \nenvironment  for  about  576,000  people  living  in  the  project  towns \nand  villages.  The  outcome  of  the  Project  is  improved  access  to \nsustainable  WSS  in  the  project  areas.  The  Project  will  focus  on \noptimizing the operation of existing infrastructure and maximizing \nthe  operating  efficiency  of  WSS  service  providers,  followed  by \nconstructing new infrastructure. \n  \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $45.0  million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $6.7 million.  \n \n\n($ million) \n\nSource \nADB \nGovernment \n\n     Total \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n\nTotal  \n36.00 \n  9.00 \n\n45.00 \n\n% \n\n \n80.00  \n20.00  \n\n100.00  \n\nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  in  various  currencies \nequivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  23,498,000  ($36  million \nequivalent)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources.

A \nproject  governing  council  (PGC)  will  be  established  at  SCWS  to \nmonitor  project  implementation  and  ensure  consistency  with \ngovernment  policies  and  programs.  The  Government  plans  to \nprepare,  appraise,  and  award  all  the  contracts  within  the  first \n2.5 years. \n \nAll  procurement  financed  under  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). Contracts for civil works estimated to \ncost  more  than  $1  million  equivalent  and  contracts  for  goods \nestimated to cost more than $500,000 equivalent will be procured \nusing international competitive bidding (ICB). Civil works contracts \nestimated  to  cost  $1  million  equivalent  or  less  will  be  procured \nthrough  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB).  Goods  contracts \nestimated to cost between $100,000 and $500,000 equivalent will \nbe procured through NCB. Goods contracts estimated to cost less \nthan  $100.000  equivalent  will  be  carried  out  through  shopping \nprocedures.  Goods  valued  below  $10,000  may  be  purchased \ndirectly from the supplier. \n \nInputs of 1,120 person-months of national consultants are planned \nfor  project  implementation  and  management  support  to  the  PCU \nand PMU. This type of consulting services is not new to Armenia \nand national consultants have already been providing high quality \nand  cost-effective  services.  The  selection  and  engagement  of \nthese  consulting  services  will  be  in  accordance  with  the  quality \nand cost-based selection method of ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \nThe  Project \ntowns  and  about \n125 villages  with  an  overall  population  of  about  576,000  people, \n25%  of  whom  are  living  below  the  poverty  line.

AWSC has already initiated \nadvance  procurement  actions  under  ADB\u2019s  guidance.  AWSC  will \nbe  further  trained  during  the  Loan  Inception  Mission;  (ii) ADB\u2019s \npolicy  dialogue  with  the  Government  has  focused  on  sector \nimprovements  and \nthe \nGovernment  will  hold  PGC  meetings  quarterly \nto  monitor \nimplementation  of  these  reforms  within  the  agreed  time  frame. \nThe ADB team will consistently follow up and work closely with the \nGovernment  on  the  agreed  actions;  and  (iii)  the  public  outreach \nprogram\u2014including  media  campaign,  community  mobilization, \nand public workshops\u2014will be implemented to achieve community \nawareness and ownership in service delivery. Under this program, \nbeneficiaries will be involved in planning, designing, implementing, \nand  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  subprojects.  Communities \nwill  be  educated  in  proper  water  and  hygiene  practices,  and  in \ntheir  responsibilities  as  beneficiaries  to  pay  for  the  improved \nservices.  \n \n\nreforms.

It has a \nland area of approximately 28,700 square kilometers and shares land borders with Azerbaijan, \nGeorgia,  Iran,  and  Turkey.  Based  on  National  State  Statistics  Association  estimates,  the \npopulation  was  about  3.22  million  in  2006  of  which  about  64%  lives  in  urban  areas  and  the \nremainder in rural villages. About half the urban population lives in Yerevan, the capital city. The \npopulation  is  forecast  to  grow  at  0.3%  per  annum  through  2015.  For  administrative  purposes, \nArmenia is divided into 10 marzes (provinces) that are subdivided into districts, and consist of \ntowns and villages. The proportion of the population living in poverty was 29.8% in 2005. Most \nof the country\u2019s poor lives in regional towns where the incidence of poverty is about 38%. \n\nTo  improve  people\u2019s  living  standards,  the  environment,  and  public  health,  the \n3. \nGovernment  of  Armenia  (the  Government)  is  prioritizing  improved  delivery  of  water  and \nsanitation  (WSS)  services.  To  address  serious  difficulties  being  faced  by  the  majority  of  the \npopulation  because  of  unsafe  and  unreliable  water  supply  and  inadequate  sanitation  facilities, \nthe Government has mobilized financial resources, strengthened the legislative and regulatory \nframework, and restructured sector institutions. Since there is a considerable gap between the \noverall needs and available financial resources, the Government requested assistance from the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to prepare the proposed Project. ADB approved a small-scale \ntechnical  assistance1  (TA)  and  fielded  a  Loan  Fact-Finding  Mission  from  29  May  to  15  June \n2007.  This  report  is  based  on  the  TA  report  and  the  Mission\u2019s  understanding  with  the \nGovernment. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.    \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n4. \nFollowing  the  dissolution  of  the  Soviet  Union,  the  efficiency  of  WSS  management  in \nArmenia  declined  because  of  economic  collapse,  inadequate  investments,  and  lack  of \nmanagement  skills.  Consequently,  capital  investments  in  infrastructure  and  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) of WSS systems throughout the country were neglected. Consumers faced \nserious  problems  with  shortage  and  poor  quality  of  drinking  water,  and  lack  of  wastewater \ndisposal facilities. At present, over 60% of the WSS infrastructure in 50 towns and 300 villages \nis  in  very  poor  condition,  and  about  50%  of  the  water  and  sewer  networks  need  major \nrehabilitation  and/or  replacement.  In  several  towns  and  villages,  mechanical  and  electrical \nequipment  is  obsolete,  and  the  system  designs  and  standards  are  outdated.  Sewer  pipes  are \nbroken and clogged, and wastewater treatment plants are not operating fully. Unaccounted-for \nwater (UFW) ranges from 40% to 90% and most people receive water for only 2\u20138 hours a day. \nPoor sanitation facilities and leaking sewers are creating serious health risks and environmental \nhazards. \n\n5. \n\nThe sector performance indicators for 2006 show the following:  \n\n(i)  About 88% of the population has access to drinking water supply. Out of this, 75% \nhas access to piped water supply. About 15% receives 24-hour services and others \nreceive intermittent water supply for 2\u20138 hours. The remaining 12% has no access \nto safe drinking water and relies on unsafe water sources. In rural areas, about 51% \n\n                                                 \n1     ADB.  2007.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of  Armenia  for  the  Municipal  Service  and  Infrastructure \n\nDevelopment Sector Project. Manila (TA 4925-ARM, approved on 2 April, for $150,000).  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nof households have taps inside houses; the rest rely on shared, external yard taps \nor  public  standpipes.  Drinking  water  is  drawn  mainly  (96%)  from  groundwater \nsources  through  boreholes,  wells,  and  springs.  The  groundwater  resources  are \ngenerally high quality.  \nIn urban areas, about 60% of households have access to sanitation services but the \nsystems  are  seriously  degraded.  In  rural  areas,  communities  make  their  own \nprovision for sanitation, which is inadequate.  \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii)  The  operating  efficiency 2   of  water  service  providers  ranges  from  25%  to  40%, \nprompting high government subsidies. UFW ranges from 40% to 90% and revenue \ncollection  efficiency3  ranges  from  50%  to  75%.  The  main  causes  of  low  operating \nefficiency  are  low  revenue,  high  operating  costs,  and  high  UFW.  Low  revenue  is \nmainly caused by low quality of management and services, inefficiency of billing and \ncollection,  inadequate  legal  powers  given  to  service  providers  against  non-payers, \nand a poor existing tariff structure with no system of future tariff planning. High costs \nare  due  to  overdesigned  and  dilapidated  faulty  infrastructure,  old  and  inefficient \npumps,  high  cost  of  electricity,  and  lack  of  system  maintenance.  The  high  level  of \nUFW  is  due  to  system  leakages,  illegal  connections,  and  service  payment \ndefaulters.  \n\nin  2002. \n\nintroduced \n\nIt  subsequently \n\n6. \nTo  facilitate  systematic  improvement  of  WSS  services,  the  Government  approved  a \ninstitutional  and  sector  reforms  by \nwater  policy \nstrengthening  the  legislative  and  regulatory  framework,  restructuring  sector  institutions,  and \nmobilizing financial resources for infrastructure improvement. It also adopted an important water \npolicy  and  legal  framework  comprising  the  following:  (i)  Water  Code,  2002;  (ii)  National  Water \nPolicy, 2005; and (iii) National Water Program, 2006. This framework covers, among others, the \nestablishment of water management institutions; the principles of integrated water management \nand  river  basin  management;  management,  protection,  and  conservation  of  water  resources; \nsupervision  of  water  standards  and  reserves;  security  of  adequate  water  supply  to  the \npopulation  and  the  economy;  and  mandatory  preparation  of  short,  medium,  and  long-term \ninvestment  programs.  This  provides  the  foundation  for  the  policy,  and  the  sustainable \nmanagement  and  operation  of  the  WSS  systems.  The  main  principles  of  the  National  Water \nPolicy relevant to the WSS sector are (i) provision of safe drinking water of the required quantity \nand  sanitation  to  meet  the  basic  needs  of  all  the  population,  including  socially  vulnerable \ngroups;  (ii)  efficient  management  of  water  resources  and  water  systems  by  the  application  of \nwater  pricing  criteria;  (iii)  assuring  the  gradual  introduction  of  a  24-hour  water  supply; \n(iv) maintaining  sanitary  and  hygienic  standards;  (v)  assuring  water  resources  management \nthrough  \u201cuser  pays\u201d  and  \u201cpolluter  pays\u201d  principles  and  cost  recovery  approaches;  and \n(vi) managing  water  resources  and  water  systems  in  a  transparent  and  participatory  manner, \nassuring gender policy principles and public participation processes. The summary of the WSS \nsector policy is in Appendix 2, the  summary of the sector road map is  in Appendix 3, and the \nsector investment plan in Supplementary Appendix A. \n\n7. \nIn  January  2004,  the  Government  adopted  the  Law  on  Regulatory  Body  for  Public \nServices  which  entrusted  the  Public  Services  Regulatory  Commission  with  the  authority  to \nregulate public utilities in the energy, water, and telecommunications sectors. The law sets an \nenabling legal framework for an independent agency responsible for setting fair and just tariffs in \na transparent and sustainable manner.   \n\n                                                 \n2 Operating efficiency is the ration of revenue from water sales and operating cost. \n3 Revenue received as percentage of the amount billed. \n\n\fThe  Government\u2019s  law  on  local  self-government  delegates  responsibility  for  providing \n8. \nWSS  services  to  the  local  level.  Local  town  municipalities  and  village  administrations  own  the \nwater distribution networks within their administrative areas. The state owns the water resources \nand  main  infrastructure from  source  to  the  town  or  village  entry  point,  and  delivers  bulk  water \nthrough established WSS companies. Town municipalities and village administrations can either \n(i) buy  bulk  water  from  the  water  company  and  manage  the  distribution  networks  themselves, \nwhich  only  works  well  when  town  municipalities  and  village  administrations  have  adequate \ncapacity  and  the  WSS  is  simple  to  operate;  or  (ii)  enter  into  an  agreement  with  the  water \ncompany  to  manage  the  WSS  systems  and  collect  the  water  tariff  directly  from  individual \nconsumers. Town municipalities and village administrations in general lack the managerial and \ntechnical  capacity  and  financial  resources  to  manage  WSS  systems,  so  they  are  gradually \nadopting option (ii).  \n\n9. \nThe legislation has enabled restructuring of the sector institutions. The State Committee \nof Water Systems (SCWS) was established as a key sector governing body. Its responsibilities \ninclude  (i)  management,  operation,  and  safe  use  of  all  state-owned  WSS  systems; \n(ii) participation  in  preparation  and  implementation  of  the  National  Water  Program;  and \n(iii) development  and  implementation  of  the  water  sector  investment  policy  and  programs.  To \ndischarge  its  duties  and  responsibilities,  SCWS  has  established  five  independent  WSS \ncompanies.  Yerevan  Water  and  Sewerage  Company  (YWSC)  covers  the  capital  city  and  33 \nnearby villages. The Armenian Water and Sewerage Company (AWSC) delivers  service to 37 \ntowns  and  about  300 villages  throughout  the  country.  Shirak  Water  and  Sewerage  Company \n(SWSC),  Lori  Water  and  Sewerage  Company  (LWSC),  and  Nor  Akunq  Water  and  Sewerage \nCompany (NWSC) are small regional service providers for towns and villages in their respective \nregions. \n\n10. \nYWSC is a commercial company managed and operated through a lease contract by an \ninternational water utility operator. The three regional water companies are owned 51% by the \nGovernment  and  49%  by  the  respective  municipalities,  and  are  operated  and  managed  as \npublic municipal entities. AWSC is owned by the Government, and has 4 regional branches and \n34  sector  units  spread  over  the  country.  It  has  an  experienced  and  well-trained  team  of \nengineers,  financial  managers,  and  technical  specialists;  and  has  been  managed  through  a \nmanagement contract by an international water utility operator since 2004. The main reasons for \ndeciding to implement a management contract were as follows: (i) tariffs were too low to support \na  commercial  operation,  and  the  Government  needed  to  increase  tariffs  progressively  or \ndevelop  a  system  of  public  subsidies  compatible  with  private  sector  participation;  (ii)  the \nregulatory framework was new at that time and needed to be experienced before implementing \na  long-term  private  sector  arrangement;  (iii)  the  country  lacked  a  good  track  record  in  public-\nprivate partnership; and (iv) the Government was facing difficulties convincing key stakeholders \nto  agree  to  long-term  involvement  of  the  private  sector  in  WSS.  Within  the  first  2.5  years,  the \nmanagement  contractor  improved  the  efficiency  of  AWSC\u2014increasing  revenue  collection  by \n24%; decreasing energy costs by 15%, water losses by 20%, and the number of employees by \n40%; and increasing the number of metered connections by 58%.4 The performance targets in \nthe  management  contract-controlled  area  for  2008  are  12-hour  supply,  98%  water  safety \ncompliance,  76%  metered  water  connections,  and  90%  financial  operating  efficiency.  The \ncurrent management contract will expire in October 2008 and contains an option to extend for \nfurther 2 years. The Government is exploring various options for deeper involvement of private \noperators  in  management  of  the  company,  including  extension  of  the  current  management \ncontract,  or  establishing  a  long-term  lease  or  concession  arrangement.  A  team  of  experts \nfinanced  by  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development  (EBRD)  will  review  the \n\n                                                 \n4 Armenian Water and Sewerage Company Progress Report, 2007 \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\npotential for long-term private sector involvement. ADB undertook a study on the performance of \nAWSC  and  the  options  for  public-private  partnership  in  the  WSS  system  in  Armenia 5  \n(Supplementary Appendix B). Given the success of the management contract for AWSC, which \nhas  brought  increased  system  knowledge  and  improved  performance  for  AWSC,  the  study \nrecommends  to  (i)  develop  a  10-year  lease  arrangement  for  AWSC,  to  commence  after \nOctober 2008  when  the  existing  management  contract  expires;  (ii)  in  parallel,  make  a  major \nadjustment to tariffs to achieve cost recovery of O&M costs and replace the current subsidy; and \n(iii) include three small regional companies in the AWSC lease arrangement. \n  \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n11.  Municipal Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Improvement. The degraded condition of \nWSS infrastructure throughout the country and the high level of UFW are major contributors to \nthe poor quality of service and high operating costs. The overdesigned and aging WSS systems \nhave  made  it  impossible  to  operate  the  WSS  systems  efficiently  and  effectively.  The \nGovernment\u2019s main priority is to improve people\u2019s living standard by providing them with basic \nservices,  mainly  safe  and  reliable  water  supply  and  improved  sewerage  facilities.  This  will  be \nachieved through financial investments and effective management in (i) water supply, focusing \nas a first priority on optimal use of the existing infrastructure by rehabilitating and replacing the \ndeteriorated water supply infrastructure, reducing leakage, and improving supply pressure; then \nextending  new  mains  to  reinforce  supply  to  new  consumers  and  installing  water  meters  to  all \nconsumers; and (ii) sewerage improvement by cleaning existing sewers and carrying out urgent \nrepairs of damaged sewers that are polluting water supply in selected towns and villages, and \nextension of sewers to new consumers, followed by wastewater treatment.  \n\nOperational  and  Financial  Management.  In  general,  the  WSS  companies  have \n12. \nsufficient  managerial  and  technical  capability,  but  suffer  from  a  centralized  management \nstructure  that  lacks  clearly  defined  statements  of  functions,  duties  and  responsibilities,  and \noperating  procedures.  To  become  sustainable,  companies  need  to  improve  their  operational \nefficiency,  reform  their  management  structure,  and  introduce  cost-saving  and  revenue-\nimproving measures to make operations more efficient and cost-effective.   \n\n13. \nSound financial management is the key to improving the operating efficiency of the water \nsupply companies. Financial management needs to be improved in two main areas: (i) revenue \ncollection,  which  can  be  increased  by  (a)  reforming  billing  and  collection  procedures; \n(b) updating  the  consumer  database  to  register  all  new  and  illegal  consumers,  and  classifying \ncustomers by their payment history and targeting intermittent payers and persistent non-payers \nwith  public  outreach  programs,  and  granting  legal  powers  to  companies  to  enforce  a \ndisconnection  policy  for  defaulters  of  WSS  bills,  and  metering  all  the  connections;  and \n(ii) operating costs, which can be reduced by  introducing improved cost control and budgeting \nsystems and procedures and by implementing cost reduction techniques. Prime areas for cost \nreduction include reducing electricity costs and eliminating redundant administrative costs.       \n\n14. \nTariff Reform. The sector urgently needs a clear and transparent system of tariff setting \nto  take  into  account  the  service  costs  and  impact  of  inflation.  At  present,  an  inflexible  tariff \nstructure applies a standard rate across the country. The cost of supplying water from a source \nthat requires pumping is higher than the cost of supplying water by gravity. This cost difference \nis not reflected in the tariff, so there is an internal cross-subsidy as consumers in low production \ncost areas subsidize consumers in high production cost areas. In general, the tariffs are low and \nthe  tariff  structure  is  not  adequate.  Further,  the  Government  has  to  subsidize  the  revenue \n\n                                                 \n5    ADB.  2007.

Manila. \n\n\fshortfall because of the low collection efficiency. To help ensure the sustainability of the overall \nWSS  operations,  there  is  an  urgent  need  to  rationalize  existing  tariffs  with  an  adequate  tariff \nstructure for all types of domestic, commercial, and bulk consumers; meter all the connections; \nand  introduce  a  tariff  plan  that  includes  progressive  tariff  revision,  taking  into  account  service \ncost  and  inflation.  All  these  measures  should  be  linked  with  improved  service  delivery  and \nsound operational management to ensure people\u2019s willingness to pay.  \n\nService  Delivery  Targets.  The  Government  aims \n\n15. \nthe  Millennium \nDevelopment  Goals  with  respect  to  WSS  and  by  2015,  halve  the  number  of  people  who  are \ncurrently  without  access  to  safe  water  and  adequate  sanitation.  SCWS  is  updating  the  sector \nstrategy for providing safe and reliable water supply to the population in three stages: \n \n\nto  achieve \n\n(i)  For  poor  rural  communities  in  remote  areas,  which  are  not  covered  by  existing \nservice providers, the target is to provide a basic lifeline supply of 50 liters per capita \nper day (lpcd) through public standpipes located not more than 100 meters from the \nhouse.  \n\n(ii)  For towns and villages, where safe drinking water can be supplied by the local water \ncompany, the target for 2012 is piped water supply for at least 12 hours per day with \ncost recovery through the tariff sufficient to cover O&M costs. \n\n(iii)  The  ultimate  target  for  2020  is  to  provide  24-hour  water  supply  to  all  towns  and \n\nvillages, with adequate pressure and full cost recovery. \n\n16. \nPolicy  Dialogue.  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  has  focused  on  (i)  cost \nrecovery and tariff reforms by (a) rationalizing existing low tariffs and implementing a tariff plan \nthat includes progressive tariff revision to ensure full cost recovery and adequate funds for loan \nrepayment;  (b)  eliminating  government  subsidy  on  tariffs;  (c)  granting  legal  powers  to \ncompanies  to  enforce  disconnection  policy  for  defaulters  of  WSS  bills  to  improve  collection \nefficiency,  deter  nonpayment,  and  ensure  the  sustainability  of  WSS  operations;  (ii)  enterprise \nreforms  and  corporate  governance,  ensuring  full  autonomy  for  AWSC  to  manage  and  operate \nWSS services without any outside interference, disseminate annual reports on its operation and \ndevelopment  each  year,  and  implement  a  systematic  program  of  organization  development; \n(iii) water  conservation  through  metering  all  the  connections  and  urgently  reducing  UFW;  and \n(iv)  institutionalization  of  community-based  operations  to  address  the  existing  problem  of \nunclear ownership of systems in villages and weak management for O&M. \n\n17. \nExternal  Assistance.  The  Government  has  attracted  investments  in  the  WSS  sector \nfrom  the  international  donor  community  amounting  to  about  $170  million  for  disbursement \nbetween  1997  and  2011.  Yerevan  has  received  about  $56  million  and  the  other  regions \n$114 million. The proposed Project will be the first WSS project financed by ADB in Armenia.   \n\n18. \nThe World Bank has supported projects for Yerevan water supply, municipal water and \nwastewater,  and  rural  dam  safety.  German  development  cooperation  through  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr \nWiederaufbau  (KfW)  has  invested  in  the  three  regional  water  supply  companies.  The  Japan \nSocial Development Fund has implemented a community  water supply project and Millennium \nChallenge Corporation  is  supporting  irrigation  infrastructure.  EBRD  has  approved  a  project  for \nLake  Sevan  environmental  protection  and  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  is \nundertaking a feasibility study on rural water supply and sanitation. The United States Agency \nfor  International  Development  is  planning  a  water  supply  project  for  two  small  towns.  Further \ndetails are in Appendix 4.   \n\nLessons  Learned.  A  review  of  ADB-wide  experience  with  rehabilitation  assistance \n19. \nindicates that projects should (i) be prepared promptly, (ii) focus on infrastructure investment in \ncombination  with  management  improvement,  (iii)  feature  a  flexible  implementation  process, \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f(iv) provide  strong  consulting  support  and  ADB  supervision  during  implementation,  (v)  be \nsupported  by  prompt  government  action,  (vi)  ensure  that  decision  making  on  core  issues  of \nproject  design  and  implementation  be  decentralized  to  achieve  timely  project  preparation  and \nimplementation, and (vii) ensure that intensive consultations with all stakeholders are held and \nall the required information is disseminated during preparation and implementation of projects.    \n\n20. \nSince this is ADB\u2019s first project in the WSS sector in Armenia, it has no direct experience \nin  this  sector  in  Armenia.  However,  experience  from  other  externally  assisted  projects  in \nArmenia  shows  that  (i)  the  well-developed  legal  and  regulatory  framework  enables  smooth \nimplementation  of  sector  reforms,  (ii)  decentralization  of  water  sector  operations  and \nmanagement through the creation of area-based water companies is effective and can deliver \nimprovements  in  the  key  sector  performance  indicators,  (iii)  improvements  in  service  delivery \nalone  do  not  necessarily  yield  increased  revenue,  and  (iv)  public  outreach  programs  to \npersuade people to pay, and enforceable sanctions against persistent non-payers are needed. \nADB\u2019s  experience  in  similar  projects  in  other  regions  shows  that  improvements  in  O&M, \nincluding  specific  programs  to  reduce  levels  of  UFW,  represent  a  cost-effective  and \nenvironmentally  responsible  approach  to  water  management  and  should  form  essential \ncomponents of future ADB-financed projects. The proposed Project has been carefully designed \nto reflect each of these lessons. \n\n21. \nSector Loan Approach. The Project could not be processed as a standard project loan \nbecause  of  the  large  number  of  relatively  small  subprojects  that  are  geographically  dispersed \nand needed to be implemented urgently. The sector loan approach is based on the following. \n\n(i)  The  Government\u2019s  sector  policies,  development  objectives,  and  approach  to \nregional WSS systems development are well formulated. Progress in implementing \npolicies  has  been  satisfactory  and  the  Government  is  consistently  updating  its \nsector policies with donor support. \n\n(ii)  Sector  institutions  are  well  developed  and  their  capacity  will  strengthen  with \nadditional  strengthening  and  support  provided  under  the  Project.  SCWS,  the \nExecuting Agency (EA), and AWSC, the Implementing Agency (IA), have substantial \nexperience of implementing similar projects. \n\n(iii)  The  sector  investment  plan  and  planned  subprojects  are  well  conceived  and \n\nappropriately formulated. \n\n22. \nThe  Government  has  submitted  three  documents  needed  for  sector  lending:  (i)  sector \ndevelopment  plan,  (ii)  description  of  sector  policies,  and  (iii)  assessment  of  capacity  to \nimplement the plan. These documents have been found in order.   \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n23. \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  is  improved  public  health  and  environment  for  about \n576,000 people living in 16 towns and about 125 villages through safe and reliable water supply \nand improved sewerage and sanitation facilities. The Project will help the Government provide \nthe required institutional and management support to AWSC and local municipal governments \nto enable them to be more self-disciplined in financial, managerial, and technical aspects. \n\n24. \nThe  outcome  is  improved  access  to  safe,  reliable,  and  sustainable  WSS  services \nmanaged on commercial principles and environmentally sound practices. The Project will focus \nfirst  on  optimizing  the  operation  of  existing  infrastructure  and  maximizing  the  operating \nefficiency of WSS service providers, followed by constructing new infrastructure. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fThe Government provided a list of indicative 18 subprojects covering towns and villages \n25. \nwhere there is a desperate need for urgent WSS improvements (Appendix 5). The project team \nreviewed the feasibility studies of two candidate subprojects. One represents a typical provincial \ntown and the other a typical group of five village communities. The purpose of the review was to \ndemonstrate  the  approaches  and  procedures  of  subproject  selection  and  appraisal.  The \nappraisal indicates that both subprojects are feasible in terms of technical, institutional, social, \nfinancial, economic, and environmental aspects (Supplementary Appendix C).  \n\n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  Project  comprises  the  following  main  components:  (i)  municipal  infrastructure \n\n26. \nrehabilitation and improvement, and (ii) management improvement and development.  \n\n1.  \n\nComponent A:  Municipal Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Improvement \n\n27. \nThis  component  comprises  two  parts:  (i)  rehabilitation  and  extension  of  distribution \nsystems,  and  (ii)  improvement  of  sewerage  systems.  The  first  part  will  address  rehabilitation \nand replacement of the deteriorated water supply infrastructure by reducing leakage; improving \nsupply pressure; constructing new mains to connect new consumers, particularly poorly served \nlow-income  communities;  installing  water  meters  to  all  bulk  and  domestic  consumers,  and \nrepairing/remodeling  water  intakes,  pumps,  flow  meters,  valves,  and  treatment  units;  and \nproviding new storage reservoirs and tubewells at technically viable locations. The second part \nwill address improvement of the sewerage system by cleaning existing sewers and carrying out \nurgent repairs/replacement of damaged sewers that are polluting water supply in selected towns \nand  villages.  This  part  also  includes  the  provision  of  sewer  cleaning  machinery  and  other \nessential equipment required for efficiently operating WSS systems.    \n\n28. \nBy  redesigning  the  overall  WSS  systems,  this  component  addresses  the  existing \nproblems  of  the  systems  being  overdesigned/under-designed.  It  also  includes  updating  of \nconsumer  databases, conversion  of  illegal  connections to  registered  accounts,  and  monitoring \nof water quality. To demonstrate 100% water supply coverage, 100% metering, 24-hour water \nsupply  with the  desired pressure,  and  100% collection  efficiency,  the  Project  will select  a  pilot \nzone  and  concentrate  resources  to  undertake  the  related  actions.  This  will  help  gain  the \nconfidence  of  all  consumers  in  the  project  area  in  an  efficient  and  strongly  governed  WSS \nsystem,  and  help  the  IA  to  replicate  it  smoothly.  Selection  of  the  pilot  zone  will  be  based  on \nactive participation and strong commitment of the users, apart from technical considerations to \nisolate  the  zone  hydraulically  for  the  required  water  pressure  after  addressing  all  the  water \nlosses.        \n\n2. \n\nComponent B: Management Improvement and Capacity Development \n\n29. \nThis  component  addresses  core  issues  and  challenges  being  faced  by  AWSC, \nmunicipalities,  and  communities  in  managing  the  WSS  systems  efficiently.  Management \nefficiency  will  be  improved  by  a  combination  of  technical,  financial,  legal,  and  public  outreach \nmeasures. The overall tasks to be carried out are as follows. \n\n \n\n a. \n\nImprovement of Operating Efficiency of AWSC \n\n30. \nPlanned  interventions  are  (i)  training  in  technical  and  financial  management  for  AWSC \nstaff,  including  mapping  and  asset  management;  (ii)  improving  the  financial  management \nsystem by introducing improved accounting procedures, computerized billing, and management \ninformation  systems  (including  budgeting,  inventory  of  assets  and  staffing,  O&M  of  assets, \nbilling,  revenue  collection,  and  reporting  systems);  (iii)  rationalizing  existing  tariffs  and \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fintroducing a tariff plan that includes progressive tariff revision by including inflation and cost of \nservices; (iv) measures for cost reduction such as electricity and redundant administrative costs; \n(v) increasing public awareness on water quality and sustainability of facilities, and options for \nimproving delivery of WSS services; and (vi) improving regulatory systems to ensure that laws, \nstandards,  rules,  and  regulations  are  equitably  and  consistently  applied.  Wherever  possible, \ntechnical  training  will  be  linked  to  measurable  outputs  to  help  determine  whether  skill  levels \nhave  been  achieved  and  technical  training  is  applied.  The  design  and  implementation  of \nmeasures for improved municipal management will be coordinated with ongoing projects funded \nby other donors. \n\n31. \nUnder  this  subcomponent,  AWSC  will  receive  assistance  to  strengthen  the  service \ncontracts  between  the  company  and  municipal  governments  on  the  use  of  locally  owned \ndistribution networks, and between the company and communities taking a bulk water supply\u2014\nto define the relationship between the parties better. A disconnection policy for non-payers will \nbe  framed  to  formulate  proposals  for  empowering  AWSC  to  implement  this  policy,  and  an \nincentive plan will be prepared for regular payers. A human resource development strategy will \nbe  furnished,  which  will  include  rightsizing  and  training  of  staff  and  improved  business  rules. \nThis  will  clearly  define  the  functions,  duties,  and  responsibilities  of  the  management  structure \ngiving  it  autonomy  to  manage  the  systems  independently.  A  public  outreach  program  will  be \nimplemented  to  achieve  community  ownership  in  service  delivery.  Under  this  program, \nbeneficiaries will be approached for their involvement in planning, designing, implementing, and \nO&M of the subprojects. Communities will be educated in proper water and hygiene practices, \nand their responsibilities as beneficiaries to pay for the improved services. It will be ensured that \ngood practices and lessons are disseminated both within Armenia and in other regions.  \n\nThis  subcomponent  will  support  AWSC\u2019s  plan  of  organizational  restructuring  and \n32. \nperformance  improvement,  which  will  result  in  establishing  and  streamlining  operations  of  the \nfinancial, technical, and asset management and procurement directorates.  \n\nb. \n\nImprovement of Communities\u2019 Management Skills \n\n33. \nThis  subcomponent  will  build  the  capacity  of  communities  to  operate,  manage,  and \nmaintain  their  own  small-scale  WSS  systems  effectively  in  a  sustainable  manner.  Major \nactivities  will  comprise  (i)  training  programs  in  technical  management  and  operation  of  small \nwater  systems,  including  water  source  protection;  (ii)  preparation  of  manuals  in  the  local \nlanguage for regular sampling, testing, and treatment of drinking water; (iii) basic WSS system \nmaintenance  and  repair,  and  reporting  to  AWSC  for  assistance  in  case  of  major  breakdowns; \nincluding  budgeting,  billing  and  collection,  and \n(iv) \nbookkeeping; and (v) overall system administration.  \n\nfinancial  management, \n\nimproved \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nOptimization  of  Existing  Infrastructure.  The  Project  will  adopt  a  logical  sequence  of \n34. \ninterventions.  Since  large  investments  already  made  on  the  existing  infrastructure  are  not \ndelivering  efficient  services,  the  primary  focus  will  be  on  optimizing  the  operation  of  existing \ninfrastructure  and  maximizing  the  operating  efficiency  of  WSS  service  providers,  instead  of \nupfront  construction  of  new  infrastructure.  This  will  allow  the  Project  to  economize  the \ninvestment,  achieve  considerable  development  impacts,  and  ensure  sustainability  of  the  WSS \nsystem with sound technical and financial management.    \n\n35. \nPilot  Zoning.  To  demonstrate  100%  water  supply  coverage,  100%  metering,  24-hour \nwater supply, and 100% collection efficiency, the Project will select a pilot zone and fix all the \nidentified  problems  related  to  physical  interventions  and  improved  governance.  This  will  help \ngain the confidence of consumers in the project area in an efficient and strongly governed WSS \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fsystem  that  can  work  for  people\u2019s  welfare,  and  help  the  IA  to  replicate  it  smoothly  in  other \nproject areas.    \n\nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nThe project investment cost is estimated at $45.0 million, including $6.7 million of taxes \n36. \nand  duties. A  summary  of  the  cost estimates  is  in  Table  1,  and  detailed  cost  estimates  are in \nAppendix 6. \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\n1.

The  loan  will  have  a  32-year  term,  including  a \ngrace period of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  The  Government  will  finance  about  $9.0  million  (20%).  The \nfinancing plan is summarized in Table 2 and details are in Appendix 6.  \n\nThe  country  cost-sharing  limit  has  not  yet  been  determined  for  Armenia.  At  present,   \n\n38. \nADB financing in Armenia has a cost-sharing limit that would have applied to Armenia prior to \nthe  Innovation  and  Efficiency  Initiative  policies  as  of  August  2005,  which  is  75%.  Considering \nthat the Project targets poor communities that are currently facing serious problems of shortage \nand poor quality of drinking water caused by deteriorated infrastructure, a 5% variance from the \nsaid cost-sharing limit is justified.    \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \n\n \n\nTotal \n\nTotal \n36.00 \n  9.00 \n\n45.00 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n% \n80.00 \n20.00 \n\n100.00 \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n39. \nThe  Government  of  Armenia  will  relend  the  loan  to  AWSC  under  a  subsidiary  loan \nagreement upon the same terms and conditions as the ADB loan. AWSC will bear the foreign \nexchange  risk  and  the  Government  will  finance  all  the  taxes  and  duties.  The  project  flow  of \nfunds is in Appendix 7.  \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n40. \nSCWS,  the  EA,  will  coordinate  project  implementation  and  establish  a  project \ncoordination unit (PCU) headed by a project coordinator. The PCU, comprised of two national \nwater  supply  and  sewerage  consultants,  and  one  national  financial  analyst/economist,  will  be \nresponsible for appraising subprojects, and preparing the project completion report with AWSC. \nA representative of the PCU will be included in the procurement tender commission. The PCU \nwill  coordinate  closely  with  ADB,  the  project  management  unit  (PMU),  and  other  government \nagencies. The PCU will ensure that its technical staff is involved in the feasibility studies, which \nwill facilitate appraising the subproject in a timely manner. \n\n41. \nAWSC,  the  IA,  will  establish  a  PMU  to  implement  the  Project  located  both  inside  and \noutside  AWSC\u2019s  existing  service  zone.  The  PMU,  supported  by  a  team  of  consultants,  will  be \nresponsible  for  preparing  the  subproject  feasibility  studies,  detailed  engineering  designs,  and \ntender documents; and undertaking construction supervision of all subprojects. The PMU will be \nheaded  by  a  project  manager  and  staffed  by  the  WSS  engineer/monitoring  specialist, \nprocurement  specialist,  financial/accounting  specialist,  and  support  staff.  The  PMU,  in \ncoordination  with  the  PCU,  will  recruit  the  project  consultants.  Appendix  8  shows  the  project \nimplementation \nframework  and  Supplementary  Appendix  D  elaborates \nimplementation \narrangements.  \n\n42. \nA  project  governing  council  (PGC)  will  be  set  up  as  a  high-level  advisory  body  within \n1 month  of  loan  effectiveness.  The  PGC  will  (i)  be  headed  by  the  chair  of  SCWS,  part  of  the \nMinistry  of  Territorial  Administrations  which  coordinates  all  the  municipalities  and  local \nadministrations; and (ii) include senior officers from AWSC, Ministry of Finance and Economy,  \nMinistry of Nature Protection (the environment agency), SCWS, and other ministries as may be \nrequired,, and civil society representatives of the project beneficiaries. The PGC shall operate in \naccordance  with  Resolution  No.  765  \u201cOn  the  Activities  of  Project  Implementation  with  the \nProceeds  of  Loans  and  Grants  Provided  to  the  Republic  of  Armenia  by  Foreign  States  and \nInternational  Financial  Institutions\u201d,  dated  December  22,  1999;  and  shall  be  responsible  for \n(i) guiding the overall policy and strategic direction of the Project, (ii) reviewing and evaluating \nproject/subproject performance, and (iii) assisting with coordination among other donor-funded \nprojects  relating  to  the  WSS.  The  PGC  will  meet  quarterly  to  ensure  orderly  implementation, \nprovide  policy  guidance  on  ongoing  and  new  government  initiatives,  and  facilitate  interagency \ncooperation and coordination among concerned national and local government bodies. \n\n2. \n\nSubproject Selection, Preparation, and Appraisal \n\nThe  subprojects  will  be  selected  in  accordance  with  the  following  basic  criteria:  (i)  the \n43. \nsubproject is in conformity with the Government\u2019s sector policies, development objectives, and \nstrategy of WSS system development; (ii) the existing water supply network and equipment of \nthe  subproject  are  dilapidated,  corroded,  and  leaking  and/or  sewer  pipes  are  broken  and \nclogged\u2014resulting  in  serious  water  supply  shortages  and  adverse  environmental  problems; \n(iii) the  subproject  is  technically  viable,  considering  least-cost  and  technically  sound  options, \nand is economically and financially feasible; (iv) for villages that are not covered under AWSC, \nvillage  administration/communities  will,  on  a  long-term  basis  and  in  a  manner  acceptable  to \n\n \n\n\fSCWS,  commit  to  (a)  provide  periodic  (at  least  semi-annual)  inspection  of  the  WSS  system, \nwater source and catchments, water supply treatment, and otherwise comply with technical and \nsanitary requirements in accordance with Armenia\u2019s legislation, and (b) engage managerial and \ntechnical support and training from AWSC with respect to operation and maintenance of WSS \nsystem within their responsibility; (v) the subproject complies with ADB safeguard policies and \nhas  no  significant  environmental  impacts;  and  (vi)  the  subproject  can  be  completed  within  the \nproject implementation period. Further details are in Appendix 9.  \n\n44. \nThe  subprojects  will  be located  both  within  and  outside  AWSC\u2019s  existing  service  zone. \nMunicipalities  located  outside  the  AWSC  service  zone,  to  be  included  under  the  Project,  are \nthose  that  intend  to join  the  AWSC  service  zone.  Among  the  municipalities  not served  by  any \nservice provider, priority will be given to those that currently receive bulk water from AWSC. \n\nThe  PMU,  with  the  support  of  technical  consultants  and  participation  of  PCU  technical \n45. \nstaff,  and  in  consultation  with  local  governments  and  beneficiary  communities,  will  prepare  a \nfeasibility study for each short-listed subproject. The PMU will prepare and submit to PCU the \nfeasibility  study  report,  which  will  include  technical,  financial,  environmental,  and  social \nsafeguard  assessments.  The  PCU  will  prepare  the  subproject  appraisal  report  for  the  EA\u2019s \napproval.  The  subproject  appraisal  report  for  the  first  subproject,  and  for  any  subproject \nexceeding $2 million equivalent, will require ADB approval. \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe  Project  will  be \n\n46. \nin  2008.  An  estimated \nimplementation  period  is  based  on  the  large  number  and  wide  geographic  distribution  of \npotential  subprojects.  The  implementation  schedule  of  the  Project  is  in  Appendix  10.  The \nGovernment plans to prepare, appraise, and award all the contracts within the first 2.5 years. \n \n\nin  5  years,  starting \n\nimplemented \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n Except  as  otherwise  provided  below,  procurement  financed  under  the  Project  will  be \n47. \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). Contracts for civil works estimated to cost more than $1 million equivalent and contracts \nfor goods estimated to cost more than $500,000 equivalent will be procured using international \ncompetitive  bidding (ICB). Civil  works contracts estimated to cost $1 million equivalent or less \nwill  be  carried  out  through  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB).  Goods  contracts  estimated  to \ncost  between  $100,000  and  $500,000  equivalent  will  be  procured  through  NCB.  Procurement \nunder NCB will be carried out in accordance with Armenia\u2019s law on procurement of 1 January \n2005, subject to modification and clarifications set forth in the Loan Agreement. Goods contracts \nestimated to cost less than $100,000 equivalent will be procured through shopping procedures. \nGoods valued below $10,000 may be purchased directly from the supplier. In such cases, ADB \nshould be satisfied that the price paid is reasonable. The award of all contracts shall be subject \nto prior approval by ADB. The procurement plan is in Appendix 11. \n \n48. \nThe  country  presently  imports  pipes,  pumping  equipment  and  fittings  from  non-ADB \nmember  countries.  Restricting  procurement  of  this  equipment  procurement  to  ADB  member \ncountries  may  preclude  civil  works  contractors  under  the  Project  from  obtaining  the  best \neconomic  terms,  and  may  seriously  erode  economic  efficiency.  It  is  proposed  that  civil  work \ncontractors under the Project be allowed to procure this equipment for WSS improvement works \nfrom all countries, including from countries that are not ADB members. \n \n\n49. \nSimple,  minor,  and  remotely  located  civil  works  may  be  difficult  to  undertake  by \ncontractors at a reasonable cost. Such works may be undertaken by AWSC using its own staff \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f(force account), provided the works cost less than $10,000 equivalent. Force account will only \nbe used if AWSC has adequate construction facilities, including equipment and the capacity to \nundertake the works expeditiously and at a reasonable cost. \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n50. \nTo  support  project  implementation  and  build  the  long-term  capacity  of  SCWS  and \nAWSC,  which  are  responsible  for  the  planning  and  delivery  of  WSS  services,  1,120  person-\nmonths  of  national  consulting  services  will  be  provided,  covering:  (i)  package A:  project \nimplementation and management support to the PCU and PMU, including subproject feasibility \nstudy,  appraisal,  and  training  (324 person-months);  and  (ii)  package  B:  detailed  engineering \ndesign  and  construction  supervision  (796 person-months).  For  package  A,  individual  national \nconsultants  will  be  recruited  and  tasks  under  package  B  will  be  carried  out  by  a  firm.  The \nGovernment has agreed to recruit individual consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s procedures \nfor recruiting individual consultants. This type of consulting services is not new to Armenia and \nnational  consultants  have  already  been  providing  high  quality  and  cost-effective  services  on \nother projects. Supplementary Appendix E details the terms of reference for consultants. \n\n51. \nSelection  and  engagement  of  consulting  services  for  package  B  will  be  in  accordance \nwith  the  quality  and  cost-based  selection  method  and  full  technical  proposal  under  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n\n6. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n52. \nTo meet the service delivery targets set by the Government, it is essential to commence \nthe  preparation  of  subprojects  in  2007.  The  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  approve \nadvance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  for  feasibility  studies,  taking  preparatory  actions \nto establish the PCU and PMU, and start recruitment of project implementation consultants. The \nconsultants, PMU, and PCU will undertake necessary surveys and prepare subproject feasibility \nstudies and detailed engineering designs.     \n\n53. \nAdvance contracting allows the Government to undertake procurement procedures, at its \nown risk, prior to the loan becoming effective. The Government was informed that, for expenses \nincurred  under  advance  contracting  to  be  eligible  for  ADB\u2019s  retroactive  financing,  such \nprocedures  (including  advertising)  must  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  and \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. Once the loan becomes effective, up to 20% of the loan \nmay be used to finance eligible expenditures incurred, pursuant to advance contracting, during \nthe  period  not  exceeding  12  months  prior  to  signing  the  Loan  Agreement.  Alternatively,  the \nGovernment  may  opt  for  advance  contracting  without  retroactive  financing,  in  which  case  the \nprocurement procedures completed under advance contracting do not conclude with the award \nof  contract  until  after  the  loan  becomes  effective.  The  Government  acknowledges  that  it \nundertakes such advance contracting at its own risk, and that any concurrence by ADB with the \nprocedures, documentation, or proposal for award of contract does not commit ADB to finance \nany such expenditures or the Project. The ADB project team provided orientation to AWSC staff \nregarding ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.   \n \n\n7. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n54. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  EA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\floan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n\n8. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n55. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  PMU  of  AWSC,  as  IA,  will  open  and \nmanage  an  imprest  account  after  loan  effectiveness.  Disbursements  from  the  imprest  account \nwill  be  supported  by  an  appropriate  withdrawal  application  and  related  documentation.  Such \ndocumentation  will  demonstrate  that  the  goods/services  (i)  were  produced  and  procured  from \nADB  member  countries,  and  (ii)  are  eligible  for  ADB  financing.  The  initial  amount  to  be \ndeposited  into  the  imprest  accounts  will  not  exceed  the  estimated  eligible  expenditure  for  the \nnext 6 months, or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. The statement of expenditures \nprocedure  may  be  used  for  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures;  any  individual  payment  to \nbe reimbursed or liquidated under the procedure will not exceed the equivalent of $100,000. \n\n9. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n56. \nThe  PMU  will  prepare  quarterly  progress  reports  indicating  progress  made,  problems \nencountered  during  the  review  period,  steps  taken  or  proposed  to  remedy  the  problems, \nproposed program of activities, and progress expected for the following quarter. The PMU will \nensure  that  the  reports  are  consolidated  and  submitted  to  ADB  in  a  timely  manner.  Within \n6 months  of  physical  completion  of  the  Project,  the  PMU,  in  coordination  with  the  PCU,  will \nsubmit a project completion report. \n\n57. \nThe  PCU  and  PMU  will  maintain  records  and  accounts  that  identify  the  goods  and \nservices financed from the loan proceeds, financing resources received, expenditures incurred \nfor  the  Project,  and  use  of  local  funds.  The  accounts  will  be  established  and  maintained  in \naccordance with sound accounting principles and appropriate accounting standards. The annual \nproject  accounts  of  PCU  and  PMU,  and  each  set  of  financial  statements,  will  be  audited  by \nauditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  A  separate  audit  report  on  the  use  of  imprest  accounts  and \nstatement of expenditures procedure will be provided to ADB. The audit reports, management \nletter, and related financial statements will be submitted to ADB not later than 6 months after the \nend  of  the  fiscal  year  to  which  they  relate,  or  the  project  closing  date  if  earlier.  ADB  has \ninformed the Government of its policy on submission of audited accounts, which covers failure \nto submit audited accounts and financial statements by the due date. A formal warning will be \nissued  for  accounts  more  than  6  months  overdue,  and  disbursements  will  be  suspended  for \naccounts that are 12 months overdue.  \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Performance Management and Evaluation \n\n58. \nA  short-list  of  verifiable  performance  indicators  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  was \nprepared  during  the  TA  (Supplementary  Appendix  F).  SCWS  and  AWSC  will  ensure  that  a \ncomprehensive  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS) \nis  established  and \nmaintained to monitor and evaluate the technical performance and social and economic benefits \nof  the  Project,  especially  for  the  poor  and  for  women.  The  performance  monitoring  indicators \nand  procedures  will  be  tested  with  respect  to  data  availability  and  other  constraints,  revised  if \nnecessary,  and  institutionalized  as  part  of  the  Project\u2019s  management  information  system.  The \nPMU  will  be  responsible  for  establishing  the  PPMS,  and  monitoring  and  assessment  of  the \nperformance  of  subprojects  at  6-month  intervals.  To  measure  the  Project\u2019s  impact  on \nbeneficiaries, particularly low-income groups, baseline information established during the TA will \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nbe updated at the beginning of implementation of each project component. This information will \nbe  the  basis  for  determining  the  resulting  impacts.  Indicators  that  can  be  monitored  will \ncomprise:  (i)  institutional  improvement  indicators,  covering  revenue  generation,  financial \nmanagement,  O&M,  and  UFW;  (ii)  subproject  implementation  indicators  for  the  various \ncategories, including levels of coverage and service delivery; and (iii) sectoral impact indicators, \ncovering  economic  growth,  public  health,  and  community  participation.  AWSC  will  continue  to \nupdate  and  forward  the  PPMS  to  ADB  at  6-month  intervals  for  at  least  3  years  after  project \ncompletion. The relevance and practicability of data collection for the indicators were confirmed \nwith SCWS and AWSC.  \n \n\n11. \n\nProject Review \n\nReview  missions  will  be  undertaken  twice  a  year  for  the  first  2  years  and  once  a  year \n59. \nthereafter.  ADB  and  the  Government  will  undertake  a  midterm  review  3  years  after  project \nimplementation  begins.  This  review  will \nthe  scope, \nimplementation  arrangements,  resettlement,  achievement  of  scheduled  targets,  and  progress \nwith the policy reform agenda and capacity building measures. Feedback from PPMS activities \nwill also be analyzed.  \n \n\ninclude  a  detailed  evaluation  of \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts and Benefits \n\n60. \nOverall,  the  Project  provides  environmental  benefits  by  improving  sanitation  and \nproviding  safe,  reliable  water  supply  to  towns,  villages,  and  communities.  Two  initial \nin \nenvironmental  examinations  (IEEs)  were  carried  out  (Supplementary  Appendix  G) \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002),  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines, 6  \nand  Armenian  environmental  guidelines.  One  IEE  was  prepared  for  a  provincial  town  and  the \nother for a group of five village communities.  \n\nthat \n\nThe \n\nIEEs  demonstrated \n\n61. \nin  Armenia  have  WSS \ninfrastructure in dire need of rehabilitation. The sample town showed that 70% of the total water \nsupplied  is  lost  through  leakage.  In  addition,  water  supply  is  only  available  for  typically             \n4\u20136 hours  a  day  because  electricity  is  costly.  Furthermore,  rural  communities  have  not  had \nconstant water supply in more than 15 years. Since then, they buy water delivered by tankers \nfrom bigger communities or manually transport water from springs. \n\ntowns  and  communities \n\n62. \nTo improve the WSS systems, the Project includes the construction and rehabilitation of \nwater  supply  mains  and  distribution  pipelines,  repair  of  water  pump  stations,  construction  and \nrehabilitation of sewer pipelines, and construction and repair of water storage reservoirs. These \nphysical  improvements  do  not  pose  any  significant  adverse  environmental  effects.  The \nproposed sources, both spring and groundwater, demonstrate good water quality. \n\n63. \nThe  screening  process  carried  out  for  the  IEEs  has  identified  minor  possible  adverse \nenvironmental impacts likely to be caused by the Project. Most potential negative impacts may \noccur during construction. However, they will be temporary and can be mitigated to acceptable \nlevels.  Effort  will  be  made  to  (i)  protect  the  sources,  (ii)  minimize  construction  pollution  and \nwaste,  and  (iii)  limit  specific  impacts  related  to  the  pipeline  routes.  A  summary  IEE  is  in \nAppendix 12. \n\nTo  ensure  environmentally  sustainable \n\n64. \nthe  subprojects,  an \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  procedure  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  applicable \n\nimplementation  of \n\n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2003. Environmental Assessment Guidelines. Manila. \n\n \n\n\fenvironmental  requirements  of  ADB  and  the  Government,  including  an  environmental \nmonitoring and management plan. This will guide AWSC during the environmental assessment \nprocess  for  subprojects  to  prevent  or  mitigate  adverse  environmental  impacts  with  mitigation \nmeasures  (Supplementary  Appendix  H).  In  addition,  a  proposed  institutional  arrangement \ninvolving representatives from SCWS, Ministry of Health, and Ministry of Nature Protection will \nensure  minimization  of  any  adverse  environmental \nissues  and  compliance  with  all \nenvironmental policies of Armenia. Overall, according to the findings of the IEEs, the Project will \nhave significant positive impacts on the quality of life and environment for beneficiaries; and will \nensure  environmental  safeguards  for  implementing  a  continuous,  reliable  water  supply  and \nadequate sanitation facilities.  \n\nB. \n\nSocial Dimensions \n\n1. \n\nPoverty Reduction and Social Benefits \n\n65. \nPoverty  and  social  analysis  was  conducted  during  project  preparation.  The  Project  will \nbenefit a total population of about 576,000 people (of which 49% live in regional towns and 51% \nin  rural  communities)  through  safe  drinking  water  and  improved  sanitation.  Of  the  total,  about \n140,000  beneficiary  households  (about  25%  of  the  households)  are  poor  and  receive  poverty \nfamily  benefit.  The  poverty  reduction  and  strategy  paper 7   highlights  the  importance  of \ninvestments in basic rural infrastructure. It gives priority to the construction and rehabilitation of \nrural  roads,  optimization  of  health  and  educational  facilities,  improving  access  to  safe  and \nreliable drinking water, ensuring 24-hour supply and improving the quality of the water supply, \nand an irrigation program aimed at increasing the share of irrigated land and regulation of the \nirrigation  water  supply  systems.  A  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in \nAppendix 13 and details are in Supplementary Appendix I. \n\n66. \nThe  Project  will  support  poverty  reduction  by  (i)  reducing  the  incidence  of  waterborne \ndiseases, costs of medical care, and sick days taken\u2014reducing household health expenditures; \n(ii)  decreasing  the  workload  for  women  in  the  house\u2014providing  the  opportunity  for  them  to \nbecome more involved in social and economic activities; (iii) providing safer and more reliable \nwater supplies; (iv) improving the quality of life of the urban and rural population, particularly the \npoor, by increasing their access to safe drinking water and improving hygiene and sanitation. \n\nA  survey  and  interviews  were  conducted  with  key  stakeholders,  including  consumer \n67. \norganizations,  SWSC  employees,  and  condominiums.  The  results  indicated  that  people\u2019s \npriorities  for  the  Project  included  improving  (i)  hours  and  quality  of  drinking  water  supply, \n(ii) basic  sanitation,  (iii)  service  affordability  for  socially  vulnerable  groups,  and  (iv)  public \nawareness programs and participatory schemes.  \n\n68. \nArmenia\u2019s  social  protection  for  the  poor  includes  a  family  benefit  program  that  assists \nabout 30% people below the poverty line.8 The ongoing meter installation program has enabled \nhouseholds  to  reduce  water  service  expenditure  significantly.  The  affordability  analysis \nundertaken during the TA indicates that expenditure for water is within acceptable international \nstandards of 2\u20135% of household income. Awareness and education programs related to water \nsector  development  issues\u2014such  as  water  conservation,  tariff  increase,  and  promoting  public \nhygiene\u2014will  be  part  of  the  project  implementation.  Social  indicators  (such  as  accessibility  of \nwater supply services to all social groups), gender, and health indicators related to waterborne \ndiseases  will  be  assessed  through  socioeconomic  surveys  and  monitored  annually  as  part  of \nthe PPMS. \n\n                                                 \n7  Republic of Armenia. 2003. Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. Yerevan. \n8  The poverty line was AMD20,289 ($58.7) per person per month at the end of 2005. \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\fGender.  A  large  part  of  the  Project\u2019s  benefits  will  accrue  to  women.  The  Project  will \n69. \naddress  gender  issues  by  (i)  strengthening  the  role  of  women  representatives  in  sector \nmanagement;  (ii)  involving  women\u2019s  groups  in  community-level  project  activities;  (iii)  including \nwomen  from  local  government  institutions  in  training  activities;  (iv)  conducting  community \ntraining  and  mobilization  campaigns  for  project  beneficiaries  in  towns  and  villages  to  ensure \nactive  participation  of  women;  (v)  encouraging  women  to  participate  in  project  implementation \nactivities;  and  (vi)  monitoring  effects  on  women  during  project  implementation  through  the \nmonitoring and evaluation system, in consultation with local governments.  \n\n2. \n\nIndigenous People \n\n70. \nAn  initial  social  assessment  was  carried  out  during  project  processing,  covering  all \npotential subprojects. Detailed socioeconomic evaluation of 125 communities and 16 towns has \nbeen conducted and six consultation meetings were held, including site visits with one town and \nfive communities. Extensive research on the remaining project areas has also been conducted. \nThese consultations confirmed that all people living in the project areas are ethnic Armenian so \nthere is no indigenous peoples\u2019 issue. \n\n3. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n71. \nAn initial resettlement due diligence screening shows that the Project will not have any \nresettlement issues. All possible resettlement needs were assessed in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  were  evaluated  in  terms  of  the  proposed \nconstruction  to  see  if  any  people,  land,  businesses,  crops,  or  other  items  of  value  would  be \naffected  by  the  Project. In  accordance  with  the due  diligence,  all  available  engineering  design \ndocuments were analyzed, community leaders were consulted, site visits were conducted, and \nconstruction  information  was  obtained  from  the  EA  and  IA.  Analysis  of  the  two  candidate \nsubprojects shows that they will not have any land acquisition or resettlement issues because \nall  construction  works  will  be  located  on  property  owned  by  AWSC,  municipal  land,  or  within \nrights-of-way assigned to municipal infrastructure. \n\n72. \nIf resettlement issues arise with future subprojects, the resettlement framework (RF) has \nbeen prepared to guide the PMU during detailed design and subproject implementation. The RF \n(Supplementary  Appendix  J)  contains  arrangements  for  preparing  full  or  short  resettlement \nplans  (RPs)  in  preparation  of  the  loan\u2019s  subprojects,  depending  on  the  significance  of  the \ninvoluntary resettlement impacts. The RF includes (i) project description, with the likely scope, \nextent,  and  magnitude  of  the  resettlement  effects;  (ii)  screening  procedures;  (iii)  resettlement \npolicy  principles  and  eligibility  criteria  that  are  consistent  with  the  policy  and  cover  all \ninvestments,  subprojects,  and  components  under  the  loan;  (iv)  resettlement  entitlements; \n(v) resettlement design criteria; and (vi) administrative, resourcing, and financing arrangements \nfor preparation, approval, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of full or short RPs. It also \nsets  out  provisions  for  strengthening  the  capacity  of  the  relevant  EA,  project  sponsor,  or \nfinancial  intermediary  to  address  resettlement  issues.  AWSC  will  screen  subprojects  before \nsubproject implementation and ensure, if needed, that the RP is prepared before the award of \nthe  civil  works  contracts \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy. \nResettlement implementation will be monitored by AWSC and an independent body.  \n \nC. \n\nInstitutional and Financial Benefits \n\nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \n\n73. \nThe  management  improvement  and  development  component  under  the  Project  and \ncontinued  policy  dialogue  with  SCWS,  AWSC,  and  self-served  communities  will  support \ninstitutional  and  financial  reforms  that  will  provide  a  more  viable  and  sustainable  basis  for \nmanaging and operating the WSS systems. Supplementary Appendix K provides further details. \n \n\n16 \n\n \n\n\fD. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nincluding  border  areas  strategic \n\n74. \nThe  economic  analysis  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nEconomic Analysis of Projects;9 and covers the economic rationale for government intervention, \nand  goals  and  general  design  of  the  water  supply  sector  investment  plan  (Appendix  14).  The \neconomic rationale is sound, based on social responsibility to provide basic social services and \ncontrolling  natural  monopoly  in  drinking  water  supply.  The  goals  of  the  investment  plan  are  to \n(i) meet  targets  for  water  supply  development,  aiming  for  expanded  service  in  both  urban  and \nrural  communities, \nincrease \ncollaboration  between  the  Government  and  the  private  sector;  and  (iii)  improve  the  general \nhealth and well-being of the inhabitants, and increased awareness of the environment/ecology. \nThe  targets  of  the  investment  are  clearly  defined,  legally  established,  and  consistent  with \ngovernment goals for sustainable development in water supply as reflected in the water supply \nand sanitation investment plan covering 2000\u20132012. The plan to meet the targets is based on \nwater  supply  systems  designed  using  least-cost  solutions  to  best  fit  economies  of  scale;  and \nbased on type and availability of water resources, different design technologies, locations, and \nplanning  horizons.  Other  project  goals  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  water  policy  as \nembodied  in  the  Water  Code  include  economic  tools  for  water  resources  management  and \nprotection, cost recovery and sustainability tariffs, conservation and economic use of water, and \nefficient decentralized management. \n\nto  national  security;  (ii) \n\nEconomic  analysis  of  the  two  candidate  subprojects  was  undertaken  as  representative \n75. \nof  the  subprojects  included  in  the  sector  investment  plan.  The  major  economic  benefits \nassumed  are  based  on  resource  cost  savings  from  time  spent  by  households  on  water \ncollection.  Data  on  time  savings  for  water  collection  are  based  on  focus  discussions  with \npotential  beneficiaries  in  the  subproject  communities.  The  discussions  aided  in  eliciting \ninformation on the estimated time spent by household members collecting water from available \nsources, based on distance traveled and the average number of times the activity is performed \neach day. Data on average family income and minimum wages in the locality have been used to \nvalue the cost of the activity. The economic costs, consisting of capital investment and operating \ncosts, have been converted from financial costs using shadow pricing. The conversion factors \napplied  are  based  on  infrastructure  projects  of  similar  scope  in  the  Central  Asian  region.  The \nresults of the analysis show that undertaking the subprojects will result in an economic internal \nrate of return (EIRR) of 25% for Abovyan and 17.3% for Ararat. Tested under adverse economic \nconditions, the subprojects will yield EIRR exceeding the Economic Opportunity Cost of Capital \nat  12%.  The  benefit-cost  ratio  is  1.26  for  the  Abovyan  subproject  and  1.27  for  the  Ararat \nsubproject.  Other  benefits  that  cannot  be  quantified  will  accrue  in  general  terms  to  economic \ndevelopment  of  the  project  areas  as  a  result  of  improved  water  supply  and  sanitation.  These \ninclude  increased  economic  activities  and  output  of  commerce  and  industry,  and  improved \noperations  of  institutions  such  as  schools  and  hospitals  that  require  safe  and  sufficient  water \nsupply.  Economic  benefits  will  likewise  accrue  from,  among  others,  increased  consumer \nsatisfaction; increased health benefits caused by disease prevention and a reduction in mortality \nrate; and increased fire protection, especially in crowded settlements and commercial areas. \n \nE. \n\nFinancial Evaluation \n\n76. \nFinancial analysis for the two subprojects was also undertaken. The analysis was based \non  estimates  using  first  quarter  2007  prices  and  demand  projections  consistent  with  existing \nlevels.  The  project  cost  estimates  and  financial  projections  in  nominal  terms  after  tax  were \nconverted into real terms by adjusting for foreign and domestic inflation and currency fluctuation. \n\n                                                 \n9 ADB. 2007. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\fThe financial internal rate of return for both subprojects is found to be well above the weighted \naverage  cost  of  capital  of  1.58%,  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis.  The  subprojects  are \nconsidered  both  financially  viable  and  sustainable  based  on  tariffs  that  are  affordable  even  to \nrural communities. Sensitivity and risk analyses indicate that the financial internal rate of return \nfor the subprojects is robust under adverse conditions. \n\n77. \nFinancial  projections  were  prepared  for  the  subprojects  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects (footnote 9) of water supply projects (Appendix \n15).  For  these  particular  subprojects,  the  projected  financial  statements  indicate  that  financial \nrevenues will be sufficient to cover O&M costs. As the two subprojects are typical of the other \nsubprojects, in terms of physical characteristics and their intended design scope, the indications \nare that the other subprojects will likewise be viable investments.  \n \nF. \n\nAffordability Analysis and Project Sustainability \n\n78. \nThe subprojects will be prepared through the active participation of target beneficiaries \nfrom the initial stage of planning, design, and construction. Villages that will not join the AWSC \nservice zone will be responsible for O&M of the local schemes. Based on the sample focused \ndiscussions in  the  Ararat  subproject  with  five  villages,  there  is  an  apparent  willingness  among \nthe population to avail of and pay for improved water supplies. In towns and communities that \nare currently under AWSC service jurisdiction and where water service is deficient, willingness \nto  pay  for  improved  water  supply  service  is  high.  The  affordability  analysis  compares  the \naverage  price  of  monthly  water  consumption  to  average  monetary  income  in  areas  classified \n\u201curban\u201d  for  areas  conceived  to  be  under  AWSC  service,  and  \u201crural\u201d  for  areas  outside  AWSC \ncoverage. These values were found to be within acceptable limits of 5% of household income. \nFor  instance,  a  candidate  subproject  in  the  Ararat  region  reflects  revenues  sufficient  to  cover \nO&M costs and depreciation, at affordable tariffs. However, a mechanism for tariff subsidization \nmust  be  established,  especially  in  rural  communities,  in  cases  where  affordability  will  limit \ntechnical  design  options.  The  Government  is  currently  evaluating  various  options  with  the \nassistance of the World Bank. \n  \nG. \n\nRisks \n\nPotential risks associated with the Project include (i) start-up delays caused by AWSC\u2019s \n79. \nunfamiliarity with the use of ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines, (ii) delays in agreed improvements \nto financial and legal reforms, and (iii) lack of community support for the upward adjustment in \ntariff.   \n \n80. \nThe Project includes the following measures to mitigate these risks: (i) during the Loan \nFact-Finding Mission, AWSC was given detailed orientation on ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \nand  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  AWSC  has  initiated  advance  procurement  actions \nunder ADB\u2019s guidance and it will be further trained during the Loan Inception Mission; (ii) ADB\u2019s \npolicy dialogue with the Government has focused on the sector improvements and reforms. To \nensure  its  compliance,  the  Government  will  hold  PGC  meetings  quarterly  to  monitor \nimplementation of these reforms within the agreed time frame. The ADB team will consistently \nfollow up and work closely with the Government on the agreed actions; (iii) the public outreach \nprogram\u2014including  media  campaign,  community  mobilization,  and  public  workshops\u2014will  be \nimplemented  to  achieve  community  awareness  and  ownership  in  service  delivery.  Under  this \nprogram,  beneficiaries  will  be  involved  in  planning,  designing,  implementing,  and  O&M  of  the \nsubprojects. Communities will be educated in proper water and hygiene practices, and in their \nresponsibilities as beneficiaries to pay for the improved services.  \n\n18 \n\n \n\n\fA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  SCWS  have  given  the \n\n81. \nfollowing specific assurances, which are to be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i)  SCWS will ensure that all subprojects to be financed under the Project are selected \n\nas per agreed subproject selection criteria. \n\n(ii)  The  Government  will  ensure  to  provide  AWSC  and  other  service  providers  with \nadequate  enforcement  mechanisms  and  powers  to  effectively  collect  service  fees \nand  penalize  defaulters  of  WSS  bills  in  order  to  improve  the  collection  efficiency, \ndeter nonpayment, and to ensure sustainability of WSS operations. \n\n(iii)  The Government will ensure that (a) a tariff plan is prepared for annual tariff settings \nthat  takes  into  account  the  service  costs  and  inflation  which  is  implemented  by \nJanuary  2009;  and  (b)  a  tariff  is  adopted  in  January  2010  that  fully  covers  the \noperating cost.  \n\n(iv)  The Government will ensure that, to the extent possible, none of the subprojects will \nentail  any  land  acquisition,  conversion,  donation,  or  restrictions  of  access  that  will \ntrigger  ADB's  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  and  that  all  project  facilities  remain, \nand project activities are conducted, within existing rights-of-way. In the event of any \nunforeseen  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  needs,  an  RP  will  be  prepared  and \nimplemented in accordance with applicable laws and regulations of the Government, \nADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy, and the RF. No civil works contract shall be \nawarded until the updated RP, as may be applicable to the subproject, is approved \nby ADB, and no civil works would commence until all compensations are paid and \nentitlements  provided  to  the  affected  persons  in  accordance  with  the  RP,  to  the \nsatisfaction of ADB. \n\n(v)  The Government shall cause the EA to ensure that women participate in the project \ndesign and implementation, through active involvement in monitoring and evaluation \nof  the  project  impact  on  health  and  sanitation.  The  public  awareness  program  will \ntarget  women\u2019s  engagement  as  promoters  in  the  public  awareness  program  on \npublic health, hygiene improvement, and project benefits. \n\n(vi)  SCWS  will    cause  AWSC  to  ensure  that  (a)  all  project  facilities  are  constructed, \noperated,  maintained,  and  monitored  in  conformity  with  all  applicable  laws  and \nregulations, including national and local regulations and standards for environmental \nprotection,  health,  labor,  and  occupational  safety,  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy; \n(b) IEEs are prepared in accordance with the environmental assessment and review \nprocedure agreed with ADB; and ADB\u2019s approval is obtained for IEEs of subprojects \nestimated  to  cost  more  than  $2,000,000  prior  to  award  of  respective  civil  works \ncontracts;  (c)  mitigating  measures  and  monitoring  program  identified  in  the \nenvironmental  management  plans (EMPs)  in  all  IEEs  are  fully  implemented  and  in \nparticular, that all mitigation measures identified in the EMP are incorporated in the \nbidding  documents;  and  (d) implementation  of  the  EMP  and  any  violation  of \nenvironmental standards are reported to ADB semiannually in accordance with the \nspecifications set forth in the IEE. \nIn the event that (a) any change in ownership of any project facility rehabilitated or \nconstructed  under  the  Project,  (b)  any  sale,  transfer,  or  assignment  of  interest  or \ncontrol in any project facility rehabilitated or constructed under the Project, or (c) any \nlease  or  other  contract  or  other  modification  of  SCWS\u2019s  or  AWSC\u2019s  functions  and \nauthority over O&M of any such project facility rehabilitated or constructed under the \n\n(vii) \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\fProject, is anticipated, the Government will obtain ADB's consent at least 6 months \nprior  to  the implementation  of  such a  plan,  and will  ensure  that  any  such  changes \nwill be carried out in a legal and transparent manner. \n\nB. \n\nConditions for Disbursement \n\n82. \nNo  withdrawals  will  be  made  from  the  loan  account  for  civil  works  and  goods  until  the \nGovernment has certified in form and substance satisfactory to ADB that (i) the Subsidiary Loan \nAgreement has been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Government and AWSC and \nhas become fully effective and binding upon the parties thereto; (ii) the Project Implementation \nAgreement  has  been  duly  executed  and  delivered  on  behalf  of  AWSC  and  SCWS  and  has \nbecome  fully  effective  and  binding  upon  the  parties  thereto;  and  (iii)  the  PCU  and  PMU  have \nbeen  established  and  adequately  staffed,  a  qualified  accountant  appointed  to  the  PMU,  and \ninternal PCU and PMU controls, acceptable to ADB, have been established. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n83. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 23,498,000 to the Republic of Armenia for the \nWater  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  an \ninterest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter;  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan and Project \nAgreements presented to the Board.  \n \n84. \nI recommend that the Board approve the proposal set forth in para. 48 of this report that \npipes, pumping equipment, and fittings procured from nonmember countries of ADB be eligible \nfor financing under the Project. If the requisite affirmative votes of directors representing not less \nthan two thirds of the total voting power of ADB member countries, pursuant to Article 14 (ix) of \nthe  Agreement  Establishing \nthis \nrecommendation and the Board only approves the recommendation in para. 83, then only pipes, \npumping  equipment,  and  fittings  procured  from  member  countries  of  ADB  will  be

Consequently, \nthe  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) of water supply and sanitation (WSS) systems throughout the country was \nneglected. Consumers faced serious problems with shortage and poor quality of drinking water, \nand lack of wastewater disposal facilities. In 50 towns and 300 villages, over 60% of the WSS \ninfrastructure  is  in  very  poor  condition  and  about  50%  of  the  water  and  sewer  networks  need \nimmediate  replacement.  Mechanical  and  electrical  equipment  is  obsolete  and  the  system \ndesigns  and  standards  are  outdated.  Sewer  pipes  are  broken  and  clogged,  and  wastewater \ntreatment plants are not operating. Unaccounted-for water ranges from 40% to 90% in various \ntowns and villages, and most people receive water for only 2\u20138 hours per day. Water supply is \nnot adequately disinfected and further pollution risks exist because of infiltration of groundwater \ninto the leak-prone distribution network. About 88% of small rural communities have access to \npiped water systems but only 50% houses have an inside water tap. Similarly, sewer systems, \nseptic  tanks,  and  other  sanitation  facilities  are  broken  and  clogged\u2014creating  serious  health \nrisks and environmental hazards. \n\n2. \nTo  improve  WSS  services,  the  Government  has  implemented  comprehensive  policy, \ninstitutional,  and  sector  reforms  by  strengthening  the  legislative  and  regulatory  framework, \nrestructuring  sector \ninfrastructure \nimprovement. It also approved the following laws: (i) Water Code (the Code), 2002; (ii) National \nWater  Policy  (the  Policy),  2005;  and  (iii)  National  Water  Program  (the  Program),  2006.  These \nlegal instruments provided the foundation for Armenia\u2019s WSS policy. \n\ninstitutions,  and  mobilizing \n\nresources \n\nfinancial \n\nfor \n\nB. \n\nThe Water Code   \n\n3. \nThe main objectives of the Code are (i) the establishment of appropriate water resource \nmanagement  mechanisms;  (ii)  the  conservation  and  protection  of  water  resources  including \nmitigation of pollution and consistent maintenance, and ensuring adequate monitoring of water \nstandards  and  overall  national  water  reserve;  (iii)  to  ensure  adequate  safe  supply  of  drinking \nwater supply and its safe disposal, with regulated tariffs in place; (iv) to ensure efficient O&M of \nWSS  systems;  and  (v)  to  ensure  effective  management  for  systematic  development  and \nprotection of WSS systems.  \n\n4. \nThe  Code  required  the  creation  of  several  important  water  management  bodies, \nincluding  the  (i)  National  Water  Council,  (ii)  Dispute  Resolution  Commission,  (iii)  Water \nResources Management and Protection Body, (iv) Water Basin Management Bodies, (v) Water \nSystems Management Body, (vi) Board to Regulate Water Users Associations and Federation \nof  Water  Users  Associations,  and  (vii)  Regulatory  Commission.  The  Code  sets  out the  duties, \nfunctions, and responsibilities of each body. It also calls for the preparation of the Policy and the \nProgram, and sets out the principal objectives of each. It covers the conditions for the issuance \nand use of water use permits, and the use and management of state-owned water systems. The \nCode establishes the conditions for setting water quality standards and compliance criteria. An \nimportant  provision  of  the  Code  deals  with  economic  incentives,  fees,  and  tariffs  for  WSS \nsystems.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n25 \n\nNational Water Policy  \n\nC. \n \n5. \nThe  main  principles  of  the  Policy  relevant  to  the  WSS  sector  are  (i)  provision  of  safe \ndrinking  water  of  the  required  quantity  and  sanitation  to  meet  the  basic  needs  of  all  the \npopulation,  including  socially  vulnerable  groups;  (ii)  efficient  management  of  water  resources \nand  water  systems  by  the  application  of  water  pricing  criteria;  (iii)  assuring  the  gradual \nintroduction  of  a  24-hour  water  supply;  (iv)  maintaining  sanitary  and  hygienic  standards; \n(v) assuring  water  resources  management  through  \u201cuser  pays\u201d  and  \u201cpolluter  pays\u201d  principles \nand  cost  recovery  approaches;  and  (vi)  managing  water  resources  and  water  systems  in  a \ntransparent and participatory manner, assuring gender policy principles and public participation \nprocesses. \n \nThe  Policy  sets  out  the  principles  for  developing  the  Program.  It  is  envisaged  that  the \n6. \nProgram will present and update annually a detailed proposal for national water resources and \nwater  systems  development  and  management.  The  Program  will  propose  a  short-term \n(5 years), medium-term (10 years), and long-term (15 years) agenda to include all foreseeable \nwater resources and water systems development and management actions.  \n \nD.  \n\nInstitutional Framework \n\n7. \nThe  Code  has  enabled  the  creation  of  a  new  institutional  framework  that  is  being \nimplemented by three agencies. The Ministry of Nature Protection, through its Water Resources \nManagement  Agency,  is  implementing  water  resources  management  and  protection.  The \nMinistry of Territorial Administration, through its State Committee of Water Systems (SCWS), is \nimplementing the management and operation of WSS systems. The Public Services Regulatory \nCommission is an independent body responsible for implementing tariff policy, including setting \ntariffs for different types of water use. \n\nFor  the  WSS  sector,  the  key  agency  is  SCWS.  To  manage  and  administer  the  WSS \n\n8. \nsystems, the following five closed joint stock companies have been created.  \n \n\nfor \n\nis  responsible \n\n(i)  Armenian  Water  and  Sewerage  Company  (AWSC) \n\nthe \nmanagement, operation, maintenance, rehabilitation, improvement, and extension of \nWSS  systems  and  services  in  47  towns  and  more  than  300  villages  in  Armenia. \nSince  October  2004,  AWSC  has  been  managed  and  operated  by  an  international \ncontractor through a management contract, with a life of 4 years until October 2008 \nand  an  option  to  extend  for  a  further  2  years  until  October  2010.  The  private \nmanagement  contractor  undertook  effective  management  measures  that  have \nimproved  the  operational  performance  of  AWSC.  To  date,  the  collection  rate  has \nincreased  from  59.0%  to  82.6%;  the  proportion  of  energy  in  the  operation  costs \ndecreased by 36.2% to 21.5%; metering of connections has increased from 40% to \n71%; and the number of connections has increased from 259,900 to 267,100. \n(ii)  Yerevan  Water  and  Sewerage  Company  (YWSC)  is  responsible  for  the  operation, \nmanagement, and maintenance of WSS services in Yerevan and 33 nearby villages. \nSince 2005, YWSC has been managed and operated by an international contractor \nthrough a lease contract with a life of 10 years until 2015.  \n\n(iii)  Lori  Water  and  Sewerage  Company  (LWSC)  was  established  in  2005  and  is \n\nresponsible for WSS services in Lori region.  \n\n(iv)  Shirak  Water  and  Sewerage  Company  (SWSC)  was  established  in  2005  and  is \n\nresponsible for WSS services in Shirak region. \n\n(v)  Nor Akunq Water and Sewerage Company (NWSC) was established in 2005 and is \n\nresponsible for WSS services in Nora Akunq region. \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nAbout 600 communities throughout Armenia are not covered by the established closed \n\n9. \njoint stock companies and make their own arrangements for WSS services. \n \nE.  \n\nEmerging Policy Issues \n\nBased  on  the  analysis  of  the  Code  and  the  Policy,  and  discussions  with  SCWS  and \n\n10. \nAWSC, the following issues have been identified. \n\n11.  Management.  In  view  of  the  small  size  of  Armenia\u2019s  population,  the  five  closed  joint \nstock companies lose the benefit of economies of scale, and small regional companies are not \nvery  effective  as  operating  costs  are  high  and  local  experience  is  deficient.  Improved \noperational efficiency is considered to be achieved by merging LWSC, SWSC, and NWSC with \nAWSC.  \n \nConsidering  the  ongoing  improvements  in  the  performance  of  WSS  operation  under \n12. \nAWSC,  through  the  management  contractor,  the  current  management  contract  needs  to  be \nextended to 2010 in accordance with the contract option and the company should be prepared \nfor a lease contract which could be awarded in 2010 when the management contract expires. \nThe 10-year lease will allow preparation of AWSC towards concession, if investment is still an \nissue at that time and operator\u2019s view of concession risks improves. \n \n13. \nCommunity-based  water  systems  are  under-resourced  and  poorly  operated  and \nmaintained.  A  local  government  and  community  based  training  program  in  the  operation, \nmanagement,  and  maintenance  of  small,  community-based  water  supply  systems\u2014covering \nsource  protection,  basic  maintenance,  financial  management,  and  administration\u2014should  be \nimplemented to improve operational and maintenance capability and capacity at the local level. \n \n14. \nTariffs.  At  present,  an  inflexible  tariff  structure  applies  a  standard  rate  across  the \ncountry. The cost of supplying water from a source that requires pumping is higher than the cost \nof  supplying  water  by  gravity.  This  cost  difference  is  not  reflected  in  the  tariff,  so  there  is  an \ninternal cross-subsidy as consumers in low production cost areas subsidize consumers in high \nproduction  cost  areas.  In  general,  the  tariffs  are  low  and  the  tariff  structure  is  inadequate. \nFurther,  the  Government  has  to  subsidize  the  revenue  shortfall  because  of  the  low  collection \nefficiency.  There  is  an  urgent  need  to  rationalize  the  existing  tariffs  with  a  adequate  tariff \nstructure for all type of domestic, commercial, and bulk consumers; meter all the connections; \nand  introduce  a  tariff  plan  that  includes  progressive  tariff  revision,  taking  into  account  service \ncost  and  inflation.  This  will  help  ensure  the  sustainability  of  the  overall  WSS  operations.  All \nthese  measures  should  be  linked  with  improved  service  delivery  and  sound  operational \nmanagement to ensure people\u2019s willingness to pay. \n \n15. \nLegal  Framework.  Existing  contracts  between  service  providers  and  municipalities  do \nnot  fully  define  delineation  and  compensation  of  long-term  investments  made  by  service \nproviders  in  assets  leased  from  municipalities.  This  kind  of  legal  deficiency  brings  uncertainty \ninto the service providers\u2019 long-term financial positions and capital budgeting. Further, existing \nlegislation does not grant adequate legal powers to service providers to penalize defaulters of \nWSS bills.  \n \n16. \nCurrent  tax  legislation  is  rigid  and  does  not  allow  service  providers  to  use  rapid \namortization  of  equipment  purchase,  limiting  companies\u2019  ability  to  mobilize  financial  resources \nfor timely asset replacement and capital repair. The Government plans to address these gaps in \nthe near future. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nWATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SECTOR ROAD MAP \n\nBenchmarks  \n\nPast 5 Years \n\nCurrent 2007 \n\nIndicators \n\n2008\u20132012 \n(+5 Years) \n\n2013\u20132017 \n(+10 Years) \n\n2018\u20132022 \n(+15 Years) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA.

All \nof the proposed towns and 145 out of 263 villages are currently served by the Armenian Water \nand  Sewerage  Company  (AWSC);  the  remaining  villages  are  not  covered  by  any  service \nprovider.  \n \nA. \n\nBasic Criteria for Subproject Selection \n\n2. \nConsidering  the  large  number  of  proposed  towns  and  villages,  and  limited  loan \nresources,  the  investment  subprojects  will  be  carried  out  using  the  sector  approach  based  on \nthe following selection criteria:    \n \n\nthe  subproject \ndevelopment objectives, and strategy of WSS system development; \n\nin  conformity  with \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  sector  policies, \n\nis \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nthe  existing  water  supply  network  and  equipment  of  the  subproject  are \ndilapidated, corroded and leaking, and/or sewer pipes are broken and clogged\u2014\nresulting in serious water supply shortages and adverse environmental problems;  \n\nthe  subproject  is  technically  viable,  considering  the  least-cost  and  technically \nsound options, and economically and financially feasible;  \n\nnot \n\nare \n\nthat \n\nvillages \n\ncovered \n\nunder  AWSC, \nlong-term  basis  and \n\nvillage \nfor \nadministration/communities  will,  on  a \nin  a  manner \nacceptable  to  SCWS,  commit  (i)  to  provide  periodic  (at  least  semi-annual) \ninspection  of  the  WSS  system,  water  source  and  catchments,  water  supply \ntreatment,  and  otherwise  comply  with  technical  and  sanitary  requirements  in \naccordance  with  Armenia\u2019s  legislation,  and  (ii)  to  engage  managerial  and \ntechnical  support  and  training  from  AWSC  with  respect  to  operation  and \nmaintenance of WSS system within their responsibility; \n\nthe \n\n(v) \n\nthe subproject complies with Asian Development Bank (ADB) safeguard policies \nand has no significant environmental impacts (i.e., do not fall within category A or \ncategory  B  sensitive  subprojects  according  to  categorization  under  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy [2002]);  \n\n(vi) \n\ncommunities are willing to participate in the subproject planning and design; and \n\n(vii) \n\nthe subproject can be completed within the project implementation period. \n\n \nSubproject Prioritization \n\nB. \n\nFor  proposed  towns  and  villages  presently  covered  by  AWSC,  the  investment \n\n3. \nsubprojects will be prioritized based on the following criteria:  \n \n\nthe  proximity  to  the  existing  water  source  and  distribution  network  supplying \nmultiple communities; and \n\nthe  current  WSS  service  is  characterized  by  (a)  insufficient  quantity  (less  than \n24-hour  service)  because  of  high  technical  losses,  (b)  poor  quality  caused  by  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\ndilapidated  distribution  network  and  equipment,  and  (c)  high  cost  of  alternative \nsupplies.  \n\nFor  communities  not  currently  served  by  any  of  the  existing  WSS  providers,  the \n\n4. \ninvestment subprojects will be prioritized based on the following criteria:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nsafe and affordable alternative water supply is not available and/or the incidence \nof waterborne and related diseases are high; \nexisting water supply facilities or piped water supply system are deficient; \nthe  potential  for  a  water  supply  scheme  that  can  serve  multiple  villages  and \nreliable water sources is available;  \nvillage administration/communities will provide commitment to undertake periodic \n(at  least  semiannual)  inspection  of  the  WSS  system,  water  source  and \ncatchments,  water  supply  treatment,  and  otherwise  comply  with  technical  and \nsanitary requirements in accordance with the Government\u2019s legislation; and \n village administration/communities will arrange managerial and technical support \nand  training  from  AWSC  with  respect  to  operation  and  maintenance  of  WSS \nsystem within its responsibility. \n\n \nSubproject Prioritization for Feasibility Study \n\nC. \n\n4. \nFor proposed towns and villages presently covered by AWSC and prioritized according \nto  criteria  explained  in  section  B,  the  feasibility  studies  will  be  carried  out/prioritized  based  on \n(i) people\u2019s  commitment  to  participate  in  system  planning,  design,  and  implementation;  and  to \npay agreed tariffs for improved services based on the detailed analysis of communities\u2019 demand \nand willingness to pay. Based on the results of these analyses, the communities will provide a \nwritten undertaking through water users\u2019 groups for the payments for improved and sustainable \nservices;  and  (ii)  the  data  on  area  population,  identified  supply  sources  and  their  output  and \ndistance measurements, the health and sanitation situation, and the environmental issues in the \narea have been identified. \n\n5. \nFor communities not currently served by any of the existing WSS providers, the priority \nfor  undertaking  feasibility  studies  will  be  set  based  on  (i)  village  administration/communities\u2019 \nsigning  a  limited  service  agreement  that  will  include  semiannual  inspection  of  the  systems,  \nwater  source  and  catchments,  chlorination,  and  repair  of  WSS  system;  (ii)  presence  of \ncommunity-based organizations that are committed to run the system based on 100% operation \nand  maintenance  costs  to  be  borne  by  the  users;  and  (iii)  village  administration/communities\u2019 \nwillingness  to  receive  training  from  AWSC  in  technical  and  financial  management  including  \noperation and maintenance, and tariff setting and budgeting.    \n\n \n\n \n\n\fProject Stage/Component\n\nActivity\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\nA S O N D J F M A M J J A S O N D

The  Project  is  classified \ncategory  B  under  the  guidelines  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ABD).  According  to  ADB \npolicy  for  category  B  projects,  an  IEE  is  required  as  the  first  stage  in  developing  an \nenvironmental assessment. The Law on Environmental Impact Expertise requires upgrading of \ninfrastructure projects such as this to be subjected to environmental assessment. \n\n2. \nThe  Project  has  taken  a  sector  approach  and  IEEs  have  been  prepared  for  two \ncandidate  subprojects\u2014one  core  town  subproject  located  in  Abovyan  and  five  subproject \nvillages  located  in  the  Ararat  Marz  (province)  for  the  communities  of  Surenavan,  Armash, \nEraskh, Lanjar, and Paruyr Sevak. No significant adverse environmental impacts were noted in \nany of the subprojects analyzed. Minor environmental impacts identified can be readily mitigated \nusing  proven  technology  and  construction  contract  and  management  measures.  The  IEEs  for \nthese subprojects were reviewed by ADB. Implementation of these subprojects will be subject to \nthe  approval  of  these  IEEs  by  the  Ministry  of  Nature  Protection  (MNP).  Based  on  the \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  procedures  (Supplementary  Appendix  H),  which  have \nbeen  prepared \nin  accordance  with  applicable  government  and  ADB  environmental \nrequirements, IEEs will be conducted for the remaining subprojects as part of feasibility studies \nand submitted to the Ministry of Nature Protection for approval before implementation. The IEEs \nfor the first subproject and all subprojects above $2 million will require ADB approval. \n\n \n\nB. \n\nDescription of the Project \n\n3. \nThe  principle  outcome  of  the  Project  is  improved  access  to  safe,  reliable,  and \nsustainable  water  supply  and  sanitation  (WSS)  services.  Project  components  comprise  two \nparts: (i) rehabilitation and extension of distribution systems, and (ii) improvement of sewerage \nsystems.  The  first  part  will  address  rehabilitation  and  replacement  of  the  deteriorated  existing \nwater supply infrastructure. The second part will address improvement of the sewerage system \nby  cleaning  existing  sewers  and  carrying  out  urgent  repairs/replacement  of  damaged  sewers \nthat are polluting water supplies in selected towns and villages. \n\n4. \nLack of water supply is a major problem in the two candidate subprojects, as analyzed \nin Abovyan and the rural communities in Ararat Valley. In Abovyan, 50-year old pipelines are in \ndire  need  of  rehabilitation  and  inoperable  pumps  urgently  need  repair.  Over  70%  of  the  total \nwater  supply  is  lost  through  leakage  caused  by  old  water  supply  infrastructure,  and  the  water \nsupply  is  only  available  intermittently  for  4\u20136  hours  per  day.  Further,  the  rural  communities  of \nSurenavan, Armash, Eraskh, Lanjar, and Paruyr Sevak studied in the IEE analysis have not had \nconstant water supply in more than 15 years since the collapse of the Soviet Union.  \n\n \n\nC. \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\nArmenia  is  a  landlocked  country  in  Asia  Minor  between  the  Black  and  Caspian  seas, \n5. \nbordered by Georgia on the north, Azerbaijan on the east, Iran on the south, and Turkey on the \nwest.  The  subproject  town  of  Abovyan  receives  an  average  of  550  millimeters  (mm)  of \nprecipitation  per  year  and  has  temperatures  ranging  from  \u201310\u02daC  to  25\u02daC.  The  subproject \nvillages  located  in  Ararat  Valley  have  a  dry  (average  of  225  mm  per  year)  and  hot  climate \n(average temperature of 40\u02daC). The mountainous communities located on the border of Armenia \nand Azerbaijan have colder temperatures ranging from \u201316\u02daC to 20\u02daC and average precipitation \nof 600 mm. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n44 \n\n \n\n \n\nSprings  and  groundwater  are  the  primary  sources  for  the  water  supply  systems  in  the \n6. \nproject area. The water supply for Abovyan comes from springs collected in an infiltration gallery \nand supplemented by deep well water. The communities are fed by springs. There is sufficient \nsupply  from  the  proposed  sources  but  the  intermittent  supply  of  electricity,  and  continued \nleaking pipes, cause intermittent water supply to consumers.   \n\n7. \nWith  the  proposed  water  supply  sources,  no  foreseen  water  quality  issues  need  to  be \nmitigated  because  the  water  quality  is  good  or  proposed  treatment  measures  are  to  be  taken \nunder  the  Project.  On-site  wastewater  treatment  facilities,  if  in  place,  lack  maintenance  and \nbasic hygiene requirements. In Abovyan, the sewer lines and sewerage collectors are in need of \nrehabilitation.  Within  the  communities,  there  is  basic  sewage  system  infrastructure  including  a \ncommon septic tank, pipes to discharge wastewater into storm water drains for dilution or open-\npit latrines.  \n\nThe  Project  includes  poor  communities.  In  the  candidate  subproject  communities,      \n\n8. \n75\u201390%  of  families  receive  subsidies  from  the  Government.  Approximately  80\u201390%  of  the \nmembers of the community farm a small number of livestock or produce crops. The towns and \ncommunities have basic schools and limited medical facilities. Overall, populations are stable or \ndecreasing. \n\n9. \nIEE  fieldwork  and  interviews  did  not  reveal  concern  with  vegetation  at  the  subproject \nsites,  as  it  is  of  low  value  and  can  be  regrown  easily.  There  are  no  cultural  archeological  or \nheritage  sites  found  within  the  project  areas,  except  cemeteries.  All  designs  for  subprojects \nalready analyzed have diverted pipelines around cemeteries. \n\nD. \n\nScreening of Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\nIdentified  negative  impacts  during  construction  are  moderate  in  extent  and  can  be \n10. \nmitigated. All potential environmental impacts and  respective mitigation measures are listed in \nTable A12.4. Overall, the most likely impacts and crucial mitigation measures are listed in Table \nA12.1. \n\nTable A12.1: Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\nPotential Environmental Impact \nSource Abstraction Limits \nSource Protection from Contamination \nInvoluntary Resettlement \nTreated Water Quality \nDesign of Water Pipelines \n\nDelivery of Unsafe Water \nIncreased Sewage Generation \nDamage to Soil, Land, Ecology, \nHeritage, Crops and Trees \nConstruction Pollution and Wastes \nOperational Handling of Chlorine and \nHealth and Safety  \n\nMitigation Measure \n\nCalculate flow availability during dry seasons \nCreate buffer zone around source \nFramework has been created to deal with resettlement events \nEnvironmental monitoring plan has been detailed \nWater pipelines must be constructed in higher elevation and separate \ntrenches than wastewater pipelines \nMitigation plan must be implemented (AWSC has experience) \nPerform detailed design calculations for each community \nAvoid environmentally and socially sensitive areas by designing around \nthese locations.

The  organizations  that  will  perform  overall \ncoordination  and  review  relevant  project  documents  include  the  State  Committee  of  Water \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12  45 \n\n \n\n \n\nSystems (SCWS). It will establish the project coordination unit (PCU) and set up an interagency \nproject governing council (PGC) headed by the chair of SCWS, with board members including \nministry representatives and provincial/local board members. ADB will also perform reviews of \nmajor  documents.  Provincial  and  town  or  community  governments  will  be  involved  in  the \nprocess of monitoring at the local level. The Project will not include any category A subprojects, \nbased on the established screening criteria.

Water quality sampling will be conducted four times a year \n12. \n(each season) at the time of discharge, commencing at least 12 months before construction to \nestablish  a  baseline.  The  PMU,  assisted  by  the  environment  specialist,  will  be  responsible  for \nconducting periodic monitoring. During the operation, daily, monthly, or  seasonal water quality \nmonitoring  shall  take  place  depending  on  the  location  (i.e.,  at  the  source  versus  locations \nthroughout the network distribution system).

ADB  also  requires  public  consultation  in  the  environmental  assessment \nprocess.  For  category  B  projects,  the  borrower  must  consult  with  groups  affected  by  the \nproposed  project  and  with  local  nongovernment  organizations.  The  consultation  needs  to  be \ncarried out as early as possible in the project cycle so that views of affected groups are taken \ninto account in the design of the Project and its environmental mitigation measures.  \n\n16. \nFor  the  two  subprojects  analyzed  to  date,  ADB  conducted  six  public  consultations \nincluding  the  subproject  town  and  each  subproject  community  during  April  2007.  The \nconsultations  were  open  community  meetings  at  the  town  halls,  where  attendees  included \nwomen.  Information  on  subproject  design  plans  was  disseminated  via  posters  and  oral \ncommunications.  Overall,  the  populations  wanted  to  participate  in  the  design,  monitoring,  and \nconstruction of the subprojects. Their greatest environmental concerns included the degradation \nof  land,  and  drinking  and  irrigation  water  as  well  as  limited  potable  water  service.  Continuous \npublic consultation with the project-affected communities will be carried out during the detailed \ndesign and implementation period to address their concerns through sustainable designs and by \nkeeping the communities involved at all project stages. \n\n \n\nG. \nConclusions \nThe proposed Project is unlikely to cause any adverse environmental impacts because \n17. \n(i)  potential  negative  impacts  associated  with  the  design,  construction,  and  operation  of  the \nproposed  subproject  activities  are  likely  to  be  temporary  and  localized  in  extent,  and  can  be \nmitigated to acceptable levels using proven technology and management measures; and (ii) an \nenvironmental  management  and  monitoring  plan  was  prepared  to  ensure  environmentally \nsustainable  implementation  of  the  subprojects.  Based  on  the  findings  of  the  two  subproject \nIEEs,  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures,  and  the  subproject  selection \ncriteria for the Project, it is likely that subsequent subproject environmental assessment will not \nwarrant a detailed Environmental Impact Assessment. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nResponsible \nInstitutions \n\n \nPMU \n\nPMU \n\nPMU \n\nPMU \n\nPMU \n\n \n\nProject Activity and \nPotential Impacts \nDesign and Location \nSource Abstraction \n\u2022  Providing sufficient supply  \nSource Protection \n\u2022  Protecting raw water \n\npollution \n\nDamage to Soil, Land, \nEcology, Heritage, Crops, \nand Trees \n\nResettlement \n\u2022  Involuntary resettlement of \nresidents and businesses  \n\nTable 12.4: Summary of Environmental Impacts, Mitigation Measures, and Responsible Institutions \n\nProposed Mitigation Measures \n\n \n\u2022  Perform detailed design to show necessary abstraction limit for communities during dry season  \n\u2022  Undertake confirmatory flow measurements on spring source in two annual dry seasons \n\u2022  Provide a protection buffer zone of at least 100 m upstream of the intake and its immediate catchment, area and \n\nrestrict access.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Republic of Armenia: \n \nThe Project  will benefit a total population of about 576,000 people, of  which 49% lives in regional cities and 51% in \nrural communities, through the provision of clean water and improvement of hygiene and sanitation. The Project will \nsupport poverty reduction by (i) decreasing the incidence of waterborne diseases, costs of medical care, and sick days \ntaken,  thus  reducing  household  health  expenditures;  (ii)  diminishing  the  workload  for  women  in  the  house,  thus \nproviding the opportunity for them to become more involved in social and economic activities; (iii) providing safer and \nmore reliable water supplies; (iv) improving the quality of life of the urban and rural population, particularly the poor, by \nincreasing  their  access  to  safe  drinking  water,  thereby  improving  hygiene  and  sanitation;  and  (v)  providing \nemployment opportunities to the poor. \n \nThe  Project  will  improve  public  health  by  reducing  waterborne  diseases  through  improved  water  supply  and \nwastewater management services. The poor (who are likely to suffer most from incidence of waterborne diseases) and \nwomen  (who  are  often  in  charge  of  collecting  and  storing  drinking  water,  as  well  as  taking  care  of  ill  household \nmembers)  will benefit most from the improvement in increased access and improved  water quality as a result of the \nProject. Health indicators related to waterborne diseases will be monitored annually as part of the project preparatory \nmonitoring system. The Project will also create job opportunities for both skilled and unskilled labor during the project \nimplementation stage. The person-days to be utilized by the Project and possibilities of involving the local workforce \nwill be specified during the detailed design stage.  \n \nThe  priority  of  improving  water  access  and  quality,  especially  in  rural  areas,  is  reflected  in  nationalized  Millennium \nDevelopment Goal (MDG) indicators and the poverty reduction and strategy paper monitoring framework. The Project \nwill  reduce  non-income  poverty  by  improving  living  conditions  and  public  health,  and  improving  the  water  supply  of \n40% of regional urban communities and 26.4% of rural communities in the country. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                         Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention (MDG 7 Target 10) \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nPoverty and social analysis has been an integral part of the project preparation, and has been based on primary and \nsecondary  data  obtained  through  quantitative  and  qualitative  methodologies.  The  poverty  analysis  hinged  on  data \nanalysis  at  the  country  and  region  level,  as  well  as  project  area,  and  involved  household  surveys,  stakeholder \nconsultations through focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and field assessment.  \n \nAs  of  January  2006,  the  total  population  of  Armenia  was  3,219,200  people  (64.1%  urban  and  35.9%  rural).  About \n23.3%  of  the  population  resides  in  the  project  area,  including  386,043  people  from  rural  communities  and \n364,535 from  urban  (regional  cities)  communities.  The  natural  population  growth  rate  in  2005  was  3.5  (per \n1,000 people). The growth rate of the rural population (3.9) exceeds urban population growth (3.2). However, because \nof industrial growth, the internal migration from urban to rural settlements that occurred in the past reversed bringing \nmore  young  labor  force  to  urban  settlements. The  share  of  the  rural  population  remained  stable  compared  to  urban \nareas because of a higher birth rate.  \n \nBy  the  end  of  2005,  29.8%  of  Armenia\u2019s  population  (about  960,000  people)  was  classified  poor  (income  below \nAMD20,289  per  month)  and  4.6%  (150,000  people)  very  poor  (income  below  AMD13,266  per  month).  In  2005,  per \ncapita gross domestic product was estimated at AMD697,400. The poorest section of the population is concentrated in \nregional towns and regions with a predominantly rural population, where economic opportunities are limited and where \nclimatic and geographic conditions are most unfavorable for agricultural activities. Recent poverty data indicates that \nthe gains from high economic growth rates have not been equally distributed among the population or across different \nregions of the country. Growth has mostly benefited the capital, Yerevan, while poverty reduction for people living in \nrural areas and regional cities has been comparatively low. The Government has declared rural poverty reduction, and \nin broader terms regional development, a priority.  \n \nCurrently,  there  are  marked  differences  between  the  quality  of  and  access  to  water  supply  in  urban  and  rural \nsettlements. In 2005, 97.5% of urban and 72.8% of rural households had access to a centralized water supply system. \nHowever,  access  to  a  centralized  water  supply  system  is  not  a  guarantee  of  24-hour  water  supply.  While  the  vast \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 13          49 \n\n \n\nmajority of urban households (about 87%) have indoor water taps, only 51% of rural households have access to home \ntaps. In 2005, 38.9% of households had water 1\u20135 hours a day and only 28.3% of households with a centralized water \nsupply  system  reported  having  water  24  hours  a  day.  The  operating  connection  for  the  rest  of  the  rural  households \nconsists of boreholes and public standpipes.  \n\nLack  or  absence  of  access  to  clean  drinking  water  leads  to  a  number  of  problems,  including:  (i)  negative  impact  on \nhealth\u2014lack of clean drinking water causes major hygiene and sanitation problems and increases risk of waterborne \ndisease;  (ii)  opportunity  cost  (in  money  or  time)\u2014limited  availability  or  absence  of  individual  water  taps  imposes \nsignificant  time  and  money  costs  on  people,  as  they  are  forced  to  collect  water  from  a  suitable  source  or  pay  to \npurchase drinking  water delivered by road tanks. Moreover, people spend 2\u20133 hours per daya collecting and storing \ndrinking  water.  The  burden  of  these  time  costs  often  falls  disproportionately  on  females,  so  a  solution  to  these \nproblems  will  have  gender,  as  well  as  social,  benefits  for  the  communities;  and  (iii)  negative  psychological  and \neconomic development impact\u2014absence or lack of clean water causes low morale and has a negative impact on local \nresidents\u2019 work productivity, since they cannot perform basic person hygiene practices. \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\n   Yes               \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nStakeholder analysis has been conducted during project preparation through public participation and consultation with \nkey stakeholders. The purpose of the stakeholder analysis was to identify their needs, interest, capacity, and level of \ninfluence  in  the  project  design,  implementation,  and  monitoring.  Stakeholder  consultations  and  focus  group \ndiscussions were conducted with 120 people in the subproject town and each subproject community during April\u2013May \n2007. Issues discussed included qualitative aspects of poverty in subproject communities; gender issues; benefits of \nimproved  water  services  (especially  to  the  poor  and  women);  and  willingness  of  involvement  in  design,  monitoring, \nand  evaluation  activities  for  the  Project.  During  these  consultation  exercises,  community  members  also  voiced  their \nkey environmental concerns and ideas on improving sanitation. \n\n   No \n\n \n\nBased  on  the  public  consultations,  focus  group  discussion,  and  rapid  participatory  appraisal,  a  participation  strategy \nhas been developed to (i) promote active participation of the beneficiary and affected population in project planning, \nimplementation,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation;  (ii)  promote  active  participation  of  the  stakeholders  in  the \nimplementation of the capacity building program on the effective management of water resources and water systems \nin the project communities; (iii) enhance project benefits to the beneficiary populations; (iv) obtain their support for the \nProject; and (v) raise their social acceptance of the user fees. \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe poverty and social analysis indicates that women will benefit most from the Project, since most household chores \nare  water-related  and  are  mainly  performed  by  women.  Benefits  resulting  from  access  to  clean  and  stable  water \nsupply and improved water quality, increased health status, and time saving from performing water-related household \nactivities,  will  all  benefit  women  to  a  certain  degree.  The  Project  will  encourage  women  to  participate  in  the  project \ndesign and implementation through active involvement of women in monitoring and evaluation of the project impact on \nhealth,  sanitation,  and  general  living  conditions.  The  public  awareness  program  will  target  women\u2019s  engagement  as \npromoters on public health, hygiene improvement, and project benefits.  \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \n\n    Yes \n\n    No \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\n \nPlan Required \n\n \n \nAppraisal  of  the  core  subprojects  has  not  identified  any \nresettlement \nfor \nsubprojects has been prepared.  \n\nresettlement \n\nissues.

This  impact  is \nconsidered  minimal  compared  to  the  envisaged  social \nbenefits,  such  as  improved  living  conditions,  health,  and \ndecreased  opportunity  costs.  To  protect  the  poor,  the \nGovernment established a social support program for the \nlowest  income  bracket  households  under  the  household \nbenefit  program,  which  provides  social  assistance  by \npaying  monthly  lump  sum  amounts  to  the  most  socially \npolicy \nvulnerable \nrecommendations  are  being  developed  by  the  Armenian \nWater  and  Sewerage  Company  (AWSC)  to  address  the \nproblem of affordability of water use for the extreme poor \nin  communities  served  by  the  company.  It  is  envisaged \nthat these recommendations will be discussed and agreed \nwith the Government in the near future.  \n \n \nThe  Project  will  not  have  any  negative  impact  on  the \nemployees in the project areas.

It assesses the rationale for government intervention in the sector, its capacity to \nexecute the sector investment plan, the plan\u2019s goals, design of the plan, and the implementation \nstrategy. \n \nB. \n\nRationale for Government Intervention \n\n2. \nThe rationale for government intervention results from increasing concern over the poor \ncondition of water supply services in both urban and rural communities\u2014despite the transfer of \nsystems  management  and  operations  to  private  water  providers,  especially  in  urban  centers. \nCurrently,  there  are  five  independent  operators  with  different  types  of  ownership  and \nmanagement.  Yerevan  Water  and  Sewerage  Company  is  a  private  company  that  operates \nunder  a  lease  contract,  and  covers  the  capital  and  adjacent  33  rural  communities.  Armenian \nWater and Sewerage Company (AWSC) is a state company that operates under a management \ncontract  with  a  private  operator,  and  covers  37  towns  and  300  communities.  The  municipal \nenterprises, Lori Water and Sewerage, Shirak Water and Sewerage, and Nor Akunq Water and \nSewerage  are  jointly  owned  by  the  Government  and  respective  municipalities  on  a  49\u201351% \nsharing  basis  and  operate  systems  in  communities  in  their  respective  regions.  Current \noperations  are  continually  plagued  by  high  water  wastage  because  of  deficiencies  in  the \nmetering program, and poor cash position caused by a low collection ratio and low water tariffs \nthat  result  in  low  cost  recovery\u2014leading  to  high  reliance  on  government  subventions,  either \nthrough tax discounts or energy cost subsidy, and measures like partial debt relief. \n \n3. \nThe  problems  are  even  more  pronounced  in  rural  communities  at  marz  (province)  and \nregional  levels.  By  detail,  water  supply  services  in  these  areas  are  under  the  responsibility  of \nlocal  government  or  community  administration.  However,  studies  show  that  (i)  where  such \ncentralized systems exist, services continue to deteriorate because little can be done to improve \nand rehabilitate the systems because of lack of funds; and (ii) other sectors vie for whatever is \navailable. As most of these supply systems are in various stages of deterioration and some are \ndysfunctional, residents are forced to use alternative, unsafe sources of water. Operated by the \nlocal  government  or  the  communities  out  of  their  own  budget  appropriations,  only  2%  of  the \nwater  supply  infrastructure  is  in  good  order,  and  63%  is  of  a  poor  standard  and  continues  to \nprovide unreliable water supply. Although 50% of households have access to direct water taps, \nthe  rest  rely  on  boreholes,  public  standpipes,  and  delivered  water.  The  limited  number  of \nindividual  water  taps,  or  their  unavailability,  imposes  substantial  time  and  money  costs  to \nresidents who on average, spend between one overhaul. Such systems depend on subsidies to \ncover financial needs for large-scale system repair or extension works. Consequently, under the \npresent  institutional  context,  many  local  government  and  community-based  water systems  are \nneither institutionally nor financially independent water operators. Water supply is rationed to a \nfew hours a day and schedules are often not met. \n \n4. \nGovernment  involvement  in  the  investment  plan  is  justified because  there  is  significant \nscope  to  improve  water  supply  in  both  urban  and  rural  communities  through  the  provision  of \nfinancial  and  technical  support  and  institutional  capacity  development  which  only  the \nGovernment can provide effectively at present. Institutional and economic reforms embedded in \nthe  decentralization  efforts  have  yet  to  see  results.  Although  the  Government  transferred  the \nresponsibility of managing and operating water supply services through recent policies, there is \nstill  a  need  for  central  level  management  to  develop  and  address  the  medium-  and  long-term \nneeds  of  the  water  supply  sector  sufficiently.  The  manifold  problems  characterizing  the \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nenterprises  to  supply  service  to  urban  and  rural  communities  still  require  government \nintervention. The Government has taken initial steps to strengthen enterprise service provision \ncapability  through  its  various  legal  issuances.  However,  these  entities  now  require  further \neconomic  support  and  regulation  to  see  through  the  intentions  of  such  transfer.  It  is  also \nincumbent upon the Government to attract further external financial resources to free some of \nits own resources to support related prioritized programs on health improvement, environmental \nprotection,  community  empowerment,  and  sustainable  economic  development  in  the  affected \nareas. \n \nC. \n\nGoals of the Project \n\n5. \nThe goals of the Project are consistent with government economic policy, which ensures \nsustainable growth by improving the public health and environment in project towns and villages  \nthrough focused social infrastructure development and closing the disparity between urban and \nrural communities. Major investment programs have been undertaken and are currently ongoing \nin  the  public  utilities  sector  wherein  the  Government  has  recognized  the  inadequacy  of  water \nsupply  systems  as  well  as  in  the  institutional  settings  in  which  they  operate.  Until  2000,  the \nGovernment  applied  the  state  budget  to  finance  sector  investments  in  the  capital  and  most \nurban towns and cities, while directing the local administration budget toward funding those for \nrural  communities.  Since  then,  it  adopted  the strategy  aimed  to  carry  out  reforms  in  the  water \nsphere, which included measures on institutional, legal, economic, and organizational changes \nin  future  water  resources  management  and  water  economy.  This  led  to  the  adoption  of  the \ndecree  \u201cOn  Concept  of  Reforms  of  Water  Resources  and  Economy\u201d,  2001,  which  opened  the \ndoors for sourcing of internal and external investments to support the plan economically through \nissuance of implementation guidelines. The Water Code, 2002, has brought into legislation the \nfundamental  provisions  for  the  proposed  National  Water  Policy.  The  law,  when  passed,  will \nensure regular updates of water resource assessment, water reserve availability, and projected \ndemand. \n \n6. \nThe goals set out in the development of the proposed Project are directly relevant to the \ninvestment plan and concur with the plan\u2019s goals. By 2012, the Project aims to provide improved \nwater supply service to about 576,000 inhabitants in 16 urban towns and 125 rural communities. \nOf the rural sites, about 60 are situated in remote and border areas and identified by the State \nCommittee  of  Water  Systems  (SCWS)  as  among  those  areas  in  the  country  with  the  lowest \naccess  to  water  supplies.  Most  of  the  rural  communities  targeted  in  the  Project  have  never \nexperienced  piped  water  supply  service.  Scarcity  of  water  resources  in  many  of  these \nsettlements has been given high emphasis in project planning.  \n \n7. \nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  the  promotion  of  water  conservation  and  prevention  of \nwastage  through  the  installation  of  water  meters  and  appropriate  tariff  setting.  Tariffs  will  be \nstructured so that they  are cost-based and acceptable to the consuming public, especially the \npoor  who  make  up  the  majority  even  in  urban-type  settlements.  Tariffs  will  likewise  be  set  to \ncover all operation and maintenance costs and depreciation for rural areas, and debt repayment \nfor  urban  areas.  Consistent  with  decentralization  policies,  selected  subprojects  in  rural \ncommunities will strengthen community ownership of the water supply system, helping improve \nsustainability.  Through  public  outreach  programs  incorporated  in  the  Project,  communities  will \nbe educated in proper water and hygiene practices, and their responsibilities as beneficiaries. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14  53 \n \n\n \n\nD. \n\nSubproject Selection Criteria and Design \n\n8. \nSubprojects  will  be  prioritized,  since  the  size  and  scope  of  the  Project  prevent  all \ninvestments  from  being  undertaken  simultaneously.  The  Government  demonstrates,  through \nSCWS,  its  willingness  and  capability  to  conduct  the  selection  process  by  identifying  towns, \nvillages,  and  communities  that  need  immediate  development  of  their  water  supply  systems. \nSCWS  has  established,  and  agreed  with  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economy  and  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), an initial priority list of 18 towns and 303 villages. The list includes 46 \nvillages  that  (i)  are  not  currently  included  in  the  management  zone  of  the  AWSC,  (ii)  receive \nbulk supply of water from AWSC, and (iii) will be the first priority for project investments in the \nzone not covered by AWSC. \n\n9. \nForemost,  the  selection  will  (i)  directly  address  the  basic  needs  of  the  population  in \nterms  of  drinking  water  supply;  (ii)  reflect  the  water  supply  strategies  set  by  the  Government, \nincluding  health  and  sanitation  and  environmental  concerns;  (iii)  not  be  in  conflict  with  those \nunder  other  projects;  (iv)  be  justified  by  a  feasibility  study  that  covers  technical,  institutional, \neconomic, financial, environmental, and social aspects; (v) adopt the least-cost solution among \navailable  alternatives;  (vi)  be  based  on  the  detailed  analysis  of  demand  and  communities\u2019 \nwillingness  to  pay  for  improved  services;  and  (vii)  be  and  remain  sustainable,  given  proper \nmaintenance.  For  subprojects  covered  by  AWSC  or  any  of  the  other  water  companies,  the \neconomic  criteria  include  a  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  higher  than  the  opportunity \ncost  of  capital,  as  well  as  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  at  least  12%  to  be \ndetermined  through  detailed  feasibility  study.  For  selections  not  covered  by  any  of  the  water \ncompanies,  the  financial  viability  requirement  through  the  FIRR  is  waived,  but  the  minimum \nEIRR must be satisfied. \n\n10. \nA  structured  approach  will  be  adopted  for  the  appraisal  and  approval  of  subprojects \nincluded  in  the  Project.  Subprojects  for  rural  communities  will  be  selected  based  on \nnonavailability of safe and affordable alternative water supply, deficient service where systems \nexist, potential for multiple villages served by a single source, high incidence of waterborne and \nrelated  diseases,  and  willingness  of  inhabitants  to  participate  in  the  Project.  Subprojects  for \nurban  towns  will  be  selected  based  on  proximity  to  the  existing  water  distribution  network, \ndeficient water supply service characterized by insufficient quantity (less than a 24-hour service) \nand poor quality, high cost of alternative supplies, and willingness of inhabitants to participate in \nthe Project and pay for the service. \n\n11. \nThe Project\u2019s selection criteria emphasize inhabitants\u2019 willingness not only to participate \nin  the  Project  but  in  planning  and  design  activities  where  their  participation  is  invaluable.  The \ncriteria  also  require  communities  to  (i)  request  inclusion  in  the  Project  formally  through  their \nlocal administration or village or block representatives, (ii) assist in pre-feasibility data collection, \n(iii) provide support in tariff setting, and (iv) form the village administrations that would manage \nand maintain the installations and payment collection for rural communities.  \n\n12. \nEach  water  supply  system  will  be  designed  at  least  cost,  and  from  several  available \nalternatives  concurred  by  the  beneficiaries,  in  terms  of  location,  planning  horizon,  and \ncomponent  design.  Tariffs  for  each  subproject  will  be  based  on  user  willingness  to  pay  and \naffordability.  To  ensure  greater  sustainability,  the  equity  principle  in  designing  tariffs  will  be \napplied.  Tariffs  will  be  volume-based,  so  metering  is  required.  For  areas  where  only \nrehabilitation is to be carried out, people are already connected. However, meter charges will be \nrecovered in easy installments with the monthly water charges. In the poorest communities, the \nGovernment  agrees  to  subsidize  connection  and  meter  charges.  Market  surveys  will  be \nconducted  during  the  feasibility  stage  to  gather  sufficient  information  in  support  of  detailed \ndemand  analysis  based  on  consumer  willingness  to  connect.  User  willingness  to  connect  will \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nhave strong bearing in the selection of subprojects. The demand analysis will provide sufficient \ninformation  to  determine  incremental  and  non-incremental  usage,  as  well  as  an  estimate  of \ntechnical and nontechnical losses. \n\n13. \nThe availability of local contractors, timely release of counterpart funds, and capacity of \nproject management support and design consultants will all be considered. Technical planning \nand  design  will  be  in  accordance  with  overall  sector  strategies  and  will  not  be  in  conflict  with \nthose applied in other sector development programs. \n \nE. \n\nSubproject Economic Analysis \n\n14. \nAt least two alternatives were assessed for each subproject based on the pre-feasibility \nstudy  options  in  terms  of  demand,  source  type  and  availability,  and  technical  design.  The \noptimum  alternative  per  subproject  has  been  selected  for  economic  evaluation.  Standard \nbenefit-cost analysis following ADB guidelines  has been undertaken to measure the economic \nviability of both subprojects as representative of all the other subprojects for inclusion under the \nProject. \n\n15. \nThe  major  economic  benefits  assumed  for  the  Project  include  cost  savings  on  non-\nincremental  supply  to  connected  and  unconnected  user  households.  The  non-incremental \nbenefits  are  quantified  using  the  resource  cost  savings  approach  for  time  spent  on  water \nin  Abovyan  and  Ararat  sample \ncollection.  Focus  group  discussions  were  conducted \ncommunities,  which  aided  in  eliciting  information  on  the  estimated  time  spent  by  household \nmembers collecting water from available sources, based on distance traveled and the average \nnumber  of  times  the  activity  is  performed  each  day.  Data  on  average  family  income  and \nminimum wages in the locality have been used to value the cost of the activity. The economic \ncosts, consisting of capital investment and operating costs, have been converted from financial \ncosts using shadow pricing. The conversion factors applied are based on infrastructure projects \nof similar scope in the Central Asian region. To calculate the EIRR, only resource cost savings \nwere used. \n\n16. \nBased on the focus group discussions in the two subprojects, over 50% of households \nindicated that 1\u20134 hours are spent each day fetching water from available wells, springs, or the \nclosest open irrigation canals because of the water shortage. In the Abovyan subproject, rural \nhouseholds and those not connected to any piped system spend an average of 1 hour to collect \nwater  daily.  In  the  five  rural  communities  under  the  Ararat  subproject,  households  have  no \naccess  to  piped  water.  Most  of  the  households  spend  an  average  of  2.5\u20133.0  hours  each  day \ncollecting  water.  The  incremental  benefits  of  increased  volume  sales  are  based  on  the \ndifference  between  the  current  level  of  water  usage\u2014at  less  than  9  cubic  meters  (m3)  per \nhousehold  per  month  in  Ararat  communities  and  22  m3  in  Abovyan\u2014and  the  estimated \nincreased consumption as a result of the investments. Detailed demand and willingness to pay \nanalysis was conducted, which indicated high willingness to pay for improved services. Several \ncommunities in the project area are currently paying much higher tariffs for water supply through \npurchase of better quality of water from venders. Selection of future subprojects will be mainly \nbased  on  this  analysis  to  ensure  that  subprojects  are  demand-based  and  will  be  sustainable \nthrough users\u2019 commitment to pay for the improved services.   \n\n17. \nThe  benefit-cost  ratio  (BCR)  and  EIRR  have  been  derived  for  the  representative \nsubprojects.  Generally,  with  average  economic  cost  lower  than  average  economic  price  of \nwater,  the  proposed  Project  is  economically  feasible,  as  this  will  also  result  in  a  BCR  greater \nthan 1.0. For the Abovyan subproject and the five communities in Ararat subproject, the BCR is \nestimated to be over 1.0, averaging 1.26. For the Project as a whole, the BCR is estimated at \n1.26.

The previous section shows that \n19. \nthe  sector  project  is  economically  justified  with  total  expected  benefits  at  AMD42,976  million \noutweighing  total  costs  at  AMD34,132  million,  resulting  in  a  BCR  of  1.26.  The  combined \neconomic  net  present  value  of  benefits  for  the  two  subprojects  amounts  to  almost  AMD580 \nmillion. This would translate to about AMD15,400 per capita for a typical subproject beneficiary. \nApplying this value to the total target project beneficiaries would result in net benefits amounting \nto AMD8,850 million for the Project as a whole. \n\n \n\n20. \nThe Project will also provide indirect economic benefits through training of involved staff \nin technical and financial management, institutional development, and community governance. \nOther benefits that cannot be quantified using currently limited data will accrue in general terms \nto  economic  development  of  the  project  areas  as  a  result  of  improved  water  supply  and \nsanitation.  These  include  increased  economic activities  and  output  of commerce  and  industry, \nand  improved  operations  of  institutions  such  as  schools  and  hospitals  that  require  safe  and \nsufficient  water  supply.  Economic  benefits  will  accrue  from,  among  others:  (i)  increased \nconsumer satisfaction; (ii) increased health benefits from disease prevention and a reduction in \nthe  mortality  rate;  and  (iii)  increased  fire  protection,  especially  in  crowded  settlements  and \ncommercial areas \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nA.  \n\nIntroduction \n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n\n \n\n1. \nThe financial analysis was prepared in accordance with the Guidelines for the Financial \nGovernance  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects  Financed  by  the  Asian  Development \nBank1  and  the  Framework  for  the  Economic  and  Financial  Appraisal  of  Urban  Development \nSector  Projects. 2  The  analysis  determines  the  level  of  cost  recovery  from  users  required  to \ncover  all  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  expenses  and  eventually  capital  to  achieve \nfinancial sustainability. The analysis was done for two representative water supply subprojects: \nAbovyan  subproject,  located  in  Kotayk  Marz,  and  the  subproject  for  five  rural  communities  in \nArarat marz (province). \n\nB. \n\nFinancial Projections \n\n2. \nProjections are based on information in the final pre-feasibility study reports. Projections \nusing  pro  forma  financial  statements  are  in  nominal  terms  and  are  prepared  for  the  period \n2008\u20132025.  Capital  inputs  are  projected  to  commence  in  2008  with  expenditures  for  surveys, \ndetailed  design,  initial  construction,  community  awareness  activities,  and  institutional  support. \nThe subproject is expected to be completed in 2009. Revenue and cost streams for internal rate \nof  return  (IRR)  calculations  are  in  real  terms  and  include  a  residual  value  that  incorporates \nreplacements. \n\n1. \n\nSystem Operation and Maintenance \n\n3. \nThe  areas  covered  under  the  Abovyan  subproject  form  part  of  the  North  East  District \noperations  of  the  Armenian  Water  and  Sewerage  Company  (AWSC).  Management  and \ndevelopment of the subproject will continue to be the responsibility of the district. The physical \nand institutional improvements proposed through the Project are seen to raise the existing level \nof service from one of physical disrepair that led to its very poor financial standing, to one that is \nsustainable and self-sufficient. \n\n4. \nAt  this  stage  in  project  preparation,  implementation  arrangements  for  the  five  Ararat \ncommunities  are  still  under  discussion.  The  most  appropriate  alternative  being  considered  for \nthe  subproject  is  to  delegate  management  and  O&M  of  the  local  water  supply  and  sanitation \n(WSS)  network  to  village  administrations.  A  specially  trained  WSS  specialist  will  undertake \nminor  system  maintenance,  set  and  collect  tariffs,  and  issue  directives  on  improvement  of \nservice delivery. The Project includes training components to develop WSS management skills \nat community level. It is designed so that village administrations will collect payment for services \nrendered. Revenues will essentially be used for system O&M. Any extra cash will be set aside \nfor future replacements and possible service extension. However, not all communities accepted \nthrough the selection process will have the capability to pay for service. In this case, subsidies \nmay be channeled through the community administration to the vulnerable group of users. The \nlevel  and  timing  of  subsidization  will  have  to  be  identified  and  agreed  with  the  source  during \nproject implementation. In the case of the five Ararat communities, subproject tariffs are set so \nthat the source of the subsidy, whether marz or community administration level, can recover its \ninputs when the subproject finally attains financial self-sufficiency. \n\n \n\n2. \n\nCost and Financing \n\n5. \nThe investment cost has two major components: (i) physical infrastructure, consisting of \ncivil  works,  materials  and  equipment,  and  other  development  costs  (including  detailed \n\n                                                 \n1    ADB.  2003.  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects  Financed  by  the \n\nAsian Development Bank. Manila. \n\n2  ADB. 1994. Framework for the Economic and Financial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector Projects. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n57 \n\nengineering, construction supervision, and taxes and duties); and (ii) institutional strengthening, \nconsisting  of  skills  improvement,  public  outreach  program,  and  project  management  support. \nTaxes  and  duties,  and  allowances  for  physical  and  price  contingencies,  are  also  included. \nForeign inflationary allowance is assumed at 2.4% annually; for domestic inflation, 4% in 2008 \nand 3% thereafter. \n\n6. \nO&M costs include expenses for personnel salaries, power and fuel, chemical treatment, \nand  plant  and  equipment  maintenance.  Depreciation  is  assumed  at  2%  for  civil  works \n(calculated on  a  50-year  economic  life  of  components)  and  6.7%  for  materials  and  equipment \n(calculated on  a  15-year  economic life).  Capital  outlays  during  post-construction  are  budgeted \nthrough provision of reserves for replacing fully depreciated assets. Asset replacements are to \nbe financed out of net operating income. Annual domestic inflation is assumed at 4% in 2008, \nand 3% from 2009 onward. \n\n7. \nThe investment will be financed through a mix of ADB loan, estimated at $36 million, or \n80%  of  the  total  capital  investment,  and  government  contribution  at  $9  million,  or  20%  of  the \ntotal  capital  investment.  The  terms  of  the  ADB  loan  to  the  Government  follow  ADB\u2019s  Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  terms  and  include  a  32-year  loan  period  with  a  8-year  grace  period,  and \ninterest  of  1%  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  thereafter.  Any  further  lending  from  the \nGovernment  through  a  subsidiary  agreement  will  be  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as \napplied in the principal agreement between ADB and the Government. The Abovyan subproject \nwill require a total investment of AMD844,604 million. The subproject for five rural communities \nin Ararat will cost AMD611,106 million. \n\n3. \n\nTariffs, Cost Recovery, and Viability Parameters \n\n8. \n \n\nSubproject tariffs are calculated based on the following cost recovery principles: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nall O&M cost recovery from the start of operation; and \nall O&M cost from start of operation and partial recovery of depreciation, during \nthe initial years, graduating into full cost recovery, and where applicable, interest \non loan, in the succeeding years as affordability levels permit. \n\n9. \nTariffs  are  likewise  calculated  so  that  they  remain  within  the  affordability  of  the  low-\nincome  household,  set  at  about  5%  of  average  household  income,  in  both  urban  and  rural \ncommunities.  At  the  projected  tariff  levels,  the  subproject  is  deemed  viable  when  the  IRR  is \nhigher than the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Any subsidy provided to cover direct \nO&M  cost,  depreciation,  and  loan  interest  may  be  recouped  from  the  service  provider  or \ncommunity user group running the subproject when excess cash is available after covering all \nother cash requirements. The priority of recouping subsidy will follow this order: (i) direct O&M \ncost, (ii) depreciation, and (iii) loan interest. \n\n \n\nC. \n\nFinancial Evaluation \n\nProposed Tariffs \n\n1. \n10. \nIn the areas of the Abovyan subproject, households are presently charged AMD140 per \ncubic  meter  (m3).  Water  service  is  2\u20136  hours  on  a  good  day,  with  a  chance  of  being  rationed \nseveral days per week. In the five rural communities in the Ararat subproject, households buy \nwater from tankers or vendors. Average monthly water expenditure for these households could \neasily  reach  AMD2,000\u2013AMD3,000  or  $6\u2013$9.  In  Abovyan,  average  monthly  household \nconsumption  is  about  7  m3,  based  on  individual  metered  connections.  In  the  Ararat \ncommunities,  household  consumption  of  drinking  water  is  2\u20133  m3 per  month.  Water  acquired \nfrom water tankers or vendors is usually for drinking purposes only. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nSince the subproject schemes are designed for metered in-yard connections, the tariffs \n11. \nare  volume-based  and  structured  to  prevent  wastage.  Presently,  in  the  subproject  areas,  no \ndistinction  is  made  on  household  tariffs  as  a  function  of  their  monthly  income.  Therefore,  the \nsame  tariffs  apply  for  the  different  categories  of  users.  However,  in  the  near  future,  when \noperations  will  have  attained  some  financial  stability,  a  distinction  will  have  to  be  made  to \naccount  for  consumption  levels  and  by  consumer  category.  The  structure  should  aim  to \ndifferentiate tariffs so that the poor within the community who have lower disposable income will \nat  least  be  able  to  cover  their  basic  water  needs.  Higher-income  households  that  generally \nrequire more, and consequently incur higher marginal costs, should be made to pay more.  \n\nThe  proposed  average  tariff  for  the  Abovyan  subproject  will  remain  at AMD140  per  m3 \n12. \nfor the initial 2 years of operation. This is the rate approved by the Public Services Regulatory \nCommission  charged  in  the  district  and  other  urban-type  communities.  However,  to  attain \nfinancial  viability  throughout  the  study  period,  a  10%  increase  by  2012  and  a  10%  increase \nevery  5  years  starting  by  2017  are  needed.  At  these  tariffs,  partial  subsidization  is  required, \namounting  to  AMD210  million  by  2012  to  cover  direct  O&M  cost  fully;  and  AMD316  million  by \n2014  to  cover  O&M,  depreciation,  and  loan  interest  fully.

Funding  sources  are  the \nproposed ADB loan at 80% and capital contributions from the Government and/or co-financiers \nat 20%. Long-term inflation is estimated at an average of 2.4% for foreign cost and an average \nof 4.0% for local costs. The rates are computed on an after-tax basis, resulting in the WACC in \nreal terms estimated at 1.58% (Table A15.3). \n\n \nTable A15.3: Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n \n\nInvestment \n(AMD '000) \n\nInvestment \nWeight \n\nCapital Cost \n(%) \n\nParticulars \n\nADB Loan \n\nGrace period \nRegular period \nWACC, nominal after tax \nLess: Foreign inflation rate \nWACC, real \n\nEquity \n\nCurrent interest rate on long-term treasury bonds \nPlus: risk premium \nWACC, nominal \nLess: Domestic inflation rate \nWACC, real \n\n \nADB Loan \nEquity \n\nWACC \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n80% \n20% \n \n\n1.38 \n0.25 \n1.13 \n \n \n \n \n10.00 \n2.00 \n12.00 \n \n \n \n0.00 \n8.00 \n \n\n \n \n \n677,648 \n166,956 \n\nCapital \nCost After \nTaxa\n1.10 \n \n \n1.10 \n2.40 \n0.00 \n \n10.00 \n   2.00 \n 12.00 \n   4.00 \n   8.00 \n \n  0.00 \n   1.58 \n  1.58 \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, WACC = weighted average cost of capital. \na  Applied at 20%. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n\n15. \nBased on the tariff schedules given in Tables A15.1 and A15.2, the two representative \ncore subprojects can attain financially viability, but will require operational subsidies during the \ninitial  years  of  operation.  The  Abovyan  subproject  has  an  IRR  of  7.8%  against  the  WACC  at \n1.58%. The subproject for five rural communities in Ararat will give an IRR of 3.1% at the same \nWACC level.  \n\nSensitivity  tests  were  undertaken  to  determine  the  effects  of  (i)  a  20%  increase  in \n\n16. \ninvestment  cost,  (ii)  a  20%  increase  in  O&M  cost,  (iii)  a  20%  decrease  in  revenue,  and  (iv)  a     \n1-year  delay  in  project  implementation.  In  all  sensitivity  scenarios,  the  FIRR  for  both  the \nAbovyan  and  Ararat  subprojects  exceeds  the  WACC.  The  subprojects  will  cover  the  full  O&M \ncosts from the first year of operation and generate annual surplus sufficient to meet part of the \ndepreciation cost, after which full cost recovery (including loan interest cover) is achievable by \n2015.  Both  subprojects  remain  robust  under  all  adverse  circumstances.

Affordability  analysis  is  conducted  to  ensure  that  the \nproposed  water  tariffs  do  not  exceed  the  prescribed  limit  of  5%  of  the  monthly  household \nincome of potential beneficiaries. To measure affordability, the average monthly water bill is set \nagainst average household income. Based on the planned tariff increases, water bills will be on \naverage  below  5%  of  income  of  average  income  households  in  Abovyan  and  Ararat.

To ensure sustainability, the proposed tariff schedules will have to \nbe followed.

The  timely  infusion  of  subsidies  is  essential  to  operations, \nand will complement subproject efforts to generate sufficient revenue by proper imposition of the \nrequired  tariffs  and  their  regular  collection.  Failure  to  implement  these  fundamental  measures \nwould likely only lead again to the state of physical disrepair and very poor financial condition, \nwhich are familiar characteristics of the water supply sector at present. \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 29 August 2007) \n", "Currency Unit \n", "dram (AMD) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "AMD1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "$0.00297 \nAMD336.50 \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nAWSC \nBCR \nEA \nEBRD \nEIRR \nEMP \nFIRR \nIA \nICB \nIEE \nKfW \nlpcd \nLWSC \nm3\nMDG \nNCB \nNWSC \nO&M \nPCU \nPMU \nPPMS \nPGC \nQCBS \nRF \nRP \nSCWS \nSIEE \nSWSC \nTA \nUFW \nWACC \nWSS \nYWSC \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n  \u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nArmenian Water and Sewerage Company \nbenefit-cost ratio \nexecuting agency \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental management plan \nfinancial internal rate of return \nimplementing agency \ninternational competitive bidding \ninitial environmental examination \nKreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau \nliter per capita per day \nLori Water and Sewerage Company \ncubic meter \nMillennium Development Goal \nnational competitive bidding \nNor Akunq Water and Sewerage Company \noperation and maintenance \nproject coordination unit \nproject management unit \nproject performance management system \nproject governing council \nquality and cost-based selection \nresettlement framework \nresettlement plan \nState Committee of Water Systems \nsummary initial environmental examination \nShirak Water and Sewerage Company \ntechnical assistance \nunaccounted-for water \nweighted average cost of capital \nwater supply and sanitation \nYerevan Water and Sewerage Company \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year of the Government and its agencies ends on 31 December.  \n", "(ii) \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", "L.
