An  environmental  assessment  of  the  policy  matrix  is \navailable as Supplementary Appendix A. \n \nAlthough  annual  economic  growth  in  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic \nRepublic  (Lao  PDR)  has  averaged  nearly  6%  in  recent  years, \ncontributing  to  a  reduction  in  the  poverty  rate  from  45%  in  1992/93  to \n32%  in  2002/03,  this  growth  has  been  unevenly  distributed.  Rural \ninhabitants comprise 72% of the total population, but about 90% of the \ncountry\u2019s  poor  live  in  rural  areas.  Maintaining  high  growth  rates  in  the \nrural  sector  will  be  a  critical  factor  in  achieving  the  Government\u2019s \ndevelopment and poverty reduction goals. \n \nA  dynamic  rural  economy  requires  sustainable,  market-oriented  rural \nand  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs)  that  can  intermediate  between \nsavers  and  borrowers,  efficiently  allocate  resources,  and  facilitate \nproduction  and  the  exchange  of  goods  and  services.  However,  the \noutreach  of  formal  financial  services  remains  extremely  low.  Per  its \nrecords,  the  Agriculture  Promotion  Bank  (APB)  provides  credit  and \nsavings services to about 120,000 (or 14%) of the country\u2019s estimated \n900,000  households.  However,  a  survey  of  1,189  households  done  in \nearly  2004  indicated  that  only  1.95%  had  borrowed  from  APB  in  the \nprevious  12  months,  confirming  that  the  bulk  of  APB\u2019s  current  clients \nare  urban.  MFIs  are  virtually  nonexistent,  and  the  four  largest  reach \nonly  6,000  clients  collectively.  Savings  mobilization  is  also  low.  Less \nthan  15%  of  households  have  a  savings  account  in  the  formal  sector, \nand  over  90%  of  savings  in  formal  financial  institutions  are  held  by \nurban clients. \n \nAlthough  the  Lao  PDR  faces  special  challenges  due  to  its  dispersed \npopulation and limited infrastructure, which adds to the cost of financial \nintermediation, institutional weaknesses and Government policies have \ncontributed to low outreach of the sector. APB has primarily channeled \nGovernment  and  aid  funds  to  targeted  clients  at  subsidized  interest \nrates. Management autonomy and responsibility have been limited, and \nAPB\u2019s financial performance has been poor. APB\u2019s outreach has been \nlimited  because  its  losses  have  prevented  it  from  building  up  its  own \ncapital,  Government  and  aid  financing  are  limited,  and  APB\u2019s  weak \nfinancial condition has prevented it from mobilizing commercial funding. \nAPB\u2019s  subsidized  interest  rates  have  also  crowded  out  MFIs  and \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\f \nProgram Loan \nObjective \n\n \nComponents and \nOutputs \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nProgram Period and \nTranching \n\niv \n\n \n\n \n\nreducing \n\ncontributed  to  unrealistic  expectations  regarding  sustainable,  market \ninterest  rates.  Moreover,  the  lack  of  a  clear  and  supportive  legal  and \nregulatory framework has discouraged many microfinance practitioners \nfrom  investing  in  the  sector.  Policy  and  institutional  reforms  will  be \nnecessary for rural and microfinance to achieve its potential to catalyze \ngrowth and reduce poverty in the Lao PDR. \n \nThe goal of the Rural Finance Sector Development Program (RFSDP) \nis to assist the Government to reduce poverty and promote sustainable \neconomic  growth  in  rural  areas.  RFSDP  will  contribute  to  this  goal  by \nachieving  its  objective  to  promote  a  sustainable  and  market-oriented \nrural and microfinance sector. It will assist the Government to improve \ntransaction  costs \nincluding \nthe  sector\u2019s  performance, \nassociated  with  delivery  of  financial  services,  and  thereby  increase \nsustained  access  to  financial  services  by  the  rural  poor  and  micro, \nsmall,  and  medium-size  enterprises.  Rural  finance  clients  will  have \nopportunities  to  increase  incomes  and  employment  and  improve  their \nquality  of  life  through  access  to  strengthened,  sustainable,  and  more \nresponsive rural and microfinance services that support investment and \nproduction.  The  increased  access  to  capital  will  encourage  farmers, \nnonfarm rural households, and agribusinesses to invest and create job \nopportunities. \n \nThe program loan has four components: (i) creating an enabling policy \nframework  for  public  and  private  provision  of  rural  and  microfinance \nservices;  (ii)  creating  a  sound  prudential  regulatory  and  supervisory \nenvironment  for  public  and  private  rural  and  microfinance  institutions; \n(iii) transforming APB into a financially self-sustainable, market-oriented \nrural  finance  institution;  and  (iv)  creating  a  supportive  nonprudential \nregulatory  environment  for  rural  and  microfinance.  Specific  policy \nmeasures and outputs will include adoption of a new national policy for \nthe  rural  finance  sector;  reforms  in  APB  to  transform  it  into  a \nsustainable,  market-oriented  rural  finance  institution,  including  greater \ntransparency,  improved  governance,  and  phasing  out  policy  lending; \nperformance-based  recapitalization  of  APB;  an  improved  supervision \nregime for APB; and enabling, best-practice regulations for MFIs. \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  a  loan  of  $7.684 \nmillion equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance \nthe  Program.  The  loan  will  have  a  repayment  period  of  24  years, \nincluding a grace period of 8  years. An interest rate of 1%  per annum \nwill be charged during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n \nThe proposed program loan will be released in three tranches. The first \ntranche of $2.7 million equivalent will be released on loan effectiveness; \nthe second tranche of $2.5 million equivalent about 15 months after the \nfirst  tranche;  and  the  third  tranche  of  $2.484  million  equivalent  about \n18 months  after  the  second  tranche,  subject  to  compliance  with  the \nconditions for their release. \n \n \n\n\fv \n\nresponsible \n\nThe  Bank  of  Lao  PDR  (BOL)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the \nRFSDP and will oversee compliance with the reform program. BOL will \nimplement  the  program  components  that  fall  within  its  responsibility. \nAPB  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  (IA)  for  its  program  component. \nfor \nOther  ministries,  committees,  and  agencies \nimplementing  of  nonprudential  reforms  will  be  IAs  for  their  policy \nmeasures. \n \nThe  project  loan\u2019s  objective  is  to  promote  a  sustainable  and  market-\noriented  rural  and  microfinance  sector.  It  will  (i)  build  BOL\u2019s  MFI \nsupervision capacity; (ii) build capacity in APB in the areas of credit and \nrisk  management,  accounting,  and  management  information  system \n(MIS) in support of implementing its restructuring plan; and (iii) upgrade \nAPB\u2019s information and communications technology (ICT) system. \n \nADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  $2.316  million  equivalent  from  its  Special \nFunds resources, with a maturity of 32 years including a grace period of \n8  years.  The  annual  interest  charge  will  be  1.0%  during  the  grace \nperiod and 1.5% thereafter. The Financial Sector Reform Strengthening \nInitiative  (FIRST)  will  provide  parallel  cofinancing  of  $281,000  on  a \ngrant basis for the BOL MFI supervision component. \n \nBOL  will  oversee  and  coordinate  project  implementation  and  will \nimplement  the  MFI  supervision  component.  APB  will  be  the  IA  for  the \nAPB restructuring and ICT upgrading components. \n \nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  financed  by  the  ADB  loan  will  be \nsubject \nthe  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines. \nDisbursement  procedures  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Handbook \non Loan Disbursements.  \n \nConsultants  to  be  financed  from  the  proceeds  of  the  ADB  loan  will  be \nthe  Use  of \nrecruited \nConsultants  and  following  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nmethod.  A  total  of  42  person-months  of  ADB-financed  international \nconsulting  services  and  72  person-months  of  domestic  consulting \nservices  will  be  required  under  the  project.  An  additional  12  person-\nmonths of international consulting services for the BOL MFI supervision \ncomponent will be financed by FIRST on a parallel grant basis and will \nfollow FIRST\u2019s guidelines. \n \nIn  association  with  the  project,  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction \n(JFPR) approved a grant of $1.98 million for Catalyzing Microfinance for \nthe  Poor.  The  JFPR  grant  will  create  a  microfinance  fund  (MFF)  and \nestablish  and  build  capacity  in  a  Microfinance  Fund  Management  Unit \n(MFFMU)  to  make  matching  grants  for  seed  capital,  equipment,  and \ncapacity  building  in  new  and  young  MFIs  that  focus  on  sustainability \nand  poverty  reduction.  The  project  will  also  disseminate  microfinance \nbest practice through workshops and training for MFI practitioners and \nGovernment  officials.  Consulting  services \n(46  person-months \ninternational and 53 domestic) will be required. \n\nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on \n\nto \n\nExecuting Agency \nand Implementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProject Loan \nObjective and \nComponents \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nExecuting Agency \nand Implementation \nArrangements \n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting  \nServices \n\n \nJFPR Grant \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \nJFICT Grant \n\n \nBenefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nSocial and \nEnvironmental \nIssues \n\n \n\n \nIn  association  with  the  project,  the  Japan  Fund  for  Information  and \nCommunications Technology (JFICT) approved a grant of $472,000 for \nupgrading ICT and MIS at the APB. The JFICT grant will assist APB to \n(i)  upgrade  its  ICT  human  resources\u2019  capacity  to  manage  the  ICT \nsystems  upgrade;  (ii)  review  and  confirm  the  systems  specifications; \n(iii) plan and execute the bidding, selection, and contracting processes \nwith  the  turnkey  contractor;  (iv)  monitor  the  turnkey  installation; \n(v) prepare  and  carry  out  a  training  plan;  (vi)  review  and  evaluate  the \neffectiveness  of  technical  and  operational  training  provided  under  the \nturnkey contract; and (vii) plan and implement the rollout of systems to \nthe  whole  APB  branch  network.  Consulting  services  of  11  person-\nmonths (5 international and 6 domestic) will be required. \n \nAt  a  macroeconomic  level,  the  Program  will  result  in  a  deepened \nfinancial  sector  and  greater  financial  intermediation  that  will,  in  turn, \nresult  in  a  more  efficient  allocation  of  resources.  The  phasing  out  of \npolicy  lending  from  APB  will  enable  the  Government  to  realize  much-\nneeded budgetary savings; and the transfer of residual policy lending, if \nany,  to  an  on-budget  mechanism  will  increase  transparency  and \nimprove monitoring, thus enabling the Government to better assess the \ncosts and benefits of such lending. Indirectly, the stimulus to enterprise \ncreated  through  enhanced  outreach  of  credit  will  result  in  increased \ninvestment  and  job  creation.  The  increased  outreach  of  savings \nservices will encourage monetization. \n \nMicrofinance providers and sponsors will benefit from the Government\u2019s \nadoption  of  an  enabling  and  transparent  regulatory  and  supervisory \nregime.  The  formalization  of  the  microfinance  sector  will  act  as  a \nstimulus to private investment in the sector. \n \nFarmers,  other  rural  inhabitants,  and  rural  enterprises  will benefit  from \nimproved  access  to  credit  and  savings  services.  Income  benefits  will \naccrue \nintensification  and  expansion  of  production  and \nacquisition  of  new  technology.  Business  start-up  and  expansion  will \nlead to job creation, for both the self-employed and wage earners. \n \nThe  RFSDP  will  strengthen  the  rural  finance  sector  and  promote \nsustainable  delivery  of  financial  services  in  rural  areas.  The  improved \npolicy  and  regulatory  environment  supporting  rural  and  microfinance \ninstitutions will promote the establishment and operations of sustainable \nmicrofinance  and  other  rural  financial  institutions,  including  those \nestablished  by  the  private  sector  and  international  development \nagencies.  These  institutions  will  provide  the  rural  poor  with  alternative \nand  more  affordable  options  compared  with  informal  sources,  which \noften  charge  monthly  interest  rates  of  10%  or  higher.  The  RFSDP  will \nfoster demand-driven, sustainable rural financial services. International \nexperience shows that the poor are willing to pay market interest rates \nand value-sustained access more than a subsidized interest rate. \n \n \n\nthrough \n\n\fvii \n\nin \n\nterms  of  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \n\nRestructuring  APB  will  have  both  direct  and  indirect  positive  social \nbenefits.  Directly,  APB\u2019s  transformation  will  enable  it  to  increase \noutreach  and  contribute  to  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  in \nthe  Lao  PDR.  International  and  Lao  experience  have  shown  that  the \nnon-poor are the primary beneficiaries of subsidized credit. APB\u2019s non-\nsubsidized,  demand-driven  expansion  is  therefore  expected  to  benefit \nthe poor disproportionately. Indirectly, phasing out directed lending and \ninterest  rate  subsidies  from  APB  will  free  up  scarce  resources  in  the \nGovernment  budget,  which  can  contribute  to  better-targeted  poverty \ninterventions and reductions in the Government deficit, thus contributing \nto macroeconomic stability. If residual policy lending is shifted to an on-\nbudget  nonbanking  mechanism,  the  enhanced  transparency  will  allow \npolicy makers to better assess the costs and benefits of such lending. \n \nBased on the poverty and social impact assessment, no persons will be \nnegatively  affected \nInvoluntary \nResettlement  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  People.  The  review  of \nenvironmental  impacts  of  the  policy  interventions  under  RFSDP \nindicates  that  the  interventions  will  not  have  any  direct  adverse \nenvironmental impact. \n \nThe  lack  of  sustained  Government  commitment  to  a  market-oriented \nrural finance sector is a significant risk, as is the possibility of delays in \nimplementation.  The  Government\u2019s  repeated  commitment  in  several \nkey  policy  and  strategy  documents  in  the  past  2  years  mitigates  this \nrisk,  as  do  ongoing  policy  dialogue,  stakeholder  coordination,  and \ncapacity-building support that is built into the program. \n \nAPB  may  remain  vulnerable  to  loan  losses  as  it  undergoes  its \nrestructuring.  Safeguards  against  poor  performance \ninclude \n(i) performance-based  recapitalization;  (ii)  strictly  enforced  adherence \nto  the  APB  governance  agreement  and  sanctions  for  noncompliance; \n(iii)  strengthened  supervisory  regime  for  APB;  (iv)  tightening  of  credit \nstandards  and  more  rigorous  credit  appraisal  through  improved  credit \npolicies  and  procedures  and  application  of  ICT  for  improving  risk \nmanagement;  and  (v)  investment  in  capacity  building  for  adoption  of \nbest practices. \n \nThe  estimated  cost  of  implementing  the  Program  is  $19.2  million, \nincluding  the  direct  costs  of  policy  reforms  and  related  investments. \nThis  cost  is  a  potential  burden  to  the  Government\u2019s  budgetary \nresources and management capacity. However, a number of mitigating \nmeasures  have  been  put  in  place  to  reduce  this  risk.  In  terms  of \nbudgetary  resources,  grant  cofinancing  amounting  to  $6.5  million  from \nvarious sources has been mobilized to assist in financing the Program. \nThe Government will finance $12.7 million, of which $10 million will be \ncovered by the ADB program and project loans. Much of the remaining \n$2.7  million \nthe \nGovernment,  such  as  staff  time.  To  mitigate  the  risks  of  fiscal \nmanagement,  several  aid  agencies, \nInternational \nMonetary  Fund  (IMF),  World  Bank,  United  Nations  Development \n\nin-kind  contributions \n\nincluding  ADB, \n\nform  of \n\ntakes \n\nfrom \n\nthe \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating \nMeasures \n\n \n\n\fProgramme  (UNDP),  and  Swedish  International  Development  Agency \n(Sida)  have  been  and  are  supporting  the  Government  in  improving  its \nfinancial management.  \n \nA major constraint to private participation in the rural and microfinance \nsector  has  been  the  unclear  and  adverse  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory \nframework. While the framework will be improved substantially, private \ninvestors  may  still  take  a  \u201cwait  and  see\u201d  approach  to  assess  the \nGovernment\u2019s  commitment  to  effective  implementation  of  the  new \nframework. The RFSDP has put in place two mitigating measures. First, \npolicy  dialogue,  stakeholder  coordination,  and  public  awareness \ncampaigns will provide forums through which investor concerns can be \naired  and  addressed.  Second,  MFF  financed  by  the  JFPR  grant  will \ndirectly  catalyze  investment  in  the  sector  by  providing  TA  and  start-up \ngrants to MFIs that demonstrate a commitment to sustainable provision \nof microfinance services to the poor. \n \nTA will assist BOL and  APB to implement key  aspects of the program \nand  to  build  APB\u2019s  human  resources  capacity.  The  TA  will  help \n(i) coordinate  and  integrate  rural  and  microfinance  policy  reforms  and \nprogram  implementation;  (ii)  carry  through  the policy  lending  phaseout \nplan  and  performance-based  recapitalization  of  APB  to  ensure  its  full \ntransition \nto  commercially  oriented  operations  within  3  years; \n(iii) formulate  and  document  a  simplified  mechanism,  policies,  and \nprocedures for residual on-budget policy lending; and (iv) assist APB to \nbuild  capacity \nInternational \nconsulting services of 16 person-months will be required.

The Lao PDR\u2019s human development index rank (135 out \nof  175)  is  among  the  lowest  in  Asia.  Annual  economic  growth  has  averaged  5.7%  in  recent \nyears, contributing to a reduction in the poverty rate from 45% in 1992/93 to 39% in 1997/98 and \nto about 32% in 2002/03.1 However, growth has been unevenly distributed. The lowest income \nquintile accounted for only 8% of total consumption in 1997/98, compared with 9.3% in 1992/93. \nIn contrast, the highest quintile accounted for 44.4% of total consumption in 1997/98, compared \nwith 38.4% in 1992/93. During this period, the Gini coefficient rose from 28.6 to 35.7. While this \ncoefficient  is  low  relative  to  other  countries  in  the  region,  its  rise  indicates  that  the  benefits  of \neconomic  growth  accrued  more  to  the  non-poor  than  to  the  poor.  Correspondingly,  during  this \nperiod,  real  per  capita  consumption  in  the  rural  areas  increased  by  5.4%  per  year  while  urban \nconsumption  increased  by  9%.  As  a  result,  poverty  also  declined  more  rapidly  in  urban  areas, \nleading  to  a  rising  disparity  between  urban  and  rural  incomes.  However,  results  from  the  Lao \nExpenditure  and  Consumption  Survey  (LECS)  III  indicate  a  reversal  in  this  trend\u2014the  drop  in \npoverty between 1997/98 and 2002/03 has been largely attributed to the decline in the number of \nrural poor. In 1997, rural poverty was estimated as 50 % higher than in urban areas. As of 2003, \nthe incidence of rural poverty was estimated as 30% more than urban poverty.2  \n \n3. \nEconomic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  have  been  hindered  by  occasional  bouts  of \nmacroeconomic instability. The Lao PDR began its transition to a market economy in 1986 with \nthe adoption of the New Economic Mechanism, under which the Government pursued a number \nof  important  reforms,  such  as  (i)  redefining  and  limiting  the  role  of  the  state  in  allocating \nresources, (ii) liberalizing prices and trade, (iii) introducing business legislation, (iv) transferring \nagriculture  production  to  private  households,  (v)  privatizing  some  state-owned  enterprises,  and \n(vi) establishing a two-tiered banking system. The reforms had a strong impact on the economy, \nand growth averaged over 6% in the initial years of the transition. Beginning in 1997, following \nthe  Asian  financial  crisis,  the  Government  pursued  an  expansionary  fiscal  policy  financed  by \ncentral bank credit. As a result, inflation increased to 130% in 1999, the kip depreciated sharply, \nand  losses  accumulated  in  the  banks  and  enterprises.  The  authorities  began  a  stabilization \nprogram  in  1999  and,  over  the  next  18  months,  re-established  a  stable  macroeconomic \n\n                                                 \n1   Lao  Expenditure  and  Consumption  Surveys  (LECS)  I  (1992/93),  II  (1997/98),  and  preliminary  results  of  LECS  III \n\n(2002/03). Poverty analysis of LECS III is forthcoming. \n\n2   World Bank. 2003. Lao PDR Country Brief. Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n\fframework.  Since  2000,  the  Government\u2019s  macroeconomic  management  has  been  generally \nsuccessful,  although  the  tenuous  fiscal  situation  has  kept  the  macroeconomic  situation  fragile. \nFrom mid-2002 to May 2003, inflation again rose (to 18% by May 2003), and the exchange rate \ndepreciated  due  to  fiscal  weaknesses.  However,  tighter  fiscal  control  has  stabilized  the \nexchange rate for the past year, and inflation declined to 6.5%.  \n \n4. \nIn this context, the National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES), adopted \nby the National Assembly in October 2003, emphasizes the promotion of sustainable, equitable \ngrowth to improve the quality of life and to eradicate basic poverty. NGPES stresses that socio-\neconomic development must be based on sound macroeconomic management and institutional \nstrengthening  and  balanced  between  economic  growth,  sociocultural  development,  and \nenvironmental preservation. The long-term objective is to sustain economic growth at an average \nrate of about 7%, considered to be the necessary rate for tripling per- capita income by 2020 and \nenabling the Lao PDR to graduate from the list of least developed countries. Development of a \nsustainable,  market-oriented  rural  finance  sector  is  identified  as  a  key  element  to  support  the \nNGPES. \n \n5. \nPoverty  in  Rural  Areas.  The  rural  population comprises  72%  of  the  total  population  of \n5.5  million,  and  80%  of  the  workforce  are  engaged  in  agriculture.3  The  contribution  of  the \nagriculture  sector  to  the  national  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  is  51%,  while  in  the  northern \nregion,  agriculture  accounts  for  more  than  70%  of  GDP.4  Annual  output  varies  because  the \ncountry  is  dependent  on  rain-fed  agriculture.  While  overall  the  country  is  self-sufficient  in  food, \nsome remote areas still face seasonal food shortages. \n \nWhile rural poverty may have declined, some 90% of the country\u2019s poor continue to live in \n6. \nrural  areas.  Poverty  is  more  prevalent  in  the  remoter  and  more  mountainous  areas,  where \naccess  to  fertile  land,  basic  social  services,  transport,  and  communications  is  limited.5  The \nnorthern region has the highest incidence of poverty, estimated at 52.5% in 1997/98. Of the 72 \ndistricts  designated  as  very  poor,  40  are  in  the  northern  region.  Two  northern  provinces, \nOudomxay  and  Huaphanh,  have  a  poverty  incidence  of  over  70%,  and  there  are  28  districts \nnationally, all in remote rural areas, where poverty incidence is over 70%. Annually, some 90,000 \npeople  enter  the  labor  force,  mostly  in  rural  areas,  for  whom  employment  opportunities  are \nneeded.6  Maintaining  high  growth  rates  in  the  rural  sector  will  be  critical  in  achieving  the \nGovernment\u2019s development and poverty reduction goals.  \n \n7. \nDemand for Rural Finance. The Government\u2019s definitions of rural and microfinance are \nsimilar  to  those  of  ADB.  Per  the  Government\u2019s  Policy  Statement  for  the  Development  of \nSustainable Rural and Micro Finance Sector, issued by the Prime Minister\u2019s Office in November \n2003,  microfinance  \u201cmeans  the  provision  of  a  broad  range  of  financial  services,  such  as  cash \nbased  credit,  deposits,  insurance,  etc.,  to  the  poor,  low-income  households,  and  their  micro-\nenterprises,\u201d and rural finance \u201cmeans the provision of a broad range of financial services, such \nas cash based credit, deposits, insurance, etc, to people and enterprises located in rural areas.\u201d \nIn  the  context  of  the  Lao  PDR\u2019s  predominantly  rural  and  agriculture-based  economy, \nmicrofinance will generally (though not exclusively) be a subset of rural finance. \n \n\n                                                 \n3   World Bank. 2003.

Washington, DC. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nA  survey  of  1,189  households  carried  out  in  early  2004  indicates  that  the  demand  for \n8. \nrural  financial  services  in  the  Lao  PDR  is  significant.  The  demand  is  high  for  credit  to  support \nagricultural  production,  livestock  raising,  nonfarm  income-generating  activities  (including  micro, \nsmall,  and  medium-size  agribusiness),  and  household  consumption;  and  for  secure  savings \nfacilities.  The  market  is  segmented  in  terms  of  income-generating  activities  common  under \ndifferent agricultural systems practiced. Four farming systems predominate: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nFlatland  rain-fed  and  irrigated  farming  systems  are  found  close  to  the  Mekong \nRiver  and  its  tributaries.  In  these  areas,  cultivated  land  is  used  for  lowland  rice \nproduction in the wet season and for livestock grazing in the dry season.  \nThe  plateau  farming  system  is  found  on  the  Bolovens  plateau  (Attapeu, \nChampasack,  and  Sekong  provinces)  and  in  two  other  plateau  areas  in \nKhammuane  and  Xiengkhuang  provinces.  Under  this  system,  commercial  crops \nare increasingly produced, and cattle are grazed on the plains and in the forests.  \nUpland  farming  systems  are  characterized  by  slash-and-burn  practices,  and  are \ndominated  by  a  single  wet  season  crop,  mainly  upland  rice.  Cattle,  pigs,  and \npoultry are raised under extensive husbandry systems.  \nThe  mountain  farming  system  operates  in  remote  villages.  The  system  is  also \nbased on slash-and-burn cultivation of upland rice on mountain slopes, with little \nor  no  production  surplus.  A  variety  of  other  crops  are  incorporated  into  the \nsystem, and livestock are more intensively managed than other systems.  \n\n \n9. \nHouseholds practicing these four farming systems reported borrowing for agriculture and \nother  activities  that  are  prevalent  in  their  systems.  The  survey  found  that  48%  of  households \nborrowed from at least one source in the 12 months before the survey. Reported unmet demand \nwas  also  high,  with  many  households  reporting  an  inability  to  borrow  sufficiently  for  common \nactivities in their farming systems\u2014unmet demand by rural households of KN32 trillion was four \ntimes  as  large  as  actual  borrowing  of  KN800  billion.  The  highest  level  of  reported  unmet \ndemand\u201335%  of  households\u2013occurred  in  remote  rural  areas,  followed  by  households  in \nprovincial  capitals  (34%),  households  in  peri-urban  areas  (23%),  and  households  in  the  rural \nMekong  area  (11%).7  Overall,  27%  of  households  reported  unmet  credit  demand  in  the  12 \nmonths  before  the  survey.  The  most  commonly  cited  activities  for  which  financing  was \ninadequate were rice production, animal raising, trade, and transport. \n \n10. \nThere is also a clear segmentation of the market by wealth level. Table 1 shows that the \nrural poor tend to rely on family, friends, and moneylenders more commonly than the less poor. \nAlthough only 7.7% of the richest rural households borrowed from a commercial bank in the last \n12 months, this still represents significantly greater access than that for the two poorest quartiles, \nof  whom  only  1.7%  and  1.4%,  respectively,  borrowed  from  a  commercial  bank.  This  pattern \napplies to APB also, with 5.2% of the richest quartile borrowing compared with only 1.0% of the \npoorest  quartile.  Additional  data  indicate  that  the  most  common  activities  of  the  two  poorest \nquartiles that faced unsatisfied demand for credit were agriculture and animal raising, while the \ntwo richest quartiles more commonly reported unsatisfied demand for credit to finance wholesale \nand retail trade. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n7  The  survey  strata  do  not  correspond  precisely  to  segmentation  by  farming  system.  The  upland  and  mountain \nsystems  are  most  prevalent  in  the  remote  rural  stratum,  while  the  flatland  system  is  more  common  to  the  rural \nMekong area and, in some cases, the peri-urban areas. The plateau system, depending on location, could be in the \nupland or peri-urban areas. \n\n \n\n\fTable 1: Access to Financial Services, by Wealth Quartile \n\nVariable \n\nPoorest \nQuartile \n55.3 \n1.0 \n1.7 \n5.2 \n35.1 \n\n2nd \nQuartile \n52.2 \n1.4 \n1.4 \n3.1 \n33.0 \n\n3rd \nQuartile \n45.2 \n3.1 \n4.2 \n0.3 \n28.9 \n\nRichest \nQuartile \n39.0 \n5.2 \n7.7 \n2.8 \n16.0 \n\nPercentage of households that borrowed in last 12 months \nPercentage that borrowed from APB in last 12 months \nPercentage that borrowed from any bank in last 12 months \nPercentage that borrowed from a moneylender in last 12 months  \nPercentage that borrowed from family or friends in last 12 months  \nAPB = Agriculture Promotion Bank. \nSource:  ADB/FIRST  Survey  of  Rural  Finance,  Subproject  6  of  TA  cluster  3413-LAO:  Rural  Finance  Development, \nFebruary\u2013March 2004. \n \n11. \nThere is also a strong demand for secure savings facilities that are easily accessible and \nretain their value. Across all wealth groups, the most valued characteristics of a savings vehicle \nwere (i) ability to retain or increase in value, with 35% citing this as an important characteristic; \n(ii)  liquidity  (30%);  and  (iii)  safety  (16%).  However,  savings  mobilization  in  the  formal  sector  is \nlow\u2014less than 15% of all Lao households have a savings account in the formal sector, and over \n90%  of  savings  in  formal  financial  institutions  are  held  by  urban  clients.  Only  5.8%  of  rural \nhouseholds  surveyed  in  early  2004  held  any  savings  in  a  bank,  another  5.2%  held  savings  in \nsemiformal  financial  institutions,  and  2.1%  held  savings  in  informal  rotating  savings  and  credit \nassociations.  Less  than  one  third  of  cash  savings  and  only  about  2%  of  total  savings  in  rural \nareas  are  deposited  in  the  banking  system.  At  the  same  time,  98%  of  households  reported \nsavings in the form of livestock, 35% in the form of housing materials such as lumber, and 38% \nin the form of precious metals and jewelry; the poorest quartile hold 93% of their savings in kind. \nNonetheless,  50%  of  households  surveyed  reported  that  a  bank  would  be  their  first  or  second \npreference as a savings vehicle, indicating large unmet demand for formal savings services.  \n \n12. \nSupply  of  Rural  Finance.  Despite  the  high  and  varied  demand,  the  financial  sector  in \nthe Lao PDR has a low level of outreach in rural areas. APB is the only formal financial institution \nwith  significant  outreach  and  service  history  in  rural  areas.  It  has  a  branch  in  each  of  the \ncountry\u2019s 17 provinces, a branch covering Vientiane Municipality, and subservice units in 55 of \nthe  country\u2019s  141  districts.8  Per  its  records,  APB  provides  credit  and  savings  services  to  about \n120,000 (or 14%) of the country\u2019s estimated 900,000 households. However, the survey of 1,189 \nhouseholds done in early 2004 indicated that only 1.95% had borrowed from APB in the previous \n12 months, confirming that the bulk of APB\u2019s current clients are urban. \n \n13. \nSince APB\u2019s creation in 1993, its operations have concentrated on providing subsidized \ncredit to producers of agricultural products (notably rice), livestock, and handicrafts. Its funding \nhas been provided by national and local government budget allocations, the Bank of Lao PDR \n(BOL, the central bank), and international development agencies. As of 31 December 2003, APB \nhad  60  such  funding  arrangements  that  financed  52%  of  its  loan  portfolio.  Major  aid-funded \ncredit  lines  still  outstanding  have  come  from  ADB  ($7  million),  the  Government  of  Japan \n($2 million in equipment), International Fund for Agriculture Development ($500,000), European \n\n                                                 \n8  Only  Lao  Development  Bank  (LDB)  has  a  comparable  branch  network  (with  one  branch  per  province),  but \nconcentrates lending on small and medium-size enterprises in the provincial capitals. About 2,000 small savers and \nborrowers (or 0.25% of households) use LDB. The Banque pour le Commerce Ext\u00e9rieur du Laos (BCEL) generally \nconfines  its  lending  to  urban  areas  and  focuses  on  financing  trade  and  larger  enterprises.  Branches  of  several \nforeign  banks  started  operating  in  Vientiane  in  the  early  1990s,  but  deficiencies  in  the  banking  environment, \nparticularly  the  legal  framework,  and  limitations  on  their  activities  have  limited  their  contribution  to  the  domestic \neconomy. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nUnion ($200,000), and Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) ($40,000). \nThe remainder of its loan portfolio is funded from deposits. \n \n14. \nIn the semiformal sector, five initiatives that seek to provide microfinance services on a \nsustainable  basis  have  only  about  5,900  savers  and  4,600  borrowers\u2015for  the  most  part  the \nsavings are compulsory deposits that partially guarantee borrowers\u2019 loans.  \n \n15. \nIn  addition  to  these  sustainably  focused  initiatives,  about  35  international  non-\ngovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and  bilateral  development  agencies  have  supported  small-\nscale  credit  initiatives  in  remote  areas,  largely  through  village  funds.  In  some  districts,  these \nvillage funds are significant providers of financial services, representing the only source of credit \nother than family and friends. About 8,000 households have access to loans from village-based \nfunds. However, these funds have generally been an ancillary activity attached to projects with \nbroader  development  goals  and  have  not  focused  on  the  development  of  a  sustainable \nmicrofinance  institution  (MFI).  They  often  become  nonoperational  after  project  support  ends.  A \nmajor role in the implementation of such projects has been played by the Lao Women\u2019s Union \n(LWU).  \n \n16. \nIn  the  informal  sector,  family  and  friends  are  consistently  reported  to  be  the  primary \nsource of credit by most households, and borrowing from moneylenders is less common. In the \n2004 rural finance survey, 25% of households reported borrowing from a friend or family member \nin  the  previous  12  months,  and  57%  reported  that  they  would  first  approach  a  friend  or  family \nmember  if  they  needed  a  loan.  In  contrast,  1.95%  reported  borrowing  from  APB  and  19% \nreported  that  they  would  first  approach  APB  if  they  needed  a  loan.  Only  2.14%  reported \nborrowing  from  a  moneylender,  and  only  1.9%  reported  that  they  first  would  approach  a \nmoneylender  if  they  needed  a  loan.  Appendix  1  gives  a  fuller  analysis  of  the  rural  and \nmicrofinance sector. \n \nB. \n \n17. \nA  dynamic  rural  economy  is  necessary  to  achieve  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction \ngoals  and  requires  sustainable,  market-oriented  rural  and  microfinance  institutions  that  can \nintermediate  between  savers  and  borrowers,  efficiently  allocate  resources,  and  facilitate \nproduction  and  the  exchange  of  goods  and  services.  Lao  PDR\u2019s  rural  finance  sector  faces \nsignificant  constraints  in  fulfilling  its  potential  to  contribute  to  economic  growth  and  poverty \nreduction. The Lao population in rural areas is highly dispersed, and limited infrastructure adds \nto  the  cost  of  financial  intermediation  and  inhibits  information  flows  for  lenders  and  borrowers. \nThese factors combined with the small-scale nature of transactions pose serious challenges for \ndeveloping  rural  finance.  Indeed,  it  is  estimated  that  20%  of  households  live  in  such  remote \nareas, with no road access at any time of the year, that it may be difficult to provide them with \nmicrofinance services on a sustainable basis. \n \n18. \nIn the absence of access to formal sources of credit, the poor continue to rely on informal \nsources of finance, including landlords, merchants, moneylenders, relatives, and friends. Loans \nfrom friends and family are usually interest-free, but sometimes carry interest rates common to \nmoneylenders.  Typical  interest  rates  charged  by  moneylenders,  merchants,  and  other  informal \nsources are 10% per month (120% per year) and can be as high as 40% per month. Alternative, \naffordable, and sustainable sources of rural financial services are therefore necessary to support \neconomic growth and poverty reduction in the rural economy.  \n \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n \n\n\fAgriculture  Promotion  Bank.  The  Government's  policy  to  support  access  to  rural \n19. \nfinance has been implemented primarily by APB, which was established as a policy bank in 1993 \nand has acted as a channel for Government and aid funds and subsidies by carrying out policy \nlending  on  behalf  of  the  Government.9  APB\u2019s  interest  rates  on  policy  loans  have  been \ndetermined  by  either  the  Government  or  agreements  with  aid  agencies  and  other  funding \nsources. Typically, they are below market rates, as low as 7% per year, and insufficient to cover \nAPB\u2019s  costs.  APB\u2019s  ordinary  lending  is  funded  from  deposits,  with  lending  rates  closer  to \ncommercial terms (e.g., 20% for crops and livestock, 24% for handicraft, 26% for small industry, \n30% for trade and services, and 34% for overdrafts). These rates are set by APB\u2019s Board, but \nthey are not based on APB\u2019s actual risks. APB's outreach is limited because it depends on the \nlimited  funding  available  from  the  Government  and  aid  agencies  and  because  its  policies, \ninefficient  and  subsidized  operations,  and  weak  financial  condition  prevent  it  from  mobilizing \ncommercial  funding.  Institutionally,  APB  carries  out  financial  and  nonfinancial  activities  (for \nexample,  distributing  fertilizer  and  equipment),  reflecting  its  mixed  mandate  as  a  financial \ninstitution  and  development  organ  of  the  state.  As  a  result,  its  operations  are  inefficient,  and \nmanagement autonomy and responsibility are limited. \n \n20. \nSubsidized  interest  rates  and  the  common  practice  of  rolling  over  loans  have \nprevented  APB  from  developing  and  adopting  realistic  credit  risk  assessment  and  loan  pricing \npractices, and have contributed to a weak credit culture and high levels of non-performing loans \n(NPLs). Consequently, according to international accounting standards, APB has been operating \nat  a  significant  loss  since  it  was  established  in  1993.  However,  before  2002,  APB  had  never \nbeen  audited,  making  its  financial  situation  (and,  therefore,  costs  to  the  Government  budget) \nunclear.  APB\u2019s  first  audit,  which  took  place  in  2002,  indicated  a  high  rate  of  NPLs10  as  of \nDecember  2001,  and  inadequate  provision  for  doubtful  debts.  APB\u2019s  portfolio  regrading \nundertaken  as  of  31  December  2003  indicates  that  the  high  NPL  rate  is  driven  largely  by  its \npolicy lending, which has an NPL rate that is 2.4 times higher than the NPL rate of its ordinary \nloan  portfolio.  APB  has  incurred  significant  losses  each  year  since  its  establishment, \nrepresenting costs to the Government budget. Loans of about KN82.5 billion (35% of APB\u2019s total \nportfolio)  needed  to  be  written  off  as  of  31  December  2003.  The  amount  comprised  KN59.4 \nbillion  in  policy  loans  (52%  of  the  policy  lending  portfolio)  and  KN23.2  billion  in  ordinary  loans \n(26% of the ordinary portfolio). Since APB\u2019s establishment in 1993, about $1 million equivalent \nper year on average has been lost and losses have accelerated in recent years. Further analysis \nof APB\u2019s financial performance and projections is in Appendix 1 and Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n21.  Market  reforms  in  APB  are  necessary  to  enable  it  to  increase  outreach  sustainably \nwithout  burdening  the  Government  budget.  Moreover,  international  and  Lao  experience \ndemonstrate that the non-poor are the main beneficiaries of subsidized interest rates since they \nhave  greater  access  and  can  absorb  larger  loans.  Over  half  of  APB\u2019s  loan  portfolio  is \nconcentrated in the two wealthiest areas of the country\u2014Vientiane and Champasack. The 2004 \nsurvey of 1,189 households indicated that 77% of APB\u2019s borrowers in the sample were of above-\naverage wealth as measured by asset value; and 58% came from the provincial capital or peri-\nurban  areas.  In  contrast,  the  poor  were  three  times  as  likely  to  borrow  from  a  moneylender. \nInternational experience has shown that when subsidized loans are not available, the poor are \nwilling  to  pay  market  interest  rates,  and  they  tend  to  value  sustained  access  more  than  a  low \ninterest  rate.  The  2004  survey  bears  this  out  for  the  Lao  PDR  too\u201446%  of  households  in  the \npoorest  quartile  cited  \u201cconfidence  that  a  loan  will  be  made\u201d  as  an  important  characteristic  in \nchoosing  where  to  apply  for  a  loan,  but  only  19%  cited  the  interest  rate  as  an  important \n                                                 \n9  Policy lending in the Lao PDR generally refers to directed credit at preferential interest rates. \n10  NPLs are loans on which repayment of principal or interest is overdue by more than 90 days. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\ncharacteristic. Therefore, developing a market-oriented rural financial system is the best way to \nprovide  the  poor  with  access  to  affordable  financial  services.  Compared  with  informal  interest \nrates, sustainable rates of 25-35% will mark a substantial improvement. \n \nAPB\u2019s  legal  status  is  somewhat  ambiguous.  It  was  established  by  prime  ministerial \n22. \ndecree no. 92/PM on 19 June 1993 as a development bank, with the Ministry of Finance (MOF) \nholding  its  shares.  Per  Article  5  of  this  decree,  \u201cthe  state  budget  encourages  reduced  lending \nrates and guarantees minimum prices of major agricultural products \u2026 so that farmers need not \nbe concerned with the marketing of their production\u201d. Per article 6, \u201cBOL \u2026 shall implement the \nrequired  conditions  concerning  the  establishment  of  this  bank,  to  determine  its  organizational \nstructure,  and  to  establish  regulations  governing  the  management  and  the  action  program  of \nAPB, which will be submitted for approval of the Government.\u201d Presidential decree no. 02/PR on \nCommercial  Banks,  22  March  2000,  appears  to  bring  APB  largely  under  its  provisions, \nsuperseding  the  1993  establishment  decree.  However,  the  wording  of  this  decree  can  be \ninterpreted  to  leave  APB\u2019s  status  as  a  \u201ccommercial\u201d  or  \u201cdevelopment\u201d  bank  uncertain;  and  in \neffect, APB has continued to be treated as a development bank, separate from the other state-\nowned commercial banks. As such, BOL has not conducted on-site supervision of APB and has \nnot required APB to comply with prudential ratios or to submit standard reports and information \nfor off-site supervision. APB has effectively gone unregulated and unsupervised by BOL since its \nestablishment. \n \n23.  Microfinance Institutions and Initiatives. Microfinance is at an embryonic stage in the \nLao  PDR.  The  combined  outreach  of  the  four  largest  initiatives  is  less  than  6,000.  APB\u2019s \noperations  have  tended  to  distort  the  rural  finance  system  and  result  in  misallocation  of \nresources, low deposit mobilization, and crowding out of MFIs and other banks\u2014further limiting \noutreach. They also create a climate of unrealistic expectations on the part of potential borrowers \nand central and local officials regarding the cost of credit, thus making it difficult for microfinance \ninitiatives  to  charge  sustainable  interest  rates  even  in  areas  where  APB\u2019s  outreach  is  limited. \nVillage  revolving  funds  established  by  the  LWU  in  some  1,600  villages  (sometimes  with  the \nsupport  of  international  aid  agencies)  reinforce  these  expectations\u2014in  general,  they  channel  a \nlimited amount of subsidized credit to a few households, do not mobilize local resources, have \nlow repayment rates, and are not sustainable. It is unknown how many are still operational. \n \n24. \nProjects  or  MFIs  that  attempt  to  charge  sustainable  interest  rates  are  typically \ndiscouraged or prevented from doing so by local officials. The lack of a clear legal and regulatory \nframework  for  microfinance  gives  MFI  practitioners  little  recourse  to  counter  interference  from \nsuch officials. This lack of a transparent framework and the consequent interference are cited by \ninternational  NGOs  and  other  potential  microfinance  investors  as  the  main  reason  for  not \ninvesting in the sector. Current regulations (regulation no. 02/SB of 15 November 1994 issued by \nBOL) cover only credit cooperatives and provide limited or no guidance on operational rules of \ninterest,  auditing  requirements,  prudential  discipline,  reporting \ngovernance,  conflicts  of \nrequirements,  sanctions,  and  experience  or  qualification  of  board  members.  In  addition  to  the \nlack  of  a  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  microfinance,  BOL  has  no  experience  and  only \nlimited capacity to supervise MFIs. Because of these constraints, very few MFIs operate in the \ncountry.  Most  microfinance  is  delivered  through  one-off  projects  and  other  unsustainable \ninitiatives, capacity is low, and accounting practices are weak or nonexistent. \n \n25. \nActions  and  Plans  of  the  Government.  Lao  authorities  have  begun  taking  important \nsteps to improve the policy, regulatory, and institutional environment for rural and microfinance. \n\n \n\n\fSince March 2000, ADB has been assisting the Government in its efforts under a TA cluster to \ndevelop  rural  finance.11  Given  the  nascent  stage  of  the  sector,  subproject  1  of  the  TA  cluster, \ncarried out in 2000/01, built awareness of rural finance issues, including international experience \nand  best  practice,  through  a  series  of  workshops  and  study  tours  and  prepared  a  policy  and \nissues  paper  that  identified  weaknesses  in  the  institutional,  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory \nframework.  \n \n26. \nTo  begin  reforming  APB,  subproject  2  (May\u2013December  2002)  conducted  a  diagnostic \nreview  and  financial  audit  of  APB.  Based  on  the  findings,  an  APB  restructuring  plan  was \nprepared  (Supplementary  Appendix  C),  which  addresses  weaknesses  in  APB's  policies  and \nprocedures  in  many  areas,  including  governance,  planning,  organizational  structure,  pricing, \ncredit,  products  and  services, \ntechnology  (ICT),  risk \nmanagement,  and  accounting.  Importantly,  the  restructuring  plan  includes  phasing  out  policy \nlending  from  APB  and  shifting  residual  policy  lending,  if  any,  to  a  transparent,  nonbanking \nmechanism  on  the  Government  budget.  In  November  2002,  the  Government  adopted  a  new \ncorporate  vision  for  APB  to  \"operate  in  a  market-oriented,  financially  self-sustainable  way  to \nthe  country's  economic  growth  and  prosperity.\" \ncontribute \nImplementation  of  the  first  phase  of  the  APB  restructuring  plan  began  in  March  2003  under \nsubproject 5 and was completed in July 2004. In the first phase, restructuring activities were: \n \n\ninformation  and  communications \n\nto  poverty  reduction  and \n\n(i) \n\nplanning for financial restructuring, including \n\nputting in place a 3-year rolling corporate planning process, \npreparing business plans and a financial modeling system, \ndeveloping and implementing a systematic workout plan for NPLs,  \npreparing a plan to phase out policy lending and project-based credit lines, \nformulating  a  plan \nfor  compliance  with  prudential  regulations  and \nrecapitalization, \ndefining a market-based pricing policy, and  \nsimplifying the loan product line; \n\nplanning  for  organizational  restructuring  and  human  resources  best  practice, \nincluding \n\nrevising the functions and responsibilities of APB\u2019s Board, \npreparing a plan to strengthen APB\u2019s organization, \ncarrying out job analyses and preparing written job descriptions, and  \nconducting a training program to support restructuring;  \n\n \n\n \n\n(a) \n(b) \n(c) \n(d) \n(e) \n\n(f) \n(g) \n\n(a) \n(b) \n(c) \n(d) \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\ninitiating basic risk management practices, including \n\n(a) \n(b) \n\nputting in place prudent loan classification and provisioning systems, and  \ndefining new basic risk management and credit policies and procedures. \n\n \n27.  While  the  capacity  of  APB  is  being  developed  through  its  restructuring  program, \ninstitutional mechanisms involving the private sector are also being promoted under subproject 3 \nof the TA cluster, begun in March 2003, which established three pilot savings and credit unions \n(SCUs)  in  areas  with  strong  market  linkages.  These  SCUs  are  member-owned  and  managed, \n\n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2000.

They  were  licensed  and  began \noperations in May and June 2004. \n \nIn  addition,  the  Government's  Rural  and  Microfinance  Committee  (RMFC),  with  support \n28. \nfrom  ADB,  Concern  Worldwide,  the  Financial  Sector  Reform  and  Strengthening  Initiative \n(FIRST),  and  the  World  Bank,  prepared  an  official  vision  and  policy  statement  for  the  sector, \nbased  on  a  participatory  process  with  key  stakeholders,  including  villagers.  The  thrust  of  the \nPolicy  Statement  for  the  Development  of  Sustainable  Rural  and  Micro  Finance  Sector12  is  the \ndevelopment  of  a  market-oriented,  sustainable  sector,  which  includes  active  private  sector \nparticipation; removal of interest rate caps and subsidies; and development of an enabling policy, \nlegal,  and  regulatory  framework.  The  Policy  Statement  was  endorsed  by  a  forum  of  provincial \nvice-governors and other senior Lao officials in June 2003, by BOL in August 2003, and by the \nPrime  Minister\u2019s  Office  in  November  2003.  Subproject  4  of  the  TA  cluster  (co-financed  by \nFIRST), begun in March 2003 and completed in May 2004, has sustained the momentum of the \nreform process by assisting the RMFC through a participatory process to develop a strategy to \npromote rural and microfinance development, and assisting BOL's Department of Supervision to \ndevelop an enabling legal and regulatory framework.13 \n \n29. \nLessons Learned. In addition to building on the recent achievements supported by the \nTA cluster, the program also incorporates lessons learned from previous assistance to the Lao \nPDR.14  Specifically,  it  emphasizes  the  need  to  ensure  a  sustainable,  positive  real  interest  rate \npolicy in APB by eliminating interest rate subsidies. Such subsidies are a drain on the national \nbudget  and  have  a  distorting  effect  on  markets  that  is  inconsistent  with  the  Government\u2019s \nstrategy to move toward an efficient market-oriented economy. The program, through a step-by-\nstep consensus-building approach initiated by the TA cluster, has also allowed for a longer lead \ntime  for  reform  measures  that  are  dependent  on  legislation  or  regulatory  changes.  This \nparticipatory approach has built in the Government a strong sense of ownership for the program, \nwhile simultaneously coordinating support from various aid agencies, including IMF, World Bank, \nbilateral agencies, and international NGOs. Information on external assistance and coordination \nin  the  financial  sector  is  in  Appendix  2.  The  program  takes  into  consideration  existing  capacity \nconstraints in the staffs of executing agencies and implementing agencies by incorporating TA to \nbuild  capacity  and  support  implementation,  and  targeting  TA  at  the  appropriate  technical  level. \nImportantly,  the  program  takes  into  account  the  unfavorable  experience  in  recapitalizing  the \nstate-owned  commercial  banks  (SOCBs)  under  previous  programs  by  addressing  institutional \nweaknesses,  credit  policies  and  procedures,  management  autonomy,  and  workout  of  NPLs. \nMoreover, recapitalization of APB will be subject to strictly enforced performance criteria agreed \nupon by APB, BOL, MOF, and ADB. \n \n30. \nThe  initial  reforms  and  initiatives  the  Government  has  undertaken  are  important  first \nsteps  in  developing  sustainable,  market-oriented  rural  and  microfinance  that  can  contribute  to \ndeveloping  the  potential  for  agricultural  and  rural  enterprises.  However,  a  large  portion  of  poor \nhouseholds  remain  outside  the  reach  of  formal  financial  institutions.  To  develop  a  sustainable, \n                                                 \n12  Available as Supplementary Appendix D. \n13   BOL\u2019s  draft  strategy  and  action  plan  and  draft  microfinance  regulations  are  available  as  Supplementary \n\nAppendixes E and F, respectively. \n\n14   ADB.  1999.

Improvements in the policy environment will \ninclude fostering competition among and market access for new MFIs, as well as facilitating their \nsustainable  operation  in  a  conducive  supervisory  and  regulatory  framework.  BOL\u2019s  capacity  to \nimplement  this  framework  needs  to  be  strengthened.  Linkages  between  public  institutions, \nNGOs,  the  private  sector,  and  other  financial  institutions  also  need  to  be  established  in  a \nsystematic  manner.  A  more  efficient,  diverse,  competitive,  and  market-oriented  rural  finance \nsystem  will  increase  access  to  financial  services  and  significantly  expand  income-generating \nopportunities, generate employment, and reduce poverty. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\nto  capital  will  encourage \n\n \nA. \n \n31. \nThe  goal  of  the  Rural  Finance  Sector  Development  Program  (RFSDP)  is  to  assist  the \nGovernment  to  reduce  poverty  and  promote  sustainable  economic  growth  in  rural  areas.  The \nRFSDP  will  contribute  to  this  goal  by  promoting  a  sustainable  and  market-oriented  rural  and \nmicrofinance  sector.  A  systemic  response  is  necessary  to  develop  rural  and  microfinance, \nincluding policy reforms and institutional investments. The sector development program modality \nhas therefore been chosen to facilitate the adoption of sector reforms to ensure that an enabling \npolicy,  legal,  and  regulatory  framework  is  in  place  to  enhance  the  effectiveness  of strategically \nidentified investments. The RFSDP will assist the Government to improve the performance of the \nsector,  including  reducing  transaction  costs  associated  with  delivery  of  financial  services  and \nthereby increase sustained access to financial services by the rural poor and operators of micro, \nsmall,  and  medium-size  enterprises.  Rural  finance  clients  will  have  opportunities  to  increase \nincomes  and  employment  and  improve  their  quality  of  life  through  access  to  strengthened, \nsustainable,  and  more  responsive  services  that  support  investment  and  production.  The \nfarmers,  nonfarm  rural  households,  and \nincreased  access \nagribusinesses to invest and create job opportunities. \n \n32. \nThe RFSDP comprises a program loan and a project loan. The program loan is based on \nthe  first  phase  of  the  Government\u2019s  draft  long-term  strategy  and  action  plan  to  develop  the \nsector.  The  RFSDP  will  support  (i)  development  of  an  enabling  policy  framework  for  rural  and \nmicrofinance; \nframework; \n(iii) development  of  a  sustainable,  market-oriented  APB;  and  (iv)  a  supportive  nonprudential \nregulatory  environment.  Key,  broad-based  policy  reforms  will  be  achieved  as  first-tranche \nmeasures,  including  adoption  of  a  new  national  policy  on  rural  and  microfinance,  issuance  of \nmicrofinance regulations and other legal changes, and adoption of a governance agreement as \nthe basis for APB reforms.15 Second- and third-tranche measures will include key policy reforms \nas  well  as  measures  to  institute  regular  monitoring  and  supervision  mechanisms  to  receive \nfeedback  on  implementation  of  the  reform  program  to  make  necessary  course  adjustments \nand/or keep the reform agenda on track. \n \nThe project loan comprises (i) support to BOL to build the capacity to implement the new \n33. \nregulatory  and  supervisory  framework  for  microfinance;  (ii)  support  for  APB  to  strengthen  its \nhuman  resources,  build  its  human  resources  management  capacity,  upgrade  its  accounting \nsystems,  and  improve  its  credit  and  risk  management;  and  (iii)  investment  in  upgraded  ICT \n\nregulatory  and  supervisory \n\nthe  prudential \n\nreforms \n\n(ii) \n\nin \n\n                                                 \n15 The governance agreement is available as Supplementary Appendix G. \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\f11 \n\nsystems  for  APB  and  related  support  for  implementing  the  upgrade.  The  project  loan  is \nconsistent  with  the  Program\u2019s  objective  and  is  required  to  help  the  Government  achieve  this \nobjective and to meet the significant but unfulfilled demand for rural and microfinance services. \nThe program framework is in Appendix 3, and the Government\u2019s development policy letter and \npolicy matrix are in Appendix 4. \n \nB. \n \n\nThe Program Loan \n\n1. \n\nObjectives \n\n \n34. \nThe  program  loan  will  promote  the  development  of  a  sustainable  and  market-oriented \nrural  and  microfinance  sector  by  helping  the  Government  implement  the  policy  reforms \nembodied in its strategy to promote the sector. \n \n\n2. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nThe program loan has four components:  \n\n \n35. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nCreating an enabling policy framework for public and private provision of rural and \nmicrofinance. \nCreating  a  sound  prudential  regulatory  and  supervisory  environment  for  public \nand private rural and microfinance institutions. \nTransforming APB into a financially self-sustainable, market-oriented rural finance \ninstitution. \nCreating  a  supportive  nonprudential  regulatory  environment  for  rural  and \nmicrofinance.  \n\nThe  program  loan  will be  released  in  three  tranches:  the  first  tranche is  expected to  be \n\n \n36. \nreleased in September 2006, the second in December 2007, and the third in June 2009. \n \n\na. \n\nCreating an Enabling Policy Framework for Public and Private \nProvision of Rural and Microfinance \n\n \n37. \nThroughout  2002  and  2003,  the  Government  carried  out  an  extensive  participatory \nprocess with key stakeholders to develop an enabling national policy on rural and microfinance. \nThis policy replaces the over reliance on subsidized, directed credit channeled through APB and \nencourages  the  establishment  and  operation  of  alternative  sources  of  rural  finance,  including \nmicrofinance. The process resulted in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office\u2019s (PMO\u2019s) endorsement of the \nPolicy  Statement  for  the  Development  of  Sustainable  Rural  and  Micro  Finance  Sector  in \nNovember  2003.  The  Policy  Statement  presents  a  vision  that  (i)  the  sector  will  expand \nsignificantly; (ii) the sector will include a diversity of independent MFIs, including private and/or \npublic institutions with access to national and international public and private investors, including \ninternational  donors  and  development  partners;  (iii)  the  sector  will  become  sustainable,  and \ninterest  rates  will  be  set  by  MFIs\u2019  management  based  on  full  cost  recovery,  profitability,  and \nmarket  demand;  and  (iv)  the  environment  will  ensure  security  for  depositors,  including \nimplementation  of  an  appropriate  legal  and  regulatory  framework  and  strengthening  of \nsupervision of deposit-taking MFIs. \n \nThe Government is following up the development of the Policy Statement with a strategy \n38. \nand action plan for its implementation. The Government\u2019s RMFC will initiate a process of regular \nconsultations  with  key  stakeholders  to  conduct  policy  dialogue  and  to  review  progress  in \n\n \n\n\fimplementing  the  Policy  Statement  and  strategy.  In  recognition  of  the  fact  that  rural  and \nmicrofinance  is  an  integral  part  of  the  overall  financial  sector,  the  Government  will  incorporate \nrural finance in the financial sector strategy that will be prepared by June 2007. As a result, rural \nand microfinance development will shift from an ad hoc project approach to a coherent national \nstrategy that provides short-, medium-, and long-term direction, and has been and will continue \nto  be  participatory  in  its  formulation,  formalization,  and  implementation.  This  formal  foundation \nwill  create  an  enabling  environment  for  deepening  the  rural  and  microfinance  sector  and  will \nencourage domestic private participation in the sector. \n \n\nb. \n\nCreating a Sound Prudential Regulatory and Supervisory \nEnvironment for Public and Private Rural and Microfinance \nInstitutions \n\n \n39. \nBecause of APB\u2019s historical role as a policy bank, it has effectively gone unsupervised by \nBOL.  With  its  transformation  into  a  market-oriented  rural  finance  institution,  APB  will  now  be \nrecognized and  treated  as  an  SOCB  and  will  therefore  be  subject  to  the  prudential  regulations \nand supervisory regime applicable to SOCBs. BOL will issue instructions to APB to comply with \nprudential  regulations  on  loan  classification  and  provisioning  (including  a  category  for  special \nmention  loans)  starting  October  2005  and  to  comply  with  all  prudential  regulations  other  than \ncapital adequacy and minimum capital requirements by December 2005. BOL will develop and \nimplement  a  supervisory  regime  of  monthly  off-site  and  semiannual  on-site  inspection  of  APB. \nAPB will undergo annual external audits according to international financial reporting standards \n(IFRS)  and,  beginning  in  2006,  will  publish  its  IFRS  financial  statements.  To  ensure  that  APB, \nunder  its  status  as  an  SOCB,  can  continue  to  conduct  microfinance  operations  through  group-\nlending arrangements, Article 65 of the Commercial Bank Decree will be amended to clarify that \ncollateral requirements for bank loans will abide by the rules and loan agreements set out by the \nbanks.16 \n \nThe  lack  of  transparent  and  enabling  regulations  for  microfinance  has  been  a  major \n40. \nreason  for  the  lack  of  investment  in  MFIs  and  has  resulted  in  arbitrary  interference  in  MFI \noperations,  rendering  sustainability  difficult.  To  create  an  enabling  legal,  regulatory,  and \nsupervisory  framework  for  microfinance,  BOL  will  adopt  and  implement  regulations,  bylaws, \nguidelines,  a  chart  of  accounts,  and  accounting  standards  for  MFIs  based  on  best  practice \nprinciples. The regulations will, for the first time in the Lao PDR, allow for multiple MFI models \nand products with minimum starting regulations, interest rate autonomy, and private ownership. \n \n\nc. \n\nTransforming APB into a Financially Self-Sustainable, Market- \nOriented Rural Finance Institution  \n\n \n41. \nAPB  must  be  transformed  into  a  sustainable,  market-oriented  rural  finance  institution  to \n(i) extend its outreach in a way that does not burden the Government\u2019s budget, (ii) fulfill its vision \nof  contributing  to  poverty  reduction  and  growth  of  the  rural  economy,  and  (iii)  eliminate  its \ndistorting and crowding-out effect on the financial sector. \n \nAPB\u2019s restructuring plan was prepared and adopted in 2002. Implementation of the first \n42. \nphase began in March 2003 and was completed in 2004. The second phase will continue under \nthe RFSDP and will include key policy reforms such as the (i) adoption and implementation of a \ngovernance agreement for APB, (ii) phasing out of policy lending and interest rate subsidies from \n                                                 \n16 Article 65 of the Commercial Bank Decree has been interpreted by some to mean that all commercial bank loans \n\nmust be secured by physical collateral. \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\f13 \n\nAPB,  (iii)  progressive  recapitalization  of  APB  based  on  performance,  and  (iv)  strengthening  of \nAPB\u2019s new organization through the appointment of qualified department heads. \n \n43. \napproved APB Restructuring Plan, which includes best-practice provisions to \n \n\nThe  governance  agreement  will  be  the  basis  for  the  time-bound  implementation  of  the \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n(viii) \n(ix) \n(x) \n(xi) \n(xii) \n\nbring APB under the prudential regulatory and supervisory regime for SOCBs;  \nrequire APB to operate on a solely commercial basis;  \nstrengthen APB\u2019s institutional autonomy;  \nwrite off loss-graded loans;  \nimplement a policy lending phase out plan;  \nreport and grade performance;  \nrecapitalize APB based on performance;  \ncarry out sanctions for nonperformance;  \ncarry out internal and external audit;  \nstrengthen APB\u2019s Board and management and clarify their roles;  \nadopt new organizational unit mandates and job descriptions;  \nreorganize the structure and staffing of APB and put in place necessary mitigating \nmeasures for retrenchment, if any;  \nupgrade APB\u2019s ICT systems; and  \n\nincluding  human  resources  and  human  resource \nmanagement  development,  risk  management  development,  and  improvement  in \naccounting and management information system (MIS). \n\nin  APB \n\n(xiii) \n(xiv)  build  capacity \n\n \n44.  MOF will inject additional capital into APB in accordance with the governance agreement \nand performance targets defined therein. BOL will ensure that the provisions of the governance \nagreement  are  adhered  to  and  that,  in  the  case  of  noncompliance,  sanctions  outlined  in  the \ngovernance  agreement,  including  postponement  of  performance-based  recapitalization,  will  be \napplied.  MOF  and  BOL  will  review  and  update  with  APB  on  an  annual  basis  the  performance \ntargets  and  other  conditionality  for  recapitalization,  including  specific  requirements  for  portfolio \nworkout  and  NPL  resolution,  and  update  the  governance  agreement  for  performance-based \nrecapitalization. \n \n\nd. \n\nCreating a Supportive Nonprudential Regulatory Environment for \nRural and Microfinance \n\n \nCreating  a  supportive  nonprudential  regulatory  environment  is  also  crucial  for  rural  and \n45. \nmicrofinance.  Nonprudential  regulatory  issues  relate  to  the  general  conduct  of  business.  To \nensure that MFIs can operate sustainably, the Standing Committee of the National Assembly will \nissue  an  interpretation  of  Article  46  of  the  Contract  Law  that  MFIs  are  exempted  from  interest \nrate ceilings, and the PMO will issue an instruction under Article 5 of Law No. 5 on the Bank of \nLao PDR (1995) authorizing BOL to issue microfinance regulations. \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \n46. \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  $7.684  million  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds resources to help finance the Program. The Borrower will be the Government of the Lao \nPDR. The loan will have a repayment period of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years. An \ninterest  rate  of  1%  per  annum  will  be  charged  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter.  The  loan  amount  takes  into  account  the  depth  and  scope  of  the  proposed  policy \n\n \n\n\freforms  and  the  estimated  short-  and  medium-term  adjustment  costs  associated  with \nimplementing the reforms in the policy matrix.  \n \n47. \nADB  funds  will  support  policy  reforms  that  address  sensitive,  long-standing,  but \nfundamental  issues  and  socially  significant  measures  to  enhance  the  outreach  of  financial \nservices  to  the  rural  sector.  The  fundamental  shift  in  the  rural  finance  policy  environment  is \nreflected  in  the  (i)  phase  out  of  directed  lending  and  interest  rate  subsidies  from  APB; \n(ii) emphasis on autonomy, good governance, market orientation, and sustainability in APB and \nMFIs;  (iii)  performance-based  recapitalization  of  APB;  (iv)  the  encouragement  of  private  sector \nparticipation  in  microfinance  to  enhance  employment  and  income  generating  opportunities  for \nthe  poor;  and  (v)  recognition  and  encouragement  of  the  role  of  international  donors  and \ndevelopment partners in microfinance. \n \n\n4. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\na. \n\nProgram Management \n\n \n48. \nBOL will be the Executing Agency for the RFSDP and will oversee compliance with the \nreform  program.  BOL  will  establish  a  program  management  unit  (PMU)  and  assign  a  program \ndirector and two full-time counterpart staff with qualifications and experience acceptable to ADB. \nThe PMU will consult with and coordinate with the RMFC as appropriate. To ensure coordination \nof  the  reform  program,  the  deputy  governor  of  BOL  will  chair  a  program  steering  committee \n(PSC) comprising senior representatives of PMO, MOF, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Department \nof  International  Economic  Cooperation),  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Forestry  (MAF),  APB,  and \nMinistry of Justice (MOJ). To ensure the necessary political support and oversight, each ministry, \ncommittee, or organization on the PSC will be represented by a member of sufficient seniority to \nfacilitate direct briefings to his or her minister, committee chair, managing director, etc. BOL will \nalso  ensure  coordination  with  provincial  authorities.  The  PSC  will  meet  quarterly  to  review \nimplementation  progress  and  make  decisions  to  ensure  the  attainment  of  the  reform  agenda. \nEnglish translations of the minutes of these meetings will be forwarded to ADB within 2 weeks of \nthe meeting. \n \nBOL will be responsible for implementing the program and project components within its \n49. \nauthority  (i.e.,  the  enabling  policy  framework,  prudential  regulation,  MFI  supervision,  and \npromotion  of  a  diverse  and  competitive  private  sector).  BOL  will  establish  a  program \nimplementation  unit  (PIU)  and  assign  a  PIU  director  and  two  full-time  counterpart  staff  with \nqualifications and experience acceptable to ADB. The PMU and PIU directors in BOL may be the \nsame person. \n \n50. \nBecause  of  the  significance  of  the  APB  reform  program,  APB  will  be  the  implementing \nagency  (IA)  for  its  program  and  project  components  (i.e.,  APB  restructuring,  including \nimplementing  its  obligations  under  the  Governance  Agreement)  and  will  establish  its  own  PIU \nand assign a PIU director and four full-time counterpart staff with qualifications and experience \nacceptable  to  ADB.  Other  ministries,  committees,  agencies,  etc.  responsible  for  implementing \nnonprudential  reforms  will  each  establish  PIUs  and  appoint  a  PIU  director,  or  assign  the \nnecessary  staff,  to  coordinate  the  passage  of  the  reforms.  The  program  organization  is \npresented in Appendix 5. \n \n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f15 \n\nb. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n51. \nSeptember 2010. \n \n\nImplementation  will  last  for  4  years,  beginning  in  September  2006  and  ending  in \n\nc. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement  \n\n \n52. \nThe loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange costs of items produced \nand  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  (Appendix  6).  The \nGovernment will certify that (i) if the loan proceeds are used to finance goods already imported, \nthe  value  of  eligible  imports  in  the  period  concerned  will  exceed  the  amount  of  the  requested \nwithdrawal; or (ii) if the loan proceeds finance items to be imported, the value of eligible imports \nin the immediately preceding one-year period will be equal to or greater than the amount of the \nrequested withdrawal plus all other amounts expected to be withdrawn during the period. \n \n\nd. \n\nCounterpart Funds, Tranching, and Monitoring \n\n \n53. \nThe counterpart funds to be generated from the loan proceeds will finance local currency \ncosts  relating  to  program  implementation.  Any  counterpart  funds  not  required  for  the  Program \nwill  be  used  first  to  finance  the  local  currency  costs  of  other  projects  financed  by  ADB,  and \nsecond for general development purposes. \n \n54. \nThe proposed program loan will be released in three tranches. The first tranche of $2.7 \nmillion  equivalent  will  be  released  on  loan  effectiveness;  the  second  tranche  of  $2.5  million \nequivalent,  about  15  months  after  the  first  tranche;  and  the  third  tranche  of  $2.484  million \nequivalent, about 18 months after the second tranche, subject to compliance with the conditions \nfor their release.  \n \n55.  Monitorable  and  time-bound  actions  are  reflected  in  the  policy  matrix.  Both  the \nGovernment  and  ADB  will  regularly  and  closely  monitor  RFSDP  implementation.  Both  will \ncontinue  active  policy  dialogue  throughout  RFSDP  implementation  on  matters  relating  to  rural \nfinance  development,  and  will  pay  close  attention  to  the  poverty  impact  of  policy  reforms  and \nadjustment costs. Special audits and reviews will be conducted periodically. \n \n\ne. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \nThe use of the loan proceeds will be audited on ADB\u2019s request, and ADB will retain the \n56. \nright  to  (i)  audit  any  account,  and  (ii)  verify  the  validity  of  the  certification  issued  by  the \nGovernment  for  each  withdrawal  application.  Prior  to  withdrawal,  the  Government  will  open  a \ndeposit  account  at  BOL  to  receive  all  loan  proceeds.  The  Government  will  establish,  manage, \noperate,  and  liquidate  the  account  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursements  Handbook \n(January 2001) and on other terms satisfactory to ADB. The PIUs will submit quarterly progress \nreports to the PMU, as well as additional information and analysis to the PMU as appropriate or \nrequired. The PMU in turn will submit to the PSC and ADB quarterly progress reports on policy \nand institutional reform implementation. The reports will be submitted in such form and in such \ndetail  as  ADB  may  request,  and  should  include  (i)  progress  made  and  problems  encountered \nduring  the  period  in  review,  (ii)  steps  taken  or  proposed  to  be  taken  to  remedy  problems \nencountered,  (iii)  the  proposed  detailed  activity  for  RFSDP  implementation,  and  (iv)  expected \nprogress  during  the  next  quarter.  If  retrenchment  is  proposed  for  bank  staff  during  the \n\n \n\n\frestructuring  of  the  APB,  BOL  will  report  what  was  done  under  the  agreed-upon  retrenchment \nand  mitigation  plans.17  In  addition,  BOL  will  ensure  that  APB  will  have  its  accounts  audited \nannually  by  independent  and  competent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB,  with  signed  audits \nsubmitted  to  ADB  within  6  months  of  the  end  of  the  calendar  year.  At  the  minimum,  audited \nfinancial  statements  will  be  in  English  and  will  include  income  and  expenditures,  assets  and \nliabilities,  and  cash  flow,  with  the  accompanying  notes  to  the  accounts.  BOL  will  submit  a \nprogram completion report within 3 months of program completion. \n \n\nf. \n\nProgram Performance Management System \n\n \n57. \nBOL  will  establish  and  maintain  a  program  performance  management  system  that  will \ninclude  a  database  of  the  status  of  policy  reforms  and  program  indicators  based  on  the  policy \nmatrix, and the impact of policy reform measures at the sector and stakeholder levels, including \nresponse  and  performance  of  MFIs,  in  a  form  satisfactory  to  ADB.  This  will  be  linked  with  the \nproject performance management system discussed in para 77. \n \n\ng. \n\nProgram Review \n\n \n58. \nADB will monitor implementation through periodic reviews and progress reports. Annual \nreview missions will assess compliance with the program to ensure that program implementation \nremains  on  course.  At  the  end  of  the  second  year,  ADB  and  the  Government  will  jointly \nundertake  a  comprehensive  midterm  review  to  evaluate  the  progress  of  the  reform  measures \nand  their  impact  on  the  rural  finance  sector.  The  Government  will  make  the  necessary \ninformation  available  to  enable  ADB  to  conduct  the  reviews  and  will  keep  ADB  informed  of \noutcomes of policy discussions that have implications for RFSDP implementation. \n \nC. \n \n\nThe Project Loan \n\n1. \n\nObjectives \n\n \n59. \nThe  project  loan\u2019s  objective  is  to  promote  a  sustainable  and  market-oriented  rural  and \nmicrofinance  sector.  It  will  contribute  to  achievement  of  this  objective  by  assisting  the \nGovernment  to  (i)  build  BOL\u2019s  MFI  supervision  capacity,  (ii)  support  APB  to  complete  the \ncapacity building components of the APB Restructuring Plan begun under ADB TA cluster 3413 \n(footnote 11), and (iii) upgrade APB\u2019s ICT system. \n \n\n2. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\na. \n\nBuilding BOL\u2019s MFI Supervision Capacity \n\n \nBOL\u2019s Supervision Department is responsible for licensing, regulating, and supervising all \n60. \nfinancial institutions, but there is currently no supervision for MFIs. For commercial banks, BOL \ncarries out off-site monitoring and on-site inspection. BOL has been unable to effectively enforce \nbank  regulations  because  it  has  had  an  inadequate  number  of  supervisors  and  inadequate \ninformation for proper supervision. BOL recently began enforcing prudential regulations for state-\nowned  banks  and,  with  assistance  from  IMF,  is  increasing  staff  and  putting  in  place  new \nprocedures that will strengthen its capacity to supervise commercial banks. BOL recently created \n\n                                                 \n17  Retrenchment  is  not  expected.  However,  per  APB\u2019s  Governance  Agreement,  BOL  in  collaboration  with  APB  will \ndefine and adopt mitigating measures to be adopted in the case of retrenchment, consistent with the law of the Lao \nPDR. \n\n16 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f17 \n\na  microfinance  supervision  division,  with  4  staff  members  and  a  plan  to  expand  to  13  staff \nmembers.  BOL  needs  further  assistance  to  enhance  the  regulatory  and  supervisory  regime, \nimplement its provisions, and build supervision capacity for the MFI sector. This component will \nassist  BOL  to  (i)  create  a  sound  prudential  regulatory  and  supervisory  environment  for  MFIs, \n(ii) introduce  a  regulatory  and  supervisory  regime  for  the  private  and  public  sector  in  rural  and \nmicrofinance, and (iii) build MFI supervision capacity.  \n \n\nb. \n\nCapacity Building Under APB\u2019s Restructuring Plan \n\n \n61. \nThe  project  loan  will  finance  the  engagement  of  an  international  banking  advisor  (IBA) \nand  two  domestic  administrator/banking  assistants  (ABAs)  to  assist  APB  to  complete  the \nrestructuring program in accordance with the APB Governance Agreement. The IBA and ABAs \nwill assist to review, revise, develop, implement, and monitor modern banking policies, systems, \nand  procedures  that  will  allow  APB  management  to  make  commercially  oriented  banking \ndecisions  in  the  best  interests  of  APB.  The  IBA  and  ABAs  will  place  special  emphasis  on \nimproved  risk  management,  NPL  resolution,  and  credit  risks,  policies,  and  procedures  to  stop \nloss-making activities. In carrying out his/her specific duties, the IBA will coach and train APB\u2019s \ndirectors, management, and staff to build capacity in APB. \n \n62. \nAPB  will  also  receive  specialized  assistance  to  review  its  accounting  policies  and \nprocedures.  It  will  modify  and  document  in  manuals  its  policies  and  procedures  in  accordance \nwith the detailed recommendations of the diagnostic review carried out under subproject 2 of the \nTA  cluster  and  the  management  letters  from  its  recent  financial  audits.  APB  will  revise  and \ndocument  its  accounting  standards  and  amend  them  to  include  (i)  accounting  on  an  accruals \nbasis,  (ii)  identifying  and  transferring  NPLs  to  designated  overdue  ledger  accounts  on  a  timely \nbasis, (iii) writing off bad debts, (iv) adjusting reserves to reflect the net asset position, (v) making \nprovisions on guarantees and commitments for potential losses similar to any other extension of \ncredit, (vi) depreciating fixed assets over their estimated useful lives, (vii) valuing inventories at \nthe lower of cost and net realizable value, (viii) undertaking periodic stock counts and reconciling \nthese with accounting records, (ix) investigating discrepancies in stock count reconciliation, and \n(x) adopting full liability accounting for income taxes and deferred taxation.  \n \n\nc. \n\nUpgrading APB\u2019s ICT Systems \n\n \n63. \nA review of APB\u2019s current ICT system under ADB TA 3413 indicates that it needs to be \nreplaced. This was confirmed by the ICT Strategy for the Lao Banking Sector prepared by BOL, \nwith  the  assistance  of  the  European  Union.  These  reviews  found  that  APB\u2019s  current  ICT \nenvironment  does  not  adequately  provide  the  systems  needed  in  a  modern  bank.  Specifically, \n(i) there is a lack of vision and strategy for ICT development, and consequently no effective plan \nor  budget  provision;  (ii)  the  mandate  of  the  ICT  unit  is  not  clear  in  relation  to  its  strategic  and \nplanning  functions;  (iii)  the  systems  currently  in  use  at  APB  are  unable  to  provide  adequate \ncustomer  information,  making  risk  management  and  performance  assessment  difficult;  (iv)  the \ncurrent system does not give management sufficient information on the performance of products \nand  bank  units,  so  new  banking  products  and  services  can  be  developed  only  when  a \ncomprehensive  and  integrated  core  banking  system  is  in  place;  (v)  APB\u2019s  ICT  staff  capacity  is \ninadequate  for  APB\u2019s  current  and  future  needs;  (vi)  ICT  policy  and  procedures  are  not \ndocumented and not enforceable; (vii) ICT security is weak and there is no business continuity or \ndisaster recovery plan; (viii) software in many instances is not licensed and is thus unsupported; \n(ix) the current system is decentralized and has inadequate treasury capabilities; (x) much of the \ncurrent  MIS  is  manual  and  prone  to  error;  and  (xi)  connectivity  between  branches  is  weak  or \nnonexistent, with reports and data often physically ferried from subservice units to branches and \n\n \n\n\ffrom  branches  to  head  office.  Additionally,  shortcomings  in  the  management  reporting  system \nmake  it  of  limited  use  for  management  decision  making:  the  capacity  of  present  software  to \ngenerate reports is inadequate for management reporting; current reports are not differentiated \nby  user  or  management  level;  and  the  reporting  system  does  not  measure  bank  performance. \nMoreover, because APB has gone effectively unsupervised, the current system is inadequate to \nmeet  BOL  requirements  under  the  new  supervision  regime,  which  will  require  that  APB  be \ntreated as a commercial bank subject to full prudential supervision by BOL.  \n \nBuilding  on  a  diagnostic  study  of  APB\u2019s  ICT  system  under  the  TA  cluster,  ADB  project \n64. \npreparatory  TA  413518  to  prepare  the  rural  finance  development  loan  conducted  an  ICT  needs \nreview  and  formulated  an  ICT  development  plan  and  systems  design.19  Implementation  of  the \nplan will upgrade APB\u2019s hardware and software to provide for centralized online processing and \nthe  progressive  adoption  of  modules  for  modern  banking  products,  including  but  not  limited  to \nappropriate  loan  and  deposit  products,  payment  systems,  centralized  treasury  functions,  risk \nmanagement,  management  information,  and  human  resources  management.  The  RFSDP  will \nprovide for the total upgrade of APB\u2019s ICT systems in accordance with the plan.  \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nTable 2 is a summary of the project loan cost estimates. \n\n \nTable 2: Component Project Cost Summary \n  \n  \nCost \nLocal \nCurrency\n($) \n\n  \nCost \nForeign \nExchange\n($) \n\n  \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTotal \nCost \n($) \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n% \nForeign \nExchange\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n% Total\nBase \nCosts \n \n\n \n\nItem \n \n  \n   \nA.

The Borrower will be the Government \nof  the  Lao  PDR.  In  addition,  FIRST  will  finance  $0.281  million  equivalent  for  the  BOL  MFI \nsupervision strengthening component on a parallel grant cofinancing basis. The Government will \nfinance the balance of $0.761 million equivalent, including $0.265 million from APB. The loan will \nbe  from  the  Special  Funds  resources  with  a  maturity  of  32  years  including  a  grace  period  of 8 \nyears. The annual interest charge will be 1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter.

Specifically, the PIU in BOL will \nimplement  the  MFI  supervision  component.  APB  will  be  the  IA  for  its  program  and  project \ncomponents  (i.e.,  APB  restructuring  and  ICT  upgrading  components).  The  PIUs  will  coordinate \nthe fielding and work of the consultants, including provision of adequate office space and, in the \ncase of APB, the ICT turnkey contractor. The PMU will ensure submission of periodic reports by \nthe PIUs. The program organization diagram (Appendix 5) also covers project management. The \nproject loan will have the same steering committee as the program loan. The steering committee \nwill ensure that the project activities are undertaken according to the agreed upon timetable and \nmonitor progress. \n \n\nThe  project  loan  will  be  implemented  over  a  4-year  period,  September  2006\u2013\n\nb. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n69. \nSeptember 2010. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 8. \n \n\nc. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n70. \nGoods  and  services  will  be  procured  following  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines.  Equipment  and  services  will  be  procured  (i)  by  international  competitive  bidding \nwhere the cost is more than $500,000 equivalent, (ii) by limited international bidding where the \n\n \n\n \n\n\fcost is from $100,000 to $500,000 equivalent, or (iii) by national competitive bidding procedures \nor shopping where the cost is less than $100,000 equivalent and several local suppliers can offer \nsatisfactory service facilities. The procurement plan is presented in Appendix 9. \n \n\nd. \n\nConsulting Services \n\ninternational  consulting  services \n\n \nThe  component  for  building  up  BOL\u2019s  MFI  supervision  capacity  will  require  5.5  person-\n71. \nmonths  of \nfrom  an  MFI  regulation  and  supervision \nspecialist/team leader (4 person-months) and an accounting specialist (1.5 person-months); and \n9  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  from  a  bank  training  specialist  (6  person-\nmonths)  and  an  accounting  specialist  (3  person-months).  The  component  will  be  implemented \nover 12 months beginning in December 2006. As the component will be cofinanced by FIRST on \na  parallel  grant  basis,  consultants will  be  engaged  by  FIRST  in  accordance  with FIRST's  rules \nand  regulations  on  recruitment,  but  final  selection  will  be  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  terms  of \nreference of the consultants will be determined by an agreement between ADB and FIRST, and \nthe consultants will report to a steering committee comprising staff of BOL, ADB, and FIRST. All \nother key aspects of project administration will be coordinated between ADB and FIRST. \n \n72. \nFor  the  APB  restructuring  component,  42  person-months  of  international  consulting \nservices  will  be  provided  by  an  IBA  (36  person-months)  and  an  accounting  and  MIS  specialist \n(6 person-months);  and  72  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  will  be  provided  by \ntwo  ABAs  (36  person-months  each).  The  component  will  be  implemented  over  48  months \nbeginning in December 2006. Consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  following  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method.  The \nsimplified  technical  proposal  format  will  be  used.  Appendix  10  gives  the  consultants\u2019  terms  of \nreference and Appendix 9, the procurement plan. \n \n\ne. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements  \n\n \n73. \nEligible  expenditures  from  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  paid  either  through  direct  payment \nprocedure,  commitment  procedure,  and/or  imprest  fund  procedure  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLoan  Disbursement  Handbook  (January  2001),  as  amended  from  time  to  time.  Loan \ndisbursements  for  the  consulting  services  contracts  and  the  ICT  equipment  and  software \ncontract  will  make  use  of  the  direct  payment  procedure.  If  necessary,  the  Government  will \nestablish an imprest account for the PMU to manage, replenish, and liquidate in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook and any detailed arrangements between the Government \nand  ADB.  The  initial  amount  to  be  advanced  to  the  imprest  account  will  be  based  on  the \nestimated expenditures for 6 months, or $40,000, whichever is less. The ceiling on the imprest \naccount will be $100,000 and any individual payment will not exceed $10,000. The account will \nbe  established  with  BOL  or  a  reputable  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  PMU  will \nensure  proper  accounting  for  eligible  expenditures  incurred  and  paid  out  from  the  imprest \naccount.  PMU  will  also  ensure  that  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditures  (SOE)  procedure  will  be \nfollowed when liquidating and replenishing the account for all individual payments not exceeding \nthe equivalent of $10,000. \n \n\nf. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n74. \nThe  PMU  will  submit  quarterly  reports  to  ADB  on  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds,  project \nadministration,  and  financial  management.  The  reports,  consolidating  inputs  from  PIUs,  will \ncover  (i)  expenditures,  (ii)  activities  undertaken,  (iii)  highlights  of  audit  reports,  (iv)  training \nactivities  and  their  impact,  (v)  institutional  strengthening,  and  (vi)  progress  on  MFI  expansion. \n\n20 \n\n \n\n\f21 \n\nBOL  will  submit  a  project  completion  report  (PCR)  within  3  months  of  program  completion. \nQuarterly reports and the PCR will be combined with the quarterly reports and PCR on program \nloan implementation. APB will submit its annual independent audit reports, carried out according \nto IFRS, to BOL, MOF, and ADB. \n \n75. \nBOL and the IAs will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify goods \nand  services  financed  out  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  will  disclose  their  use  following  sound \naccounting  principles.  Such  accounts  and  records  will  be  audited  annually  by  auditors \nacceptable to ADB. Within 6 months of the close of the financial year, certified copies of the audit \nreport,  together  with  the  auditor\u2019s  opinion  will  be  submitted  to  the  Government  and  ADB.  The \naudit  reports  will  include  a  separate  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  SOE \nprocedure. \n \n76. \nADB's  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Government  and \nEA. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability and transparency, ADB \nreserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent, \ncollusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions of ADB's Anticorruption Policy are included in the Loan Regulations and the bidding \ndocuments  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the \nProject shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and \naccounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants  and other  service \nproviders as they relate to the Project. \n \n\ng. \n\nProject Performance Management System \n\n \n77. \nThe  PMU,  drawing  on  data  from  the  PIUs,  will  establish  and  maintain  a  project \nperformance  management  system  that  will  contribute  to  its  quarterly  reports.  The  information \nsystem will include (i) number of MFIs operating in the country; (ii) number  of  MFIs  operating  in \nethnic group areas; (iii) number of clients of APB and MFIs, broken down by gender and ethnic \nclassification;  and  (iv)  financial  and  efficiency  indicators  of  APB  and  MFIs.  Beyond  these \nindicators,  it  is  recognized  that  meaningfully  measuring  the  impact  of  rural  and  microfinance \nprograms  on  poverty  reduction,  income  generation,  consumption,  employment,  and  other \nindicators is a highly specialized research undertaking. Therefore, neither the PMU nor the PIUs \nwill  be  expected  to  undertake  such  an  impact  study.  However,  the  Government,  BOL,  and  the \nIAs agree to permit and support such a study if requested by ADB.20 \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n78. \nThe  TA  will  have  two  components:  (i)  a  program  management  component  to  assist  the \nGovernment  manage  and  carry  out  the  reform  agenda,  and  (ii)  an  APB  human  resources \ncomponent  to  assist  APB  to  implement  a  key  institutional  strengthening  component  of  its \nrestructuring  plan.  The  reform  agenda  is  complex,  and  the  program  requires  careful \nmanagement  to  ensure  a  consistent  and  coherent  approach.  Hence,  under  the  program \nmanagement  component,  the  TA  will  assist  BOL,  APB,  and  other  Government  ministries  and \nagencies to \n \n\n(i) \n\ncoordinate  and  integrate  rural  and  microfinance  policy  reforms  and  program \nimplementation; \n\n                                                 \n20  Methodological  issues  related  to  such  research  are  discussed  in  B.  Coleman,  \u201cThe  Impact  of  Group  Lending  in \n\nNortheast Thailand, \u201c Journal of Development Economics, October 1999. \n\n \n\n\f(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\ncarry  through  APB\u2019s  plan  to  phase  out  policy  lending,  the  loan  workout  plan \ninitiated  in  2003,  and  its  performance-based  recapitalization  to  ensure  its  full \ntransition to market-oriented operations; and \nformulate and document a simplified mechanism, policies, and procedures for on-\nbudget policy lending. \n\nThe  human  resources  component  of  the  TA  will  assist  APB  to  strengthen  its  human \n\n \n79. \nresources management under phase 2 of its restructuring plan. Specifically, it will assist APB to \n \n\ndevelop performance standards and a performance assessment system;  \nintroduce modifications to employee contracts to link them to job descriptions and \ncodes of practice;  \ndevise a new bonus scheme to reward individual excellence in job performance, \nas well as collective success in terms of the bank\u2019s profit per IFRS, based on the \nnew job descriptions and performance assessment system; and  \ndevelop and deliver the training courses outlined in the training plan prepared in \nphase 1. \n\n \n80. \nThe  TA  will  begin  in  December  2006  and  will  be  implemented  over  48  months  ending \nDecember  2010.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  $820,000.  ADB\u2019s  funding  program  will  contribute \n$400,000  for  the  program  management  component,  consisting  of  $375,000  of  the  foreign \nexchange cost and $25,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government of Denmark \nwill contribute $300,000 for the APB human resources component, comprising $191,900 of the \nforeign exchange cost and $108,100 equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government will \nfinance the balance of the local currency cost.  \n \n81. \nInternational consulting services totaling 16 person-months will be provided by a financial \nsector  reform  specialist/team  leader  (5  person-months),  a  bank  restructuring  specialist \n(3 person-months),  a  corporate  planning  specialist  (2  person-months),  and  a  human  resources \nspecialist  (6  person-months).  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. All equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines.  A  full  description  of  the  TA,  including  implementation  arrangements, \noutline terms of reference, cost estimates, and financing plan, is in Appendix 11. \n \n\nV. \n\nTHE JAPAN FUND FOR POVERTY REDUCTION GRANT \n\n \nIn association with RFSDP, a grant of $1.98 million was approved by JFPR for catalyzing \n82. \nmicrofinance  for  the  poor.  This  project  will  provide  grant  funds  for  eligible  MFIs  though  a \nMicrofinance  Fund  (MFF).  The  MFF  will  support  initiatives  by  MFIs  in  the  Lao  PDR  that  will \n(i) contribute  directly  or  indirectly  to  improved  incomes,  livelihoods,  and  opportunities  for  poor \npeople;  (ii)  involve  a  product,  service,  system  or  procedure  that  is  innovative  and  would  be \nunlikely  to  be  addressed  without  the  support  of  the  MFF;  (iii)  result  (directly  or  indirectly)  in \nincreased  access  to  financial  services  by  the  poor;  (iv)  be  sustainable,  or  result  in  sustainable \nimpact,  after  an  MFF  grant  has  been  utilized;  (v)  share  resource  costs  required  for \nimplementation between the MFF and the MFI; (vi) be implemented within 3 years, other than in \nexceptional circumstances; and (vii) not create unfair competition or otherwise distort markets.  \n \n83. \nParticipating  MFIs  will  be  privately  owned  by  members  or  shareholders  and  provide \nmarket-driven financial services. Members or shareholders will be drawn from local communities \nand  include  women,  small-scale  entrepreneurs,  farmers,  government  employees,  youth,  and \npeople from households of differing income levels. MFIs will comprise mainly savings and credit \n\n22 \n\n \n\n\f23 \n\nunions (SCUs), village banks, and village savings and credit groups (VSCGs), but any institution \nthat  meets  the  specified  criteria  will  be  eligible  to  apply  for  a  grant.  Grants  will  be  awarded \nthrough  a  competitive  process  that  will  rank  proposals  according  to  their  poverty  impact,  the \nextent  of  private  sector  resources  mobilized,  the  ability  of  the  applicant  to  deliver  the  intended \noutputs, innovation, sustainability, and replicability.  \n \n84. \nGrants  will  be  used  to  provide  start-up  support  to  new  and  transforming  private  MFIs, \nincluding  support  to  pilot-test  new  institutions  and  innovative  models  that  provide  flexible \nservices  suited  to  the  poor,  and  consolidating  currently  unsustainable  VSCGs  into  larger  local \nMFIs (e.g., SCUs or village bank networks). This support will take the form of matching grants for \nseed capital, start-up costs, equipment, training, and capacity building, and the MFI will have to \ncontribute an amount of its own capital equal to the grant from the MFF. Eligible MFIs will include \nnew MFIs seeking to establish themselves on a sustainable basis, and existing MFIs that wish to \ntransform unsustainable practices into sustainable best practices. Conditioned on the submission \nof  a  business  plan  or  institutional  development  plan  that  focuses  on  sustainability  and  best \npractice,  preference  will  be  given  to  MFI  applicants  that  target  women  and/or  ethnic  group \ncommunities,  are  located  in  poor  remote  areas  of  the  Lao  PDR,  and/or  are  supported  by  an \ninternational donor or development partner.21  \n \n85. \nIn  addition  to  providing  grants,  the  MFF  will  undertake  a  range  of  other  activities.  They \nwill include (i) workshops to promote the industry and best practice in microfinance; (ii) activities \nto  promote  the  concept of  financial  intermediation  between  MFIs  and  the  development  of  such \nintermediation;  (iii)  training  for  MFIs  in  key  management  functions  (for  example:  governance, \naccounting,  information  systems,  credit  assessment);  (iv)  assistance  to  MFIs  in  preparing \ninstitutional development  plans;  and  (v)  preparation  of  terms  of  reference  for  a  feasibility  study \nand prospectus for a national-level MFI.  \n \n86. \nThe  total  cost  is  estimated  at  $2,858,000.  JFPR  will  finance  $1.98  million,  the \nGovernment will finance $78,000, and participating MFIs or their sponsors will provide matching \ncontributions  of  $800,000.  BOL  will  be  the  EA.  International  consulting  services  of  46  person-\nmonths will be provided by a microfinance specialist (12 person-months), an accounting and MIS \nspecialist  (3  person-months),  a  legal  specialist  (1  person-month)  and  a  management  assistant \n(30 person-months); and domestic consulting services of 53 person-months will be provided by \ntwo microfinance specialists (for 25 person-months each) and an accounting specialist (3person-\nmonths).  ADB  will  recruit  the  consultants  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants.  All  procurement  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Procurement \nGuidelines. The component will be implemented over 36 months beginning in January 2007.

APB\u2019s  ICT  upgrade  will  be \ncarried  out  on  a  turnkey  basis.  In  preparation  for  the  procurement,  installation,  and \nimplementation  of  the  new  ICT  systems,  the  internal  ICT  function  of  APB  will  need  to  be \n                                                 \n21 To complement the JFPR-funded activities, ADB is also processing a separate TA to enhance the role of the Lao \n\nWomen\u2019s Union as social intermediaries in organizing women into microfinance groups. \n\n \n\n\fsubstantially strengthened. APB will receive assistance from a JFICT grant for internal capacity \nbuilding and managing the turnkey contract. Specifically, JFICT will assist APB to (i) upgrade its \nICT human resources capacity to manage the ICT systems upgrade; (ii) review and confirm that \nthe  systems  specifications  proposed  are  adequate  for  APB\u2019s  needs;  (iii)  plan  and  execute  the \nbidding, selection, and contracting processes with the turnkey contractor and the communication \ninfrastructure provider; (iv) monitor the turnkey installation and milestone achievement, verify that \nspecifications have been adhered to, review data migration plans, and carry out user acceptance \ntesting;  (v)  prepare  and  carry  out  a  training  plan;  (vi)  review  and  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of \ntechnical  and  operational  training  provided  under  the  turnkey  contract;  and  (vii)  plan  and \nimplement the rollout of systems to the whole APB branch network.  \n \n88. \nThe total cost is estimated at $520,400 equivalent. JFICT will finance $472,000, and the \nGovernment will finance $48,400 equivalent. APB will act as EA. A total of 11 person-months of \nconsulting  services  from  an  international  ICT  systems  specialist  (5  person-months)  and  a \ndomestic  ICT  systems  specialist  (6  person-months)  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  following  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nmethod. All procurement will be conducted in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines. A \nsummary  description  of  the  JFICT  program,  including  its  cost  estimates,  financing  plan, \nimplementation  arrangements,  poverty  reduction \nin \nAppendix 13. \n \n\nimpact,  and  benefits  and  risks, \n\nis \n\nVII. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits \n\n \nA. \n \n89. \nAt  a  macroeconomic  level,  the  Program  will  establish  a  broad-based  but  integrated \nframework  for  market-oriented  reforms  in  the  rural  finance  sector  and  result  in  a  deepened \nfinancial  sector  and  greater  financial  intermediation.  This  will  in  turn  result  in  a  more  efficient \nallocation  of  resources.  The  promotion  of  savings  through  the  removal  of  policy  lending  from \nAPB and its concurrent savings mobilization effort as part of its restructuring plan, as well as the \ndevelopment  of  deposit-taking  MFIs  will  contribute  to  this  process.  The  phasing  out  of  policy \nlending  from  APB  will  enable  the  Government  to  realize  much-needed  budgetary  savings;  and \nthe  transfer  of  residual  policy  lending,  if  any,  to  an  on-budget  mechanism  will  increase \ntransparency and improve monitoring, thus enabling the Government to better assess the costs \nand  benefits  of  such  lending.  Indirectly,  the  stimulus  to  enterprise  created  through  enhanced \noutreach of credit will result in increased investment, job creation, and\u2013through the formal sector \nenterprises  that  will  benefit\u2013an  increase  in  tax  revenues  for  the  Government.  The  additional \navailability of capital also has the potential to add to export revenues where it is channeled into \nthe  specific  identified  opportunities  for  increasing,  for  example,  agricultural  and  handicraft \nexports. The increased outreach of savings services will encourage monetization. \n \n90.  Microfinance  providers  and  sponsors  will  benefit  from  the  Government\u2019s  adoption  of  an \nenabling  and  transparent  regulatory  and  supervisory  regime  and  will  be  able  to  operate  with \nconfidence,  with  the  added  certainty  about  the  operating  environment\u2019s  encouragement  of \ninvestment.  The  formalization  of  the  microfinance  sector  will  act  as  a  stimulus  to  private \ninvestment in the sector. \n \n91. \nFarmers, rural people in general and rural enterprises will benefit from improved access \nto  savings  services  that  will  provide  a  safe  and  readily  accessible  means  to  store  and \naccumulate  capital,  and  from  increased  access  to  working  capital  and  investment  funding. \nIncome benefits will accrue through intensification and expansion of production and acquisition \n\n24 \n\n \n\n\f25 \n\nImpacts \n\nof new technology. Low-income households will have improved ability to manage risks owing to \nimproved  access  to  both  credit  and  institutional  savings  facilities.  Business  start-up  and \nexpansion will lead to job creation for both the self-employed and wage earners.  \n \nB. \n \n92. \nThe  Program  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  vision  of  a  deepened  financial  sector  that \n(i) fosters broad-based sustainable economic growth and contributes to macroeconomic stability \nand  poverty  reduction  to  help  the  Lao  PDR  graduate  from  least  developed  country  status  by \n2020,  (ii)  is  comprised  of  strong  bank  and  nonbank  institutions  that  efficiently  allocate  the \ncountry\u2019s  resources  to  the  most  productive  investments  and  income-generating  activities,  and \n(iii) is  diversified  and  provides  wide  access  to  financial  services  through  extensive  market \noutreach. \n \n\n1. \n\nImpact  of  Creating  an  Enabling  Policy  Framework  for  Public  and  Private \nProvision of Rural and Microfinance \n\n \n93. \nThe  program  will  for  the  first  time  create  a  formal  national  policy  framework  for  the \ndevelopment of rural and microfinance in the Lao PDR. This will move the sector\u2019s development \naway from an ad hoc project approach toward a coherent national strategy that provides short-, \nmedium- and long-term direction, has been participatory in its formulation and formalization, and \nwill  remain  participatory  in  its  implementation.  This  formal  foundation  will  create  an  enabling \nenvironment for the deepening of the rural and microfinance sector and will encourage domestic \nprivate participation in the sector. \n \n\n2. \n\nImpact  of  Creating  a  Sound  Prudential  Regulatory  and  Supervisory \nEnvironment for Public and Private Rural and Microfinance Institutions \n\n \nA  sound  prudential  regulatory  and  supervisory  environment  will  create  greater \n94. \ntransparency  in  the  financial  sector  generally  and  in  APB  and  MFIs  in  particular.  Creating \ntransparency  in  APB\u2019s  financial  affairs  will  improve  APB\u2019s  overall  governance,  planning, \noperations, and  risk  management.  Ensuring  that  APB  is  properly  regulated  and  supervised  will \nprovide  added  protection  to  APB\u2019s  depositors  and  build  confidence  in  APB  as  a  deposit-taking \ninstitution, allowing it to grow in a market-oriented way in a competitive environment. Regulating \nMFIs will, for the first time in the Lao PDR, provide a full legal basis for the establishment and \ngrowth  of  privately  owned  MFIs.  These  measures  together  with  the  development  of  MFI \nsupervisory capacity in BOL will remove the present legal and regulatory uncertainties that have \nbeen cited as the major reason for the lack of investment in the sector. Introducing the new legal \nand  regulatory  regime  will  create  the  opportunity  for  financial  intermediation  in  the  MFI  sector. \nCollectively these measures will enhance the safety and soundness of the financial sector. \n \n\n3. \n\nImpact  of  Transforming  APB  into  a  Financially  Self-Sustainable,  Market-\nOriented Rural Finance Institution  \n\n \nThe  transformation  of  APB  from  a  bank  that  acts  as  a  channel  for  loss-making  policy \n95. \nlending into a market-oriented bank that operates on a commercial basis will result in extending \nAPB\u2019s  outreach  as  it  expands  its  deposit-based  business  and  relies  less  on  the  resource-\nconstrained  Government  budget.  It  will  also  (i)  improve  efficiency  in  APB\u2019s  operations  as  it \ncomes under pressure to compete for resources; (ii) strengthen APB\u2019s management autonomy; \nand  (iii)  improve  APB\u2019s  currently  weak  credit  culture,  reduce  NPL  levels,  reduce  losses,  and \nhence  reduce  the  fiscal  burden  that  APB  places  on  the  Government.  Based  on  historic \n\n \n\n\fperformance, there will be fiscal savings of about $1 million per year; with losses accelerating in \nrecent  years,  the  likely  impact  will  be  significantly  more  than  $1  million  per  year  in  the  future. \nAPB\u2019s  transformation  will  also  remove  some  of  the  distortionary  impacts  created  by  its \nsubsidized  lending  operations:  low  deposit  mobilization,  crowding  out  of  MFIs  and  other  banks \nfrom  areas  where  its  subsidized  lending  programs  have  operated,  and  unrealistic  expectations \nregarding sustainable interest rates. \n \n\n4. \n\nImpact of Creating a Supportive Nonprudential Regulatory Environment for \nRural and Microfinance \n\n \n96. \nImprovements in the business environment for MFIs will reduce their transactions costs, \nenhance  their  profitability,  and  ensure  a  fair  and  transparent  operating  environment,  thus \nencouraging investment and outreach.  \n \n\n5. \n\nSocial and Poverty Impacts \n\n \nThe  RFSDP  is  expected  to  have  a  positive  social  impact  by  strengthening  the  rural \n97. \nfinance  sector  and  promoting  sustainable  delivery  of  financial  services  in  rural  areas.  The \nimproved  policy  and  regulatory  environment  supporting  rural  and  microfinance  institutions  will \npromote  the  establishment  and  operation  of  sustainable  microfinance  and  other  rural  financial \ninstitutions,  including  those  established  by  the  private  sector  and  international  development \nagencies.  These  institutions  will  provide  the  rural  poor  with  alternative  and  more  affordable \noptions compared with informal sources, which typically charge interest rates of 10% per month \nor  higher.  The  RFSDP  will  foster  demand-driven,  sustainable  rural  financial  services. \nInternational  experience  shows  that  the  poor  are  willing  to pay  market  interest  rates  and  value \nsustained  access  more  than  a  subsidized  interest  rate.  Developing  a  market-oriented  rural \nfinancial system is therefore the best way to provide the poor with access to affordable financial \nservices. Sustained access to financial services will enable the rural poor to (i) invest in, and take \nadvantage  of,  opportunities  in  farm  and  nonfarm  income-generating  activities;  (ii)  finance \nhousehold  emergencies  and  consumption;  and  (iii)  accumulate  savings  in  secure  deposit \nfacilities. The MFF, which will pilot and promote best-practice MFIs serving a diverse population, \nwill  give  preference  to  supporting  sustainable  microfinance  initiatives  that  benefit  women  and \nethnic  groups.  The  RFSDP  is  in  line  with  the  NGPES,  approved  by  the  National  Assembly  in \nOctober  2003,  which  identifies  access  to  rural  finance  as  critical  to  reducing  poverty  and \npromoting economic growth.  \n \nRestructuring  APB  into  a  financially  self-sustainable,  market-oriented  rural  finance \n98. \ninstitution will have both direct and indirect positive social benefits. Directly, APB\u2019s transformation \nwill  enable  it  to  increase  outreach  and  contribute  to  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  in \nthe  Lao  PDR.  International  and  Lao  experience  have  shown  that  the  non-poor  are  the  primary \nbeneficiaries of subsidized credit because they have better access and can absorb larger loans \nand,  therefore,  larger  subsidies.  APB\u2019s  nonsubsidized,  demand-driven  expansion  is  therefore \nexpected  to  benefit  the  poor  disproportionately.  Indirectly,  phasing  out  directed  lending  and \ninterest rate subsidies from APB will free up scarce resources in the Government budget, which \ncan contribute to better-targeted poverty interventions and reductions in the Government deficit, \nthus contributing to macroeconomic stability. If some residual policy lending is shifted to an on-\nbudget  nonbanking  mechanism,  the  enhanced  transparency  will  allow  policy  makers  to  better \nassess the costs and benefits of such lending. \n \n99. \nBased  on  the  poverty  and  social  impact  assessment,  no  persons  will  be  negatively \naffected  in  terms  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  indigenous \n\n26 \n\n \n\n\f27 \n\npeople; thus, the RFSDP will not trigger activities to implement these ADB policies. The issue of \npossible  labor  retrenchment  due  to  APB  restructuring  was  reviewed.  Based  on  existing \ninformation about APB\u2019s current and future labor requirements, no retrenchment is likely to take \nplace. Staff will be trained to ensure that they may effectively contribute to the operation of the \nrestructured  APB.  According  to  the  BOL  guidelines  and  existing  human  resource  management \npractices  of  other  SOCBs,  any  overstaffing  issues  at  APB  will  be  addressed  through  natural \nattrition  (retirement,  transfers,  and  voluntary  resignation).  If  during  RFSDP  implementation \nsignificant retrenchment is deemed necessary based on new APB business projections, APB will \nprepare  a  mitigation  plan  to  be  funded  by  MOF,  per  the  Governance  Agreement.  Appendix  14 \ngives the summary poverty reduction and social strategy.  \n \n\n6. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\nRisks \n\n \n100.  A review of the policy interventions under the RFSDP indicates that they will not have any \ndirect adverse environmental impact. The appraisal of potential income-generating activities that \nmay  be  funded  through  APB  or  the  MFIs  receiving  assistance  from  MFF  indicates  that  these \nfarm and nonfarm activities are not likely to result in significant environmental impact. To ensure \nthat  no  adverse  impact  results  at  the  micro  level,  APB  and  MFIs  will  be  required  to  adhere  to \nsound  environmental  lending  practices  and  ensure  that  their  lending  operations  are  consistent \nwith  existing  environmental  laws  and  regulations.  For  this  purpose,  training  on  sound \nenvironmental lending practices is incorporated in RFSDP activities. The environmental impacts \nof policy intervention are reviewed in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \nC. \n \n101.  The  successful  implementation  and  impact  of  the  RFSDP  will  depend  on  several \nassumptions  that  are  subject  to  varying  degrees  of  risk.  Mitigating  measures  have  been  put  in \nplace where appropriate and possible. \n \n102.  Political  Commitment  to  Reform,  and  Timely  Implementation  of  Reforms.  The  lack \nof  sustained  Government  commitment  to  a  market-oriented  rural  finance  sector  is  a  significant \nrisk, as is the possibility of implementation delays. However, the Government has reiterated its \ncommitment on several occasions and in several key policy and strategy documents in the past \n3  years  \u2013  the  Policy  Statement  on  Development  of  a  Sustainable  Rural  and  Micro  Finance \nSector  (endorsed  by  PMO  in  November  2003),  the  National  Growth  and  Poverty  Eradication \nStrategy  (endorsed  by  the  National  Assembly  in  October  2003),  and  the  Strategy  and  Action \nPlan to Develop Sustainable Rural and Microfinance (in final draft stage and to be issued by BOL \nas a first-tranche RFSDP policy action). In addition, the design process has included extensive \nawareness  creation  and  consultation  with  stakeholders,  supported  by  ADB  TA  3413  (footnote \n12)  since  October  2000,  including  (i)  policy  awareness  workshops  and  study  tours  for  senior \npolicy  makers,  and  the  Government\u2019s  agreement  to  reform  recommendations  in  the  ensuing \nRural  and  Microfinance  Policy  Issues  Paper;  (ii)  an  in-depth  diagnostic  study  of  APB  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s  agreement  with  its  findings;  (iii)  approval  by  the  Government  of  the  feasibility \nstudy and the business plans for three member-owned pilot SCUs, and the subsequent issuance \nof licenses for the pilot SCUs; (iv) the Government\u2019s approval and the APB Board\u2019s adoption of \nthe  APB  restructuring  plan  and  new  market-oriented  corporate  mission  for  APB;  (v)  the \nGovernment\u2019s  agreement  to  phase  out  interest  rate  subsidies  and  directed  lending  from  APB; \nand  (vi)  the  Government\u2019s  approval  of  new,  best  practice  regulations  for  SCUs  and  MFIs. \nThroughout this 3-year process, there has been a continuous and progressive dialogue between \nthe  Government,  ADB,  and  other  stakeholders  in  the  sector,  including  PMO,  BOL,  APB,  MOF, \nCommittee  for  Planning  and  Cooperation,  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Forestry  (MAF), \n\n \n\n\fcommercial  banks,  microfinance  practitioners,  mass  organizations,  NGOs,  and  other  agencies \nsuch  as  the  World  Bank  and  IMF.  Implementation  will  involve  the  same  stakeholders  and  will \nengage  them  through  a  formal  consultative  framework.  Effective  policy  dialogue,  stakeholder \ncoordination,  and  capacity-building  support  through  project  components  and  the  TA  are \nsafeguards for smooth implementation of policy reforms. Public awareness of the benefits from \nthe reforms will further mitigate the possible risk of delays in policy reforms. To expedite reforms, \nthe RFSDP supports institutional strengthening and performance-based recapitalization for APB. \n \n103.  Fiscal Management. The estimated cost of implementing the Program is $19.2 million. \nThe  amount  represents  the  direct  costs  of  policy  reforms  and  related  investments,  including \n(i) creating an enabling policy framework ($1.5 million); (ii) creating a sound prudential regulatory \nand  supervisory  environment  that  includes  BOL  strengthening  ($1.6  million);  (iii)  creating  a \nfinancially  self-sustainable,  market-oriented  APB,  including  institutional  strengthening,  ICT \nupgrade, and recapitalization ($13.6 million, of which $8.1 million represents recapitalization);22 \nand  (iv)  creating  a  supportive  nonprudential  regulatory  environment  ($0.2  million).  This  cost \npotentially  represents  a  burden  on  budgetary  resources  and  management  capacity  of  the \nGovernment. However, a number of mitigating measures have been put in place to reduce this \nrisk. In terms of budgetary resources, grant cofinancing amounting to $6.5 million from  various \nsources  has  been  mobilized  to  assist  in  financing  the  program.23  The  Government  will  finance \nthe remaining $12.7 million, of which $10 million will be covered by the ADB program and project \nloans.  Much  of  the  remaining  $2.7  million  takes  the  form  of  in-kind  contributions  from  the \nGovernment, such as staff time. \n \n104.  To  mitigate  the  risks  of  fiscal  management,  ADB,  IMF  and  World  Bank  have  supported \nthe Government in improving its financial management. ADB TA 3627 has provided support for \nthe  financial  management  processes  covering  capital  revenue  and  expenditures.  It  included \nimprovements  to  the  capital  expenditure  chart  of  accounts,  internal  controls  over  financial \ntransactions, recording, and reporting. TA 3771 is providing institutional and capacity support to \nthe  State  Audit  Office.  It  introduces  financial  audit  manuals  and  procedures  based  on \nInternational Office for Supreme Audit Institutions standards and best practices. ADB TAs 3309 \nand 4180 provide support to improve internal auditing, recording, and reporting for the financial \nmanagement  systems  for  recurrent  revenue  and  expenditure.  IMF's  Poverty  Reduction  and \nGrowth  Facility  (PRGF)  has  provided  support,  in  cooperation  with  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment  Programme  (UNDP),  to  simplify  revenue  collection  procedures  for  customs  and \nduties.  IMF  is  also  providing  TA  to  support  the  Treasury  Department  in  revising  the  chart  of \naccounts  to  improve  control  over  bank  accounts  and  cash  management.  The  Swedish \nInternational  Development  Agency  (Sida)  is  providing  support  on  taxation.  The  World  Bank  is \nproviding assistance to the fiscal budget processes, including development of a revised budget \nnomenclature.  MOF  will  track  the  fiscal  impact  of  the  program  through  its  medium-term  fiscal \nframework. \n \n105.  Participation  of  the  Private  Sector.  A  major  constraint  to  private  participation  in  the \nrural  and  microfinance  sector  has  been  an  unclear  and  adverse  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory \nframework. While this framework has recently been improved substantially, private investors and \n\n                                                 \n22 The ADB Banking Sector Reform Program Loan, approved in November 2002, included a preliminary estimate of \nAPB  recapitalization  costs  of  $2.5  million,  operational  restructuring  costs  of  $850,000,  and  ICT  upgrade  costs  of \n$1.5 million (for a total of $4.85 million). \n\n23  This  includes  $2  million  from  TA  cluster  3413-LAO;  $400,000  from  the  associated  Program  Management  TA; \n$150,000  from  PPTA  4135-LAO;  and  $3.42  million  from  cofinanciers  since  2002,  including  Concern  Worldwide, \nFIRST, Government of Denmark, Swedish International Development Agency (Sida), and the World Bank. \n\n28 \n\n \n\n\f29 \n\ninternational donors and development partners may still adopt a \u201cwait and see\u201d attitude to assess \nthe  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  effective  implementation  of  the  new  framework.  The  RFSDP \nhas  put  in  place  at  least  two  mitigating  measures.  First,  policy  dialogue  and  stakeholder \ncoordination (through a regime of semiannual consultations with sector stakeholders) and public \nawareness  campaigns  (through  the  MFF)  will  provide  forums  through  which  investor  concerns \ncan be aired and addressed. Second, the MFF will directly catalyze investment in the sector by \nproviding TA and start-up grants to private MFIs that demonstrate a commitment to sustainable \nprovision of microfinance services to the poor.  \n \n\nVIII.  ASSURANCES \n\n \n106. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\nThe  Government  will  promptly  adopt  and  implement  in  a  timely  manner  the \npolicies  and  program  actions  indicated  in  the  Program  as  specified  in  the  policy \nletter,  including  the  policy  matrix,  and  will  ensure  that  such  policies  and  actions \nare sustained.  \nThe Government will actively assist and support ongoing program monitoring and \nevaluation  by  facilitating  consultations  with  central  and  provincial  agencies,  and \nother key stakeholders as appropriate.  \nThe  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with  other \nstakeholders about measures to ensure effective implementation of the Program.  \nThe  Government  will  give  ADB  the  opportunity  to  comment  on  relevant  studies \nand  draft  laws  or  decrees  that  are  likely  to  impact  on  program  objectives  and \nimplementation.  \nThe Government will ensure that adequate and timely funds are made available to \nBOL  and  relevant  central  agencies  and  provincial  administrations  to  facilitate \nimplementation of the Program. \nThe Government will support BOL in licensing, supervising, and regulating MFIs, \nand will ensure that adequate funds are provided to BOL in a timely and efficient \nmanner to ensure its successful functioning. \nThe  Government  will  promptly  inform  ADB  of  any  changes  in  the  board  of \ndirectors  or  senior  management  of  APB  and  will  ensure  that  any  such  changes \nare made in accordance with the provisions of the Governance Agreement. \n\nIX. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n107. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove \n \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 5,143,000 to \nthe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Rural Finance Sector Development \nProgram from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate \nof 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term \nof  24  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft \nProgram Loan Agreement presented to the Board;  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n \n21 July 2006 \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 1,550,000 to \nthe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Rural Finance Sector Development \nProject from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of \n1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of \n32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft \nProject Loan Agreement presented to the Board; and \n\nthe  administration  by  ADB  of  assistance  in  an  amount  not  exceeding  the \nequivalent  of  $1,980,000  to  the  Government  of  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic \nRepublic  for  Catalyzing  Microfinance  for  the  Poor  to  be  provided  by  the  Japan \nFund for Poverty Reduction on a grant basis. \n\n \n \n \n\nLiqun Jin \nVice President \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n31 \n\nSECTOR ANALYSIS \n\n \n1. \nThe  rural  and  microfinance  sector  in  Lao  PDR  is  at  an  embryonic  stage.  The  principle \nprovider of rural financial services is the state-owned Agriculture Promotion Bank (APB), which \nwas  created  in  1993  as  a  policy  bank  to  deliver  subsidized  credit  to  the  agriculture  sector.  Its \noutreach  has  been  limited  to  about  15%  of  the  population  because  it  depends  on  the  limited \nfunding  available  from  the  Government  and  donors  and  because  its  policies,  inefficient  and \nsubsidized  operations,  and  weak  financial  condition  prevent  it  from  mobilizing  commercial \nfunding. Very few microfinance institutions exist because of a historically unfavorable policy and \nregulatory  environment  as  well  as  high  transactions  costs  due  to  a  dispersed  population  and \npoor infrastructure. \n \nRural  Economy.  The  population  of  Lao  PDR  is  estimated  at  5.5  million.  The  rural \n2. \npopulation comprises 80% of the total population, but 90% of the poor live in rural areas. Overall \nthe  population  is  growing  at  about  2.3%  per  year,  but  rural  to  urban  migration  has  resulted  in \nurban population growth of about 4.7% per year and rural population growth of about 1.8% per \nyear.1 \n \n3. \nThe contribution of the agricultural sector to GDP was 51% in 2002. Crops contributed \n30%, livestock and fisheries 17%, and forestry 4% of total GDP. Agricultural GDP grew by an \naverage of 5% per annum during the 1990s.2 The agricultural sector is characterized by several \nfarming systems. Flatland rain-fed and irrigated farming systems are found close to the Mekong \nRiver and its tributaries. In these areas, cultivated land is used for lowland rice production in the \nwet  season  and  for  livestock  grazing  in  the  dry  season.  Upland  farming  systems  are \ncharacterized  by  slash  and  burn  practices,  and  are  dominated  by  a  single  wet  season  crop, \nmainly upland rice, but including maize in some areas. The gathering of forest products provides \nsupplementary  food  and  firewood.  Cattle,  pigs,  and  poultry  are  raised  under  extensive \nhusbandry  systems.  The  plateau \nthe  Bolovens  plateau \n(encompassing  parts  of  Attapeu,  Champasack,  and  Sekong  provinces)  and  in  two  further \nplateau areas in Khammouane and Xieng Khouang provinces. Under this system, commercial \ncrops  are  increasingly  produced,  including  cardamom,  coffee,  fruit,  and  vegetables.  Cash \nincome  from  the  sale  of  these  crops  is  used  to  purchase  rice  grown  in  the  lowlands  to \nsupplement  home  production.  Cattle  are  an  important  part  of  this  farming  system  and  are \ngrazed  on  the  plains  and  in  the  forests.  The  mountain  farming  system  operates  in  remote \nvillages. The system is based on slash and burn cultivation of upland rice on mountain slopes \nwith  little  or  no  production  surplus.  A  wide  variety  of  other  crops  are  incorporated  into  the \nsystem,  including  cassava,  groundnut,  maize,  mung bean,  soybean,  fruit,  vegetables  and \nopium. The latter, despite pressure to abandon the crop, still generates important cash income. \nLivestock  are  an  important  part  of  the  system,  are  more  intensively  managed  than  other \nsystems in Lao PDR, benefiting from the feeding of crop by-products to supplement grazing.  \n \n4. \nLivestock  are  found  on  most  farms  in  the  Lao PDR  with  89%  of  all  farm  households \nraising one or more livestock types.3 Livestock sales account for more than 50% of cash income \nin  many  upland  and  mountain  areas.  Agribusiness  has  begun  to  develop  in  the  Mekong \nCorridor,  particularly  near  Vientiane  and  some  borders  areas.  The  majority  of  Lao  PDR \n                                                 \n1   World Bank. 2003. World Development Indicators Database. Washington, DC. \n2   World Bank. 2003. World Development Indicators Database. Washington, DC. It should be noted that major annual \nvariations in output have occurred because of the country\u2019s dependence on rain-fed agriculture. While overall the \ncountry is self-sufficient in food, some remote areas still face significant seasonal food shortages. \n\nfarming  system \n\nfound  on \n\nis \n\n3   ADB. 2001. Review of the Livestock in Lao PDR. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nagribusinesses are small cottage industries employing 2 to 5 persons. In 2000, there were about \n470  registered  agribusinesses,  and  many  more  unregistered,  including  enterprises  involved  in \nbaking,  canning  and  preserving,  coffee  roasting  and  packaging,  milk  products,  noodle \nmanufacture,  oil  seed  processing,  rice  milling,  saw  milling  and  wood  industries,  slaughtering, \nsoy sauce manufacture, and textiles.4 \n \n5. \nThere  are  significant  opportunities  for  agricultural  and  rural  enterprise  development. \nLao PDR  lies  at  the  center  of  a  rapidly  expanding  regional  economy  that  offers  a  regional \nmarket  with  some  200  million  people.  Given  its  resource  base,  location,  and  potential  cost \nadvantages, the agricultural sector is well placed to benefit from growing regional prosperity and \nthe  increasing  demand  for  food  and  other  agricultural  products  in  Lao PDR  and  adjoining \ncountries.  \n \n6. \nRecent  research  that  examined  competitive  advantage  with  neighboring  countries  of \nselected  agricultural  crops  (rice,  maize,  soybean,  coffee,  and  cotton)  indicates  that  with  the \nbacking  of  research  and  efficiently  run  agricultural  support  services,  there  is  a  potential  for \nLao PDR  to  compete  advantageously  with  its  neighboring  countries  in  the  production  of  these \ncommodities. 5 Maize and soybean have export potential for animal feed, and there is scope for \nexpansion of coffee exports. Cotton can substitute for imports used in the textile sector, one of \nLao PDR\u2019s main export earning industries. Fruit and vegetable production can be expanded to \nmeet  domestic  demand  and  for  export  to  Thailand.6  The  demand  for  meat  in  the  domestic \nmarket  and  neighboring  countries  is  likely  to  continue  to  increase  in  the  foreseeable  future. \nLao PDR has a competitive advantage in supplying cattle and buffalo to Thailand. Pilot projects \nhave shown that commercial fish farming can result in yields of up to 500 kilograms per hectare. \nIntegrating fisheries with livestock production has potential to increase this further. In addition to \ntimber,  forests  yield  non-timber  forest  products  (NTFPs)  that  can  be  used  for  subsistence \npurposes  or  to  enhance  the  cash  incomes  of  rural  households.  Some  of  these  products  also \nprovide  cash  income.  Other  traditional  forms  of  income  generating  activities  in  the  uplands \ninclude  handicraft  and  basketry  made  from  bamboo  and  rattan.  Products  include  winnowing \nbaskets,  many  types  of  carrying  baskets,  mats,  and  small  tables.  Handicraft  and  embroidery \nproducts  include  buttons,  hair  ornaments,  and  necklaces  that  form  part  of  traditional  dress. \nThere is also a strong tradition of weaving in the lowlands. Other activities include metalworking \nfor tools production, especially knives, machetes, and spades. \n \n7. \nlack of access to finance. \n \n8. \nCommercial Banking Sector. The financial sector of the Lao PDR remains shallow with \nlimited  financial  intermediation  and  without  significant  outreach.  The  low  level  of  monetization \nthroughout the population has kept the Lao PDR at one of the lowest levels of financial depth in \nthe world. The sector consists exclusively of banks. There is one monopoly insurance company, \nno leasing companies, and no other nonbank financial institutions. Financial services reach only \na small part of the population and those services delivered, with few exceptions, are not being \nprovided on a sustainable or efficient basis.  \n \n                                                 \n4  Experience Inc, 2002, \u201cTA No 3603-LAO Smallholder Development Project, Draft Final Report\u201d. \n5  ADB. 1999.

The  sector  is  dominated  by  three  state-owned \nbanks: Banque pour le Commerce Exterieur Lao (BCEL), Lao Development Bank (LDB), which \nhave traditionally been considered \u201cstate-owned commercial banks\u201d or SOCBs, and APB which \nwas established as a policy bank. Together, they account for almost three quarters of the total \ngross  assets  of  the  banking  system.  Branches  of  several  foreign  banks  started  operating  in \nVientiane  in  the  early  nineties,  but  deficiencies  in  the  banking  environment  in  which  they \noperate,  particularly  the  legal  framework,  and  limitations  on  activities  have  limited  their \ncontribution to the domestic economy.  \n \n10. \nBCEL began its operations in 1976. In 1989, it augmented its international business, and \nstarted  to  develop  its  branch  network.  It  now  has  seven  branches  including  the  head  office  in \nVientiane.  Its  products  include  a  high  level  of  fee  income  from  trade  financing  and  foreign \nexchange transactions and its clients are generally the larger enterprises in the Lao PDR. BCEL \ndominates  the  market  with  about  four  tenths  of  total  banking  assets.  LDB  is  the  result  of  the \nmerger in 2002 of Lao May Bank and Lane Xang Bank. It has a branch in each of the country\u2019s \n17  provinces,  and  its  clients  are  primarily  small-  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  and \npersonal banking customers, including housing loan borrowers. \n \n11. \nIn addition to the SOCBs, there are three joint-venture commercial banks (JVCBs): Joint \nDevelopment  Bank  (JDB),  Lao-Viet  Bank  (LVB),  and  Vientiane  Commercial  Bank  (VCB).  The \nJVCBs mainly service customers in the country\u2019s principal cities. JDB was established in 1989. \nLVB started operations in 1999, with BCEL and Vietnam Development Bank as its joint owners. \nVCB  began  operating  in  1995.  A  third  banking  category  consists  of  six  foreign  commercial \nbanks (FCBs), each operating a single branch office in Vientiane, and one other UK bank with a \nrepresentative office in Vientiane\u2014Standard Chartered Bank. The six FCBs are principally Thai \ncommercial  banks\u2014Bangkok  Bank,  Krung  Thai  Bank,  Siam  Commercial  Bank,  Bank  of \nAyudhya,  and  Thai  Military  Bank\u2014and  one  Malaysian  bank,  namely  Public  Bank.  The  FCBs \nservice their home country clients who have operations in the Lao PDR. \n \n12. \nAgriculture  Promotion  Bank.  The  Government's  policy  to  support  access  to  rural \nfinance  has  been  implemented  primarily  by  APB,  which  was  established  as  a  policy  bank  in \n1993  and  has  acted  as  a  channel  for  Government  and  donor  funds  and  subsidies by carrying \nout  policy  lending  on  behalf  of  the  Government.7  APB\u2019s  interest  rates  have  been  determined \neither  by  the  Government  or  by  agreements  with  donors.  Typically,  these  are  below  market \nrates and insufficient to cover APB\u2019s costs. APB\u2019s ordinary lending is funded from deposits, with \nlending rates closer to commercial terms (e.g., 20% for crops and livestock; 24% for handicraft; \n26% for small industry; 30% for trade and services; and 34% for overdrafts). These rates are set \nby APB\u2019s Board, but they reflect rates elsewhere in the state sector and are not based on APB\u2019s \nactual risks.  \n \n13. \nAPB\u2019s  activities  extend  to  about  6,000  villages.  APB  has  a  total  of  129,493  borrowers, \ncomprising 123,306  group  members  in  13,342 groups  with  an  average  9  members  per  group; \nand  6,187  individual  borrowers.  APB  currently  reaches  about  14%  of  Lao  households.  APB's \noutreach  is  limited  because  it  depends  on  the  limited  funding  available  from  the  Government \nand donors and because its policies, inefficient and subsidized operations, and weak financial \ncondition prevent it from mobilizing commercial funding. Institutionally, APB carries out financial \nand  non-financial  activities  (for  example:  distributing  fertilizer  and  equipment),  reflecting  its \n\n                                                 \n7  \u201cPolicy lending\u201d in Lao PDR generally refers to directed credit at preferential interest rates. \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nmixed  mandate  as  a  financial  institution  and  development  organ  of  the  state.  As  a  result,  its \noperations are inefficient, and management autonomy and responsibility are limited. \n \n14. \nSubsidized interest rates and the common practice of rolling over loans have prevented \nAPB  from  developing  and  adopting  realistic  credit  risk  assessment  and  loan  pricing  practices. \nThis  has  contributed  to  a  weak  credit  culture,  resulting  in  high  levels  of  non-performing  loans. \nConsequently,  according  to  international  accounting  standards,  APB  has  been  operating  at  a \nsignificant loss since it was established in 1993. However, prior to 2002, APB had never been \naudited, making its financial situation (and, therefore, costs to the Government budget) unclear. \nAPB\u2019s  first  audit,  which  took  place  in  2002,  indicated  a  high  rate  of  non-performing  loans \n(NPLs)8 as of December 2001, and provision for doubtful debts was inadequate. APB\u2019s portfolio \nregarding undertaken at 31 December 2003 indicates that the high NPL rate is driven largely by \nits  policy  lending,  which  has  an  NPL  rate  that  is  2.4  times  higher  than  the  NPL  rate  of  its \nordinary  loan  portfolio.  Consequently,  APB  has  incurred  significant  losses  each  year  since  its \nestablishment,  representing  costs  to  the  Government  budget.  Loans  of  about  KN82.5  billion \n(35%  of  APB\u2019s  total  portfolio),  needs  to  be  written  off  as  of  31  December  2003.  This  includes \nKN59.4 billion in policy loans (52% of the policy lending portfolio) and KN23.2 billion in ordinary \nloans  (26%  of  the  ordinary  portfolio).  On  average,  since  APB\u2019s  establishment  in  1993,  about \n$1 million  equivalent  per  year  has  been  lost,  but  losses  have  accelerated  in  recent  years.  A \nmore  complete  analysis  of  APB\u2019s  financial  performance  and  projections  is  presented  in \nSupplementary Appendix B. \n \n15.  Microfinance  Institutions  and  Initiatives.  Microfinance  is  at  a  nascent  stage  in  Lao \nPDR. The combined outreach of the four largest initiatives is less than 6,000. APB\u2019s operations \nhave  tended  to  distort  the  rural  finance  system  and  result  in  misallocation  of  resources,  low \ndeposit mobilization, and crowding out of MFIs and other banks, further limiting outreach. They \nalso create a climate of unrealistic expectations on the part of potential borrowers and central \nand  local  officials  regarding  the  cost  of  credit,  making  it  difficult  for  microfinance  initiatives  to \ncharge  sustainable  interest  rates  even  in  areas  where  APB\u2019s  outreach  is  limited.  Village \nrevolving funds established by the LWU in some 1,600 villages (sometimes with the support of \ninternational donors) reinforce these expectations\u2014in general, they channel a limited amount of \nsubsidized  credit  to  a  few  households,  do  not  mobilize  local  resources,  have  low  repayment \nrates, and are not sustainable. It is unknown how many are still operational. An indicative list of \nmicrofinance initiatives is included in Appendix 11. \n \n16. \nProjects  or  MFIs  that  attempt  to  charge  sustainable  interest  rates  are  typically \ndiscouraged  or  prevented  from  doing  so  by  local  officials.  The  lack  of  a  clear  legal  and \nregulatory  framework  for  microfinance  gives  MFI  practitioners  little  recourse  to  counter \ninterference from officials. This lack of a transparent framework and the consequent interference \nis cited by international NGOs and other potential microfinance investors as the main reason for \nnot  investing  in  the  sector.  Current  regulations  cover  only  credit  cooperatives  (regulation  no. \n02/SB of 15 November 1994 issued by BOL) and provide limited or no guidance on operational \nrules  of  governance,  conflicts  of  interest,  auditing  requirements  (external  and  internal), \nprudential discipline, reporting requirements, sanctions, and experience or qualification of board \nmembers.  Commensurate  with  the  lack  of  a  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  microfinance, \nBOL has no experience and limited capacity to supervise MFIs. As a result of these constraints, \nvery  few  MFIs  operate  in  the  country.  Most  microfinance  is  delivered  through  one-off  projects \n\n                                                 \n8  NPLs are loans on which repayment of principle or interest is overdue by more than 90 days. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n35 \n\nand other unsustainable initiatives, capacity is low, and accounting practices are weak or non-\nexistent. \n \n17. \nDespite these constraints, five microfinance projects or initiatives have been undertaken \nwith  the  explicit  goal  of  providing  sustainable  services.  The  Cooperative  de  Credit  pour  le \nSolution  aux  Petites  Unites  de  Production  (CCSP)  was  established  in  1996  by  Lao \nentrepreneurs,  but  with  some  assistance  from  the  French  NGO  Society  divertissement  et  de \nD\u00e9veloppement  International  (SIDI),  and  now  comprises  12  member-owned  cooperatives \nproviding microfinance for crop and livestock production in Vientiane Municipality and Vientiane, \nChampasack,  Luang  Prabang,  Saravane,  and  Xieng  Khouang  Provinces. \nIt  serves \napproximately 2,500 members.  \n \nIn  cooperation  with  the  Government,  the  United  Nations  Capital  Development  Fund \n18. \n(UNCDF)  and  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)  launched  a  microfinance \nproject  in  late  1997.  Two  rural  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs)  were  established  in  Oudomxay \nand Xayaboury Provinces using group-lending methods. A third initiative in Vientiane aimed to \nconsolidate the experience of the Sihom Project Savings and Credit Scheme (SIPSACRES), an \nurban  credit  and  savings  cooperative  founded  under  an  earlier  UNDP  Project  in  1995.  UNDP \nand UNCDF support for the project ended in 2002, and the project is currently managed by the \nMinistry  of  Finance.  The  project  is  targeted  at  income  generation  and  women\u2019s  development \nand  makes  cash  loans,  mainly  for  wholesale  and  retail  trading,  to  solidarity  groups  who  also \nsave with the project. As of 31 December 2003, the project served 1,195 borrowers and 1,900 \nsavers. \n \nThe Proj\u00eat de D\u00e9veloppement Rural du District de Phongsaly (PDDP) was established in \n19. \n1997 by the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD). It operates village banks for farmers \nin Phongsaly District. At 31 December 2003, PDDP was providing credit to 2,300 borrowers for \nproduction of cash crops, livestock, handicrafts, and for petty trade.  \n \n20. \nThe  Rural  Development  Cooperative  (RDC)  was  founded  by  Lao  entrepreneurs  and \noperates  in  thirty  villages  in  Naxiaithong  District  of  Vientiane  Municipality.  It  started  its \noperations  in  August  2001  utilizing  members\u2019  share  capital  and  a  loan  from  the  Vientiane \nMunicipal  Development  Fund.  Loans  are  made  for  agriculture,  fisheries,  handicraft,  wholesale \nand retail trade, services, and for education and weddings, generally against physical collateral \n(although  group  guarantees  are  accepted  for  rice  production  loans)  and  a  savings  deposit  of \n20%  of  the  loan  amount.  At  31  December  2003,  RDC  had  about  890  active  borrowers  and \nabout 1,480 savers. \n \n21. \nIn addition to these four microfinance initiatives, work commenced in March 2003, with \nsupport from ADB TA cluster 3413-LAO: Rural Finance Development, on the establishment of \nin  Vientiane, \nthree  member-owned,  market-driven  savings  and  credit  unions  (SCUs) \nSavannakhet, and Luang Prabang Provinces. Pledge drives in each province secured pledges \nfrom  more  than  250  founder  members  in  each  location  for  more  than  the  minimum  required \ncapital of $3,000. New regulations and byelaws have been prepared and approved by BOL for \nthese pilot SCUs, and licenses were granted to the three SCUs in March 2004. The SCUs will \ncommence services for their 900 founding members in May 2004. \n \n22. \nLessons  Learned.  Lao  authorities  have  begun  taking  important  steps  to  improve  the \npolicy,  regulatory,  and  institutional  environment  for  rural  and  microfinance.  Since  March  2000, \nADB  has  been  assisting  the  Government  in  its  efforts  under  TA  cluster  3413-LAO:  Rural \nFinance  Development.  Given  the  nascent  stage  of  the  sector,  subproject  1  of  the  TA  cluster, \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\ncarried  out  in  2000\u20132001,  built  awareness  of  rural  finance  issues,  including  international \nexperience  and  best  practice,  through  a  series  of  workshops  and  study  tours  and  prepared  a \n\u201cPolicy  and  Issues  Paper\u201d  that  identified  weaknesses  in  the  institutional,  policy,  legal,  and \nregulatory framework. Step by step, it has been recognized that an improved policy environment \nfor rural and microfinance is needed, and that market reforms in APB are necessary to enable it \nto  increase  outreach  sustainably  without  burdening  the  government  budget.  International  and \nLao experience demonstrates that the non-poor are the main beneficiaries of subsidized interest \nrates  since  they  have  greater  access  and  can  absorb  larger  loans.  Over  half  of  APB\u2019s  loan \nportfolio is concentrated in the two wealthiest areas of the country\u2014Vientiane and Champasak \nInternational experience has shown that when subsidized loans are not available, the poor are \nwilling  to  pay  market  interest  rates,  and  they  tend  to  value  sustained  access  more  than  a  low \ninterest rate. Therefore, developing a market-oriented rural financial system is the best way to \nprovide the poor with access to affordable financial services. \n \n23. \nTo  begin  reforming  APB,  subproject  2  (May\u2013December  2002)  conducted  a  diagnostic \nreview  and  financial  audit  of  APB.  Based  on  the  findings,  an  APB  Restructuring  Plan  was \nprepared,  which  addresses  weaknesses  in  APB's  policies  and  procedures  in  many  areas, \nincluding governance, planning, organizational structure, pricing, credit, products and services, \ninformation  and  communications  technology  (ICT),  risk  management,  and  accounting.  In \nNovember  2002,  the  Government  adopted  a  new  corporate  vision  for  APB  to  \"operate  in  a \nmarket-oriented,  financially  self-sustainable  way  to  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  and  the \ncountry's  economic  growth  and  prosperity.\"  Implementation  of  the  first  phase  of  the  APB \nRestructuring Plan began in March 2003 under subproject 5. Importantly, this includes a plan to \nphase policy lending out of APB by the end of 2007 and to shift residual policy lending, if any, to \na transparent, non-banking mechanism on the Government budget. \n \n24.  While  the  capacity  of  APB  is  being  developed  through  its  restructuring  program, \ninstitutional mechanisms involving the private sector are also being promoted under subproject \n3  of  the  TA  cluster,  begun  in  March  2003,  which  established  three  pilot  SCUs  in  areas  with \nstrong  market  linkages.  These  SCUs  are  member-owned  and  managed,  with  full  autonomy  in \ntheir management, hiring procedures, interest rates, access to capital, and choice of products, \nclientele, and geographical coverage.  \n \n25. \nIn addition, the Government's Rural and Microfinance Committee (RMFC), with support \nfrom  ADB,  Concern  Worldwide,  the  Financial  Sector  Reform  and  Strengthening  Initiative \n(FIRST),  and  the  World  Bank,  prepared  an  official  vision  and  policy  statement  for  the  sector, \nbased on a participatory process that included key stakeholders, including villagers. The thrust \nof the Policy Statement for the Development of Sustainable Rural and Micro Finance Sector is \nthe development of a market-oriented, sustainable sector, which includes active private sector \nparticipation,  removal  of  interest  rate  caps  and  subsidies,  and  development  of  an  enabling \npolicy,  legal,  and  regulatory  framework.  The  Policy  Statement  was  endorsed  by  a  forum  of \nProvincial Vice Governors and other senior Lao officials in June 2003, by BOL in August 2003, \nand  by  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Office  in  November  2003.  Subproject  4  of  the  TA  cluster  (co-\nfinanced by FIRST) has sustained the momentum of the reform process by assisting the RMFC \nthrough  a  participatory  process  to  develop  a  strategy  to  promote  rural  and  microfinance \ndevelopment, and assisting BOL's Department of Supervision to develop an enabling legal and \nregulatory  framework.  The  regulatory  framework  was  officially  issued  in  June  2005,  and  the \nstrategy will be issued as a first-tranche condition. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n37 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nEXTERNAL

The TA cluster was requested by the Government \nbecause it recognized that weaknesses in the policy environment and institutional capacity were \nmajor constraints to developing sustainable rural and microfinance and expanding outreach. \n \n\nWith the TA\u2019s assistance, the Government's Rural and Microfinance Committee (RMFC) \nhas prepared a \u201cPolicy Statement for the Development of a Sustainable Rural and Microfinance \nSector\u201d,  which  was  endorsed  by  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Office  in  November  2003,  and  presents \nthe  Government\u2019s  vision  of  a  diverse,  sustainable,  market-oriented  sector  that  will  expand \nsignificantly  to  contribute  to  the  Government\u2019s  National  Poverty  Eradication  Program  (NPEP). \nThe TA has also (i) assisted the RMFC to develop a draft National Strategy to promote rural and \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n 79 \n\nmicrofinance, which includes promoting private MFIs that focus on sustainability and outreach, \nand  consequently  contribute  to  poverty  reduction;  and  (ii)  assisted  the  Department  of \nSupervision  of  the  Bank  of  Lao  PDR  (BOL)  to  develop  an  enabling  legal  and  regulatory \nframework  that  will  facilitate  the  establishment  of  new  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs)  and \nensure the development of a viable rural and microfinance sector.  \n \n\nThe  draft  National  Strategy  has  five  basic  components:  (i)  to  create  an  enabling  policy \nframework;  (ii)  to  create  a  sound  prudential  regulatory  and  supervisory  environment;  (iii)  to \ncreate  a  market-oriented  state-owned  sector;  (iv)  to  create  a  diverse  and  competitive  private \nmicrofinance  sector;  and  (v)  to  create  a  supportive  non-prudential  regulatory  environment. \nUnder part (iv) the Strategy calls for (a) allowing pilot testing and providing start-up support to \nprivate  rural  and  microfinance  institutions,  (b)  encouraging  a  diversity  of  microfinance \ninstitutions that operate autonomously and sustainably, (c) creating a practitioners\u2019 association, \nand  (d)  fostering  the  development  of  full-scale  private  institutions.  Therefore,  the  Microfinance \nFund  and  its  Management  Unit  are  designed  to  assist  the  Government  to  realize  its  policy, \nvision,  and  strategy  for  the  sector,  in  particular  to  promote  the  piloting,  establishment,  and \noperation of sustainable, best-practice MFIs to serve a diverse population, including women and \nethnic groups, and thereby contribute to the Government\u2019s poverty reduction goals. \n \n\nInnovation  \n\n4. \n \nMicrofinance  is  at  an  embryonic  stage  in  Lao  PDR.  Outreach  is  extremely  limited,  and \nthe  poor  in  particular  have  little  access  to  formal  financial  services.  Thirty-nine  percent  of  the \ncountry\u2019s population is poor, and over 90% of the poor live in rural areas. However, only about \n15%  of  Lao  households  have  access  to  formal  financial  sources,  and  the  vast  majority  are  in \nnon-poor  urban  areas.  In  the  absence  of  access  to  formal  sources  of  credit,  the  poor  rely  on \ninformal  sources  of  finance,  including  relatives,  friends,  merchants,  and  moneylenders,  who \ncharge interest rates as high as 240% per year (20% per month). The Government's policy to \nsupport  access  to  rural  finance  has  been  implemented  primarily  by  the  Agriculture  Promotion \nBank  (APB),  which  has  conducted  directed  lending  at  below-market  interest  rates.  APB's \noutreach  has  been  limited  because  it  depends  on  the  limited  funding  available  from  the \nGovernment  and  donors,  and  because  its  policies,  inefficient  and  subsidized  operations,  and \nweak financial condition prevent it from mobilizing commercial funding. APB has been operating \nat  a  significant  loss  since  it  was  established  in  1993,  representing  a  substantial  cost  to  the \nGovernment budget. It is now recognized that APB\u2019s directed lending policies have distorted the \nrural  finance  system  and  resulted  in  misallocation  of  resources,  low  deposit  mobilization,  and \ncrowding  out  of  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs)  and  other  banks.  Moreover,  the  Lao  and \ninternational  experience  demonstrates  that  the  non-poor  are  the  main  beneficiaries  of \nsubsidized  interest  rates  since  they  have  greater  access  and  can  absorb  larger  loans.  When \nsubsidized  loans  are  not  available,  the  poor  are  willing  to  pay  market  interest  rates,  and  they \ntend to value sustained access more than a low interest rate. Hence, the poor in particular will \nbenefit from sustainable MFIs. \n\n \nBased  on  their  recognition  of  APB\u2019s  weaknesses,  the  Lao  authorities  have  begun \nrestructuring  APB,  with  ADB  support,  to  transform  it  into  a  sustainable,  market-oriented  rural \nfinance  institution.  The  plan  includes  phasing  out  directed  lending  and  interest  rate  subsidies \nover 3 years. The Government has also adopted a new Policy Statement for Sustainable Rural \nand  Microfinance,  which  includes  a  policy  to  support  the  development  of  sustainable  private \ninitiatives. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f80 \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nIn  this  context  of  Lao  PDR\u2019s  transition  to  a  market  economy,  the  Government\u2019s  new \nfocus on building sustainable market-oriented MFIs and phasing out its directed-credit approach \nis innovative. Such a step has been difficult even in more developed market economies, so its \noccurrence in Lao PDR is extraordinary. Similarly, the creation of a special Microfinance Fund \n(MFF)  to  provide  start-up  grants  and  seed  capital  to  private  MFIs  is  innovative  and  is  a \ndemonstration  of  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  its  stated  policies.  A  number  of  bilateral \ndonors  and  international  NGOs  have  begun  to  express  some  interest  in  investing  in \nmicrofinance  in  Lao  PDR,  now  that  the  policy  environment  is  improving.  However,  they  also \nremain  skeptical  because  of  past  practices,  so  they  are  eager  to  see  a  demonstration  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s commitment. Preliminary results of an ongoing survey indicates that there would \nbe a strong demand for grants from the MFF. The MFF will therefore catalyze private-sector-led \ngrowth in sustainable, market-oriented MFIs that are a proven method for reducing poverty. The \npoor in remote areas, particularly women and ethnic groups, will benefit because MFIs serving \nthem will be given preference for matching grants, subject to meeting the other eligibility criteria, \nincluding a focus on sustainability and best practices. Similarly, MFIs (e.g., savings and credit \nunions) that develop innovative, flexible products and services that are specifically designed for \nthe poor will be given preference. \n\n \nSimilarly,  outreach  activities  under  the  MFF  (e.g.,  workshops  and  trainings)  will \ndisseminate  best  practice  principles  throughout  the  country,  both  among  officials  and \npractitioners. Hence, the entire project is an innovative approach to stimulate the creation and \ngrowth  of  private  MFIs  in  Lao  PDR,  including  in  the  poorer  remote  areas.  The  MFF  and \nassociated  activities  will  ensure  that  the  momentum  of  reforms  built  up  with  the  assistance  of \nthe  ADB  TA  cluster  will  continue.  A  more  efficient,  diverse,  competitive,  and  market-oriented \nrural finance system will increase access to financial services and significantly expand income-\ngenerating opportunities, generate employment, and reduce poverty. \n \n\n5.  \n\nSustainability \n\nSustainability will be achieved in three ways.  \n\n \n \n \n\nFirst,  the  focus  of  the  Microfinance  Fund\u2019s  activities  will  be  on  supporting  the  creation \nand growth of sustainable, private, market-oriented MFIs that follow international best practices. \nHence,  the  MFF  will  contribute  to  the  establishment  of  a  sustainable  microfinance  sector.  Of \nparticular  importance  in  this  effort  will  be  the  consolidation,  on  a  pilot  basis,  of  some  of  the \nvillage savings and credit groups (VSCGs) that have been established in some 1600 villages in \nLao  PDR.  Most  of  these  are  either  non-functioning  now  or  are  unsustainable  because  of \ninefficient  credit  and  management  systems  that  have  focused  on  channeling  limited,  cheap \ncredit to members. The project will therefore consolidate a sample of these VSCGs into larger \nlocal MFIs, which may then serve as a model for future consolidation of other VSCGs.  \n\n \nSecond, if the Fund proves successful and is needed to catalyze further growth following \nthe JPFR grant, then it will be in a position to attract additional funding from international donors \nand/or  the Government.  In  such  a case,  the MFFMU  would  be  transformed  into  a  legal  \u201cfund\u201d \nunder Lao law, with representation on its board from donors and shareholders. The MFFMU and \nsystems  established  with  the  JFPR  grant,  along  with  additional  donor  support,  will  enable  the \nMFF and MFFMU to sustain its operations.  \n\n \nThird, project activities include the preparation of the terms of reference and prospectus \nfor carrying out a feasibility study to establish a private (or public-private partnership) national-\nlevel MFI. Among the options that this study would consider would be to transform the MFF and \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n 81 \n\nMFFMU into a national-level MFI, and the study would include a financing plan to attract donor \nsupport. For example, bilateral donors and international NGOs may be invited to take an equity \nstake in the transformed MFF / national MFI, and may do so in a public-private partnership with \nthe Lao Government, and participating MFIs that have benefited from the MFF could be invited \nto join the national MFI as branches.  \n\n \nIn these three cases, the focus of this project is on creating MFIs that will be sustainable \nover the long-term. Such a focus on sustainability is the best way to ensure that the poor have \nthe continued access to the financial services that they need. \n\n \nMoreover,  in  terms  of  environmental  sustainability,  although  loans  from  participating \nMFIs to clients are expected to be small and therefore have insignificant environmental impacts, \nall participating MFIs will be required to have sound environmental policies, including following \nLao  environmental  laws  and  the  conduct  of  environmental  due  diligence  for  loans  that  have \npotential environmental effects. \n \n\n6. \n\nParticipatory Approach \nPrimary beneficiaries and other affected \ngroups and relevant description \n\u2022  Throughout the 4 years of implementing the TA \ncluster, primary beneficiaries (e.g., villagers, \nwomen\u2019s groups, central and local officials) \nhave been consulted and benefited from \nworkshops and awareness building on \nmicrofinance principles.  \n\n\u2022  Local MFI practitioners, and some of their \nbeneficiaries (male and female villagers) \nparticipated in a national-level workshop that \nwas attended by all 17 provincial vice \ngovernors and central government officials; the \npractitioners and beneficiaries gave \npresentations to the authorities on their needs \nand concerns, and discussed the benefits of \nongoing sustainable microfinance initiatives. \n\n\u2022  A survey under the TA cluster was \n\nadministered to 1,200 households from a \nnational cross-section. Preliminary results of \nthe survey demonstrate the high demand for \nsustainable MFI services, as well as the \ndissatisfaction with the status quo. \n\n\u2022  Activities under the proposed JFPR grant \ninclude a series of local workshops to \ndisseminate best practices and assistance to \neligible MFIs to prepare institutional \ndevelopment plans to operate sustainably in \norder to meet local demands. \n\n\u2022  Only private, autonomous MFIs will be \n\nsupported\u2014by being autonomous, rather than \ncontrolled from the central level, local priorities \nwill be followed. Priority will be given to MFIs \nthat serve women and ethnic groups in remote \ncommunities. Members and shareholders will \nbe drawn from local communities and include \nwomen, small-scale entrepreneurs, farmers, \ngovernment employees, etc. \n\nOther key stakeholders and brief description \n\n\u2022  Throughout implementation of the TA cluster, \nseveral workshops have been held with the \ndonor community and Government officials \nfrom the central and provincial levels. For \nexample, participatory workshops were \nconducted to discuss preparation of the Policy \nStatement on Sustainable Rural and \nMicrofinance, on the draft National Strategy, \nand on the draft legal and regulatory \nframework for microfinance. Donor \nparticipation, including JICA, was active. \n\u2022  Drafts of the documents above were also \ndiscussed during a series of provincial \nworkshops and consultations, to ensure that \nlocal priorities and concerns were addressed. \nA national level workshop included the vice \ngovernors of all provinces, several donors \n(including JICA), local MFI practitioners, and \ncentral government officials from various \nministries. \n\n\u2022  The steering committee of the TA cluster \n\nincludes all relevant ministries and agencies \nat the central level (e.g., BOL, APB, Ministry \nof Finance, Prime Minister\u2019s Office, Ministry of \nAgriculture and Forestry, etc.); it is proposed \nthat this steering committee would remain in \nplace for the JFPR grant.  \n\n\u2022  The survey under the TA cluster included a \nquestionnaire administered to most MFI \npractitioners in Lao PDR, including all NGOs \nactive in the sector, and demonstrates the \ndemand for matching grants and loans to \ncatalyze growth in the sector, as well as the \ndemand for further training and knowledge of \nmicrofinance best practices. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f82 \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \n\n \n\n7.  \n\nCoordination \n\nCoordination  with  JICA,  the  World  Bank,  IMF,  and  other  donors  has  been  close  and \nfrequent.  As  discussed  in  part  6  above,  a  series  of  workshops  on  the  Policy  Statement, \nStrategy,  and  regulatory  framework  have  included  the  active  participation  of  many  donors, \nincluding  JICA,  the  World  Bank,  and  IMF.  The  World  Bank,  the  international  NGO  Concern \nWorldwide,  and  the  Financial  Reform  Strengthening  Initiative  (FIRST,  a  consortium  of  several \nmultilateral and bilateral donors) contributed financing to organize some of the workshops (ADB \nTA and the Government provided the balance of workshop costs). ADB, World Bank, and IMF \nhave cooperated and collaborated extremely closely over the past 3 years in developing a long-\nterm financial sector reform program for Lao PDR, of which rural and microfinance is an integral \ncomponent\u2014rural and microfinance is the subject of separate components in the World Bank\u2019s \nFinancial Management Adjustment Credit and in ADB\u2019s Banking Sector Reform Program Loan, \nboth  approved  in  2002.  AusAid  and  Swedish  International  Development  Agency  (SIDA)  have \ncontributed to the program by financing audits of the state-owned commercial banks, including \nAPB.  JICA  has  made  an  important  contribution  to  the  program  through  its  support  for \nmacroeconomic  management  and  state-owned  enterprise  reform  through  the  MAPS  program. \nADB has hosted donor roundtable discussions in Lao PDR to brief donors on ADB activities, to \nbe updated on their program activities, and to coordinate overall efforts to reform the rural and \nmicrofinance sector. \n \n\n8. \n\nDetailed Cost Table  \n\n \n\n \nC. \n \n\nPlease refer to Appendix 1 for the detailed cost estimates. \n\nLinkage to ADB Strategy and ADB-Financed Operations \n\n1. \n\nLinkage to ADB Strategy \n\nDocument \nNumber \n\n \nOfficial \ngovernment  policy \ndocument \n\nSec.

The  Government  generally  seeks  loan  funds  for  investments  in \nconcrete goods and services, while preferring grant financing for training, capacity building, and \nproject support. Despite this preference, the Government will be borrowing from the ADB loan to \ncontinue  the  APB  restructuring  plan  and  upgrade  BOL\u2019s  capacity  to  supervise  MFIs\u2014both \ncomponents  are  mostly  training  and  capacity  building.  The  program  loan  would  ensure \ncontinued improvements in the policy and regulatory environment to support the establishment \nand operation of private MFIs. The JFPR grant would finance complementary training, outreach \nfor MFI practitioners and Government officials, as well as create a Microfinance Fund (MFF) and \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n 85 \n\nManagement  Unit  (MFFMU)  to  provide  start-up  grants  to  MFIs  focused  on  sustainability  and \noutreach to the poor. It would also establish the framework for a feasibility study for a national \nMFI  legal  fund  to  support  MFIs.  Given  the  Government\u2019s  tight  fiscal  position,  the  amount  the \nGovernment  is  already  borrowing  for  other  activities,  and  the  focus  of  the  proposed  JFPR \nactivities  on  capacity  building  through  training,  workshops,  and  start-up  grants,  it  would  be \ndifficult for the Government to borrow for the proposed activities.

All expenditures to be financed by the JFPR grant will be included in the consultants' \ncontract.  Following  ADB  guidelines  and  practices  regarding  the  management  of  consultant \ncontracts, a portion of the funds will be disbursed into an account of the consulting firm based \non achievement of milestones (e.g., payments for mobilization, submission of inception report, \nmidterm  report,  draft  final  report,  and  final  report).  Reimbursable  items  will  require  that  the \nconsultants submit receipts for liquidation (e.g., air tickets). Consultants will be responsible for \npurchasing equipment and supplies, but will be required to submit a minimum of 3 quotations to \nADB for pre-approval before any purchase. Similarly, the consultants will submit workshop and \ntraining  budgets,  with  a  list  of  participants,  to  ADB  for  pre-approval  before  conducting \nworkshops and training. \n \nFunds for the microfinance start-up and seed capital grants will be disbursed into a local \n2. \nimprest account established by the MFF Management Unit (MFFMU) at a bank endorsed by the \nEA  and  acceptable  to  ADB,  to  facilitate  disbursements  of  grants  to  participating  MFIs. \nDisbursements  to  MFIs  will  be  recommended  by  the  MFFMU  (which  will  be  staffed  by \nconsultants and EA staff) and submitted to ADB for final approval. The EA and ADB will be kept \ninformed by the MFFMU about all disbursements and receive copies of all financial statements \nand  audit  reports.  The  imprest  account  will  be  managed  by  the  MFFMU  and  will  be  initially \nbased  on  the  first  six-month  activity  plan  and  related  budget,  and  afterwards  based  on  the \napproved annual work plan and budget. ADB will initially channel $100,000 of JFPR funds to the \nimprest account, and will replenish funds every 3 to 6 months to the imprest account, based on \napproved  disbursements  to  MFIs  and  replenishment  requests.  Detailed  implementation \narrangements, such as the flow, replenishment, and administrative procedures will be detailed \nin the PIM, and be established between ADB and the Government through the JFPR Letter of \nAgreement.

While  the  Government  will  use  an  ADB  loan  to \npurchase new hardware and software for APB and finance its turnkey installation, the JFICT grant would \nfinance  the  associated  assistance  to  APB  to  (i)  oversee  and  manage  the  specification  and  turnkey \nbidding process and the turnkey implementation contract, (ii) build capacity in APB to undertake its role in \nthese processes and subsequently roll-out systems throughout its network, and (iii) conduct training and \ncapacity building to use the new system. APB\u2019s ICT and MIS lag far behind similar banks in the region, \nmaking an ICT and MIS upgrade necessary to bridge the digital divide between APB and more modern \nbanks.  The  upgrade  will  also  enable  APB  to  be  fully  integrated  into  the  Lao  banking  system,  and \nspecifically  meet  its  reporting  requirements  to  the  Bank  of  Lao  PDR  (BOL,  the  central  bank).  As  Lao \nPDR\u2019s primary rural financial institution with the country\u2019s largest branch network, APB accounts for the \nvast  majority  of  loans  to  rural  clients,  and  specifically  targets  poor  farmers  and  rural  micro  and  small \nentrepreneurs.  Therefore,  improvements  in  APB\u2019s  ICT  and  MIS will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction and \neconomic growth by (i) reducing the costs and improving the efficiency of delivery of financial services to \nAPB\u2019s  rural  clients,  thus  allowing  it  to  expand  outreach  to  poor  clients  on  a  sustainable  basis,  and  (ii) \nimproving APB\u2019s internal governance by enabling it to improve financial transparency and ensure more \neffective prudential oversight by BOL.  \nExpected Key Performance Indicators: \n\nFinalized user requirements and technical specifications (by month 3) \nTurnkey contract signed (by month 8) \nTurnkey contract implemented and final acceptance given (by month 14) \nUpgraded ICT systems rolled out to all APB branches (by month 24) \nImproved management reporting and performance indicators (quarterly) \n\nGrant Categories of Expenditure, Amounts, and Percentage of Expenditures \n\nCategory \n\n1.

Under  the  TA  cluster,  the \nGovernment  requested  ADB's  assistance  to  transform  the  state-owned  Agriculture  Promotion \nBank (APB) into a sustainable, market-oriented rural financial institution. In November 2002, the \nGovernment adopted a new corporate vision for APB to be Lao PDR\u2019s \u201cpremiere rural finance \ninstitution\u201d and to \"operate in a market-oriented, financially self-sustainable way to contribute to \npoverty  reduction  and  the  country's  economic  growth  and  prosperity.\"  Hence,  financially  self-\nsustainable market-orientation is now the Government's chosen method for APB to contribute to \npoverty  reduction.  Moreover,  under  the  ADB  Banking  Sector  Reform  Program  Loan,2  the \nGovernment recommitted itself to implementing a phased operational and financial restructuring \nplan  for  APB  based  on  good  governance  principles  to  achieve  the  new  corporate  vision.  This \ncommitment  has  been  reinforced  through  official  Government  policy  documents,  including  the \nrecent \u201cPolicy Statement for the Development of Sustainable Rural and Micro Finance Sector\u201d \nand the \u201cNational Poverty Eradication Program\u201d. \n\nTo  begin  reforming  APB,  Subproject  2  of  the  TA  cluster  (May  to  November  2002) \nconducted (i) a diagnostic review of APB to better understand its strengths and weaknesses in \ncomparison  to  international  best  practice,  and  (ii)  a  financial  audit  to  better  understand  its \nfinancial position. Based on the findings, a Restructuring Plan was prepared. The Restructuring \nPlan  has  six  main  components:  (i)  the  removal  of  subsidies  and  the  liberalization  of  interest \nrates,  (ii)  creation  of  management  autonomy  and  the  termination  of  directed  lending, \n(iii) systematic  workout  of  non-performing  loans,  (iv)  upgrading  of  ICT  systems  and  MIS, \n(v) progressive  recapitalization  based  on  performance;  and  (vi)  a  range  of  inter-related \ninstitution-building  initiatives  that  support  the  key  restructuring  activities.  Under  Subproject  5 \n(March 2003 to June 2004) work commenced in all of these areas except ICT and MIS, which \nwas deferred because of the need to ensure funding was in place for the ICT upgrade. \n\nAPB  lags  behind  similar  banks  in  the  region  (e.g.,  BAAC  in  Thailand,  VBARD  in \nVietnam, BRI in Indonesia, and RDB in Cambodia) in terms of its ICT and MIS. APB\u2019s current \nICT  environment  and  MIS  do  not  adequately  provide  any  of  the  systems  needed  in  a  modern \nbank.  Specifically:  (i)  there  is  a  lack  of  vision  and  strategy  for  ICT  development,  and \nconsequently no effective plan or budget provision; (ii) the mandate of the ICT unit is not clear is \nrelation to its strategic and planning functions; (iii) none of the systems currently in use at APB \nare able to provide a basic customer information system, making effective risk management and \nperformance assessment impossible; (iv) any  new banking products and services can only be \ndeveloped when a comprehensive and integrated core banking system is in place; (v) the ICT \nstaff capacity is inadequate for APB\u2019s current and future needs; (vi) ICT policy and procedures \nare  not  documented  and  not  enforceable;  (vii)  ICT  security  is  weak  and  there  is  no  business \ncontinuity or disaster recovery plan; and (vii) software in many instances is not licensed and is \nthus  unsupported.  Additionally,  there  are  shortcomings  in  the  management  reporting  system \nthat make it of limited use for management decision making; the report generation capacity of \npresent software is inadequate for management reporting; current reports are not differentiated \nby user or management level; and the reporting system does not measure bank performance. \nMoreover,  because  APB  has  gone  effectively  unsupervised  by  BOL  until  now,  the  current \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for Rural Finance Development. Manila \n\n(TA No 3413-LAO). \n\n2   Approved by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors on 28 November 2002. \n\n \n\n\f102 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nsystem  is  inadequate  to  meet  BOL  requirements  under  the  new  supervision  regime  of  APB, \nwhich will require its treatment as a SOCB subject to full prudential supervision by BOL. \n\nAccordingly,  under  the  ADB  Rural  Finance  Sector  Development  Program  Loan  (being \nprepared  for  approval  in  2006)  includes  a  component  to  upgrade  APB\u2019s  ICT  and  MIS. \nSpecifically, the Government will use the ADB loan to purchase the hardware and software and \nfinance its turnkey installation, while the JFICT grant would finance the associated assistance to \nAPB  to  oversee  and  manage  the  specification  and  turnkey  bidding  process  and  the  turnkey \nimplementation  contract,  and  would  build  capacity  in  APB  to  undertake  its  role  in  these \nprocesses  and  subsequently  roll-out  systems  throughout  its  network,  including  training  and \ncapacity  building.  The  grant  proposal  was  therefore  conceived  as  an  integral  part  of  a \ncomprehensive  program  to  reform  the  rural  finance  system  of  Lao  PDR,  and  specifically  to \ntransform  ABP  into  a  sustainable,  market-oriented  rural  finance  institution.  Moreover,  the \nactivities proposed for JFICT are consistent with ADB\u2019s ICT Strategy, including the development \nof an enabling environment for ICT and improving human resource capacities to use ICT. \n\n4. \n\nSustainability \n\n \n\nSustainability of APB\u2019s ICT and MIS upgrade is linked to the sustainability of the overall \nAPB  reform  and  restructuring  program,  which  has  been  developed  since  2000  with  ADB  TA \nassistance under TA cluster 3413-LAO: Rural  Finance Development.  Through the ongoing TA \ncluster  activities,  strong  Government  ownership  of  the  reform  program  has  been  established \n(not only for APB\u2019s reforms, but also for microfinance reforms). Indeed, the primary objective of \nthe APB restructuring plan is to transform APB into a sustainable, market-oriented rural finance \ninstitution\u2014in  November  2002,  the  Government  adopted  a  new  corporate  vision  for  APB  to \n\"operate in a market-oriented, financially self-sustainable way to contribute to poverty reduction \nand the country's economic growth and prosperity.\" \n \n\nIn  this  context  it  is  noteworthy  that  APB  was  originally  established  in  1993  as  a  policy \nbank  to  channel  subsidized  credit  to  Lao  farmers.  However,  APB's  outreach  has  been  limited \nbecause  it  depends  on  the  limited  funding  available  from  the  Government  and  donors,  and \nbecause its policies, inefficient and subsidized operations, and weak financial condition prevent \nit from mobilizing commercial funding. APB has been operating at a significant loss since it was \nestablished  in  1993,  representing  a  substantial  cost  to  the  Government  budget.  It  is  now \nrecognized  that  APB\u2019s  directed  lending  policies  have  distorted  the  rural  finance  system  and \nresulted  in  misallocation  of  resources,  low  deposit  mobilization,  and  crowding  out  of \nmicrofinance  institutions  (MFIs)  and  other  banks.  Moreover,  the  Lao  and  international \nexperience  demonstrates  that  the  non-poor  are  the  main  beneficiaries  of  subsidized  interest \nrates since they have greater access and can absorb larger loans. When subsidized loans are \nnot available, the poor are willing to pay market interest rates, and they tend to value sustained \naccess  more  than  a  low  interest  rate.  Hence,  the  poor  in  particular  will  benefit  from  a \nsustainable, market-oriented APB. \n \n\nBased  on  their  recognition  of  APB\u2019s  weaknesses,  the  Lao  authorities  have  begun \nrestructuring  APB,  with  ADB  support,  to  transform  it  into  a  sustainable,  market-oriented  rural \nfinance  institution.  The  plan  includes  phasing  out  directed  lending  and  interest  rate  subsidies \nover  3  years,  so  that  APB  will  become  fully  financially  self-sustainable.  The  Government  has \nalso adopted a new national Policy Statement for Sustainable Rural and Micro Finance, which \nincludes a reaffirmation of its commitment to transform APB into a sustainable, market-oriented \ninstitution and to phase out interest rate subsidies. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n103 \n\nThe APB reform program, moreover, has been coordinated closely with the Lao Banking \nSector  Reform  Program  Loan  (BSRPL,  ADB  Loan  1946-LAO),  which  was  prepared  in \ncollaboration  with  the  World  Bank,  IMF,  and  other  donors.  This  overall  banking  sector  reform \nprogram includes a policy component calling for implementation of the APB restructuring plan. \nMoreover,  BOL\u2019s  Banking  Sector  ICT  Strategy  calls  for  upgrading  APB\u2019s  ICT  and  MIS. \nHowever,  it  must  be  noted  that  APB  has,  since  its  creation,  been  treated  differently  from  the \nState-Owned  Commercial  Banks  (SOCBs)\u2014indeed,  APB  was  established  as  a  \u201cpolicy  bank\u201d \nrather  than  an  SOCB.  As  a  result,  it  has  been  the  subject  of  its  own  reform  program,  which, \nwhile coordinated with BSRPL, has also followed its own path to account for its unique situation. \nWhile APB\u2019s restructuring plan calls for its treatment as an SOCB, it maintains a unique role in \nLao PDR as the Government\u2019s main instrument for delivering financial services to rural areas. \nAs  such,  implementation  of  its  restructuring  plan  is  of  exceptional  importance  to  the \nGovernment,  which  is  keen  that  sustainability  and  increased  outreach  to  the  poor  go  hand-in-\nhand. \n \n\nThe proposed turnkey approach combined with subsequent capacity-building assistance \nto  APB  with  the  roll-out  of  systems  bank-wide  will  ensure  effective  implementation  and \nsustainability  of  the  new  ICT  and  MIS.  Moreover,  it  is  expected  that  the  turnkey  contract  will \ncontain provisions for warranties for 12 months on equipment, 12 months on software from final \nacceptance by APB, and a requirement for a maintenance agreement to specified service levels \nfor a period of five years from the end of the warranty period. Provision for the recurrent costs \nassociated with systems maintenance will be incorporated into APB\u2019s budgets for its corporate \nplan 2006-2008 and in subsequent rolling three-year corporate plans. \n \n\n5.  \n\nParticipatory Approach \n\n \n \nAn  intensive  and  extensive  participatory  process  has  been  pursued  under  TA  cluster \n3413-LAO: Rural Finance Development since 2000. Subproject 1 (October 2000 to July 2001) \nincluded,  among  other  activities,  (i)  awareness  creation  workshops  for  local  officials  and \npractitioners,  which  reviewed  international  best  practice  in  rural  finance;  (ii)  four  guided  study \ntours  with  senior  officials  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  BOL,  the  Prime  Minister's  Office,  the \nMinistry  of  Agriculture  and  Forestry,  and  APB  to  sustainable  rural  finance  institutions  in  the \nregion; and (iii) preparation and review of a policy and institutional issues paper through a series \nof  provincial  workshops  and  a  national  wrap-up  meeting\u2014the  policy  and  institutional  issues \npaper  identified  policy  reforms  needed  in  the  economic  and  legal  framework  and  institutional \nstrategies to address the current constraints in rural finance. The overall impact of subproject 1 \nwas  positive\u2014knowledge  of  key  issues  and  best  practices  in  rural  and  microfinance  were \nenhanced,  as  evidenced  by  the  quality  of  policy  dialogue  that  has  ensued  in  preparing \nsubsequent initiatives. Subproject 2 (May to  December 2002) conducted a diagnostic study of \nAPB on 12 topics: (i) governance; (ii) strategic planning; (iii) organizational structure; (iv) human \nresources management; (v) pricing policies and procedures; (vi) credit policies and procedures; \n(vii)  risk  management  policies  and  procedures;  (viii)  products  and  demand;  (ix)  compliance \nreview;  (x)  financial  and  accounting  systems;  (xi)  management  information  systems;  and \n(xii) financial  analysis.  The  diagnostic  study  also  included  the  first  external  audit  of  APB.  The \nfindings  were  reviewed  by  the  Government  and  ADB  and  discussed  in  a  3-day  workshop  in \nSeptember  2002.  This  led  to  the  production  of  a  draft  restructuring  plan  for  APB  in  October \n2002. Following a review of the draft by the Government and ADB, a final plan was agreed on in \nDecember 2002. Implementation of the restructuring plan began under subproject 5. Moreover, \nsubproject 4 assisted the Government to prepare: (i) a national policy statement on sustainable \nrural  and  microfinance, (ii)  draft  national  strategy  for  rural  and  microfinance  development,  and \n(iii)  draft  regulations  for  microfinance  and  prudential  regulations  for  APB.  These  three \n\n \n\n\f104 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\ndocuments  have  been  discussed  at  three  national  workshops  that  included  central  and \nprovincial  Government  officials,  rural  and  microfinance  practitioners,  international  donors \n(including  World  Bank,  IMF,  JICA,  and  international  NGOs),  and  local  associations.  The \nresulting  APB  restructuring  plan  and  other  documents  reflect  the  inputs  of  this  participatory \nprocess  and  the  local  ownership  of  them.  Subproject  6  has  carried  out  a  national  rural  and \nmicrofinance  survey,  including  a  survey  of  1200  rural  households,  and  some  30  microfinance \npractitioners,  and  demonstrated  that  beneficiaries  have  a  strong  demand  for  market-oriented \nfinancial services and are willing to pay market rates for them. \n \n \nMore specific to APB\u2019s ICT needs, as noted above, the APB diagnostic under subproject \n2  included  a  diagnostic  of  APB\u2019s  ICT  system  and  recommendations  to  upgrade,  which  was \ndiscussed  with  workshop  participants  and  reflected  in  APB\u2019s  restructuring  plan.  Moreover, \nBOL\u2019s ICT Committee held a series of six workshops over three months to develop the banking \nsystem\u2019s  overall  ICT  strategy,  of  which  APB  was  an  integral  part.  The  resulting  ICT  strategy \ncalls for a complete upgrade of APB\u2019s ICT and MIS. \n \nAPB\u2019s  management  and  Board  have  been  involved  in  each  step  of  this  participatory \n \nprocess.  Management  and  Board  have  participated  extensively  in  the  preparation  of  the \nRestructuring  Plan  and  the  Corporate  Plan  (both  of  which  contain  provisions  for  the  ICT \nUpgrading)  and,  where  required,  have  obtained  Government  approval  for  the  proposals.  An \nAPB  ICT  Needs  Review  and  System  Design  has  been  prepared  with  consultant  assistance \nunder  ADB  PPTA  4135-LAO:  Preparing  the  Rural  Finance  Development  Loan.  Extensive \nconsultation has taken place with APB ICT Staff and with the BOL ICT Committee in the system \ndesign to ensure it will integrate with other proposed ICT systems being introduced by BOL at a \ncentral banking level.  \n \n\nOther key stakeholders and brief description \n\nPrimary  beneficiaries  and  other  affected \ngroups and relevant description \n\u2022  APB management will benefit through access \n\nto accurate and timely management \ninformation that will assist the operations of \nAPB as a market-oriented rural finance \ninstitution. \n\n\u2022  BOL will benefit through better financial \n\nreporting from APB, easing the supervision \ntask. \n\n\u2022  APB\u2019s customers, especially the poor, will \n\nbenefit through improved service quality and \nrange of services. \n\n \n \n\n6. \n\nCoordination \n\n\u2022  MFIs, which have been crowded out in the \npast by APB\u2019s subsidized operations, will \nbenefit from a more equal, competitive playing \nfield. \n\n\u2022  The Government budget will benefit from the \n\nelimination of subsidies to APB, as well as the \nelimination of APB\u2019s loss-making activities; as \na result, Government resources will be freed \nup for better targeted poverty reduction \nprograms \n\nCoordination  with  the  World  Bank,  IMF,  JICA,  and  other  donors  on  the  overall  rural \nfinance program, including APB restructuring, has been close and frequent. As discussed in part \n6  above,  a  series  of  workshops  on  the  Policy  Statement,  Strategy,  and  regulatory  framework \nhave included the active participation of many donors, including JICA, the World Bank, and IMF. \nThe  World  Bank,  the  international  NGO  Concern  Worldwide,  and  the  Financial  Reform \nStrengthening  Initiative  (FIRST,  a  consortium  of  several  multilateral  and  bilateral  donors) \ncontributed  financing  to  organize  some  of  the  workshops  (ADB  TA  and  the  Government \nprovided  the  balance  of  workshop  costs).  ADB,  World  Bank,  and  IMF  have  cooperated  and \ncollaborated extremely closely over the past 3 years in developing a long-term financial sector \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n105 \n\nreform program for Lao PDR, of which rural and microfinance is an integral component\u2014rural \nand microfinance is incorporated in the World Bank\u2019s Financial Management Adjustment Credit \nand  in  ADB\u2019s  Banking  Sector  Reform  Program  Loan,  both  approved  in  2002.  AusAid  and \nSwedish International Development Agency (Sida) have contributed to the program by financing \naudits of the state-owned commercial banks and APB. JICA has made an important contribution \nto the program through its support for macroeconomic management and state-owned enterprise \nreform through the MAPS program. ADB has hosted donor roundtable discussions in Lao PDR \nto  brief  donors  on  ADB  activities,  to  be  updated  on  their  program  activities,  and  to  coordinate \noverall efforts to reform the rural and microfinance sector. \n\n \nMore  specific  to  this  JFICT  proposal,  there  has  been  especially  close  coordination \nbetween  ADB  and  the  EU  (and  between  the  ADB  Banking  Sector  Reform  Program  Loan \n[BSRPL] and the ADB Rural Finance TA activities and upcoming loan preparation). Specifically, \nrural finance comprises a small portion of BSRPL; however, BSRPL includes ICT support only \nfor BOL and the two SOCBs (BCEL and LDB). This is because of the separate legal and policy \nstatus  of  APB,  as  well  as  its  lower  capacity  in  core  banking  areas,  compared  to  the  SOCBs, \nwhich has required that APB follow a customized reform and restructuring plan. A key aspect of \nAPB\u2019s reform program is to integrate it more fully with the Lao banking sector, and upgrading its \nICT and MIS is a key part of this program. The EU, in close coordination with ADB\u2019s programs in \nbanking and rural finance, assisted BOL to develop an ICT Strategy for the Lao Banking Sector, \nwhich  includes  the  recommendation  that  \u201cThe  application  roll  out  is  done  according  the  plan \nprepared  by  the  ICT  consultant  ADB/TA  4135-LAO  Preparing  the  Rural  Finance Development \nLoan / IT Needs Review and IT systems Design / January 2004.\u201d \n \n\n7. \n\nDetailed Cost Table  \n\nPlease see the attached detailed cost estimates related to this section.  \n\nLinkage to ADB Strategy and ADB-Financed Operations \n\n1. \n\nLinkage to ADB Strategy \n\nDocument \nNumber \n\nOfficial \ngovernment policy \ndocument \n\nSec.

The  Government  generally  seeks  loan  funds  for  investments  in \nconcrete goods and services, while preferring grant financing for training, capacity building, and \nproject support. Despite this preference, the Government will be borrowing from the ADB loan to \n\n2. \n\n \n5. \n \n\n \n\n\f108 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\ncontinue  the  APB  restructuring  plan  and  upgrade  BOL\u2019s  capacity  to  supervise  MFIs\u2014both \ncomponents  are  mostly  training  and  capacity  building.  The  Government  will  also  borrow  to \npurchase the hardware and software for APB\u2019s ICT and MIS upgrade. The program loan would \nensure  continued  improvements  in  the  policy  and  regulatory  environment  to  support  the \nestablishment and operation of private MFIs.  \n \n\nThe JFICT grant would finance complementary support to APB to finalize ICT and MIS \nspecifications, to manage the bidding process, and to conduct training and capacity building in \nAPB to implement its new system, strategy, and procedures. Given the Government\u2019s tight fiscal \nposition, the amount the Government is already borrowing for other activities, and the poverty \nfocus of the proposed JFICT activities, it would be difficult for the Government to borrow for the \nproposed  activities.  However,  the  overall  package  demonstrates  the  Government  commitment \nto transforming APB into a sustainable, market-oriented rural finance institution. \n \nD. \n \n\nImplementation of the Proposed Grant \n\n1.  \n\nProvide  the  Name  of  the  Implementing  Agency:  Agriculture  Promotion  Bank \n(APB) \n\n \nAll  procurement  under  the  JFICT  grant  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants to provide the services for implementation, management, \nand progress monitoring of the JFICT grant. \n \n\n2. \n\nRisks Affecting Grant Implementation \n\nType of Risk \nImplementation Delay  Government is unable to meet \n\nBrief Description \n\ntargets on schedule \n\nHighly trained people, particularly in \nthe area of ICT, become attractive \nto other employers \n\nGovernment could decide to cancel \npart of its ADB loan, rather than \ninvesting such a high amount in \nAPB\u2019s ICT and MIS.  \nVested interests could result in \npolitical resistance to implementing \nthe new market-orientation of APB \n\nMigration of trained \nstaff \n \n\nCo-financing package \n\nDelays in APB \nrestructuring \n \n\nMeasure to Mitigate the Risk \n\nParticipation in the design process by \nkey stakeholders has given a high \ndegree of ownership to the project and \nrecognition of the urgency of APB \nreforms. \nIn a market economy, commitments to \nremain cannot be required. However, \nAPB\u2019s restructuring process, including \nincentives under a performance-based \nreward system, will make APB overall a \nmore attractive place to work, resulting \nin a high staff retention rate. \nAwareness within the Government \nabout the role of ICT in commercial \nsystems has been created, and \ndialogue on this issue will continue.  \nFour years of initiatives under the ADB \nTA cluster have built strong ownership \nof the reform program, confirmed in \nnumerous agreements and policy \ndocuments, and reconfirmed by senior \nofficials. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n109 \n\n3. \n\nIncremental ADB Costs \n\nComponent \n\nAmount requested  \n\nJustification \n \n\nIncremental Bank Cost \n\n$0 \n\nNot applicable \n\nType of work to be rendered by ADB \n\nNot applicable \n\n \n4. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\nKey Performance Indicator \nFinalized user requirements and \ntechnical specifications  \nTurnkey contract signed \n\nTurnkey contract implemented and \nfinal acceptance given \nTrained banking ICT staff \n\nUpgraded ICT systems rolled out to \nall APB branches \nAccurate, consolidated monthly \nfinancial statements and anti-money \nlaundering reports produced \naccording to international standards. \nImproved efficiency indicators and \nlower costs such as (non-interest \ncosts/assets) for branch operations  \nReal-time management reports for \nfinancial and operational status \nagainst targets \n\nReporting Mechanism \nQuarterly progress report, ADB \nreview mission \nQuarterly progress report, ADB \nreview mission \nQuarterly progress report, ADB \nreview mission \nTraining progress and \nevaluation reports, ADB review \nmissions \nQuarterly progress report, ADB \nreview mission \nOff-site BOL supervision reports \nand reports to Financial \nIntelligence Unit, ADB review \nmissions \nQuarterly financial statements, \nannual external audits, ADB \nreview missions \nManagement reports, ADB \nreview missions \n\nPlan and Timetable for M&E \n\nMonth 3 \n\nMonth 8 \n\nMonth 14 \n\nMonth 24 \n\nQuarterly (as part of associated \nloan monitoring) \n\nQuarterly (as part of associated \nloan monitoring) \n\nQuarterly (as part of associated \nloan monitoring) \n\nQuarterly (as part of associated \nloan monitoring) \n\n5.  \n\nEstimated Disbursement Schedule \n\nFiscal Year (FY) \nFY 2006 \nFY 2007 \nTotal Disbursements \n\nAmount (in $) \n\n272,000 \n200,000 \n472,000 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f110 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nTABLE A13.1: SUMMARY COST TABLE \n(US $) \n \n\n                                                                                                        \n\nProject Components\n\n4.

All  expenditures  to \nbe financed by the JFICT grant will be included in the consultants' contract. Following ADB \nguidelines and practices regarding the management of consultant contracts, a portion of the \nfunds  will  be  disbursed  into  an  account  of  the  consulting  firm  based  on  achievement  of \nmilestones (e.g., payments for mobilization, submission of inception report, midterm report, \ndraft  final  report,  and  final  report).  Reimbursable  items  will  require  that  the  consultants \nsubmit  receipts  for  liquidation  (e.g.,  air  tickets).  Consultants  will  be  responsible  for \npurchasing equipment and supplies, but will be required to submit a minimum of 3 quotations \nto ADB for pre-approval before any purchase.

APB  will  provide \nlocal transport for counterpart staff and for participants in workshops, including air transport \nwhere  required.  APB  will  appoint  a  Project  Director  and  the  Head  of  the  ICT  Division  to \nmanage the project for APB and two full-time counterpart staff from the ICT Division for the \nduration of the TA. Given the critical role that training will play in building APB's capacity to \neffectively  manage  the  turnkey  installation  and  later  manage  its  new  ICT  system  and  MIS, \nAPB will ensure that staff are fully available for training.

and Social Strategy  \n\n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?  \n \n\n \n Yes \n \n No \n\n \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?  \n\n \n Yes \n \n No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Lao PDR: \n \nThe National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES), approved by the National Assembly in October \n2003, identifies access to rural finance as critical to reducing poverty and promoting economic growth. Sustainable \naccess to rural finance is required to support and expand economic activities in the rural areas, where 90% of the \npoor live.  \n \nAt  present,  the  rural  financial  sector  in  Lao  PDR  is  poorly  developed.  While  there  is  demand  for  rural  financial \nservices  (i)  to  support  investment  in  livestock  production,  agriculture  diversification,  and  other  non-farm  income-\ngenerating activities; (ii) to finance household emergencies and consumption; and (iii) for secure savings facilities, \naccess is limited. The \u201cBanking and Financial Sector in Lao PDR \u2013 Financial Sector Note\u201d of 2002 prepared by the \nBank of Lao PDR, ADB, and the World Bank, estimates that only 20% of the 800,000 households in Lao PDR have \naccess  to  some  form  of  formal  or  semi-formal  financial  services  provided  by  commercial  banks,  semi-formal \nmicrofinance  initiatives,  or  village  based  funds.  The  remaining  80%  have  no  access  to  formal  financial  services. \nFinancial services are mainly available in urban areas and to the better off. In the absence of formal rural financial \nservices, the poor in rural areas often rely on family, friends, traders, moneylenders, and other informal sources. \nThe  interest  rates  charged  for  borrowing  from  informal  sources  are  significantly  higher  than  rates  from  formal \nsources, hindering investments by the poor and further impoverishing them. Furthermore, those in the rural areas \nand the poor hold most of their wealth in risky assets such as livestock, gold, or other in-kind items. Only 1 to 5% of \nrural savings are held as bank deposits. Hence, the level of financial intermediation is extremely low.  \n \nOne  reason  for  the  limited  outreach  of  rural  financial  service  is  the  highly  dispersed  population  and  limited \ninfrastructure, resulting in high cost of financial intermediation and information access in rural areas. This challenge \nto expanding rural financial services has been aggravated by the Agriculture Promotion Bank\u2019s (APB's) operations, \nwhich  have  tended  to  distort  the  rural  financial  system.  APB  is  the  Government\u2019s  main  instrument  for  delivering \nformal rural financial services. However, APB's operations have been inefficient because of the substantial policy \nlending carried out on behalf of the Government, its subsidized interest rates, and its common practice of rolling \nover  loans,  dependence  on  donor  and  Government  funding  for  its  operations,  and  involvement  in  non-financial \nservices. Given the subsidized nature of its operations and its weak financial position, APB has not been able to \nmobilize  commercial  funding  to  expand  its  outreach.  As  the  main  player  in  rural  finance  sector,  APB's  operation \nhas been crowding out other microfinance institutions\u2014in areas where APB operates, this effect is direct as APB \nundercuts  potentially  sustainable  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs);  in  other  areas,  where  APB  may  not  operate, \nAPB has created unrealistic expectations among borrowers about the cost of credit, making it difficult for MFIs to \ncharge  sustainable  interest  rates.  Rural  financial  services  have  been  further  constrained  by  unclear  legal  and \nregulatory  framework  for  microfinance,  making  the  establishment  and  operation  of  MFIs  difficult  and  subject  to \narbitrary interference from officials.  \n \nThe  Rural  Financial  Sector  Development  Program  focuses  on  (i)  improving  the  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory \nframework  for  microfinance  operations;  (ii)  supporting  the  ongoing  restructuring  of  APB,  transforming  it  from  a \nsubsidized  policy  lending  institution  to  a  market  oriented,  financially  self-sustainable  commercial  bank  with \ncontinued  focus  on  rural  areas,  in  line  with  the  goals  of  the  NGPES;  and  (iii)  supporting  new  microfinance \ninstitutions  in  rural  areas  through  establishment  of  a  Microfinance  Fund  (MFF)\u2014MFF  will  support  microfinance \ninitiatives  that  contribute  directly  and  indirectly  to  increased  income  and  improved  livelihoods  of  the  poor, \nparticularly in the rural areas. The combined program and project loan components will strengthen the rural finance \nsector.  It  will  foster  sustainable  access  to  rural  financial  services  by  the  rural  poor,  who  currently  have  limited \naccess to formal financial service. Accordingly, sustained access to rural finance will enable the rural poor to invest \nin, and take advantage of, the opportunities in farm and non-farm income generating activities. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f120 \n\n  Appendix 14 \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis   \n\nTargeting Classification: Targeted intervention \n\n \n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nExisting information indicates that the number of poor with access to formal financial services is limited while the \ndemand  is high. A household survey  undertaken in  early  2004 confirm the limited access to formal  and  informal \nfinancial  services,  the  need  and  demand  for  formal  rural  financial  services,  attitude  towards  different  types  and \nproviders  of  financial  services,  and  ability  and  willingness  to  pay  for  services  and  repay  borrowing.  Analysis  is \nbeing further disaggregated by poverty status, family size, educational attainment, gender, and ethnic groupings. \nPreliminary  results  confirm  that  the  poor  have  less  access  to  formal  financial  services  than  the  less  poor.  This \ninformation will help determine what types of microfinance institutions and financial services may be most effective \nin  reaching  the  poor  in  rural  areas  and  meeting  their  needs,  and  thus  should  be  supported  through  the \nMicrofinance Fund. \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\n No  \n\n Yes \n\n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nThe  Program  and  Project  loans  will  involve  the  participation  of  the  Bank  of  Lao  PDR  (BOL),  APB,  other \nGovernment  ministries  and  agencies,  NGOs,  various  funding  agencies  providing  microfinance  services  in  rural \nareas, and existing and potential clients. A diagnostic  assessment of APB  was  undertaken in 2002,  which is the \nbasis  of  its  restructuring  plan.  An  analysis  of  the  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory  framework,  and  BOL\u2019s  capacity  to \nimplement  an  improved  framework,  was  undertaken  in  2003-04.  A  sample  household  survey  was  undertaken  to \nassess the demand and need for rural financial services, attitudes towards different financial services, and ability to \npay for services and to repay any borrowings. The results are being disaggregated by family size, gender, ethnic \ngroupings,  poverty  status,  and  educational  attainment.  It  will  enable  better  understanding  of  the  types  of  rural \nfinancial  services  required  and  appropriate  mode  of  service  delivery.  A  comprehensive  review  of  existing  rural \nfinance providers, focusing on NGOs, is also taking place to provide a comprehensive picture of the status of rural \nfinance sector. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nA consultative approach has been adapted for preparation and implementation of the Program and Project loans. \nThe  policy  framework  for  rural  finance  including  the  Policy  Statement  for  the  Development  of  Sustainable  Rural \nand  Micro  Finance  Sector  and  the  Strategy  and  Action  Plan  for  the  Promotion  of  Sustainable  Rural  and \nMicrofinance  has  been  prepared  through  a  participatory  process  involving  the  Government,  donors,  NGOs, \npractitioners,  and  clients.  The  restructuring  of  APB,  which  was  initiated  by  ADB  technical  assistance  and  will \ncontinue under the Program and Project Loans, is being undertaken in consultation with Government, key donors, \nNGOs,  and  staff  of  APB.  The  MFF  supported  under  the  Project  Loan  will  promote  the  expanded  participation  of \nMFIs as providers of financial services in rural areas. The MFF will support MFIs that promote equitable access to \nfinancial services by women and ethnic groups. \n\n Yes  \n\n No \n\nD.  Gender Development \n\nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nWomen have an important role in ensuring the livelihoods of their families. According to the LECS II (1997-1998), \nand analysis of gender and time use, women work more than men on income generating activities and household \nlabor.  According  to  the  Study  on  Integrating  Human  Concerns  in  Local  Development  in  Three  Provinces  of  Lao \nPDR  (April  2002)  prepared  by  the  Committee  for  Planning  and  Cooperation  in  partnership  with  United  Nations \nCenter  for  Regional  Development,  women  identified  economic  threats  as  a  key  source  of  vulnerability.  Thus, \nensuring women's sustainable access to financial services will enable them to cope with household emergencies \nand economic threats, as well as to invest in income generating activities that benefit the family.  \n \nHowever,  given  the  noticeable  differences  between  men  and  women  in  their  education  attainment,  public  role, \nfamily  attitudes  and  responsibilities,  women  generally  have  less  direct  access  to  formal  financial  services.  The \nProgram  and  Project  loans  are  expected  to  strengthen  the  rural  financial  sector,  which  will  encourage \nestablishment and sustained operations of MFIs that will serve the needs of the rural poor, both men and women. \nGiven  the  constraints  faced  by  women  to  access  formal  financial  services,  the  MFF  has  an  important  role  in \npromoting  MFIs  that  target  women.  Accordingly,  piloting  and  supporting  microfinance  initiatives  that  promote \nequitable participation of women will be prioritized, subject to the MFI\u2019s focus on sustainability.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n121 \n\n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \nThe  outline  procedures  for  the  MFF  articulates  that  for  those  microfinance  initiatives  that  meet  the  legal, \nmanagement, governance, and fiduciary criteria for support, preference will be given to those that benefit women \nand ethnic groups.  \n\n Yes \n\n No \n\nE.  Social Safeguards and other Social Risks \n\n \nItem \n\n \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone  \n Significant \n\n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\n \nNo adverse resettlement impact is anticipated. The Program and \nProject loans are focused on addressing the weaknesses of the \nrural financial sector at the policy and institutional levels, and will \nnot involve acquisition of land or construction. \n\n \nPlan \nRequired \n Full \n\n Short \n\n None \n\n Yes \n\n No \n\n Yes \n\n No  \n\n \nPlan \nRequired \n\n Yes \n\n No \n\n Yes \n\n No  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNo adverse impact is expected. Since the rural poor have limited \naccess  to  formal  financial  services,  they  depend  on  informal \nsources  that  are  expensive\u2014typical  moneylender  interest  rates \nare 10% per month (120% per year) or more. The Program and \nProject  loans  will  help  strengthen  the  rural  financial  sector  and \nencourage  sustainable  and  market-oriented  microfinance \ninstitutions, as alternatives to informal sources. Sustainable MFI \nrates of about 35% per year will be a marked improvement over \nmoneylender rates. \nThe issue of possible retrenchment due to APB restructuring was \nreviewed.  Based  on  BOL  guidelines  and  existing  human \nresource  management  practices  of  other \nstate-owned \ncommercial  banks,  and  available  information  on  APB\u2019s  current \nand  future  labor  requirements,  there  will  likely  be  minimal \nretrenchment  due  to  APB  restructuring,  which  will  addressed \nthrough  natural  attrition  (retirement,  transfers,  and  voluntary \nresignation). APB should prepare a mitigation plan to be funded \nby the Ministry of Finance if, based on the business projections \nof APB branches, it is determined that significant retrenchment is \nrequired. This will be reflected in the governance agreement. \n\n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\n \nNo adverse impact is expected. The Program and Project loans \nare  expected  to  strengthen  the  rural  financial  sector,  which  will \nencourage establishment and sustained operations of MFIs that \nwill  serve  the  differing  needs  of  the  rural  poor,  including  ethnic \ngroups. The Microfinance Fund established under the TA Loan is \nexpected to pilot and promote viable, best-practice MFIs serving \na  diverse  population,  including  ethnic  groups.  Under  the  MFF, \npreference  will  be  given  to  supporting  microfinance  initiatives \nthat benefit women and ethnic groups.  \n \nNone expected. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nResettlement \n\n \n \nAffordability \n\n \n \nLabor \n\n Not \nsignificant \n \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not \nsignificant \n \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not \nsignificant \n \n\n None \n\n  \nItem \n\n \n \nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone  \n\n Significant \n\n Not \nsignificant \n \n\n None \n\n \nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerabilities \n \n\n Significant \n\n Not \nsignificant \n \n\n None \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 17 July 2006) \n", "Currency Unit\nKN1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "kip (KN) \n$0.0001 \nKN10,142 \n", " \nABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nALCO \nAPB \nBCEL \nBOL \nBSRPL \nCCSP \nEA \nEU \nFIRST \nIA \nICT \nIFRS \nIMF \nJFICT \nJFPR \nJICA \nLao PDR \nLDB \nLWU \nMFF \nMFFMU \nMFI \nMIS \nMOF \nNGO \nNGPES \nNPEP \nNPL \nPMO \nPSC \nRFSDP \nRMFC \nSCU \nSEGF \nSERD \nSida \nSOCB \nSRC \nTA \n", "financial sector reform strengthening initiative \nimplementing agency \ninformation and communications technology \ninternational financial reporting standards \nInternational Monetary Fund \n", "\u2013  Asian Development Bank \n\u2013  Asset and Liability Management Committee \n\u2013  Agriculture Promotion Bank \n\u2013  Banque pour le Commerce Exterieur du Laos \n\u2013  Bank of Lao PDR \n\u2013  banking sector reform program loan \n\u2013  Cooperative de Credit pour le Solution aux Petites Unites de Production\n\u2013  executing agency \n\u2013  European Union \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Japan Fund for Information and Communications Technology \n\u2013  Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction \n\u2013  Japan International Cooperation Agency \n\u2013  Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \n\u2013  Lao Development Bank \n\u2013  Lao Women\u2019s Union \n\u2013  microfinance fund \n\u2013  Microfinance Fund Management Unit \n\u2013  microfinance institution \n\u2013  management information system \n\u2013  Ministry of Finance \n\u2013  nongovernment organization \n\u2013  National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy \n\u2013  National Poverty Eradication Program \n\u2013  nonperforming loan \n\u2013  Prime Minister\u2019s Office \n\u2013  program steering committee \n\u2013  Rural Finance Sector Development Program \n\u2013  Rural and Microfinance Committee \n\u2013  savings and credit union \n\u2013  Governance, Finance, and Trade Division \n\u2013  Southeast Asia Department \n\u2013  Swedish International Development Agency \n\u2013  state-owned commercial bank \n\u2013  staff review committee \ntechnical assistance \n\u2013 \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "UNCDF \nUNDP \nVSCG \n", "\u2013  United Nations Capital Development Fund \n\u2013  United Nations Development Programme \n\u2013  village savings and credit group \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies ends on 30 September. \n", "(ii) \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", "Vice President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam Leader \nTeam Members \n \n \n", "C.
