The  Project  will  not  cause  any  adverse  environmental \nimpacts. The ensuing investment project will be categorized at a later \nstage. \n \nThe  Ho  Chi  Minh  City\u2013Long  Thanh\u2013Dau  Giay  (HLD)  Expressway \nTechnical  Assistance  Project  (the  Project)  will  assist  the  Government \nof Viet Nam (the Government) to (i) complete documentation required \nfor  construction  of \n(ii)  undertake \nstrengthening  and  capacity  building  at  Vietnam  Expressway \nCorporation (VEC). The project design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan  (SEDP)  for \n2006\u20132010  identified  the  need  for  a  network  of  high  capacity,  high-\nspeed expressways to complement the network of national, provincial, \nand  city  roads.  Under  the  Government's  Expressway  Master  Plan, \ndeveloped  with  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  funding  under  the \ntechnical  assistance  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the \nExpressway Network Development Plan project approved in 2005 (TA \n4695-VIE)  a  short-term  program  of  priority  expressway  projects  was \nidentified. This includes the HLD Expressway. \n \nGreater Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) is the largest city in Viet Nam and \nthe  country\u2019s  economic  hub.  However,  the  road  network  both  within \nand  around  HCMC  is  becoming  heavily  congested,  travel  speeds  are \nreducing, and transport costs are increasing. There is an urgent need \nto provide relief to the city roads connecting the center of HCMC and \nthe  port  area  with  roads  leading  north  from  the  city  to  central  and \nnorthern  Viet  Nam.  HCMC  also  lies  at  a  critical  junction  on  the \ntransport  network  for  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS),  so \nimprovements  to  the  network  around  HCMC  will  remove  a  major \nbottleneck on the GMS network. \n \nIn  2004,  VEC  was  established  as  a  state-owned  enterprise  (SOE) \nunder the Ministry of Transport (MOT). VEC was established to invest \nin  expressway  construction,  management,  and  operation  and \nmaintenance.  To  date,  it  has  inadequate  experience  in  project \nmanagement,  financial  management,  procurement,  and  safeguard \nissues.  Institutional  capacity  building  through  the  Project  will  enable \nVEC to manage this and similar projects in the future. \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nrequired \n\n \nProject Investment \nPlan  \n \nFinancing Plan \n\nImpact and Outcome  The  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  a  reduction  in  the  cost  and  travel \ntimes for the movement of passengers and goods between HCMC and \nthe provinces to the north and northeast and south of the city through \nthe construction of the HLD Expressway. The outcomes of the Project \nto  commence \nwill  be  completion  of  documentation \nconstruction  of  the  HLD  Expressway,  and  VEC  strengthened  as  a \ncommercially-oriented infrastructure provider with enhanced capacity.  \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $11.22  million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $0.90 million.  \n \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  $10.0  million  equivalent  to \nthe  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet Nam.  The  loan  will  be  denominated  in \nspecial  drawing  rights  from  ADB\u2019s  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF) \nSpecial  Funds  resources,  with  a  term  of  32  years  including  a  grace \nperiod of 8 years, an interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The Government will contribute \nabout $1.22 million equivalent. \n \nThe Borrower for the Project will be the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. \nThe Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be responsible for repayment of the \nloan and will make the proceeds of the loan available to VEC through \nonlending arrangements (Standard arrangements for onlending of \nOverseas Development Assistance funds by MOF will apply, under \nwhich MOF charges a fee of 0.2% on outstanding amounts). \n \n30 June 2010 \n \n31 December 2009 \n\n \nAllocation and \nRelending Terms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nVEC \n \nVEC  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall  execution  of  the  Project,  with \nplanning  and  implementation  delegated  to  a  project  implementation \nunit headed by a project director. VEC will engage and direct the work \nof consultants, and be responsible for procurement. \n \nNo major contracts will be procured under the Project. Procurement of \nsmall  items  of  equipment,  surveys,  and  other  similar  items  will  be \nincluded in the consulting services contract and will be procured using \nshopping  procedures \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nThe  Project  will  fund  consulting  services  to  be  undertaken  under  a \nsingle contract. VEC will recruit an international consulting firm for the \nconsulting services in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Quality  and  cost-\nbased selection procedures will apply, full proposals will be requested, \nand evaluation will be based on an 80:20 ratio of quality to cost. The \nconsulting services will be implemented by an international consulting \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nassistance, \n\nprocurement \n\ndevelopment, \n\nfirm in association with national consultants. About 821 person-months \nwill  be  required,  of  which  153  will  be  from  international  experts  and \n668 from  national  experts.  The  consultants  will  have  expertise  in \nproject  management,  expressway  design,  road  safety,  traffic  control \nand  toll  collection  systems,  environmental  and  resettlement  planning, \nsocial \norganizational \nstructures,  business  development  plans,  financial  management,  and \npublic-private partnerships in the transport sector. The duration of the \nconsulting services will be about 18 months. \n \nThe principal direct benefits that will be generated by the construction \nof  the  HLD  Expressway  will  be  (i)  an  increase  in  the  efficiency  of  the \nmovement  of  goods  and  people  in  the  area  around  HCMC,  the \nprovinces  surrounding  the  city,  and  along  the  GMS  southern  and \neastern  economic  corridors;  (ii)  a  reduction  in  transport  costs  in  the \nsame  area;  and  (iii)  a  reduction  in  the  social  and  economic  costs  of \ntraffic  accidents.  As  transport  costs  are  a  key  input  to  economic \nactivities,  the  indirect  benefits  of  the  construction  of  the  expressway \nwill  be  an  increase  in  economic  growth  and  a  contribution  to  the \nGovernment\u2019s overall poverty reduction program. \n \nThe main risk to the Project is delayed implementation caused by slow \nfinalization  of  the  single  consulting  services  contract  that  will  be \nimplemented  under  the  Project.  This  is  being  addressed  through \nadvance  contracting  action  for  the  Project\u2019s  consulting  services.  A \nfurther  risk  is  VEC\u2019s  limited  capacity  and  experience  of  project \nmanagement  for  major  projects.  This  is  being  mitigated  through  the \nProject\u2019s  component \ninstitutional \nstrengthening of VEC.  \n\nregulatory  and \n\nto  address \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\n \n\n\fo\n105  00\u2019E\n\no\n107  00\u2019E\n\nPhuoc Long\n\nBinh Phuoc\n\nBinh Long\n\nLam Dong\n\nBao Loc \n\nC A M B O D I A\n\n11  00\u2019No\n\nDau Tieng\nLake\n\nTay Ninh\n\nTay Ninh\n\nBinh Duong\n\nLa Nga Lake\n\nTrang Bang\n\nThu Dau Mot\n\nDong Nai\n\nDau Giay\n\nBien Hoa\n\nHo Chi Minh\n\nLong Thanh\n\nBinh Thuan\n11  00\u2019No\n\nLong An\n\nHo Chi Minh City\n\nBa Ria-Vung Tau\n\nGo Cong Dong\n\nVung Tau\n\nChau Doc\n\nDong Thap\n\nAn Giang\n\nLong Xuyen\n\nSa Dec\n\nCan Tho\n\nCan Tho\n\nRach Gia\n\nKien Giang\n\nTrung Luong\n\nTien Giang\n\nMy Tho\n\nBen Tre\n\nBen Tre\n\nVinh Long\n\nVinh Long\n\nTra Vinh\n\nTra Vinh\n\nSoc Trang\n\nSoc Trang\n\nSOCIALIST REPUBLIC\nOF VIET NAM\n HO CHI MINH CITY\u2013\nLONG THANH\u2013DAU GIAY EXPRESSWAY\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT\n\nBac Lieu\n\nBac Lieu\n\nCa Mau\n\nS o u t h   C h i n a   S e a\n\n9  00\u2019No\n\nCa Mau\n\nN\n\n107  00\u2019Eo\n\n9  00\u2019No\n\nHo Chi Minh City-Long Thanh-Dau Giay Expressway\n\nHo Chi Minh City-Trung Luong Expressway (Under Construction)\n\nTrung Luong-Can Tho Expressway (Future Construction)\n\nLAO\nPEOPLE'S\nDEMOCRATIC\nREPUBLIC\n\nNam Can\n\nKilometers\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nNational Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nNational Highway 1 (QL 1)\n\nNational Highway (Other)\n\nOther Road\n\nRiver\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\n105  00\u2019Eo\n\n105  00'Eo\n\n110  00'Eo\n\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC\nOF CHINA\n\nHA NOI\n\n20  00'No\n\no20  00'N\n\nHai Phong\nGulf of\nTonkin\n\nVinh\n\nDa Nang\n\nQuy Nhon\n\nCAMBODIA\n\nPROJECT AREA\n\nGulf of\nThailand\n10  00'No\n\nNha Trang\n\nDa Lat\nHo Chi Minh City\n\nVung Tau\n\n10  00'No\n\nSouth  China  Sea\n\n105  00'Eo\n\n110  00'Eo\n\n07-1651 RM\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Ho  Chi  Minh  City\u2013Long  Thanh\u2013Dau  Giay  (HLD) \nExpressway Technical Assistance Project (the Project). \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nIn 2006, the Vietnamese economy  expanded by an estimated 8.0%, one of the fastest \nrates  in  the  world.  This  performance  came  on  top  of  an  average  annual  growth  rate  of  7.5% \nover the period 2001\u20132005. For 2006, the industry and services sectors contributed more than \n90% of total gross domestic product (GDP) growth, and industry expanded by a robust 10.4%, \nslightly  below  the  previous  year\u2019s  rate. 1 One  of  the  consequences  of  this  sustained,  rapid, \ngrowth has been an equally rapid increase in the use of motorized vehicles which is leading to \nincreased  congestion  on  the  highway  network.  If  industry  is  to  continue  as  a  major  driver  of \ngrowth in the Vietnamese economy, there is a need to maintain the development of the highway \ntransport  system  so  that  goods  and  people  can  be  moved  efficiently.  An  overview  of  the  road \nsubsector is in Appendix 2. \n \n3. \nExpressways  are  roads  designed  to  allow  a  large  number  of  vehicles  to  move  freely \nbetween  major  centers,  at  speed,  and  with  a  high  level  of  safety.  Access  is  only  provided  at \njunctions  that  are  widely  spaced  and  are  planned  to  high  safety  standards.  Expressways  are \nusually expensive to construct and operate, so it is not economical to maintain a dense network \nof expressways. Therefore, these roads must be supplemented by other types of high standard \nand secondary roads. In Viet Nam, traffic is growing rapidly, typically more than 10% a year, so \ncongestion  on  many  major  roads  is  an  increasing  problem  and  an  inappropriate  traffic  mix  is \ncontributing  to  severe  road  safety  problems.  The  construction  of  expressways  along  key \ncorridors  would  provide  large  capacity  highways  to  reduce  congestion,  absorb  traffic  growth, \nand reduce the number of road safety incidents.  \n \nGreater  Ho  Chi  Minh  City  (HCMC)  is  the  largest  city  in  Viet  Nam  and  the  country\u2019s \n4. \neconomic  hub,  with  a  population  forecast  to  grow  by  2.1%  per  annum  from  the  current \n7.9 million2 to 10.3 million by 2020. Growth in annual trade volumes, in terms of value, through \nHCMC\u2019s  port  exceeded  15%  in  2006.  With  continued  growth  of  the  economy  expected  in  the \nmedium term, there is significant potential for household incomes to rise, enabling many more \nfamilies  to  afford  to  purchase  cars,  and  for  a  significant  increase  in  the  number  of  journeys \nundertaken.  The  road  network  both  within  and  around  HCMC  is  already  becoming  heavily \ncongested, travel speeds are reducing, and transport costs are increasing. There is an urgent \nneed to provide relief to the city roads connecting the center of HCMC and the port area, with \n(i) the suburbs to the north and northeast of the city and further out to the roads leading north \nfrom  the  city  to  central  and  northern  Viet  Nam,  and  (ii)  the  major  subregional  transport  routes \nalong  the  southern  and  eastern  economic  corridors  that  meet  at  HCMC  and  form  part  of  the \nGreater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Transport Network under the GMS program. \n \n5. \nThe  provinces  of  the  Mekong  Delta  together  comprise  Viet  Nam\u2019s  largest  rice  growing \narea. Each year, the delta contributes 50% of Viet Nam\u2019s total rice output and about 90% of the \n\n                                                 \n1   Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2007. Asian Development Outlook 2007. Manila. \n2   Estimate includes both permanent and transient population. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ntotal  rice  export  volume.  By  2010,  the  delta  area  is  projected  to  export  an  annual  output  of \n4 million\u20135 million tons of rice. The output from the delta\u2019s agroforestry and fisheries industries \ntogether  accounts  for  40%  of  the  country\u2019s  total  production.  In  total,  the  output  from  these \nprovinces  contributes  about  18%  to  the  national  GDP.  Being  the  country's  largest  food \nproduction  zone  requires  that  the  area  is  serviced  by  a  comprehensive  transport  network. \nGovernment  plans  for  the  delta  area  include  extensive  improvements  at  all  levels  of  the  road \nand waterways networks. Given projections of annual increases of about 20% in the total annual \nexport outputs from the delta area, and the increasing congestion on existing highways, there is \nan urgent need to improve road connections. \n \n6. \nIn  2004,  Vietnam  Expressway  Corporation  (VEC)  was  established  as  a  state-owned \nenterprise  (SOE)  under  the  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT).  VEC  was  established  to  invest  in \nexpressway  construction,  management,  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M).  Using  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  funds  provided  under  the  Expressway  Network  Development  Plan  \nProject3 a  study  was  undertaken  to  assist  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam  (the  Government)  to \nidentify  actions  required  to  strengthen  the  organizational  structure  of  VEC  and  to  facilitate  a \ninfrastructure  provider.  This  study \nchange \nrecommended  changes  to  both  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  expressways  and  the \norganization  structure  of  VEC.  To  date,  VEC  has \nin  project \nmanagement, financial management, procurement, and safeguard issues. Institutional capacity \nbuilding through the Project will enable VEC to manage this and similar projects in the future. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nto  a  commercially-oriented \n\ninadequate  experience \n\nfrom  an  SOE \n\n1. \n\nThe Government\u2019s Strategy \n\n7. \nThe Government is acutely aware  of the impact of inadequate infrastructure on growth \nand  poverty  reduction,  and  is  already  beginning  to  see  infrastructure  bottlenecks  affecting \nforeign investment. It also wishes to share development more equitably with parts of the country \nthat  are  remote  from  the  major  urban  areas\u2014Hanoi,  HCMC,  Da  Nang,  and  others.  As  part  of \nthe  Government\u2019s  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan  (SEDP)  for  2006\u20132010,4 the  transport \nsector  is  expected  to  promote  economic  growth,  poverty  reduction,  safety  enhancement, \nenvironmental  protection,  and  human  resource  development.  For  the  road  sector,  the \nGovernment  has  noted  the  need  for  a  network  of  high  capacity,  high-speed  expressways  to \ncomplement  the  network  of  national,  provincial,  and  city  roads.  Under  the  Expressway  Master \nPlan, developed with ADB assistance (footnote 3), a short-term program (2006\u20132015) of priority \nexpressway projects was identified consisting of 21 projects covering 1,968 kilometers (km) with \nan  estimated  construction  cost  of  $11.556  billion.5 A  medium-term  program  (2016\u20132025)  was \nalso  proposed  that  included  another  eight  projects  covering  an  additional  875  km  with  an \nestimated construction cost of $5.238 billion. \n \n\n2. \n\nLessons  \n\n8. \nViet  Nam  Country  Portfolio  Review  Missions  have  noted  that  there  have  been \nimplementation delays in previous road projects, in particular during the project start-up phase. \nProject designs have required that project supervision consultants prepare detailed designs and \nbidding  documents  for  civil  works,  meaning  that  the  initial  1\u20133  years  of  the  loan  period  are \n                                                 \n3   ADB. 2005.

The  bulk  of  the  loan  remains \nundisbursed during this period, which causes the Government to incur substantial commitment \nand  other  financing  costs,  especially  for  ordinary  capital  resources  loans.  Delays  in  recruiting \nconsultants  or  preparing  detailed  designs  have  led  directly  to  delays  in  award  of  civil  works, \nexacerbating the situation. This is addressed in the design of the Project by: (i) using advance \naction for the selection of consultants, and (ii) incorporating all safeguard-related planning and \nprocurement-related  activities  (for  the  subsequent  investment  project)  in  the  scope  of  the \nProject. By the time the investment project loan has been processed and become effective (or \nthe Government has found other means to finance the highway\u2019s construction), land acquisition \nand  resettlement  plans  will  be  ready  for  implementation,  and  all  civil  works  and  consulting \nservices contracts will be ready for award. \n \n\n3. \n\nADB\u2019s Strategy \n\n9. \nViet Nam has a relatively inefficient and expensive transport system. As set out in ADB\u2019s \ncountry  strategy  and  program  for  Viet  Nam, 6 ADB\u2019s  strategy  will  support  the  Government's \ninvestment program to improve transport infrastructure and reduce transport costs. The program \nof investment projects under the country strategy and program form three thrusts that are in line \nwith  the  SEDP.  The  first  thrust  supports  investment  projects  to  reduce  critical  transport \nbottlenecks hampering economic growth in the main development centers. Projects will include \ninvestments in urban transport and priority expressway and railway facilities to facilitate the safe \nand efficient movement of goods and people around, through, and between national centers of \nmajor  economic  activity.  The  second  thrust  will  support  social  equity  aspects  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s \ntransport  needs  through  support  to  the  development  of  provincial  and  district  roads.  The  third \nthrust  complements  the  first  two  by  bringing  regional  dimensions  to  the  development  of  the \ntransport  network  in  terms  of  connectivity,  including  multimodal  transport  modes  and \ncompetitiveness. \n \nUnder the Expressway Network Development Plan (footnote 3), ADB provided technical \n10. \nassistance  (TA)  that  responded  to  the  Government\u2019s  request  for  assistance  to  plan  the \ndevelopment of an expressway network. The TA funded a study that prepared an Expressway \nMaster Plan for the long-term development of the country\u2019s expressway network, and identified \npriority expressway projects. The study identified the HLD Expressway as a high priority project \nand, based on a preliminary assessment, found the project to be economically, financially, and \ntechnically  viable.  A  summary  of  the  preliminary  economic  and  financial  analysis7 for  the  HLD \nExpressway is in Appendix 3. The HLD Expressway was included in the 2004 Urban Transport \nMaster  Plan  and  Feasibility  Study  in  Ho  Chi  Minh  Metropolitan  Area  (often  referred  to  as  the \nHOUTRANS study), prepared with assistance from the Japan International Cooperation Agency \n(JICA).  \n \nIn  May  2006,  the  consultants  engaged  under  the  Expressway  Network  Development \n11. \nPlan TA were instructed to undertake a full feasibility study to confirm that the HLD Expressway \nis technically, economically, and financially viable, and that the impacts of the HLD Expressway \nare socially and environmentally acceptable. Under this feasibility study, the TA consultants will \nprepare  a  project  that  is  suitable  for  funding  by  ADB  and  meets  the  requirements  of  the \nGovernment.  The  outputs  from  the  feasibility  study  will  include  (i) a  review  of  preliminary \nengineering  designs  for  the  proposed  expressway  to  confirm  compliance  with  technical \n                                                 \n6   ADB. 2006.

Assumptions  of  costs,  traffic  volumes,  and  toll  levels  will  be  reviewed  and \nconfirmed under an ongoing ADB-funded project preparatory TA (PPTA) under Expressway Network Development \nPlan Project (footnote 3). \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nresources;  and \n\nstandards and good practice; (ii) a detailed economic and financial assessment of the project to \nconfirm economic and financial viability of the expressway in terms of the requirements of ADB \nand the Government; (iii) an assessment of the social impacts of the expressway together with a \nfull resettlement plan, a gender strategy, a program for HIV/AIDS awareness, and, if required, \nan ethnic minority development plan; (iv) an environmental impact assessment (EIA), including \nan environmental management plan (EMP) covering construction and operation phases of the \nexpressway;  (v)  assessments  of  VEC\u2019s  capacity  to  implement  the  project  in  terms  of \nmanagerial,  financial,  technical,  social  (including  resettlement  and  ethnic  minorities),  and \nidentifying  contract  packages  and  an \nenvironmental  skills  and \nimplementation schedule to meet the requirements to implement construction of the expressway \nin an efficient, economical manner. The feasibility study services commenced in June 2007, the \ndraft  final  report  is  to  be  submitted  in  December  2007,  and  the  services  are  expected  to  be \ncompleted by the end of January 2008.  \n \n12. \nProcessing  of  an  investment  loan  to  fund  construction  of  the  HLD  Expressway  is \nexpected  to  commence  in  January  2008. 8  However,  before  construction  work  can  begin, \ndetailed  engineering  designs,  resettlement  plans,  and  environmental  documentation  must  be \nprepared  and  civil  works  contractors  procured.  The  Project  will  fund  consulting  services  to \nundertake these pre-construction activities. The services under the Project are to be based on \n(i)  preliminary  designs  and  feasibility  studies  prepared  by  VEC,  and  (ii)  the  outputs  of  the \nfeasibility  study.  The  civil  works  to  be  designed  and  procured  under  the  Project  will  be \nconstructed using funds from the investment loan.  \n \n\n(vi) \n\n4. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n13. \nSince  external  support  to  Viet  Nam\u2019s  road  sector  commenced  in  1993,  many  projects \nhave supported the road subsector in Viet Nam (Appendix 4). Initially, these projects focused on \nrehabilitating National Highway 1 (QL1), the highway running along the east coast of Viet Nam \nthat acts as the central spine for the road network. These QL1 projects were complemented by \nimprovements  under  ADB-funded  projects 9  to  highways  connecting  QL1  to  the  Viet  Nam \nsections of GMS economic corridors. As work on improving QL1 is drawing to a close, projects \nare  increasingly  focusing  on  other  parts  of  the  road  network.  ADB\u2019s  Provincial  Roads \nImprovement  Sector  Project 10 is  upgrading  provincial  roads  in  17 provinces  in  the  northern \nuplands  and  Red  River  Delta  regions  while  the  Central  Region  Transport  Networks \nImprovement  Sector  Project11 is  addressing  the  removal  of  transport  constraints  on  economic \nand social development in the rural areas of 19 provinces in central Viet Nam. The upgrading of \nrural  roads  in  18  provinces  was  addressed  under  ADB\u2019s  Rural  Infrastructure  Sector  Project,12 \nand  rural  roads  are  being  improved  in  40  provinces  across  the  country  with  funding  from  the \n                                                 \n8   The  Government  has  proposed  that  the  cost  of  construction  of  the  HLD  Expressway  be  funded  from  loans  from \n\nADB and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC). \n\n9   ADB.  1998.

The benefit to \nusers of the expressway will be a reduction in transport costs for the movement of passengers \nand  goods  (i)  between  HCMC  and  the  provinces  to  the  north  and  northeast  of  the  city,  and \n(ii) along transport links on the GMS southern and eastern economic corridors. The outcomes of \nthe Project will be completion of documentation required to commence construction of the HLD \nExpressway,  and  Vietnam  Expressway  Corporation  (VEC)  strengthened  as  a  commercially-\noriented infrastructure provider with enhanced capacity. \n \nThe  proposed  HLD  Expressway  will  connect  to  the  HCMC  inner  city  road  network  in \n15. \nDistrict 2. Moving away from the city center, it will intersect with HCMC\u2019s 2nd and 3rd ring roads \nand  with  QL51  at  Long  Thanh.  From  Long  Thanh,  the  proposed  alignment  passes  by  the \nproposed site of the new HCMC International Airport and ends at Dau Giay, a total distance of \nabout 57 km. At Dau Giay, it will connect with QL1, the main north\u2013south highway linking HCMC \nwith Hanoi. The proposed alignment will (i) relieve congestion on the existing QL 1 through Bien \nHoa for traffic entering HCMC from the north, (ii) connect the city center to new suburbs being \ndeveloped to the west of HCMC, and (iii) provide high-speed access from the new airport to the \ncity center. The expressway will be a high-speed, high capacity, limited access, toll road built to \ninternational expressway design standards. It is to be constructed in two stages: stage 1 will be \na four-lane divided expressway that will be widened to six to eight lanes under stage 2, as traffic \nvolume justifies the additional investment. \n \nB. \n \n16. \nproposed HLD Expressway, and (ii) a program to strengthen VEC.  \n \n\nOutputs  from  the  Project  will  include  completion  of  (i)  pre-construction  activities  for  the \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nHLD Expressway Design and Procurement Component  \n\nThis  component  will  address  pre-construction  activities \n\nthe  proposed  HLD \n17. \nExpressway.

Given  the  importance  of  this  corridor  to  the  national  economy, \nagreements  have  been  reached  between  the  governments  of  Japan  and  Viet  Nam  for  the \ndevelopment  of  expressways  along  this  corridor  to  be  one  of  three  main  foci  of  development \nassistance from the Government of Japan. However, given the size of investment needs on this \ncorridor, ADB has been invited to provide financing for construction of the HLD Expressway on \na  parallel  cofinancing  basis  with  JBIC.  Given  the  limited  capacity  of  VEC  to  undertake  its \nresponsibilities to construct, manage, and operate and maintain an expressway network, there \nis a need for long-term support to build capacity within VEC. ADB has been involved with VEC \nfrom an early stage and has developed a strong relationship with its senior management. The \ninvolvement of ADB in the HLD Expressway will allow ADB the opportunity to continue support \nto strengthening and capacity building programs. \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nThe  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $11.22  million,  including  taxes  of \n\n20. \n$0.90 million. It is summarized in Table 1 and detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 5. \n \nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n21. \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  will  provide  a  loan  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  of \n$10.0 million  equivalent.  The  loan  will  be  denominated  in  special  drawing  rights  from  ADB\u2019s \nAsian Development Fund (ADF) Special Funds resources, with a term of 32 years including a \ngrace period of 8 years, an interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% \nper annum thereafter. The Borrower for the Project will be the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. \nThe Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be responsible for repayment of the loan and will make the \nproceeds  of  the  loan  available  to  VEC  through  onlending  arrangements16 under  a  subsidiary \nagreement  between  MOF,  on  behalf  of  the  Government,  and  VEC  (Subsidiary  Loan \n\n                                                 \n15  Under Vietnamese law, all SOEs have to convert to limited liability companies by July 2010. \n16 Standard  arrangements  for  onlending  of  overseas  development  assistance  funds  by  MOF  will  apply  under  which \n\nMOF charges an annual fee of 0.2% on outstanding amounts. \n\n\fAgreement).

For the HLD Expressway, the intention \nis that ADB will start processing the investment loan in early 2008 when the draft final report for \nthe expressway feasibility study, being prepared under the Expressway Network Development \nPlan  (footnote  3),  becomes  available,  subject  to  the  report  demonstrating  viability.  Detailed \ndesigns  and  bid  documents  for  the  first  civil  works  contract  will  be  completed  by  end  of  2008 \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fenabling procurement of civil works for these first contracts to be completed by the mid 2009. \nProcurement  of  all  civil  works  contracts  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  end  of  2009.  The \nconsultants  will  assist  VEC  and  the  districts  in  the  expressway  area  to  implement  the \nresettlement  plan  such  that  by  the  end  of  2009  all  construction  contracts  may  be  awarded. \nConstruction  will  require  4  years,  to  begin  in  mid-2009  and  be  completed  by  mid-2013.  An \noutline implementation schedule is in Appendix 7. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n24. \nThe Project will not require civil works procurement. Equipment will be procured for the \nProject  but  the  items  required  will  be  small  and  few  in  number\u2014mainly  computers,  design \nsoftware and equipment, testing and survey equipment, and similar items. Procurement of this \nequipment  will  be  included  in  the  consulting  services  contract  and  will  be  procured  using \nshopping  procedures  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended \nfrom time to time). \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n25. \nThe  single  consulting  services  contract  will  be  implemented  by  an  international \nconsulting firm in association with national consultants. About 821 person-months input will be \nrequired  of  which  153  will  be  from  international  experts  and  668  from  national  experts.  The \nconsultants  will  have  expertise  in  project  management;  design  of  expressway  alignments, \npavements,  bridges,  culverts,  toll  collection  and  traffic  control  information  systems,  and  road \nsafety  systems;  transport  economics;  financial  analysis  and  assessment;  EIA;  preparation  of \nresettlement  plans;  assessment  of  impacts  on  ethnic  minorities;  assessment  of  gender  and \nother  social  issues;  social  development;  procurement  assistance;  organizational  structures; \nbusiness  development  plans;  financial  management;  and  public-private  partnerships  in  the \ntransport  sector.  Outline  terms  of  reference  are  in  Appendix  8.  The  consulting  services  will \ninclude  amounts  for  surveys,  aerial  photography,  equipment,  and  other  inputs  essential  for \neffective and timely project implementation. The duration of the consulting services will be about \n18 months.  \n \nThe  activities  to  be  funded  under  the  Project  will  be  undertaken  through  consulting \n26. \nservices  under  a  single  contract.  VEC  will  recruit  an  international  consulting  firm  for  the \nconsulting  services  using  quality  and  cost-based  selection  procedures,  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Full \ntechnical proposals will be used. To calculate the firms\u2019 total scores, the technical proposals will \nbe  given  a  weight  of  80%  and  the  financial  proposals  will  be  given  a  weight  of  20%.  A \nprocurement plan including this contract package is in Appendix 9.   \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n27. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government,  MOT,  and  VEC.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n28. \nDisbursements  for  the  single  contract  for  consulting  services  will  be  through  direct \npayment procedures defined in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from \ntime to time).  \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nVEC  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  adequate  to  identify  goods  and \n29. \nservices  financed  from  the  proceeds  of  the  ADB  loan,  financing  resources  received, \nexpenditures  incurred  for  the  Project,  an  audit  of  resettlement  expenditures,  and  use  of  local \nfunds.  Within  6  months  of  the  close  of  the  fiscal  year,  VEC  will  submit  audited  annual  project \naccounts to ADB, which provide a detailed description of the source of funds and expenditures \nmade.  Annual  project  accounts  will  be  audited  by  an  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  the \nauditor\u2019s terms of reference will be approved by ADB before commencement of work. The audit \nresults will be submitted to ADB on an annual basis. \n \n30. \nRegular  progress  reports  on  the  Project  will  be  prepared  by  the  project  consultants, \nreviewed  by  VEC,  and  submitted  to  ADB  every  quarter.  Progress  reports  will  include  a \ndescription  of \nimplementation  of  resettlement  plans, \nprocurement and contractual status, and highlights of any implementation issues. The progress \nreports should also contain a summary of project accounts, including details of the latest project \nexpenditures  and  contract  amounts.  These  reports  will  include  an  evaluation  of  progress  in \nimplementing the Project. Updated resettlement plans and EIA reports for the HLD Expressway \nwill be submitted as separate reports and will take account of detailed designs. Within 3 months \nof completion of the Project, VEC will furnish to ADB a project completion report covering details \nof  the  project  implementation,  costs,  and  an  evaluation  of  the  Project\u2019s  success  in  meeting \nperformance targets. \n \n\nthe  physical  progress,  status  of \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n31. \nUnder  the  feasibility  studies  for  both  expressways,  project  performance  management \nsystems will be prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Project Performance Management System17 \nand integrated with existing management information systems. During the proposed investment \nloans  for  construction  of  each  expressway,  sample  surveys  will  be  conducted  to  establish \nbaseline data for subsequent performance monitoring; and will establish pre-project social and \neconomic living conditions for the direct project beneficiaries. The baseline and impact surveys \nwill  include  appropriate  control  areas  and  will  assess  all  interventions  under  the  Project, \nincluding  resettlement  and  other  safeguard  interventions  that  affect  the  livelihood  of  project \nbeneficiaries. In addition, a set of indicators reflecting transport costs, tariffs, and mobility will be \ndeveloped to assess the effects of the improved transport infrastructure. District indicators will \ninclude economic activity, and health and education indicators. The impacts of development on \nthe poor resulting from the expressway will receive particular attention. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n32. \nIn addition to regular reviews by ADB, a midterm review of project implementation will be \ncarried out. Representatives of ADB and the Government will take part in the review. The review \nwill allow for any necessary midcourse corrections. \n\n                                                 \n17  ADB. 2006. Operations Manual.

The  principal  direct \nbenefits that will be generated by the construction of the HLD Expressway will be (i) an increase \nin the efficiency of the movement of goods and people in the area around HCMC, the provinces \nsurrounding  the  city,  and  along  the  GMS  southern  and  eastern  economic  corridors;  (ii)  a \nreduction  in  transport  costs  in  the  same  area;  and  (iii)  a  reduction  in the  social  and  economic \ncosts of traffic accidents. As transport costs are a key input to economic activities, the indirect \nbenefits of the construction of these expressways will be an increase in economic growth and a \ncontribution to the Government of Viet Nam\u2019s overall poverty reduction program.  \n \n34. \nFor  the  purposes  of  ADB\u2019s  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous \npeoples  policies,  the  Project  has  been  categorized  C,  i.e.,  no  impacts  will  arise  from  activities \nunder the Project. The ensuing investment project has been categorized A for environment and \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  and  B  for  indigenous  peoples.  Under  the  Expressway  Network \nDevelopment Plan TA (footnote 3), ADB is funding a feasibility study for the HLD Expressway \nthat will prepare a full EIA and full resettlement plans, together with appropriate special actions \nfor  ethnic  minorities  to  meet  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  policies.  Services  under  the  Project \ninclude  assistance  in  updating  the  resettlement  plan  to  reflect  detailed  designs,  and \nimplementing  the  resettlement  plan  for  the  HLD  Expressway.  However,  funds  for  all \ncompensation and allowances will be included in the investment loan for the HLD Expressway, \ntogether  with  assurances  on  this  use  of  these  funds.  The  reason  for  proposing  these \narrangements is to allow the implementation of the resettlement plan to commence as early as \npossible and thereby expedite commencement of civil works contracts. \n \nConstruction  of  the  HLD  Expressway  will  require  significant  involuntary  resettlement, \n35. \nincluding  relocation  of  houses  and  loss  of  agricultural  and  homestead  land.  Relocation  of \nhouseholds  will  be  minimized  by  the  careful  threading  of  the  expressway  alignment  through \nurban  areas  and  by  minimizing  the  construction  corridors.  Sufficient  qualified  resettlement \nspecialists  will  be  engaged  to  ensure  adequate  and  timely  planning  and  implementation  of \nresettlement  plans.  Adverse  impacts  will  be  mitigated  through  resettlement  planning  and \nimplementation  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s  decrees  on  resettlement  and  compensation.  The  objective  is  to  improve  or  at \nleast  restore  the  current  living  standards,  income  earning  capacity,  and  production  levels  of \naffected  people.  Special  assistance  programs  will  be  designed  and \nthe \nimplementation  planning  to  help  the  poorest  and  most  vulnerable  people  improve  their \nsocioeconomic status. \n \n36. \nThe  impact  of  the  HLD  Expressway  will  differ  during  the  construction  and  operation \nphases. Activities associated with each of these phases will bring social and economic changes \nthat could result in both positive and negative impacts. During construction of the expressway \nand  once  the  expressway  is  completed,  there  is  potential  risk  of  increased  HIV/AIDS  and \ntrafficking  of  women  and  children.  Appropriate  prevention  and  mitigation  planning  will  be \nincorporated in the project design to address issues related to HIV/AIDS and human trafficking. \n \nInitial investigations suggest that ethnic minorities may live within the HLD Expressway \n37. \nproject  area.  Impacts  on  ethnic  minorities  are  expected  to  be  limited  to  those  arising  from \n\nincluded \n\nin \n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fresettlement  and  land  acquisition,  which  can  be  addressed  through  resettlement  plans.  A \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 10. \n \n38. \nThe main risk to the Project is delayed implementation because of slow finalization of the \nsingle  consulting  services  contract  that  will  be  implemented  under  the  Project.  This  is  being \naddressed  through  advance  contracting  action  for  the  Project\u2019s  consulting  services.  A  further \nrisk  is  VEC\u2019s  limited  capacity  and  experience  of  project  management  for  major  projects.  This \nrisk  is  being  mitigated  through  the  Project\u2019s  component  to  address  regulatory  and  institutional \nstrengthening of VEC. Under this component, a revised organizational structure will be prepared \nfor VEC to address the future needs of VEC as an efficient provider of infrastructure services. \nThis new structure will include a unit to manage environmental and social impacts arising from \nexpressway construction and operation. The component includes a training needs assessment, \na training program, and assistance in recruitment of additional estimates. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  MOT  have  given  the \n\n39. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nResettlement.  For  the  HLD  Expressway,  MOT  will  cause  VEC  to  prepare  an \nupdate  to  the  resettlement  plan  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995),  and  submit  the  updated  resettlement \nplan  to  ADB  for  approval.  This  updated  resettlement  plan  will  take  into  account \nfinal detailed engineering designs and will be disclosed to affect people prior to \nbeing submitted to ADB.  \nIndigenous Peoples and Ethnic Minorities. For the HLD Expressway, MOT will \ncause VEC to undertake surveys to ensure that impacts on ethnic minorities are \nidentified.  If  impacts  are  identified  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples \n(1998)  is  invoked,  then  appropriate  mitigation  measures  are  prepared  in \naccordance with the above policy.  \nSocial Issues. For the HLD Expressway, MOT will ensure that all works contract \ndocuments  to  be  prepared  under  the  Project  will  incorporate  provisions  and \nbudget to the effect that contractors (a) comply with all applicable labor laws and \nrelated international treaty obligations and do not employ child labor, as defined \nunder Vietnamese law; (b) provide safe working conditions for male and female \nworkers;  (c)  implement  the  provisions  set  forth  in  the  project-specific  gender \nStrategy;  and  (d)  carry  out  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  prevention  and \nawareness campaigns in the campsites and corridors of influence.  \nEnvironmental.  For  the  HLD  Expressway,  MOT  will  cause  VEC  to  prepare  an \nEIA that takes into account the detailed engineering design. This EIA will include \nan EMP with adequate public consultation, in accordance with the requirements \nof  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy  (2005)  and  Environment  Policy  (2002), \nand  submit  them  to  ADB  for  approval.  MOT  will  ensure  that  the  civil  works \ncontract  documents  include  specific  measures  as  indicated  in  the  EIA  and  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  to  mitigate  negative  environmental \nimpacts caused by the construction and to give due consideration to prevention \nof damage to the natural environment in the design, construction, operation, and \nmaintenance of the highway facilities. The Government shall ensure that specific \nprovisions  are  included  in  civil  works  and  consulting  services  contracts  for  the \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nimplementation of the EMP and its monitoring, together with budget allowances \nfor these provisions.  \nExpressway  Subsector.  MOT  will  ensure  that,  (a)  revised  regulations  for  VEC \noperations will be submitted to MOT for consideration by 30 November 2009; and \n(b) as part of the revised organizational structure, VEC will establish and suitable \nstaff an Environmental and Social Unit by 30 June 2009. \nImplementation  Arrangements.

Of  17,295  km  of  national  roads,  about  84%  have  sealed \npavements;  of  the  23,137  km  of  provincial  roads,  only  66%  are  sealed.  The  remainder  of  the \nnetwork comprises district, commune, and village roads. National and provincial roads provide \nthe key links in the road network but, in 2004, only 44.8% of the total length of national roads \nwas  reported  as  being  in  good  condition.  The  existing  national  roadway  system  was  mainly \nconstructed with two lanes; only limited lengths near major urban areas were constructed with \nfour lanes. Only 3.9% of the national road network has four lanes whereas 66% has two or three \nlanes.

Many  sites  have  no  bridge,  with  more  than \n115 ferryboats and 1,500 fords.  \n \nThe average speed of vehicles is 50 km per hour (km/h) for trucks and 60 km/h for buses \n3. \nand  cars.  The  complex  traffic  conditions  cause  many  problems  such  as  poor  safety,  limited \nvehicle  speeds,  and  low  capacity.  Motorbikes  have  grown  at  over  20%  per  year,  and  totaled \nover  11  million  in  2003  (140  per  1,000  people).  The  number  of  four-wheel  drive  vehicles  and \narticulated trucks grew slightly faster than gross domestic product (GDP), from 400,000 in 1997 \nto  600,000  in  2002  (7.5  vehicles  per  1,000  population).  Trucks  comprise  30%  of  the  fleet,  but \n80% of them are small to medium size and only 10% are modern articulated trucks.  \n \nB. \n \n4. \nAdministration  of  the  highways  in  Viet  Nam  is  determined  based  on  the  administrative \ncategory of the road. National roads are administered by the central level, provincial roads are \nmanaged by the provincial level, district roads are managed by the district level, urban roads are \nmanaged by cities and towns, and commune roads are managed by the commune level. At the \nnational  level,  responsibility  for  the  road  network  lies  with  the  Viet  Nam  Road  Administration \nunder  the  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT).  However,  in  2004,  Viet  Nam  Expressway  Corporation \n(VEC) was established under MOT to develop expressways. \n \n \n\nRoad Administration \n\n \n\n \nA. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nRoad Safety \n\nC. \n \n4. \nPoor road safety is a serious and growing problem throughout Viet Nam\u201414,161 road \ndeaths  were  reported  in  2006,  which  is  equivalent  to  a  rate  of  about  7  deaths  per  annum  per \n10,000 vehicles. The number of reported deaths increased marginally from 2005. Fatality rates \nfor  Viet  Nam  are  very  high,  even  in  comparison  with  many  neighboring  countries in  southeast \nAsia,  and  new  initiatives  in  road  policy  and  management  are  urgently  required.  Most  road \ndeaths  (60%)  occurred  on  national  highways,  but  the  number  of  accidents  and  deaths  on \nprovincial  roads  is  increasing.  The  major  causes  of  traffic  accidents  are  speeding,  misuse  of \ndrugs,  and  breaking  traffic  regulations.  Additional  factors  causing  the  poor  road  safety  record \nare  the  mix  of  different  vehicle  types  using  individual  roads,  particularly  that  of  high  and  low \nspeed  vehicles  sharing the  same  facility,  and  poor  road  traffic  management.  The  Government \nestablished an interministerial National Traffic Safety Program to address road safety initiatives, \nunder which roles and budget were allocated to each ministry concerned. Under this program, \ncampaigns  are  being  undertaken  to  promote  enforcement  of  traffic  laws,  a  road  traffic  safety, \nand regulation on the sale and use of motorcycles. However, this program has only had limited \neffect  to  date.1 Full  access-controlled  highways  (essentially  expressways)  can  address  some \naspects of the road safety problem as (i) they are targeted at high-speed long-distance traffic, \nso slower local traffic does not have access; and (ii) access is restricted to a limited number of \njunctions, with each junction designed to allow safe entry and exit of traffic. \n \nD. \n \n5. \nVEC  was  established  in  October  2004  under  MOT  as  a  fully  state-owned  enterprise \n(SOE)  to  develop  expressways  in  Viet  Nam.  VEC\u2019s  headquarters  are  located  in  Hanoi  and  a \nsingle branch office is located in Ho Chi Minh City. Management at VEC comprises a general \ndirector and four deputy directors. Operations are divided into five functional divisions and two \nproject  management  units,  and  the  current  organizational  structure  of  VEC  is  shown  in \nFigure A2.  \n \n6. \n\nArticle 4 of VEC\u2019s charter sets out the following areas in which VEC is to operate: \n \n(i) \n\nViet Nam Expressway Corporation \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nin  expressway  construction,  management,  maintenance,  and \n\ninvestment \norganizing toll collection on national expressways; \ninvestment in construction of other transport infrastructure by different modalities; \nprovision  and  operation  of  roadside  facilities  along  expressways,  such  as  rest \nhouses, restaurants, filling stations, advertisement, and provision of construction \nmaterials; \ntransport  engineering  consultancy:  studying  national  expressway  network \ndevelopment,  preparing  pre-feasibility  studies  and \nfeasibility  studies,  and \ndesigning and supervising transport infrastructure construction works; and \ndevelopment of roadside facilities adjacent to expressways. \n\n(v) \n \n7. \nVEC\u2019s charter capital is D1,000 billion (about $62 million). The Ministry of Finance (MOF) \nhas released D50 billion to VEC but the remaining capital has been provided in-kind by granting \nVEC toll collection rights for Cau Gie and Phu Dong toll plazas for 10 years, starting 1 January \n2005.  By  31  December  2005,  VEC\u2019s  total  funds  had  reached  D281.4  billion,  of  which  D152.4 \nbillion  had  been  released  by  MOF\u2014in  addition  to  the  D50  billion  allocation  provided  on  the \nestablishment of VEC, and a further D79 billion from toll collection revenues.    \n                                                 \n1   Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation.  2003.

VEC plans to train staff in the future through \ntechnical courses on financial management and engineering design, making use of courses at \nboth domestic and overseas universities and colleges.  \n \nThe  immediate  objective  for  VEC  was  to  prepare  an  expressway  master  plan,  and  to \n9. \ncomplete  preparations  for  the  construction  of  new  expressways.  VEC  also  has  to  identify  and \nemploy a large number of technically qualified staff to implement its activities.  \n \nUnder  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  Expressway  Network  Development  Plan, 2 a \n10. \nreview was undertaken of the: (i) government policies, laws, regulations, decrees, circulars, and \ncharters relevant to VEC; (ii) current organizational structure of VEC, considering the role and \nresponsibilities of each department and division of VEC, segregation of duty, staffing, etc.; and \n(iii) VEC\u2019s future organizational development plan. This study identified a number of issues that \nmust be addressed, these issues are presented below. \n\n \n1. \n\nOrganizational Structure \n\n \n11. \nVEC was established with an organizational structure intended for the start-up phase. As \nof  January  2007,  VEC  was  implementing  two  construction  projects  and  had  management \nsystems in place for these. However,  present tolling operations are limited to two toll plazas; it \ndoes not have any expressway operating and maintenance contracts in place; it is not providing \nany  additional  support  activities  to  expressways,  such  as  roadside  facilities;  and  processes  to \nenable public-private partnership have not been put in place. Further, VEC has limited capacity \nto  manage  the  social  and  environmental  impacts  of  the  expressways.  To  administer  the \n\n                                                 \n2   ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Expressway Network Development \n\nPlan. Manila (TA 4695-VIE). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nproposed  expressway  program,  VEC  needs  to  expand  its  capacity  to  enable  it  to  manage  a \nnumber of large, complex projects and to expand its capacity to take on new activities in terms \nof additional skills. \n \nVEC  was  established  as  a  fully  owned  SOE  under  MOT.  However,  the  Law  on  State \n12. \nEnterprises, 2003, requires all SOEs to be converted into a company operating under the Law \non Enterprises before 2010. Further, it is expected that VEC will operate as both a regulator and \nowner of the expressway network and as a supplier of various services. These demands require \nrevision  of  the  organizational  structure,  particularly  to  separate  the  roles  of  regulator  and \nsupplier within VEC. With funding from ADB, an Expressway Network Development Plan report3 \nwas  prepared \nthese \nto \nrecommendations need to be refined for implementation. \n\nthat  recommends  revisions \n\nthe  organizational \n\nframework  but \n\n \n2. \n\n \n4. \n\nLegal and Regulatory Framework \n\n \n13. \nThe  Expressway  Network  Development  Plan  TA  undertook  a  review  of  legal  and \nregulatory documents that apply to expressways. This study identified a number of issues that \nneed to be addressed either through clarifications to existing laws or regulations or through new \nlaws  or  regulations.  Of  particular  concern  is  Circular  90,  covering  toll  regimes  for  roads.  As \npresently formulated, this circular is very restrictive in terms of ceilings on toll rates, which may \nhave  consequences  on  the  financial  viability  of  some  expressways.  The  TA  also  made \nrecommended  how  this  circular  could  be  revised  to  accommodate  more  flexible  toll \narrangements. \n \n3. \n\nTraining Needs \n\n \n14. \nGiven that VEC is a new organization, many staff require training to fully engage in their \nroles and responsibilities. The Expressway Network Development Plan TA undertook an initial \nassessment of training needs, but the proposed program needs to be completed once work on \nthe revised organizational structure has been completed. \n\nFinancial and Asset Management Systems \n\nThe Expressway Master Plan \n\n \n15. \nVEC  is  currently  operating  using  standard  accounting  software  to  record  all  financial \ntransactions. However, a financial management system is needed to allow data to be accessed \nand  analyzed  to  meet  needs  other  than  formal  financial  reporting.  The  Expressway  Network \nDevelopment Plan TA also identified a need for an asset management system. \n \nE. \n \nUnder  The  Expressway  Network  Development  Plan  TA,  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n16. \n(ADB) provided funding to assist the Government in preparing an Expressway Master Plan for a \nnational expressway system. The purpose of this plan was to identify a logical national network \nof expressways and to prioritize the construction of each section of the proposed network based \non economic and financial viability.  \n \n17. \nThe  existing  national  road  system  has  been  mainly  constructed  with  two  lanes,  and  a \nsmall part with four lanes. Traffic growth predictions vary across the country, but with short-term \ngrowth  of  7\u201310%  (to  2015),  traffic  volumes  are  set  to  grow  significantly.  Given  that  critical \n\n                                                 \n3   ADB. 2007. Final Report for Expressway Network Development Plan. Manila.

Design  standards  for  expressways \ndiffer  from  normal  roads,  as  they  are  targeted  at  allowing  a  large  number  of  vehicles  to  move \nfreely  between  major  centers,  at  speed,  and  with  a  high  level  of  safety.  The  proposed \nexpressway network will provide high capacity highways that will connect key economic zones, \nlarge  urban  centers,  industrial  zones,  and  international  borders.  The  Expressway  Master  Plan \nproposes  that  the  main  features  of  the  network  be  two  north\u2013south  expressway  axes,  and  six \neast\u2013west expressway axes, together with 14 expressway sections that provide access around \nmajor  centers.  The  short-term  program  (2006\u20132015)  includes  21  priority  expressway  projects \ncovering  1,968  km,  with  an  estimated  construction  cost  of  $11.556  billion.4 A  medium-term \nprogram (2016\u20132025) was proposed that included another eight projects covering an additional \n875 km, with an estimated construction cost of $5.238 billion.

The three priority projects selected are: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nNinh Binh\u2013Thanh Hoa, \nHo Chi Minh City\u2013Long Thanh\u2013Dau Giay, and \nBien Hoa to Ba Ria (Vung Tau). \n\n \nThe  three  proposed  projects  have  been  subjected  to  simplified  economic  and  financial \n2. \nanalysis  to  ascertain  their  viability.  The  data  and  forecast  underpinning  the  analysis  were \ncollated  to  develop  a  prioritized  national  Expressway  Master  Plan. 1  As  a  result,  the  data \navailable are comprehensive in scope but less detailed than required to perform full economic \nand financial analysis at project level. The analysis should therefore be considered preliminary \nand its results indicative. \n\n \n1. \n\nNinh Binh\u2013Thanh Hoa \n\n \n3. \nThe proposed expressway between Ninh Binh and Thanh Hoa is to take the role of the \nexisting  highway  no.  1  serving  long-distance  traffic  between  the  north  and  south  of  Viet  Nam. \nThe  proposed  project  is  the  next  stage  in  developing  the  expressway  between  Hanoi  and \nHo Chi  Minh  City  (HCMC).  The  section  from  Hanoi  to  Cau  Gie  is  completed,  and  the  section \nfrom Cau Gie to Ninh Binh is under construction. \n \n4. \nThe project will construct 63 kilometers (km) of four-lane dual carriageway expressway \nbetween  2009  and  2012.  It  includes  (i)  two  large  river  crossings\u2014of  the  Do Len  River  (bridge \nlength  about  500\u2013800  meters  [m])  and  the  Ma  River  (bridge  length  about  1,500  m);  (ii)  seven \ngrade separated interchanges; (iii) and three toll plazas. On the basis of traffic counts made in \nthe  autumn  of  2006  in Ninh  Binh  and  Bim  Son,  if  the  expressway  existed  now,  it  is  estimated \nthat  it  would  carry  9,783  passenger car  units  (pcu)/day,2 rising  to  13,167  pcu/day  in  2010  and \n27,426  pcu/day \nis  estimated  at  $359.70  million \n(D6,395 billion). \n \n2. \n\nHo Chi Minh City\u2013Long Thanh\u2013Dau Giay \n\nin  2025.  The  cost  of  construction \n\n \n5. \nThe proposed project forms the southern end of the north\u2013south expressway from Hanoi \nto HCMC, and connects to the planned urban expressway network around HCMC. It intersects \nwith the proposed Bien Hoa\u2013Ban Ria expressway (see paragraph 7 below) which will form part \nof a bypass around HCMC. The project will provide the primary road connection from HCMC to \nthe planned new airport in Long Thanh. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2007. Final Report for: Expressway Network Development Plan Project: The Expressway Development Plan, \n\n\u2013 Volume 3. Manila. (TA4695-VIE) \n\n2  This is a normalized measure of traffic where different types of traffic (buses, trucks etc.) are converted into pcu by \nmultiplying the number of vehicles by a factor reflecting the equivalent traffic load of one vehicle expressed in terms \nof passenger cars. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n21 \n\nThe  project  will  construct  57  km  of  four-lane  dual  carriageway  expressway  between \n6. \n2009 and 2012. It includes (i) a bridge across the Dong Nai River (about 1,721 m long); (ii) eight \ngrade  separated  intersections;  and  (iii)  three  toll  plazas.  Based  on  updated  origin-destination \ndata from the VITRANSS study,3 the technical assistance (TA) consultant estimates that, if the \nexpressway existed today, traffic on the first 25 km from HCMC to Long Thanh would be 20,063 \npcu/day,  rising  to  112,633  pcu/day  in  2030.  On  the  remaining  30  km,  estimated  traffic  today \nwould  be  14,429  pcu/day,  rising  to  81,129  pcu/day  in  2030.  The  cost  of  construction  is \nestimated at $780.0 million (D12,489 billion). \n\n \n3. \n\nBien Hoa\u2013Ba Ria  \n\nCost Benefit Analysis \n\n \n7. \nThe proposed project would take the role  of the existing highway no. 51 between Bien \nHoa  and  Ba  Ria.  The  alignment  starts  from  Bien  Hoa,  crosses  the  alignment  of  the  proposed \nHCMC\u2013Long  Thanh\u2013Dau  Giay  expressway  near  Long  Thanh,  and  connects  to  the  proposed \nBen Luc\u2013Nhon Trach\u2013Long Thanh expressway. Vung Tau has a major seaport, an airport, and \nsome tourist industry. The Nha Be river serves as an inland waterway along the same distance \nas the expressway, and further to the northwest. \n \n8. \nThe  project  would  construct  58  km  of  four-lane  dual  carriageway  expressway  between \n2011  and  2014.  It  includes  (i)  several  bridges  with  a  total  length  of  8,212  m;  (ii)  six  grade \nseparated interchanges; and (iii) 11 toll plazas. Based on VITRANSS data and the consultants\u2019 \nown traffic counts on national highway no. 51, estimated traffic volume if the expressway existed \ntoday would be 13,184 pcu/day, rising to 17,957 pcu/day in 2010 and 32,531 pcu/day in 2030. \nThe cost of construction is estimated at $318.58 million (D5,097 billion). \n \nB. \n \n9. \nThe  cost-benefit  analysis  estimates  the  incremental  costs  and  benefits  for  each  of  the \nthree  projects  by  comparing  with-  and  without-project  scenarios.  It  considers  the  cost  of \nconstructing and maintaining the expressways, and all resettlement and land acquisition costs; \nand  the  benefits  enjoyed  by  road  users,  encompassing  reduced  vehicle  operating  cost  (VOC) \nand time savings. \n \n10. \nThe analysis was performed using Highway Design and Maintenance (version 4) and is \nbased  on  costs  and  benefits  estimated  using  economic  (border)  prices.  For  road  works,  the \neconomic  costs  are  estimated  at  85%  of  financial  cost.  The  maintenance  costs  used  in  the \neconomic appraisals were $1,250 per km for routine maintenance and $1.36 per square meter \n(m2) per year for periodic maintenance. However, since periodic maintenance is only carried out \nevery 7 years, the annual operation costs have been converted to $9.72 per m2 once every 7 \nyears.  Benefits  have  been  estimated  using  economic  VOC,  and  include  time  savings  benefits \nfor passengers and cargo. Benefits and maintenance costs are estimated over a 20-year benefit \nperiod after completion of construction. \n \n11. \nThe  results  of  the  analysis  are  expressed  in  terms  of  the  proposed  projects\u2019  economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) and economic net present value (NPV). Pertinent assumptions are \ntested  through  sensitivity  analysis.  The  distributional  impact  of  the  proposed  projects  has  not \nbeen analyzed. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n3   Japan International Cooperation Agency. 2005.

The results of the analysis are as follows: \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\ntravel \n\ntime  savings \n\nNinh Binh\u2013Thanh Hoa: the EIRR was calculated to be 27.4% and the NPV to be \n$576.2  million.  The  discounted  benefits  are  divided  between  savings  in  VOC  of \nfor  passengers  and  cargo  of \n$520.1  million  and \n$366.0 million.  \nHCMC\u2013Long Thanh\u2013Dau Giay: the EIRR was calculated to be 29% and the NPV \nwas $476 million. The discounted benefits are divided between savings in VOC \nof $511 million and travel time savings for passengers and cargo of $295 million.  \nBien  Hoa\u2013Ba  Ria:  The  EIRR  was  calculated  to  be  20.2%  and  the  NPV  was \n$291.4  million.  The  discounted  benefits  are  divided  between  savings  in  VOC  of \n$312.3  million  and \nfor  passengers  and  cargo  of \n$261.4 million. \n\ntime  savings \n\ntravel \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\n \nD. \n \nThe Project\u2019s sensitivity to risks and changes in assumptions (Table A3.1) was tested by \n13. \nmodifying the following key variables that have particular impact on the outcome of the analysis: \n(i) 20%  increase  in  construction  costs,  and  (ii) 20%  decrease  in  traffic.  The  combined  impact \nwas also tested. In all cases, the EIRR is well above the cutoff value of 12%. Switching values \nwere  not  calculated  and  risk  analysis  was  not  performed.  However,  given  the  outcome  of  the \nsensitivity  analysis,  it  appears  unlikely  that  any  of  the  projects  would  fall  below  the  economic \nviability cutoff rate except under catastrophic circumstances. \n\n \nTable A3.1: Sensitivity Analysis \n(EIRR) \n \n\nParameter \n\nChange \n\nBase case \nIncrease in \ninvestment cost \nReduction in traffic \nCombined \n\n \n+20% \n\n\u201320% \n \n\nNinh Binh\u2013\nThanh Hoa \n\n27.4% \n24.1% \n\n25.6% \n22.5% \n\nHo Chi Minh \nCity\u2013\nLong Thanh \n29.4% \n25.3% \n\n24.4% \n20.7% \n\nLong Thanh\u2013\nDau Giay \n\nBien Hoa\u2013\nBa Ria \n\n21.8% \n20.9% \n\n21.2% \n20.3% \n\n20.2% \n18.1% \n\n16.7% \n15.0% \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\nSimilar  to  the  approach taken  in  the  economic  analysis,  incremental  revenue  forecasts \n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return. \nSource: Final report for Expressway Network Development Plan (footnote 1). \n \nE. \n \n14. \n(in financial terms) are based on traffic forecasts with and without the proposed projects.  \n \n15. \nThe projects are expected to be funded with 10% equity from the Government, and the \nassumed opportunity cost of such equity financing is 9%.

The proportion of the population below \nthe poverty line has declined from around 59% in 1993 to 25% in 2005. The proposed target for the Five-Year Socio-\nEconomic  Development  Plan  (2006\u20132010)  is  to  reduce  poor  households  to  15\u201316%  by  2010.  While  significant  in \nterms of magnitude, progress in poverty reduction remains fragile, with a significant number of \u201cnear poor\u201d clustered \njust above the poverty line. Sustained development requires modernization and improvement of physical infrastructure \nand associated services.  \n \nExpressways  are  intended  to  serve  long  distance  traffic.  They  do  not  necessarily  benefit  local  communities  directly, \nbut  address  poverty  in  areas  around  the  expressway  indirectly  by  facilitating  continued  economic  growth.  The \nproposed Ho Chi Minh City\u2013Long Thanh\u2013Dau Giay (HLD) Expressway is located in Ho Chi Minh City and Dong Nai \nProvince, one of the least poor provinces with a poverty rate of 10.33%1. Given the generally low rates of poverty in \nthe  project  area,  the  proposed  Project  will  have  very  limited  impact  on  poverty  reduction  in  the  project  locations. \nHowever,  improved  transport  infrastructure  is  critical  for  sustained  rapid  economic  growth  and  overall  poverty \nreduction,  and  can  contribute  to  regionally  balanced  and  equitable  economic  growth  by  stimulating  agriculture \nproduction,  increasing  access  to  employment  opportunities,  and  facilitating  better  access  to  social  services. \nRemoteness  and  disconnection  have  often  been  identified  as  factors  for  poor  people\u2019s  inability  to  benefit  from \neconomic growth. Improved road connectivity under the proposed Project might contribute to poor people\u2019s ability to \nbenefit from economic growth in the long run.  \n \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nFollowing the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Enhanced Poverty Reduction Strategy (December 2004), projects classified \nas general intervention no longer require project level poverty assessments. However, for the HLD Expressway, the \nongoing  project  preparatory  technical  assistance2 (PPTA)  includes  a  poverty  impact  analysis  that  will  examine  the \nextent  to  which  there  is  any  opportunity  for  pro-poor  design.  As  part  of  the  project  preparation  for  the  HLD \nExpressway,  social  assessments  will  be  prepared  for  project  provinces  and  districts,  and  areas  affected  by \nresettlement. Since HIV/AIDS and human trafficking represent significant risks, assessment on HIV/AIDS and human \ntrafficking will be conducted to prepare preventive measures for implementation during the construction phase of the \nexpressway. \n \nThe social assessment data will include: (i) a demographic, social (education, occupation, etc.), and economic profile \nof  the  population  of  the  project  provinces  and  districts  (urban,  semi-urban  and  rural)  disaggregated  by  ethnicity  and \ngender; (ii) available social services and access to other services; (iii) access to markets and movement of goods to \nother  provinces;  (iv)  the  potential  impact  of  the  proposed  expressways  on  the  social  environment  of  urban,  semi-\nurban,  and  rural  areas;  (v)  potential  employment  opportunities  in  the  project  area;  (vi)  reduction  of  transport  costs \nassociated  with  transportation  on  the  provincial  road  networks;  (v)  potential  change  in  agriculture  production,  and \nmanufacturing of goods in semi-urban areas and rural areas and its potential impact on women; (vi) potential change \nin land and property value; (vii) commercial development in the provinces and its impact on local resident, especially \nmiddle-income, low-income, and poor people. \n \nSince  the  HLD  Expressway  runs  through  some  densely  populated  areas  and  is  near  several  industrial  zones,  the \nsocial  assessment  will  also  focus  on  environmental  issues  and  possible  negative  impacts  arising  from  construction-\nrelated  air  pollution\u2014caused  by  rock  crushing,  cutting  and  filling  works,  asphalt  processing,  disposal  of  waste,  and \nnoise\u2014on the living conditions of people in the project area. The expressway alignment runs through mixed areas of \nurban settlements, farmland,  and rubber plantations. This could result in the fragmentation of farmland, settlements, \n\n                                                 \n1 Ministry of Labor and Invalids. 2002.

The social impact of the fragmentation of farmland, urban settlements, rubber plantations, and \nother  facilities  on  people\u2019s  daily  life  and  livelihood  will  be  examined.  Consultation  will  be  held  with  affected \ncommunities  regarding  the  location  of  community  infrastructure  such  as  underpasses,  bridges,  access  road,  etc. \nBased  on  the  social  assessment,  strategies  will  be  developed  to  address  the  social  impact  in  the  designs  of  the \nexpressway    \n \nSocial analysis will include the potential negative impact of resettlement on affected people, and risks of the spread of \nHIV/AIDS. Assessment of HIV/AIDS will include: (i) the current HIV/AIDS prevalence in the project area; (ii) the type \nand  level  of  vulnerability  to  HIV/AIDS  of  the  population  along  the  proposed  expressway  (disaggregated  by  gender, \nethnicity, age, type of occupation, mobility, etc.); (iii) review of provincial plans and activities on HIV/AIDS and human \ntrafficking;  (iv)  review  of  existing  programs  of  donors  and  nongovernment  organizations;  (vi)  recommendations  for \nactivities  related  to  provincial  plans  and  relevant  linkages  with  other  donors\u2019  programs  for  preventing  and  mitigating \nthe  impacts;  and  (vii)  assessment  of  the  capacity  building  training  needs  of  relevant  agencies  for  anti-HIV/AIDS \nactivities and the prevention of human trafficking program.  \n \nThe  social  analysis  will  be  prepared  from  both  primary  and  secondary  data.  Primary  data  will  be  collected  from \nselected project areas through sample survey and focus group discussions. Secondary data will include existing data \nsuch as census, national socioeconomic surveys, and available HIV/AIDS and human trafficking related data. \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\n \n\n \n\n   No \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\n   Yes               \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nUnder  the  Expressway  Network  Development  Plan  (footnote  2),  workshops  were  held  with  government  agencies  to \nprepare  the  Expressway  Master  Plan.  For  the  social  impact  analysis  (Box  B),  land  acquisition,  and  resettlement \nissues,  individual  and  group  consultations  will  be  undertaken  with  affected  people  at  the  urban  settlements,  semi-\nurban,  and  rubber  plantation  areas.  The  stakeholder  analysis  will  also  include  consultation  with  relevant  agencies \nworking on human trafficking and HIV/AIDS prevention programs.   \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \nBased  on  the  stakeholder  analysis,  a  participatory  strategy  will  be  incorporated  in  the  location  and  design  of \nunderpasses and footbridges for local communities and for the planning and implementation of resettlement activities.  \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe social analysis will include surveys to determine the situation of women in the project areas, including their work in \nthe  formal  and  informal  sector  (work  on  rubber  plantations  and  agriculture,  etc.).  The  social  impact  assessment  will \ninclude  information  on:  (i)  the  extent  to  which  land  acquisition  and  relocation  will  affect  women\u2019s  social  condition, \neconomic  activities,  access  to  farmland,  rubber  plantation,  etc;  (ii)  women\u2019s  access  to  social  services  and  other \nfacilities; and (iii) potential risk of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking. The socioeconomic data and HIV/AIDS and human \ntrafficking data will be disaggregated by gender and ethnic groups. A project-specific gender strategy will be prepared \nand gender-related strategies will be incorporated in the project activities, including resettlement plans. \n \nThe gender strategy  will include specific activities to ensure that project benefits will accrue to  women. The strategy \nwill  ensure  that:  (i)  women  do  not  become  more  vulnerable  because  of  relocation;  (ii)  women  are  involved  in  the \nconsultation  process  for  preparation  of  losses  of  inventory,  and  the  grievance  process  on  resettlement  and \ncompensation issues; (iii) women retain access to land or land title during resettlement; (iv) women are consulted in \nidentifying locations of community infrastructure (such as underpasses, bridges, access road, etc.); (v) potential social \nproblems arising from the projects will be addressed; and (vi) women participate fully in programs related to HIV/AIDS \nprevention and human trafficking. A relevant capacity building training program will be developed for men and women \nofficials  of  the  Executing  Agency;  leaders  of  the  communes;  and  provincial,  district,  and  commune  level  Women\u2019s \nUnions,  to  ensure  effective  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan  and  HIV/AIDS  awareness  and  prevention  of \nhuman  trafficking,  and  monitoring  of  project  activities.  Community  level  monitoring  and  consultation  for  land \nacquisition, compensation price, and relocation and implementation of the resettlement plan will include mechanisms \nfor  community  involvement  and  participation,  as  outlined  in  the  government  decrees  on  regulation  for  participatory \ninvestment supervision, and grassroots democracy.  \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nE.

No trafficked person or \nchild \nfor  construction  and \nmaintenance. \nThe HLD Expressway will run through mainly urban and \nsemi-urban  areas.  A  preliminary  assessment  of  the \nproject  areas  indicates  that  ethnic  groups  might  be \npresent in the urban and semi-urban areas. Surveys will \nbe  undertaken  to  determine  the  presence  of  ethnic \nminorities  within  the  project  areas  and,  if  confirmed, \ntheir  socioeconomic  condition.  If  found  necessary, \neither  an  ethnic  minority  development  plan  or  special \nactions will be prepared to meet the requirements of the \nAsian  Development  Bank\u2019s  Policy  on \nIndigenous \nPeoples (1998). \n \n\nthe \n\ntransmitted \n\nto  sexually \n\nThe HLD expressway could become a new pathway for \ndiseases. Mobile groups (such as drivers and guides of \ntour  buses,  truck  drivers,  and  workers)  are  particularly \nvulnerable \ninfections  and \nHIV/AIDS.  During \nconstruction  and  post-\nconstruction  phases,  risks  of  HIV/AIDS  and  human \ntrafficking  can  increase  around  the  construction  camps \nand  in  the  project  areas.  A  HIV/AIDS  awareness  and \nhuman trafficking program will be included in the project \ndesign. During and after construction of the highway, a \nroad  safety  education  campaign  will  be  required  for \nlocal people to avoid traffic accidents.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Full \n\n Short \n\n None \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n \nBased on the \nsocial \nassessment, \nan appropriate \nplan or \nactivities will be \nincluded in the \nProject \n \n \n\n \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n \nA HIV/AIDS \nand prevention \nof human  \ntrafficking \nprogram will be \nincluded in the \nproject designs \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 1 November 2007) \n", "Currency Unit\n", "dong (D) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "D1.00\n$1.00\n", "$0.0001 \nD16,081 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAsian Development Fund \nexecuting agency \nenvironmental impact assessment \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental management plan \nfinancial internal rate of return \ngross domestic product \nGreater Mekong Subregion \nHo Chi Minh City \nHo Chi Minh City\u2013Long Thang\u2013Dau Giay \nimplementing agency \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation \nJapan International Cooperation Agency \nsquare meter \nMinistry of Finance \nMinistry of Transport \nnet present value \noperation and maintenance \npassenger car unit \nproject preparatory technical assistance \nnational highway \nspecial drawing rights \nSocio-Economic Development Plan \nstate-owned enterprise \ntechnical assistance \nVietnam Expressway Corporation \nvehicle operating cost \nweighted average cost of capital \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "NOTE \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", "ADB \nADF \nEA \nEIA \nEIRR \nEMP \nFIRR \nGDP \nGMS \nHCMC \nHLD \nIA \nJBIC \nJICA \nm2 \nMOF \nMOT \nNPV \nO&M \npcu \nPPTA \nQL \nSDR \nSEDP \nSOE \nTA \nVEC \nVOC \nWACC \n", "Vice President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n \n \n", "C.
