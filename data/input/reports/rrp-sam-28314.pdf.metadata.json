Outputs \ninclude (i) improved floodways (2,850 meters [m]); (ii) rehabilitated \nexisting  drains  (2,425  m);  (iii)  installation  of  water  gauges  to  for \nflood  monitoring  and  establish  survey  levels  to  support  future \nmaster  planning  and  drainage  design;  (iv)  design,  construction, \nand operation of a wastewater collection and treatment system for \nthe central business area (CBA) (a treatment plant with a capacity \nof  950  cubic  meters/day,  and  approximately  5  kilometers  of \nsewers); (v) upgrading of individual sanitation facilities in low-lying \nareas,  particularly  southwest  of  the  CBA,  and  utility-managed \nindividual  sanitation  systems,  specifically  a  regular  pump-out \nprogram  for  septic  tanks  and  cesspools;  and  (vi)  strengthened \nfor  wastewater \ninstitutions \nmanagement,  drainage,  urban  management,  and  environmental \nmonitoring. \n \nApia  is  the  capital  of  Samoa  and  its  population  and  economic \ncenter.  It  has  approximately  37%  of  the  population  of  164,217 \n(based  on  the  1999  census),  or  60,000  people.  Apia,  particularly \nits  center,  shows  typical  signs  of  inadequate  planning  and \ninfrastructure  provision  for  environmental  protection  associated \nwith  urban  areas.  Nearshore  marine  water  and  urban  stream \nwater quality in Apia has been significantly degraded as a result of \ninadequate  sanitation  and  wastewater  management  systems. \nMost  wastewater  is  now  treated  in  individual  systems  such  as \ncesspools  and  septic  systems  before  being  discharged  into \ndrainage  channels  (including  open  channels  and  streams),  soil, \nand groundwater. Flooding is frequent due to high rainfall and an \ninadequate  drainage  system  that  is  compounded  by  land  filling, \nblocking  of  drains,  and  historical  lack  of  town  planning.  Flooding \nafter  heavy  rain  is  intensified,  and  foul  water  flooding  poses  a \npublic  health  risk  due  to  septage  and  latrine  wastes  being \nreleased  to  the  ground  surface  environment.  Businesses  have \nsuffered  substantially  financial  losses  from  the  frequent  flooding, \nhampering  the  overall  economic  growth  of  the  country.  The \ngrowing  urban  population  density,  poor  soil  conditions,  and  high \ngroundwater, together with flooding potential, mean that individual \nsystems in the denser urban areas can no longer effectively treat \nwastewater.  A \nlarge  reticulated  wastewater  collection  and \ntreatment system covering all the urban area or even a large part \n\n\fii \n\n \n\ntreatment system covering all the urban area or even a large part \nof  it  are  not  affordable  for  the  Government  or  the  consumers. \nLimited  institutional  and  technical  capacity  also  hinder  the \npotential to operate and maintain such a system at this time. The \nSamoa  Water  Authority  (SWA)  reasonably  and  effectively \nprovides  water  services  to  Apia  and  rural  areas  of  the  country. \nSWA has not provided wastewater or sanitation services and has \nno  specific  capabilities  to  do  so  in  this  area.  SWA\u2019s  skills  and \ncapacities  need  to  be  upgraded  to  cover  wastewater  and \nsanitation  services.  The  Government  recognizes  the  urgent  need \nto  urgently  address  the  wastewater  management,  including \nsanitation  issue  together  with  the  integrally  related  and  drainage \nproblems.  The  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  this  and  other \nplanning  and  urban  management  issues  is  reflected  in  its \nPlanning  and  Urban  Management  Strategy  and  the  creation  in \n2002 of a Planning and Urban Management Agency (PUMA). \n \nThe overall objective  of the Project is to improve the environment \nand  public  health  of  Apia  through  assistance  in  improving  urban \ninfrastructure  for  drainage  and  sanitation  as  well  as  improving \nurban  management  capacity.  The  Project  objectives  include \nimproved  public  health,  environmental  quality,  and  surface  and \ngroundwater quality; and reduced frequency of flooding in specific \nlow-lying areas of Apia. The Project also promotes private sector \nparticipation  in  provision  of  urban  services  by  outsourcing  a \nnumber  of  utility  services  to  the  private  sector,  and  advances \nprivate  sector  development  by  providing  improved  infrastructure \nand business environment.  \n \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $10  million,  including  a \nforeign exchange cost of $3.8 million (about 38% of the total) and \na local cost of $6.2 million (about 62% of the total cost).  \n \n\nSources \n\nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment  \n \n\nTotal  \n\n \n \n\n$ million equivalent \nForeign \nExchange \n \n3.8 \n0.0 \n3.8 \n\n \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n \n4.2 \n2.0 \n6.2 \n\nTotal \nCost \n \n8.0 \n2.0 \n10.0 \n\nObjective \n\nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  The  loan  will  be  SDR  5,604,000  ($8  million  equivalent)  from  the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) Asian Development Fund (ADF). \nThe  loan  will  have  a  32-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  8 \nyears.  The  interest  rate  charged  will  be  1.0%  during  the  grace \nperiod and 1.5% thereafter.  \n \nThe  Government  will  re-lend  a  portion  of  tala-denominated  loan \nproceeds  allocated  with  foreign  exchange  risk  borne  by  the \nGovernment for the wastewater and sanitation component to SWA \nat a 32-year term, 5-year grace period, and interest charged at 5% \nper annum. \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n\fPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \n\niii \n\nMarch 2004 to June 2009 \n \n31 December 2008 \n\n \nMinistry of Finance \n \nA project steering committee has been constituted, chaired by the \nchief  executive  officer  (CEO)  MOF  and  co-chaired  by  the \nmanaging  director  of  SWA  and  CEOs  of  Ministry  of  Works, \nTransport, and Infrastructure (MWTI) and Ministry of Environment \nand  Natural  Resources.  Other  steering  committee  members \ninclude  the  CEOs  of  Ministry  of  Agriculture  (MOA),  Ministry  of \nHealth  (MOH),  Ministry  of  Women,  Community  and  Social \nDevelopment;  and  the  general  manager  of  the  Electric  Power \nCorporation. \n \nThe  Project  will  have  two  implementing  agencies:  (i)  Ministry  of \nWorks,  Transport,  and  Infrastructure  (MWTI)  for  the  drainage \ncomponent;  and  (ii)  SWA  for  the  wastewater  management  and \nsanitation and capacity building component.  \n \nADB-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Major  contracts  for  civil \nworks costing over $1 million, and equipment purchases valued at \n$500,000 or more will be undertaken through ADB\u2019s international \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  (ICB),  and  equipment  packages \nvalued  at  less  than  $500,000  will  be  procured  following  ADB\u2019s \nprocedures  for  international  shopping.  Civil  works  estimated  to \ncost $1 million or less per package will be carried out under local \ncompetitive  bidding  (LCB)  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  in \naccordance  with  government  procurement  laws  and  regulations. \nFor  LCB  packages,  local  contractors  have  the  expertise  and \ncapacity  to  undertake  such  works,  which  will  be  determined \nthrough a prequalification exercise.  \n \nThe  loan  will  fund  recruitment  of  a  firm  to  provide  48  person-\nmonths  of  international  and  65  person-months  of  domestic \nconsulting services to help the Government and SWA implement \nthe  Project  and  provide  capacity  building.  Project  management \nunit will be staffed with a Project Manager and administrative and \naccounting services funded by the loan. \n \nSWA will also use loan funds to finance a twinning or partnership \narrangement with another regional wastewater utility, which will be \nseparately retained. \n \nThe  recruitment  of  consultant  services  for  the  capacity  building \nand  Project  implementation  and  twinning  arrangement,  will  be \nundertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants,  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based selection method, \nand  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nfrom \n\nto  Apia\u2019s  60,000 \n\nand  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement \nof  domestic  consultants.  The  PMU  Project  Manager  will  be \nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants,  as  an  individual  consultant  with  an  allowance  for \naccounting and administrative services. \n \nThe  Project  will  improve  environmental  conditions, reduce health \nrisks,  and  greater  amenities \nresidents, \napproximately 2,000 working population, and 50,000 visitors. The \nProject  will  directly  benefit  residents  by  providing  sanitation \nservices. A proportion of the 1,750 residents of low-lying areas will \nbenefit from rehabilitation of their household sanitation facilities to \na minimum standard. Businesses, government departments, and \nother organizations located in CBA will benefit from connection to \nthe central reticulated sewerage  system. The upgraded sanitation \nservices  for  the  National  Hospital  will  benefit  the  10,000  in-\npatients  and  50,000  outpatients  annually,  hospital  and \nDepartment of Health staff (approximately 130), and the adjacent \nvillage  community.  The  Malifa  compound  population  of \napproximately 2,200 students, staff, and Department of Education \nimproved  sanitation.  Residents  and \nstaff  will  benefit \nbusinesses  will  benefit  from  improved  drainage.  These  benefits \ninclude less disruption to roadways and footpaths during and after \nrainfall,  less  water  damage  to  roadways  and  footpaths,  and  litter \nentering Apia harbor and neighboring mangrove areas. \n  \nIndirect  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  include  the  fisheries  industry \nthrough improved marine environment resources from reduction in \nseawater  pollution,  and  the  tourism  industry  through  improved \nurban and marine environments. \n \nStaff  of  PUMA,  MWTI,  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  and  Ministry  of \nHealth  will  upgrade  their  skills  and  capabilities  through  training. \nSWA  staff  will  benefit  from  a  twinning  arrangement  with  an \nexperienced  wastewater  utility.  The  Government  will  benefit  from \nimproved  environmental  and  health  outcomes,  and  reductions  in \nhealth expenditure in relation to water-related diseases. \n \nProject  risks  center  on  (i)  continued  government  commitment  to \nimprove urban management, (ii) business community participation \nin  the  sewerage  connection  program,  and  (iii)  effectiveness  and \nsustainability  of  capacity-building  measures.  Government \ncommitment has been demonstrated through the establishment of \nPUMA, promulgation of the Planning and Urban Management Bill, \nand  efforts  to  develop  this  Project.  Business  community  support \nand  participation  were  fostered  through  dialogue  during  project \ndevelopment,  and  continue  to  be  fostered  through  pre-loan \ndialogue  on \ntariff  needs  and  private  sector  participation \nwastewater  service  provision.  To  make  capacity  building \nmeasures  more  effective  and  sustainable,  the  capacity  building \nconsultancy  emphasize  a  high  level  of  interaction  with  the \nGovernment and SWA staff during the Project. The establishment \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n\fTechnical Assistance \n\n \n\nv\n\nto \n\nlimited \n\nto \nresponsiveness \n\nGovernment and SWA staff during the Project. The establishment \nand  funding  of  a  twinning  arrangement  for  SWA  and  a  well-\nestablished  and  effective  utility  will  promote  long-term  capacity \nbuilding.  There  is  some  risk  of  inadequate  cost  recovery  from \ntariffs resulting in greater-than-anticipated government subsidy of \nwastewater  management  operations.  However,  the  Government \nand SWA have demonstrated their commitment to improved cost \nrecovery  through  recent  water  tariff  increases,  enactment  of  a \nPublic Bodies (Performance and Accountability) Act that promotes \nsustainable  commercial  operations  for  public  enterprises,  and  its \ndeliberate  review  of  cost  recovery  issues  associated  with  this \nProject.  Also,  based  on  project  estimates  and  consultations, \nestimated tariffs. Government has provided strong assurances on \ntariff  systems  and  levels  as  well  as  support  of  SWA  when  it \nprovides necessary community services that are not commercially \nviable  (community  service  obligations).  The  Project  emphasizes \nbuilding  community  and  other  stakeholder  awareness  and \nthe  Project,  and  encouraging  SWA  and \ncommitment \ngovernment \nto  community  needs.  Land \nacquisition  risks,  which  only  affect  portions  of  the  drainage \nland  acquisition \ncomponent,  are  minimal  due \nrequirements.  \n \nAttached  to  the  Project  is  a  concurrent  technical  assistance  (TA) \nfor  institutional  strengthening  of  infrastructure  planning  for  the \nProject,  and  long-term  planning  for  drainage  and  wastewater \nmanagement. The TA Executing Agency (EA) will be the Treasury \nDepartment,  and  the  implementing  agency,  PUMA.  The  TA  has \ntwo  components:  (i)  drainage  and  wastewater  management \nplanning  and  (ii)  urban  planning  and  regulation.  Long-term \ndrainage and wastewater management plans for greater Apia, and \nenabling \nlegislation  will  be  developed.  The  planning  and \nregulation component focuses on institutionalizing the new PUMA \nlegislation with key affected stakeholders, including PUMA, MWTI, \nand  SWA,  and  strengthening  them,  primarily  PUMA.  It  will \nfacilitate  new  planning  assessment  processes  and  procedures \nand implementation of a land planning and geographic information \nsystem  (GIS)  for  PUMA.  The  TA  will  also  help  PUMA  develop  a \nstrategy  for  community  awareness  of  wastewater  and  drainage \nissues. \n \nThe TA involves 11 person-months of international and 13 person-\nmonths  of  domestic  consultants,  to  be  recruited  in  accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  using  the \nquality- and cost-based selection method and simplified technical \nproposal,  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the \nengagement of domestic consultants.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is \nestimated  at  $475,000,  with  $400,000  financed  by  the  Japan \nSpecial  Fund.  Expertise  areas  to  be  recruited  under  the  TA \ninclude \nplanning, \nenvironmental law, GIS, and community development awareness. \n\ncivil/environmental \n\nengineering, \n\nurban \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Independent  State  of  Samoa  for  the  Sanitation  and  Drainage  Project.  The  report  also \ndescribes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Capacity Building for Drainage and Sanitation, \nand if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by \nthe Board, will approve the TA. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n2. \nSamoa  is  a  small  archipelago  consisting  of  two  main  islands\u2014Upolu  and  Savai\u2019i\u2014and \nfive  smaller  islands,  with  a  total  area  of  2,820  square  kilometers.  In  2001  the  population1 was \n176,848,  with  natural  increase  in  the  order  of  1%  per  annum.  However,  with  significant \nemigration,  net  population  growth  is  estimated  at  0.5%  as  it  has  been  for  the  last  30  years. \nSome 98% of the population lives on the coastal plains in small villages, including in and around \nurban Apia, the capital, on Upolu. Approximately 60,872 people or 34.4% of the population lived \nin Apia while 52% lived in northwest Upolu, including Apia and the undulating foothills stretching \n30  kilometers  (km)  to  the  northwest.  Much  of  development  is  between  these  foothills  and  the \ncoastline. \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n3. \nSamoa  has  made  great  progress  over  the  past  two  decades  in  economic  and  social \ndevelopment.  The  Strategy  for  the  Development  of  Samoa  2002\u201320042  continues  the \nGovernment\u2019s  emphasis  on  macroeconomic  stability;  public  sector  efficiency  and  reform; \nimproved  education  and  health  standards;  better  urban  planning  and  management,  including \nprovision of infrastructure; and a strong private sector.  \n \n4. \nSamoa\u2019s  stable  political  environment,  combined  with  vigorous  economic  growth  and \ninclusive  social  development  strategies,  has  contributed  towards  Samoa  achieving  its \ndevelopment  goals.  With  a  Human  Development  Index  of  0.59.  Samoa  rates  well  on  the \nachievement of social development goals. Adult literacy rates for both genders (96%) and gross \nenrolment  rates  in  primary  (94%)  and  secondary  (70%)  levels  are  high  by  Pacific  developing \nmember  country  standards.  Infant  mortality  (22  per  1,000  births),  under-5  mortality  (35  per \n1,000 births), and maternal mortality (4 per 100,000 births) rate amongst the three lowest in the \nPacific  region.  Some  90%  of  the  population  has  access  to  potable  water.  Concern  for  the \nenvironment is strong. New legislation, Planning and Urban Management BiIl (PUMA Bill) deals \nwith  the  biophysical,  social,  and  economic  environments.  Drafted  in  2002,  it  is  expected  to  be \nenacted in December 2003.3 Real gross domestic product (GDP) was 6.5% in 2001 and 6.9% in \n2000.  Strong  economic  growth  has  been  attributed  to  development  of  commerce,  public \nadministration,  hotels  and  restaurants,  transportation  and  communications,  construction,  and \nfisheries. Economic activities and government offices are concentrated in Apia, particularly the \ncentral business area (CBA).  \n \nThe 2001 census data indicate that 88% of the population has access to safe sanitation, \n5. \nand World Bank data for 2002 indicate that 95% of the urban population has improved facilities.4 \nThis  access  to  sanitation  data  misrepresents  the  public  health  implications  of  the  sanitation \n\n                                                 \n1   Extracted from the 2001 National Population and Household Census for Samoa. \n2   Government of Samoa. 2002.

Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\nstatus of many living in the urban areas. In urban Apia, for example, about 75% of households \nhave septic systems, but many are too small, rarely cleaned, and sometimes directly linked to \nthe  nearest  drainage  channel,  polluting  groundwater,  surface  streams,  and  the  harbor.  In  the \nCBA and special needs areas (those with special wastewater concerns) such as hospitals and \nmajor school compounds, less than 10% of wastewater is adequately treated. The hospital has \na poorly operating treatment plant, as do most commercial centers and government complexes. \nOthers  have  inadequate  septic  systems.  The  situation  is  exacerbated  by  the  historical  lack  of \nurban  management,  including  the  absence of drainage or wastewater management plans and \nthe  absence  of  effective  town  planning.  Individuals  have  elevated  their  plot  heights,  reclaimed \nland  in  the  mangrove  area,  and  blocked  drainage  channels.  The  effect  is  a  haphazard  and \ncumulative  nonfunctioning  drainage  system.  Flooding  after  heavy  rain  is  intensified,  and  foul \nwater  flooding  poses  a  health  risk  due  to  septage  and  latrine  wastes  being  released  to  the \nsurface  environment.  The  Health  Sector  Strategic  Plan  specifically  identifies  environmental \nhealth  issues,  including  the  lack  of  a  public  sewerage  system  and  drainage  problems,  as \naffecting  public  health.  The  plan  links  recent  outbreaks  of  dengue,  incidence  of  diarrhea, \nrespiratory and skin diseases with the need for more intensive environmental health control.5  \n \nNearshore  marine  water  and  urban  stream-water  quality  in  Apia  has  been  significantly \n6. \ndegraded  due  to  inadequate  sanitation  and  wastewater  management  systems.  Water  quality-\nmonitoring  data,  which  have  been  only  intermittently  collected,  show  definitive  evidence  of \nsewage  contamination  as  evidenced  by  low  dissolved  oxygen  saturation,  high  biochemical \noxygen  demand  (BOD),  high  total  nitrogen  concentration,  and  high  indicator  bacteria \nconcentration.6 Urban drains are often choked with litter and vegetation, foul smelling (indicating \nanaerobic conditions), and contain floating oil and sewage. Drains and natural watercourses are \ncontaminated  with  sewage  and,  occasionally,  industrial  waste.  Monitoring  is  done  infrequently \nand usually  result  from  donor-funded  activities,  including  previous  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)-supported TA. 7 Samoa has no legislative framework for environmental standards. \n \nThroughout the last decade, the Government has been increasingly concerned with the \n7. \nimpact  of  rapid  population  growth  and  development  pressures  in  urban  areas:  (i)  inadequate \nurban  infrastructure  provision  to  cope  with  the  expanding  urban  population;  (ii)  absence  of  an \nagreed  framework  and  coordinated  approach  for  urban  management  and  planning,  including \nunclear institutional arrangements; and (iii) the need to resolve land issues ( supply, tenure, and \navailability) to meet demand for housing, infrastructure development, and urban expansion. The \nGovernment\u2019s  reform  agenda  includes  reducing  the  scope  of  government  activity  through \nrationalization,  corporatization  and  contracting  out  of  some  services.  The  dramatic  downsizing \nof the Ministry of Works Transport and Infrastructure (MWTI) by about 80%, and outsourcing of \nmany traditional functions are examples of this.8 Public health, environmental quality, and better \nurban  planning  are  all  incorporated  into  the  Economic  Development  Strategy.  Similarly,  the \nTourism  Development  Plan  2002-2006  emphasizes  sustainability  (including  planning  and \ndevelopment,  natural  resources,  waste  and  pollution)  and  appropriateness  of  development  for \nSamoa. \n \n\n                                                 \n5   Health  data  are  not  in  a  form  useful  to  state  quantitative  indicators.  Thus,  the  Health  Sector  Strategic  Plan  is \nreferenced.  Capacity-building  components  described  elsewhere  in  the  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the \nPresident address this issue. \n\n6   For  example,  fecal  coliform  levels  in  Vaiusu  Bay  have  been  measured  at  over  5,700  organisms  per  100  milliliter \n(ml), while the United States standard for shellfish gathering is 14 organisms per 100 ml.

The Government is committed to the principle of  full cost recovery and autonomy of SWA \nand other government utility corporations, as expressed in the Public Bodies (Performance and \nAccountability)  Act.  However,  the  Government  recognizes  that  full  cost  recovery  from  user \ncharges is not feasible now due to broader environmental, economic, and social objectives. The \nGovernment  thus  supports  public  utilities  through  compensation  for  Community  Service \nObligations  (CSOs),  i.e.,  services  that  contribute  to  these  broader  objectives.9  As  costs  are \ngradually recovered, CSOs will be reduced to the point where they are only used to guarantee \naccess to the poor and vulnerable. Currently, the CSOs include subsidies for a lifeline block of \nwater supply and fire protection, however, additional subsidy is necessary to support SWA. \n \n9. \nUrban  infrastructure  and  services  have  traditionally  been  provided  by  national \ngovernment agencies such as the Department of Lands, Survey, and Environment (DLSE), and  \nMWTI.  The  social,  cultural,  and  administrative  aspects  of  traditional  village  life  in  Apia  come \nunder the village councils for which the Ministry of Women Community and Social Development \nhas  administrative  responsibility.10  These  agencies  planned  and  provided  for  infrastructure \nrequirements  and  constituted  the  de  facto  institutional  framework  for  planning  and  urban \nmanagement before the establishment of the Planning and Urban Management Agency (PUMA) \nin  2002,  and  preparation  of  the  Planning  and  Urban  Management  Strategy  for  Samoa,  which \nwere  assisted  by  ADB  TA.  PUMA  and  the  strategy  resulted  from  extensive  stakeholder \nconsultations  that  showed  a  growing  awareness  of  the  urgent  need  for  a  coordinated  and \nintegrated approach to urban planning and development.11 \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n10.  With  the  Government\u2019s  growing  concern  about  inadequate  urban  infrastructure  and \ncoordination  of  development  activities  also  came  concern  at  the  community  level;  where \ncustomary  lands  in  Apia  were  once  not  available  for  development,  fono increasingly accepted \nthat they had to discuss land-planning options, given increasing development pressure. In 2000-\n2001  this  joint  concern  resulted  in  the  review  of  institutional  arrangements  for  planning  and \nurban  management  in  Apia  and  the  ensuing  establishment  of  PUMA.  Key  among  the  issues \nraised  by  the  community  were  the  environmental  deterioration  of  the  urban  and  peri-urban \nareas,  increasingly  inadequate  or  inefficient  provision  of  infrastructure  and  services,  and  land \ntenure  problems  associated  with  complex  traditional  land  ownership  systems  and  need  for \ngovernment access to certain lands to provide basic services. \n \n11. \nRehabilitation  and  improvement  of  drains  and  floodways  to  mitigate  regular flooding in \nthe  CBA,  markets,  and  low-lying  adjacent  areas  are  urgently  needed.  Wastewater  and \nsanitation  improvements  are  needed  to  meet  basic  public  health  requirements  for  households \nand mitigate impacts of inadequate wastewater facilities in the CBA and other identified priority \nneeds areas. The Project takes advantage of the Government\u2019s commitment to improve urban \nmanagement  and  the  growing  community  awareness  to  respond  to  the  urgent  drainage  and \nsanitation  problems,  which  is  an  important  step  to  establish  a  fully  functioning  urban \nmanagement  system.  Besides  the  benefits  of  physical  development,  the  Project  also  includes \n\n                                                 \n9   CSO legally refers to the services performed but is commonly applied to the funding of these services.

Much of Apia is built on low-lying flood-prone land, parts of which were \nmangrove swamp before reclamation and development. Filling is most prominent in the natural \nfloodplain  of  Vaiusu  Bay  adjoining  the  CBA,  with  such  activities  continuing  to  change  storm \nwater  runoff  patterns,  and  groundwater  and  flood  flow  patterns.  The  continuing  lack  of  urban \nplanning,  including  lack  of  land-use  controls  and  guidelines,  land  filling,  encroachment  into \nwaterways, and lack of drainage maintenance, have all contributed to the  incidence of flooding \nand impact on property and health.12  \n \nPrevious  proposals  for  sanitation  in  Apia  in  the  mid-  to  late  1990s  all  advocated  large-\n13. \nscale sanitation systems based on a reticulated system serving a minimum 10,000 population.13 \nThese  schemes  were  extensive,  covering  the  CBA,  low-lying  and  floodplain  areas,  and \nindustrial  estates  some  6  kilometers  to  the  northwest.  Such  blanket  schemes  for  sanitation \nfailed  to  win  government  and  other  stakeholder  support.  Large-scale  schemes  were  not \nconsidered  appropriate  because  (i)  they  were  expensive;  (ii)  institutional  capacity  and \ncommitment to implement, operate, and maintain them was limited; (iii) they failed to recognize \nthe  highest  priority  of  improving  the  Apia  water  scheme  and  implementing  water  tariffs;  (iv) \ndisposal  to  sea  by  ocean  outfall  was  seen  by  many  as  resulting  in  adverse  impacts  on  the \nmarine  ecology  and  Samoa\u2019s  image;  and  (v)  the  proposed  sewage  treatment  plant  sites  in \nnorthwest  Apia  were  not  considered  appropriate.  Since  2000  the  Government  has  reviewed \noptions that address these stakeholder issues and concerns,14 including a focus on incremental \nsewerage and drainage system development and affordable integrated solutions that meet user \ngroups\u2019 technical needs while developing the planning and urban management framework. This \nfocus is documented in the Government\u2019s Apia Planning Policy Framework. \n \n14. \nADB has invested $1.67 million in urban development and wastewater management TA. \nInitial TA recommendations failed to gain support for the reasons outlined above, while recent \nTA that have focused on consultation first and detailed design second which have been able to \ngain  the  necessary  support.    Lessons  learned  from  this  experience  and  other  ADB  and  other \ndonors  are  (i)  consultation  and  dialogue  among  stakeholders  is  important  in  achieving  project \nsupport; (ii) large-scale reticulated solutions are not appropriate at this time for several reasons \nincluding  affordability  (Government  and  consumers),  institutional  capacity,  and  technical \ncapacity; (iii) land tenure matters are an integral part of project design and implementation; (iv) \nocean  discharge  of  effluent  requires  a  high  level  of  treatment  and  long  outfall  pipes;  (v) \nwastewater  management  infrastructure  needs  to  be  improved  as  part  of  broad  urban \nmanagement  planning;  (vi)  management  needs  to  be  included  in  capacity-building assistance; \nand  (vii)  capacity  building  requires  long-term  approaches  with  more  time  allocated  to  process \nand provide for long-term, distance advisory services, such as twinning arrangements. Solutions \nneed  to  be  locally  driven  and  respectful  of  the  local  situation,  including  understanding  why \nprevious schemes did not win broad stakeholder support. The Project addresses these lessons \nby  including  multifaceted  solutions.  It  is  an  appropriately  scaled  incremental  approach  that \nensures  affordability,  and  institutional  and  technical  capacity  to  support  the  Project,  while \n\n                                                 \n12 Appendixes 4 and 10 provide detailed data on the flooding, including technical data and economic costs. \n13  The  most  recent  proposals  were  embodied  in    ADB.  1994.

Consequently, \nthe Project includes a substantial capacity-building component, which is consistent with recent \nADB  Operations  Evaluation  Department  recommendations  for  improving  capacity  building.  15  \nThe  Project  provides  the  opportunity  to  foster  the  Government\u2019s  expressed  goal  of  improving \ntransparency of CSOs, overall financial autonomy, and general governance of public utilities by \naddressing  these  issues  for  SWA  under  the  capacity  building  component  of  the  loan.    Project \nmanagement  capacity  building  will  foster  the  MWTI  strategy  to  outsource  works  to  the  private \nsector. 16 \n \nThe Project is a part of the Government\u2019s overall strategic urban management strategy. \n16. \nIt is the first significant investment toward achieving urban environmental conditions that meet  \ninternationally recognized standards of environmental quality and Samoa standards as they are \ndeveloped. While achieving incremental environmental and drainage improvements, it provides \n(i)  data  needed  to  develop  long-term  physical  improvement  plans,  and  (ii)  capacity  building  to \nsustainably provide urban services such as wastewater and drainage. \n \nThe Project supports ADB\u2019s strategy for Samoa17 and Water Policy by (i) fostering good \n17. \nwater  and  environment  governance,  (ii)  improving  living  conditions,  and  (iii)  promoting  private \nsector  growth  and  creating  jobs  through  private  sector  participation  in  providing  wastewater \nservices  and  improving  environmental  infrastructure.  The  emphasis  on  integrated  water \nresource  management,  which  is  promoted  through  capacity  building,  support  for  PUMA,  and \npromotion of regional cooperation by establishing a utility twinning arrangement, supports ADB\u2019s \nWater Policy. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nObjectives \n\nThe  overall  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  help  improve  Apia\u2019s  environment  and  public \n18. \nhealth  through  improved  drainage  and  sanitation  infrastructure  and  capacity  in  urban \nmanagement. Project objectives include (i) improved public health, (ii) improved environmental \nquality, (iii) improved surface and groundwater quality, and (iv) reduced frequency of flooding in \nspecific low-lying areas. The Project also promotes private sector participation in the provision \nof  urban  services  through  the  outsourcing  of  certain  utility  services  to  the  private  sector  and \nfurther promotes private sector development through provision of improved urban infrastructure \nand environment for businesses. \n \n19. \nDrainage-related activities will include rehabilitation of floodways and drains upstream of \nthe  Asaga  and  Gasegase  confluence  in  the  lower  catchment  area,  and  installation  of  water \ngauges for flood monitoring in the upper and lower catchment areas. The sanitation component \nprovides  a  range  of  solutions  to  meet  varying  sanitation  needs  and  concerns  in  the  CBA, \nadjoining  low-lying  areas,  and  urban  Apia.  The  Project  also  includes  capacity  building  of  the \n\n                                                 \n15 ADB. 2003. IN64-03.

The Ministry of Health (MOH), Environmental Health Division, and the \nMinistry of Agriculture (MOA) will receive targeted capacity building.  \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nThe  Project\u2019s  three  components  are  (i)  drainage,  (ii)  wastewater  management  and \n20. \nsanitation,  and  (iii)  capacity  building.  Project  outputs  include  (i)  improved  floodways;  (ii) \nrehabilitated  existing  drains;  (iii)  installation  of  water  gauges  for  flood  monitoring;  (iv)  design, \nconstruction, and operation of a wastewater collection and treatment system; (v) utility-managed \nindividual  sanitation  systems;  and  (vi)  strengthened  institutions  and  legislative  frameworks  for \nwastewater management, drainage, urban management, and environmental monitoring. \n \n\n1. \n\nComponent A: Drainage for the Gasegase and Asaga Catchments \n\n21. \nComponent  A  mitigates  the  effects  of  flooding  in  the  Gasegase  River,  Asaga  Stream \nBypass, and Fugalei Stream area to the southwest of the CBA, and will provide data to develop \na  broader  drainage  management  plan  to  guide  future  improvements.  The  component  focuses \non rehabilitating the floodway (440 meters [m]) in the Fugalei River downstream of the Fugalei \nStreet  Bridge  to  the  confluence  with  the  Gasegase  Stream  (860  m)  in  Asaga  Stream Bypass \nand  (1,550  m)  in  the  Gasegase  River.  Accumulated  waste  in  the  mangroves  lining  the \nGasegase River to its mouth in Vaiusu Bay will be removed. Upstream of Fugalei Street Bridge \nin the Fugalei Stream (1,350 m) and north of Vaitele Road of Asaga  Stream Bypass (1,075 m), \nstorm  drains  will  be  cleaned,  rubbish  and  silt  removed,  and  survey  levels  established.  Water \ngauging stations will be installed in the project area and other catchments to monitor flood flows \nand  provide  data  for  hydraulic  modeling  and  further  drainage  design.  Topographical  and \ncadastral  surveys  will  establish  levels  in  the  floodplain  and  low-lying  area,  support  hydraulic \nmodeling  of  flood  flows,  guide  design  and  implementation  of  civil  works.  Pumps  that  can  be \nmounted on trucks will be provided to release floodwaters from constrained drainage ways and  \nprovide  emergency  pumping  for  areas  where  foul  water  may  accumulate,  to  minimize  health \nhazards. \n \n\n2. \n\nComponent  B:  Wastewater  Management  and  Sanitation  Infrastructure  for \nApia \n\nComponent B, which addresses urgent wastewater and sanitation needs in urban Apia \n\n22. \nand, has three subcomponents:  \n \n\n(i) \n\nIndividual  system  rehabilitation  and  septage  collection  and  treatment \nprogram. SWA will implement an operation and maintenance (O&M) program for \nindividual systems, which will include rehabilitation of systems in low-lying areas \nand regular pump-out of all individual systems in greater Apia. A detailed sanitary \nsurvey  at  the  start  of  the  Project  will  determine  specific  rehabilitation  needs, \ndefine  rehabilitation  standards,  prioritize  rehabilitation  activities,  and  identify \nappropriate  pump-out intervals. SWA will manage private sector O&M contracts \nfor delivery of individual sanitation system services. The program will be funded \nby  a  sanitation  surcharge  on  all  greater  Apia  water  bills.  Up  to  500  households \nwill  be  included  in  the  rehabilitation  program,  and  all  of  greater  Apia\u2019s  8,000 \nhouseholds will be provided septage collection services. The Project will provide \ntwo 10 cubic meter (m3) vacuum trucks for this service. Septage will be disposed \nof  in  lined  lagoons  at  the  Tafai\u2019gata  landfill  and  in  a  pilot  waste-to-energy \n\n\f7 \n\n \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nanaerobic digester that is being developed through a government-private sector \npartnership.18, 19 \n\nCBA  wastewater  collection  and  treatment  system.  The  wastewater  system \nincludes  2.0  km  of  sewers,  1.3  km  of  rising  mains,  and  a  wastewater  treatment \nplant  (WWTP)  with  an  average  capacity  of  950  m3/day.  The  WWTP  will  meet \nsecondary  treatment  standards  and  include  disinfection.  WWTP  effluent will be \ndischarged to adjoining subsurface infiltration galleries. The WWTP also serves \nseveral  priority  special  needs  areas,  including  the  National  Hospital,  Malifa \nSchool,  and  Fugalei  Market,  which  make  up  approximately  450  m3/day  of \nindicated capacity. WWTP will treat its biosolids (sludge) and dispose of it in the \nTafa\u2019igata  landfill.  This  system  will  serve  approximately  110  business  and \ngovernment customers. \n\nSpecial needs area wastewater treatment. A number of areas with particularly \nsignificant  pollutant  sources  or  other  factors  requiring  special  consideration  and \nprioritization for improved wastewater management were prioritized for inclusion \nunder  the  Project.  These  areas  include  the  National  Hospital,  Malifa  Education \nCompound,  Fugalei  Market  area,  and  the  commercial  area  from  Mulivai  to \nVaisigano  streams  along  the  Main  Beach  Road.  The  total  wastewater  flow  for \nthese  facilities  is  approximately  450  m3/day.  These  areas  will  be  directly \nconnected  to  the  CBA  scheme,  with  sewers  connecting  these  facilities  to  the \nCBA collection system, sized to allow future connections.20 Approximately 3.0 km \nof  sewers  and  0.4  km  of  rising  mains  will  be  constructed  to  connect  these \nsystems to the WWTP. The Project includes an allocation for additional special \nneeds areas based on criteria to be developed during the detailed design phase, \nwhich may be addressed through a range of technical options, including reuse of \nexisting systems.  \n\n \n\n3. \n\nComponent C: Capacity Building \n\n \n23. \nComponent C will provide capacity building in technical and management areas as well \nas community awareness programs. Capacity building will focus on SWA, with targeted capacity \nbuilding  for  MWTI,  PUMA,  Fisheries  Department,  MOA,  and  MOH.  Capacity  building  will  be \nprovided  in  the  following  technical  and  utility  management  areas:  (i)  project  management;  (ii) \ncontract  management;  (iii)  utility  management;  (iv)  financial  management,  including  billing \nsystems;  (v)  customer  management;  (v)  community  awareness  and  public  relations;  (vi) \nplanning  for  wastewater  management  and  drainage;  (vii)  technical  aspects  of  wastewater \nmanagement and sanitation systems; (viii) asset management; (ix) development of project and \ninstitutional  monitoring  systems;  (x)  development  of  ambient  water  quality  standards  and an \nambient water quality monitoring system; (xi) health benefits monitoring for the MOH; and (xii) \nmonitoring of marine resources for environmental pollutants for the Fisheries Department. \n \n24. \nKey to capacity building will be completion of training-needs analysis prior to developing \ntraining  programs  and  monitoring  to  ensure  effective  capacity  building.  Training  programs  are \nbeing provided to target groups in SWA, MWTI, PUMA, MOA, and MOH. Sustainability of SWA \ncapacity  building  will  be  enhanced  by  funding  a  twinning  arrangement  with  a  well-functioning \n\n                                                 \n18 This project is facilitated by Sustainable Project Management, a nongovernment organization that promotes public-\n\nprivate partnerships. \n\n19 The digester is not yet operational and energy use not yet determined. \n20  The  Government  has  no  immediate  plans  for  such  connections.  However,  additional  capacity  is  warranted  as  a \ncentralized system is likely to expand as management capacity increases and such expansion becomes affordable. \n\n\f8 \n\nwastewater utility, or similar organization, for SWA. Project implementation assistance will also \nbe  included  with  the  consulting  services  package  for  this  component.21  Outline  terms  of \nreference (TOR) for these consulting services are in Appendix 14. \n \n25. \nCommunity  education  and  awareness  programs  are  needed  throughout  the  Project  in \nthe  following  key  areas:  (i)  need  for  new  infrastructure  and  new  practices,  including \nenvironmental  implications  of  unsafe  sanitation  and  drainage  practices;  (ii)  the  application  of \ngood on-site planning principles and practices for sanitation and drainage; (iii) on-site sanitation \ndesign and O&M, including information on where to seek technical assistance and advice; (iv) \nresponsibilities of the Government, households, and individuals for sanitation and drainage; and \n(v)  safe  wastewater  practices.  The  focus  will  be  on  development  of  SWA  and  government \ncapabilities to develop community and public relations programs, and will emphasize proactive \nrather than reactive programs. The main activities will focus on the use of radio, TV Samoa, and \ntarget  programs  for  groups  and  individuals  most  affected,  including  residents  in  the  low-lying \nareas, youth, school children, and the Apia Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Assistance in \ndeveloping these programs is included in the capacity-building consulting services. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n26. \nThe Government has begun a pilot project with a nongovernment organization to use an \nanaerobic  digester  to  convert  organic  solid  waste  to  energy  at  the  Tafai\u2019gata  landfill  site. \nIntegration with that project may be possible by disposing of WWTP sludge to the digester. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $10  million  equivalent.  This  includes  a  foreign \n27. \nexchange cost of $3.8 million equivalent (about 38% of the total) and a local cost of $6.2 million \nequivalent  (about  62%).

The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years. The \ninterest rate will be 1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. The Government will on-\nlend  a  portion  of  the  loan  proceeds  ($3.5  million  equivalent)  denominated  in  tala,  with  foreign \nexchange risk borne by the Government for the wastewater and sanitation component to SWA \nat  a  32-year  term,  a  5-year  grace  period,  and  interest  at  5%  per  annum.  If  SWA\u2019s  financial \nsituation improves, these terms may be adjusted, subject to prior agreement with ADB. \n \n29. \nSamoa is a category-A  country  and  eligible  for  80%  financing  of  the  estimated  project \ncost. Government counterpart funding will provide $2.0 million equivalent. ADB funding includes \n$3.8 million equivalent for foreign exchange cost and $4.2 million equivalent for local currency \ncosts.  The  Government  will  fund  any  tax  liability  over  and  above  its  20%  counterpart \ncontribution.  The  Government  is  committed  to  providing  timely  counterpart  funds  and  will \nincorporate  required  amounts  into  the  budget  for  financial  years  2004/05  onward.  Counterpart \nfunding  requirements  and  debt  service  on  the  loan  are  reasonable  compared  to  Treasury \nresources  and  ongoing  commitments  to  other  externally  funded  projects.

A  project  steering \ncommittee  has  been  constituted,  chaired  by  the  chief  executive  officer  (CEO)  MOF  and  co-\nchaired by the managing director of SWA and CEOs of MWTI and Ministry of Natural Resources \nand Environment. Other steering committee members include the CEOs of MOA, MOH, Ministry \nof Women, Community and Social Development; and the general manager of the Electric Power \nCorporation. \n \n31. \nThe  Project  will  have  two  Implementing  Agencies  (IA):  (i)  MWTI  for  the  drainage \ncomponent, and (ii) SWA for the wastewater management and sanitation component. A project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU)  will  be  established.  The  EA  will  appoint  a  local,  full-time, dedicated \nproject manager acceptable to ADB, who will be financed under the loan, to coordinate project \nactivities;  monitor  overall  project  progress;  and  manage  project  accounts,  procurement,  and \nreporting; and report to the project steering committee. The PMU will  be assisted by designated \ncoordinators  from  each  of  the  IAs  and  PUMA,  and  implementation  assistance  consultants, \n\n\f10 \n\nthrough the implementing agencies.  Coordinators will report to the steering committee.22  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n32. \nThe loan is expected to be effective by the end of the first quarter of 2004. Preparatory \nactivities,  including  detailed  design,  tender  documentation,  and  procurement  of  consulting \nservices  will  be  completed  by  the  end  of  2004,  with  construction  and  commissioning  to  be \ncompleted by the end of 2006. This timeframe takes account of the wet season and appropriate \nconstruction  periods.  Capacity  building  and  the  community  awareness  program  will  be \nundertaken over the entire project period (2004-2005). \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nADB-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \n33. \nfor  Procurement.  Major  contracts  for  civil  works  valued  at  greater  than  $1  million  and  supply \ncontracts  valued  at  $500,000  or  more  will  be  undertaken  through  ADB\u2019s  international \ncompetitive bidding procedures (ICB). Equipment packages valued at less than $500,000 will be \nprocured following ADB\u2019s  procedures  for  international  shopping  (IS).  Civil  works  estimated  to \ncost  $1  million  or  less  per  package  will  be  carried  out  under  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB) \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  in  accordance  with  government  procurement  laws  and \nregulations. For LCB packages, local contractors have the expertise and capacity to undertake \nsuch works. Since such civil works will involve mainly labor costs, international contractors are \nunlikely  to  be  interested  in  the  works,  and  the  use  of  LCB  is  considered  acceptable.  In \naccordance with ADB requirements, foreign contractors may participate in the bidding for LCB \ncontracts.  Prequalification,  selection,  and  engagement  of  contractors  will  be  subject  to  ADB \napproval.23  As  soon  as  the  bids  received  have  been  evaluated,  the  proposal  for  award  of \ncontracts  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval.  It  will  be  furnished  with  three  copies  of  (i)  an \naccount  of  the  public  opening  of  bids,  (ii)  summary  evaluation  of  bids,  (iii)  the  proposal  for \naward, and (iv) a draft contract or letter of acceptance. Promptly after such award, ADB will be \nfurnished with three copies of the contract as executed. The internationally tendered equipment \npackages  will  include  technical  support  to  ensure  proper  installation,  testing,  commissioning, \nand training of operational staff as part of the related contracts. This approach assures quality \ncontrol  in  equipment  installation  and  operator  training  by  utilizing  the  manufacturers\u2019  and \nsuppliers\u2019 technical experts who are most knowledgeable about the equipment. \n \n34. \nconsultant recruitment so that project implementation proceeds in a timely manner and project \ngoals  can  be  achieved  as  soon  as  possible.24  Recruitm ent  of  international  consultants  is  for \nproject implementation and capacity building. Advance recruitment of consultants will be carried \nout  in  conformity  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  The  Government  was \nadvised  that  approval  of  advance  action  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  procurement  and \nrecruitment costs or to finance the Project. \n \n\nThe  EA  has  requested  ADB  to  approve  advance  action  to  initiate  the  early  start  of     \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n35. \nThe staff of SWA, PUMA, and MWTI need strengthened expertise in management and \ntechnical  areas  described  for  component  C  and  project  implementation  assistance.  Capacity \nbuilding  will  be  achieved  through  consultant  inputs  that  will  include  formal  training  based  on  a \n                                                 \n22 Supplementary Appendix F includes an implementation arrangement organization chart. \n23  ADB will encourage the EA to use ADB-approved standard bidding documents (to be developed as necessary) to \n\nensure high quality and consistency of the documents, which will hasten ADB\u2019s review. \n\n24  Approval of advance action was published in ADB Business Opportunities on 16 September 2003. \n\n\f11 \n\ncomprehensive  training  needs  analysis  and  hands-on  training  on  project  facilities.  A  twinning \nrelationship  with  an  experienced  wastewater  utility  will  be  established  for  SWA.  Capacity \nbuilding will be financed from the loan. \n \n36. \nProvision  has  been  made  for  48  person-months  of  international  and  65  person-months \nof  domestic  consulting  services  to  support  SWA  in  Project  implementation  and  provide  the \nnecessary  capacity  building  to  be  funded  under  the  loan.  These  consultants  will  provide \nassistance to SWA in the areas of ADB procedures and reporting, recruitment of detailed design \nconstruction  and  operations  contractors,  design  review,  procurement,  quality  control, \nconstruction supervision, start-up testing, commissioning, O&M training, and implementation of \nthe  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS).  Detailed  design  of  the  wastewater \nsystem  will  be  undertaken  through  a  design-build-operate  contract.  Outline  TOR  for  the \nconsulting services are in Appendix 14. In addition to training provided directly by the consulting \nfirm,  SWA  will  use  loan  funds  to  finance  a  twinning  arrangement,  with  an  allocation  of  10 \nperson-months  with  a  regional  wastewater  utility  to  foster  sustainable  long-term  capacity \nbuilding  and  cooperation.  This  twinning  arrangement  will  be  retained  separately,  with  the \ncapacity-building  consultancy  assisting \nimplementation \nmechanisms, and contracting arrangements. The project manager for the PMU will be recruited \nwith loan consultant funds under a separate package that will include provisions for accounting \nand administrative services. \n \n37. \nRecruitment  of  consultant  services  as  a  firm  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nmethod,  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  the  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants.  The  firms  will  be  required  to  submit  a  full  technical  proposal.  The  PMU  project \nmanager will be recruited as an individual in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. \n \n\nin  developing  appropriate  TOR, \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n38. \nAn  imprest  account  will  be  established by the EA immediately after loan effectiveness. \nReplenishment  to  the  imprest  account  will  be  supported  by  appropriate  withdrawal  application \nand  related  documentation.  The  initial  amount  to  be  deposited  in  the  imprest  account  will  not \nexceed $300,000 equivalent. The statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure may be used for \nreimbursement of eligible expenditures and liquidation of  imprest account expenses. The SOE \nprocedure  is  applicable  to  individual  payments  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $50,000. \nDetailed  arrangements  for  the  establishment  and  operation  of    the  Imprest  Account  and  SOE \nprocedure will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook 2001. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n39. \nThe EA and SWA will maintain separate accounts for the Project. The EA, through the \nPMU, and SWA will maintain records of all project expenditures. The EA, through the PMU, will \nprepare consolidated project accounts, which will be audited annually by independent auditors \nacceptable  to  ADB.  Loan  consulting  services  include  funding  of  accounting  and  administrative \nservices  for  the  PMU,  including  funds  to  cover  quarterly  accounts  and  independent  audits. \nCertified copies of such audited accounts will be submitted to ADB not later than 9 months after \nthe  end  of  the  financial  year  to  which  they  relate.  An  externally  audited  financial  statement  of \ngovernment  and  SWA  project  accounts  will  also  be  submitted  to  ADB  annually,  no  later  than \nnine months after the end of the relevant financial year, for the entire implementation period.25 \n\n                                                 \n25  SWA has three tiers of audit: internal, government, and external. \n\n\f12 \n\nThe EA and SWA were informed of ADB's policy on submission of audited financial statements \nand  possible  penalties  for  delays  in  submission.  The  submitted  audited  project  accounts  and \nfinancial statements must be of acceptable quality; financial statements with adverse opinions or \ndisclaimers  of  opinion  from  auditors  are  not  acceptable  and  cannot  be  submitted  for  this \npurpose.  Independent  review  and  scrutiny  of  project  implementation  will  be  undertaken  for  (i) \nenvironmental  monitoring  and  adherence  to  Summary  Initial  Environment  Examination  (SIEE) \nand  the  Government\u2019s  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  (EIA)  provisions,  and  (ii)  audit  of \nproject accounts and compliance with loan covenants. \n \nThe  Government  will  submit  to  ADB reports and information concerning the use of the \n40. \nloan  proceeds,  project  implementation,  and  SWA  performance.  The  reports  will  include  (i) \nquarterly  progress  reports  on  project  implementation;  (ii)  annual  reports;  and  (iii)  a  project \ncompletion report, no later than three months after completion of the project facilities. Progress \nreports will emphasize progress made in the areas of policy dialogue, including (i) wastewater \ntariff  charges  and  financial  management,  (ii)  environmental  and  water  quality  monitoring, and \n(iii) capacity building and financial management of SWA. \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n41. \nThe PPMS indicators agreed on during project preparation include service levels, treated \nwastewater quality and other measures of operational performance, percentages of wastewater \ncollected  and  treated,  user  satisfaction  with  the  urban  environment,  and  relevant  health, \nenvironmental and economic data to monitor project impacts. The relevance and practicability of \ndata  collection  for  the  proposed  measures  have  been  confirmed  with  the  Government.  At  the \nbeginning  of  the  Project,  the  Government  and  SWA  will  develop  comprehensive  PPMS \nprocedures  to  systematically  generate  data  on  inputs  and  outputs  of  the  three  project \ncomponents  and  the  agreed-on  socioeconomic  and  environmental  indicators  to  be  used  to \nmeasure  project  impacts.  The  PMU  and  SWA  will  refine  the  PPMS  framework,  confirm \nachievable  goals,  refine  monitoring  and  recording  arrangements,  and  establish  systems  and \nprocedures no later than six months after loan effectiveness. \n \n42. \nUnder the PPMS framework, baseline and progress data will be reported at the requisite \ntime  intervals  by  the  EA,  which  will  be  responsible  for  analyzing  and  consolidating  the  data \nthrough its management information system. The PPMS will permit adequate flexibility to adopt \nremedial  action  for  project  design,  schedules,  activities,  and  development  impacts.  The  PMU, \nwith assistance from consultants, will monitor and assess activities, and report to ADB quarterly \non  the  physical  implementation  and  financial  aspects  of  the  Project  as  well  as  environmental \naspects  to  ensure  that  progress  and  impacts  are  monitored  and  reported  in  line  with  ADB \nrequirements. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n43. \nRegular ADB review missions are envisaged, and a midterm review will be undertaken \nby ADB and the Government, approximately 1.5 years after project implementation begins. This \nreview  will  include  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  scope,  implementation  arrangements, \nachievement of scheduled targets, and progress on the agenda for policy reform and capacity \nbuilding measures. A detailed review of the wastewater tariffs will also be undertaken. Feedback \nfrom the PPMS activities will be analyzed. \n \n\n\f13 \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nfor  PUMA,  SWA  and  MWTI;  (ii)  systems \n\n44. \nThe  Government  has  confirmed  its  request  for  a  concurrent  TA  for  institutional \nstrengthening  of  infrastructure  planning  as  it  relates  to  the  Project  and  long-term planning for \ndrainage and wastewater management.26 Project investments need to be supported by further \nplanning, including (i) development of drainage and wastewater management plans for Apia, (ii) \nrevision  of  building  standards  for  on-site  sanitation  systems,  and  (iii)  development  of  enabling \nlegislation and implementing regulations for improved wastewater management and sanitation. \nThe  sustainability  of  the  outputs  delivered  under  the  Project  will  depend  on  (i)  improved \nto  strengthen \nplanning  and  management \nimplementation of regulations for the Government\u2019s new Planning and Urban Management Bill27 \nand (iii) improved community awareness and understanding of new planning and development \nprocesses.  The  TA  is  expected  to  start  soon  after  loan  effectiveness,  or  April  2004,  and  be \ncompleted by March 2005. \n \n45. \nThe TA has two components: (i) drainage and wastewater management planning and (ii) \nurban  planning  and  regulation.  Long-term  drainage  and  wastewater  management  plans  for \ngreater  Apia,  and  enabling  legislation  will  be  developed.  These  plans  will  detail  preferred \ntechnical,  institutional,  policy,  and  legislative  measures  to  address  current  to  long-term \nrequirements, and emphasize integration and phasing so that improvements are affordable and \nsustainable.  The  enabling  legislation  for  wastewater  management,  including  sanitation,  will \ndescribe  institutional  arrangements  for  wastewater  management.  The  planning  and  regulation \ncomponent  focuses  on  institutionalizing  the  new  PUMA  Bill  with  key  stakeholders,  including \nPUMA, MWTI, and SWA. It will facilitate new planning assessment processes and procedures \nand implementation of a land planning and geographic information system (GIS) for PUMA. The \nTA will also help PUMA develop a strategy for community awareness. \n \n46. \nThe TA involves 11 person-months   of international and 13 person-months of domestic \nconsultants,  who  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  and  simplified  technical \nproposal,  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  the  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $475,000  equivalent,  with  $400,000 \nequivalent  financed  by  ADB.28  Expertise  areas  to  be  recruited  under  the  TA  include \ncivil/environmental  engineering,  urban  planning,  environmental  law,  GIS,  and  community \ndevelopment awareness. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\n47. \nThe  Project  will  improve  environmental  conditions,  reduce  health  risks,  and  provide \ngreater  amenities  to  Apia\u2019s  60,000  residents,  approximately  2,000  working  population,  and \n50,000  visitors.  The  Project  directly  benefits  residents  of  Apia  through  provision  of  sanitation \nservices.  A  proportion  of  the  1,750  residents  (minimum  500)  of  the  low-lying areas will benefit \nfrom  rehabilitation  of  household  sanitation  facilities  to  a  minimum  standard.  Businesses, \ngovernment departments, and other organizations in the CBA will benefit from connection to the \ncentral reticulated sewerage system. The upgraded sanitation services for the National Hospital \nwill  benefit  the  10,000  in-patients  and  50,000  outpatients  annually,  hospital  and  MOH  staff \n\n                                                 \n26  This  TA  is  included  in  the  current  Country  Strategy  and  Program Update  for  Samoa  (footnote  17)  as Capacity \nBuilding for Drainage and Sanitation. The TA was first listed in ADB  Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 12 \nFebruary 2003. \n\n27 The Government anticipates that the planning and urban management bill will be enacted by the end of 2003. \n28 Cofinancing from the Japan Special Fund has been applied for.  If the application is not approved, the TA will be \n\nfinanced by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. \n\n\f14 \n\n(approximately  130),  and \nthe  adjacent  village.  The  Malifa  compound  population  of \napproximately  2,200  students,  staff,  and  Department  of  Education  staff  will  benefit  from \nimproved  sanitation.  Residents  and  businesses,  particularly  vendors  based  in  the  Fugalei \nmarket  and  their  customers,  will  benefit  from  improved  drainage.  These  benefits  include  less \ndisruption to roadways and footpaths during and after rainfall, less water  damage to roadways \nand footpaths, reduction of surface litter entering Apia harbor and neighboring mangrove areas. \n \n48. \nIndirect  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  include  the  fisheries  industry  through  improved \nmarine  resources  from  reduction  in  seawater  pollution,  and  the  tourism  industry  through \nimproved urban and marine environments. \n \n49. \nStaff  of  PUMA,  MWTI,  MOA,  and  MOH  will  upgrade  skills  and  capabilities  through \ntraining,  and  a  twinning  arrangement  with  an  experienced  wastewater  utility  will benefit SWA. \nThe  Government  will  benefit  from  improved  environmental  and  health  outcomes,  and  from \nreductions in health expenditures in relation to water-related disease. \n \nA. \n\nPolicy Reform \n\n50. \nThe  Project  supports  key  government  policy  reforms  and  several  ADB  Water  Policy \ninitiatives,  including  (i)  improved  urban  management  and  planning,  (ii)  improved  provision  of \nurban  services,  (iii) cost  recovery  and  tariff  reform  (discussed  in  Financial  Aspects);  and \n(iv) private  sector  participation  in  provision  of  urban  water  services,  (v)  mainstreaming \nenvironmental management, (vi) poverty alleviation and access to basic services (vii) regulation \nof public services, and (ix) stimulating private sector development. \n \nB. \n\nInstitutional Strengthening \n\n51. \nConsultant advisory services will be provided under the loan to assist in the institutional \nstrengthening and capacity building of the key stakeholders, namely, SWA, MWTI, MOA, MOH \nand  PUMA.  Capacity  building  will  occur  via  a  program  of  formal,  informal,  and  on-the-job \ntraining.  \n \nC. \n\nSocial Dimensions \n\n1. \n\nLand and Resettlement \n\nThe  overall  government  strategy  for  drainage  and  wastewater  management  is  to  avoid \n52. \nland  acquisition,  and  the  Project  follows  this  approach.  Nevertheless,  preliminary  design \nindicates that some limited land acquisition involving up to three landowners (1.6 hectares) may \nbe  necessary  for  drainage.  This  level  of  land  acquisition  is  considered  insignificant  by  ADB\u2019s \nPolicy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  and  only  a  short  resettlement  plan  (SRP)  is  required \n(Appendix 13). If any significant land acquisition or resettlement becomes necessary during the \ncourse  of  the  Project,  it  will  notify  ADB.  In  all  cases,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  land \nacquisition is carried out in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations of the Borrower, \nand  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement.  No  land  acquisition  is  expected  for  other \ncomponents  as  government  land  will  be  used  for  the  WWTP,  sewers,  pump  stations,  and \nseptage treatment lagoons.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPoverty \n\n53. \nThe  Project  provides  direct  benefits  to  the  poor  through  improved  living  conditions, \nhealth,  and  limited  job  creation;  and  indirect  benefits  by  reducing  income  poverty  that  accrue \n\n\f15 \n\nfrom reduced health care costs, increased productivity, and economic development. The Project \nwill make a limited direct and greater indirect contribution to poverty alleviation.  \n \n54. \nThe  proportion  of  the  poor  in  the  service  area  population  cannot  be  quantified  as  no \nofficial  poverty  line  has  been  determined  for  Samoa.29,  30  There  is  evidence  that  some  of  the \npoorest households in Apia are in the low-lying area identified in the project design for sanitation \nfacility  rehabilitation.  Many  Apia  residents  are  urban  migrants  who  live  outside  the  traditional \nvillage structure and are exposed to greater social and economic risks because they have no or \nlimited  access  to  traditional  social  protection  mechanisms.  These  poor  households  will  benefit \nfrom  improved  living  conditions  and  reduction  in  health  risks.  Greater  Apia  is  likely  to  include \nsome  poor  households  who  will  share  the  same  benefits  but  with  greater  marginal  utility.  The \nimproved marine environment will benefit the urban poor relying on fishing for consumption and \nincome,  as  well  as  recreational  users.  As  an  environmental  project,  the  Project  will  improve \nliving  conditions  for  all  in  the  service  area,  including  the  poor.  Improved  environmental  quality \nwill  promote  sustainable  urban  development,  for  example,  through  tourism.  Improvement  in \nwater quality will contribute to the steady development of the water tourism industry. \n \nThe  Project  will  directly  reduce  poverty  by  providing  limited  jobs  for  unskilled  laborers \n55. \nduring  construction  and  for  ongoing  drainage  maintenance.  Poverty  reduction  impacts  can be \nexpected  from  economic  growth  as  a  result  of  improvements  to  CBA  infrastructure,  private \nsector  participation  in  provision  of  utility  facilities,  and  improved  marine  environment  for  the \nfisheries industry. An inventory to assess the quality of sanitation facilities throughout the project \narea will also assess the capacity and willingness of the poor to pay for improved services. The \ndesign  of  the  cost-recovery  framework  will  take  into  account  the  impact  on  the  poor  and \nvulnerable.  \n \nD. \n\nFinancial Aspects \n\nCost  recovery  from  user  charges  is  proposed  only  for  the  wastewater  components; \n56. \ndrainage  and  capacity  building  will  be  funded  by  the  Government.  Full  cost  recovery  is  the \ntarget  recovery  rate  from  users.  However,  government  policy  also  considers  the  social  and \neconomic aspects of utility provision as well as affordability of customer charges such that the \nGovernment may substitute part of user charges with a CSO. Government will ensure that user \ncharges  are  set  at  minimum  to  recover  operations,  maintenance,  and  management  (OMM)  of \nSWA\u2019s wastewater services. The Government will also ensure that the cost of any on-lending to \nSWA  is  either  charged  to  customers,  through  user  charges,  or  provided  by  MOF  through  a \nCSO.31  SWA  is  also  seeking  an  appropriate  return  for  providing  the  service  in  line  with \ncommercial principles and the Public Bodies Act. Further public relations and consultation work, \nparticularly  government  commitment  to  improving  and  tightening  environmental  standards,  will \nbe  undertaken,  before  the  Government  decides  on  the  allocation  between  recovery  from  user \ncharges and government funds. Since for the CBA scheme about half the revenue is from public \nbodies,  specific  consideration  of  the  impact  on  MOF  and  budgetary  allocation  will  also  be \nconsidered. \n \n\n                                                 \n29  The  Government  is  developing  a  poverty  line  with  assistance  from  of  ADB. 2001.  Consultative  Workshops  on \nPoverty  Reduction  Strategies  in  Selected  PDMCs.  Manila.  The  1997  household  income  and  expenditure  survey \nattempted to identify a basic-needs poverty line and a food poverty line, but these have not been accepted and lack \ncredibility.  \n\n30 ADB. 2002.  Priorities of the People, Hardship in Samoa. Manila includes living in areas as subject to flooding as \nhardship. This is further supported by general agreement that those who can afford to avoid living in such areas do \nso. \n\n31 CSO will not cover up or make up for any inefficiency in tariff collection.  \n\n\f16 \n\n57. \nThe proposed charging mechanism is to introduce (i) a water volume based sewerage \nsurcharge for all customers of the CBA and Special Needs Areas, and (ii) a water volume-based \nenvironmental charge for all other customers in urban Apia.32 Customers will be issued a single, \nitemized bill, and will be disconnected if the charge is not paid in full. The tariff structure for the \nenvironmental  charge  will  likely  include  a  provision  to  support  those  in  hardship,  similar  to  the \nexisting lifeline tariff for water. \n \n58. \nADB funds will be re-lent to SWA at the same terms as the ADB loan but at 5% interest. \nFor the CBA scheme, although the calculated tariffs appear high compared to the water charge, \nthey  are  not  out  of  line  given  that  currently  water  tariffs  do  not  even  cover  O&M.  Estimated \ntariffs  at  break  even  (ST4/m3)  and  at  full  cost  recovery  (ST5/m3)  are  lower  than  the  unit \noperational cost of treatment for the few businesses in Apia that treat their own wastewater to a \nsimilar standard (ST7/m3 and ST9/m3). For the individual systems the estimated environmental \ncharge for a household with average water consumption is ST11 per month at break even, and \nST14  at  full  cost  recovery.  This  represents  2.3%  of  a  low-income  household\u2019s  income  of \nST600/month.  A  low-income  household  with  very  low  water  use  would  pay  nothing.  The \nfinancial  internal  rate  of  return  was  9.7%  for  the  CBA  and  special  needs  and  6.8%  for  the \nindividual systems. Both exceeded the calculated weighted average cost of capital of 4.9%.33 \n \n59. \nSWA does not have a history of financial viability and makes a considerable loss each \nyear  in  providing  water  services.  This  is  largely  a  result  of  provision  of  water  to  rural  areas \nundertaken  as  a  social  obligation  although  not  financially  viable.  The  position  has  been \nexacerbated by (i) recent grant funded investments in rural operations, lack of counterpart funds \nfrom Government, and delays in customer connections to provide the required cost recovery for \noperations; and (ii) CSO payments for water for 2003/04 have provided only 30% of the amount \nclaimed.34 Net trade debts as of 30 June 2003 were reported at ST2 million. The current cash \nposition  of  SWA  is  poor.  SWA  has  prepared  a  5-year  financial  plan  that  aims  to  improve \nfinancial  performance  to  at  least  cover  O&M.  The  plan  shows  that  wastewater  operations  will \nhave  a  positive  impact  on  performance.  The  metering  program  has  improved  collection  rates \nand  reduced  unaccounted-for-water.  This  is  expected  to  improve  further  over  the  next  few \nyears.35 \n \nFinancial planning for the wastewater component is designed to ensure that its financial \n60. \nimpact  on  the  SWA  is  positive.  Two  aspects  of  the  Project  will  also  help  improve  SWA\u2019s \nfinancial  performance:  (i)  assistance  in  financial  planning and management and an assurance \nthat  CSOs  for  water  as  well  as  wastewater  are  tightly  defined  and  transparent,  and  (ii) \nimprovements to the billing and database system. The extent to which SWA becomes financially \nviable depends on CSO payment for water more than any other factor. \n \nE. \n\nEconomic Aspects \n\n61. \nThe  Project  will  be  the  first  major  physical  infrastructure  project  following  PUMA\u2019s \nestablishment  and  is  an  important  step  in  the  process  to  establish  a  fully  functioning  urban \nmanagement  system.  Direct  and  indirect  benefits  will  accrue  to  the  economy  of  Apia  and, \ntherefore,  as  the  capital  of  Samoa,  to  Samoa  as  a  whole.  Direct  economic  impacts  include \nsavings from the cleanup of unsanitary floodwater; and from reduced traffic disruptions, damage \n\n                                                 \n32 Special arrangements will be made for residents with private water supply. \n33 Government equity was calculated at 7.9% based on the current 12-month bond. \n34 About 30% of the claim was for lost revenue from the planned tariff restructuring for commercial customers. This \n\n35 Unaccounted-for water was reduced from 72% in 2001 to 44% in 2002. Billing collection rates have improved from \n\nwas not introduced. \n\n52% in 2001 to 80% in 2002. \n\n\f17 \n\nleast-cost  solutions,  appropriate \n\nto  property  and  resources,  expenditure  on  environment-related diseases and epidemics, and \nloss  of  economic  activity.  Indirect  benefits  include  improved  investment  and  business \nopportunities,  including  general  commerce,  tourism,  and  aquaculture  resulting  from a cleaner, \nmore  attractive  urban  environment,  and  improvements  to  productivity  from  a  healthier \nworkforce.  The  planning,  legislative,  and  institutional  strengthening  components  will  improve \ncoordination, prioritization, and chances of success of future projects, thus promoting long-term \nsustainable economic growth. \n \n62. \nThe Project has been selected based on identified needs and priorities: government and \ntechnology,  and  ease  of \nbeneficiary  affordability, \nimplementation.  Alternative  solutions  were  considered  to  determine  geographical  coverage  of \nthe  reticulated  system  and  each  special  needs  areas.  For  urban  areas  outside  the  CBA, \ndevelopment  of  a  reticulated  system  remains  the  long-term  goal  but  is  not  affordable  now. \nUpgrading the systems of the most vulnerable households and proper O&M of existing systems \nwas considered affordable while recognizing the benefits of improved environmental standards. \n \n63. \nAn  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  was  calculated  for  the  Project  as  a  whole, \ngiven the integrated nature of drainage and wastewater. Economic costs included physical and \nnonphysical project components. Valued benefits included (i) estimated repair cost savings from \nflood damage, (ii) estimated labor  cleanup cost of flood damage, (iii) resource cost savings on \nminimal  individual  sanitation  systems  as  in  current  practice,  and  (iv)  willingness  to  pay  for \nwastewater  management.  The  base  case  EIRR  of  12.4%  exceeded  the  economic  opportunity \ncost  of  capital,  which  is  assumed  to  be  10%  Under  sensitivity  tests,  even  under  the  most \nadverse scenarios, the Project was found to be economically viable or so close to be marginal. \nThe EIRR is likely to underestimate the true value of the Project, largely because many  of the \nidentified benefits are excluded from the EIRR calculation.  \n \nF. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects \n\nAn initial environmental examination (IEE) for the Project was completed under TA36 and \n64. \nhas  confirmed  its  classification  as  category  B.  The  Project\u2019s  overall environmental effects are \npositive. The Project will (i) improve surface and groundwater quality, including marine waters, \nby reducing untreated and partially treated sewage discharges to the environment; (ii) improve \npublic  health  by  reducing  sewage  and  decreasing  flooding;  and  (iii)  reduce  solid  waste  to  the \nurban streams and marine waters by improving drainage system management. \n \nSeveral  alternatives  for  wastewater  management,  including  treatment  and  disposal \n65. \noptions  and  alternative  sites  for  the  facilities,  were  reviewed.  The  combination  of  individual \nsystem improvement, and the selected option for the limited reticulated system with secondary \nbiological treatment, disinfection, and land disposal of effluent at an environmentally appropriate \nsite represents the most cost-effective  and  environmentally  appropriate  solution.  It  will  protect \nthe surface and groundwater of urban Apia. \n \n66. \nPotential  impacts  during  construction  are  those  typically  expected  for  any  construction \nactivity,  including  erosion  and  sedimentation,  traffic  disruption,  and  noise.  These  will  be \nmitigated by standard engineering practices and proper construction methods. Typical mitigation \nmeasures  include  dry-season  construction,  placement  of  erosion  control  material,  use  of  silt \nfences, and limitation of construction work hours. Operational concerns such as odor control are \nmitigated by appropriate siting, selection of minimal-odor technologies, odor-control measures, \nand capacity-building programs to support proper operations and maintenance.

The EMP will be refined during the detailed design phase. The SIEE is included as a \nsupplementary appendix. Appendix 11 includes a project environmental analysis.  \n \nG. \n \nProject  risks  center  on  (i)  continued  commitment  to  improved  urban  management,  (ii) \n68. \nbusiness  community  participation \nthe \neffectiveness and sustainability of capacity-building measures. The Government\u2019s commitment \nto \nthe \nestablishment  of  PUMA,  promulgation  of  Planning  and  Urban  Management  Bill,  and  efforts  to \ndevelop this Project. Business community support and participation have been fostered through \ndialogue with the business community during project development, continuing pre-loan dialogue \non  tariff  needs  and  private  sector  participation  in  the  provision  of  wastewater  services.37 To \nenhance  effectiveness  and  sustainability  of  the  capacity-building  measures,  the  capacity \nbuilding  consultancies  emphasize  a  high  level  of  interaction  with  Government  and  SWA  staff \nduring  the  entire  Project.  The  establishment  and  funding  of  a  twinning  arrangement  for  SWA \nwith  a  well-established  utility  promotes  long-term  capacity  building.  Financial  risks  include  (i) \ninadequate  cost  recovery  resulting \nin  greater-than-anticipated  government  subsidy  of \nwastewater  management  operations,  and  (ii)  inadequate  financing  of  SWA  water  supply \noperations.  However,  the  Government  and  SWA  have  demonstrated  their  commitment  to \nimprove cost recovery through recent water tariff increases, enactment of the public bodies bill \nto promote sustainable commercial operations for public enterprises, and review of the Project\u2019s \ncost recovery issues. The Project emphasizes the importance of building community and other \nstakeholder  awareness  and  commitment  to  the  Project,  as  well  as  building  SWA  and \ngovernment responsiveness to the community\u2019s needs and views. Land acquisition risks, which \nonly  affect  portions  of  the  drainage  component,  are  minimal  due  to  limited  land  acquisition \nrequirements. \n \n\nthrough \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n69. \nassurances, which are incorporated into the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\nBy  30  August  2004  the  Government  will  establish  a  SWA  division dedicated to \nwastewater management and sanitation services with adequate staffing. SWA\u2019s \ncorporate plan will be updated to reflect the role of the wastewater division. The \nGovernment  will  further  ensure  the  appointment  of  a  qualified  full-time Project \nManager satisfactory to ADB for the PMU by 30 July 2004, and such position will \nbe retained at least until the completion of project construction activities. \n\n \n \n\n                                                 \n37  This  pre-loan  assistance  has  been  supported  through  the  Water  Cooperation  Fund,  pilot  demonstration  activity \n\nprogram, and TA (footnote 3). \n\n\f(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n19 \n\nThe Government will ensure that throughout project implementation, no material \norganizational changes (either financial, operational or structural) to, or material \nasset transfers to or from SWA, will be made without the prior approval of ADB, if \nsuch changes would affect the ability of the Government or SWA to perform their \nvarious obligations under the Project Agreement and re-lending agreement.  \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  counterpart  financing  necessary  for  the \nProject  is  provided  and  disbursed  in  a  timely  manner  to  enable  completion  of \nproject activities, and that additional counterpart funding will be provided for any \nshortfall in funds or cost overruns. \n\nthat  an  appropriate  wastewater \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure \ntariff  and \nenvironmental  fee  will  be  endorsed  by  the  Cabinet  by  30  December  2005,  and \nimplemented on commissioning of the project facilities such that (a) wastewater \ntariff revenues and environmental fees cover at minimum the cost of OMM; (b) no \nentity,  whether  any  government  agency,  institution,  or  enterprise,  regardless  of \nownership,  will  be  granted  an  exemption  from  the  wastewater  tariff  and \nenvironmental  fees  established  pursuant  to  the  above,  or  granted  a  preferential \nrate, or excused for delays in payments without penalties; and (c) the impact of \nany user charges on the poor is reviewed and appropriate measures introduced \nto protect the basic living standards of the poor. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  (a)  provision  of  CSOs  by  SWA  for  water  and \nwastewater  services  is  annually  approved  in  accordance  with  procedures \nestablished  under  the  Public  Bodies  Act;  and  (b)  sufficient  budget  funds  are \nallocated and disbursed in a timely manner to finance the difference between the \nestablished  tariffs  and  full  cost  recovery  tariff  that  includes  an  agreed  rate  of \nreturn in accordance with agreements between MOF and SWA that will set forth \nthe  (a)  form  and  detail  of  the  CSO  application,  and  (b)  financial  and  SWA \noperational and management performance requirements. \n\nThe  Government  will  develop  an  appropriate  act(s)  concerning  wastewater \nmanagement by 31 December 2005, that (a) clearly defines institutional roles for \nwastewater  management  and  sanitation;  (b)  establishes  requirement  and \nprocedures  for  development  of  regulations,  guidelines,  and  standards  for \nwastewater management, including industrial and trade waste discharges to the \nwastewater  system  (including  pretreatment  standards),  and  the  environment, \nWWTP  effluent  standards,  and  ambient  water  quality  standards;  (c)  requires \nconnection  to  a  centralized  system  where  one  exists;  and  (d)  provides  for \nindependent monitoring of utility service providers. These regulations, guidelines, \nand  standards  shall  be  issued  by  31  December  2006  and  implemented  by  30 \nSeptember  2007.  The  Government  will  revise  existing  Building  and  Planning \nStandards, with consideration of the TA recommendations, to ensure compliance \nwith the Planning and Urban Management Bill by 30 June 2005. \n\n(vii) \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  MWTI  will  implement  a  comprehensive \ndrainage  O&M  program  through  contracting  of  the  private  sector,  community \ngroups, and involvement of appropriate stakeholders by 31 July 2005. \n\n(viii)  The  Government  and  SWA  will  ensure \n\nthat  all  applicable  government \nenvironmental  laws,  regulations,  and  standards,  and  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  and \nprocedures, in particular ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines 2003, are \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nB. \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\nadhered  to  throughout  project  implementation  and  that  all  environmental \nmonitoring  and  mitigation  measures  identified  in  the  SIEE,  the  EMP,  and  the \ngovernment\u2019s  environment  assessment  process  are  fully  implemented.  The \nGovernment and SWA will further ensure that environmental mitigation measures \nare  incorporated  into  design  and  bidding  documents.  The  Government  will \nmonitor and record EMP implementation under the guidance and supervision of \nPUMA  and  will  include  monitoring  information  in  project  progress  reports \nsubmitted to ADB. \n\nThe Government will develop a land access and land acquisition plan for future \ndrainage,  wastewater,  and  sanitation  works.  The  plan  will  identify  priority  areas \nand processes for access and acquisition and provide for reservation of sufficient \nland  at  the  WWTP  site  for  future  expansion  and  a  reasonable  buffer  zone  in \naccordance with other relevant government laws by 30 June 2006. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  all  land  and  rights  of  way  required  by  the \nProject will be made available in a  timely manner, i.e., before civil works on the \naffected  property,  and  that  the  provisions  of  the  SRP,  including  compensation \nand  entitlements  for  APs,  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  all  applicable \nlaws  and  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  on  Resettlement,  Guide  to  Good \nPractice.  The  Government  will  ensure  timely  provision  of  sufficient  counterpart \nfunds for land acquisition and resettlement activities and meet any obligations in \nexcess  of  the  SRP  budget  estimate  and  ensure  that  the  APs  will  be  at  least as \nwell-off  as  they  would  have  been  in  the  absence  of  the  Project.  Adequate  staff \nand  resources  will  be  committed  to  supervision  and  internal  monitoring  of  the \nimplementation of the SRP. The SRP will be updated as necessary to reflect any \nsignificant  material  changes  of  the  Project  scope,  and  such  changes  will  be \nsubject to ADB approval. \n\nCondition for Loan Effectiveness \n\nAs a condition for loan effectiveness, the Government agrees that the Government and \n\n70. \nSWA shall have  entered into an re-lending agreement in a form satisfactory to ADB. \n \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n71. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  5,604,000  to  the  Independent  State  of  Samoa  for  the  Sanitation  and \nDrainage  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a \ngrace period of 8 years, an interest charge at the rate of 1% per annum during the grace period, \nand  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;

This  analysis  summarizes  the  current \nstatus  of  the  subsectors,  including    (i)  relevance  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Water \nPolicy and country strategy, (ii) indicators such as environmental quality and access to sanitation, \nand (iii) institutional framework. Lessons learned and the need for the Project are also presented. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nSamoa is a small archipelago consisting of two main islands\u2014Upolu and Savai\u2019i\u2014and five \nsmaller  islands,  with  a  total  area  of  2,820  square  kilometers.  In  2001  the  population1  was \n176,848, with natural increase of about 1% per annum. However, with significant emigration, net \npopulation  growth  is  estimated  at  0.5%  as  it  has  been  for  the  last  30  years.  Some  98%  of  the \npopulation  lives  on  the  coastal  plains  in  small  villages,  including  in  and  around  urban  Apia,  the \ncapital,  on  Upolu.  Approximately  60,872  people  or  34.4%  of  the  population  lived  in  Apia  while \n52% lived in northwest Upolu, including Apia and the undulating foothills stretching 30 kilometers \n(km) to the northwest. Much of development is between these foothills and the coastline. \n \nC. \n \n3. \nADB's Water Policy calls for support of integrated water resource management (IWRM), \nimproved  and expanded delivery of water services, foster cooperation and awareness, promote \nregional  cooperation,  facilitate  the  exchange  information,  and  improve  governance.  It  further \nemphasizes  the  need  for  autonomous  management  of  water  utilities,  cost  recovery,  and private \nsector participation while ensuring access and equitable service to the poor and vulnerable. \n \n4. \nThe  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update  (CSPU)  for  2004-2006  for  Samoa  aims  to \nimprove  the  enabling  environment  for  accelerated  private  sector  growth  and  employment \ngeneration  through  enhancing  the  policy  and  institutional  framework  for  private  sector \ndevelopment,  supporting  sound  macroeconomic  and  financial  policies  and  management,  and \nfacilitating  public-private  partnerships  and  privatization  of  state-owned enterprises. Second, the \nstrategy  aims  to  improve  access  to  basic  public  services.  Third,  ADB  will  continue  to  help  the \nGovernment  improve  living  standards  and  reduce  income  disparity.  The  strategy  reflects  the \ncommon  aspirations  of  vulnerable  and  disadvantaged  communities,  as  expressed  in  ADB\u2019s \nparticipatory poverty surveys: 2 employment, access to basic services, and education. \n \n5. \nThe Project supports ADB\u2019s strategy for Samoa and  ADB\u2019s Water Policy by (i) fostering \ngood  water  and  environment  governance,  (ii)  improving  living  conditions,  and  (iii)  promoting \nprivate  sector  growth  and  generating  employment  opportunities \nthrough  private  sector \nparticipation  in  wastewater  service  provision  and  improving  environmental  infrastructure.  The \nwater policy is supported through (i) emphasis on IWRM, that is promoted through the capacity-\nbuilding  efforts  for  PUMA;  and  (ii)  regional  cooperation  and  exchange  of  information  through  a \ntwinning arrangement with an established wastewater utility. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Extracted from the 2001 National Population and Household Census for Samoa. \n2   ADB. 2001.

The  Strategy  for  the  Economic  Development  of  Samoa  2002-20043  continues \ngovernment emphasis on macroeconomic stability; public sector efficiency and reform; improved \neducation and health standards; and better urban planning and management, including provision \nof infrastructure, and a strong private sector.  \n \n7. \nSamoa\u2019s  stable  political  environment,  combined  with  vigorous  economic  growth  and \nits \ninclusive  social  development  strategies,  has  contributed \ndevelopment  goals.  With  a  Human  Development  Index  of  0.590.  Samoa  rates  well  on  the \nachievement of social development goals. Adult literacy rates for both genders (96%) and gross \nenrolment  rates  in  primary  (94%)  and  secondary  (70%)  levels  are  high  by  Pacific  developing \nmember country standards. Infant mortality (22 per 1,000 births), under-5 mortality (35 per 1,000 \nbirths), and maternal mortality (4 per 100,000 births) rate amongst the three lowest in the Pacific \nregion. Some 90% of the population has access to potable water. Concern for the environment is \nstrong.  New  legislation,  Planning  and  Urban  Management  BiIl  (PUMA  Bill)  deals  with  the \nbiophysical, social, and economic environments. Drafted in 2002, it is expected to be enacted in \nDecember  2003.4  Real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  was  6.5%  in  2001  and  6.9%  in  2000. \nStrong economic growth has been attributed to development of commerce, public administration, \nhotels,  and  restaurants,  transportation,  communications,  construction,  and  fisheries.  Economic \nactivities and government offices are concentrated in Apia, particularly the central business area \n(CBA).  \n \nThe 2001 census data indicate that 88% of the population has access to safe sanitation, \n8. \nand World Bank data for 2002 indicate that 95% of the urban population has improved facilities.5 \nThis access to sanitation data misrepresents the public health implications of the sanitation status \nof  many  living  in  the  urban  areas.  In  urban  Apia,  for  example,  about  75%  of  households  have \nseptic  systems,  but  many  are  too  small,  rarely  cleaned,  and  sometimes  directly  linked  to  the \nnearest  drainage  channel,  polluting  groundwater,  surface  streams,  and  the  harbor.  In  the  CBA \nand special needs areas (those with special wastewater concerns) such as hospitals and major \nschool compounds, less than 10% of wastewater is adequately treated. The hospital has a poorly \noperating  treatment  plant,  as  do  most  commercial  centers  and  government  complexes.  Others \nhave  inadequate  septic  systems.  The  situation  is  exacerbated  by  the  historical  lack  of  urban \nmanagement,  including  the  absence  of  drainage  or  wastewater  management  plans  and  the \nabsence of effective town planning. Individuals have elevated their plots heights, reclaimed land \nin the mangrove area, and blocked drainage channels. The effect is a haphazard and cumulative \nnonfunctioning drainage system. Flooding after heavy rain is intensified, and foul water flooding \nposes a health risk due to septage and latrine wastes being released to the surface environment. \nThe Health Sector Strategic Plan specifically identifies environmental health issues, including the \nlack  of  a  public  sewerage  system  and  drainage  problems,  as  affecting  public  health.  The  plan \nlinks  recent  outbreaks  of  dengue,  incidence  of  diarrhea,  respiratory  and  skin  diseases  with  the \nneed for more intensive environmental health control.6  \n \n\n                                                 \n3   Government of Samoa. 2002.

Water  quality-\nmonitoring  data,  which  have  been  only  intermittently  collected,  show  definitive  evidence  of \nsewage  contamination  as  evidenced  by  low  dissolved  oxygen  saturation,  high  biochemical \noxygen  demand  (BOD),  high \nindicator  bacteria \nconcentration.7 Urban drains are often choked with litter and vegetation, foul smelling (indicating \nanaerobic conditions), and contain floating oil and sewage. Drains and natural watercourses are \ncontaminated  with  sewage  and,  occasionally,  industrial  waste.  Monitoring  is  done  infrequently \nand  usually  result  from  donor-funded  activities,  including  previous  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)-supported TA. 8 Samoa has no legislative framework for environmental standards. \n \n10. \nThe  Apia  Drainage  Scheme,  completed  in  1993,  was  based  on  fieldwork  carried  out \nduring 1979. Substantial growth and changes to land use and urban growth, which greatly affect \nrunoff and drainage characteristics, occurred after the fieldwork. Much of Apia is built on low-lying \nflood  prone  land,  parts  of  which  were  mangroves  prior  to  land  reclamation  and  development. \nFilling is most prominent in the natural floodplain area of Vaiusu Bay adjoining the CBA, with such \nactivities continuing to change storm water runoff patterns, groundwater and flood flow patterns. \nThe  continuing  lack  of  urban  planning  including  lack  of  land  use  controls  and  guidelines,  land \nfilling, encroachment into waterways and lack of drainage maintenance, continue to contribute to \nthe incidence of flooding and impact on property and health.  \n \n11. \nDetailed historical data on the frequency and extent of flooding are not available. A recent \nSouth Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC) study9 records a long history of flooding \nin  Apia.  Severe  floods  were  reported  in  1939,  1975,  2001,  and  May  2003.  Less  severe  floods \noccur more frequently; moderately severe flooding was reported in 1982, 1991, and 2000. Minor \nlocalized  flooding  is  more  frequent.  The  2001  flood  was  particularly  severe,  estimated to have \ndamaged  some  1,300  buildings.  Residential  and  commercial  properties  were  flooded,  some \nthigh-deep, leaving a layer of mud when the water abated. In the low-lying areas, residents were \nforced to evacuate to higher ground. Stock and equipment were damaged and many businesses \nand schools were forced to close to clear up damage for up to several days. Traffic congestion \nand road damage from the mud and debris were severe, particularly near Fugalei Market. More \nthan  28,000  people  were  affected  by  water  cuts  resulting  from  damage  to  water  supply \ninfrastructure. Some businesses not directly affected by the flood were forced to close because of \nthe water supply cut. The estimated repair bill exceeded ST11 million (2001 prices).10 \n \n12. \nPrevious  proposals  for  sanitation  in  Apia  in  the  mid-1980s  to  late  1990\u2019s  all  advocated \nlarge-scale  sanitation  systems  based  on  a  reticulated  system  serving  a  minimum  10,000 \npopulation.11 These schemes were physically extensive, covering the CBA area, low-lying areas \nand  floodplains,  and  industrial  estates  some  6  kilometers  to  the  northwest.  By  the  end  of  the \n1990s, the promotion of such blanket schemes for sanitation failed to win government and other \nstakeholder  support.  Large  scale  schemes  were  not  considered  appropriate  to  the  Samoan \nsituation  because:  (ii)  the  high  cost  of  such  schemes,  (iii)  little  institutional  capacity  and \n\n                                                 \n7   For example, fecal coliform levels in Vaiusu Bay have been measured at over 5,700 organisms per 100 milliliter (ml), \nwhile  the  United  States  standard  for  shellfish  gathering  is  14  organisms  per  100  ml.

Manila. \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nInstitutional Framework: Laws, Policies, and Government Agencies \n\ncommitment  to  implement,  operate  and  maintain  a  large  scale  sewerage  scheme  (iv)  priority  of \nimproving  the  Apia  water  scheme  and  implementing  water  tariffs  (v)  disposal  to  sea  by  ocean \noutfall  was  seen  by  many  as  resulting  in  adverse  impacts  on  the  marine  ecology  and  image  of \nSamoa,  and  (vi)  the  proposed  sewage  treatments  plant  sites  in  northwest  Apia  were  not \nconsidered  appropriate.  Given  this  background,  the  emphasis  of  Government  since  2000  has \nbeen to review options that address these stakeholder issues and concerns.12 This has included \na  focus  on  incremental  sewerage  system  development  and  integrated  solutions  that  meet  the \ntechnical  and  affordability  needs  of  the  varying  user  groups  while  concurrently  developing  the \nplanning and urban management framework.  \n \nE. \n \n13. \nThe  Government  throughout  the  last  decade  has  been  increasingly  concerned  with  the \nimpact  that  rapid  population  and  development  pressures  are  having  on:  (i)  inadequate  urban \ninfrastructure provision to cope with the rising expanding urban population, (ii) the absence of an \nagreed  framework  and  coordinated  approach  for  urban  management  and  planning,  including \nunclear  institutional  arrangements,  and  (iii)  the  need  for  resolution  of  land  issues  in  the  urban \narea  (land  supply,  land  tenure  and  land  availability)  to  meet  the  timely  demand  for  housing, \ninfrastructure development and urban expansion. Its reform agenda includes institutional reform, \nto reduce the scope of government activity through rationalization, corporatization and contracting \nout  of  some  services.  The  dramatic  downsizing  of  the  Ministry  of  Works  Transport  and \nInfrastructure  (MWTI)  and  outsourcing  of  many  of  their  traditional  functions  is  an  example  of \nthis.13 The Strategy for the Economic Development of Samoa 2002-04 continues the emphasis on \nmacro-economic  stability  and  sustainable  growth,  supported  by  further  efficiency  improvements \nand  also  a  focus  on  social  and  environmental  aspects  to  support  the  policy  program.  Public \nhealth,  environmental  quality,  and  better  urban  planning  are  all  incorporated  into  the  Strategy. \nSimilarly,  the  focus  on  sustainability,  (of  planning,  development,  natural  resources,  waste  and \npollution  control)  and  their  appropriateness  for  Samoa  are  emphasized  in  the  Tourism \nDevelopment Plan 2002-2006. \n \n14. \nGovernment  efforts  toward  more  efficient  provision  of  water  supply  services  on  a \ncommercial  basis  were  initiated  through  the  creation  of  the  Samoa  Water  Authority  through  the \nWater Authority Act in 1993. Presently, the government is committed to the principle of full cost \nrecovery  and  autonomy  of  SWA  and  other  Government  utility  corporations  as  expressed  in  the \nrecent Public Bodies Act; however it recognizes that full cost recovery from user charges is not \nfeasible  now  due  to  broader  environmental,  economic,  and  social  objectives.  It  thus  supports \npublic utilities through Community Service Obligations (CSO) for services that contribute to these \nbroader objectives. SWA currently provides no wastewater or sanitation services and thus has no \nspecific  capacity  in  this  area,  though  it  does  have  reasonable  water  supply  services  capacity. \nConsequently,  the  Project  includes  a  substantial  capacity  building  component.14  Urban \ninfrastructure  and  services  have  traditionally  been  provided  by  national  government  agencies \nsuch  as  the  Department  of  Lands,  Survey  and  Environment  (DLSE),  MWTI  and  the  Ministry  of \nInternal  Affairs  (MIA).  The  social,  cultural  and  administrative  aspects  of  traditional  village  life  in \nApia  come  under  the  legally  established  village  councils  of  which  the  MIA  has  administrative \nresponsibility.15  These  agencies  planned  and  provided  for  infrastructure  requirements  and \n\n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2000.

Nevertheless, there \nIs  continued  capacity  building  of  SWA,  PUMA,  and  MWTI  and  reforms  to  further  foster  the \nGovernment\u2019s  reform  of  state-owned  enterprises  (SOE),  particularly  the  SWA  in  the  areas  of \nfinancial  management  and  autonomy.  Specifically,  there  is  a  need  to  foster  the  Government\u2019s \nexpressed  goal  of  improving  transparency  of  the  CSO,  overall  financial  autonomy,  and  general \ngovernance  of  public  utilities  by  addressing  these  issues  for  SWA  under  the  capacity-building \ncomponent  of  the  loan.  Project  management  capacity  building  will  foster  the  MWTI  strategy  to \noutsource works to the private sector. PUMA is a young agency with substantial responsibilities. \nAssistance  in  developing  subsector  management  plans,  regulations,  and  guidance  documents \nare key capacity building  needs. Targeted assistance to Ministry of Health (MOH) and Ministry of \nAgriculture (MOA) will help provide needed monitoring data. \n \nG. \n \n16. \nADB and other donors have studied the urban infrastructure situation  in Samoa over the \nlast  20  years.  Wastewater  management,  drainage,  and  sanitation  infrastructure  and  urban \nmanagement recommendations have received no or lukewarm support for the reasons described \nabove.  Lessons  learned  are:  (i)  process  involving  consultation  and  dialogue  amongst \nstakeholders  is  important  achieving  project  support;  (ii)  large  scale  reticulated  solutions  are  not \nappropriate  now  for  a  number  of  reasons,  including  affordability  (Government  and  consumers), \ninstitutional capacity, and technical capacity; (iii) land tenure matters are an integral part of project \ndesign and implementation; (iv) ocean discharge of effluent requires a high level of treatment and \nlong  outfall  pipes  to  meet  marine  environmental  concerns;  and,  (v)  sanitation  and  wastewater \nmanagement infrastructure improvements need to be undertaken in the context of broader urban \nmanagement  planning.  Solutions  need  to  be  locally  driven  and  respect  the  local  situation, \nincluding understanding of why previous schemes have not won broad stakeholder support. The \nProject  addresses  these  lessons  learned  by  including  multi-faceted  solutions.  It  is  an \nappropriately scaled incremental approach with capacity building components that acknowledge \naffordability  levels  and  institutional  and  technical  capacity  while  incorporating  expandability  and \nflexibility for future improvements.  \n \nH. \n \n17. \nRehabilitation  and  improvement  to  drainage  and  floodways  to  mitigate  flooding  that \nregularly occurs in the CBA  and  low-lying  areas  is  urgently  needed.  Wastewater  and  sanitation \nimprovements  are  needed  to  meet  basic  human  requirements  for  domestic  households  and \nmitigate  the  impacts  of  inadequate  wastewater  facilities  in  the  CBA  and  other  identified  priority \nneeds  areas.  These  are  important  steps  to  establish  a  fully  functioning  urban  management \nsystem.  Besides  the  benefits  of  physical  development,  the  Project  also  includes  appropriate \nplanning, legislative, and institutional strengthening to support both the successful implementation \nof this Project and increase the likelihood of future projects.  \n\nNeed for the Project \n\n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2000.

Manila. \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nINSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS  \n \n\nSamoa Water Authority \n\nIntroduction and Scope \n\nA. \n \n1. \nThe institutional analysis covers the three agencies significantly affected by the  Project: \nMinistry  of  Works  Transport  and  Infrastructure  (MWTI),  Samoa  Water  Authority  (SWA),  and \nPlanning and Urban Management Agency (PUMA). The Ministy of Health (MOH) and Ministry of \nAgriculture  (MOA)  have  new  monitoring  responsibilities,  and  the  Project  addresses  their \ncapacity  requirements.  The  analysis  includes  input  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  projects,1  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development \n(AusAID)  Institutional  Strengthening  Project,  various  missions  leading  to  the  loan,  and  source \ndocuments  and  reports  from  agencies  concerned;  and  describes  the  agencies\u2019  present \ncapabilities and assesses them against their current mission and the proposed project impacts. \nThe  analytical  framework  covered  the  institutional  dimensions  relevant  to  the  successful \nimplementation of the Project, including corporate management and governance, financial and \nhuman resource capabilities, performance and results management, customer and community \nrelations management, and capacity to change. This appendix summarizes the full analysis. \n \nB. \n \nGovernment  efforts  toward  more  efficient  provision  of  water  supply  services  on  a \n2. \ncommercial basis were initiated through the creation of the SWA in 1994. Although it does have \nreasonable water supply services capacity, SWA provides no wastewater or sanitation services \nand thus has no specific capacity in this area. \n \n3. \nThe  Government  is  committed  to  the  principle  of  full  cost  recovery  and  autonomy  of \nSWA  and  other  government  corporations,2 while recognizing that full cost recovery from user \ncharges is not feasible now due to environmental, economic, and social objectives. It supports \npublic utilities through Community Service Obligations (CSO), for services contributing to these \nobjectives. Although SWA has not been financially independent, upcoming tariff increases aim \nto improve financial performance to at least cover operation and maintenance. The Government \nis committed to making CSOs more transparent, conditional, and allocated to specific activities, \nrather than simple budget funding, and this should improve SWA\u2019s finances. The Project will not \nenable  SWA  to  become  financially  independent,  but  the  Government\u2019s  clear  intention  is  to \nensure  that  for  wastewater,  CSOs  and  user  charges  at  minimum  cover  operations, \nmaintenance,  and  management  (OMM),  and  debt  service  and  to  this  extent,  the  wastewater \noperations  of  SWA  will  be  financially  sustainable.  Better  billing  and  collection  will  improve  the \nfinancial  situation  of  SWA\u2019s  water  operations.  Loan  assurances  require  appropriate  CSOs  for \nwater and wastewater services. \n \nCurrent  performance  challenges  include  reducing  the  high  levels  of  unaccounted-for \n4. \nwater,  billing  and  collection,  and  metering.  SWA  has  improved  the  level  of  unaccounted-for \nwater from 72% in 2001, and aims to further reduce it from 44% in 2002 to 30% within 5 years. \nBilling and collection rates are improving, with a revenue recovery rate of approximately 80% in \n2002 from 52% in 2001. The gap is due to nonpayment and non-billing. Metered customers now \nnumber  over  6,000  or  33%  of  total  customers.  Water  quality  varies  according  to  water  source \nbut  meets  locally  set  standards,  and  70%  of  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  standards. \nCustomers and community perception is mixed with some reluctance to acknowledge the cost \nof  water  and  the  \u201duser  pays\u201d  principle.  Lessons  from  the  European  Union  Rural  Water  Supply \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2000.  Capacity Building for Urban Planning and Management. Manila; and ADB. 2002. Implementation of the \n\nUrban Planning and Management Strategy. Manila. \n\n2   As expressed in the Public Bodies Act. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix  5 \n\n33 \n\nMinistry of Works Transport and Infrastructure \n\nProject  warn  against  extensive  capital  investment  without  corresponding  expansion  of  service \ndelivery and associated revenue collection. SWA lacks contract management capabilities due to \nminimal experience with outsourcing. \n \n5. \nSWA  has  a  corporate  management  framework  in  place,  with  corporate  and  business \nplans  focused  on  results.  Its  customer  management  focus  and  community  education  could  be \nimproved.  The  SWA  Board  is  required  to  have  50%  of  its  directors  from  outside  the \nGovernment. \n \nTo  address  the  capacity  shortfalls,  the  Project  includes  a  substantial  capacity-building \n6. \ncomponent  focusing  on  technical  and  management  areas,  in  particular  in  asset  and  financial \nmanagement,  contract  management,  customer  management,  billing  and  collection,  and \nwastewater  management  and  sanitation  operations  and  monitoring.  Capacity  will  be  built \nthrough  structured  training,  development  of  systems  and  procedures,  and  establishment  of  a \ntwinning arrangement with an established water authority. \n \nC. \n \n7. \nMWTI  has  been  dramatically  downsized  through  the  Government\u2019s  institutional  reform \nprogram  and  now  acts  as  a  coordinating  and  project  management  agency  for  a  range  of \ninfrastructure  projects.  Its  key  need  is  stronger  project  management,  contracting  and  contract \nsupervision, and performance monitoring. In the technical area MWTI requires strengthening in \nhydraulic  model  use  and  drainage  maintenance.  The  capacity-building  program  will  address \nthese  needs  by  establishing  programs  for  drainage  maintenance  and  performance  monitoring, \ndeveloping  procurement  and  tendering  procedures,  and  using  hydraulic  modeling  and \nstructured training. \n \nD. \n \n8. \nPUMA  was  established  in  2002  after  an  ADB-assisted  government  study  to  develop  a \nmore  effective  planning  and  urban  management  strategy.3  This  effort  involved  extensive \nstakeholder consultations, which revealed an urgent need for an integrated approach to urban \nplanning  and  development.  Further  assistance4  is  being  provided  to  help  PUMA  achieve  its \nambitious urban planning and management mission. \n \n9. \nAs  a  new  and  inexperienced  agency,  PUMA  requires  support  in  project  management \nand  procurement.  Other  shortfalls  in  capacity  relate  to  its  new  responsibilities  in  drainage  and \nwastewater  management.  The  Project  will  support  PUMA  by  developing  water  and \nenvironmental  quality  monitoring  programs  and  revising  environmental  impact  assessment \nguidelines  and  regulations.  The  associated  TA  will  help  PUMA  by  strengthening  the  policy, \nprocedural,  and  legislative  bases  for  water  and  sanitation.  The  TA  will  develop  drainage  and \nwastewater  plans;  prepare  draft  legislation  including  for  environmental  monitoring;  develop \nbuilding  codes  and  regulatory  procedures;  implement  a  geographic  information  system;  and \nprovide training. \n \nE. \n \n10.  MOH and MOA will receive support from monitoring programs, laboratory upgrades, and \ntraining to enable them to undertake their new responsibilities. \n \n                                                 \n3 ADB. 2000.

The  Executing  Agency  (EA),  Ministry  of  Finance  (Treasury  Department  or \nTreasury)  will  fund  the  Government\u2019s  20%,  including  $500,000  in  land  contribution  and  $1.5 \nmillion in cash or in kind covering the cost of private land,  staff, office space, and other costs. \nThis  amount  can  be  reduced  if  land  swaps  or  other  alternative  payments  can  be  made  to \nlandowners.  Committed  counterpart  funding  contributions  over  fiscal  years  (FY)  2005  to  2009 \ntotal  $2.0  million  (ST6.1  million)  and  are  mainly  incurred  in  the  first  3  years.  Although \ngovernment  funds  are  severely  restricted,  the  proposed  counterpart  funding  does  not  appear \nout  of  line.  Government  will  incorporate  counterpart  contributions  into  the  budget  for  FY2004   \nonward  to  cover  counterpart  funding  and  timely  disbursements  are  included  as  a  loan \nassurance. \n \nThe Treasury Department will be ultimately responsible for all loan repayments to ADB. \n2. \nThe ADB loan of $8.0 million will have loan repayments of $400,000 per annum (ST1.2 million) \nfrom 2012 to 2036. Total government debt in 2001 was $159 million (ST503 million). Estimates \nof  loan  repayments  for  2002-2003  were  ST18.0  million,  including  ST13.4  million  in  principal \nrepayments and ST4.6 million in interest. The additional burden of the proposed loan is in the \norder of 2%, which is considered to be affordable.  \n \nThe  Treasury  Department  will  enter  into  an  on-lending  agreement  with  SWA  for  the \n3. \nproposed physical aspects of the sanitation components (design, civil works, and materials and \nequipment)  of  about  $3.5  million.  SWA  will  be  responsible  for  repayments  to  the  Treasury \ndepartment  as  set  out  in  the  agreement.  Treasury  will  finance  the  repayments  for  drainage, \ncapacity building, and project implementation support. \n \nB. \n \n\nGovernment Institutional Reform and Implementing Agency Performance \n\n1.  Ministry of Works, Transport, and Infrastructure  \n\n \n4. \nUnder the ongoing public service reform program, the Ministry of Works, Transport and \nInfrastructure  (MWTI)  took  on  new  responsibilities  in  January  2003  and  is  undergoing \nconsiderable  reorganization  and  rationalization.  The  intention  is  that  the  original  Public  Works \nDepartment will become the Land Transport Ministry by 2004. From staff of around 500, there \nare  now  less  than  100.  Responsibilities  now  focus  on  policy  setting;  asset  management;  and \nregulation of ports, roads, bridges, seawalls, and drainage. All construction and maintenance is \ncontracted out to the private sector, in many cases to new businesses set up by employees of \nthe former Public Works Department. This change process has been supported by the World \nBank under phase 1 of the Infrastructure Asset Management Program.  \n \nThe  annual  MWTI  budget  for  FY2003  was  ST27  million,  excluding  foreign  capital \n5. \nassistance  grants  and  soft  loans.  The  operation  and  maintenance  for  the  proposed  drainage \nproject  will  be  procured  through  a  private  sector  contract,  managed  by  MWTI. The estimated \ncost of the contract is about ST75,000 and is considered affordable. Private sector contracting is \nexpected to reduce costs improve efficiency and outputs, but will require MWTI to successfully \nmanage the contract, monitor, and regulate the outputs. \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n39 \n\n2. \n\nSamoa Water Authority \n\n \n\n \n6. \nThe  Samoa  Water  Authority  (SWA)  is  an  independent  government  corporation, \nestablished in 1994. SWA is responsible for the water supply of about 80% of the population. It \nemploys 138  staff  (2003)  and  has  17,734  customers  (as  of  December  2002).  Annual  water \nproduction is about 16 million (m3) (46,000 m3 a day). Coverage in the urban area is more than \n90%. \n \nSWA is listed as a potential public trading body under the 2001 Public Bodies Act, which \n7. \ndescribes the principal objectives of public trading bodies as (i) to be as profitable and efficient \nas comparable businesses that are not owned by the state, and (ii) to meet community service \nobligations (CSOs) as directed. A CSO is defined as provision of good or service, agreement or \naction \u201con any other terms other than normal commercial terms.\u201d In this way government policy \naims to encourage efficiency in utility operations and also provide services that have  desirable \nsocial or economic outcomes through payment to said utilities for undertaking CSOs.  \n \nSWA  has  made  some  progress  over  the  past  years  in  moving  toward  financial \n8. \nindependence  and  transparency  of  operations.  However,  SWA  does  not  have  a  history  of \nfinancial viability and makes a considerable loss each year in providing water services. This is \nlargely a result of provision of water supplies to the rural areas, which is undertaken as a social \nobligation  and  is  not  financially  viable.  The  position  has  been  exacerbated  by  recent  grant \nfunded  investments  in  rural  operations,  lack  of  counterpart  funds  from  the  Government,  and \ndelays in customer connections to provide the required cost recovery for operations. Net trade \ndebtors at 30 June 2003 were reported at ST2 million. Allocated budgetary CSO payments for \nwater for 2003/04 were only 30% of the amount claimed largely because they are neither tightly \ndefined nor transparent. To date, none of the CSO payment for 2003/04 has been made and the \ncurrent cash position of SWA is extremely difficult. The situation demonstrates that the process \nof  establishing  the  level  and  effective  CSO  payments  is  not  well  developed  and  requires \nattention particularly for the CSO for rural water provision and capital works. \n \n\nTable A9.1: Samoa Water Authority, Summary Financial Indicators   \n(ST million) \n\nItem \nIncome \nExpenses  \nNet Loss from Operating Activities \nAccumulated Losses  \n \nTotal Assets  \nLoans Outstanding \nGovernment Equity Injection (including \nCSO) \n \nReturn on Capital Employed \nCurrent Assets Ratio \nCSO=community service obligation. \n\n1998\u20131999 \n4.7 \n(11.2) \n(6.5) \n(10.2) \n \n70.2 \n8.5 \n5.5 \n\n1999\u20132000 \n4.5 \n(11.0) \n(6.6) \n(16.8) \n \n68.4 \n8.5 \n4.6 \n\n2000\u20132001 \n3.7 \n(12.1) \n(8.4) \n(24.2) \n \n66.2 \n0.0 \n6.1 \n\n2001\u20132002 \n4.9 \n(11.9) \n(7.0) \n(31.2) \n \n68.5 \n0.0 \n4.9 \n\n \n(1.3) \n3.3 \n\n \n(1.4) \n3.4 \n\n \n(1.9) \n6.3 \n\n \n(1.6) \n4.8 \n\n \n \n9. \nSWA  implemented  tariff  increases  in  July  2003.  The  changes  were  largely  an \nappropriate  restructuring  of  water  charges  to  encourage  water  conservation  and  further \nreductions in unaccounted-for water. Simplification of the tariff to commercial customers was not \nimplemented  since  it  would  have  had  a  negative  impact  on  SWA  finances.  A  summary  of  key \nindicators is shown in Table A9.1 based on SWA annual reports and audited accounts. \n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nD. \n \n\nTariffs, Cost Recovery, and Project Financial Appraisal \n\n1.  Cost Recovery and Tariffs \n\n \n10. \nCost  recovery  from  user  charges  is  proposed  only  for  the  wastewater  components; \ndrainage and capacity building will be funded by the Government. In line with government policy \nfor  user  pays  systems  and  financial  independence  of  public  corporations,  full  cost  recovery  is \nthe  target  recovery  rate.  However,  government  policy  also  considers  the  social  and  economic \naspects  of  utility  provision  as  well  as  affordability  of  customer  charges  such  that  the \nGovernment may substitute part of user charges with a CSO. The Government will ensure that \nuser charges are set at minimum to recover operation, maintenance, and management (OMM) \nof the wastewater services provided by SWA. Government will also ensure that the cost of any \non-lending  to  SWA  is  either  charged  to  customers  through  user  charges  or  provided  by \nTreasury through a legally binding and transparent CSO.1 SWA is also seeking an appropriate \nreturn for providing the service in line with commercial principles. Further public relations work \nabout  the  Project,  particularly  government  commitment  to  improve  and  tighten  environmental \nstandards  will  be  undertaken,  in  conjunction  with  continuing  public  consultation  before  the \nGovernment  decides  on  the  allocation  between  recovery  from  user  charges  and  government \nfunds. As about half of the customers for the central business area (CBA) scheme (in terms of \nwater  volume)  are  public  bodies,  then  specific  consideration  of  the  impact  on  Treasury  and \nbudgetary allocation will also be considered. \n \n11. \nThe  proposed  charging  mechanism  is  to  (i)  introduce  a  water  volume-based sewerage \nsurcharge on the water bill for all customers of the CBA and Special Needs Areas (about 110 \nmainly  commercial  customers);  and  (ii)  a  water  volume  based  environmental  charge  on  the \nwater bill for all customers in urban Apia.2 Customers will be issued a single, itemized bill and \nwould  be  subject  to  disconnection  if  the  charge  is  not  paid  in  full.  Payments  made  will  reduce \nthe  wastewater  charge  first.  Under  the  Project,  an  analysis  of  combining  electricity  water  and \nwastewater  charges  will  be  undertaken.  The  eventual  tariff  structure  for  the  environmental \ncharge will likely include a provision to support those in hardship, similar to the existing lifeline \ntariff  for  water.  However,  unlike  water  the  \u2018free  allocation\u201d  will  likely  be  cross-subsidized by \nhigher water users through the tariff rather than paid for as a CSO.3  \n \n12. \nADB funds will be on-lent to SWA in the local currency tala (ST), at the same terms as \nthe  ADB  loan  (32  years  and  an  8-year  grace  period)  but  at  5%  interest  to  cover  the  foreign \nexchange risk. Tables A9.2 and A9.3 show the tariff, average user charges, and CSO payment \nimplications of three pricing options.4 CSO payments are calculated in line with the \u201ccommercial \nprinciples\u201d objective of the Public Bodies Act such that the CSO is the amount corresponding to \nthe difference between the tariff charged and the full cost recovery rate.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1   The CSO will not cover or make up for any inefficiency in tariff collection. For the CBA scheme a collection rate of \n\n85% based on analysis of debtor list for water for said customers, and 70% for individual systems.  \n\n2   Water supply connections number about 7,000 domestic and 160 commercial users. Special arrangements will be \n\nmade for residents with private water supply. \n\n3   All tariff calculations for individual systems assume cross-subsidy such that no CSO is required to cover the \u201cfree \n\n4 Tariff estimates are based on the tariff applied to 100% of water supplied, and increase annually relative to inflation \n\nallocation.\u201d \n\nto cover the increase in OMM cost. \n\n\fAnnual \nCSO \nPayment \nST \n \n\n980,000 \n\n400,000 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \nOptions \n\nTable A9.2: Central Business Area Scheme: Estimated Tariffs, User Charges, and  \nCommunity Service Obligation Payments \n\nTariff / m 3  \n\nExample Monthly Charges \n(ST) \nBusiness 2 \n\nBusiness 1 \n\nBusiness 3  \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n41 \n\nA.

The  estimated  tariffs  at  break  even  (ST4/m3)  and  at  full  cost  recovery  (ST5/m3) \nare  lower  than  the  unit  operational  cost  of  treatment  for  the  few  businesses  in  Apia  that  treat \ntheir own wastewater to a similar standard (ST9/m3 and ST7.7/m3 [Business 2 in Table A9.2]). \nSome  businesses  with  very  large  water  use  (Business  3)  spend  minimal  amounts  on \nwastewater  currently,  and  it  is  these  businesses  that  require  strict  enforcement  of  proposed \nenvironmental  standards.  The  cost  of  meeting  these  standards  individually  exceeds  the \nestimated  wastewater  charges.  For  example,  the  capital  cost  alone  of  Business  3  meeting \nsecondary treatment standards would be about ST1.5 million. Significantly, public bodies tend to \nfall  into  this  category,  currently  spending  minimal  amounts  on  wastewater  treatment  and  with \nrelatively high water consumption.  \n \n\nTable A9.3: Individual Systems: Estimated Tariffs, User Charges, and  \nCommunity Service Obligation Payments \n\n \n\n \n\n \nOptions \n\nA.

Average  tariffs  represent  2.3%  of  a  low-income \nhousehold of ST600/month. Given the \u201cfree entitlement,\u201d a low income household with very low \nwater use would pay nothing. A household using low volume of water, as in household 2, would \npay between ST4 and ST7 per month. \n \n\n2.  Financial Appraisal \n\n \n15. \nFor the financial appraisal, cost recovery from user charges is assumed to cover OMM, \nand  a  transparent  CSO  payment,  treated  as  operational  income,  is  assumed  to  cover  the \ndifference between that tariff rate and full cost recovery. The weighted average cost of capital \n(WACC) is calculated  using  the  loan  terms  to  SWA.5  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  was \n9.7% for the CBA and special needs areas, and 6.8% for the individual systems. Both exceed \nthe calculated WACC of 4.9%. \n \n\n 3.  Financial Forecasts and Sustainability \n\n \n16. \nSWA does not have a history of financial viability and makes a considerable loss each \nyear.  Recent  tariff  increases  aim  to  improve  financial  performance  to  cover  O&M,  but  this \nremains  a  medium-  to  long-term  goal.  The  new  tariff  structure  and  metering  program  has \nalready improved collection rates, and this is likely to improve further over the next few years, \nparticularly  in  the  rural  areas,  where  the  current  levels  of  cost  recovery  are  extremely  low. \nCompletion of the rural water supply project to obtain connections and the introduction of meters \nis intended to improve revenue collection. \n \nCalculated  tariffs  and  CSO  payments  have  been  designed  to  ensure  that  the  financial \n17. \nimpact of the Project on SWA is positive. The Government will ensure that for wastewater, CSO \npayments combined with user charges at minimum cover OMM and debt service for SWA. To \nthis  extent,  the  wastewater  operations  of  SWA  will  be  financially  sustainable.  In  addition,  two \nspecific aspects will assist the water side of the business improve financial performance. First, \nthe  Government  is  committed  to  making  CSO  payments  more  transparent  and  allocated  to \nspecific activities, rather than simple budget funding, and the Project includes as an assurance \nthat CSO payments for water as well as wastewater are made transparent. Second, the Project \nprovides improvements to the billing and database system.  \n \n18. \nSWA  has  prepared  financial  forecasts  to  FY  2008/09.  The  impact  of  the  sanitation \nproject  is  positive,  although  the  net  position  in  the  final  year  remains  negative,  indicating  that \nSWA  is  not,  and  is  unlikely  to  become,  financially  viable  in  the  medium  term.  However,  the \nextent to which SWA becomes financially viable depends on the agreed CSO payment for water \nmore than any other factor. \n \n\n                                                 \n5 Government equity contribution was assumed at 7.9%, the current yield on 12-month bonds. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n43 \n\nSUMMARY ECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \n\nEconomic Rationale \n\nA. \n \n1. \nApia, with an urban population of around 60,000 people (about 8,200 households) is the \ncapital and the main focus for economic activity in Samoa. Over the last decade, following two \ncyclones  in  the  early  1990s,  the  Government  has  been  pursuing  economic  reform,  within  a \nculturally acceptable and socially responsible framework. Average real economic growth since \n1994 has been about 4.5%, and in 2000 and 2001 was over 6%. Gross domestic product (GDP) \nper  capita  is  about  ST5,000  per  annum  (around  $1,570).  However,  the  economy  remains \nvulnerable,  largely  due  to  weather  and  other  exogenous  shocks,  because  of  its  small  size, \nlimited  diversity  of  economic  activity,  and  dependence  on  agriculture.  The  economy  is  highly \nsupported  by  external  sources:  approximately  a  third  of  government  revenues  are  external \ngrants, and private remittances from abroad are an important part of the economy. \n \n2. \nThe  Government\u2019s  reform  agenda  includes  institutional  reform,  to  reduce  the  scope  of \ngovernment  activity  through  rationalization,  corporatization,  and  contracting  out  of  some \nservices.  The  Strategy  for  the  Economic  Development  of  Samoa  2002-2004  continues  the \nemphasis  on  macroeconomic  stability  and  sustainable  growth,  supported  by  further  efficiency \nimprovements,  and  also  a  focus  on  social  and  environmental  aspects  to  support  the  policy \nprogram. Public health, environmental quality, and better urban planning are all incorporated.  \n \n3. \nPublicly  and  politically,  there  is  strong  concern  for  environmental  issues.  The  new \nPlanning  and  Urban  Management  Bill,  deals  with  the  biophysical  as  well  as  the  social  and \neconomic environment. Similarly, the focus on sustainability and appropriateness for Samoa are \nemphasized  in  the  Tourism  Development  Plan  2002-2006.  The  Health  Sector  Strategic  Plan \nspecifically  identifies  environmental  health  issues,  including  the  lack  of  a  public  sewerage \nsystem  and  drainage  problems  as  affecting  public  health.  The  plan  links  recent  outbreaks  of \ndengue,  incidence  of  diarrheal  diseases,  respiratory  diseases,  and  skin  disease  with  the  need \nfor more intensive environmental health control.  \n \n4. \nApia  shows  the  typical  signs  of  inadequate  planning  and  infrastructure  provision  for \nenvironmental  protection  associated  with  many  urban  areas.  Here  the  traditional  village \ncommunity  responsibility  in  many  aspects  has  broken  down.  About  75%  of  households  are \nestimated to have septic systems but these are not functioning properly. Individual systems tend \nto  be  undersized,  and  rarely  cleaned,  and  most  are  linked  to  the  nearest  drainage  channel, \npolluting groundwater, surface streams, and the harbor. In the central business area (CBA) and \nspecial needs areas, less than 10% of wastewater is currently treated adequately. In Apia the \nsituation is exacerbated by the historical lack of urban management, including the absence of a \ndrainage  or  wastewater  management  plan  and  the  absence  of  effective  town  planning. \nIndividuals have raised the heights of sections, reclaimed land in the mangrove area, and built \nover and blocked drainage channels.  The combined effect is a haphazard and non-functioning \ndrainage  system.  Flooding  after  heavy  rain  is  intensified,  while  foul  water  flooding  poses  a \npublic health risk. \n \n5. \nDetailed historical data on the frequency and extent of flooding is not available, although \na recent South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC) study1 records a long history \nof  flooding  in  Apia.  A  severe  flood  occurred  in  2001,  and  the  report  estimates  that  5,000 \nresidents were directly affected with water entering their home or business and 28,000 indirectly \nthrough  damage  to  the  water  supply  infrastructure.  The  estimated  repair  bill  was  in  excess  of \nST11 million (2001 prices). \n                                                 \n1 A Review of Flooding in Apia, Samoa, April 2001, Yeo, July 2001, SOPAC Technical Report 338.  \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n\nProject Description and Beneficiaries \n\n6. \nThe  Project  provides  the  first  major  physical  infrastructure  project  following  the \nestablishment  of  the  Planning  and  Urban  Management  Agency  (PUMA)  and  is  an  important \nstep in establishing a fully functioning urban management system. In addition to demonstrating \nthe benefits accruing from physical development, the Project also includes appropriate planning \nand  legislative  and  institutional  strengthening  to  support  both  the  project  implementation  and \nincrease the likelihood of future projects. \n \nWithout the drainage component, the CBA and surrounding low-lying areas will continue \n7. \nto be subject to flooding with unsanitary water with its associated damage to property, economic \nactivity, livelihood, and public health. Without the wastewater component, the population of Apia \nis  exposed  to  public  health  risks  associated  with  poor  sanitation,  pollution  of  ground-  and \nsurface water, and consequent impacts on the urban living environment. The Project provides a \ntwo-pronged urban management solution to reduce the risk and mitigate the impacts of flooding \nin the CBA and surrounding low-lying areas. \n \nB. \n \n8. \nThe drainage component will improve the drainage and mitigate the risk of flooding for \nthe CBA and an  estimated 225 households (1,800 people) in the immediate area. Beneficiaries \ninclude more than 150 institutional and businesses establishments, an estimated 2,000 working \npeople, and most of the estimated  50,000 annual holiday visitors. \n \n9. \nThe  wastewater  component  will  provide  (i)  improved  urban  environment  and  public \nhealth for all 60,000 urban residents of Apia (about 8,200 households) through a regular pump-\nout  system  for  septic  tanks  and  latrines,  and  septage  treatment  and  disposal;  rehabilitation  of \nsystems in the low-lying area identified as a priority (about 500 households); and (ii) reticulated \nsewerage  collection,  treatment,  and  sludge  disposal  for  the  CBA  and  identified  special  needs \nareas.  As  with  the  drainage  component,  beneficiaries  include  all  establishments  and  persons \nwho live, own property, work or visit the CBA plus the special needs areas, including: (i) in- and \nout-patients  and  employees  of  the  National  Hospital  (estimated  at  10,000,  50,000,  and  130 \npeople,  respectively);  students  and  staff  at  the  Malifa  School  compound  (2,200  persons); \nstallholders and visitors to Fugalei Market.  \n \n10. \nAlso,  all  persons  affected  by  the  negative  impacts  of  poor  drainage  and  wastewater \nmanagement  will  benefit  from  an  overall  improvement  to  amenity  and  environment.  This \nincludes  some  specific  examples  where  existing  wastewater  facilities  are  polluting  the \nenvironment to the extent that the odor, water quality, health and living environment is severely \naffected, such as the families living immediately downstream of the hospital wastewater facility, \nwhich regularly breaks down. Improvements in water quality will likely have positive marine and \ncoastal impacts. \n \n11. \nThere will also be direct and indirect impacts to the economy of Apia and, as the capital \nof  Samoa,  to  Samoa  as  a  whole.  Apia  accounts  for  an  estimated  70%  of  GDP,  50%  of  hotel \nbeds, 80% of commerce (the largest single sector), 90% of the finance and business services, \nand  60%  of  public  administration.  Direct  economic  impacts  include  the  savings  from    the \ncleanup  of  unsanitary  flood  water,  traffic  disruptions,  damage  to  property  and  resources, \nexpenditure  on  environment-related  diseases  and  epidemics,  and  loss  of  economic  activity. \nIndirect  impacts  include  improved  investment  and  business  opportunities,  including  general \ncommerce,  tourism,  and  aquaculture,  resulting  from  a  cleaner,  more  attractive  urban \nenvironment and improvements to productivity from a healthier workforce. \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n45 \n\nProject Selection and Analysis of Alternatives \n\nC.  \n \n12. \nThe Project has been selected based on identified needs and priorities, government and \nbeneficiary  affordability,  comparison  of  alternatives  and  least-cost  solutions,  appropriate \ntechnology and ease of implementation. A number of previous studies from 1983 onward have \nlooked  at  the  drainage  and  wastewater  sector  in  Samoa,  primarily  looking  at  much  more \nambitious  schemes.  For  wastewater,  this  involved  larger  reticulation  systems  which,  while \nenvironmentally preferable, are expensive. The project scale needed to be more affordable, to \nthe Government and beneficiaries. The drainage component has been scaled back to mitigate \nproblems  associated  with  implementing  projects  requiring  the  use  of  customary  land.  At  the \nsame  time,  the  Government\u2019s  priority  to  improve  residential  sanitation,  particularly  in  the  low-\nlying  areas  as  well  as  identified  special  needs  areas,  had  to  be  addressed,  balancing \nenvironmental, financial, and social considerations.  \n \n13. \nAlternative  solutions  were  considered  in  determining  the  geographical  coverage  of  the \nreticulated system and for each of the identified special needs area. The proposed CBA scheme \nis  slightly  larger  than  was  originally  proposed  to  include  one  of  the  largest  wastewater \ngenerators.  The  net  present  values  (NPV)  of  individual  systems  were  compared  to  the \nincremental costs of expanding the CBA reticulated scheme. In both cases the incremental NPV \nof expanding the CBA scheme was lower than the NPV of an independent package treatment \nplant. Expanding the system to include these outlying buildings has the benefit of including all \nthe other customers in between and also reducing the average incremental cost of the scheme \nthrough  economies  of  scale.  For  two  special  needs  areas\u2014the  Malifa  School  compound  and \nNational Hospital\u2014a similar exercise was undertaken. The cost of an on-site package plant was \ncompared to the incremental cost of linking to the CBA scheme, including expanding the size of \nthe treatment plant. The NPV of linking to the scheme was found to be the least cost solution.  \n \n14. \nA recent report reviewed and compared more than 20 options for wastewater treatment, \nincluding  screening  plants,  aerated  lagoons,  biological  nutrient  removal,  activated  sludge,  and \nocean  outfalls.  However,  the  options  are  not  strictly  comparable  since  some  provide  much \nhigher levels of treatment than others. The proposed solution combines a least cost approach to \nsecondary  treatment  through  the  use  of  a  prefabricated  package  plant  plus  the  use  of  an \ninfiltration  gallery,  maximizing  the  use  of  the  adjoining  wetlands  to  provide  additional \nenvironmental  protection.  Secondary  treatment  is  necessary  to  avoid  the  need  for  expensive \nocean  outfalls  and  adequately  protect  Vaiusu  Bay,  which  is  used  for  subsistence  and  some \ncommercial fishing. \n \n15. \nFor the urban areas outside the CBA, development of a reticulated system remains the \nlong-term goal, but at this stage, the opportunity cost to the Government of a larger scheme is \ntoo  high.  Rather,  upgrading  the  systems  of  the  most  vulnerable  households  and  proper \noperation and maintenance of existing systems was considered to be appropriate to affordability \nlevels, while recognizing the benefits of improved environmental standards. Currently very few \nindividual  systems  function  properly,  residents  have  no  incentives  to  maintain  the  systems \nadequately,  and  no  regulations  compel  the  residents  to  do  so.  The  Project  will  provide  a \nmandatory  pump  out,  operated  through  a  private  sector  contractor,  and  residents  will  be \ncharged some or all of the cost. This system takes away the disincentive of payment at the point \nof delivery, which results in the vast majority of households doing nothing. At the same time, the \nregular  charge  to  customers  encourages  people  to  appreciate  the  collective  benefits  of  better \nenvironmental standards. \n \n \n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nEconomic Rate of Return Analysis \n\nD. \n \n16. \nThe  analysis  compares  a  calculated  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the \nProject to the economic opportunity cost of capital (EOCC), which is assumed to be 10%.2 The \nanalysis is undertaken as a whole, rather than for specific components, since there are mutual \nbenefits from the integrated nature of drainage and wastewater. The analysis uses the domestic \nprice numeraire, and constant January 2003 prices. \n \n17. \nEconomic costs include physical and nonphysical project components, excluding taxes. \nThe shadow exchange rate factor was estimated to be 1.19, based on the value of imports and \nexports  and  related  taxes  and  subsidies.  The  land  to  be  occupied  by  facilities  created  has \nminimal  chance  of  being  used  in  any  other  productive  capacity  except  as  proposed  under  the \nProject,  and  thus  a  conversion  factor  of  0.5  was  used.  The  incremental  economic  costs  are \nphased over the planning period, assumed to be 20 years. Replacement costs are included for \nvacuum trucks, and a residual value is included at the end of the period. \n \n18. \nValued  benefits  include  (i)  estimated  repair  cost  savings  from  flood  damage,  (ii) \nestimated labor clean-up cost of flood damage, (iii) resource cost savings on minimal individual \nsanitation  systems  as  in  current  practice,  and  (iv)  willingness  to  pay  for  improvements  to \nwastewater management. Values for flood damage were based on the Yeo report, which reports \nthe damages of the 2001 flood and assuming the risk of a severe flood of 1 in 25 years and a \nless severe flood of 1 in 5 years. These values were adjusted to (i) include only the damage to \nthe  low-lying  areas,  primarily  residents,  businesses,  and  roads,  the  risk  to  which  would  be \nsignificantly  reduced  as  a  result  of  the  Project;  and  (ii)  to  account  for  the  underestimate  of \ndamage  due  to  non-insurance,  primarily  of  disruption  to  business.  Labor  clean-up costs are \nminimal,  assumed  to  be  2  days  per  affected  building  at  a  wage  rate  of  ST30/day.  Minimal \nsanitation systems were based on the number of commercial establishments in the CBA and an \naverage ST50,000 spent on individual systems every 20 years, plus the current pump out cost \nevery 2 years. The capital cost of the existing package plant that can be reused was included. \nFinally, coverage of operation, maintenance, and management of the wastewater components \nonly  was  taken  a  proxy  for  residents\u2019  and  businesses\u2019  willingness  to  pay  for  wastewater \nmanagement. This is the Government\u2019s minimum cost recovery policy based on existing water \ncharges  and  a  perceived  minimum  willingness  to  pay.  The  valuation  of  economic  benefits  is \nlikely to underestimate the true value of the Project in economic terms, largely because many of \nthe  benefits  are  difficult  to  quantify,  attribute,  and  assign  a  monetary  value.  These  include \nsavings in health expenditure, and improvements in urban living and working conditions, water \nquality, and business environment. Equally important are the benefits of improving planning and \nurban management, and increasing the potential of similar projects downstream. \n \nE. \n \n19. \nThe  base  case  EIRR  of  12.4%  exceeded  the  EOCC.  Standard  sensitivity  tests  were \ntaken at 10 percent and for project delays, and project-specific sensitivity tests were undertaken \nfor (i) the conversion factor for land (from 0.5 to 1.0), (ii) willingness to pay (less 50%), and (iii) \nreduced risk of a severe flood (from 4% to 2%). Under all the sensitivity tests, the Project was \nfound to be economically viable or so close to be marginal. The calculated EIRR is expected to \nbe lower than the true EIRR since it has not been possible to value all of the economic benefits \nof the Project. Detailed economic analysis is presented in the Supplementary Appendix B. \n\nResults and Conclusion \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB. 1997.

Most  wastewater is now \ntreated  in  individual  systems  such  as  cesspools  and  septic systems before it is discharged to \ndrainage channels (including open channels and streams), soil, and groundwater.1 Flooding is a \nfrequent problem due to high rainfall and inadequate drainage system, that is compounded by \nland filling, blocking of drains, and lack of town planning.  Flooding after heavy rain is intensified \nand  foul  water  flooding  poses  a  public  health  risk  due  to  septage  and  latrine  wastes  being \nreleased to surface environment. The objective of the proposed project is to improve drainage, \nwastewater and sanitation management in Apia. An initial environmental examination (IEE) has \nbeen conducted in accordance with Government of Samoa guidelines2 and Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  policies.  A  summary  IEE  (SIEE)  has  also  been  prepared  and  included  in \nSupplementary Appendix B.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  SIEE  and  IEE  fully  describe  the  environment.  The  project  area\u2019s  key  features \nrelevant to wastewater management are as follows: (i) high island tropical climate with abundant \nrainfall (about 2,500 millimeters [mm] on average annually and about 5,500 mm at the top of the \ncatchment that drains to Apia) although there is a distinctive dry season; (ii) many rivers, lakes, \nand ponds with more than 25% of the municipality covered by water; (iii) mostly clay and sandy \nclay soil in the upland area; and (iv) in the Apia town area, including the central business area \n(CBA), the flora and fauna have been substantially modified by expansion of urban development \nand  introduction  of  exotic  plants  and  animals.  Apia  soil  is  characterized  by  coral  limestone \nsands  with  a  high  water  table.  Soils  of  the  Vaiusu  Bay  area  are  described  as  sandy  clay  and \npeaty sand that are difficult to drain, unsuitable for agriculture, and sustain primarily mangrove \ndevelopment.  Marine  waters,  including  Vaiusu  Bay,  are  used  for  subsistence  and  commercial \nfishing. Tourism, which is reliant on high environmental quality, is a major economic sector. \n \n3. \nWater  quality  monitoring  data,  which  has  been  only  intermittently  collected,  shows \ndefinitive evidence of sewage contamination as evidenced by low dissolved oxygen saturation, \nhigh biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) , high total nitrogen concentrations, and high indicator \nbacteria  concentrations.  Urban  drains  are  often  choked  with  litter  and  vegetation,  emit  foul \nsmells  (indicating  anaerobic  conditions),  and  contain  floating  oils  and  sewage.  Drains  and \nnatural watercourses are contaminated with sewage and, occasionally, industrial waste. \n \nC. \n \n4.  Without  the  Project,  water  quality  will  continue  to  deteriorate  since  individual  systems \ncannot  effectively  treat  wastewater  given  the  population  density,  hydrologic  conditions,  soil \nconditions, etc. With the Project, living conditions and aquatic environmental quality in the Apia \n                                                 \n1   There  are  a  few,  mostly  poorly  operating  package  plants  at  some  business  centers  and  government  complexes, \nwith  the  facilities  for  the  National  Provident  Fund  Building  and  Lotemau  business  centers  being  the  notable \nexceptions. \n\nAlternatives \n\n2   The  Government\u2019s  1998  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  Guidelines  have  not  yet  been  promulgated. \n\nNevertheless, the IEE was prepared to comply with Preliminary Environmental Assessment Report Guidance. \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix  11 \n\nurban area will be improved. Project preparations and numerous previous studies considered a \nnumber of alternative wastewater collection and treatment schemes. Many have involved large-\nscale schemes with varying levels of treatment, which were generally considered unaffordable \n(by the Government and consumers) and technically beyond the capacity of the country. Some \nalso  had  environmental  concerns  associated  with  ocean  outfalls.  The  proposed  solution \ncombines  a  least  cost  approach  to  secondary  treatment  through  the  use  of  a  prefabricated \npackage wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), plus the use of an infiltration gallery, maximizing \nthe use of the adjoining wetlands to provide additional environmental protection. \n \nD. \n\nAnticipated Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\nProject \nPhase  \n\nEffect \n\nAir \n\nConstruction b  Dust \n\n \nTable A11: Summary of Key Environmental Impacts \n\nWater \n\nLand \n\nMitigation \nMeasuresa \n\u2022  Covering of fill \n\ntransport vehicles  \n\n\u2022  Water spraying \n\u2022  Minimization of on-\n\nEffect \n\nErosion \nand \nsedimenta-\ntion \n\nMitigation \nMeasure a \n\n\u2022  Erosion \ncontrol \n\n\u2022  Construction \nscheduling \n\nEffect \n\nVegetation \nremoval \n\nsite material \nstorage \n\u2022  Careful \n\nconstruction \nscheduling \n\n\u2022  Site sound barriers \n\u2022  Proper operation \nand maintenance \n(O&M) of \nequipment \n\nNoise \nand \ntraffic \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nOperational \n\nodor \n\n\u2022  Engineering \ncontrols  \n\u2022  Buffer zones \n\u2022  Odor control  \n\u2022  O&M capacity \n\nbuilding \n\nLocalized \npollution \nfrom \nemergency \ndischarges  \n\n\u2022  Controls  \n\u2022  Buffer zones \n\u2022  Odor control  \n\u2022  O&M capacity \n\nbuilding  \n\n\u2022  Appropriate design  Overflows \n\nand \nbypasses  \n\nStandby \nequipment and \nproper O&M \n\n \n\n \n\nAppropriate \ndesign \n\nCorrosive \ngas \ndamage \nto sewers  \n\n \n\n \n\na Listed measures are indicative.

Preliminary  environmental  monitoring  programs,  which  address  monitoring  of  all \nenvironmental  media,  have  been  developed  and  will  be  finalized  during  detailed  design.  A \nbaseline  water  quality-monitoring  program  needs  to  be  implemented  to  demonstrate  positive \nproject  effects  as  well  as  monitor  sediment  loadings  and  turbidity  during  construction.  Key \nmonitoring  points  will  include  outlets  for  the  Gasegase,  Asaga,  and  Mulivai  stream  and  the \nVaisigano River. The Mulivai Stream just downstream of the National Hospital will also be a key \nmonitoring point as will Vaiusu Bay, particularly near the WWTP.  \n \n6.  Public  participation  was  a  key  part  of  the  development  of  the  Urban  Planning  and \nManagement  Strategy  from  which  this  Project  emerged.  The  Government  is  continuing \nconsultations as part of its pre-loan preparations. The SIEE describes completed and planned \npublic participation activities, agency responsibilities, staffing needs, and monitoring programs.  \n \n7.  Promulgated  environmental  legislation  are  limited.  The  capacity-building  component  will \nhelp develop such legal frameworks. \n \nF. \n \n8. \nThe  Project  will  improve  the  environmental  quality  and  public  health  of  Apia.  Adverse \nimpacts  will  be  minimal  and  will  be  mitigated.  Comprehensive  monitoring  and  environmental \nmanagement  programs  will  be  implemented  to  ensure  adherence  to  Samoan  laws  and  ADB \npolicies. The Category B environmental classification is confirmed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nConclusion \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix  12 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n\n \nA. \nSector identified as a National Priority in \nCountry Poverty Analysis?  \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\n \nYes \n\nSector identified as a National \nPriority in Country Poverty \nPartnership Agreement?  \n\n \nNot \n\napplicable  \n\nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Samoa:  \n\n \n\nPoverty Analysis   \n\nProposed Classification: Nonclassified  \n\nB. \n1.  Poverty  data  and  information  from  a  community  consultation  process  contributed  to  the  project  design. \nPoverty analysis was taken into account in relation to the cost recovery and user-pay features of the wastewater \nand sanitation infrastructure components. \n \n2.  The  Project  provides  direct  benefits  to  living  conditions,  health,  and  some  limited  job  creation,  and  indirect \nbenefits  to  income  poverty  that  accrue  from  reduced  health  care  costs,  increased  productivity,  and  economic \ndevelopment. The Project will make a limited direct and greater indirect contribution to poverty alleviation.  \n \n3.  The  proportion  of  the  poor1  in  the  service  area  population  cannot  be  quantified  meaningfully  as  no  official \npoverty line has been determined for Samoa. There is evidence that some of the poorest households in Apia are \nin  the  low-lying  area  identified  in  the  project  design  for  sanitation  facility  rehabilitation.  Many  Apia  residents  are \nurban migrants who live outside the traditional village structure and are exposed to greater social and economic \nrisks  because  they  have  no  or  limited  access  to  traditional  social  protection  mechanisms.  These  poor \nhouseholds  will  benefit  from  improved  living  conditions  and  reduction  in  health  risks.  The  greater  Apia  area  is \nlikely to include some poor households who will share the same benefits but with greater marginal utility. Urban \npoor  relying  on  local  fishing  for  consumption  and  income  will  benefit  from  the  improved  marine  environment. \nCleaner marine water will benefit those using it for recreation. \n \n4. As an environmental project, the living conditions for all in the service area of the Project will improve. These \nbenefits  will  also  accrue  to  the  poor.  Improved  environmental  quality  will  promote  sustainable  urban \ndevelopment,  for  example,  through  tourism.  The  improvement  in  water  quality  will  contribute  to  the  steady \ndevelopment of a water-based tourism industry that depends directly on good water quality. \n \n5.  The  Project  will  directly  benefit  poverty  reduction  through  the  provision  of  some  limited  jobs  for  unskilled \nlaborers during the construction phase and for ongoing drainage maintenance. Poverty reduction impacts can be \nexpected from economic growth as a result of improvements to CBA infrastructure, private sector participation in \nthe  provision  of  utility  facilities,  and  improved  marine  environment  for  the  fisheries  industry.  An  inventory  to \nassess the quality of sanitation facilities throughout the project area will also assess the capacity and willingness \nof  the  poor  to  pay  for  improved  services.  The  design  of  the  cost-recovery  framework  will  take  into  account  the \nimpact on the poor and vulnerable. \n \n \nC. \nStakeholder analysis prepared: \nPublic consultation/participation is an element of the project design and planning and is prepared through \ncommunity-driven design mechanisms involving beneficiaries. A community participation and awareness \nprogram will be formulated and implemented to serve as ongoing consultation mechanism with the involvement \nof all stakeholders. \nParticipation Strategy \nConsultation with the community is planned as a critical component of the capacity building of involved agencies \ncomponent  of  the  Project.  The  community  awareness  program  will  be  developed  with  the  direct  involvement  of \nthe community and will include the development of community involvement principles, a participative framework, \nand  mechanisms  for  community  awareness  and  education.  The  Project  will  assess  the  education  and \ninformation  needs  of  the  community  and  identify  the  special  needs  of  target  groups  such  as  low-income  and \n                                                 \n1  The  Government  has  not  determined  a  poverty  line.

The  information  and  education  program  will  deliver  targeted  information  about  the  Project  and  its \nimpacts, specifically the rights and obligations of the Government, households, organizations, and communities, \nand  general  information  about  related  environmental  and  health  issues.  Performance  indicators  and  a \nperformance monitoring program for community awareness will be developed and implemented. In collaboration \nwith  the  relevant  agencies,  the  program  will  develop  and  implement  community  and  customer  feedback  and \ncomplaint - handling procedures and will integrate this feedback into agency decision-making processes. \n \n \nD.   \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: Women are fully  represented to ensure that improvement of sewage \nservice  and  sanitary  conditions  reflect  women\u2019s  role  in  household  activities  and  domestic  economy,  and  that \nhealth and income generation benefits reflect women\u2019s needs. \n \nGender plan prepared:  No \n \nE.  \n  \n\nGender and Development \n\nPotential Issues \n\n \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nSignificant/ \nNot \nSignificant/ \nUncertain/ \nNone \nNot \nSignificant \n\nResettlement \n \n  \n\nAffordability  \n \n\nNot \nSignificant \n\nLabor \n \nIndigenous \nPeople \nOther Risks/ \nVulnerabilities \n\nNone \n\nNone \n\nNot \nSignificant \n\nNo  to  minimum  land  acquisition  will  be  required  as  the  government \nstrategy is to avoid land acquisition for infrastructure property. However, \npreliminary design indicates that one to two landowners may be affected. \nLand is of marginal, and has no productive purposes, with no structures \non  it.  Government  land  acquisitions  are  legally  established  and \nconsistent with the ADB Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. Therefore, a \nshort resettlement plan has been prepared and is included in the  Report \nand Recommendation of the President as Appendix 13.  \nThe potential negative impact of wastewater tariff increases on the poor \nis  considered  to  be  minimal  given  that  tariff  paid  by  the  household  is  a \nsmall percentage of total income. A lifeline tariff regime will protect poor \nhouseholds. \nNo job loss will occur. The construction and operation of the Project will \ngenerate employment opportunities to the local beneficiaries. \nSamoa is ethnically homogeneous and its indigenous population remains \nin place. It has no minority population except for expatriate workers. \nNo other risks of impoverishment were identified. \n\n \n\nOutput \nPrepared \n\nSummary \nresettlement \nplan \n \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nSHORT RESETTLEMENT AND LAND ACQUISITION PLAN  \n\nScope of Land Acquisition \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nThe Government\u2019s strategy is to avoid land acquisition and resettlement for all drainage \nand  urban  services  and  that  approach  has  been  followed  in  this  Project.  Nevertheless,  the \npreliminary  design  indicates  that  limited  land  acquisition  may  be  necessary  for  the  drainage \ncomponent.  The  potentially  affected  land  involves  low-lying,  undeveloped  land  along  natural \nstream  floodways  in  the  urban  area.  The  land  is  unproductive  and  includes  no  structures. \nLandowners  hold  legal  title  and  are  not  considered  vulnerable  by  economic status, gender, or \nminority  status.  The  assessment  also  considered  the  potential  need  for  sewer  alignment \nchanges  based  on  detailed  design  and  determined  that  any  reasonable  shift  could  still  only \ninvolved less than five landowners and this would only involve subsurface land use. \n \n2. \nGiven the few affected persons (less than 5 households) and that no structures, sources \nof  livelihood,  or  productive  lands  are  affected,  this  level  of  land  acquisition  is  considered \ninsignificant by the Asian Development Bank (ADB)  Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and the \nHandbook on Resettlement, A Guide to Good Practice.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe  Government  has  well-established  procedures  for the taking of lands, that consider \ntraditional land tenure systems and modern systems Compensation and grievance procedures \nare well articulated in the relevant Act and these are consistent with ADB policy and guidance. \n \nC. \n \n\nPolicy Framework and Entitlements \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nInstitutional Framework \n\n \n4. \nThe  Department  of  Lands,  Survey,  and  Environment  (DLSE)  is  closely  involved  in  the \nProject through its Planning and Urban Management Agency (PUMA), which will facilitate timely \ncoordination  of  land  acquisition.  The  project  management  unit  will  coordinate  detailed  design \nwith  PUMA  and  DLSE  to  ensure  that  land  acquisition  is  in  accordance  with  applicable \ngovernment laws and regulations, ADB policies, and this short resettlement plan. \n \n\n2. \n\nResettlement Budget and Financing \n\n \n5. \n$260,000 (ST790,000) has been allocated for this.  \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\nLand  acquisition  will  be  100%  financed  by  the  national  Government.  A  budget  of \n\n \n6. \nThe  Government  will  undertake  preliminary  consultations  with  potentially  affected \nlandowners  as  part  of  its  ongoing  pre-loan preparations and no later than loan effectiveness. \nDetailed discussions will begin after detailed design has determined which, if any, landowners \nwill be affected and to what extent. Design will be completed by third quarter of 2004. \n \nD. \n \n7. \nMonitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  mainstreamed  into  the  overall  project  implementation \nmonitoring  program,  and  quarterly  reports  will  confirm  the  number  of  affected  persons  and \nstatus of the land acquisition process. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n53 \n\nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSISTANCE AND \nLOAN-FUNDED CAPACITY BUILDING CONSULTING SERVICES  \n\nScope of Work \n\n \nA. \n \nThe Consultant will work with the Ministry of Works Transport and Infrastructure (MWTI), \n1. \nPlanning  and  Urban  Management  Agency  (PUMA),  and  Samoa  Water  Authority  (SWA)  to \ndevelop  all  necessary  needs,  plans  and  programs,  and  to  provide  assistance,  advice,  and \ntraining on the following: \n\n \nProject Implementation Assistance \n\nB. \n \n\nProject Management and Implementation Support \n\n(i) \n\nDesign and construction supervision:   \n \nThe following activities will be completed in this area: \n\n(a)  Perform  preliminary  and  final  designs  wastewater  treatment  plant \n(WWTP),  sewers,  septage  lagoons,  drainage  works).
