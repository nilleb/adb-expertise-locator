THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on the proposed \nloans to the Republic of Palau for the North Pacific Regional Connectivity Investment Project.1 \n \n2.  The proposed project will decrease the cost and increase the quality of internet service \nin Palau by establishing broadband internet connectivity\u2014connecting Palau to the Southeast \nAsia\u2013United States (SEA\u2013US) submarine cable that joins the international cable hub in Guam.2 \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been providing technical assistance (TA) to Palau for \nproject preparation.3 The World Bank has provided complementary TA to Palau to develop \nlegislation  establishing  a  state-owned  submarine  cable  company  and  an  Information  and \nCommunications Technology (ICT) Regulatory Office.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Palau relies entirely on satellite links for internet connectivity. The technical capacity \nlimitations and the delay associated with such satellite-based connectivity severely limit the \nquality of internet service.4 The high cost and limited international bandwidth restrict internet \npenetration.5 In Palau, internet is accessed by only 25% of the population, while 90% have \naccess to mobile phones.  \n \n4.  The ICT sector is widely recognized as an enabler of economic growth, social stability, \nand development. Increased access to ICT, particularly broadband internet services, helps \ndeliver improved financial services and social services, such as health and education, among \nothers.6 It brings efficiency and reduces the cost of such services, and in turn enables an \nenvironment conducive to private sector investment. The ICT sector has created significant \nemployment opportunities in many Asian countries. High-speed international communication is \nimportant to the tourism industry (on which Palau is highly reliant) for marketing, facilitating \nbookings and contributing to tourist satisfaction.7  \n \n5.  In  2014,  Palau  and  the  Federated  States  of  Micronesia  (FSM)  jointly  initiated  a \nsubmarine  internet  cable  project  and  set  up  a  joint  committee,  MicroPal,8 to  examine \nconnectivity options through submarine cable by recognizing the similar nature of their needs \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   SEA\u2013US is a consortium of seven private telecom operators created in April 2015 to build a $250 million fiber \noptic cable from Indonesia to the west coast of the United States via Guam, Hawaii and the Philippines.  The West \nSubsystem parties are Globe (the Philippines) and Telin (Indonesia). \n3   ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance for the Pacific Information and Communication Technology Investment Planning \nand Capacity Development Facility. Manila. \n4   The latency of the satellite service is about 500 milliseconds compared with 80 milliseconds for cable. \n5   Palau has a capacity of 220 megabits per second. Satellite connectivity is generally available at a cost of \n$1,500/megabit/second/month compared with submarine cable at $600/megabit/second/month. \n6   World Bank. 2009. Information and Communications for Development 2009: Extending Reach and Increasing \nImpact. Washington, DC. \n7   Palau has a population of about 20,000 and a tourism industry of over 120,000 visitors annually. Tourism is \nequivalent to over 50% of gross domestic product, and services represent 87%. Economic growth has been \nstrong, averaging above 3% annually since 2010, thanks to record visitor arrivals and construction. \n8   MicroPal has six members\u2014three representatives from each country\u2014appointed by the President of the Republic \nof Palau and the Government of FSM. MicroPal has been supported by World Bank-funded consultants. It meets \nevery quarter (and more often as required) to discuss project implementation progress and other issues. ", "2 \n \nand  the  benefits  of  cooperation.9 MicroPal  initially  explored  building  an  independent  cable \nconnecting to Guam through a single procurement package. The Palau portion of the project is \nto be financed by ADB and the Yap state of FSM portion by the World Bank. The World Bank \napproved a grant of $47.5 million to the FSM in December 2014 that includes supporting the \nYap cable.10  \n   \n6.  In 2015, the construction of SEA\u2013US cable provided an opportunity for Palau and Yap to \nconnect  to  Guam  through  spurs  and  branching  units.  Palau  and  Yap  will  each  own  their \nrespective spurs and will have indefeasible right of use (IRU) on the SEA\u2013US cable. This option \nis found to be the most cost-effective solution, requiring significantly lower capital expenditure \nand lower operational costs. Moreover, the SEA\u2013US option gives the newly established cable \ncompany in Palau (Belau Submarine Cable Corporation [BSCC]) and the FSM cable company \nthe opportunity to leverage experience from the members of the SEA\u2013US consortium (footnote \n2) to maintain and operate a submarine cable\u2014thereby reducing the technical risk to both \ncountries.  \n \n7.  MicroPal, on behalf of BSCC and the FSM cable company, is at the final stage of \nnegotiating a memorandum of understanding with the SEA\u2013US parties. Subsequently, BSCC \nand the FSM cable company will enter into agreements with SEA\u2013US that will set out a clear \ndemarcation of responsibilities for Palau and the FSM, with no cross-linkages such as cross-\neffectiveness, cross-default, and cross-termination between the rights and obligations of Palau \non the one part and FSM on the other part. Under this structure, ADB and World Bank funds will \nnot be financing a single procurement package.  \n \n8.  The proposed project will provide higher quality broadband internet at a much lower cost \nto Palau, making it accessible and affordable for the broader population. The passing on of \nreduced costs by the wholesaler (BSCC) and retailers will be ensured through the effective \noperation of the telecoms sector regulator.11 The cable, with a capacity of 2 terabits per second, \nwill more than meet the broadband capacity needs of Palau at least until 2040 (the expected \ncable life is as long as 50 years). The uptake of internet will be a reflection of the project\u2019s \nsuccess. The Palau country operations business plan (COBP) includes TA in 2017 to build \ncapacity  and  demonstrate  efficient  public  service  provision  through  use  of  the  internet.12 \nElsewhere in the Pacific, ADB is supporting e-health and e-education initiatives that will inform \nthe design of the application in Palau.13 The project will also improve the operation of the \nsecured  transactions  system  (improving  access  to  finance),  as  well  as  online  business \nregistration, both of which are supported by ADB\u2019s Private Sector Development Initiative.14  \n \n9.  The proposed project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Interim Pacific Approach 2015, which \n                                                \n9   As an interim solution, Palau and the FSM telecom providers separately contracted a 5-year, 150-megabit-per-\nsecond service from a medium earth orbit satellite broadband service at the end of 2014. Once the more reliable \nsubmarine cable system is operational, the satellite system will complement this by providing back up in case of \nan interruption.  \n10  World Bank. 2014.

Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the project will be access to affordable ICT infrastructure in Palau.18 The \noutcome will be a decrease in the cost and an increase in the quality of internet service. \n \nC.  Output \n11.  The output will be the establishment of an efficient and effective submarine cable system \nconnecting Palau to the international internet cable hub in Guam. It will be achieved through \n(i) the construction of the approximately 300-kilometer spur and a branching unit to connect to \nthe SEA\u2013US submarine cable, (ii) efficient and effective operation of BSCC by the government, \nand (iii) agreements for IRU and maintenance between BSCC and SEA\u2013US parties. The project \nwill be supported by a project management unit (PMU) initially resourced by a team of project \nimplementation consultants. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n12.  The project is estimated to cost $30.19 million (Table 1).  \n \n13.  The government has requested a loan from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR) in \nthe amount of $16,470,000 and a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR6,032,000  from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. Palau will contribute $5.19 million in kind, bearing taxes and \nthe cost of operating BSCC during the project construction period. \n \n14.  The OCR loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, using the \nstraight-line repayment method with an annual interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, and a commitment charge \nof 0.15% per year. Based on this, the average loan maturity is 15.25 years and the maturity \npremium payable to ADB is 0.1% per annum. The ADF loan will have a 25-year term, including \na grace period of 5 years and interest of 2% per annum during the grace period and thereafter. \nOther terms and conditions are set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The interest \nfor both loans and the commitment charge for the OCR loan during project implementation will \nbe capitalized. \n \n15.  The loans proceed will be onlent to BSCC on the same terms and conditions as the ADB \nloans.19 BSCC will enter into a project agreement with ADB. The financing plan is in Table 2. \n \n                                                \n15  ADB. 2015. Interim Pacific Approach 2015. Manila; ADB. 2009. ADB's Pacific Approach, 2010-2014.

Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The Ministry of Finance will be the executing agency to facilitate the smooth flow of \nfunds and overall management of the project. Palau has set up BSCC, a state-owned enterprise \nthat will implement the project.20 BSCC will have a board comprising five directors, nominated \nby the President of Palau, and a chief executive officer reporting to the board to manage the \nday-to-day  operations  of  BSCC.  The  chief  executive  officer  will  be  responsible  for  staff \nrecruitment.  BSCC  will  have  its  own  by-laws.  The  implementation  arrangements  are \nsummarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the project administration manual (PAM).21 \n \n \n                                                \n20   The President of the Republic of Palau signed RPPL No. 9-47, creating the BSCC, into law on 21 September \n2015.

During project implementation, BSCC will receive support from the PMU, comprising a \nteam of project implementation and coordination consultants. The PMU will have a project \nmanager; accountant; technical, legal, and environment specialists; and other office staff. BSCC \nwill recruit consultants for the PMU. The PMU will support the Ministry of Finance and BSCC in \nday-to-day  project  operation,  managing  contracts,  producing  reports,  and  providing  regular \nstatus updates to stakeholders. The PMU will also provide support to Palau\u2019s representatives in \nMicroPal.  \n \n18.  MicroPal will continue to facilitate smooth information flows and liaise between Palau \nand Yap. ADB and the World Bank will enter into a memorandum of understanding, reflecting \nthe coordination of this project between Palau and Yap.  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n19.  The proposed project is expected to benefit the people of Palau through lower cost and \nhigher quality broadband internet services. Due diligence was based on detailed technical, \nregulatory, environmental, and social assessments; and stakeholder consultations. The project \npreparatory activities were divided between ADB and the World Bank. ADB activities included \neconomic, financial, social, and safeguards assessments undertaken through regional TA and \nstaff consultant inputs (footnote 3). \n \nA.  Technical \n20.  The project will connect Palau through a spur and branching unit to the international \nsubmarine cable owned by the SEA\u2013US connecting to Guam. Palau will own its spur and will \n ", "6 \n \nhave an IRU on the SEA\u2013US cable. Palau will leverage the SEA\u2013US landing station and permit \nin Guam.  \n \n21.  Submarine cable is the preferred, most cost-effective, and most sustainable method for \ninternet  connectivity,  with  well-established  and  proven  technology.  The  cable  will  be                     \n4.0\u20137.5 centimeters in diameter, with no significant impact on the ocean environment. The \ngovernment will establish the cable path in the ocean as a \u201cno anchor zone\u201d to avoid any \ndamage to the cable. The cable will land in Meyuns hamlet on Arakabesang Island in Koror, a \ngovernment-owned landing site used by the Palau National Communications Corporation, which \nalready has a conduit for placement of the cable leading directly to the existing landing site. \nBSCC will sign an agreement with Palau National Communications Corporation, the state-\nowned telecom supplier, to use the land and facility for the landing and for connection to the \nexisting national terrestrial network and a 128-kilometer interisland, fiber-optic cable.  \n \n22.  BSCC will act as a wholesale supplier of internet in Palau, and will obtain the necessary \noperating permit and license. BSCC will buy the capacity from the service providers in Guam \nand sell it to all local telecom providers in an equitable and nondiscriminatory way, following \nPalau\u2019s telecom regulatory policy. The local telecom providers will be responsible for providing a \nretail internet service using their own infrastructure.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n23.  Financial.  In  assessing  the  financial  viability  of  the  project,  demand  is  forecast \nconservatively below the region\u2019s average adoption rates, at an annual growth rate of about \n40.0%, declining to 20.0% within the first 5 years after the cable comes into service, then falling \nsteadily to about 3.5% growth by 2021, which is expected to be sustained thereafter. The \naverage annual growth rate over 15 years will be 12.0%. The resulting capacity is positioned at \nthe lower end of all available Pacific-based benchmark data. BSCC will generate revenues from \nthe  wholesaling  of  broadband  internet  capacity.  The  financial  viability  of  the  project  was \nevaluated by estimating the cash flows from operations and calculating the financial internal rate \nof return (FIRR). The cost of the project was estimated based on constant US dollar prices as of \nSeptember  2015.  For  the  financial  evaluation,  contingencies  and  financing  charges  were \nexcluded. \n \n24.  The FIRR was estimated at 11.7% against the weighted average cost of capital of \n2.38%. The interest rate of domestic borrowing has been used to assign an assumed cost to the \ngrant from the World Bank, while the proceeds of the ADB loans will be onlent to BSCC on the \nsame terms and conditions as the ADB loan. The cash flows were most sensitive to subscription \nlevels. Prices, initially set at $863/megabit/second/month, are forecast to fall as efficiencies and \neconomies of scale are achieved. An increasing subscriber base is projected based on local \ndemand and tourist arrivals. The FIRR after tax compares favorably with the weighted average \ncost of capital, showing the financial viability of the project. It remains robust against a 10% \nincrease  in  investment  costs,  a  10%  increase  in  operating  costs,  or  a  20%  decrease  in \nrevenues.   \n \n \n25.  Economic.  The capital cost assumed for the economic analysis was $25.19 million \nincluding physical contingencies. The projected costs and benefits are converted to economic ", "7 \n \nvalues by applying a standard conversion factor of 0.9 and a shadow wage rate factor of 0.8.22 \nThe analysis used constant 2015 prices and the world price numeraire. Costs include some \nminor incremental operating and capital costs incurred by the retail service providers (BSCC\u2019s \nwholesale customers) to expand and upgrade their capacity to meet increased demand.  \n  \n26.  The project benefits are assumed proportional to traffic volume. With all existing internet \nusers reasonably  expected  to  migrate to faster  and  more reliable  connections,  broadband \nservices represent a new market segment, with benefits corresponding to willingness to pay. \nThis  is  calculated  as  the  sum  of  consumer  surplus,  and  internet  retail  revenue.  Annual \nconsumer surplus is projected at about 0.8% of gross domestic product.23 Annual internet retail \nrevenue is computed by multiplying the average revenue per user by the projected number of \nsubscribers. The average revenue per user is estimated at 7% of gross domestic product per \ncapita (i.e., $70 per month in 2016).24 \n \n27.  The project\u2019s economic internal rate of return under the base case scenario is estimated \nat 18.8%, well above the ADB social discount rate of 12% per annum. Sensitivity analysis \nconfirms that economic viability is maintained even with a 20% reduction in projected revenues, \na 10% increase in capital expenditure, or a 10% increase in operating expenditures. \n \nC.  Governance \n28.  Financial  management.  Palau  has  a  robust  budget  allocation  framework  for \ngovernment  policies  and  priorities.25 The  Palau  public  auditor  contracts  out  audits  to  an \ninternationally affiliated certified professional audit firm and audits are conducted in accordance \nwith the requirements of the Single Audit Act, 1996. BSCC is a newly established state-owned \nenterprise with no permanent staff, so the financial management risk is assessed as high. \nDuring implementation, BSCC will be supported by the PMU, with an experienced finance and \naccounting specialist to manage its accounting and reporting within six months from the project \neffective date. A comprehensive time-bound action plan has been developed in the PAM to \nmitigate the risk.  \n \n29.  Procurement  capacity.  The  World  Bank  has  funded  MicroPal  to  engage  an \nexperienced team of project coordinators to explore available design options and to prepare for \nimplementation of the most cost-effective solution. The proposed SEA\u2013US submarine cable \nprovides the best option for Palau and Yap to connect to Guam. Palau and the FSM decided to \nengage  SEA\u2013US  parties  to  procure  and  operate  their  respective  cable  systems.  This \narrangement simplifies the procurement process for the cable system in Palau and BSCC. The \nproject coordinators have worked with ADB, and are fully aware of ADB\u2019s direct contracting \nprocurement guidelines and requirements. For landing station construction, ADB will review the \nprocurement  process  and  approve  the  selection  of  suppliers.  BSCC  will  recruit  a  PMU \nconsultant to manage the contracts during implementation.  \n \n30.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \n                                                \n22 This was the shadow wage rate factor used in ADB. 2013.

The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 21). \n \n31.  The Palau National ICT Policy, issued by the government in November 2013, lays out \nthe sector goals, objectives, and strategies for 2013\u20132016. The World Bank-funded TA aims to \nstrengthen  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  ICT  and  address  critical  issues  like \ninterconnection between mobile operators. The ICT regulatory office is expected to be set up \nprior to the submarine cable system coming online. Strong and robust regulation is essential to \nensure that BSCC does not engage in monopoly pricing or other anticompetitive behavior, and \nthat internet retailers do not abuse their market position. ADB will monitor  implementation \nclosely, and TA support (footnote 3) will be provided if needed. The figure depicts the future \noperational structure of telecom players.  \n \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n32.  Palau has achieved most of the Millennium Development Goals.26 Palauans enjoy free, \nor heavily subsidized, and relatively high standards of health services, education, and other \npublic utilities. Building on this solid base of quality public services, the project will provide \nreliable, faster, and affordable internet to the population. It will facilitate more young people \npursuing higher or more relevant labor market qualifications via the internet, reducing the need \nto go overseas to study. In addition, it will improve opportunities for rural and urban households \nto easily connect to families overseas, and increase e-marketing opportunities for businesses, \nas well as enable improved delivery of key government services to the local population through \ne-education, e-health, and e-governance actions. With faster internet at a lower cost, business \nefficiencies and cost reductions will create additional employment opportunities, particularly for \nlower skilled labor. \n \n33.  The project is classified as having no gender elements. However, the project outcome \nwill support (i) women\u2019s improved access to social and financial services as a result of improved \n                                                \n26  United Nations. 2013.

Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The project has been classified \ncategory C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. Due diligence has confirmed \nthat the project does not require land acquisition and resettlement, and does not impact any \ndistinct and/or vulnerable group of indigenous peoples. The cable landing site is on government-\nowned land, and existing networks or rights-of-way will be utilized for the cable extension. The \nproject beneficiaries are part of the mainstream Palauan people.  \n \n35.  Environment.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for  environment.    An  initial \nenvironmental examination (including environmental management plan) and an environmental \ncode of practice have been prepared to ensure compliance with environment safeguards. The \nproject will impact a corridor about 0.30 meters (m) to 0.50 m wide on the sea floor, and in some \nlocations up to 0.75 m beneath the sediment. As it enters the near-shore waters, the alignment \nwill be on the seabed (essentially coral rubble and sand) at a sea depth of 40m to 50m in the \nshipping channel. The landing site will be an existing manhole, outfitted with a conduit running \nfrom  the  shore  into  the  Palau  National  Communications  Corporation  building.  A  detailed \noceanographic survey of the alignment will be completed during the design period, which will \ninclude updating of the initial environmental examination and environmental management plan \nand  integration  of  the  updated  plan  in  the  contract  specifications.  The  PMU  will  monitor \ncompliance. Overall project progress reports will include safeguards and will be submitted to \nADB quarterly. Safeguard monitoring reports will be prepared separately and submitted to ADB \nsemiannually. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n36.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.27 The integrated benefits and impacts are \nexpected to outweigh the costs.  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLimited government experience in  The proposed project is the second ADB project for Palau.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n37.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM \nand loan documents. \n \n38.  The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are \nset forth in the loan agreements and project agreement.  \n \n39.  Effectiveness of the loan agreements is conditional upon the borrower entering into a \nsubsidiary loan agreement with BSCC as described in the loan agreements. No withdrawals will \nbe made from the loan accounts (i) for the main cable supply and IRU until BSCC has signed \nagreements with SEA\u2013US and/or NEC Corporation for construction, operation, and financial \narrangements for the submarine cable system and the IRU; and (ii) for the cable landing station \nuntil BSCC has signed a landing agreement with Palau National Communications Corporation, \nas set forth in the loan agreements. \n \nV.
