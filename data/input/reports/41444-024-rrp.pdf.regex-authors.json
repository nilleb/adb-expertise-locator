THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the additional financing of the Second Northern Greater \nMekong Subregion (GMS) Transport Network Improvement Project.1 \n \n2.  The Second Northern GMS Transport Network Improvement Project aims to provide \nmore efficient transport across the Lao PDR\u2013Viet Nam border and on the project road sections \nof the GMS Northeastern Corridor through the provinces of Thanh Hoa in northern Viet Nam \nand Houaphanh in northeastern Lao PDR.2 It includes two components: (i) improvement of 196 \nkilometers (km) of Highway 217 in Viet Nam and 143 km of routes 6, 6A, and 6B in the Lao PDR \nto all-weather status, and (ii) improvement of road safety on these road sections.3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The GMS Northeastern Corridor (encompassing Nanning in Guangxi Province, People\u2019s \nRepublic of China; Ha Noi and Thanh Hoa in Viet Nam; Louangphabang, the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic [Lao PDR]; and Bangkok, Thailand) is one of the corridors identified in the \nGMS Transport Sector Strategy Study.4 Many of the roads in the GMS corridor have been \nimproved, including the sections of the corridor in northeastern Lao PDR and northern Viet Nam \nunder the current project, to maximize the economic potential of the GMS Northeastern Corridor \nand to provide the northern Lao PDR with year-round access to seaports.  \n \n4.  The current project was approved on 25 November 2010. As part of the Viet Nam \nportion of the current project, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the loan in the \namount of SDR47,450,000 (equivalent to $75 million) from its Special Funds resources. The \nloan became effective on 7 June 2011, with a closing date of 31 December 2016.5 \n \n5.  The  current  project  is  performing  well.  The  implementation  is  on  track.6 Cumulative \ncontract awards were 85.6% and disbursements 41.0% as of 7 October 2015. Disbursements are \nexpected  to  increase  by  the  end  of  2015,  as  high-value  pavement  works  commenced  in \nSeptember 2015. The current implementation schedule to complete the physical works by June \n2016 appears to be achievable, and the need for a loan closing date extension is not foreseen. \nWith regard to safeguards, the resettlement plans and environmental management plan (EMP) \nhave been implemented without major issues. Lapses in the EMP implementation are being \naddressed through agreed remedial actions such as water spraying and installation of mesh net to \nentrap dust in crashing plant and providing personal protective equipment to construction workers. \nThe government has been tracking grievances, and there are currently no unresolved grievances. \n \n6.  The civil works under the current project scope include (i) improvement of the road \n                                                \n1  The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan, Grant, and \nAdministration of Loan to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the \nSecond Northern Greater Mekong Subregion Transport Network Improvement Project.

GMS Transport Sector Strategy Study. Manila. \n5  As of 7 October 2015, the loan amount is $67.65 million due to the fluctuation of the SDR\u2013dollar exchange rate. \n6  Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "2 \nsection from km 104.475 (Ba Thuoc) to km 195.4 (Na Meo border crossing), including new \nbypasses in Cam Thuy and Eo Le bridge at km 38.4 with approach roads; and (ii) pavement \nrepair and resurfacing from km 0 (Ha Trung city) to Ba Thuoc. As the road conditions between \nkm 59.9 (Cam Thuy) and Ba Thuoc have significantly deteriorated during 2011\u20132015 due to \nincreased traffic volume (coming from Na Meo, Ha Noi, and Ho Chi Minh City) and vehicle \noverloading, in May 2014 the Government of Viet Nam requested ADB to consider providing \nadditional financing for full-scale improvement of the road section from Cam Thuy to Ba Thuoc \nrather than simple repair as originally planned. \n \n7.  The fact-finding mission conducted by ADB in March 2015 assessed that the overall \nproject will enhance the outcome of the current project by delivering a technically sound road \nsection from Cam Thuy to Ba Thuoc with higher design speed. This additional financing will \nprovide (i) wider lanes to meet the increased traffic flow, (ii) strengthened pavement structure to \ncarry more loads, (iii) better road alignment to avoid the flood-prone areas, (iv) safer bridges, \nand (v) improved drainage facilities. The mission and the government agreed to eliminate traffic \ncongestion and improve road safety by constructing a new flyover at the intersection at km 0, \nwhere Highway 217 intersects with Highway 1. \n \n8.  In addition to road improvement, the additional financing will support the effort of the \nMinistry of Transport (MOT) to control the overloading on the national road network and to \nstrengthen road maintenance management through (i) reviewing existing governing procedures \nto control the overloading; (ii) purchasing weigh scales and providing on-the-job training for \nMOT staff on the use and maintenance of such equipment; (iii) (after completing the current \nproject) piloting control of overloading on the improved Na Meo\u2013Ba Thuoc road section to \nprevent premature deterioration; (iv) strengthening the governing procedures based on the \nfindings from the pilot demonstration; and (v) monitoring the maintenance works that have been \nprovided for the completed road sections under the current project, and proposing a future road \nmaintenance program for the Na Meo\u2013Ha Trung corridor as a whole.  \n \n9.  Eligibility of additional financing. The additional financing meets the eligibility criteria \nfor  additional  financing  as  the  project  is  (i)  technically  feasible,  economically  viable,  and \nfinancially sound based on the due diligence assessments; (ii) accorded high priority by the \ngovernment based on its approval of the project outline in June 2015; (iii) consistent with the \ntransport development objectives of the current project as it will enhance the outcome and \noutputs of the current project; and (iv) consistent with the country partnership strategy, 2012\u2013\n2015 for Viet Nam, which aims to enhance transport connectivity in GMS countries.7 Additional \nfinancing is a suitable modality, since scaling up the originally planned minor maintenance to \nmajor repair works will result in financing requirements exceeding the original financial allocation. \nThe additional financing allows ADB to respond effectively to the change in circumstances the \ngovernment  is  facing  in  implementing  the  current  project.  This  additional  financing  will \ncomplement the MOT\u2019s effort to sustain its road network by delivering a better approach and \nwork process to control overloading and provide good road services through the provision of \nregular maintenance on the completed road section as discussed in para 8. \n \n10.  This first additional financing for the project is included in the country operations business \nplan, 2015\u22122017 for Viet Nam, and was identified during a project review mission in 2014.8  \n \n11.  Improved readiness. It is planned that the detailed design and construction supervision \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2012.

Manila. \n ", "3 \n(DDCS) consultants under the current project will (i) prepare detailed design of the project road \nsections, (ii) finalize the draft bidding documents for civil works and the request for proposal for \nconsulting  services  for  construction  supervision,  and  (iii)  assist  in  the  updating  and \nimplementation of the resettlement and ethnic minority development plan (REMDP) using the \nunallocated  amount  of  the  loan  proceeds  under  the  Second  Northern  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion Transport Network Improvement Project. This is consistent with the objective of \nADB\u2019s policy on additional financing to promote efficiency gains through timely and seamless \ntransition from project preparation to implementation.9 \n \n12.  A retroactive financing request by the government was approved on 28 August 2015 to \nensure timely commencement of civil works in April 2016. Government funds of up to $14.2 \nmillion, the equivalent of 20% of the proposed ADB loan, can be used to finance eligible \nexpenditure related to land acquisition and resettlement, and advances to civil works contractors \nand construction supervision consultants (CSCs) to be engaged under the project. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The impact and outcome statements for the overall project will remain unchanged since \nthe additional financing will help the current project achieve its development objective. The \nimpact will be increased international trade on the GMS Northeastern Corridor. The outcome will \nbe efficient transport across the Lao PDR\u2013Viet Nam border and on the project road sections of \nthe GMS Northeastern Corridor. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n14.  The project output statement will remain unchanged. The expected outputs of the overall \nproject will be (i) the project components of the GMS Northeastern Corridor in Viet Nam and the \nLao  PDR  are  improved,  and  (ii)  road  safety  on  the  project road sections  of  Northeastern \nCorridor is improved. Through the additional financing under output 1, (i) the road section from \nCam Thuy to Ba Thuoc will be improved, and (ii) a new flyover and approach roads in Ha Trung \nwill be constructed. Through the additional financing under output 2, (i) a road safety audit will \nbe undertaken on the project road sections, and (ii) 12 communes along the project road \nsections will increase their awareness on traffic rules and regulations. The overall project will \nsupport an HIV/AIDS and human trafficking awareness and prevention program, and enable \nwomen to participate in implementation and monitoring of the project activities. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n15.  The overall project is estimated to cost $175.25 million and be adequate to cover the \ncost for the original and extended project investments. The revised investment plan is in Table 1. \nThe detailed cost estimates for the project to be financed by each financier are in the project \nadministration manual (PAM).10 \n   \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2011.

The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR50,440,000.00 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the project. The loan \nwill have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the loan \nagreement. \n \n17.  The financing plan is in Table 2. The additional loan will largely finance road civil works \nand consulting services; resettlement and land acquisition costs, including the taxes and duties \nrelated  to  relocation  of  the  public  utilities;  a  portion  of  contingencies;  and  interest  during \nconstruction.11 The government will finance unexploded ordnance clearance, recurrent costs for \nProject Management Unit 1 (PMU1) of the MOT, a portion of contingencies, and taxes and \nduties of $4.46 million for road civil works and consulting services. The government will also \nfinance future funding shortfalls that may occur during the implementation of the project, in \naddition to costs shown in the financing plan. \n   \n                                                \n11 The amount of taxes and duties meets the criteria for eligibility of expenditures under ADB financing, as (i) the \namount is within the threshold identified in the country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132015 for Viet Nam; (ii) the \namount will not represent an excessive share of the proposed project investment plan; (iii) the taxes and duties \napply to the ADB-financed civil works for relocation of the public utilities; and (iv) the financing of such taxes and \nduties  is  material  and  relevant  to  the  success  of  the  project.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The existing implementation arrangements remain unchanged. The MOT will be the \nexecuting agency. PMU1 will serve as the implementing agency for project activities, and the \nAgency for Land Acquisition and Resettlement under Thanh Hoa Provincial People\u2019s Committee \n(AFLAR) will be the implementing agency for the REMDP. PMU1 will be supported by the CSCs. \n \n19.  The CSCs will (i) supervise quality of civil works; (ii) monitor the implementation of the \ncontractors\u2019 EMPs (CEMP) (para. 36); (iii) undertake monitoring, evaluation, and reporting of \nproject  performance;  (iv)  complete  the  activities  discussed  in  para.  8;  and  (v)  implement, \nevaluate, and report on the HIV/AIDS prevention and anti-trafficking program, community-based \nroad safety awareness program, and gender action plan. \n \n20.  About 507 person-months of inputs will be required, comprising about 53 person-months \nof international consultant inputs and about 454 person-months of national consultant inputs. \nPMU1 will recruit the consulting firm according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time) using the quality- and cost-based selection method, with \na quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20 and following the full technical proposal procedure. \n \n21.  PMU1 will engage an independent financial auditor by using least-cost selection method, \nand a monitoring agency for resettlement, and other consulting services (financed by government \nfunds) by using government procedure. PMU1 will consult and seek concurrence from ADB on the \nterms of reference and draft contract to be used for engaging an external monitoring agency. \n \n22.  PMU1 will use ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time), \nand  procure  two  contract  packages  for  road  improvements  (with  two  lots)  and  flyover \nconstruction using the international competitive bidding method, and five contract  packages for \nutility  relocation  using  national  competitive  bidding.  The  proposed  review  method  and \nprocurement procedure are in the procurement plan. \n \n23.  Use of loan funds for land acquisition and resettlement will require establishment of \nsubaccounts  in  project  districts  in  Thanh  Hoa  Province.  The  fund  flow  and  cash  flow \narrangements are included in the PAM (footnote 9). AFLAR will be responsible for administering \nand monitoring loan funds for land acquisition and resettlement in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time). \n \n24.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n25.  Under the current project, the DDCS consultants completed geological and hydrological \nsurveys and studies. Based on the results, they suggested climate change resilient measures (i) \nadjusting the road alignment in some sections to avoid flood-prone areas, and (ii) using a higher \ngradient on the paved shoulder of road sections passing through residential areas to allow for \nwater drainage to side ditches. These measures are compatible with the local conditions and \nwill enable the completed road sections to remain open to users and traffic in all weather \nconditions. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n26.  Economic. All works under the additional financing are viable; the average economic \ninternal rate of return is 14.9%, and the net present value is $12.5 million at a 12% discount rate. \n ", "7 \nThe upgrading of the segment of Highway 217 from Cam Thuy to Ba Thuoc will provide a better \nroad surface and allow higher speeds, which will reduce travel times and vehicle operating costs, \nand  account for  an  overall  24% reduction  in travel  costs. Traffic  on this  segment  already \nreaches 7,700 vehicles a day in 2015 (85% motorcycles), and would exceed the current road \ncapacity before 2020. The new interchange at Ha Trung will reduce crash risks at the junction. It \nwill also improve traffic flows, preventing degradation of service on Highway 217 and Highway 1, \nwhich is the country\u2019s main road artery (above 20,000 vehicles per day at Ha Trung). Compared \nwith a without project scenario, the interchange will save up to 10 minutes of travel time per trip \nfor all Highway 217 and Highway 1 vehicles. Additional benefits from the avoidance of potential \nfuture flooding on Highway 217 and better safety were not included in the quantitative analysis, \nbut would improve the economic merit of the project. \n \n27.  Financial.  The  project  is  nonrevenue  generating.  Financial  analysis  assessed  the \nMOT\u2019s financial capacity to maintain the project, confirming that it can cover the recurrent costs \nto  sustain  the  project.  As  part  of the  overall  road  sector  reform  process, the  government \nestablished  a  Viet  Nam  National  Road  Maintenance  Fund  in  2012,  financed  from  vehicle \nregistration fees and budgetary allocations. During 2013\u20132014, the fund\u2019s revenue increased \nfrom D6.9 trillion to D8.0 trillion. Since 2012, the government has been providing routine and \nperiodic  maintenance  for  35,509  km  of  national  roads.  In  October  2014,  the  Thanh  Hoa \nProvincial Department of Transport awarded a contract to repair six segments of the road \nsection from km 0 to Cam Thuy. Further, the Viet Nam National Road Maintenance Fund is \nexpected to increase by improving the collection of vehicle registration fees and increasing \nbudgetary allocations to meet the maintenance needs for national roads, including the Na Meo\u2013\nHa Trung road corridor, and thus expected to ensure its long-term sustainability. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n28.  Existing procurement, financial management, and governance mechanisms will remain \nunchanged.  As  a  result  of  having  undertaken  several  ADB-financed  projects  in  the  past, \nincluding the current project, the MOT has extensive experience and a detailed understanding \nof ADB\u2019s procurement and financial management policies and procedures. Additionally, the \nMOT has adequate procurement and financial management capacity. It will continue to use the \ngrievance redress mechanism  and  project  website  established  under  the  current  project.12 \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with \nthe government, MOT, and PMU1. Government risks related to financial management are low, \nand this additional financing will follow established requirements within the current project. The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n29.  The project area encompasses poor areas in Viet Nam. The overall project expects to \ndirectly benefit about 444,000 residents in the project areas (Ba Thuoc, Cam Thuy, and Ha \nTrung) and indirectly benefit Thanh Hoa Province\u2019s population of 3.4 million. Poverty rates in \n2014 were 18.26% in Ba Thuoc, 12.03% in Cam Thuy, and 6.2% in Ha Trung. Based on the \ngovernment\u2019s poverty line of D400,000 per head per month in rural areas and D500,000 per \nhead per month in urban areas, Ba Thuoc is one of the 62 poorest districts in Viet Nam. The \npoor households in the project areas tend to be from ethnic groups and/or have sick, disabled, \nor elderly family members who are unable to work. \n \n                                                \n12 Project Management Unit 1\u2013Ministry of Transport. http://pmu1.vn \n ", "8 \n30.  The project will reduce poverty in the project areas by improving economic opportunities \nfor local producers, including women, through improved access to markets for their products \n(chicken,  ducks,  beef,  pigs,  rice,  and  bamboo).  The  improved  road  sections  will  give  the \nresidents, including the poor, better access to public facilities such as hospitals, schools, and \npeople\u2019s committee buildings, where social services are provided. Women, in particular, will \nbenefit from the improved access to maternal health services. The reduced travel times and \ntransport costs will increase household incomes. The project is categorized as effective gender \nmainstreaming and, through the implementation of the gender action plan, will ensure equal job \nopportunities and equal pay for equal work at construction sites. It includes targets for the \nparticipation of women as community facilitators and as unskilled laborers at construction sites. \n \n31.  Some negative social effects are also possible. However, they will be mitigated through \nproject interventions. All project areas are affected by high rates of HIV infection compared to \nthe national rate of 0.2%: Cam Thuy town\u2019s is 1.2%, Ba Thuoc district\u2019s is 1.08%, and Ha Trung \ndistrict\u2019s  is  0.4%.  Improved  infrastructure  development  (road  and  hydropower  plant)  and \nincreased migrants have contributed to the high prevalence rate. To address the risk of higher \nrates of HIV/AIDS transmission and the trafficking of women and children resulting from the \nsudden influx of construction workers, the project will implement an HIV/AIDS prevention and \nanti-trafficking  program  targeting  80%  of  the  construction  workforce  and  the  affected \ncommunities  using  an  ethnic  minority-friendly  approach,  as  the  majority  of  the  targeted \ncommunities are from ethnic groups. \n \n32.  The improved road connection, combined with community users\u2019 limited adherence of \ntraffic regulations, may cause more road accidents. Thus, the project will use community elders \nand women as facilitators in a community-based road safety awareness program focusing on \nethnic groups and vulnerable groups. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n33.  The project\u2019s social and environmental impacts have been classified as category A for \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  B  for  environment,  and  B  for  indigenous  peoples  under  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n \n34.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. About 1,500 households will be \naffected.  Of  these,  an  estimated  76  households  will  be  required  to  relocate,  while  105 \nhouseholds may lose a significant amount of paddy land due to the proposed flyover in Ha \nTrung district and the proposed realignment in Cam Thuy town and Ba Thuoc district. The \nethnic groups found in the project areas are Dao, Kinh, Mong, Muong, and Thai. Project impacts \nwith respect to ethnic minorities are mostly related to land acquisition and resettlement impacts. \nAn REMDP has been prepared based on the preliminary design of the project road sections to \naddress potential impacts and risks, and it will be updated following completion of the detailed \ndesign. The eligibility of land acquisition and resettlement for ADB financing was determined \nthrough a due diligence assessment and it was concluded that all requirement had been met in \nterms of  (i) the expected productive nature of land to be acquired, (ii) the suitability of land \nmarket conditions, (iii) the adequacy of administrative arrangements to promote the transparent \nand efficient transfer of funds, (iv) the risk profile of the transaction, and (v) the soundness of the \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  arrangements.13 The  capacity  of  staff  involved  in  resettlement \nupdating, implementation, and monitoring will continue to be strengthened by providing the \n                                                \n13 Due Diligence for Use of Loan Funds for Land Acquisition and Resettlement (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nnecessary  safeguards  training  during  project  implementation.  The  project  will  engage  an \nexternal monitoring agency to monitor social safeguards activities and report on a semiannual \nbasis to PMU1 and ADB. All social monitoring reports will be uploaded on the ADB website. \n \n35.  The AFLAR, in its capacity as the implementing agency for REMDP, will monitor (i) the \nuse of loan funds for land acquisition and resettlement by the project districts, and (ii) the \nliquidation of any amount paid from subaccounts in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook and detailed arrangements agreed between the government and ADB. \n \n36.  Environment. Potential environmental impacts could be more manageable because the \nproject  area  has  a  relatively  flat  terrain  unlike  the  ongoing  project  which  is  situated  in  a \nmountainous area. This makes it easier to find suitable spoils disposal sites while reducing the \nrequirements for slope protection and stabilization. The adverse environmental impacts will \ncome largely during construction from dust and noise, surface runoff, erosion, traffic and utility \ndisruptions, potential occupational and community health and safety risks, and disposal of \nexcavated  materials.  An  EMP  detailing  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring  activities  was \nprepared as part of the initial environmental examination (IEE) to avoid or reduce anticipated \nnegative impacts. The EMP also requires each contractor to prepare a CEMP that will include \nthe following subplans on: (i) waste management and spoil disposal; (ii) materials management; \n(iii) drainage management; (iv) erosion control; (v) temporary transport management; (vi) utilities \nand irrigation reprovisioning; (vii) noise and dust control; and (viii) worker and public safety. To \nensure that project execution complies with the EMP, it will be included in the tender documents \nand civil works contracts. Each contractor will be required to submit its CEMP before work \nbegins at the sites. \n \n37.  During  updating  of  the  IEE  in  January  2015,  public  consultations  began  with \nstakeholders, such as local residents, road users, roadside business owners, locally elected \nrepresentatives, and local government officials; the consultations will continue until the project\u2019s \ndetailed design has been finalized. The issues and concerns raised by these stakeholders have \nbeen addressed in the IEE and EMP. The executing agency and PMU1 will be assisted by \nCSCs in monitoring the environmental performance of contractors, and will submit semiannual \nenvironmental monitoring reports to ADB, which will be uploaded on ADB\u2019s website. The CSCs \nwill also conduct capacity-building activities with PMU1 on environmental management and \nmonitoring, including workshops, orientations, and on-the-job training. \n \n38.  ADB\u2019s preliminary screening identified the project as medium risk for climate change. A \nseparate climate change risk assessment undertaken by the government identified project areas \nthat are vulnerable to climate change.14 Increased rainfall and higher temperatures in these \nareas could affect soil moisture dynamics and cause flooding, hence, climate change-resilient \nmeasures, including side drainages, slope stabilization, and road realignment to avoid flood-\nprone areas, have been considered. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n39.  Major  risks  identified  at  appraisal  of  the  current  project  included  the  following:  \n(i) safeguard policies not implemented adequately, (ii) premature damage to the project road \nfrom overloaded vehicles, (iii) project roads not maintained adequately, and (iv) corruption. \nSince  the  ADB  loan,  under the  project,  will  finance  land  acquisition and  resettlement,  the \nfollowing additional risks are considered: (i) distortions to the land market as an efficient means \n                                                \n14 Climate Change Risk Vulnerability Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nof acquiring land, (ii) misuse of loan proceeds intended for land acquisition and resettlement, \nand (iii) inappropriate monitoring and evaluation of use of ADB loan funds. \n \n40.  The  overall  risk  assessment  of the  project  is medium. The  integrated  benefits  and \nimpacts of the project are expected to outweigh the costs and thus the project will have a \npositive impact. To mitigate all the risks in para. 39, the project will (i) engage an international \nenvironmental consultant to help support (a) the full implementation of mitigating measures, and \n(b) the inclusion in CEMPs of the location and description of proposed soil disposal sites and \nbatching  plants,  and  the  various  submanagement  plans  on  unsuitable  soils  and  waste \nmanagement, air quality and noise, water quality, traffic management, and public and worker \nsafety; and (ii) contribute to controlling the overloading and budgeting of annual provisions for \nroad maintenance. Specific to the risks related to the use of loan funds for land acquisition and \nresettlement (para. 39), the following related mitigation measures have been identified: (i) the \nproject will engage a qualified and certified appraiser to conduct the replacement cost survey; \n(ii) the affected persons will be fully informed about market conditions, prevailing land values, \nand their right to have access to the project\u2019s grievance redress mechanism (GRM); (iii) an \naccountant in PMU1 will be responsible for administering and monitoring the use of loan funds; \n(iv) administrative procedures and a list of supporting documents required by ADB and the \ngovernment were discussed during the workshop on \u201cUse of Loan Funds for Resettlement\u201d held \nin September 2015; (v) the GRMs that have been established in Cam Thuy and Ba Thuoc will \nbe strengthened (a GRM in Ha Trung has yet to be established); and (v) the project will engage \nan external monitoring agency to carry out its own monitoring and assessment. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n41.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM \nand loan documents. \n \n42.  The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are \nset forth in the loan agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n43.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  SDR50,440,000.00  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the \nadditional financing of the Second Northern Greater Mekong Subregion Transport Network \nImprovement Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at the rate \nof 2.0% per annum during the grace period and thereafter, for a term of 25 years, including a \ngrade period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n26 October 2015 \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Project is Aligned with:a \n \nCurrent project \nIncreased international trade on the GMS Northeastern Corridor. \nOverall project \nUnchanged. \n \nPerformance Indicators  Data Sources and \nwith Targets and  Reporting \nResults Chain  Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \n       \nCurrent project  Current project     \nEfficient transport  Truck traffic across the  MOT and MPWT  Overloaded vehicles \nacross the Lao PDR\u2013 border increases from 100  traffic statistics  damage the project \nViet Nam border and  trucks per day in 2009 to  road sections \non the project road  220 trucks per day in June  (unchanged) \nsections of the GMS  2016 \nNortheastern Corridor     \nTravel time on project road  Survey reports by \nsections decreases (hours)  project supervision \nby June 2016  consultants \na.
