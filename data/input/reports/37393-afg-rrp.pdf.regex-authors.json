The environmental implications were reviewed and no adverse \nAssessment impact was identified. \nSocial Involuntary resettlement:  Category C \nSafeguard Impact on indigenous people:  Category C \nAssessment No involuntary resettlement or impact on indigenous people is expected \nfrom program implementation. \nRationale Afghanistan  has  made  significant  progress  in  achieving  macroeconomic \nstability since the appointment of the post-Taliban administration in 2002. \nGross domestic product (GDP) grew rapidly, averaging 17% during the past \n4  years.  Post-conflict  reconstruction  has  supported  growth  in  the \nconstruction,  trade,  transport,  and  communications  sectors.  Since  the \nsuccessful currency conversion in early 2003, prices and the exchange rate \nhave remained broadly stable, reflecting widespread acceptance of the new \ncurrency and prudent macroeconomic policies.   \nDespite  strong  economic  recovery  and  progress  made  with  structural \nreforms, the remaining challenges are enormous. Afghanistan is one of the \npoorest countries in the world, with a GDP per capita of $300, and weak \nsocial indicators. Sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction will \nrequire  a  shift  from  reconstruction-driven  recovery  to  private  sector-led \ngrowth. A thriving private sector is also essential for providing alternative \nlivelihood in the rural areas, and thereby to supporting Government efforts to \neliminate the narcotics economy. Expanding the private sector will entail, \ninter  alia,  the  Government\u2019s  disengaging  from  commercial  activities, \nstrengthening the investment climate, improving private enterprises\u2019 access \nto credit, and developing human capital. \nThe Interim Afghanistan National Development Strategy (I-ANDS) embodies \nthe Government\u2019s development objectives for 2006\u20132010. Private sector \ndevelopment is one of the key outcomes envisioned in the I-ANDS.  To this \nend, the I-ANDS includes programs to strengthen the investment climate, \npromote international trade, and develop the financial sector. ", "ii\nThe  initial  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP,  2002)  emphasizes  that \nAfghanistan\u2019s long-term economic development hinges on the growth of a \ndynamic private sector. The initial CSP identifies the weaknesses in the \npolicy  and  regulatory  framework  and  underdevelopment  of  the  financial \nsector as key constraints on private sector development. The Program is \nincluded  in  ADB\u2019s  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update  (2006\u20132008): \nAfghanistan.\nImpact and  The Program aims to promote private sector-led growth by (i) strengthening \nOutcome the enabling environment for private sector development, (ii) disengaging \nthe  Government  from  business  activity,  and  (iii)  improving  the  private \nsector\u2019s access to financial services.  The impact will be a more dynamic \nprivate sector and sound financial system supporting sustainable economic \ngrowth and job creation. The program outcomes will be larger contribution of \nthe private sector to economic activity and improved financial intermediation. \nThe program design builds on the Government\u2019s ongoing reform initiatives \nand complements other development partners\u2019 assistance. \nProgram Grant  It  is  proposed  that  ADB  support  the  Government\u2019s  policy  reforms  by \nAmount providing a grant of $56 million to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. The \ngrant will be from ADF. \nProgram Period  The  implementation  period  of  the  Program  will  be  3  years.    It  will  be \nand Tranching  completed by 31 December 2009 and closed on 30 June 2010. The grant \nwill  be  released  in  two  tranches:  the  first  ($28  million)  upon  grant \neffectiveness, and the second ($28 million) 24 months after Board approval, \nsubject to the Government meeting the conditions specified for release. \nExecuting The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the Executing Agency for the grant. \nAgency and  MOF, the Ministry of Commerce (MOC), and Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) \nImplementation will  be  the  implementing  agencies.  MOF  will  set  up  an  interagency \nArrangements  coordination  committee  headed  by  the  deputy  minister  for  finance  and \ncomprising representatives from MOF, MOC, the Ministry of Justice (MOJ), \nand DAB. The committee will meet every quarter to coordinate and ensure \neffective  implementation  of  the  proposed  reforms.  ADB  will  also  be  a \nmember of the committee to oversee program progress. \nProcurement   The grant proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of \nitems produced and procured in ADB member countries (other than the \nitems specified in the list of ineligible items and imports financed by other \nbilateral  and  multilateral  sources). The  Government  will  certify  that  the \nvolume  of  eligible  imports  exceeds  the  amount  of  ADB\u2019s  projected \ndisbursement under the grant for the given period. ADB reserves the right to \naudit  the  use  of  the  grant  proceeds  and  verify  the  accuracy  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s certification. \nCounterpart The Government will ensure that the local currency funds generated by the \nFunds grant will be used, first, to support the adjustment cost of reforms under the \nProgram,  and  second,  to  finance  expenditures  for  general  development \npurposes.", "  iii\nCapacity- The objective of the capacity-building grant is to assist the Government \nBuilding Grant  implement  the  Program.  Specifically,  it  will  help  the  Government \n(i)  strengthen  the  legal  framework,  (ii)  remove  market  distortions, \n(iii) disengage the Government from commercial activities, (iv) strengthen \nfinancial  intermediation,  and  (v)  implement  accounting  and  auditing \nstandards. The grant will also develop and establish training programs in \nthese areas to help sustain private sector and financial market development \nover the long term. \nFinancing Plan  A capacity-building grant of $4 million will be provided from the ADF. The \ngrant will be subject to conditions set forth in the grant agreement. \nExecuting MOF will be the Executing Agency for the grant. MOF, MOC, and DAB will \nAgency and  be the implementing agencies. MOF will set an up interagency coordination \nImplementation committee  headed  by  the  deputy  minister  for  finance,  and  comprising \nArrangements  representatives from MOF, MOC, MOJ, and DAB. ADB will be a member of \nthe committee to oversee implementation progress. \nConsulting Consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nServices Use of Consultants. A total of 64 person-months of international and 132 \nperson-months of national consultants will be required. \nBenefits and  The  Program  will  help  develop  the  private  sector  through  policy,  legal, \nBeneficiaries regulatory, and institutional reforms to improve the investment climate and to \nstrengthen financial intermediation. A better investment climate will attract \nmore domestic and foreign investments to create jobs. The entry of new \nbusinesses will reinforce competition and result in more efficient provision of \ngoods and services. \nThe development of the financial sector will further boost private sector \nactivity  and  create  jobs.  Private  enterprises  and  households  will  have \naccess  to  more  financial  resources  as  financial  institutions  are  able  to \nmobilize  savings  for  productive  investment.  Improved  financial \nintermediation  will  reduce  the  borrowing  costs  incurred  by  private \nenterprises and households. \nPrivate  sector  development  also  brings  about  fiscal  benefits.  Increased \nprivate sector output will reduce the need for the Government to provide the \nfiscal impetus for growth.  In addition, increased private sector activities will \ngenerate higher tax revenues, further creating fiscal space for expenditures \nto provide social services for the poor. \nSpecific benefits are as follows: \n(i)  By supporting the adoption of a commercial arbitration law, \nthe Program will provide a recourse for settling disputes and \nhelp  reduce  the  uncertainty  and  risks  faced  by  business. \nPolicy and legal measures to establish land ownership will \nhelp improve access to credit by providing assets that can be \nused as collateral. ", "iv\n(ii)  By helping remove the distortions caused by price controls, \nthe Program will allow prices to adjust to market conditions \nand encourage business activity.  This reform, coupled with \nmeasures  to  streamline  business  registration  and  permit \nprocedures, will deter rent seeking associated with evading \nprice  controls  and  securing  business  permits.  These \nmeasures  will  also  enhance  market  competition,  thereby \nlowering the prices and improving the quality of goods and \nservices. \n(iii)  By  helping  liquidate  inefficient  state-owned  enterprises \n(SOEs),  the  Program  will  reduce  state  presence  in  areas \nwhere  the  private  sector  can  be  more  efficient.  SOE \nliquidation will also facilitate the transfer of land to the private \nsector  for  productive  use,  including  as  collateral  for \nborrowing.\n(iv)  By  strengthening  financial  sector  regulation  and  oversight, \nthe Program will enhance depositor protection and reduce \nsystemic risk.  This will, in turn, facilitate savings mobilization \nand enable financial institutions to expand their outreach.   \n(v)  By  helping  adopt  accounting  and  auditing  standards,  the \nProgram will enhance transparency and disclosure of private \nenterprises\u2019  financial  conditions,  thereby  improving  their \naccess to financial services. \nRisks and  Security concerns pose a key external risk to the Program.  A worsening \nAssumptions security situation could hamper reforms as the Government would have to \nfocus its resources on security. Deteriorating security could also impede \nprogram  progress  as  it  would  be  more  difficult  to  attract  experts  to \nAfghanistan to help the Government implement the Program. \nCapacity  constraints  are  the  most  significant  internal  risk  to  effective \nprogram  implementation.  For  instance,  weaknesses  in  the  drafting  of \nlegislative  proposals  by  the  executive  branch  of  the  Government  have \ndelayed some key legal reforms.  To ensure that the legal reforms called for \nunder the Program meet the program objectives, the attached capacity-\nbuilding grant will help the Government draft the legislation and related \nregulations in line with international standards, taking into account country-\nspecific circumstances. The grant will also develop comprehensive training \nprograms for bank supervisors and for banking, accounting, and auditing \nprofessionals to build capacity in these areas. \nVested interest groups could resist certain reforms. To minimize this risk, the \ngrant will facilitate training, consultations, and public awareness campaigns \nneeded to build consensus and solicit stakeholder buy-in. \nGiven the significant donor presence in Afghanistan, assistance might be \nduplicated and ineffective. The Program was prepared in close consultation \nwith  Afghanistan\u2019s  development  partners  involved  in  private  sector \ndevelopment and financial reforms. Continued coordination during program \nimplementation will be required to avoid overlap and to maximize synergies. ", "I.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogram grant to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the Private Sector and Financial Market \nDevelopment Program (the Program), and (ii) a proposed capacity-building grant for Supporting \nPrivate Sector and Financial Market Reforms. \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n2.  Afghanistan has made significant progress in achieving macroeconomic stability since \nthe appointment of the post-Taliban administration in 2002. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew \nrapidly,  averaging  17%  during  the  past  4  years.  Post-conflict  reconstruction  efforts  have \ncontinued  to  support  growth,  particularly  in  the  construction,  trade,  transport,  and \ntelecommunications sectors. Since the successful currency conversion in early 2003, prices and \nthe exchange rate have remained broadly stable,1 reflecting widespread acceptance of the new \ncurrency  and  prudent  monetary  policies.  Fiscal  policy  has  likewise  been  prudent,  with \ngovernment spending kept within budget ceilings. \n3.  The share of agriculture (excluding opium production) in GDP fell from 49% in 2003 to \n38% in 2005 while the shares of industry have increased from 20% to 24% and of services from \n30% to 36%.2 While agriculture remains largely subsistence-oriented, farmers are increasingly \nproducing cash crops for sale in local markets. Agriculture accounts for close to 70% of total \nemployment.  Industry  is  mainly  construction  and  small-scale  agricultural  processing  and \nmanufacturing. Trade, transport, and telecommunications comprise about 70% of the service \nsector. It is estimated that 80\u201390% of all economic activity is in the informal sector. \n4.  Medium-term growth prospects remain favorable, albeit more moderate than in recent \nyears. GDP growth is expected to slow to 12% in 2007 largely due to the ongoing drought.3\nTelecommunications, transport, and trade are expected to continue to expand at a strong pace. \nWhile construction is likely to continue, its pace will be slower than in recent years. \n5.  Despite  strong  economic  recovery  and  progress  made  with  structural  reforms,  the \nremaining challenges are enormous. Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world, \nwith a GDP per capita of $300 and weak social indicators.  To ensure sustainable economic \ngrowth and poverty reduction, Afghanistan will have to shift from reconstruction-driven recovery \nto private sector-led growth.  A thriving private sector is also essential for providing alternative \nlivelihood in the rural areas, thereby helping the Government eradicate the opium economy, \nwhich has grown to record levels in recent years.  Expanding the private sector will entail, inter \nalia,  the  Government\u2019s  disengaging  from  commercial  activities,  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment through legal and regulatory reforms, and improving private enterprises\u2019 access to \nfinancial services.  \n                                                \n1  The inflation rate declined from 52% in 2003 to 15% in 2005. The currency has remained stable over the past 4 \nyears, ranging from AF44 to AF50 per dollar. \n2  International Monetary Fund. 2006. Country Report No. 06/114, Statistical Appendix.

The Private Sector \n6.  Pre-conflict  Afghanistan  had  a  vibrant  private  sector,  with  a  long  tradition  of \nentrepreneurship,  engaged  in  the  production  of  agricultural  products,  small-scale  industrial \nactivities, and trading.5  However, more than two decades of conflict (1979\u20132001) as well as \nstrong state intervention have caused the private sector to contract significantly. Most industries \nwere  nationalized  during  the  1980s.  Traditional  manufacturing  industries  such  as  carpet \nweaving moved to neighboring countries during the conflict, and many businesses were forced \nto close down by lack of inputs. \n7.  Afghanistan\u2019s total industrial production fell by 95% from 1979 to 2002. Private industrial \noutput was hit harder. The share of private sector industrial production fell from 60% in 1979 to \n21%  in  2002,  and  recovered  modestly  in  2005,  reaching  26%.  Private  sector  activity  is \nconcentrated  in  construction  and  services.  Construction  is  thriving  as  post-conflict \nreconstruction continues. In services, the trade and transport sectors dominate.  Enterprises \nengaged in basic services such as shops, tailoring, and repair services are also prevalent.  \nPrivate  sector  activity  has  increased  in  relatively  new  service  sectors  such  as \ntelecommunications and banking.   \n8.  Manufacturing is rudimentary and most factories are concentrated in Kabul and some \nmajor cities like Herat and Mazar-i-Sharif.6 Manufacturing is largely limited to traditional products \nand small-scale activities such as carpet weaving and dried fruit production.  Only a handful of \nmoderately large enterprises and a few medium-sized enterprises are in the non-agricultural \nprivate sector.7 A large part of the non-agricultural private sector consists mainly of informal \nfamily-owned microenterprises engaged in trading and basic services such as shops, sewing, \nand repair services. \n9.  It is estimated that 80\u201390% of economic activity is in the informal sector because of \npolitical uncertainty and the lack of rule of law during the conflict, as well as inefficient business \nregistration procedures and the tax regime. Entrepreneurs in the informal sector typically remain \nsmall, avoiding investments in productive assets or technology that would enable them to \nachieve economies of scale and undertake higher value-added activities. The Government has \ntherefore recognized that the informal sector is unlikely to drive sustained growth over the long \nterm. The Government has also acknowledged that the informal sector serves as a cover and \nbreeding ground for illicit activities and provides opportunities for rent seeking,  \n10.  Historically,  there  has  been  strong  state  presence  in  formal  business  activity.  A \nsubstantial number of large enterprises are state-owned or under state control.  The commercial \nactivities of the 65 state-owned enterprises (SOEs) organized under the Law on State-Owned \nEnterprises (1960) range from public utilities, construction, manufacturing, agricultural services, \nwarehousing, to advertising and printing. State presence in business is also manifested in \nshareholdings by the Government in 13 joint stock companies organized under the Commercial \n                                                \n4  A detailed sector description is in Appendix 1. \n5  Bennett, A, Bruno de Schaetzen, Louis Dicks-Mireaux, Felix Fischer, Thierry Kalfon, and Ron van Rooden. 2005. \nReconstructing Afghanistan.

Four ministries8 have ownership of these companies, which engage in a wide \nrange  of  commercial  activities  such  as  airlines,  telecommunications,  hotels,  textile \nmanufacturing, trading, shipping, and warehousing. A number of ministries also directly or \nindirectly conduct commercial activities such as leasing, production and marketing of agricultural \nproducts, garment manufacture, operation of sports facilities, media, and cement and coal \nproduction.\n11.  To establish the policy framework for SOE divestiture, the Government adopted the \nPrivatization Policy in 2005, reiterating its commitment to privatize enterprises and outlining the \ndifferent privatization and liquidation modalities. The policy designates the Ministry of Finance \n(MOF) as responsible for SOE reforms and privatization.  The Law on State-Owned Enterprises \n(1960) was amended in 2005 to allow private participation in SOEs. The Government issued \nliquidation procedures in 2006, detailing the key steps involved in the disposal of SOE assets. \nOf the 65 SOEs, 56 are targeted for divestiture, and the remaining 9, mostly public utility \ncompanies, are to be restructured and retained as SOEs.  \n12.  The Government has designated the Ministry of Commerce (MOC) to lead private sector \ndevelopment.  MOC is guided by the Cabinet Economic Sub-Committee, and liaises with the 18-\nmember Economic Committee of Parliament. MOC is rationalizing its structure to meet its \nprivate  sector  development  mandate.  The  Government  is  taking  steps  to  improve  the \ninvestment climate for private enterprises.  The Law on Private Investment in Afghanistan was \nadopted in 2005.  The High Commission on Investment, chaired by the minister of commerce \nwas established in 2002 to set the overall policy directions for investment promotion. The \nAfghanistan  Investment  Support  Agency  (AISA)  was  established  in  2003  as  the  High \nCommission\u2019s implementing agency.   \n13.  The Government has initiated tax reforms supportive of private sector development.  The \nIncome Tax Law was amended in 2005 to expand the tax base and streamline the tax regime. \nCustoms  duties  have  likewise  been  rationalized.  Further  reforms  are  ongoing  to  remove \n\u201cnuisance\u201d taxes imposed by various government entities.9 The Government has adopted labor \nregulations governing hiring, firing, and working hours to facilitate private enterprises\u2019 business \noperations.   \n2.  The Financial Sector  \n14.  The financial sector is small, consisting of commercial banks, microfinance institutions, \ncredit unions, foreign exchange dealers, money service providers, an insurance company, and a \nleasing  company  (Table  1).  Commercial  banks  dominate  the  formal  financial  sector, \nrepresenting 95% of assets in the formal sector. Given that much of the economic activity \noccurs in the informal private sector, the informal financial sector is estimated to be at least as \nlarge as the formal financial sector.  \n15.  Since the passage of the Law of Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) (2003) and the Law of \nBanking in Afghanistan (2003), the central bank, DAB, has supervised commercial banks. More \nrecently, DAB has issued regulations for depository microfinance institutions, money service \nproviders, and foreign exchange dealers.10 Insurance activities are supervised by MOF. To \npromote the stability and integrity of the financial system, the Government has adopted the Anti-\n                                                \n8  Commerce, Communications, Finance, and Transportation and Civil Aviation. \n9  There are close to 100 different taxes, and the administrative costs of many are likely to outweigh the revenue \ngains. \n10Under the law, DAB also has regulatory authority over payment system operators and securities service dealers. ", "4\nMoney Laundering and Proceeds of Crime Law (2004) and Law on Combating the Financing of \nTerrorism (2004).  To implement these laws, a financial intelligence unit has been established in \nDAB.\nTable 1: Financial Sector Overview \n(end of 2005) \nNumber  Assets  Assets\nItem (AF million)  (% of GDP) \nLicensed commercial banksa  12  28,985  8.8 \n  State-owned banks     3  11,764  3.5 \n  Domestic private banks    4  10,763  3.3 \n  Foreign banks    5  6,584  2.0 \nMicrofinance institutions    5  499  0.2 \nCredit unions    7  500  0.2 \nInsurance companyb    1  385  0.1 \nLeasing company     1  (cid:127) (cid:127)\nGDP = gross domestic product. \na\n The list of commercial banks excludes one bank which was established in June 2006. \nb\nData estimated as of end of March 2005. \nSources: Da Afghanistan Bank and Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n16.  By the end of the conflict in 2001, the banking system had been reduced to a shell. The \nsix state-owned banks\u2014Bank Millie Afghan, Pashtany Tejaraty Bank, Export Promotion Bank, \nAgriculture Development Bank, Industrial Development Bank of Afghanistan and Mortgage and \nConstruction Bank\u2014were non-operational.  Of the six, only the first three were relicensed by \nDAB. DAB has licensed 10 private banks (5 domestic banks and 5 foreign bank branches), \nbringing the total number of commercial banks to 13 as of June 2006. Despite rapid growth in \nrecent years, the banking sector is small relative to the economy, and bank assets account for \nless than 9% of GDP (Table 1). Commercial banks operate fewer than 60 branches nationwide, \nalmost a third of which are in Kabul. The banking system is heavily \u201cdollarized\u201d, with 77% of \ntotal deposits and 84% of total loans denominated in dollars.\nTable 2: Banking System, end of 2005 \n(AF million) \nItem  Assets  Loans  Deposits  Capital \nState-owned banks  11,674  1,775  2,896  7,949 \nBank Millie Afghan, Pashtany Tejaraty Bank, Export \nPromotion Bank \nPrivate banks  10,763  4,737  7,461  1,629 \nAfghanistan International Bank, Arian Bank, First  \nMicrofinance Bank, Kabul Bank \nBranches of foreign banks  6,548  339  5,866  (cid:127)\nStandard Chartered Bank, Punjab National Bank,    \nNational Bank of Pakistan, Habib Bank Ltd, Bank \nAlfalah\n      Total  28,985  6,852  16,224  9,579 \nNumbers may not sum precisely because of rounding. \nSource: Da Afghanistan Bank.

Loans granted by commercial banks at the \nend of 2005 amounted to AF6.9 billion, comprising only 30% of banking sector assets (Table 2).  \nFirst, the weak operational capacity of the three relicensed state-owned banks constrains their \nlending capacity. Their lending is limited to 15% of their total assets and only 26% of total bank \nloans. Second, a number of private sector banks are focused primarily on selected markets. For \nexample, First Microfinance Bank was established to focus on microfinance, and Arian Bank \nfocuses almost exclusively on trade finance. Third, the five foreign banks have not been lending \nto private enterprises and instead have collectively focused on transactions with embassies, \nnongovernment organizations, development partners, and a few large corporate entities.  Bank \nlending is mostly short term and therefore not conducive to productive long-term investment. \n18.  Despite a steady increase in recent years, bank deposits remain low at 3.6% of GDP \nand  are  mostly  short term.    State-owned  banks,  despite  their  size  and  geographic  reach, \ngenerate only less than 20% of aggregate deposits in the banking sector.   \n19.  Total lending by the five microfinance institutions and seven credit unions account for \n13%  of  the  lending  by  the  financial  sector.  Women  comprise  over  75%  of  microfinance \nborrowers, and more than half of outstanding loans support small retail, trading, and agricultural \nenterprises.  The  Government  launched  the  Microfinance  Investment  Support  Facility  for \nAfghanistan  (MISFA)  in  2002  to  provide  an  umbrella  organization  to  support  microfinance \ndevelopment.  MISFA\u2019s primary role is to provide technical assistance (TA) and wholesale \nfunding to microfinance organizations by channeling aid agency funds. Lending by aid agencies \nthrough MISFA amounted to about $21 million to 160,000 borrowers in January 2006. Although \ngrowing rapidly, microfinance outreach is significantly below the estimated client base of 5 \nmillion.\n20.  The money dealers (hawaladars) have long provided financial services in Afghanistan. \nThey may number as many as 2,000 country-wide and offer a well-organized, convenient, and \ncost-effective system for making international and domestic payments.11They provide a range \nof services such as foreign exchange trading, fund safekeeping, domestic and international fund \ntransfers, and trade finance.  Over 20% of businesses are estimated to borrow from hawaladars\n(footnote 6, page 23). \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n21.  Despite significant progress, much remains to be done to transform the private sector \ninto the main engine of economic growth.  Conflict and civil strife have not only damaged the \nphysical infrastructure but also substantially weakened the institutional basis and human capital \nnecessary to support private sector activity. Private sector-led development will therefore be a \nchallenging and gradual process.  Consequently, the Government will have to prioritize the \nareas of reform over the medium term as well as build human capital to sustain reforms over the \nlong term.\n1.  Lack of Enabling Environment \na.  Weaknesses in the Legal Framework for Commercial Activities \n22.  The  weaknesses  in  the  legal  framework  for  commercial  activities  and  financial \ntransactions are fundamental impediments to private sector development.  First, a number of \nexisting laws are outdated. For example, the Commercial Code was enacted in 1955 and does \n                                                \n11  Estimates vary from 500 to 2000. World Bank. 2003. The Money Exchange Dealers of Kabul. Washington, DC. ", "6\nnot reflect current economic and business conditions.  Second, the absence of an efficient \nmechanism for resolving commercial disputes compounds the high level of uncertainty and risks \nfaced by private enterprises. All business disputes need to be settled in court and there is no \nlegal basis for out-of-court dispute resolution. However, court procedures are cumbersome and \ncostly.  Third,  the  lack  of  legal  basis  for  land  titling  also  constitutes  a  major  impediment. \nSpecifically, lack of clarity in property rights prevents the use of land as collateral to secure \nloans, thereby constraining business establishment and expansion.   \nb.  Existence of Price Controls and Market Entry Restrictions \n23.  The Kabul municipal government has administered price controls on a wide range of \ngoods  and  services  since  1985  to  benefit  low-income  households.  A  2005  International \nMonetary Fund (IMF) survey indicates most goods and services are sold significantly above \nadministered prices, suggesting that the price controls are not binding. Businesses are often \nreported to bribe local authorities to avoid penalty for evading price controls.  The cost of rent \nseeking is passed on to the consumers, hurting the poor the most as goods and services under \nprice control are largely those consumed by them.   \n24.  The Cabinet issued a resolution in April 2006 instructing Kabul municipality to remove all \nprice  controls.  While  this  is  an  important  step  forward,  it  is  essential  that  the  municipal \ngovernment enforce the resolution and that prevailing prices reflect market conditions.   \n25.   Inefficiencies in the business registration and permit system constitute a significant \nbarrier to market entry by private enterprises. In particular, municipal authorities exercise undue \ndiscretion, and the decision to grant or deny business permits is not necessarily based on \nbusiness principles. The lifting of price controls must therefore be accompanied by the removal \nof  market  entry  restrictions  to  prevent  undesirable  sharp  increases  in  prices.  Facilitating \nbusiness formation by removing this barrier would reinforce competition, further lowering the \nprices and improving the quality of goods and services.  \n2.  Need to Accelerate Government\u2019s Disengagement  \nfrom Commercial Activities \n26.  The  majority  of  large  enterprises  are  either  state-owned  or  under  state  control. \nProlonged conflict has caused most SOEs to become nonfunctional or to operate at low levels \nof capacity utilization.  Some SOEs no longer engage in their core business, relying solely on \nrevenues from leasing real estate.  A number of SOEs have historically been vested with \ncollection of certain fees and taxes, and regulatory functions such as licensing and quality \ncontrol of imported pharmaceuticals and petroleum products.  However, the SOEs have not \neffectively performed these functions because they lack human and financial resources.   \n27.  Greater  private  sector  involvement  would  encourage  more  efficient  production  and \ndelivery of goods and services. SOEs have ownership of land estimated at nearly 10,000 \nhectares covering 636 sites. The divestment of SOEs would facilitate the release of land to the \nprivate sector for productive use, and ease one of the binding constraints on private enterprises.  \nWith more land available as collateral for borrowing, private enterprises would have more \naccess to bank credit. \n28.  However, MOF has limited capacity to manage SOE privatization and liquidation. Its \nSOE Department has thus far focused entirely on financial management oversight of SOEs. \nDivesture of SOEs is a new task that will require additional budget and qualified staff. ", "    7\n3.  Underdeveloped Financial Sector and Limited Access to Finance \na.  Remaining Gaps in the Regulatory and Supervisory Framework \n29.  A basic legal framework for financial supervision has been put in place with the passage \nof the Law of Da Afghanistan Bank (2003) and the Law of Banking in Afghanistan (2003).  DAB \nhas issued prudential regulations covering large exposures, foreign exchange positions, capital \nadequacy  requirements,  and  loan-loss  provisioning.  DAB  has  initiated  on-site  and  off-site \nsupervision of commercial banks. However, there are remaining gaps.  DAB has yet to issue \ndetailed regulations and compliance guidelines for banks\u2019 management of credit, operational, \nand market risks.  The adoption of adequate risk management system has become more urgent \nas banks expand credit and extend operations to new business areas. With the entry of five \nforeign bank branches, it is also crucial that DAB develop a structured program of information \nsharing and cooperation with the home-country supervisory agencies.  DAB has no access to \ninformation that will enable it to comprehensively evaluate the financial positions of branches of \nfinancial institutions outside its jurisdiction.  As these branches expand operations, or more \nforeign banks establish presence in Afghanistan, establishing mechanisms for cross-border \nsupervision becomes increasingly important. \n30.  Systemic risk management requires an effective mechanism for monitoring compliance \nwith regulatory requirements and taking enforcement actions if warranted.  DAB\u2019s ability to take \nswift action against distressed banks to mitigate systemic risks is limited by the absence of \npolicies and procedures on conservatorship, receivership, and forced liquidation of banks. \n31.  Building depositor confidence in the banking sector is vital to expanding the deposit \nbase.  This requires improved transparency and disclosure by banks.  While the submission of \naudited financial statements is required under the Law of Banking in Afghanistan (2003), it is not \nenforced as the implementing regulations have not been developed.  Moreover, there is no \nmechanism to disseminate information on banks\u2019 financial conditions to the public.  \n32.  The outreach of the microfinance sector is growing rapidly, with its lending accounting \nfor 13% of total financial sector loans. However, the licensing and regulatory requirements for \nmicrofinance are not yet enforced. The orderly development of this sector requires regulation \nand supervision of microfinance institutions, particularly those that accept deposits. \n33.  The relative inaccessibility of the formal financial sector to the public encourages the \ncontinued use of hawaladars.  However, as registration requirements were introduced only \nrecently, little is known about this sector.  Given that financial transactions with hawaladars do \nnot entail legally binding contracts, clients must be protected through enhanced transparency.  \nBetter information about hawaladars will also help combat money laundering and financing of \nterrorism.", "8\nb.  Absence of Accounting and Auditing Standards  \n34.  Timely and reliable disclosure based on sound accounting and auditing standards is \nessential to improve private enterprises\u2019 access to financial services. Afghanistan has yet to \nadopt accounting and auditing standards and has no legal and institutional framework to set \nthem.  There is an acute shortage of qualified accountants and auditors because of the absence \nof professional associations and of curricula in formal educational institutions.  As a result, most \nprivate enterprises do not keep any accounting records or financial statements. The absence of \nnational accounting and auditing standards impinges on private enterprises\u2019 ability to access \ncredit, as financial institutions are reluctant to lend to enterprises that do not have reliable \nfinancial statements. \nC.  Government Strategy \n35.  The  Interim  Afghanistan  National  Development  Strategy  (I-ANDS)  embodies  the \nGovernment\u2019s development objectives and strategies for 2006\u20132010. The I-ANDS covers a \nbroad  spectrum  of  development  concerns,  including  security,  governance,  rule  of  law  and \nhuman rights, and economic and social development.12 The I-ANDS is consistent with the \ncountry\u2019s commitments to the 2006 Afghanistan Compact, which represents the framework for \ncooperation between Afghanistan and its development partners.   \n36.  The I-ANDS aims to enable the private sector to be the engine of growth, improve \neconomic opportunities for the poor, and progressively eliminate the narcotics economy. The \noverall  strategy  for  economic  and  social  development  is  to  prioritize  interventions  in:  (i) \ninfrastructure  development,  (ii)  institutional  and  human  capacity  development,  (iii)  social \nprotection, and (iv) creation of an enabling environment for entrepreneurship and investment. \nThe  I-ANDS  incorporates  three  programs  specific  to  private  sector  development:  (i) \nstrengthening the investment climate, (ii) increasing international trade, and (iii) developing \nfinancial  services.  Strengthening  the  investment  climate  involves  addressing  infrastructure \nbottlenecks, improving the legal and regulatory environment, and reducing state presence in \nbusiness activities. The Government has prioritized trade liberalization toward WTO accession, \npreferential trade agreements with major trading partners, and customs modernization. The \nprogram on financial sector development (i) aims to achieve a competitive, market-oriented, and \nprivately-owned financial sector; (ii) underlines the need to strengthen financial supervision and \nto restructure state-owned banks; and (iii) calls for clarifying property rights and strengthening \nenforcement mechanisms to allow the productive use of land.  \n37.  The Program will help achieve the Government\u2019s development goals by providing a \ndetailed reform agenda that is in line with the I-ANDS.  The Program will also propose a \nsequencing of policy actions, which is not explicit in the I-ANDS.  \nD.  ADB Operations and Lessons Learned \n38.  The primary focus of the 2002 initial country strategy and program (CSP)13 was to \nsupport reconstruction and economic recovery. Accordingly, the initial CSP adopted a broad-\nbased approach that aimed to build capacity at different levels of government, rehabilitate \nessential infrastructure, and promote social development. Private sector development was also \na thematic focus of the initial CSP, which highlighted that Afghanistan\u2019s long-term economic \ndevelopment hinges on the growth of a vibrant private sector. The initial CSP identifies the \n                                                \n12  Government of Afghanistan. 2006. Interim Afghanistan National Development Strategy. Kabul.\n13  ADB. 2002.

The Program is included in the 2005 \nCSP update.14\n39.  Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance to Afghanistan resumed with the Postconflict \nMultisector Program loan covering the financial, transport, and energy sectors.15  The program \nsupported the introduction of the new currency in 2003, and the modernization of the payment \nsystem through the enactment of a payments law and establishment of clearing and settlement \nfacilities for interbank transactions. Subsequent ADB operations have supported infrastructure \nprojects such as roads, airports, energy, rural development, and fiscal and public administration \nreforms.  ADB  has  supported  the  Afghanistan  International  Bank,16  Afghanistan  Investment \nGuarantee Facility,17 Afghanistan Renewal Fund,18 and Roshan Cellular Telecommunications.19\n40.  Lessons from ADB operations have been incorporated into the program design. A key \nlesson is that effective development assistance requires strong government ownership. To \nensure Government ownership, the Program is formulated to be in line with the Government\u2019s \nown development agenda. In particular, the reform measures called for in the Program are \nclosely aligned with those in the I-ANDS, which embodies the Government\u2019s medium-term \ndevelopment objectives and strategies. \n41.  Significant  capacity  constraints  can  undermine  reform,  and  adequate  TA  must  be \nprovided to implementing agencies. To remove capacity constraints, the Program includes a \ncapacity-building  grant  providing  up  to  $4  million  to  help  the  Government  implement  the \nProgram.  Capacity constraints likewise call for a more gradual phasing of reforms.  The timing \nand the sequencing of the Program\u2019s policy actions, as well as the attached grant, take into \naccount Afghanistan\u2019s capacity-building needs. \n42.  Another important lesson from ADB operations is the need to go beyond technical \ncompliance with policy conditions to ensure that they achieve policy outcomes.  Drawing on this \nlesson, extensive consultations were held with key stakeholders to clarify the rationale for and \nthe underlying development objectives of the reform measures. These consultations need to be \ncontinued during program implementation. Effective program implementation requires not only \nurging the Government to comply with policy conditions but also maintaining intensive policy \ndialogue with the Government and stakeholders to evaluate the continued relevance of the \npolicy measures and to assess their economic and social impact.  \n                                                \n14  ADB. 2005.

This implies the need for strong complementarity between the Program and projects \nsupported by other donor agencies, particularly IMF. The Program was developed in close \nconsultation with Afghanistan\u2019s other development partners.  \nE.  External Assistance to the Sector   \n44.  Since 2001, Afghanistan has received significant support to develop its private and \nfinancial sectors.  ADB has coordinated closely with Afghanistan\u2019s other development partners, \nand the Program is designed to avoid overlap and to maximize synergies.  \n45.  The  Program  complements  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Programmatic  Support  for  Institution \nBuilding, which includes a wide range of structural reform measures.  Specifically, the World \nBank program has supported tax reforms, civil service reform, adoption of the Privatization \nPolicy, and adoption of basic prudential regulations. The United States Agency for International \nDevelopment\u2019s (USAID\u2019s) Economic Governance and Private Sector Strengthening (Phase II) \nincludes  support  for  the  drafting  of  a  number  of  commercial  laws,  and  the  institutional \nstrengthening of DAB by providing in-house advisors. The USAID\u2019s Land Titling and Economic \nRestructuring Project supports the drafting of a land policy outlining the principles and policy \ndirections for formalizing land ownership and improving land use. This project also supported \nthe drafting of the Privatization Policy, amendments to the Law on State-Owned Enterprises \n(1960),  and  liquidation  procedures  to  facilitate  SOE  divestiture.  The  United  Kingdom\u2019s \nDepartment for International Development (DFID) is providing advisory support to the MOC\u2019s \nPrivate  Sector  Development  Directorate,  which  is  responsible  for  promoting  business \ndevelopment services and for disseminating information on government policies and programs \nto  the  private  sector.  The  German  Technical  Cooperation  (Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr \nTechnische Zusammenarbeit [GTZ]) is supporting the institutional strengthening of AISA, the \ngovernment entity responsible for promoting domestic and foreign investment.  \n46.  Starting June 2006, the IMF extended its support for macroeconomic reforms under the \nPoverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). In financial sector reforms, the PRGF focuses \non restructuring or liquidation of the three state-owned banks that were relicensed in 2004. The \nDevelopment Coordination Matrix is in Appendix 2.   \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PRIVATE SECTOR \nAND FINANCIAL MARKET DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n47.  The Program aims to promote private sector-led growth by (i) strengthening the enabling \nenvironment for private sector development, (ii) disengaging the Government from business \nactivity, and (iii) improving the private sector\u2019s access to financial services.  The impact will be a \nmore  dynamic  private  sector  and  sound  financial  system  supporting  sustainable  economic \ngrowth and job creation. The program outcomes will be larger contribution of the private sector \nto economic activity and improved financial intermediation. The program design builds on the \nGovernment\u2019s  ongoing  reform  initiatives  and  complements  other  development  partners\u2019 \nassistance. \n48.  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 3. The development policy letter \nand policy matrix are in Appendix 4. ", "   11\nB.  Important Features \n49.  A key feature of the Program is its two-pronged approach to promoting private sector \ndevelopment.  First, the Program includes policy measures that directly affect the private sector. \nThe Program will help create an environment conducive to private sector growth by providing a \nbasic but essential legal framework for commercial activities. It will also remove price controls \nand facilitate market entry by simplifying business registration and permit procedures.  It will \nreduce the size of the SOE sector and transfer productive resources to the private sector. \nSecond, the Program will help improve depositor confidence in the financial system through \nbetter supervision and disclosure. This will, in turn, help financial institutions mobilize savings to \nmeet the financing needs of households and private enterprises. \nC.  The Proposed Program \n1.  Policy Framework and Actions \na.  Strengthening the Environment for Private Sector Development \ni.  Establishing the Legal Framework \n50.   A clear and comprehensive legal basis is fundamental for private sector development. \nTo address the weaknesses in the Commercial Code (1955), the Government is drafting a core \nset  of  basic  commercial  laws,  including  those  pertaining  to  the  formation  of  business \norganizations.  In  line  with  the  Program\u2019s  recommendation,  the  Government  has  drafted  a \ncommercial arbitration law, which will provide a mechanism for business dispute resolution \noutside the court system.  The draft law is being reviewed by the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) and \nis expected to be submitted to Parliament by early 2007. The alternative dispute resolution \nmechanism will reduce the uncertainty and costs associated with inefficient and lengthy court \nprocedures. To provide the legal framework for land titling, the Program also calls for the \nGovernment to adopt an immovable property formalization law. To prepare the groundwork for \nthis law, the Government is drafting a land policy outlining basic principles and policy directions \nfor formalizing land ownership and improving land use.\nii.  Eliminating Price Controls and Streamlining Business \nRegistration \n51.   The two key market distortions include price controls and the inefficiencies in business \nregistration and permit procedures.  The existence of price controls on a wide range of goods \nand services in Kabul for over two decades has undermined market efficiency.  Moreover, this \nhas resulted in negative externalities associated with rent seeking to circumvent price controls.  \nIn line with the Program\u2019s recommendation, the Cabinet recently issued a resolution abolishing \nmunicipal price controls. To ensure that price controls do not continue to distort the market, the \nProgram calls on MOC to monitor and enforce compliance by the municipal authorities. The \nProgram further recommends that MOC, in coordination with municipal governments, streamline \nbusiness registration and permit procedures to facilitate market entry by private enterprises. \nRemoving this distortion will enhance market competition, thereby lower the price and improve \nthe quality of goods and services. The combination of removing price controls and streamlining \nbusiness registration will also minimize opportunities for rent seeking by the authorities. ", "12\nb.  Disengaging the Government from Business Activities \n52.  Under the Program, the Government will accelerate SOE divestiture through liquidation \nand privatization through asset sales, which entails selling the core business in one package \nand separately selling any excess land not required for the core business.20 The Program \nproposes that the Cabinet approve 2021 out of the 39 SOEs that have been identified by the \nGovernment to be liquidated or privatized through asset sales.  The Program also recommends \nthat MOF establish for each SOE a liquidation committee comprising representatives from MOF, \nthe relevant line ministry, the Ministry of Economy, MOJ, and the General Attorney\u2019s Office. The \ncommittees will be responsible for timely and transparent divestiture of the SOEs. \n53.  The Program also recommends that MOF\u2019s SOE Department be restructured to create a \nunit responsible for managing privatization. This will require the allocation of additional budget to \nrecruit staff. \n54.   Minimizing the social dislocations from SOE liquidation by providing a safety net is a key \nprogram priority. The Program urges the Government to allocate adequate funds for severance \npackages  for  the  employees  affected  by  SOE  liquidation.  The  Program  also  calls  for  the \nallocation  of  budget  for  and  the  provision  of  job  counseling  and  retraining  programs  for \nretrenched workers of SOEs through the National Skills Development Program of the Ministry of \nLabor, Social Affairs, Martyrs and Disabled. \nc.  Improving Private Sector\u2019s Access to Financial Services \ni.  Strengthening the Supervisory Framework for Financial \nInstitutions to (a) Improve Depositor Protection and \nConfidence in the Financial System, and (b) Enable Provision \nof More Services to the Private Sector \n55.  A better supervised and more transparent financial sector will build depositor confidence \nin financial institutions, which is crucial to mobilize savings.  Improved regulation will result in a \nsound financial sector that can efficiently allocate resources and provide services to households \nand private enterprises. \n56. Banking Sector.  Given the growing presence of foreign banks, the authorities must \nestablish a mechanism for cross-border supervision. The Program recommends that DAB sign a \nmemorandum of understanding with home country supervisors outlining clear and workable \nprotocols for information sharing and coordination on issues of licensing, ongoing supervision of \ncross-border establishments, on-site examinations, and protection of confidentiality.22\n57.  The  Program  recommends  that  DAB  introduce  comprehensive  regulations  and \ncompliance guidelines for banks on the management of credit, operational, and market risks.  \nThe guidelines for credit risk management will provide banks with more details on the minimum \nnecessary steps toward sound risk management, including establishing an appropriate credit \n                                                \n20 Given the weak operational capacity of SOEs, these two divestiture modalities are deemed to be the most \nexpeditious.  \n21 Excluding the SOE to be divested under ADB. 2004.

The guidelines for operational risk will prescribe \ndetailed measures required to establish a robust operational environment and an internal control \nsystem, including clear lines of responsibility, segregation of duties, effective internal reporting, \nand contingency planning. The guidelines for market risk will reflect international best practices, \nfocusing on the use of a standardized approach to risk measurement. DAB will also revise its \non-site and off-site examination manuals in line with the enhanced risk management policies \nand procedures. \n58.  The Program supports the establishment of a uniform bank reporting system, including a \ndatabase to enable DAB to systematically assess bank performance. The Program calls on \nDAB to establish a tracking system to manage its enforcement actions.  To manage systemic \nrisks  posed  by  distressed  banks,  the  Program  will  support  the  adoption  of  policies  and \nprocedures on conservatorship, receivership, and forced liquidation. \n59.  To improve transparency and disclosure by banks, the Program recommends that DAB \n(i) issue regulations on the external audit of banks and qualifications of bank auditors and take \nremedial supervisory actions to ensure the timely submission of audited statements by banks, \nand (ii) regularly publish banks\u2019 financial statements on its website. \n60.  The Program will help DAB make parallel efforts to strengthen supervisory capacity, \nparticularly  in  internal  control,  risk  management,  enforcement  actions,  and  back-office \noperations.   \n61. Microfinance  Sector.    The  role  of  microfinance  institutions  in  providing  credit  has \nincreased significantly in recent years. However, the expansion is largely driven by aid agency \nfunds, and unmet demand is significant. To promote the sustainable development of this sector, \nthe Program calls on DAB to adopt and implement regulations on licensing and supervision of \ndepository  microfinance  institutions  to  ensure  depositor  protection.  This  would  strengthen \ndepositor confidence in the institutions, enabling them to mobilize savings to expand their \noutreach.\n62. Informal Financial Sector.  The Program proposes that DAB implement regulations on \nhawaladars covering registration, customer identification, reporting of suspicious activities, and \nrecord-keeping. The regulations will use an approach that is effective, but not excessively \nburdensome to avoid driving hawaladars further underground.  Given the large number of \nhawaladars, the Program recommends that DAB implement these regulations first in Kabul and \nthen in major provincial capitals. \nii.  Enhancing Disclosure Requirements  \nto Improve the Private Sector\u2019s Access to Finance \n63.  A key step to improve private enterprises\u2019 access to financial services is to strengthen \ntheir financial disclosure.  Under the Program, the Government will prepare and submit to \nParliament an accounting law and an auditing law consistent with the International Financial \nReporting Standards (IFRS) and International Standards on Auditing (ISA), respectively.  The \nlaw will apply to public interest entities, which are those that, because of their business, size, \nnumber of employees, or corporate status, have a wide range of stakeholders.  While the \nGovernment prepared the terms of reference for an accountancy board under the Postconflict \nMultisector  Program  (footnote  15),  the  board  is  not  yet  established.  To  ensure  adequate \noversight of the profession, the Program calls for the establishment of an accounting and ", "14\nauditing board comprising representatives from MOF, DAB, MOC, the Control and Audit Office, \nand professional accountants and auditors from the private sector. To support the accounting \nand auditing board, the Program calls on MOF to create a unit, consisting of at least three \nqualified people, to act as its secretariat.   \n64.  In  addition  to  its  oversight  functions,  the  accounting  and  auditing  board  will  be \nresponsible for developing the capacity of the accounting and auditing profession. In particular, \nthe board will develop certification requirements and ethical standards for accountants and \nauditors. The board will establish partnerships with formal educational institutions to provide \ntraining programs and courses in accounting and auditing. \n2.  Program Grant Size \n65.  It is proposed that ADB support the Government\u2019s policy reforms by providing a grant of \n$56 million. The program grant will be from the Asian Development Fund (ADF). The following \nfactors have been taken into account in determining the grant size: (i) the importance of the \nprivate and financial sectors for sustaining economic growth and poverty reduction, (ii) the \nstrength of the Program and the financial and political cost associated with its implementation, \nand (iii) the overall development financing needs of the Government.\n3.  Implementation Arrangements \na.  Program Management \n66.  MOF will be the Executing Agency for the Program. MOF, MOC, and DAB will be \nimplementing agencies.  MOF will set up an interagency coordination committee headed by the \ndeputy minister for finance and comprising representatives from MOF, MOC, MOJ, and DAB. \nThe committee will meet every quarter to coordinate and ensure implementation of the reforms. \nADB will be a member of the committee to oversee the program progress.\n67.  MOF will (i) oversee the liquidation of SOEs and the accounting and auditing reforms, \nincluding the drafting of an accounting law and an auditing law, and the establishment of an \naccounting and auditing board; and (ii) coordinate and monitor the drafting of an immovable \nproperty formalization law. MOC will (i) oversee the drafting of a commercial arbitration law and \n(ii) coordinate with municipal authorities in streamlining business registration processes and \nlifting municipal price controls.  DAB will oversee the financial sector reforms. \nb.  Implementation Period \n68.  The  implementation  period  of  the  Program  will  be  3  years.    The  Program  will  be \ncompleted by 31 December 2009 and closed on 30 June 2010. \nc.  Procurement and Withdrawal Procedure \n69.  The grant proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of items produced \nand procured in ADB member countries (but not of items in the negative list of ineligible items \n[Appendix 5] and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources). The Government \nwill  certify  that  the  volume  of  eligible  imports  exceeds  the  amount  of  ADB\u2019s  projected \ndisbursement under the grant for the given period. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of the \ngrant proceeds and verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. The disbursement of \nthe grant will be in accordance with Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related \nRequirements for Program Loans.", "   15\nd.  Counterpart Funds \n70.  The Government will ensure that the local currency funds generated by the grant will be \nused, first, to support the adjustment cost of reforms under the Program, and second, to finance \nexpenditures for general development purposes. \ne.  Monitoring and Tranching \n71.  The Government and ADB will continue to engage in policy dialogue on sector issues, \npolicy reforms, and other measures during program implementation and on additional reforms \nthat may be considered necessary or desirable. ADB will field regular missions to confirm \ncompliance  with  conditions  for  the  second  tranche  and  advise  on  actions  to  maintain \nimplementation on course. \n72.  The grant will be released in two tranches. All first tranche release conditions have been \nfulfilled. The first tranche ($28 million) will be released upon grant effectiveness.  The second \ntranche ($28 million) will be released 24 months after Board approval, provided that ADB is \nsatisfied  that  the  Government  has  made  sufficient  progress  in  implementing  the  Program, \nparticularly that all the second tranche release conditions set forth in bold in the policy matrix \nhave been met. All the monitorable actions listed in the policy matrix must be taken by the \nGovernment during the program period. While these actions are not conditions for the release of \nthe first or second tranche, they are crucial to achieving the program objectives. \nf.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n73.  The Government will submit to ADB (i) semiannual reports on program implementation \nand accomplishments of the measures set forth in the development policy letter and the policy \nmatrix, which will describe progress made and any problem encountered and remedial actions \ntaken; and (ii) a program completion report within 3 months of program completion.   \ng.  Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n74.  The Government, through MOF, will establish and maintain a program performance \nmonitoring system that will include a database on the status on policy measures and program \nindicators based on the policy matrix and the design and monitoring framework.\nh.  Program Review \n75.  ADB will monitor implementation through regular reviews and progress reports.  Based \non these reviews, modifications and improvements will be considered.  About 6 weeks before \nthe anticipated withdrawal of the second tranche, or such other time as the Government and \nADB may agree, ADB will review the Government\u2019s progress in implementing the policy reforms \nunder the Program set out in the development policy letter and the policy matrix, including \nfulfillment of the conditions for the second tranche release listed in the policy matrix. \nD.  The Capacity Building Grant for Supporting Private Sector  \nand Financial Market Reforms   \n1.  Objectives \n76.

Implementation Arrangements \na.  Capacity-Building Grant Management \n84.  MOF will be the Executing Agency for the grant. MOF will be the Implementing Agency \nfor components I, III, and V. MOC will be the Implementing Agency for components I and II. \nDAB  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  for  component  IV.  The  implementation  agency  for \nComponent VI will be designated when additional needs for advisory support and capacity \nbuilding are identified.  MOF will set up an interagency grant coordination committee headed by \nthe deputy minister for finance and comprising representatives from MOF, MOC, MOJ, and \nDAB. ADB will be a member of the committee to oversee the implementation progress.  The \ncommittee will meet every quarter to coordinate and ensure effective implementation of the \nreforms.\nb.  Period of Implementation \n85.  The  grant  implementation  period  will  be  3  years.  The  grant  will  be  completed  by                        \n31 December 2009 and closed on 30 June 2010.   ", "   19\nc.  Consulting Services and Disbursement \n86.  The grant will support the engagement of consultants, including legal experts, business \neconomists, SOE liquidation experts, bank regulatory and policy experts, commercial banking \nexperts,  and  accounting  and  auditing  specialists.  This  represents  64  person-months  of \ninternational  and  132  person-months  of  national  consulting  services.  All  international  and \nnational  consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  by  ADB  in  consultation  with  the  grant \ncoordination committee. The team of consultants for components I\u2013V will be recruited by ADB \nthrough a firm by quality-based selection (QBS) since capacity constraints pose significant risks \nto  program  implementation  and,  therefore,  quality-based  consulting  inputs  are  critical  in \ncapacity-building  initiatives  and  need  to  override  other  considerations.  The  consultants  for \ncomponent VI will be recruited by ADB as individuals in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procedures for \nRecruiting  Individual  Consultants  or  through  a  firm  by  QBS.  All  international  and  national \nconsultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\n87.  All disbursement under the grant will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (January 2001).\nd.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n88.  MOF will provide quarterly progress reports on grant implementation to ADB within 1 \nmonth of the end of each quarter in accordance with the program performance monitoring \nsystem.  The  Government  will  maintain  records  and  accounts  for  the  grant  expenditure  in \naccordance with sound accounting principles and will have such accounts and records audited \nannually by auditors acceptable to ADB. The Government will ensure that the progress reports, \naudited  accounts,  and  financial  statements  comply  with  ADB's  guidelines.  Audited  annual \naccounts, by independent auditors acceptable to ADB, will be submitted to ADB within 6 months \nof the reporting period.\ne.  Capacity-Building Grant Review \n89.  The Government and ADB will periodically review grant implementation. The reviews will \ninclude evaluation of the grant scope, implementation arrangements, progress of the policy \nreform  agenda,  and  capacity-building  measures.  ADB  will  field  regular  review  missions, \nincluding a midterm review mission, and project completion review missions.  \nE.  Anticorruption Measures \n90.  ADB\u2019s  policy  document  Anticorruption  (1998  as  amended)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed  with  the  Government.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Grants. To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption document are included in the \nGrant Regulations. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the capacity-\nbuilding grant shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the \nrecords and accounts of the Government and all consultants and other service providers as they \nrelate to the grant. \n91.  ADB, together with the World Bank and United Nations Development Programme are \nsupporting the development of a national anti-corruption strategy.  The strategy will help identify \nareas  that  are  most  prone  to  corruption,  sequence  necessary  interventions,  and  define \ninstitutional mandates to effectively implement various anti-corruption measures.   ", "20\n92.  In  addition,  the  Government  has  taken  concrete  steps  to  improve  public  financial \nmanagement (PFM). The Procurement Law (2005) establishes transparent and competitive \nprocurement procedures, and specifies the responsibilities and accountabilities of government \nofficials. The Public Finance and Expenditure Management Law (2005) aims to improve PFM by \nstrengthening reporting requirements and requiring independent audit of financial statements. \nWith  ADB  support,23  the  Government  is  taking  further  measures  to  strengthen  PFM  by \nimproving  fiduciary  controls  and  establishing  an  integrated  public  financial  management \ninformation system. ADB will closely monitor program implementation to ensure that the outputs \nenvisaged under the Program are achieved. \nV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits \n93.  The Program will help develop the private sector through policy, legal, regulatory, and \ninstitutional  reforms  to  improve  the  investment  climate  and  to  strengthen  financial \nintermediation. Improved investment climate will attract more domestic and foreign investments, \nwhich will create jobs. With the entry of new businesses, competition will be reinforced and \nresult in more efficient provision of goods and services. \n94.  The development of the financial sector will further boost private sector activity and \ncreate jobs. Private enterprises and households will have access to more financial resources as \nfinancial  institutions  are  able  to  mobilize  savings  for  productive  use.  Improved  financial \nintermediation will reduce the borrowing costs incurred by private enterprises and individual \nhouseholds. \n95.  Private sector development also brings about fiscal benefits.  Increased private sector \noutput  will  reduce  the  need  for  the  Government  to  provide  the  fiscal  impetus  for  growth.  \nIncreased private sector activities will generate higher tax revenues, further creating fiscal space \nfor expenditures to provide social services for the poor. \n96.  Specific benefits are as follows: \n(i)  By supporting the adoption of a commercial arbitration law, the Program will \nprovide a recourse for settling disputes and help reduce the uncertainty and risks \nfaced by business. Policy and legal measures to establish land ownership will \nhelp improve access to credit by providing assets that can be used as collateral. \n(ii)  By helping remove the distortions caused by price controls, the Program will \nallow prices to adjust to market conditions and encourage business activity.  This \nreform, coupled with measures to streamline business registration procedures, \nwill  deter  rent  seeking  associated  with  evading  price  controls  and  securing \nbusiness  permits.  These  measures  will  also  enhance  market  competition, \nthereby lowering the prices and improving the quality of goods and services. \n(iii)  By helping liquidate inefficient SOEs, the Program will reduce state presence in \nareas where the private sector can be more efficient. SOE liquidation will also \nfacilitate the transfer of land to the private sector for productive use, including as \ncollateral for borrowing.\n                                                \n23 ADB. 2005. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Program \nCluster of Loans to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the Fiscal Management and Public Administration \nProgram. Manila (Loan 2215-AFG[SF] and Grant 0030-AFG(SF), approved on 14 December).  ", "   21\n(iv)  By  strengthening  financial  sector  regulation  and  oversight,  the  Program  will \nenhance  depositor  protection  and  reduce  systemic  risk.    This  will,  in  turn, \nfacilitate savings mobilization and enable financial institutions to expand their \noutreach.\n(v)  By helping adopt accounting and auditing standards, the Program will enhance \ntransparency and disclosure of private enterprises\u2019 financial conditions, thereby \nimproving their access to financial services. \nB.  Risks and Safeguards \n97.  Security concerns pose a key external risk to the Program.  Worsening security could \nhamper reforms as the Government would have to focus its resources on security. Deteriorating \nsecurity could also impede program progress, as it would be more difficult to attract experts to \nAfghanistan to help the Government implement the Program. \n98.  Capacity  constraints  are  the  most  significant  internal  risk  to  effective  program \nimplementation.  For  instance,  weaknesses  in  the  drafting  of  legislative  proposals  by  the \nexecutive branch of the Government have delayed some key legal reforms.  To ensure that the \nlegal reforms called for under the Program meet the program objectives, the attached capacity-\nbuilding grant will help the Government draft the legislation and related regulations in line with \ninternational  standards,  taking  into  account  country-specific  circumstances.  The  grant  will \ndevelop comprehensive training programs for bank supervisors and for banking, accounting, \nand auditing professionals to address capacity constraints in these areas.  \n99.  Vested interest groups could resist certain reform measures. To minimize this risk, the \ngrant will facilitate training, consultations, and public awareness campaigns needed to build \nconsensus and solicit stakeholder buy-in. \n100.  Given the significant donor presence, assistance might be duplicated and ineffective. \nThe  Program  was  prepared  in  close  consultation  with  Afghanistan\u2019s  development  partners \ninvolved in private sector development and financial reforms.  Continued coordination during \nprogram implementation will be required to avoid overlap and to maximize synergies. \n101.  The detailed poverty reduction and social strategy of the Program is in Appendix 7.  The \nProgram will help the Government implement the I-ANDS, which highlights the importance of \nthe private sector in attaining sustainable economic growth.  The Program is pro-poor in its \ndirect effect on creating business and jobs through private sector development.  Providing a \nsocial safety net for workers affected by the liquidation of SOEs is a key program priority.  No \ninvoluntary  resettlement  or  impact  on  indigenous  peoples  is  expected  from  program \nimplementation (category C). Overall, the environmental implications of Program were assessed \nand no significant adverse impact was identified. The Program is under category C in ADB\u2019s \nenvironment classification system. \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n102.  Without limiting the scope, identified assurances in addition to the standard assurances \nand the policy conditions set forth in the Policy Matrix, will include: ", "22\n(i)  The Government will advise ADB of the outcomes of policy discussions with \nother  multilateral  or  bilateral  agencies  that  have  implications  for  the \nimplementation of the Program. \n(ii)  The policies adopted and actions taken prior to the date of the Program Grant \nAgreement, as described in the development policy letter (including the policy \nmatrix), will continue in effect during the Program period and subsequently.  \n(iii)  The Government will promptly adopt the other policies and take the other actions \nincluded in the Program, as specified in the development policy letter (including \nthe policy matrix), and ensure that such policies and actions will continue in effect \nfor the duration of the Program and subsequently. \n(iv)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  sufficient  counterpart  staff  and  financing, \nneeded  to  implement  the  objectives  of  the  capacity-building  grant,  shall  be \nprovided.\n(v)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  in  carrying  out  the  policy  measures  and \nactivities included in the policy matrix, due consideration shall be given to the \nfindings and recommendations provided under the capacity-building grant. \nB.  Conditions for Grants Effectiveness \n103.  The  following  are  additional  conditions  for  the  effectiveness  of  the  program  grant \nagreement  (i)  the  capacity-building  grant  agreement  will  have  become  effective,  (ii)  the \nGovernment will have approved the liquidation or privatization through asset sales of 10 SOEs \n(excluding the SOEs to be divested under the Agriculture Sector Program), and (iii) MOF will \nhave appointed the liquidation committees for the 10 SOEs to implement their liquidation or \nprivatization through asset sales. The effectiveness of the program grant agreement will be a \ncondition of the effectiveness of the capacity-building grant agreement. \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n104.  I am satisfied that the proposed grants would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n(i)  the grant of $56,000,000 to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources,  for  the  Private  Sector  and  Financial  Market \nDevelopment Program, and \n(ii)  the  grant  of  $4,000,000  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Afghanistan,  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds Resources, for the Capacity Building Grant for Private Sector and \nFinancial Market Reforms  \non the terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nGrant Agreements presented to the Board. \nHaruhiko Kuroda \n      President \n22 November 2006", "Appendix 1    23\nSECTOR ANALYSIS:  PRIVATE SECTOR AND FINANCIAL SECTOR \nA.  Description of the Private Sector \n1.  Pre-conflict Afghanistan had a vibrant private sector engaged mainly in the production of \nagricultural products, small-scale industrial activities, and trading.1 However, more than two \ndecades of conflict (1979\u20132001) as well as strong state intervention have caused the private \nsector to contract significantly. Most industries were nationalized during the 1980s. Traditional \nmanufacturing industries, such as carpet weaving, moved to neighboring countries during the \nconflict, and many businesses were forced to close down due to lack of inputs. Moreover, \nconflict resulted in the depletion of the country\u2019s physical capital.   \n2.  Afghanistan\u2019s total industrial production fell by 95% between 1979 and 2002. Private \nindustrial output was hit harder, and its share in industrial production fell from 60% in 1979 to \n21% in 2002, and recovered modestly in 2005 reaching 26%. Private sector activities are \nconcentrated  in  construction  and  services.  Construction  is  thriving  as  post-conflict \nreconstruction  continues.  In  services,  trade  and  transport  sectors  dominate.    Enterprises \nengaged in basic services, such as shops, tailoring and repair services are also prevalent.  In \naddition, there is increased private sector activity in relatively new services sectors such as \ntelecommunications and banking.   \n3.  There is limited current information on the state of manufacturing activity in Afghanistan.  \nResults of the 2005 World Bank\u2019s Afghanistan Investment Climate Survey indicate a gradual \nrecovery in the manufacturing sector. Surveyed firms indicate substantial growth in employment \n(67% between 2001 and 2005) and capacity utilization (10% between 2004 and 2005.  Median \noutput per worker in Afghanistan is higher compared with Tajikistan and Uzbekistan but only a \nthird of those in India or Pakistan.  Capacity utilization by surveyed firms in Afghanistan is \nslightly lower than those in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan (Table A1.1). \nTable A1.1:  Selected Manufacturing Statistics \nMedian Output per Worker  Average Capacity Utilization \n($ for manufacturing firms with  for Manufacturing Industry \nCountry  less than 100 workers)  (%)\nAfghanistan  3,333  62 \nIndia  9,146  78 \nPakistan  10,043  (cid:127)\nTajikistan  1,859  91 \nUzbekistan  567  73 \nSource:  World Bank. 2005. The Investment Climate Survey of Afghanistan. Washington, DC. \n4.   There are only a handful of moderately large enterprises and a few medium enterprises \nin the non-agricultural private sector.2 A large part of the non-agricultural private sector consists \nof very small mainly informal family-owned micro enterprises, engaged in trading and basic \nservices, such as shops, sewing, and repair services. It is estimated that 80\u201390% of economic \nactivity is in the informal sector. The large degree of informality stems from political uncertainty \nand lack of rule of law during the period of conflict.  Inefficient business registration procedures \n                                                \n1  Bennett, A, Bruno de Schaetzen, Louis Dicks-Mireaux, Felix Fischer, Thierry Kalfon, and Ron van Rooden. 2005. \nReconstructing Afghanistan. Washington, DC: International Monetary Fund. \n2  World Bank. 2005.  The Investment Climate in Afghanistan. Washington DC (p. 7). ", "2244 Appendix 1\nand tax regime also contribute to the existence of the informal sector. Entrepreneurs in the \ninformal sector typically remain small, avoiding investments in productive assets or technology \nthat would enable them to achieve economies of scale and undertake higher value added \nactivities. The Government has therefore recognized that the informal sector is unlikely to drive \nsustained growth over the long term. The Government has also acknowledged that the informal \nsector serves as a cover and breeding ground for illicit activities and provides opportunities for \nrent seeking. \nB.  Legal and Institutional Frameworks for Private Sector \n5.  Commercial transactions are governed by the Commercial Code of 1955, which is based \non Turkish law dating back to the early 1900s.  There are also no laws to regulate mortgages \nand the use of negotiable instruments such as checks and promissory notes.  Commercial \ncourts exist but are too weak to effectively resolve commercial disputes. There are also no \navenues of alternative dispute resolution such as arbitration or mediation.   \n6.  To  promote  the  development  of  the  formal  private  sector,  the  Government  has \ndesignated the Ministry of Commerce (MOC) to be the lead ministry responsible for private \nsector development.  In this role, MOC is guided by the Cabinet Economic Sub-Committee, and \nliaises with the 18-member Economic Committee of the Parliament. MOC is in the process of \nrationalizing its structure to be able to effectively meet its private sector development mandate.  \nIn addition, the Government is taking steps to improve the investment climate.  The Law on \nPrivate Investment in Afghanistan was adopted in 2005.  The High Commission on Investment, \nchaired by the Minister of Commerce was established in 2002 to set the overall policy directions \nfor investment promotion. The Afghanistan Investment Support Agency was also established in \n2003 as the High Commission\u2019s implementing agency.   \n7.  The Government has also initiated tax reforms supportive of private sector development.  \nThe Income Tax Law was amended in 2005 to expand the tax base and streamline the tax \nregime. Customs duties have likewise been rationalized. Further tax reforms are ongoing to \nremove \u201cnuisance\u201d taxes imposed by various government entities.3 In addition, the Government \nhas adopted labor regulations governing hiring, firing, and working hours to facilitate private \nenterprises\u2019 business operations.   \nC.  State-Owned Enterprises and Other Government Commercial Activity \n8.  Historically,  there  has  been  strong  state  presence  in  formal  business  activity.  A \nsubstantial number of large enterprises are state-owned or under state control.  The commercial \nactivities of the 65 state-owned enterprises (SOEs) organized under the Law on State-Owned \nEnterprises (1960) range from public utilities, construction, manufacturing, agricultural services, \nwarehousing, to advertising and printing. State presence in business is also manifested in share \nholdings  by  the  Government  in  13  joint  stock  companies  (JSCs)  organized  under  the \nCommercial Code (1955).   Four ministries4 have ownership of these JSCs that engage in a \nwide  range  of  commercial  activities  such  as  airlines,  telecommunications,  hotels,  textile \nmanufacturing,  trading,  shipping  and  warehousing.  A  number  of  ministries  also  directly  or \nindirectly conduct commercial activities such as leasing, production and marketing of agricultural \n                                                \n3  There are close to 100 different taxes, and the administrative costs of many of these taxes are likely to outweigh \nthe revenue gains. \n4  Commerce, Communications, Finance, and Transportation and Civil Aviation.

To establish the policy framework for SOE divestiture, the Government adopted the \nPrivatization Policy in 2005 reiterating its commitment to privatize, and outlining the different \nprivatization and liquidation modalities. The Privatization Policy also designates the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF) as the main ministry responsible for SOE reforms and privatization.  The Law on \nState-Owned Enterprises (1960) was amended in 2005 to allow private participation in SOEs. \nLikewise, the Government issued liquidation procedures in 2006 detailing the key step involved \nin  the  disposal  of  SOE  assets.  Of  the  65  SOEs,  56  are  targeted  for  divestiture,  and  the \nremaining 9, mostly public utility companies, are to be restructured and retained as SOEs.  \nD.  Description of the Financial Sector \n10.  The  financial  sector  in  Afghanistan  is  small,  consisting  of  commercial  banks, \nmicrofinance institutions, credit unions, foreign exchange dealers, money service providers, an \ninsurance company and a leasing company.  Commercial banks dominate the formal financial \nsector, representing 95% of assets in the formal sector. Given that much of the economic \nactivity occurs in the informal private sector, the informal financial sector is estimated to be at \nleast large as the formal financial sector. Since the passage of the Law of Da Afghanistan Bank \n(2003) and Law of Banking in Afghanistan (2003), the central bank, Da Afghanistan Bank \n(DAB), has supervised commercial banks. More recently, DAB has also issued regulations for \ndepository microfinance institutions, money service providers, and foreign exchange dealers.5\n11.  By the end of the conflict in 2001, the banking system in Afghanistan was virtually a \nshell.  The  six  state-owned  banks\u2013Bank  Millie  Afghan,  Pashtany  Tejaraty  Bank,  Export \nPromotion Bank, Agriculture Development Bank, Industrial Development Bank of Afghanistan \nand Mortgage and Construction Bank\u2013were non-operational.  Of the six, only the first three were \nrelicensed by DAB with the remaining banks targeted for liquidation. In addition, DAB has \nlicensed 10 private banks (5 domestic banks and 5 foreign bank branches), bringing the total \nnumber of commercial banks to 13 as of June 2006. Total bank assets grew by 50% during the \nlast three quarters of 2005, with more than half of this coming from new private banks. Despite \nrapid growth, the banking system is still very small with banking assets, accounting for only \nabout 8.8% of GDP in end-2005. Commercial banks operate less than 60 branches nationwide, \nalmost a third of which are in Kabul. The banking system is heavily dollarized, with 77% of total \ndeposits and 84% of total loans denominated in dollars (Table A1.2). \n                                                \n5  Under the law, DAB also has authority over payment system operators and securities service dealers.

Loans granted by the commercial banks at \nend-2005  amounted  to  AF6.9  billion,  comprising  only  30%  of  banking  sector  assets                      \n(Table A1.3).  Rather than lending, banks are investing in other financial assets offshore. There \nare several reasons for this.  First, the weak operational capacity of the three relicensed state-\nowned banks constrains their lending capacity. Lending by these banks is limited to 15% of their \ntotal assets, and only 26% of total loans of the banking system. Second, most private sector \nbanks are focused primarily on selected markets. For example, First Microfinance Bank was \nestablished to focus specifically on microfinance and Arian Bank focuses almost exclusively on \ntrade  finance.  Third,  the  five  branches  of  foreign  banks  have  not  been  lending  to  private \nenterprises,  and  instead  have  collectively  focused  on  transactions  with  embassies, \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  development  partners,  and  a  few  large  corporate \nentities.  Bank lending is mostly short-term and therefore not conducive to productive long-term \ninvestment.\nTable A1.3:  Net Loans of the Banking System \n(AF million) \nItem      Mar 2005   Jun 2005  Sep 2005  Dec 2005 \nState-Owned Banks   1,051.4 1,233.3 1,588.0 1,775.0\n     (36.7)    (29.5)     (29.2)     (25.9)\nPrivate Banks   1,551.9        2,604.1 3,061.0 4,737.0\n     (54.2)     (62.3)     (56.2)     (69.1)\nForeign Bank Branches      262.0    344.1   798.2   339.0\n       (9.1)        (8.2)    (14.7)      (4.9)\nBanking Systema  2,865.0 4,181.3 5,444.0 6,852.0\n   (100.0)   (100.0)   (100.0)   (100.0)\nNote: The figures in parentheses are the shares of the banking group to total banking net loans.

Despite a steady increase in recent years, bank deposits remain low at 3.6% of GDP \nand  are  mostly  short  term.  State-owned  banks,  despite  their  size  and  geographic  reach, \ngenerate only less than 20% of aggregate deposits in the banking sector (Table A1.4).   \n14.  There are five microfinance institutions and seven deposit-taking credit unions operating \nin Afghanistan. Collectively, these institutions account for about 13% of total credit provided by \nthe formal financial sector. At end-2005 the five credit unions had about 105,000 members with \ncollective deposits of 130 million Afghani, equivalent to an average deposit of $25 per member.  \nWomen  comprise  over  three-quarters  of  microfinance  borrowers,  and  more  than  half  of \noutstanding microfinance loans support small retail, trading and agricultural enterprises. The \nMicrofinance Investment Support Facility for Afghanistan (MISFA) was established in 2002 to \nprovide an umbrella organization to support microfinance development. There are over 25 \nNGOs, donors and other international organizations active through MISFA, which provides \ntechnical assistance and wholesale funding for microfinance. Lending under MISFA amounted \nto about $21 million to 160,000 borrowers in January 2006.   \n15.  Although growing rapidly, the microfinance sector\u2019s outreach is limited. MISFA estimates \ntotal market for microfinance lending at approximately five million people. In addition to weak \ncapacity  of  microfinance  institutions,  security  concerns  continue  to  constrain  microfinance \noutreach.\n16.  The money dealers, referred to as hawaladars, have long existed in Afghanistan. These \nproviders of financial services, which may number as many as 2,000 country-wide, offer a well-\norganized,  convenient,  and  cost  effective  system  for  making  international  and  domestic \npayments.6They provide a range of financial services such as foreign exchange trading, funds \nsafe keeping, domestic and international fund transfers, and trade finance.  It is estimated that \nover 20% of businesses borrow from hawaladars (footnote 2, page 23). \n17.  The hawaladars participate, along with financial institutions, in DAB\u2019s foreign exchange \nauctions.  Prior to introduction of the new currency in 2003, the hawaladars played a key role in \nproviding the local currency required for government expenditures through purchase of dollars \nprovided by donor agencies and auctioned by DAB.

Hawaladars\ncontinue to be used by international agencies for payments services. Over time, the growth of \nthe banking system and an efficient electronic payment system will provide viable alternatives to \nthe informal hawala system, however, for the foreseeable future these providers of informal \nremittance services will be an integral part of financial activities. \n18.  Virtually all international remittances are routed through one of the Kabul dealers, which \ncollectively  account  for  the  vast  majority  of  hawala  payments.  Approximately  200  foreign \nexchange dealers and money service providers have been registered, which is viewed as \nsufficient to cover the bulk of the volume and value of transactions. However, it is too soon to \ndetermine whether the reporting requirements will be effective. A key challenge for DAB will be \nverifying the reporting and record-keeping of registered hawaladars in a cost-effective manner.  \nE.  Legal, Supervisory, and Institutional Frameworks for Financial Sector \n19.  When the Taliban regime fell in 2001, DAB and the state-owned banks operated under \nthe 1994 Law on Money and Banking with the primary objectives of directing credit to various \nSOEs. The Law of Da Afghanistan, enacted in 2003, established the legal independence of \nDAB.  DAB\u2019s primary mandate is to achieve and maintain price stability. DAB is also responsible \nfor promoting the soundness and the stability of the financial system and payments system.  \nThe Law of Banking in Afghanistan was also enacted in 2003 to provide the basic framework for \nthe operation of banks in the country.  Based on these two laws, DAB has issued basic \nregulations  on  licensing,  corporate  governance,  prohibited  and  authorized  activities,  large \nexposures,  lending  to  related  persons,  liquidity,  open  foreign  exchange  positions,  capital \nadequacy to asset classification and loan loss provisioning.  Over the past 12 months, DAB has \nalso (i) developed an on-site bank examination manual and procedures, (ii) completed on-site \nexamination  of  five  banks,  (iii) initiated  an  off-site  monitoring  program,  and  (iv)  conducted \nactions to enforce compliance to DAB regulations on reserve requirements and open foreign \nexchange positions. \n20.  To  promote  the  stability  and  integrity  of  the  financial  system,  the  Government  has \nadopted the Anti-Money Laundering and Proceeds of Crime Law (2004) and Law on Combating \nthe Financing of Terrorism (2004).  To implement these laws, a financial intelligence unit has \nalso been established in DAB. \n21.  The Law of Banking in Afghanistan (2003) provides that DAB may apply part or all of the \nrequirements of the Law to depository microfinance institutions.  DAB has recently issued \nminimum  prudential  and  reporting  requirements  for  them.    In  2006,  DAB  also  adopted \nregulations on money service providers and foreign exchange dealers. The regulations cover, \namong others, registration, customer identification, reporting of suspicious activities and record-\nkeeping.\n22.  The insurance sector is supervised by MOF.  The Law on Insurance was amended in \n2005  to  remove  the  monopoly  by  the  Afghanistan  National  Insurance  Company.  A \ncomprehensive set of procedures has been developed to regulate the industry in line with \ninternational practice.\n23.  There are currently no regulations on leasing in Afghanistan.

Development Policy Letter \nSubject: Private Sector and Financial Market Development Program  \nMr. Haruhiko Kuroda \nPresident\nAsian Development Bank \nManila, Philippines \nDear Mr. Kuroda, \nThe Government of Afghanistan is strongly committed to pursuing structural reforms to promote \nsustainable economic growth and the welfare of the Afghan people. Since the fall of the Taliban \nregime  and  the  establishment  of  this  Government,  we  have  made  significant  progress  in \nachieving  political  and  macroeconomic  stability.  Building  on  these  achievements,  the \nGovernment seeks to further transform the economy that will allow the shift from reconstruction-\ndriven recovery to private sector-led sustainable development.   \nFollowing extensive consultation with stakeholders, the Government has adopted the Interim \nAfghanistan National Development Strategy (I-ANDS).  I-ANDS embodies the Government\u2019s \ndevelopment objectives and strategies for the period 2006\u20132010. Private sector development is \none of the key outcomes envisioned in the I-ANDS as it is essential for sustainable economic \ngrowth and employment generation. A thriving private sector is also essential for providing \nalternative livelihood in the rural areas, thereby supporting the Government\u2019s efforts to eradicate \nthe narcotics economy. In addition, it will allow the Government to generate revenues that will \nprovide more services, particularly, for the poor. \nThe task ahead is formidable.  Years of conflict devastated Afghanistan\u2019s industrial capacity and \nthe  previously  thriving  private  sector  was  substantially  weakened.  At  its  current  state, \nAfghanistan\u2019s private sector has neither the capacity nor the resources to be a growth catalyst. \nThe financial sector likewise remains nascent, and does not yet play a meaningful role in \npromoting private sector development.  \nThe Government\u2019s medium-term reform efforts will focus on creating an enabling environment \nfor entrepreneurship and investment, reducing state presence in areas where the private sector \nwould be more efficient, and improving private enterprises\u2019 access to credit.  Developing the \nhuman  capital  base  will  also  be  fundamental  to  ensure  sustainable  development  of  these \nsectors.  In line with this, the Government, with the support the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nwill undertake the Private Sector and Financial Market Development Program (the Program).   \nThe Program will focus on the following areas:  \nA.  Strengthening the Enabling Environment for Private Sector Development \nThe weaknesses in the legal framework for commercial activities and financial transactions are \na fundamental impediment to private sector development.  A number of existing laws required \nfor private sector development are outdated.  For example, the Commercial Code was enacted \nin 1955 and does not reflect current economic and business conditions in Afghanistan. The \nabsence of an efficient mechanism for resolving commercial disputes compounds the high level \nof uncertainty and risk faced by private enterprises.  The absence of a legal basis for land titling ", "Appendix  4 37\nalso constitutes a major impediment. Specifically, lack of clarity in property rights prevents the \nuse of land as collateral to secure loans, thereby constraining business establishment and \nexpansion.   Under the Program, Government will prioritize legal reforms aimed at addressing \nthese weaknesses. \nThe Government is aware that price controls and inefficiencies in the business registration \nprocedures undermine private sector growth.  The Government has recently issued a resolution \nabolishing price controls, and will take measures to ensure that municipal authorities enforce the \nresolution. While improving licensing procedures at the national level, the Government will also \nstreamline  the  business  permit  system  at  the  municipal  level  which  mainly  affects  small \nbusinesses.  \nB.  Disengaging the Government from Business Activities \nThe Government recognizes that for Afghanistan to successfully transition to market economy, \nthe state\u2019s involvement in business activities needs to be curtailed.  Several years of central \nplanning has resulted in the concentration of resources in state-owned enterprises (SOEs), \nwhich are either nonfunctional or operate at low levels of capacity utilization. The divestment of \nSOEs will facilitate the release of land to the private sector for productive use, and ease the \nprivate enterprises\u2019 binding access to land constraint.  This will also improve private enterprises\u2019 \naccess to financing with more land available as collateral for borrowing. \nThe  Government\u2019s  resolve  to  disengage  from  business  activities  is  underlined  in  the \nPrivatization Policy adopted in 2005.  To facilitate this process, the Government has adopted \namendments  to  the  State-owned  Enterprises  Law,  and  has  issued  detailed  liquidation \nprocedures.  The Government has identified 56 of the 65 SOEs to be targeted for divestiture \nthrough  various  modalities  including  liquidation,  privatization  through  asset  sales,1\ncorporatization  and  sales  of  shares,  management  contracts,  long-term  leases  and  joint \nventures, while the remaining nine, mostly public utilities, are to be restructured and retained as \nSOEs.  Over the next 3 years, the Government will take measures to accelerate the divesture of \nSOEs in a fair and transparent manner.\nThe Government is aware that the capacity of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to manage the \nprivatization process is limited.  The Government will strengthen its institutional capacity to \nimplement the divesture of SOEs by restructuring and building capacity in the SOE Department \nof MOF.  To this end, the Government will allocate adequate budget for staff recruitment and \ntraining.\nTo ensure that social safety net is provided to workers affected by the liquidation of SOEs, the \nGovernment will allocate a budget to support severance packages. The Government will also \nallocate sufficient budget and will provide job counseling and retraining programs for retrenched \nworkers of SOEs through the National Skills Development Program of the Ministry of Labor, \nSocial Affairs, Martyrs and Disabled. \nC.  Improving the Private Sector\u2019s Access to Financial Services \nThe  Government  recognizes  that  to  enable  the  financial  sector  to  provide  better  financial \nservices to private enterprises, it is crucial that the banking system is sound and that depositors \nare protected.  The banking system as such must be adequately supervised and meet proper \n                                                \n1 Privatization through asset sales is selling the core business in one package and selling any excess land not \nrequired for the core business are separately. ", "38 Appendix 4 \ntransparency and disclosure requirements.  Greater confidence in the banking system will allow \nbanks to mobilize domestic savings to meet the financing needs of private enterprises. The \nbanking system also needs human resources to effectively deliver services to both households \nand private business.\nGiven the growing presence of foreign banks in Afghanistan, it is crucial that the authorities \nestablish an effective mechanism for cross-border supervision. Under the Program, the Da \nAfghanistan Bank (DAB) will sign a memorandum of understanding with relevant home country \nsupervisors outlining: clear and workable protocols for information sharing and coordination on \nissues of licensing, ongoing supervision of cross-border establishments, on-site examinations, \nand protection of confidentiality. \nTo mitigate systemic risk in the banking, DAB will initially adopt regulation on minimum risk \nmanagement requirements for banks, and gradually introduce more  detailed guidelines for \nbanks on the management of credit, operational, and market risks.  To ensure compliance with \nthe regulatory requirements, DAB will establish a system to manage enforcement action, which \nincludes a tracking system for such actions. To manage systemic risks posed by distressed \nbanks, DAB will also adopt policies and procedures on conservatorship, receivership and forced \nliquidation.\nImproving public confidence in the banking sector requires transparency based on reliable and \ntimely information.  Accordingly, DAB will issue regulations on the external audit of banks and \nqualifications of bank auditors, and will take remedial supervisory actions to ensure the timely \nsubmission of audited statements by banks. DAB will also publish banks\u2019 financial statements \non DAB\u2019s website.\nDAB will conduct parallel efforts to build capacity among supervisors, particularly in the areas of \ninternal control, risk management, enforcement actions, and back-office operations.   \nThe role of the microfinance sector in meeting the needs of small borrowers and depositors has \nincreased markedly in recent years. To promote the orderly development of this sector, DAB will \nadopt and implement the regulations of licensing and supervision of depository microfinance \ninstitutions. This  would  strengthen  depositor  confidence thereby  enabling  them  to  mobilize \nsavings to expand their outreach.  Likewise, to protect clients of money service providers and \nforeign  exchange  dealers  (hawaladars),  DAB  will  adopt  regulations  aimed  at  enhancing \ndisclosure about the hawaladars\u2019 financial transactions.  \nThe absence of national accounting and auditing standards impinges on private enterprises\u2019 \nability to access credit.  To address this, the Government will adopt an accounting and auditing \nlaw  in  line  with  international  standards.  To  provide  the  needed  policy  and  institutional \nframeworks for the timely implementation of the standards, the Government will establish an \naccounting and auditing board under MOF, comprising of representatives from MOF, DAB, \nMinistry  of  Commerce  (MOC),  Control  and  Audit  Office  and  professional  accountants  and \nauditors  from  the  private  sector.    In  addition,  to  address  the  acute  shortage  of  qualified \naccountants  and  auditors  in  Afghanistan,  the  accounting  and  auditing  board  will  define \naccreditation and examination requirements for the licensing of accountants and auditors, and \nwill issue standards for professional ethics.   \nThe Government understands that successful Program implementation depends on the ability of \nthe  Executing  and  Implementing  Agencies  to undertake reform measures in a timely manner.

No \nNo\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Afghanistan: \nThe 2006 Interim Afghanistan National Development Strategy (I-ANDS) is the Government\u2019s Interim \nPoverty Reduction and Strategy Paper (I-PRSP).  The I-ANDS covers a broad spectrum of development \nconcerns,  including  security,  governance,  rule  of  law  and  human  rights,  and  economic  and  social \ndevelopment.  The I-ANDS aims to transform the economy to enable the private sector to be the engine of \ngrowth, empower the poor to participate fully in that growth, and progressively eliminate the narcotics \neconomy.  The overall strategy for economic and social development is to prioritize interventions in: \n(i) infrastructure development, (ii) institutional and human capacity development, (iii) protecting the rights of \nthe  poor  and  social  protection,  and  (iv)  creating  an  enabling  environment  for  entrepreneurship  and \ninvestment. \nAfghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world, with per capita GDP of $300, and weak social \nindicators.  To ensure sustainable economic growth and poverty alleviation, Afghanistan must shift from \nreconstruction-related recovery to private sector-driven growth. The strengthening of the private sector will \ngenerate employment with the increase in both domestic and foreign investments resulting from better \ninvestment climate. With the entry of new businesses, competition is reinforced and will result in more \nefficient provision of goods and services.  There are also fiscal benefits arising from private sector \ndevelopment.  Increased private sector output will reduce the need for the Government to provide the fiscal \nimpetus for growth.  In addition, private business operations will generate higher tax revenues, further \ncreating fiscal space for expenditures to provide social services for the poor.  A thriving private sector is \nalso essential for providing alternative livelihood in the rural areas, thereby supporting Government efforts \nat eliminating the narcotics economy. \nB.

The 2004 United Nations \nDevelopment Programme\u2019s Human Development Report ranked Afghanistan 173 out of a sample of 177 \ncountries, with a literacy rate of 29% , life expectancy at birth of 45 years, and infant mortality of 115 per \n1000 live birth. The 2003 National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (NRVA) conducted by the Ministry of \nRural Rehabilitation and Development suggests that economic and social conditions in the rural area are \nsignificantly worse.  An estimated 3.5 million out of the 17.5 million rural population live in extreme poverty, \nand an additional 10.5 million are vulnerable to extreme poverty.  The assessment also indicates that \nmalnutrition is widespread in rural Kabul, and only 9% of the rural population has access to a health facility. \nAn NRVA was conducted more recently in 2005. The Central Statistics Office, with assistance from ADB \nand World Bank, are processing the survey to obtain more updated poverty estimates.  Results are \nexpected by early 2007.
