The \ncountry  has  benefited  recently  from  higher  oil  prices  and  greater  exports,  both  of  which  have \nincreased  foreign  currency  inflow  and  assisted  debt-servicing  efforts.  For  these  economic \nstrengths,  Kazakhstan  is  rated  Baa2  by  Moody\u2019s,  BBB  by  Standard  and  Poor\u2019s,  and  BBB  by \nFitch  (all  long-term  issuer  default  rating).  Appendix  1  provides  details  on  the  country\u2019s \nmacroeconomic outlook. \n \n3. \nNevertheless, Kazakhstan\u2019s high dependence on oil exports poses a potential threat for \nthe  economy  given  potential  volatility  in  the  international  oil  market.  Small-  and  medium-sized \nenterprises  (SMEs)  and  other  manufacturing  companies  are  currently  underrepresented  in  the \nnational  economy.1  Creating  conditions  for  growth  of  the  corporate  and  SME  sector  is  of  key \nimportance in striving to diversify the economy.2  \n \nB. \n\nBanking and Capital Markets in Kazakhstan \n\n4. \nImprovements  in  the  economic  and  operating  environment  of  Kazakhstan\u2019s  financial \nsector  have  resulted  in  rapid  growth  during  the  past  5  years,  leading  to  enhanced \ncreditworthiness  and  commercial  profiles  for  domestic  banking.  In  particular,  the  Government \nand  National  Bank  of  Kazakhstan,  the  central  bank,  have  undertaken  structural  reforms  to \npromote consolidation and improve the overall viability of the banking system. \n \n5. \nEncouraged by this improving macroeconomic environment and robust growth, Kazakh \nbanks have increased lending volumes by an average of more than 40% per year (albeit from a \nvery  low  base),  while  generally  maintaining  healthy  asset  quality  and  profitability.  This  is \n\n                                                 \n1  The  SME  sector  is  estimated  to  have  contributed  only  14%\u201315%  of  GDP  in  2005.  Because  the  SME  sector  is \nrelatively more labor-intensive, providing approximately 40% of total employment, SME growth is significantly more \ninclusive and pro-poor in nature. \n\n2  Asian  Development  Bank.  2003.  Country  Strategy  and  Program  (2004\u20132006):  Kazakhstan.  Manila,  17.  The \nGovernment has a declared policy of fostering SME development by promulgating SME laws (for instance, the Law \non State Support to Development of Small Business in the Republic of Kazakhstan) and establishing organizations \nto  implement  this  policy.  The  policy  includes  various  support  measures,  provision  of  services  via  business \ndevelopment  centers,  and  small  business  loans.  An  exhibition  and  information  center  (a  wholly  state-owned  joint \nstock  company)  works  in  accordance  with  the  Government's  program  to  support  SMEs.  In  addition,  the \nGovernment set up the SME Support Fund in 1997 as a nonbanking financial institution. The fund\u2019s main objective \nis to effectively use financial resources allocated within the framework of state and regional programs for projects \nand  activities  aimed  at  supporting  SMEs.  The  fund  is  tasked  to  (i)  broaden  access  to  finance  for  SMEs,  (ii) \neffectively  use  state  and  nonstate  resources  aimed  at  SME  support,  (iii)  develop  SME  infrastructure,  and  (iv) \nprovide consultations for SMEs. \n\n\f 2 \n\nespecially true for the top performers within the first two tiers of the banking system. Appendixes \n2 provide a more detailed analysis of the Kazakh banking system. \n \n6. \nOne of the key challenges facing the financial sector is the development of the nascent \n(debt and equity) capital markets, especially with respect to the corporate sector (Appendix 2). \nTo  widen  their  access  to  funding,  many  banks  are  keen  to  enter  the  securitization  markets, \ndomestically  as  well  as  internationally.  Securitization  in  Kazakhstan  is  currently  limited  to \noffshore transactions, due to the lack of respective regulations for domestic issuance. \n \nC. \n\nFuture Flow Securitization: Overview \n\n1. \n\nSecuritization Background \n\n7. \nSecuritization  has  emerged  as  one  of  the  dominant  means  of  capital  formation \nthroughout the world, particularly in the United States (US) and Europe. In developed markets, \nasset securitization serves a number of purposes: (i) supporting public policy objectives such as \nbroad  home  ownership  and  development  of  financial  markets  (especially  capital,  retail,  and \nmortgage  markets);  (ii)  addressing  regulatory  requirements  for  financial  institutions,  especially \ncapital  adequacy  and  lending  limit  requirements  applicable  to  banks;  (iii)  transferring  risk, \nespecially in the context of nonperforming assets and portfolio diversification; and (iv) providing \nan alternative means of raising finance. In developing Asia, however, securitization is still in a \nnascent  stage.  Appendix  3  provides  a  general  description  of  the  securitization  process  and \nAppendix 4 an overview of the various benefits derived from securitization. \n\n2. \n\nFuture Flow Securitization and Diversified Payment Rights Securitization \n\nfuture  and  existing  offshore  receivables.  Future \n\n8. \nFuture  flow  securitization  became  popular  in  emerging  markets  in  the  1990s  as  a \nmechanism to reduce sovereign-related risk and provide more attractive access to international \ncapital  markets  for  the  stronger  emerging  market  issuers.  A  future  flow  transaction  is  a \nsecuritization  of  a  company\u2019s \nflow \nsecuritizations mitigate, in this case, many of the sovereign risks associated with an emerging \nmarket borrower by capturing cash flows offshore. Appendix 5 gives a more detailed description \nof  the  structure  of  future  flow  securitization  transactions.  Of  all  future  flow  transactions \nworldwide, none has so far defaulted.   \n \n9. \nIn Kazakhstan, future flow transactions are only beginning to be introduced. Appendix 6 \ngives details of outstanding future flow asset-backed securities deals, and Appendix 7 provides \na brief overview and introduction to DPR securitizations. 3  \n\n                                                 \n3  In  a  DPR  securitization,  the  future  cash  flows  result  from  payment  orders  or  electronic  messages  requested  by \noffshore obligors instructing a bank to make a payment to a beneficiary other than the bank. This may take the form \nof  payments  to  local  exporters,  foreign  direct  investments,  tourism-related  payments  to  travel  agencies,  personal \nwire  transfers  or  workers\u2019  remittances,  and  payments  to  local  servicers.  Payments  to  banks  relating  to  such \npayment orders are owned by the bank and not the named beneficiary. In other words, the receiving bank does not \nact as a trustee of these funds but the bank is performing a service for the sending bank, gets paid for doing so by \nthe sending bank (and thus becomes the owner of these flows), and incurs a matching obligation to the beneficiary. \nIn  this  regard  such  payments  are  similar  to  deposits  made  into  a  deposit  account.  While  the  bank  will  have  an \nobligation  to  pay  the  local  beneficiary  (recipient)  an  equivalent  amount  of  money  (in  the  stipulated  currency),  the \nbank does not have the obligation to deliver the exact same funds received from the sender (money is fungible). In \nother words, during the period from the receipt of the funds from the sender by the bank (from its foreign branch or \ncorrespondent bank) up to the stipulated delivery for the funds by the bank to the local beneficiary, the bank has \neffective  title  to  these  funds  (similar  to  the  2-day  float  after  a  check  is  deposited).  On  a  continuing  basis,  the \naverage  daily  float  can  be  calculated  and  made  the  basis  of  the  amount  of  foreign  currency  received  and  then \n\n\f3\n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED INVESTMENT \n\nA. \n\nProject Conceptualization \n\n10. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  took  its  first  steps  into  the  Kazakh  market  with \nloans to Bank TuranAlem JSC4 ($75 million) and Alliance Bank JSC ($50 million).5 Both loans \nwere disbursed in July 2006. These transactions, apart from their direct development impacts in \nterms  of  SME  development,  introduced  ADB  as  a  participant  in  the  market.  These  two  loans \nhave  been  well  received,  were  noted  in  the  market,  and  have  provided  a  number  of  follow-up \nopportunities.  ADB  decided  that  in  a  next  phase  of  financial  sector  development  it  would \nconcentrate on development of the country\u2019s capital markets.  \n \n11. \nThe  ADB  Board  of  Directors  endorsed  the  first  steps  in  this  direction  by  approving,  in \nSeptember 2006, ADB\u2019s guarantee for the DPR securitization undertaken by Alliance Bank JSC \nand  in  March  2007  a  guarantee  for  a  DPR  securitization  issued  by  Kazkommertsbank  JSC.6 \nBoth  transactions  have  successfully  reached  financial  close.  To  build  a  sustainable  business \nmodel for ADB, replication of certain business ideas is important. In line with this approach, ADB \noriginated  a  small  number  of  follow-up  investment  opportunities  in  Kazakhstan,  which  meet \nADB\u2019s development criteria and goals as well as ATF\u2019s credit standards.  \n \n12. \nThe  proposed  transaction  follows  a  similar  structure  as  the  Alliance  Bank  JSC  and \nKazkommertsbank JSC DPR securitizations and was conceptualized in recognition of the need \nto address the lack of diversity in banking system funding sources, and introduce a new asset \nclass and new investors to Kazakhstan\u2019s capital markets.  \n \nIn Kazakhstan, this would be the second DPR securitization of a medium-sized (tier II)7 \n13. \nprivate  sector  bank.  Introduction  of  this  product  will  facilitate  ATF\u2019s  activities  in  diversifying  its \nfunding sources and provide longer tenor funding to its borrowers.  \n \n14. \nIn  Kazakhstan,  DPR  securitization  has  been  introduced,  but  to  fully  establish  the \nsecuritization market and DPR as an established asset class, more securitization deals have to \nbe completed. ATF has previously tried to use this funding technique but was unable to tap the \ncapital markets and ended up leveraging its DPR only in the banking market (via DPR loans). \nThe  proposed  transaction  will  give  ATF  full  access  to  the  capital  markets.  In  addition,  this \ntransaction is expected to help other banks of similar size and with a similar rating to access this \ntype  of  funding.  The  Project  has  however  a  two-pronged  approach  as  it  also  supports  the \ndomestic policy dialogue for capital market development.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \nassigned to the special purpose vehicle. From this perspective, what the bank is assigning is its expected float and \nnot the remittances themselves that it expects to transact from foreign senders. \n\n4   ADB. 2006.

ADB sees the best strategic fit of this \nproduct in applying it to transactions related to capital markets, especially in the form of credit \nguarantees for securitization transactions. Appendix 8 provides an overview of remittance flows \nin Central Asia, which form the basis for DPR securitization transactions. ADB is working on a \nregional  study  on  remittances  and  poverty  in  Central  Asia  and  South  Caucasus,  which  is \nexpected to be presented in July 2007. \n \n16. \nADB  is  targeting  a  total  of  three  to  four  DPR  transactions  (with  different  banks)  in \nKazakhstan  to  justify  the  high  opportunity  cost  of  transaction  structure development  and  in  an \nattempt  to  ensure  full  development  impact.  The  proposed  DPR  transaction,  however,  has  the \nunique feature that ADB is proposing to only provide a partial guarantee (principal only) instead \nof  a  full  guarantee  (principal  and  interest).  This  represents  a  new  step  in  the  development  of \nADB\u2019s efforts. However, due to the structure of this guarantee, it is envisaged that a \u2018AAA\u201d rating \nwill  still  be  achieved.  This  allows  the  issuer  to  tap  into  the  very  wide  investor  base  that  is \ninterested in top grade issues (i.e., AAA rating) combined with exposure to local banks.  \n \nIn  parallel,  other  markets  will  be  developed,  so  that  once  ADB  exits  the  Kazakh  DPR \n17. \nsecuritization  market  a  smooth  transition  is  ensured.  ADB  is  concentrating  these  efforts \ncurrently  in  Azerbaijan,  Pakistan,  and  Philippines.  In  addition,  DPR  transactions  can  be \nstructured  as  loans  at  an  early  stage  before  the  markets  are  sufficiently  developed  for  the \nissuance of DPR-backed bonds.  \n \n18. \nIn  line  with  this  strategy,  ADB  is  also  providing  (i)  hands-on  support  to  the  Philippine \nGovernment to interpret and apply the newly enacted Securitization Law in connection with DPR \n(worker remittance) securitization, (ii) technical assistance10 to the Government of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) for the formulation of a new securitization law, and (iii) support for the \nKazakhstan  Government  in  formulating  the  necessary  implementation  rules  for  its  newly \nenacted Securitization Law to allow domestic securitization. \n \n19. \nThis strategy and the proposed transaction are fully in line with ADB\u2019s poverty reduction \nstrategy.11 The strategy states that ADB seeks to promote \u201csound and efficient banking systems \nand  capital  markets,\u201d  since  these  are  seen  as  \u201cindispensable  for  macroeconomic  stability, \nmobilizing savings, and ensuring availability of long-term financing, an essential requirement for \npro-poor growth.\u201d A more effective capital market promotes more efficient channeling of savings \nto market-based investments that foster more sustainable economic growth. The development \nof securitization deepens and broadens capital markets, benefiting both issuers and investors.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n8   ADB. 2006.

The  bank  has \n20. \nconsistently  gained  market  share,  and  is  now  one  of  the  leading  banks  in  the  country  (11% \nmarket share for corporate banking, 13% for SME business, and 13% for mortgage loans as of \nend-2006). Balance sheet growth in 2006 was primarily driven by expansion in lending activities \n(retail and SME). ATF operates through 32 full service branches and 62 cash settlement offices \nin Kazakhstan.  \n \n21. \nCurrently,  ATF  is  rated  by  three  rating  agencies:  Moody\u2019s  Investor  Services  Limited; \nStandard & Poor\u2019s Rating Services; and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (Table 2). On 25 June 2007, it was \nannounced  that  Bank  Austria  Creditanstalt,  responsible  within  the  Italian  UniCredito  Group  for \ncommercial  banking  activities  in  the  Central  and  Eastern  Europe  (CEE)  region,  has  signed  a \nshare  purchase  agreement  to  acquire  a  majority  shareholding  in  the  Bank.  Following  this \nannouncement,  the  rating  agencies  are  expected  to  upgrade  ATF\u2019s  credit  ratings.  The  rating \nagencies  have  already  placed  ATF  on  credit  watch  with  positive  outlook,  reflecting  the  strong \nupside  potential  for  ATF's  creditworthiness  following  the  change  of  control.  Standard  &  Poor\u2019s \nexpects  that  ATF  will  benefit  from  operational,  managerial,  and  financial  support  from \nUniCredito.  ATF\u2019s  long-term  rating  is  expected  to  benefit  from  a  one-to-three  notch  uplift  from \nthe current stand-alone rating.  \n \n\nTable 2: ATF Bank Credit Ratings \n\nItem \nLong-Term \nShort-Term \nOutlook \n\nMoody\u2019s \nBa1 \nNP \nStable \n\nS&P \nB+ \nB \nStable \n\nFitch \nBB- \nB \nStable \n\nFitch = Fitch Ratings, Inc.; Moody\u2019s = Moody\u2019s Investor Services Limited; S&P = \nStandard & Poor\u2019s Rating Services. \nSource: Source: Fitch, Moody\u2019s, S&P. \n\n \nB. \n\nThe Business \n\nATF provides a broad range of banking services to large companies and SMEs, and is \n\n22. \nexpanding its retail business focusing on high- and middle-income individuals. \n\n \n23. \nSince  its  inception  in  1995,  ATF  has  evolved  from  an  institution  primarily  focusing  on \nfunding its clients\u2019 trading activities to a universal bank. This transition has been accelerated by \nrapidly evolving market conditions, and by the necessity to diversify in order to defend its market \nposition. ATF benefited from the fact that it began its operations as a new entity; it did not have \nto carry a burden of problems inherited from the past (i.e., bad asset quality as did some of its \npeers that were founded on the remnants of the banking system of the former Soviet Union). \n \nCorporate  Banking.  Corporate  banking  has  historically  been  ATF\u2019s  most  important \n24. \nbusiness.  ATF  provides  the  full  spectrum  of  lending  products,  i.e.,  short-,  medium-,  and  long-\nterm  financing,  trade  finance,  documentary  operations,  letters  of  credit,  and  guarantees.  ATF \nhas long-standing relationships with some of the country\u2019s largest corporates, but its customer \nbase  is  relatively  well  diversified  because  ATF  is  independent  from  any  large  industrial  group \n(unlike many of its competitors). ATF\u2019s loan concentration has been decreasing since 2003, and \nin  2006  its  top  10  customers  represented  20%  (28%  in  2003)  of  the  portfolio;  the  top  50 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f 6 \n\nrepresented 40% (58% in 2003). The corporate loan portfolio has grown from 2003 to 2006, but \nis projected to grow by only 24% CARG in the next 3 years as ATF increases its focus on the \nSME and retail segments.  \n \nSMEs.  SMEs  continue  to  represent  a  focus  of  ATF\u2019s  business  strategy.  ATF  has  a \n25. \ndedicated  department  for  SMEs,  and  SME  business  has  been  growing  rapidly  (130%  CARG \nfrom 2003 to 2006). ATF plans to increase the share of SME loans in its total portfolio (currently \napproximately  20%)  as  well  as  its  market  share  in  the  SME  business  segment,  which  is \ncurrently estimated at 13%. To cater to the specific needs of its SME customers, ATF launched \nseveral  strategic  initiatives  including  plans  to  open  21  dedicated  centers  providing  business \nservices  to  SMEs.  The  SME  business  is  intended  to  be  grown  rapidly  which  seems  a  logical \nstrategic step given ATF\u2019s size and its prevailing expertise. At the same time, the SME market \nsegment offers good margins and good potential for sustainable growth in the future. \n \n26. \nRetail. Retail loans accounted for 14% of total loans at the end of 2006. ATF focuses on \nthree  main  products:  mortgages,  consumer  loans,  and  car  loans.  ATF  is  one  of  the  leading \nmortgage loan providers in the country with a market share of 13%. The quality of ATF\u2019s retail \nportfolio is good. ATF is expanding its retail distribution network to 150 dedicated retail centers \nat the end of 2007 and 229 at the end of 2009.  \n \nATF is striving to gain market share in the retail business by focusing on the upper and \n27. \nmiddle classes of the population, hence avoiding the \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d style of banking where \nhigh overheads are incurred in obtaining many small deposits. \n \n\nV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nOverview \n\nThe proposed transaction is a credit guarantee to be issued in favor of investors in notes \n28. \nwith  a  value  of  up  to  $125,000,000  (Series  2007-A  Notes)  issued  by  an  SPV.  The  notes  are \nbacked by DPR originated by ATF. The credit guarantee will only guarantee the principal of the \nSeries  2007-A  Notes.  The  total  amount  of  the  issuance  is expected  to  potentially  also  include \nunwrapped notes (Series 2007-B Notes) of an amount to be specified after the due diligence of \nthe rating agency (Moody\u2019s).  \n \nDPR  usually  take  the  form  of  SWIFT,12  MT102  and  103,13  and  MT202  payment  order \n29. \nmessages. 14   These  payment  orders  are  generated  as  part  of  the  international  financial \noperations  of  ATF.  Payment  orders  are  created  as  a  result  of  ATF\u2019s  role  as  a  financial \nintermediary  between  foreign  payors  wishing  to  send  funds  to  Kazakhstan  and  residents  of \nKazakhstan receiving these funds, ATF proposes to securitize its MT100 DPR, denominated in \ndollars (ATF DPR).15  \n\n                                                 \n12  Society  for  Worldwide  Interbank  Financial  Telecommunications  (SWIFT)  is  an  international  messaging  system \nowned  and  maintained  by  the  member  banks  (payment  order  only,  no  settlement).  MT103/103+  are  sent  by  the \nordering customer\u2019s bank to the beneficiary\u2019s bank and are used to convey a funds transfer instruction.  \n\n13  MT102  is  principally  a  set  of  bulked  customer  transfers  that  meet  certain  criteria  (e.g.,  common  correspondent \nbanks, common currency, or common value date). MT103 is a customer transfer wherein either the sending party \nor the payer or both is not a financial institution. MT103 is a more structured version.  \n\n14  MT100  (including  MT102  and  103)  is  the  standard  message  type  for  payment  orders  relating  to  payment  from \nsenders  to  payees  who  are  individuals,  companies  (other  than  financial  institutions),  or  governments  through \nbanks.  MT200  (including  MT202)  is  the  standard  message  type  for  payment  orders  relating  to  payment  from \nsenders to payees that are financial institutions. \n\n15  ATF\u2019s MT200 DPR are miniscule, as well as flows not denominated in dollars (less than 3%). \n\n\f \n\n7\n\n \n30. \nThe  transaction  is  part  of  a  securitization  program  of  ATF\u2019s  existing  and  future  dollar \nMT100 category DPR. The initial issuance under the program was through a $100 million loan \n(Series 2006-A loan). Notes in the capital markets were not issued as this did not seem feasible \nat  the  time.  The  Series  2006-A  loan  issued  on  4  April  2006  has  a  final  maturity  of  5  years,  a \nprincipal  repayment  grace  period  of  2  years,  with  equal  quarterly  repayments  thereafter, \nresulting in a weighted average life of 3.6 years.  \n \nThe guarantee is anchored in the 2001 technical assistance to Kazakhstan for Preparing \n31. \nthe Urban Small Business Development Project.16 The TA was to promote development of the \nurban  SME  sector,  review  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  SMEs,  and  foster  financial \nintermediation.  This  assistance  will  play  a  central  role  in  supporting  ADB\u2019s  private  sector \noperations in the financial sector and in strengthening domestic banks. \n \nB. \n\nATF\u2019s Diversified Payment Rights \n\n1. \n\nIntroduction \n\n32. \nATF generates DPR by acting as a recipient of payment orders, which arise through a \nvariety of transactions, including from merchants inside Kazakhstan exporting goods or services \nto  their  customers  outside  of  Kazakhstan,  foreign  direct  investment,  Kazakhstan  flows, 17  \noverseas transportation, and personal remittances. The payors who wish to make payments to \nbeneficiaries in Kazakhstan who have accounts with ATF, request their banks, in the majority of \ncases  located  outside  Kazakhstan,  to  initiate  transactions  for  the  payment  of  amounts  to \nbeneficiaries in Kazakhstan through ATF, thereby generating payment orders.  \n \n33. \nProcessing  payment  orders  is  a  basic  banking  business  that  offers  significant  benefits \nsuch  as  the  ability  to  (i)  strengthen  correspondent  banking  relationships  and  obtain  favorable \nterms on other banking products and businesses from its correspondent banks, (ii) attract new \nclients in cases where payment orders are the initial contact the client has with ATF and monitor \nATF\u2019s  borrower\u2019s  cash  flows,  (iii)  provide  high-quality  clearing  services  to  its  clients  in \nKazakhstan, (iv) generate foreign currency, (v) expand daily treasury activity, and (vi) improve \nliquidity.  \n \n\n2. \n\nDepository Banks \n\n34.  With  respect  to  payment  orders  received  by  ATF,  these  orders  are  accomplished  by \nmaking  a  deposit  into  one  of  ATF\u2019s  accounts  held  with  one  of  its  correspondent  banks  (the \ndepositary  banks).  ATF  receives  DPR  collections  at  approximately  44  depositary  banks  in  15 \ncountries,  with  19  depository  banks  located  in  the  US.  Currently  the  designated  depositary \n\n                                                 \n16  ADB.  2001.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of  Kazakhstan  for  Preparing  the  Urban  Small  Business \n\nDevelopment Project. Manila. \n\n17  Pursuant  to  current  Kazakhstan  currency  regulation,  a  Kazakhstan  resident  cannot  make  a  foreign  currency-\ndenominated payment in favor of another Kazakhstan resident; however, they may transfer their own funds from an \naccount  with  one  Kazakhstan  bank  in  favor  of  another  account  held  with  another  Kazakhstan  bank.  Such  a \npayment  order  would  be  settled  outside  Kazakhstan.  Kazakhstan  flows  are  collections  that  arise  when  a \nKazakhstan  bank  (whether  through  a  branch,  representative  office,  or  other  office  located  inside  or  outside  of \nKazakhstan) or a foreign bank\u2019s Kazakhstan branch or other office has initiated a payment order. Kazakhstan flows \nare often the result of Kazakhstan companies moving their own dollar and euro funds. \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\nbanks  (DDBs)  18  are  (i)  The  Bank  of  New  York  (New  York);  (ii)  American  Express  Bank  Ltd. \n(New York); and (iii) Citibank (New York).19  \n\n \n\n3. \n\nHistorical Flows \n\n35. \nATF,  a  SWIFT  member  since  1995,  has  consistently  experienced  growth  in  payment \norders processed. ATF\u2019s DPR business shares a similarity with Kazakhstan\u2019s export industry as \nATF\u2019s DPR include those that relate to exports to various countries, of which the most common \nhave  been  the  US,  Netherlands,  Great  Britain,  Russian  Federation,  PRC,  Italy,  France,  and \nSwitzerland. DPR volumes also tend to reflect Kazakhstan\u2019s economic growth patterns.  \n \n36. \nSeasonality.  ATF\u2019s  pool  of  DPR  flows  as  a  whole  is  not  subject  to  any  significant \nseasonality,  although  year-end  volumes  do  tend  to  be  higher  than  the  yearly  average.  ATF \nbelieves  that  such  increases  are  a  typical  year-end  phenomenon,  as  companies  attempt  to \nsettle their trades before the end of the financial year. \n \n37. \n \n \nC. \n\nCurrency. The payment orders sold by ATF are denominated in dollars.  \n\nGuarantee Fee \n\nADB  will  receive  a  guarantee  fee.  The  guarantee  fee  amount  and  computation  will  be \n38. \nmarket  driven  using  similar  DPR  securitization  structures  in  Kazakhstan  and  Turkey  as  a \nbenchmark.  The  guarantee  fee  will  be  set  in  accordance  with  ADB  policies  by  the  Credit \nEnhancement and Pricing Committee.  \n \n \n\nVI. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND ASSUMPTIONS \n\nA. \n\nJustification  \n\n1. \n\nInvestment Objective \n\nADB\u2019s  objective  in  the  proposed  transaction  is  to  develop  Kazakhstan\u2019s  securitization \n39. \nmarket  to  (i)  diversify  funding  options;  (ii)  procure  access  to  longer  term  funds,  specifically  for \nmedium-sized private sector banks; and to (iii) attract a new set of investors.  \n \nADB\u2019s  Guarantee  will  increase  interest  in  DPR  securitization  from  Kazakhstan.  By \n40. \nestablishing  a  credit  history  for  ATF,  the  Project  enhances  its  ability  to  raise  funds  in \ninternational  capital  markets,  obtain  longer  tenor  funds  than  currently  possible  in  the  market, \nand build market confidence in medium-sized banks. ATF\u2019s business lines generating DPR will \nbe under constant scrutiny by rating agencies forcing ATF to adopt and comply with best market \npractices.  For  the  investor,  the  proposed  transaction  will  provide  access  to  a  new  market; \ndiversify  its  portfolio;  and  presumably  receive  higher  returns  than  government,  bank,  and \ncorporate bonds. The transaction will boost investor and creditor confidence, both international \n\n                                                 \n18 A  correspondent  bank  qualifies  as  ATF\u2019s  DDBs  if  the  correspondent  bank  processes  more  than  12%  of  ATF\u2019s \ncollection for two consecutive quarters, has good credit quality, and is experienced in handling DPR. ATF signs an \naccount agreement with the qualified correspondent bank to make them a DDB. \n\n19 Pursuant to certain account agreements, the DDBs are obligated to deposit all funds received (or paid) by them in \nrespect of any DPR into a collection account maintained with each such DDB from where they are transferred by \nthe primary DDBs to the concentration account held by the Bank of New York.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nand domestic, in Kazakhstan\u2019s banking system, and increase depositor confidence in the local \neconomy and banking system. \n \n41. \nADB\u2019s  second  objective  is  to  foster  corporate  and  SME  financing.  In  turn,  ADB  is \nassisting  the  Government  in  its  efforts  to  steer  the  Kazakh  economy  toward  more  sustainable \nSME-led  growth  while  diversifying  away  from  the  dominance  and  dependence  on  natural \nresources  industries.  The  Project  allows  ATF  to  extend  the  tenor  of  its  borrowings  to  up  to  7 \nyears, 2 years longer than the maximum tenor it has been able to obtain from the market. In turn \nATF will be able to lengthen its tenor for its customers. The transaction will therefore bridge an \nunwanted maturity gap and allow ATF to match its assets and liabilities more closely. In addition, \nthe  securitization  will  allow  ATF  to  access  lower  cost  funds,  which  will  make  ATF  more \ncompetitive and allow it to pass savings to its customers.  \n \n\n2. \n\nDevelopment Outcome \n\n42. \nThe Government is striving to diversify the economy and reduce dependence on the oil \nsubsector.  This  entails  improving  access  of  the  nonoil  sectors  to  finance  and  making \ninvestments in these sectors more attractive to investors. The Project seeks to achieve this by \nhelping  develop  the  capital  market  through  diversifying  funding  sources  for  borrowers  and \nincreasing the availability of investment grade products for investors.  \n \n43. \nAlthough the concept of DPR securitization is not entirely new to the market, the number \nof  issues  in  Kazakhstan  has  been  limited.  For  the  emerging  market  issuers,  ADB\u2019s  guarantee \nachieves a rating that is higher than the country\u2019s foreign currency sovereign rating. The Project \nwill also address the need to educate investors and borrowers on the risks inherent in such a \nstructure  by  issuing  unguaranteed  notes.  In  addition,  the  Kazakh  DPR  securitizations  are \namong  the  very  few  completed  in  Asia  and  form  part  of  a  handful  of  future  flow  transactions \nexecuted  so  far  in  Asia.  An  increased  number  of  DPR  securitizations  will  lead  to  a  better \nunderstanding and development of this financing technique. Hence, this proposal is expected to \nfacilitate the development of a full-scale securitization market in Kazakhstan, and have spillover \neffects for the whole of Asia. ADB will provide for the first time a partial guarantee (instead of a \nfull guarantee) for a future flow securitization, which will further widen the potential investor base \nand contribute to the diversification of funding sources.  \n \n44. \nSecondly,  the  proposed  transaction  will  allow  ATF  to  service  its  core  businesses  and \ndirectly  contribute  to  expanding  financial  intermediation  to  SMEs  and  corporates\u2014including \nthose  in  rural  areas\u2014via  ATF\u2019s  existing  and  growing  branch  network,  as  well  as  foster \ndiversification of loan portfolios.  \n \nIncrease  Access  to  International  Capital  Markets. DPR securitization is designed to \n45. \nmitigate sovereign risk so that noninvestment grade borrowers can access longer term financing \nat lower interest rates than they could by borrowing directly. The innovative structuring of these \ntransactions  has  allowed  many  noninvestment  grade  borrowers  in  developing  countries  to \npierce the sovereign credit ceiling and obtain financing at significantly lower interest costs and \nfor longer duration. ADB\u2019s involvement as Guarantor enhances the borrower\u2019s credit rating.  \n \nSecuritization  of  future  flow  and  existing  receivables  can  provide  a  way  of  raising \n46. \ndevelopment  finance  for  many  low-  and,  in  particular,  middle-income  countries,  especially \nduring times of low liquidity and heightened perception of sovereign risk. During a liquidity crisis, \ndeveloping  countries  need  innovative  ways  to  raise  external  finance.  Future-flow  receivable \n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\nsecuritization  provides  such  a  means  of  securing  credit  ratings  for  new  issues  that  pierce  the \nsovereign ceiling and thereby reduce the cost of funding. Future flow securitizations also attract \na  much  wider  class  of  investors  because  of  their  investment  grade  rating.  Moreover,  by \nestablishing  a  credit  history  for  the  borrower,  these  deals  enhance  the  ability  and  reduce  the \ncosts of accessing capital markets in the future. \n \n47. \nFrom  the  investors\u2019  point  of  view,  the  attractiveness  of  this  asset  class  lies  in  its  good \ncredit rating and its good performance in good and bad times. No debt defaults on rated future \nflow asset-backed securities issued by developing country entities have been recorded despite \nrepeated liquidity and solvency crises.20\n \n48. \nExpansion  of  the  Formal  Banking  System.  As  local  banks  realize  the  funding \nadvantages inherent in packaging securitized DPR flows, they will become more competitive in \nterms of fees charged for DPR and remittance transfers, which will encourage both senders and \nbeneficiaries to become bank clients and thereby enter into the formal banking system.  \n \nImprove  Financial  Conditions  of  Local  Banks.  Securitization  will  help  improve  the \n49. \nasset/liability  management  of  local  banks  through  access  to  longer  term/lower  rate  funding \nsources. For example, banks can replace short-term borrowings in hard currencies with longer \nterm funding through securitizations. Improvements in ATF\u2019s financial conditions will in turn lead \nto more stability of the region\u2019s banking system. \n \n50. \nfor domestic securitization transactions, possibly once ADB has completed its policy project. \n \n\nPreparing  for  Domestic  Issuance.  Ultimately,  these  transactions  are  paving  the  way \n\n3. \n\nValue Added of ADB  \n\n \nADB\u2019s  proposed  guarantee  will  add  value  by  (i)  enabling  the  transaction  and  a  wider \n51. \ndistribution  of  the  notes,  especially  to  Asian  investors;  (ii)  increasing  and  diversifying  funding \nsources and investment products in the market; (iii) providing access to longer term financing for \nATF,  thus  improving  ATF\u2019s  management  of  its  assets  and  liabilities;  (iv)  helping  develop  the \nsecuritization  and  SME  market  in  Kazakhstan  by  extending  a  partial  guarantee;  and  (v) \nincreasing  investor  confidence  in  Kazakhstan\u2019s  relatively  young  capital  market  by  extending  a \npartial guarantee instead of a full guarantee. ADB contributes to the development of the market \nfor this type of transaction and asset class for the second tier banks in Kazakhstan. \n \n\n4. \n\nDevelopment Impact Measurement \n\n52. \nADB will measure the expected development impact of the Project. These performance \nmeasures follow the multilateral development banks\u2019 Evaluation Cooperation Group's Standards \nfor  Evaluation  of  Private  Sector  Investment  Operations.  Development  impact  is  measured  in \nthree  distinct  categories:  (i)  business  performance  of  the  Project  itself,  (ii)  economic \nsustainability,  and  (iii)  private  sector  development.  Appendix  9  shows  the  development  impact \nframework. \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n20  The asset class withstood the test of the Mexican peso crisis in 1994/95, the Asian liquidity crisis in 1997/98, and \nthe Ecuadorian debt default in 1999. An interesting example is the receivable deal of PTCL, Pakistan's telephone \ncompany, which continued to perform even in the face of selective default on sovereign debt. \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nB. \n\nSocial and Environmental Safeguard Policies  \n\n53. \nThe  Project  has  been  assigned  a  category  C  environmental  classification  and  is \nclassified  as  category  C  with  respect  to  indigenous  people  and  resettlement.  ATF  will  be \nrequired  to  establish  an  environmental  management  system  following  guidelines  and  to  build \ncapacity for implementing it. At least one ATF officer will attend ADB-sponsored environmental \nmanagement  training.  ATF  has  already  established  a  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and \nDevelopment environmental management system. \n \nC. \n\nAnticorruption  Policy,  and  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of \nTerrorism \n\nADB undertook due diligence on ATF\u2019s procedures in respect of money laundering and \n54. \nfinancing  of  terrorism.  ATF  has  been  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  Anticorruption  (1998,  as \namended  to  date)  and  policy  relating  to  combating  money  laundering  and  the  financing  of \nterrorism.21  ATF will undertake to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and \ncontrols  following  international  best  practice  standards  for  preventing  corruption,  money \nlaundering  activities,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism  in  the  reimbursement  and  indemnity \nagreements.  Further,  ATF  will  undertake  to  refrain  from  engaging  in  such  activities.  The \ndocumentation  between  ADB  and  ATF  will  allow  ADB  to  investigate  any  violation  or  potential \nviolation of these undertakings.  \n \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nADB  will  enter  into  an  acceptable  guarantee  agreement  and  other  required  legal \n55. \ndocuments, following approval of the proposed Guarantee by the Board. These agreements will \nbe on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. \n \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \n56. \nGovernment  of  Kazakhstan  will  be  asked  to  confirm  that  it  has  no  objection  to  the  proposed \nGuarantee. The Guarantee will not become effective until ADB has received such confirmation. \n \n\nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n\n57. \nI am satisfied that the proposed guarantee would comply with the Articles of Agreement \nof  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  credit \nguarantee  to  cover  the  principal  payments  of  notes  for  an  aggregate  amount  of  up  to \n$125,000,000 in connection with a diversified payment rights securitization by ATF Bank JSC, \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with a maturity of 7 years and conditions substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n11July 2007 \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n                                                 \n21 ADB. 2003.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\nKAZAKHSTAN: MAJOR MACROECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS \n\nEconomic Outlook \n\n \nA. \n \nHigh oil prices, foreign investment, and good macroeconomic management underlie the \n1. \ncontinuing  economic  boom  in  this  oil-rich  export  economy.  Gross  domestic  product  (GDP) \ngrowth,  led  by  the  oil  subsector,  averaged  10.3%  per  annum  during  2001\u20132005.  GDP  growth \nreached  9.4%  in  2005  and  is  set  to  grow  to  $65.3  billion  in  2006  and  $84.8  billion  in  2008. \nFurthermore, the private sector, representing 65% of GDP, is increasingly driving growth in the \neconomy.1  \n \n2. \nThese  factors  helped  lift  2005  general  budget  revenues  by  4.7  percentage  points  to \n28.2%  of  GDP.  This  large  gain  was  somewhat  offset  by  the  increase  in  budgetary  spending \nbefore the December presidential election. The general government budget recorded a surplus \nof 0.6% of GDP, from a slight deficit of 0.3% in 2004. In view of its strong financial position, the \nGovernment made early repayments totaling $850 million on its external public debt, reducing \nthe  total  to  about  4%  of  GDP  at  the  end  of  2005.  The  Government  approved  the  2006  state \nbudget  in  November  2005.  It  raised  revenues  by  2%  of  the  previous  year\u2019s  GDP,  reflecting \ngovernment  projections  for  greater  receipts  from  oil.  The  increase  is  earmarked  for  public \ninvestment and social programs.2 \n \n3. \nHigh  world  commodity  prices  helped  boost  exports  by  40.0%  to  $28.7  billion;  oil  and \nmetals  accounted  for  more  than  two  thirds  of  the  increase.  Imports  also  increased  by  37%, \ndriven  largely  by  machinery,  equipment,  and  nonprecious  metals.  The  trade  surplus  improved \nby  about  45%  to  $9.8  billion,  but  the  deficit  on  the  services,  income,  and  transfers  account \nworsened  sharply.  The  latter  stemmed  from  greater  payments  for  construction,  freight, \ninsurance, and information technology services, as well as a near doubling of income payments \nto foreign direct investors, nearly all associated with oil sector development. Consequently, the \ncurrent  account  surplus  in  2005  improved  only  marginally  from  a  year  earlier  to  $750  million \n(about  1.3%  of  GDP).  For  the  first  time  in  5  years,  official  reserves  at  the  National  Bank  of \nKazakhstan (NBK) declined, although they recovered substantially in the first 2 months of 2006 \n(footnote 2). \n \n4. \nGross official reserves stood at $7.1 billion at the end of 2005 (equivalent to 37 months \nof imports of goods and services); while year-end foreign asset holdings of the National Fund of \nthe Republic of Kazakhstan, which saves a part of the Government\u2019s oil and mineral revenues \nfor future generations, amounted to $8.0 billion. During the year, the total of official reserves and \nfund  assets  strengthened  by  about  $684  million  (about  1.2%  of  GDP)  to  $15.1  billion. \nOutstanding public external debt was reduced by about $1.0 billion to $2.4 billion (about 4.2% of \nGDP)  in  the  9  months  to  30  September  2005.  During  this  period,  private  sector  external  debt \n(excluding  oil  and  gas  intracompany  debt)  increased  sharply  by  $4.6  billion  to  $16.6  billion \n(about 33% of GDP). The upsurge in private debt in recent years\u2014mainly local bank borrowing \nfor  onlending\u2014was  largely  a  response  to  the  differential  between  available  foreign  borrowing \nrates and domestic lending rates of about 15% for tenge loans and 11% for loans denominated \nin foreign currency (footnote 2). \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1  European Bank for Reconstruction  and Development  and Merrill Lynch  estimate. This is up from 55% of GDP in \n\n1998. \n\n2   Asian Development Bank. 2006. Asian Development Bank Outlook 2006. Manila. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n13\n\nThe tenge continued to appreciate against the dollar (2.9%) on an average annual basis, \n5. \nreflecting  export  earnings,  foreign  direct  investment,  and  private  external  borrowing.  However, \ntighter market conditions in the final months of 2005 resulted in a 2.2% depreciation on an end-\nof-year basis. As in the previous year, the real effective exchange rate rose by about 6% year-\non-year, due to inflation differentials. Largely because of future substantial oil-related revenues, \nreal appreciation may continue in 2006 (footnote 2).   \n \n6. \nThe  medium-term  outlook  is  positive,  assuming  buoyant  oil  prices,  foreign  direct \ninvestment inflows, continuation of economic diversification, good macroeconomic management, \nand  political  stability.  In  2006,  GDP  growth  is  expected  to  be  sustained  at  8.5%.  Moreover, \nmacroeconomic  stabilization  should  continue,  with  inflation  estimated  at  about  6.5%  in  2006. \nDespite  recent  substantial  increases  in  wages  and  social  spending,  the  Government  has \nmaintained  sustainable  fiscal  and  monetary  policies,  which  have  limited  budget  deficits  and \ninflation.  General  government  debt  will  continue  to  decrease  in  the  next  few  years  by  about \n1.0%\u20131.5%  of  GDP  annually.  Additionally,  with  the  National  Reserve  Fund  for  excess  oil \nearnings and tax revenues expected to reach about $7.4 billion by year-end 2005, a substantial \nfiscal buffer has been created.3 Despite increased external borrowing by commercial banks, the \noverall external position remains strong. \n \n7. \nOverall growth during 2000\u20132004 was led by strong contributions from capital and total \nfactor productivity. The contribution of labor accumulation declined continuously, suggesting that \nthe  economy  is  likely  approaching  full  employment.  According  to  government  data,  the \ncontributions of capital accumulation, total factor productivity, and labor growth to the average \nGDP  rate  of  expansion  of  10.4%  during  2000\u20132004  were  6%,  3.2%,  and  1.2%  (footnote  2,  p. \n98\u201399).  \n \n8. \nThe  hydrocarbons  subsector  has  grown  at  an  average  of  16%  a  year  since  2000,  and \nwill remain the engine of growth in the medium term. Its share in GDP, including production and \nrelated services, jumped from 11% in 2000 to almost 25% in 2005, and is expected to continue \nrising  as  production  capacity  increases.  Sector  growth  has  been  fueled  by  large  capital \ninvestments;  oil  and  gas  have  received  60%  of  total  investment,  equivalent  to  15%  of  GDP \nduring 2000\u20132005. Two thirds of the oil and gas investment came from the private sector. The \nshare  of  hydrocarbons  in  GDP  will  increase  over  the  medium  term  as  large  projects  come \nonstream,  although  investment  in  the  sector  is  expected  to  taper  off  as  a  share  of  total  fixed \ninvestment (footnote 2). \n \nNonoil output has risen at an average of 7% a year since 2000 and been sustained at \n9. \n25% of total investment, representing 6.5% of GDP during 2000\u20132005. Within the nonoil sector, \nconstruction and services have been the most dynamic. Their combined share in GDP and total \nemployment has increased to 65% and 60% (footnote 2). \n \n10. \nIn  contrast, the  share  of  manufacturing  and  agriculture  in  GDP  has  declined,  reflecting \nlow  capital  investment.  The  average  annual  investment  rate  stood  at  3%  of  GDP  during  the \nperiod,  with  half  of  that  from  the  public  sector.  If  the  investment  rate  in  the  nonoil  sector \nmaintains its recent trend, nonoil growth could remain at 7%\u20138% a year in the medium term\u2014\nand even higher if the Government manages to diversify the economy and stimulate the private \nsector. Removing impediments to regional trade and accession to the World Trade Organization \nwould advance development of both the nonoil and private sectors (footnote 2). \n\n                                                 \n3  The National Fund of Kazakhstan was created in 2001 to accumulate a part of the Government\u2019s oil and mineral \n\nrevenues for stabilization purposes and to save for future generations. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\nPolitical and Regional Background \n\n \n11. \nSmall-  and  medium-sized  enterprise  (SME)  development  is  hampered  by  difficulty  in \naccessing  capital,  especially  debt  financing,  at  sustainable  market  rates;  and  the  lack  of \nconfidence  of  SME  entrepreneurs  in  the  banking  subsector,  which  is  still  burdened  with  an \nimage created during the Soviet time. In an economy where access to capital is constrained and \nbanks have a legacy problem of attracting customers, as they are not seen as reliable funding \nsources,  serious  negative  consequences  can  arise.  These  hurdles  must  be  overcome  if \nKazakhstan  wants  to  move  out  of  its  heavy  dependence  on  oil  exports  and  develop  the  SME \nsegment, especially manufacturing. \n \n12. \nContinuing  growth,  job  creation  in  the  private  sector,  and  pro-poor  growth  have  raised \nliving standards. In 2004, real per capita incomes rose by 13%. The percentage of people living \nbelow  the  subsistence  minimum 4  fell  from  19.8%  in  2003  to  15.0%  in  2004.  Unemployment \ndeclined from 8.8% in 2003 to 8.4% in 2004.  \n \nB. \n \n13. \nKazakhstan  became  an  independent  sovereign  state  in  1991  as  a  result  of  the \ndissolution  of  the  former  Soviet  Union.  Since  then,  Kazakhstan  has  experienced  significant \nchange as it emerged from a single party political system and a centrally controlled command \neconomy to a market-oriented, democratic model. The transition was initially marked by political \nuncertainty and tension, a recessionary economy marked by high inflation and instability of the \nlocal currency, and rapid but incomplete changes in the legal environment. \n \nSince 1992, Kazakhstan has actively pursued a program  of economic reform designed \n14. \nto establish a free-market economy through privatization of state enterprises and deregulation; it \nis  more  advanced  in  this  respect  than  some  other  countries  of  the  Commonwealth  of \nIndependent States. However, as with any transition economy, no assurance can be given that \nsuch reforms and other reforms described elsewhere in this proposal will continue or that such \nreforms will achieve all or any of their intended aims. \n \n15. \nKazakhstan depends on neighboring states to access world markets for a number of its \nmajor exports, including oil, steel, copper, ferro-alloys, iron ore, aluminum, coal, lead, zinc, and \nwheat. Kazakhstan is thus dependent upon good relations with its neighbors to ensure its ability \nto  export.  In  addition  to  taking  various  steps  to  promote  regional  economic  integration  among \nneighboring  countries,  Kazakhstan  signed  an  agreement  in  September  2003  with  Belarus, \nRussian Federation, and Ukraine to create a single economic zone, which is expected to result \nin  common  economic  policies,  harmonization  of  legislation  implementing  such  policies,  and \ncreation of a single commission on trade and tariffs. The aim of the single economic zone is to \ncreate  a  free  customs  area  within  which  member  countries  would  enjoy  free  movement  of \ngoods, services, capital, and labor. Another step toward integration is that the member countries \nalso intend to look at ways to coordinate their fiscal policies, credit and currency policies, and \ngovernment policies. These efforts will support economic integration within the Commonwealth \nof Independent States, one of the aims of which is to assure continued access to export routes. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n4  The subsistence minimum is a measure of poverty. Calculated by the State Statistics Agency, it comprises the cost \nof a basket of 70% food items and 30% goods and services. The poverty line is established as a fixed percentage \nof the subsistence minimum, and is used for determining  households\u2019 social assistance allowances and eligibility \nfor such assistance. In 2004, the subsistence minimum was T5,427 or equivalent to $40 a month. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n15\n\nMacroeconomic Considerations and Exchange Rate Policies \n\nC. \n \n16. \nSince Kazakhstan is heavily dependent upon export trade and commodity prices, it was \nparticularly  affected  by  the  Asian  financial  crisis  in  early  1998  and  by  the  Russian  Federation \ncrisis later that year, both of which exacerbated the problems associated with falling commodity \nprices.  Because  Kazakhstan\u2019s  economy  is  negatively  affected  by  low  commodity  prices  and \neconomic  instability  elsewhere  in  the  world,  the  Government  has  promoted  economic  reform, \ninward  foreign  investment,  and  diversification  of  the  economy.  Notwithstanding  these  efforts, \nlow  commodity  prices  and  weak  demand  in  its  export  markets  may  adversely  affect \nKazakhstan\u2019s economy in the future. \n \n17. \nThe  Government  began  implementing  market-based  economic  reforms  in  1992, \nincluding a significant privatization program, promotion of high levels of foreign direct investment \n(particularly  in  the  oil  and  gas  sectors),  and  introduction  of  an  extensive  legal  framework. \nDespite  uneven  progress,  Kazakhstan  has  experienced  extensive  economic  transformation \nduring  the  last  12  years.  Since  mid-1994,  the  Government  has  adhered  to  a  macroeconomic \nstabilization  program  aimed  at  curtailing  inflation,  reducing  the  fiscal  deficit,  and  boosting \ninternational  currency  reserves.  According  to  figures  compiled  by  Kazakhstan\u2019s  National \nStatistical Agency, GDP has continued to grow in real terms following the adoption of a floating \nexchange rate policy in April 1999. It rose by 13.5% in 2001, 9.8% in 2002, 9.2% in 2003, and \n9.4%  in  2004.  However,  no  assurance  can  be  given  that  GDP  will  continue  to  grow,  and  any \ndecrease  in  GDP  or  in  the  rate  of  GDP  growth  in  subsequent  years  could  adversely  affect \nKazakhstan\u2019s development. \n \nThe  tenge  is  convertible  for  current  account  transactions,  although  it  is  not  a  fully \n18. \nconvertible currency outside Kazakhstan. Between 1991, when Kazakhstan began its transition \nto a market-based economy, and April 1999, NBK maintained a managed exchange rate policy. \nThis  policy,  although  permitting  the  general  trend  in  the  exchange  rate  to  reflect  market \nconditions, involved official intervention aimed at limiting fluctuations. Depressed export markets \nin  1998  and  early  1999  caused  considerable  pressure  on  Kazakhstan\u2019s  managed  exchange \nrate, and resulting official intervention in the foreign exchange markets led to losses on foreign \ncurrency  reserves.  In  response  to  these  pressures,  the  authorities  instituted  a  number  of \nexpenditure cuts; took revenue-increasing measures; and in April 1999, NBK floated the tenge. \nThe tenge fell by 64.6% against the dollar as of 31 December 1999, compared to a depreciation \nof 10.7% as of 31 December 1998. Following the adoption of a floating exchange rate policy in \n1999,  the  tenge  continued  to  depreciate  against  the  dollar,  although  at  a  much  slower  rate.  It \ndepreciated  by  4.6%  in  2000,  3.8%  in  2001,  and  3.3%  in  2002.  The  tenge  subsequently \nappreciated against the dollar by 7.3% during 2003 and 9.9% during 2004. Then during the first \n6  months  of  2005,  it  depreciated  against  the  dollar  by  4.0%,  to  T135.26  as  of  30  June  2005. \nSince  then  the  tenge  has  gradually  appreciated  against  the  dollar;  as  of  11  May  2006,  NBK \nreported the official T/$ exchange rate as T122.87/$1. \n \n19.  While NBK has stated that it has no plans to resume a managed exchange rate policy, \nany  subsequent  decision  to  support  the  exchange  rate  could  have  an  adverse  impact  on \nKazakhstan\u2019s public finances and economy. \n \nD. \n \nNBK maintains a managed floating currency regime and does not set any official targets \n20. \nfor the tenge exchange rate. It uses interventions on the foreign exchange market as one of the \ntools  to  manage  systemic  liquidity.  Monetary  policy  implementation  is  complicated  by  strong \n\nMonetary Policy \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\nthe  domestic \n\nRegulation of Banking  \n\nliquidity  produced  by  NBK \n\nprivate capital inflows, rising oil earnings, and buoyant domestic demand. M3 increased 49.2% \nper  annum  on  average  during  2000\u20132004,  and  was  up  a  further  50.2%  in  2005.  Cash  in \ncirculation  expanded  34%  per  annum  on  average  during  2000\u20132004,  and  increased  another \n35% in 2005. The big buildup of money in the National Reserve Fund ($8.2 billion, or 14.4% of \nGDP  as  of  the  end  of  February  2006),  along  with  selling  short-term  notes  and  deposits,  has \nassisted  partial  sterilization  of \ninterventions. \nNevertheless,  the  authorities  are  worried  about  the  rise  in  monetary  pressure  on  the  overall \ninflation  process.  With  no  formal  target,  the  Government  aims  to  keep  annual  inflation  in  the \n5%\u20137% range during 2006\u20132008 to ensure a stable macroeconomic environment; in February \n2006  the  consumer  price  index  increased  to  8.7%.  During  the  next  2  years,  stronger  social \nspending along with further tax cuts will continue to put upward pressure on disposable income \ngrowth  and  consequently  prices.  Market  observers  therefore  expect  that  with  some  easing  of \nthe tight fiscal stance, greater exchange rate flexibility will be allowed to keep inflation in check. \nNBK might allow the tenge to appreciate in 2006/07 to restrain price expansion. \n \nE. \n \n21. \nIn September 1995, NBK introduced strict prudential requirements for the operation and \ncapital  adequacy  of  banks.  In  addition,  an  institutional  development  plan  was  prepared  for \nleading Kazakhstan banks. According to the plan, banks are required to prepare their accounts \nin accordance with international financial reporting standards and to apply the Basel Committee \nnorms  within  the  period  determined  by  NBK  on  a  case-to-case  basis.  Further,  Kazakhstan \nbanks are required to join a bank-funded deposit insurance scheme and be audited annually by \na public accountancy firm approved by NBK, which is likely to be one of the leading international \nfirms.  Following  legislative  changes  in  July  2003,  the  Financial  Markets  Supervisory  Agency \nwas  formed,  and  as  of  1  January  2004  it  took  responsibility  for  most  of  the  supervisory  and \nregulatory functions in the financial sector, which had previously been performed by NBK. The \nagency\u2019s main task is to regulate and supervise the financial markets and financial institutions in \nKazakhstan. \n \nF. \n \nThe  need  for  substantial  investment  in  many  enterprises  has  driven  the  Government\u2019s \n22. \nprivatization  program.  The  program  has  excluded  certain  enterprises  deemed  strategically \nsignificant  by  the  Government,  although  major  privatizations  in  key  sectors  have  taken  place, \nsuch as full or partial sales of certain large oil and gas producers, mining companies, and the \nnational telecommunications company. However, a need remains for substantial investment in \nmany  sectors  of  the  Kazakhstan  economy  and  in  some  areas  economic  performance  in  the \nprivate sector is still constrained by inadequate business infrastructure. Furthermore, the extent \nof noncash transactions in the economy and the size of the shadow economy adversely affect \nimplementation  of  reforms  and  hamper  the  efficient  collection  of  taxes.  The  Government  has \nstated that it intends to address these problems by improving bankruptcy procedures, business \ninfrastructure,  and  tax  administration;  as  well  as  by  continuing  the  privatization  process. \nImplementation  of  these  measures  in  the  short  term  has  produced  few  positive  results,  and \nimproved results may not materialize until the medium term, if at all. \n \n \n \n\nImplementation of Market-Based Economic Reforms \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n17\n\nBANKING AND CAPITAL MARKETS IN KAZAKHSTAN \n\n \n1. \nEncouraged  by  the  improving  macroeconomic  environment  and  robust  growth,  Kazakh \nbanks have increased lending volumes by an average of more than 40% per year during the last \n5  years  (albeit  from  a  very  low  base),  while  generally  maintaining  healthy  asset  quality  and \nprofitability. This is especially true for the top performers within the first two tiers of the banking \nsystem.  Market  observers  expect  this  pace  of  growth  to  be  sustained  for  the  coming  years. \nWhile focusing mainly on the domestic market, some Kazakh banks are increasingly expanding \ntheir  operations  in  other  regional  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States  countries,  including \nKyrgyz  Republic,  Russian  Federation,  and  Ukraine,  in  order  to  expand  and  diversify  their \nbusinesses and market exposure. \n \nA. \n\nOverview of the Kazakh Banking Market \n\n2. \nCommercial banks in Kazakhstan can be divided into four groups: (i) large local banks \n(tier I banks),1 such as Bank TuranAlem JSC and its principal competitors, Kazkommertsbank \nand  Halyk  Bank;  (ii)  banks  under  foreign  ownership,  such  as  ABN  AMRO  Bank  Kazakhstan, \nHSBC Bank Kazakhstan, and Citibank Kazakhstan; (iii) second tier (tier II banks) medium-sized \nbanks  with  regional  operations;  and  (iv)  smaller  local  banks.  The  decrease  in  the  number  of \nbanks from 184 in 1996 to the current 342 is primarily attributable to the ongoing sector reform \nundertaken by the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK).  \n \n3. \nThree  dominant  banks\u2014Bank  TuranAlem,  Halyk  Bank,  and  Kazkommertsbank\u2014\ncollectively represented 55.8% of total system assets and 50.7% of capital as of 30 June 2006. \nEstablished  in  1990,  Kazkommertsbank  is  the  country\u2019s  largest  bank  in  terms  of  assets  and \nsecond  largest  as  measured  by  shareholders\u2019  equity.  It  had  total  assets  of  $9.85  billion  and \ncapital  of  $734.8  million  as  of  30  June  2006.  Bank  TuranAlem  is  the  second  largest  bank  in \nterms  of  assets  ($9.68  billion)  and  the  leading  bank  in  terms  of  capital  ($1.03  billion).  Halyk \nBank  is  the  third  largest  bank  in  terms  of  assets\u2014approximately  $6.44  billion.  In  the  past  few \nyears, however, the tier II banks have been increasingly taking more market share from the tier I \nbanks. In particular, the big three banks\u2019 collective market share declined from 62.3% in 2003 to \n55.8% as of 30 June 2006. This trend is expected to continue into the coming years.  \n \n4. \nBanking reform began in 1996 with the introduction of international prudential standards, \nincluding  requirements  on  capital  adequacy,  liquidity  ratios,  transparency  as  to  the  auditing  of \nbanks  by  local  and  international  auditors,  harmonization  of  local  accounting  practices  to \ninternational  financial  reporting  standards,  and  personnel  training  programs.  In  addition,  NBK \nrequired commercial banks to adopt recapitalization and corporate enhancement plans with the \naim  of  boosting  their  abilities  to  attract  long-term,  private  investors.  In  2000,  guidelines  were \nestablished  for  bank  inspections  and  for  periodic  reporting  by  commercial  banks  to  NBK  (and \nnow  also  to  the  Financial  Markets  Supervisory  Agency,  which  currently  is  the  banking \nsupervision  body  in  Kazakhstan).  In  2003,  all  banks  were  requested  to  develop  and  install \ninternal risk management systems. \n  \n\n                                                 \n1  Technically, the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) would be the first tier. The terminology used here therefore \n\nonly refers to commercial banks below NBK. \n\n2  As  of  August  2005,  34  banks  were  operating  in  Kazakhstan,  excluding  the  National  Bank  of  Kazakhstan, \nincluding two fully state-owned special-purpose banks and 14 banks under foreign ownership. As of mid-2004, 27 \nforeign banks had representative offices in the country. \n\n \n\n\f \n18 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\nAccording  to  published  financial  statements,  the  total  assets  of  the  banking  system \n5. \nincreased by 60% in 2004 and 68% in 2005, and as of 30 June 2006 amounted to $46.52 billion. \nDuring the same period, the total capital of the banking system increased by 46% in 2004 and \n63%  in  2005,  and  as  of  30  June  2006  amounted  to  approximately  $4.6  billion  (Table  A2.1 \nprovides details). \n \n\nTable A2.1: Structure of Banking Aggregate Liabilities  \n(as of 1 January 2006) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nfrom  other  banks  and  organizations \n\nAmount \n(T billion) \n2,533 \n185 \n3 \n27 \n577 \n\n \nLiability \nClient deposits \nInterbank deposits \nLoans from the Government \nLoan from international financial organizations \nLoans \nperforming certain types of banking operations \nREPO transactions with securities \nSubordinated debt \nOutstanding securities \nOther creditors \n \nREPO = repossessed. \nSource:  Agency  of  the  Republic  of  Kazakhstan  on  Regulation  and  Supervision  of  Financial  Market  and \nFinancial Organizations. \n\n \n% of Total  \n62.2 \n4.5 \n0.1 \n0.7 \n14.2 \n\n4.0 \n4.5 \n6.7 \n3.1 \n100.0 \n\n164 \n185 \n273 \n128 \n4,073 \n\nTotal \n\n \nB. \n\nCredit Standing of Commercial Banks \n\nThe financial standings of Kazakhstan\u2019s banks vary. As of 30 September 2005, 18 of the \n6. \n34 commercial banks had registered capital of over T2 billion, 15 banks had share capital of T1 \nbillion to T2 billion, and one bank had registered capital of T500 million to T1 billion. No banks \nhave  registered  capital  of  less  than  T500  million,  and  any  bank  whose  capital  falls  below  this \nlevel  is  required  to  submit  an  application  for  voluntary  reorganization  into  an  entity  performing \nonly  limited  banking  operations  to  the  Financial  Markets  Supervisory  Agency.  As  of  30 \nSeptember  2005,  aggregate  provisions  of  Kazakh  banks  on  overdue  receivables  were  T52.5 \nbillion. \n \n7. \nAs  of  31  December  2005,  all  of  the  commercial  banks  licensed  in  Kazakhstan  were  in \ncompliance with prudential regulatory requirements on capital adequacy, single borrower limits, \nliquidity ratios, foreign currency limits, and reserve requirements. As of 31 December 2004, two \ncommercial  banks  had  failed  to  comply  with  seven  prudential  regulatory  requirements, \ncompared to one noncompliant bank as of 31 December 2003 and one as of 31 December 2002. \nThe noncompliant banks did not meet any of the current liquidity ratios, own capital ratios, single \nborrower  exposure  ratio,  open  currency  position  ratio,  and  maximum  asset  investment  ratio. \nProvisions  for  bad  debts  of  all  banks  operating  in  the  Kazakhstan  banking  subsector  as  of  31 \nAugust 2005 totaled T52.5 billion. \n \nC. \n\nAccess to Funds \n\n8. \nTotal  liabilities  of  the  banking  system  increased  by  68.4%  to  T4,073  billion  as  of  1 \nJanuary 2006 (Table A2.1). The most significant impact was on client deposits, which increased \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n19\n\nOverview of Kazakh Capital Markets \n\nby 56.5% to T2,533 billion and accounted for 62.2% of aggregate banking system liabilities. The \nincrease was attributed to a combination of economic growth and rise in population income. \n \n9.  \nThe  lack  of  a  well-functioning  domestic  interbank  market  continues  to  hamper  the \nliquidity  management  of  banks.  Interbank  deposits  only  account  for  4.5%  of  the  aggregate \nbanking  system\u2019s  liabilities.  The  banks  are  therefore  turning  to  the  international  debt  capital \nmarkets  for  funding  enabled  by  the  improving  country  rating.  Access  to  the  international  loan \nmarkets by medium-sized banks has also improved. Several banks were able to raise financing \nfrom the international loan market. \n \nD. \n \nThree types of government securities are available: T-bills, T-bonds, and inflation-linked \n10. \nand variable bonds. Due to the high oil revenues and a cautious fiscal stance, the Government \ndoes not need to borrow in the local debt market. Due to the growth of the pension fund system \nin  Kazakhstan,  the  country  has  a  serious  shortage  of  good  domestic  long-term  investment \nassets  for  these  funds.

Turnover of the corporate sector only accounted for around \n3.4%  of  total  turnover  in  2005.  The  most  active  participants  in  the  exchange  (i.e.,  buying  and \nselling  securities)  are  the  banks,  such  as  Bank  TuranAlem,  Kazkommertsbank,  ATF  Bank, \nEurasian Bank, and Alliance Bank. \n \n\nTable A2.2: Comparative Data on Kazakhstan Stock Exchange Turnover  \n($ million) \n\nYTD \nJune \n2006 \n12,687 \n2,189 \n800 \n1,800 \n39,854 \n57,331 \n\n \n2004 % \nof Total \n16.1 \n9.4 \n1.7 \n1.4 \n71.4 \n100.0 \n\nJune \n2006 % \nof Total \n22.1 \n3.8 \n1.4 \n3.1 \n69.5 \n100.0 \n\n \n2005 % \nof Total \n15.0 \n5.9 \n1.3 \n2.1 \n75.7 \n100.0 \n\n \n2005 \nVolume \n12,044 \n4,754 \n1,040 \n1,715 \n60,848 \n80,403 \n\n \n2004 \nVolume \n9,449 \n5,558 \n977 \n853 \n42,012 \n58,850 \n\n \n \n \nMarket Sector \nForeign Exchange \nGovernment Securities \nCorporate Shares \nCorporate Bonds \nRepurchasea\n \nTotal \nYTD = year-to-date. \na Corporate and government securities. \nNote: Only deals of the primary market and purchase-sale deals on the secondary market, including state blocks of \nshares  are  considered  in  the  sector  of  equities  and  corporate  bonds.

Market capitalization of the stock market increased from $3.94 billion in 2004 to $10.52 \nbillion  in  2005,  and  was  $30.56  billion  as  of  June  2006.  The  increase  in  market  capitalization \nwas partly explained by the growth in the number of listed companies from 84 at year-end 2005 \nto 107 in June 2006. Liquidity, however, remains a concern where corporate share turnover only \naccounted for 1.3% of total exchange turnover in 2005 (Table A2.2). Domestic companies still \nfear the loss of control that would result from having institutional minority shareholders, while the \n\n \n\n\f \n20 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\ninstitutional investors are concerned about insufficient protection of their minority interests.

The  financial  sector  remains  the  leader  in  terms  of  debt  issuance.  The  debt  securities \nmarket  capitalization  is  estimated  at  $10.4  billion,  which  is  63%  higher  than  in  2005.  It  is \ncharacterized  by  a  large  volume  of  consumer  price  index-linked  bonds  due  to  increasing \ninflation and an overall yield increase due to the rise in inflation and instruments supply. \n \n14. \nDomestic  pension  funds  have  increasingly  emerged  as  important  investors  in  the  local \nbond  market  since  the  launch  of  pension  reform  in  1998.

In  the \ncase  of  pension  fund  assets,  these  are  heavily  concentrated  from  a  portfolio  management \nperspective.  NBK  bills  and  corporate  bonds  account  for  34%  and  26%  of  total  assets; \nGovernment  bonds,  including  municipal  bonds,  account  for  19%  and  are  declining  as  the \nGovernment  seeks  to  reduce  its  domestic  burden.

By late 2004, it had \ngrown  to  represent  31%  of  the  $23  trillion  United  States  bond  market,  with  home  mortgages \nrepresenting the majority of the securitized assets. Although securitization in Europe took longer \nto establish, securitization issuance increased from $50 billion to $500 billion between 1998 and \n2003. \n \nAlthough securitization has gained wide acceptance in other parts of the world, it is still \n2. \nin  its  nascent  stages  in  Asia.  Issuance  of  asset-backed  securities  in  the  region  has  been \ndominated by Australia, Japan, and Republic of Korea, which account for around two thirds of \noverall  issuance,  followed  by  Hong  Kong,  China;  Malaysia;  Singapore;  and  Taipei,China.  A \nstrong  argument  can  be  made  favoring  the  growth  of  asset  securitization  in  countries  with \ndeveloping  capital  markets.  Many  Asian  countries  are  uniquely  positioned  to  gain  from  the \nevolution of securitization in the region. \n \nFor Asian corporations, asset securitization provides a new and potentially cheaper form \n3. \nof  financing.  For  loan  originators  such  as  banks,  securitization  is  a  means  of  removing  assets \nfrom  the  balance  sheet,  while  retaining  most  of  the  economic  benefits  associated  with  the \nassets  and  of  freeing  up  capital  to  support  further  loan  underwriting,  while  better  matching \nassets and liabilities. For investors in Asia, including banks, unit trusts, and pension funds, the \nsecurities issued offer yields exceeding those on comparable corporate bonds, while providing \nan opportunity to diversify a fixed-income portfolio by adding another class of securities. \n \nA. \n\nBackground \n\n4. \nSecuritization is a form of financing that involves the pooling of financial assets and the \nissuance  of  securities  that  are  repaid  from  the  cash  flows  generated  by  these  assets.  This  is \ngenerally  accomplished  by  a  true  sale  of  the  assets  to  a  bankruptcy  remote  vehicle,  which \nfinances  the  purchase  through  the  issuance  of  bonds  backed  by  the  future  cash  flows  of  the \nasset pool. This achieves the outcome of creating a class of securities for which the underlying \nrisk is independent from that of the originating institution, and generally of a higher credit quality. \n \n5. \nAsset-backed  securitization  is  a  highly  structured  financing  technique  that  provides  an \nentity  with  an  economical  means  of  financing  without  the  added  burden  of  increasing  debt \nand/or equity. In its simplest form, securitization is a process whereby the revenue stream of a \nsegregated pool of receivables or other income-producing (mostly financial) assets owned by an \noriginal  lender  or  commercial  enterprise  (originator)  is  repackaged  into  tradable  securities \nissued  to  investors.  The  receivables  are  sold  by  the  originator  to  a  specially  incorporated,  off-\nbalance-sheet company or trust, known as a special purpose vehicle (SPV). In return, the SPV \nwill generally pay a purchase amount equal to the (par or net present) value of the receivables, \nwith limited recourse or no recourse against the originator for nonperformance of the underlying \ndebtors.  \n\nIn  the  emerging  markets,  securitization  has  been  growing  quickly.  Initially,  most \n6. \ntransactions  involved  the  securitization  of  future  offshore  cash  flows  derived  from  exports  and \nremittances. Such structures, generally referred to as future flow transactions, are driven by the \nneed  for  borrowers  to  raise  relatively  cheap  cross-border  financing.  This  is  achieved  by \nmitigating  the  currency  transfer  risk  that  would  otherwise  be  present  in  their  corporate \nborrowings.  More  recently,  as  many  developing  countries  have  begun  adopting  the  legal  and \nregulatory reforms necessary for the domestic issuance of securitization, the bulk of activity has \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nStructure \n\nshifted  to  local  markets.  Although  future  flow  transactions  do  play  a  role  in  local  markets,  the \nsecuritization of existing assets has seen the largest growth. \n \n7. \nSecuritization  is  most  appropriate  for  a  company  that  is  seeking  balance  sheet \nmanagement,  or  a  company  with  a  specific  pool  of  assets  that  is  better  than  its  overall  credit \nquality. In principle, any assets pool with predictable cash flows can be securitized, even those \nthat are nonperforming, as long as the timing and amount of recovery is predictable. The most \ncommon  assets  for  securitization  include  mortgages,  credit  cards,  auto  and  consumer  loans, \ncorporate debt, export receivables, and offshore remittances. \n \nB. \n \nAt the center of a securitization is an SPV set up by the originator of the financial assets \n8. \nto  be  securitized.  The  SPV  purchases  the  financial  asset  receivables  (e.g.,  mortgages,  small- \nand medium-sized enterprise loans) from the originator. The SPV will be structured to control its \nincome and expenses so that it will be \u201cbankruptcy remote.\u201d1 The SPV will fund the purchase of \nthe  receivables  through  the  issue  of  debt  securities  to  investors,  which  will  be  secured  on  the \nreceivables by virtue of a security interest granted to a security trustee acting for the investors \nand  other  creditors.  The  originator  (or  an  associated  company)  may  continue  to  act  as  the \nservicer  in  collecting  and  administering  the  receivables  as  an  agent  of  the  SPV,  which  in  turn \nwill apply the income from the receivables to make payment of principal and interest under the \ndebt  securities  as  well  as  transaction  expenses.  A  standby  servicer  may  also  be  arranged  in \ncase  the  originator  fails  to  perform  its  servicing  obligations.  Funds  received  by  the  SPV  in \nexcess of those required to pay investors are generally channeled back to the originator. Thus, \nsecuritization enables nontradable assets that range in marketability, creditworthiness, and size \nto become liquid secondary instruments through repackaging and cash-flow structuring.  \n\n9. \nTo obtain the lowest all-in cost of financing for the asset originator, the risk inherent in \nthe  asset  pool  is  often  structured  to  create  two  or  more  layers  of  risk.  These  layers  are  often \nreferred to as tranches. Typically, the expected loss on the portfolio is identified and placed in a \njunior  (also  referred  to  as  equity)  tranche  that  is  retained  by  the  originator.  Requiring  the \noriginator  to  fully  absorb  the  initial  losses  helps  to  mitigate  the  moral  hazard  that  would \notherwise  be  present  if  one  entity  was  to  originate  the  portfolio,  but  not  have  a  stake  in  its \neventual performance. \n \n10. \nThe next tranche of risk is often referred to as mezzanine, which is generally structured \nto  absorb  losses  that  are  not  necessarily  expected,  but  that  may  reasonably  occur  if \nperformance  of  the  portfolio  is  much  worse  than  anticipated.  With  the  proper  amount  of \nsubordination,  derived  from  the  junior  and  mezzanine  tranches,  a  highly  rated  senior  tranche \ncan  then  be  structured  that  is  generally  deemed  to  comprise  relatively  little  risk.  If  adequately \nstructured,  this  senior  tranche  achieves  a  risk-reward  combination  sufficient  to  attract \ninstitutional investors. \n \n11. \nVarious  forms  of  credit  and  liquidity  enhancement  will  be  used  and  structured  into  the \ntransaction cash flow to ensure that payments on the debt securities issued to the investors are \n\n                                                 \n1  A key concern in securitization transactions is to ensure that the transfer of assets of the originator to the SPV is \nnot affected by bankruptcy or distress of the originator. This necessitates certain legal precautions in structuring the \nassignment  of  receivables,  and  also  constituting  the  SPV  that  it  can  neither  be  taken  to  liquidation  by  the \nshareholders of the originator, nor by those of the SPV itself. Further, the structure should also ensure that the SPV \nwould  not  be  treated  as  the  subset  of  the  originator  by  substantive  consolidation.  Such  a  structure  is  called  a \nbankruptcy remote structure. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n23\n\nmade in full and on a timely basis. Consequently, the recourse of the investors is usually limited \nto  (i)  receivables,  (ii)  transaction  cash  flow,  and  (iii)  credit  enhancement  incorporated  in  the \nsecuritization  structure.  A  high  credit  rating  (usually  higher  than  that  of  the  originator)  on  the \ndebt  securities  and  therefore  cheaper  funding  can  be  obtained  by  reason  of  the  quality  of  the \nreceivables, the isolation of the receivables from the other risks of the originator\u2019s business (by \narranging a \u201ctrue\u201d sale of the receivables from the originator to the SPV), and the arrangements \nfor credit enhancement and liquidity support.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nBENEFITS OF SECURITIZATION1\n\nA. \n\nHow Originators Benefit \n\nOriginators (the selling bank) gain from securitization by obtaining many of the benefits \n1. \nof  high-credit  quality  financing  without  retaining  the  debt  on  their  books  and  without  forgoing \nprofitable  aspects  of  the  assets,  including  origination,  servicing,  expansion  of  business,  and \nretention  of  excess  spread.  The  technique  for  determining  the  price  paid  can  be  complex  and \nmay require a significant initial investment of managerial and financial resources. Some relevant \nadvantages include the following: \n \n\nAssets  removed  from  the  balance  sheet.  If  structured  as  a  true  sale, \nsecuritization  can  allow  the  originator  to  reduce  its  assets  and  debt,  thereby \nincreasing  its  scope  for  borrowing.  Securitization  allows  a  bank  or  business  to \nachieve greater leverage. \n\nLower financing costs. Well-regarded pools of assets owned by a company or \nbank can be used to structure a security of higher credit quality, and therefore, of \nlower market cost than the corporate entity could issue itself. \n\nReduction  in  required  capital.  For  a  bank  or  finance  company  that  faces \nregulatory  capital  requirements,  a  securitization  transaction  that  qualifies  as  a \nsale  of  assets  for  bank  regulatory  purposes  reduces  the  need  for  equity \nfinancing. The latter may be costly and hard to obtain, and may dilute control. \n\nRecognition  of  gains  (or \nlosses).  Depending  on  accounting  rules,  a \nsecuritization  structured  as  a  sale  of  assets  may  allow  a  seller  to  recognize  an \naccounting  gain  (or  loss)  equal  in  the  aggregate  to  the  present  value  of  any \nexpected  future  cash  flows  payable  to  the  seller  that  will  be  derived  from  the \nassets. \n\n(v) \n\nAccess to an alternative source of finance and class of investors. \n\n \n\n \nB. \n\nHow Investors Benefit  \n\n2. \nAsset-backed  securities  are  not  suitable  for  all  investors:  they  are  more  complex,  and \nmay  be  less  liquid  than  other  debt  securities.  Nevertheless,  many  investors  find  that  asset-\nbacked securities open up attractive new investment opportunities for the following reasons: \n\nSuperior return. The main benefit from the investor's viewpoint is a higher return \nor spread than is generally available on corporate or sovereign debt of a similar \nrating. \n\nLiquidity.  The  securitization  structure  offers  far  greater  liquidity  than  the \nindividual loans backing the transaction. \n\nDiversification.  Investors  gain  an  opportunity  to  diversify  their  portfolios  by \nparticipating in a different class of assets. \n\n(iv)  Mitigation  of  event  risk.  Unlike  similar,  high-rated  corporate  bonds,  asset-\nbacked  securities  are  largely  immune  from  event  risk.  The  latter  results  from \n\n                                                 \n1  Based on Giddy, Ian H. 2000. Asset Securitization in Asia.

Many  institutional  investors  are  constrained  to \npurchase  only  investment  grade  securities,  and  some  are  limited  to  triple-A \npaper. Both requirements can be met in the securitization market.  \n\nHow the National Economy Benefits \n\nThe  effect  of  securitization  on  the  economies  of  different  countries  is  still  difficult  to \n3. \nassess  because  the  technique  is  in  its  infancy  in  many  parts  of  the  world.  Nevertheless,  in \ncountries  such  as  Australia,  Canada,  United  Kingdom,  and  United  States,  where  a  high \nproportion  of  residential  mortgages  and  other  claims  have  been  securitized,  the  gains  to  the \nnational  economy  can  be  measured  in  the  billions  of  dollars.  In  the  United  States  alone,  for \nexample,  at  least  $1,600  billion  of  mortgage-  and  asset-backed  securities  are  outstanding. \nAccording  to  a  conservative  estimate,  securitization  in  the  United  States  reduces  the  annual \ncost  ($1,600  billion)  of  financing  for  homeowners  and  others  by  0.5%,  freeing  up  $8  billion  of \nresources each year.  \n \n4. \nintroduced in a transparent and orderly fashion, offers Asian countries additional gains from \n \n\nBut the case for securitization is actually even stronger than this.

Over the \npast  15  years  and  through  2005,  approximately  $54.2  billion  in  future  flow  export  receivables \ntransactions  have  occurred.  Since  2002,  financial  remittances  have  become  the  most  popular \nfuture  flow  asset  class,  with  $13.2  billion  of  remittances/diversified  payment  rights  (DPR) \nsecuritizations.  \n \nThe  first  major  securitization  deal  involving  migrant  remittances  occurred  in  1994  in \n2. \nMexico.  During  2000\u20132004,  a  total  of  $10.4  billion  was  raised  through  DPR  securitization  by \nBrazil, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru and Turkey.1 2005 was the highest issuance year with close to \n$10 billion in total volume.2\n \nA. \n \nLatin  America  has  traditionally  been  the  strongest  originator  of  future  flow  receivables. \n3. \nIssuers such as Mexico\u2019s Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos (Pemex), which in 1996 placed $6.0 billion, and \nVenezuela\u2019s PDVSA Finance Ltd., placing $3.4 billion, have enhanced Latin America\u2019s volume \nover  the  years.  Until  2001,  Mexico  had  always  been  the  dominating  country  for  future  flow \nissuance. Prior to the upsurge in volume in Turkey in 2005, Brazil had taken over as the primary \nsource  for  future  flow  paper.  This  is  mainly  due  to  the  countries\u2019  sovereign  ratings.  Mexican \nissuers,  because  they  are  domiciled  in  an  investment-grade  country,  are  less  in  need  of  the \nstructural  protections  provided  by  future  flow.  Brazil  (and  Turkey  in  2005)  on  the  other  hand, \nwhich has been rated between B and BB since 2001, is a market where future flow is useful in \nmitigating  sovereign-related  risks  and  opens  access  to  international  capital  markets  for  strong \ncompanies.  \n \nWhile  Mexico,  Brazil,  and  Turkey  could  be  considered  the  historical  leaders,  other \n4. \ncountries  have  also  had  significant  amounts  of  issuance.  Argentina  has  produced  more  than \n$3.5 billion, although amounts have been limited since the 2001 financial crisis. Top banks from \nvarious Central American countries issued financial remittance future flows. Recently, Indonesia \nreturned  to  the  future  flow  market  with  $600  million  securitization  of  coal  exports.  Finally, \nEastern  Europe  and  the  Russian  Federation  have  shown  significant  potential  as  strong  future \nflow candidates. \n \nB. \n \n5. \nA  future  flow  transaction  securitizes  the  cash  flow  originating  from  a  specific  business \nline of a bank or company that produces goods or services for foreign customers. The structure \nof the future flow transaction is designed to collect cash flows in a dedicated offshore collection \naccount.  The  cash  flows  come  from  a  variety  of  sources,  including  foreign  importers  making \npayments  on  receivables,  international  credit  card  companies  making  settlement  payments  to \nlocal banks, and international banks making remittance transfers to local banks. All cash flows \npass  through  the  offshore  collection  account,  and  the  excess  flows  are  returned  to  the \noriginating entity only after periodic debt-service payments are made.  \n \n\nTransaction Mechanics \n\n                                                 \n1  Dilip  Ratha  Senior  Economist  and  Lead  Author  of  Global  Economic  Prospects  2006:  Economic  Implications  of \n\nRemittances and Migration, World Bank, Washington D.C. 18 November 2005. \n2  Fitch Ratings. Future Flow Securitization Rating Methodology. 15 February 2006. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n27\n\nThe  transaction\u2019s  structure  mitigates  many  sovereign  risks  by  keeping  the  cash  flow \n6. \noffshore  until  the  investors  are  paid.  If  certain  events  occur  (trigger  events),  the  structures \ntypically  trap  all  cash  flows  going  through  the  collection  account  to  accelerate  amortization  of \nthe notes. In some cases, only a portion of excess flows are captured during early amortization \nevents in order to avert a liquidity crisis for an issuer. Ratings of future flow transactions are tied \nto  the  credit  quality  of  the  originator,  which  is  typically  measured  by  its  local  currency  issuer \ndefault rating.  \n \nIn some cases, a transaction\u2019s issuer default rating may be higher than the company\u2019s \n7. \nlocal  currency  issuer  default  rating  because  of  the  company\u2019s  ability  to  continue  operating \nbeyond  a  general  default  and  generate  receivables  for  the  duration  of  the  deal.  The  going \nconcern assessment (Fitch methodology) and survivability assessment (Moody\u2019s) address these \nissues.  Achieving  a  rating  at  this  level  is  a  twofold  concept.  The  company  must  not  only \ncontinue  to  generate  these  receivables  by  producing  and  delivering  the  product,  but  the \ncollections from the receivables must also be legally protected through a true sale structure. In \nsome cases, transactions are rated above the issuing company\u2019s local currency issuer default \nrating but below the going concern/survivability level.  \n \n\nFigure A5: Typical Future Flow Transaction Structure \n\nReceivables \nPayment \n\nObligors \n\nTrust \n\n \nFuture \nProduct \n \n\nFuture \nReceivables \n\nCollections over \nPrincipal and \nInterest \n\nOriginator \n\nPrincipal and \nInterest \n\nInvestors \n\nOffshore \n\nLocal Country \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank analysis. \n\n \n \nC. \n\nFuture Flow Asset Classes \n\n8. \nThe two general types of future flow securitizations are (i) financial future flows backed \nby  banks\u2019  generation  of  hard  currency  flows,  and  (ii)  corporate-related  transactions  typically \ninvolving export receipts of some description.

Corporate-related transactions typically involve airline ticket receivables; telephone \nnet settlements; and the most prevalent, export receivables transactions, which are backed by \nproducts  such  as  oil,  gas,  steel,  iron  ore,  soybean,  paper  and  pulp,  aluminum,  coffee,  and \nchemicals.  \n\n9. \nA  bank  or  company  based  in  an  emerging  market  securitizes  existing  and  future \nreceivables related to offshore cash flows (usually in a stable foreign currency) and receives the \nproceeds  of  the  debt  issuance  denominated  in  the  same  currency.  The  cash  flows  originate \nfrom a specific line of business in which the bank/company has demonstrated consistent strong \nperformance and is expected to continue for the foreseeable future, or at least for the life of the \nstructured deal. In the majority of structures, the bank/company sells its rights to the future flow \nto an offshore special purpose vehicle, which transfers its rights to an offshore trust. The trust \nissues debt securities backed by future cash flows, and remits the sale proceeds to the special \npurpose vehicle, which in turn passes them back to the originating bank/company.  \n\n10. \nBecause note holders have access to payments on the receivables before they return to \nthe  country  in  which  the  issuer  is  located,  they  are  not  believed  to  be  directly  subject  to \nconvertibility  and  transfer  risks.  Thus,  the  ratings  of  these  transactions  are  not  strictly \nconstrained by the foreign currency rating of the host country (the sovereign ceiling). However, \nall sovereign risks are not mitigated by the structure, and transaction ratings are still constrained \nby certain inherent political and economic risks of an emerging-market country. These risks can \narise from such events as government instability, civil unrest, or natural disaster. \n \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \n4   MT100 (including MT102, 103) is the standard message type for payment orders relating to payment from senders \nto payees who are individuals, companies (other than financial institutions), or governments through banks. MT200 \n(including MT202) is the standard message type for payment orders relating to payment from senders to payees \nthat are financial institutions. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n29\n\nFUTURE FLOW SECURITIZATION VOLUMES \n \n \n \nFigure A6.1: Emerging Market Future Flow Issuance by Country/Region \n \n\nPeru, 778\n\nAfrica, 1,900\n\nRussia and Eastern \nEurope, 1,775\n\nTurkey, 11,149\n\nMexico, 18,377\n\nVenezuela, 3,349\n\nAsia, 4,926\n\nCentral America, \n2,020\n\nCarribean, 432\n\nArgentina, 3,560\n\nColombia, 1,492\n\nChile, 200\n\nBrazil, 11,628\n\nSource: Fitch.

The SPV transfers its rights \nto  the  cash  flows  to  an  offshore  trust,  and  then  issues  debt  securities  (notes)  backed  by  the \nfuture cash flows. The sale proceeds from the notes are then transferred from the SPV to the \noriginating bank.  \n \n2. \nThe  cash  flows  sold  are  typically  only  those  payments  received  from  correspondent \nbanks  located  in  highly  rated  countries  such  as  Europe  and  the  United  States.  The \ncorrespondent banks sign a notice and acknowledgment that commits them to sending all future \nreceivables to a trust account held by the SPV. This cash flow is then used to make scheduled \nprincipal and interest payments to the investors; any excess cash is returned to the originator. \n \n3. \nDPR securitization is recognized as an alternative source of long-term capital for banks. \nThe cost of funds is attractive compared to unsecured bonds. The notes usually receive a rating \nhigher than the host country\u2019s foreign currency sovereign rating since (i) the future receivables \nare due from offshore obligors; and (ii) the repayment is made directly by the SPV, which again \nis  located  offshore,  to  the  investor.  The  investment  grade  rating  makes  these  transactions \nattractive  to  a  wider  range  of  investors  such  as  insurance  companies  that  face  limitations  on \nbuying subinvestment grade. The sold receivables also form part of the assets of the SPV and \ntherefore, are not subject to claim of any other creditor in the event of bankruptcy. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n31\n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\u2019S EFFORTS ON REMITTANCES \n \n\nContext of Remittances at ADB \n\n1. \nThe director general of the Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) of the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  initiated  efforts  with  regard  to  remittances  in  2004  by  hiring  a  staff \nconsultant to research the topic of remittances and help craft a strategy for ADB\u2019s involvement \nin  this  arena.  Remittance  initiatives  in  2004  included  organizing  ADB\u2019s  cosponsorship  of  an \nAsia-Pacific  Economic  Cooperation  conference  in  Tokyo,  and  undertaking  the  first  large-scale \nsurvey  of  remittances  conducted  at  ADB.  This  research  effort,  which  studied  the  Philippines \n(one  of  the  world\u2019s  leading  receivers  of  remittances), 1   was  well  received.  In  2005,  ADB \nparticipated in a related survey, this time a regional survey of remittances within Asian countries, \nand  organized  a  major  conference  on  remittances  attracting  more  than  30  speakers  and  350 \nparticipants. During 2005 and 2006, PSOD represented ADB on a global task force organized \nby the World Bank and Bank for International Settlements, which developed global principles for \nremittances that will be finalized in September 2006. This effort indicates that remittances have \nbecome  a  focus  of  development  agencies  in  general,  and  ADB  participation  demonstrates \nADB\u2019s commitment. \n \nA. \n \n2. \nRemittances\u2014the  financial  aspect  of  migration\u2014are  a  matter  of  increasing  national \ninterest for both developed and developing countries. Global remittances in 2005 are estimated \nat $225 billion, and as such represent the second largest flow of external  finance after foreign \ndirect investment, and are twice as large as flows of formal development assistance.   \n \nRemittances have significant importance for development and poverty reduction. In the \n3. \nabsence of an efficient domestic labor market and a social insurance system, remittances are a \nkey  means  for  individuals  to  address  poverty.  In  Tajikistan,  for  example,  the  poverty  rate \ndeclined from 81% to 60% during 2000\u20132003, largely, according to the International Monetary \nFund, as a result of remittance flows. Remittances fuel both consumption and growth; indeed, \ngross  national  disposable  income  was  at  least  15%  higher  than  gross  domestic  product  per \ncapita in Tajikistan in 2004 with the difference attributed to out-of-country remittances.  \n \nRemittances  also  contribute  to  financing  a  country\u2019s  trade  deficit  and  have  a  positive \n4. \nimpact  on  national  current  accounts;  imports  paid  for  with  remittances  increase  government \nrevenues in customs duties and value-added tax. Remittances are more consistent than other \nflows and are countercyclical, which helps to balance economic fluctuations caused by changes \nin  exports,  imports,  or  politics;  and  thus  contributes  to  foreign  exchange  rate  stability. \nRemittances  also  help  strengthen  the  banking  system  and  support  expanded  credit  to  the \nprivate sector by increasing the deposit base to support increased lending.   \n \nB. \n \n \n \nPSOD\u2019s most recent involvement in remittances has been a contribution of $300,000 to \n5. \nthe total project cost of $1,300,000 for a remittance survey in five Central Asian countries, run \nby  ADB\u2019s  Central  and  West  Asia  Department,  which  will  study  both  the  relationship  of \nremittances to poverty and social conditions, and the relationship between remittances and the \nfinancial sector (both formal and informal). The countries covered by the survey will be Armenia, \n\nRemittances in Central Asia \n\nOverview \n\n1. \n\n                                                 \n1  Estimated at $12 billion in 2006. \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nAzerbaijan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan (all  receiving countries), and Kazakhstan (sending \ncountry).

The  sudden  collapse  of  the  Soviet  Union  left  these  countries  and \ngovernments  in  economic  and  social  disarray,  a  condition  that  persists  in  many  parts  of  the \nregion.  The  flow  of  remittances  has  significantly  contributed  to  improved  conditions  in  the \nreceiving countries, and supplied necessary labor inputs to migrant recipient economies.  \n \nLacking  in  national  advantages  such  as  natural  resources  and  large  domestic \n7. \neconomies that characterize some of their Asian neighbors, most of the Central Asian republic \nreceiving  countries  are  small  and  impoverished,  and  the  flow  of  remittances  is  particularly \ncritical to their stability and growth. Indeed, with high unemployment rates despite a high degree \nof literacy and education, many of these receiving countries rely disproportionately on labor as \nan  exportable  resource,  and  on  the  remittances  derived  from  this  resource.  Similarly, \nKazakhstan and the Russian Federation as migrant destination countries have labor shortages \nand would not realize their current economic growth without the infusion of migrant labor. \n \n \n \n8. \nIn  the  case  of  Kazakhstan,  workers\u2019  remittances  and  compensation  for  employees \nreceived was $122 million in 2000, $148 million in 2003, and $167 million in 2004.3 Along with \nthe Russian Federation, Kazakhstan has become a major migrant receiving country among the \nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS)4 in recent years, having lost 20% of its population \ndue  to  mass  emigration  of  Slavic  people,  Germans,  and  Jews  in  the  1990s.  The  initial \nemigration  of  Kazakhstan  nationals  to  more  developed  western  countries  contributes  to  the \ncountry\u2019s inward remittances. Every 10th family in Kazakhstan reportedly depends on migration-\nrelated  earnings  and  remittances  of  their  relatives.5  On  the other  hand, the  entry  of  other  CIS \nnationals  into  Kazakhstan  resulted  in  Kazakhstan  being  identified  as  one  of  the  sources  of \nremittances among the CIS.  \n \n\nRemittances in Kazakhstan \n\n2. \n\n                                                 \n2  The total global flows might be up to 50% higher if unrecorded remittances are included; the informal flows to the \nCommonwealth  of  Independent  States  countries  are  unlikely  to  be  any  different,  so  these  numbers  probably \nunderstate the full picture significantly. Although not covered by this survey, the Russian Federation is the largest \nsource of remittances to the targeted countries, with a total outflow of more than $5.5 billion compared with inflows \nof some $2.7 billion.   \n\n3  World Bank.  \n4  The  CIS  member  states  are  Armenia,  Azerbaijan,  Belarus,  Georgia,  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Moldova, \n\nRussian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. \n\n5  Global Commission on International Migration.  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n33\n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT FRAMEWORK \n \n\nPrivate  Sector  Development  (contribution  to  the  growth  of  viable  financial  sector  and \n\n(cid:131) Development of vibrant cross-border \n\nsecuritization market \n\n \n(cid:131) Development of domestic securitization \n\nGeneral \n(cid:131) Evidence of spillover effects and overall development of bond \n\nmarket in Asia;
