The Government of Pakistan has requested the Bank to\nfinance the foreign exchange cost and part of the local currency cost\nof the Chashma Right Bank Irrigation Project, and for technical\nassistance to assist the Government of Pakistan and the concerned\nProvincial Governments in the preparation of feasibility studies for\nagricultural processing facilities in the Project area. The Project\nis located on the right (west) bank of the Indus River spanning the\nNorth-West Frontier Province (NWFP) and the Province of Punjab,\nand represents the first phase of the overall Chashma Right Bank\nIrrigation Scheme. The Government of Pakistan and the Provincial\nGovernments have accorded high priority to the agricultural development\nof the area.\n3. A feasibility study for the Project was prepared by the Water\nand Power Development Authority (WAPDA) in 1970, and this report\nwas updated in 1973. The Bank sent Fact-Finding Missions to Pakistan\nin October 1976 and June 1977 to discuss the technical aspects of the\nProject with the concerned government agencies. A Bank Appraisal\nMission visited the country from 1 to 23 August 1977. Formal loan\nnegotiations were held in Manila from 9 to 16 November 1977 with\nduly authorized representatives of the Government of the Islamic\nRepublic of Pakistan, the Provincial Governments of NWFP and Punjab,\nand WAPDA. If approved, the proposed Project would be the nd.neteenth\nBank loan project in Pakistan and the first Bank-assisted irrigation\nproject in that country.", "-2-\nII. THE ECONOMY\n4. An Economic Report on Pakistan (Report No. PAK:Ec-5)\nwas circulated to the Board in March 1977. This chapter summarizes\nthe current situation and prospects. The Basic Data are given in\nAppendix 1.\nA. Recent Developments\n5. Widespread floods in August 1976 and political difficulties\nin the later part of the fiscal year 1976/77 caused major setbacks in\nthe achievements of targets both in agriculture and industry. The\nestimated growth rate of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for 1976/77\nwas 0. 5 per cent, compared with 3. 8 per cent in 1975/76. With the\npopulation growing at the rate of 3 per cent per annum, the per capita\nGNP, estimated in 1976 at $170, !/ has declined in real terms in 1977.\n6. The agricultural sector accounts for about 35 per cent of\nGDP, 80 per cent of foreign exchange earnings, and about 55 per cent\nof the total labor force. Agricultural production in 1976/77 was\naffected by the floods and registered an increase of only 1. 0 per\ncent. Most of the increase was due to a record 8. 9 million tons of\nwheat production, a gain of 3. 6 per cent over the previous year.\nHowever, the overall agricultural index showed little increase\nbecause floods devastated the cotton crop reducing output from a\nprojected 4 million bales to 2. 4 million bales.\n7. Domestic production of wheat has been inadequate to meet\nthe nation's requirements; more. than 6 millon tons of wheat was\nimported over the period 1970/71-1976/77, although approximately\n650, 000 tons of rice are exported each year. Average yields of crops\nare low due to traditional cultural practices and short supply of\nagricultural inputs. The country's agricultural development policy\ncalls for increased production of important food and cash crops through\nprovision of agricultural inputs, improvements of irrigation and other\nfacilities, and strengthening of agricultural research and extension\nj/ Preliminary estimate, World Bank.", "-3-\nservices. Agriculture is accorded high priority in the forthcoming\nFifth Development Plan, expected to start in 1978, to achieve\nself-sufficiency in wheat and increased exports of cotton and rice.\n8. The output of the manufacturing sector, which contributes\nabout 15 per cent of GDP, has stagnated. Production continues to\nbe seriously affected by shortages of electric power and domestic\nagricultural raw materials. With disruptions resulting from the\nrecent disturbances, large -scale manufacturing production is estimated\nto have declined by 2 per cent in 1976/77.\n9. The money supply is estimated to have increased by about\n21 per cent for the first three quarters of 19 76/77, a rate marginally\nlower than in 1975/76. Credit to the private sector also expanded\nrapidly. The rate of inflation which reached a peak at 30 per cent in\n197 3/74 declined to 12 per cent in 19 75/76 and to 9 per cent in\n1976/77.\n10. Pakistan's merchandise trade showed a deficit of $1. 1 billion\nin 1974/75 and $1 billion in 1975/76. For 1976/77, the trade deficit is\nestimated to have reached $630 million, largely on account of reduced\nexports of cotton and cotton goods and lower prices for rice exports on\nthe one hand, and higher import prices for oil and tea, on the other.\nThese deficits were fin9.nced mainly by assistance from the Pakistan\nConsortium members,\" OPEC countries and the IMF. On the receipts\nside of the balance of payments, an encouraging factor has been the\nsharp increase in remittances from Pakistanis overseas; from $93\nmillion in 197 1/72 to an estimated $596 million in 1976/77, and current\nexpectations are that such remittances will reach $900 million by 1980.\n11. Domestic resource mobilization, though slightly improved,\nremains one of Pakistan's most serious problems. Deficit financing\nincreased from Rs. 3.9 billion in 1975/76 to Rs. 5. 6 billion in 1976/77.\nExternal resources financed about Rs. 8. 92 billion or 52 per cent of the\n1976/77 Annual Development Plan (ADP) amounting to Rs. 17 billion.\nTax collection has improved and attempts have been made to control\nnon-development expenditures. However, while the subsidies bill has\ni/ In addition to IBRD, IFC and the Bank, the Pakistan Consortium\nincludes Belgium, Canada, France, Federal Republic of Germany, Italy,\nJapan, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, U. K. and U.S.A.", "-4-\nbeen substantially reduced from Rs. 2, 819 million in 1974/75 to\nRs. 593. 8 million in 1976/77, expenditure on defence has continued to\ngrow. In the 1977/78 Budget, non-development expenditures are\nexpected to be about 25 per cent higher than in 19 76/77 with defence\nexpenditures claiming about 45 per cent of the total. New revenue and\ntax measures are expected to increase collection by 15 per cent adding\nRs. 3. 03 billion to existing resource mobilization of Rs. 19. 68 billion.\nAllocation for agriculture in the ADP has increased whereas the share\nof industry has decreased.\n12. As of June 1976, commitments of foreign economic\nassistance to Pakistan which began in 1950, totalled $12.2 billion,\nwith $3. 04 billion being grant and $9. 11 billion being loan assistance\nand credits. Cumulative disbursements of loans totalled $8. 3 billion.\nOf the $12. 2 billion committed assistance, about 54 per cent was project\naid, 24 per cent was commodity aid (other than food aid), 16 per cent\nfood aid and 6 per cent balance of payments support. Members of the\nPakistan Consortium contributed, on bilateral basis, 66 per cent of the\ntotal $12. 2 billion, multilateral agencies 15 per cent and other sources\n19 per cent. During 1976/77, Consortium group provided $724 million,\nOPEC $609 million and other sources $110 million. While the weighted\naverage interest of all committed foreign assistance during 1975/76 was\nonly 3. 7 per cent per annum, the estimated total external debt service\nis $339 million in 1976/77 which is 32.4 per cent higher than the $256\nmillion paid in 1975/76 and 75 per cent higher than the $193 million paid\nin 19 72/73. (See Appendix 3 for details of loans and credits received\nby Pakistan).\n13. Rescheduling of debt in May 1972, June 1973 and June 1974\nhas kept the debt service ratio at 17. 1 in 19 74/75 and 15. 1 in 19 75/76.\nThe ratio is, however, expected to rise to about 18 per cent for 1976/77\nand to 19 per cent or more after 1978, when the end of the debt relief\nperiod coincides with other repayments to OPEC countries and IMF.\n14. The extensive floods in August 1976 upset projections of\nthe draft Fifth Five Year Plan originally planned for implementation\nin 1976/77. A new Fifth Development P1ancovering a six-year period\n(1977/78-1982/83), was scheduled to start this year, but recent\ndisturbances have once again led to a postponement. The successful\nimplementation of the Plan depends on the achievement of domestic\nresources mobilization targets, the continuation of fairly substantial\nexternal assistance, favorable weather for agriculture, and the improved\nterms of trade.", "-5-\nB. Irrigation Sector\n15. Having an arid to semi-arid climate, Pakistan's\nagriculture has to depend largely on various irrigation schemes from\nsurface and groundwater resources. Thus, the country, has over the\nyears, developed a network of various irrigation facilities. The Indus\nWaters Treaty on the sharing of the waters of the Indus River and its\ntributaries was signed by India and Pakistan in September 1960. Together\nwith the Treaty, the Indus Basin Development Fund was established with\nthe assistance of IBRD and six governments!/to finance a program of\nworks, namely, the Indus Basin Project. The major works under the\nIndus Basin Project include construction of two large earth-filled\ndams at Mangla and Tarbela, eight inter-river link canals and several\nbarrages. In addition to the large external assistance received for\nthe Indus Basin Project, the development of irrigation water resources\nin Pakistan has been assisted so far by IDA, UNDP and USAID.\n16. The irrigation systems in Pakistan consist of about 38, 000\nmiles (60, 800 km.) of canals, a number of barrages and dams, and\nmore than 150, 000 tubewells. At present, a total of about 93 million\nacre feet of water is available at farm gates (63 million acre feet from\nsurface water and 30 million acre feet from groundwater sources). Out\nof a total cultivated area of 48 million acres (ZO million ha.), about 35\nmillion acres (14. 6 million ha.) or 73 per cent is irrigated through\ncanals and tubewells.\n17. Like overall agricultural activities, water resource\ndevelopment has so far been concentrated in the Provinces of Punjab\nand Sind, where 83 per cent and 5 1 per cent, respectively, of the\ntotal area cultivated are irrigated at present, compared with 40 per\ncent in NWFP and 41 per cent in the Province of Baluchistan. The\nrain-fed cultivated area is mainly in the northern parts of Punjab and\nNWFP. In these areas, the level of agricultural production is low,\nand only coarse grain and other crops can be cultivated. The area to\nbe covered by the Chashma Right Bank Irrigation Project falls largely\nin the rain-fed area; assured irrigation water supply is therefore crucial\nfor increased crop production.\nAustralia, Canada, Federal Republic of Germany, New Zealand,\njJ \nthe United Kin3om and the United States.", "6-\nIII. BANKOPERATIONSINPAKISTAN\n18. Bank operations in Pakistan started in 1968, when the\nBank made its first loan to the Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan.\nThe Bank has to date approved loans aggregating $460. 82 million for 18\nprojects, $327.97 million from ordinary capital resources and $132. 85\nmillion from Special Funds resources. In addition, technical assistance\nfor a total of $800, 000 has been approved for five projects. Three of\nthe technical assistance grants amounting to $500, 000 were for project\npreparation. As a result of the Bank's technical assistance, two\nprojects, the Gas Turbine Generation Project and the Hyderabad\nWater Supply and Sewerage Project have resulted in Bank loans.\n19. The largest portion (26.4 per cent in terms of loan amount)\nof Bank's financial assistance has been given to the power sector\naggregating about $122 million, followed by development banks (25. 3 per\ncent), industry (18 per cent), and a gas pipeline (11.5 per cent). The\nlargest portion of the Bank's total assistance has been directed toward\nthe development of energy resources, which is consistent with the\nGovernment's policy of rapid development of energy resources to meet\nincreasing domestic demand. Bank assistance to the agricultural sector\nincludes the Rice Milling and Fisheries Development Projects.\n20. The Bank has financed three projects in Pakistan jointly\nwith other multilateral and bilateral agencies. The foreign exchange\ncost of the Multan Fertilizer Project approved in December 1973 is\nbeing financed by the Bank ($27 million) and IBRD ($35 million). In\naddition, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company has participated in the equity\nof the company. Together with loans obtained from Saudi Arabian\nsources amounting to $80 million, the Bank extended a blend loan\ntotalling $50 million in December 1975 for the Mirpur Mathelo Fertilizer\nProject. In 1976, the Bank provided $48. 6 million for the Port Qasim\nProject, with a further $69. 8 million being provided by six bilateral\ndonors and co-lenders (Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, France, Federal\nRepublic of Germany and the United Kingdom).\n21. Appendix 2 indicates the current status of projects financed\nby the Bank in Pakistan. Bank projects approved in earlier years were\ndelayed by the events of 1971, but are now proceeding satisfactorily.\nThe projects approved thereafter, with the exception of the Mangla and\nTarbela Hydropower Projects and the Hyderabad Water Supply and\nSewerage Project, are generally on schedule. The Power Generation,\nTransmission and Distribution Project and the Sui -Karachi Gas Pipeline", "-7-\nProject faced cost overruns, the foreign exchange portion of which is\nbeing met by supplementary loans from the Bank. The Multan Ferti-\nlizer Project also has a cost overrun, part of which is being financed\nby increased equity participation from the Abu Dhabi National Oil\nCompany and a loan from the OPEC Special Funds. Financing for\nthe cost overrun for the Mangla Hydropower Project has recently been\narranged with two bilateral sources (Belgium and Japan). The\nGovernment of Pakistan is seeking financing from bilateral sources\nand the Bank for the cost overrun of the Tarbela Hydropower Project.\n22. In 1977, the Bank approved a loan of $30 million from\nordinary capital resources for the National Development Finance\nCorporation. A loan of $39. 5 million (including $4 million for local\ncost financing) for the Faisalabad Water Supply, Sewerage and Drainage\nProject and a supplementary loan of $38 million for the Tarbela Hydro-\npower Project (including extension) are under consideration, in addition\nto the proposed Chashma Right Bank Irrigation Project. The Banks\nlending program takes into account the priorities established by the\nGovernment and the assistance by other multilateral and bilateral\nagencies which are coordinated through the Pakistan Consortium.\nIV. THE PROJECT\n23. A report entitled ttAppraisal of the Chashma Right Bank\nIrrigation Project in Pakistan' s (Report No. PAK:Ap-22) is circulated\nherewith.\n24. One of the important surface water development programs\nunder consideration by the Government of Pakistan is the overall\nChashma Right Bank Irrigation Scheme, which is expected to provide\nperennial irrigation water for about 1.4 million acres (554, 000 ha.) by\none gravity and three separate lift irrigation works. The area is\nlocated in the relatively less -developed region of Dera Ismail Khan\nin NWFP and Dera Ghazi Khan in the Province of Punjab, on the\nright (west) bank of the Indus River. In view of the large scope and\ninvestment cost involved for this overall scheme and uncertainty in\nthe allocation of the required amount of water, the Government of\nPakistan has decided to phase implementation; the proposed Project,\ncovering an area of about 570, 000 acres (230, 000 ha.) under gravity\nirrigation, constitutes the first phase of the overall scheme.\nProject Scope and Costs\n25.\t The main objective of the proposed Project is to increase\nagricultural production in a food deficit area by more effective use of", "-8-\nwater available from the Indus River, thereby improving the incomes\nand general standard of living of farmers in the Project area. The\nProject consists of the following components:\n(i) irrigation and related civil works, including\nirrigation canal system, drainage, service roads\nand bridges;\n(ii) strengthening of the existing agricultural\nsupporting services;\n(iii) consulting services for monitoring Project\nprogress and agricultural development programs; and\n(iv) technical assistance for the preparation of\nfeasibility studies for agricultural proces sing\nfacilities in the Project area.\nIn addition, with a view to ensuring an integrated approach towards\nimprovement of the living standards of the rural population in the\nProject area, the Provincial Governments of NWFP and Punjab will\naccord high priority to their ongoing rural and socio -economic\nprograms, including rural health, water supply, electricity, education\nfacilities, road networks, and land reform programs.\n26.\t Irrigation and related civil works would include, as\nmajor components, construction of a 170-mile (274 km.) long main\ngravity irrigation canal and distributary canals with a total length\nof 375 miles (603 km.), and rehabilitation of the existing Paharpur\nCanal (70 miles or 112 km.) . The water for the proposed canal systems\nwill be drawn from the existing Chashma Barrage on the Indus River.\nThe existing head regulator, with a discharge capacity of 5, 000 cusecs,\nis located on the right flank of the Chashma Barrage to divert and\nregulate the Indus flows into the main gravity canal. A network of\ndistributaries from the main canal will be constructed for distribution\nof irrigation water to individual farm areas. The Government has\nassured that the necessary quantity of water for the Project, in the\namount of 5, 000 cusecs, will be made available through the head\nregulator, as required. The capacity of the existing Paharpur Canal\nand its distribution systems would be increased from 480 cusecs to\n890 cusecs to meet the projected irrigation water supply requirements\nunder the Project. The Provincial Government of NWFP will undertake\nthe remodelling of the Paharpur Canal.", "-9-\n27. To achieve the expected crop yields under the Project,\nconsiderable extension and research efforts are necessary prior to\nthe completion of construction. The Provincial Governments of\nNWFP and Punjab will initially strengthen their existing field\nresearch and demonstration stations located in the Project area\nby expanding their ongoing programs. To assist the Provincial\nGovernments concerned in carrying out such programs, the foreign\nexchange requirements will be met under the proposed loan for the\nprocurement of additional research facilities for the existing research\nstation, audio- visual equipment for training farmers, farm tractors\nfor the existing demonstration farms, and mobile facilities for the\nextension workers.\n28. In view of the nature of the Project involving mainly\nconstruction of canal works, for which WAPDA and its qualified\ntechnical personnel have had substantial experience, the Mission is\nof the opinion that consulting services for the preparation of design,\nevaluation of bids and construction supervision would not be needed.\nHowever, in order to ensure smooth implementation and coordination\nof the fairly large and dispersed construction works, about 110 man-\nmonths of consulting services are considered necessary to assist\nWAPDA in monitoring Project progress and in construction management.\nSince the Project involves the development of a large area, for which\na long gestation period is envisaged, the Mission considers that the\nprovision of consulting services will be necessary to assist the\nProvincial Governments of NWFP and Punjab in carrying out necessary\nstudies and making recommendations for possible shortening of the\nagricultural development period. The services will include about 30\nman -months of consultants' studies in the fields of agricultural extension,\nwater management, and agricultural institutions.\n29. The total investment cost of the Project is estimated at\n$104. 41 million, of which $27. 65 million or about 26 per cent would be\nthe foreign exchange cost as summarized below:\nEstimated Project Costs\n($'oOO)\nDescription\t Foreign\t Local\t - Total\n(i) Irrigation and Related Civil\nWorks 18, 364 47, 897 66, 261\n(ii) Strengthening of Agricultural\nSupporting Services 300 800 1, 100\n(iii) Consulting Services 630 150 780\n(iv) Technical Assistance 250 75 325\n(v) Administration and Transport\nFacilities 713 4, S92 5, 605\n(vi) Contingencies 7,393 22, 948 30, 341\nTOTAL 27, 650 76. 762 104, 412", "- 10 -\nPhysical contingencies of about 10 per cent and a contingency for\nexpected price escalation of about 28 per cent have been included in\nthe estimates.\nProposed Financing\n30. It is proposed that the Bank extend a loan of $31.5 million\nequivalent to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan to meet the foreign\nexchange cost ($27. 5 million)!/ and part of the local currency cost\n($4 million) of the Project. It is proposed that the loan be provided\nfrom the Special Funds resources of the Bank, with a service charge\nof 1 per cent per annum for a term of 40 years including a grace\nperiod of 10 years. The loan represents about 30 per cent of the total\ninvestment cost of the Project. The amount for local cost financing\nwould be utilized towards meeting costs of the construction of new\ncanals. The Government of Pakistan will make the proceeds of the\nBank loan available to WAPDA and the Provincial Governments of\nNWFP and Punjab in accordance with the Government'S budgetary\nallocations and annual development programs, to carry out their\nrespective components of the Project. The Government of Pakistan\nhas assured that it will make available, in addition to the proceeds\nof the Bank loan, all local currency funds required for timely\nimplementation of the Project. The European Economic Community\n(EEC) has indicated its willingness to consider financing a portion\nof the local currency cost of the Project.\n31. The proposed technical assistance would assist the\nGovernment of Pakistan and the Provincial Governments of NWFP\nand Punjab in he preparation of feasibility studies for agricultural\nprocessing facilities, such as sugar and flour mills, cotton ginning\nfactories, oil extraction and other agro-industries. In order to make\na detailed assessment for the agro -industrial requirements in the Project\nand considering that the necessary expertise is limited in some areas\nwithin the country, the Mission considers that the proposed technical\nassistance is necessary and justified. The proposed technical assistance\nwould provide 28 man-months of consulting services in the fields of\nregional planning, marketing, agricultural economy, and agro-\nindustrial engineering.\n32. The total cost of the services is estimated at $325, 000,\nincluding a foreign exchange cost of $250, 000. In view of the project-\npreparatory nature of the technical assistance, including the provision\nof training opportunities for the counterpart personnel, it is proposed\nthat the Bank extend a grant of up to $150, 000 towards the cost of this\n1/ Excluding proposed technical assistance grant of $150, 000\n(see para. 32).", "- 11 -\ntechnical assistance, while the remaining foreign exchange cost of\n$100, 000 would be included in the proposed loan. The local currency\ncost of the technical assistance, estimated at $75, 000, will be met\nby the concerned Provincial Governments.\nProlect Implementation\n33. The Ministry of Water and Power will be responsible for\noverall supervision and coordination for implementation of the Project\nthrough establishment of a Project Supervision and Coordinating\nCommittee, which will be chaired by the Secretary of the Ministry of\nWater and Power and consist of representatives of the Ministry of\nAgriculture, WAPDA and the Provincial Governments of NWFP and\nPunjab. WAPDA will be the Executing Agency for the irrigation and\nrelated civil works component of the Project. The Provincial Govern-\nments of NWFP and Punjab will be responsible for strengthening of the\nexisting agricultural supporting services and studies for agricultural\ndevelopment programs. The technical assistance study will be under-\ntaken by the Provincial Government of NWFP, in close coordination\nwith the Provincial Government of Punjab.\n34. WAPDA is an autonomous statutory body established in\n1958 to undertake the unified and coordinated development of the water\nand power resources in Pakistan, and has since acquired considerable\nexperience by implementing a number of irrigation projects. WAPDA\nwill establish a Project Office and appoint a full-time Project Director\nin consultation with the Bank as a condition of loan effectiveness. The\nProvincial Governments of NWFP and Punjab will each establish a\nProject Coordination Committee, to coordinate the activities of the\nvarious provincial government departments and agencies concerned with\nProject implementation.\n35. It would take about five years to complete the civil works\ncomponent of the Project. The remodelling works for the Paharpur\nCanal would be completed in about three years. For about 40 miles\n(64 km.) of the gravity main canal in the head reach, the construction\nwill be carried out by machines, and the remaining works for the main\ncanal construction, including the distributaries, will be undertaken\nmainly by labor-intensive methods with animal power, a practice which\nhas been commonly employed with satisfactory results for similar works\nin Pakistan. Considering that the civil works of the Project are scattered\nand simple and of the type in which local contractors have considerable\nexperience, the Government of Pakistan and WAPDA proposed that", "- 12 -\ninternational competitive bidding be not required for civil works.\nThe Mission's general review of the capability and experience of\nmajor contractors in the country indicates that local contractors\nare capable of undertaking the canal construction works, provided\nthat the necessary construction equipment will be procured and made\navailable to them under the proposed loan. It is proposed that civil\nwork contracts for canal construction would be awarded on the basis\nof competitive bidding among pre -qualified local contractors in\naccordance with WAPDA's procurement procedures. Selection and\nengagement of such contractors will, however, be subject to the\nconcurrence of the Bank.\n36. WAPDA will be responsible for the procurement of\nall construction equipment and materials and transport facilities\nrequired for the construction of irrigation and related civil works,\nfollowing which such equipment and materials will be supplied to the\nsuccessful civil work contractors. Procurement of laboratory equip-\nment and other facilities necessary for the strengthening of the existing\nagricultural supporting services will be undertaken by the Provincial\nGovernment of NWFP, in coordination with the Provincial Government\nof Punjab. Construction equipment and transport facilities estimated\nto cost the equivalent of $100, 000 or more will be procured on the basis\nof international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's\nGuidelines for Procurement. Contracts for other equipment and\nfacilities estimated to cost the equivalent of $100, 000 or less will\nbe awarded on the basis of international shopping. Procurement of\nconstruction materials, such as cement, steel bars and gates, bitumen,\nfuels and oils, which are manufactured locally from imported components\nand raw materials, will be awarded by WAPDA and NWFP on the basis\nof competitive bidding among local suppliers under their standard\nprocurement procedure. Based on the import element of the materials,\nup to 40 per cent of the contract price of procurement of such materials\nwill be financed under the proposed loan as indirect foreign exchange\ncosts.\n37. Consultants required for canal construction, agricultural\ndevelopment programs and technical assistance will be engaged in\naccordance with the Bank's guidelines on Uses of Consultants. WAPDA\nwill engage the consultants to assist it in monitoring Project progress\nand in construction management, and the required experts are expected\nto be recruited on an individual basis. The Provincial Government of\nNWFP, in coordination with the Provincial Government of Punjab, will\nengage the consultants required to assist them in (1) the carrying out of", "- 13 -\nnecessary studies for possible shortening of the agricultural develop-\nment period; and (ii) the preparation of feasibility studies for\nagricultural proces sing facilities.\n38. One year after completion of the Project to allow for a\nperiod of commissioning, WAPDA will turn over the Project facilities\nto the Provincial Governments of NWFP and Punjab for their operation\nand maintenance. The Provincial Governments will make available\nsufficient resources, including personnel, equipment and funds in\norder to ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the Project\nfacilities. In accordance with the Government's policy, water charges\nwill be levied on the beneficiary farmers in the Project area. Both\nthe Federal and Provincial Governments concerned have agreed to\nundertake reviews of the existing water charges in the Project area\nwith a view to establishing proper allocations and levels for future\nwater charges in order to recover the full operation and maintenance\ncosts and a reasonable portion of the investment costs fromthe bene -\nficiary farmers. Such reviews will be completed at least two years\nbefore Project completion (i. e. , by 31 December 1980) and submitted\nto the Bank for review and comments.\n39. Assurances have been obtained fromthe Government of\nPakistan that separate Project accounts will be maintained by WAPDA\nand the Provincial Governments of NWFP and Punjab. The Project\nDirector will be responsible for preparing and maintaining the consolid-\nated Project accounts. Such accounts will be audited annually by\nauditors acceptable to the Bank. Copies of the audit report, as well\nas certified copies of the financial statements, will be submitted to\nthe Bank not later than six months after the close of the fiscal year to\nwhich they relate.\nJustific atioris\n40. Agricultural conditions in the Project area are characterized\nby low productivity and a consequent low standard of living among the\nfarmers. The main constraints are insufficient rainlall and inadequate\nirrigation water as well as insufficient supporting services. About 82\nper cent of the Project area is presently under dry farming where crop\nproduction is dependent on rains. The low precipitation and its seasonal\nand yearly variations have resulted in precarious farm operations; crop\nfailures are common and cropping intensity varies from year to year,\naveraging about 26 per cent. Provision of perennial water supplies and\nintroduction of improved farming practices are essential for increased\nagricultural production in the Project area.", "- 14 -\n41. The Project has been formulated as an integrated\nagricultural development undertaking with the major objective of\nincreasing agricultural production and improving living conditions\nin the Project area. Higher yields of crops and an increase in the\ncropped area from the present 185, 000 acres to 855, 000 acres\nwould result in incremental crop production of about 560, 000 tons\nof various food crops, thus generating net incremental benefits valued\nat about $82 million equivalent at full development of the Project. The\nProject is expected to yield an economic internal rate of return of\n19 per cent, which is considered satisfactory. About 23, 000 farm\nfamilies, of which about 77 per cent are small farmers holding less\nthan 25 acres (10. 4 ha.) of land, would benefit from the Project. The\nProject would create employment opportunities for about 11 million\nman-days during its five-year construction period and 29 million man-\ndays of farm labor annually thereafter.\n42. Investment in the Project is justifiable both in terms of\nnet value added to the national economy as well as the financial gains\nto the farm families and other socio -economic benefits. The proposed\nProject is technically feasible, economically viable and socially\ndesirable. The Project is accorded high priority by both the Federal\nand the concerned Provincial Governments in their respective develop-\nment plans, and merits the Bkik's financial assistance. The proposed\ntechnical assistance will help the Government of Pakistan and the\nProvincial Governments of NWFP and Punjab in the preparating of\nfeasibility studies for agricultural processing facilities in the Project\na rea.\nV. PROPOSED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE\n43. The main features of the proposed loan are as follows:\nBorrower\t Islamic Republic of Pakistan\nExecuting Agencies\t : North-West Frontier Province\n(NWFP), the Province of Punjab,\nand Water and Power Develop-\nment Authority (WAPDA).\nLoan Amount\t : The equivalent in various\ncurrencies of $31.5 million\nfrom Special Funds resources\nof the Bank.", "- 15 -\nPurpose\t To finance the foreign exchange\ncost ($27. 5 million) and part\n($4 million) of the local currency\ncost of the Chashma Rig Bank\nIrrigation Project.\nPeriod of Utilization\t Until 31 December 1984.\nAmortization\t 40 years including a grace period\nof 10 years. Principal and service\ncharge to be payable semi-annually.\nService Charge\t 1 per cent per annum.\n44. Pakistan has a relatively low per capita GNP, estimated\nat $170 in 1976 and substantial debt service obligations. The current\naccount of the balance of payments has been in deficit over the years;\nit is estimated to have reached a deficit of $470 million for 197 6/77,\ndue to increased payments for goods and services and unfavorable\nterms of trade. Economic growth has been slow particularly after\noil crisis, and the country is listed by the United Nations as one of the\ncountries \"most seriously affected\" by developments in the world\neconomy in recent years. Domestic resource mobilization still remains\none of Pakistan's most difficult problems in order to finance increased\ndevelopment and non-development needs of the country. Deficits in the\nbalance of payments and the national budget are being met from external\nresources. On these grounds, Bank assistance on concessional terms\nto the country is justified, and Pakistan is eligible for concessional loar\nfrom the Special Funds resources under the Bank's criteria./ it is\nconsidered appropriate that the proposed loan be made from the Bank's\nSpecial Funds resources considering social orientation of the Project.\n45. In order to help meet the substantial local currency cost,\nthe Government has requested that an amount of $4 million equivalent\nfor local cost financing be included in the proposed Bank loan. The\nMission supports this proposal on the grounds that Pakistan meets the\ncountry consideration criteria for local currency cost financing and that\ni/ \"A Review of Criteria for Lending from the Asian Development\nFund\" (R83-77, Revision 1, Final) dated 14 September 1977.", "- 16 -\nthis Project is particularly appropriate for such financing by the Bank\nas specified in \"Lending Foreign Exchange for Local Currency\nExpenditures on Projects\" (R65 -74, Revision 1, Final, dated 16 July\n1974). The proposed amount of $4 million is within the ceiling of\nlocal currency expenditure financing i.e. , 10 per cent of the Bank's\nannual lending from Special Funds resources.\n46. The Project would benefit about 23. 000 farm families in\nthe Project area, by making water available for the agricultural\nproduction and thus raising the general standard of living of the rural\npopulation The Project will have high economic and social benefits,\nthrough the development of labor intensive irrigation, but will have a\nrelatively long gestation period for full development. In view of its\nhigh local cost component, Bank financing for a part of the local currency\ncost will help the Gvernment in meeting the entire local cost due to the\nlimited government financing available for the Project. The proposed\nlocal cost financing would account for 5. 2 per cent of the local currency\ncost of the Project, and the proposed Bank loan would finance about\n30 per cent of the total cost of the Project.\n47. The main features of the proposed technical assistance\ngrant are as follows:\nRecipient Government of the Islamic\nRepublic of Pakistan\nExecuting Agency Government of the North-West\nFrontier Province (NWFP), in\ncoordination with the Government\nof the Province of Punjab.\nTechnical Assistance\nAmount The equivalent in various currencies\nof not exceeding $50, 000 of which\n$150, 000 is proposed to be provided\nas a grant, and the balance of\n$100, 000 financed under the proposed\nloan.\nPurpose\t : To assist the Government of Pakistai\nand the concerned Provincial Govern\nments in the preparation of feasibili\nstudies for agricultural proces sing\nfacilities in the Project area.\n_______", "- 17 -\nVI.

The loan would have a term\nof 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years, with a service charge\nof 1 per cent per annum.\nI. INTRODUCTION\n2. The Government of Pakistan has requested the Bank to\nfinance the foreign exchange cost and part of the local currency cost\nof the Chashma Right Bank Irrigation Project, and for technical\nassistance to assist the Government of Pakistan and the concerned\nProvincial Governments in the preparation of feasibility studies for\nagricultural processing facilities in the Project area. The Project\nis located on the right (west) bank of the Indus River spanning the\nNorth-West Frontier Province (NWFP) and the Province of Punjab,\nand represents the first phase of the overall Chashma Right Bank\nIrrigation Scheme. The Government of Pakistan and the Provincial\nGovernments have accorded high priority to the agricultural development\nof the area.\n3. A feasibility study for the Project was prepared by the Water\nand Power Development Authority (WAPDA) in 1970, and this report\nwas updated in 1973. The Bank sent Fact-Finding Missions to Pakistan\nin October 1976 and June 1977 to discuss the technical aspects of the\nProject with the concerned government agencies. A Bank Appraisal\nMission visited the country from 1 to 23 August 1977. Formal loan\nnegotiations were held in Manila from 9 to 16 November 1977 with\nduly authorized representatives of the Government of the Islamic\nRepublic of Pakistan, the Provincial Governments of NWFP and Punjab,\nand WAPDA. If approved, the proposed Project would be the nd.neteenth\nBank loan project in Pakistan and the first Bank-assisted irrigation\nproject in that country.", "-2-\nII. THE ECONOMY\n4. An Economic Report on Pakistan (Report No. PAK:Ec-5)\nwas circulated to the Board in March 1977. This chapter summarizes\nthe current situation and prospects. The Basic Data are given in\nAppendix 1.\nA. Recent Developments\n5. Widespread floods in August 1976 and political difficulties\nin the later part of the fiscal year 1976/77 caused major setbacks in\nthe achievements of targets both in agriculture and industry. The\nestimated growth rate of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for 1976/77\nwas 0. 5 per cent, compared with 3. 8 per cent in 1975/76. With the\npopulation growing at the rate of 3 per cent per annum, the per capita\nGNP, estimated in 1976 at $170, !/ has declined in real terms in 1977.\n6. The agricultural sector accounts for about 35 per cent of\nGDP, 80 per cent of foreign exchange earnings, and about 55 per cent\nof the total labor force. Agricultural production in 1976/77 was\naffected by the floods and registered an increase of only 1. 0 per\ncent. Most of the increase was due to a record 8. 9 million tons of\nwheat production, a gain of 3. 6 per cent over the previous year.\nHowever, the overall agricultural index showed little increase\nbecause floods devastated the cotton crop reducing output from a\nprojected 4 million bales to 2. 4 million bales.\n7. Domestic production of wheat has been inadequate to meet\nthe nation's requirements; more. than 6 millon tons of wheat was\nimported over the period 1970/71-1976/77, although approximately\n650, 000 tons of rice are exported each year. Average yields of crops\nare low due to traditional cultural practices and short supply of\nagricultural inputs. The country's agricultural development policy\ncalls for increased production of important food and cash crops through\nprovision of agricultural inputs, improvements of irrigation and other\nfacilities, and strengthening of agricultural research and extension\nj/ Preliminary estimate, World Bank.", "-3-\nservices. Agriculture is accorded high priority in the forthcoming\nFifth Development Plan, expected to start in 1978, to achieve\nself-sufficiency in wheat and increased exports of cotton and rice.\n8. The output of the manufacturing sector, which contributes\nabout 15 per cent of GDP, has stagnated. Production continues to\nbe seriously affected by shortages of electric power and domestic\nagricultural raw materials. With disruptions resulting from the\nrecent disturbances, large -scale manufacturing production is estimated\nto have declined by 2 per cent in 1976/77.\n9. The money supply is estimated to have increased by about\n21 per cent for the first three quarters of 19 76/77, a rate marginally\nlower than in 1975/76. Credit to the private sector also expanded\nrapidly. The rate of inflation which reached a peak at 30 per cent in\n197 3/74 declined to 12 per cent in 19 75/76 and to 9 per cent in\n1976/77.\n10. Pakistan's merchandise trade showed a deficit of $1. 1 billion\nin 1974/75 and $1 billion in 1975/76. For 1976/77, the trade deficit is\nestimated to have reached $630 million, largely on account of reduced\nexports of cotton and cotton goods and lower prices for rice exports on\nthe one hand, and higher import prices for oil and tea, on the other.\nThese deficits were fin9.nced mainly by assistance from the Pakistan\nConsortium members,\" OPEC countries and the IMF. On the receipts\nside of the balance of payments, an encouraging factor has been the\nsharp increase in remittances from Pakistanis overseas; from $93\nmillion in 197 1/72 to an estimated $596 million in 1976/77, and current\nexpectations are that such remittances will reach $900 million by 1980.\n11. Domestic resource mobilization, though slightly improved,\nremains one of Pakistan's most serious problems. Deficit financing\nincreased from Rs. 3.9 billion in 1975/76 to Rs. 5. 6 billion in 1976/77.\nExternal resources financed about Rs. 8. 92 billion or 52 per cent of the\n1976/77 Annual Development Plan (ADP) amounting to Rs. 17 billion.\nTax collection has improved and attempts have been made to control\nnon-development expenditures. However, while the subsidies bill has\ni/ In addition to IBRD, IFC and the Bank, the Pakistan Consortium\nincludes Belgium, Canada, France, Federal Republic of Germany, Italy,\nJapan, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, U. K. and U.S.A.", "-4-\nbeen substantially reduced from Rs. 2, 819 million in 1974/75 to\nRs. 593. 8 million in 1976/77, expenditure on defence has continued to\ngrow. In the 1977/78 Budget, non-development expenditures are\nexpected to be about 25 per cent higher than in 19 76/77 with defence\nexpenditures claiming about 45 per cent of the total. New revenue and\ntax measures are expected to increase collection by 15 per cent adding\nRs. 3. 03 billion to existing resource mobilization of Rs. 19. 68 billion.\nAllocation for agriculture in the ADP has increased whereas the share\nof industry has decreased.\n12. As of June 1976, commitments of foreign economic\nassistance to Pakistan which began in 1950, totalled $12.2 billion,\nwith $3. 04 billion being grant and $9. 11 billion being loan assistance\nand credits. Cumulative disbursements of loans totalled $8. 3 billion.\nOf the $12. 2 billion committed assistance, about 54 per cent was project\naid, 24 per cent was commodity aid (other than food aid), 16 per cent\nfood aid and 6 per cent balance of payments support. Members of the\nPakistan Consortium contributed, on bilateral basis, 66 per cent of the\ntotal $12. 2 billion, multilateral agencies 15 per cent and other sources\n19 per cent. During 1976/77, Consortium group provided $724 million,\nOPEC $609 million and other sources $110 million. While the weighted\naverage interest of all committed foreign assistance during 1975/76 was\nonly 3. 7 per cent per annum, the estimated total external debt service\nis $339 million in 1976/77 which is 32.4 per cent higher than the $256\nmillion paid in 1975/76 and 75 per cent higher than the $193 million paid\nin 19 72/73. (See Appendix 3 for details of loans and credits received\nby Pakistan).\n13. Rescheduling of debt in May 1972, June 1973 and June 1974\nhas kept the debt service ratio at 17. 1 in 19 74/75 and 15. 1 in 19 75/76.\nThe ratio is, however, expected to rise to about 18 per cent for 1976/77\nand to 19 per cent or more after 1978, when the end of the debt relief\nperiod coincides with other repayments to OPEC countries and IMF.\n14. The extensive floods in August 1976 upset projections of\nthe draft Fifth Five Year Plan originally planned for implementation\nin 1976/77. A new Fifth Development P1ancovering a six-year period\n(1977/78-1982/83), was scheduled to start this year, but recent\ndisturbances have once again led to a postponement. The successful\nimplementation of the Plan depends on the achievement of domestic\nresources mobilization targets, the continuation of fairly substantial\nexternal assistance, favorable weather for agriculture, and the improved\nterms of trade.", "-5-\nB. Irrigation Sector\n15. Having an arid to semi-arid climate, Pakistan's\nagriculture has to depend largely on various irrigation schemes from\nsurface and groundwater resources. Thus, the country, has over the\nyears, developed a network of various irrigation facilities. The Indus\nWaters Treaty on the sharing of the waters of the Indus River and its\ntributaries was signed by India and Pakistan in September 1960. Together\nwith the Treaty, the Indus Basin Development Fund was established with\nthe assistance of IBRD and six governments!/to finance a program of\nworks, namely, the Indus Basin Project. The major works under the\nIndus Basin Project include construction of two large earth-filled\ndams at Mangla and Tarbela, eight inter-river link canals and several\nbarrages. In addition to the large external assistance received for\nthe Indus Basin Project, the development of irrigation water resources\nin Pakistan has been assisted so far by IDA, UNDP and USAID.\n16. The irrigation systems in Pakistan consist of about 38, 000\nmiles (60, 800 km.) of canals, a number of barrages and dams, and\nmore than 150, 000 tubewells. At present, a total of about 93 million\nacre feet of water is available at farm gates (63 million acre feet from\nsurface water and 30 million acre feet from groundwater sources). Out\nof a total cultivated area of 48 million acres (ZO million ha.), about 35\nmillion acres (14. 6 million ha.) or 73 per cent is irrigated through\ncanals and tubewells.\n17. Like overall agricultural activities, water resource\ndevelopment has so far been concentrated in the Provinces of Punjab\nand Sind, where 83 per cent and 5 1 per cent, respectively, of the\ntotal area cultivated are irrigated at present, compared with 40 per\ncent in NWFP and 41 per cent in the Province of Baluchistan. The\nrain-fed cultivated area is mainly in the northern parts of Punjab and\nNWFP. In these areas, the level of agricultural production is low,\nand only coarse grain and other crops can be cultivated. The area to\nbe covered by the Chashma Right Bank Irrigation Project falls largely\nin the rain-fed area; assured irrigation water supply is therefore crucial\nfor increased crop production.\nAustralia, Canada, Federal Republic of Germany, New Zealand,\njJ \nthe United Kin3om and the United States.", "6-\nIII. BANKOPERATIONSINPAKISTAN\n18. Bank operations in Pakistan started in 1968, when the\nBank made its first loan to the Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan.\nThe Bank has to date approved loans aggregating $460. 82 million for 18\nprojects, $327.97 million from ordinary capital resources and $132. 85\nmillion from Special Funds resources. In addition, technical assistance\nfor a total of $800, 000 has been approved for five projects. Three of\nthe technical assistance grants amounting to $500, 000 were for project\npreparation. As a result of the Bank's technical assistance, two\nprojects, the Gas Turbine Generation Project and the Hyderabad\nWater Supply and Sewerage Project have resulted in Bank loans.\n19. The largest portion (26.4 per cent in terms of loan amount)\nof Bank's financial assistance has been given to the power sector\naggregating about $122 million, followed by development banks (25. 3 per\ncent), industry (18 per cent), and a gas pipeline (11.5 per cent). The\nlargest portion of the Bank's total assistance has been directed toward\nthe development of energy resources, which is consistent with the\nGovernment's policy of rapid development of energy resources to meet\nincreasing domestic demand. Bank assistance to the agricultural sector\nincludes the Rice Milling and Fisheries Development Projects.\n20. The Bank has financed three projects in Pakistan jointly\nwith other multilateral and bilateral agencies. The foreign exchange\ncost of the Multan Fertilizer Project approved in December 1973 is\nbeing financed by the Bank ($27 million) and IBRD ($35 million). In\naddition, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company has participated in the equity\nof the company. Together with loans obtained from Saudi Arabian\nsources amounting to $80 million, the Bank extended a blend loan\ntotalling $50 million in December 1975 for the Mirpur Mathelo Fertilizer\nProject. In 1976, the Bank provided $48. 6 million for the Port Qasim\nProject, with a further $69. 8 million being provided by six bilateral\ndonors and co-lenders (Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, France, Federal\nRepublic of Germany and the United Kingdom).\n21. Appendix 2 indicates the current status of projects financed\nby the Bank in Pakistan. Bank projects approved in earlier years were\ndelayed by the events of 1971, but are now proceeding satisfactorily.\nThe projects approved thereafter, with the exception of the Mangla and\nTarbela Hydropower Projects and the Hyderabad Water Supply and\nSewerage Project, are generally on schedule. The Power Generation,\nTransmission and Distribution Project and the Sui -Karachi Gas Pipeline", "-7-\nProject faced cost overruns, the foreign exchange portion of which is\nbeing met by supplementary loans from the Bank. The Multan Ferti-\nlizer Project also has a cost overrun, part of which is being financed\nby increased equity participation from the Abu Dhabi National Oil\nCompany and a loan from the OPEC Special Funds. Financing for\nthe cost overrun for the Mangla Hydropower Project has recently been\narranged with two bilateral sources (Belgium and Japan). The\nGovernment of Pakistan is seeking financing from bilateral sources\nand the Bank for the cost overrun of the Tarbela Hydropower Project.\n22. In 1977, the Bank approved a loan of $30 million from\nordinary capital resources for the National Development Finance\nCorporation. A loan of $39. 5 million (including $4 million for local\ncost financing) for the Faisalabad Water Supply, Sewerage and Drainage\nProject and a supplementary loan of $38 million for the Tarbela Hydro-\npower Project (including extension) are under consideration, in addition\nto the proposed Chashma Right Bank Irrigation Project. The Banks\nlending program takes into account the priorities established by the\nGovernment and the assistance by other multilateral and bilateral\nagencies which are coordinated through the Pakistan Consortium.\nIV. THE PROJECT\n23. A report entitled ttAppraisal of the Chashma Right Bank\nIrrigation Project in Pakistan' s (Report No. PAK:Ap-22) is circulated\nherewith.\n24. One of the important surface water development programs\nunder consideration by the Government of Pakistan is the overall\nChashma Right Bank Irrigation Scheme, which is expected to provide\nperennial irrigation water for about 1.4 million acres (554, 000 ha.) by\none gravity and three separate lift irrigation works. The area is\nlocated in the relatively less -developed region of Dera Ismail Khan\nin NWFP and Dera Ghazi Khan in the Province of Punjab, on the\nright (west) bank of the Indus River. In view of the large scope and\ninvestment cost involved for this overall scheme and uncertainty in\nthe allocation of the required amount of water, the Government of\nPakistan has decided to phase implementation; the proposed Project,\ncovering an area of about 570, 000 acres (230, 000 ha.) under gravity\nirrigation, constitutes the first phase of the overall scheme.\nProject Scope and Costs\n25.\t The main objective of the proposed Project is to increase\nagricultural production in a food deficit area by more effective use of", "-8-\nwater available from the Indus River, thereby improving the incomes\nand general standard of living of farmers in the Project area. The\nProject consists of the following components:\n(i) irrigation and related civil works, including\nirrigation canal system, drainage, service roads\nand bridges;\n(ii) strengthening of the existing agricultural\nsupporting services;\n(iii) consulting services for monitoring Project\nprogress and agricultural development programs; and\n(iv) technical assistance for the preparation of\nfeasibility studies for agricultural proces sing\nfacilities in the Project area.\nIn addition, with a view to ensuring an integrated approach towards\nimprovement of the living standards of the rural population in the\nProject area, the Provincial Governments of NWFP and Punjab will\naccord high priority to their ongoing rural and socio -economic\nprograms, including rural health, water supply, electricity, education\nfacilities, road networks, and land reform programs.\n26.\t Irrigation and related civil works would include, as\nmajor components, construction of a 170-mile (274 km.) long main\ngravity irrigation canal and distributary canals with a total length\nof 375 miles (603 km.), and rehabilitation of the existing Paharpur\nCanal (70 miles or 112 km.) . The water for the proposed canal systems\nwill be drawn from the existing Chashma Barrage on the Indus River.\nThe existing head regulator, with a discharge capacity of 5, 000 cusecs,\nis located on the right flank of the Chashma Barrage to divert and\nregulate the Indus flows into the main gravity canal. A network of\ndistributaries from the main canal will be constructed for distribution\nof irrigation water to individual farm areas. The Government has\nassured that the necessary quantity of water for the Project, in the\namount of 5, 000 cusecs, will be made available through the head\nregulator, as required. The capacity of the existing Paharpur Canal\nand its distribution systems would be increased from 480 cusecs to\n890 cusecs to meet the projected irrigation water supply requirements\nunder the Project. The Provincial Government of NWFP will undertake\nthe remodelling of the Paharpur Canal.", "-9-\n27. To achieve the expected crop yields under the Project,\nconsiderable extension and research efforts are necessary prior to\nthe completion of construction. The Provincial Governments of\nNWFP and Punjab will initially strengthen their existing field\nresearch and demonstration stations located in the Project area\nby expanding their ongoing programs. To assist the Provincial\nGovernments concerned in carrying out such programs, the foreign\nexchange requirements will be met under the proposed loan for the\nprocurement of additional research facilities for the existing research\nstation, audio- visual equipment for training farmers, farm tractors\nfor the existing demonstration farms, and mobile facilities for the\nextension workers.\n28. In view of the nature of the Project involving mainly\nconstruction of canal works, for which WAPDA and its qualified\ntechnical personnel have had substantial experience, the Mission is\nof the opinion that consulting services for the preparation of design,\nevaluation of bids and construction supervision would not be needed.\nHowever, in order to ensure smooth implementation and coordination\nof the fairly large and dispersed construction works, about 110 man-\nmonths of consulting services are considered necessary to assist\nWAPDA in monitoring Project progress and in construction management.\nSince the Project involves the development of a large area, for which\na long gestation period is envisaged, the Mission considers that the\nprovision of consulting services will be necessary to assist the\nProvincial Governments of NWFP and Punjab in carrying out necessary\nstudies and making recommendations for possible shortening of the\nagricultural development period. The services will include about 30\nman -months of consultants' studies in the fields of agricultural extension,\nwater management, and agricultural institutions.\n29. The total investment cost of the Project is estimated at\n$104. 41 million, of which $27. 65 million or about 26 per cent would be\nthe foreign exchange cost as summarized below:\nEstimated Project Costs\n($'oOO)\nDescription\t Foreign\t Local\t - Total\n(i) Irrigation and Related Civil\nWorks 18, 364 47, 897 66, 261\n(ii) Strengthening of Agricultural\nSupporting Services 300 800 1, 100\n(iii) Consulting Services 630 150 780\n(iv) Technical Assistance 250 75 325\n(v) Administration and Transport\nFacilities 713 4, S92 5, 605\n(vi) Contingencies 7,393 22, 948 30, 341\nTOTAL 27, 650 76. 762 104, 412", "- 10 -\nPhysical contingencies of about 10 per cent and a contingency for\nexpected price escalation of about 28 per cent have been included in\nthe estimates.\nProposed Financing\n30. It is proposed that the Bank extend a loan of $31.5 million\nequivalent to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan to meet the foreign\nexchange cost ($27. 5 million)!/ and part of the local currency cost\n($4 million) of the Project. It is proposed that the loan be provided\nfrom the Special Funds resources of the Bank, with a service charge\nof 1 per cent per annum for a term of 40 years including a grace\nperiod of 10 years. The loan represents about 30 per cent of the total\ninvestment cost of the Project. The amount for local cost financing\nwould be utilized towards meeting costs of the construction of new\ncanals. The Government of Pakistan will make the proceeds of the\nBank loan available to WAPDA and the Provincial Governments of\nNWFP and Punjab in accordance with the Government'S budgetary\nallocations and annual development programs, to carry out their\nrespective components of the Project. The Government of Pakistan\nhas assured that it will make available, in addition to the proceeds\nof the Bank loan, all local currency funds required for timely\nimplementation of the Project. The European Economic Community\n(EEC) has indicated its willingness to consider financing a portion\nof the local currency cost of the Project.\n31. The proposed technical assistance would assist the\nGovernment of Pakistan and the Provincial Governments of NWFP\nand Punjab in he preparation of feasibility studies for agricultural\nprocessing facilities, such as sugar and flour mills, cotton ginning\nfactories, oil extraction and other agro-industries. In order to make\na detailed assessment for the agro -industrial requirements in the Project\nand considering that the necessary expertise is limited in some areas\nwithin the country, the Mission considers that the proposed technical\nassistance is necessary and justified. The proposed technical assistance\nwould provide 28 man-months of consulting services in the fields of\nregional planning, marketing, agricultural economy, and agro-\nindustrial engineering.\n32. The total cost of the services is estimated at $325, 000,\nincluding a foreign exchange cost of $250, 000. In view of the project-\npreparatory nature of the technical assistance, including the provision\nof training opportunities for the counterpart personnel, it is proposed\nthat the Bank extend a grant of up to $150, 000 towards the cost of this\n1/ Excluding proposed technical assistance grant of $150, 000\n(see para. 32).", "- 11 -\ntechnical assistance, while the remaining foreign exchange cost of\n$100, 000 would be included in the proposed loan. The local currency\ncost of the technical assistance, estimated at $75, 000, will be met\nby the concerned Provincial Governments.\nProlect Implementation\n33. The Ministry of Water and Power will be responsible for\noverall supervision and coordination for implementation of the Project\nthrough establishment of a Project Supervision and Coordinating\nCommittee, which will be chaired by the Secretary of the Ministry of\nWater and Power and consist of representatives of the Ministry of\nAgriculture, WAPDA and the Provincial Governments of NWFP and\nPunjab. WAPDA will be the Executing Agency for the irrigation and\nrelated civil works component of the Project. The Provincial Govern-\nments of NWFP and Punjab will be responsible for strengthening of the\nexisting agricultural supporting services and studies for agricultural\ndevelopment programs. The technical assistance study will be under-\ntaken by the Provincial Government of NWFP, in close coordination\nwith the Provincial Government of Punjab.\n34. WAPDA is an autonomous statutory body established in\n1958 to undertake the unified and coordinated development of the water\nand power resources in Pakistan, and has since acquired considerable\nexperience by implementing a number of irrigation projects. WAPDA\nwill establish a Project Office and appoint a full-time Project Director\nin consultation with the Bank as a condition of loan effectiveness. The\nProvincial Governments of NWFP and Punjab will each establish a\nProject Coordination Committee, to coordinate the activities of the\nvarious provincial government departments and agencies concerned with\nProject implementation.\n35. It would take about five years to complete the civil works\ncomponent of the Project. The remodelling works for the Paharpur\nCanal would be completed in about three years. For about 40 miles\n(64 km.) of the gravity main canal in the head reach, the construction\nwill be carried out by machines, and the remaining works for the main\ncanal construction, including the distributaries, will be undertaken\nmainly by labor-intensive methods with animal power, a practice which\nhas been commonly employed with satisfactory results for similar works\nin Pakistan. Considering that the civil works of the Project are scattered\nand simple and of the type in which local contractors have considerable\nexperience, the Government of Pakistan and WAPDA proposed that", "- 12 -\ninternational competitive bidding be not required for civil works.\nThe Mission's general review of the capability and experience of\nmajor contractors in the country indicates that local contractors\nare capable of undertaking the canal construction works, provided\nthat the necessary construction equipment will be procured and made\navailable to them under the proposed loan. It is proposed that civil\nwork contracts for canal construction would be awarded on the basis\nof competitive bidding among pre -qualified local contractors in\naccordance with WAPDA's procurement procedures. Selection and\nengagement of such contractors will, however, be subject to the\nconcurrence of the Bank.\n36. WAPDA will be responsible for the procurement of\nall construction equipment and materials and transport facilities\nrequired for the construction of irrigation and related civil works,\nfollowing which such equipment and materials will be supplied to the\nsuccessful civil work contractors. Procurement of laboratory equip-\nment and other facilities necessary for the strengthening of the existing\nagricultural supporting services will be undertaken by the Provincial\nGovernment of NWFP, in coordination with the Provincial Government\nof Punjab. Construction equipment and transport facilities estimated\nto cost the equivalent of $100, 000 or more will be procured on the basis\nof international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's\nGuidelines for Procurement. Contracts for other equipment and\nfacilities estimated to cost the equivalent of $100, 000 or less will\nbe awarded on the basis of international shopping. Procurement of\nconstruction materials, such as cement, steel bars and gates, bitumen,\nfuels and oils, which are manufactured locally from imported components\nand raw materials, will be awarded by WAPDA and NWFP on the basis\nof competitive bidding among local suppliers under their standard\nprocurement procedure. Based on the import element of the materials,\nup to 40 per cent of the contract price of procurement of such materials\nwill be financed under the proposed loan as indirect foreign exchange\ncosts.\n37. Consultants required for canal construction, agricultural\ndevelopment programs and technical assistance will be engaged in\naccordance with the Bank's guidelines on Uses of Consultants. WAPDA\nwill engage the consultants to assist it in monitoring Project progress\nand in construction management, and the required experts are expected\nto be recruited on an individual basis. The Provincial Government of\nNWFP, in coordination with the Provincial Government of Punjab, will\nengage the consultants required to assist them in (1) the carrying out of", "- 13 -\nnecessary studies for possible shortening of the agricultural develop-\nment period; and (ii) the preparation of feasibility studies for\nagricultural proces sing facilities.\n38. One year after completion of the Project to allow for a\nperiod of commissioning, WAPDA will turn over the Project facilities\nto the Provincial Governments of NWFP and Punjab for their operation\nand maintenance. The Provincial Governments will make available\nsufficient resources, including personnel, equipment and funds in\norder to ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the Project\nfacilities. In accordance with the Government's policy, water charges\nwill be levied on the beneficiary farmers in the Project area. Both\nthe Federal and Provincial Governments concerned have agreed to\nundertake reviews of the existing water charges in the Project area\nwith a view to establishing proper allocations and levels for future\nwater charges in order to recover the full operation and maintenance\ncosts and a reasonable portion of the investment costs fromthe bene -\nficiary farmers. Such reviews will be completed at least two years\nbefore Project completion (i. e. , by 31 December 1980) and submitted\nto the Bank for review and comments.\n39. Assurances have been obtained fromthe Government of\nPakistan that separate Project accounts will be maintained by WAPDA\nand the Provincial Governments of NWFP and Punjab. The Project\nDirector will be responsible for preparing and maintaining the consolid-\nated Project accounts. Such accounts will be audited annually by\nauditors acceptable to the Bank. Copies of the audit report, as well\nas certified copies of the financial statements, will be submitted to\nthe Bank not later than six months after the close of the fiscal year to\nwhich they relate.\nJustific atioris\n40. Agricultural conditions in the Project area are characterized\nby low productivity and a consequent low standard of living among the\nfarmers. The main constraints are insufficient rainlall and inadequate\nirrigation water as well as insufficient supporting services. About 82\nper cent of the Project area is presently under dry farming where crop\nproduction is dependent on rains. The low precipitation and its seasonal\nand yearly variations have resulted in precarious farm operations; crop\nfailures are common and cropping intensity varies from year to year,\naveraging about 26 per cent. Provision of perennial water supplies and\nintroduction of improved farming practices are essential for increased\nagricultural production in the Project area.", "- 14 -\n41. The Project has been formulated as an integrated\nagricultural development undertaking with the major objective of\nincreasing agricultural production and improving living conditions\nin the Project area. Higher yields of crops and an increase in the\ncropped area from the present 185, 000 acres to 855, 000 acres\nwould result in incremental crop production of about 560, 000 tons\nof various food crops, thus generating net incremental benefits valued\nat about $82 million equivalent at full development of the Project. The\nProject is expected to yield an economic internal rate of return of\n19 per cent, which is considered satisfactory. About 23, 000 farm\nfamilies, of which about 77 per cent are small farmers holding less\nthan 25 acres (10. 4 ha.) of land, would benefit from the Project. The\nProject would create employment opportunities for about 11 million\nman-days during its five-year construction period and 29 million man-\ndays of farm labor annually thereafter.\n42. Investment in the Project is justifiable both in terms of\nnet value added to the national economy as well as the financial gains\nto the farm families and other socio -economic benefits. The proposed\nProject is technically feasible, economically viable and socially\ndesirable. The Project is accorded high priority by both the Federal\nand the concerned Provincial Governments in their respective develop-\nment plans, and merits the Bkik's financial assistance. The proposed\ntechnical assistance will help the Government of Pakistan and the\nProvincial Governments of NWFP and Punjab in the preparating of\nfeasibility studies for agricultural processing facilities in the Project\na rea.\nV. PROPOSED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE\n43. The main features of the proposed loan are as follows:\nBorrower\t Islamic Republic of Pakistan\nExecuting Agencies\t : North-West Frontier Province\n(NWFP), the Province of Punjab,\nand Water and Power Develop-\nment Authority (WAPDA).\nLoan Amount\t : The equivalent in various\ncurrencies of $31.5 million\nfrom Special Funds resources\nof the Bank.", "- 15 -\nPurpose\t To finance the foreign exchange\ncost ($27. 5 million) and part\n($4 million) of the local currency\ncost of the Chashma Rig Bank\nIrrigation Project.\nPeriod of Utilization\t Until 31 December 1984.\nAmortization\t 40 years including a grace period\nof 10 years. Principal and service\ncharge to be payable semi-annually.\nService Charge\t 1 per cent per annum.\n44. Pakistan has a relatively low per capita GNP, estimated\nat $170 in 1976 and substantial debt service obligations. The current\naccount of the balance of payments has been in deficit over the years;\nit is estimated to have reached a deficit of $470 million for 197 6/77,\ndue to increased payments for goods and services and unfavorable\nterms of trade. Economic growth has been slow particularly after\noil crisis, and the country is listed by the United Nations as one of the\ncountries \"most seriously affected\" by developments in the world\neconomy in recent years. Domestic resource mobilization still remains\none of Pakistan's most difficult problems in order to finance increased\ndevelopment and non-development needs of the country. Deficits in the\nbalance of payments and the national budget are being met from external\nresources. On these grounds, Bank assistance on concessional terms\nto the country is justified, and Pakistan is eligible for concessional loar\nfrom the Special Funds resources under the Bank's criteria./ it is\nconsidered appropriate that the proposed loan be made from the Bank's\nSpecial Funds resources considering social orientation of the Project.\n45. In order to help meet the substantial local currency cost,\nthe Government has requested that an amount of $4 million equivalent\nfor local cost financing be included in the proposed Bank loan. The\nMission supports this proposal on the grounds that Pakistan meets the\ncountry consideration criteria for local currency cost financing and that\ni/ \"A Review of Criteria for Lending from the Asian Development\nFund\" (R83-77, Revision 1, Final) dated 14 September 1977.", "- 16 -\nthis Project is particularly appropriate for such financing by the Bank\nas specified in \"Lending Foreign Exchange for Local Currency\nExpenditures on Projects\" (R65 -74, Revision 1, Final, dated 16 July\n1974). The proposed amount of $4 million is within the ceiling of\nlocal currency expenditure financing i.e. , 10 per cent of the Bank's\nannual lending from Special Funds resources.\n46. The Project would benefit about 23. 000 farm families in\nthe Project area, by making water available for the agricultural\nproduction and thus raising the general standard of living of the rural\npopulation The Project will have high economic and social benefits,\nthrough the development of labor intensive irrigation, but will have a\nrelatively long gestation period for full development. In view of its\nhigh local cost component, Bank financing for a part of the local currency\ncost will help the Gvernment in meeting the entire local cost due to the\nlimited government financing available for the Project. The proposed\nlocal cost financing would account for 5. 2 per cent of the local currency\ncost of the Project, and the proposed Bank loan would finance about\n30 per cent of the total cost of the Project.\n47. The main features of the proposed technical assistance\ngrant are as follows:\nRecipient Government of the Islamic\nRepublic of Pakistan\nExecuting Agency Government of the North-West\nFrontier Province (NWFP), in\ncoordination with the Government\nof the Province of Punjab.\nTechnical Assistance\nAmount The equivalent in various currencies\nof not exceeding $50, 000 of which\n$150, 000 is proposed to be provided\nas a grant, and the balance of\n$100, 000 financed under the proposed\nloan.\nPurpose\t : To assist the Government of Pakistai\nand the concerned Provincial Govern\nments in the preparation of feasibili\nstudies for agricultural proces sing\nfacilities in the Project area.\n_______", "- 17 -\nVI.
