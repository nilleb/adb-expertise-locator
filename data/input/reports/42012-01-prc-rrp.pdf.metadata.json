The project will provide new \nand  improved  rural  roads  and  potable  water  supply  systems  to  eight  poverty-stricken  districts \nand  counties  of  the  Chongqing  municipality,  enhancing  economic,  public  health,  and \nenvironmental conditions for about 377,000 people. The project includes three components: (i) \nconstruction or rehabilitation of about 362 kilometers (km) of roads through 21 road subprojects; \n(ii)  construction  and  improvement  of  nine  water  supply  facilities  which  consist  of  new  water \ntreatment plants and pipelines to boost service coverage, quality and reliability and cumulatively \nprovide  about  72,500  cubic  meters  (m3)  per  day  of  water;  and  (iii)  project  implementation \nsupport  and  targeted  capacity  building  for  the  project\u2019s  implementing  entities  in  district  and \ncounty-level governments to ensure the effective implementation  and sustainable operation and \nmaintenance of the project facilities.1  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nChongqing\u2019s  urban\u2013rural  reform  agenda  is  a  priority  of  the  State  Council.  The  agenda \n3. \ncalls  for  stimulating  reforms  in  the  less-developed  western  PRC,  formulating  an  equitable \nurban\u2013rural  reform  model  for  national  replication,  and  providing  for  an  ecologically  safer \nenvironment.  This  urban\u2013rural  transformation  is  vital  to  allow  Chongqing  to  become  an \nimportant  growth  pole  in  western  PRC,  an  economic  center  of  balanced  urban\u2013rural \ndevelopment  in  the  upper  reaches  of  the  Yangtze  River,  and  the  first  city  in  western  PRC  to \nbuild  a  xiaokang  (a  moderately  prosperous  society  in  all  respects).  Embracing  this  challenge, \nthe  CMG  is  prioritizing  the  equitable  and  balanced  development  and  urbanization  of  its  two \nprimary rural areas: the Three Gorges Reservoir catchment area northeast of its urban hub, and \na poverty-stricken, ethnic minority area to the southeast. At the same time, the CMG recognizes \nthe  need  for  basic  urban\u2013rural  infrastructure,  together  with  sustainable  ecological  and \nenvironmental  protection.  Many  of  Chongqing\u2019s  rural  districts  and  counties  suffer  from \ninadequate  infrastructure  due  partly  to  their  remoteness,  difficult  terrain,  and  either  a  lack  of \nwater sources or an inability to harness them. Only 75% of Chongqing\u2019s villages are accessible \nby  rural  roads;  and  many  existing  roads  are  in  poor  condition,  restricting  all-weather  access. \nThe  Sichuan  earthquake  in  May  2008  underscored  the  vital  need  to  improve  emergency  road \naccess  during  natural  calamities.  Chongqing\u2019s  rural  areas  also  suffer  from  acute  water \nshortages  and  poor  water  access.  In  2008,  more  than  8  million  rural  residents  had  limited \naccess  to  safe,  sustainable,  potable  water  supplies,  resulting  in  an  increase  in  waterborne \ndiseases. The inadequacy of basic infrastructure, particularly water supply and roads, severely \nconstrains  rural  economic  growth  in  Chongqing.  It  also  threatens  human  health,  compromises \nthe environment, and hampers urban\u2013rural development. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.  ADB.  2008.  Technical \nAssistance  to  the  People's  Republic  of  China  for  Preparing  the  Chongqing  Urban\u2013Rural  Infrastructure \nDevelopment Demonstration Project. Manila (TA 7108-PRC).  \n\n\f2 \n\nThe  project  responds  directly  to  these  urban\u2013rural  and  infrastructure  challenges  by \n4. \nproviding  essential  road  and  water  supply  infrastructure  to  selected  undeveloped  rural  areas. \nThis  will  strengthen  Chongqing\u2019s  urban\u2013rural \nlinks,  support  balanced  and  equitable \ndevelopment,  and  promote  environmental  protection  and  climate  proofing.  It  is  an  innovative \ndemonstration  model  that  can  be  replicated  nationally.  The  project  prioritizes  the  poorer  rural \nareas  northeast  and  southeast  of  Chongqing.  These  areas  suffer  from  low  per  capita  gross \ndomestic  product  and  poor  or  nonexistent  infrastructure.  These  communities  urgently  need \nwater  supply  and  rural roads,  which  are  intricately  linked. The  project will  demonstrate  how  to \naddress  water  scarcity  and  water  management  while  ensuring  that  selected  areas  are \naccessible  by  road.2 By  providing  urban\u2013rural  infrastructure,  the  project  supports  the  CMG\u2019s \nefforts to improve living standards in outlying areas by targeting counties with high incidences of \npoverty and large minority populations. It is consistent with the urban\u2013rural development goals \nof  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan,  which  promotes  equitable  urbanization,  balanced  regional  growth, \nand coordinated urban\u2013rural development. The project supports the State Council\u2019s recognition \nof  Chongqing  as  the  first  provincial  pilot  area  for  integrated  and  equitable  urban\u2013rural \ndevelopment. It is also in line with the strategic priorities of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \nIt  supports  ADB\u2019s  Water  Policy 3 as  well  as  ADB\u2019s  objective  of  making  markets  work  more \nefficiently by providing infrastructure and promoting environmental sustainability. By enhancing \nurban\u2013rural  development,  the  project  is  consistent  with  Strategy  20204 and  the  PRC  country \npartnership  strategy,  2008\u20132010 5  since \ninfrastructure,  strengthens \nenvironmental  management  and  protection,  and  enhances  inclusive  growth  and  balanced \ndevelopment.  The  project  also  improves  the  provision  of  municipal  infrastructure  service, \nsupports urban\u2013rural integration, and enhances rural town investment potential while protecting \nthe  environment.  In  all,  the  project  contributes  substantially  to  the  government\u2019s  overarching \ngoal of promoting an equitable and balanced regional development and urbanization. \n \n5. \n \n\nThe project will demonstrate the following:  \n\nit  delivers  efficient \n\n(i) \n\nStronger  water  sector  enterprises.  The  project  will  strengthen  water \nenterprises  and  promote  the  integration  of  urban\u2013rural  water  supply  systems.  It \nwill  upgrade  the  skills  of  operations  staff,  improves  rural  system  operational \nperformance and viability, and reduces operating losses. \n\n(ii)  Web-based  project  management  and  coordination  mechanism.  The \nmechanism  initiated  by  the  Chongqing  project  management  office  (PMO)  will \nfacilitate  information  exchange  and  networking  of  the  executing  agency, \nimplementing agencies and units, ADB, and districts and/or counties. \n\n(iii)  Watershed  management  and  water  quality  monitoring.  The  project  will \nsupport  watershed  management  and  water  quality  monitoring  to  strengthen \nenvironmental awareness and protection of watershed areas. It will also support \nparallel  CMG  environmental  protection  initiatives,  which  include  a  community \nhotline initiative in Fuling District to improve local pollution control compliance. \n\n                                                 \n2   Urbanization  Policy  and  Models  (Appendix  2)  presents  the  urbanization  model  of  Chongqing  and  replicability  in \nsimilar  regions  in  the  PRC.  Adopting  this  would  provide  more  balanced  urban\u2013rural  integration  and  sustainable \neconomic growth.  \n\n3   ADB. 2003. Water for All: The Water Policy of the Asian Development Bank.

The  project  will  support  tariff  reforms  by \n(a) making services affordable to the poor through tariffs that are reasonably set \naccording  to  local  conditions,  (b)  strengthening  tariff-setting  mechanisms, \n(c) increasing rural tariffs gradually to recover costs, and (d) gradual introduction \nof wastewater tariffs.  \nUrban\u2013rural  road  management,  safety,  and  maintenance. The project\u2019s road \ncomponents will closely integrate with the CMG\u2019s parallel improvement initiatives \nrelating to road traffic and pedestrian safety; increased public transport services; \nand improvements in maintenance systems, tunnel management, and axle load \ninspections. \nClimate-proofed designs. The project\u2019s road and water supply components and \nassociated  facilities,  such  as  those  for  drainage,  erosion  control,  and  slope \nprotection,  will  support  climate  change  adaptation  and  disaster  mitigation \nmeasures.  Better  road  connectivity  between  villages  and  towns  will  provide \nalternative all-weather routes during natural calamities.  \nEnvironmental  awareness  and  sanitation  education.  A  pilot  demonstration \nactivity  grant  of  $50,0006 will  be  provided  to  a  women\u2019s  federation7 to  support \nand expand a health and hygiene program for the benefit of women and children \nin  four  villages  of  Yunyang  and  Youyang  counties,  including  four  schools  with \n2,300 students.  \n\n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n6. \nThe project\u2019s impacts will be an improved urban\u2013rural environment and enhanced public \nhealth  and  quality  of  life  for  residents  of  affected  poor  districts  and  counties.  The  project's \noutcome  will  be  better  urban\u2013rural  roads  and  water  supply  infrastructure  in  the  eight  districts \nand  counties.  Impacts  and  outcomes  of  the  improved  road  networks  will  include  (i) improved \nurban\u2013rural  links  and  paved  road  access  in  rural  areas;  (ii) better  community  connectivity  and \naccessibility, and inter-township and county transport integration, through enhanced all-weather \naccess to economic and social facilities and farm-to-market access; (iii) safer and more efficient \ntravel safety, and improved emergency transit during natural calamities. Impacts and outcomes \nfrom  the  improved  water  supply  systems  will  include  (i) wider  water  supply  coverage  in  rural \ncommunities;  (ii)  improved  water  quantity  and  quality,  and  corresponding  improvements  in \npublic  health;  (iii)  higher  productivity  through  a  reduction  in  waterborne  illnesses;  and  (iv) \nopportunities to develop food processing and other economic activities, which were previously \nunsustainable  because  of  the  lack  of  potable  piped  water  and  road  connectivity.  Appendix  1 \npresents the design and monitoring framework. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe project will have three outputs: (i) 21 road subcomponents consisting of about 362 \n7. \nkm  of  new  or  rehabilitated  rural  roads  serving  31  towns  in  eight  of  Chongqing\u2019s  poor  districts \n(Fuling  and  Qianjiang)  and  counties  (Chengkou,  Fengjie,  Wushan,  Xiushan,  Youyang,  and \nYunyang); (ii) nine water supply subcomponents comprising new water treatment facilities and \npipelines cumulatively delivering 72,500 m3 per day of water to 10 towns in five poor counties \n(Youyang,  Yunyang,  Fengjie,  Wushan,  and  Chengkou);  and  (iii)  project  management  and \ninstitutional capacity building of involved agencies to promote the effective implementation and \n                                                 \n6  Financed  under  ADB.  2008.

Residents in the eight poor districts and counties will benefit through \nbetter  water  quality  and  quantity,  improved  health,  reduced  waterborne  diseases,  a  cleaner \nenvironment,  improved  road  connectivity  and  reliability,  and  enhanced  disaster  management. \nThe project will create jobs and stimulate economic growth within some of Chongqing\u2019s poorest \nand most disadvantaged urban and  rural areas. In the water sector, the project will strengthen \nwater  supply  institutions,  support  water  tariff  reforms,  and  provide  the  basis  to  gradually \nintroduce  wastewater  tariffs,  while  providing  watershed  management  and  water  quality \n\n                                                 \n14  The consulting package will be provided through a firm using quality- and cost-based selection in accordance with \n\nthe Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n\n15  Provided through individual consultant system. \n16  Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n17  The  roads  component  will  benefit  184,000  people,  while  the  water  supply  component  will  benefit  209,000.  Since \n\nthere are 16,000 common beneficiaries, the project will benefit a total of 377,000 people. \n\n\fmonitoring support to strengthen environmental awareness and protection.18 The project\u2019s new \nand improved roads will provide better all-weather connectivity between villages and towns, and \nimprove  emergency  access  during  natural  calamities.  The  project  is  a  valuable  urban\u2013rural \ninfrastructure demonstration project that can be replicated nationally. \n \nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n13. \nThe  project\u2019s  road  and  water  supply  components  will  be  designed  to  accommodate \nseismic events. Mitigation measures will be designed into cut and fill slopes, transmission and \ndistribution  pipelines,  building  foundations  and  structures,  road  pavements,  and  other \ninfrastructure.  Geologic  and  geotechnical  analysis  during  detailed  design  will  also  ensure  that \npipeline  and  road  alignments  follow  routes  of least  seismic  risk,  an  important  factor  as  project \nroads  will  serve  as  vital  escape  and  emergency-response  corridors  during  natural  calamities, \nsuch  as  the  2008  Sichuan  earthquake.  Other  safety  design  considerations  are  also  to  be \nincorporated  into  road  components,  including  enhanced  traffic  markings  and  signage, \npedestrian  lanes,  bus  stops,  protection  barriers,  and  improved  safety  education  and  traffic \nsafety  management.  The  project\u2019s  local  road  design  improvements  will  be  promoted  and \nreplicated by other districts and counties. The majority of the water supply systems are gravity \nfed,  with  low  O&M  costs.  The  project\u2019s  road  and  water  supply  components  with  drainage, \nerosion  control,  and  slope  protection,  will  also  support  climate  change  adaptation.  A  detailed \ndescription of components is in the project administration manual.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nThe  economic  analysis19 indicates  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  15.7%\u201319.5% \n14. \nfor  the  roads  subcomponents  and  17.3%\u201319.7%  for  the  water  supply  subcomponents.  This  is \nwell  above  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of  12%.  Economic  costs  include (i) capital \ncosts,  such  as  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and  environmental  mitigation  and  monitoring \ncosts;  (ii)  project  management  and  institutional  strengthening  costs;  (iii)  physical  contingencies; \nand (iv) O&M costs. Economic benefits for rural roads include (i) savings in vehicle operating costs, \n(ii) time savings, (iii) accident avoidance costs, (iv) generated traffic benefits, and (v) income gains \ncreated by year-round road access. Water supply benefits include (i) resource cost savings (user \ncost  savings  and  user  time  savings),  and  (ii)  beneficiaries'  willingness  to  pay  for  improved  and \nexpanded  water services.  Benefits that  are not readily quantifiable, such  as better  health, higher \nemployment, and climate adaptation, have not been included.20  \n \nThe financial internal rates of return and net present value have been computed for the \n15. \nwater supply subcomponents (revenue-generating) at November 2009 price levels. They range \nfrom  3.4%  to  6.9%,  which  exceed  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  at  3.3%.  Water  and \nwastewater tariffs account for 1.7%\u20132.0% of the average household income and 1.6%\u20132.2% of \nthe  poor  households\u2019  income\u2014considered  acceptable  given  the  improved  service  compared \nwith  the  current  unreliable  water  supply  situation.  The  districts  and  counties  must  be  able  to \nrationalize  the  need  to  improve  fee  collection  in  relation  to  improved  services.  The  gradual \nincrease in tariffs will allow for (i) cost recovery of O&M costs, (ii) payment of debt service, and \n(iii) the establishment of a reserve fund to meet planned equipment replacement every 5 years. \nThe  project  will  demonstrate  that  sustainability  and  cost  recovery  are  ensured  for  town-level \nwater supply subcomponents that are properly planned using least-cost options, gravity-fed, and \n                                                 \n18  All  districts  and  counties  are  committed  to  constructing  wastewater  treatment  facilities  and  collection  networks  in \n\n2010\u20132014. \n\n19  Performed for the project\u2019s 21 road subcomponents and nine water supply subcomponents. \n20  Economic Analysis; Health Impact Analysis (Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nadequately  funded,  managed,  and  operated  efficiently.21 For  the  nonrevenue-generating  road \ncomponents,  the  funding  sources  for  counterpart  funds,  O&M  costs,  and  debt  service  were \nreviewed  and  the  counterpart  funds  will  be  provided  during  project  implementation  in  a  timely \nmanner. The financial management capacity of all proposed implementing agencies and units is \nadequate for the implementation of the project, and training in ADB procedures will be required \nin procurement, disbursement, project management, and accounting systems.  \n\n \nGovernance \n\nC. \n\n16. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the CMG, PMOs, implementing agencies, and their project implementing units. The specific \npolicy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  project  administration \nmanual.22  \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\nThe project will reduce poverty by ensuring that targeted poor communities have access \n17. \nto  safe  and  reliable  water  supplies  and  upgraded  and  expanded  road  networks.  This  will \nincrementally  improve  the  living  conditions  of  residents  and  migrants  by  providing  better  and \nsafer access to jobs and social services. The project\u2019s components will stimulate investment in \nthe industry and the services sectors. Up to 80% of construction jobs created by the project may \nbe  classified  as  unskilled,  and  many  are  likely  to  be  filled  by  the  unemployed.  Since \nunemployment  is  a  primary  cause  of  poverty  in  the  project  area,  the  poor  will  benefit \ndisproportionately from the jobs it creates. About CNY44.7 million in employment benefits will be \ngenerated;  and  women,  ethnic  minorities,  and  poor  people  will  be  prioritized  for  jobs  during \nconstruction.  The  project  will  reduce  the  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases,  cutting  medical \ncosts by up to CNY10 million per year during 2014\u20132033. The poverty and social assessment \nindicates  that  women  strongly  support  and  anticipate  benefits  from  both  the  road  and  water \nsupply components. Gender has been mainstreamed into the project design, which includes a \nrange  of  gender-sensitive  measures  such  as  requirements  for  consultation,  training,  and \nmonitoring  indicators.  The  implementing  agencies  will  work  with  women\u2019s  federations, \ncontractors, and communities to facilitate the participation of women in paid work opportunities \nfor  physical  works,  and  to  ensure  that  all  PRC  labor  laws  and  core  labor  standards  are \nrespected.  The  Tujia  ethnic  minorities  living  in  subcomponent  areas  are  culturally  assimilated \nwith  the  Han  majority.  The  project  will  ensure  their  participation  through  the  dissemination  of \ninformation.  Livelihood  restoration  measures  associated  with  resettlement  are  incorporated  in \nthe  resettlement  plan  and  project  design. 23 The  pilot  demonstration  activity  grant  under  the \nWater  Financing  Partnership  Facility  will  strengthen  community-based  environmental \nawareness  through  a  water  and  sanitation  public  education  campaign  on  health,  tariffs,  and \nhygiene in Yunyang and Youyang counties. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n18. \nThe project is classified as environment category A. The summary environmental impact \nassessment  (EIA)  has  been  circulated  to  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  and  posted  on  the  ADB \nwebsite.  The  summary  EIA  concludes  that  the  project  has  substantial  environmental  and \nsocioeconomic benefits, and that its potential environmental impacts can be mitigated through \n                                                 \n21  Financial analysis; Financial Management Assessment (Appendix 2). \n22 Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n23  Gender Action Plan; Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy, Poverty and Social Assessment and Social \n\nAction Plan; Indigenous Peoples Assessment and Measures (Appendix 2). \n\n\fthe  implementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan.  The  completed  EIAs,  based  on \nextensive  public  consultations,  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  and  requirements  including  ADB's \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003).  The  methods  and  standards  applied  in  the \npreparation of EIAs for the project subcomponents are in accordance with the guidelines of the \nMinistry  of  Environmental  Protection  (formerly  State  Environmental  Protection  Administration), \nand  also  meet  national  and  municipal  laws  and  regulations.24 Although adverse  environmental \nimpacts  are  anticipated  during  the  construction  and  operation  of  the  project,  mitigation \nmeasures  and  the  environmental  management  plan  are  expected  to  mitigate  these  potential \nimpacts.  The  designs  of  the  road  and  water  supply  subcomponents  also  address  a  range  of \nclimate change issues. They do not significantly contribute to greenhouse gases or increase the \nregion\u2019s vulnerability to climate change effects, and they promote the integration of adaptation \nmeasures  into  roads  and  water  supply  infrastructure  development  at  the  county  level.  Local \nenvironmental  protection  bureaus  will  support  the  implementing  agencies  in  undertaking  the \nenvironmental  management  plans.  Capacity  building  in  environmental  management  will  be \nprovided for the executing agency, implementing agencies, implementing units, and district and \ncounty  environmental  protection  bureaus.  The  implementing  agencies  have  disclosed  relevant \nenvironment  information  to  the  affected  people  through  consultations  during  2008\u20132009,  and \nthe results and findings were used to modify the EIAs and the project design. \n \n19. \nConstruction  of  the  project\u2019s  subcomponents  will  necessitate  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  which  have  been  addressed  in  the  preparation  of  subproject  resettlement  plans. \nThe  project  will  acquire  about  163.64  hectares  (ha)  of  land,  of  which  85.37 ha  is  classified  as \ncultivated  land.  In  addition,  46.30  ha  of  land,  one-third  of  which  is  farmland,  will  be  occupied \ntemporarily. Land acquisition will affect 4,238 households (17,456 persons). The project will also \nrequire  the  demolition  of  37,059.20  square  meters  (m2)  of  residential  houses,  affecting  341 \nhouseholds  (1,387  persons).  In  total,  4,952  households  (20,561  persons)  will  be  affected  in \neight  districts  and  counties.  Farmers  affected  by  land  loss  will  be  compensated  or  mitigated \nbased on local regulations. Compensation for standing crops, auxiliaries, and other assets will \nalso be paid directly to the affected persons. Based on PRC regulations, about 1,539 affected \npersons will be given the opportunity to become urban residents. People losing housing in rural \nareas  will  receive  cash  compensation  at  replacement  costs,  or  cash  compensation  for  the \nstructure  plus  house  plots.  Economic  rehabilitation  measures  include  (i)  jobs  during  the \nconstruction  and  operation  of  the  project;  (ii)  high-value  crop  production;  (iii)  promotion  and \ndevelopment  of  new  enterprises  and  self-employed  secondary  and  tertiary  businesses;  (iv) \ntechnical  training  to  the  affected  persons  to  increase  their  skills;  and  (v)  special  support  to \nvulnerable  groups.  The  cost  estimate  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  for  the  30 \nsubcomponents is equivalent to CNY149.8 million in 2009 prices, including contingencies.25  \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n20.
