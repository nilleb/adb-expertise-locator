The facility will identify and prepare high-priority projects for potential funding by the \ngovernment and/or by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) or other development partners in the \ncountry.  This  preparation  will  include  feasibility  studies,  safeguard  due  diligence,  detail \nengineering design, bidding documents, and procurement assistance for advance contracting (if \nappropriate). This will contribute significantly to (i) improving the implementation performance of \nthe ensuing projects by reducing the period between project concept and loan approval and the \ncommencement of improvement works, (ii) helping to achieve the intended outcomes efficiently, \nand  (iii)  realizing  the  projects\u2019  impacts  and  benefits  in  a  timely  manner.  The  facility  will  also \nprovide capacity development support to help establish an enabling environment, supporting the \ngovernment\u2019s goal of developing transport infrastructure under public\u2013private partnership (PPP). \nThe  facility  will  prepare  transport  projects  that  will  contribute  to  improving  connectivity  and \naccessibility  throughout  the  country.  The  facility  is  also  relevant  to  ADB\u2019s  sector  strategy  in \nsupport  of  the  government\u2019s  goal  of  achieving  regionally  balanced  economic  growth  and \nreduced social inequalities. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nNepal is a landlocked Himalayan country bordered to the north by the People\u2019s Republic \nof China, and to the south, east, and west by India. The country is commonly divided into three \nphysiographic areas with dramatic differences in elevation: the mountains in the north, the hills \nin  the  middle,  and  the  Terai  (southern  lowland  plains)  bordering  India.  Because  of  its \nmountainous terrain and difficult weather conditions, roads and aviation are the major modes of \ntransportation in the country. \n \n4. \nNepal\u2019s road network is about 18,500 km long, comprising the 7,500 km strategic road \nnetwork  (SRN)  of  national  and  feeder  roads  connecting  district  headquarters,  and  the  11,000 \nkm local and rural roads network. The total road network density is comparatively low, at about \n14 km per 100 square kilometer and 0.71 km/1,000 people.1 Due to mountainous terrain in the \nnorth,  more  than  60%  of  the  road  network  is  concentrated  in  the  Terai.  In  the  remote  hill  and \nmountainous districts, the poor condition and low density of roads hampers the delivery of social \nservices and access to shops, markets, schools, and hospitals.  \n \n5. \nCivil  aviation  in  Nepal  plays  a  vital  role  in  linking  the  remote  areas  in  hilly  and \nmountainous parts of the country that are otherwise inaccessible by road, and is crucial to the \ngrowth of trade and tourism in the country. Nepal has 47 airports, comprising one international \nairport  (Tribhuvan  International  Airport  [TIA]  in  Kathmandu),  four  regional  airports  (Bhairawa, \nBiratnagar,  Nepalgunj,  and  Pokhara),  and  42  small  domestic  airports  and  short  take-off  and \nlanding  strips.  The  volume  of  air  traffic  in  terms  of  air  passengers  has  increased considerably \n(1990\u20142010), with growth rates varying from 7% to more than 17% per annum.  \n\n                                                 \n1   By comparison, regional figures in terms of km/1,000 people are Bhutan 6.5, Sri Lanka 4.7, India 3.0, Bangladesh \n\n1.9, and Pakistan 1.7. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nThe importance of the transport sector has been recognized and highlighted in several \n6. \nkey  national  plans  and  strategies,  including  the  government\u2019s  Three  Year  Interim  Plan \n(FY2007/08\u2013FY2009/10).2 It  emphasizes  the  role  of  the  road  and  air  transport  subsectors  in \nimproving  accessibility,  which  is  one  of  the  defining  development  issues  in  the  country\u2014be  it \naccess to opportunity, enterprise, markets, or services. Poor rural access and high external and \ndomestic  transport  costs  are  major  obstacles  to  achieving  one  of  the  government\u2019s  major \ndevelopment goals\u2014broad-based economic growth. \n \nFor the road subsector, the Department of Roads (DOR) under the Ministry of Physical \n7. \nPlanning and Works (MPPW) is in the process of implementing the 10-year Priority Investment \nPlan  (PIP)  2007\u20132016.3 The  PIP  was  prepared  in  2007  with  the  World  Bank\u2019s  assistance  and \npresents  a  detailed  strategy  for  the  development  of  the  SRN  and  recommends  a  list  of \ninterventions  in  the  form  of  rehabilitation,  upgrading,  and  new  construction.  The  interventions \nare  prioritized  in  terms  of  network  connectivity,  improved  accessibility  (including  remote  area \naccess),  and  network  strengthening.  These,  collectively,  provide  connectivity  throughout  the \ncountry  by  providing  interregional  connections  and  links  to  district  headquarters,  international \nborders, and key economic centers. The SRN is also an enabler of local and district access by \nallowing  development  of  local  road  networks  within  each  individual  district  and  facilitating  the \nprovision  of  access  to  remote  communities.  The  government,  through  the  development  of  the \nSRN,  aims  to  enhance  national  levels  of  social  and  economic  integration,  redress  regional \ninequalities  and  imbalances,  and  reduce  levels  of  exclusion  in  the  remote  and  more \ndisadvantaged  areas.  ADB\u2019s  current  strategy \nthe \ngovernment\u2019s  effort  to  improve  and  expand  the  SRN  in  line  with  the  PIP,  including  the \nrehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  about  300  km  under  the  ongoing  Road  Connectivity  Sector  1 \nProject.4 The  PIP  is  targeted  to  improve,  upgrade,  and/or  add  about  4,500  km  of  roads  and \nexpand  the  total  SRN  to  about  9,700  km  by  2016.  This  is  expected  to  raise  accessibility,  in \nterms of the percentage of the population that is within a 4-hour (or less) walk of paved roads in \nhill areas and a 2-hour (or less) walk in Terai areas, from 65% in 2007 to 85% by 2016. \n \n8. \nFor the air transport sector, the government has recognized the urgent need to improve \nsafety  and  capacity  in view  of  the  rising  traffic,  which  is  forecasted  to double  by  2019.5 At  the \ncountry's  only  international  airport  (TIA),  airside  facilities,  runways,  taxiways,  aprons,  and \ncommunication  navigation  surveillance  equipment  are  not  fully  compliant  with  international \nsafety standards and recommended practices. The international terminal building is nearing its \npassenger  handling  capacity  and  the  domestic  terminal  building  is  operating  beyond  its \ncapacity.  Of  the  42  domestic  airports,  only  27  are  operational.  Most  of  the  short  take-off  and \nlanding  strips  in  remote  areas  are  unpaved,  have  no  terminal  facilities,  and  lack  modern \ncommunication,  navigation,  and  weather  equipment.

Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  and  Asian \nDevelopment Fund Grant to Nepal for Air Transport Capacity Enhancement Project. Manila (Grant 0181-NEP for \n$10 million and Loan 2581-NEP for $70 million, approved on 23 November). \n\n\flong term, however, the combined international and domestic passenger traffic volume at TIA is \nforecasted  to  reach  9.3  million  passengers  by  2028.  To  meet  this  demand,  further  capacity \nexpansion  and  safety  enhancements  are  envisaged  at  TIA  and  the  domestic  airports  and \nairstrips,  particularly  in  the  remote  locations  with  high  tourism  development  potential.  ADB\u2019s \nassistance in the air transport subsector is supporting sustained improvements to and upgrading \nof the air transport system with emphasis on safety, capacity, and security, and enhancing the \nCivil  Aviation  Authority  of  Nepal\u2019s  (CAAN\u2019s)  institutional  capabilities  and  organizational \neffectiveness (footnote 6).  \n \n9. \nTo  further  expand  necessary  investment  in  infrastructure,  the  government  has  also \nexpressed  a  commitment  to  develop  and  implement  transport  infrastructure  projects  through \npublic\u2013private partnership. However, in both the road and air transport subsectors, the start-up \nactivities  have  been  limited  and  there  is  a lack of  a  clear sector  strategy  and  road  maps.  The \npreparatory  capacity  is  low  and  institutional  arrangement  for  implementation  is  uncertain.  To \nfacilitate  an  enabling  environment,  there  is  a  need  to  conduct  sector  diagnostics,  clarify  or \ndevelop  sector  road  maps,  and  provide  capacity  strengthening \nfor  preparation  and \nimplementation. \n \n10. \nThe  main  objective  of  the  facility  is  to  help  ensure  that  critically  important  road  and  air \ntransport  projects  are  implemented  efficiently  by  reducing  the  implementation  gap  period  that \nexists  between  project  concept  and  loan  approval  and  the  commencement  of  improvement \nworks. The facility will systematically advance the preparation of high-priority transport projects, \nincluding  feasibility  studies,  safeguard  due  diligence,  detail  engineering  design,  bidding \ndocuments, and procurement assistance for advance contracting, as appropriate. The targeted \noutcome is a reduced implementation gap for ADB-funded projects from a typical 27 months to \n6  months.  The \nthe \nimplementation  performance  of  ensuing  transport  projects  in  Nepal,  helping  to  achieve  the \nintended outcomes efficiently and realizing their impact and benefits in a timely manner. \n \n11. \nAt least two road transport projects and one air transport project will be prepared under \nthe  facility.  The  road  transport  component  will  prepare  improvement  projects  for  high-priority \nSRN  sections  of  about  1,300  km,  identified  in  the  PIP.  To  enhance  subregional  connectivity, \npriorities will also include SRN links to subregional transport corridors identified under the South \nAsian  Association  for  Regional  Cooperation  (SAARC)  Regional  Multimodal  Transport  Study.7 \nThe  air  transport  component  will  prepare  capacity  enhancement  and  safety  improvements  at \nTIA in Kathmandu and other regional airports, as well as the domestic airports serving remote \nareas that are otherwise inaccessible by road.  \n \n12. \nThe facility will also provide capacity development support to help establish an enabling \nenvironment  for  preparing  and  implementing  PPP  projects  in  the  road  and  air  transport \nsubsectors. This support will include  \n\nto  contribute  significantly \n\nis  expected \n\nimproving \n\ntowards \n\nfacility \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nfor PPP sector diagnostics and sector maps: (a) reviewing the legal, regulatory, \nand  policy  frameworks;  (b)  assessing  institutional  structures;  (c)  conducting \nstakeholder consultation; and (d) clarifying the sector strategy and road map;  \nfor  identifying  and  preparing  at  least  one  small-scale  pilot  PPP  project:  (a) \nassessing  and  selecting  PPP  options,  (b)  defining  procurement  and  bid \nevaluation processes, and (c) preparing bid packages; and  \nprocurement assistance, as appropriate. \n\n                                                 \n7   SAARC Secretariat. 2007.

However,  other  candidate  roads  could  also  be  considered  if \nworthy in terms of improving accessibility (especially for poor people in rural areas); contributing \nto  reduced  social  exclusion;  and  enhancing  connectivity  to  regional  and  economic  centers, \ninternational  borders,  and  district  headquarters. For  the  air  transport  subsector,  the  facility  will \nprepare  improvement  projects  to  enhance  safety,  capacity,  and  security  in  line  with  the  Civil \nAviation Sector Strategy and Infrastructure Development Plan,9 updated master plan for TIA,10 \nand the National Air Transport Development Plan.11  \n \n14. \nThe implementation of the facility will be phased in line with ADB\u2019s pipeline projects. For \ninstance, the preparation of about 900 km of SRN roads (subgroup 1) will start immediately to \nfacilitate  the  processing  of  ADB-funded  transport  projects  according  to  the  Nepal  country \noperations business plan 2011\u20132013.12 Preparation for the remaining SRN roads (subgroup 2, \nabout  400  km)  will  commence  in  about  mid-2013  for  potential  transport  projects  to  be  funded \nduring later years by ADB and/or other development partners. \n \n15. \nThe road and air transport projects prepared under the facility will contribute to improved \nconnectivity and accessibility. The facility supports the strategic objective established in ADB's \nNepal country partnership strategy 2010\u20132012: assisting the government to achieve regionally \nbalanced economic growth and reduced social inequalities. The facility is included in the Nepal \ncountry operations business plan 2010\u20132013. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  will  be  enhanced  transport  connectivity.

For  the \nroads  in  the  hill  areas,  bioengineering  techniques  will  be  considered  (where  appropriate)  as \nsupplement  to  protect  and  stabilize  roadside  slopes.14 For  the  roads  in  the  low  plain  areas, \nconventional civil engineering measures will be assessed, including embankment height, design \nvalues of storm frequency and runoff, drainage, and other appropriate technologies. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nFor the follow-on loans and grants, economic and financial viability and sustainability will \n26. \nbe  assessed.  The  economic  assessment  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nGuidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects,  assessing  the  economic  life  of  the \ncomponents  and  identifying  the  economic  benefits  of  each  investment  component  comparing \nthe  with-project  and  without-project  situation.15 For  revenue-generating  loans  and  grants,  the \nfinancial  analysis  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial \nGovernance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by ADB (2002), calculating the \nfinancial internal rate of return for the overall investment and establishing the financial viability \nby  comparing  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  with  the  cost  of  capital,  taking  into  account \nfinancial costs and benefits. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n27. \nPolicy  and  legal.  The  DOR,  implementing  agency  for  the  road  transport  component, \nwas  established  in  1961.  Under  the  MPPW,  the  DOR  is  responsible  for  developing  and \nmaintaining the strategic road network comprising the national arterial roads and major feeder \nroads  connecting  to  local  and  rural  roads.  The  DOR\u2019s  mission  is  to  contribute  to  achieving \nsustainable socioeconomic development by providing safe affordable public road infrastructure \nservices through the building of a cost-effective, efficient, and reliable road network system. The \nDOR is headed by a director general who reports to the secretary of the MPPW.  \n \n28. \nThe  CAAN,  the  implementing  agency  for  the  air  transport  component,  was  established \nby the Civil Aviation Authority Act in 1996 as an autonomous state authority, supervised by the \nMinistry  of  Tourism  and  Civil  Aviation.  The  CAAN  is  responsible  for  the  administration  of  civil \naviation in Nepal, regulating civil aviation and operating the national airports and air traffic and \nair  navigation  systems.  Legal  authority  for  the  government  to  regulate  civil  aviation  was \nestablished  in  1960  through  the  Civil  Aviation  Act  which,  although  amended  periodically, \nremains the fundamental enabling legislation for regulation of civil aviation in Nepal.  \n \n29. \nInstitutional capacity. The DOR has a good track record of implementing ADB-funded \nprojects, and its capacity is being further enhanced under ADB\u2019s ongoing capacity development \ntechnical  assistance,  which  includes  training  to  carry  out  feasibility  studies  for  road  transport \nprojects,  and  learning  best  practices  in  contract  management  and  quality  assurance  systems \n(footnote 4). The CAAN\u2019s performance in regulating civil aviation has ensured that a good safety \nrecord  has  been  achieved  for  air  transport  operations  in  Nepal\u2019s  uniquely  hazardous  aviation \nenvironment, while the operation of the airport and air navigation system has generated a profit \nfor  the  CAAN  since  2004.  ADB\u2019s  recently  approved  Air  Transport  Capacity  Enhancement \nProject  will  assess  further  improvement  needs  and  will  implement  a  3-year  capacity \n\n                                                 \n14  Bioengineering  combines  vegetation  with  minor  structures  to  protect  and  stabilize  slopes,  combining  indigenous \nmethods  with  modern  engineering.  The  DOR's  division  offices  throughout  Nepal  use  bioengineering  in  the \nconstruction, maintenance, and upgrading of all roads, especially in hilly and mountainous areas. \n\n15  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\ndevelopment  program  enhancing  the  CAAN's  organizational  and  management  capabilities \n(footnote 6).  \n \n30. \nBoth  the  DOR  (for  the  road  component)  and  CAAN  (for  the  air  transport  component) \nhave  sufficient  capacity,  past  experience,  and  institutional  strength  to  implement  the  facility. \nAlso, during implementation, both the DOR and CAAN will be supported by consultant services \nfor feasibility studies, detail design, bidding documents, and applicable social and environmental \ndue diligence. \n \n31. \nFinancial  management.  Financial  management  assessment  was  carried  out  for  the \nimplementing  agencies\u2014the  DOR  (for  the  national  road  transport  component)  and  the  CAAN \n(for the air transport component). The DOR has prior and ongoing experience with implementing \nADB-funded projects and has satisfactory capacity in terms of project financial accounting and \nknowledge of ADB disbursement procedures. Within the DOR\u2019s Project Directorate, the project \nimplementation  unit  for  the  road  transport  component,  there  will  be  a  dedicated  project \naccounting  and  finance  team  consisting  of  three  qualified  accountants:  a  chief  project \naccountant and two assistant accountants. \n \n32. \nThe CAAN operates with an adequate system of financial and management accounting, \nreporting,  auditing,  and  internal  controls.  However,  efficiency  is  weak  due  to  inadequate  staff \nresources  and  lack  of  a  computerized  information  system.  The  capacity  strengthening \ncomponent  of  ADB\u2019s  recently  approved  Air  Transport  Capacity  Enhancement  Project  will  help \naddress this by introducing a financial management information system consisting of accounting \nsoftware,  networked  computers,  and  training  (footnote  6).  The  CAAN  will  assign  suitably \nqualified  accountants  (a  chief  project  accountant  and  an  assistant  accountant)  to  the  project \ncoordination unit for project accounting and financial management. \n \n33. \nBoth  the  DOR  and  CAAN  will  establish  and  maintain  separate  project  records  and \naccounts  to  identify  the  financing  resources  received  and  expenditures  made  for  the  facility, \nensuring an adequate audit trail. An independent auditor will annually audit the project accounts \nand related financial statements in accordance with international auditing standards. To further \nminimize any risks, ADB's direct payment procedure will be utilized for substantial disbursement \nof payments for works, goods, and consulting services. \n \n34. \nProcurement  and  anticorruption.  The  government  has  promulgated  the  Public \nProcurement Act 2007 and Public Procurement Regulations 2007\u2014both generally acceptable to \nADB  and  encompassing  best  international  procurement  practices.  These  will  be  followed  for \nnational procurement of goods and works, subject to the national competitive bidding annex in \nthe  procurement  plan.  This  annex  documents  clarifications  and  adjustments  necessary  for  the \nnational  systems  to  be  used  on  ADB-financed  contracts  bid  for  under  national  competitive \nbidding  procedures.  As  mandated  by  the  act,  the  Public  Procurement  Monitoring  Office  has \nbeen assigned as an oversight agency for public procurement in Nepal. The Public Procurement \nMonitoring  Office, 16  under  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  and  Council  of  Ministers,  is \nmandated, among other things, to make recommendations to the government for reform of the \nprocurement  policy  or  laws,  issue  technical  guidelines  and  manuals  on  procurement,  prepare \nstandard  bidding  documents,  and  conduct  regular  training  programs  for  stakeholders.  The \ngovernment  is  strengthening  its  effort  to  fight  corruption  and  has  enacted  legislation  with \n\n                                                 \n16  ADB is providing technical assistance to strengthen the Public Procurement Monitoring Office in order to implement \nrequirements of the newly enacted act and regulations.

The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (Appendix 2). The DOR and CAAN \nwill  publish  pertinent  information  relating  to  the  facility  on  their  websites,  including  business \nopportunities associated with the project, and information related to consulting services. \n \n36. \nThe  National  Vigilance  Centre  was  established  in  August  2002,  under  the  direct \nsupervision and control of the Prime Minister of Nepal, to create awareness against corruption \nand  activities  related  to  prevent  corruption.  Both  the  DOR  and  CAAN  will  appoint  auditors \ncertified by the National Vigilance Centre to conduct a technical audit of the facility to examine \nhow well the objectives were met within the allocated time frame and budget. Technical audits \nwill be conducted during the implementation, assessing accomplishment that is mainly related to \ndesign quality, road safety audit implementation, schedule, and budget. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nFrom  the  follow-on  transport  investments  prepared  under  the  proposed  facility,  the \n37. \nimproved  condition  and  higher  density  of  the  road  network  will  facilitate  delivery  of  social \nservices  and  access  to  shops,  markets,  schools,  and  hospitals,  and  help  induce  opportunities \nfor non-agriculture employment and incomes. \n \n38. \nThe  facility  is  not  expected  to  have  any  physical  impact  on  gender  and  social \ndimensions. Follow-on loans and grants will be prepared in compliance with ADB's Guidelines \nfor  Incorporation  of  Social  Dimensions  in  Projects  and  ADB's  Handbook  on  Social  Analysis.17 \nGender, consultation and participation, labor, HIV/AIDS, and other social risks relating to follow-\non  loans  and  grants  will  be  assessed,  and  mitigation  plans  will  be  prepared  to  address  those \nissues. \n \nThe  facility  combines  project  feasibility  study  and  detailed  design,  and  safeguard  due \n39. \ndiligence,  ensuring  that  (i)  follow-on  investment  projects  will  be  implemented  without \nunnecessary  delay,  and  (ii)  development  impact  of  the  follow-on  investment  projects  will \nmaterialize without delay. \n \nE. \n\n \nSafeguards \n\n40. \nThe  facility  is  expected  to  ensure  development  of  environmentally  and  socially  viable \ninvestment  loans.  The  follow-on  loans  and  grant  will  be  prepared  in  compliance  with  ADB's \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  government  guidelines,  regulations,  and  policies.  The \nfacility is not expected to have any adverse social and environmental consequences due to the \nnature  of  the  proposed  intervention,  i.e.,  project  preparation.  The  safeguard  categorization  for \nthe facility is \u201cC\u201d for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples, respectively. \nDuring the feasibility studies, the consultants will prepare environmental impact assessments or \ninitial environmental examinations, including environmental management plans, for the selected \nsubprojects.  Similarly,  resettlement  planning,  indigenous  peoples  planning,  and  gender \n\n                                                 \n17  ADB. 1994.

Major  risks  associated  with  implementing  the  facility  were  identified  and  practical \nmitigation measures were assessed as appropriate. To mitigate potential lack of oversight and \nguidance  with  respect  to  procurement,  the  Public  Procurement  Monitoring  Office  (footnote  16) \nwill carry out training for project implementation unit staff of the Departments of Roads and Civil \nAviation Authority of Nepal on technical guidelines and manuals, including refresher courses for \nthe  latest  ADB  procurement  guidelines  and  standard  bidding  documents.  To  enhance \nprocurement transparency, the Departments of Roads and Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal will \ndisclose information about the facility and business opportunities associated with the facility on \ntheir websites. To help deter corruption, auditors certified by the National Vigilance Centre will \nconduct  a  technical  audit  during  the  implementation,  assessing  accomplishment  that  is  mainly \nrelated to design quality, road safety audit implementation, schedule, and budget. \n \n42. \nmitigating measures are described in the risk assessment and risk management plan.18 \n \n\nThe integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs.
