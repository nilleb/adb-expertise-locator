THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Heilongjiang Energy Efficient District Heating \nProject.1  \n \n2.  The proposed project will expand and upgrade district heating systems (DHSs) in eight \ncities of Heilongjiang province to make the systems energy efficient, thereby reducing emission \nof greenhouse gases and air pollutants.2 The project will install energy efficient heating sources \nand heat exchangers, insulated pipelines, and computerized monitoring and control systems. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The PRC has experienced a rapid increase in energy consumption in tandem with \nsustained economic growth, especially since 2000. By the end of 2010, the primary energy \ndemand in the PRC had increased to more than 3.00 billion tons of standard coal equivalent \n(btce), compared to 1.39 btce in 2000. The PRC relies heavily on carbon-intensive coal, which \nprovided about 70% of its primary energy in 2010.3 Electricity generation and heat supplies \naccount for about half of the total coal consumption in the PRC. The Government of the PRC \nhas recognized the challenges posed by the rapid rise in energy consumption and associated \nemissions. It has committed to achieve 40%\u201345% carbon intensity reduction by 2020 compared \nwith 2005, primarily by targeting energy intensity reductions.4 During the Eleventh Five-Year \nPlan,  2006\u20132010  the energy  intensity  was  reduced  by 19.06%  compared  with  a  target of \n20.00%. During the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015 the PRC has set a further energy \nintensity reduction target of 16%, an 8% reduction of sulfur dioxide (SO ), and a 10% reduction \n2\nof nitrogen oxide (NO ). Heilongjiang province has set corresponding targets of reducing energy \nx\nintensity by 16.0%, SO  emission by 2.0% (10,000 tons [t]), and NO  emission by 3.1% (23,000 \n2 x\nt) by 2015 compared to 2010.5  \n \n4.  The  PRC  is  the  second-largest  district  heating  market  in  the  world,  the  Russian \nFederation being the largest. Because of the large demand, 13  provinces, 3 autonomous \nregions,  and  two  cities  have  adopted  centralized  heating.6The  DHS  coverage  area  is \ncontinuously  expanding  to  keep  pace  with  the  rapid  economic  growth  and  urbanization. \nBetween 2003 and 2010, centralized heating coverage in the PRC increased from 1.9 billion \nsquare meters (m2) to 4.4 billion m2. However, DHS still covers only 30% of the total floor area \n                                                 \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance.

China Energy Statistical Year Book. Beijing. \n4  Carbon intensity is the amount of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of gross domestic product (GDP). Energy \nintensity is the amount of energy consumed per unit of GDP. In the PRC, the energy intensity is generally \nmeasured in tons of coal equivalent per CNY10,000 of GDP.  \n5  State  Council.  2011.  Circular  of  the  State  Council  on  Issuing  the  Comprehensive  Work  Plan  for  Energy \nConservation and Emission Reduction during the Twelfth Five-Year Plan Period, Decree No. 26. Beijing. \n6  The provinces are Anhui, Gansu, Hebei, Heilongjiang, Henan, Hubei, Jiangsu, Jilin, Liaoning, Qinghai, Shaanxi, \nShandong, and Shanxi. The autonomous regions are Inner Mongolia, Ninxia, and Xinjiang. The cities are Beijing \nand Tianjin. ", "2 \ncompared to coverage of about 60% in European countries. Coverage is particularly low in low-\nincome urban areas.  \n \n5.  Heilongjiang is an underdeveloped inland province in the northeastern region of the \nPRC. Heating service in Heilongjiang, where temperatures fall below \u201340\u00b0C and the heating \nseason lasts for up to 6 months, meets one of the basic human needs and provides essential \nsupport  to  socioeconomic  activities.  Northeastern  provinces,  including  Heilongjiang,  are  a \nsource  of  transboundary  air  pollution  such  as  acid  rain.  The  centralized  heating  area  in \nHeilongjiang has increased from 199 million m2 in 2003 to 384 million m2 in 2010. By 2015, the \nprovince plans to increase the district heating coverage area by another 200 million m2, which \nwill cover up to 70% of the cities and counties in the province. Many existing heating systems in \nthe province are old and inefficient, and lack modern emission control equipment. Combustion \nefficiency of existing small heat-only boilers of 55% in many cities is far below the 87% that can \nbe achieved in modern combined heat and power (CHP) plants or large heat-only boilers.  \n \n6.  The  existing  inadequate  coverage  of  district  heating  in  low-income  urban  areas  in \nHeilongjiang compels households to use coal stoves for heating, and these are a major cause of \nindoor air pollution and respiratory diseases. The poor indoor air quality in households has a \ndisproportionately high effect on women and children, who spend most of their time indoors. \nThere were 18 cases of carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning and 10 fire accidents caused by \nhousehold stoves from 2008 to 2010 in the project areas. Emissions from existing small and \ninefficient neighborhood boilers, most of which lack emission control equipment, also worsen \noutdoor air quality and cause significant cumulative harm to public health. Providing cleaner and \nreliable district heating services to households and other community areas will (i) reduce cases \nof respiratory diseases through improved indoor and outdoor air quality, reduce CO poisoning \nby providing safer district heating services, and improve the medical environment; (ii) improve \nliving conditions; (iii) reduce heating expenditure by switching from individual household stoves \nand decentralized heating systems to centralized energy efficient heating systems; (iv) provide a \nbetter  schooling  environment  during  the  winter;  and  (v)  increase  incomes  through  job \nopportunities  created  during  construction  and  operation.  Women  and  vulnerable  people \nconnected to the modern district heating networks will enjoy a cleaner, safer living environment. \n \n7.  The  project  will  target  selected  cities  where  the  poverty  ratio  is  as  high  as  8.7% \n(compared to the national average of 7.7%) and district heating coverage is particularly low. The \nproject will demonstrate that significant expansion of energy efficient DHSs to an additional 27 \nmillion  m2  (270,000  households)  can  be  introduced  without  increasing  net  emissions.  The \nproject will remove small, inefficient, and polluting neighborhood coal-fired boilers and coal-fired \nhousehold stoves; and construct centralized district heating networks where heat is supplied by \nhighly energy efficient CHP plants and large boilers, thereby reducing the overall carbon and air \npollution footprints of district heating. \n \n8.  The project is closely aligned with Strategy 2020, where moving developing member \ncountries onto low-carbon growth paths by improving energy efficiency has been identified as \none  of  the  key  means  of  achieving  environmentally  sustainable  growth. 7  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Energy Policy prioritizes projects on energy efficiency and access to \nenergy  for  all,  including  district  heating,  for  energy  efficiency  improvement  and  access  to \nmodern cleaner heating services for all.8 The country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for the \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2008.

The impact will be improved energy efficiency and a cleaner environment in Heilongjiang \nprovince. The outcome will be improved air quality and reduced greenhouse gas emissions in \neight urban areas in Heilongjiang province. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n10.  The outputs will be (i) expanded district heating coverage in eight project cities (footnote \n2) without net increase in emissions, (ii) improved energy efficient heat generation capacity in \nthree project cities,10 and (iii) promotion of private sector participation in district heating in two \nproject cities.11 The components of each subproject are summarized in Table 1.  \n \nTable 1: Summary of Subprojects \n    Heating \n  New Heating    Heating  Small  Area \n  Source  No. of Heat  SCADA  Pipeline  Boiler  (million \nSubproject  (MWth)a  Exchangers  System  (km)  Closure  m2)\n1.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n15.  Several  energy  efficiency  measures  have  been  adopted  in  designing  the  project, \nincluding (i) purchasing heat from existing CHP plants or constructing large heat-only boilers \nwith  circulating  fluidized-bed  technology,  (ii)  adopting  computerized  systems  to  control  the \ndemand and supply of heat which prevents the overheating of buildings, and (iii) pilot testing the \nhousehold-consumption-based  billing  system  in  two  subprojects  to  moderate  the  heating \ndemand. 14  \n \n16.  The  alternative  heat  sources  considered  include  renewable  sources  (heat  pumps, \ngeothermal, biomass, and solar), natural gas, heat from existing CHP plants, and large coal-\nfired boilers. On further evaluation, natural gas was considered unfeasible due to limited supply \nin the project area. There are no renewable energy sources available that are technically and \nfinancially viable with incremental cost and reasonable time frame in the project area. CHP \n                                                 \n14 Install a supervisory control and data acquisition system, which allows for regulation of the temperature and flow of \nhot water automatically based on actual heat consumption and outdoor temperature.  \n ", "6 \nplants (with thermal efficiencies of 90% or higher) and large coal-fired boilers (with combustion \nefficiency of 87% or higher) with post-combustion emission control devices to meet the national \nstandards in reducing air emissions were found to be the least-cost feasible option to meet the \nheating  requirements  reliably  in  the  project  cities.  The  circulating  fluidized-bed combustion \ntechnology was selected among available technologies for all the heating plants under the \nproject as it has higher combustion efficiency, lower NO  emission, and lower desulfurization \nx\ncost. Compared to the existing small and inefficient heating boilers (42% combustion efficiency), \nnew heating boilers improve thermal efficiency to 87% and reduce associated carbon dioxide \nand  other  emissions.  Small  heating  boilers  owned  by  the  implementing  agencies  will  be \ndecommissioned after heating networks are connected to the new heat sources. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n17.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  is  calculated  for  each  subproject.  The \nfinancial analysis of the subprojects indicates FIRRs of between 8.6% and 9.9%, which for each \ncase is higher than the corresponding weighted average cost of capital. The overall FIRR for the \nwhole project is 9.5%, compared with the weighted average cost of capital of 2.3%. Sensitivity \nanalysis shows that the project is likely to be sustainable under various adverse scenarios. \n \n18.  The economic benefits of the upgraded district heating supply include improved heating \nefficiency and environment. The calculations reflect all the project-related costs, benefits from \ncost  savings  from  alternative  fuels  and  efficiency  improvements,  plus  local  and  global \nenvironmental benefits. Analyses for each subproject indicate economic internal rates of return \n(EIRR) without environmental benefits ranging from 12.5% to 20.6%. The EIRR of the whole \nproject without environmental benefits is 17.9%, which is more than the 12.0% economic cost of \ncapital. The analyses for each subproject indicate EIRRs with environmental benefits ranging \nfrom 16.4% to 25.3%. The EIRR of the whole project with environmental benefits is 21.1%, \nwhich is more than the 12.0% economic cost of capital. Therefore, the project is economically \nfeasible. Sensitivity analysis shows that the project is likely to be sustainable under various \nadverse scenarios.  \n \nC.  Governance \n19.  Financial management assessment was conducted for the implementing agencies.15 All \ncompanies  have  large  shareholder  equity,  which  can  support  more  debt  financing  from \ncommercial banks. The assessment indicates that accrual based accounting and the PRC \nbusiness  accounting  standards  are  followed.  The  accounting  procedures  used  by  the \nimplementing agencies are aligned with the regulations and policies issued by the Ministry of \nFinance, and are considered effective and adequate for the project. The executing agency has \nexperience in implementing several projects financed by ADB, and has a good track record in \nfinancial management of those projects.16  \n                                                 \n15 Financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  under  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  in  2011. \nFinancial Management Assessment of the Implementing Agencies (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2).  \n16  The Heilongjiang provincial government is administering four ADB loans: ADB. 2005.

Procurement capacity assessment was performed on the executing and implementing \nagencies.17 The  executing  agency  has  skilled  and  experienced  staff  supported  by  well-\nestablished  procedures  and  systems  to  manage  procurement  that  is  consistent  with  ADB \nrequirements. Implementing agencies lacking experience in conducting international competitive \nbidding will be trained in various aspects of procurement and project management (para. 11).  \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the Heilongjiang provincial government (HPG). The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in paras. 57 and 58 of the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n22.  Social benefits. The project will directly benefit more than 1.63 million urban residents \nof the project cities, about half of whom (0.81 million) are female and 37,000 of whom are from \npoor households, and provide direct benefits to 174,625 children in 314 schools and patients \nand medical staff in 108 hospitals. The project will  \n(i)  reduce cases of respiratory diseases through improved indoor and outdoor air \nquality, reduce CO poisoning by providing safer district heating services, and \nprovide a better medical environment by providing cleaner and reliable heating \nservices to hospitals;  \n(ii)  improve living conditions through adequate and reliable heating services;  \n(iii)  reduce heating expenditure by switching from individual household stoves and \ndecentralized heating systems to centralized energy efficient heating systems;  \n(iv)  provide a better schooling environment during the winter by providing cleaner \nand reliable heating services; and  \n(v)  increase  income  through  job  opportunities  created  during  construction  and \noperation (3,413 jobs during construction and 1,339 during operation). \n \n23.  Labor retrenchment. A total of 2,075 boiler workers (520 full-time and 1,555 seasonal \nworkers)  will  be  affected  by  the  closure  of  around  470  small  coal-fired  boilers.  A  labor \nretrenchment and reemployment plan was prepared to safeguard the livelihoods of the affected \nworkers.18 All of the 520 full-time workers under the Jiagedaqi, Jiamusi, Yichun City\u2013Xinqing, \nand Yichun City\u2013Tangwanghe subprojects will be transferred to the operation and maintenance \nof  heat  exchange  stations.  The  temporary  seasonal  workers  will  be  informed  by  the \nimplementing agencies of the status of boiler closures before the end of the final heating \nseason.  Since  they  are  contractual  seasonal  workers,  the  implementing  agencies  are  not \nobliged to retain them and provide employment assistance. However, if the workers would like \nto work at the heat supply plants as seasonal workers, they are eligible to participate in the \ntechnical training for potential new positions. Those who have completed the training course \nmay be hired on a contractual or permanent basis depending on vacancies and proficiency. \n \n24.  Gender impact. The project\u2019s impact on women includes (i) access to cleaner, safer, \nand reliable heating system; (ii) reduced domestic chores related to space heating (1 hour per \nday);  (iii)  reduced  incidence  of  respiratory  diseases  related  to  indoor  air  pollution;  and                    \n(iv) reduced incidence of CO poisoning and accidental fires. There are some areas to be \nimproved to make the project more gender responsive, such as raising awareness on energy \n                                                 \n17 Procurement Capacity Assessment Report and Recommendations (accessible in the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2.) \n18 Labor Retrenchment and Reemployment Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nconservation focusing on women, and improving gender-responsive customer orientation in \nheating service delivery. \n \n25.  A gender action plan was prepared to maximize the project benefit on women, safeguard \npoor households headed by women, increase the participation of women in the district heating \nindustry, and monitor the project impact on women.19 Under the project  \n(i)  job opportunities will be promoted for women as heating bill collectors, targeting \n50% as women;  \n(ii)  heating assistance will be ensured for the 1,300 poor households headed by \nwomen by subsidizing 70% of the heating tariff (by the local government) and \nwaiving connection fees (by the heating companies);  \n(iii)  energy conservation awareness campaigns will be organized, targeting about \n800,000 women (100% of the women in subproject areas) in partnership with the \nwomen\u2019s federation;  \n(iv)  a targeted session on women and district heating will be held in the knowledge-\nsharing workshop between private and state-owned district heating companies; \nand \n(v)  a separate session on women and district heating will be held at the regional \nconference on district heating. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n26.  Environmental benefits. The project results in substantial environmental benefits by \nreplacing around 470 small, old, and inefficient heating boilers and 275,166 household stoves \n(equivalent to about 1,014 megawatt thermal) with energy efficient CHP or heating boilers, and \nrehabilitating heating pipes to reduce heat losses. The net reduction in annual coal consumption \nis estimated at 418,889 t, which results in the reduction of 1 million t of carbon dioxide,20 4,500 t \nof SO ,21 1,961 t of NO 22 and 22,819 t of particulate matter.  \n2 x\n \n27.  The project is classified category B for environment and C for involuntary resettlement \nand indigenous peoples. The potential adverse environmental impacts of the project include              \n(i) soil erosion during construction, (ii) increased noise and dust affecting local residents during \nconstruction, (iii) inappropriate storage of hazardous materials and wastes during operation,             \n(iv) safety risks to community members and workers during construction and operation, and               \n(v) flue gas emissions during operation. Specific potential adverse impacts caused by the \ndemolition of small boilers are (i) wastes such as equipment and building materials, and (ii) dust \nand noise from demolition of boiler houses and chimneys. The initial environmental examination \n(IEE) concludes that the potential adverse environmental impacts can be adequately mitigated \nthrough appropriate mitigation measures, as outlined in the project environmental management \nplan (EMP) presented in the IEE, and the project will result in environmental and socioeconomic \nbenefits that significantly outweigh potential negative impacts. \n \n28.  The HPG and the implementing agencies shall ensure that the project is designed, \nconstructed, and operated in accordance with relevant PRC national and local environmental \nlaws, regulations, procedures, and guidelines; ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009); and \n                                                 \n19 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 ADB will support the efforts of obtaining clean development mechanism benefits through its technical support \nfacility.  \n21 Equivalent to 45% of provincial reduction target. \n22 Equivalent to 8.5% of provincial reduction target. \n ", "9 \nthe EMP. 23 The HPG will ensure the boilers constructed under the project comply with both \nPRC flue gas emissions standards stipulated in the Emission Standard of Air Pollutants for \nCoal-burning,  Oil-burning,  Gas-fired  Boilers  (GB  13217-2001)  and  in  the  World  Bank\u2019s \nEnvironmental,  Health,  and  Safety  Guidelines  for  Thermal  Power  Plants.24 Environmental \nmonitoring reports will be submitted to ADB biannually during construction, and then annually \nduring operations. The EMP including mitigation measures, a monitoring plan, and institutional \narrangements  will  be  updated  during  engineering  design  and  incorporated  in  the  bidding \ndocuments and civil works contracts. The project has fully complied with the ADB information \ndisclosure and meaningful consultation requirements. \n \nF.  Special Features \n \n29.  Heating service delivery in Heilongjiang is primarily by state-owned enterprises (SOEs). \nAlthough the heating subsector\u2019s high growth rate provides significant opportunity for private \nsector participation, this has been slow primarily because of (i) high investment costs but \nmarginal returns due to low heating tariffs; (ii) reluctance of local financial institutions to provide \ndebt financing, particularly in remote urban areas with smaller consumer bases, because of \nperceived high risks; and (iii) the small number of private companies with the required technical, \nfinancial, and managerial capacity to operate such utilities. Weak customer orientation in service \ndelivery  by  SOEs  causes  low  tariff  collection  rates.  Modernization  of  state-owned  heating \ncompanies and capacity strengthening in critical areas of financial management, tariff collection, \nand customer service can help to increase the viability of heating businesses.  \n \n30.  The project will provide affordable financial support to two private enterprises25 and play \na catalytic role in mobilizing commercial financing. To benefit from good business practices of \nprivate  sector  enterprises,  knowledge-sharing  sessions  will  be  organized  between  private \nenterprises and SOEs to draw suggestions on reforms to the business environment. A regional \nconference on district heating with the likely participation of neighboring northern provinces and \ncountries (i.e., Japan, Republic of Korea, and member  countries of Central Asia Regional \nEconomic  Cooperation)  fostering  regional  cooperation  through  knowledge  sharing  will  be \norganized by the HPG using the proposed loan. All of these activities will help increase private \nsector development and subregional cooperation.  \n \nG.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.26 \n \n                                                 \n23 ADB. 2009.
