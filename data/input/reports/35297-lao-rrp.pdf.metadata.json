Given \n\nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) \n \nTargeting classification: Targeted intervention \nSector: Agriculture and natural resources \nSubsector: Livestock \nThemes: Sustainable economic growth, inclusive social \ndevelopment, and gender and development \nSubthemes: Developing rural areas and indigenous people, and \ngender equity in livelihood opportunities \n \nCategory B \nAn initial environmental examination was undertaken. \n \nLack  of  access  to  adequate  productive  resources  and  marketing \nopportunities  leads  to  the  absence  of  sustainable  livelihoods  for \nthe  predominantly  poor  upland  ethnic  groups  in  northern  Lao \nPDR.  The  principal  constraints  faced  by  the  predominantly  Lao \nTheung  and  Lao  Sung  ethnic  groups  in  the  project  area  relate, \namong  other  issues,  to  (i)  falling  productivity  from  upland \nagriculture,  (ii)  lack  of  adequate  land  and  forest  for  food \nproduction  and  gathering,  and  (iii)  lack  of  access  to  appropriate \ntechnologies  and  marketing  opportunities  for  improved  livestock \nthe  dependency  of  upland \nproduction  and \ncommunities  on  swidden  agriculture,  and  its  falling  productivity \nand land availability constraints, there is an urgent need to shift to \nhigher  value  production  per  hectare  and  per  unit  of  labor. \nImproved livestock production provides such an option. Livestock \nproduction  provides  within  a  context  of  small  farms  in  upland \nareas,  an  opportunity  to  capture  higher  value  added  per  hectare \nthan crop-based agriculture. The growing connectivity of Lao PDR \nalso places it in an advantageous position vis-\u00e0-vis regional trade \nto  supply  the  growing  demand  for  livestock  from  neighboring \ncountries.  It  holds  out  promise  of  improved  nutrition  and  food \nsecurity  for  groups  that  are  particularly  vulnerable  to  food \nshortages  and  lack  of  protein  in  their  diets.  The  role  of  livestock \nrearing  in  resource-poor  upland  households  is  highly  significant, \nas it contributes to food security and more than one third of cash \nincome  derived  from  agriculture.  Livestock  productivity  has  been \nseverely  constrained  by  the  lack  of  appropriate  production \ntechnologies,  household \ninefficiencies, \nfinancial and extension services, and access to markets. Against \nthis  background,  the  Project  proposes  to:  (i)  enhance  village \nlivestock systems by (a) improving on farm livestock productivity,; \n(b)  market  linkages  and  enterprise  development  to  support \nlivestock  rearing;  and  (c)  an  enhanced  participatory  extension \nnetwork;  (ii)  support  capacity  building  for  community  driven \ndevelopment (CDD); and (iii) support for project management and \nimplementation. \n \n\nlabor  availability  and \n\n \nBorrower/Recipient \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProject Description \n\n \n\n\fii \n\nRationale \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nImpact and Outcome \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nThe  majority  of  the  population  in  the  project  area,  predominantly \nLao  Theung  and  Lao  Sung  ethnic  groups,  is  poor  and  lacks \naccess to productive resources essential for subsistence. At least \n60% of the population is poor, with much higher levels of poverty \nand  food  shortages  in  particular  areas.  Education  levels  among \nthe  Lao  Theung  and  Lao  Sung  ethnic  groups  are  low,  especially \namong women. Literacy rates in the project area vary from 33% to \n75%  but  are  considerably  lower  among  women  and  upland \ncommunities.  Most  households  experience  food  shortages  for \nseveral  months  each  year.  Lao  Theung  and  Lao  Sung  ethnic \ngroups  are  increasingly  facing  the  loss  of  traditional  livelihoods, \nwhich  has  created  \u201cnew  poverty\u201d  and  food  shortages.  Livestock \nrearing  is  an  integral  part  of  the  upland  farming  system  and  its \ndevelopment  will  impact  favorably  on  the  poor  and  on  women. \nAlthough livestock improvement was the topmost priority identified \nby them during the Participatory Poverty Assessment of Lao PDR, \n(PPA),  these  communities  have  had  little  support  until  now.Their \naccess to extension support for livestock rearing has been limited \non  account  of  lack  of  technical  and  financial  resources  at  field \nlevel,  as  well  as  lack  of  culturally  responsive  extension  methods \nand widespread illiteracy among ethnic groups. Upland livelihoods \ncan  be  improved  from  present  levels  by  increasing  livestock \nproductivity,  better  nutrition,  disease \nimproved \nmanagement,  biosecurity  measures  (to  reduce  risk  of  disease), \nand  better  marketing.  These  steps  are  expected  to  lead  to \nincreased  returns  to  labor  and  improved  food  security  and \nnutrition of vulnerable groups, as well as in building up productive \nassets for the poor in upland areas.  \n\ncontrol, \n\nThe Project is highly relevant in a context where traditional upland \nlivelihoods,  based  on  swidden  agriculture  and  forest  resources, \nare facing a growing crisis. Livestock is the one productive asset \nthat  households  possess  that  clearly  belongs  to  them.  By \nimproving  livestock  management  practices,  and  addressing  the \nfactors  affecting \nlow  productivity\u2014including  poor  extension \nservices,  lack  of  adequate  livestock  assets,  lack  of  organization, \nand lack of access to markets\u2014the Project can ensure significant \ngains in upland livelihoods with relatively small investments. It can \nalso  reduce  demands  on  household  labor,  improve  its  efficiency, \nand  lead  to  greater  food  security  and  cash  incomes  for  poor \nupland communities. \n \nThe  Project  area  consists  of  approximately  1,500  villages  in  18 \npriority  poor  districts  of  five  northern  provinces  of  Lao  PDR.  Of \nthese  only  about  650  have  various  degrees  of  physical  access. \nThe Project directly targets approximately 408 villages, which are \nrelatively easier for extension staff to access throughout the year. \nThe  total  population  of  these  408  villages  is  146,880  persons  in \n24,480 households. Of these the Project is likely to impact directly \nupon  17,000  households.  Among \nthe  17,000  households, \nassuming  a  30%  adoption  rate  of  appropriate  technologies \nprovided by the project, by rearers of pigs and larger livestock, the \n\n\f \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProject Investment Plan \n \n \nFinancing Plan \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\niii\n\nProject is likely to result in increased incomes of up to $1400 per \nannum \nincluding \nfor  approximately  7,000  households.  By \nsmallholder poultry rearers, the number of beneficiary households \nwill increase by approximately 10,000, bringing the total number of \nbeneficiary  households  to  17,000.  Of  these  approximately  50% \nare expected to be poor.  \n \nIn addition, it is expected that communities living in the remaining \n250  villages  which  are  relatively  accessible  for  parts  of  the  year, \nare likely to benefit through peer group exchanges of information, \nand increasing interactions with trained extension staff. \n \nWith  and  without  Project  comparisons  show  that  the  Project \nenables the poor households to come out of poverty permanently \nby adopting the new production and management technologies. \n \nLao  Theung  and  Lao  Sung  ethnic groups will benefit  significantly \nfrom the Project (80% of all beneficiaries)\u2014including Khmu (38%), \nHmong  (18%),  Akha  (10%),  and  smaller  ethnic  groups  (14%). \nTai Kadai or Lowland Lao comprise the remainder (20%). At least \n50%  of  all  beneficiaries  will  be  women,  given  the  Project\u2019s  focus \non (i) improving management of small livestock, and (ii) providing \nequitable opportunities and support for ethnic women in particular \nto participate in project activities.  \n \nThe  outcome  of  the  Project  will  be  (i)  greater  sustainability  of \nupland livelihoods; (ii) reduced poverty; (iii) improved commercial \nprospects in the area for livestock production aimed at export and \ndomestic markets; (iv) improved nutrition and food security among \nthe  upland \nthe  poor;  and \ncommunities, particularly women. \n \nThe  total  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $18.4 \nmillion including contingencies, taxes, and duties. \n \n\nincreased  self-reliance  of \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n Item \n\n  ADB Loan \n\n  ADF Grant \n\n  Government \n\n  Beneficiaries \n\n  SDC \n\nIFAD \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTotal \n\n  Percent  \n\n($ million) \n \n\nTotal\n\nPercent \n\n9.3 \n\n0.7 \n\n1.1 \n\n0.8 \n\n3.5 \n\n3.0 \n\n18.4 \n\n100.0 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n50.5 \n\n4.0 \n\n5.8 \n\n4.4 \n\n19.0 \n\n16.3 \n\n100.0 \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  ADF  =  Asian  Development  Fund,  IFAD  = \nInternational  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development,  SDC  =  Swiss  Agency  for \nDevelopment and Cooperation. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\nLoan Amount and Terms \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide a loan of various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  $9.3  million  from  its  Special  Funds \nresources.

Financial  management  will \nrequire  close \ncoordination with the Department of Livestock and Fisheries (DLF) \nin  Vientiane.  Due  to  the  location  of  the  RO  at  Luang  Prabang, \nfinancial  management  will  be  performed  by  existing  staff  from \nwithin  the  Administration  Division  of  DLF,  to  be  appointed  to  a \nNational  Coordination  Office  (NCO)  in  Vientiane  to  address  ADB \nloan  withdrawal  and  replenishment.  Provincial  Implementation \nUnits  (PIUs)  and  associated  provincial  coordination  committees \n(PCCs)  chaired  by  the  provincial  vice  governor  with  members \nfrom  relevant  departments,  will  be  established,  in  order  to \ncoordinate  implementation  in  each  province.  The  PCCs  will  be \ncommon for all livestock projects at provincial level. The PIUs will \nbe established within the existing livestock section of each PAFO. \nThe District Agriculture and Forestry Extension Office (DAFEO) in \neach participating district will implement the Project at grassroots \nlevel through extension workers (EWs). \n \nThe  EWs  will  form  the  frontline  for  the  transfer  of  appropriate \ntechnologies  using  participatory  methods,  to  village  communities \norganized  for  the  purpose  into  groups.  Project  activities  will  be \nincorporated  into  DAFEO  work  plans  and  collated  into  annual \nPAFO  work  plans  that  will  be  approved  by  the  PCCs,  DLF,  and \nsubsequently MAF and  the PSC.

By  the  end  of  the  Project,  activities  will  cover  about \n408 villages in 18 districts as targeted by the sixth year of project \nimplementation.  \n \nfor \nThe \nfor  Capacity  Building \nSmallholder  Livestock  Systems  Project,  which  began \nin \nNovember 2005, will be responsible for training DAFEO staff in all \nfirst  year  districts  of  the  Project.  The  government  extension \nservice  will  be  responsible  for  facilitating  the  introduction  of  new \ntechnologies.  The  Swiss  Agency \nfor  Development  and \nCooperation  (SDC)  will  provide  grant  funding  through  joint \ncofinancing  for  capacity  building  of  extension  workers,  subject \nmatter  specialists  and  consultancy  contracts  for  organization, \nmobilization, and training of village communities. Capacity building \nat  several  levels  will  be  implemented  by  consultants  engaged \nunder the Project, supervised by the regional office.  \n \nCoordination  with  other  externally  aided  livestock  projects  being \nimplemented  in  the  same  districts  and  provinces  will  be  an \nimportant  aspect  of  project  implementation.  This  will  be  ensured \nthrough  the  provincial  and  national  committees  which  will  also \nreview implementation of other  livestock projects. \n \nVehicles,  equipment,  contract  services  to  be  financed  from  the \nproceeds  of  the  ADB  loan  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  Civil  works  comprise  small \ncontracts not exceeding $100,000, typically for building renovation \nand  construction  (district  offices  and  the  regional  office)  in  the \nmore remote district centers and for small-scale civil works carried \nout  in  remote  village  locations.  As  such,  civil  works  will  be \nin  accordance  with  national  competitive  bidding \nprocured \nprocedures among private local contractors acceptable to ADB. \n \nThe  Project  will  fund  a  total  of  64  person-months  of  international \nconsultants  and  402  person-months  of  national  consultants    in \nboth  short  and  long-term  assignments  to  be  recruited  through  a \nfirm  and  /or  individual  contracts.  Consulting  services  are  funded \nentirely  through  grant  financing.  ADB  in  consultation  with  the \nGovernment  of  Lao  PDR,  SDC  and  the  International  Fund  for \nAgricultural  Development  (IFAD)  will  directly  recruit  consultants \nfunded  under  the  Asian  Development  Fund  IX  (ADF  IX)  grant. \nThese \nto \nsmallholder poultry production, livestock marketing and trade, and \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  related  inputs.  The  SDC  grant  funded \nconsultant  services  for  livestock  improvement  inputs,  community \nmobilization, and gender and development, will be recruited by the \n\ninclude  project  management,  expertise \n\nrelated \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\nGovernment, in consultation with ADB, SDC and IFAD. The level \nof  consulting  services  identified  under  the  Project  is  considered \ncritical, in view of the crucial gaps in capacity. That is the rationale \nfor  SDC  support,  which  is  aimed  entirely  at  providing  critically \nrequired  inputs  to  improve  livestock  sector  performance  at  all \nlevels. Close monitoring of consultant service delivery and outputs \nwill be undertaken by the EA and ADB review missions. \n \nIn  addition  to  the  above,  consultancy  services  will  be  provided \nunder the SDC grant, through contracts negotiated by the RO with \nprovincial  and  district  units  of  Lao  Women\u2019s  Union  (LWU),  to \nfacilitate CDD.  \n \nConsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \nThe  Project  has  an  estimated  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of \n17%.  The  results  obtained  are  robust  to  adoption  rates  declines \nfor  appropriate \nfarm  gate  prices, \ndecreases  in  the  number  of  villages  impacted,  and    project  cost \nincreases.  The  majority  of  the  beneficiaries  will  be  the  poor  and \nfrom  Lao  Theung  and  Lao  Sung \nwomen,  drawn  mainly \ncommunities.  The  bulk  of  project  benefits  will  come \nfrom \nincremental production. Women in these communities will benefit \nfrom  improved  returns  to  labor,  access  to  knowledge,  financing \nservices,  and  improved  marketing  channels.  Nonquantifiable \nbenefits  include  (i)  sustainable  livelihood  systems;  (ii)  improved \nnutrition  of  vulnerable  groups,  including  children  and  young \ninclusive  social \nmothers, \ndevelopment;  (iv) \nimpacts  on \nparticipating \nterms  of  effective  coordination, \nimproved  communication,  guidance  and  technical  support;  and \n(vi)  reinforcement  of  the  role  of  DLF  as  the  lead  agency \nresponsible  for  planning  and  reviewing  progress  of  livestock \nsector objectives. \n\nthe  elderly; \nimproved  gender  equity;  (v) \n\ntechnologies,  declines \n\nthe  sick,  and \n\ninstitutions \n\n(iii) \n\nin \n\nin \n\nreal  alternative \n\nEnvironmental  impacts  will  be  positive,  with  improved  livestock \nto  environmentally \nproduction  providing  a \ndamaging  shifting  cultivation,  where  fallow  periods  have  reduced \ndramatically. Greater confinement of livestock will reduce damage \nto  forest  areas  and  the  possibility  of  soil  erosion  through \noverstocking  of  pastures,  as  well  as  provide  opportunities  for \nbetter management and use of manure, with potential benefits for \ncrop  production.  Negative  concerns  are  small  and  localized  for \nwhich there are mitigating measures (under the Project) to prevent \nany  negative  environmental  impact.  Through  improved  market \nlinks  and  enterprise  development,  domestic  and  international \ntrade  in  livestock  will  be  facilitated.  This  will  contribute  to  greater \ntransparency  regarding  trends  in  market  demand  and  pricing  of \nlivestock, resulting in fair returns to smallholders. \n \nLimited access to financial services is a risk that may limit the full \nrealization  of  benefits  to  the  poor  from  improved  productivity. \n\n\f \n\nvii\n\nAccess  to  investment  funds  is  essential  for  production  and  risk \nmanagement.  Improvements  in  land  use  planning,  particularly \nownership  rights  for  ethnic  minority  communities,  along  with \nimproved  access  to  financial  services  under  the  Project,  will \nensure  sustainable  gains  to  the  beneficiaries.  Highly  pathogenic \navian  influenza  (HPAI)  is  not  expected  to  be  a  risk  in  hilly  and \nthinly  populated  areas  of  the  Project.  Improved  management  of \nsmallholder poultry is expected to improve biosecurity and reduce \nany risks of avian influenza. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f(cid:49) (cid:48)(cid:111)\n(cid:49)(cid:48)

\n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nPoverty, Agriculture and Livestock \n\n2.  \nLack  of  access  to  adequate  productive  resources,  culturally  appropriate  livelihoods \nsupport,  and  weak  links  with  markets  lead  to  the  absence  of  sustainable  livelihoods2 for  the \npredominantly ethnic populations in northern Lao PDR. Sustainable livelihoods imply access to \ncapital, resources, and capabilities, which together provide individuals and households with food \nsecurity and resources to meet their present and future needs, increase well-being, and reduce \nvulnerability to sudden shocks that may lead to poverty and deprivation. By improving livestock \nproductivity,the  proposed  Project  aims  to  address  some  of  the  key  constraints  faced  by  poor \nupland communities, women, and other disadvantaged groups, in improving the sustainability of \ntheir livelihoods in 18 of the priority poor districts located in five northern provinces. \n \nLao PDR is one of the poorest countries in Asia, with 31%3 of all households assessed \n3.  \nas \u201cpoor\u201d. Steady economic growth of approximately 5% per annum has been maintained since \n2000,  reducing  overall  poverty.  However,  the  level  of  rural  poverty  is  high  (on  average  about \n52.5%)  in  the  northern  region,  and  is  significantly  higher  than  urban  poverty.  Rural  poverty  is \ncharacterized by a lack of sustainable livelihoods (vulnerability to food shortages, reduced ability \nto meet family subsistence requirements, low levels of asset formation, and low education and \nhealth levels), and is mainly found in upland areas of the northern provinces, among the largely \nethnic  population.4 The  upland  ethnic  communities  have  gradually  faced  reduced  access  to \nproductive  resources,  including  land  and  forest,  contributing  to  a  growing  lack  of  sustainable \nlivelihoods.  Among  upland  ethnic  groups,  poverty\u2014seen  as  \u201cnew  poverty\u201d\u2014is  measured5 in \nterms  of  declining  rice  sufficiency  (upland  rice  production  has  declined  by  about  30,000 \nhectares  [ha]  per  year  over  the  past  3  years),  and  incomes  that  are  insufficient  to  meet \n                                                 \n1  The  Project  was  prepared  under  ADB.  2004.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Lao  PDR  for  Participatory  Livestock \nDevelopment. Manila (TA No. 4287-LAO). Directed at reducing poverty in the upland areas of the northern region \nof Lao PDR, the Centro Internationale Agricultura Tropicale (CIAT) and International Livestock Research Institute, \nwhich have extensive experience and involvement in livestock development in Lao PDR, undertook the study.  \n2   The sustainable livelihoods framework developed by IDS, Sussex, and adopted by the Department for International \nDevelopment  (DFID)  of  the  United  Kingdom,  puts  people  at  the  center  of  development  and  views  them  as \noperating in a context of vulnerability. It provides a very useful and relevant analytical framework to (i) understand \nthe  multidimensional  nature  of  poverty,  as  defined  by  people  themselves;  and  (ii)  analyze  their  access  to  the \nvarious  types  of  capital  (financial,  physical,  social,  human,  natural)  and  their  ability  to  combine  and  utilize  these \nassets as individuals, households, in ways that may enable them to ensure their access to adequate subsistence \nand  well-being\u2014including  improvements  therein  in  future,  without  undermining  the  natural  resource  base. \nConversely, the absence of any of these can lead to poverty, vulnerability to loss of subsistence, and well-being. \nFor  further  details,  refer  to,  among  others,  Chambers,  R.,  and  G.

Upland  communities \nmeasure relative wealth through their livestock holdings6 although livestock holdings are small. \nAbout  93%  of  villagers  raise  poultry,  74%  of  villagers  raise  pigs,  8%  raise  goats,  31%  raise \ncattle, and 41% raise buffalo. The average number of animals per animal-raising household is 1 \ncow and buffalo, 3\u20134 pigs, and 3\u20135 hens plus their young. The causes of poverty are seen by \nthe  people  as:  (i)  shortages  of  land  for  swidden  cultivation;  (ii) falling  productivity  of  upland \ncultivation,  caused  by  increasing  population  pressures  and  policies  aimed  at  reducing  shifting \ncultivation; (iii) lack of livestock assets; (iv) prevalence of animal diseases; (v) lack of technical \nproduction  and  management  knowledge;  (vi)  lack  of  communications,  both  physical  and  for \ntechnology  and  information  transfer;  (vii)  lack  of  market  access;  and  (viii)  lack  of  capital  for \ninvestment,  among  others.  Given  the  extent  of  poverty  and  regular  incidences  of  food \nshortages,  and  the  diminishing  prospects  under  swidden  cultivation  systems,  the  livestock \nsubsector  can  play  a  critical  role  in  improving  the  sustainability  of  upland  livelihoods.7 It  can \nprovide  a  source  of  food  security  and  nutrition  for  vulnerable  groups,  as  well  as  a  source  of \nincome  in  rural  poor  households.  It  can  help  to  improve  women\u2019s  access  to  improved \nlivelihoods;  increase  food  security;  and  improve  the  nutritional  status  of  vulnerable  groups, \nespecially  children,  young  mothers,  the  elderly,  and  the  sick.  It  can  strengthen  the  overall \neconomic and social position of women in the family and the community.  \n \n4.  \nIn  the  northern  provinces,  livestock  production  has  remained  relatively  static  over  the \npast 10 years. Livestock are an integral part of the assets of most rural inhabitants, with about \n90%  of  all  farm  households  raising  one  or  more  livestock  species.  About  95%  of  all  livestock \ntraded  are  produced  by  smallholders  from  holdings  of  just  over  1  ha  (excluding  communal \ngrazing areas). Livestock rearing and cropping activities are integrated, with livestock providing \ninputs  into  crop  production  such  as  draught  power  for  soil  preparation,  manure  for  soil \nfertilization, and in the transportation of goods. In turn, cattle, buffalo, pigs, goats, and chickens \ngraze  on  recently  harvested  cropped  areas  or  are  fed  by-products  from  rice  milling  for  part  of \ntheir diet. \n \n5.  \nLivestock  production  systems  vary  between  lowland  and  upland  areas,  where  animals \nare  raised  for  different  purposes.  In  the  uplands,  livestock  form  a  vital  part  of  the  rural \nhousehold\u2019s  physical  and  social  capital.  They  are  reared  both  for  draught  power  and  as  a \nsource of manure, and are a vital form of savings.8 In upland areas, livestock are also a source \nof food security, given the ever-present risk of food shortages. Smaller livestock such as poultry9 \nand pigs provide food security to poor households. Livestock production strategies are oriented \ntoward  dealing  with  limitations  imposed  by  low  availability  of  capital,  technical  knowledge  and \nknow-how, and limited household labor. In this scenario, animals graze and forage with minimal \nsupervision and are exposed to predators, disease, theft, and road accidents. However, in spite \nof  all  limitations  imposed  by  the  current  situation,  livestock  production  plays  a  key  role  in \nhousehold income earning; the sale of cattle, buffalo, pigs, and poultry accounts for about 50% \nof annual household cash incomes in upland areas and about 30% nationally.10 \n\n                                                 \n6   Agriculture remains the leading sector of the economy, accounting for 51% of gross domestic product (GDP), while \nlivestock  plays  a  significant  role  within  the  sector  with  36%  of  agricultural  GDP.  The  contribution  of  livestock  to \nagricultural  GDP  has  increased  steadily  over  the  past  10  years  in  response  to  increasing  prices  and  export  and \ndomestic demand. \n\n7  In the participatory poverty assessment (PPA), ethnic groups listed improvement of livestock productivity as one of \n\ntheir top priorities for poverty reduction. \n\n8 There are hardly any formal financial services available. \n9 \u201cSale  of  a  hen  can  help  us  procure  rice  for  several  days\u2019  consumption  by  an  individual.  If  there  is  an  outbreak  of \ndisease, all our assets can be wiped out very quickly. We need to reduce risks of disease in order to safeguard our \nanimal  assets.\u201d  Field  research  conversation  of  the  Fact-Finding  Mission  with  Khmu  women\u2019s  group,  recorded  in \nXieng Khouang Province, 2006. \n\n10 ADB. 2002. Review of the Livestock Sector of Lao PDR. Manila. \n \n\n\fB.  \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nRole of Upland Livestock Production Systems \n\nUnder  upland  farming  systems,  livestock  achieve  low  growth  rates,  are  susceptible  to \n6.  \ninfectious  and  parasitic  diseases,  and  have  low  fertility  rates  that  result  in  low  off-take, \ngenerating  low  household  returns.  Mortality  rates  of  livestock  are  very  high  in  the  northern \nprovinces,11 severely affecting productivity. Given the extent of these communities\u2019 dependence \non livestock rearing and the poor performance of the livestock subsector to date, opportunities \nfor  improving  productivity  and  thereby  the  sustainability  of  upland  livelihoods  are  apparent  in \nterms  of  improving  feeding  and  management  technologies  and  improved  links  with  financial \nservices and markets. \n \n7.  \nIn  the  uplands,  there  is  widespread  familiarity  and  considerable  local  knowledge  in \nrearing livestock, which is part of the rich cultural tradition of the ethnic communities in northern \nLao  PDR.  However,  lack  of  knowledge  of  animal  nutrition,  disease  prevention,  and  improved \nlivestock  management,  among  others,  pose  a  risk  to  improving  the  performance  of  the \nsubsector  and  its  role  in  further  enhancing  rural  livelihoods.  Upland  ethnic  communities  often \nlack  access  to  adequate  financial  resources  which  are  required  to  improve  their  access  to \nlivelihood  assets,  help  them  adopt  improved  management,  and  enable  them  to  invest  in \nadequate  nutrition  and  health  for  livestock.  There  is  a  need  to  develop  flexible  and  culturally \nappropriate financial services that can meet these requirements in a sustainable manner. There \nis  also  a  need  to  support  the  adoption  of  improved  livestock  management  practices  that  are \neffective  while  not  adding  to  the  already  overtaxed  household  labor.  Improved  extension \nservices  need  to  be  developed  with  culturally  appropriate  and  gender-responsive  participatory \nmethods  to  deliver  know-how  and  appropriate  management  practices.  The  situation  is  made \nmore complex by the frequent lack of a working knowledge of the Lao language among upland \nethnic communities. Literacy levels in the Lao language among ethnic groups are low, with even \nlower  percentages  of  literacy  among  women. 12  There  is  a  need  to  support  upland  ethnic \ncommunities, particularly women, with Lao language and numeracy training; translation support \nfor  extension;  and  opportunities  to  participate  in  training,  credit,  and  enterprise  promotion \nprograms.  \n \n8.  \nThe  advantageous  situation  of  Lao  PDR  regarding  regional  integration  in  the  Greater \nMekong  Subregion  (GMS),  with  increased  trade  and  transport  linkages  being  promoted,  can \nprovide  opportunities  for  poor  rural  communities  to  improve  their  incomes  through  increased \nmarket-oriented production and higher prices. Smallholder poultry production has the potential \nto  provide  food  security  and  improved  nutritional  levels  for  poor  households  and  vulnerable \ngroups.  While  smallholder  poultry  markets  tend  to  be  local  ones,  there  is  a  growing  domestic \ndemand  in  urban  centers  for  smallholder  poultry  products,  which  needs  to  be  passed  on  to \nsmallholder poultry producers in the northern region. There is also a growing potential demand \nfor pigs, goat, and cattle from urban areas within Lao PDR as well as in the GMS region. \n  \n9.   With  their  present  limited  access  to  financial,  physical,  social,  human,  and  natural  and \ninformation capital,13 the risks associated with increased livestock production to meet increasing \n\n                                                 \n11 These average approximately 67% for pigs, 16% for goats, 40% for cattle, 20% for buffalo, and 67%  for chicken \n\n(footnote 10). \n\n12 Gender  inequality  is  rife  among  ethnic  groups,  with  almost  80%  of  women  remaining  illiterate.  Girls  assume \nhousehold responsibilities at an early age, which precludes their education and reduces their chances to improve \ntheir livelihoods by learning improved technologies or accessing financial resources and markets. \n\n13 A sixth kind of capital\u2014information capital\u2014has been added to the original list in view of the crucial gaps that can \nbe created by its absence for rural households in terms of their ability to take advantage of improved technologies \nand  opportunities.  See  Odero,  K.  2004.  Extending  the  Sustainable  Livelihoods  Framework.  University  of \nZimbabwe. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\ndemand have been too high for the majority of smallholders. Without a significant change in the \norientation of smallholder production systems\u2014that leads to greater labor efficiency with better \nextension  and  improved  management  techniques,  better  access  to  capital,  reduced  risk  of \ndisease and mortality, and improved market links\u2014the future scenario will mean a continuation \nof  this constrained  and  inefficient  extensive  production  system,  which  neither  guarantees  food \nsecurity  nor  adequate  incomes  from  livestock  rearing.  Conversely,  by  increasing  productivity \nfrom current levels, the development of livestock has the potential to bring about sustainability of \nupland  livelihoods  and  reduce  poverty  significantly.  It  also  offers  one  of  the  few  alternative \nincome-generating  options  for  shifting  cultivators  to  substitute  their  diminishing  returns  from \nlabor-intensive upland cropping activities. It provides a viable option for increasing food security \namong food insecure households and improving the nutritional levels of vulnerable groups. \n \n10.   Reducing  poverty  in  these  uplands,  through  developing  sustainable  rural  livelihoods, \nrequires  improving  the  productivity  of  the  livestock  subsector.  The  upland  ethnic  communities \nare characterized by high levels of poverty, estimated at an average of 68%, with much higher \nlevels in Houaphanh (92%) and parts of Xieng Khouang (62%). These communities are facing a \nlivelihood  crisis.  Given  the  overall  constraints  in  developing  other  livelihoods  activities, \nenhancing livestock production provides upland ethnic communities with a viable opportunity to \nimprove \nlivestock \nproductivity  has  the  potential  to  address  the  four  elements  of  poverty  in  the  uplands: \n(i) increasing  food  security  and  improving  the  nutrition  of  vulnerable  groups,  (ii)  reducing \nvulnerability  of  the  poor  to  sudden  shocks,  (iii)  increasing  smallholders\u2019  assets,  and \n(iv) contributing to the empowerment of women and the poor. \n \n\ntheir  natural  resource  base. \n\nlivelihoods  while  conserving \n\nImproving \n\n2. \n\nThe Government\u2019s Strategy for the Livestock Subsector \n\n11.  \nThe Government recognizes the importance of the livestock sector for poverty reduction \nand achieving commodity diversification in regional trading patterns. One of the key objectives \nof the National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES) is to improve food security. \nThe NGPES14 seeks a multisector approach to poverty reduction and recognizes the pivotal role \nof agriculture in this area. Public investment through development projects has been targeted at \n47  districts  identified  for  priority  investment  among  72  poor  districts  identified  in  the  NGPES. \nThe  Government  has  identified  relevant  initiatives  for  livestock  development  as  part  of  its \nobjective  of  improving  the  food  security  and  nutrition  of  vulnerable  groups,  promoting \ndiversification  of  livelihoods,  and  redressing  the  specific  hardships  of  upland  farming \ncommunities.  These  initiatives  include  strengthening  the  disease  monitoring  capabilities  of  the \nDepartment  of  Livestock  and  Fisheries  (DLF),  supported  by  an  increased  distribution  of \nvaccines, associated with farmer training in their application, and the strengthening of livestock \nextension services, coupled with improved information networks for disease control and market \ninformation.  The  NGPES  also  emphasizes  participatory  planning  for  the  livestock  subsector, \nimproved  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  private  sector  breeding,  production  of  livestock  and \nlivestock  products,  and  improved  market  linkages  for  rural  producers\u2014in  order  to  reap  the \nbenefits of increasing trade. It notes the need for improved availability of financial and physical \nresources  in  upland  areas  to  enable  producers  to  acquire  livestock  assets  and  make  critical \ninvestments in improved feeding, animal health, and livestock management, for better incomes.  \n \n12.   Another  strategic  government  document  relevant  to  livestock  development15 states that \nthe  development  goal  for  the  livestock  subsector  in  the  medium  term  is  \u201cto improve  returns  to \nproducers  and  export  earnings  through  the  environmentally  and  economically  sustainable \nimprovement  of  livestock  productivity\u201d  (footnote  15).  The  Vision  for  Livestock  Development  in \nLao  PDR  to  the  Year  2020  suggests  that  regional  demand  for  livestock  products  provides  an \n                                                 \n14  Lao PDR. 2004.

Vision for Livestock Development in Lao PDR to the Year 2020. \n \n\n\fincentive for development of livestock, where regional and domestic prospects for trade in live \ncattle, buffaloes, and meat are sound.16 Improved smallholder poultry production is expected to \nlead to improvements in food security and nutrition of vulnerable groups. The key constraints to \nlivestock  development  are  identified17 as  low  productivity  caused  by  limited  technical  support \nand feed supplies, low capital formation, and links to markets, and a situation where producers \nare trapped in a system of low inputs and low outputs.18 Incremental productivity is anticipated \nto  come  from  key  investments  in  Government\u2019s  prioritized  program  and  action  plan,  together \nwith improved capacities of technical extension staff and better access to credit.19 \n \n\n3. \n\nLessons Learned and External Assistance to the Sector \n\nLessons Learned from Donor-assisted Projects in Lao PDR. External assistance20 to \n13. \nthe  sector  consists  mainly  of  grant  projects,  providing  capacity  building  and  improved \ntechnologies  for  forage  production,  disease  control  and  monitoring,  extension  and  training, \nmonitoring and evaluation, legislation, and private sector participation. The experience of donor-\nassisted projects indicates that project design should incorporate only proven technologies that \nare compatible with the socioeconomic conditions of beneficiaries. A highly relevant lesson for \nLao PDR, with its limited budgetary resources, is that only those activities that can be sustained \nover  the  long  term  through  an  appropriate  institutional  framework21 should  be  supported.  It  is \nclear  that  project  design  should  not  only  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  government  extension \nnetwork  but  also  develop  associated  private  sector  activities  that  are  expected  to  be  self-\nsustaining where the opportunity arises. In the area of agricultural extension, experience points \nto  the  importance  of  adopting  a  participatory,  pro-poor,  culturally  compatible,  and  gender-\nresponsive approach to change. The approach also needs to be holistic in its assessment of the \nsustainability  of  livelihood  activities  at  the  household  level.  The  experiences  of  the  Lao  PDR \nExtension  for  Agriculture  Project  (LEAP)  assisted  by  the  Swiss  Agency  for  Development  and \nCooperation  (SDC),  the  Livestock  Farmer  Support  Project  assisted  by  the  European  Union \n(EU),  and  the  Forages  and  Livestock  Systems  Project  assisted  by  the  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational  Development  (AusAID),  demonstrate  the  gaps  in  the  knowledge  and  current \npractices of extension staff with regard to participatory approaches, extension techniques, and  \ntechnical skills. \n \n14.   While  LEAP  developed  the  \u201cLao  Extension  Approach\u201d,  which  has  been  successfully \napplied  in  lowland  cropping  systems,  the  LEAP  includes  among  other  aspects,  the  building \nblocks  for  further  development  in  order  to  respond  to    the  needs  of    more  complex  upland \nfarming systems. Project interventions must respond to poor smallholders\u2019 needs and demands \nif new technologies are to be widely adopted. There is also a demonstrated need for culturally \ncompatible rural financial services to support poor smallholders\u2019 access to financial resources. \nWithout  access  to  capital  for  investment  in  breeding/rearing  stock,  critical  production  needs \n(such  as  feed  supplements),  and  animal  health  requirements  (such  as  vaccines),  poor \nhouseholds  will  not  be  able  to  achieve  sustainable  livelihoods  through  livestock  development. \n                                                 \n16 DLF.  1998.  op  cit.Protein  consumption  levels  are  estimated  to  increase  from  22  kilograms  (kg)  per  capita  per \n\nannum in rural areas (33 kg in urban areas) to 50\u201370 kg per head per annum by 2020. \n\n17 DLF. 1998.

Changes  were  proposed  to  these  under  the  Lao  European  Union  project  that  provided \nassistance in drafting a revised veterinary law in 2002. The draft veterinary law has been approved by the Council \nof Ministers and is awaiting consideration by the National Assembly. \n\n20 Appendix  5  contains  a  detailed  review  of  externally  aided  projects  that  are  not  included  in  the  memorandum  of \n\nunderstanding (MOU). \n\n21 The approach to the institutional framework to be adopted for improved livestock subsector performance, as  well \nas under this proposed Project, is based on the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (2005), wherein it is agreed \nthat  \u201cdonor(s)  will  base  their  overall  support  on  receiving  countries\u2019  national  development  strategies,  institutions \nand procedures\u201d. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nRural  poor  households  require  access  to  flexible  financial  services,  physical  and  enhanced \nsocial  capital,  which  facilitate  participatory  decision  making  by  borrowing  households,  to \nimprove their livelihoods in a sustainable manner.  \n \nLessons from the ongoing Oudomxay Community Initiatives Support Project22 show the \n15. \nimportance  of  (i)  flexibility  of  design;  (ii)  building  the  technical  and  financial  capacity  of  village \nhouseholds,  formed  into  groups  for  self-management;  and  (iii)  the  timely  combination  of \ntechnical  training,  extension,  and  microfinance  to  support  poverty  reduction  in  a  sustainable \nmanner. The project also demonstrates the impacts of (i) support to smaller livestock production \non the poor, and the (ii) significance of reliance on the village revolving funds groups in terms of \npromoting  sustainable  and  transparent  financial  systems.  The  role  of  management  and \nmonitoring support from government line departments and project staff is critical to ensure the \nsuccess  of  the  interventions.  Project  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  PBME  is  critical  to \nmonitor project outcomes regularly against representative indicators, including assets structures \nand nutrition levels, in order to take corrective actions within the project.  \n \n16.    ADB  highlighted  the  significance  of  the  livestock  subsector  for  the  livelihoods  of  ethnic \ngroups  in  Lao  PDR  through  the  PPA  i.e.  (footnote  5).    In  2005,  ADB  conducted  the  Sector \nAssistance Program Evaluation (SAPE) for the Agriculture and Natural Resources Sector in Lao \nPDR,23 which  pointed  to  the  diffused  nature  of  ADB  assistance  in  the  agriculture  and  natural \nresources sector in Lao PDR. The SAPE made the following recommendations, among others: \n(i) the need for greater selectivity of sectors for ADB participation, in terms of composition and \nspread, (ii) the need to reflect government priorities, (iii) the division of roles and responsibilities \namong  development  partners,  (iv)  the  need  for  strategic  partnerships  with  other  development \npartners,  (v)  the  past  performance  of  ADB  supported  projects  and  comparative  advantages  of \nADB  and  the  skills  mix  requirements.  The  Government  has  taken  these  recommendations \npositively  and  the  Project  is  designed  to  address  concerns  identified  by  the  SAPE.  The \nGovernment also recognizes the key role played by ADB in providing direction to the livestock \nsubsector  through  its  policy  and  strategic  papers.24 The  Project  has  been  included  as  a  firm \nproject in ADB\u2019s pipeline for Lao PDR since 2004. \n \n17.   ADB\u2019s Medium-Term Strategy II (2006\u20132008) points to the need for greater selectivity of \nsectors  for  ADB  participation  and  forging  partnerships  with  other  development  partners  to \nincrease knowledge-based project design and implementation\u2014in order to improve the chances \nof  greater  success  and  sustainability  of  project  outcomes.  It  also  points  to  the  need  for \npartnership  with  other  knowledge  institutions  in  order  to  increase  the  relevance  of  project \ninterventions,  greater  sustainability,  and  mutual  learning.  The  Project  is  partnering  with  SDC \nand  IFAD,  which  have  extensive  experience  in  designing  and  implementing  sustainable  pro-\npoor  livelihoods  projects  in  Lao  PDR  and  the  region\u2014concentrating  on  livestock  components \naimed at reducing poverty, and improving the food security and nutrition of the poor. The Project \nis strengthened by the ongoing ADB ( 2004) Technical Assistance for (the) Capacity Building for \nSmallholder Livestock Systems,Manila (TA 4406-LAO) approved on 4 November 2004) which is \nbeing implemented by the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), an institute of the \nConsultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), at its Asia headquarters in \nVientiane. 25  CIAT  is  implementing  the  TA  with  DLF,  training  selected  staff  from  the  five \nProvincial  Agriculture  and  Forestry  Offices  (PAFOs)  and  six  District  Agriculture  and  Fisheries \n                                                 \n22 Supported by IFAD, Government of Belgium, Government of the Lao PDR, and World Food Program. \n23 Operations  Evaluation  Department,  ADB.  2005.

The Project will also draw on the ongoing regional technical assistance \nfor the Control of Transboundary Animal Diseases in the GMS.26 \n \nLessons  Learned  from  Projects  Assisted  by  ADB  and  IFAD  elsewhere  in  the \n18.  \nregion. Lessons learned from ADB projects in the livestock subsector in the Asia-Pacific region \nillustrate  the  need  to  adopt  participatory,  poverty-focused,  gender-sensitive  project design  and \nstrategies.  Recent  ADB-assisted  projects  that  have  been  highly  successful  in  the  livestock \nsubsector  include  the  Bangladesh  Participatory  Livestock  Development  Project  and  the  third \nNepal Livestock Project. These projects demonstrate positive impacts on poverty reduction and \nwomen. They have had clear objectives and strategies centered on the needs and capabilities \nof  the  poor  and  women,  and  build  on  their  strengths  and  capacities.  Lessons  from  earlier \nprojects  point  to  the  need  to  (i)  avoid  top-heavy,  unsustainable  implementation  structures; \n(ii) advocate  rational  and  sustainable  approaches  to  management  structures,  staffing  levels, \nstaff  deployment,  and  staff  management;  and  (iii)  ensure  better  project  design,  which  should \nreflect  the  Government\u2019s  priorities  and  a  realistic  assessment  of  the  capacity  to  adopt  and \nimplement suggested strategies.  \n \n19. \nThese  projects  have  demonstrated  a  clear  need  for  strong  and  sustained  government \ncommitment toward institutional change and development as well as ADB\u2019s continued support \nfor project administration and supervision on a regular basis. The lessons illustrate the need for \nclose cooperation  with development  partners.  In  instances of  cofinancing,  they  emphasize  the \nneed  for  harmonized  project  management,  supervision,  and  appropriate  and  timely  fielding  of \nconsultants  and  TA  inputs.  Most  importantly,  they  demonstrate  the  clear  role  for  participatory \nfarmer/producer  organizations;  gender \napproaches; \nresponsiveness;  partnership  with  the  private  sector,  NGOs,  and  mass  organizations;  and  a \nsystems approach. Lastly, they emphasize the need for incorporation of strong PBME from the \noutset  to  help  the process  of  learning  and  adaptation,  and  provide  a solid  basis  for  assessing \nthe  impacts  of  projects,  according  to  objectives  and  indicators  adopted  in  the  project.  These \nlessons  have  been  discussed  with  the  Government  and  reflected  in  the  design  and \nimplementation arrangements adopted under the proposed Project. \n \n\nimportance  of  promoting \n\nthe \n\n4. \n\nComparative Advantages of the Northern Region \n\n20. \nLivestock enterprises are important livelihood activities in upland rural areas, and have \nthe potential to improve the sustainability of household incomes and reduce poverty. Given the \nlow population densities, small farms, mountainous terrain, and poor infrastructure, smallholder \nsystems are more suited to livestock development. There are opportunities to increase animal \nproductivity  in  the  uplands  significantly  by  building  upon  established  technologies  in  livestock \nnutrition,  improved  rearing  and  management  practices,  increasing  market  orientation,  and \npromoting  access  to  services  and  markets.  A  good  starting  point  is  the  inclusion  of  smaller \nlivestock\u2014including  poultry,  pigs,  and  goat  rearing\u2014which  can  include  poor  households \neffectively.  Participatory  strategies  and  flexible  financial  services  can  enable  resource-poor \nhouseholds to move to larger livestock eventually. This can be done through the dissemination \nof technical know-how and extension support, village-based revolving funds for microcredit, and \nmarketing support strategies. Such gains in livestock productivity and incomes can be achieved \nby  building  the  capacity  extension  workers  through  training  in  improved  technologies,  and \n\n                                                 \n26 ADB  2004.

Domestic  consumption  of  meat  and  livestock  products  (including  poultry  products)  is \nincreasing, particularly in urban areas. Export markets for buffalo, cattle, goats, and black pigs \nare  growing  in  neighboring  countries.  Opportunities  for  trade  in  livestock  are  expected  to \nincrease with the development of regional road networks throughout the GMS, several of which \ncut across northern Lao PDR, and regional trade and transport agreements. To address these \nemerging  market  opportunities,  upland  livestock  systems  must  become  more  productive  and \nefficient. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n22. \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  contribute  to  improved  sustainability  of  livelihoods  for \nupland  smallholders  in  northern  Lao  PDR.  The  immediate  outcome  is  to  improve  livestock \nproductivity  and  profitability  under  integrated  upland  farming  systems  through  (i)  enhanced \nproductivity of village livestock systems, (ii) capacity building for community driven development \n(CDD),  and  (iii)  support  for  implementation  management.  The  Project  will  contribute  to \nsustainable livelihoods through improved cash incomes, food security, and nutrition for some of \nthe poorest segments of the population. It will achieve this by providing access to appropriate  \ntechnology,  management and marketing systems, rationalizing household labor requirements, \nand  improving  returns  to  labor.  It  will  contribute  to  gender  equity  by  providing  upland  ethnic \nwomen  with  opportunities  and  support  to  participate  in  the  selection  and  implementation  of \ncommunity and household investments in livelihoods improvements. It will provide literacy in the \nLao  language,  and  numeracy  training.  It  will  support  organization  of  village  communities  into \nsmall groups, training in credit management, and technical training in livestock rearing. Women \nwill  participate  equitably  in  all  training,  group  formation,  and  activities  aimed  at  improved \nthe \nextension,  production,  and  marketing.  Environmental  benefits  are  expected \nstabilization of shifting cultivation, improved hygiene, introduction of cut-and-carry systems, and \nenvironmental  health\u2014through  waste  management,  disease  control,  and  controlled  animal \nmovements. \n \nB.     Project Outputs \n\nfrom \n\n23. \nTo  achieve  the  outcomes  of  sustained  livelihood  through  livestock  development,  three \noutputs are proposed: (i) enhanced productivity of village livestock systems; (ii) capacity building \nfor  community  driven  development  (CDD),  and  (iii)  implementation  management.  The  first \noutput  is  further  disaggregated  into  the  essential  elements  required  to  achieve  improved \nincomes  from  livestock  production,  including:  (i)  on-farm  livestock  productivity,  (ii)  market \nlinkages  and  enterprise  development  to  support  livestock  rearing,  and  (iii)  an  enhanced \nparticipatory  extension  network.  Designed  in  this  manner,  the  constraints  identified  above  can \nbe  addressed  within  the  framework  of  a  livelihood  approach,  which  addresses  the  need  for \nimproving production skills among poor smallholders, helps develop closer market linkages so \nthat  farm  gate  price  signals  reflect  the  growing  demand  for  livestock  products,  provides  new \nincentives  for  the  adoption  of  improved  production  technologies,  develops  extension  workers\u2019 \nskills  to  facilitate  change  among  poor  livestock  producers,  and  resources  extension  activities. \nThe  second  output  is  directed  at  enhancing  capacity  of  upland  communities  for  CDD  through \nparticipatory mobilization and organization of community-based groups for production, revolving \nfunds, and infrastructure development. The third output addresses implementation management \nof a multifaceted project, involving the cooperation of a number of government agencies, village-\nbased producer/revolving fund groups,  and private organizations and individuals. \n \n\n \n\n\fa. \n\n Enhanced Village Livestock Systems \n\n24. \nActivities proposed here will be funded by the ADB loan, ADF IX grant, SDC grant, and \nIFAD loan. The activities identified here seek to change the current perspective of low input-low \noutput systems, making smallholders more market-oriented. Such a change requires persistent \nguidance given the long tradition prevalent among upland ethnic communities, of risk-reducing \nupland  farming  systems,  and  requires  a  problem-solving  approach  to  introduce  proven \ntechnologies to modernize production systems. \n \nProductivity Initiatives. The Project will through the first part of its outputs: (i) improve \n25. \ngrowth of larger livestock through the introduction of forages from contracted nurseries (initially \n2 ha per district) supported by the Project; supply seed and planting material; provide training in \nforage  establishment,  management,  and  feeding  to  livestock;  and  develop  other  animal  feed \nsources;  (ii)  improve  livestock  survival  through  better  management  of  livestock  movements, \nimproved  disease  monitoring,  and  support  for  emergency  vaccinations  (together  with  the \nongoing regional technical assistance project for the Control of Transboundary Animal Diseases \nin  the  GMS  i.e.  (footnote  27),  and  the  EU-funded  Livestock  Farmer  Support  Project); 27 (iii) \nimprove livestock productivity through smallholder training and demonstrations using equipment \nsupplied by the Project; (iv) improve the access of poor livestock rearers, particularly women, to \nimproved smallholder poultry and piggery production and management techniques, and improve \nbiosecurity  measures  to  control  livestock  disease\u2014by  building  on  the  lessons  of  past  and \nongoing  projects;  and  (v)  improve  small  and  large  livestock  management  practices  through \nfarmer  training,  demonstrations  of  livestock  management  (exclusion  techniques,  fencing,  and \nbreeder management) using equipment and materials  provided by the Project. Small livestock \nproduction  will  be  used  as  a  strategy  to  include  resource-poor  households  in  the  Project. \nTraining  will  be  provided  to  women  in  particular  in  improving  feeding  and  management  of \nsmallholder poultry and piggery by providing supplementary feeding, improved housing, and use \nof  exclusion  techniques  for  smallholder  poultry  stocks.  These  measures  will  be  essential  for \nlivestock productivity gains and will act as insurance against disease, as biosecurity measures \ncan help to reduce the risk of infection considerably. Productivity increases in smaller livestock \ncan  also  help  to  significantly  improve  the  incomes  and  nutrition  of  vulnerable  groups  among \nupland communities.28 Women poultry workers will be trained and deployed at village level. The \nProject  will  support  village  revolving  funds,29 to  be  channeled  through  village-based  socially \nhomogenous  revolving  fund  groups.  This  will  primarily  support  the  access  of  the  poor  and \nwomen  to  improved  livelihood  assets.  Potential  borrowers  organized  in  groups  will  undergo \ntraining in improved livestock rearing and management, credit, and savings programs. They will \ndecide on the purposes for their borrowings in their groups. They will prepare business plans, \nwhich will be vetted by the groups and community facilitators30 prior to being funded. They will \nundertake  a  savings  programs  for  at  least  9  months  before  becoming  eligible  to  borrow  from \nproject funds. The Project will support continued monitoring and technical backstopping of these \nrevolving funds through consulting services contracts with district teams at local level. Detailed \nguidelines for the village revolving funds are in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n\n                                                 \n27 Houaphanh is not included in the EU project. \n28 ADB.  2004.

Based  on  approved  business  plans  from  the  village  groups,  funds  will  be  released  for \ndisbursement to the groups. All groups will be provided with safe deposit boxes for savings and loan repayments to \nbe  stored  prior  to  deposit  in  district  bank  accounts.  The  service  providers  will  submit  accounts  to  MOF  for  funds \ndrawn by them. The Committee on Investment and Planning has developed guidelines for such funds, which form \nthe basis of these guidelines. Guidelines for these funds are in Supplementary Appendix C.  \n\n30 To be appointed by the organizations to be contracted to promote village household based groups. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n26.  Market Linkages and Enterprise Development. The second part of Project outputs will \n(i) improve market efficiency and enterprise development by promoting input supply businesses \n(feed, inputs, veterinary products, breeders etc.). (ii) It will support the establishment of private \nlivestock  trading  farms  at  critical  markets  and  border  crossing  points  to  assist  farmers  with \nexport-oriented  development,  supply  local  breeders,  and  develop  contract  supply mechanisms \nwith  smallholders.  (iii)  The  Project  will  also  support  smallholder  group31 marketing  activities  to \nimprove  farm  gate  returns  for  livestock;  (iv)  provide  increased  bargaining  power  to  producers \nand  improved  efficiencies  in  marketing;  and  (v)  contract  appropriately  qualified  institutions32 to \nprovide  group  marketing  support,  among  others,  and  promote  small  enterprises  in  rural \ncommunities.  (vi)The  Project  will  promote  farmer  and  trader  contacts  through  workshops  at \nmarket  centers;  (vii)support  market  studies  and  surveys,  farmer  study  tours;  and,  (vii)  in \ncooperation  with  the  EU  Livestock  Support  Project,  support  upgrading  of  selected  existing \nmarket  centers  used  by  large  numbers  of  villages\u2014in  order  to  promote  livestock  quarantine, \nhealth checks, and certification for export, among other initiatives. Microenterprises, which are \nlargely  likely  to  be  women\u2019s  enterprises  (including  local  feed  production  and  sale,  egg  sales, \nchick sellers), will be supported through the village revolving funds for improved income earning. \nThe Project will fund small village infrastructure to improve links with markets, reduce household \nlabor  requirements,  and  improve  returns  to  labor.  These  may  include  among  others  the \nrehabilitation or establishment of essential transport, water supply, and other small-scale village \ninfrastructure  (e.g.,  gravity-fed  water  supplies);  and  improve  market  access  (pathways  and \nbridges).  Women  will  be  fully  involved  in  decision  making  regarding  funding  of  investments  in \nvillage  infrastructure  improvements.  Detailed  guidelines  on  village  infrastructure  funds  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix D. \n \nParticipatory Extension Network. The Project will support the Government\u2019s extension \n27. \nservice through capacity building, and by providing the resources needed to introduce changes \nto  the  livestock  farming  systems.  It  will  address  gaps  in    technical  skills;  and  develop \nparticipatory,  gender-responsive,  and  culturally  sensitive  pro-poor  extension  techniques  for \nexisting  and  newly  appointed  extension  workers  in  DAFEOs  of  participating  districts  and \nextension  staff  in  the  village  clusters.  Village  women  poultry  workers  will  be  trained  and \ndeployed to provide the first level of support to poultry rearers, who are mainly women and the \npoor.  The  Project  will  adopt  a  problem  solving  approach  to  extension  and  training,  where \nlivestock  producer  groups  will  be  asked  to  identify  constraints  and  opportunities,  and \nexamine/try  a  set  of  interventions  to  address  them.  This  approach  will  provide  extension \nworkers  with  skills  to  interact  with  smallholders,  deal  with  any  species,  and  respond \nprogressively  as  there  is  increased  demand  from  smallholders  for  extension  services.  It  will \ndevelop the technical skills of subject matter specialists in PAFOs that provide support to field \nextension  workers.  Training  will  also  be  provided  in  the  management  of  extension  activities \nthrough a training and peer review process at provincial and district level. \n \n \n   \nThis  output,33 to  be  funded  by  the  SDC  grant,  will  fully  support  the  previous  output  by \n28. \nbuilding  community  capacity  to  identify,  manage,  and  implement  village  investments  for \nimproved livelihoods. The regional office will enter into contracts with Lao Women Union (LWU) \nunits at the provincial and district levels, which will have the necessary skills and experience to \n\nCapacity Building for Community Driven Development  \n\nb. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n31  These  groups  will  be  based  on  the  same  principles  of  social  homogeneity  and  will  be  supported  through \n\nmobilization and training to be included under Project, see paragraph 28. \n\n32 Refer to paragraph 28.  \n33 In the context of the Project, CDD implies the development of socially inclusive community groups with the capacity \nto  select  activities,  technologies,  and  infrastructure  based  on  their  priorities;  and  take  decisions  to  invest  village \nfunds, which will be made available under the Project. The pattern of CDD is based on the NGPES, which calls for \nCDD as a way to allocate resources to priority needs and projects.  \n\n \n\n\f11 \n\nprovide  support  for  community-based  group  formation  in  developing  participatory  procedures \nand  managing  village  revolving  funds.  These  LWU  units  will  be  contracted  to  provide  training \nand  organizational  capacity  building  to  participating  village  communities  for  CDD.  The \ncontracted provincial and district LWU units will be responsible for community mobilization and \nthe  formation  of  community-based  groups  such as  producer  groups  for livestock  management \ntraining  and  extension,  group-based  microenterprises,  marketing  groups,  and  revolving  fund \ngroups,  among  others.  These  community-based  groups  will  be  based  on  self-selection  by \nmembers,  according  to  principles  of  social  homogeneity  and  gender  equity.  Both  women  and \nmen  are  expected  to  participate  fully  in  the  groups,  and  be  trained  in  decision  making  and \nmanagement  of  project  resources  (i.e.,  numeracy,  accounting,  simple  bookkeeping)  to  be \ninvested  at  village  level  (i.e.,village  revolving  funds  and  infrastructure  funds.)  To  set  up  the \nvillage revolving funds, the village based revolving funds groups will enter into contracts with the \nservice  organizations.  The  LWU  units  will  submit  regular  progress  and  financial  reports  to  the \nregional office, provincial coordination committee (PCC), and project steering committee (PSC), \non  the  outcomes  and  sustainability  of  the  village  revolving  fund  program.  Detailed  terms  of \nreference for LWU are in Supplementary Appendix K. \n \n\nc. \n\nImplementation Management \n\n29. \nThe  third  output  will  ensure  efficient  project  implementation  and  management  by \nproviding  resources  to  support  the  management  structure  at  national  and  provincial  levels, \nwhich  will  be  established  within  existing  government  institutions.34 It  will  also  provide  technical \nsupport  services  in  project  management,  monitoring  and  evaluation  (ADF  grant-funded), \nextension training, community development and gender awareness, livestock production, animal \nhealth,  and  livestock  trade  development  (donor-funded).

Given the limited availability of ADB grant for this \nProject,  it  is  proposed  to  use  any  available  grant  to  finance  extension  and  participatory \napproaches.  There  is  sufficient  justification  for  providing  $0.7  million  in  grant  funding  under \nADF IX,  as  Lao  PDR  qualifies  for  the  ADF  grant  program35.  The  ADF  IX  grant  will  be  used  to \nfinance  consulting  services  required  for  capacity  building  in  project  management,  smallholder \npoultry improvements, monitoring and evaluation of project outcomes, and marketing and trade \ndevelopment. \n \nD.   \n \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n \n\nParticipatory Approaches to Sustainable Livelihoods, Social Inclusion, and \nGender and Development \n\n31. \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  stimulate  participatory  development  and  inclusive  social \ndevelopment.  Project  measures  to  address  this  include:  (i)  mobilizing  and  organizing  ethnic \n\n                                                 \n34  The  Appraisal  Mission  for  the  proposed  loan  has  had  discussions  with  the  Government  of  the  Lao  PDR  and \nEmbassy of Japan  in  Lao PDR  with  a view  to preparing  a  proposal  for  possible  financing  by  the  Japan  Fund  for \nPoverty Reduction (JFPR) for sustained capacity building of provincial and district staff and mass organizations in \nproject  management,  pro-poor  livestock  development  approaches,  and  credit  and  savings  management,  among \nother areas. It is also proposed to include the services of a cultural anthropologist as adviser to the regional office \nto advise  on culturally appropriate project approaches to the diverse ethnic groups in the project areas. ADB  will \nprepare the draft proposal for review by the Government and ADB. \n\n35 As per Staff Instructions, memo of DG SPD 16 November 2004, approved by President, up to 50% of total program \n\nassistance to Lao PDR can be provided as grant. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\ngroup smallholders into village-based production and village revolving funds groups for CDD, by \nproviding training and extension, access to revolving credit, mobilizing savings, microenterprise \npromotion,  and  market  orientation;  (ii)  facilitating  improved  access  to  resources  for  better \nmanagement  and  marketing  of  livestock  products;  (iii)  developing  audiovisual  extension \nmaterials in ethnic group languages for radio broadcasts in project areas; and (iv) building the \ncapacity  of  extension  workers  to  develop  social,  gender,  and  cultural  skills  to  enable  them  to \nwork with diverse cultural communities. An ethnic groups development plan (EGDP), which lays \nout  the  objectives  and  strategies  for  their  equitable  participation  in  project  outcomes  and \nimpacts,  has  been  prepared. 36  The  Project  will  develop  appropriate  technologies  and \nmethodologies for training and extension. It will build on the significant ongoing work supported \nby  other  donors,  in  particular  the  LEAP,  adding  additional  features  as  required  for  upland \ncommunities;  and  facilitate  their  spread  through  village-based  training  for  women  and  men \nlivestock  rearers.  It  will  support  the  recruitment  and  training  of  selected  upland  ethnic  staff; \nprovide Lao language training programs, as well as training in numerical skills in upland ethnic \ncommunities, aimed at women, to reduce their gender-based disadvantages and improve their \ncapacity  to  absorb  new  technology.  It  will  work  with  LWU  and  other  suitable  organizations  to \ndevelop  gender  sensitivity  and  participatory  approaches  at  all  levels,  starting  from  village \ncommunities.  It  will  organize  upland  ethnic  women,  among  others,  into  village  revolving  fund \ngroups  and  producer  groups\u2014for  improved  access  to  training  and  extension,  market \ninformation,  and  better  returns  from  livestock  production.37 Attention  will  be  paid  to  women\u2019s \nparticipation in training, extension, and revolving funds.  \n \n32.   Gender  action  plan.  This  addresses  particular  gender-based  disadvantages  faced  by \nethnic women in poor upland communities in improving their livelihoods. It tries to address these \nby including the following: (i) progressively increasing participation of women in all village-based \ntraining  programs  for  livestock  production  improvements,  especially  programs  aimed  at  small \nlivestock  production  and  management;  (ii)  village-based  Lao  language  training  and  numeracy \ntraining  programs  to  overcome  their  initial  disadvantage;  (iii)  women\u2019s  participation  in  the \nmanagement and operation of village-based revolving funds; and (iv) women\u2019s access to village \ninfrastructure  funds  for  drudgery  reduction  and  improved  returns  to  their  labor.  Gender  and \ndevelopment  training  will  be  provided  to  staff  of  the  Implementing  Agency  and  all  project \nentities. Further details are provided in Appendix 12. \n \nE.  \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n33. \nThe  total  Project  cost  is  estimated  at  $18.4  million,  comprising  $11.8  million  for \ninvestments in the Enhancement of Village Livestock Systems; about $3.4 million for Capacity \nBuilding  for  CDD  Component,  about  $0.5  million  for  Implementation  Management,  about  $0.8 \nmillion  unallocated  budget38 and  $0.4  million  for  financial  charges  during  implementation,  as \ngiven  in  Table  1.  The  detailed  cost  estimates  by  Expenditure  Category  and  Detailed  Cost \nEstimates by Financiers are given in Appendix 6 and Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n36 See Appendix 12.  \n37 It is likely that a proposal may be prepared for submission to the JFPR, for support to poor ethnic group women to \nimprove  their  access  to  livestock  resources,  and  other  productive  resources,  and  strengthen  their  social  and \neconomic status. \n\n38 The detailed allocation of $0.8 million will be discussed during the Inception Mission. \n \n\n\f13 \n\nAmountsa \n  \n11.08 \n3.40 \n0.50 \n0.80 \n16.50 \n1.50 \n0.40 \n18.40 \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nImplementation Management \n\n \nBase Costb \n1.

The loan will have a \n32  year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  eight  years,  an  interest  rate  of  1%  during  the  grace \nperiod and 1.5% during principal amortization and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.  The  ADB  loan  will  finance  about  50%  of  total  project \ncosts. The ADF IX grant will provide the equivalent of $0.7 million. SDC will finance a grant of \n$3.5 million and IFAD will finance about $ 3 million loan.  \n \n35. \nThe  Government  will  fund  $1.1  million  representing  about  5.8%  of  the  total  cost.  The \nbeneficiaries are estimated to contribute about $0.8 million to project costs mainly in kind (in the \nform  of  labor,  locally  available  materials),  and  in  contribution  to  savings  associated  with  the \nvillage revolving funds. Based on these arrangements, the financing plan is given in Table 2. \n\nTable 2: Proposed Financing Plan  \n($ million) \n\nSource \nADB Loan \nADF Grant \nBeneficiaries \nSwiss Agency for Development and Cooperation \nInternational Fund for Agriculture and Development \nGovernment \nTotal \n\nTotal\n9.3\n0.7\n0.8\n3.5\n3.0\n1.1\n18.4\n\nPercent \n50.5 \n4.0 \n4.4 \n19.0 \n16.3 \n5.8 \n100.0 \n\n   ADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund, IFAD = International \n   Fund for Agricultural Development, SDC = Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation. \n   Sources: The Government and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n \nG.   \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1.   \n\nProject Management \n\n36. \nThe Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) will be the Executing Agency (EA) of the \nProject.  DLF  will  be  the  overall  Implementing  Agency  (IA)  to  coordinate  the  activities  of  the \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nNational  Agricultural  and  Forestry  Extension  Service  (NAFES)  and  National  Agriculture  and \nForestry  Research  Institute  (NAFRI)  at  the  national  level,  and  the  provincial  and  district \ninstitutions  involved  in  implementation.  A  regional  office,  to  be  responsible  to  DLF,  will  be \nestablished within the premises of the PAFO in Luang Prabang Province to provide overall day-\nto-day  management  and  coordination  of  the  Project.  It  will  be  headed  by  the  national  project \ndirector,  assisted  by  an  assistant  director  and  support  staff,  and  will  form  the  regional  arm  of \nDLF\u2019s existing Project Management Division. The national project director will be responsible for \noverall  project  implementation  and  management.  The  national  project  director  will  coordinate \nwith the provinces and ensure the finalization of project work plans based on DAFEO and PAFO \nwork plans, budgets, and contracts. S/he will be responsible for finalization and submission of \nall progress reports and financial reports to DLF. Five provincial implementation units (PIUs), to \nbe established within the existing Livestock Section of each PAFO, will be set up to coordinate \nimplementation  in  each  province.  The  PIUs  (comprising  existing  Livestock  Section  personnel \nwhere resources are available to perform necessary functions, and possibly supplemental staff \nwhere resources are insufficient), will comprise one provincial coordinator (PAFO director on a \npart-time  basis),  one  full-time  officer  responsible  for  provincial  implementation,  and  the \nnecessary administrative support staff from the PAFO Administration Section. Project activities \nwill be incorporated into annual DAFEO work plans and collated into annual PAFO work plans, \nwhich will be approved by provincial authorities, the PCC, DLF, and subsequently MAF. Due to \nthe  geographic  location  of  the  regional  office,  financial  management  will  be  effected  through \nexisting staff from within the Administrative Division of DLF, who will be appointed to a National \nCoordination  Office  (NCO)  in  Vientiane.  The  NCO  will  undertake  coordination  regarding  fund \nflows  and  financial  reporting  to  the  Ministry  of  Finance  in  order  to  facilitate  ADB,  IFAD  loan \nwithdrawal and replenishments. In keeping with the push to harmonization of donor support with \nreceiving  countries  national  development  priorities,  institutions  and  procedures 39 ,  Project \nmanagement  structures are  designed  to  work  within  existing  institutional  structures  of  national \nand provincial administrations to ensure sustainability after project completion. \n \nThe  regional  office,  headed  by  the  national  project  director,  will  work  under  the  overall \n37. \ndirection  of  the  national  PSC,  which  will  comprise  representatives  from  NAFES,  NAFRI,  the \nministries  of  finance  and  foreign  affairs,  and  governors\u2019  representatives  from  participating \nprovinces.  The  PSC  will  meet  on  a  semiannual  basis  or  as  required  to  approve  and  review \nannual project work plans and implementation progress; and advise on any outstanding issues. \nIt  will  receive  consolidated  progress  reports  and  financial  reports  from  the  national  project \ndirector. The Government will invite the participation of donors (ADB,SDC and IFAD) in the PSC \nas it deems fit. At the provincial level, PCCs convened by the provincial vice governors, drawing \nmembership  from  relevant  provincial  departments,  mass  organizations,will  meet  quarterly  and \napprove  annual  PIU  work  plans  and  budgets  (incorporated  in  the  PAFO  work  plans),  review \nimplementation, and guide provincial activities.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period  \n\nto  setting  up \n\nThe  implementation  period  will  be  6  years  from  2006  to  2012.  The  first  year  will  be \n38. \ndedicated \nthe  necessary  management  systems\u2014including  procurement, \naccounting, disbursement, and performance monitoring and evaluation\u2014and lay the foundation \nfor project implementation. An implementation schedule is in Appendix 8. Project activities will \ncommence in one target district per province. The Project will be implemented in phases, at first \nin districts with close proximity to where forage technologies were fostered under the Forages \nand  Livestock  Systems  Project  (para.  13)  and  where  trained  extension  workers  have  been \nprepared  under  the  Capacity  Building  for  Smallholder  Livestock  Systems  TA.40 There  will  also \n\n                                                 \n39 Refer to Rome Declaration on Harmonization.

Vehicles, equipment,  materials,  and  services \nwill be procured by national competitive bidding (NCB) as the cost is valued from the equivalent \nof $100,000\u2013$500,000. Civil works comprise small contracts not exceeding $100,000, typically \nfor  building  renovation  and  construction  of  district  and  provincial  office  buildings  as  well  as \nsmall-scale  infrastructure.  As  such,  civil  works  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  NCB \nprocedures  among  private  local  contractors  acceptable  to  ADB.  Where  there  are  few  local \nsuppliers, equipment, materials, or services valued at less than the equivalent of $100,000 may \nbe procured by shopping, as will be the case for negotiated community facilitation contracts with \nappropriate individuals or organizations. Supply of veterinary medicines and vaccines must be \naccompanied  by  quality  guarantee  certificates.  Supply  of  planting  material  and  breeding  stock \nfor smallholders will be procured by shopping with due consideration for quality assurance. The \nproject  procurement  plan  is  in  Appendix  7  and  final  details  will  be  determined  during  project \nimplementation as appropriate. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nThe  Project  will  fund  a  total  of  64  person-months 41 of  international  consultants  and \n40. \n40242 person-months  of  national  consultants  in  both  short  and  long-term  assignments  to  be \nrecruited  through  a  firm.  The  level  of  consulting  services  identified  under  the  Project  is \nconsidered  essential  in  view  of  the  limited  human  resource  capacities  and  technical  expertise \navailable  in  the  Government  at  central,  provincial,  and  district  levels.  Consultant  services  are \nrequired to reorient extension workers to adopt a more participatory approach in understanding \nsmallholder  problems  and  needs.  This  is  necessary  for  extension  workers  to  become  more \nrelevant  change  agents  in  the  diverse  upland  farming  systems,  where  cultural  and  gender \nbarriers often pose a barrier to the adoption of improved livestock management practices. The \nconsultants will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants. Advance action for procurement of consulting services is proposed to minimize any \ndelay  in  commencement  of  project  activities.  A  simplified  technical  proposal  and  quality  and \ncost-based selection (QCBS) will be adopted. \n \n41. \nIn  addition  to  the  above,  national  consultant  services  will  be  provided  to  facilitate CDD \nthrough  village  based  initiatives  to  train  communities  in  group  formation,    the  operation  and \nadministration  of  revolving  funds,  and  to  promote  increased  market  awareness  and  small \nenterprise development. While DAFEO staff have the potential to develop into effective change \nagents in areas of livestock production, they frequently lack the pro-poor and gender-responsive \nlivelihood development orientation required for community capacity building and revolving funds \nand  small  enterprise  development.  LWU  will  be  directly  selected,  based  on  its  unique \nexperience and outreach into remote villages in the project area. LWU will be the most effective \noption for the kind of work to be done, and will be contracted by the regional office using single \nsource selection (SSS) to provide consultant services under negotiated contracts.  \n                                                 \n41  In  the  fields  of  project  management  and  rural  development  (15  person-months),  rural  poultry  (3  person-months) \nextension  training  (20  person-months),  community  mobilization  (6  person-months),  monitoring  and  evaluation \n(6 person\u2013months), non-specified livestock as required (8 person-months), and marketing and trade development \n(6 person-months).  In  addition,  it  is  proposed  to  include,  under  a  draft  proposal  for  submission  to  the  JFPR,  the \nservices of a cultural anthropologist to advise the Project on culturally appropriate approaches to the diverse ethnic \ngroups in the project area.  \n\n42 Consultant  inputs  are  proposed  in  extension  training  (44  person-months),  rural  poultry  production  (50  person-\nmonths),  and  community  development  and  gender  (33  person-months),  plus  five  provincially  based  extension \ntraining consultants in each province for 55 person-months. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Measures \n\nto  and  discussed  with \n\nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998)  was  explained \n\n42. \nthe \nrepresentatives of the Government of Lao PDR, and the EA. Consistent with its commitment to \ngood  governance,  accountability  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate, \ndirectly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices \nrelating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption \nPolicy are included in the loan regulations/grant regulations and the bidding documents for the \nProject. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include \nprovisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the \nExecuting  Agency  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service  providers  as \nthey  relate  to  the  Project.The  subsidiary  records  of  fixed  assets  and  stocks  will  be  kept  up  to \ndate  and  reconciled  with  control  accounts.  Periodic  physical  inventories  of  fixed  assets  and \nstocks  will  be  conducted.  Except  for  vehicles,  other  assets  will  not  be  sufficiently  covered  by \ninsurance policies. The Project will establish controls and procedures for flow of funds, financial \ninformation,  accountability,  and  audits  to  ensure  that  information  among  the  different  offices \nflows  in  an  accurate  and  timely  manner.  It  will  also  ensure  that  periodic  reconciliations  will  be \nperformed  among  the  different  offices.  The  Project  will  also  advise  employees,  beneficiaries, \nand  other  recipients  to  whom  to  report  if  they  suspect  fraud,  waste,  or  misuse  of  project \nresources or property.  \n\n \n6. \n\n Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting  \n\n \n43. \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  will  establish  two  imprest  accounts  with  the  Bank  of  the  Lao \nPDR on behalf of the Project after loan effectiveness\u2014one for the ADF IX loan and the other for \nthe IFAD loan. Both the imprest accounts will be subjected to the annual audit. The finance and \naccounting  function  of  the  Project  will  be  staffed  adequately.  However,  most  staff  will  not  be \nsufficiently qualified and experienced so the Project will provide training and written guidelines, \nespecially  in  following  ADB  procedures;  and  prepare  written  position  descriptions  that  clearly \ndefine  duties,  responsibilities,  lines  of  supervision,  and  limits  of  authority  for  all  officers, \nmanagers,  and  staff.  The  following  responsibilities  will  be  performed  by  different  units  or \npersons:  (i)  authorization  to  execute  a  transaction;  (ii)  recording  of  the  transaction;  and  (iii) \ncustody  of  assets  involved  in  the  transaction.  The  bank  reconciliation  will  be  prepared  by \nsomeone other than those who approve payments. MAF has developed an accounting system \nthat allows for the proper recording of project financial transactions, including the allocation of \nexpenditures  in  accordance  with  the  respective  components,  disbursement  categories,  and \nsources  of  funds.  The  Project  will  follow  the  system  to  support  the  harmonization  for  projects \nfunded  by  various  international  funding  agencies,  and  update  the  existing  project  financial \nmanual to be applicable for the Project and acceptable to ADB. Monthly and quarterly financial \nreports  will  be  submitted  by  the  EA  to  ADB.  The  accounts  will  be  audited  annually  by  an \nindependent auditor acceptable to ADB and audit reports will be forwarded to the Government \nand  ADB  not  later  than  6  months  after  the  close  of  each  financial  reporting  period to  coincide \nwith  the  Lao  PDR  fiscal  year  (30 September).Monthly  and  quarterly  financial  reports  will  be \nsubmitted  to  ADB.    A  project  completion  report  will  be  submitted  to  the  ADB  within  3  months \nafter completion of the Project. \n \n\nDisbursement Arrangements  \n\n7. \n \n44.  \nTo  expedite  disbursement,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  will  establish  two  imprest  accounts \nwith the Bank of the Lao PDR as stated above in paragraph 43, on behalf of the Project after \nloan  effectiveness\u2014one  for  the  ADF  IX  loan  and  the  other  for  the  IFAD  loan.  The  imprest \naccounts  will  be  managed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and \ndetailed  arrangements  agreed  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  advance  to  be  deposited  to \neach of the imprest accounts will be based on an estimated 6 months of project expenditure or a \n\n \n\n\f17 \n\nmaximum  of  10%  of  the  ADB/IFAD  loan,  whichever  is  lower.  The  Director  of  the  Treasury \nDepartment  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  will  be  the  designated  signatory  to  sign  disbursement \norders based upon official requests from DLF. Ministry of Finance will provide operational costs \nto  the  regional  office  and  the  PIUs  on  a  monthly  basis  based  on  approved  workplans  and \nbudgets. Assuming that conditions for use of the statement of expenditure procedures are met \n43,  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure  procedures  may  be  used  to  reimburse  expenditures  and \nliquidate  the  imprest  accounts  for  all  individual  payments  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of \n$100,000. The imprest accounts will be replenished and liquidated on a monthly basis to ensure \nliquidity  of  funds  or  when  the  accounts  are  drawn  down  by  20%  of  the  initial  deposit.  The \nimprest accounts and statements of expenditure will be audited annually by auditors acceptable \nto  ADB.  The  coordination  staff  of  the  National  Coordination  Office  set  up  at  the  DLF,  the \nregional  office,  and  five  PIUs  will  need  further  training  in  financial  management  and  ADB \nprocedures.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  will  operate  the  imprest  accounts  for  project-related \nexpenses in accordance with an annual work plan to be prepared by the regional office and/or \nDLF and approved by the PSC, and in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. \nThe ADF IX grant and the SDC grant will be disbursed by ADB in agreement with development \npartners  and  the  EA 44 .  Further  details  on  the  financial  management  of  the  Project  are  in \nAppendix 10 and Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n8. \n\n45.   Project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  undertaken  for  each  project \ncomponent  to  ensure  that  project  facilities  are  managed  efficiently  and  benefits  are  realized. \nSupport for designing PBME including local consultant support, will be provided to design and \nestablish  computer-based  BME  procedures.  A  baseline  survey,  including  both  qualitative  and \nquantitative  research,  will  be  undertaken  upon  the  acceptance  of  each  village  entering  the \nProject  for  which  IFAD\u2019s  Result  and  Impact  Management  System  (RIMS)  will  be  used.  The \nRIMS contains two mandatory indicators to measure project impact: (i) a household asset index \n(as  a  proxy  for  poverty),  and  (ii)  malnutrition  among  children  less  than  5 years.  Other  project \nimpact  indicators  may  include  female/male  literacy,  and  access  to  safe  water  and  adequate \nsanitation. There will be repeat surveys at midterm evaluation and project completion, using the \nsame methodology. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n46.  \nThe  Government  and  ADB,  along  with  the  cofinancing  partners  IFAD  and  SDC,  will \nundertake  periodic  project  reviews  (at  least  twice  a  year)  of  the  Project  to  ensure  smooth \nimplementation.  IFAD  will  provide  a  pro-poor  livestock  consultant  for  these  reviews.  CGIAR \ninstitutions including the International Livestock Research Institute and CIAT based in Lao PDR \nwill  be  consulted  from  time  to  time  (footnote  43).  A  comprehensive  midterm  review  will  be \ncarried out to critically review project performance. The midterm review will address the actual \nphysical  and  financial  progress  of  the  Project,  social  and  gender  impacts,  progress  in  the \nimplementation of the EGDP, implementation procedures, procurement performance, as well as \ncompliance with loan covenants, among others. In particular, it will include an assessment of the \nProject\u2019s likelihood of fulfilling its expected outcomes by project completion. \n \n\n                                                 \n43 ADB. 2001.

Poverty Reduction and Sustainable Livelihoods. The Project will impact positively on \nthe  incomes  of  at  least  17,000  ethnic  households  in  408  villages  by  improving  livestock \nproduction  and  marketing.It  will  also  have  positive  impacts  on  household  incomes  of  at  least \nanother  1,500  households  in  additional  250  villages.  Income  increases  are  expected  to \napproximately $1,400 per beneficiary household per annum. At least 50% of all beneficiaries are \nlikely to be poor households that currently suffer from food shortages and lack of cash incomes \nfor  meeting  basic  requirements.  The  Project  will  improve  social  and  human  capital  and,  by \nsupporting  CDD,  will  help  to  create  greater  opportunities  for  participation  in  livelihood \nimprovement  by  sections  that  have  been  marginalized  until  now,  particularly  upland  ethnic \ngroups and women. The Project will develop human capital in terms of production knowledge, \nmanagement practices, extension approaches, among others, at the level of institutions such as \nDAFEO and PAFOs. \n \nThe proportional benefit within the ethnic groups will vary according to their interest and \n48.  \ncapacity  to  assimilate  project  technologies.  Ethnic  groups  will  benefit  from  appropriate \ntechnology transfer, group formation and provision of financial services and village infrastructure \ndevelopment. Women in particular are expected to benefit from training and improved access to \nresources and markets.It will promote socially inclusive development, and address gender gaps \namong  these  communities  for  access  to  resources  and  opportunities.  It  will  facilitate  private \nsector development in livestock production and trade.  Highly pathogenic avian influenza is not \nexpected to be a risk in the hilly and thinly populated areas of the Project.  \n \nB. \n \n49.  \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B.  The  initial  environmental \nexamination  shows  that  the  overall  environmental  impacts  of  the  Project  are  expected  to \ngenerate  substantial  environmental  benefits.  Potential  positive  impacts  include  potential \nstabilization  of  shifting  cultivation  because  of  improved  livestock  productivity  and  resulting \nstability  of \nthrough  waste \nmanagement,  disease  control,  and  controlled  animal  movements.  Since  the  Project  aims  to \nimprove animal productivity from improved inputs and efficient use of land and resources, only a \nsmall increase of livestock numbers is anticipated. Appropriate manure and waste management \nwill reduce the risks of water pollution. Soil and water quality testing will be conducted to monitor \nquality and develop any necessary measures to minimize negative impacts. \n \nC.  \n\nimproved  hygiene  and  environmental  health \n\nEconomic and Financial  \n\nEnvironment Impacts \n\nincome;  and \n\n50. \nThe  Project  addresses  technological,  information,  human  capital,  and  infrastructure \ndeficiencies that prevent the realization of the full potential of livestock farming in the northern \nprovinces of Lao PDR. The project interventions are consistent with the development priorities \nof MAF. The representative livestock models, developed to analyze the financial and economic \nfeasibility,  show  that  pig  and  cattle  fattening  and  goat  and  poultry  breeding  are  financially \nprofitable  for  the  adopting  households.  Proposed  technological  packages  for  each  type  of \nlivestock  either  reduce  or  maintain  the  current  labor  allocation  for  livestock  activities  while \nsignificantly  improving  labor  productivity  and  returns  for  labor.  With  and  without-project \ncomparisons  show  that  the  Project  enables  poor  households  to  come  out  of  poverty \npermanently  by  adopting  new  production  and  management  technologies.  About  50%  of  the \nbeneficiaries  of  the  Project  are  poor  and  most  of  them  belong  to  upland  ethnic  groups. \nSuccessful  implementation  of  the  village  revolving  funds\u2014targeting  the  poor,  women,  and \nethnic  groups  who  do  not  have  initial  capital  to  undertake  livestock  rearing  activities\u2014will \nincrease the percentage of poor benefiting from the Project significantly. \n\n \n\n\f \nThe economic analysis of the Project estimates the net present value at KN27.5 billion at \n51. \na discount rate of 12% over a 25-year period. This indicates that the project benefits far exceed \nits  cost.  Further,  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  estimated  to  be  17.2%,  which  is \nsignificantly  higher  than  the  cost  of  capital.  Sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  these  results  are \nrobust  to  changes  in  the  key  variables  of  delayed  benefits,  increased  costs,  and  reduced \nadoption rates of proposed technologies. The project performance is sensitive to price changes \nof  livestock  products.  However,  in  the  face  of  increasing  demand  for  livestock  and  livestock \nproducts  in  Lao  PDR  and  neighboring  countries,  price  declines  below  current  levels  are \nextremely  unlikely,  particularly  for  large  ruminants.  Overall,  the  economic  analysis  shows  that \nthe proposed Project is a sound investment for Lao PDR that will generate significantly higher \nbenefits than the incurred costs. A summary economic and financial analysis is in Appendix 9. \n \n\nV. \n\nSPECIFIC ASSURANCES \n\nSpecial Assurances \n\nA.  \n \n52.  \nassurances that have been incorporated in the Loan Agreement: \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  also  given  specific \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nOnly suitably qualified organizations and /or individuals will be engaged through \nconsultancy  contracts,  to  provide  capacity  building  and  support  to  upland \ncommunities for CDD. \nThe Project will promote women's participation in village based training programs \nto incorporate approximately half of all trainees. \nThe Project will encourage women's representation and participation in revolving \nfund groups up to at least 50% of all beneficiaries. \nAll implementing agencies will fully comply with the EGDP in keeping with ADB\u2019s \npolicy on indigenous peoples.45 \nAll implementing agencies will ensure that land to be acquired for any small-scale \ncivil works in villages and district centers is clear of occupation and not under any \nuse as defined by ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement.  \nIn  addition,  all  implementing  agencies  will  fully  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  \npolicies related to involuntary resettlement46 and the environment47. \nThe Project will comply with ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy48, particularly in respect \nof  the  sections  of  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  and  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the \nUse  of  Consultants  that  relate  to  fraud  and  corruption.

It  employs  86%  of  the \nworkforce in a population of 5.68 million, of whom 80\u201385% reside in rural areas. An estimated \n627,000  households  are  located  in  rural  areas  (72%  of  the  2002/03  population);2 of  these,  an \nestimated  80%  practice  small-scale,  subsistence  agriculture \nin  diverse  agroecological \nenvironments comprising both irrigated and rain-fed farming systems, the latter by far the more \nsignificant. Within the farming systems, the dominant activity is subsistence rice production. In \nthe south, tree crops and vegetables are grown extensively in the upland plateaus to generate \ncash. In all areas, livestock provide draught power, dietary protein, a store for family wealth (a \nreserve  or  safety  net  in  the  event  of  family  disaster),  and  cash  income  to  pay  for  household \nexpenses. Livestock are also important for ceremonial and social occasions. \n \n2. \nWithin  agriculture,  cropping  is  the  main  activity\u2014contributing  57%  of  agricultural  GDP \ncompared to 36% for livestock and fisheries and 7% for forestry. Cropping is dominated by rice \nwith  2.5  million  tons  produced  in  2004,  2.3  million  tons  (78%)  from  lowland  areas  and  the \nremaining 0.2 million tons from rain-fed upland areas. Some 14% of total rice production comes \nfrom  irrigated  paddy  land.  The  area  of  rice  harvested  in  2004  was  770,300  hectares  (ha),  of \nwhich  10%  comprised  irrigated  paddy  land  and  14%  nonirrigated  upland. 3  Upland  rice \nproduction has declined steadily in response to government policy to reduce shifting cultivation, \ndeclining  by  about  30,000  ha  per  year  over  the  past  3  years.  Other  field  and  industrial  crops \ngrown  include  coffee,  maize,  peanuts,  cassava,  sugar  cane,  and  tobacco,  which  each  have \nplanted  areas  in  excess  of  5,000  ha.  In  addition,  large  areas  are  planted  to  fruit  trees \n(particularly  bananas)  and  other  vegetable  crops.  Lao  PDR  is  now  self-sufficient  in  rice \nproduction for its population, which is increasing by about 2.8% per annum. \n \n\n1. \n\nLivestock Subsector \n\n \n3. \nThe  contribution  of  livestock  to  agricultural  GDP  has  increased  steadily  over  the  past \n10 years in response to increasing prices and export and domestic demand. Cattle, buffalo, and \npig numbers have remained relatively static during that period (Table A4.1). Pig numbers have \ndeclined in the north, mainly in Bokeo and Oudomxay, while numbers in commercial enterprises \nhave  remained  static  at  0.2  million.  Numbers  of  household  poultry  have  increased  from \n15.3 million in 2002 to 18.5 million in 2004 whereas commercial poultry numbers declined from \n1 million to 3 million over the same period, possibly in response to the threat of avian influenza. \nCommercial production units are found on the periphery of urban Vientiane and Luang Prabang \nand other provincial capitals. These intensive units depend almost entirely on imported parent \nand growing stock, feed, and veterinary supplies. \n \nLivestock  production  systems  vary  widely  throughout  the  country  and  between  lowland \n4. \nand  upland  areas  where  animals  are  kept  for  different  purposes,  since  livestock  rearing  and \ncropping  activities  are  integrated  and  complementary  activities.  Livestock  provide  organic \nmanure  (sometimes  composted)  and  draught  power  (mainly  buffalo)  for  soil  preparation  while \ncattle and buffalo are used to transport goods collected from forest areas and produce grown in \nsmallholder plots, to villages and markets. \n                                                 \n1   National  Statistics  Centre.  2003.

Otherwise, uncontrolled grazing and \nforaging  with  minimal  supervision  (the  most  common  practice)  exposes  animals  to  attacks  by \npredators,  disease,  theft,  and  even  death  from  road  accidents.  Over  95%  of  all  livestock  are \nproduced  by  smallholders  from  an  average  farm  size  of  just  over  1  ha.  The  sale  of  cattle, \nbuffalo,  pigs,  and  poultry  accounts  for  about  50%  of  the  annual  household  cash  incomes  in \nupland  areas.4 Therefore,  livestock  enterprises  are  important  livelihood  activities  in  rural  areas \nand have the potential to improve household incomes and reduce poverty. \n \n6. \nMarketing  patterns  vary  between  species,  with  the  smaller  animals  (poultry,  pigs,  and \ngoats) being slaughtered and consumed closer to the area in which they are produced. Large \nruminants  are  walked  or  transported  greater  distances  by  vehicle  to  urban  centers  within  the \ncountry and across borders to People\u2019s Republic of China, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Like the rest \nof  Southeast  Asia,  per  capita  consumption  of  both  red  and  white  meat 5  is  increasing  as \ndisposable  incomes  increase  and  urban  populations  grow.  Export  demand,  particularly  for  live \ncattle  and  buffaloes,  is  increasing  steadily  and  is  currently  estimated  at  100,000  head  per \nannum  in  Thailand  (20%  of  their  live  cattle  and  buffalo  imports)  and  Viet  Nam  across  borders \nwith few controls. There is also a significant unrecorded and uncontrolled trade in animal hides \nand  skins  with  Thailand.  Increased awareness  of  the  dangers  associated  with  live  animal  and \nanimal product trade has focused greater attention on quarantine procedures in Lao PDR, which \n                                                 \n4   ADB.2002.

In  2002/03,  monthly  household  consumption  was  estimated  at \nKN1.1  million.  Food  represented  55%  and  meat  consumption,  both  home-produced  and  purchased,  was  22.3%, \nwhich represented an increase from 16.1% in 1997/98 (Data extracted from LECS III Survey, Chapter 3)  \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\n     Appendix 4 \n\nwill  most  likely  result  in  additional  sanitary  and  phytosanitory  regulations  being  imposed  by \nimporting countries. Lao PDR must respond to these if it is to supply this rapidly growing market \nin the longer term. Livestock marketing is chaotic, with price signals failing to be passed on to \nproducers.  Many  traders  (some  of  them  opportunist)  in  rural  areas  play  an  important  role  in \nlinking producers to domestic and international markets. These links are often corrupted by local \nadministrations  in  their  attempt  to  apply  illegal  controls  to  preserve  the  area\u2019s  breeding  herd \nwhich, at least in the case of large ruminants, they perceive to be threatened by live trade. \n \n\na. \n\nProduction Systems \n\n \n7. \nLivestock  production  is  predominantly  a  smallholder  activity  in  mixed  farming  systems \nwhere  crop  production  and  livestock  rearing  are  integrated  in  complex  ways,  each  making \ndemands  on  the  limited  land,  labor,  and  capital  of  smallholders  as  they  pursue  subsistence \nlivelihood activities. The role of livestock in these farming systems is critical for generating cash \nincomes  and  providing  food  security,  particularly  in  the  resource  poor  upland  households. \nConstraints in the upland production systems are expressed through low growth rates, greater \nsusceptibility to infectious and parasitic diseases (often with high mortalities), low fertility rates, \nlow off-take rates, depressed farm gate prices. These are the outcomes of generally less than \noptimal  use  of  resources  allocated  to  livestock  enterprises,  generating  low  returns  from \nsmallholder  inputs.  About  74%  of  villagers  raise  pigs,  8%  raise  goats,  31%  raise  cattle,  41% \nraise  buffalo,  and  90%  raise  poultry.  Livestock  management  varies  from  extensive  systems \nwhere  animals  are  allowed  to  scavenge  around  houses  in  the  village  and  surrounding  forest \nareas, to partial and even complete confinement in the case of pigs to prevent damage to crops \nor  for  disease  control.  Some  smallholders  keep  their  pigs  outside  the  village  area  where  the \nthreat of disease is lower. Even under partial free range conditions, pig production is very labor\u2013\nintensive, with supplementary feed being collected from forest areas, prepared (usually boiled), \nand fed on a daily basis. Cattle are less labor demanding and animals are often released to the \nforests  for  free  grazing  so  they  remain  away  from  cropped  areas,  only  being  confined  at \nparturition  or  when  animals  are  sick.  Buffaloes  are  grazed  closer  to  the  village  for  draught \npower. Goats and chickens roam the village area at will. \n \n\nb. \n\nSector Performance \n\n \nThe most easily collected and reliable indicator of overall productivity of a flock or herd is \n8. \nthe  mortality  rate.  Less  obvious  are  the  nonfatal  effects  on  production  from  disease  and  poor \nnutrition  on  surviving  females,  which  are  less  capable  of  conceiving  and  carrying  a  calf  while \nsurviving males are also less fertile. Mortality rates have been estimated at 10\u201320% for young \nbuffalo,  5\u201310%  for  young  cattle,  20\u201325%  for  pigs,  and  25\u201335%  for  poultry,  resulting  from \nirregular epidemic disease outbreaks which are common. \n \n9. \nSustained low growth rates, high incidence of disease, and low fertility rates indicate that \nthe sector\u2019s performance has been disappointing, and highlight opportunities for improvement. \nMarket signals of increased demand for livestock products are not being translated into benefits \nfor producers; or, if they are, the risk associated with increasing production to meet this demand \nis  too  high  for  the  majority  of  smallholders  to  respond.  Market  linkages  have  not  been \nsufficiently  developed  to  encourage  smallholders  to  produce  at  levels  that  exceed  their \nimmediate  subsistence  requirements.  In  addition,  incremental  production  is  difficult  to  achieve \nwhen  the  feeding  strategies  used  are  essentially  laissez-faire  (with  the  exception  of  pigs)  and \nlabor  resources  available  in  smallholder  households  limit  smallholder  ability  to  consider \nincreased production. Without a significant change in the orientation of smallholder production \nsystems, the future scenario will be a continuation of this constrained and inefficient extensive \nlivestock subsector. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n                                                                                                     Appendix 4       31 \n\nPerformance  at  the  international  level  appears  more  successful  although  less  well-\n10. \ndocumented  because  of  the  unofficial  nature  of  the  trade.  It  is  clear  that  traders  are  active  in \nsourcing  large  animals  in  the  north  for  trade  with  Thailand  and  Viet  Nam,  to  the  extent  that \nprovincial administrations have decided to restrict the movement of breeder stock because they \nare concerned at the loss of breeding capacity in large ruminant herds. \n \n\nc. \n\nConstraints to Production \n\n11. \nThe  major  constraints  to  increasing  livestock  production  include:  (i)  limited  labor \nresources available in households to collect sufficient supplementary feeding; (ii) incidence and \nfrequency of diseases; (iii) low fertility of breeding animals of all species; (iv) limited smallholder \nknowledge of livestock production and management techniques; and (v) limited access to input \nsupplies, animal health and production services, and markets. \n \n12. \nIn  upland  areas,  smallholders  do  not  always  identify  feed  as  a  major  constraint  in \nimproving  livestock  productivity  despite  the  time  taken  to  herd  animals  to  and  from  distant \ngrazing  areas  and  to  collect  and  prepare  feed  for  confined  animals,  particularly  in  the  dry \nseason.  Poor  nutrition  results  in  poor  animal  production  and  contributes  to  lower  animal \nresistance  to  disease.  The  high  incidence  of  livestock  disease  has  been  attributed  to:  (i)  poor \nnutrition  and  sanitation,  (ii)  uncontrolled  movement  of  animals,  (iii)  movement  of  diseased \nanimals, (iv) lack of correct disease diagnoses, (v) poor access to information on how to control \nand  treat  diseases,  (vi)  restricted  coverage  of  and  ineffective  vaccines,  (vii)  weak  veterinary \nsupport services, and (viii) inappropriate management practices. While there is a great deal of \nexperience  and  local  knowledge  in  rearing  livestock,  management  skills  are  lacking  and  their \nknowledge  of  the  cause  of  disease  and  the  measures  to  protect  against  disease  are \nnonexistent.  Technical  information  is  difficult  or  impossible  to  access  in  the  right  medium  or \nlanguage.  It  needs  to  be  delivered  by  extension  workers  and/or  commercial  interests  who  are \ntrained  in  learning  techniques  and  information  sharing.  Existing  extension  services  are  under-\nresourced  and  has  limited  skills  since  personnel  has  limited  technical  knowledge  of  livestock \nproduction and animal health. \n \n13. \nTwo  aspects  of  market  access  constrain  livestock  development:  (i)  lack  of  physical \naccess imposed by the rugged terrain, and (ii) institutional barriers that interfere with the price \nmechanism  under  free  market  conditions.  While  cattle,  buffalo,  and  even  pigs  can  be  walked \nlong  distances  to  collection  points  on  national  routes  where  lower  transport  rates  apply, \nsmallholders become price receivers after investing time and effort to relocate their animals, and \nare reluctant to make the return journey with unsold animals (usually in poorer condition). Local \nregulations  require  complex  procedures  for  approval  to  move  animals  from,  or  through, \nprovinces that have promoted the establishment of trading cartels, enabling collusive behavior \nwhen dealing with ill-informed producers.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s disease monitoring activities are constrained by limited budgets, and \n14. \nsmallholders  have  limited  capacity  to  pay  for  diagnostic  services  as  they  do  not  see  value  in \nthese services. Difficult terrain leads to poor quality vaccines (no cold chain) being administered \nby  poorly  trained  village  veterinary  workers,  leading  to  a  lack  of  confidence  in  preventative \ntreatments  for  livestock.  The  landlocked  nature  of  the  country  makes  it  difficult  to  enforce \nquarantine  regulations  as  borders  are  extremely  porous,  adding  to  threat  of  the  spread  of \ndisease. The Government is committed to retain domestic production of vaccines, but it is not \ncompetitive  because  of  the  comparatively  low  capacity  so  it  is  a  high  cost  producer.  It  is  also \nconstrained  by  limited  funds  for  its  operation,  which  make  quality  control  difficult  in  spite  of \nattempts to conform to standards of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).  \n\n \n\n\f3\n2\n \n \n \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n5\n \n\ni\n\n \n\n \n\nProject \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE \n\nExecuting Agency  Duration \n\nFunded by \n\nObjectives \n\nArea \n\nMicro-Projects Development \nThough Community \nParticipation \n\nMarch200\n2\u2013\nApril/2007 \n\nEuropean Union \n(EU) \n\nNam Ha Watershed Poverty \nReduction Project \n\nRural Development in \nMountainous Area of \nNorthern Lao PDR \n\nJuly/2005\n\u2013\nJuly/2008 \nJanuary/2\n004\u2013\nJanuary/2\n008 \n\nAsian Development \nBank (ADB) \n$1.5 million  \nGTZ (Partner for \nthe Future. \nWorldwide) \n\nDepartment of \nInternational \nCooperation (DIC), \nMinistry of Foreign \nAffairs (MOFA) \n\nMinistry of \nAgriculture and \nForestry (MAF) \nDIC, MOFA \n\nLong Alternative \nDevelopment Project \n\nMAF \n\n2004\u2013\n2009 \n\nNorwegian Church \nAid (NCA) \n \n\nNam Chouam and Meung \nRural Development Project \n\n2004\u2013\n2009 \n\nNCA \n\nBokeo Provincial \nAgriculture and \nForestry Office \n(PAFO) \n\nProject for Better Livelihood \nof Ethnic Minorities Villages \n\nMAF \n\n12/2003\u2013\n12/2005 \n\nFrance \nEuro 682,500 \n\nSpecial Program for Food \nSecurity \n\nNational Agriculture \nand Forestry \nExtension Service \n(NAFES) \n\n2001\u2013\n2006 \n\nJapan/Food and \nAgriculture \nOrganization (FAO \n$2.6 million \n\nForest Management and \nCommunity Support Project \n\nNAFES \n\n2005\u2013\n2008 \n\nJapan International \nCooperation \nAgency (JICA) \n\n \n\nPoverty alleviation and promotion of \nequitable economic growth through \nsustainable use of natural resources \nand reduced environmental \ndegradation \n\nCommunity development and \nsustainable land use \n\nImprove the economic and social \nliving conditions of the target group \nwith the help of provinces and district \nadministrations in a sustainable \nmanner \n\nTo reduce opium plantation and \ndrugs by improving education, Public \nhealth, agriculture, crop production, \nlivestock, rice cattle and vaccine \nbanks, community training \nDevelop education;

To examine the possible financial and economic impacts of the Project, \na  selection  of  indicative  household  livestock  enterprises  are  examined  comparing  \u201cwithout \nproject\u201d and \u201cwith project\u201d situations to estimate incremental production and income from project \ninitiatives. The \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201c Project increments are extrapolated, based on (i) anticipated \nadoption rates of the technologies, and (ii) the number and size of villages that are expected to \nbe impacted. \n \n2. \nIn the northern Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), smallholders use a wide \nvariety of approaches to raising their livestock. A general characteristic of the present practice is \nthat animal feed is inadequate in quality, if not in quantity. Animals are often allowed to range \nfree  to  find  their  own  food  or,  if  confined  for  a  period,  feed  must  be  found  in  the  forest  and \ncarried back to an animal enclosure. As a result, diet is generally unbalanced and animal health \nand  growth  rates  are  poor.  The  Project  will  introduce  a  package  of  technologies  to  improve \nlivestock productivity, including cultivation of forage to improve animal nutrition, better disease \ncontrol,  better  animal  management  practices  such  as  selection  of  breeding  stock,  better \nhousing, and weaning and culling practices. It can be expected that households which choose \nto adopt project technologies will do so in a variety of ways. Therefore, the indicative livestock \nmodels included in this financial and economic analysis are abstractions from the wide variety of \nexisting livestock management practices and the various ways in which households may adopt \nnew technologies. Four models have been developed for pigs, goats, cattle (representing large \nruminants), and chickens (representing poultry in general). \n \nA. \n\nMethodology \n\n3. \nTo  develop  the  various  livestock  enterprise  models,  certain  assumptions  are  made \nregarding future practice (both \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d the Project) and about the valuation of inputs \nand outputs. In order to assess the Project\u2019s contributions to the economy of Lao PDR, financial \nvalues  have  been  converted  into  economic  equivalents.  Basic  assumptions  for  such \nconversions  include:  (i)  the  use  of  a  domestic  price  numeraire;  (ii)  for  tradable  commodities \n(food  grains  and  fertilizers),  economic  values  are  based  on  border  parity  prices;  (iii)  for  non-\ntraded  goods  and  services,  a  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.9  is  used;  (iv)  for  rural  labor,  a \nshadow wage rate factor of 0.8 is used, reflecting the low productivity of rural labor in the area; \nand  (v)  transfer  payments,  such  as  taxes  and  subsidies,  are  excluded  in  the  calculation  of \neconomic  values.  It  was  assumed  that  the  production  increases  are  not  large  enough  to \nsuppress prices. \n \nB. \n\nIndicative Household Livestock Models \n\n \n\n1. \n\nPig Fattening \n\n \n\nPigs are raised in 77% of rural households in northern Lao PDR.1 While the breeding of \n4. \nfree  range  pigs  is  common,  pig  fattening  is  a  growing  practice.  Building  on  this  situation,  a \nmodel of \u201cwith\u201d versus \u201cwithout\u201d Project pig fattening has been developed. One reason for this \nselection  is  that  it  can  be  accessible  to  the  poorest  smallholders  who  have  limited  means  to \npurchase animals. Such poor households can provide the labor and feed inputs for pig owners \n\n                                                 \n1   From  the  comprehensive  village  data  collected  by  the  District  Agricultural  and  Forestry  Extension  Offices \n\n(DAFEOs), 2003. \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nand  share  in  the  profits.  For  households  that  prefer  to  breed  (rather  than  fatten)  pigs, \nimprovements similar to those for pig fattening can also be expected from forage technologies. \n \n5. \nThe difference between the \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d Project scenarios is due to the increased \nlabor efficiency that enables additional pigs to be reared as well as the shorter period to achieve \nmarketable weights (from 6-12 months). Under the \u201cwithout\u201d Project scenario, the financial gross \nmargin (revenue less cash inputs) is KN0.4 million per year, a return per labor day of KN3,729 . \nIf labor inputs are valued at their market price, net revenue is actually negative. With the Project, \nthe  annual  gross  margin  (includes  two  cycles  of  fattened  pigs)  increases  to  KN4.2 million  and \nthe return per labor day to KN59,802. Net revenue becomes positive at KN3.5 million per year. \nIncremental  household  financial  net  revenue  is  KN4.2  million)  when  comparing  the  \u201cwith\u201d  and \n\u201cwithout\u201d  Project  situations.  In  economic  terms,  incremental  net  revenue  of  this  household \nenterprise  is  KN3.7  million.  Project-wide,  assuming  that  at  full  implementation  13%  of  the \nhouseholds in project villages adopt the improved technology, financial incremental net revenue \nper  year  from  pigs  is  expected  to  be  $1.15 million.  In  economic  terms,  this  annual  increment \nwould be $1.01 million. \n\n \n\n2. \n\nCattle Fattening \n\n \n\nAbout  32%  of  households  in  the  target  districts  raise  cattle  and  43%  raise  buffalo.2 \n6. \nTypically, the animals are allowed to graze freely requiring minimal herding (labor) input. Growth \nis slow and animals are kept well beyond the time when they could best be sold. Cattle, even \nmore than other livestock, are kept more as a store of wealth than as a source of income. Some \nhouseholds, however, are now buying young cattle to hold until they are ready for sale. A model \nof cattle fattening has been selected here for reasons similar to those used in the case of pigs. \nAs with pigs, those households that prefer to breed cattle rather than fatten them should be able \nto  experience  similar  benefit  levels  because  of  the  adoption  of  forage  technologies  and  other \nlivestock management technologies. \n \n7. \nThe difference between the \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d Project scenarios is due to the level of \nlabor  required  to  confine,  feed,  and  water  animals  compared  to  the  current  laissez-faire \nsituation.  Given  the  shortages  of  household  labor,  substitution  is  needed  from  an  alternate \nactivity\u2014assumed to be upland maize cropping\u2014to make labor resources available for fattening \nof  cattle.  The  production  of  forages  also  has  associated  labor  requirements  for  cutting  and \nfeeding  but,  with  the  higher  nutritional  value,  it  is  possible  (i)  to  increase  the  number  of  head \nfattened  from  three  to  five,  and  (ii)  for  market  condition  to  be  achieved  in  12  rather  than \n24 months. A household cattle fattening operation without the Project is likely to have a financial \ngross  margin  of  KN3.6  million  per  year  and  a  return  per  labor  day  of  KN19,946.  Net  revenue \n(including labor costs) would be KN2.7 million. With the Project, gross margin would increase to \nKN11.1  million  and  return  per  labor  day  would  rise  to  KN53,728.  Net  revenue  would  become \nKN9.1  million  per  year.  Incremental  household  financial  net  revenue,  when  including  one \nhectare  (ha)  of  maize  as  an  additional  \u201cwithout\u201d  Project  activity,  is  KN6.2  million  ($605).  In \neconomic  terms,  incremental  net  revenue  for  this  household  cattle  enterprise  would  be \nKN5.5 million ($532). By including an allowance for the  maize that would no longer be grown, \ncattle fattening results in annual incremental net revenue of KN8.8 million ($852). For the entire \nProject,  assuming  that  8.4%  of  the  households  adopt  the  improved  technologies  at  full \nimplementation, financial incremental net revenue per year from cattle fattening is expected to \n\n                                                 \n2   This information is derived from the comprehensive village data collected by DAFEOs in 2005. Many households \n\nraise both cattle and buffalo. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n43 \n\nbe  KN13.4  billion  ($1.30  million).  In  economic  terms,  this  annual  increment  would  be \nKN11.8 million ($1.14 million). \n \n \n\nGoat Breeding \n\n3. \n\n8. \nAt present, 8% of households in the target districts raise goats. Goat rearing is becoming \nmore popular and there are opportunities to increase goat productivity through the introduction \nof  forage  and  other  technologies.  \u201cWith\u201d  and  \u201cwithout\u201d  Project  scenarios  are  based  on  a \nbreeding model in which the number of goats increases under the influence of assumed growth \nrates, mortality rates, and kidding intervals that are achievable given the proposed interventions. \nThe  model  compares  a  4  doe  \u2018without  Project\u2019  breeding  model  with  an  18  doe  \u2018with  Project\u2019 \nmodel. This increase is due to application of the new technological packages together with more \nlabor efficiencies for goat rearing enterprises. \n \n9. \nThe financial gross margin enterprise in the \u201cwithout\u201d Project scenario is KN0.7 million a \nyear (from the second year). The return to labor is KN9,931 per day, which is about the level of \nthe rural wage rate. Including the cost of labor (at the rural wage rate), the net revenue for the \nenterprise  is  about  zero.  \u201cWith\u201d  the  Project,  on  the  other  hand,  gross  margin  per  year  is \nKN4.0 million,  the  return  per  labor  day  is  KN40,829,  and  enterprise  net  revenue  improves  to \nKN3.6  million  per  year.  Annual  incremental  household  financial  net  revenue  is  KN3.6 million \n($352).  In  economic  terms,  incremental  net  revenue  for  this  smallholder  enterprise  is \nKN3.2 million  ($311).  As  is  the  case  for  large  ruminants,  the  models  assume  that  another \nenterprise (maize) will be reduced given the limitations on family labor. When comparing the net \neffect  of  goat  breeding  results  in  financial  terms,  it  is  expected  to  contribute  to  an  annual \nfinancial  incremental  net  revenue  of  KN3.5  million  ($337)\u2014and  economic  incremental  net \nrevenue  of  KN3.1  million  ($303)  per  year.  For  the  entire  project  area,  assuming  that  at  full \nimplementation 3.6% of the households adopt the improved goat breeding enterprises, financial \nincremental revenue per year from goats will be KN2.7 billion ($0.27 million). In economic terms, \nthis annual increment would be KN2.5 billion ($0.24 million). \n \n \n\nChicken Breeding \n\n4. \n\nAlmost all (93%) rural households raise chickens or other poultry, depending on market \n10. \naccess. For the most part, these birds range freely around the village scavenging on whatever \nthey can find. Their numbers are, in part, limited by this scavenging feed resource base, while \noccasional outbreaks of Newcastle Disease and Fowl Cholera temporarily destroy village flocks. \nThe feed utilized is of low quality but has little cost\u2014a very real advantage for poor households. \nGiven the risks involved in raising poultry, significant investment in improving poultry production \nis  probably  beyond  the  means  of  most  smallholders.  As  a  result,  the  Project  is  likely  to \nencourage  the  adoption  of  more  modest  chicken  housing  and  management  techniques,  while \nthe scavenging feed resource base remains the source of feed. \n \n11. \nThe \u201cwithout\u201d Project scenario, with production in 3 out of every 4 years, would generate \nan average  household financial gross margin of  KN0.5 million per year.  Financial net revenue \n(after  accounting  for  the  small  amount  of  household  labor  involved)  would  be  KN0.4 million. \n\u201cWith\u201d  the  Project,  gross  margin  would  increase  to  KN1.1  million  and  net  financial  revenue  to \nKN1.0  million.  Incremental  net  revenue,  then,  would  be  KN0.54  million  ($52)  per  year  in \nfinancial terms and KN0.46 million ($44) in economic terms. Project-wide, assuming that at full \nimplementation 50% of households adopt the \u201cwith\u201d Project poultry management improvements, \nan  increment  in  financial  net  revenue  can  be  expected  to  be  KN6.0  billion  ($0.59 million). \nEconomic incremental net revenue would be KN5.0 billion ($0.5 million). \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nThe  four  representative  models  described  above  show  that  adoption  of  the  proposed \n12. \ntechnological  package  is  financially  profitable.  Therefore,  there  is  adequate  profit  incentive  for \nhouseholds to adopt the proposed technological packages. \n  \nC. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n \n\n1. \n\nAdoption of Project Interventions \n\n13. \nIt has been assumed that smallholders previously raising a particular type of animal are \nmore  likely  to  adopt  new  technologies  than  households  not  previously  raising  that  species.  In \naddition,  a  limit  of  25%  has  been  placed  (in  this  analysis)  on  the  total  of  the  project  village \nhouseholds adopting  any  of  the  larger  animal  (pig,  goat,  or cattle)  interventions.  The  resultant \nfull  population  adoption  of  the  improved  pig  technology  is  13%,  3.6%  for  goats,  and  8.4%  for \ncattle. The adoption rate for the modestly improved poultry technology has been assumed to be \n25%  by  itself\u2014very  possibly  involving  many  or  all  of  the  adopters  of  the  larger  animal \nmanagement improvements. \n \n \n \n14. \nThe  project-wide  incremental  economic  benefits  of  the  household  adopters  of  the  pig, \ngoat,  cattle,  and  chicken  improved  technologies  (Table  A9.1)  can  be  aggregated  and \nextrapolated  through  the  years  of  expected  project  life  to  create  a  benefit  cash  flow  These \nincremental  benefits  increase  over  the  first  several  years  as  extension  worker  capacities  are \ndeveloped and new villages are introduced to the Project, and the adoption of new technologies \nextends within existing villages. \n \n\nProject Benefits \n\n2. \n\nTable A9.1: Financial and Economic Benefit Estimates \n\n \nLivestock Holding Statistics \n\nProportion of HHs with animals a \nAverage number of animals per HH with animalsa\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n           Poultry          Pigs          Goats          Cattle \n\n93%\n15.5\n\n77%\n3.7\n\n9% \n3.9 \n\n32%\n3.4\n\nFinancial Incremental Returns per Household for Indicative Animal Enterprises (Kip)\n\nEconomic Incremental Returns per Household for Indicative Animal Enterprises (Kip)\n\nHouseholds previously raising a type of animal\nIncremental Net Revenue per year \nIncremental Gross Margin per year \nIncremental Return per Labor Day \n\nHouseholds not previously raising a type of animalc\n\nIncremental Net Revenue per year \nIncremental Gross Margin per year \nIncremental Return per Labor Day \n\nHouseholds previously raising a type of animal\nIncremental Net Revenue per year \nIncremental Gross Margin per year \nIncremental Return per Labor Day \n\nHouseholds not previously raising a type of animalc\n\nIncremental Net Revenue per year \nIncremental Gross Margin per year \nIncremental Return per Labor Day \n\nSources: Government and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n538,610\n \n573,610\n \n51,305\n \n\n \n \n \n\n4,221,759 \n  \n3,839,396 \n  \n56,073 \n \n \n\n3,621,331 \n    \n3,261,331 \n    \n30,898 \n  \n  \n\n6,229,450\n   \n6,203,345\n   \n30,208\n \n \n\n3,387,659 \n  \n2,897,796 \n  \n48,561 \n \n \n\n3,467,331 \n    \n2,627,331 \n    \n29,587 \n  \n  \n\n8,770,650\n   \n8,444,545\n   \n31,244\n \n \n\n456,799\n \n484,799\n \n42,243\n \n\n \n \n \n\n3,717,887 \n  \n3,411,996 \n  \n49,691 \n \n \n\n3,206,007 \n    \n2,918,007 \n    \n27,632 \n  \n  \n\n5,479,221\n   \n5,458,337\n   \n26,588\n \n \n\n2,889,509 \n  \n2,497,619 \n  \n42,345 \n \n \n\n3,124,507 \n    \n2,212,507 \n    \n25,328 \n  \n  \n\n7,702,095\n   \n7,441,211\n   \n27,116\n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nProject Costs \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n45 \n\n15. \nIn  financial  terms,  project  costs  total  $15.4  million  (KN158.5  billion),  which  includes \ntaxes,  price  contingencies,  and  other  factors  which  do  not  reflect  economic  values  in  2005 \ncurrency  terms.  After  adjusting  for  these  factors,  this  total  cost  becomes  $12.4  million \n(KN127.7 billion),  spread  over  the  6  years  of  implementation.  After  the  implementation  period, \nthere  will  also  be  operation  and  maintenance costs  for  some  project-related  infrastructure.3 All \ncosts over the years of project life form a cost cash flow. \n \n \n \n16. \nThe  Project\u2019s  net  economic  revenue  cash  flow  can  be  calculated  from  the  benefit  and \ncost  cash  flows.  Given  the  increments  calculated  in  the  various  indicative  animal  enterprise \nmodels  and  the  assumed  adoption  rates  of  the  improved  technologies,  the  economic  net \npresent value is KN27.5 billion ($2.8 million), assuming a discount rate of 12%.

The tests indicate that the Project \nis robust, with the EIRR declining to 12.2% in the worst scenario (Table 9.3). \n \n\nSensitivity \n\nSwitching \nValue \n(% unless \notherwise \nstated) \n\nTable A9.3 Sensitivity Analysis \nExtent of \nChanges in \nProject Outputs \n(% unless \notherwise stated) \n \n\nEIRR \n(% unless \notherwise \nstated) \n17.2 \n12.7 \n11.6 \n12.7 \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n20 \n20 \n20 \n\n1.31 \n1.62 \n1.31 \n\n24.0 \n18.0 \n24.0 \n\n1.14 \n1.44 \n \n1.31 \n1.14 \n\n13.3 \n12.2 \n14.9 \n12.7 \n13.2 \n15.3 \n\n20 \n20 \n5 yrs \n20 \n20 \n1 yr \n\n31.0 \n21.0 \n10 yrs \n24.0 \n31.0 \n\n \n  \nItem \n \nBase case \nAdoption rates decrease \nAnimal prices decrease \nVillage coverage decrease \nLarger animals decrease \nIncrease in fattening time with Project \nDecrease in years of Project \nIncremental benefit decrease \nProject cost increase \nPostpone start in districts \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return. \nSource: Government and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n18. \nOverall, the economic returns would appear to be fairly robust. None of the risk factors \ncause  large  effects  upon  the  economic  returns.  Decrease  of  the  livestock  product  prices  may \nlead to reduce the EIRR below 12%. However, a substantial price drop caused by increase of \nlivestock product supply because of project intervention is highly unlikely. \n \nD. \n \n19. \nThe  poor  can  be  expected  to  be  at  some  disadvantage  (compared  to  the  nonpoor)  in \nadopting  improved  livestock  technologies.  First,  a  smaller  proportion  of  poor  households  are \nprior owners of any given type of livestock than is the case for nonpoor households. Secondly, \neven  for  prior  livestock  owners,  the  poor  are  likely  to  adopt  at  a  somewhat  lower  rate  than \nnonpoor  households  because  they  have  more  limited  resources.  In  the  project  target  districts, \non  average  68%  of  the  households  are  poor  and  many  of  them  have  some  livestock. \nEstimations  indicate  that  61%  of  chicken  improvement  adopters  can  be  expected  to  be  poor. \nSimilarly,  poor  households  are  likely  to  represent  59%  of  pig  adopters,  53%  of  goat  adopters, \nand 38% of cattle adopters. When these percentages are applied to the total incremental project \nbenefits built from the various indicative livestock models, the poor can be expected to receive \n50% of overall incremental benefits. One of the main reasons for the smaller proportion of the \npoor to adopt the new technologies is lack of capital. The village revolving fund of the Project is \naimed at removing this constraint. Once it is successfully removed, the adoption rate of the poor \nwould increase and a there is a potential for a larger proportion of the poor to benefit from the \nProject.\n\nPoverty Analysis \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                         Appendix 10     47 \n\n \nA. \n\nFunds Flow Arrangements \n\nFINANCIAL MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT \n\nThe Executing Agency (EA) of the Project will be the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry \n1. \n(MAF)  and  the  Implementing  Agency  will  be  the  Department  of  Livestock  and  Forestry  (DLF). \nThe following institutions will be established under DLF: a National Coordination Office (NCO) in \nVientiane  using  existing  DLF  staff,  a  Regional  Office  in  Luang  Prabang,  and  five  provincial \nimplementation  units  (PIUs).  For  financial  management  of  the  Project,  NCO  will  assist  the \nMinistry  of  Finance  to  manage  two  imprest  accounts\u2014one  for  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  loan  and  one  for  the  International  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development  (IFAD)  loan.  The \nimprest accounts will have advance amounting to an estimated 6 months of project expenditure \nto be disbursed from ADB and IFAD loans or a maximum of 10% of the ADB and IFAD loans, \nwhichever is less. These accounts will be replenished on a monthly basis to assure liquidity of \nfunds or when the accounts are drawn down by 20% of the initial deposits. This account will be \naudited annually by an independent auditor acceptable to ADB. NCO staff needs further training \nto properly manage these accounts. \n \n2. \nThe  Project  will  be  financed  by:  (i)  an  ADB  loan  of  $9.3  million  mainly  for  civil  works, \nvehicles,  revolving  funds,  and  equipment;  (ii)  an  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  grant  of \n$0.7 million  for  three  international  consultants;  (iii)  the  Government\u2019s  fund  of  $1.1  million  for \ntaxes and government staff; (iv) in kind and cash contribution of beneficiaries for civil works and \nsavings;  (v)  a  $3  million  loan  from  IFAD  for  the  revolving  fund,  marketing,  and  poultry \ndevelopment;  and (vi) a $3.5 million grant from the Swiss Agency for Development Cooperation \n(SDC)  for  national  and  international  consulting  services.  Regular  monitoring  and  internal  audit \nfunctions  will  be  built  up  to  monitor  transactions  along  the  line  from  central  government  to \nprovincial, district, and village levels. Such control procedures will be documented in the project \nfinance and administration manual.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe project finance and accounting function will be staffed adequately but most staff will \nnot  be  adequately  qualified  and  experienced.  Therefore,  the  Project  will  provide  training  and \nwritten  guidelines,  especially  in  ADB  procedures.  The  Project  will  also  prepare  terms  of \nreference  that  clearly  define  the  duties,  responsibilities,  lines  of  supervision,  and  limits  of \nauthority for all the officers, managers, and staff. The following responsibilities will be performed \nby  different  units  or  persons:  (i)  authorization  to  execute  a  transaction;  (ii)  recording  of  the \ntransaction; and (iii) custody of assets involved in the transaction. The bank reconciliation will be \nprepared  by  someone  other  than  those  who  approve  payments.  MAF  has  developed  an \naccounting  system  that  allows  for  the  proper  recording  of  project  financial  transactions.  This \nincludes  the  allocation  of  expenditures  in  accordance  with  the  respective  components, \ndisbursement categories, and sources of funds. The Project will follow the system to support the \nharmonization of project funding by various international funding agencies. The existing project \nfinancial manual will be updated to be applicable for the Project and acceptable to ADB. \n \n4. \nControls  will  be  in  place  concerning  the  preparation  and  approval  of  transactions, \nensuring  that  all  transactions  are  correctly  made  and  adequately  explained.  The  chart  of \naccounts  will  be  adequate  to  properly  account  for  and  report  on  project  activities  and \ndisbursement  categories.  The  cost  allocations  to  the  various  funding  sources  will  be  made \naccurately and in accordance with established agreements. The general ledger and subsidiary \nledgers  will  be  reconciled  and  in  balance.  The  existing  accounting  software  will  also  be \n\nFinancial and Accounting \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nupgraded to help the Project produce quarterly financial monitoring reports and annual financial \nstatements  in  the  format  agreed  by  ADB.  All  accounting  and  supporting  documents  will  be \nretained on a permanent basis in a defined system that allows authorized users easy access. \n \nIn  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy, 1  the  Project  will  develop  adequate \n5. \nsafeguards to protect assets from fraud, waste, and abuse\u2014particularly regarding the sections \nof  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  The  subsidiary \nrecords of fixed assets and stocks will be kept up to date and reconciled with control accounts. \nPeriodic physical inventories of fixed assets and stocks will be conducted. Except for vehicles, \nother  assets  will  not  be  sufficiently  covered  by  insurance  policies.  The  Project  will  establish \ncontrols and procedures for managing fund flow, financial information, accountability, and audits \nto ensure information among the different offices will flow in an accurate and timely manner. It \nwill  ensure  that  periodic  reconciliations  will  be  performed  among  the  different  offices.  The \nProject will also advise employees, beneficiaries, and other recipients to whom to report if they \nsuspect fraud, waste, or misuse of project resources or property.  \n \nC. \n\nInternal and External Audit and Reporting \n\n6. \nDelayed  audit  and  lack  of  consistent  external  audit  standards  and  procedures  are  a \ncritical problem in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). Therefore, external auditor \nacceptable  to  ADB  will  be  appointed  for  the  Project.  The  scope  of  audit  and  reports \nrequirements  will  have  to  be  identified  and  discussed  with  ADB  before  the  effectiveness.  The \nauditors  will  be  selected  from  international  auditing  companies  through  competitive  bidding \nprocedures. The project audit will be conducted in accordance with the International Standards \non Auditing. The Project is subject to any kind of audit from an independent governmental entity \n(e.g.,  NAO,  the  supreme  audit  institution)  in  addition  to  the  external  audit.  The  Project  will \nprepare acceptable terms of reference for an annual project audit. \n \nFinancial statements will be prepared on a quarterly and annual basis, and the reporting \n7. \nsystem  will  have  the  capacity  to  link  the  financial  information  with  the  Project's  physical \nprogress. The separate systems will be used to gather and compile physical data. Controls will \nbe in place to reduce the risk that the physical data may not synchronize with the financial data. \nThe Project will also establish financial management reporting responsibilities that specify what \nreports  are  to  be  prepared,  what  they  are  to  contain,  and  how  they  are  to  be  used.  Financial \nmanagement  reports  will  be  used  by  management  for  comparing  actual  expenditures  with \nbudgeted  and  programmed  allocations.  The  financial  management  system  will  be  partly \ncomputerized. The system will produce the necessary project financial reports, and the staff will \nbe adequately trained to maintain the system. \n \nD. \n\nConclusion and Recommendation \n\n8. \nBased on the assessment, and past experience of ADB working with MAF, the current \nfinancial  management  arrangements  are  adequate  for  the  Project.  However,  significant \nweaknesses  in  the  accounting  and  financial  management  system  need  to  be  addressed  to \nensure  that  the  Project  will  be  effectively  implemented  and  has  sustainable  development \nimpacts.

The Lao CSP 2002-051 of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and the Poverty Reduction Partnership Agreement signed by the Government and ADB in \n2001  state  that  efforts  will  be  directed  to  reducing  poverty  by  broadening  community  participation  and  opportunities \nduring  the  next  5  years.  The  operational  priorities  to  achieve  these  goals  are:  (i)  rural  development  and  market \nlinkages, (ii) human resource development, (iii) sustainable environmental management, and (iv) regional integration. \n \nThe  overall  aim  of  the  Northern  Region  Sustainable  Livelihoods  Development  through  Livestock  Project  is  to \ncontribute  to  government  initiatives  in  poverty  reduction  through  smallholder  livestock  development  in  the  northern \nregion of Lao PDR. This recognizes the Government\u2019s priority to address widespread poverty in the northern region; \nthe  importance  of  livestock  as  a  source  of  food  protein  and  cash  incomes  for  upland  villagers;  and  that  livestock \nraising  is  a  profitable,  smallholder  production  alternative  to  upland  cropping  that  will  allow  shifting  cultivators  to \nmaintain household income levels as they stabilize their production systems. \n \nThree immediate outcomes contribute to this aim: (i) enhanced village livestock systems, (ii) community development \nand  capacity  building,  and  (iii)  enhanced  project  implementation  and  management.  The  first  is  further  divided  into \nthree  subcomponents  that  reflect  the  identified  problem  areas  for  livestock  performance:  (i)  improved  livestock \nproductivity,  (ii)  improved  market  orientation  and  livestock  enterprise  development,  and  (iii)  improved  participatory \nextension network.  \n \n\n \nB. \n\nPoverty Analysis                            Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention \n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nOf  an  estimated  population  of  5.1  million  in  Lao  PDR,  38.6%  live  below  the  poverty  line.  This  is  defined  as  where  a \nperson cannot access the equivalent of 2,100 calories from foodstuffs (ranges from calorie intake of 1,200 calories per \nday for infants to 2,767 calories for adult males and 1,747 calories for females over the age of 60) or the equivalent of \nKN142,500 per month or less than $0.50 per day. The poverty line is 30% higher in Vientiane than the rural areas of \nLao PDR.  \n \nPoorest  provinces.  The  project  area  comprises  18  priority  poor  districts  in  the  five  northern  provinces  of  Bokeo, \nHouaphanh, Luang Namtha, Luang Prabang, and Xieng Khouang. This area was identified from among those districts \nwhere  the  number  of  poor  households  exceeded  50%,  as  classified  in  the  National  Growth  and  Poverty  Eradication \nStrategy (NGPES). \n \nPoorest  districts  and  incidence  of  poverty.  Based  on  the  NGPES  classification,  the  incidence  of  poverty  for  the \nselected  districts  in  the  project  area  ranges  from  55%  in  Nonghet  to  92%  in  Houamouang.  Among  the  18  target \ndistricts, 10 districts participated in the socioeconomic survey undertaken during the preparation of the project, which \nincluded the district  with the  highest incidence of poverty  as  well as the  lowest. The three main indicators of poverty \nwere identified as: (i) rice security (shortage of rice), (ii) access to land, and (iii) insufficient large livestock.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\n   Yes               \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nThe  strategy  is  to  deploy  contracted  provincial  and  district  units  of  the  Lao  Women\u2019s  Union  (LWU)  to  provide \nmobilization, organization, and training support to participating communities. These LWU units will be contracted by the \nregional  office  to  work  at  the  village  and  district  level  in  close  collaboration  with  District  Agriculture  and  Fisheries \nExtension  Office  (DAFEO)  staff.  They  will  organize  gender  representative  groups,  including  the  poor,  to  undertake \ndecision  making  and  implementation  of  activities  related  to  improving  livelihoods,  village  infrastructure,  savings,  and \ncredit. Once trained, the groups will progressively handle responsibility for the use of project resources to be invested \nat village level, with backstopping from the service providers. Extension and training will also be provided through these \ngroups  using  a  problem-solving  approach.  DAFEO  staff  will  be  trained  in  participatory  and  gender  responsive \napproaches.

Women  will be  provided literacy training and translation services \nfor  extension  and  training  programs.  The  Project  will  promote  women\u2019s  participation  in  all  village-based  training \nprograms  to  constitute  approximately  half  of  all  trainees.  They  will  be  encouraged  to  participate  in  village  revolving \nfunds groups and village  infrastructure committees, as  well as community  and  household decision making  on  priority \ninvestments. Based on baseline data to be  collected and analyzed prior to project start-up in villages,  women  will be \nprogressively encouraged to constitute at least half of all members of village revolving funds groups. \n \nThe Project will provide gender sensitization training at all levels of the project implementation structure, including the \nvillage.

Women among the \ntarget upland communities enjoy varying degrees of social recognition and rights to participate \nin decision making. The larger upland ethnic groups in the project area, comprising the Khmu \nand  Hmong,  are  characterized  by  patriarchal  economic  and  social  structures  within  which \nwomen have heavy workloads and less status and decision making. However, all upland ethnic \ngroups demonstrate growing poverty and insecurity of livelihoods, which affect women badly. \n  \n2. \nThe  Project  will  aim  to  improve  women\u2019s  knowledge  and  their  access  to  financial, \nphysical,  and  social  capital  for  improved  livelihoods.  Women  will  be  targeted  for  literacy  and \nnumeracy  training  to  eliminate  their  initial  disadvantages.  The  Project  will  facilitate  their \nmobilization  and  organization  to  improve  their  participation  in  community  decision  making,  the \nparticipatory  adoption  and  popularization  of  new \ntechnical  practices,  and  marketing \narrangements.  Women  will  be  supported  through  training  for  representation  in  village \nrevolving/infrastructure  funds  management,  and  as  beneficiaries  of  these  funds.  The  Project \nsets progressive targets for the gender action to be implemented and monitored. \n\n \n\n(i) \n\nThe Project will facilitate women\u2019s participation in village based training At least \n50% of all trainees in village-based training programs are expected to be women. \nHowever, for training programs aimed at smaller livestock, women are expected \nto comprise about 70\u201380% of all trainees. \n\n(ii)  Women will be equitably represented in village revolving fund/infrastructure fund \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nmanagement structures. \nBased  on  baseline  data,  women  will  form  at  least  30\u201350%  of  all  beneficiaries \nunder the village revolving funds. \nAt least 50% of all extension workers will be women. \nGender training will be provided to staff of the Provincial Agriculture and Forestry \nOffice (PAFO) and District Agriculture and Fisheries Extension Office (DAFEO). \nAll  BME  will  be  gender-responsive  and  measure  project  impacts  on  women  in \nterms  of  returns  to  labor,  improved  productivity  of  livestock,  participation  in \nenterprise  promotion,  take  of  credit,  membership  of  community  based  groups, \nextent of participation in training, etc. \n\n \n\n\f52     Appendix 13 \n\nETHNIC GROUPS DEVELOPMENT PLAN  \n\nIntroduction \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nThe objective of the Project is to improve the sustainability of upland livelihoods through \nparticipatory  livestock  development.  Lack  of  access  to  adequate  productive  resources  and \nopportunities  leads  to  the  absence  of  sustainable  livelihoods 1 for  the  predominantly  upland \nethnic  populations  in  the  northern  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR).  This  ethnic \ngroups  development  plan  (EGDP)  aims  to  provide  further  information  and  analysis  of  these \nconstraints, and ways in which the Project will target ethnic groups to ensure equitable access \nto  project  outputs  and  impacts.  The  EGDP  is  based  on  extensive  consultations  with  ethnic \ngroups in the project area. These consultations took the following forms: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nSocioeconomic  surveys  conducted  during  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance in January/June 2005 in 40 villages in the 18 districts. \nParticipatory research and consultations in selected villages carried out in June\u2013\nJuly 2005.   \n\n(iii)  Workshops conducted during the project preparatory technical assistance. \nParticipatory workshop conducted in Luang Prabang on 15 February 2006. \n(iv) \nDuring  pre-appraisal,  it  was  also  indicated  that  a  greater  stress  on  smallholder \n(v) \npoultry is a priority for poor households.  \nthrough \nAfter  pre-appraisal,  a \nconsultative  workshops  on  social  and  environmental  related  to  the  Project.  The \nreport was submitted to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in May 2006. \nThe Project and the EGDP are based on the outcomes of these discussions. \n\nlocal  consultant  engaged  all  18  districts \n\n(vii) \n\n(vi) \n\nBackground  \n\n \nB. \n \n3. \nOne of the main characteristics of the Lao PDR is its cultural diversity. For the purposes \nof the 1995 census, the Government recognized 47 main ethnic groups or categories and 149 \nsubgroups, and  the  last  revision  of  this  list  by  the  Lao  Front  for  National  Construction  (LFNC) \ncontained  49  categories  and  over  160  subgroups.  Thus,  the  official  terminology  for  describing \nthe diverse population of the Lao PDR is \u201cethnic groups\u201d.  \n \nIn  Lao  PDR,  all  people  are  considered  equal,  irrespective  of  ethnic  background. 2 \n4. \nAlthough almost 50 major ethnic groups are recognized by the national census, ethnic groups \nare  conventionally  divided  into  three  major  groups  based  on  prototypical  location:  (i)  Lowland \nLao  (Lao  Loum)  who  tend  to  settle  in  valleys  and  flatlands,  (ii)  Upland  Lao  (Lao  Sung)  who \nprefer higher altitudes, and (iii) Midland Lao (Lao Theung) who tend to inhabit mid-level slopes. \nHowever, there are many exceptions to these stereotypic village locations so such universalities \n                                                 \n1   The sustainable livelihoods framework developed by Institute for Development Studies (IDS), Sussex, and adopted \nby  the  Department  for  International  Development  (DFID)  of  the  United  Kingdom,  puts  people  at  the  center  of \ndevelopment  and  views  them  as  operating  in  a  context  of  vulnerability.  It  provides  a  very  useful  and  relevant \nanalytical  framework  to  (i)  understand  the  multidimensional  nature  of  poverty,  as  defined  by  people  themselves; \nand  (ii)  analyze  their  access  to  the  various  types  of  capital  (financial,  physical,  social,  human,  natural)  and  their \nability to combine and utilize these assets as individuals/ households, in ways that may enable them to ensure their \naccess to adequate subsistence and well-being\u2014including improvements therein in future, without undermining the \nnatural  resource  base.  Conversely,  the  absence  of  any  of  these  can  lead  to  poverty,  vulnerability  to  loss  of \nsubsistence,  and  reduced  well-being.

Over two thirds of the national population is Lao Loum, which comprise 8 \nethnic  groups  within  the  Lao-Tai  language  family.  The  upland  or  highland  Lao  make  up  about \n10%  of  the  population  and  comprise  7  groups  within  the  Chine-Tibet  language  family  and  2 \ngroups  within  the  Hmong-Lu  Mien  language  family.  Midland  Lao  account  for  25%  of  the  total \npopulation and comprise 32 groups within the Mon-Khmer language family (footnote 3). \n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable A14.1: Ethnicity of the Population \n\n \n\n \nEthno-Linguistic \n\n \nTopographical \n\nLanguage \nFamily \n\nNo. of Ethnic \nGroups \n\n \nProportion of \nPopulation (%) \n\nTai Kadai \n\nLao Loum \n\nLao Phoutai \n\nAustroasiatic \n\nLao Theung \n\nMon Khmer \n\nHmong-lu Mien \n\nLao Sung \n\nHmong Yao \n\nChine-Tibetan \n\nLao Sung \n\nTibeto Burman \n\nChine-Tibetan \n\nLao Sung \n\nHor Han \n\n8 \n\n32 \n\n2 \n\n7 \n\n1 \n\n66.2 \n\n23.0 \n\n7.4 \n2.5 \n\n0.2 \n\nSources: Chamberlain, J. and P.

Lao PDR policy emphasizes the multiethnic nature \nof  the  nation  and,  in  many  ways,  works  to  reduce  discrimination  against  midland  and  upland \nminorities.  The  use  of  the  \u201cthree-ethnic  group\u201d  emphasizes  the  commonality  of  Lao  nationality \n\u201cLao  First\u201d 4  and  is  widely  used  in  the  country  to  refer  to  specific  ethnicity.  While  there  is \nparticipation in the political process, with a number of non-Lao ethnic people holding positions in \ngovernment,  there  is  no  equal  representation  at  all  political  levels  when  compared  to  their  total \nnumbers  in  the  provincial  populations.  In  Lao  PDR,  poverty,  culture,  and  ethnicity  are  closely \nlinked. 5  Often,  due  to  remote  location,  ethnic  people  have  comparatively  less  access  to \ngovernment  services  such  as  health,  education,  agricultural  extension,  and  infrastructure.  As  a \nresult, development impacts can be marginalizing on isolated and pre-market ethnic economies. \nFurther,  the  higher  incidence  of  poverty,  particularly  among  minority  groups,  makes  them  more \nvulnerable socially and economically.6 \n\nGovernment of Lao PDR Policies towards Ethnic Groups \n\nD. \n \n6. \nReview  of  Government  Policy  on  Ethnic  Groups.

Increasing emphasis was made on the \nimportance of diversity, which is increasingly seen as a source of strength rather than a threat. \n \n10. \nEthnic Minority Affairs in 1981. By recognizing the lack of policy and attention to some \nethnic  groups,  the  Political  Bureau  issued  a  resolution  in  1981  concerning  the  affairs  of  all \nethnic groups, although it was aimed specifically the Hmong and became known as the \u201cHmong \nPolicy\u201d.  The  policy  was  primarily  focused  on  shifting  cultivation  in  rural  development  and \nrequired  that  the  livelihoods  of  the  people,  both  materially  and  mentally,  be  improved.  In  the \ncase of Hmong, the policy required conditions to be in place to allow a solid basis for production \nand, over the next five-year period, various resettlements of highland groups were undertaken \nin  an  attempt  to  improve  their  food  security.  The  policy  also  required  consultation  and  a \nremedial  approach  to  solving  problems  of  land  shortage,  land  disputes  between  Hmong  and \nother  ethnic  groups,  and  problems  created  by  resettlement  during  the  war  and  through  rural \ndevelopment  (including  those  who  wished  to  return  to  their  original  territory  or  move  to  new \nones). The policy showed that the Government was aware of deficiencies in meeting the basic \nneeds  of  the  rural  ethnic  people,  especially  the  Hmong,  and  proposed  solutions  which \nemphasized  participation  and  consensus  of  traditional/local  leaders  as  well  as  the  people \nthemselves. \n \n11.  \nThe  Third  Party  Congress  (April  1982),  while  focusing  on  economic  development  and \nnational  defense,  followed  an  agenda  in  relation  to  the  development  of  ethnic  minorities  that \nincluded stabilization of shifting cultivation and relocation and resettlement of upland villages to \nlowland areas where there was potential for paddy rice cultivation. \n \n Most  of  the  resettlement  projects  failed  to  meet  expectations  because  of  insufficient \n12.  \npreparation of both resettling and host communities, and inadequate resources and experience \nto  support  the  policy.  In  some  cases,  they  resulted  in  resettled  villages  moving  back  to  their \nprevious land within a few years. \n \nThe Fifth Party Congress (March 1991) reiterated the commitment to the maintenance of \n13. \nethnic  identities  and  the  economic  development  of  all  groups.  The  Congress  subsequently \nconfirmed  the  adoption  of  a  \u201cnew  economic  mechanism\u201d  and  reaffirmed  that  transition  from \nsubsistence  to  a  market  economy  must  be  accompanied  by  the  progressive  abandoning  of \nslash and burn practices. \n \n14. \nThe Fifth Party Congress had two main achievements in relation to ethnic groups: (i) the \nadoption  of  the  Constitution  of  the  Lao  PDR,  which  recognized  citizens  of  all  ethnicity \n(Section 2.1.2)7; and (ii) the recognition that implementation of the 1981 Ethnic Policy had been \nineffectual,  resulting  in  the  1992  Resolution  on  Ethnic  Affairs  in  the  New  Era  (footnote  7, \nSection 2.1.3). \n \nThe  Constitution.  The  Constitution  of  the  Lao  PDR  was  passed  in  1991  as  a \n15. \nconsolidation  of  the  rights  and  responsibilities  of  the  State  and  the  people.  Throughout  the \nConstitution, the term \u201ccitizens of all ethnicity\u201d is used. The Constitution states that all citizens \nhave  rights  in  education,  health,  land  use  and  ownership,  domicile  of  choice,  and  economic \n\n                                                 \n7 Lao Peoples\u2019 Democratic Republic. 1991.

The  Party  Central  Committee  issued  a  resolution  on  Ethnic \n17. \nAffairs in the New Era in 1992. The first section of the resolution constitutes an evaluation of the \nimplementation  of  the  1981  ethnic  affairs  policy.  While  acknowledging  some  progress,  this \nsection is essentially a strong critique of the lack of progress in most areas of implementation. It \nhighlighted  the  lack  of  adequate  attention  to  ethnic  groups\u2019  livelihood,  education,  training,  and \nmotivation,  as  well  as  the  lack  of  coordination  among  concerned  government  agencies  in \naddressing their problems. \n\n18. \nThis resolution was to be implemented through both political and economic development \nactivities, which included halting shifting cultivation and the permanent settlement of the people \nwho practiced it. This was to be followed by programs to improve their livelihoods. \n\nE. \n\nADB Policy on Indigenous Peoples \n\nADB's  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples 10  focuses  on  the  circumstances  of  indigenous \n19. \npeoples  (\u201cethnic  minorities\u201d)  and  on  identifying  and  satisfying  their  needs  and  developmental \naspirations.  It  emphasizes  the  participation  of  ethnic  minorities  in  development,  and  the \nmitigation of its negative effects and impacts. \n\n20. \nshould be: \n\nThe  policy  stipulates  that  ADB-funded  projects  in  which  ethnic  minorities  are  affected \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\nconsistent with the needs and aspirations of affected ethnic minority peoples; \ncompatible  in  substance  and  structure  with  affected  ethnic  minorities\u2019  culture \nand social and economic institutions; \nconceived, planned, and implemented with the informed participation of affected \ncommunities; \nequitable in terms of development efforts and impact; and \nnot  imposing  the  negative  effects  of  development  on  ethnic  minorities  without \nappropriate and acceptable compensation. \n \n\n21. \nThe  term  \u201cindigenous  people\u201d  is  generic  and  includes  cultural  minorities,  ethnic \nminorities,  indigenous  cultural  communities,  tribal  peoples,  scheduled  tribes,  natives,  and \naboriginals. The definition 11, is encompassing and describes indigenous people as having the \nfollowing characteristics: \n \n\n                                                 \n8   Government of Lao Peoples\u2019 Democratic Republic. 1992.

(i) descent from population groups present in a given area before modern states or \nterritories  were  created,  and  (ii)  maintenance  of  cultural  and  social  identities  separate \nfrom  mainstream  or  dominant  societies  or  cultures.  Additional  characteristics  include \n(i) self-identification  and  identification  of  others  as  being  part  of  a  distinct  indigenous \ncultural group, and the display of desire to preserve that cultural identity; (ii) a linguistic \nidentity  different  from  that  of  mainstream  or  dominant  society;  (iii)  social,  cultural, \neconomic, and political traditions and institutions distinct from mainstream or dominant \nculture;  (iv)  an  economic  system  oriented  more  toward  a  traditional  system  of \nproduction than the mainstream system; or (v) a unique tie and attachment to traditional \nhabitat and ancestral territory and natural resources. \n\n \n22. \nThe  approach  adopted  by  ADB  in  project  and  program  development  is  to  seek  the \ngreatest possible reduction in poverty among indigenous peoples and, in cases where adverse \ncultural effects are unavoidable, to minimize these effects through identification of appropriate \nmitigation measures. Furthermore, where indigenous people are to be affected by a project, it \nis  important  to  incorporate  mechanisms  into  project  planning  that  will  ensure  the  equal  or \nenhanced enjoyment of project benefits by indigenous people. \n \n23. \nThis approach recognizes that even programs that are aimed at improving quality of life \n(i.e., poverty reduction projects) do not necessarily equally reach all sectors of the community, \nand  invariably,  indigenous  people\u2014for  a  variety  of  reasons\u2014often  bear  a  disproportionate \nburden  of  adverse  social  and  economic  effects  of  development.  Therefore,  project  planning \nmust include strategies to overcome such structural constraints and appropriate communication \navenues are identified, particularly when conventional approaches to information dissemination \nmay not be adequate. Any such strategy would also need to provide specific mechanisms for \nindigenous women\u2019s concerns to be identified and addressed through the project process. To \nthis end, OM F-3/BP notes that \u201c...development interventions that will affect indigenous peoples \nshould  ensure  that  they  have  opportunities  to  participate  in  and  benefit  equally  from  the \ninterventions\u201d. \n \n24. \nTo ensure that people of ethnic minority groups are included in appropriate ways in the \ndevelopment  process,  OM  F-3/BP  requires  the  preparation  of  an  indigenous  peoples\u2019 \ndevelopment  plan.  In  the  context  of  the  Project,  the  process  of  facilitating  the  participation  of \nethnic  minorities  in  the  Project,  and  ensuring  that  they  benefit  equitably,  is  termed  an  ethnic \nminority  development  plan  (EGDP).  The  EGDP  lays  out  basic  principles  for  ensuring  the \nequitable participation of ethnic minority households/communities in development of sustainable \nlivelihoods, with particular attention to the needs of ethnic minority women. \n \nF. \n \n\nDevelopment Activities under the Project Components \n\n1. \n\nEnhanced Village Livestock Systems \n\n \n25. \nActivities proposed under this component seek to change the current perspective of low \ninput-low  output  systems  in  improving  the  productivity  of  ethnic  groups  and  rendering  them \nmore market-oriented. \n  \n26. \nInitiatives.  The  Project  will:  (i)  improve  livestock  growth  via  the \nintroduction  of  forages\u2014through  nursery  development,  supply  of  planting  materials,  training, \nand  improved  animal  feeding;  (ii)  improve  livestock  survival  through  better  management  of \nlivestock  movements,  improved  disease  monitoring,  and  support  for  emergency  vaccinations; \n(iii) improve livestock fertility through smallholder training and improved management of smaller \nlivestock;  and  (iv)  improve  management  practices  through  farmer  training,  training  of  women \n\nProductivity \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                          Appendix 13       57 \n\n(especially for smaller livestock production), and demonstrations of livestock management. It will \nsupport a village revolving fund to be administered by local village-based groups to be trained \nunder  the  Project.  All  these  outputs  are  expected  to  be  delivered  through  participatory  and \nculturally appropriate approaches to ensure that ethnic groups, particularly Lao Theung and Lao \nSung ethnic groups, are able to participate fully in project activities.  \n \n27. \nMarket Linkages and Enterprise Development. The second component will improve \nmarket efficiency and enterprise development. The Project will also provide smallholder training \nand  support  for  group  marketing  activities.  The  Project  will  fund  village  infrastructure  to \nrehabilitate  or  establish  essential  transport  and  other  small-scale  village  infrastructure  to \nimprove  market  access  (pathways  and  bridges)  and  village  life  (e.g.,  gravity  fed  water \nsupplies).  \n \n28. \nParticipatory Extension Network. The Project will support the government extension \nservice  through  capacity  building  for  technical  know-how  and  participatory  methodologies  for \nextension using a problem solving approach.  \n \n \n \n29.  The  Project  will  fund  capacity  building  activities  in  upland  communities  through  service \ncontracts with Lao Women\u2019s Union (LWU) in order to promote group formation for participatory \nfor \ntechnology \ndisadvantaged groups\u2014to ensure they share the benefits of the Project.  \n\nCapacity Building for Community Driven Development  \n\nliteracy  and  numeracy \n\ntransfer;  and  provide \n\ntraining,  particularly \n\nfor \n\n2.  \n\n30.   Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  All  project  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  address  the \nparticipation  and  benefits  to  non-Lao  ethnic  groups  under  all  project  components.  The \nInternational  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development  (IFAD)  Result  and  Impact  Management \nSystem  (RIMS)  will  be  used  to  monitor  outcomes  of  the  Project.  This  will  include  changes  to \nasset structures of households and information on malnutrition and changes therein. A baseline \nsurvey will be conducted prior to implementation of project activities. Full-scale evaluations will \nbe  carried  out  on  ethnicity  and  gender  issues  in  improving  livelihoods  through  livestock \nproduction at midterm (year four) and at the end of the Project.  \n\nG. \n\nBudget \n\n \n31. \ninclude the following: \n\nThe  budgetary  allocations  that  will  directly  support  the  implementation  of  the  EGDP \n\nTable A14.2: Budgetary Support to EGDP \n\n($) \n\nProject Outputs \nExtension materials in ethnic group languages              \nInternational consultancy support for gender and     \n   community development                                \nNational consultancy support for gender and  \n   community development                                             \nContract servicesa                                                          \nRevolving funds                                                              \nFarmer training                                                               \nTotal \nEGDP = Ethnic Groups Development Plan. \na  These refer to contracts to be entered into by the Project with Lao Women\u2019s Union (LWU) and mass    \n   organizations/nongovernment organizations (NGOs) to provide capacity building services to village   \n   communities for group formation, technology transfer, credit and savings programs. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.\n\n      473,264 \n       \n      120,000 \n     \n      105,000 \n      954,934 \n   2,807,000   \n      614,000 \n   5,074,198 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f58     Appendix 14 \n\n \nA. \n\n \n\nInternational Consultants \n\nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE OF CONSULTANTS \n\n1. \n\nRegional Office Advisor (Rural Development Consultant) (15 person-months) \n\n1. \nThe  consultant  will  be  recruited  to  support  the  Department  of  Livestock  and  Fisheries \n(DLF), in particular the national project director (NPD), in achieving project goals and objectives. \nS/he will assist the NPD in the overall coordination and management of implementation of the \nProject,  and  in  particular  will  facilitate  adherence  to  the  progress  and  financial  reporting \nrequirement and all other procedures of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).
