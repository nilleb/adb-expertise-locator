To \nbe  included  in  the  Project,  municipalities  (Pourashavas)  are \nrequired  to  implement  an  Urban  Governance  Improvement  Action \nProgram (UGIAP). Initially, Pourashavas will be given limited funds \nto cover the most urgent investment requirements.  The continuing \nparticipation  in  the  sector  Project,  however,  will  depend  on  the \nactual progress made with the implementation of the UGIAP by the \nparticipating  municipalities.  This \nsignificant \nimprovement  from  the  previous  approach,  in  which  all  investment \ncomponents  were  predetermined  at  the  time  of  project  appraisal \nand the participating Pourashavas were left unaccountable for their \nperformance  during  project \nimplementation.  The  blueprint \napproach  adopted  in  the  past  has  clearly  failed  in  its  commitment \nto  bring  about  sustainable  improvements  in  urban  management \nthe  basically  supply-driven  nature  of  resource \nbecause  of \nallocation.  Thus,  a  performance-based  sector  approach \nis \nemployed under the Project, involving demand-driven allocation of \nloan proceeds that is based on clearly defined performance criteria \nand the commitment to undertake governance reform. \n \nRecent  experience  in  Bangladesh  suggests  that  urbanization \nneeds to be seen in a positive light. The poverty reducing potential \nof  well-planned  and  decentralized  urbanization \nimmense, \nespecially \nterm.  However,  unplanned  and \nlonger \nuncontrolled  urbanization  creates  tremendous  pressure  on  basic \nurban infrastructure and eventually limits the growth potential of the \nnational  economy.  Moreover,  the  concentration  of  population  and \nactivities  in  a  few  metropolitan  areas  tends  to  further  aggravate \nurban  environmental  conditions  in  the  absence  of  adequate \ncapacities to manage urban growth. Recognizing diseconomies of \ncongestion  and  environmental  degradation  in  metropolitan  cities, \nthe  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  continue  to  provide \nassistance  to  the  urban  sector  for  rehabilitation  and  expansion  of \nurban  development  and  services  in  Pourashavas  throughout  the \ncountry, and to further assist in decentralization and strengthening \nof urban governance. \n \n\nthe \n\nin \n\nis \n\n\fiv \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCost Estimates \n\nto \n\n(iii) \n\nreduce \n\nvulnerability \n\nlow-cost  sanitation, \n\nin  municipal  management  and \n\nThe  Project  will  assist  the  selected  Pourashavas  to  (i)  enhance \nstrengthen \naccountability \ncapabilities in the provision of municipal services, and (ii) develop \nand expand physical infrastructure and urban services to increase \neconomic  opportunities,  and \nto \nenvironmental  degradation,  poverty,  and  natural  hazards.  The \nProject will also promote the active participation of women citizens \nin  municipal  management  and  services  as  well  as  upgrade  the \nconditions of the poorest and most needy groups in the slum area. \n \nThe  Project  comprises  three  parts:  Part  A,  Urban  Infrastructure \nImprovement,  covers  the  improvement/expansion  of  the  following \nmunicipal  infrastructure  facilities:  (i)  roads  and  bridges,  (ii)  storm \n(iv)  solid  waste \nwater  drainage, \nmanagement, (v) municipal facilities (e.g., bus and truck terminals, \nkitchen markets, and slaughterhouses) and (vi) slum improvement. \ninclusion  of  water  supply \nUnder  specific  circumstances \nrehabilitation schemes will also be considered. \n \nPart B, Urban Governance Improvement, includes implementation \nof an action program in five key result areas: (i) citizen awareness \nand  participation;  (ii)  women\u2019s  participation;  (iii)  integration  of  the \nurban  poor;  (iv)  financial  accountability  and  sustainability;  and  (v) \nadministrative  transparency.  In  each  of  these  five  areas,  the \nPourashavas will need to achieve well-defined performance targets \nthat  will  be  closely  monitored  and  evaluated  during  project \nimplementation. \n \nPart  C,  Capacity  Building  and  Implementation  Assistance,  covers \n(i)  project  management,  detailed  engineering  design,  construction \nsupervision,  nongovernment  organization  support  to  community-\nbased activities, and facilitation of community mobilization; and (ii) \nto \ninstitutional  capacity-building  programs \nsuccessfully  implement  the  UGIAP,  including  (a)  an  orientation \nprogram  for  Pourashava  chairpersons  and  ward  commissioners, \n(b) a tailored program for female ward commissioners, (c) training \nprograms  for  municipal  secretaries  to  implement  the  community-\nbased  activities  under  the  UGIAP,  (d)  computerization  of  tax \nrecords  and  billing, \ncomputerization  of  accounting \nmanagement, (f) infrastructure inventory assessment and mapping,  \nand (g) training for decentralized township planning. \n \nThe  Project  will  cost  approximately  $87  million  equivalent,  $21.5 \nmillion  equivalent  of  this  in  foreign  exchange  costs  and  $65.5 \nmillion equivalent in local currency costs. \n\nfor  Pourashavas \n\n(e) \n\n\f \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nv \n\n \n \nComponent \nPart A: Urban Infrastructure  \n            Improvement \nPart B: Urban Governance \n            Improvement \nPart C: Capacity Building and \n            Implementation Assistance \nInterest During Construction \n\n \n\nTotal \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\n \n17.6 \n \n0.4 \n \n1.8 \n1.7 \n\n21.5 \n\n \n47.1 \n \n4.5 \n \n11.3 \n2.6 \n\n65.5 \n\nTotal \nCosts \n \n64.7 \n \n4.9 \n \n13.1 \n4.3 \n \n87.0 \n\n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  a  loan  of  $60 \nmillion  equivalent  from  its  Special  Fund  resources,  representing \n69%  of  the  total  costs.

The  project  director  will  be \ndirectly  responsible  for  overall  project  implementation,  monitoring, \nand  supervision.  PMO  will  have  two  deputy  project  directors,  one \nfor  technical,  engineering,  and  supervision  support;  and  one  for \nenvironment,  sanitation,  and  slum \nIn  each \nparticipating  Pourashava,  a  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  will \nbe  established,  headed  by  the  pourashava  chairperson  and \ncomprising  three  sections:  (i)  Infrastructure  Improvement  Section; \n(ii)  Environment,  Sanitation  and  Slum  Improvement  Section;  and \n(iii) Urban Governance Improvement Section. \n\nimprovement. \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \nProcurement \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nDisbursement \n\n \nTraining  capacities  at  LGED  will  be  strengthened  and  transferred \ninto  the  national  and  regional  urban  management  support  units \n(UMSUs),  which  will  be  responsible  for  providing  comprehensive \ntraining  and  institutional  support,  in  the  first  instance,  to  all \nCategory A and larger Category B Pourashavas. \n \nGoods  and  services  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. Since the contracts for civil works will \nbe  small  and  widely  dispersed,  international  competitive  bidding \n(ICB)  is  not  considered  appropriate.  Consequently,  all  the  civil \nworks  contracts  will  be  procured  on  the  basis  of  local  competitive \nbidding  among  prequalified  contractors  in  accordance  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  procurement  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Each \nsupply  contract  for  equipment  or  materials  estimated  to  cost \n$500,000 or more will be awarded on the basis of ICB, and those \ncosting  less  than  the  equivalent  of  $500,000  (other  than  minor \nitems)  but  more  than  $100,000  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of \ninternational shopping. Direct purchase procedures will be used for \nsmall or off-the-shelf items valued at less than $100,000.  \n \nConsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB. A total of 4,006 person-months \nof consulting services (59 international and 3,947 domestic) will be \nrequired.  Five  packages  of  consulting  services  will  be  provided \nunder the Project: two for the national UMSU (governance program \ndevelopment,  and  performance  evaluation  and  monitoring)  and \nthe  PMO  (management,  design  and  supervision, \nthree \nmonitoring and evaluation, and facilitation of UGIAP activities). The \nconsultants will support the UMSU and PMO/PIUs and will transfer \nproject management and technical skills to the government staff. \n \nThe  civil  works  contracts  to  be  awarded  will  generally  be  small  in \nvalue and involve a large number of contractors and suppliers. To \nensure  effective  Project  implementation  and  timely  disbursement, \nthe  Government  will  establish  an  imprest  account  in  the  name  of \nthe  Project  at \nthe \neffectiveness  of  the  Loan  Agreement.  Payments  for  civil  works \ncontracts  will  be  made  through  this  account  for  eligible  payments \nunder the Project. The statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure \nwill be adopted to facilitate reimbursement and liquidation of small \ncontracts.  The  imprest  account  and  the  SOE  procedure  will  be \nestablished,  maintained,  and  audited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLoan  Disbursement  Handbook.  The  initial  advance  to  the  imprest \naccount  will  correspond  to  6  months  of  estimated  ADB-financed \nexpenditures  to  be  paid  from  this  account.  The  SOE  procedure  is \napplicable only to payments below $50,000 equivalent. \n \n\nthe  Bangladesh  Bank \n\nimmediately  after \n\nfor \n\n\fImplementation Period \nand Startup Activities \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\nvii \n\nimprovement  of  basic  urban \n\nBased  on  the  experience  of  Secondary  Towns  Infrastructure \nDevelopment  I  and  II,  and  in  view  of  the  sector  modality  of  the \nProject,  and  the  large  number  and  geographical  spread  of \nparticipating  Pourashavas,  the  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a \nperiod of 6 years. Implementation is expected to commence in the \nsecond  quarter  of  2003.  Start-up  activities  (after  Loan  Approval) \nwill  include  the  following:  (i)  establishment  of  the  national  and \nregional  UMSUs  (LGED);  (ii)  recruitment  of  project  staff  for  the \nPMO  and  PIUs  (LGED  and  Pourashavas);  (iii)  selection  and \nrecruitment  of  consultants  (LGED);  (iv)  preparation  of  strategic \ndevelopment  vision  (Pourashavas);  (v)  preparation  of  subproject \nappraisal  reports  for  the  Phase  1  work  program  (LGED  and \nPourashavas);  and  (vi)  procurement  of  immediately  required \nequipment (LGED). Physical works may not start before the fourth \nquarter  of  2003  due  to  the  need  to  undertake  extensive  surveys \nand prepare detailed engineering designs and contract documents. \n \nAll  current  1,836,000  citizens  of  the  project  towns,  representing \naround  6%  of  the  total  urban  population  are  expected  to  benefit, \ndirectly or indirectly, from the Project. This will be achieved mainly \nfacilities \nthrough \nincluding  roads  (400  kilometers  [km]  and  at  least  25  bridges)  and \ndrainage systems (260 km). Regarding the latter, it is expected that \naround  650,000  people  will  benefit  from  reduced  flooding  and \ngreater  productivity.  Particular  attention  will  also  be  given  to \nimproving  the  living  conditions  of  the  urban  poor  (estimated \n120,000  people  or  around  7%  of  the  beneficiaries),  through \ncommunity-based  environmental  improvement  works  and  slum \nimprovement  activities.  Further,  the  implementation  of  the  Project \nwill  require  almost  10,000  person-years  of  unskilled  laborers  of \nwhich  at  least  one  third  will  be  women.  Through  the  provision  of \nmicrocredit,  income-generating  activities  will  be  supported  in \nparticularly for women in low-income areas. \n \nIt is estimated that, upon completion of the Project (2009), around \n20,000 households will have improved domestic sanitary facilities, \nwhile  the  general  public  will  have  better  access  to  community \ntoilets.  Improved  solid  waste  management  (currently  around  50% \nof the waste is collected and disposed of) will improve health and \nenvironmental  conditions.  The  planning  assumption  is  that,  in \n2011,  all  Pourashavas  should  have  the  facilities  to  reach  a  waste \ncollection and disposal efficiency of at least 70%.  \n \n\ninfrastructure \n\nRisks and Assumptions  While  no  unusual  risks  are  foreseen  during  implementation,  the \npotential  risks  concern  (i)  delays  in  implementation  due  to  slow \nprogress  with  start-up  activities;  (ii)  lack  of  suitably  qualified \npersonnel in the Pourashavas which may eventually lead to weak \nimplementation  of  subprojects  at  the  Pourashava  level;  and  (iii) \nsustainability  of  the  facilities  and  services  provided  under  the \nProject. \n\n\fviii \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\n \n \n\nidentified  during \n\nthe  policy  dialogue  with \n\nrecurrent  arrears  of  such \n\nThe  accompanying  TA  for  Supporting  Urban  Governance  Reform \nwill  provide  necessary  technical  and  secretarial  support  to  the \nCommittee  on  Urban  Local  Governments  in  the  key  policy  areas \nthat  were \nthe \nGovernment:  (i)  in  consultation  with  various  stakeholders  in  the \nurban sector, prepare the National Urban Sector Policy for cabinet \napproval,  containing  recommendations,  among  others,  on  the \napproach to be followed in the process and pattern of urbanization \nin  Bangladesh;  (ii)  review  the  existing  holding  tax  system  in  the \ncountry  and  suggest  reforms  for  improving  collection  of  holding \ntaxes from public and private sector entities as well as solving the \nproblem  of \n(iii)  make \nrecommendations  for  the  amendment  of  the  1977  Pourashava \nOrdinance to reflect the needs for improved local governance and \nbetter urban management; and (iv) review the Government\u2019s long-\nterm  strategy  for  municipal  development  (covering  upazila  towns \nand  Pourashavas)  and  make  recommendations  for  preparing  a \nmaster plan for future development of these key urban centers. \n \nThe total cost of the TA is estimated at $520,000 equivalent. ADB \nwill finance $400,000 equivalent, on a grant basis, covering all the \nforeign exchange costs ($85,000) and part of local costs from the \nADB-funded TA program. \n \nThe  Committee  will  be  supported  by  a  full  time  secretariat  to  be \nestablished at LGED, under the overall supervision of the secretary \nof LGD.

The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for \nSupporting Urban Governance Reform, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nUrban Sector Performance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \n2. \nRecognizing diseconomies of congestion and environmental degradation in metropolitan \ncities,  the  Government  has  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  continue  to \nprovide  assistance  to  the  urban  sector  for  rehabilitation  and  expansion  of  urban  development \nand services in secondary towns (Pourashavas) throughout the country, and to further assist in \nthe  decentralization  and  strengthening  of  urban  governance.  In  response,  ADB  provided  two \nproject  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)1 grants  to  undertake  a  feasibility  study  and \nproject preparation. This Report is based on the findings of these PPTAs, and the discussions \nwith  all  stakeholders  during  the  TA  review,  loan  fact-finding,  and  appraisal  missions. 2  The \nproject framework is in Appendix 1, which summarizes the objectives, scope, and approach of \nthe Project.  \n \nA. \n \n3. \nUrbanization.  In  2001,  the  total  urban  population  in  Bangladesh  was  about  30  million, \nrepresenting  approximately  23%  of  the  national  population.  While  this  level  of  urbanization  is \nrelatively low by Asian standards, the urban population grew at an annual rate of about 3.5% in \n1991-2000,  compared  with  the  national  population  growth  rate  of  1.5%.  The  growth  rates  of \nPourashavas range from relatively low in most (at around 2%), to moderately high (up to 4.5%) \nin a few cases. The growth of the urban population in Bangladesh is mainly due to the growth of \nmetropolitan cities.  \n \n4. \nContribution to Economic Growth. Rapid urbanization has contributed to the growing \nshare of the urban sector in overall economic growth. Over 40% of the country's gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) is now derived from the urban sector, from a low of 25% in the early 1970s. The \nGovernment\u2019s  Fifth  Five-Year  Plan  (1997-2002)  projected  that  the  urban  sector  GDP  would \ngrow  at  around  14%  per  annum,  which  is  more  than  twice  the  growth  target  for  the  national \nGDP.    \n \n5. \nUrban  Poverty. The incidence of poverty in Bangladesh, as measured by the costs of \nbasic  needs  poverty  line,  fell  from  58.8%  in  FY1992  to  49.8%  in  2000.  A  sector  breakdown \nshows  that  progress  in  reducing  poverty  was  almost  equal  across  urban  and  rural  areas:  the \nurban  headcount  ratio  declined  from  44.9%  to  36.6%  (by  8.3%)  while  rural  poverty  declined \nfrom 61.2% to 53.0% (by 8.2%). However, the moderate reduction in urban poverty during the \nlast  decade  was  accompanied  by  a  notable  increase  in  urban  income  inequality,  as  the  Gini \ncoefficient increased from 0.398 to 0.452.  \n\n \n6. \nThe  situations  have  been  somewhat  different  in  the  case  of  absolute  numbers  of  the \npoor in urban and rural areas. In FY1992, the number of urban poor population was 6.5 million \nwhen total urban population was 14.6 million. This then increased to 9.3 million in 2000. Thus \nthere has been at least a 43% growth of the urban poor population during the last decade. The \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1997. Technical Assistance to Bangladesh for Third Urban Development (TUDP). Manila. With a significant \ndelay  in  the  processing  of  the  subsequent  loan  project,  ADB  provided  a  follow-up  TA  in  2001  for  Urban \nGovernance  and  Infrastructure  Improvement  Project  to  update  the  findings  of  the  earlier  TA  and  reformulate  the \nProject as a sector loan. \n\n2  Project processing chronology is included in Supplementary Appendix A. \n\n\f2 \n\n1. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nSlow Progress in Policy and Institutional Reform \n\nrural  poor  population,  on  the  other  hand,  recorded  a  decline  in  absolute  number  from  57.6 \nmillion to 53.5 million. The principal reason behind this phenomenon is the large-scale shift of \nthe  rural  population  to  the  urban  areas  in  the  hope  of  better  economic  opportunities.  If  the \ncurrent trend of migration continues, the urban poor will increase to 25-30% of the country's total \npoor by 2020, if not more. These facts point to the growing need to address urban poverty both \nas  an  aspect  of  a  new  dimension  of  poverty  (relative  to  rural  poverty)  and  as  a  matter  of \nincreasing priority to reducing poverty. \n \n7. \nUrban Infrastructure and Basic Services.  There are deficiencies in all urban services. \nOnly  30%  of  urban  households  use  tap  water  for  drinking,  and  probably  less  than  20%  have \ntheir  own  house  connections.  With  the  exception  of  a  limited  waterborne  sewerage  system  in \nDhaka, no other urban center has any form of sewerage system. Solid waste collection levels \nare around 20%. Urban areas also suffer from severe traffic congestion and the absence of any \nform of mass public transit system. For most urban residents, housing conditions are very bad. \nOnly 25% of urban households live in dwellings with permanent structure.  Very high land prices, \ninsecurity of tenure, and a lack of housing finance have handicapped the growth of the formal \nsector of the housing market. In most urban centers, ambient air and water quality is extremely \npoor. The major sources of air pollution are traffic, brickfields, and industry. The major sources \nof  water  pollution  are  domestic  and  industrial  wastewater  discharges.  Inadequate  drainage \nincreases the exposure of the urban population to the effects of polluted water.  \n \nB. \n \n \n \n8. \nRecent  experience  in  Bangladesh  suggests  that  urbanization  needs  to  be  seen  in  a \npositive  light.  The  poverty  reducing  potential  of  well-planned  and  decentralized  urbanization  is \nimmense,  especially  in  the  longer  term.  However,  unplanned  and  uncontrolled  urbanization \ncreates  tremendous  pressure  on  basic  urban  infrastructure  and  eventually  limits  the  growth \npotential of the national economy. Moreover, the concentration of population and activities in a \nfew  metropolitan  areas  tends  to  further  aggravate  urban  environmental  conditions  in  the \nabsence of adequate capacity to manage urban growth (a summary of urban sector analysis is \npresented in Appendix 2).  \n \nThe  Government  is  therefore  developing  secondary  towns  to  improve  their  living \n9. \nstandards, particularly in the poorer areas, and to provide an alternative to those who would join \nthe  migration  to  the  larger  metropolitan  cities.  ADB  has  been  assisting  the  Government  to \nachieve  these  goals  since  1990  through  the  Secondary  Towns  Infrastructure  Development \nProjects  I  and  II 3  (STIDP  I  and  II).  So  far,  ADB  has  supported  upgrading  of  municipal \ninfrastructure  facilities  in  32  of  64  district  towns  in  Bangladesh.  The  World  Bank  is  currently \ncovering  another  14  district  towns  under  its  Municipal  Services  Project  (external  assistance  in \nthe  sector  is  summarized  in  Appendix  3).  With  the  implementation  of  the  proposed  Project, \nalmost  all  district  towns  in  Bangladesh  will  be  provided  with  necessary  financial  and  technical \nassistance to improve basic urban infrastructure and management of urban affairs.   \n \n10. \nThe  implementation  of  physical  works  under  the  past  and  ongoing  projects  has  been \nsatisfactory. However, the progress in institutional reform, an integral part of all urban projects, \nhas  been  much  slower  than  originally  anticipated.  In  fact,  the  slow  progress  made  on \ninstitutional  reform  is  a  reflection  of  poor  governance  and  lack  of  accountability  on  the  side  of \nthe  participating  municipalities  in  urban  management.  Good  urban  governance  and  effective \nmanagement are a prerequisite for well-functioning cities. Past experience shows that physical \ninfrastructure improvement cannot be sustained unless the underlying governance problems are \n                                                 \n3   ADB.  1990.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Secondary Towns Infrastructure Development Project. Manila; ADB. 1995. \nReport  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of Bangladesh for the Secondary Towns Infrastructure Development Project II. Manila. \n\n\f3 \n\n2. \n\nPromoting Good Urban Governance \n\naddressed  first.  For  this  reason,  it  was  decided  to  redesign  the  earlier  prepared  Third  Urban \nDevelopment  Project  and  adopt  a  new  performance-based  approach  in  which  participating \nmunicipalities  are  made  accountable  for  their  performance  in  implementing  action-based \nprograms for better urban governance.  \n \n \n \n11. \nUrban  governance  is  broadly  defined  as  \"the  sum  of  the  many  ways  individuals  and \ninstitutions, public and private, plan and manage the common affairs of the city.\u201d4 Two aspects \nof this broad definition need further elaboration. First, it indicates that urban governance is not \njust government. Governance as a concept recognizes that decision-making power to improve \nthe  affairs  of  the  city  exists  inside  and  outside  the  formal  authority  and  institutions  of \ngovernment.  In  other  words,  governance  includes  the  government,  private  sector,  and  civil \nsociety.  The  second  aspect  emphasizes  that  urban  governance  is  a  \"process.\"  It  is  a \nparticipatory  process  through  which  diverse  interests  of  the  city  may  be  accommodated  and \ncooperative action can be taken.  \n \n12. \nThrough  extensive  interviews  and  consultations  with  the  Pourashavas  during  the \nimplementation  of  the  PPTA,  it  became  evident  that  most  of  the  Project  towns  have  a  poor \nrecord  in  terms  of  public  participation  in  urban  management.  Promoting  decentralization  of \nauthority  and  powers  to  Pourashavas  will  not  produce  any  desirable  result  unless  there  is  a \ncommensurate  increase  in  the  delegation  of  powers  from  the  Pourashava  chairpersons  to \nelected commissioners and to citizen groups. The key to the gains in efficiency associated with \ndecentralization  is  the  accountability  of  elected  officials,  especially  the  chairpersons,  to  local \nresidents.  Increasing  accountability  will  require  more  participation  of  citizens  in  Pourashava \naffairs.  \n \n13. \nOverall,  there  are  two  outstanding  considerations  under  the  Project  for  improving \nPourashava governance: First is a concern for the concentration of authority and powers in the \nhands of the Pourashava chairperson, which results in poor performance, inefficiency, and lack \nof accountability, much to the detriment of good governance. The second is a concern for weak \ncapacity of elected commissioners, local public officials, and community groups; this becomes \nconcern for the limited scope for increasing the role of municipal council, and ward and citizens \ncommittees in running municipal affairs.  \n \n14. \nTo effectively address these main concerns, an Urban Governance Improvement Action \nProgram (UGIAP) has been developed in close consultation with the participating Pourashavas. \nOverall,  the  UGIAP  comprises  five  subprograms:  three  for  enhancing  the  awareness  and  the \nparticipation  of  local  stakeholders  in  urban  planning  and  management  (citizen  awareness  and \nparticipation,  women\u2019s  participation,  and  integration  of  the  urban  poor)  and  two  for  improving \naccountability  and  transparency  (financial  accountability  and  sustainability,  and  administrative \ntransparency). Under these subprograms, Pourashavas will be asked to form town-level citizens \ncommittees,  develop  participatory  municipal  development  plan,  strengthen  the  role  of  female \nward  commissioners,  implement  poverty  reduction  action  programs,  operate  microcredit \nprogram for the poor women, and increase tax collection. \n \n15.  While the ultimate responsibility for urban governance rests with urban local bodies, the \nrole  of  the  Central  Government  is  also  important.  On  the  fiscal  side,  the  Central  Government \ndirectly  supports  centrally  funded  municipal  projects  and  has  statutory  control  over  different \naspects  of  municipal  revenues  and  expenditures.  A  central  government  ministry,  Ministry  of \nLocal  Government,  Rural  Development  and  Cooperatives  (MLGRDC),  is  responsible  for \nsupervision of municipal affairs, the scope of which includes demanding records, inspection of \nactivities, and revoking illegal orders and decisions of municipal governments. Given the large \nnumber of the central government agencies involved in planning, building, and managing urban \n\n                                                 \n4  UN-Habitat definition of good urban governance. \n\n\f4 \n\ninfrastructure, the review of the functions and structure of the central government ministries and \nagencies in urban development is included under the project\u2019s accompanying TA. The focus of \nthe  review  is  based  on  the  principle  that  the  role  of  central  government  agencies  should  be \nmore of facilitator or supporter than of doer or implementer for the sake of long-term benefit of \nthe local governments.     \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nObjectives \n\n \nA. \n \n16. \nThe primary objective of the Project is to promote human development and good urban \ngovernance in secondary towns of Bangladesh. To achieve this objective, the Project will assist \nthe  selected  Pourashavas  to  (i)  enhance  accountability  in  municipal  management  and \nstrengthen their capabilities in the provision of municipal services; and (ii) develop and expand \nphysical  infrastructure  and  urban  services  to  increase  economic  opportunities,  and  to  reduce \nvulnerability to environmental degradation, poverty, and natural hazards. While the Project will \nbenefit the entire urban community in general, some of its components will focus on upgrading \nthe conditions of the poorest and most needy groups in the slum areas in particular. The Project \nwill also promote active participation of women citizens in municipal management and services \nas both beneficiaries and agents.    \n \nThe  Project  will  use  a  performance-based  sector  loan  approach.  To  be  included  in  the \n17. \nProject,  municipalities  are  required  to  implement  the  UGIAP.  Initially,  all  participating \nPourashavas will be given limited funds to cover the most urgent investment requirements.  The \ncontinuing participation in the sector Project, however, will depend on the actual progress made \nwith the implementation of the UGIAP. This suggests a significant improvement from a previous \napproach  in  which  all  investment  components  were  predetermined  at  the  time  of  project \nappraisal  and  the  participating  Pourashavas  were  left  unaccountable  for  their  performance \nduring  project  implementation.  Such  a  blueprint  approach  adopted  in  the  past  has  failed  in  its \ncommitment  to  bring  about  sustainable  improvements  in  urban  management  because  of  the \nbasically supply-driven nature of resource allocation. Thus, an alternative approach is employed \nunder  the  Project,  involving  demand-driven  allocation  of  loan  proceeds,  which  is  based  on \nclearly defined performance criteria and the commitment to undertake governance reform. \n \nB. \n \n18. \nThe Project is formulated as a sector loan based on the Government\u2019s sector investment \nplan  for  Pourashavas  and  will  support  a  6-year  time  and  area  slice  of  the  plan,  representing \n28%  of  estimated  investment  during  2003-2009  and  covering  about  22  Pourashavas.  Overall, \nthe Project meets the criteria for adopting a sector lending modality:5 (i) there is a strong sector \nagency, namely LGED, which has successfully implemented a number of urban projects funded \nby  both  domestic  and  external  resources;  (ii)  MLGRDC  has  adopted  a  comprehensive  Urban \nManagement  Policy,  which  will  guide  urban  development  in  the  country;  and  (iii)  a  credible \nsector investment plan for Pourashavas (as provided in the Government\u2019s Annual Development \nPlan) exists, which has successfully guided sector development so far. \n \nC. \n \n19. \nThe Project comprises three parts. Part A: Urban Infrastructure Improvement covers the \nimprovement/expansion of the following municipal infrastructure facilities (i) roads and bridges, \n(ii)  storm  water  drainage,  (iii)  low-cost  sanitation,  (iv)  solid  waste  management,  (v)  municipal \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nSector Loan Approach \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n5  The  sector  loan  requirements  are  detailed  in  Supplementary  Appendix  B  (LGED  Operations  and  Vision), \nSupplementary Appendix C (Urban Management Policy Statement of MLGRDC), and Supplementary Appendix D \n(Sector Investment Plan). \n\n\f5 \n\nfacilities  (e.g.,  bus  and  truck  terminals,  kitchen  markets,  and  slaughterhouses),  and  (vi)  slum \nimprovement.  Under  specific  circumstances,  inclusion  of  water  supply  rehabilitation  schemes \nwill also be considered.6 Part B: Urban Governance Improvement includes implementation of an \naction  program  in  five  key  result  areas:  (i)  citizen  awareness  and  participation,  (ii)  women\u2019s \nparticipation, (iii) integration of the urban poor, (iv) financial accountability and sustainability, and \n(v)  administrative  transparency.  In  each  of  these  five  areas,  the  Pourashavas  will  need  to \nachieve well-defined performance targets, which will be closely monitored and evaluated during \nproject  implementation.  Part  C:  Capacity  Building  and  Implementation  Assistance  covers  (i) \nproject  management,  detailed  engineering  design,  construction  supervision,  nongovernment \norganization  (NGO)  support  to  community-based  activities,  and  facilitation  of  community \nmobilization;  and  (ii)  institutional  capacity  building  programs  for  Pourashavas  to  successfully \nimplement  the  UGIAP,  including  (a)  an  orientation  program  for  Pourashava  chairpersons  and \nward  commissioners,  (b)  a  tailored  program  for  female  ward  commissioners,  (c)  training \nprograms  for  secretaries  to  implement  the  community-based  activities  under  the  UGIAP,  (d) \ncomputerization  of  tax  records  and  billing,  (e)  computerization  of  accounting  management,  (f) \ninfrastructure  inventory  assessment  and  mapping,    and  (g)  training  for  decentralized  township \nplanning. \n \n \n \n20. \nFunds  will  be  made  available  to  the  Pourashavas  under  Part  A:  Urban  Infrastructure \nImprovement in three phases that coincide with performance under Part B: Urban Governance \nImprovement.  For  the  Part  A  investments,  each  Pourashava  will  prepare  a  subproject \ncomprising a package of urban infrastructure improvements. The following components will be \neligible for financing under each subproject. \n \n \n \n21. \nThe  component  will  include  the  improvement  of  the  Pourashavas\u2019  road  networks  and \ntraffic circulation, largely through the rehabilitation, repair, and widening of existing roads within \nthe urban core area, traffic management improvements, and procurement of equipment to keep \nthe road system in a good condition.  \n \n\nPart A: Urban Infrastructure Improvement \n\nRoads and Bridges \n\na. \n\n1. \n\n \n\nb. \n\nStormwater Drainage \n\n \n22. \nThe stormwater drainage improvements are intended to alleviate major inundation from \nrainfall  and  reduce  waterlogging  problems  within  the  core  urban  area  of  the  Pourashava.  The \nworks  include  (i)  elimination  of  all  blockages/obstructions  and  encroachments  on  existing \ndrainage paths, (ii) cleaning and rehabilitation of existing drains, (iii) construction of new drains \nto serve previously unserviced areas, and (iv) construction of missing links.  \n \n\nc. \n\nLow-Cost Sanitation \n\n \n23. \nThe  sanitation  component  comprises  a  program  for  the  provision  of  double-vault  pit \nlatrines  and  the  construction  of  public  toilet  blocks.  It  is  proposed  to  construct  a  total  of  about \n12,000 household or private double-vault pit latrines, and 84 public toilets.  \n\n                                                 \n6  Water  supply  components  will  consist  mainly  of  rehabilitation  of  the  water  supply  systems  and  provision  of \nequipment  for  operation  and  maintenance.  Given  the  widespread  arsenic  contamination  of  groundwater  in  the \ncountry,  the  implementation  of  any  tubewell  works  will  be  strictly  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  guidelines  and \nstandards for the development of deep tubewells. No shallow tubewell work will be undertaken under the Project \ndue to possible arsenic contamination. If the scope of the water supply work exceeds normal rehabilitation of the \nsystem,  the  implementation  of  the  water  supply  component  may  be  referred  to  the  Department  of  Public  Health \nEngineering with LGED as an implementing agency. \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nd. \n\nSolid Waste Management \n\n \n24. \nThis  component  will  improve  collection  efficiencies  to  70%  of  household  wastes  and \n95%  of  other  (commercial,  institutional,  and  hospital)  wastes  within  the  core  urban  areas,  and \nensure improved arrangements for disposal. The component will provide for the procurement of \ngarbage  trucks,  pushcarts,  and  communal  concrete  garbage  bins  in  order  to  improve  the \nstorage and collection of wastes. Landfill sites will be developed to facilitate controlled disposal \nof the waste. \n \n\ne. \n\nMunicipal Facilities \n\n \n25. \nTo promote economic and commercial development in the towns and encourage public-\nprivate  partnerships,  it  is  proposed  to  construct,  extend  or  rehabilitate  bus  terminals,  kitchen \nmarkets,  and  slaughterhouses  in  the  Pourashavas.  In  a  Pourashava  where  there  is  an  acute \nneed for additional parking facilities for trucks, and where there is very limited land available, it \nis proposed to construct a truck terminal. \n \n \n\nf. \n\nSlum Upgrading \n\n \n26. \nA component for the provision of services to the urban poor will be implemented in each \nPourashava.  The  component  is  expected  to  assist  about  18,000  slum  families  (120,000  slum \ndwellers) through the improvement of overall living conditions using an integrated approach that \nincludes provision of basic urban services (e.g., access, water supply, drainage, sanitation, and \nsolid waste management), and supporting health and literacy development activities.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPart B: Urban Governance Improvement  \n\n \n27. \nLocal  level  reform  will  be  implemented  through  the  UGIAP.  In  exchange  for  receiving \nfinancial assistance under the Project, Pourashavas will enter into a subproject agreement with \nthe Government represented by LGED to implement the action program in five key result areas. \nThe  implementation  of  the  UGIAP  will  be  in  three  phases  over  6  years.  It  will  take  2  years  to \ncomplete each phase. The receipt by Pourashavas of funds for subprojects under Part A: Urban \nInfrastructure  Improvement  during  the  second  and  third  phases  will  depend  on  performance \nunder Part B.  \n \n\na. \n\nPhase 1 \n\n \n28. \nAll 22 Pourashavas identified under the PPTA will be included in phase 1 and they will \nsign a subproject agreement with the Government to participate in phase 1. While undertaking \nthe urban infrastructure improvement components for phase 1, the Pourashavas will be required \nto  carry  out  various  reform  activities  as  stipulated  in  the  UGIAP  (Appendix  4),  with  assistance \nfrom LGED. The performance of the Pourashavas will be closely monitored by the Government \nand  ADB  to  determine  their  eligibility  for  phase  2  of  the  Project.  The  investment  ceiling  for \nimplementation  of  the  urban  infrastructure  components  in  phase  1  is  set  at  around  25-30%  of \nthe  total  investment  requirement  assessed  for  each  Pourashava  during  the  PPTA.  During  the \nfield  visits  under  TA.  No  3690 7 ,  high  priority  investment  components  for  phase  1  (mainly \nrehabilitation  work  for  roads  and  drainage  systems)  were  identified  and  confirmed  with  the \nPourashavas (Appendix 5).   \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n7   ADB. 2001.

If a Pourashava fails to meet any of \nthe minimum performance targets specified in the UGIAP, it will not be allowed to proceed to the \nsecond  phase.  On  the  other  hand,  those  Pourashavas  that  meet  the  minimum  performance \ntargets will be further rated into two groups \u2212 fully satisfactory (i.e., meeting all of the criteria for \nfully  satisfactory  performance  under  the  UGIAP)  and  partly  satisfactory  (i.e.,  meeting  only  the \nminimum  requirements).  The  fully  satisfactory  Pourashavas  will  be  provided  with  a  bigger \nbudget (up to 40% of the total investment requirement assessed during the PPTA) for phase 2, \nwhile  the  partly  satisfactory  Pourashavas  will  be  given  a  lower  budget  (up  to  20%  of  the  total \ninvestment required). Phase 2 will also be open to all Pourashavas under categories A and B \nthat are not included under phase 1 and are satisfactory to the Government and ADB. Where a \nnew Pourashava applies to participate in the Project, its application will be evaluated based on \nseparate entry criteria (Appendix 4). The eligible Pourashavas will sign a subproject agreement \nwith  LGED  to  participate  in  phase  2,  covering  up  to  20%  of  the  total  investment  demand \nassessed by the PMO. The total number of Pourashavas covered under the second phase will \nnot exceed 30.    \n \n \n \n30. \nFinally, the entry into phase 3 will depend on the performance during the second phase. \nOnly those Pourashavas, that maintain a fully satisfactory rating during phase 2 will proceed to \nthe  final  phase  to  fully  utilize  the  financial  assistance  offered  through  the  Project  for  urban \ninfrastructure  improvements  components.  In  this  way,  Pourashavas  that  were  previously  rated \nas partly satisfactory can enter phase 3 only after their performance has improved to the level of \nfully satisfactory. No new Pourashava will be admitted in phase 3. The eligible Pourashavas will \nenter into formal agreements with the Government to participate in phase 3.  \n \n31. \nFor  the  successful  implementation  of  the  performance-based  approach,  the  application \nof  performance  criteria  must  be  done  in  a  transparent  and  balanced  manner.  The  final \nresponsibility to decide the ratings (unsatisfactory, partly satisfactory, or fully satisfactory) of the \nparticipating Pourashavas will be delegated to the Pourashava Performance Review Committee \n(PPRC)  which  will  be  established  within  the  Local  Government  Division  (LGD)  of  MLGRDC.8 \nWhile  PPRC  will  be  given  the  overall  responsibility  for  reviewing  the  performance  of  the \nPourashavas,  technical  and  secretarial  support  will  be  provided  by  the  Urban  Management \nSupport Unit of LGED (para. 33). PPRC will consist of the secretary of LGD (as a chair), chief \nengineer of LGED, director general of LGD, representatives from the Planning Commission and \nthe Economics Relations Division (ERD) of the Ministry of Finance (MOF), a representative from \nthe  Implementation  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Division  (IMED)  of  the  Planning  Ministry,  a \nrenowned  urban  governance  specialist  nominated  by  LGD,  an  ADB  representative,  and  the \ndirector of the national Urban Management Support Unit (UMSU) as the member secretary. \n \n \n \n32. \nimplementation  assistance  component  comprises  (i) \nstrengthening  of  the  urban  management  wing  of  LGED,  and  (ii)  consulting  services  for \nsubproject design and supervision and institutional strengthening of the Pourashavas.  \n\nPart C: Capacity Building and Implementation Assistance \n\nThe  capacity-building  and \n\n3. \n\n                                                 \n8 LGD  has  already  established  the  Municipal  Performance  Review  Committee  (MPRC)  to  review  and  evaluate  the \nperformance  of  all  municipalities  in  Bangladesh  under  the  World  Bank's  Municipal  Services  Project  (MSP).  The \nproposed PPRC will be project-based for providing timely evaluation of the performance of the Pourashavas under \nthe Project and will be absorbed under MPRC once the Project is completed. \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\na. \n\nEstablishment of the Urban Management Support Unit \n\n \n \n \n33. \nRecognizing  the  limitations  of  the  project-based  institutional  strengthening  approach \nadopted under STIDP I and II, the Project will support the 10 regional offices of LGED (including \nthe national office in Dhaka) to provide sustained capacity-building programs to all Pourashavas \nwithin their respective regional boundaries. Past experience indicates that the centrally located \nPourashava  Support  Unit  is  restricted  in  reaching  out  to  the  Pourashavas  and  providing \nsustained  support.  For  this  purpose,  a  new  wing  for  urban  management  has  been  recently \nestablished in LGED to facilitate the development of targeted capacity-building programs for all \nurban local bodies and to coordinate regional training activities across the country.  In addition, \nto  best  utilize  the  available  resources  for  capacity  building,  the  existing  Pourashava  Support \nUnit (ADB-sponsored) will be merged with the Municipal Support Unit (World Bank-sponsored), \nand  both  will  be  absorbed  under  the  single  umbrella  of  UMSU.  Given  the  limited  resources, \nhowever,  only  the  larger  Pourashavas  (category  A  and  larger  category  B) 9  will  be  initially \ncovered to receive training for their elected officials as well as their key staff.  \n \n\nb. \n\nInstitutional Strengthening of Pourashavas \n\n \n\nc. \n\nImplementation Assistance for Project Pourashavas \n\n \n34. \nOnce  established,  UMSU  will  provide  comprehensive  training  opportunities  to  help \nPourashavas  mobilize  additional  financial  resources  and  improve  revenue  collection  and \nfinancial  management.  Specific  training  programs  to  be  provided  by  UMSU  include  (i)  an \norientation  program  for  Pourashava  chairpersons  and  ward  commissioners,  (ii)  a  tailored \nprogram for female ward commissioners, (iii) training programs for secretaries to implement the \ncommunity-based activities under the UGIAP, (iv) computerization of tax records and billing, (v) \ncomputerization  of  accounting  management,  (vi)  infrastructure  inventory  assessment  and \nmapping, and (vii) training for decentralized township planning. \n \n \n \nProject implementation assistance includes (i) project management and implementation \n35. \nsupport,  detailed  engineering  design,  procurement,  disbursement,  construction  supervision, \nbudgeting,  reporting,  and  overall  project  performance  monitoring;  (ii)  support  to  subproject \npreparation  and  appraisal;  and  (iii)  NGO  support  to  community-based  activities  for  urban \npoverty reduction.   \n \nD. \n \nIn accordance with the sector loan approach, most of the investment will be decided on \n36. \nattainment  of  performance  criteria  by  the  Pourashavas  during  project  implementation.  The \nproject  cost  presented  in  Table  1  is  based  on  the  provisions  made  in  the  previous  feasibility \nstudy in the Third Urban Development Project as well as the discussions held with Pourashavas \nduring  the  field  visits.  The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $87.0  million  equivalent, \nincluding  about  $5.9  million  equivalent  for  duties  and  taxes.  The  foreign  exchange  cost  is \nestimated  at  $21.5  million,  or  about  25%  of  the  total  project  cost,  including  $1.7  million  for \ninterest  on  the  ADB  loan  during  construction.  The  local  currency  cost  is  estimated  at  $65.5 \nmillion  equivalent,  or  about  75%  of  the  total  project  cost.  Detailed  project  cost  estimates  are \nprovided in Appendix 6.  \n\nCost Estimates \n\n                                                 \n9   Based on the Government\u2019s classification.   \n\n\f9 \n\n \n\nComponenta \n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ Million) \n\n \nPart A: Urban Infrastructure Improvement  \nPart B: Urban Governance Improvement \nPart C: Capacity Building and Implementation Assistance \nInterest During Construction \n \n                 Total \n\n \n\na  Includes taxes and duties. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nForeign \nExchange \n \n17.6\n0.4\n1.8\n1.7\n\n21.5\n\nLocal \nCurrency \n \n47.1 \n4.5 \n11.3 \n2.6 \n \n65.5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nTotal \nCost \n \n\n64.7  \n4.9\n13.1\n4.3\n\n87.0\n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \nE. \n \n37. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  in  the  amount  of  SDR  45,461,000  ($60  million \nequivalent)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  which  will  represent  about  69%  of  the  total \nProject cost. The loan will cover the entire foreign exchange costs including the interest on the \nADB  loan  and  part  of  the  local  currency  costs,  excluding  taxes  and  duties.  A  domestic \ncontribution of $27 million equivalent is required which will include $22.8 million equivalent from \nthe Government, $3.9 million equivalent from the Pourashavas, and $0.3 million equivalent from \nthe  project  beneficiaries.  The  Borrower  will  be  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh.  ADB\u2019s \nfinancing  of  local  currency  expenditure  is  justified  by  the  nature  of  the  Project,  which  will \nimprove the living and health conditions of the people in the project areas by improving existing \nunsanitary conditions, decongesting traffic and preventing damage to property and disruption of \nlives caused by flooding. The proposed financing plan for the Project is shown in Table 2. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ Million) \n\n \nSource \n \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) \nGovernment \nPourashavas \nBeneficiaries \n \n            Total \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nForeign \nExchange \n \n21.5\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n\nLocal \nCurrency \n \n38.5\n22.8\n3.9\n0.3\n\n21.5\n\n65.5\n\nTotal \nCost \n \n60.0 \n22.8 \n3.9 \n0.3 \n \n87.0 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nPercent \n\n \n69.0\n26.1\n4.5\n0.4\n\n100.0\n\n \n38. \nThe  ADB  loan  together  with  the  Government  contribution,  will  be  provided  to  the \nExecuting Agency to finance the Project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  8  years,  an  interest  rate  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per \nannum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the Loan Agreement.  The \nloan  proceeds  for  part  A  will  be  provided  to  the  Pourashavas  in  a  blend  of  grant  funds  and \nloans, the latter for investment in revenue generating or direct cost recovery works pursuant to \nsubsidiary loan agreements. The subsidiary loans will be provided to the Pourashavas at an on-\nlending  rate  of  7%  per  annum  for  a  period  of  20  years,  including  a  5-year  grace  period.  The \nGovernment  will  be  responsible  for  the  repayment  of  the  ADB  loan  and  will  bear  the  foreign \nexchange risk.  \n\n\f10 \n\n \nF. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \n\na. \n\nArrangements at the Central Level \n\n \n \n \n39. \nThe Executing Agency of the Project will be LGED, under the overall supervision of LGD \nof  MLGRDC.  An  interministerial  steering  committee  chaired  by  the  secretary  of  LGD  will  be \nestablished  to  oversee  the  Project,  and  will  consist  of  senior-level  representatives  from  LGD, \nLGED,  the  Planning  Commission,  ERD,  the  Finance  Division  of  MOF,  IMED,  the  National \nInstitute  for  Local  Government,  the  Department  of  Public  Health  Engineering,  the  Ministry  of \nWomen and Children Affairs, and representatives of the Pourashavas. The steering committee \nwill be established and will hold its first meeting within 3 months of the effectiveness date of the \nProject. The steering committee will meet at least once every 6 months to review the progress \nof  the  Project  and  guide  the  future  direction.  LGED  will  set  up  a  project  management  office \n(PMO), led by a full-time project director (PD) at the level of a superintending engineer. The PD \nof the Project will be charged exclusively with its execution and will have no other duties within \nthe  urban  management  wing  of  LGED.  The  PD,  supported  by  the  PMO,  will  coordinate  all \nactivities  under  the  Project;  will  be  directly  responsible  for  overall  project  implementation, \nmonitoring, and supervision under the guidance of the director of the urban management wing \nof LGED (at the rank of additional chief engineer or superintending engineer); and will report to \nchief engineer. Overall implementation arrangements are in Appendix 7. \n \n40. \nThe  PMO  will  (i)  prepare  the  overall  Project  implementation  plan  and  consolidated \nannual  work  plan,  (ii)  assist  Pourashavas  in  implementing  the  UGIAP,  (iii)  assist  eligible \nPourashavas  in  preparing  feasibility  studies  and  subproject  appraisal  reports,  (iv)  monitor  and \nsupervise  all  project  management  activities,  (v)  organize  monitoring  and  evaluation  activities, \n(vi) ensure the satisfactory implementation of the gender action plan and other activities under \nthe  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy;  and  (vii)  prepare  necessary  progress \nreports  and  the  project  completion  report.  The  PD  will  be  supported  by  two  deputy  project \ndirectors  (DPDs),  one  for  (i)  technical,  engineering,  and  supervision;  and  one  for  (ii) \nenvironment,  sanitation,  and  slum  improvement  (ESSI).  The  PMO  will  be  properly  staffed  and \nassisted  by  consultants  with  expertise  in  engineering,  finance  and  accounting,  social  and \ngender development, and urban management. In particular, the staffing requirements will reflect \nthe  need  to  accommodate  the  tasks  related  to  urban  governance,  and  to  social  and  gender \ndevelopment.10   \n \n \n \n41. \nIn each participating Pourashava, a project implementation unit (PIU) will be established \nas  soon  as  the  Pourashava  enters  into  a  subproject  agreement  with  LGED.  The  PIU  will  be \nheaded  by  the  Pourashava  chairperson  and  will  comprise  three  sections:  (i)  infrastructure \nimprovement  section;  (ii)  ESSI  section;  and  (iii)  urban  governance  improvement  section.  The \nchairperson will be assisted by the Pourashava chief executive officer for day-to-day operations \nof the subproject. The PIU will be located within the Pourashava office and will be responsible \nfor  (i)  preparation  of  an  annual  development  program  for  the  respective  Pourashava;  (ii) \npreparation  of  subproject  component  proposals;    (iii)  tendering  of  works  and  services;  (iv) \nimplementation of construction works; (v) implementation of the gender action plan (GAP), the \nUGIAP,  and  a  resettlement  plan  in  accordance  with  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nframework,  if  required;  and  (vi)  accounting  for  expenditures.  Training  of  PIU  staff  will  be \norganized  at  the  beginning  of  the  Project  for  civil  works,  slum  improvement,  sanitation,  and \nregular administrative responsibilities.  \n \n\nArrangements at the Pourashava Level \n\nb. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n10 Details of PMO and PIU staffing are provided in Supplementary Appendix E. \n\n\f11 \n\n42. \nThe  infrastructure  improvement  section,  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  all \nphysical  infrastructure  works,  will  be  led  by  the  head  of  the  engineering  department  of  the \nconcerned  Pourashava.  The  ESSI  section  will  undertake  all  environmental  and  slum \nimprovement  activities  and  will  be  headed  by  the  health  officer  of  the  Pourashava.  Additional \ntechnical  staff  will  be  deputed  from  LGED  to  support  the  municipal  engineer  and  the  health \nofficer.  The  number  of  the  LGED  technical  staff  deputed  to  PIU  (at  the  level  of  sub-assistant \nengineer and work assistant) will depend on the size of the Pourashava and the workload of the \nsubproject.  In  this  way,  a  maximum  transfer  of  skills  and  technology  will  be  achieved  and \ncapability further improved. For close supervision of all physical works including environmental \nactivities, the regional superintending engineer of LGED will be empowered to carry out regular \nsupervision,  monitoring,  and  reporting  on  all  project  implementation  activities  to  the  PMO  and \ndirector in charge of the urban management wing. For this purpose, the offices of the regional \nLGED  superintending  engineer  will  be  strengthened  by  two  additional  staff  (one  assistant \nengineer and one sub-assistant engineer). The quality of construction materials will be ensured \nwith the help of LGED\u2019s district laboratory (or other qualified institution).  \n \n43. \nThe urban governance improvement section, headed by the secretary of the Pourashava, \nwill  be  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  the  UGIAP.    For  successful  implementation,  it  is \nimportant to have an accurate assessment of the training requirements at the beginning of the \nProject and to provide Pourashava officials, staff, and other stakeholders with the timely training \nopportunities at the municipal, regional, and national levels. A group of facilitators (as individual \nconsultants) will be engaged to provide the necessary technical support and hands-on training \nat  the  local  level.  In  addition,  the  PMO  will  make  necessary  provisions  to  meet  the  budget \nrequirements of the Pourashavas in supporting the activities under the UGIAP. \n \n44. \nEach PIU will have an accounting section, directly under the Pourashava chairperson, to \ndeal with the procedural aspects and the recording of the financial transactions and preparation \nof  liquidation  statements  and  replenishment  requests  to  the  PMO.  To  assist  the  accounting \nsection to meet additional workload, one accounting assistant will be deputed from LGED. \n \n \n \n45. \nThe  national  UMSU  in  Dhaka  will  be  headed  by  a  full-time  director  at  the  level  of \nadditional  chief  engineer  or  superintending  engineer,  assisted  by  three  deputy  directors,  one \neach  for  (i)  governance  program  development  (GPD),  (ii)  general  administration  and  training \ncoordination, and (iii) database development and performance evaluation and monitoring (PEM). \nThe  GPD  section  will  be  responsible  for  developing  tailor-made  capacity-building  programs \nrelated to the implementation of the UGIAP. The GPD will also develop orientation programs on \nthe objectives, approach, and entry requirements of the Project and arrange training of trainers. \nThe  general  administration  and  training  coordination  section  will  be  responsible  for  general \nadministration  (including  the  budget  and  staffing  requirements  of  the  UMSU)  and  will  also \nassume  responsibility  for  coordinating  training  programs  and  modules  to  be  conducted  by  the \n10  regional  UMSUs.  The  regional  UMSUs  will  be  established  at  the  offices  of  the  regional \nsuperintending  engineer.  Incremental  staff  and  operational  budget  will  be  provided  to  the \nregional  offices  of  LGED  to  organize  and  conduct  training  for  the  Pourashavas  within  their \nrespective  jurisdictions.    Finally,  the  PEM  section  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  and \nevaluation of the performance of the Pourashavas in achieving the targets in the UGIAP. In this \nconnection,  the  PEM  will  also  serve  as  the  secretariat  for  the  PPRC.  Further,  the  PEM  will \nprepare  an  annual  ranking  of  the  performance  of  all  Pourashavas  in  Bangladesh  and \ndisseminate the results to the general public through national media, its own publications, and a \nweb  site.  For  this  purpose,  the  PEM  will  set  up  and  maintain  a  database  for  municipal \nperformance and design a scoring system for performance measurement. \n\nEstablishment of National and Regional UMSUs \n\nc. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nSubproject Appraisal  \n\na. \n\nPhase-1 Pourashavas \n\n \n46. \nThe  participating  Pourashavas  will  be  responsible  for  the  preparation  of  a  vision  paper \noutlining their needs and the development assistance required. In principle, these needs should \nbe  based  on  a  strategic  development  vision,  including  a  draft  land  use  plan  (prepared  in  a \nparticipatory manner). Although all 22 towns under phase 1 have already identified high priority \ninvestment components, the requirement for the preparation of aforesaid overall vision remains, \nsince  it  provides  the  wider  context  of  the  envisaged  developments.  This  activity  should  be \nundertaken  as  early  as  possible  in  time  for  the  preparation  of  the  subproject  appraisal  report \n(SPAR).  \n \nAfter completing the vision paper, each Pourashava, with the assistance of the PMO and \n47. \nthe design consultants, will then prepare the SPAR for ADB's review and approval.  A SPAR will \nbe prepared for each phase describing (i) the visions for municipal development and a declared \ncommitment  to  carry  out  the  UGIAP;  (ii)  the  subproject  need,  rationale,  scope,  target \nbeneficiaries  and  benefits,  potential  constraints,  and  mitigation  measures;  (iii)  subproject \ncomponent  locations,  design  standards,  analysis  of  least-cost  options,  cost  estimates, \nimplementation arrangements and schedule, and procurement arrangements; (iv) environmental \nand  social  assessment  (including  a  resettlement  plan  and/or  indigenous  peoples  plan,  if \nrequired  under  the  applicable  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  policies  and  guidelines);  (v) \nfinancial  and  economic  justification  of  the  subproject  and  its  components;  (vi)  financing  plan, \ntogether  with  financial  sustainability  analysis;  and  (vii)  an  implementation  plan  for  the  UGIAP \nshowing  how  the  Pourashava  will  achieve  the  performance  targets  under  the  Program.  The \nselection of the subproject components will be based on the criteria specified in Appendix 8. \n \n48. \nFollowing  ADB\u2019s  approval,  each  Pourashava  and  the  PMO  will  prepare  a  subproject \nagreement  to  be  signed  by  the  Pourashava  chairperson  and  the  chief  engineer  of  LGED.  A \nsubsidiary loan agreement will also be signed by the Pourashava chairperson and MOF, if the \nsubproject  involves  relending  of  loan  proceeds  from  the  Government  to  the  Pourashava.  No \nfunds  will  be  provided  to  a  Pourashava  under  any  phase  until  the  subproject  agreement  and \nsubsidiary  loan  agreement  (if  required),  both  satisfactory  to  ADB,  have  been  executed.  These \ndocuments will describe any conditions and covenants that must be satisfied by the Pourashava \nbefore and during subproject implementation, including the loan repayment schedule. Subject to \nADB  approval  of  these  two  documents,  implementation  will  proceed  under  the  PMO/PIU \nframework.  \n \n \n \n49.  Where a new Pourashava applies for participation in phase 2, a team from the UMSU\u2019s \nPEM section will visit it to assess the situation and provide guidance on the selection procedure. \nFollowing  the  visit,  the  Pourashava  will  prepare  a  vision  paper,  which  will  provide  detailed \ninformation  on  the  development  assistance  required  and  its  qualification  to  meet  the  entry \ncriteria.  The  request  will  be  submitted  to  the  PPRC  through  the  PEM  section  of  UMSU  for  its \nreview  and  decision.  After  approval  by  the  PPRC,  the  PMO  will  then  proceed  with  the \npreparation of the SPAR for phase 2 of the Project. With the approval of the SPAR by ADB (as \ndescribed in para. 47), the Pourashava will follow the same procedure as described in para. 48 \nfor further processing of the subproject. \n   \n\nNew Pourashavas \n\nb. \n\n \n\nImplementation Period and Start-Up Activities \n\n3. \n \n50. \nBased on the experience of STIDP I and II, and in view of the of the sector modality of \nthe current Project and the large number and geographical spread of participating Pourashavas, \nthe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  6  years.  Implementation  is  expected  to \n\n\f13 \n\ncommence  in  the  third  quarter  of  2003.  Start-up  activities  will  include  the  establishment  of  the \nnational  and  regional  UMSUs,  recruitment  of  project  staff  and  consultants,  preparation  of  the \nSPARs  for  the  phase  1  work  program,  and  procurement  of  immediately  required  equipment. \nPhysical  works  may  not  start  before  the  fourth  quarter  of  2003  due  to  the  need  to  undertake \nextensive surveys, prepare the SPARS for approval, and prepare detailed engineering designs \nand  contract  documents.  Since  the  Project  is  divided  into  three  phases,  the  implementation \nschedule is also built around these three phases (Appendix 9).  \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n \nProcurement  will  generally  be  carried  out  by  the  PIUs  under  the  guidance  of  the  PMO \n51. \nwith the assistance of the LGED district level staff as necessary. All procurement of goods and \nservices financed by ADB will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Since \nthe contracts for civil works will be small and widely dispersed, international competitive bidding \nis not considered appropriate. Consequently, all the civil works contracts will be procured on the \nbasis  of  local  competitive  bidding  among  prequalified  contractors  in  accordance  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  procurement  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Pre-qualification,  selection,  and \nengagement  of  contractors  under  local  competitive  bidding  will  be  subject  to  the  approval  of \nADB.  To  ensure  economy  and  efficiency  in  contract  administration,  small  contracts  for  roads \nand drainage improvement works at various construction sites will be grouped together to obtain \na higher contract value. There will be one contract each for bus terminals, markets, and major \nroad or drainage improvement works. Efforts will be made to limit the number of contracts and \nengage larger professional contractors. This approach will minimize the construction period and \nensure single accountability for the quality of work. Civil works contracts below the statement of \nexpenditures (SOE) limit of $50,000 will be permitted on a case-by-case basis. NGOs may be \nengaged  for  the  purpose  of  coordination  between  the  PIU  and  beneficiaries.  Based  on  the \nlessons from STIDP II, NGOs will not be engaged in civil works, and hardware delivery and they \nwill focus mainly on community participation and provision of microcredit.  \n \n52. \nEach supply contract for equipment or materials estimated to cost the equivalent of more \nthan  $500,000  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international  competitive  bidding,  and  those \ncosting the equivalent of $500,000 or less (other than minor items) but more than $100,000 will \nbe  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international  shopping.  Indicative  procurement  packages  indicate \nthat individual contract packages under the Project will be less than $500,000 in value, in which \ncase  international  shopping  procedures  will  be  followed.  Direct  purchase  procedures  will  be \nused  for  small  or  off-the-shelf  items  valued  at  less  than  $100,000.  Procurement  of  equipment \nwill be done by the PMO. Indicative procurement packages are included in Appendix 10. \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services  \n\n \n53. \nConsulting  services  are  required  to  facilitate  project  implementation  and  to  strengthen \nthe institutional, administrative, and financial capacities of the Pourashavas. Consultants will be \nselected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and \nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  selection  and  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants.11 In  total,  five  packages  of  consulting  services  will  be  provided  under  the  Project: \ntwo  for  the  UMSU  and  three  for  the  PMO.  For  implementation  of  the  UGIAP,  a  firm  will  be \nengaged to the GPD section of the UMSU for developing and testing the training programs and \nfor training LGED staff and others on the delivery of the training programs. To assist the PEM \nsection of the UMSU, individual consultants will be recruited to carry out project-specific as well \nas broad-based monitoring and evaluation of the performance of the Pourashavas. In particular, \nthe  consultants  will  closely  monitor  the  progress  in  achieving  the  targets  in  the  UGIAP  and \nreport to the PPRC for its consideration and decision. The PEM consultants will also develop a \n\n                                                 \n11 Effective  1  April  2002,  the  selection  of  consultants  will  include  the  use  of  the  quality-and-cost-based  selection \nmethod, which involves the simultaneous submission of technical and financial proposals and the use of price as \nan evaluation criteria. \n\n\f14 \n\nnationwide  database  for  continuous  monitoring  and  comparison  of  the  performance  of  all \nPourashavas in the country.  \n\n \n54. \nFor engineering management, design and construction supervision, a consulting firm will \nbe  engaged  to  assist  the  PMO  and  PIUs  in  preparing  surveys,  detailed  engineering  designs, \ncontract  documentation,  tender,  and  supervision  works.  For  monitoring  and  evaluation, \nindividual  consultants  will  be  engaged,  while  the  facilitators  (as  individual  consultants)  will  be \nassigned to assist the Pourashavas in forming citizens committees, preparing and implementing \nUGIAP,  mobilizing  community  participation,  and  so  forth.  Further,  NGOs  will  be  engaged  to \nfacilitate  community  mobilization  for  improving  living  conditions  of  slum  dwellers,  provision  of \nmicrocredit  for  income-generating  activities,  and  social  programs  (e.g.,  on  literacy  training, \npoverty  reduction).  These  NGOs  will  be  selected  following  criteria  as  developed  under  the \nProject.12  Details for the required consultancy services are provided in Appendix 11. \n \n\n6. \n\nFinancing Low-Cost Sanitation and Microcredit Activities \n\n \n55. \nFor the low-cost sanitation component, beneficiaries will take out loans from a revolving \nfund to be set up by the Pourashavas in a manner satisfactory to ADB; this will be repaid twice a \nmonth over a 10-month period at an annual interest rate of 10%. For the slum dwellers, the slum \ndevelopment committee organized under the Project will receive a grant for 50% of the cost of \nthe  household  toilets  in  the  community,  with  the  remaining  50%  to  be  mobilized  by  the \nbeneficiaries.    Experienced  NGOs  will  be  engaged  to  mobilize  the  community  and  administer \nthe revolving fund. Part B of the Project includes the provision of a grant fund for microcredit to \nthe Pourashavas. Selected NGOs will be engaged to operate the microcredit activities aimed to \nsupport  the  income-generating  activities  of  poor  and  low-income  women  entrepreneurs  in  the \nparticipating  Pourashavas.    On  an  experimental  basis,  microcredit  operations  may  include \nsupport to urban youth, which will be reviewed during the midterm review. Based on the detailed \nbusiness proposals, an individual can receive a loan within a range from Tk2,500 to Tk15,000 \nand a group of four members up to Tk60,000 depending on the type of the business.  An annual \ninterest  rate  of  15%  will  be  charged  to  the  borrower  by  the  implementing  NGO.  The  loan \ntogether  with  the  interest,  will  be  repaid  over  a  period  of  1  year  in  equal  installments  (twice  a \nmonth). Collection will start 1 month after disbursement. Of the 15% collected as interest, one \nthird  will  be  retained  with  the  implementing  NGO  for  operation  of  the  fund,  and  the  remaining \ntwo  thirds  will  be  added  to  the  revolving  fund.  The  PMO  will  develop  guidelines  for  the \nmanagement and operation of the microcredit component under the Project.  \n \n\n7. \n\nLand Acquisition, Resettlement, and Indigenous Peoples \n\nthe \n\nthe  Project, \n\nin  Bangladesh.  Consequently,  under \n\n \nLand  acquisition  problems  have  frequently  been  a  major  source  of  delays  in  previous \n56. \nurban  projects \nland  acquisition \nrequirements have been minimized. The process of site selection will also be improved through \nthe  use  of  site  selection  guidelines  developed  under  STIDP  II.  In  addition,  committees  will  be \nformed  at  the  Pourashava  level  immediately  upon  entry  into  the  Project  to  undertake  rapid \nselection and evaluation of potential land sites. To minimize implementation delays due to land \nacquisition,  each  Pourashava  will  be  required  to  complete  the  preparatory  work  for  land \nacquisition prior to its submission of a SPAR. Actual land acquisition must be completed within \n180  days  from  the  signing  of  the  subproject  agreement;  otherwise,  the  component  will  be \nremoved  from  the  SPAR.    Should  any  involuntary  resettlement  be  required  for  a  subproject \ncomponent or loss of assets/income be expected during project implementation, the SPAR will \ninclude a resettlement plan, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and \nthe Project\u2019s land acquisition and resettlement framework.13 The Project design also includes an \nindigenous  peoples  framework14 to  ensure  that  project  benefits  are  equally  shared  between \n                                                 \n12 The selection criteria for NGO engagement are provided in Supplementary Appendix F. \n13  The  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement  Framework  is  included  in  Supplementary  Appendix  G  and  the  Sample \n\nResettlement Plan in Supplementary Appendix H.   \n\n14  The Indigenous Peoples Framework is provided in Supplementary Appendix I. \n\n\f15 \n\n8. \n\nOperation and Maintenance \n\nindigenous people and the Bengali settlers in Bandarban and Khagrachari in the Chitagong Hill \nTracts.    \n \n \n \n57. \nThe  Pourashavas  will  be  responsible  for  operating  and  maintaining  the  subproject \ninvestments. The operation and maintenance (O&M) manuals prepared under STIDP II will be \nrevised  for  use  by  the  PIUs.  These  manuals  will  describe  the  O&M  procedures  for  municipal \ninfrastructure,  services,  and  facilities  and  will  be  designed  for  regular  use  by  Pourashava \nengineering  staff.  The  PMO  consultants  will  provide  specific  training  to  all  relevant  staff  of  the \nPourashava in O&M of infrastructure facilities. One of the tasks of the institutional strengthening \nconsultants on O&M will be to define for each Pourashava the O&M requirements and obtain a \nrealistic assessment of the costs involved. These consultants will use the manuals and on-the-\njob  training  to  ensure  that  the  staff  in  the  Pourashava  are  made  familiar  with  the  O&M \nresponsibilities and requirements. The incremental O&M costs during the implementation period \nare not included in the Project cost, but the UGIAP requires the participating Pourashavas to set \naside  at  least  15%  equivalent  of  the  annual  development  budget  to  cover  O&M  expenditures \neach year.   \n \n\n9. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements  \n\nimplementation  and \n\n \nThe  civil  works  contracts  to  be  awarded  will  generally  be  small  in  value  and  involve  a \n58. \ntimely \nlarge  number  of  contractors.  To  ensure  effective  Project \ndisbursement,  the  Government  will  establish  an  imprest  account  in  the  name  of  the  Project  at \nthe Bangladesh Bank immediately after the effectiveness of the Loan Agreement. Payments for \ncivil works contracts will be made through this account for eligible payments under the Project. \nSimilarly, payments for incremental administrative costs of the UMSU, PMO, and PIUs will also \nbe  made  through  the  imprest  account.  The  SOE  procedure  will  be  adopted  to  facilitate \nreimbursement and liquidation of small contracts. The imprest account and the SOE procedure \nwill  be  established,  maintained,  and  audited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  of  January  2001.  The  initial  advance  to  the  imprest  account  will  correspond  to  6 \nmonths  of  estimated  ADB-financed  expenditures  to  be  paid  from  this  account.  The  SOE \nprocedure is applicable only to individual payments below $50,000 equivalent. \n \n\n10. \n\nAccounts, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n59. \nThe  Government  will  provide  ADB  with  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project \nimplementation. Reports will be prepared by each PIU and consolidated by the PMO. The PMO \nwill particularly address progress in meeting the targets under the UGIAP. The progress reports \nwill also include other information on the physical progress of works and the status of training \nand  support  program  by  the  UMSUs.  LGED/PMO  will  also  submit  to  ADB,  within  3  months  of \nphysical  completion  of  the  Project,  a  project  completion  report  that  will  cover  the  details  of \nproject  implementation,  cost,  monitoring  and  evaluation  activities,  and  other  information \nrequested by ADB. \n \n60. \nLGED/PMO  and  the  PIUs  will  maintain  accounts  and  records  in  such  a  manner  as  to \nfacilitate identification of income and expenditures related to the Project. They will be assisted \nby  an  adequate  number  of  suitably  qualified  accounting  staff,  including  a  financial  manager  in \nthe  PMO.  Additionally,  the  PMO  and  PIUs  will  be  assisted  by  a  financial  consultant  in \nestablishing the Project accounting and recording systems, and in training the staff to maintain \nthe  systems.  Auditors  acceptable  to  ADB  will  audit  all  the  accounts  and  statements  of \nexpenditures  and  revenues  related  to  the  Project  annually.  Audited  financial  statements  and \nproject accounts, together with the report of the auditor, will be submitted within 9 months of the \nclose  of  the  financial  year.  The  annual  audit  will  include  the  audit  of  the  imprest  account  and \nSOE  procedure,  and  a  separate  audit  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  SOE \nprocedure should be included in the annual audit report. LGED and the Pourashavas have been \n\n\f16 \n\nmade  aware  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  delayed  submission,  and  the  requirement  for  satisfactory  and \nacceptable quality of the audited accounts. \n \n\n11. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n61. \nTo  ensure  that  project  activities  and  facilities  are  managed  efficiently  and  that  the \nbenefits  reach  the  target  groups,  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  program  is  included  within  the \nframework of ADB\u2019s Project Performance Management System (PPMS). PPMS activities will be \nconducted  periodically  to  gather  information  from  multiple  sources  to  determine  whether  the \ninput  deliveries  for  implementing  project  activities  have  rendered  expected  benefits  to  the \nintended beneficiaries. The PPMS also seeks to detect any deficiency and discrepancy between \nthe  plan  and  the  execution  of  the  project  in  using  the  resources  efficiently  so  that  timely \ncorrections  can  be  made  to  update  the  project  and  thus  improve  the  benefits,  outcomes,  and \nimpact.  The  indicators  to  be  monitored  have  been  formulated  and  agreed  upon  with  the \nExecuting  Agency,  including  indicators  pertaining  to  both  physical  progress  and  capacity-\nbuilding activities.15 The PMO will conduct initial baseline physical and socioeconomic surveys \nand  submit  a  detailed  implementation  plan  for  monitoring  performance  and  for  preparing \nbenchmark information for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence within 6 months of loan effectiveness. \nThereafter,  the  PMO  will  submit  annual  monitoring  and  evaluation  reports  to  ADB  throughout \nthe project implementation. \n \n\n12. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n62. \nBecause of the large number of Pourashavas and components to be covered under the \nProject,  the  regular  reviews  to  be  conducted  by  ADB  at  least  two  times  a  year  will  be \nsupplemented by a formal midterm review, to be carried out jointly by the Government and ADB. \nThe routine project reviews will include a review of the Pourashavas\u2019 financial performance and \nstaffing,  the  implementation  of  the  UGIAP  and  the  GAP,  physical  progress  on  project \nimplementation, and capacity-building activities. The midterm review will allow the Government \nand  ADB  to  monitor  the  Project  closely  and  to  make  appropriate  adjustments  in  the  Project \ndesign and implementation arrangements, if necessary. The midterm review will be conducted \nat the end of phase 1 or in the middle of the project implementation period. \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR SUPPORTING URBAN GOVERNANCE REFORM \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  accompanying  TA  will  provide  necessary  technical  and  secretarial  support  to  the \n63. \nCommittee on Urban Local Governments (CULG), which will be established with the assistance \nfrom the TA and will cover the following key policy areas which were identified during the policy \ndialogue with the Government: (i) in consultation with various stakeholders in the urban sector, \nto prepare the National Urban Sector Policy for cabinet approval, containing recommendations, \namong  others,  on  the  approach  to  be  followed  in  the  process  and  pattern  of  urbanization  in \nBangladesh; (ii) to review the existing holding tax system in the country and suggest reforms for \nimproving  the  collection  of  holding  taxes  from  public  and  private  sector  entities  as  well  as \nsolving  the  problem  of  recurrent  arrears  of  such  taxes;  (iii)  to  make  recommendations  for  the \namendment  of  the  1977  Pourashava  Ordinance  to  reflect  the  needs  for  improved  local \ngovernance  and  better  urban  management;  and  (iv)  to  review  the  Government\u2019s  long-term \nstrategy  for  municipal  development  (covering  upazila  towns  and  Pourashavas)  and  make \nrecommendations  for  preparing  a  master  plan  for  future  development  of  these  key  urban \ncenters. Appendix 12 provides the terms of reference for CULG under the TA. \n \n\n                                                 \n15 Details of these indicators are provided in Supplementary Appendix J. \n\n\f17 \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nB. \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $520,000  equivalent.  The  Government  has \n64. \nrequested  ADB  to  finance  $400,000  equivalent,  covering  all  the  foreign  exchange  costs \n($85,000)  and  part  of  the  local  costs.  ADB  will  finance  $400,000  equivalent,  on  a  grant  basis, \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  The  proposed  Government  in-kind  contribution  of  $120,000 \nequivalent will cover office costs, conference venues, and counterpart staff remuneration.  \n \nC. \n \nLGD will be the Executing Agency for the TA, and a joint secretary of LGD will head the \n65. \nsecretariat to assist CULG; other members of the secretariat will be provided by LGD and LGED \nand the secretariat will be established at LGED. The secretariat will also be assisted by a group \nof  individual  consultants  with  expertise  in  urban  policy,  planning,  law,  and  local  government \nfinance. The TA is expected to commence as soon as the Project is approved by ADB\u2019s Board \nand to be completed in 2 years. \n \n66. \nCULG will convene meetings at least six times during its 2-year tenure. The chairperson \nmay  call  additional  meetings  as  necessary.  CULG,  with  assistance  of  the  secretariat,  will  hold \ndiscussions (at the national, regional, and local levels) with political leaders, policy makers, and \nlocal  stakeholders  as  well  as  the  local  aid  community  in  the  urban  sector;  review  the \nrecommendations  of  similar  commissions/committees;  review  relevant  documents,  acts, \nordinances; and carry out studies on key issues of urban local governance.  \n \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n \nA. \n \n\nMajor Benefits and Impacts \n\n1. \n\nGender and Social \n\n2. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \n67. \nThe gender and social assessments under the Project (the Summary Poverty Reduction \nand Social Strategy is found in Appendix 13) have resulted in the preparation of (i) the GAP to \naddress the need for active participation of women in urban planning and management as both \nbeneficiaries  and  agents,  (ii)  the  resettlement  framework  for  the  population  that  may  be \ndisplaced or suffer loss of assets and/or income as a result of project implementation, and (iii) \nthe indigenous peoples framework to ensure their full participation in the Project and to address \npotential  risks  to  them.  These  frameworks  provide  guidelines  to  assess  the  gender  and  social \nimpact of all subprojects, and any subproject not meeting these standards will not be eligible for \nfinancing.  \n \n \n \n68. \nThe  Project  will  generally  benefit  the  whole  of  the  urban  community,  and  some \ncomponents will focus on upgrading the conditions of the poorest and most needy groups in the \nslum  areas.  The  investments  will  result  in  substantial  direct  and  indirect  benefits,  including \nimproved  urban  environment,  better  health,  and  higher  employment  and  income  generation \npotential  for  the  residents.  Components  for  the  first  phase  (roads  and  drainage  rehabilitation) \nwere evaluated by cost-benefit analysis as summarized in Appendix 14. Subprojects for which \neconomic analysis was carried out yielded an average rate of return of 34.0% for the drainage \ncomponent and 30.6% for the road component. Overall, phase 1 investments are economically \nviable, and sensitivity analyses show that the returns are robust. Financial analysis was carried \nout  for  the  only  revenue-generating  component,  namely,  the  water  supply  scheme  in \nLakshmipur. The rate of return was estimated at 10.7%, which is above the weighted average \ncost of capital, estimated at 7.0%. For the second and third phase investments, the economic \nand financial analyses will be reported in the SPARs for review by ADB. In general, however, it \n\n\f18 \n\n4. \n\n3. \n\nFiscal  \n\nEnvironmental  \n\nis  expected  that  most  municipal  subprojects  to  be  financed  under  the  Project  will  have  high \neconomic rates of return due to the severe deficiencies in most Pourashavas.  \n \n \n \n69. \nThe financial burden of the Project on local government finances will not be significant. \nAs most funding will be made available as grants to the Pourashavas, the debt service impact \non local governments will be small. On the other hand, implementation of the Project will create \nemployment  opportunities,  increase  urban  productivity,  improve  the  management  of  municipal \nfinances, mobilize more revenue, and rationalize municipal spending.  The net fiscal impact of \nthese improvements is expected to substantially outweigh project investments.  \n \n \n \nThe  Project  has  been  assigned  environmental  assessment  category  B.  Overall,  it  is \n70. \nanticipated to have positive environmental impacts in reducing incidences of various diseases, \nimproving environmental conditions in urban areas, and reducing flooding. The negative impacts \nwill  mostly  relate  to  construction  activities,  which  will  be  temporary,  during  construction  only. \nOther potential negative impacts, such as groundwater contamination from sanitary landfills and \ndisposal  of  sludge  from  latrines,  can  be  addressed  by  applying  proper  environmental  and \nsanitary  engineering  technologies  during  the  design,  construction,  and  operation  stages.  For \nevaluation purposes, sample initial environmental examinations (IEEs) have been conducted for \nsubprojects with the highest potential environmental impacts in accordance with environmental \nrequirements and ADB's guidelines for infrastructure projects.16 \n \n71. \nFor subprojects that are still to be confirmed, the IEE will be prepared in accordance with \nADB's  guidelines  for  infrastructure  projects.  For  construction,  compliance  with  government \nenvironmental requirements as certified by the relevant government authorities will be sufficient \nfor  typical  subproject  components  costing  less  than  $1  million.17 For  subproject  components \ncosting  between  $1  million  and  $3  million,  ADB  will  review  and  approve  the  IEEs  on  a  \"no \nobjection\" basis. For subproject components costing more than $3 million, ADB will review IEEs \nprior to the start of construction. \n \n\n \n5. \n\nTechnical  \n\n \n72. \nThe  majority  of  works  under  the  Project  are  relatively  small.  These  schemes  were \nidentified  based  on  the  needs  and  priorities  of  the  Pourashavas  in  consultation  with  the \ncommunities.  The  works  under  the  Project  do  not  require  complex  design  or  construction \ntechniques,  and  are  within  the  technical  capabilities  of  the  Pourashavas.  LGED  will  provide \nadditional technical support as considered necessary and will supervise the quality of the works \nof  the  Pourashavas.  Engineering  designs  for  the  phase  1  works  have  been  reviewed  by  the \nPPTA consultants. Design and supervision consultants will further review the designs to assure \ntechnical quality and timeliness.  \n \nB. \n \nThe overall framework of the Project (Appendix 1) summarizes its objectives, indicators \n73. \nto be used to measure achievements, and assumptions that must be satisfied to avoid the risk \nof  noncompliance.  While  no  unusual  risks  are  foreseen  during  implementation,  the  potential \nrisks concern (i) delays in implementation due to slow progress with start-up activities; (ii) lack of \nsuitably  qualified  personnel  in  the  Pourashavas,  which  may  eventually  lead  to  weak \n\nMajor Risks \n\n                                                 \n16  The summary IEE is provided in Supplementary Appendix K. \n17  ADB  provided  a  TA  to  the  Government  to  review  and  evaluate  environmental  impact  assessments:  ADB.  1991. \n\nTechnical Assistance to Bangladesh for Environmental Management Training. Manila. \n\n\f19 \n\nimplementation of subprojects at the Pourashava level; and (iii) sustainability of the facilities and \nservices provided under the Project.  \n \n74. \nImplementation  delay  can  be  prevented  to  a  large  extent  by  timely  mobilization  of \nconsultants.  Advance  action  is  required  to  ensure  that  the  implementation  schedule  can  be \nadhered  to.  Second,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  qualified  staff  nominated  for  the  UMSU \nand PMO will be available at the commencement of the Project. The activities under the UGIAP \ncannot be undertaken if the key positions are left unfilled. Finally, the sustainability of Project will \ndepend on the ability of the Pourashavas to generate sufficient revenues from their own sources. \nWith  the  training  and  added  incentives  under  the  Project  for  better  financial  performance,  the \nrisk to sustainability of the investments in infrastructure can be minimized. \n \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n75. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\nThe Government will cause each Pourashava, with assistance from the PMO and \nthe consultants, to submit its SPAR in a timely manner prior to each phase, for \napproval by ADB. The SPAR for each phase will describe the technical, financial, \nand economic viability of the subproject and its components as well as social and \nenvironmental  issues  and  sustainability.  The  SPARs  will  include  summary  IEEs \nand  resettlement  plans,  if  required  under  applicable  laws  and  regulations  and \nADB\u2019s environmental guidelines and Policy on Involuntary Resettlement.  \n\nThe  Government  will  cause  each  participating  Pourashava  to  enter  into  a \nsubproject  agreement  with  LGED  satisfactory  to  ADB,  following  the  approval  of \nthe  SPAR  for  each  phase  by  ADB.  The  subproject  agreement  will  describe  any \nconditions  and  covenants  that  must  be  satisfied  by  the  Pourashava  before  and \nduring  subproject  implementation,  including  actions  under  the  UGIAP.  If  the \nsubproject  involves  relending  of  loan  proceeds  from  the  Government  to  the \nPourashava, a subsidiary loan agreement satisfactory to ADB will also be signed \nby \nto  ADB  approval, \nimplementation will proceed under the framework developed by the PMO/PIU.  \n\nthe  Pourashava  chairperson  and  MOF.  Subject \n\nThe  Government  will  cause  the  interministerial  steering  committee  to  be \nestablished and the first meeting be held within 3 months of loan effectiveness. \n\nThe Government will cause LGED to adopt and fully carry out the GAP during the \nproject implementation period. To this end, the Government will require the PMO \nto prepare field manuals for the GAP and conduct training for the PMO and PIU \nstaff. The implementation of the GAP will be closely monitored and the progress \nwill be reported in the quarterly reports to the ADB.   \n\nThe Government will require each Pourashava to complete the preparatory work \nfor land acquisition prior to its submission of a SPAR for each phase. Actual land \nacquisition must be completed within 180 days from the signing of the subproject \nagreement  for  each  phase;  otherwise,  the  component  will  be  removed  from  the \nSPAR. If any involuntary resettlement of residents is required for land acquisition, \na  resettlement  plan  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  applicable  laws  and \nregulations,  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement,  and  the  Project\u2019s  land \nacquisition and resettlement framework. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\n \nB. \n \n76. \n \n\n \n \n\nThe  Government  will  cause  LGED  to  conduct  initial  baseline  physical  and \nsocioeconomic surveys and submit a detailed implementation plan for monitoring \nperformance  and  for  preparing  benchmark  information  for  ADB\u2019s  review  and \nconcurrence within 6 months of loan effectiveness. \n\nThe  Government  will  cause  MLGRDC  to  establish  CULG  to  guide  its  long-term \nstrategy for municipal development, including preparing the draft National Urban \nSector  Policy,  recommending  reforms  for  the  collection  of  holding  taxes,  and \nrecommending  amendments  to  the  1977  Pourashava  Ordinance  to  reflect  the \nneed  for  improved  and  better  urban  management.    The  Government  will  cause \nCULG to complete its responsibilities as described in its terms of reference within \n2  years  from  the  approval  by  ADB  of  the  associated  TA  for  Supporting  Urban \nGovernance  Reform.  MLGRDC  will  ensure  that  the  recommendations  of  CULG \nare submitted for cabinet approval.  \n\n \n(viii)  The  Government  will  cause  MLGRDC  to  set  up  PPRC  within  LGD  by  31 \nDecember  2003.  PPRC  will  require  technical  and  secretarial  support  from  the \nUMSU, through its PEM, including the collection of relevant information and the \npreparation  of  the  draft  performance  evaluation  report.  PPRC  will  consist  of  the \nsecretary  of  LGD  (as  chairperson),  chief  engineer  of  LGED,  director  general  of \nLGD,  representatives  from  the  Planning  Commission  and  ERD  of  MOF,  a \nrepresentative  from  IMED,  a  renowned  urban  governance  specialist  nominated \nby  LGD,  an  ADB  representative  and  the  director  of  the  UMSU  as  member \nsecretary.  \n\n \n(ix) \n\nThe  Government  will  require  the  Pourashavas  in  the  Chittagong  Hill  Tracts  to \nimplement the indigenous peoples framework prepared under the Project.   \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\nThe following will be special conditions for loan effectiveness: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  project  proforma  (for  the  Loan  and  the  accompanying  TA)  will  have  been \napproved by the Government.  \nA 5-year work plan for the UMSU acceptable to ADB will have been submitted to \nADB.  \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n\n77. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nADB  and  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the  provisions  of  Articles  35.1  of  the \nArticles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  45,461,000  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nBangladesh  for  the  Urban  Governance  and  Infrastructure  Improvement  (Sector)  Project  from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 \nyears;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set \nforth in the

\n\nSUMMARY OF URBAN SECTOR ANALYSIS \n \n\nA. \n\nDemographic and Spatial Trends \n\n \n\nInstitutional Framework \n\nBangladesh  has  experienced  significant  growth  in  urban  population  from  less  than  5 \n1. \nmillion in 1971 to almost 30 million in 2001. Accordingly, the level of urbanization increased from \nbelow 8% in 1971 to 23% in 2001. The growth in the number of urban centers has also been \nphenomenal,  from  under  100  in  1971  to  522  in  1991  (and  most  likely  to  be  more  than  550  in \n2001). There has also been growth in the number of large urban centers: Cities with more than \n100,000 population have grown in number from 5 in 1971 to 25 in 2001. There were no \u201cmillion \ncities\u201d  in  Bangladesh  in  1961;  now  there  are  three,  with  Dhaka  emerging  as  a  megacity  with \nnearly 10 million people in its greater Statistical Metropolitan Area.  \n \n2. \nAlthough  Bangladesh  presents  a  unique  case  of  dispersal  of  urban  centers  almost  in \nuniform  density  throughout  the  country  (with  the  exception  of  the  Chittagong  Hill  Tracts),  the \ndistribution  is  far  from  being  a  balanced  one  by  city  size.  Certain  regions  suffer  from  the \nabsence of large metropolitan centers, which could play the role of regional magnets or growth \npoles,  and  somewhat  reduce  the  strong  pull  effect  of  Dhaka.  Another  spatial  pattern  in  urban \ndevelopment  in  Bangladesh  is  the  recent  emergence  of  a  corridor  form  of  urban  expansion, \nradiating from Dhaka towards the west, north, northeast, and east, following the highways, and \nto the southeast along the water routes. Railways have played a complementary role to roads in \nthe northern and northeastern corridors. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nIn  terms  of  administrative  structure,  urban  centers  in  Bangladesh  are  classified  as  city \ncorporations,  Pourashavas  (municipalities),  and  \u201cother  urban  areas\u201d  (which  are  run  under  the \nunion  parishad  system).  The  present  number  of  city  corporations  is  4  (Dhaka,  Chittagong, \nKhulna, and Rajshahi), with two more Pourashavas to be upgraded to city corporations (Sylhet \nand Barisal), while the number of Pourashavas is now over 250 (growing from less than 120 in \n1996).  Municipal  governments  include  city  corporations  and  pourashavas.  All  municipal \ngovernments  operate  within  the  limits  set  by  relevant  ordinances  and  acts.  For  instance,  the \nPourashava  Ordinance  of  1977  lays  down  the  foundation  of  pourashavas  and  their  functions, \nwhile  similar  ordinances  define  the  role,  power,  and  responsibilities  of  the  city  corporations. \nBesides  the  city  corporations  and  pourashavas,  some  special  development  authorities  and \nspecial purpose authorities were created to meet the growing demand for services based on two \nother ordinances \u2212 the Town Improvement Act of 1953 and the Sewerage Authority Ordinance \nof 1963. \n \n4. \nCorporations  and  Pourashavas  have  an  elected  head  (mayor  for  corporations  and \nchairperson for Pourashavas) and a council of commissioners who represent the people in each \nsuburb  or  ward,  and  are  mandated  by  ordinance  to  provide  urban  services  including  (i) \nmaintenance of roads, drainage, and parks; (ii) operation of water supply systems, community \ntoilets,  markets,  solid  waste  management,  and  slaughterhouses;  (iii)  delivery  of  public  health \nand basic services for the urban poor; and (iv) development and building control. The executive \npower of a municipality rests with its chairperson or mayor who is the primary decision-maker. \nThe chief executive officer is appointed by the Government but has only such executive powers \nas  the  chairperson  may  authorize.  All  officers  and  employees  of  the  Pourashava  are \nsubordinate  to  chief  executive  officer.    Municipal  ordinances,  however,  contain  numerous \nclauses under which the Central Government can give directions to municipalities. In fact, only a \nfew amendments have been made to the Pourashava Ordinance in the last 10 years, and even \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\nUrban Sector Policy Framework \n\nthese were all minor changes not sufficient to accord clear authority and decision-making power \nto local governments.  \n \nC. \n \n5. \nAlthough the Government of Bangladesh has long been aware of both the rapid pace of \nurbanization in the country and the associated physical, economic, and social problems, it has \nnot  yet  adopted  an  explicit  urban  policy.  However,  a  number  of  government  documents  and \nother  initiatives  have  from  time  to  time  indicated  the  policy  thinking  of  the  Government  with \nregard  to  urbanization  and  urban  development.  The  National  Report  on  Human  Settlements \nsubmitted  to  the  United  Nations  Habitat  I  Conference  held  at  Vancouver  in  Canada  in  1976 \ncame  close  to  a  policy  statement  on  human  settlements  and  urbanization  in  Bangladesh. \nBesides  this,  the  various  five-year  plan  documents  prepared  between  1973  and  1998  also \nindicated some policy direction.  \n \n6. \nOverall, however, the formal planning documents have sidetracked urban development.. \nFor instance, almost none of the plans developed through successive five-year plan exercises \nwere  ever  implemented.  In  1991,  the  Planning  Commission  abandoned  the  sequence  of  five-\nyear plans and instead spent a lot of time to issue a 15-year Participatory Perspective Plan to \nbe  supplemented  with  detailed  Annual  Development  Programs.  However,  the  Plan  was  never \nfinalized,  and  the  five-year  planning  process  was  reestablished.  The  Fifth  Five-Year  Plan  has \nfollowed  more  or  less  the  earlier  policies  and  emphasized  decentralization  development. \nHowever,  investments  have  continued  to  be  concentrated  in  the  largest  cities,  Dhaka  and \nChittagong.  On  the  other  hand,  a  number  of  parallel  developments  outside  the  five-year  plan \nexercises have emphasized urbanization and the urban sector. The Report of the Task Force on \nSocial Implications of Urbanization prepared in 1991 at the behest of the interim government of \nthe  time  made  an  elaborate  statement  on  urban  policy  and  poverty  reduction.  This  report, \nhowever,  was  not  approved  by  the  new  Government  and  therefore  not  considered  for \nimplementation.  \n\n7. \nSubsequently,  the  National  Housing  Policy  (1993),  the  Bangladesh  Urban  and  Shelter \nSector  Review  (1993),  the  Bangladesh  Urban  Sector  National  Program  Document  (1994),  the \nBangladesh  National  Habitat  II  Report  (1996),  and  the  recent  Bangladesh  National  Habitat  II \nIstanbul+5 Report (2001) have all underscored the most important role urbanization can play in \nnational development. All these documents have spelled out policy directions and even action \nplans  for  achieving  a  balanced  development  process.  The  National  Housing  Policy  is  an \nofficially approved document, and so are the 1996 Habitat II and 2001 Istanbul+5 Report. The \nUrban  Management  Policy  Statements  (1994  and  1999)  prepared  by  the  Ministry  of  Local \nGovernment (jointly with the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank) emphasized that all \nPourashavas  should  have  adequate  personnel  and  financial  strength,  provide  and  maintain \nbasic  infrastructure  facilities,  prepare  and  implement  land  use  plans,  address  poverty,  ensure \nparticipation and involve the private sector. \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE URBAN SECTOR  \n \nTable A3.1: Multilateral and Bilateral Assistance, 1995-2001 \n($ million) \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nTotal \n\n \nLoans \n\n \nGrants \n\n \nSource \n \n \nMultilateral \nA. \n79.38 \nADB \n \n410.00 \nWorld Bank \n \n \nUNICEF \n \n \nUNDP \n \n \nEuropean Union \n \n \n        Subtotal \n \n \n \n \n \nB.

In  particular,  during \ndiscussions  with  the  minister  of  Local  Government,  Rural  Development  and  Cooperatives,  it \nwas  suggested  that  the  Project  would  provide  the  framework  for  such  a  committee.  As \nstipulated during the discussions with the minister, the activities of this committee may include, \namong others, the preparation of the National Urban Sector Policy for cabinet approval, review \nand  revision  of  the  1977  Pourashava  Ordinance,  and  examination  of  other  critical  issues  for \nsustainable urban development. \n \nB. \n \nThe  TA  will  provide  necessary  technical  and  secretarial  support  to  the  Committee  on \n2. \nUrban  Local  Governments  (CULG)  in  the  following  key  policy  areas,  which  were  identified \nduring the policy dialogue carried out by the ADB mission: \n \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nIn  consultation  with  various  stakeholders  in  the  urban  sector,  prepare  the \nNational Urban Sector Policy for cabinet approval, containing recommendations, \namong others, on the approach to be followed in the process and the pattern of \nurbanization  in  Bangladesh;  identify  the  nature  of  existing  urban  problems;  and \nanalyze the reasons underlying the inability of city corporations and Pourashavas \nto provide essential services to city dwellers.  \nReview  the  existing  holding  tax  system  in  the  country  and  suggest  reforms  for \nimproving  collection  of  holding  taxes  from  public  and  private  sector  entities  as \nwell as solving the problem of recurrent arrears of such taxes.   \n\nthe  needs \n\n(iii)  Make recommendations for the amendment of the 1977 Pourashava Ordinance \nlocal  governance  and  better  urban \n\nto  reflect \nmanagement. \nfor  municipal  development \nlong-term  strategy \nReview \n(covering  upazila  towns  and  Pourashavas)  and  make  recommendations  for \npreparing a master plan for future development of these key urban centers. \n\nthe  Government\u2019s \n\nimproved \n\n(iv) \n\nfor \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \nC. \n \n3. \nGiven  the  issues  to  be  addressed,  the  members  of  CULG  should  be  senior  political \nleaders and officials representing all tiers of government.

Yes \n\nSector identified as a National Priority in             Yes \nCountry Poverty Analysis? \n \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reducing poverty in Bangladesh: \n \nThe incidence of poverty, as measured by the costs of basic needs poverty line, fell from 58.8% in 1992 to 49.8% in \n2000. A sector breakdown of poverty shows that progress on reducing poverty incidence was almost equal across \nurban  and  rural  areas:  the  urban  headcount  rate  declined  from  44.9%  to  36.6%  (by  8.3%)  while  rural  poverty \ndeclined from 61.2% to 53.0% (by 8.2%). However, the moderate reduction in urban poverty during the last decade \nwas accompanied by a notable increase in urban income inequality, as the Gini coefficient increased from 0.398 to \n0.452. \n \nThe situations have been somewhat different in the case of absolute numbers of the poor in urban and rural areas. \nIn  1992,  the  number  of  urban  poor  was  6.5  million  while  the  total  urban  population  was  14.6  million.  This  then \nincreased to 9.3 million in 2000. Thus there was at least a 43% growth of the urban poor population during the last \ndecade. The rural poor population, on the other hand, recorded a decline in its absolute number from 57.6 million to \n53.5  million.  The  principal  reason  behind  this  phenomenon  is  the  large-scale  shift  of  the  rural  population  to  the \nurban areas in the hope of better economic opportunities. The labor force in urban towns is composed primarily of \nmigrants. It is also dominated by youth. The urban poor in the slums have very low levels of education and hardly \nany  skills.  About  40%  of  the  population  aged  5-15  years  are  not  attending  school.  Sixty  to  eighty  percent  of  the \nurban  labor  force  is  in  the  informal  sector  depending  on  the  size  of  the  city.  Female  migrants  in  small  towns  lack \nemployment opportunities in both the formal and informal sector. An increasing number of urban poor especially the \nyouth,  are  being  employed  in  socially  unproductive  or  unacceptable  occupations,  like  extortion,  begging,  and \nprostitution. \n \nIf  the  current  trend  of  migration  continues,  the  urban  poor  will  increase  to  25-30%  of  the  total  country's  poor  by \n2020,  if  not  more.  This  points  to  the  growing  need  to  address  adverse  impacts  of  unplanned  and  uncontrolled \nurbanization and promote balanced urban development. In particular, the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) urban \nsector  strategy  in  Bangladesh  has  recognized  the  strategic  importance  of  secondary  towns  in  the  urbanization \nprocess,  and  the  need  to  promote  them  to  lead  a  sound  and  balanced  urban  development.  The  concentration  of \npopulation and activities in a few metropolitan areas has aggravated urban environmental conditions in the absence \nof adequate capacities to manage urban growth. Recognizing diseconomies of congestion and deteriorating living \nconditions  of  the  urban  poor  in  metropolitan  cities,  ADB  has  already  provided  five  loans  totaling  $208  million  for \nurban  infrastructure  projects  in  secondary  towns  since  the  start  of  its  operations  in  Bangladesh  in  the  late  1980s. \nThe proposed Project will further contribute to the achievements made so far by improving urban governance and \ninfrastructure services in secondary towns.  \n \n \nB. \nUnder  the  Project,  low-income  families  were  identified  based  on  their  monthly  incomes.  The  households  with \nmonthly  incomes  of  less  than  Tk4,700  ($81)  are  classified  as  poor  and  those  with  monthly  incomes  of  less  than \nTk3,400  ($59)  as  hard-core  poor.  The  household  survey  shows  that  about  35%  of  the  population  in  the  project \ntowns are classified as poor and around 15% as hard-core poor.  \n \nThe direct impact of the Project on poverty reduction is employment generation arising from the construction phase. \nThe  unskilled  labor  content  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  Tk298  million,  equivalent  to  11,160  person-years.  While \nthe gender ratio of unskilled labor employment is difficult to estimate, it is anticipated that at least one third of the \nunskilled  labor  person-years  will  be  destined  for  women.  The  Gender  Action  Plan  under  the  Project  also  assures \nthat women workers will get fair wages relative to the male workers.  \n \nThe Project will also benefit the poor through direct support for environmental improvement and income generation. \nThe  integrated  package  of  services  (low-cost  sanitation,  microcredit,  and  community-based  waste  management, \netc.)  to  be  provided  will  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  living  conditions  of  poor  people.    Raising  environmental \nconditions  will  also  mitigate  the  incidence  of  waterborne  and  vectored  diseases,  with  consequent  reduction  in \nmortality  and  morbidity  rates.  Currently,  environmental  conditions  in  the  Project  towns  are  grossly  unsatisfactory, \nand fewer than 50% have access to sanitary facilities. Wastes from community latrines, where provided, frequently \ncontaminate the groundwater. During monsoon times, conditions are particularly unhygienic.  \n \n\nProposed Classification: Poverty Intervention \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n51 \n\n \n \nAn  important  element  of  the  Pourashava  Poverty  Reduction  Action  Plan  is  the  focus  on  increasing  self-reliance \nwithin  the  low-income  and  poor  communities,  with  particular  emphasis  on  the  involvement  of  women  and  jobless \nyouth in community activities.  Specific funds are allocated for income-generating activities, skills development, and \nbasic health services with assistance from nongovernment organizations.  In addition, the Project will ensure privacy \nfor women by providing adequate facilities for women in public toilets and transportation facilities.   \n\nBenefits to poor \n\nGender Benefits \n \n\nBenefits to minorities/indigenous \ngroups \n\nFemale  ward  commissioners  will \nreceive  a  separate  training  for  their \nrole  in  managing  municipal  affairs. \nThey  will  organize \nlocal  women\u2019s \ngroup  for  increased  participation  of \nin  urban  planning  and \nwomen \nmanagement.   \n  \n\nIndigenous  peoples  specialist  will \nbe  engaged  at  PIU  to  ensure  that \nthe benefits of the project reach the \nindigenous  people  and  to  monitor \nany  adverse  impact  of  the  project \non them.  \n \nSpecific  skills \ntraining  will  be \ndeveloped and organized within the \ncultural  context  of \nindigenous \npeople.     \n\nof \n\ntheir \n\nfunds \n\nto \nplanning \n\nUrban Governance Improvement Component \nWomen  and  youth  from  poor  and \nlow-income  households  will  be \nprovided  with  small \nfor \nincome- generating activities. \n \n The  Pourashava  Poverty  Reduction \nAction Program will provide the poor \nthe  unique \nin  slum  areas  with \nformulate \nopportunities \nthe \nparticipatory \nfor \nown \ndevelopment \ncommunity.  \n \nA  mechanism  will  be  developed  for \nincreasing  the  participation  of  the \npoor  in  community  planning  and \nimplementation  of  various  poverty \nreduction activities. \n \nUrban Infrastructure Improvement Component \nThe  investment  component  of  the \ndirect \nProject \nemployment \nopportunities \n(equivalent  of  10,000  person-years) \nduring the construction period.   \n \nPoor  people  in  underserved  areas \nand  slums  will  have \nincreased \naccess \nto  basic  urban  services \n(roads, sanitation, drains, etc.)  \n \n \nImproved  infrastructure  will  provide \nbetter economic opportunities for the \npoor,  as  they  will  have  increased \nmobility  and  improved  access  to \nroads and markets. \n\ngenerate \n\nwill \n\nin \n\nWomen  will  have  increased  role  in \nand \nproject \nimplementation \nmaintenance  as  mandated \nthe \ngender action plan adopted under the \nproject.  \n  \nThe design of the public facilities built \nunder  the  project  (e.g.,  bus  terminals \nmarkets)  will  properly  address  the \nwomen\u2019s needs.  \n \nThe Project will increase employment \nand  income-earning  opportunities  for \npoor  women,  especially  during  the \nconstruction  period.

In  particular,  ward-based  citizen  committees,  market  committees,  and \ngender  and  environment  committees  will  be  established.    Emphasis  will  be  also  given  to  participation  of  women \nward members in the Project through the (i) infrastructure management committee, (ii) market committee, and (iii) \nenvironment committee.

EIRRs were prepared for roads, drainage, and slum improvement \ncomponents,  and  FIRRs  for  water  supply,  and  municipal  facilities.  The  evaluations  are \nsummarized in Tables A14.1 and A14.2. \n \n2. \nThe basic assumptions used in economic analysis are that (i) economic costs are based \non June 2002 prices; (ii) both capital cost and operation and maintenance (O&M) cost estimates \nwere apportioned into traded and nontraded components and labor; (iii) using a domestic price \nnumeraire, financial prices (based on June 2002 prices and reduced by duties and taxes) were \nconverted  to  economic  prices  by  a  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  of  1.05  for  traded  cost \ncomponents and 1.0 for nontraded cost components; (iv) a shadow wage rate factor of 0.87 was \nused for skilled and 0.67 for unskilled labor to reflect unemployment and underemployment; (v) \nannual  O&M  cost  is  assumed  to  be  0.5%  of  capital  cost,  and  periodic  (every  6  years) \nmaintenance  cost  3%  of  capital  cost;  and  (vi)  subprojects  were  assessed  for  a  period  that \ninclude project implementation and 20 years of benefits, with no allowance for the residual value \nof assets at the end of the evaluation period. \n \n3. \nFinancial  analyses  are  conducted  in  June  2002  prices  taking  into  account  incremental \nO&M.  Basic  assumptions  used  in  the  computation  of  the  FIRR  include  the  following:  (i)  all \nrevenues  and  costs  are  expressed  at  constant  June  2002  prices  on  an  incremental  basis;  (ii) \nthe  estimated  base  costs  and  physical \nfrom \nproject \ncontingencies, but without considering price contingencies and interest during construction; and \n(iii)  capital  expenditures  are  recorded  at  the  time  when  they  are  incurred,  while  interest  and \ndepreciation are excluded. \n \nA. \n \n4. \nUnder  phase  1,  primary  and  secondary  drains  of  83.35  kilometers  (km)  in  21 \nPourashavas  will  be  upgraded  and  extended  at  a  base  cost  of  Tk340  million  ($5.87  million).  \nThe proposed rehabilitation of the drainage system will help reduce the incidence of flooding in \na  catchment  area  of  292  hectares  benefiting  71,695  properties.  Economic  evaluation  was \nprepared  for  all  schemes  within  a  Pourashava  because  linkages  between  drains  result  in \nbenefits that are not always discrete to an individual scheme. The improved drainage network \nwill help reduce damage to houses, household goods, crops, and business activity in the areas \npresently  experiencing  inundation.  The  improvements  will  further  result  in  increased  value  of \nland in the catchment area. \n \n5. \nFor  economic  benefit,  the  annual  flood  damage  to  movable  and  immovable  household \nproperty was quantified based on the findings of a socioeconomic survey carried out under the \nPPTA.  The  annual  average  damage  cost  was  estimated  between  Tk1,400  and  Tk2,715 \ndepending on the type of the property. The number of properties is based on the Pourashavas \nestimates  of  the  properties  expected  to  be  benefited  within  the  catchments  area  of  each \nproposed scheme. Allowance is made for the unit benefit to rise by 2% per annum in the future, \nas against the forecast growth of around 5% in the gross domestic product per capita.    \n \n\ninvestment  costs  were  derived \n\nDrainage   \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nRoads \n\nThe  economic  evaluations,  which  also  take  into  account  the  incremental  maintenance \n6. \ncosts,  estimated  the  overall  EIRR  at  34.0  percent  (individual  EIRRs  range  from  12.1%  to \n73.7%).  However,  actual  EIRR  could  be  even  higher,  given  that  the  rehabilitated  drainage \nsystem will generate additional benefits that are difficult to quantify: (i) reduced damage to motor \nvehicles  and  public  infrastructure  such  as  roads;  (ii)  reduced  loss  of  personal  income  when \nemployment  is  disrupted;  (iii)  reduced  waterlogging  from  rainwater  into  residential  areas  (the \nstagnant  and  contaminated  water  becomes  the  source  of  mosquito  breeding);  (iv)  reduced \ndegradation  of  urban  environmental  conditions;  (v)  reduced  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases \nwithin the community, which would result in reduction of childhood prenatal and postnatal illness \nand mortality rates; and (vi) reduced disruption to personal and community life caused by slow \ndispersal of storm water, etc. \n \nB. \n \n7. \nInvestments  are  aimed  at  improvement  to  a  variety  of  surfaces  and  alignments  of \nexisting  roads,  plus  some  road  widening.  There  is  no  new  road  construction.  In  all,  293 \nindividual schemes have been submitted by 21 Pourashavas for inclusion under phase 1. The \ncost  of  all  except  four  individual  schemes  is  well  below  the  ADB\u2019s  cut-off  rate  for  analysis  of \n$200,000 (Tk11.6 million).  \n \nWhile submitting the proposal for the road rehabilitation schemes, the Pourashavas were \n8. \nasked to carry out a 12-hour traffic count to support the need for the upgradation. Although the \nPourashavas  have  submitted  a  broad  traffic  count  for  each  scheme,  their  reliability  cannot  be \nfully  assessed.  The  economic  analysis  therefore  has  been  carried  out  for  the  four  schemes \ncosting  above  $200,000,  and  a  few  other  representative  schemes  to  demonstrate  their \nfeasibility.  \n \n9. \nThe  improved  road  network  will  result  in  reduction  in  traffic  congestion  and  accidents, \nsavings in travel time and vehicle operating costs, and safer conditions for pedestrians and non-\nmotorized  traffic.  The  main  objective  of  investment  in  urban  roads  is  to  reduce  user  costs  of \ndifferent  vehicle  types,  which  means  the  reduction  of  cost  to  the  travelers  in  moving  from  one \nlocation to another.  \n \n10. \nFor  benefit  analysis,  vehicle  operating  costs  have  been  classified  into  the  following \ngroups:  (i)  distance-dependent  costs,  which  vary  directly  with  distances  covered  (e.g., \nconsumption of fuel, lubricants, wear and tear of tires, and repair and maintenance); (ii) speed-\ndependent costs, which arise out of low speed because of poor/bad condition of roads; and (iii) \ntime-dependent costs. \n \n11. \nIn the secondary towns, the most prevalent vehicle type is the rickshaw, and these have \ntherefore  been  considered  for  benefit  calculation.  The  difference  in  the  time  saved  due  to \nincreased  speed  under  \"without\u201d  and  \u201cwith\"  project  situations  was  allotted  a  time  value.  In  the \nwithout  project  situation,  pedalling  1  km  requires  12.5  minutes,  whereas  under  the  improved \nsituation  the  required  time  would  be  reduced  to  7.5  minutes/km.  This  time  saved  after \nimprovement would be available for additional trips, resulting in benefits. The saving has been \nconverted into a benefit assuming that a rickshaw puller charges Tk3 per km.   \n \n12. \nThe  individual  EIRRs  assessed  for  the  selected  road  schemes  range  between  13.4% \nand 74.8% above the economic opportunity cost of capital, which is 12% for Bangladesh. The \nsensitivity  analysis  also  indicates  the  robustness  of  the  EIRR  with  respect  to  the  changes  in \neconomic benefits and costs. \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n55 \n\nWater Supply \n\n \nC. \n \n13. \nA water supply component under the Project will generally involve rehabilitation of and \nextension  to  existing  systems.  Therefore,  the  incremental  volume  sold  will  be  calculated  by \nsubtracting  the  estimated  existing  volume  sold  from  the  projected  annual  volume  sold.  To \nassess  the  financial  viability  of  a  typical  water  supply  component,  a  financial  evaluation  was \nprepared for the water supply component in Lakshmipur. The capacity of the existing production \nwells in the Pourashava is approximately 2,500 cubic meters per day or about 33% of the daily \nrequirements, estimated at 7,500 cubic meters per day.  In terms of geographical coverage, the \npresent water distribution network serves 2,280 out of 12,200 households. In view of the rapidly \ndeteriorating situation, it is proposed to construct two production tubewells, a treatment plant, an \noverhead tank, and 8 km of distribution pipelines of 100-250 millimeters diameter at a total base \ncost of Tk36.1 million. \n \n14. \nThe  subproject  will  be  funded  as  70%  loan  and  20%  grant  from  the  Government.  The \nPourashava  will  meet  the  remaining  10%  from  its  own  resources.  The  loan  portion  will  carry \ninterest at 7% with an amortization period of 20 years including the 5-year grace period.  \n \n15. \nFor revenue calculation, it is assumed that the water tariff will rise in real terms by 5% \nduring the FY2003. Upon completion of the new scheme, the tariff will increase in real term by \n15%  in  the  year  of  commissioning  and  thereafter  by  5%  on  an  annual  basis.  The  incremental \noperating  cost  of  the  scheme  is  estimated  at  7%  of  the  cost  of  the  scheme.  Based  the \nincremental  revenue  and  costs,  the  base  FIRR  is  calculated  as  10.3%  compared  with  the \nweighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  6.1%.  Sensitivity  tests  indicate  that  the  FIRR  is  most \nsensitive to the decrease in revenue.   \n \n16. \nThe  field  visit  to  the  town  revealed  that  the  domestic  users  of  the  subconnections  are \nwilling to pay more than the current water tariff payment of Tk150 per month provided the quality \nof  service  is  improved.  The  experience  from  other  externally  funded  projects  (e.g.,  the \nNetherlands  assistance  program)  shows  that  households  were  willing  to  pay  even  when  the \ncharges were increased by 150% to a maximum 250%. When the tariff increase was 100%, the \ncollection  efficiency  reached  as  high  as  79%.  An  affordability  analysis  shows  that  overall  the \nwater supply charges  are affordable,  taking into account the low level of even median-income \nhouseholds.  The  percentage  of  median  income  required  to  pay  water  charges  would  be  no \nmore than 4-5%.   \n \nD. \n \n17. \nThe solid waste service is paid for through the conservancy element of the holding tax, \nand  the  maximum  levy  permitted  under  Pourashava  Ordinance  is  7%  of  the  eligible  tax  base. \nSince all property holders must pay the tax, there are no incremental users of the service, and \ntherefore no FIRR can be calculated. Instead, a cost recovery analysis has been carried out for \nall Pourashavas to assess the adequacy of revenues to recover the cost associated with solid \nwaste  service  (except  for  Mehepur,  which  does  not  levy  the  conservancy  tax).  Revenues  are \nestimated by the conservancy element of the holding tax projections.  \n \n18.  While  it  is  desirable  that  revenues  should  cover  all  costs,  including  depreciation  and \nrecurrent  costs  for  O&M,  it  is  anticipated  that  only  eight  Pourashavas  will  achieve  full  cost \nrecovery  without  a  significant  improvement  of  tax  revenues.  Since  the  poor  cost  recovery  is \nrelated to general problems with tax assessment and collection, during project implementation, \n\nSolid Waste Disposal \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nMunicipal Facilities \n\nparticipating Pourashavas will be required to adopt several measures to expand the tax base as \nwell as increase the overall holding tax revenues at least by 5-10% a year.  \n \nE. \n \n19. \nFinancial  analyses  for  municipal  facilities  (e.g.,  transport  terminals,  markets,  and \nslaughterhouses)  are  prepared  in  consideration  of  the  Local  Government  Division\u2019s  directive \nthat,  while  Pourashavas  may  provide  these  services,  they  should  be  operated  by  the  private \nsector.  Revenues for these activities will be derived from leasing the facilities, and are based on \ninvestment  recovery  over  5  years,  plus  a  2%  real  annual  increase  of  rental  fee.  Costs  are \nassociated with regular O&M of the facilities, estimated at 2.5% of fixed asset gross book value. \nThe implementation period of the municipal facilities varies significantly: blocks of public toilets \ncan be leased immediately upon completion; the construction of slaughterhouses will take one \nyear,  truck  terminals  2  years,  and  bus  terminals  3  years  based  on  the  experience  with  the \nSecondary Towns Infrastructure Development Project  II.   \n \nFor  markets,  it  is  assumed  that  Pourashavas  will  lease  out  shops  to  individuals  rather \n20. \nthan to a single leaseholder. Four different development levels are proposed (41, 62, 75, and 83 \nshops), depending on the size of the Pourashava. It is estimated that 60% of the total floor area \nwill  be  leased  out,  with  each  shop  having  a  floor  area  of  11.24  square  meters.  The  rental  per \nsquare meter is Tk200 per month, with a real annual increase of 2%. Additional income will be \nobtained from trade licenses, assessed at Tk500 per annum. O&M is 2.5% of fixed assets.  \n \n21. \nFinancial evaluations were prepared to develop different types of municipal facilities: The \nFIRR  is  estimated  at  12.9%  for  a  bus  terminal  in  Narsinghdi,  19.1%  for  a  slaughterhouse  in \nNarayanganji, and 14.5% for markets in Mehepur.   \n \nF. \n \n22. \nThe  slum  improvement  component  consists  of  provision  of  tubewells,  pit  latrines, \ndustbins and street lighting, plus construction of footpaths and microdrainage. The scope of the \nphysical  investments  in  each  slum  area  is  based  on  the  number  of  low-income  households. \nSince most activities under the slum improvement component are aimed at reducing morbidity \nlevels  through  the  introduction  of  higher  sanitation  standards,  one  of  the  benefits  could  be \nhealth  expenditure  savings.  However,  since  family  health  expenditure  data  collected  by  the \nsocioeconomic  survey  are  not  entirely  reliable,  benefits  are  taken  in  the  form  of  productivity \ngains,  quantified  as  follows:  (i)  10  working  days  equivalent  gained  by  the  wage  earner,  (ii)  10 \nworking days equivalent gained by the housekeeper from reduced child morbidity levels, and (iii) \n30 minutes per day saved by women due to the closer proximity of clean piped water supplies.  \nFor  economic  analysis,  it  is  conservatively  assumed  that  the  economic  value  of  the  nonwage \nearner\u2019s time is 20% of the wage earner\u2019s income. Despite this relatively modest evaluation of \nproductivity  gains,  the  base  EIRRs  for  all  22  towns  were  estimated  above  the  cut-off  rate  of \n12%.  \n\nSlum Improvement \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n57 \n\n \n\n \n \nComponent/ Location \n \n\n  \nDrainage Rehabilitation,  Kishoregonji \nRoad Improvement,  Manikganji \nSlum Improvement, Tongi \n \n \n \n\n \n \nComponent/ Location \n \n\n \nWater Supply, Lakshimipur  \nBus Terminal, Shepur \nTruck terminal, Narayanganji \nMarkets,  Mehepur \n \n \n\nTable A14.1: Summary of Economic Evaluations \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return (%) \n\n \nBase \nCase \n \n29.1 \n33.9 \n16.6 \n\nCase 1 \nCost Increase \n10% \n \n26.6 \n31.2 \n14.2 \n\nCase 2 \nBenefit \nDecrease 20% \n \n22.8 \n26.8 \n12.3 \n\nCase 3 \nCost +5% \nBenefit -10% \n \n24.8 \n29.1 \n13.8 \n\nTable A14.2: Summary of Financial Evaluations \n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return (%) \n\n \n\nBase \nCase \n \n10.3 \n12.8 \n17.4 \n14.5 \n\nCase 1 \nCost increase \n10% \n \n8.4 \n11.5 \n15.9 \n13.2 \n\nCase 2 \nBenefit \nDecrease 20% \n \n5.8 \n11.1 \n13.6 \n10.9 \n\nCase 3 \nCost +5% \nBenefit -10% \n \n7.5 \n9.8 \n14.4 \n11.8 \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 October 2002) \n", "Currency Unit \nTk1.00 \n$1.00 \n \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n \n", "taka (Tk) \n$0.01728 \nTk57.85 \n \n", " \n \n \n", " \n \n \n", "ADB \nCULG \nEIRR \nERD \nESSI \nFIRR \nFWC \nGAP \nGDP \nGPD \nICB \nIEE \nIMED \nLGD \nLGED \nMDS \nMLGRDC \n", "MPRC \nMOF \nMSU \nNGO \nO&M \nPD \nPEM \nPIU \nPMO \nPPMS \nPPRC \nSOE \nSPAR \nSTIDP \nTA \nUGIAP \nUMSU \n \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "Asian Development Bank \nCommittee on Urban Local Governments \neconomic internal rate of return \nEconomics Relations Division \nenvironment, sanitation and slum improvement \nfinancial internal rate of return \nfemale ward commissioner \ngender action plan \ngross domestic product \ngovernance program development \ninternational competitive bidding \ninitial environmental examination \nImplementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division \nLocal Government Division \nLocal Government Engineering Department \nmanagement, design, and supervision \nMinistry of Local Government, Rural Development and \nCooperatives \nMunicipal Performance Review Committee \nMinistry of Finance \nmunicipal services unit \nnongovernment organization \noperation and maintenance \nproject director \nperformance evaluation and monitoring \nproject implementation unit \nproject management office \nProject Performance Management System \nPourashava Performance Review Committee \nstatement of expenditures \nsubproject appraisal report \nSecondary Towns Infrastructure Development Project \ntechnical assistance \nurban governance improvement action program \nUrban Management Support Unit \n \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n", "(i) \n", "  \n(ii) \n", "NOTES \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 30 June.
