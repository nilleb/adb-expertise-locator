I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Yunnan  Chuxiong  Urban  Environment \nImprovement Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will support socially inclusive and environmentally sound development in \nthree small and medium-sized cities in Chuxiong Municipality, Lufeng County, and Wuding \nCounty in Yunnan Province. It will (i) reduce flood risks and enhance public amenities, (ii) \nimprove sanitation and public health, (iii) expand urban road networks, and (iv) promote public \nparticipation in urban development.2 By supporting the development of three cities comprising \nthe central Yunnan city cluster, the project will contribute to regional economic integration \nbetween the PRC and the other countries of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS).  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Yunnan, one of the 12 less-developed municipality, provinces and autonomous regions \ntargeted under the PRC\u2019s Western Development Strategy, is landlocked, mountainous, and \nhilly. Sharing 4,060 kilometers (km)  of border with the Lao People's Democratic Republic, \nMyanmar and Viet Nam, its location provides it with a particular geographical advantage of \nemerging as an important national transport and trade gateway for the western inland PRC to \nconnect with the neighboring countries of the GMS. Because of this, Yunnan is endowed with \nan opportunity to support the PRC\u2019s greater geographical balance in social and economic \ndevelopment across the country. Since 2001, it has added 55,099 km of national roads and \nhighways to expand the transportation links within Yunnan as well as with those neighboring \nGMS countries.3 Despite its development potential, Yunnan\u2019s economy has grown more slowly \nthan those of the other Western inland provinces and autonomous regions. The provincial per \ncapita gross domestic product in 2012 was $3,505, only 58% of the PRC average of $6,093. \nAlthough the provincial capital of Kunming is strategically located at the junction of three major \nGMS transport corridors, Yunnan\u2019s share in the PRC\u2019s trade with the other GMS countries \ndeclined steadily from 20% to 16% during 2001\u20132012.4 \n  \n4.  A key constraint on Yunnan\u2019s socioeconomic growth and economic integration into the \nGMS is its low urbanization rate and the poor competitiveness of its second- and third-tier \ncities.5 Despite rapid development in the capital city of Kunming, many of the province\u2019s small \nand  medium-sized  cities  suffer  from  inadequate  basic  infrastructure  and  remain  isolated \neconomically. Under its 12th five-year plan covering 2011\u20132015, Yunnan aims to stimulate its \nsocioeconomic  growth  by  developing  clusters  of  cities  with  a  variety  of  industries  and \ncommercial activities to create economic growth poles. Yunnan needs a strong support to \ndevelop economically and commercially competitive second- and third-tier cities and their city \nclusters to transform the regional transport corridors already established through the province\u2019s \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided technical assistance to prepare the project: ADB. 2011. Technical \nAssistance  to  the  People's  Republic  of  China  for  Preparing  the  Yunnan  Chuxiong  Urban  Infrastructure \nDevelopment Project. Manila (TA 7891-PRC). \n3  Yunnan Bureau of Statistics. 2013. Yunnan Statistical Year Book 2013. Kunming. \n4  Kunming is located on the northern, eastern, and north\u2013south corridors of the GMS. During 2001\u20132012, annual \ntrade between the PRC and other GMS countries increased from $10.8 billion to $131.8 billion. Yunnan\u2019s share \ngrew from $2.2 billion to $21.0 billion over the same period. \n5  Yunnan urbanization rate was 39% in 2012, compared with the national average of 53%. ", "2 \nrapid highway expansion program into corridors of economic development. \n \n5.  The three project cities are key centers of the Chuxiong Yi autonomous prefecture, \nwhich lies 165 km west of Kunming. The prefecture is especially important to government efforts \nto (i) strengthen socioeconomic links between Kunming and the surrounding small and medium-\nsized cities and thereby enhance the overall economic competitiveness of the central Yunnan \ncity cluster, and (ii) promote regional economic cooperation between Yunnan and the other \nGMS  countries,  since  the  prefecture  is  a  western  gateway  to  Myanmar.6 However,  urban \nexpansion has been limited in the three cities by their predominantly hilly and mountainous \nterrain. Like other small and medium-sized centers in the province, living conditions and their \nbusiness and investment environments have been degraded by inadequate flood management \nand  poor  sanitation  services.  Their  weak  urban  infrastructure  is  holding  back  not  only \nsocioeconomic development for their residents but also wider regional economic integration \nacross the province.7   \n \n6.  The  Yunnan  Chuxiong  Urban  Environment  Improvement  Project  will  provide  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) lending for second- and third-tier city development of the province \nthrough various new approaches. It will include measures to address the frequent flooding in \nthree cities and their surrounding agricultural lands that currently restricts their city expansion \nand  economic  development.  Although  the  PRC  generally  relies  heavily  on  engineering \nmeasures to contain flooding, the project will adopt an ecologically sound, climate resilient \ndesign  that  will  balance  engineering  measures  with  river  ecosystem  conservation  and  the \nenhancement of public amenities. Based on international good practice, it will also introduce the \nuse of storm water detention ponds in Yunnan to mitigate downstream impacts and pollution \nfrom storm water runoff.8 The poor sanitation in the project cities results from their inability to \nhandle the growing amounts of solid waste and their inadequate sewage pipeline networks. The \nproject will help each city develop comprehensive solid waste management plans and will raise \npublic  awareness  of  the  need  to  reduce,  reuse,  and  recycle  waste.  The  project  will  also \ndemonstrate how construction of city roads with added functions of harvesting rainwater and \nintercepting sewage from surrounding villages can improve the city environment. The roads will \nalso be equipped with energy-saving streetlights. The project will strongly encourage the public \nto participate in river landscaping and city planning to reflect public priorities.  \n \n7.  The project is in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for the PRC.9 It \naligns with ADB\u2019s water operational plan by incorporating socially inclusive and integrated water \nresource management principles.10 It is also in line with the aims of ADB\u2019s urban operational \nplan to enhance the competitiveness and livability of cities through urban development.11 By \npromoting sustainable urbanization and a better balance in the currently uneven growth and \ndevelopment of the PRC\u2019s regions, the project also supports the PRC\u2019s 12th Five-Year Plan, \n                                                \n6  ADB approved three loan projects to develop the GMS northern corridor connecting Chuxiong and Ruili, a city on \nthe border between Myanmar and the PRC: ADB. 1994.

ADB has previous experience in water supply, highway, railway, and urban and rural \nroad projects in Yunnan. Project preparation has incorporated lessons from these projects, \nincluding  the  need for (i) sound  institutional  arrangements, (ii)  strong project  management \nsupport  during  project start-up,  and (iii)  comprehensive  capacity  building  on  ADB  policies, \nguidelines, and procedures for procurement and contract management.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact will be more competitive, green, and inclusive city development in Chuxiong \nMunicipality,  Lufeng  County,  and Wuding  County  that  will  support  the  development  of  the \ncentral Yunnan city cluster. The outcome will be the improvement of the urban infrastructure \nand the environment in cities of Chuxiong Municipality, Lufeng County, and Wuding County. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n10.

Interest during construction for \nthe domestic bank loan has been computed at the domestic rate of 8.8%. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n15.  The government has requested a loan of $150.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 6 years, a 10% annuity repayment option, an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, the interest during construction to be capitalized in the \nloan, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \nBased on this, the average loan maturity is 18.53 years and the maturity premium payable to \nADB is 0.20% per annum. The ADB loan will also finance taxes and duties for eligible ADB-\nfinanced expenditures and transportation and insurance costs included in the base cost for \nensuring smooth project implementation. The loan will finance 36.5% of the project cost. The \ngovernment  will  finance  $175.7  million  through  counterpart  funds  from  the  three  project \nmunicipal  and  county  governments.  The  remaining  $84.7  million  will  be  financed  by  local \ndomestic banks (Table 2). \n \n16.  The PRC is the borrower of the loan and will make the loan available through the \nYunnan provincial government (YPG) and the Chuxiong Yi autonomous prefecture government \n(CPG) to the three project municipal and county governments on the same terms and conditions \nas those of the ADB loan. The project municipal and county governments will assume the \n ", "5 \nforeign exchange and interest variation risks of the ADB loan.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n18.  The project is technically feasible as a result of a detailed examination of the project\u2019s \ncompatibility with the PRC\u2019s engineering guidelines, local conditions, the level of flood protection \nrequired, the minimization of environment impacts, the projections of traffic demand and waste \ngeneration, and the need for earthquake proofing. The existing water supply plants, wastewater \ntreatment plants, and landfills have enough capacity to support the project. Alternative technical \noption  analysis  identified  appropriate  slope  protection  and  river  cross-section  design,  the \npreferred  road  alignments,  and  their  cross-sections  in  terms  of  economic  and  safeguards \naspects. The project promotes climate resilience by installing and upgrading flood monitoring \nand early warning systems. The project will provide capacity development training to ensure \nsustainable operation and maintenance (O&M) of project facilities. The project\u2019s demonstration \nfeatures were technically supported by (i) river course designs that retain natural hydrological \nfeatures  and  habitat  diversity,  reduce  water  pollution,  and  improve  public  access  to  the \nwaterfront; (ii) improved storm water pipeline alignments for storm water detention ponds; (iii) \nprovision  of  waste  handling  vehicles  and  equipment  to  promote  the  reuse,  reducing,  and \nrecycling of waste; (iv) sewage interception facilities; and (v) road designs with nonmotorized \ntransport lanes, rainwater collecting pits to store water for landscaping, and energy-efficient \nstreetlights.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n19.  Economic analysis. The economic analysis evaluated technical options and confirmed \nthat all subprojects were the least-cost ways to support the CPG\u2019s long-term development plans \nand the master plans of cities in project municipality and counties. Economic internal rates of \nreturn were computed at 15.3% for the project overall, 16.1% for the Chuxiong subproject, \n12.7%  for  the  Lufeng  subproject,  and  17.4%  for  the  Wuding  subproject.  All  exceed  the \neconomic opportunity cost of capital of 12.0%. Project\u2019s quantified economic benefits include (i) \nsavings in vehicle operating costs and time, (ii) the avoidance of flood damage through the \nproject\u2019s flood protection measures, and (iii) improved solid waste management. The economic \ncosts  comprise  (i)  the  capital  costs,  including  physical  contingencies,  and  (ii)  O&M  costs. \nSensitivity analysis showed that the project\u2019s overall economic internal rate of return would  drop \nto 12.5% under the combined impacts of a 10.0% reduction in benefits, a 1-year implementation \ndelay, and a 10.0% capital cost overrun. The actual economic benefits may be higher than the \nbasic projections because the following benefits were not quantified in the evaluation: (i) the \nqualitative benefits of improved sanitation in villages that will be protected by the enhanced \nproject wastewater pipeline infrastructure with intercepting villages\u2019 untreated wastewater flows; \n(ii) the amenity benefits through enhanced public access to the improved waterside environment \nand (iii) the economic activity benefits gained through the reduction in flood events that the \nproject will ensure.15  \n \n20.  Financial sustainability analysis. Financial analysis was carried out by assessing the \nproject municipal and county governments\u2019 finances to ensure the fiscal sustainability of the \nthree  subprojects  during  the  implementation  and  operation  phases.  The  fiscal  impact  was \nassessed by comparing annual revenues from the identified financing sources of the three \ngovernments with the annual counterpart funds required for (i) capital expenditures during \nproject implementation, and (ii) recurrent costs for O&M and debt service during the operation \n                                                \n15  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nperiod. The analysis indicated that the project municipal and county governments will have \nsufficient counterpart funds during project implementation and funds for O&M and debt service \nduring operations afterwards. During implementation, annual counterpart funds and interest \npayments  required  will  be  0.4%\u20132.6%  of  the  projected  fiscal  revenues  for  the  Chuxiong \nmunicipal government, 1.1%\u20137.6% for the Lufeng county government, and 1.0%\u20133.9% for the \nWuding  county  government.  O&M  and  debt  service  requirements  will  be  0.3%\u20130.6%  of \nprojected revenues for the three governments in 2020, when principal repayment of ADB loan \nwill start. Although the analysis therefore indicates that the fiscal risk assumed by the three \ngovernments  in  financing  their  subprojects  is  acceptable,  training  will  be  conducted  to \nstrengthen their capacity for public financial management.16 \n \nC.  Governance \n \n21.  The  YPG  has  extensive  experience  in  managing  projects  financed  by  multilateral \ninstitutions, including ADB and the World Bank. Lessons are being passed from the YPG and \nthe other entities experienced in ADB projects to the CPG and the project municipal and county \ngovernments to help them implement the project effectively. Although these governments are \nnew to handling projects supported by multilateral institutions, all the project implementation \nunits (PIUs) have overseen the construction of similar projects that were financed domestically. \nProcurement and financial management capacity assessments have identified weaknesses in \nthe PIUs, including the lack of internal audit systems. These weaknesses will be addressed by \nthe project capacity development and institutional strengthening component. Through these risk \nmitigation measures, the CPG, the project municipal and county governments, and the PIUs will \ngain the ability to undertake procurement and financial management in accordance with ADB \npolicies and procedural requirements. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nand its Accountability Mechanism Policy (2012) were explained to and discussed with the CPG, \nthe  three  project  municipal  and  county  governments,  and  the  PIUs.  Under  the  YPG\u2019s \nsupervision and coordination, the CPG, the project municipal and county governments, and the \nPIUs  are  being  provided  with  support  and  knowledge  on  procurement,  public  financial \nmanagement,  and  governance  issues  by  YPG  agencies  and  personnel  experienced  in \nimplementing and meeting the requirements of projects financed by multilateral institutions in \nthe  province.  A  procurement  specialist  will  be  engaged  under  the  project  as  a  start-up \nconsultant for the CPG. A procurement agency has been engaged to support the tendering \nprocess. The project implementation consulting services will include both procurement and \nfinancial  specialists to support  project  implementation  and  conduct  training.  Specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 14). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n22.  An estimated 757,900 people will benefit directly from the project. The urban and rural \npoverty rates in the three project city areas are above the national averages. Wuding County \nhas  especially  high  urban  poverty  rate  of  16.7%.  By  improving  flood  protection  and  early \nwarning systems, upgrading sanitation and solid waste management, and building safer urban \nroads to provide access to land for city expansion, the project will contribute to balanced social \nand economic development in three cities in project municipality and counties. It will reduce \nfuture physical damage, economic loss, and farm land degradation from flooding. It will reduce \npublic health risks by improving sanitation. The project will generate economic and employment \nopportunities, especially for the urban and rural poor. The project will enhance the participation \nof local communities, including the poor, in urban planning processes and the setting of utility \n                                                \n16  Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \ntariffs. The project will demonstrate approaches for urban development for replication elsewhere \nin the province and will thereby indirectly benefit the residents of other small and medium-sized \ncities in Yunnan. A social action plan was prepared to ensure inclusive benefits. It will be \nmonitored by a resettlement and social development specialist under the project management \nconsulting service.17 \n \n23.  Gender benefits. The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. In a \nhousehold  survey  and  focus  group  discussions,  the  women  consulted  considered  the \nimprovements in traffic safety and access to transport facilities to be provided under the project \nas important benefits, since they are the primary users of public transportation and pedestrian \nsidewalks.  The  women  also  welcomed  as  particularly  beneficial  the  project\u2019s  intended \nimprovements in solid waste management; the introduction of the reduce, reuse, and recycle \nconcept; and the creation of recreational public spaces adjacent to the rivers. The project will \nimprove access to social services for women and provide them with new employment and \nincome opportunities. A gender action plan prepared for the project includes (i) a target to \nprovide at least 20% of the employment opportunities generated during construction to women, \nas well as at least 50% of the jobs for landscaping, street clearing, and solid waste collection \nduring operations; (ii) steps to ensure that women will participate in trainings on road safety, and \nwaste separation and management; (iii) the collection of sex disaggregated survey data; and (iv) \nthe monitoring of the gender action plan indicators. With the assistance of the resettlement and \nsocial development specialist under the project management consulting service, the project \nmunicipal and county governments will be responsible for implementing the gender action plan \nand reporting on progress and achievements of gender benefits under the project.18 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n24.  Environment. The project is classified category A for environment. An environmental \nimpact assessment was drafted in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) \nand  posted  on  the  ADB  website  on  18  July  2013. The  environmental  impact  assessment \nconcluded that the anticipated environmental impacts and risks can be mitigated to acceptable \nlevels  through  the  implementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan. 19  During \nconstruction,  the  focus  will  be  on  proper  earthwork  management,  soil  erosion  and  water \nresources  protection,  and  sound  construction  site  management.  During  operation,  special \nattention will be paid to mitigating traffic noise at sensitive sites and strengthening the early \nwarning system for floods, traffic safety, and solid waste management in Chuxiong Municipality, \nLufeng County, and Wuding County. Monitoring of the project\u2019s environmental performance will \nbe conducted during project construction and operation by contractors, construction supervision \ncompanies, and local environmental monitoring stations. The monitoring will be verified by an \nindependent external monitor. The CPG and the project municipal and county governments are \ncommitted to managing the identified environmental risks and have agreed on a comprehensive \nset of environment-related loan covenants and a training program with a strong emphasis on \nenvironment safeguards. Environment safeguard documents were disclosed to the affected \npeople. Potential environmental complaints or disputes will be handled in accordance with the \ngrievance redress mechanism established for the project. \n \n \n                                                \n17  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The  \nsocial action plan is included in the PAM (footnote 14). \n18  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19  The draft environmental management plan is provided as an attachment of the PAM (footnote 14). \n ", "9 \n25.  Involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  category  A  for  involuntary \nresettlement. Three resettlement plans and one resettlement and ethnic minority development \nplan were prepared in line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and were approved by ADB \nand the government. The plans were disclosed to the affected persons and uploaded to the \nADB website in October 2013. Overall, the project will affect 8,639 persons, including 652 who \nwill be relocated. The project will permanently acquire 2,261 mu of collective and state-owned \nland, and demolish 40,814 square meters of residential and nonresidential buildings.20 The \nproject municipal and county governments have assured ADB that funds for resettlement will be \nmade available on a timely basis. The capacity development and institutional strengthening \nactivities  will  include  support  for  implementing  resettlement.  The  implementation  of  the \nresettlement plans and the resettlement and ethnic minority development plan will be monitored \nand evaluated internally and externally. The three project municipal and county governments \nand PIUs have fulltime staff members responsible for land acquisition and resettlement who will \nregularly report implementation progress to the CPG and submit quarterly progress reports to \nADB. The external monitor will review the progress and general welfare of affected persons to \nassess whether they have fully regained their standard of living. Monitoring and evaluation \nreports will be prepared semiannually during implementation and annually for 2 years after \nresettlement is complete. They will be submitted to ADB and publicly disclosed. The project has \nalso established a transparent grievance mechanism that will provide meaningful consultation \nand trigger remedial action defined for the project. \n \n26.  Indigenous peoples. The project is classified category B for the indigenous peoples \nsafeguard. The majority of the population in Yunnan and in the project cities belong to more \nthan 25 ethnic minorities. Ethnic minorities in Chuxiong Municipality and Lufeng County are \nwell-integrated socially and economically in the cities and do not live in distinct communities in \nthe project areas. In Wuding County, a minority ethnic Hui village will be affected by the \nsubproject\u2019s road construction, primarily through land acquisition and the resettlement of three \nhouseholds.  Aside  from  the  land  acquisition  and  concerns  over  noise  during  construction \nactivities, no negative impacts have been identified in the village during extensive consultations. \nThe village population supports the project, which it expects to provide it with improved mobility \nand access to the city center. The education and household income levels of the ethnic minority \nand majority populations are the same in these project cities, and ethnic minorities benefit from \nmany  preferential  policies  that  provide  them  with  representation  in  politics  and  access  to \nschools and programs in rural areas for poverty alleviation. A resettlement and ethnic minority \ndevelopment plan that outlines the issues and actions for ethnic minority integration in the \nresettlement plan for the Wuding subproject was approved, disclosed to the affected persons, \nand uploaded to the ADB website in October 2013. \n \nF.
