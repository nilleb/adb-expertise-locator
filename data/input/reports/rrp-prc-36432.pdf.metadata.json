An environmental impact assessment was completed and \nthe summary was circulated to the Board on 15 July 2004. \n \nThe  Project  is  located  in  the  northwestern  part  of  Yunnan  province, \nwhich is relatively poor. The Project is designed to  promote sustainable \neconomic  growth  by  constructing  167  kilometers  (km)  of  railway  line \nfrom  Dali  to  Lijiang.  The  Project  will  develop  an  efficient,  safe,  and \nenvironmentally sustainable railway transport system in the region. The \nProject will facilitate the creation of additional employment and income-\ngenerating opportunities, thus benefiting the poor, and ethnic minorities, \nliving in the Project area.  \n \nThe Project meets the railway sector operational strategy of ADB for the \nPRC to reduce railway  network  constraints  and  to  promote  sustainable \neconomic  growth  in  poor  areas  not  served  by  railways.  The  Project  is \nalso  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  western  development  strategy  to \nprovide  less-developed  regions  with  better  infrastructure  to  facilitate \neconomic  growth,  thereby  increasing  the  opportunity  for  people  to \nimprove their living standards.  \n \nThe  poor  interior  regions  in  the  PRC  have  not  benefited  as  much  from \neconomic  growth  and  reforms  as  the  east  coast.  The  gap  in  economic \nand  social  development  has  increased.  Transport  constraints  and  high \nlogistics  costs  are  two  of  the  factors  contributing  to  regional  economic \ndisparities and are two of the constraints that prevent the western region \nfrom capitalizing on its comparative advantages. \n \nThe  Project  will  reduce  transport  constraints  in  northwestern  Yunnan \nprovince  and  provide  connectivity  to  Kunming,  Shanghai,  and  Beijing \nthrough  three  of  the  16  east-west  and  north-south  national  railway \ncorridors.  This  will  provide  accessibility  to  the  ports  of  Fangcheng  and \nBeihai in the PRC and Haiphong in Viet Nam. The Project will promote \nregional cooperation in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), of which \nthe PRC is an active participant through Yunnan province, which shares \nborders with other GMS countries. \n \nThe  Project,  a  joint-venture  railway  between  the  Ministry  of  Railways \n(MOR)  and  Yunnan  provincial  government  (YPG),  will  have  substantial \nmanagerial  and  financial  autonomy.  The  Project  will  contribute  to \nchanging  the  railway  enterprises  from  a  cost  center  in  a  planned \neconomy  to  a  profit  center  in  an  increasingly  competitive  transport \n\nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProject \nDescription \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\feconomy  to  a  profit  center  in  an  increasingly  competitive  transport \nmarket. The components are formulated in line with MOR\u2019s 2004 railway \ndevelopment plan. \n \nThe main objective of the Project  is to remove a transport constraint to \nsustainable economic growth. Providing economic railway transportation \nin  the  unserved,  less-developed,  and  poor  areas  will  help  create  the \nconditions  necessary  for  developing  local  resources  and  generating \nemployment  and  income-enhancing  opportunities  that  will  raise  living \nstandards in the project area.  \n \nThe  project  preparation  involved  participatory  processes.  Extensive \nconsultations were held with all the main stakeholders, including various \nethnic  minority  groups  (Bai,  Naxi,  Tibetans,  Mosuo,  and  Lisu), \nnongovernment  organizations,  affected  people,  potential  beneficiaries, \nmonks,  village  leaders,  local  ethnic  bureaus,  and  local  governments  in \nthe project area and the seven neighboring counties (called boundaries \nof  analysis  or  BOA).  Household  surveys  were  carried  out,  and \nparticipatory workshops were organized in the project area and the BOA \nto understand public opinion about the proposed Project, and to provide \ninputs for the social and environmental assessments. \n \nThe  Project  will  entail  constructing  167 km  of  single-track,  standard \ngauge,  Class  I  railway,  reserved  for  electrification,  between  Dali  and \nLijiang, and expanding the capacity of the existing Guangtong\u2013Dali line \n(Guangda line) to accommodate additional traffic. The Project comprises \nthe following components: (i) laying railway track consisting of rails and \naccessories,  concrete  sleepers,  and  stone  ballast;  (ii) constructing  11 \nnew railway stations complete with facilities; (iii) a safety component that \nincludes  providing  modern  technology  and  equipment  for  signaling, \ncommunications,  a  dispatch  management  information  system,  freight \nyard operation, operational safety equipment, mechanized maintenance \nof  tracks;  (iv) installing  e-governance  and  management  information \nsystems,  including  computerization  and  linking  Dali  and  Lijiang  to  the \nnational  railway  network;  (v) supply  of  environmental  mitigation  and \nprotection  equipment  and \nthe  use  and \nthe  Project;  and \nmaintenance  of  equipment  provided  under \n(vii) strengthening institutional capacity of MOR and WYRC.  \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $548 million  equivalent, \nforeign  exchange  and  $311.8 million \ncomprising  $236.2 million \nequivalent in local currency. \n \n\nfacilities;  (vi) training  on \n\nin \n\niv \n\n \n\n \nObjectives and \nScope \n\n \nCost Estimates \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nTotal \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\n                                                                                                   ($ million) \nTotal \nSource \nCost \n180.0 \n40.0 \n229.6 \n98.4 \n548.0 \n100.0 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n0.0 \n0.0 \n218.3 \n93.5 \n311.8 \n56.9 \n\n180.0 \n40.0 \n11.3 \n4.9 \n236.2 \n43.1 \n\nADB \nAFD \nMOR  \nYPG \n\nPercentage \nADB =  Asian Development Bank,  AFD = Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, MOR = \nMinistry of Railways, YPG = Yunnan provincial government. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nA  loan  of  $180 million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  will  be \nprovided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \nlending  facility.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term  including  a  grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per \nannum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan \nand Project Agreements. \n \nUntil 30 June 2010 \n\n \n31 December 2009  \n \n\n \nWest Yunnan Railway Company (WYRC)  \n\n \nThe  West  Yunnan  Railway  Company  (WYRC)  will  be  responsible  for \noverall  project  implementation,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement, \nconstruction, and commissioning of the project railway.  \n \nADB-financed  components  will  be  procured by  WYRC  in  accordance \nwith ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. Other items will be procured  in \naccordance  with  government  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Advance \naction for procurement of civil works was approved on 15 June 2004. \n \nThe ADB loan will finance  12 person-months of international consulting \nservices  for  (i) strengthening  marketing  and  business  development \nfunctions  of  WYRC;  and  (ii) researching  and  strengthening \nthe \ndevelopment,  operation,  and  management  of  the  joint-venture  railway \nsystems  in  the  PRC.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance \nwith  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  Suitable  domestic \nconsulting  services  for  project  design,  construction  supervision,  and \nconstruction  quality  control,  environmental  supervision,  procurement, \nand  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  safeguard  aspects  of  the  Project \nwill be engaged and financed by WYRC in accordance with government \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. \n \n\nFinancing Plan \n \n \n \n\n \n\nLoan Amount \nand Terms \n\n \nPeriod of \nUtilization \n \nEstimated \nProject \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting \nAgency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting \nServices \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \n\nThe  Project  will  (i) provide  the  shortest  land  route  between  Dali  and \nLijiang,  key  centers  in  Yunnan  province,  enabling  railway  freight \noperators  and  passengers  to  benefit  from  lower  transport  costs  and \nshorter  travel  distances  and  times;  (ii) increase the corridor\u2019s capacity, \nbenefiting consumers and producers of goods and services through the \nprovision  of  timely  and  efficient  transport  services  and  lower  logistics \ncosts;  (iii) generate  direct  and  indirect  employment  in  the  project-\ninfluenced area, and create jobs and income-earning opportunities (the \nconstruction  and  operation  of  the  railway  will  employ  much  local \nunskilled labor); (iv) provide an area that lacked adequate cost-efficient \ntransportation services with access to broader markets; and (v) stimulate \nlocal  development  through  tourism,  railway  station  area  development, \nand other infrastructure elements to maximize the railway\u2019s benefits.  \n \nThe  increased  tax  revenues  generated  by  the  economic  development \ninduced by the Project will help finance improved social service facilities \nand basic infrastructure. \n \nThe major project beneficiaries will be  (i) freight  users  who  will  switch \nfrom the existing Class II road and  benefit  from more affordable, faster, \nand  safer  trips;  (ii) passengers, including  tourists,  who  will benefit from \naffordable,  faster,  and  safer  trips;  (iii) the  local  population  who  will \nbenefit from the lower prices of commodities and services transported by \nthe project railway; (iv) local labor involved  in construction work and  the \nsupply  of  materials  during  implementation  and  in  loading/unloading \nduring the operation of the railway; (v) local farmers who will be able to \nsell  their  products  at  market  prices  without  paying  a  high  margin  to a \ntransport  intermediary;  (vi) local  manufacturers  and  traders  who  can \nincrease  production  capacity  or  establish  businesses  and  will transport \ntheir goods and services by the railway; and (vii) local governments who \nwill  benefit  from  the  increased  opportunity  for  local  area  development \nand increased revenues. \n \nThe Project will benefit about 1.1 million people living in the project area, \nwhich includes Dali county, Heqing county, and Lijiang city. Seventy-five \npercent of the beneficiaries live in rural areas, and 30% are poor with an \nannual  net  income  per  capita  of  less  than  CNY900.  The  poverty  and \nsocial  assessment  looked  at  the  seven  counties  of  the  BOA,  namely \nEryuan  and  Jianchuan  counties  in  Dali  Bai  prefecture,  Ninglang  and \nYongsheng  Counties  in  Lijiang  prefecture,  Weixi  and  Xianggelila \n(Zhongdian)  counties  in  Diqing  prefecture,  and  Lanping  county  in \nNujiang  prefecture.  About  91%  of  the  population  living  in  the  BOA  is \nrural  and  the  poverty  incidence  is  more  than  60%.  The  links  between \npoverty, minorities, difficult topography, and poor transport systems are \napparent  in  the  project  area  for  the  proposed  Dali-Lijiang  railway. \nPoverty is often caused by geographic remoteness and isolation, limited \ntransport  access,  high  transport  costs,  and  poor  access  to  market \ninformation  as  well  as  limited  access  to  health,  education,  and  other \nsocial services. \n\n\f \n\nvii \n\n \n \nThe  Project  will  facilitate  the  creation  of  additional  employment  and \nincome-generating opportunities. About 96,800 person-years of work will \nbe  created  during  construction.  This  will  provide  direct  employment \nopportunities to over 7,000 poor people, the majority of whom are ethnic \nminorities. Railway  station  area  development  will  increase  incomes  in \nlocal  communities  and  help  generate  local  revenues.  The  Project  will \nfacilitate  the  development  of  local  industry  and  tourism,  which  will  help \ngenerate  additional  opportunities  in  the  future  for  local  people,  who  as \nethnic  minorities,  prefer  to  remain  in  their  native  lands.  Consultations \nwith  the  ethnic  minorities  (such  as  the  Naxi,  Bai,  Tibetans,  Yi,  and \nMosuo)  in  the  project  area  and  the  BOA  indicated  their  strong  support \nfor the Project. \n \nThe  Project  is  financially  and  economically  sustainable.  The  6.7% \nfinancial internal rate of return exceeds the 4.5% weighted average cost \nof capital. The economic internal rate of return is estimated at 17%.  \n \nThe  railway  will  be  constructed  in  mountainous  terrain,  which  is  a \nsignificant  technical  challenge.  The  associated  physical  risks  include \ndelays,  cost  overruns,  worker  health  and  safety,  and  environmental \nimpacts.  These  potential  risks  have  been  assessed  and  appropriate \nmitigating measures provided. \n \nResettlement will affect about 8,000 people. The railway alignment was \nselected  to  minimize  resettlement,  where  possible.  The  resettlement \nplan includes preferential treatment for employment during construction, \nsupply  of  local  materials,  allocation  of  commercial  space  near  railway \nstations, and job training.  \n \nSome  of  the  economic  development  induced  by  the  new  railway  line \nmay  have  indirect,  adverse  impacts  for  some  ethnic  minorities.  To \nreduce  this  potential  risk,  special  measures  have  been  included  in  the \nresettlement plan and the ethnic minorities development plan  to mitigate \nthe effects of social risks such as impoverishment and social exclusion, \nand  to  ensure  compliance  with  ADB's  social  safeguard  policies.  A \ncomprehensive  monitoring  system  has  been  included  in  the  Project  to \nmonitor  the  impacts  of  development  activities  and  to  take  appropriate \nmeasures to reduce their impact. \n \nIntermodal  competition  among  railways  and  roads  will  create  market \nrisks  to  the  project  railway.  However,  the  existing  road  is  already \ncongested and the capacity constraint is expected to worsen. Surveys of \nfreight  operators  and  passengers  found  that  the  railway  would  have \nseveral  advantages  over  other  transport  modes:  lower  fares,  shorter \ntravel  times,  safety,  and  punctuality.  The \nincreasing  commercial \norientation of the joint-venture railway will help to lessen the risks posed \nby intermodal competition. \n \n \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fviii \n\n \n\nThe Technical \nAssistance \n\nThe TA for Support to Ethnic Minorities Development Plan, for $150,000 \nequivalent,  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  from  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding \nprogram.

The  report  also \ndescribes the proposed technical assistance (TA) for Support to  Ethnic Minorities Development \nPlan and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me \nby the Board, will approve the TA.  \n \nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis  \n\n2. \nFrom 1978, when market-oriented economic reforms were introduced, through to 2003, \nthe  PRC  has  experienced  sustained  rapid  economic  growth,  which  has  resulted  in  an \naccordingly  rapid  increase  in  demand  for  transportation.  The  annual  growth  of  passenger \ntransport was 9.2% and freight transport grew at 7.1% during the 1978\u20132003 period. In 2003, \nroad  traffic  accounted  for  55.8%  of  total  passenger-kilometers (km) followed by railways with \n34.7%, civil aviation with 9.1%, and coastal and inland waterways with 0.5%. The modal split for \nfreight ton-kilometers (ton-km) was 53.3% for coastal and inland waterways, 32% for railways, \n13.2% for roads, 1.4% for pipelines, and 0.1% for civil aviation.  \n \nRailways are one of the primary mode of transport for long distance and bulk transport. \n3. \nAt  the  end  of  2003,  the  PRC\u2019s  railway  system  comprised  a  total  of  73,000  route-km, of which \n60,446 km  are  national,  and  12,554 km  are  joint-venture  and  local  railways.  The  national \nrailways  are  state  owned  and  operated  as  an  integrated  system  by  the  Ministry  of  Railways \n(MOR).  The  joint-venture  and  local  railways  consist  of  regional  lines  within  provincial \nboundaries, and are constructed under the sponsorship of provincial governments and/or MOR \nto  serve  local  needs  and  provide  interconnection  to  the  national  railway  network.  Despite  its \nlarge size, the railway network does not provide adequate coverage for the country\u2019s population \nand land area.1  \n \n4. \nPRC railways have the highest freight transport density in the world and  second-highest \npassenger  transport  density  after  Japan.  Locomotive  turnover  is  the  highest  in  the  world. \nBetween  1978  and  2003,  railway  freight  grew  from  535 billion  ton-km  to  1,725 billion  ton-km, \nequivalent  to  an  annual  growth  rate  of  4.8%,  while  passenger  traffic  grew  at  6.1%  annually, \nincreasing from 109 billion passenger-km to 479 billion passenger-km. The average distance for \nrailway journeys increased from 134 km in 1978 to 492 km in 2003, compared with the average \njourney  per  passenger  on  roads,  which  grew  from  35 km  to  53 km  over  the  same  period. \nDespite  such  growth  rates,  the  railways\u2019  capacity  has  lagged  behind  demand,  resulting,  for \nexample, in delays in delivering coal to power plants, which in turn, have contributed to power \nshortages.  Given  the  railways\u2019  important  role  in  providing  economic  transportation,  these \ncapacity limitations, if not removed, will continue to adversely affect efficient economic growth. \nBecause  of  these  concerns,  the  Government  has  adopted  an  aggressive  plan  to  improve  the \nrailways  and  has  planned  network  extensions  and  construction  in  underserved  areas.  The \nproposed  Project  will  support  this  plan.  A  project  framework  that  outlines  the  goal,  purpose, \noutputs,  and  activities/inputs  is  in  Appendix 1  and  a  problem  and  constraint  analysis  is  in \nAppendix 2. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  The network density per 1,000 square km of land is one third that of India and one tenth that of Japan. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nGovernment Strategy  \n\n(iv) reducing  operating  subsidies \n\nthrough  appropriate  pricing  and \n\n5. \nThe Government's policy for railway development is focused on (i) removing constraints \nand expanding the capacity of the system, (ii) encouraging the construction of joint-venture local \nrailways to promote the development of local economies, (iii) improving the efficiency and safety \nof the existing system by using new technology and modern management tools in planning and \noperation, \nthe \ncommercialization  of  services,  (v) initiating  institutional  and  structural  reforms  to  increase \nautonomy and accountability, and (vi) encouraging nongovernment investment in infrastructure \nand related services.  \n \nThe  10th  Five-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005)  identifies  transportation,  including  railway \n6. \ndevelopment, as a priority. The plan envisages (i) constructing 6,000 km of new lines to provide \naccess  to  unserved  areas,  with  the  network  length  reaching  a  total  of  75,000  route-km; \n(ii) providing  3,000 km  of  double  lines  and  electrifying  5,000 km  of  key  lines  to  increase \ncapacity;  and  (iii) increasing  operating  speeds  on  5,000 km  with  the  total  length  of  such  high-\nspeed lines reaching 15,000 km. A total investment of CNY350 billion, including CNY270 billion \non  capital  construction  and  CNY80 billion  for  rolling  stock,  is  planned  for  the  railway  sector. \nDuring  2003\u20132007, \nto  reach \nCNY450 billion (Appendix 3). \n \n7. \nIn  2004,  the  State  Council  approved  the  new  railway  development  plan  covering  the \nperiod up to 2020. The plan seeks to expand the railway network from 72,000 km to 85,000 km \nby 2010, and to 100,000 km by 2020. Increasing train speeds is a major goal. Train speeds will \nbe  raised  to  over  200 km  per  hour  on  the  trunk  network  by  2020.  Priority  will  be  given  to  the \ndevelopment of railways in unserved areas and regions that lack transport and have remained \nless developed. The route network length will reach 16,000 km in the western region of the PRC \nby  2020.  To  improve  operational  efficiency,  steps  will  be  taken  to  separate  passenger  and \nfreight trains on key rail corridors. \n \n\nfor  capital  construction  are  expected \n\ninvestments \n\nthe \n\n2. \n\nADB\u2019s Strategy and Sector Experience \n\nADB's  strategy  for  the  railway  sector  focuses  on  helping  to:  (i) expand  the  railway \n8. \nsystem  by  constructing  new  lines  in  unserved,  less-developed  areas;  (ii) modernize  and \nincrease  the  capacity  to  improve  efficiency  on  key  routes  of  the  national  railway  system; \n(iii) commercialize  railway  operations  to  sustain  efficient  operations;  and  (iv) increase railway \ncompetitiveness in the transport sector through restructuring and reform. ADB has focused on \nthe  development  of  railways  in  poor,  less-developed  inland  provinces  to  promote  sustainable \neconomic  growth  and  reduce  poverty.  ADB  has  provided  11  loans  totaling  $2.06 billion  to \nfinance  the  construction  of  about  1,754 km  of  seven  provincial  railways  operated  by  joint \nventures with MOR, and 4,138 km of new railway lines under the four national railway projects \n(Appendix 4). The proposed Project, designed to promote economic growth by providing railway \ntransportation  in  unserved,  less-developed,  and  poor  areas  in  northwestern  Yunnan,  is \nconsistent with the PRC\u2019s development priorities and ADB\u2019s railway sector strategy for the PRC. \n \n\n3. \n\nPolicy Dialogue  \n\n9. \nPolicy  dialogue  has  been  a  feature  of  ADB  assistance  to  the  railway  sector  and  has \neffectively complemented the lending operations. Since 1989, 10 TAs totaling $4.6 million have \nbeen provided for institutional development of local railways, tariff and organizational studies for \nthe  Jing-Jiu  railway,  the  enhancement  of  commercial  and  business  operations,  marketing  and \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nbusiness  development,  developing  human  resources,  and  improving  systems  of  financial \nmanagement and accounting (Appendix 4).  \n\n \n\n10. \nProgress  has  been  achieved  as  MOR  has  adopted  a  structured  approach  to  railway \nreform. A new management concept, the Asset Operating Liability System, was introduced as a \npilot project in 1999. Under this system, MOR entered into management contracts with railway \nadministrations  to  improve  profitability.  The  management  contracts  helped  improve  the \noperational and financial performance of the railway administrations. The system was extended \nto all 14 railway administrations. Separation of core and noncore businesses is a key element of \nMOR\u2019s  restructuring  program.  The  number  of  employees  in  the  core  transportation  business \nwas  reduced  from  1.89 million  in  1997  to  1.48 million  in  2002.  In  the  noncore  transportation \nbusiness, five large companies employing 616,500 staff have been divested. To provide jobs for \nredundant staff, by the end of 2002 MOR had set up 7,681 diversified businesses (independent \nof  the  core  transportation  business),  employing  more  than  400,000  staff  to  supply  equipment, \ngoods, and services to the railway industry. In 1998, MOR initiated a cost-sharing scheme for \nhealth  insurance  and  pensions  for  railway  employees.  Since  2000,  225  educational  institutes, \n10 universities, and 13 hospitals have been transferred to local governments, and 120 branch \nlines  comprising  7,800 km  of  route  have  been  separated  to  improve  productivity  and  reduce \noperating losses. The reform agenda matrix is in Appendix 5. \n \nThe  emphasis  on  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  with  MOR  in  the  railway  sector  covers: \n11. \n(i) poverty  reduction  as  the  overarching  objective  of  ADB\u2019s  operations,  (ii) full compliance with \nADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies,  (iii) sector  reforms,  (iv) marketing  and  business  development, \n(v) private sector participation and nongovernment financing, and (vi) regional cooperation. The \n2004 railway development plan defines the major goals for the railways to 2020, and is in broad \nagreement  with  the  ADB\u2019s  strategic  agenda.  MOR  seeks  to:  (i) study  and  learn  from  best \ninternational  practices  worldwide;  (ii) separate  core  operations  from  noncore  transportation \nbusinesses;  (iii) rationalize  and  reduce  the  numbers  of  staff;  (iv) reform the railway investment \nand financing system; and (v) establish specialized transportation companies. \n \n\na. \n\nPoverty Reduction \n\n12. \nThe  strategic  purpose  of  the  Project  is  to  create  conditions  for  sustainable  economic \ngrowth  to  help  improve  living  standards  in  the  project  area.  The  Project  is  located  in  an \nunserved  area,  which  has  the  potential  for  economic  growth  once  improved,  cost-effective \ntransport access is provided. Identifying ways to enhance the Project\u2019s poverty reduction impact \nhas been an integral part of project planning and design. Specific features of project design to \nhelp enhance project benefits for the poor include:  (i) providing employment during construction \nand  operation  of  the  Dali\u2013Lijiang  Railway  (DLR)  on  a  preferential  basis  to  poor  workers;2 \n(ii) encouraging the use of locally produced materials that meet the requirements of quality and \neconomy; (iii) including provisions for railway station area development; (iv) using station access \nand  construction  access  roads  to  more  widely  distribute  the  Project's  benefits;  and \n(v) encouraging the use of poverty reduction programs of local governments to complement the \npoverty reduction efforts of the Project.3 The Project will finance 251 km of construction access \nroads, which will be handed over to local governments at the end of the construction period. The \nlocal governments have a 5-year plan to improve the road network and transport services in the \nproject  area  concurrently  with  the  Project.  Such  roads  will  reach  most  of  the  provincially \n                                                 \n2 \n\nIn  the  Guizhou-Shuibai  Railway  Project,  the  proportion  of  the  poor  in  unskilled labor was 41% on average and \n64% during peak construction.  \n\n3  Some  completed  projects  reported  that  about  40%  of  the  poor  at  appraisal  were  raised  above  the  poverty  line \nupon  project  completion.  The  Hefei-Jiujiang  Railway  Project  showed  41%  of  the  poor  were  raised  above  the \npoverty line from 1992 to 1997.  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\ndesignated poverty villages. The Project and the complementary local development will ensure \nwelfare gains for the poor and help spread project benefits more widely in the project area. \n \n\nb. \n\nSector Reforms \n\nADB  is  supporting  institutional  reform  of  the  PRC  railway  sector  to  separate  the \n13. \nGovernment\u2019s  function  and  the  enterprise  function,  giving  full  play  to  market  forces  and \nincreasing  the  competitiveness  of  the  railways.  Separation  of  core  transport  business  from \nnoncore transport business, segmentation of passenger and freight services, and  strengthening \nof the recently corporatized specialized transportation companies will be actively pursued under \nthe  Project.  As  part  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  with  MOR,  three  large  companies  handling \ncontainers, special goods, and express parcels are in the process of separation. A notification to \nthis  effect  was  issued  on  28  December  2003. 4  This  issue  will  be  further  pursued  during  the \nimplementation  of  the  Project.  Rationalization  of  staff  and  reduction  of  transportation  and \nnontransportation staff numbers will also be pursued. ADB will continue supporting operational \nreforms,  including  emphasis  on  safety  and  the  introduction  of  safe  and  reliable  technology, \nupgrading  speeds,  introduction  of  dedicated  passenger  and  freight  lines,  modern  dispatch \ncontrol  systems,  and  high-quality  information  systems  on  the  railway  network.  The  PRC\u2019s \naccession  to  the  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO)  in  December  2001  has  intensified \ncompetition  among  different  transport  modes  and  the  structure  of  transport  demand  may \nchange.5 ADB has provided an advisory TA for policy reform related to WTO accession.6 During \nproject  processing,  close  coordination  was  maintained  with  the  World  Bank  and  a  common \napproach  to  reforms  and  assistance  was  developed.  Policy  coordination with the World Bank \nwill be continued during project implementation. \n \n\nc. \n\nMarketing and Business Development  \n\n14. \nAs the PRC progresses to a market economy, the railways will need to compete on the \nbasis of price and service quality to provide transportation services to an increasingly diversified \nand  discriminating  market.  New  marketing  and  business  development  initiatives  are  needed \nboth for freight and passenger services to be competitive. In past projects, ADB has supported \nproject-specific studies to create marketing and business development opportunities, including \nskills  and  knowledge  for  market-oriented  operation,  and  to  create  awareness  of  profitable \noperations. These initiatives will be pursued under the Project  through a West Yunnan Railway \nCompany (WYRC) capacity-development program.  \n \n\nd. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation  \n\n15. \nADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  has  been  designed  to  encourage  the  participation  of  the  private \nsector  in  the  railway  sector  in  the  provision  of  services,  construction, tourism, container, and \nparcel  related  businesses.  Establishing  a  large  container  terminal  at  Kunming  will  facilitate \nparticipation  of  shipping  lines  and  freight  forwarders  in  the  business  of  rail-transported \ncontainers.  Under  the  Project,  container-handling  facilities  will  be  set  up  at  Lijiang.  MOR  will \nencourage the development of industrial sidings, station facilities, local tourism, and real estate. \nActivities such as track maintenance, maintenance of electric power cables, loading/unloading, \n\n                                                 \n4  These  companies  are  China  Railway  Container  Transport  Co.  Ltd,  China  Railway  Special  Goods  Co.  Ltd,  and \nChina Railway Express Parcel Co. Ltd. The startup process is ongoing.  Separation of container businesses had \nbeen agreed to between MOR and ADB as part of the ADB-financed Yichang-Wanzhou Railway Project.  \n\n5  Since opening up the freight transport market to foreign companies under WTO  commitments, two joint-venture \n\ncompanies with foreign participation have entered the market. \n\n6  ADB. 2004.

All of these actions will enhance opportunities for \nprivate sector participation. \n \n\n4. \n\nLessons Learned \n\nExperience from completed and ongoing ADB-financed railway projects in the PRC shows \n16. \nstrong commitment and generally satisfactory capabilities of the executing agencies (EAs) with \nregard  to  project  implementation.  The  speed  of  implementation  has  generally  exceeded  the \nexpectations  at  the  time  of  appraisal.  The  EAs  generally  complied  with  the  loan  covenants. \nResettlement  and  environmental  management  were  carried  out  satisfactorily.  Audit  covenants \nwere complied with in a timely manner, and the audited financial statements were found generally \nacceptable. Of ADB\u2019s 11 railway projects, five7 are complete, three8 have started trial operations, \nand three9 are being implemented. \n \n17. \nThe key lessons from the postevaluation and project completion reports of the previous \nrailway projects highlight the need to: (i) ensure that the EA established for project processing \nand  implementation  is  also  responsible  for  project  operations;  (ii) prepare  realistic  traffic \nforecasts; (iii) review constraints to traffic on a network basis, as well as the impact on project \nviability  of  the  existing  and/or  planned  railway  lines  and  other  transportation  modes  that  may \ncompete  with  the  project  facilities;  and  (iv) finance  railway  projects  with  appropriately \ndetermined  debt-equity ratios.  The  major  lessons  learned  and  accomplishments  under  these \nprojects are given in Appendix 6. \n \n18. \nPrevious railway projects have contributed to positive socioeconomic development in the \nproject-influenced  areas.  The  main  impacts  experienced  were:  (i) new  railway  lines  in  less-\ndeveloped  regions  stimulated  economic  development  resulting  in  higher  growth  rates  of  GDP \nand rural incomes relative to the without-project scenario;10 (ii) construction activities generated \ndemand  for  unskilled  labor  and  employment  of  poor  workers  who  would  have  otherwise \nremained  unemployed  or  underemployed;11 (iii) service  roads  built  for  construction  activities \nopened  up  and  benefited  rural  communities  in  inaccessible  areas;  (iv) domestic  resource \nmobilization  improved,  providing  additional  resources  for  social  programs 12  and generating \n                                                 \n7  The  completed  railway  projects  include  Loan  948-PRC (ADB. 1989.  Shanxi-Xiaoliu  Railway  Project. Manila) for \n$39.7 million,  approved  on  31  January  1989;  Loan  1087-PRC  (ADB.  1991.  Yaogu-Maoming  Railway  Project. \nManila)  for  $67.5 million,  approved  on  20  June  1991;  Loan  1167-PRC (ADB. 1992.  Guang-Mei-Shan Railway \nProject. Manila) for $200 million, approved on 25 June 1992; Loan 1221-PRC (ADB. 1993.  Hefei Jiujiang Railway \nProject. Manila) for $110 million, approved on 30 March 1993; and Loan 1305-PRC (ADB. 1994.  Jing-Jiu Railway \nTechnical Enhancement Project. Manila) for $200 million, approved on 14 July 1994.  \n\n8  The railway projects under trial operation include Loan 1439-PRC (ADB. 1996.  Daxian-Wanxian Railway Project. \nManila) for $100 million, approved on 4 June 1996; Loan 1553-PRC (ADB. 1997. Shenmu-Yan'an Railway Project. \nManila)  for  $200 million,  approved  on  29  September  1997;  and  Loan  1626-PRC (ADB. 1998.  Guizhou-Shuibai \nRailway Project. Manila) for $140 million, approved on 18 August 1998.  \n\n9  The  railway  projects  under  implementation  include  Loan  1748-PRC  (ADB.  2000.  Hefei-Xi'an  Railway  Project. \nManila) for $300 million, approved on 17 August 2000; Loan 1850-PRC (ADB. 2001.  Ganzhou-Longyan Railway \nProject.  Manila)  for  $200 million,  approved  on  18  October  2001;  and  Loan  2051-PRC  (ADB.  2003.  Yichang \nWanzhou Railway Project. Manila) for $500 million, approved on 15 December 2003.  \n\n10  In the project area of the Jing-Jiu Railway (footnote 7) the GDP of 10 counties in Jiangxi province increased from \nCNY4.9 billion  in  1993  to  CNY15.4 billion  in  1998,  an  annual  increase  of  25.5%  compared  with  10.2%  for  the \nprovince as a whole. Rural income per capita in Xinfeng county increased from CNY802 in 1993 to CNY2,222 in \n1998, an annual increase of 18.5% compared with 10.3% during 1985\u20131992 (before the project). \n\n11  During  the  first  2  years  of  construction  of  the  Guizhou-Shuibai  Railway  (footnote  8),  a  total  of  about  7.5 million \nperson-days of employment was generated, of which 4.1 million person-days or about 55% were provided to local \npoor people, in the process raising them above the poverty line. \n\n12  The  financial  revenue  of  10  poverty  counties  in  Jiangxi  province  that  are  traversed  by  the  Jing-Jiu Railway \n(footnote  7)  increased  from  CNY0.5 billion  in  1993  to  CNY1.4 billion  in  1998,  an  annual  increase  of  22.7% \ncompared with 12.3% during 1985\u20131992, before construction of the Jing-Jiu Railway. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\ntransportation  of \n\nlocal  materials  generated  employment; \nemployment;  (v) supply  and \n(vi) improved  and  lower-cost  transport  resulted  in  lower  prices  of  agricultural  inputs  (such  as \nfertilizers), which stimulated cash-crop farming and provided more income to farmers, increased \nthe  mobility  of  rural  residents,  and  allowed  access  to  more  markets  and  employment \nopportunities  and  social  services  beyond  immediate  communities;  (vii) counties provided with \nnew railway access recorded higher GDP growth rates than other counties; (viii) the investment \nenvironment was enhanced, resulting in rapid development of secondary and tertiary industries \nthat generated employment;13 (ix) the consequent shift in the structure of employment from low-\nproductivity  agriculture  to  higher-productivity  agro-processing  and  light  industry  increased \nemployment  opportunities  for  women  whose  incomes  and  social  status  then  improved; 14 \n(x) tourism  developed  because  of  more  affordable  and  convenient  railway  travel;  and \n(xi) environmental protection and mitigation measures were taken under the projects as agreed \nat  appraisal,  and  environmental  impacts  of  induced  developments  were  addressed  in \naccordance with the environmental impact assessments (EIAs) for the projects. In summary, the \nrailway  projects  have  contributed  to  a  transformation  of  local  economies.  Per  capita  rural \nincomes in project areas increased substantially from preproject levels. Living standards were \nraised  and  poverty  was  reduced.  Finally,  the  lessons  learned  and  experience  gained  from  the \nprevious railway projects have been incorporated in the project design.  \n \n\n5. \n\nRationale \n\n19. \nThe  project  rationale  reflects  both  network  development  and  sustainable  economic \ngrowth.  The  largely  mountainous  project  area  is  not  integrated  into  the  economic  mainstream \npartly because of inadequate transportation. The existing Class II road passes through difficult \nterrain, has limited passing capacity, and is occasionally affected by rain. In spite of abundant \nnatural resources, many of the people living in this area are poor. Most people living in the area \nwork  in  agriculture,  which  is  characterized  by  a  low  level  of  profitability.  People  living  in \nmountainous  areas  supplement  their  incomes  by  engaging  in  animal  husbandry  or  becoming \nmigrant  laborers.  The  economic  growth  necessary  to  ameliorate  rural  poverty  has  failed  to \ndevelop,  partly  because  of  inadequate  transport  services  and  high  transport  costs.  Local \ngovernments  and  people  living  in  the  project  area  see  the  railway  as  a  key  investment  for \naddressing the problems of lagging economic development and poverty.  \n \n20. \nThe  railway  link  provides  connectivity  from  northwestern  Yunnan  province  to  Kunming, \nShanghai, and Beijing via three of the 16 east-west and north-south national rail corridors. This \nwill  provide  accessibility  to  the  ports  of  Fangcheng  and  Beihai.  The  Project  will  also  help  in \npromoting the regional cooperation in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), of which the PRC \nis  an  active  participant  through  Yunnan  province,  which  shares  borders  with  other  GMS \ncountries. Through the rail network, the project area will be linked to the port of Haiphong in Viet \nNam and the Pan-Asian railway. \n \n21. \nThe  Project  and  associated  developments  are  expected  to  stimulate  industrial  and \nnatural resource development as well as tourism and related industries, generate employment, \nincrease  living  standards,  and  help  reduce  poverty.  The  Project  is  a  part  of  the  Government's \n\n                                                 \n13  The  Jing-Jiu  Railway  facilitated  setting  up  a  large  number  of  resource-  and  agriculture-based  industries  in \nXingfeng  county  of  Jiangxi  province.  Their  number  increased  from  3  in  1992  to  39  in  1998,  after  project \ncompletion. The number of businesses grew from 8,005 in 1992 to 19,287 in 1998, and the number of persons \nemployed  in  these  increased  from  18,484  in  1992  to  52,153  in  1998,  an  annual  increase  of  23%.  In  the  same \ncounty  the  number  of  people  living  below  the  poverty  line  reduced  from  30,400  in  1993  to  11,580  in  1998,  a \ndecline by 62%. \n\n14  Beneficial  income  and  social  impacts  particularly  on  women  were  noted  in  the  influence  areas  of  the  Yaogu-\n\nMaoming Railway (footnote 7) and Guang-Mei-Shan Railway (footnote 7).  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nprogram  for  the  integrated  development  of  transportation  facilities,  including  upgrading  of \nhighways  and  constructing  local  roads.  Other  infrastructure,  such  as  water  supply  and \ninvestment to improve education and health care facilities, is also planned. The railway will play \nan important role in facilitating the integration of this poor and underdeveloped region, with the \ndeveloped parts of the PRC.  \n \n22. \nThe  Project  railway  will  be  a  joint-venture  railway  by  the  MOR  and  Yunnan  provincial \ngovernment  (YPG).  Joint-venture  railways,  which  account  for  7,700 km  (in  2003)  of  the  total \nlength of the PRC\u2019s system, have substantial managerial and financial autonomy. This includes \nthe  freedom  to  set  tariffs,  which  are  several  times  higher  than  those  of  the  national  network. \nFreight  and  passenger  traffic  on  joint-venture  railways  has  grown  faster  than  on the national \nrailways.  Between  1996  and  2002,  passenger  traffic  grew  by  32%  (passenger-km) and freight \nby 20.5%  (ton-km)  annually  as  compared  with  an  annual  growth  rate  of  6.8%  for  passengers \nand  3%  for  freight  on  the  national  railway  network.  Joint-venture  railways  are  more  efficient \nemployers  than  the  national  railways:  there  are  5\u20138  people  per km  employed  by  joint-venture \nrailways compared with 30 people per km for the national railways.  \n \n23. \nThe  Project  will  pursue  operational  reforms,  including  an  emphasis  on  safety  and  the \nintroduction  of  safe  and  reliable  technology,  upgrading  speeds,  and  introducing  modern \ndispatch control systems and high-quality information systems on the railway network. \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nObjective \n\nThe  main  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  remove  a  transport  constraint  to  sustainable \n24. \neconomic  growth,  thereby  helping  increase  living  standards  and  reduce  poverty  in  the  Project \narea. This will be achieved by providing affordable railway transportation in the unserved, less-\ndeveloped  areas  to  create  the  conditions  necessary  for  developing  local  resources  and  for \ngenerating employment and income-enhancing opportunities.  \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n25. \nThe  Project  will  construct  167 km  of  single-track,  standard  gauge,  Class  I  railway, \nreserved  for  electrification,  between  Dali  and  Lijiang,  and  expand  the  capacity  of  the  existing \nGuangtong\u2013Dali  line  (Guangda  line)  to  accommodate  additional  traffic.  The  Project  comprises \nthe following components:  (i) laying railway track consisting of rails and accessories, concrete \nsleepers,  and  stone  ballast;  (ii) constructing  11  new  railway  stations  complete  with  facilities; \n(iii) a safety component that includes providing modern technology and equipment for signaling, \ncommunications,  a  dispatch  management \nfreight  yard  operation, \noperational  safety  equipment,  mechanized  maintenance  of  tracks;  (iv) installing  e-governance \nand management information systems, including computerization and linking  Dali and Lijiang to \nthe  national  railway  network;  (v) supply  of  environmental  mitigation  and  protection  equipment \nand facilities; (vi) training on the use and maintenance of equipment provided under the Project; \nand  (vii) strengthening  institutional  capacity  of  MOR  and  WYRC.  The  key  inputs  needed  to \nimplement the Project include civil works, equipment, consultants, and staff of MOR and WYRC.  \n \nC. \n\ninformation  system, \n\nSpecial Features \n\n26. \nSubregional  Context.  Although  not  a  GMS  initiative,  the  Project  will  promote  regional \ncooperation  in  the  GMS.  The  Yuxi-Mengzi  (Kunming-Hekou)  railway  project  is  planned  for \nconstruction  in  2005  (under  the  10th  Five-Year  Plan).  A  link  from  Dali-Ruili,  and  from \nXishangbanna to the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), is included for construction \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nin the railway development plan (up to 2020). These three links will provide direct rail links to the \nproposed  DLR  to  south  and  southeast  Asia  through  Lao  PDR,  Myanmar,  and  Viet  Nam.  The \nimproved  connectivity  will  promote  cross-border  trade  and  stimulate  industrial  and  natural \nresource  development,  as  well  as  tourism  and  related  development  in  the  region.  The  Project \nwill  provide  direct  link  to  the  port  of  Haipong  in  Viet  Nam  and  to  the  proposed  Pan  Asian \nRailway  (Singapore-Kunming  Railway)  and  the  road  network  in  Yunnan  extending  to  Lao, \nMyanmar, and Viet Nam, thereby promoting multi-modal transport in the region (see map). \n \nCofinancing.  ADB  helped  introduce  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD)  to \n27. \nPRC officials and this is the first railway project in the PRC to be cofinanced by AFD. AFD will \ncofinance $40 million (joint cofinancing) equivalent of the project cost. \n  \nSafety.  The  PRC  railway  network  is  undergoing  major  technological  and  operational \n28. \nchanges. Improved safety is an important aspect of such development. As part of ADB\u2019s policy \ndialogue, emphasis has been placed on introducing operational reforms in the railway network. \nThis includes introducing safe and reliable technology, modernizing the maintenance systems, \nand monitoring safety performance.  A  separate  component  of  $10 million equivalent (of which \n$7.3 million will be financed by the ADB loan) is included in the Project to promote and enhance \nproject  railway  safety.  This  component  will  finance  the  procurement  of  maintenance  and \noperational equipment that will enhance safety and build capacity, including staff training. \n \nE-Governance and MIS. As part of its railway sector involvement, ADB is pursuing the \n29. \nintroduction of modern management systems and high-quality information systems. Since this is \na relatively small railway, stand-alone systems are proposed to be introduced as a pilot project. \nThese systems are scalable, and can be expanded for implementation. The Project will finance \nthe  introduction  of  a  modern  DMIS  and  the  linking  of  the  DLR  reservation  system  with  the \nnational train reservation system.  \n \n30. \nLogistics Center. Container traffic has been growing at three times the rate of ordinary \nfreight traffic. A container terminal is planned for Kunming. Facilities for handling container traffic \nexist at Dali East station and these facilities will be set up under the Project at Lijiang to attract \nhigh-value  traffic  and  to  promote  intermodal  traffic.  This  will  also  encourage  private  sector \nshippers and freight forwarders to use the facilities for exporting and importing cargo. \n \n31. \nTourism.  DLR  will  support  tourism  development.  In  2003,  5.5 million  domestic  and \n140,000  international  tourists  visited  Dali,  generating  CNY2.56 billion  in  revenues.  About \n3.1 million  domestic  and  105,000 \ntourists  visited  Lijiang,  generating \ninternational \nCNY2.04 billion.  A  separate  component  of  $10 million  is  included  in  the  project  design  to \npromote  tourism  through  the  procurement  of  special  rolling  stock  (a  \u201ctourist  train\u201d)  to  cater  to \ntourists. The consulting component will finance a study to: (i) identify how the private sector can \nbe involved, including franchising the services; and (ii) conduct a market survey and prepare a \nmarketing plan to attract tourists and other passengers.  \n \n32. \n Private Sector. The Project will promote private sector initiatives such as onboard train \nservices, including catering, cleaning, and loading/unloading at freight yards. Activities such as \nmaintenance of tracks and power cables will be outsourced. Industrial sidings will be offered to \nlarge  shippers  and  railway  station  space  will  be  rented  out  through  open  bidding  to  private \nentrepreneurs  to  enhance  their  involvement  and  optimize  the  returns  to  the  railway.  Private \nsidings, hotels, restaurants, and other facilities will be encouraged in the vicinity of the railway \nstations to maximize economic returns.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\n Reforms.  ADB  engaged  MOR  in  discussions  to  enhance  the  policy  reforms  during \n33. \nproject processing and these discussions will continue during implementation. Consolidation of \nthe Guangda line into the proposed DLR will enhance the  DLR\u2019s  financial viability and provide \nmanagerial and operational flexibility. Specific measures to outsource to the private sector some \nof the activities hitherto handled by the railways are proposed under the Project. At the national \nlevel, MOR agreed to continue the process of separating the three large specialized companies, \nseparating core and noncore activities,  and rationalizing staff. The Project will also bring in new \ntechnology, emphasize safety, and build capacity for MOR and the joint-venture railways. \n \n34. \nEthnic  Minorities  Development.  The  Project  will  facilitate  economic  development, \nwhich will benefit the largely ethnic minority population, particularly the Bai and Naxi people. In \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  social  safeguard  policies,  an  ethnic  minorities  development  plan \n(EMDP) has been prepared to ensure that adverse impacts are avoided or mitigated, and that \neconomic  development  benefits  ethnic  minorities  in  an  equitable  and  sustainable  manner. \nConsultations  with  ethnic  minority  communities  have  revealed  strong  support  for  the  Project. \nThe  cost  of  implementing  the  EMDP  will  be  covered  by  the  project  budget,  existing  local \ngovernment programs, and the small-scale TA. \n   \n35. \nStakeholder Consultation and Participation. Project preparation involved participatory \nprocesses.  Extensive  consultations  were  held  with  over  4,000  stakeholders,  including  various \nethnic minority groups (Bai, Naxi, Tibetans, Mosuo, Yi, and Lisu), nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs),  affected  people,  potential  beneficiaries,  monks,  village  leaders,  local  ethnic  bureaus, \nand  local  governments  in  the  project  area  and  the  seven  neighboring  counties  (called \nboundaries  of  analysis  or  BOA).  Consultations  included  discussions  on  project  alternatives, \nenvironmental concerns, land acquisition and resettlement issues, concerns of ethnic minorities, \nand economic development potential (Appendix 16). Over 75 village surveys and 800 household \nsurveys  were  carried  out  to:  (i) understand  public  opinion  about  the  proposed  railway, \n(ii) provide  inputs  for  the  environmental  and  social  assessments,  and  (iii) prepare  the \nresettlement  plan  and  EMDP.  Public  opinion  surveys  were  conducted  with  local  residents, \ntourists,  and  other  stakeholders.  EIA  consultation  workshops  were  held  in  Dali  and  Lijiang.  In \nAugust  2004,  a  well-publicized and interactive  consultation  workshop  was  held  in  the  project \narea  (Dali) to present the draft EMDP,  resettlement  plan,  and  the  EIA  and  to  discuss  findings \nfrom  the  consultants\u2019  studies  in  the  BOA.  In  general,  there  was  widespread  support  for  the \nProject and people look forward to the opportunities that will be generated by it. The workshop \nand  its  outputs  were  well  publicized  in  local  media,  including  newspapers.  During  project \nimplementation,  participation  of  local  people  will  be  encouraged  to  improve  the  distribution  of \nbenefits. Local groups and government agencies, including the All-China Women\u2019s Federation \nand the provincial ethnic affairs bureau, have played and will continue to play key roles in the \nprocess of consultation and participation. \n \nEmployment  Opportunities  for  Local  People . An average of 27,670 person-years of \n36. \nwork  will  be  created  per  year  during  construction.  Of  this,  about  60%  will  be  for  unskilled \nlaborers, of which 50% or more will be targeted to poor ethnic minority households. Priority will \nbe  given  to  women  and  resettlement-affected  people.  Contractors  will  conduct  training  for \nsemiskilled and skilled equipment operators and construction workers in the project area during \nthe first year of project implementation. In addition, local people meeting a minimum education \nstandard  will  be  eligible  for  a  WYRC  training  course.  On  the  basis  of  newly  acquired  skills, \nworkers will be in a position to put themselves forward for other construction work.  The use of \nlocally  produced  materials  for  railway  construction  will  generate  additional  employment  during \nrailway  construction.  The  county  poverty  reduction  offices  will  tailor  some  of  their  programs  to \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nensure  that  there  are  sustained  gains  from  employment  in  tourism,  local  freight  transport  and \nwarehousing, and other areas of induced economic development. \n \n37. \nRailway  Station  Area  Development.  The  Project  includes  the  construction  of  11 \nrailway stations, including roads connecting the stations to the nearest county or township.  The \nrailway stations, including their surrounding areas, have the potential to promote local business, \nincome-generating  activities,  and  revenues  for  local  communities.  The  stations  will  be \ndeveloped with  the participation of local communities.  Station area development will stimulate \nlocal  earnings,  particularly  for  the  poor  and  ethnic  minorities,  as  they  can  sell  their  goods, \nhandicrafts, and services.  \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\nThe  total  project  cost,  including  physical  and  price  contingencies,  is  estimated  at \n38. \n$548 million  equivalent,  comprising  foreign  exchange  costs  of  $236.2 million (43%) and local \ncurrency costs of $311.8 million equivalent (57%) (Table 1). Details are in Appendix 7. The cost \nestimates are based on quantities derived from preliminary engineering designs and unit rates, \nreflecting  market  prices  for  goods  and  materials,  and  including  the  costs  of  land  acquisition, \ncompensation, resettlement, environmental mitigation measures, and environmental monitoring. \n \n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nItem \nA. \n\n Base Cost \n\n1.

The PRC will be the Borrower. The loan will finance the \nforeign  exchange  cost  of  civil  works,  railway  materials,  equipment,  safety  component, \ne-governance  and  MIS  component,  environmental  protection  measures,  and  consulting \nservices; and will cover 76% of the total foreign cost and 33% of the total project cost. The loan \nwill  have  a  25-year  term  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined in \naccordance  with  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment \ncharge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  conversion  options  that  may  be  exercised  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s loan regulations and conversion guidelines, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin the Loan and Project Agreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for \nits  decisions  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms \nand  conditions;  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  independently  made,  not \ninfluenced by any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\nThe  Government  had  also  requested  AFD  to  provide  \u20ac33.5 million  (about  $40 million \n40. \nequivalent)  to  finance  part  of  the  cost  of  civil  works.15 The proceeds from AFD\u2019s loan will be \napplied  to  three  civil  works  contracts  where  they  will  complement  ADB\u2019s  loan  proceeds  up  to \n100% of costs. The local currency cost of $311.8 million equivalent and foreign exchange cost \nof  $16.2 million  equivalent,  which  represent  the  interest  and  commitment  charges  during \nconstruction  on  the  ADB  and  AFD  loans,  will  be  financed  70%  by  MOR  and  30%  by  YPG.  A \nsummary of the financing plan is in Table 2 and the details are in Appendix 7. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nLocal \n\nForeign \nExchange \n180.0 \n40.0 \n11.3 \n4.9 \n236.2 \n\nCurrency  Total Cost \n\nSource \nADB \nAFD \nMOR \nYPG \n     Total \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  AFD  =  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement, \nMOR = Ministry of Railways, YPG = Yunnan provincial government. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n180.0 \n40.0 \n229.6 \n98.4 \n548.0 \n\n0.0 \n0.0 \n218.3 \n93.5 \n311.8 \n\n% \n33 \n7 \n42 \n18 \n100 \n\n \n41. \nThe  proceeds  of  ADB\u2019s  loan  will  be  made  available  to WYRC on the same terms and \nconditions  as  those  of  the  ADB  loan.  WYRC  will  bear  the  interest  rate  variation  and  foreign \nexchange  risks.  Assurance  was  obtained  from  the  Government  that  the  counterpart  funds \nrequired to implement the Project, including those to cover physical and price contingencies, will \nbe made available on time. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n42.  WYRC will be the  Executing Agency (EA) responsible  for overall implementation of the \nProject,  setting up  of  the  on-site construction management  units  along  the  project  route, and \nreporting to ADB. The Foreign Capital and Technical Import Center under MOR shall coordinate \nthe  project  management  activities,  supervise  the  procurement  of  the  goods  and  services \nfinanced under the project, and review the reports to be submitted to ADB. The business license \nof  WYRC  was  issued  on  16  August  2004  and  includes  the  construction,  operation,  and \nmanagement of the project railway. WYRC will manage and operate the Guangtong to Lijiang \nrailway after completion of construction. WYRC  has  the  capacity  to  carry  out  sound  and  safe \nconstruction  of  the  proposed  railway,  as  well  as  operate  and  manage  its  financial  resources \nefficiently.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPeriod of Implementation \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  about  5  years  starting  from  January  2005  to \n43. \nDecember  2009.  Land  acquisition  will  start  in  January  2005.  The  civil  works  under  ADB \nfinancing will start in June 2005 and will take about 3.5 years to complete. Trial operations will \n\n                                                 \n15  According to the tentative terms and conditions, the AFD loan would be based on 6-month euro interbank offered \nrate  (Euribor)  with  a  negative  spread  of  100  basis  points  and  a  17-year  maturity,  including  a  grace  period  of \n5 years. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nstart  in  January  2009  and  will  take  1  year  before  commercial  operations  begin.  The \nimplementation schedule is given in Appendix 8.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nAll  ADB  and  ADB-AFD  financed  procurement  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \n44. \nProcurement. The civil works are divided into 12 packages. ADB will finance eight packages, to \nbe  procured  under  international  competitive  bidding  procedures,  and  four  packages  will  be \n100%  financed  by  the  Government.  Three  of  the  eight  ADB-financed  packages  will  be \ncofinanced  by  AFD  (joint  cofinancing).  Equipment  will  be  procured  under  international \ncompetitive  bidding  (ICB)  or  international  shopping  (IS)  (Appendix 9).  Contracts  valued  in \nexcess of $500,000 for goods and $5 million for civil works will be procured through ICB. Any \nsupply  contracts  not  exceeding  $500,000  will  be  procured  through  IS.  Tendering  companies, \nselected by  the  EA  on  a  competitive  basis,  will  handle  the  international  bidding.  Prequalified \ncontractors  with  adequate  technical  and  financial  capacities  will  be  allowed  to  bid  for  several \npackages and, if successful, may be awarded more than one contract based on the least-cost \ncombination of contracts. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy will be included in \nall documents and contracts during bidding for, and implementation, of the Project. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nA  total  of  5,472  person-months  of  qualified  domestic  consultants  will  be  engaged  and \n45. \nfinanced  by  the  Government  for  (i) detailed  project  design;  (ii) international  procurement; \n(iii) construction  supervision;  (iv) construction  quality  assurance;  (v) environmental supervision \nand management; (vi) monitoring and evaluation of the resettlement plan; (vii) advising on and \nmonitoring  the  EMDP;  and  (viii) socioeconomic  impact  assessment,  evaluation  of  poverty \nreduction, and project performance monitoring. \n \n46. \nThe  ADB  loan  will  be  used  to  finance  12  person-months  of  international  consulting \nservices  for  (i) strengthening  marketing  and  business  development  functions  of  WYRC,  and \n(ii) researching  and  strengthening  the  development,  operation,  and  management  of  the  joint-\nventure railway systems in the PRC. The terms of reference for the international consultants, who \nwill  be  recruited  as  a  firm  using  quality-  and  cost-based  selection,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  are  given  in  Appendix 10.  The  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nanticorruption  policy  will  be  included  in  all  invitation  documents  and  contracts  for  international \nconsultants.  \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Action \n\n47. \nADB  approved  advance  procurement  action  for  civil  works  on  15  June  2004  up  to  the \nevaluation of bids, which covers the prequalification of contractors, bidding, and bid evaluation \nfor  the  civil  works  contract  packages,  but  does  not  include  award  of  contracts. The advance \naction  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  The \nGovernment  has  been  advised  that  approval  of  the  advance  action  does  not  commit  ADB  to \nfinancing the Project.16  \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n48. \nAll disbursements under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook.  Since  most  of  the  payments  will  be  made  for  large  contracts  well \nabove $100,000, direct payment and commitment procedures will be used to withdraw the loan \n                                                 \n16  The advance action was reported in the August 2004 issue of the Internet edition of ADB Business Opportunities. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13 \n\nfunds.  The  statement  of  expenditure  procedure  will  be  used  for  reimbursement  of  eligible \nexpenditures for any individual payment not exceeding $100,000. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n49.  WYRC  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  Project  and  have  such  accounts  and \nrelated financial statements audited annually by an independent auditor and in accordance with \nauditing standards acceptable to ADB. WYRC will submit to ADB within 9 months after the end \nof  each  fiscal  year  certified  copies  of  such  audited  project  accounts  and  financial  statements \nand  auditor's  reports,  all  in  English.  The  audit  of  such  financial  statements  will  also  include: \n(i) an  assessment  of  the  adequacy  of  accounting  and  internal  control  systems  with  respect to \nproject expenditures and other financial transactions; (ii) an assessment of compliance with loan \ncovenants  and  ADB's  requirements  on  project  management;  and  (iii) an opinion on the use of \nthe  statement  of  expenditure  procedure.  WYRC  will  also  submit  its  consolidated  financial \nstatements  covering  income  statements,  balance  sheets,  and  cash-flow  statements  to  ADB \nwithin  9  months  after  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year.  To  ensure  that  an  effective  internal  control \nsystem and a checks and balances mechanism are put in place, WYRC will establish an internal \naudit  unit  within  the  company.  The  unit  will  independently  test  financial  transactions  to  ensure \nthe  safe  custody  of  the  project-financed  assets  and  will  report  directly  to  WYRC's  board  of \ndirectors  and  external  auditors.  WYRC will make  satisfactory  arrangements  for  reporting  the \nprogress of project implementation by submitting quarterly progress reports. Within 3 months of \ncompletion, the EA will submit a project completion report to ADB. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation, and Project Review \n\nA  set  of  indicators  for  evaluating  project  performance  in  relation  to  the  Project\u2019s  goals, \n50. \npurposes,  outputs,  and  conditions  was  agreed  with  MOR  and  WYRC.  The  indicators  will  be \nreviewed at the  start  of  project  implementation  and  will  include  (i) economic development and \nsocioeconomic  indicators  for  the  DLR,  (ii) transport  costs  and  times  for  passenger  and  freight \nservices,  (iii) transport services  offered  and  transport  charges,  (iv) accident  rates,  (v) financial \nsustainability,  (vi) county/village  incomes,  (vii) access  to  social  services,  and  (viii) jobs created \nin construction and maintenance (Appendix 11). At the beginning of project implementation, the \nDLR will establish baseline and target values for the indicators. The indicators will be measured \nat  project inception,  completion,  and  3  years  later,  and  compared  with  the  baseline.  Where \nrelevant,  indicators  will  be  disaggregated  by  gender.  MOR/WYRC  will  recruit  qualified \nconsultants  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  to  help  establish  the  monitoring  and  evaluation \nsystem, and train staff of WYRC in its use. The main sources of data include (i) secondary data \nfrom  government  sources,  (ii) household  socioeconomic  sample  survey,  and  (iii) participatory \nrapid  appraisal.  A  report  summarizing  the  key  findings  of  monitoring  at  inception,  completion, \nand 3 years later will be submitted to ADB. \n \nIn 2007, ADB, MOR, and WYRC will carry out a midterm review of the Project, covering \n51. \nall institutional, administrative, organizational, technical, environmental, social, poverty reduction, \nresettlement,  economic,  financial,  and  other  relevant  aspects  that  may  have  an  impact  on  the \nperformance of the Project and its continuing viability.  \n \n\n9. \n\nAnticorruption Measures \n\n52. \nDuring project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to central and local \ngovernment  officials.  ADB  drew  attention  to  the  section,  highlighting  the  section  on  fraud  and \ncorruption that was added to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants, particularly the need for bidders, suppliers, contractors, and consultants to observe \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nthe  highest  standards  of  ethics  in  the  procurement  and  execution  of  ADB-financed contracts, \nand the sanctions if fraud and corruption are discovered. Based on MOR\u2019s experience in fighting \ncorruption,  the  following  actions  will  be  taken  to  prevent  corruption:  (i) a  leading  group  of \nofficials from the discipline unit and supervision department of MOR will be resident in project \noffices  for  bidding,  construction,  and  operations;  (ii) a  supervisory  \"watchdog\"  body  has  been \nestablished  to  prevent  interference  in  the  processes;  and  (iii) briefings  between  MOR  and  the \nprosecutor's office are held on a regular basis where warnings about or information on corrupt \npractices can be discussed.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n53. \nSince the Project is located in an area that is predominantly inhabited with poor people, \nmost  of  whom  are  ethnic  minorities,  the  Government  requested  ADB  to  provide  a  small-scale \ntechnical assistance (TA) to enhance the project benefits to the poor, and ethnic minorities, and \nassist in the preservation of local culture. The small-scale TA will have three components and \nassist  the  local  governments  in  (i) capacity  building  and  skill  enhancement  programs  for  the \npoor,  vulnerable  groups,  and  ethnic  minorities,  particularly  with  regard  to  income  generation, \nsustainability,  cultural  tourism  and  eco-tourism;  (ii) undertaking  feasibility  studies  for  cultural \nprotection and preservation; and (iii) assessing measures taken or planned for the preservation \nof  local  cultures,  and  recommendation  of  further  measures,  if  any,  required  prior  to  the \ncompletion of the Project. International and domestic consultants providing a total of 16 person-\nmonths  with  skills  in  social  development,  design  of  vocational  training  programs,  community-\nbased  tourism,  cultural  tourism,  and  cultural  preservation  will  be  hired.  The  $150,000  small-\nscale TA will be financed on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The outline of the \nsmall-scale TA is in Appendix 12. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nTraffic Forecast \n\n54. \nThe  traffic  forecast  was  made  by  considering  expected  economic  growth,  population \nincrease, tourism development potential, local government development plans, market surveys, \nand the assessment of TA consultants and the ADB mission. The freight volume on the DLR is \nforecast to increase from about 640 million ton-km in 2010 to 1,457 million ton-km in 2025. The \nannual growth rate will range between 4.5% and 6.4%. Passenger traffic was forecast based on \nsimilar  factors, including an assessment of  tourism  development  potential.17 It  was forecast to \ngrow  from  448 million  passenger-km  in  2010  to  1,234 million  passenger-km  in  2025  with \naverage growth rate ranging between 6.5% and 7.3%. These estimates take into consideration \nthe lessons learned from previous railway projects and are consistent with the growth achieved \non the Guangda railway.  The projected volumes can be accommodated on the  DLR and justify \nconstruction of the Project. Details are given in Appendix 13. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n55. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated by comparing the with- and \nwithout-project situations. DLR will reduce the cost of transport to and from the poor, landlocked \npart of northwestern Yunnan  province.  The economic costs of the  Project reflect the costs for \nconstruction, operation and maintenance, and the value of agricultural production from land lost \npermanently. The economic benefits include  (i) operating cost savings in freight and passenger \ntraffic,  (ii) time  saving  in  diverted  passenger  traffic  from  buses,  (iii) the  net  economic  value \n                                                 \n17  Lijiang is officially designated as a United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization world heritage \n\nsite. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15 \n\nadded  of  generated  commodity  production,  (v) generated  passenger  benefits,  and  (vi) tourism \nbenefits.  The  EIRR  for  the  Project  is  17%,  indicating  that  the  Project  is  economically  viable \n(Appendix 13). Results of sensitivity analysis confirm the robustness of the Project's economic \nviability. Changes in the key variables, such as a 20% reduction in  benefits, do not significantly \nimpact economic viability. The capital cost would have to increase by 54% over the estimate for \nthe EIRR to fall below the cutoff rate of 12%. The benefit level would have to decrease by 29% \nto achieve the same effect. In light of previous experience in the PRC  railway sector, variations \nof  such  magnitude  are  unlikely.  Project  risks  were  quantified  using  the  \u201cMonte  Carlo\u201d  method, \ni.e.,  considering  the  possible  value  for  key  variables  and  the  probability with which they may \noccur.  The  result  shows  that  the  EIRR  would  exceed  12%  with  95%  probability.  Distribution \nanalysis  of  the  Project  was  undertaken  by  determining  the  project  effects  for  various \nbeneficiaries,  which  shows  that  a  large  portion  of  the  net  benefits  will  accrue  to  the  local \neconomy. \n \nC. \n\nFinancial Benefits  \n\nFinancial  projections  have  been  prepared  for  WYRC  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \n56. \nGuidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by \nADB  to  assess  the  financial  viability  and  sustainability  of  the  railway  (Appendix 14).  The \nprojected  financial  statements  indicate  that  financial  revenues  will  be  sufficient  to  cover \noperation  and  maintenance  costs,  income  taxes,  and  debt  service,  and  provide  a reasonable \nrate of return. The financial evaluation was undertaken in real terms using constant 2004 prices. \nThe  project  cost  estimates  and  financial  projections  in  nominal  terms  were  converted  to  real \nterms  by  adjusting  for  the  projected  effects  of  foreign  and  domestic  inflation  and  currency \nfluctuation.  Incremental  costs  and  benefits  were  derived  under  with-  and  without-project \nscenarios. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR), computed on an after-tax basis, is 6.7%. \nThis compares favorably with the average weighted average cost of capital, also computed on \nan after-tax basis, of 4.5%. The Project is both financially viable and sustainable. Sensitivity and \nrisk  analysis  indicates  that  the  FIRR  for  the  Project  is  robust  under  most  conditions.  The \ndetailed evaluation is provided in Appendix 14. \n \nD. \n\nEnvironmental Impact and Assessment \n\nPotential  adverse  environmental \n\n57. \nThe Project is classified as environmental category A. The Second Survey and Design \nInstitute  Environmental  Engineering  Division  prepared  an  EIA  for  the  proposed project, which \nwas  approved  by  the  State  Environmental  Protection  Agency  on  26  October  2004.  The \nsummary EIA was endorsed by the MOR and circulated  to ADB\u2019s Board and uploaded on the \nADB web site on 15 July 2004.  \n \n58. \n(i) clearing  of  vegetation, \n(ii) management  of  excavated  rock  and  soil  wastes,  and  (iii) induced  impacts  related  to \nsecondary  tourism  and  industrial  development.  Institutional  arrangements  for  environmental \nmanagement, monitoring,  reporting,  and  oversight  are  summarized  in  the  summary  EIA.  The \nEIA  concluded  that  the  adverse  environmental  impacts  can  be  successfully  mitigated. \nImplementation  of  the  environmental  management,  mitigation,  and  monitoring  programs \nincluded in the EIA will ensure compliance with the environmental guidelines and procedures of \nADB  and  the  Government.  MOR/WYRC  agreed  that  the  anticipated  industrial  development \nwould be subject to a stringent environmental review and approval process, whereby a project \nnormally  approved  at  county  level  would  be  approved  at  city  level,  and  a  project  normally \napproved at provincial level would be approved at state level.  \n \n\nimpacts \n\ninclude: \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nA  qualitative  review  of  potential  induced  impacts  in  the  project  area  and  BOA  was \n59. \nundertaken.    The  EIA  included  an  evaluation  of  the  impacts  of  tourism,  urbanization,  and \nindustrial  development.  The  evaluation  noted  that  (i) the  ongoing  development  activities  are \nadequately  managed  with  respect  to  environmental  protection,  (ii) the  institutional  capacity for \nenvironmental  protection  is  adequate,  and  (iii) the ongoing environmental protection  programs \nare consistent with PRC and ADB requirements.  Based on the analysis, ADB agreed with the \nGovernment  that  (i) the  Project  will  be  designed,  constructed,  operated,  and  maintained  in \naccordance  with  the  environmental  laws  and  regulations  of  the  PRC  and  the  environmental \npolicy  of  ADB;  (ii) the  environmental  management  and  monitoring  program  (EMP)  and  the \nmitigation  measures  included  therein,  as  specified  in  the  EIA  prepared  for  the  Project,  are \nproperly implemented; (iii) any environmental permits, licenses, and clearances are obtained in \na  timely  manner;  (iv) any  adverse  impact  on  the  environment  that  may  arise  from  project \nimplementation  activities  is  promptly  mitigated  or  minimized  in  accordance  with  the  EMP;  and \n(v) the  implementation  of  the  EMP,  including  any  safety  breaches,  violation  of  environmental \nstandards,  and  the  necessary  corrective  measures  are  reported  regularly  to  ADB.  The \nevaluation  also  noted  that  there  is  substantial  external  assistance  for  environmental \nmanagement  efforts,  particularly  for  environmental  preservation,  in  northwestern  Yunnan.  An \nindependent monitoring agency will be hired to carry out the external monitoring and evaluation \nwork during project implementation. \n \nE. \n\nImpacts on Poverty  \n\n60. \nThe Project will benefit about 1.1 million people in the project area. Of them, about 75% \nare rural and 30% are poor with an average net income per capita of less than CNY900. A total \nof  372  key  poverty  reduction  villages  are  located  in  the  project  area,  of  which  27  villages  are \nlocated in the project railway corridor townships. The Project will also benefit the people living in \nthe BOA, where 91% of the population is rural and the poverty incidence is more than 60%. The \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 18. \n \n61. \nAbout 96,800 person-years of work will be created during the construction of the railway, \nwhich will provide direct employment opportunities to over 7,000 poor people. A majority will be \nethnic  minorities  and  priority  will  be  given  to  women  and  resettlement-affected  people.  In \naddition, during construction, 8,505 person-years of local jobs will be created  in the provision of \nconstruction material. When the operation of the new railway starts, approximately 300 people \nwill  be  employed,  creating  7,500  person-years  of  work  over  a  25-year time horizon, of which \nabout  2,000  person-years  would  be  available  to  poor  people.  The  Project  will  finance \nconstruc tion of 251 km of access roads, which will be handed over to the local governments at \nthe  end  of  construction.  The  access  roads  will  facilitate  the  spread  of  the  railway\u2019s  benefits  to \nthe rural economy. By lowering transport costs and travel time along the corridor, the Project will \nimprove the availability of daily necessities in local markets and villages, and access to markets \nfor local produce, and income-generating opportunities. The construction of 11 railway stations \nwill  create  permanent  and  support  jobs,  and  help  distribute  the  benefits  in  the  project  area. \nThere will be sufficient space in and around the stations for local area development and ethnic \nminorities  will  be  supported  to  set  up  shops,  sell  local  produce,  handicrafts,  and  local  goods. \nThis will increase income in local communities and help generate local revenue, which can be \nused  to  improve  social  services  and  local  infrastructure.  The  Project  will  provide  the  essential \ninfrastructure upon which the local authorities plan to build and improve a wide range of social \nand economic services such as public utilities, and health and education services.  \n \n62. \nThe Project will provide efficient and low-cost transportation for passengers and goods. \nBetter passenger transport will help manage the projected increase in tourists visiting the project \narea each year.  Dali and Lijiang  will  have  higher levels of  economic development  because of \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17 \n\nthe expansion of  tourism. The competitiveness of market access to locally produced goods will \nincrease,  thus  generating  economic  development  in  the  project  area.  The  Project  will  also \nfacilitate  the  development  of  local  industry  and  tourism,  which  will  help  generate  additional \nopportunities  in  the  future  for  the  vast  majority  of  local  people  who,  being  ethnic  minorities, \nprefer to remain in their native lands. The Project will improve their living standards without their \nhaving  to  migrate.  In  summary,  the  Project  will  contribute  to  achieving  the  goals  of  increasing \nincomes and reducing poverty. \n \nF. \n\nResettlement Impact   \n\n63. \nThe railway alignment will cross 56 villages in  13 townships from Dali  city to Lijiang city. \nThe  railway  lengths  in  Dali  prefecture  and Lijiang  city  are  138 km  and  28 km,  respectively. \nBased on the field survey of the first stage of  the preliminary design study, the total permanent \nacquisition  of  land  is  394  hectares.  About  70%  of  the  land  to  be  permanently  acquired  is \ncurrently under cultivation, affecting 4,159 people (assuming total loss of cultivated land on the \nbasis of average per capita landholdings). The houses of 3,150 rural people (680 households) \nwill be demolished. During construction, temporary land occupation  of about 107 ha will affect \nanother 250 people. The relocation of one school and a brick-kiln will require 594 square meters \nand  affect  an  additional  150  people.  In  total,  7,709  people  will  be  directly  affected.  Ethnic \nminorities  account  for  83% of the  affected  people,  including  Bai,  Lisu,  and  Naxi  villages.  The \nrailway  alignment  was  selected  to  minimize  resettlement  impacts,  where  possible.  Special \nmeasures  have  been  included  in  the  resettlement  plan  and  the  EMDP  to ensure compliance \nwith ADB's social safeguard policies. \n \n64. \nThe  budget  approved  by  the  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission  for  land \nacquisition and resettlement is CNY141 million ($17.1 million). The resettlement budget will be \nadjusted  based  on  the  actual  measurement  of  physical  losses.  MOR,  WYRC,  and  local \ngovernments  prepared  and  finalized  the  resettlement  plan  with  assistance  from  the  project \npreparatory technical assistance (PPTA) consultants and South West Jiaotong University based \non the preliminary design study, 20 village surveys, 218 household surveys, local government \nstatistics, and consultations with local officials, village leaders, and affected households. WYRC \nhas distributed resettlement information booklets in Chinese to all affected villages to inform the \naffected people of the compensation standards. The final resettlement plan in Chinese has been \ncirculated  at  the  prefecture,  county,  and  township  levels.  A  Summary  resettlement  plan  was \nuploaded on the ADB web site on 15 July 2004. MOR, YPG and WYRC will be responsible for \nimplementation  of  the  resettlement  plan.  The  Dali  prefecture  and  Lijiang  city  governments  will \nbe responsible for (i) provision of livelihood training, support for vulnerable groups, and meeting \nany  cost  overruns;  and  (ii) construction  of  access  roads  to  stations  and  ensuring  support \ninfrastructure  for  station  area  development.  An  independent  monitoring  agency  will  be \ncontracted  to  carry  out  the  external  monitoring  and  evaluation  work.  MOR,  WYRC,  and  ADB \nhave agreed on a set of supervision milestones, which are shown in the Summary Resettlement \nPlan (Appendix 15).  \n \nG. \n\nEthnic Minorities \n\n  In the project area, about 73% of the total population consists of ethnic minorities. Of \n65. \nthe total population, the largest ethnic group is the Bai (46.2%), followed by Han (26.7%), Naxi \n(18.3%),  Yi  (3.2%),  Lisu  (2.8%)  and  others  (2.8%)18.  The  project  will  have  potential  adverse \nimpacts in terms of resettlement, mainly on the Bai people (74.3%) and also some Han (16.8%), \n\n                                                 \n18  About 2,800 Tibetans reside in the project area (0.2% of population). They live in Lijiang city and Dali city, and are \n\nengaged in business in the tourist areas. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nNaxi (6.2%), Yi (1.5%), and Lisu (0.4%) people. Specific provisions to address land acquisition \nand resettlement impacts are included in the resettlement plan. To assess the potential induced \nimpacts,  people  and  NGOs  within  the  seven  BOA  counties  have  also  been  interviewed  and \nconsulted. These seven counties have many ethnic groups, including Tibetans19 in Xianggelila \ncounty (Zhongdian), Yi and Miao in Lijiang prefecture, and Pumi and Mosuo in Ninglang county. \nThe results of these studies showed strong support for the railway and economic development \nin  general.  The  local  people  believe  that  the  DLR  is  an  important  project  that  will  benefit  the \narea.  The  evaluation  also  noted  that  there  is  substantial  external  assistance  for  poverty \nreduction,  and  social  development  in  northwestern  Yunnan,  and  saw  the  Project  as  a  key \ndevelopment  investment,  the  positive  social  impacts  of  which  are  expected  to  substantially \noutweigh the negative ones. \n \nGiven  the  large  number  of  ethnic  minorities  in  the  project  area  and  BOA,  the  social \n66. \nanalysis focused on ethnic minorities, and a stand-alone EMDP was prepared for the Project. A \ndraft  EMDP  was  prepared  by  the  PPTA  consultants  after  extensive  consultations  with  various \nstakeholders  including  all  minority  groups  in  the  project  area.  In  addition  to  the  PPTA \nconsultants, three consultants including two Tibetans were hired to look at possible impacts in \nthe  BOA.  Consultations  included  household  interviews,  village  group  meetings,  meeting  with \nNGOs,  monks,  local  ethnic  bureaus,  village  leaders,  and  other  stakeholders.  Participatory \nworkshops  were  organized  to  disseminate  the  findings  of  the  EMDP.  The  draft  EMDP  was \ndistributed  in  Chinese  to  local  people  and  refined  based  on  further  consultations,  including  a \npublic consultation workshop in Dali on 20 August 2004. The finalized EMDP was endorsed by \nMOR, WYRC, and YPG. \n   \n67.  WYRC will have overall responsibility for the EMDP and will carry out implementation in \ncoordination  with  MOR  and  YPG.  The  cost  of  implementing  the  EMDP  will  be  covered  by  the \nproject  budget,  by  existing  local  government  programs,  and  the  small-scale  TA.  The  EMDP \nincludes  a  participatory  strategy,  and  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  plan.  The  construction \nmanagement  units  established  by  WYRC  will  be  responsible  for  overall  supervision  and \nmonitoring  of  the  implementation  of  the  EMDP.  An  independent  local  institute  will  act  as  the \nexternal monitor. A summary EMDP is included in Appendix 17. The EMDP is available in the \nlocal language (Chinese) at the prefecture, county, and township levels.  \n \nH. \n\nSocial and Gender Aspects   \n\n68. \nVulnerable  groups  in  the  project  area  include  orphans,  widows,  and  the  seriously \ndisabled  and  mentally  ill.  The  Project  will  generate  job  opportunities  for  the  poor,  ethnic \nminorities,  women,  and  other  vulnerable  groups,  and  will  help  develop  their  job  skills.  Station \narea  development,  including  station  access  roads,  will help  address  the  needs of  the  poor, \nincluding  ethnic  minorities,  women,  and  other  vulnerable  groups.  Sufficient  areas  will  be \ndesignated for the establishment of shops for the affected villages. Construction and operation-\nrelated  jobs  will  provide  potential  new  sources  of  income  for  local  people.  Women  and  other \nvulnerable  groups  will  benefit  from  project-generated  employment,  afforestation  activities,  and \nexpansion  of  secondary  and  tertiary  industries,  especially  tourism.  An  increase  in  female \nparticipation in the labor and tourism market has the potential of increasing women\u2019s net income \nand savings potential, improving overall family welfare, and improving the status of women.  \n \n69. \nAlthough, the proposed DLR is not in a high HIV/AIDS epidemic area, the construction of \nthe DLR and the operation of the railway may  have an impact on the transmission of HIV/AIDS \n\n                                                 \n19  There are 141,000 Tibetans residing in Yunnan province, of whom 115,000 are in Diqing prefecture; most of this \n\narea is included in the BOA of the proposed railway project. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19 \n\nand sexually transmitted infections (STIs) due to a large number of workers during construction, \nexpansion of the tourism industry, and lack of adequate knowledge about HIV/AIDS. However, \nthe  poverty  and  social  assessment  noted  that  MOR  and  Guangda  Railway  Corporation  have \nexperience  from  implementing  various  awareness  and  prevention  programs  during  the \nconstruction of the Guangda railway. Medical clinics were established in the area of construction \ncamps, which have subsequently become hospitals. A unit within Guangda Railway Corporation \norganized  HIV/AIDS  awareness  campaigns  and  preventive  measures  for  workers  and \ncommunities during railway construction. These activities will be continued by WYRC during the \nconstruction  and  operation  of  DLR.  The  unit  will  coordinate  with  contractors,  the  local \ndepartments  of  health,  and  other  relevant  line  agencies  (e.g.,  All-China Women\u2019s Federation \nand  ethnic  affairs  bureau)  in  delivering  appropriate  HIV/AIDS  awareness  and  prevention \ninformation  to  construction  workers,  ethnic  minorities,  and  women.  When  combined  with \nincreased  awareness  efforts  by  local  governments  and  the  Ministry  of  Health,  such  measures \nwill minimize potential risks of STI/HIV/AIDS transmission along the railway corridor. \n \nI. \n\nRisks \n\ntests \n\nindicated \n\nrailway  projects.  Sensitivity \n\n70. \nThe Project has been formulated to minimize potential risks. Based on experience with \nprevious railway projects, traffic demand was conservatively estimated. The forecast for freight \ntraffic  was  adjusted  for  the  initial  years  of  operation  based  on  generally  slower  growth \nthat  economic \nexperienced  on  previous \ncircumstances  would  have  to  become  substantially  adverse  for  the  Project  to  lose  economic \nviability. A potential risk is delay in implementation, which would delay the realization of benefits. \nMOR and WYRC have successfully built railway lines over difficult terrain, such as the Nanning-\nKunming  railway,  and  the  Guangtong-Dali  railway.  The  support  that  the  Project  has  from  the \nGovernment,  MOR,  and  YPG;  the  thorough  preparation  of  the  Project;  and  the  approval  of \nadvance  procurement  action,  all  contribute  to  reducing  the  potential  risk  of  delays  in \nimplementation.  The  environmental  risks  will  be  mitigated  by  the  measures  agreed  to  in  the \nenvironmental management plan and will be closely monitored during project implementation. \n \n71. \nResettlement  will  affect  about  8,000  people.  The  railway  alignment has been routed to \ncause  minimal  resettlement.  The  resettlement  plan  includes  preferential  treatment  for \nemployment during construction, supply of local materials, allocation of commercial space near \nrailway stations, and job training. There is a potential risk that the economic development may \nhave  some  indirect,  adverse  impacts  for  some  ethnic  minorities.  To  mitigate  this,  special \nmeasures  have  been  included  in  the  EMDP.  Both  the  resettlement  plan  and  EMDP  will  be \nclosely monitored to ensure compliance with ADB's social safeguard policies. \n \n72. \nIntermodal competition  among railways and roads will create market risks to the project \nrailway. However, the existing road is already congested and the capacity constraint is expected \nto worsen, as there are no current plans to improve the road. Surveys of freight operators and \npassengers indicated that the railway has several advantages over other transport modes: lower \nfares, shorter travel times, safety, and punctuality. The increasing commercial orientation of the \njoint-venture railway will help lower the risks posed by intermodal competition. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  WYRC  have  given  the \n\n73. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\nCofinancing. If the Borrower does not obtain the AFD loan, the Borrower will, by \nthe  date  of  the  first  disbursement  of  the  ADB  loan,  make  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB to commit the provision of the funds intended to be provided \nby  AFD  and  ensure \nthe  project \nimplementation.  \n\nfunds  are  available \n\nthroughout \n\nthat \n\nReform  measures.  The Government will take necessary measures to continue \nto implement its 2004 railway development plan including (a) separating the core \nrailway operations from noncore transportation business operations in three large \nspecialized  railway  companies,  (b) rationalizing  staff,  and  (c) ensuring  that \nWYRC will outsource some of the activities such as construction works, track and \nand power cable maintenance, and industrial sidings. \n\nConstruction  quality.

Despite  the  Government's  efforts  to  increase  the  country's  transport \n1. \ncapacity,  serious  constraints  and  bottlenecks  remain,  especially  in  the  road  and  railway \nsubsectors.  By  the  end  of  2002,  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  transport  system \ncomprised about 72,000 kilometers (km) of railways, 1.69 million km of highways, 121,500 km of \ninland  waterways,  and  1.55 million km  of  civil  aviation  routes.  However,  the  density  of  the \ntransport network ranks among the lowest in the world relative to either population or geographic \narea.  From  1978,  when  economic  reforms  were  first  introduced,  through  to  2003,  the  PRC \nexperienced sustained rapid economic growth. This resulted in an accordingly rapid increase in \ndemand  for  transportation.  The  annual  growth  of  passenger  transport  was  9.2%  and  freight \ntransport grew at 7.1% during the 1978\u20132003 period. In 2003, road traffic accounted for 55.79% \nof total passenger-km, followed by railways with 34.7%, civil aviation with 9.1%, and coastal and \ninland waterways with 0.5%. The modal split for freight ton-km was 53.3% for coastal and inland \nwaterways, 32% for railways, 13.2% for roads, 1.4% for pipelines, and 0.1% for civil aviation.  \n \n2. \nRecent  Developments. To improve transport inefficiencies and eliminate the transport \nbottlenecks  that  constrain  efficient  economic  development,  the  Government  increased \ninvestment  in  transport  infrastructure  in  the  Ninth  Five-Year  Plan  (1996\u20132000).  Investment in \ntransport infrastructure as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) more than doubled in the last \ndecade. A World Bank study1 indicates that total transport investment should be increased to at \nleast 3.8% of GDP to avoid the economic costs associated with transport constraints. To meet the \nincrease in transport demand, more infrastructure investments are needed. The Government has \ncontinued to accord high priority to transport in the 10th Five-Year Plan (2001\u20132005). Substantial \ninvestments  in  the  road  and  railway  subsectors  from  both  domestic  and  international  financing \nsources, including the private sector, are envisaged. \n \n3. \nFuture  Development  Priorities  and  Outlook.  The  10th  Five-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005) \nidentifies  transportation,  including  railway  development,  as  a  priority.  The  Plan  envisages \n(i) constructing  6,000 km  of  new  lines  to  provide  access  to  unserved  areas  with  the  network \nlength  reaching  a  total  of  75,000  route-km,  (ii) providing  3,000 km  of  double  lines  and \nelectrifying  5,000 km of key lines to increase capacity, and (iii) increasing operating speeds on \n5,000 km  with  the  total  length  of  such  lines  reaching  15,000 km.  A  total  investment  of \nCNY350 billion,  including  CNY270 billion  on  capital  construction  and  CNY80 billion  for  rolling \nstock,  is  planned  for  the  railway  sector.  During  2003\u20132007,  the  investments  for  capital \nconstruction are expected to reach CNY450 billion.  \n \n4. \nIn 2004, the State Council approved the new railway development plan (up to 2020). The \nplan  seeks  to  expand  the  railway  network  from  72,000 km  to  85,000 km  by  2010,  and  to \n100,000 km by 2020. Increasing train speed is a major goal. Train speed will be raised to over \n200 km  per  hour  on  the  trunk  network  by  2020.  Priority  will  be  given  to  the  development  of \nrailways in unserved areas and regions that lack transport and have remained less developed. \nThe route network length will reach 16,000 km in the western region of the PRC by 2020. The \nplan also calls for separating passenger and freight traffic in heavily trafficked corridors. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  World  Bank.  1998.

Report  No.  1595-CHA \n\nTransport Sector Unit, East Asia and Pacific Regional Office, Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nAsian Development Bank Experience \n\nOther  Development  Partner  Operations. In the railway subsector, the Japan Bank for \n5. \nInternational Cooperation (JBIC) and the World Bank, in addition to the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB), have been mainly involved in expanding the capacity of the national railways. In the past \n20 years, JBIC has provided  \u00a5578 billion for 15 railway projects to expand rail transport capacity, \nparticularly  in  major  coal  transport  corridors.  JBIC  has  also  financed  the  development  of  new \nsections  of  the  national  railway  network  in  inland  provinces.  Since  1984,  the  World  Bank  has \nprovided  10  loans  totaling  $2.4 billion  for  nine  national  railway  projects  and  one  local  railway \nproject. \n \nB. \n \n6. \nADB\u2019s  Assistance  in  the  Sector.  In  the  railway  subsector,  ADB  has  focused  on \nimproving  infrastructure  in  less-developed  and  poor  regions  to  promote  sustainable  economic \ngrowth and reduce poverty. Since 1989, ADB has provided 11 loans totaling about $2.1 billion to \nhelp  finance  the  construction  of  1,754 km  of  new  railway  lines  under  seven  local  railway \nprojects, and 4,138 km of new railway lines under four national railway projects. These projects \nhave  introduced  modern  technology  and  improved  the  efficiency  of  railway  operation  through \ninstitutional  and  structural  reforms.  ADB  has  also  provided  10  TAs  totaling  $4.6 million,  to \npromote  the  commercial  operation  of  railways,  establish  corporate  governance,  achieve  cost \nrecovery, and improve the management of railways.  \n \n7. \nEvaluation of ADB Assistance. Experience from completed and ongoing ADB-financed \nrailway projects in the PRC shows strong commitment and generally satisfactory capabilities of \nthe  executing  agencies  (EAs)  for  project  implementation.  The  speed  of  implementation  has \noften exceeded the expectations at the time of appraisal. The EAs generally complied with the \nloan  covenants.  Resettlement  and  environmental  management  were  carried  out  satisfactorily. \nAudited  financial  statements  were  submitted  in  a  timely  manner,  and  the  audited  financial \nstatements were found generally acceptable. Of ADB\u2019s 11 railway projects, 5 are complete, 3 \nare  under  trial  operation,  and  6  are  under  implementation.  The  key  lessons  from  the previous \nrailway  projects  highlight  the  need  to  (i) ensure that the EA established for project processing \nand  implementation  is  also  responsible  for  the  project\u2019s  operation;  (ii) prepare  realistic  traffic \nforecasts; (iii) review constraints to traffic on a network basis, and the impact on project viability \nof the existing and/or planned railway lines and other transportation modes that may compete \nwith  the  project  facilities;  and  (iv) finance  railway  projects  with  appropriately  determined  debt-\nequity  ratios.  The  railway  projects  have  contributed  to  a  dramatic  transformation  of  local \neconomies.  The  per  capita  rural  incomes  in  the  project  areas  increased  substantially  from  the \nlevels  before  the  project.  Living  standards  were  raised  and  poverty  was  reduced. The project \nperformance audit report2 for the ADB-financed Jing-Jiu railway project in the PRC concluded that \nthe project was successful and exceeded its original passenger traffic forecasts. \n \nC. \n \n8. \nStrategy  and  Priorities.  ADB\u2019s  strategy  for  the  railway  subsector  has  three  broad \nobjectives:  (i) improve  economic  efficiency,  (ii) promote  growth  in  poor  inland  provinces  to \nreduce  poverty,  and  (iii) protect  the  environment  and  manage  natural  resources.  In  pursuit  of \nthese  three  objectives,  the  strategy  supports  developing  efficient  and  integrated  transport \nnetworks to meet the needs of a growing market economy and to contribute to reducing poverty \nthrough  investment  targeting  poorer  areas  coupled  with  policy  and  institutional  reforms. \nBecause of  the  importance  of  railway  transport  in  the  development  of  the  national  economy, \n\nADB Subsector Strategy \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2002. Jing-Ju Railway Technical Enhancement Project. Manila. December 2002.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n29 \n\nADB\u2019s strategy for the railway sector focuses on (i) expanding the railway system by constructing \nnew lines in unserved areas that are less-developed and poor, (ii) modernizing and increasing \nthe  capacity  to  improve  transport  efficiency  on  key  routes  of  the  national  railway  system, \n(iii) commercializing railway operations to sustain efficient operations, and (iv) increasing railway \ncompetitiveness in the transport sector through restructuring and reform.  \n \n9. \nPoverty  Reduction.  ADB  focuses  on  four  issues  to  enhance  the  poverty  reduction \nimpacts  of  transport  investments:  (i) locating  ADB-financed  projects  in  the  less-developed and \npoor  regions  where  new  lines  will  stimulate  economic  development,  (ii) encouraging  the \nmaximization  of  employment  of  poor  people  during  project  construction  and  operations, \n(iii) supplying  local  materials  that  meet  the  requirements  of  quality  and  economy  from  poor \nvillages, and (iv) providing station access roads and link roads to widen the project\u2019s benefits to \npoor interior areas. \n \n10. \nGovernance and  Policy  Reform  Agenda.  ADB\u2019s  policy  reform  agenda  in  the  railway \nsector  is  contributing  to  restructuring  the  Ministry  of  Railways  (MOR),  commercializing \noperations,  supporting  management  autonomy  of  railway  operations,  developing  human \nresources, and improving financial management and accounting systems. \n \n11. \nPromoting Private Sector Development. The PRC\u2019s large infrastructure needs require \nlocal  governments  to  shift  from  traditional  financing  modes  toward  the  capital  markets.  In  the \nrailway sector, a wider role for the private sector is envisaged. MOR has taken steps to create \nthe  conditions  necessary  to  attract  investments  in  the  project  facilities  and  services  from \nnongovernment  and  private  sector  sources.  Possible  areas  include  construction  of  industrial \nsidings, tourism, containerization, and parcel-related businesses. \n \n12. \nRegional  Cooperation.  The  PRC  is  an  active  participant  in  three  regional  cooperation \ninitiatives:  (i) through  Yunnan  province  for  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS),  (ii) through \nthe  Xinjiang  Autonomous  Region  for  the  Central  Asian  republics  (CARs)  initiative,  and \n(iii) through  Inner  Mongolia  with  Mongolia.  Improving  the  cross-border  trade  regimes  is  a \ncommon feature of these initiatives. Since these programs involve the poorer areas of the PRC, \nexpanding regional markets and options could help reduce poverty. An agreement for facilitating \nthe cross-border movement of goods and people has been developed under the GMS initiative. \nSteps are being taken to develop  an  institutional  framework  to  facilitate  the  implementation  of \nregional transport projects, e.g., the Uzbekistan-Kyrgyz Republic-PRC railway development and \nthe Pan-Asian railway project (Singapore-Kunming Railway Link project). \n \nE. \n \n13.  Monitoring Targets,  Indicators, Modality, and  Processes.  The sector performance is \nmonitored and evaluated annually by the Government and reviewed through the process of the \ncountry  strategy  and  program.  A  set  of  indicators  for  evaluating  sector  performance  includes \n(i) economic development and poverty indicators for the western region, (ii) transport density in \nrelation to land area and population, (iii) public and private investment in railways, (iv) transport \ndemand  for  freight  and  passengers  with  modal  split  data,  (v) level  of  user  charges  (railway \nconstruction  surcharges,  etc.),  and  (vi) cross-border  traffic  volumes  with  the  CARs,  GMS,  and \nMongolia. \n \n\nPerformance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \nItem \n\nService of the poor areas \nIncreasing capacity in key routes \n \n\nA.

The objective of the Project is to \npromote  sustainable  economic  growth  by  enhancing  transportation  capability  in  a  less \naccessible  and  mountainous  region,  thereby  creating  employment  and  income-enhancing \nopportunities,  raising  incomes,  and  reducing  poverty.  To  achieve  this  objective,  economic \ndevelopments, such as tourism, as well as value-added and labor-intensive industries, need to \nbe  facilitated  in  the  project  area.  The  construction  of  the  DLR  will  create  the  conditions  for  a \nsignificant  number  of  tourist  and  business  companies  to  invest  in  the  area.  From  the  financial \nperspective of the DLR, tourism and industry on the route of the DLR will generate the greater \nproportion  of  the  traffic.  To  capture  the  potential  for  economic  development  and  traffic  in  the \nregion and foster railway-local industry cooperation, institutional strengthening in railway market \ndevelopment  will  be  necessary.  The  purpose  of  the  consulting  services  will  be  to  assist  the \nrailway in defining what the service should be, plan its future operations, and assist in creating \nappropriate customer-oriented services for the DLR.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nFor the first component, the consultants will (i) determine the level of tourism, industry, \nand  market  development  expertise  in  the  WYRC;  (ii) determine  the  programs  and  incentives \navailable  for  attracting  industry  at  the  county,  prefecture,  and  province  levels;  (iii) meet with a \nselection of potential shippers located or planning to locate along the route of the DLR; (iv) meet \nwith business people of Kunming, Lijiang, and Dali to determine current operations and future \ninland  transport  requirements  including  for  export  to  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS); \n(v) develop plans for improving railway services, for passengers (particularly tourists) and freight \n(including  container  services);  (vi) propose  measures  to  develop  industrial  sidings;  and \n(vii) improve marketing of railway services to industries, specifically for the DLR and WYRC. \n \n3. \nFor  the  second  component,  the  consultants  will  (i) review  the  performance  of  existing \njoint-venture railways in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), (ii) identify the areas that need \nto be strengthened, (iii) recommend actions and changes including institutional efforts to make \nthese joint-venture railways more market oriented and competitive, (iv) strengthen marketing and \nbusiness development functions of WYRC, and (v)  research and strengthen the development, \noperation, and management of the joint-venture railway systems in the PRC.  The  international \nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with the Asian Development Bank (ADB)  Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants.  \n \nC. \n \n4. \nAbout  12  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  will  be  engaged  under \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection,  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants.  The  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  will  be  included  in  all  invitation \ndocuments  and  contracts  for  international  consultants.

Since \nthe Project is located in an area that is predominantly inhabited by ethnic minorities, an ethnic \nminorities  development  plan  (EMDP)  has  been  prepared  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  social \nsafeguard  policies  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  West  Yunnan  Railway \nCompany)  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  enhance  the  project \nbenefits  to  the  poor,  most  of  whom  are  ethnic  minorities,  and  assist  in  developing  feasibility \nstudies  for  the  preservation  of  local  culture.  The  TA  will  assist  the  local  governments  in  the \nproject  area  in  providing  capacity  building  and  training  to  the  local  people,  help  in  the  design \nand  implementation  of  cultural  preservation  measures,  and  make  a  midterm  assessment  of \ncultural preservation. \n \nB. \n \nThe  scope  of  the  consulting  services  has  three  components:  (i) capacity building and \n2. \nskill enhancement programs for the poor, vulnerable groups, and ethnic minorities, particularly \nwith regard to income generation, sustainability, community-based tourism, and cultural tourism; \n(ii) feasibility  studies  for  cultural  protection  and  preservation;  and  (iii) an  assessment  of  the \nmeasures  taken  or  planned  for  the  preservation  of  local  cultures,  and  recommending  further \nmeasures, if any, that are required to be taken prior to the completion of the Project.  \n \n3. \nThe  capacity  building  and  skill  enhancement  component  would  focus  on  (i) identifying \nthe  tourism  training  needs,  particularly  for  community-based tourism and for cultural tourism; \n(ii) identify  people  who  can  be  trained,  particularly  among  ethnic  minorities  and  the  vulnerable \nsector; (iii) formulate training plans, including identification of trainers; and (iv) commence a pilot \ntraining  program.  The  key  objective  of  this  component  will  be  to  enhance  the  skills  of  local \npeople so that they can maximize the employment opportunities generated by the completion of \nthe Project. \n \n4. \nThere  will  be  two  feasibility  studies  and  they  will  be  focusing  on  the  preservation  or \nrestoration  of  ancient  cultures.  For  the  first  feasibility  study  the  consultants  will  conduct  (i) a \nstudy on the protection of successor folk culture, and (ii) a study on the rescue and classification \nof  ancient  works.  The  objective  of  this  feasibility  study  would  be  to  assess  opportunities  to \nsupport  artists  within  the  project  area,  focusing  primarily  on  the  Bai  and  Naxi  people  (Dongba \nculture). The second feasibility study would focus on the identification, classification, translation, \nand  restoration/preservation  of  ancient  books,  oral  records,  and  inscriptions.  The  rescue  work \nfor  Dali  and  Lijiang  ancient  works  requires  more  inputs.  The  two  studies  will  recommend  an \naction plan for implementation by the local governments.  \n \n5. \nDuring the midterm review of the Project, an assessment will be made of the measures \ntaken  or  planned  for  the  preservation  of  local  cultures,  and  whether  such  measures  are \nadequate  to  achieve  results  given  the  pressures  from  economic  development.  Based  on  this \nassessment,  the  consultants  will  recommend  further  measures  that  are  required  to  be  taken \nprior to the completion of the Project by the local government. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12   \n\n43\n\nExpertise, Cost Estimates, and Financing Plan \n\nin  (i) social  development;  (ii) design  of  vocational \n\nC. \n \n6. \nAbout  16  person-months  of  international  and  domestic  consulting  services  will  be \nengaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The consultants will \ntraining  programs; \nhave  expertise \n(iii) community-based  tourism  and  cultural  tourism;  (iv) ethnic  minority  cultures  in  the  project \narea, especially Bai and Naxi; and (v) cultural preservation. The local government, in liaison with \nWest Yunnan Railway Company (WYRC), will (i) assign appropriate counterpart staff to facilitate \nthe work of consultants; (ii) set up meetings, field visits, and discussions with local agencies in \nconnection  with  the  study;  and  (iii) provide  all  documentation  and  assistance  as  may  be \nreasonably requested by the consultants to complete the work.  \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $188,000  equivalent,  comprising  $47,000  in \n7. \nforeign  exchange  and  $141,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  ADB  will  finance  $150,000 \nequivalent  on  a  grant  basis  from  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program  to  cover  the  entire  foreign \nexchange cost and $103,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government will finance \nthe  remaining  local  currency  cost  amounting  to  $38,000,  which  covers  the  provision  of \ncounterpart staff, local transportation, background reports, studies, and logistics. \n \n\nTable A12: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n($\u2019000) \n \n\n \n\nLocal \n\nForeign \n\nExchange  Currency \n\n0.0 \n42.0 \n7.0 \n3.0 \n0.0 \n26.0 \n8.0 \n\n27.0 \n0.0 \n10.0 \n3.0 \n3.0 \n0.0 \n2.0 \n\na.

The  Dali\u2013Lijiang  Railway  (DLR)  will  connect  the  poor,  landlocked  part  of  northwestern \nYunnan  province  with  the  rest  of  the  PRC  through  the  existing  Guangtong\u2013Dali  (Guangda) \nrailway,  including  Kunming,  Fangcheng  and  Beihai  ports,  and  Haiphong  in  Viet  Nam.  The \nproject  area  has  industrial,  natural  resources,  and  tourism  development  potential.  The  Project \nwill also help promote regional cooperation in the Greater Mekong Subregion. \n \n2. \nFreight  traffic  was  forecast  by  commodity  (i.e.,  coal,  petroleum  products,  steel  and \nnonferrous  metal,  metallic  ore,  nonmetallic  ore,  building  material,  cement,  timber,  chemicals, \nfoodstuffs,  and  others)  in  two  categories  differentiated  by  their  economic  impact:  (i) traffic \ndiverted from other modes, mainly roads, based on an assessment of the relative service and \ncost competitiveness of the DLR; and (ii) generated traffic that would only move because of the \nDLR.  The  traffic  forecast  was  based  on  the  model  of  the  Second  Survey  and  Design  Institute \n(SSDI), that considered expected economic growth, population increase, tourism development \npotential, local government development plans, market surveys, and the judgment of technical \nassistance (TA) consultants and the ADB mission. Based on the work of the TA consultants and \nthe  SSDI,  the  freight  volume  on  the  DLR  is  forecast  to  increase  from  about  640 million  ton-\nkilometers (km) in 2010 to 1,457 million ton-km in 2025 with annual growth rates ranging from \n4.5% to 6.4%. Passenger traffic was forecast based on similar factors, with a particular focus on \ntourism  development  potential. 1  Passenger  traffic  is  forecast  to  grow  from  448 million \npassenger-km in 2010 to 1,234 million passenger-km in 2025, with average annual growth rate \nranging from 6.5% to 7.3% (Table A13.1). \n \n3. \nTransportation  improvements  will  facilitate  the  development  of  natural  resources  and \nassociated industries. Local governments are seeking private sector companies to invest in their \nareas, particularly in the tourism industry. Freight and passenger traffic forecasts are considered \nreasonable given that (i) the  Guangda railway, an adjoining line to the DLR, has experienced a \nstrong growth  (about  35%  per  annum)  in  the  last  4  years;  (ii) similar  joint-venture  railways in \nPRC have experienced high annual traffic growth (e.g., 26% for freight and 16% for passengers) \nand (iii) potential cross-border traffic would grow between Yunnan  province and Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries under the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement.  \n \nB. \n \nCost. The economic evaluation was based on a comparison of with- and without-project \n4. \nscenarios, using constant 2004 economic prices. The  project costs and benefits were revalued \nin  economic  prices  by  separating  the  cost  items  into  tradable  materials  and  equipment, \nnontradable materials, labor, and land. The prices were expressed in yuan using the domestic \nprice  numeraire  with  a  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  of  1.01  for  foreign  exchange  effects.  A \nshadow price was used to put an economic value on the wages paid to unskilled labor, but not \non wages for skilled labor since there is no clear surplus of skilled workers. A shadow wage rate \nfactor  of  0.67  was  used  to  convert  the  financial  wage  rate  to  an  economic  opportunity  cost  of \nlabor. \n \n5. \nBenefits. The economic benefits consist of (i) operating cost savings in diverted freight \nand passenger traffic from roads, (ii) operating cost savings in generated passengers estimated \nby the difference between  the railway and buses, (iii) time savings in diverted passenger traffic \nfrom  the  buses  based  on  the  value  of  time  estimated  from the net income of local residents, \n(iv) the net economic value  calculated on the basis of the economic value per  additional ton of \n\nEconomic Evaluation \n\n                                                 \n1  Lijiang is a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization world heritage site. \n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n45 \n\neach commodity of generated traffic as a result of the construction of the DLR, and (v) the net \neconomic  value  of  generated  tourist  days  by  estimating  the  number  of  tourists  and  average \nexpenditure  and  considering  the  cost  of  providing  the  services  for  the  tourists.  The  salvage \nvalue was calculated based on the economic life of each project component. \n \n6. \nLeast-Cost Analysis.  Alternative transport modes and designs, particularly roads, were \nassessed  to  determine  the  least-cost  option  to  provide  sufficient  capacity  to  cater  to  the \nexpected demand. It was considered viable to build a nonelectrified single-track railway in this \ncorridor  to  meet  the  anticipated  traffic  demand  at  this  stage,  given  the  railway  network \ndevelopment,  type  of  cargos  and  passengers,  and  the  energy  efficiency.  Six  alternative \nalignments were subsequently evaluated during feasibility study for the following sections: along \nErhai  Lake,  Haidong-Wenbi,  Haidong-Wase,  Bijia  mountain  tunnels,  Xiyi-Changtou,  and \nChangtou-Lijiang south. Criteria adopted for this purpose included railway length, cost estimates, \nlength  and  difficulty  of  the  construction  of  bridges  and  tunnels,  construction  period,  and \nenvironmental and social impacts, including resettlement. \n \n7. \nConclusion. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project is 17% (Table \nA13.3).  Benefits  from  the  freight  traffic,  including  generated  commodity  production,  are  the \nmajor  economic  benefit  (80%),  followed  by  passenger  benefits  (14%),  and  tourism  benefits \n(6%). Sensitivity analysis tested seven scenarios to assess the robustness of the results of the \neconomic analysis (Table A13.4). The capital cost would have to be more than 54% higher than \nestimated for the EIRR to fall below the cutoff rate of 12%. Considering the past experience of \nADB-financed  projects  in  the  railway  sector,  this  switching  value  is  unlikely  to  occur.  ADB-\nfinanced  railway  projects  in  the  PRC  have  not  encountered  major  cost  overruns,  and  the \ncontract  prices  tend  to  be  lower  than  estimated  because  the  contracting  process  is  becoming \nincreasingly competitive. The benefits level would have to decrease more than 30% to make the \nProject economically nonviable.  A reduction in the generated production by 20% and a 1-year \ndelay in completion  do not affect economic  viability. Combinations of adverse effects of costs \nand benefits were also tested. The result showed that the Project would maintain its economic \nviability under those scenarios. \n \n8. \nThe  economic  analysis  of  the  Project  was  extended  to  quantify  the  project  risk  and \ndistribute project net benefits among various stakeholders. The risk analysis was based on the \n\u201cMonte  Carlo\u201d  method  by  considering  the  possible  value  for  key  variables,  including  capital \ncosts,  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  passenger  traffic,  freight  traffic,  and  net  economic \nvalue of generated production, as well as the probability with which they may occur. The result \nshows that the EIRR would exceed 12% with 95% probability. Distribution analysis was carried \nout  by  distributing  project  net  benefits  through  determining  the  project  effects  for  project \nbeneficiaries, such as shippers, passengers, labor, and government/local economy. The result \nshows  that  a  large  proportion  (CNY5.261 million)  of  net  benefits  will  accrue  to  the \ngovernment/local economy through generated production of commodities.  \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nTable A13.1: Traffic Forecast \n \n2010\n\n2015\n\n  \n\n  \nFreight (million) \n   Ton \n   Ton-kms \n \n \n   By commodity (ton-kms) \n\n \n\nCoal \nPetroleum Products \nSteel and nonferrous metal \nOther alloys \nZinc concentrate \nMetallic ore \nIron Ore \nLead \nManganese \nZinc ore \nNonmetallic ore \nBuilding material \nCement \nTimber \nChemicals \nFertilizers \nFoodstuff \nOther \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPassenger (million) \n\nNumber \n   of which tourists \nPassenger-kms \n\n \n           5.4              7.2 \n       640.0          872.7 \n \n \n         14.9            20.0 \n         27.3            37.0 \n           5.1              0.7 \n         28.4            38.4 \n           5.1              0.7 \n           2.1              2.7 \n           2.1              2.7 \n           8.5            10.7 \n         10.4            13.1 \n         25.5            32.1 \n         21.0            12.6 \n         23.1            36.1 \n       297.7          430.6 \n         16.4            21.9 \n         23.7            26.6 \n           6.0            11.0 \n         22.2            26.0 \n       100.2          149.8 \n \n \n           3.1              4.4 \n           2.4              3.3 \n       448.4          637.8 \n\n2020\n\n2025\n\n \n\n \n\n            9.8 \n      1,168.8 \n\n          12.2 \n      1,456.6 \n\n          26.5 \n          53.6 \n            3.3 \n          51.2 \n            3.3 \n            3.6 \n            3.6 \n          14.4 \n          17.6 \n          43.2 \n          19.6 \n          48.3 \n        558.0 \n          30.7 \n          34.8 \n          15.9 \n          36.4 \n        204.8 \n\n          32.2 \n          71.4 \n          13.8 \n          62.9 \n          13.8 \n            4.5 \n            4.5 \n          17.8 \n          21.8 \n          53.5 \n          27.9 \n          59.4 \n         665.4 \n          39.6 \n          42.1 \n          21.4 \n          46.8 \n         257.8 \n\n            6.2 \n            4.7 \n        900.4 \n\n            8.5 \n            6.4 \n      1,233.6 \n\nkm = kilometers \nSources: Technical assistance consultants;

The project railway, the DLR, will be \nconnected  to  the  Guangda  line  to  extend  the  railway  network  from  Dali  to  Lijiang,  another \npopular  tourist  city  in  Yunnan.  To  maximize  the  operating  efficiency,  the  Ministry  of  Railways \n(MOR)  and  Yunnan  provincial  government  (YPG),  the  existing  shareholders  of  WYRC,  have \ndecided that the DLR will be operated by WYRC. MOR and YPG have committed to contribute \nthe  required  capital  for  the  construction  of  the  DLR.  Table  A14.1  presents  GDRC\u2019s  audited \nfinancial  performance  during  2001\u20132003  and  financial  projections  of  WYRC  covering  the \nconstruction period and 20 years of operations (2004\u20132028). The projections reflect the overall \noperating  performance  and  financial  status  of  GDRC  and  WYRC  including  both  the  Guangda \nand  DLR  lines  in  current  terms.  The  domestic  price  escalation  is  assumed  to  be  2.7%  per \nannum  for  2005,  and  3%  thereafter  and  the  international price escalation is estimated at zero \npercent per annum for 2005 and thereafter. \n \nB. \n\nMajor Assumptions for the Financial Projections \n\n2. \nThe  existing  average  tariff  rates  of  the  Guangda  line  are  used  for  projecting  the \nrevenues of both the Guangda and DLR lines. The tariffs, CNY0.25 per ton-km for freight and \nCNY0.27  per  passenger-km1 in 2004, were increased every 5 years by 5% in nominal terms. \nDLR traffic growth rates follow the traffic analysis in Appendix 13. Freight traffic of the Guangda \nline  is  based  on  the  projected  freight  volume  of  8.1 million  tons  in  2010,  11.9 million tons in \n2015, and 29.3 million tons in 2025. Passenger traffic of the Guangda line is forecast based on \nthe  operations  of  7  pairs  per  day  in  2010,  10  pairs  per  day  in  2015,  and  21  pairs  per  day  in \n2025. This implies a traffic growth rate of 12% during the initial stage of operations and the rate \nwill gradually decline to 7% toward the end of the projection period. A business tax of 3.24% is \nimposed on gross revenue. The income tax is 33% on profit before tax.2 \n \n3. \nOperating expenses are forecast to increase annually in line with domestic inflation and \nto increase by 10% in real terms every 5 years. Depreciation expenses are based on a 25-year \naverage economic asset life. Salaries and wages account for the major portion of general and \nadministrative expenses. Currently, WYRC employs 570 staff and plans to recruit an additional \n300 staff for the operations of the DLR. Financial expenses reflect the expected interest rates \nand outstanding borrowings. \n \nWYRC will borrow $180 million from ADB and \u20ac33.5 million ($40 million equivalent) from \n4. \nthe Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) to finance the Project. The ADB loan will be a \nLondon interbank offered rate-based loan with 25-year maturity including a 5-year grace period. \nAFD\u2019s  loan  will  be  a  euro  interbank  offered  rate  (Euribor)-based  loan  with  a  17-year maturity \nincluding a 5-year grace period. Capital injections from MOR and YPG in the ratio of 70:30 to \nfinance the Project are classified as paid-in capital.   \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Freight tariffs vary according to types of commodities transported while passenger tariffs are based on types of \n\nseats. The above rates reflect the freight and passenger tariffs on average.  \n\n2  GDRC was granted exemption from business tax during the financial years 2002\u20132005. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n49 \n\nFinancial Performance of the Project and Proposed Covenants  \n\nC. \n \n5. \nThe financial performance of WYRC is projected to be sound and sustainable over the \nlong term. Freight and passenger traffic on the Guangda line has increased substantially since \nthe  beginning  of  operations.  Continued  increasing  traffic,  albeit  at  slower  growth  rates,  will \ncontribute to higher net profits. However, these are projected to decline in 2010, the first year \nwhen  the  DLR  is  open  to  commercial  traffic.  This  reflects  the  relatively  low  traffic  volume  and \nrevenues of the DLR during the initial stage of operation. Because it will take time for traffic to \ngrow, the increase in operating costs will initially be higher than the incremental revenues. The \nsubsequent  increase  in  traffic  on  the  DLR,  together  with  improved  operating  efficiency  as  a \nresult  of  the  combined  operations  of  the  Guangda  and  the  DLR  lines,  will  result  in  better \noperating  performance  and  higher  net  profits.  Cash  flow  from  operations  will  be  sufficient  to \nfulfill the debt obligations. \n \n6. \nThe following three sets of financial covenants are in the Loan Agreement: (i) operating \nratio of not more than 75%, (ii) debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.2, and (iii) debt-to-equity \nratio of not more than 60:40. These covenants will be applicable from the third fiscal year of full \noperation.  Based  on  the  financial  projections,  the  company  is  expected  to  comply  with  these \ncovenants.  \n\n \n\n\f5\n0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\ni\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n4\n \n \n \n

Project covers the construction period during 2005\u20132008 \nand  20  years  of  operations  during  2009\u20132028.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  is \ncalculated in constant 2004 prices, after removing the potential impacts of inflation and foreign \ncurrency fluctuation and on an after-tax basis. Table A14.2 presents the FIRR calculation. The \nkey assumptions used in the evaluation are as follows: \n \n\n(i)  Capital  costs  consist  of  project  costs  excluding  costs  for  local  roads,  price \ncontingencies,  and  financial  charges  during  construction.  The  residual  value  is \nestimated based on an average economic life of assets of 25 years. \n\n \n(ii)  Revenues  of  the  Project  include  (a) freight  and  passenger  revenues  of  the  DLR; \n(b) incremental  revenues  to  the  Guangda  line  as  a  result  of  additional  traffic \noriginated  from  or  destined  for  the  connecting  DLR;  and  (c) other  revenues \nincluding  loading  and  unloading,  warehouse  storage,  parcel  transfer,  and  rental \nincome  from  commercial  areas  in  the  train  stations.  Freight  and  passenger \nrevenues  are  projected  based  on  forecast  freight  and  passenger  traffic  and  tariffs. \nFreight and passenger tariffs are CNY0.25 per ton-km and CNY0.27 per passenger-\nkm, respectively. Other revenues are estimated at 12% of total revenues. GDRC will \nbe subject to business tax of 3.24% that is to be deducted from gross revenues and \nincome tax of 33% on profits before tax. \n\n \n(iii)  Operating costs include all incremental costs incurred by the operations but exclude \ndepreciation  provisions.  Based  on  the  operational  experience  of  GDRC,  the \noperating costs were estimated as follows: fixed cost (including provision for major \nrepair and maintenance) CNY447,000 per line-km, freight variable cost of CNY0.07 \nper ton-km, and passenger variable cost of CNY0.03 per passenger-km. \n\n \n2. \nThe  estimated  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC),  after  tax,  in  real  terms  was \ncalculated based on the capital mix and costs of funds. Costs have been considered as follows: \n(i) the applicable 10-year fixed swap rate plus a provision of ADB\u2019s spread of 0.6% is used for \nADB debt, (ii) the applicable 10-year fixed swap rate is used for AFD debt, and (iii) the cost of \nequity was assumed to be 8%. The cost of debt is also adjusted to reflect the impact of income \ntax  of  33%.  The  nominal  cost  of  debt  is  converted  to  the  real  cost  of  debt  by  applying  the \ndomestic  and  international  inflation  rate  for  domestic  and  foreign  currency  denominated  debt, \nrespectively.  \n \n3. \nThe Project FIRR is estimated to be 6.7%, which is higher than the WACC of 4.5% The \nfinancial  viability  of  the  Project  is  thus  considered  satisfactory.  The  FIRR  was  subjected  to \nsensitivity analysis  under  various  adverse  conditions.  The  sensitivity  analysis  showed  that  the \nFIRR  would  decrease  to  (i) 5.6%  if  the  revenues  were  to  decrease  by  10%;  (ii) 5.7%  if  the \nProject was to experience a capital cost overrun of 10%; (iii) 6.4% if the operating costs were to \nincrease  by  10%;  (iv) 6.0%  if  the  Project  was  to  experience  a  commissioning  delay  of  1  year; \n(v) 4.6% if scenarios (i)\u2013(iii) happen; and (vi) 4.0% if scenarios (i)\u2013(iv) all happen. The Project is \nthus  considered  financially  viable  under  almost  all  adverse  scenarios.  The  results  of  the \nsensitivity analysis are shown in Table A14.3. \n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nTable A14.2: Financial Internal Rate of Return \n(CNY million) \n\nOperating \nand Other \nCosts \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\nOther \n\nRevenue  Taxes Paid \n\nFreight \nRevenue \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCapital \nCosts \n           11.7  \n         673.7  \n       1,287.0  \n       1,594.8  \n         806.2  \n\nPassenger \nRevenue \n \n \n \n \n \n         118.4           157.8              13.4              10.6                5.9  \n         183.5           315.5            200.0              33.7              71.5  \n         190.7           335.7            214.6              36.0              82.1  \n         198.4           357.2            230.3              38.5              93.5  \n         206.6           380.0            247.1              41.1            105.7  \n           89.0            215.4           404.4            265.1              43.9            118.7  \n         111.0            224.7           430.2            284.4              46.8            131.8  \n         234.7           457.8            305.2              50.0            145.7  \n         245.3           487.1            327.5              53.4            161.6  \n         256.6           518.3            351.4              57.1            178.5  \n         268.6           551.4            377.0              60.9            196.6  \n           15.0            278.3           576.2            401.6              64.2            211.9  \n         602.2            427.7              67.7            227.9  \n         629.3            455.5              71.4            245.0  \n         657.6            485.1              75.3            263.0  \n         173.9            322.1           687.2            516.6              79.3            282.1  \n         334.5           718.1            550.2              83.7            302.2  \n         347.6           750.4            585.9              88.2            323.4  \n         361.3           784.2            624.0              93.1            345.9  \n        (839.9)           375.7           819.5            664.6              98.1            369.6  \n \n \n \n \n \n\nNet Cash \nFlow \n          (11.7) \n        (673.7) \n      (1,287.0) \n      (1,594.8) \n        (806.2) \n           57.4  \n         294.2  \n         313.4  \n         333.9  \n         355.9  \n         290.3  \n         294.0  \n         432.6  \n         461.2  \n         491.7  \n         524.2  \n         536.9  \n         581.2  \n         612.0  \n         644.5  \n         505.0  \n         715.2  \n         753.6  \n         794.1  \n       1,676.8  \n \nWeighted Average Cost of Capital = 4.5%  \nFinancial Internal Rate of Return = 6.7%  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nYear \n2004 \n2005 \n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \n2027 \n2028 \n \n \n \n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nTable A14.3: Sensitivity Analysis \n\n Item \nBase Case \n(i) Lower revenues \n(ii) Capital cost overrun \n(iii) Higher operating costs \n(iv) Implementation  delay \n(v) Combination of (i), (ii), and (iii) \n(vi) Combination of (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nChange in \nVariable \n\n \n\n  \n\n10% \n10% \n10% \n1 year \n \n\nFIRR \n(%) \n6.7 \n5.6 \n5.7 \n6.4 \n6.0 \n4.6 \n4.0 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n53 \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN  \n\n \n1. \nThe  project  railway  alignment  will  cross  56  villages  in  13  townships  from  Dali  city  to \nLijiang  city  in  Yunnan  province.  An  estimated  5,913 mu  (394  hectares  [ha])  of  land  will  be \npermanently  acquired,  of  which  about  70.3%  is  currently  under  cultivation.  The  number  of \naffected people will be about 4,159, assuming total loss of cultivated land based on average per \ncapita landholdings. The Project will also temporarily require an estimated 1,600 mu (106.7 ha), \naffecting 250 people. About  179,804 square meters (m2) of mainly residential structures will be \naffected,  requiring  relocation  of  680  households  (3,150  people).  The  relocation  of  one school \nand  a  brick-kiln will  require  594 m2 and  affect  an additional  150  people.  The  total  number  of \npeople  directly affected is estimated at 7,709. Land acquisition and resettlement impacts were \nminimized  by  aligning  the  railway  away  from  densely  populated  areas,  and  avoiding  irrigated \nland and facilities, where possible, based on consultations with communities. \n \n2. \nThe Ministry of Railways (MOR), Western Yunnan Railway Company (WYRC), and local \ngovernments  prepared  the  resettlement  plan,  with  the  assistance  of  project  preparatory \ntechnical assistance (PPTA) consultants and Southwest Jiaotong University (SWJU). It is based \non the first stage of a preliminary design study, 20 village surveys, 218 household surveys, local \ngovernment  statistics,  and  consultations  with  local  officials,  village  leaders,  and  affected \nhouseholds. The resettlement plan will be revised based on the detailed measurement survey, \nincluding associated cost changes. The revised resettlement plan will be disclosed to affected \npeople, and submitted to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for concurrence prior to the start \nof civil works. \n \nThe  resettlement  objective  is  to  ensure  that  compensation  and  entitlement  provided  to \n3. \naffected people are adequate to at least maintain their \u201cwithout-project\u201d standard of living, with \nprospects  of  improvement,  in  line  with  the  Land  Administration  Law  (1998)  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) and with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement (1995), and policy \non  indigenous  peoples  (1998).  People  losing  land,  housing,  other  assets,  or  other  means  of \nproduction will be compensated at replacement cost and assisted in restoring their incomes and \nliving  standards.  In  2004,  the  PRC  Constitution  was  amended  to  ensure  that  people  are \ncompensated according to law for land expropriated for public projects. \n \n4. \nThe  resettlement  plan  stipulates  eligibility/entitlement  provisions  for  affected  people. \nPermanent  land  losses  will  be  compensated  either  through  land  reallocation  within  villager \ngroups  or  through  cash  payments  at  rates  of  8\u201310  times  the  average  annual  output  value \n(AAOV) of the land. A resettlement subsidy is calculated at  4\u20136 times AAOV. Compensation for \ntemporary land loss will be paid directly to the affected people and the land will be restored to \nfarmland after use. Compensation for housing losses will be paid directly to the affected people \nat replacement cost, free of demolition expenses and salvaged materials; these households will \nrebuild their own houses within the same village. Crop and tree losses will be directly paid to the \naffected people. Private shops will be paid compensation for relocation and reconstruction. \n \n5. \nOut of 56 affected  villages, five are  seriously  affected.  However,  none of the  farming \nhouseholds will incur complete land loss. Also, income loss is thus less severe because planted \ncrops typically account for less than 30% of the household\u2019s gross income. Special assistanc e is \nprovided to vulnerable households that include orphans, widows, the seriously disabled, and the \nmentally ill.  Ethnic minorities  account  for  83% of the  affected  people,  including  Bai,  Lisu,  and \nNaxi villages. Special measures have been included in the  resettlement plan and the EMDP  to \nensure  compliance  with  ADB's  social  safeguard  policies  and  guidelines  and  to  enhance \nopportunities for affected people to directly benefit from the Project. \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nin \n\ninvestments \n\n \n6. \nEach  village  will  utilize  the  land  compensation  and  resettlement  subsidy  for  income \nrestoration. Each village or group will decide the amount of funds to be invested collectively and \nthe amount to be provided directly to affected households. Income restoration measures include \n(i) land redistribution within affected groups, (ii) collective investments in land development and \nenterprises,  (iii) individual \nfarm  and  nonfarm  business,  (iv) setting  up \ninsurance/pension  funds  for  the  elderly,  (v) provision  of  job  training,  and  (vi) employment  in \nproject-related activities during construction. \n \n7. \nMOR,  WYRC,  and  local  government,  including  the  prefecture-  and  county-level  land \nacquisition and  resettlement  offices  and  land  administration  bureaus,  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementing and delegating resettlement activities to township officials and village committees. \nThe  estimated  resettlement  cost  is  CNY141 million  ($17.1 million),  including  contingencies. \nAgreement on the total resettlement budget was reached on 21 July 2004 between MOR and \nYPG.  The  resettlement  budget  will  be  adjusted  based  on  the  actual  measurement  of  physical \nlosses.  Dali  prefecture  and  Lijiang  city  governments  will  finance  costs  for  livelihood  training \n(e.g., agricultural and nonagricultural training), and additional support for vulnerable groups. \n \n8. \nAffected  people  were  informed  and  consulted  about  the  likely  impacts  of  the  project  at \nvarious stages. Stakeholders consulted include heads of affected households, village heads and \nrepresentatives, local government agencies and departments, and vulnerable groups, including \nwomen  and  ethnic  minorities.  A  resettlement  information  booklet  was  distributed  to  villages, \ngroups,  and  households  affected  by  land  loss  and/or  relocation.  The resettlement information \nbooklet contains project description and impact, compensation policy, compensation standards, \nparticipation, and grievance procedures.  Affected  households  will  also  be  consulted  and  can \nparticipate  in  resettlement  activities,  including  the  detailed  measurement  survey,  location  of \nunderpasses, new housing sites, collective investment of compensation, and grievance redress. \n \nin \n9. \ncollaboration  with  the  county  resettlement  offices,  will  be  responsible  for  internal  supervision \nand monitoring. The following activities will be monitored: (i) compensation payments, (ii) house \nrebuilding/relocation  for  affected  people,  (iii) land  redistribution,  and  (iv) grievance  redress. \nProgress  reports  will  be  prepared  by  WYRC  and  submitted  to  ADB  on  a  quarterly  basis,  until \nresettlement  is  completed.  WYRC  will  then  prepare  a  resettlement  completion  report  for \nsubmission to MOR and ADB. In addition, an independent monitor will be contracted by WYRC \nto carry out the external monitoring and evaluation work.

The \nEMDP  includes  specific  actions  for  affec ted  ethnic  minorities  to  ensure  compliance  with  the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  policy  on  indigenous  peoples.  Measures  to  enhance  the \neconomic  conditions  of  ethnic  minorities  have  either  been  integrated  into  project  design  or \nspecified separately in the EMDP. \n \nThe Project will directly benefit about 1.1 million people in the project area, of whom 73% \n2. \nare ethnic minorities including Bai (46.2%), Naxi (18.3%), Yi (3.2%), and Lisu (2.8%).  The new \nrail  network  will  enable  ethnic  minority  families  to  use  improved transportation services, have \nbetter access to social services (e.g., government, cultural, health, and education services), and \nemployment  opportunities,  both  from  construction  and  induced  economic  development.  The \nrailway  line  will  traverse  Dali  county-level  city  and  Heqing  county  in  Dali  Bai  Autonomous \nPrefecture, and Lijiang county in  Lijiang prefecture.  Along the proposed alignment, 83% of the \nresettlement-affected  populations  are  ethnic  minorities.  The  Project  will  have  a  direct  adverse \nimpact  on  these  ethnic  groups  in  terms  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  which  will  affect \nabout 7,709 people. Special measures are included in the resettlement plan to mitigate potential \nrisks  such  as  impoverishment  and  social  exclusion.  In  addition  to  the  Han  (16.8%),  ethnic \ngroups affected by resettlement include the Bai (74.3%), and some Naxi (6.2%), Yi (1.5%), and \nLisu  (0.4%)  people.  Detailed  provisions  to  address  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts \nare included in the resettlement plan (e.g., compensation for land loss). \n \n3. \nA social due diligence investigation was carried out to assess potential induced impacts \nof  the  Project  in  seven  counties  neighboring  the  project  area,  which  is  referred  to  as  the \nboundaries of analysis (BOA). In the BOA, ethnic groups include: the Zang (Tibetans), Yi and \nNaxi  in  Xianggelila  county;  Yi,  Naxi,  Mosuo,  and  Pumi  in  Ninglang;  Bai,  Lisu,  and  Pumi  in \nLanping county; Yi and Lisu in Yongsheng county; Lisu and Zang in Weixi county; and the Bai in \nEryuan  and  Jianchuan  counties.  The  mainstream  Han  constitute  70%  of  the  population  in \nYongsheng  county,  and  between  15%  and  30%  in  Eryuan,  Ninglang,  Weixi,  and  Xianggelila, \nand less than 10% in Jianchuan and Lanping counties. The results of this assessment indicated \nstrong support for railway development as well as concerns that economic growth was changing \nlocal  behavior.  Although  tourism  development  had  some  adverse  effects,2  in  general  it  was \npositive for cultural preservation, such as the reconstruction of monasteries financed by tourism \nrevenues. \n \n4. \nThe Government adopted a policy of ethnic equality post-1949 so all  groups are legally \nand constitutionally equal. Local governments of autonomous areas have been able to decide \non  economic  policy,  including  what  to  produce,  some  latitude  in  allocating  government \nsubsidies,  and  within  set  guidelines,  education  and  budgeting  based  on  the  Law  on  Ethnic \nRegional  Autonomy  (1984).  Recent  government  policies  and  programs  have  further  helped \nprotect and enhance living standards of ethnic minority groups. \n \nThe Project directly benefits ethnic minorities in terms of higher income from increased \n5. \ncash-crop  farming,  more  cash  income  sources  due  to  seasonal  migration  work  and  tourism \nopportunities, enhanced communication with urban centers, and  better access to markets and \nsocial services. Construction access roads will improve transport services, and will be handed \n\n                                                 \n1  Ethnic  minority  groups  are  distinct  from  the  mainstream  ethnic  group,  the  Han.  The  PRC  policy  defines \n\nnationalities (minzu) based on shared language, territory, economic base, and traditions/culture. \n\n2  The  Mosuo  group\u2014a  matriarchal  society  located  in  Lugu  Lake  in  Ninglang  county  (BOA)  has  come  under \npressure from excessive tourism development. The ethnic affairs bureau and tourism bureau are taking measures \nto avoid negative influences and to enhance cultural preservation as the basis for tourism. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 17 \n\n59 \n\n \nover to the community after completion of railway construction. In addition, the Project will have \nthe  following  socioeconomic  benefits:  (i) reduced  travel  times  between  Dali  and  Lijiang; \n(ii) increased affordable, safe, and comfortable transport for passengers traveling between Dali \nand  Lijiang;  (iii) removal  of  constraints  to  economic  growth,  especially  cargo  transportation in \nthe  project  area;  and  (iv) increased  short-term  construction  jobs  in  townships  crossed  by  the \nrailway.  \n \n6. \nSpecific activities are incorporated into the EMDP to ensure that ethnic minorities share \nproportionately in project benefits and adverse impacts are properly mitigated (Table A17). The \nProject and the EMDP will benefit women who are very active in the workforce when economic \nopportunities  are  available,  especially  tourism.  Women  expressed interest in launching small \nbusinesses  next to the  proposed  railway  stations.  However,  women  often  lack  education  and \nartisan  skills;  therefore,  job  training  programs  will  be  targeted  at  the  affected  villages,  and \nwomen in particular. The incidence of reported HIV/AIDS infection is not high in the project area, \nhowever  ethnic  minority  groups  residing  in  the  project  area  could  be  more  vulnerable  to  the \nspread of infection given their numbers, language, culture, geographic location, and low levels \nof HIV/AIDS knowledge and awareness. For this reason, special measures are included in the \nproject  for  HIV/AIDS  awareness  and  prevention.  Ecological and culturally sustainable tourism \nalso  needs  to  be  implemented;  tourism  strategies  have  already  been  adopted  in  Yunnan  and \nthis  year  a  tourism  plan  has  been  formulated  for  northwestern  Yunnan.  The  induced  social \nimpacts  of  economic  development,  including  tourism,  will  be  monitored  during  project \nconstruction to ensure that preservation measures of ethnic minority cultures are effective. \n \n7. \nThe  Western  Yunnan  Railway  Company  (WYRC)  is  responsible  for  implementing  the \nEMDP and will work closely with local governments, including the ethnic affairs bureaus. Most of \nthe budget for the EMDP is included in the civil works cost (e.g., station area development), the \nresettlement plan budget, and  local employment on project-related activities. Part of the budget \nfor  nonagricultural  training  and  HIV/AIDS  awareness  will  come  from  existing  local  government \nprograms.  ADB  will  also  provide  a  $150,000  grant  as  technical  assistance  for  (i) capacity \nbuilding and skill enhancement programs for the poor and ethnic minorities; (ii) feasibility studies \nfor cultural protection and preservation; and (iii) assessing the effectiveness of measures being \ntaken \ntourism \ndevelopment. \n \n8. \nWYRC  is  responsible  for  internal  monitoring  of  the  EMDP  and  will  submit  progress \nreports  to  ADB  semiannually.  An  independent  monitor  will  conduct  external  monitoring  and \nevaluation,  and  reports  will  be  submitted  to  WYRC  and  ADB  annually.  Results  will  be \ndisaggregated  by  ethnic  minority  group  and  sex,  wherever  possible.  The ADB midterm review \nwill  assess  the  status  and  effectiveness  of  EMDP  implementation;  if  needed,  steps  to  better \nprotect or publicize ethnic culture will be further discussed with MOR. \n \n\nlocal  cultures,  particularly  with  respect \n\nto  project-induced \n\nto  preserve \n\n \n\n\fProposed Actions \n\nTargets* \n\nLead/Supporting \nAgencies Involved \n\nTiming \n\nFunding \nRequirements \n\nMonitoring Indicators \n\nTable A17: Summary Ethnic Minority Action Plan  \n\n60       Appendix 17 \n\n1.

Improved access to markets reduces transport costs, and \nopens up opportunities for locally produced goods and services. Construction and operation of the railway generates \nadditional  employment  opportunities  in  local  communities,  providing  an  additional  source  of  income  for  people, \nincluding  poor  households  along  the  alignment  and  in  the  wider  project  area.  Incoming  passengers  and  tourists \ngenerate additional demand for locally produced goods and services. Secondary development associated with railway \nconstruction  includes  construction  of  access  roads  and  the  upgrading  and  extension  of  connector  roads  from  the \nstation  to  the  main  road  network.  These  roads  help  extend  project  benefits  and  opportunities  to  the  rural  poor \ncommunities  by  improving  local  infrastructure,  reducing  transport  costs,  increasing  access  to  markets,  stimulating \nprice competition, and improving conditions for economic growth, including tourism. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                          Targeting Classification: Ge neral intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe links between poverty, minority nationality, topography, and transport systems are apparent in the project area for \nthe Dali\u2013Lijiang Railway.  The Project will benefit about 1.1 million people in the project area.  The proposed railway \ntransverses across 13 townships, directly affecting Dali county-level city and Heqing county in Dali Bai Autonomous \nPrefecture, and Lijiang county. Out of 1.1 million beneficiaries, about  75% are rural with an average rural net income \nper capita of CNY2,202 in 2002, and about 30% are poor with an average net income per capita of less than CNY900. \nA total of 372 key poverty reduction villages are located in the project area, out of which 27 villages are located in the \nproject railway corridor townships. About 73% of the people in the project area are ethnic minorities (e.g., Bai, Naxi, \nand Yi). The boundaries of analysis (BOA) includes neighboring counties that could be affected from induced impacts \nfrom the proposed Project, based on the existing and planned transportation networks. The BOA includes: Eryuan and \nJianchuan  counties  in  Dali  Bai  prefecture,  Ninglang  and  Yongsheng  counties  in  Lijiang  prefecture,  Weixi  and \nXianggelila  (Zhongdian)  counties  in  Diqing  prefecture  and  Lanping  county  in  Nujiang  prefecture.  About  91%  of  the \npopulation is rural with a poverty incidence of more than 60% and an average net income per capita of CNY1,128 in \n2002. The Project  considered these counties within BOA as part of its due diligence of the potential adverse impacts \non local ethnic populations.  \n \nThe  Project  will  benefit  poor  people  in  the  project  area  through  direct  benefits  from  employment  during  the \nconstruction and operation of the railway. It is estimated that 96,800 person-years of work spread over 3.5 years will \nbe needed to construct the railway, or about 27,670 person-years of work per year. Of these, 60% will be for unskilled \nlaborers, of which 50% or more will be targeted to poor ethnic minority households. Priority will be given to women and \npeople  from  resettlement-affected  households.  Employment  will  be  created  through  the  use  of  locally  produced \nmaterials for railway construction (e.g., cement). The Project will finance 251 kilometers (km) of construction access \nroads, which will be handed over to the local government at the end of the construction period. The construction of \npassenger stations, using architecture unique to the ethnic minority of the area, will cater to the information needs of \npassengers and touris ts. There will be sufficient space in or around the stations for local area development. Kiosks or \nconcession  stalls  will  be  incorporated  into  the  design  of  these  intermediate  stations.  Local  governments  will  be \nencouraged  to  convert  additional  space  around  the  railway  stations  for  commercial  businesses.  This  will  have \nimmediate benefits for the local poor population. \n \nThe Project will also provide efficient and low-cost transportation for passengers and goods, which will improve access \nto markets, and help the development of natural resources and industry in the area. Local government will prioritize a \nnumber of rural roads for upgrading to provide better access of economic opportunities that the railway will generate \nfor remote communities. These improvements will help generate additional opportunities for the poor population in the \nBOA through indirect project benefits, which will increase in the long run. \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 18 \n\n63 \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\n   No \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\n   Yes               \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nVarious public consultation and participation activities for the Project have been carried out since 2002. The Ministry of \nRailways (MOR), West Yunnan Railway Company (WYRC), and Second Survey and Design Institute (SSDI) have had \nformal and informal consultations with local communities and relevant local government agencies through meetings, \nsurveys,  household  interviews,  written  communications,  and  workshops,  etc.  (Appendix  16).  Issues  discussed \nincluded  the  selection  of  the  line  route,  the  outlet  design  for  wastewater  discharge,  selection  of  water  source, \narrangement of borrow pits and spoil disposal sitting, and sand and stone supply. A change in the location of Lijiang \nstation is an example of public influence on the project design. Further public consultation occurred during various field \nsurveys.  Surveys  were  carried  out  among  local  residents,  other  stakeholders,  and  visiting  tourists.  Over  75  village \nsurveys and  800  households  surveys  were  conducted  for  the  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA),  poverty  and \nsocial assessment, ethnic minorities development plan (EMDP), and resettlement plan. The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) commissioned two supplementary studies to further assess the induced development impacts of the Project on \nthe environment and vulnerable ethnic minority groups. Disclosure procedures have been followed for all plans. MOR \nand ADB also held a consultation workshop in Dali city  to review the technical aspects of the Project, the draft final \nresettlement plan, EMDP, and summary EIA with provincial and local governments, county-level offices, relevant line \nagencies,  Yunnan-based  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  locally  affected  people. Participants from Dali, \nHeqing,  Lijiang,  and  Kunming  attended  the  workshop,  and  voiced  support  for  the  Project  based  on  the  benefits \nbrought  by  economic,  tourism,  and  natural  resource  development.  Discussions  were  held  on  induced  development \nimpacts, land acquisition, and resettlement impacts and compensation standards, migrant population impacts due to \ntourism, and the EMDP action plan. \n \nThe  participation  of  local  people  will  be  central  for  improving  their  opportunities  to  benefit  from  the  Project. Local \ngroups  and  relevant  government  agencies  continue  to  be  involved  in  the  consultation  and  participation  process, \nespecially during the implementation of the EIA, resettlement plan, and EMDP. Railway support offices exist in each \nproject county, and will have copies of all relevant documents. During construction and operation, they will serve as \nkey  coordinating  points  to  enhance  stakeholder  participation.    Relevant  line  agencies  will  also  help  support  the \nimplementation of the EIA, resettlement plan, and EMDP. \n\nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nDuring project preparation, analyses of sex-disaggregated data and discussions with representatives of the All-China \nWomen\u2019s  Federation  indicate  that  women  are  considered  vulnerable.  Data  collected  for  the  poverty  and  social \nassessment,  the  EMDP,  and  the  resettlement  plan  indicate  the  following:  (i) women  constitute  46%  of  the  total \npopulation in the project area; (ii) women primarily engage in agricultural activities; (iii) the female labor participation \nrate is high\u2014approximately 48%; and (iv)  male members from poor households tend to travel further for migrant labor \nopportunities  than  nonpoor  males,  leaving  behind  a  high  percentage  of  households  headed  by  women.  A \nrepresentative from Lijiang Women\u2019s Federation supported the Project for the additional opportunities it would bring to \nwomen.  For  instance,  the  construction  of  the  railway  would  create  opportunities  for  local  area  development  by \n(i) facilitating  flow  of  materials  and  information  into  the  area,  and  (ii) accelerating  development  of  local  industry\u2014\nprimarily agricultural and tourism.  \n \nPoverty  and  social  enhancement  measures  have  been  built  into  the  project  design,  and  special  mitigation  (or \nprotection)  actions  have  been  included  into  the  resettlement  plan  and  the  EMDP.  For  example,  members  of  the \ncommunity will collectively decide where schools will be relocated. Women, especially female heads of household, will \nbe consulted as schools provide an informal source of daycare for  their children. Widows will be eligible for special \nassistance, if necessary, during land acquisition and resettlement. Women will be given priority for project-generated \nemployment  during  construction  and  operation  of  the  railway,  including  afforestation  activities.  The  rise  in  female \nparticipation in the labor force and tourism market will increase women\u2019s net income, thus improving overall family \nwelfare,  and  increasing  the  status  of  women.  There  is  potential  for  adverse  impacts  on  the  Mosuo  minorities \u2014a \nmatriarchal society located in the BOA (Lugu lake in Ninglang) caused by excessive tourism development. However, \nthe local government and the Mosuo communities are already taking action to preserve their culture and tradition. This \nsensitive  situation  will  be  monitored  during  project  construction  to  ensure  actions  are  effective;  otherwise,  further \nmeasures would be required before the Project is completed.  \n\nHas an output been prepared? \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 18 \n\nE.

Special arrangements are provided in the resettlement \nplan  to  assist  in  the  restoration  of  incomes  of  vulnerable \npersons. Internal and external monitoring systems will be put \nin place. Upon ADB Board approval, the resettlement plan will \nbe put on the ADB web site in both Chinese and English. \nThe  proposed  railway  will  provide  efficient  and  low-cost \ntransportation for passengers and goods. It will connect to the \nexisting  Guangtong-Dali  Railway  and  Guangtong-Kunming \nrailway. It will improve traffic maneuverability, reduce transport \nconstraints and costs for passenger and freight services, and \nincrease railway efficiency. \nRailway  construction  and  measures  to  include  tourist-related \nconcessions  stalls  at  stations  will  generate  considerable \nemployment \nthe  project  area  during \nin \nconstruction. During operation, development of tourism sector \ncould  generate  additional  employment  opportunities  for  the \npoor  in  the  project  area  and  BOA.  Priority  for  construction-\nrelated jobs will be given to the poor, ethnic minorities, women \nand  other  vulnerable  groups,  including  resettlement-affected \npeople.  Local  agencies  will  assist  the  local  government  in \nidentifying these priority groups. \nIn  the  project  area,  about  73%  of  the  total  population  are \nethnic minorities \u2014the  largest  group  is  Bai,  followed  by  Naxi, \nYi,  and  others.  Enhancement  and  mitigation  measures  are \nincluded  in  the  EMDP.  Adverse  impacts  due  to  resettlement \nare addressed in the resettlement plan. In the BOA, there are \nmany additional ethnic groups including Zang (Tibetans), Lisu, \nPumi, Miao, and Mosuo. The impact of economic development \n(e.g.,  tourism)  on  ethnic  minorities  living  in  the  BOA  will  be \nmonitored during project implementation.  \nHIV/AIDS  Awareness  and  Prevention.  The  railway  will \nincrease the mobility of goods and people along the route, and \ncould  increase  the  potential  risks  of  HIV/AIDS  transmission \namong  mobile  populations  and  local  communities.  For  this \nreason,  the  health  unit  of  WYRC  will  coordinate  with \ncontractors,  local  departments  of  health,  and  other  relevant \nline  agencies \nin  delivering  HIV/AIDS  awareness  and \nprevention information. \n\n \n\nPlan \nRequired \n\n Full \n Short \n None  \n\n Yes \n  No \n\n Yes \n  No  \n\n Yes \n  No  \n\n Yes \n  No  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 1 September 2004) \n \n", "Currency Unit \nCNY1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "yuan (CNY) \n$0.1208 \nCNY8.277 \n", " \nThe  exchange  rate  of  the  yuan  is  determined  under  a  floating  exchange  rate  system.
