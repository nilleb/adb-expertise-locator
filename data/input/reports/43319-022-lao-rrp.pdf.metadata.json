This  is  one  of  three  projects  for  GMS \ncorridor towns; the others will be in Cambodia and Viet Nam.2\n \n \n2. \nThis  project  is  a  first  generation  intervention  of  a  long-term  engagement  in  towns  of  the \nGMS  economic  corridors,  and  is  aligned  with  the  strategic  framework  of  the  GMS  Economic \nCooperation Program, 2012\u20132022, approved by the Fourth GMS Summit on 19 to 20 December \n2011. 3 It  is  also  in  line  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country  partnership  strategy \n2012\u20132016 for the Lao PDR4 and supports ADB\u2019s urban operational plan (2012\u20132020) and water \noperational plan (2011\u20132020).5\n \n \nThe  project  will  enhance  the  competitiveness  of  towns  along  the  East\u2013West  Economic \n3. \nCorridor (EWEC), and will complement years of work on trade facilitation and cross-border trade \nagreements.6\n The project will transform the corridor towns of Kaysone Phomvihane, Phine, and \nDansavanh \ninfrastructure  and \ninto  economic  hubs  by \nstrengthening  the  institutional  capacity  of  provincial  and  local  authorities.  The  productivity  and \nsustainability of economic enterprises in these towns will be significantly improved, as the flood \ncontrol  measures  will  increase  climate  resilience.  The  environment  will  be  improved  through \nclean wastewater, disposal of solid waste, and enhanced mobility on improved urban roads. The \nproject will provide environmental infrastructure that will, among others, help reduce the carbon \nfootprint of the towns, making them cleaner and greener, and thus more livable. The project will \nfinance seven subprojects in the three towns.  \n \n\nimproving  urban  environmental \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nStrategic  economic  development.  The  government  and  ADB  place  considerable \n4. \nemphasis  on  developing  priority  transport  corridors  to  increase  physical  connectivity  between \nthe  GMS  countries  and  to  establish  the  foundation  for  more  efficient  movement  of  people, \ngoods,  and  services.  Towns  along  the  EWEC,  which  links  the  Lao  PDR  and  Viet  Nam  with \nThailand  and  Myanmar,  are  well  positioned  to  serve  as  dynamic  centers  of  investment  and \neconomic  growth.  The  strategic  location  of  the  corridor  towns  provides  the  stimulus  for \nincreased  trade  and  investments  along  the  transport  routes.  Access  to  infrastructure  and \nmarkets will provide many stimuli for the local economy and the hinterland of the corridor towns. \nGiven these development opportunities, and with the rapid growth of the urban population and \nexpansion  of  urban  areas,  several  corridor  towns  are  now  facing  demands  for  urban \ninfrastructure and essential support services. \n \n \n\n                                                \n1  Contributor: the Government of Sweden. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3   ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance.

The participating corridor towns in the Lao PDR now face the pressing \n5. \ntask  of  coping  with  the  demands  of  rapidly  growing  and  expanding  urban  areas.  Local \nauthorities want to plan and manage urban growth using an integrated approach, operate and \nmaintain  urban  environmental  and  economic  infrastructure,  and  efficiently  deliver  municipal \nservices. Despite policy reforms to promote decentralization, local institutional capacity has not \nkept  pace  with  urban  sector  development  and  economic  growth.  With  increasing  trade  and \ntraffic  flows,  the  capacity  of  the  corridor  towns  to  manage  local  economic  development  in  an \nenvironmentally sustainable manner urgently needs to be strengthened.7\n \n \n6. \nthe basis of their economic potential, infrastructure constraints, and expressed commitments. \n \nKaysone Phomvihane is a border town that serves as a (i) major commercial and service \n7. \ncenter; (ii) agricultural processing center; and (iii) emerging prime destination for manufacturing \nindustries,  business,  and  tourism.  Its  strategic  location  across  the  Mekong  River  Bridge  into \nThailand  offers  considerable  opportunities  for  increased  economic  activities  and  investments. \nWith  increasing  cross-border  trading  and  commercial  exchanges,  the  town  is  emerging  as  a \ndynamic economic center for public and private sector investments. \n \n8. \nPhine  is  a  market  town  located  at  an  important  road  junction  along  the  EWEC  with  a \nbypass  road  connecting  to  neighboring  towns  and  provinces.  Increasingly  the  town  center  is \ninvolved  in  trade  and  commercial  activities  for  goods  and  services  produced  in  Savannakhet \nprovince,  and  from  Thailand  and  Viet  Nam.  The  increasing  local  economic  activities  brought \nabout by the improved National Road 9 are stimulating the establishment of businesses. \n \n9. \nDansavanh,  a  town  bordering  Viet  Nam,  is  emerging  as  an  important  trading  center  in \nthe Sepone district. Its primary business is mining. Its strategic location along the EWEC made \nit  a  prime  location  for  the  newly  established  special  economic  zone.  Local  economic  activities \nare fostered by the presence of a dry port logistics facility, a public market, transport terminal, \nand duty free shopping at the border gate. \n \n10. \nRelated policies and strategies. The government has taken several initiatives to set up \nthe policy framework for urban development where district authorities would eventually take the \nmain  role  in  planning  and  implementation.  The  2010  National  Socio-Economic  Development \nPlan  (NSEDP)  provides  broad  economic  and  social  targets,  and  specific  proposals  for  urban \nsector  development.  Essential  measures for  economic  development  and  poverty  reduction  will \nbe pursued to reduce gaps between urban and rural areas and to make urban areas the focal \npoints for increased trade and investment. The strategic focus of infrastructure development will \nbe  EWEC  connectivity;  provision  of  urban  infrastructure;  and  construction  of  main  roads  in \ndistricts,  and  access  roads  that  link  rural  production  areas  to  urban  markets. The  government \nstrategy is reflected in ADB\u2019s urban development sector assessment, strategy, and road map.8\n \n \n11. \nLessons.  Major  lessons  from  completed  or  ongoing  ADB-financed  projects  in  urban \ndevelopment  include  (i) civic  participation  positively  affects  urban governance; (ii)  participatory \nand demand-driven development activities enhance the sense of local ownership; (iii) capacity \nbuilding  requires  proper  planning  and  up-front  implementation  as  it  is  a  long-term  effort;  \n(iv) institutional and policy reform should be based on realistic assessment of timing, resource \nrequirements,  and  political  will;  and  (v)  weak  performance  in  project  financial  cost  recovery \n\n                                                \n7   Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Water  Supply  and  Other  Municipal  Infrastructure  and  Services  (accessible  from \n\nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8  ADB. 2011. Urban Development Sector Assessment, Strategy, and Road Map. Manila (work-in-progress draft). \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fthreatens  sustainability, although  project  social  and  economic  benefits  are  exceptionally  high.9 \nThese  lessons  are  closely  linked  to  recommendations  of  ADB\u2019s  country  assistance  program \nevaluation  (2010),  which  stressed  the  need  for  environmental  and  social  safeguards  and \ncapacity  development.10 Project  preparation  involved  high  degree  of  social  participation.  The \nproject  has  a  strong  capacity  development  component,  and  a  business  plan  approach  to \nrevenue  collection  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M).  Further,  it  is  conscious  of  the  time \nand resources needed for institutional reform.11\n \n \nSpecial  features.  The  project  has  three  special  features:  (i)  as  a  first-generation \n12. \nintervention,  it  supports  regional  development  in  the  GMS  (and  the  Association  of  Southeast \nAsian  Nations)  by  creating  growth  engines  in  corridor  towns  across  the  GMS,  preparing  for \nfuture  fully  integrated  subregional  projects;  (ii)  it  provides  recycling  of  solid  waste  through \ninnovative materials recovery facilities (MRFs) for waste segregation, with cofinancing from the \nUEIF  under  the  Urban  Financing  Partnership  Facility;  and  (iii)  it  supports  increased \ndecentralization by strengthening provincial and district authorities.12\n \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n13. \nThe expected impact of the project is for the towns of Kaysone Phomvihane, Phine, and \nDansavanh to become centers of trade and investment in the EWEC, thereby contributing to the \ntransformation of transport corridors to economic corridors in the GMS. The expected outcome \nis  adequate  essential  urban  infrastructure  and  services  in  the  project  towns.  The  wastewater \ntreatment,  the  drainage  and  sewerage  systems,  and  the  river  embankment  protection \nsubprojects will contribute to increased climate resilience of the participating towns. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n14. \nThe  key  outputs  of  the  project  are  (i)  adoption  and  implementation  of  strategic  local \neconomic development plans, developed during ADB\u2019s project preparatory technical assistance \nfor  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  for  Preparing  the  Corridor  Towns  Development  Project \n(footnote 6), in the project towns; (ii) implementation of priority urban infrastructure investments; \nand  (iii)  strengthened  institutional  capacity  for  urban  development.  Identification  of  the  priority \nsubprojects for infrastructure investments was based on (i) consistency with the project\u2019s overall \ngoals  and  objectives;  (ii)  potential \nto  economic  growth  and \ncompetitiveness;  and  (iii)  expressed  interest  and  commitment  of  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works \nand Transport (MPWT), as the executing agency, to provide the necessary resources.  \n \n15. \nthe three corridor towns as outlined in Table 1. \n \n\nPriority  infrastructure.

The  project  will  provide \nproject management support and capacity development to MPWT and the department of public \nworks  and  transport  (DPWT).  This  will  help  to  ensure  that  project  implementation  will  fully \ncomply with ADB\u2019s policies and operational requirements in terms of procurement procedures, \nconstruction  supervision,  financial  management  and  disbursement,  social  and  environmental \nsafeguards, and O&M. Consulting services will be engaged for capacity building in these areas, \nand assisting in developing business plans for the O&M of urban services supported under the \nproject.  Financial  audit  and  monitoring  of  the  social  and  environmental  safeguards  will  be \nseparate  services.  MPWT  will  establish  close  links  with  the  executing  agencies  of  the  other \nGMS  corridor  towns  development  projects  in  Cambodia  and  Viet  Nam  (being  processed  for \napproval in December 2012) by sharing best practices in project implementation and monitoring \nof results.13\n \n \nD. \n \n17. \nprice contingencies (Table 2). \n \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $47.73 million, including taxes, duties, and physical and \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nTable 2: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n \n\nItem \nA.

The technical  and  engineering  designs,  including the O&M  plan,  are  based \non standard parameters to ensure long-term sustainability of infrastructure. \n \nThe  national  government,  through  the  7th  NSEDP,  envisions  strengthening  and \n24. \nexpanding local governance to promote local economic development and reduce poverty in the \ncountryside.  The  NSEDP  contains  essential  provisions  for  improved  public  administration, \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fenhanced  regional  integration,  sustainable  use  of  natural  resources,  and  infrastructure \nprovision.  The  urban  sector  strategies  are  intended  to  reduce  gaps  between  urban  and  rural \nareas  and  establish  urban  areas  as  the  focal  points  for  economic  development.  The  NSEDP \nrecognizes  the  weak  institutional  capacity  of  provincial  and  district  authorities  to  plan  and \nmanage  urban  sector  development,  implement  and  operate  urban  infrastructure,  and  deliver \nessential  urban  services.  The  project  will  provide  the  enabling  environment  for  strategic  local \neconomic development, infrastructure investments, and institutional capacity building. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n25. \nThe seven subprojects were subjected to economic analysis to determine their viability. \nIn  undertaking  the  analysis,  the  quantification  and  valuation  of  economic  benefits  varied \ndepending  on  the  nature  of  the  subproject.  Benefits  that  were  quantified  included  vehicle \noperating  costs  and  travel  time  for  the  urban  road  subprojects,  increase  in  land  value  for  the \ndrainage and embankment protection subprojects, economic efficiency of recovering recyclable \nand compostable solid waste and reduction in solid waste disposal cost for the MRF, and health \nbenefits  and  willingness  to  pay  for  wastewater  treatment  and  solid  waste  management.  The \nexpected  beneficiaries  of  the  overall  project  constitute  a  diverse  group,  including  road  users, \nbusinesses, tourism service providers, property owners, and households. The base case results \nindicate  all  components  are  economically  viable  with  an  estimated  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn exceeding the assumed economic opportunity cost of capital of 12%. Results range from \n12.3%  to  31.8%.  All  subprojects  are  generally  also  viable  under  adverse  scenarios  in  which \ncosts are higher or benefits lower by 10% than the base case.16\n \n \nThe  financial  analysis  of  the  three  towns  with  urban  road  subprojects,  the  provincial \n26. \nauthority has to provide funds to the provincial DPWT through annual budgetary allocations, to \ncover the required O&M costs and ensure project sustainability. The financial analysis focused \non historical  annual  budget  allocations  to  the  provincial  DPWT,  the  incremental  O&M  of  the \nthree  road  subprojects  was  not  significant  compared  with  previous  budgets.  The  wastewater \ntreatment,  solid  waste  management,  MRF,  and  Mekong  River  embankment  protection  are \nconsidered  revenue-generating,  thus  financial  internal  rates  of  return  consider  the  amount  of \nfees or income that can be generated from their operation. Resulting financial internal rates of \nreturn  ranged  from  4.3%  to  21.2%,  all  higher  than  the  computed  weighted  average  cost  of \ncapital.17\n \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nAn  assessment  of  the  financial  management  and  fund  disbursement  system  indicates \n27. \nthat MPWT has adhered to the transparency and accountability elements of good governance. \nThrough  direct  participation  and  involvement  in  undertaking  procurement  procedures  for  an \nADB-financed project, MPWT has developed the institutional capacity to undertake international \nand  national  competitive  bidding for civil  works. Capacity  development  and training  assistance \nwill  be  provided  to  MPWT  and  DPWT  on  financial  and  procurement  management  and  fund \ndisbursement.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed  with  the  government,  MPWT  and  DPWT.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  PAM  (footnote  12).  The  assessment  of \nprocurement  capacity  indicates  that  MPWT\u2019s  capacity  is  adequate;  however,  DPWT  requires \ntechnical assistance. \n \n\n                                                \n16 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n28. \nUrban  poverty.  Based  on  the  household  survey  and  the  urban  poverty  line  of \nKN240,000 ($30) per person per month, the proportion of poor in the participating towns is 23% \nin Kaysone Phomvihane, 31% in Dansavanh, and 37% in Phine. The poor are mostly living in \nareas  with  inadequate  running  water  supply,  wastewater  and  solid  waste  collection  and \ntreatment  services,  and  roads  and  drainage.  They  often  suffer  from  serious  water  supply \nshortages,  poor  water  quality,  wastewater  pollution,  and  poor  urban  environmental  sanitation. \nThey have less capacity to cope with pollution and degraded environments and, in turn, suffer \nfrom  increased  exposure  and risks  to  surface  and groundwater  and air pollution,  which  add  to \ntheir  poverty  situation. Through  implementation of the  subprojects, the  project  will  improve the \nliving  environment  and  health  status  of  urban  residents,  especially  of  the  poor,  and  create \nemployment opportunities.19\n \n \n29. \nGender  analysis.  Based  on  the  survey,  households  headed  by  women  account  for \n11%\u201333%  of  beneficiary  households.  The  subprojects  will  provide  benefits  to  women  as \nindividuals and as part of households. Improved drainage and wastewater treatment, and flood \ncontrol  will  reduce  flooding,  as  well  as  the  associated  physical  damage,  and  exposure  to \nwaterborne illnesses from overflow of drains, which often carry runoff and wastewater. Women \ncan benefit by eliminating the need for post-flood cleanup, which can be heavy work that takes \nthem  away  from  other  productive  activities,  and  reducing  exposure  to  waterborne  illnesses, \nwhich  decreases  the  need  to  care  for  sick  household  members  and  minimizes  women\u2019s  own \nexposure.  The  project  will  mitigate  any  negative  impacts.  The  gender  action  plan  includes \nmeasures  and  activities  that  will  enhance  the  benefits  to  women  through  participatory \ncommunity  development,  employment  during  construction,  improvements  in  sanitation  and \nhygiene, and awareness-raising programs. The design and monitoring framework and the PAM \ninclude gender-specific targets.20\n \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n30. \nEnvironment.  The project is under environment category B, as the subprojects are not \nexpected to cause irreversible adverse environment impacts. Initial environmental examinations \n(IEEs) 21  conducted  for  all  the  project  cities  (i)  identified  potential  impacts  and  mitigating \nmeasures to be implemented through environment management plans (EMPs), and (ii) included \ninputs  from  public  consultations.  Most  impacts  are  site-specific  and  mitigating  measures  are \nreadily available. Potential impacts can be mitigated with good construction practices outlined in \nthe  EMPs.22\n The  IEEs  are  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and \nthe  applicable  environment  regulations  of  the  government.  At  the detailed  design  stage,  when \nthe EMPs are updated, the final receiving environments for the wastewater treatment plants and \nlandfill will be reviewed to ensure that local groundwater and human uses of the affected areas \nare  not  adversely  affected.  Estimated  costs  for  implementing  the  EMP  are  integrated  in  the \nproject costs. The EMP will be finalized during the detailed design. The updated EMP, cleared \nby  ADB,  will  form  part  of  the  contract  bidding  documents.  The  adequate  incorporation  of \nenvironmental  considerations  during  design,  and  allocation  of  sufficient  budget  for  O&M  will \n                                                \n19 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21  Initial Environmental Examination: Kaysone Phomvihane, Phine, and Dansavanh Subprojects (accessible from the \n\nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n22  Initial  Environmental  Examination:  Environmental  Management  Plan  for  Kaysone  Phomvihane  Subproject;  Initial \nEnvironmental  Examination:  Environmental  Management  Plan  for  Phine  Subproject;  and  Initial  Environmental \nExamination:  Environmental  Management  Plan  for  Dansavanh  Subproject  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fmitigate  potential  adverse  impacts  during  operation.  Effective  environment  monitoring  at  all \nstages of the subproject implementation will be ensured. In compliance with ADB\u2019s information \ndisclosure  and  consultation  requirements,  the  safeguard  documents  will  be  posted  on  ADB\u2019s \nwebsite. \n \n31. \nLand  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  under  safeguard \ncategory  B  for  involuntary  resettlement.  Resettlement  plans  were  prepared  for  the  three \nsubprojects,  which  will  trigger  the  application  of  the  involuntary  resettlement  requirements  of \nADB's Safeguard Policy Statement.23\n Three due diligence studies were conducted and reports  \nprepared  for  subprojects  without  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts:  (i)  solid  waste \nmanagement in Kaysone Phomvihane, (ii) the MRF in Dansavanh, and (iii) the MRF in Phine. A \ntotal of 7.8 hectares will be acquired and 508 households (2,559 people) will be affected by the \nsubprojects. The  Kaysone  Phomvihane  subprojects  will  affect  290  households  (1,445  people), \nthe  Dansavanh  subproject  109  households  (506  people),  and \nthe  Phine  subproject  \n109  households  (608  people).  However,  only  2  affected  households  in  Dansavanh  require \nrelocation. All other impacts are partial and temporary. The cost is estimated to be $1.72 million, \nincluding  base  costs,  allowances,  and  contingencies.  Following  extensive  stakeholder \nconsultation  and  participation,  a  cutoff  date  for  inclusion  of  affected  households  was \nestablished.  Project \nto  affected  persons  throughout  project \npreparation and a project information booklet will be updated and distributed during the detailed \nmeasurement survey. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\ninformation  was  disclosed \n\nregulations. \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s \n\nIndigenous  peoples. The Lao PDR population includes 49 ethnic groups; the Lao\u2013Tai \n32. \nethnic groups make up the majority of the population. Based on the household survey data, Lao \naccount  for  98%  of  the  Kaysone  Phomvihane  population,  Phoutai  for  1.5%,  and  other  ethnic \ngroups  (Vietnamese,  Thai,  and  Chinese  migrants)  0.5%.  The  beneficiary  communities,  which \ninclude  non-Lao  ethnic  groups,  are  supportive  of  the  subprojects  and  see  clear  and  direct \nbenefits for themselves. The social assessment confirms that none of the subprojects will create \nadverse indigenous peoples impacts as per ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nResettlement  and  environment  documents  were  prepared  in  consultation  with  local \n33. \ncommunities and are in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and national laws \nand \ninformation  disclosure  and  consultation \nrequirements,  the  resettlement  plans  will  be  posted  on  the  ADB  website.  A  grievance  redress \nmechanism  will  help  facilitate  resolution  of  complaints  regarding  project  performance.  The \nresettlement  plans,  IEEs,  and  EMPs  will  be  updated  and  disclosed  after  detailed  design,  and \ncleared  by  ADB  prior  to  contract  awards.  The  project  is  under  category  C  for  indigenous \npeoples,  which  does  not  require  preparation  of  an  indigenous  peoples  development  plan.  A \nPMU will be established with a focal person on the environment and resettlement to coordinate \nand  implement  the  implementation  activities.  MPWT  will  engage  international  and  national \nconsultants  on  resettlement  and  environment  to  provide  management  support  during  project \nimplementation. \n \n34.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.24\n \n \n\n                                                \n23  Resettlement  Plan:  Kaysone  Phomvihane  Subproject;  Resettlement  Plan:  Phine  Subproject;  and  Resettlement \n\nPlan: Dansavanh Subproject (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n24 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nTowns are unable to collect revenues from \ninfrastructure services. \nUrban management practice does not fully support \ndecentralized operation and maintenance of \ninfrastructure. \nCorridor towns are unable to implement sound solid \nwaste management practices, such as segregation at \nsource.  \n\nLocal authorities do not have adequate budgetary \nresources for capacity development. \n\nQualified female staff cannot be engaged. \n\nDelayed or incomplete settlement of land acquisition \nand resettlement delay project implementation. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe provincial authority will pursue the establishment of \ndistrict authorities to collect fees and charges. \nThe project towns will introduce business plans and a cost-\nrecovery concept to service provision. \n\nProvincial and district officials will pass and strictly \nimplement the appropriate decrees requiring segregation at \nsource; segregated waste collection; banning of open \ndumping, waste burning, and littering. \nCapacity-building interventions and training programs will \nbe provided.
