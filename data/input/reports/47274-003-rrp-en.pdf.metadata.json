The \nreport  also  describes  (i)  the  proposed  administration  of  grants  to  be  provided  by  the  Global \nEnvironment  Facility  (GEF)  and  the  Urban  Climate  Change  Resilience Trust  Fund  (UCCRTF)1 \nunder  the  Urban  Financing  Partnership  Facility  (UFPF)  for  the  Secondary  Green  Cities \nDevelopment  Project,  and  (ii)  the  proposed  administration  of  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  be \nprovided by the GEF and the UCCRTF under the UFPF to the Government of Viet Nam for the \nMainstreaming  Climate  Resilience  and  Environmental  Protection  for  Secondary  Green  Cities \nDevelopment,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loans,  I,  acting  under  the  authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grants and TA. \n \n2. \nThe project will support environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive development in \nthe  cities  of  Vinh  Yen,  Hue,  and  Ha  Giang  in  Viet  Nam  to  enhance  their  economic \ncompetitiveness.  It  will  (i)  control  urban  storm  water runoff  and reduce flood risks,  (ii)  improve \nsanitation for  public  health,  (iii)  enhance green  landscaping  and public  amenities,  (iv)  upgrade \nurban road networks and their connectivity, and (v) promote public participation in planning. The \nproject will demonstrate green and climate-resilient development approaches that will be scaled \nup for nationwide secondary green city development in Viet Nam. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nDevelopment constraints. Because of rapid urbanization, 31.1 million people live in cities \nin Viet  Nam,  and they  contributed  about  70%  of  the  country\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  in 2015 \n($193.4 billion).2 Although a structural shift from agriculture to industry and services is driving Viet \nNam\u2019s rapid growth, the country\u2019s urbanization is uneven. Unlike the five centrally administered \ncities,  the  development  of  secondary  cities  is  lagging. 3  In  these  cities,  less  than  60%  of \nhouseholds  are  connected  to  the  water  supply  system,  only  10%  of  their  urban  wastewater  is \ntreated  by  a  centralized  system,  and  domestic  wastewater  treatment  relies  heavily  on  poorly \nmaintained household septic tanks. The lack of proper storm water management has reduced the \ncapacity  of  drainage  systems  and  causes  frequent  flooding.  Many  urban  road  networks  reach \ntheir  capacity  and  have  difficulty  accommodating  an  increasing  number  of  vehicles.  Climate \nchange  also  severely  impacts  secondary  cities.  By  2100,  a  projected  sea-level  rise  of  100 \ncentimeters  could flood a  40,000-square-kilometer  area  and  affect  9  million\u201311  million  people. \nMeanwhile, inland cities will suffer from lack of water resources because of the reduced annual \nflow  of  major  rivers.4 In  addition  to  the  government\u2019s  financial  decentralization  policy,  that  has \nreduced budget  transfers  to  secondary  cities5,  infrastructure development  in these cities relies \n                                                \n1  Financing partners are the Rockefeller Foundation and the governments of Switzerland and the United Kingdom. \n2  Government of Viet Nam, General Statistics Office of Viet Nam. 2016. Statistical Yearbook of Vietnam 2015. Ha Noi. \nIn 2015, Viet Nam has population of 91.7 million. Urbanization is increasing at a rate of 4.0% per year, much faster \nthan the national population growth rate of 1.1%. \n\n3  The five centrally administered cities are Can Tho, Da Nang, Hai Phong, Ha Noi, and Ho Chi Minh City. A secondary \n\ncity generally has a population of 50,000\u2013300,000. \n\n4  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2009.

Ho Chi Minh City. \n\n5  Because of the government\u2019s financial decentralization policy, many local governments have had to confront large \nfinancial deficits stemming from reduced fiscal budget transfers and limited sources of their own fiscal revenue. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nheavily on public investment as their limited size and coverage cannot support economies of scale \nor cost recovery. Yet, their weak institutional capacity to plan, design, and prioritize investments \nprevents the efficient use of public funds and application of innovative ideas. \n \nGovernment effort and challenges. Viet Nam\u2019s Socio-Economic Development Strategy, \n4. \n2011\u20132020  and  its  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan,  2016\u20132020  aim  to  sustain  economic \ngrowth rates while achieving social inclusiveness and environmental protection.6 This has led the \ngovernment to issue the specific sector policies\u2014the National Orientation Master Plan to 2025 \nand the National Program on Urban Development\u2014to guide efficient, sustainable, and equitable \nurbanization  in  the  future.7 However,  secondary  cities\u2019  slow  development  prevents  them  from \ncontributing  to  the  national  socioeconomic growth,  especially  by  (i)  providing  job  opportunities \nand livable environments for locals and migrant workers, and (ii) minimizing income disparities by \nsupporting the growth of middle-income groups. \n \n5. \nThe government requested assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which \nhas  been  supporting  the  comprehensive  basic  urban  infrastructure  development  in  secondary \ncities since 2003.8 ADB has found that responding to a city\u2019s complex socioeconomic and financial \nconstraints requires strategic support in upstream city planning and the identification of effective \ninvestments.  The  government  and  ADB  jointly  selected  Vinh  Yen,  Hue,  and  Ha  Giang  as \ndemonstration  cities  because \nrepresent  different  socioeconomic  characteristics, \ndevelopment constraints, and geographic locations. ADB supported the preparation of a GrEEEn \ncity  action  plan  (GCAP)  for  each  city,  which  piloted  an  integrated  planning  and  prioritized \ninvestment  approach  to  boost  their  economic  competitiveness,  while  incorporating  social \ninclusiveness, climate resilience, and environmental sustainability in infrastructure planning and \ndevelopment. 9 \n \n6. \nVinh Yen, the capital of Vinh Phuc province with a population of 105,800 as of 2016, is \none of the satellite cities forming the greater Ha Noi cluster. Because of its strategic location, the \ncity  is  experiencing  rapid  economic  growth  led  by  foreign  direct  investment  in  automobile \nmanufacturing.10 However,  Vinh  Yen  has failed to take full  advantage of  its  industrial  structure \nand provide a better quality of life for its people. The GCAP identified the following priorities: (i) \nregain  economic  competitiveness  by  linking  local  industries  to  emerging  opportunities  and \ndeveloping  academic  institutions  that  will  support  skilled  labor  to  attract  industries  that  will \ndiversify its value chain;11 (ii) expand the limited sanitation coverage and upgrade the combined \nsewerage system, which currently serves only 30% of households; and (iii) improve livability for \nthe  local  population  and  migrant  workers  by  increasing  public  green  spaces  from  4.8  square \nmeters per person to the government\u2019s target of 5.0\u20137.0 square meters per person. \n\nthey \n\n                                                \n6  Government of Viet Nam, Ministry of Planning and Investment. 2011.

The TA \napplied the GrEEEn city concept that enables cities to be  economically competitive, environmentally sustainable, \nsocially equitable, and resilient to climate change and natural disasters. The GCAP was agreed upon and published \nin 2014: ADB. 2014. Hue GrEEEn City Action Plan. Manila; ADB. 2014. Vinh Yen GrEEEn City Action Plan. Manila. \nADB provided project preparatory TA for the Secondary Cities Development Program (Green Cities) (TA 8671-VIE). \n\n10 In 2015, the per capita gross regional product in Vinh Phuc was $4,410. \n11 In Vinh Phuc, local industries support less than 10% of the automobile manufacturing supply chain. \n \n\n\f3 \n\nAs the capital of Thua Thien Hue province, Hue is a historic tourism city with a population \n7. \nof  355,095  (2016).  The  city  struggles  to  balance  historical  asset  conservation  and  urban \ndevelopment.12 Despite a rapid increase in the number of tourist arrivals, the provincial per capita \ngross regional product of about $1,881 remains lower than the national average.  Hue\u2019s GCAP \ntargets the continued development of the tourism industry, while ensuring better quality of life for \nlocal people, by (i) improving the environment in and around the Hue Citadel, where an insufficient \nwastewater and drainage system (only 30% coverage) causes frequent flooding; (ii) developing \na new urban area on the east bank of the Huong River to reduce development pressures on the \nhistorical conservation areas on the west bank; and (iii) mitigating the impacts of rapidly increasing \nroad traffic and fragmented road connections, as well as associated traffic safety concerns.  \n \n8. \nHa Giang, the capital of Ha Giang province with a population of 55,900 (2016), is on the \ncountry\u2019s northern border with the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) at the confluence of the Mien \nand Lo Rivers. The landlocked city remains economically isolated because it has not realized its \neconomic growth potential as a border city with the PRC.13 The GCAP proposes (i) constructing \nwastewater  and  drainage  systems  in  the  city  center  to  mitigate  seasonal  flooding  and  water \npollution;  (ii)  strengthening  the  river  embankment  against  erosion  and  annual  flooding,  which \ncauses an average economic loss of $0.6 million per year; and (iii) improving the capacity and \nconnectivity of the urban road network to support increasing cross-border trade with the PRC and \nmore  than  489,000  tourists  per  year  to  the  Dong  Van  Karst  Plateau,  a  member  of  the  United \nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization Global Geoparks Network. \n \n9. \nADB\u2019s value addition. ADB added value based on its lengthy experience in supporting \nsecondary cities in various geographic areas of Viet Nam. ADB\u2019s proposed solution builds on its \nknowledge work and addresses complex secondary city development issues through TA and loan \nprojects.  The  project  components  were  selected  based  on  ADB\u2019s  capacity  development  TA,14 \nwhich  conceptualized,  analyzed,  and  integrated  green  and  climate-resilient  development \napproaches in cities. Project preparatory TA15 refined the GCAPs and prioritized investment for \ncity development. Parallel with project implementation, the attached TA will leverage the project \nimpact  to  (i)  mainstream  green  and  climate-resilient  development  through  national  policy  and \nregulatory  reform,  (ii)  update  the  GCAPs  and  improve  project  cities\u2019  master  plans,  and  (iii) \nreplicate  the  approach  in  other  secondary  cities  in  Viet  Nam.  The  project  also  incorporates \nlessons from previous ADB projects in Viet Nam, including the need to (i) apply project readiness \nfilters  to  minimize  start-up  delays;  (ii)  show  strong  commitment  on  tariff  reform  to  recover \noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs,  and  ensure  the  financial  sustainability;  (iii)  promote \nprovincial government agencies\u2019 strong ownership and early involvement in project design and \nthe management; and (iv) provide loan and grant resources to operationalize a revolving fund.16 \n \n10. \nSpecial features and strategic fit. The project will help the three cities consider design \nalternatives  and  demonstrate  innovative  green  infrastructure  solutions  by  (i)  adopting  an \necological and climate-resilient design for embankments and urban drainage channels that will \nminimize concrete structures, balance engineering measures with river ecosystem conservation, \nand enhance public amenities; (ii) including green functions in road designs to allow water filtration \n\n                                                \n12 The Hue Citadel and other physical cultural resources were recognized as World Heritage sites in 1993. \n13 In 2015, the per capita gross regional product in Ha Giang province was $1,712. \n14 ADB. 2012.

In  Ha  Giang,  replacing  1,900 \nstreetlights with energy-efficient lighting will significantly change the ambience of the city center \nat night. Activities directly supporting communities vulnerable to climate risk in Hue and Vinh Yen \nwill enable the project to reach the people in need through a participatory approach. The attached \nTA will demonstrate an innovative financial mechanism for Hue to protect its infrastructure assets \nagainst  climate  change  and  disaster  risk.  The  project  aligns  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership \nstrategy, 2016\u20132020 for Viet Nam. It is also consistent with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy \n2020, Urban Operational Plan, and Environment Operational Directions as it promotes knowledge \nsolutions and the scaling up of climate adaptation, as well as competitive, inclusive, and green \ncity development and better quality of life through a climate-resilient city.17 \n \nB. \n \n11. \nThe project is aligned with the following impacts: improved efficiency, sustainability, and \nequitability of secondary cities development in Viet Nam (footnote 6). The project will have the \nfollowing  outcome:  strengthened  environmental  sustainability,  inclusiveness,  and  climate \nresilience of Vinh Yen, Hue, and Ha Giang.18 \n \nC. \n \n12. \nOutput 1: Green and resilient urban infrastructure services in Vinh Yen improved. \nThis subproject will have three components. The green and resilient urban space improvement \ncomponent  includes  (i)  a  new  wastewater  treatment  system  with  a  6,000-cubic-meter-per-day \nplant and 66.1 kilometers (km) of new and upgraded pipelines for drainage and pollution control, \n(ii) the dredging of the Dam Vac lake to increase its storm water retention capacity, (iii) 3.5 km of \nembankment protection and improved public access to the waterfront, and (iv) 44.5 hectares (ha) \nof  new  public  green  space.  The  competitive  city  development  component  will  finance  the \nconstruction of an industrial promotion and exhibition center to attract investments and a 5.6 km \nroad  connecting  the  city  center  to  the  developing  university  area.  The  green  flagship  grant \ncomponent includes (i) community-led activities for climate-vulnerable communities to enhance \ntheir  level  of  adaptation;  and  (ii)  establishment  of  a  government-managed  revolving  fund  to \npromote household connections to a project-financed centralized wastewater treatment system. \n \n13. \nOutput 2: Green and resilient urban infrastructure services in Hue improved. This \nsubproject will have three components. The green and resilient urban development component \nincludes (i)  improving  the  drainage capacity,  water  environment,  and  livability  of  the  inner  and \nsurrounding areas of the Citadel by upgrading 21.9 km of drainage pipelines, rehabilitating 15.9 \nkm of road surface and drainage, and dredging 6.2 ha of water-retention ponds; (ii) protecting 9.0 \nkm  of river  embankments  with  environment-friendly  materials  and improved  public  access; (iii) \nenhancing  17.2  ha  of  green  spaces  and  landscaping  for  public  amenities;  and  (iv)  extending \naccess to a clean water supply to the Phu Son communes through two booster pump stations, \n30.8 km of pipelines, and 469 household connections.

Of the GEF portion, \n$6,256,881 will come from the GEF Trust Fund and $4,566,210 from the GEF Special Climate Change Fund. The \nTA has four outputs, of which three will be administered by ADB and the one will be administered by MONRE. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fEconomic and Financial \n\nresulting in a stronger overall climate adaptation impact.22 The analysis confirmed the project is \ntechnically  viable  after  a  detailed  examination  of  compatibility  with  Viet  Nam\u2019s  engineering \nguidelines,  traffic  demand and urban storm  runoff  projections,  and wastewater  generation  and \nrequired treated effluent quality. An alternative analysis considered cost effectiveness (covering \noperating costs), the use of appropriate technology within operating agencies, and the reduction \nof  negative  social  and  environmental  impacts.  The  project  will  provide  training  to  ensure  the \nsustainable O&M of project facilities. \n \nB. \n \n22. \nEconomic  analysis.  An  economic  analysis  concluded  that  the  project  is  economically \nviable. Economic internal rates of return were computed at 16.7% for the overall project, 18.8% \nfor the Ha Giang subproject, 21.3% for the Hue subproject, and 9.2% for the Vinh Yen subproject. \nThe project\u2019s economic benefits include (i)  travel time and vehicle operation cost  savings from \nimproved roads and network connectivity, (ii) health-related expenditure savings from improved \nsanitation services, and (iii) higher revenue from tourism and business-related foreign travelers.23 \n \n23. \nFinancial  analysis.  A  financial  evaluation  of  the  only  revenue-generating  wastewater \ntreatment system in Vinh Yen indicated that the government will be unable to achieve full cost \nrecovery through wastewater tariff collection.24 The financial internal rate of return is \u20133.7%. The \nfinancial impact assessment for this component demonstrated that the Vinh Yen PPC and the city \npeople\u2019s  committee (CPC)  have  the financial  capacity  to  complete the  project  and  cover O&M \ncosts. The analysis indicated that the system will generate revenue from the projected wastewater \ntariffs to cover O&M costs. The financial impact assessment for the entire project ensured fiscal \nsustainability during implementation and operation until 2042. An assessment of the three PPCs\u2019 \nfinancial  capacity  indicated  that  annual  counterpart  funds  and  interest  during  construction  will \naccount for 0.1%\u20134.7% of the projected fiscal surplus, and debt service during operation will be \n0.1%\u20132.6%. The assessment also concluded that the Vinh Yen, Hue, and Ha Giang CPCs have \nthe capacity to finance O&M during operation. The fiscal impact of O&M costs on the CPCs\u2019 fiscal \nbudget  was  estimated  at  1.0%\u20134.6%,  indicating  sufficient  financial  capacity.  Loan  assurances \nmitigate fiscal risks with regard to the timely appropriation of counterpart funds, wastewater tariff \ncollection, and operational sustainability.25 \n \nC. \n \n24. \nAll  PPCs  have  experience  in  projects  funded  by  international  financial  institutions  and \nbilateral  development  partners.  They  will  supervise  the  implementing  agencies  under  the \nprovincial governments (Vinh Phuc and Thua Thien Hue) and the city government (Ha Giang). \nProcurement capacity assessments concluded that, with the agreed mitigation actions, the Vinh \nPhuc  Provincial  Foreign  Concessional  Loans  Project  Management  Office,  Thua  Thien  Hue \nDepartment of Planning and Investment, and Ha Giang CPC have adequate capacity to conduct \nprocurement activities following ADB guidelines. The financial management risk is substantial. A \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n22 These  include  (i)  a  proposed  provincial  flood  control  and  mitigation  project  funded  by  the  World  Bank  and  a \nwastewater treatment system funded by the Japan International Cooperation Agency in Vinh Yen; (ii) the construction \nof a wastewater treatment system in Hue, also funded by the  Japan International Cooperation Agency; and (iii) a \nproposed wastewater treatment system funded by Danish International Development Assistance in Ha Giang. \n\n23 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Government of Viet Nam. 2014. Decree on Water Drainage and Wastewater Treatment. Ha Noi (No. 80/2014/ND-\nCP). ADB and other international development partners recognize the difficulty of achieving full cost recovery in the \nwastewater subsector in Viet Nam. The recommended levels of wastewater tariff should recover O&M costs. \n\n25 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\ntime-bound action plan was agreed upon to mitigate risks through (i) loan covenants on the timely \nappropriation  of  counterpart  funds  and  anticorruption  measures,  (ii)  periodic  public  financial \nmanagement training, and (iii) the engagement of a qualified auditing firm. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and the \nPPCs. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM \n(footnote 19). \n \nD. \n \n25. \nThe project will benefit about 116,000 households (12,308 in Ha Giang, 78,417 in Hue, \nand 25,314 in Vinh Yen), including about 6,096 poor and near-poor households. The project is \nclassified as a targeted intervention (Sustainable Development Goals 6 and 11). Its social impact \nwill be positive and will improve the quality of life of the people in Vinh Yen, Hue, and Ha Giang. \nThe project will boost the resilience of vulnerable groups and reduce poverty through improved \naccess to climate-resilient urban infrastructure services. It will also enable community groups to \nparticipate in the GCAP planning, implementation, and monitoring. \n \n26. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  A  gender  assessment \nidentified low women\u2019s participation in public decision-making as a key gender issue. Impact and \nservice  disruptions  related  to  climate  change  directly  affect  women  as  they  have  primary \nresponsibility  for  household  and  community  water  supply  and  sanitation  management.  Poor \nsewerage and drainage heightens risks and flooding impacts, such as the disruption of work and \nlivelihoods resulting in loss of income, proportionately higher loss of assets and property among \nthe poor and households headed by women, and an increased risk of communicable diseases. \nThe  gender  action  plan  includes  (i)  strategies  to  promote  equal  opportunities  for  women  to \nparticipate in and benefit from the project, and to increase women\u2019s representation in decision-\nmaking; (ii) targets for women\u2019s participation in project management units (PMUs) and capacity \nbuilding  training  sessions;  and  (iii)  gender-responsive  and  pro-poor  principles  in  the  revised \nGCAPs and community-led activities. The PPCs will collect gender-disaggregated data to monitor \nprogress against the gender action plan. \n \nE. \n \n27. \ncategories are discussed in paras. 27\u201331.26 \n \nEnvironment (category  B). The  PPCs  conducted  an initial  environmental  examination \n28. \nfor  the three  cities  and uploaded  these to the  ADB  website in  May  2017.27 The most  sensitive \nsites are the lakes, rivers, and canals that will be dredged and/or whose banks will be stabilized. \nNo project component will encroach on legally protected sites.28 Construction impacts (including \ndust, noise, temporary deterioration of surface water quality, and traffic disturbance with impacts \non  community  safety)  will  be  temporary,  short-term,  and  likely  to  occur  during  the  peak \nconstruction period. The project is not anticipated to generate significant adverse environmental \nimpacts during operation. Cumulative greenhouse gas emissions from the project facilities will not \nexceed ADB\u2019s threshold of 100,000 tons per year. Mitigation measures for identified impacts are \nin the environmental management plans (EMPs), and adherence to the EMPs will reduce residual \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n26  ADB.

The  PPCs  held  formal  and  informal  focus  group  discussions  for \nstakeholder consultations and defined grievance redress mechanisms. \n \n29. \nThe  project\u2019s  climate  risk  without  mitigation  is  classified  as  medium.  Key  climate  risks \ninclude sea-level rise (Hue) and increased precipitation intensity and variability (all cities). The \nproject will significantly contribute to the cities\u2019 climate resilience by implementing the key climate \nresilience  priorities  in  the  GCAPs,  the  Vinh  Phuc  Climate  Action  Plan  (2015\u20132030),  and  the \nClimate  Action  Plan  for  Hue  City. 29 Community-led  activities  will  target  the  most  vulnerable \ncommunities in Hue and Vinh Yen. \n \nInvoluntary resettlement (category A). The project will acquire 58.4 ha of land, of which \n30. \n43.4 ha is agricultural. The project will affect 2,014 households (10,099 people) to varying degrees, \nwith land acquisition and house relocation significantly affecting 610 households (3,058 people). \nADB prepared two resettlement plans: one each for the Hue and Vinh Yen subprojects, and a \nresettlement and ethnic minority development plan (REMDP) for the Ha Giang subproject in line \nwith the Safeguard Policy Statement. The government approved and disclosed the plans to the \naffected people and uploaded them to the ADB website in May 2017. The PPCs will finalize the \nplans  based  on  the  detailed  measurement  survey  at  the  detailed  engineering  design  stage, \ndisclose them to the affected people, and submit them to ADB for approval. The PPCs will pay \ncompensation for lost assets and resettlement allowances to the affected people, and will arrange \nlivelihood rehabilitation in line with the resettlement plans and REMDP. Consultants will monitor \nand evaluate Implementation of the resettlement plans and REMDP internally and externally. The \nPMUs will have full-time land acquisition and resettlement staff who will support compliance with \nADB safeguard requirements. Monitoring and evaluation reports will be prepared semiannually \nduring implementation and annually for 2 years after resettlement completion in each subproject. \nThe project has set up a transparent grievance redress mechanism that will provide meaningful \nconsultation and trigger remedial action. \n \n31. \nIndigenous peoples (category B). In Ha Giang, ethnic minorities represent 41% of the \npopulation, mainly Tay (27%), Dao (6%), and Hoa (3%). While ethnic minorities in urban wards \nare  integrated  into  the  mainstream,  those  in  rural  communes  still  form  distinct  cultural  and \nlinguistic  communities,  and  their  poverty  rate  is  significantly  higher  than  that  of  their  urban \ncounterparts. The Ha Giang subproject will partially affect about 73 ethnic minorities. The REMDP \noutlining the issues and actions for ethnic minority integration for the Ha Giang subproject  has \nbeen approved and disclosed by Ha Giang CPC to the affected persons. It was uploaded to the \nADB website in May 2017. The project has no negative impact on Hue or Vinh Yen, which do not \nhave any concentrated area of ethnic minorities. \n \nF. \n \n32. \nThe  project\u2019s  overall  risk  is  moderate,  but tariff reform,  domestic resource mobilization, \nPMU staff capacity, and land acquisition and resettlement pose are substantial risks. Significant \nrisks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in  detail  in  the  risk \nassessment and risk management plan.30 \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\n                                                \n29 Vinh Phuc Department of Natural Resources and Environment. 2011.
