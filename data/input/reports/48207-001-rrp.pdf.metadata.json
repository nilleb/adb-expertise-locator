The  government\u2019s  priority  areas  include  the \nOJK  implementing  its  supervisory  mandate  over  the  bank  and  nonbank  sector  and  promoting \nfinancial  system  stability;  deepening  the  capital  market  and  the  nonbank  financial  sector  to \nprovide efficient means for the private sector to raise capital, including infrastructure financing; \nand  promoting  access  to  financial  services  by  poor  households  to  address  rising  income \ninequality in Indonesia.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nthe \n\nRationale \n\nlow  competitiveness  of \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nDevelopment problems. The Indonesian economy is at a crossroads. Economic growth \nhas steadily declined from 6.4% in 2010 to 4.7% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2015 and is \nprojected to grow  at  5.0%  in 2015, thereby  underperforming  its  regional  peers.2 This  is  mainly \nbecause the commodity price boom ended and macro policies were tightened to lower inflation, \ncurb  the  current  account  deficit,  and  stabilize  the  rupiah  exchange  rate. 3  The  economy  is \nexpected  to  pick  up  and  grow  at  5.6%  in  2016,  which  is  in  line  with  Indonesia's  estimated \npotential  economic  growth  rate  in  the  5.0%  range  (footnote  2) 4 While  the  sharp  decline  in \ncommodity prices is most likely cyclical, it has  exposed structural weaknesses in the economy \nincluding \nin \ninfrastructure.  Indonesia  needs  new  sources  of growth  to  meet  its  ambitious  economic  growth \ntarget  of  8.0%  by  2019.  This  requires  acceleration  in  public  and  private  infrastructure \ninvestments  to  improve  the  competitiveness  of  the  economy,  improvement  in  investment \nclimate, and increase in productivity. \n \n4. \nAgainst  this  backdrop  of  slower  economic  growth  and  structural  adjustment,  the \ngovernment is also challenged by a significant rise in household income inequality. Since 2010, \nIndonesia  has  experienced  one  of  the  largest  increases  in  inequality  of  all  Southeast  Asian \neconomies.  The  Gini  index,  which  represents  income  distribution,  and  is  commonly  used  to \nmeasure  inequality,  increased  from  0.38  in  2010  to  0.41  in  2013.5 A  sizeable  share  of  the \npopulation  is  excluded  from  the  financial  system,  which  deprives  the  poor  of  opportunities  to \nraise incomes through savings and pensions, and to mitigate financial risks arising from natural \ndisasters and economic shocks. With these development problems, a deep, liquid and efficient \nfinancial market is critical for promoting financial stability, new sources of economic growth, and \nfinancial inclusion.  \n\nthe  real  sector  and \n\ninvestments \n\ninadequate \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2  ADB. 2015. Asian Development Outlook 2015 Supplement. Manila \n3  Bank Indonesia increased BI rates to 7.75% in November 2014 after inflation peaked to above 8%.  \n4  International Monetary Fund Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n5  Statistics  are  based  on  the  Government  of  Indonesia\u2019s  Statistics  Office  http://www.bps.go.id/linkTabelStatis/view/ \n\nid/946 (accessed 20 July 2015). \n\n\fVulnerability  to  external  financial  shocks.  Indonesia  has  an  open  capital  account, \n5. \nforeign  holdings  of  bonds  and  equities  are  relatively  large  with  above  35%  for  local  currency \ngovernment  bonds.  This  makes  the  market  vulnerable  to  the  risk  of  sudden  capital  outflows.  \nIndonesia has experienced sharp reversals in capital flows from external shocks. For example, \nin  June  2013,  there  was  a  capital  outflow  of  IDR15.76  trillion  in  the  bond  market  with  foreign \ninvestors  as  net  sellers.  The  price  of  credit  default  swap  (CDS)  increased  by  almost  60  basis \npoints  (bps)  from  the  beginning  of  April  to  end  of  July  2013.  This  instability  resulted  in  higher \ncost of borrowing as the 10-year government bond yield increased by 225 bps during the same \nperiod  whereas  the  bond  markets  of  Malaysia  and  the  Philippines,  where  economic \nfundamentals  are  stronger,  have  shown  smaller  increases  in  bond  yields.6 As  of  July  2015, \nIndonesia\u2019s  5-year  CDS  spread  of  government  bonds  is  at  170  basis  points  per  annum \ncompared  with  90\u2013130  basis  points  for  Malaysia,  the  Philippines,  and  Thailand.7 Indonesia\u2019s \nhigher financial system risks transmit to higher cost of borrowing for domestic investors. \n \n6. \nUnderdeveloped  financial  sector  and  shallow  capital  market.  Indonesia\u2019s  financial \nsector  remains  small  compared  with  its  regional  peers.  In  2013,  financial  sector  assets  (bank \ncredit,  market  capitalization,  and  bonds)  represented  103%  to  gross  domestic  product  (GDP) \ncompared with about 194% for the Philippines, and over 300% of GDP for Malaysia, Singapore, \nand  Thailand.  Moreover,  financial  sector  assets  to  GDP  has  remained  relatively  constant  in \nIndonesia since  2010  indicating that financial  sector  deepening remains a challenge  since  the \nend of the global financial crisis (Figure 1). In the equity market, although the number of listed \ncompanies in the stock market increased to 506 in 2014 from 440 in 2011, market capitalization \nas a percentage of GDP in 2014 is below 50%, whereas Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n(ASEAN) comparators all exceeded 90% of their respective GDPs.  \n \n\n                  A.

Key  Indicators  for \nAsia and the Pacific 2014. Manila. \n \n7. \nIn debt securities markets, illiquidity is the major problem. The government bond market \nrepresents  only  13%  of  GDP,  compared  with  an  East  Asian  average  of  58%.  Turnover  in  the \nmarket  is  low,  and  bid-ask  spreads  have  been  steadily  widening  in  recent  years.  At  50  basis \npoints,  they  are  now  very  high  by  East  Asian  standards.  Corporate  bond  markets  face  similar \nproblems.  The  market  represents  just  2%  of  GDP,  compared  with  an  East  Asian  average  of \n21%, and the implied illiquidity is adversely affecting pricing. Recent issues at the popular three-\n                                                \n6  ADB.2013.Asia Bond Monitor September 2013.

Given that \nonly  high  quality  issuers  are  able  to  tap  the  market,  this  is  a  significant  margin.  The  key \nchallenge in this area is to create a more liquid and lower cost capital market. \n \nFinancial  exclusion  of  the  poor.  Financial  exclusion  is  a  development  problem  in \n8. \nIndonesia, related to an underdeveloped financial sector.  Only 21.9% of the poorest 40.0% of \nthe  Indonesian  population  has  savings  at  a  financial  institution.  Furthermore,  over  40%  of  the \npopulation does not borrow, with only 13.1% having borrowed from a financial institution.8 From \nthose who do not borrow, 60% said they are not considered creditworthy. This suggests that the \nfinancial services provided may not be suitable for all segments of society. In addition, while a \nsizeable  percentage  of  those  who  do  not  save  cited  lack  of  resources  and  employment  as \ncontributing factors, 7% said they either do not understand financial services or see no benefit in \nit.  Promoting  financial  inclusion  is  an  opportunity  to  address  this  development  problem,  as \nincreasing basic savings and investments\u2014especially among the poorest population\u2014can raise \nincome levels and reduce gaps in income distribution.  \n \nBinding constraints. Several key factors act as binding constraints to the development \n9. \nproblems  outlined  above.  For  financial  stability,  a  recurring  challenge  has  been  establishing \neffective  coordination  between  the  government  and  regulators,  and  among  financial  sector \nregulators.  This  impaired  information  sharing,  and  deterred  quick  and  coordinated  action  to \naddress  financial  stability  issues.  The  establishment  of  the  OJK  is  intended  to  address  these \ncoordination  and capacity  constraints.  However,  the  organization and supervisory  approach of \nOJK  mirrors  that  of  the  former  regulators.  In  addition,  the  capacity  of  the  regulators  of  each \nsector  is  uneven,  which  complicates  leveraging  cross-sector  knowledge  and  adopting  a  fully \nintegrated approach to supervision. For financial sector development, one of the major binding \nconstraints  is  the  lack  of  an  enabling  environment  that  is  conducive  to  financial  sector \ndevelopment.  This  includes  challenges  in  adopting  international  standards,  and  the  limited \ndiversity of saving and capital market instruments, including for hedging and market making. For \nincreasing  financial  inclusion,  key  constraints  include  the  low  access  to financial  services,  low \nlevel of financial literacy, and weak consumer protection. \n \n10. \nNational  Medium  Term  Development  Plan,  2015\u20132019.  The  government  has  set \ntargets  of  8.0%  GDP  growth  and  a  reduction  in  poverty  to  7.0%\u20138.0%  by  2019. 9  The \ngovernment  recognizes  that  promoting  financial  stability,  financial  market  development,  and \nimproving  access  to  financial  services  for  the  poor,  are  integral  to  meet  these  targets.  The \ngovernment  targets  the  size  of  the  financial  sector  growing  by  10.4%  per  annum  by  2019 \ncompared with 8.2% in 2014. The government also aims to provide access to financial services \nto 25% of the poorest 40% of the population by 2019. The government\u2019s strategy consists of a \nseries  of  reforms\u2014starting  with  implementing  OJK\u2019s  mandate  as  an  independent  and  unified \nregulator,  preparing  crisis  management  protocols  as  prerequisites  for  anchoring  financial \nstability,  followed  by  measures  to  develop  the  capital  markets,  and  a  stronger  focus  on \nimproving financial inclusion. ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2014\u20132016, is consistent \nand aligned with the government\u2019s medium-term development plan.10 \n \nADB\u2019s  value  added  in  financial  sector  development.

Country Operations Business Plan (2014-2016). Manila. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\ffinancial  sector  operations  in  Indonesia  since  1998  (Figure  2).  One  of  the  most  significant \nfinancial  sector reforms has  been  the  creation  of  OJK  as  a  unified  and  independent regulator. \nAlthough  there  is  no  consensus  on  the  regulatory  model  that  works  best  for  financial  sector \nregulators,  in  Indonesia,  a  unified  and  independent  regulatory  model  improves  coordination, \npromotes information sharing, and results in less political pressures. The establishment of OJK \ncan  be  traced  to  1999  when,  following  policy  dialogue  between  the  government  and  ADB, \nParliament passed the Banking Law to insulate the regulatory and supervisory framework from \npolitical  interference.  In  2000,  the  government  asked  ADB  to  support  the  development  of  a \nblueprint  for  an  integrated  financial  services  supervisory  institution.  ADB  responded  with  the \nFinancial  Governance  and  Social  Security  Reform  Program  of  2002,  supporting \nthe \nimplementation  of  nonbank  financial  sector  reform,  establishing  OJK  and  amending  relevant \nlaws  and  regulations.11 This  was  followed  by  ADB\u2019s  capital  market  development  program  and \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  grant  in  2007,  which  focused  on  strengthening  market  surveillance \nand investor protection.  Due to the 1997\u20131999 financial crisis and concerns about the transition \nfrom several regulators into one, the Parliament postponed the establishment of OJK from 2002 \nto 2010.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nFigure 2:  ADB\u2019s Long-Term Engagement with the Government on  \nFinancial Sector Development, 2002\u20132019 \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, FMDIP = Financial Market Development and Inclusion Program , \nNBFI = nonbank financial institution, OJK = Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (Financial Services Authority). \nSource:  Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n12. \nThe  OJK  Law  was  enacted  in  2011,  and  OJK  started  implementing  its  mandate  to \nregulate  the  capital  market  and  nonbank  financial  institutions  in  December  2012.  The  initial \nfocus on the capital market and nonbank financial institutions was supported by ADB\u2019s Financial \nMarket Development and Integration Program, approved in 2012, and associated TA projects.12 \nThe  post  program  partnership  framework  of  the  program  provided  ADB  with  a  structured \ndialogue from 2012 to 2015 that also helped inform the design of FMDIP. Through FMDIP, ADB \nwill focus on supporting (i) OJK to implement its mandate including developing the technical and \nregulatory  capacities  for  an  independent  and  unified  regulator  and  (ii)  government  to  develop \nand  coordinate  financial  sector  policies  including  on  financial  inclusion  through  the  Center  for \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2002.

Manila. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fFinancial Sector Policies. Lessons learned from ADB\u2019s previous operations  include (i) financial \nmarket  development  is  complex  and  involves  major  changes  to  the  legal  and  regulatory \nframework, institutional arrangements, and human capacity, hence has to be charted through a \nmedium  to  long-term  strategy;  (ii)  financial  sector  supervision  requires  strong  coordination \nbetween  regulator  and  government  and  is  best  achieved  through  consensus  building  and  an \nagreed financial  sector  master  plan;  and  (iii) while  capital  market  development  has  an  indirect \nlink  to  growth,  this  needs  to  be  coupled  with  reforms  to  increase  access  to  financial  services \nincluding  through  services  such  as  branchless  banking  to  improve  financial  inclusion  for  the \npoor.13 Recognizing these challenges, ADB coordinates with development partners including the \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  and  the  World  Bank.  Coordination  for  FMDIP  is  based  on  the \ngovernment\u2019s  process  through  the  Center  for  Financial  Sector  Policies.  ADB  provides  TA \nsupport  to  the  Center  together  with  the  Australia  Indonesia  Partnership  for  Economic \nGovernance, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund.  \n \n13. \nPolicy-based  loan  approach  and  budget  support.  The  proposed  programmatic \napproach and policy-based loan are selected over other financing modalities to chronologically \nsequence packaging of policy reforms, in a coherent yet flexible framework. This allows ADB to \nsupport and sustain the government\u2019s reform efforts including to improve financial inclusion in a \nsequential manner based on targets in its medium-term development plan.  \n \nKey Features of FMDIP. The program has three outputs critical to develop the financial \n14. \nsector and promote financial inclusion: (i) regulatory structure for financial stability strengthened, \n(ii) financial market deepened, and (iii) access to financial services enhanced. FMDIP consist of \nthree  subprograms  which  will  see  ADB  partnering  with  the  government  and  OJK  up  to  2019. \nThe focus of each subprogram is based on the government\u2019s priorities\u2014subprogram 1 focuses \non  OJK\u2019s  supervisory  mandate  and  increasing  its  capacities  to  function  effectively  as  an \nintegrated financial services regulator as a prerequisite for financial stability and financial market \ndevelopment, while subprograms 2 and 3 will increasingly focus on financial inclusion reforms. \nOJK has developed the National Strategy on Financial Literacy, which will be updated in 2016, \nand  the  government  is  finalizing  the  National  Strategy  on  Financial  Inclusion.  ADB  is  also \nsupporting  OJK  to  complete  a  sector  assessment  on  micro-finance.  These  strategies  will  be \nimplemented  during subprogram  2  (2015\u20132017). The program\u2019s three  outputs  are  expected to \nhave  positive,  economy-wide  effects  including  by  reducing  cost  of  borrowed  capital  and \ngenerating  wealth  for  those  excluded  from  the  financial  sector  (para  30).  A  capacity \ndevelopment national TA to support OJK and the government is being processed in parallel with \nthe  program.  This  support  is  supplemented  by  ADB\u2019s  regional  TA  on  ASEAN  capital  market \nintegration,  which  integrates  regional  collaboration  and  considerations  into  national  financial \nsector development.14 \n  \nB. \n \n15. \nThe  impact  of  FMDIP  is  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s  national  medium-term \ndevelopment plan and will contribute to increased growth rate of the size of the financial sector. \nThe outcome of FMDIP will be increased development and inclusiveness of the financial sector, \nmeasured by increase in the size of financial assets to GDP by 12 percentage points, increased \naccess to financial services for the poorest 40% of the population from 21.9% to 25.0%, and a \nreduction in 5-year credit default swap spreads by 20 basis points. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n                                                \n13 Additional  lessons  learned  provided  in  Assessment  of  ADB-Indonesia\u2019s  Financial  Sector  Programs  (2002-2014), \n\naccessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n\n14 ADB. 2015.Technical Assistance Report,  Enhancing ASEAN Capital Market Integration. Manila. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fOutputs  \n\nC. \n \n16. \nSubprogram  1  supports the government\u2019s  effort to  develop  the  financial  sector through \nthe  following  outputs:  (i)  regulatory  structure  for  financial  stability  strengthened;  (ii)  financial \nmarket  deepened;  and  (iii)  access  to  financial  services  enhanced.  The  government  began \nundertaking  reforms  in  all  three  outputs  from  January  2013,  and  all  23 policy  measures \n(including 12 policy triggers)  required for subprogram 1 have been fully achieved. \n \n\n1. \n\nOutput 1: Regulatory Structure for Financial Stability Strengthened \n\n \n17. \nSubprogram 1 supports the government in (i) establishing OJK\u2019s integrated supervisory \nframework  and  operations,  and  (ii)  strengthening  the  financial  sector  stability  coordination \nmechanism. \n \n18. \nFinancial  Services  Authority\u2019s  integrated  supervisory  framework  and  operations. \nThe OJK took over the banking supervision function from Bank Indonesia on 1 January 2014 \u2014\nthus becoming the unified regulator of all three financial sub-sectors. This transfer of mandate \nwas implemented on a systemic level by leveraging the existing information and communication \ntechnology  (ICT)  systems,  which  included  migrating  Bank  Indonesia\u2019s  bank  supervision  ICT \nsystems  to  OJK  premises.  ADB  supported  OJK  in  this  process  by  providing  support  for  the \ndevelopment  and  implementation  of  important  ICT  applications,  including  those  adopting  the \nextensible  Business  Reporting  Language.  OJK  also  approved  an  information  technology \nblueprint  as  a  medium-term  strategy  to  consolidate  the  regulatory  processes  of  the  different \nsectors using ICT systems. In addition, OJK identified priority areas for a consolidated financial \nsector master plan to succeed separate master plans for each sub-sector. Both the government \nand  OJK  also  took  important  steps  to  move  OJK  toward  partial  fiscal  independence.  The \ngovernment partially funded OJK during its transition period by allocating Rp2.4 trillion in 2014 \nand  approximately  Rp1.7  trillion  in  the  2015  national  budget.  OJK  implemented  a  web-based \nlevy on financial institutions and collected Rp 1.8 trillion in 2015. OJK intends to rely on fees for \nits operations in 2016 and be fiscally independent.  \n \n19. \nFinancial  sector  stability  coordination  mechanism.  The  government  and  OJK \nstrengthened  the  framework  for  financial  stability,  by  establishing  an  interagency  coordination \nmechanism  and  developing  crisis  management  protocol  in  OJK  and  across  government.  The \ngovernment,  via  the  Fiscal  Policy  Agency,  established the  Center for  Financial  Sector  Policies \nas  the  government\u2019s  main  cross-agency  coordination  mechanism.  The  government  and  OJK \nalso implemented a financial stability framework by conducting crisis management protocol tests \nthrough  the  Financial  Sector  Stability  Forum,  which  comprises  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  Bank \nIndonesia, OJK, and the Deposit Insurance Fund. The forum covers surveillance, exchange of \ninformation,  and  implementation  of  crisis  management  protocols.  OJK  also  approved  crisis \nmanagement indicators for each sub sector and implemented banking sector stress tests.  \n \n\n2. \n\nOutput 2: Financial Market Deepened \n\n \nDevelopment  of  a  deeper  and  diversified  financial  sector  complements  efforts  to \n20. \nincrease  stability,  and  provides  long-term  financing  for  needed  infrastructure.  International \nexperience shows that deepening the financial market requires addressing domestic constraints \nbased  on  international  best  practice.  Subprogram  1  supports  the  government  and  OJK  in \n(i) adopting international standards, and (ii) enhancing the enabling environment of the sector.  \n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fInternational  standards  adopted  by  the  Financial  Services  Authority.  OJK\u2019s \n21. \ncommitment  to  adopt  international  standards  and  promote  regional  integration  to  deepen  its \nfinancial sector is clearly demonstrated by its adoption of both international best practices  and \nASEAN  standards.  For  capital  markets,  OJK  completed  all  legal  requirements  and  signed \nAnnex A of the International Organization of Securities Commissions\u2019 Multilateral Memorandum \nof Understanding Concerning Consultation and Cooperation and the Exchange of Information in \n2014. In the same year, OJK joined the Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB)\u2014the standard-\nsetting body for Islamic banking, capital market, and takaful (insurance based on Islamic finance \nprinciples)  As  a  sign  of  its  commitment,  OJK  adopted  IFSB  15  (Revised  Capital  Adequacy \nStandard for Institutions Offering Islamic Financial Services) in June 2015. In ASEAN, OJK has \nbeen an active participant in the initiatives of the ASEAN Capital Markets Forum. To strengthen \nits  corporate  governance  framework  for  publicly  listed  companies,  OJK  adopted  the  ASEAN \nCorporate  Governance  Scorecard,  launched  Indonesia\u2019s  Corporate  Governance  Roadmap  for \nPublicly Listed Companies, and issued corporate governance regulations.   \n \n22. \nEnabling environment for financial market enhanced. The government improved the \nenabling  environment for financial  market  development  by  diversifying  capital  market  products \non the supply side and reforming the contractual savings sector (insurance and pension) on the \ndemand  side.  To  increase  market  liquidity,  OJK  introduced  the  global  master  repurchase \nagreement to facilitate market-making and hedging. This is expected to increase market-making \nand  allow  hedging  of  capital  market  instruments.  Reforms  were  also  made  to  diversify  capital \nmarket  instruments  through  the  development  of  Islamic  capital  market.  OJK  revised  rules \nregarding  the  issuance  of  Islamic  capital  market  products  including  clarifying  the  underlying \nassets of sukuk and the use of sukuk proceeds.15 On the demand side, the government enacted \nthe  Law  on  Insurance,  2014,  which  enhanced  policy  holder  protection,  strengthened  OJK\u2019s \noversight and range of administrative sanctions.  \n \n\n3. \n\nOutput 3: Access to Financial Services Enhanced \n\n \n23. \nFor  financial  sector  development  to  benefit  different  segments  of  society,  it  must  be \naccompanied  by  financial  inclusion  and  literacy  initiatives.  Consumer  protection  is  also \nimportant,  as  the  impact  of  fraud  or  misappropriation  of  funds  can  be  greater  on  the  poor \nbecause  of  their  limited  resources.  Subprogram  1  supports  the  government  and  OJK  in  \n(i) broadening financial inclusion and literacy, and (ii) strengthening consumer protection. \n \n24. \nFinancial  inclusion  and  literacy  broadened.  The  government  and  OJK  plan  to \ndevelop the financial market for all segments of society, including the poor and disenfranchised \ngroups  of  the  community,  through  a  coordinated  financial  inclusion  and  financial  literacy \nprogram.  The  government  enacted  the  Law  on  Microfinance  Institutions  in  2015,  and  OJK \nsigned  memorandums  of  understanding  with  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  and  the  Ministry  of \nCooperatives to coordinate and promote financial services at  the national and local level. OJK \nalso  launched  a  branchless  banking  initiative,  which  allows  registered  agents  to  offer  basic \nbanking  services  to  areas  without  a  commercial  bank  presence.  Services  covered  under  this \ninitiative  include  basic  savings  accounts,  micro-credit,  and  micro-insurance\u2014targeted  at  the \nunbanked and those excluded from financial services. OJK has also undertaken key reforms in \nfinancial literacy. It launched the National Strategy on Financial Literacy and rolled out literacy \nprograms in 24 cities in 2014.  \n \n\n                                                \n15 Sukuk is a capital raising instrument that provides undivided ownership over underlying assets. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fConsumer  protection \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\nframework  enhanced.  OJK  has  strengthened \n\ninvestor \n25. \nconfidence by enhancing consumer protection mechanisms for retail investors. This is important \nfor  market  integrity  and  to  encourage  more  domestic  investment.  OJK  launched  the  Financial \nCustomer  Care  initiative  in  2014,  which  consists  of  an  information  submission  service, \ninformation  request  service,  and  complaint  handling  service.  By  the  end  of  2014,  OJK  had \nreceived 27,000 requests, with about 10% involving disputes over insurance claims and leasing \ncompany  transactions.  OJK  also  authorized  the  establishment  of  the  Securities  Investor \nProtection Fund, with an initial size of Rp45 billion to provide assurances against investor losses \nresulting  from  fraud  or  misappropriation  of  funds.  In  February  2015,  the  total  fund  size  was \nRp93 billion\u2014more than double its original amount. \n \n26. \nTriggers for subprograms 2 and 3. ADB has agreed with the government and OJK on \n26  indicative  policy  actions  for  subprogram  2  to  be  completed  by  2017,  including  seven \nindicative  triggers  considered  important  to  the  success  of  the  program.  Triggers  include  the \nlaunch  of  a  consolidated  financial  sector  road  map  which  includes  financial  inclusion  and  the \nestablishment of the international learning center for microfinance. Indicative actions have been \nincluded  for  subprogram  3,  and  triggers  will  be  identified  after  OJK\u2019s  consolidated  financial \nsector  road  map  has  been  approved.  A  medium-term  framework,  which  includes  anticipated \nachievements, is included in the policy matrix. \n \nD. \n \n27. \nTo support its reform initiatives, the government has requested a single-tranche loan of \n$400,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance subprogram 1. The loan will \nhave a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the \ndraft  loan  agreement.  Based  on  this,  the  average  loan  maturity  is  12.1  years  and  no  maturity \npremium  is  payable  to  ADB.  The  government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its \ndecision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  based  on  these  terms  and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade  in  reliance  on  any  advice  from  ADB.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full \nforeign  exchange  cost  (excluding  local  taxes  and  duties)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in \nADB member countries, excluding ineligible items and imports listed in the negative list attached \nto  the  loan  agreement.  The  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nsimplification  of  disbursement  procedures  and  related  requirements  for  policy-based  loans.16 \nThe government has requested for disbursement in the fourth quarter of 2015.  \n \n28. \nThe size of the program loan is based on (i) the importance of the sector to the economy \nand the weight of the benefits of the reform program, (ii) the need to conform to government\u2019s \nfinancing requirement,  and  (iii)  development  expenditure  supported  by  the program.  Based  on \nthe  2015  revised  budget,  the  government\u2019s  net  development  financing  needs  are  $40.6  billion \n(deficit  plus debt  and  non-debt  payments). Overseas  development  assistance loans contribute \n$3.9 billion to the amount. With a larger deficit expected as a result of slower economic growth \nand continued volatility in the financial market, the government has requested additional budget \nfinancing  from  development  partners.  The  government  has  received  financing  commitment  of \n$3.2  billion  from  various  partners.  The  program  supports  reforms,  including  the  budget \nallocation to OJK (para 30).   \n \n\n                                                \n16  ADB. 1998.

The Fiscal Policy Agency in the Ministry \nof  Finance  (MOF)  is  the  executing  agency  while  OJK  is  the  implementing  agency.  The \nexecuting and implementing agencies are responsible for implementation of FMDIP. The Center \nfor Financial Sector Policies, which has been set up within MOF will monitor the implementation \nof the policy actions under the Policy Matrix. It will coordinate with the International Department \nwithin OJK in undertaking this task. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic and Financial  \n\n \nA. \n \n30. \nThe program\u2019s three outputs will have positive, economy-wide effects as detailed in the \nProgram Impact Assessment.17 The first involves the modernization of structures for supervising \nfinancial  institutions,  particularly  the formation  of the  new  independent financial  regulator.  This \nconsolidation,  coupled  with  a  stronger  commitment  to  financial  stability  mechanisms,  should \nreduce the cost  of  borrowed  capital  by  enhancing  perceptions  of Indonesia\u2019s  creditworthiness. \nThe  second  output  aligns  Indonesia\u2019s  regulations  with  international  standards  and  improves \ngovernance  standards.  Capital  inflows  from  abroad  will  likely  become  cheaper  in  each  of  the \naffected  areas,  and  rising  levels  of  liquidity\u2014particularly  in  interbank  markets\u2014will  improve \nbank efficiency and lower borrowing costs. The final output extends gains from financial reform \nto  the  wider  population.  The  government  is  targeting  higher  levels  of  financial  literacy,  more \nefficient  distribution  channels  for  financial  products,  and  a  stronger  microfinance  sector.  The \nbenefits  of  FMDIP  are  estimated  to  be  around  $403  million  per  annum.  $246  million  is \ncalculated to flow from a reduction in the cost of borrowing in the bond markets. A further $65 \nmillion  follows  from  longer  run  improvements  in  liquidity  management,  and  $92  million  could \nfollow from a greater degree of financial inclusion. Cost of reforms involve the improvement of \nprocesses  and  systems,  as  well  as  incremental  spend  on  headcount.  Most  fixed  costs  are \ngenerated  in Output  1  and  are  associated  with  the  creation  of  OJK  estimated  at  $316  million. \nThe  program  imposes  relatively  fewer  costs  in  terms  of  fiscal  redistribution  or  dislocation  of \nexisting  enterprises. These estimated  benefits  relative to the  cost  of the program  demonstrate \nthe value of the reforms under FMDIP. \n \nB. \n \n31 \nSteady  progress  in  strengthening  public  financial  management.  The  Government \nFinancial  Management  and  Revenue  Administration  Project,  has  been  under  implementation \nsince  2004.  The  project  supports  reforms  aimed  at  strengthening  efficiency,  governance,  and \naccountability  in  public  financial  management  (PFM),  especially  in  budget  execution,  together \nwith  treasury  modernization  and  revenue  administration.  In  addition,  the  government\u2019s  2012 \nmedium-term strategy note seeks to improve PFM reform oversight, including strengthening the \nprocess  of  allocating  budget  resources of  priority  sectors,  linking  planning  and budgeting,  and \nstrengthening  the  results  orientation  of  the  budget.  PFM  reforms  are  also  increasingly  aligned \nwith the priorities identified in Indonesia\u2019s medium-term development plan. \n \n\nGovernance  \n\n                                                \n17 The anticipated cost and benefit per output is in the Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards  \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nC. \n \n32. \nOnly 21.9% of Indonesia\u2019s poorest 40.0% have access to formal financial services, and \nover 40% of the population does not borrow, with only 13.1% having borrowed from a financial \ninstitution.  The  program  is  classified  as  a  general  intervention  as  its  proposed  outputs  will \nbenefit  all  citizens,  including  the  poor.  The  program  will  help  to  provide  more  equitable  and \ninclusive growth for the economy, and will specifically benefit the poor through the third  output \nwhich  enhances  access  to  financial  services.  Subprogram  1  is  classified  as  no  gender \nelements,  but  the  approach  is  to  discuss  with  the  government  and  OJK  to  focus  on  providing \naccess to financial services for women in subprograms 2 and 3.   \n \nD. \n \n33. \ncategory C for impacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \nE. \n \n34. \nThe  program  faces  three  main  risks  (i)  capacity  of  government  and  OJK  (high);  \n(ii) macroeconomic stability (medium), and (iii) coordination for financial sector reform (medium). \nMitigation measures include (i) TA to support the Center Financial Sector Policies (The Center) \nand  OJK  supplemented  by  regional  TAs  and  (ii)  coordination  through  the  Center  and \ninternational department of OJK. The risk assessment for FMDIP is medium.18 \n \n\nThe  program  does  not  trigger  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies  and  is  classified  under \n\nRisk and Mitigating Measures \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\n \n35. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of subprogram 1 shall conform to \nall  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting services,  and  disbursement as described in detail  in the  loan \ndocuments. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n36. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  programmatic  approach  and  policy-based  loan  would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend \nthat the Board approve \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe programmatic approach for the Financial Market Development and Inclusion \nProgram, and \nthe  loan  of  $400,000,000  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  subprogram  1  of  the \nFinancial  Market  Development  and  Inclusion  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  for  a  term  of \n15 years,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan \nagreement presented to the Board.   \n\n7 August 2015 \n\n                                                \n18 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fImpact the Program is aligned with: \nIncreased annual growth rate of financial sector (National Medium-Term Development Plan, 2015\u20132019) \n\n \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \n \nDevelopment and \ninclusiveness of the \nfinancial sector \nincreased \n\nOutputs \n \n1.Regulatory \nstructure for financial \nstability strengthened \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nPerformance Indicators \nwith Targets and Baselines \nBy 2020 \n \na.
