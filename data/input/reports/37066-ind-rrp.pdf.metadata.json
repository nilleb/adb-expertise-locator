Initial  environmental  examinations  were  undertaken \nand a summary is attached (Appendix 8).  \n \nAs one of the key features of the Government\u2019s poverty reduction \nagenda  for  the  rural  sector,  the  Government  is  implementing  a \nnation-wide rural road investment program, Pradhan Mantri Gram \nSadak  Yojana  (PMGSY).  PMGSY  aims  to  provide  all-weather \nroad connectivity to currently unserved habitations in India\u2019s rural \nareas, where 70% of the population live. PMGSY is in its fifth year \nthrough \nof \nparticipating states, 66,000 kilometers (km) of rural roads with an \nadditional  47,000  km  nearing  completion,  connecting  34,000 \nhabitations (20% of eligible habitations under PMGSY) nationwide \nto a greater transportation network.  \n \nPMGSY  also  includes  noninvestment  interventions  to  strengthen \nthe capacity of state level agencies for the implementation of the \nprogram in the area of project planning and design, management \noversight for construction activities, safeguards, procurement and \nfiduciary arrangements.  \n \nThe latest estimate for the overall PMGSY financing requirement \nis about $30 billion. Currently available financing sources include \na  portion  of  the  excise  tax  (cess)  on  high-speed  diesel  oil  ($0.9 \nbillion annually), ADB ($0.4 billion committed under the first loan), \nand  the  World  Bank  ($0.4  billion  under  its  first  loan-credit).  The \nfinancing gap is huge. While exploring the possibilities of domestic \nborrowing, the Government approached ADB and World Bank for \nadditional financial assistance.  \n \nADB has been requested to provide assistance to the Investment \nProgram through a multitranche financing facility (MFF). The MFF \nis most appropriate in this instance. The Government has a well-\ndefined  program  with  clear  program  goals,  well-structured \nstandard  operating  procedures  based  on  an  annual  program \nimplementation  cycle,  and  the  long-term  need  for  co-financing. \nInvolvement of multiple state level agencies with different levels of \nabsorption  capacity  will  require  flexible  financing arrangements \n\n\fMultitranche Financing \nFacility \n\nii \n\n \n\n \n\n \nRationale \n\nfor \n\nflexible \n\nthe  other \n\nthat  allow  fund  allocation  on  the  basis  of  progress  achieved  and \nreadiness for new investment in each participating state. The MFF \ncaters  well  to  these  two  sets  of  needs:  one  for  predictable \nfinancing  sources,  and \nfinancing \narrangements. \n \nThe  Investment  Program  is  expected  to  construct  or  upgrade \nabout  30,000  km  of  rural  roads  connecting  about  19,000 \nhabitations.  For  the  investments  in  physical  infrastructure  to  be \neffective,  the  Investment  Program  will  also  focus  on  capacity \nbuilding,  especially  in  relation  to  planning,  design,  operation, \nsafeguard, financial, road safety, and maintenance matters. \n \nThe financing plan for the Investment Program currently includes \nADB and the cess proceeds allocated to the Investment Program \nstates.  \n \nThe Government asked ADB to extend financing through an MFF. \nThe requested MFF is for $750 million over 5 years. It represents \n36%  of  the  total  financing  plan  for  the  identified  Investment \nProgram.  The  MFF  has  a  maximum  utilization  period  of  5  years. \nIndividual  and  periodic  financing  requests  will  be  converted  into \nindividual or separate loans.  \n \nThe  Government  has  entered  into  a  Framework  Financing \nAgreement  (FFA)  with  ADB.  The  FFA  satisfies  the  requirements \nset  forth  in  Appendix  4  of  the  Pilot  Financing  Instruments  and \nModalities.  Pursuant  to  the  FFA,  the  Government  has  submitted \nto ADB the first Periodic Financing Request (PFR) in the amount \nof $100 million. The first PFR is presented to the Board together \nwith the FFA. \n \nPrior  to  ADB  acceptance  of  a  PFR,  ADB  will  ensure  that  the \nGovernment  and  the  participating  states  comply  in  full  with  the \nterms  and  conditions  of  the  FFA.  ADB  teams  will  conduct  due \ndiligence  on  these  to  ensure  that  they  are  being  satisfactorily \nadhered to. The minimum loan size will be $30 million.  \n \nPoor road infrastructure affects economic growth in rural areas. It \nimpacts  negatively  on  domestic  and  local  trade,  on  the  final  cost \nof  goods,  competition  and  competitiveness,  logistics  in  general, \nmovement  of  people, \ninvestment  opportunities,  and \nultimately  on  employment.  Poor  road  connectivity  has  a  strong \nlink to poverty. Past neglect of the rural road network has cut off \nrural  communities  from  mainstream  economic  centers  in  the \ncountry  and  even  locally.  Poor connectivity has resulted in slow \ndevelopment,  and in some cases a faster  than needed exodus of \n\ninward \n\n\f \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n \nMultitranche Financing \nFacility Amount and \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization  \n\n \n\niii\n\nyoung  people  to  cities.  The  Government  is  trying  to  redress  this \nproblem under PMGSY. Assam, Orissa, and West Bengal, which \nare  first  targeted  under  the  Investment  Program,  are  among  the \n10 states with large rural populations that lack adequate coverage \nin terms of all-weather road connectivity. The poverty head count \nrates in these states are among the highest in India.  \n \nThe overall objective of the Investment Program is to help reduce \npoverty  and  deprivation,  and  support  economic  growth  of  rural \ncommunities in India by providing them with enhanced access to \nmarkets; employment opportunities; and social services, including \nhealth  and  education.  The  immediate  output\u2014better  and  more \nefficient physical infrastructure\u2014will lead to improved connectivity \nbetween rural and urban communities, and through this, to greater \naccess  to  markets  and  economic  activity  in  general.  Improved \nconnectivity  will  reduce  the  cost  of  final  goods,  entice  inward \ninvestment, and create and keep jobs in rural areas. Infrastructure \ncontributes  to  poverty  reduction  and  better  living  standards.  The \nrural  sector  will  remain  the  mainstay  of  the  economy  in  many \nstates.  \n \nThe total cost of the Investment Program for the selected states is \nestimated to be about $2.1 billion. \n \n\n($ million) \n\nPercent \n\n36 \n64 \n100 \n\nTotal \n750.0 \n1,350.0 \n2,100.0 \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \n \nTotal \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nAn MFF of up to $750 million from the ordinary capital resources \nof  ADB  will  be  provided.  Final  terms  and  conditions  will  be \ndetermined  in  the  context  of  each  individual  loan,  and  be  based \non  prevailing  policies  within  ADB.  Financing  that  will  be  made \nin \navailable  will  be  subject \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased facility. The Government has the option to choose between \neligible  currencies  and  the  interest  rate  regime  most  suitable  for \neach  individual  loan.  ADB  also  provides  flexibility  in  terms  of \nrepayment  and  interest  swaps  during  the  financing  period. \nRepayment schedules can be structured for each individual loan, \nin essence to match the needs of each batch of subprojects with \ntheir cost recovery and sustainability profile.  \n \nEnd  March  2009.

The \nNRRDA will be responsible on a day-to-day basis for supervision \nof  the  Investment  Program.  At  the  state  level,  the  implementing \nagencies  will  be  the  state  rural  road  development  agencies \n(SRRDAs). Each is run by a chief executive officer, supported by \nsuitably qualified technical, legal, financial, and other professional \nand  administrative  staff.  Consulting  services  will  be  provided  for \nsubproject design and execution tasks. \n \nAll goods and services to be financed by the loans to be provided \nunder  the  MFF  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  All  civil  works  contract  packages \nunder  the  individual  loans  will  be  procured  following  PMGSY\u2019s \nstandard  competitive  bidding  procedures  found  acceptable  to \nADB.   \n \nAll consulting services to be financed by the loans under the MFF \nwill be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of domestic consultants.  \n \nImproving  rural  connectivity  is  a  priority  in  the  selected  states. \nEconomic  activity  is  constrained  if  the  movement  of  people, \ngoods,  and  services  is  constrained.  Many  communities  in  the \ntarget  states  have  been  isolated  for  years.  Infrastructure  road \nfacilities  require  rehabilitation.  Although  the  program  focuses  on \nnew  infrastructure,  part  of  the  investments  will  also  improve \nexisting  networks.  This  approach  arrests  the  depreciation  of \nfundamentally  sound  assets,  but  also  delivers  economies  of \nscale\u2014rehabilitation costs will decrease if the contracts are mixed \nwith the construction of new assets.  \n \nThe  Investment  Program  will  contribute  to  the  economic  well-\nbeing  of  rural  communities  in  the  selected  states,  and  thus \npoverty  reduction.  Agriculture  will  benefit.  Agricultural \ninput \ndistribution will be easier, but so will the dispatch of final products \nto market. Other things being equal, the cost of distributing inputs \nand  final  products  will  decrease.  Greater  and  better  access  to \nmarkets  will  inevitably  make  a  difference.  Farm  income  ought  to \nincrease. But greater market access will also fuel competition and \nbenefit  customers.  Better  connectivity  will  help  investors.  More \ninward investment, especially in agribusiness, will have a positive \nimpact on jobs and income. Construction and wholesale and retail \n\n\f \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\nv\n\nroad \n\nusers \n\nfarmers, \n\ntransport \n\ntrade  will  increase,  together  with  housing  and  selected  public \nutilities  such  as  rural  water,  communications,  and  electricity. \nLabor mobility benefits both rural and urban areas. The exodus of \nthe  young  to  the  city  is  expected  to  decrease.  This  will  create \nimpetus for more and better education and health services.  \n \nQuantifiable  economic  benefits  include  (i)  lower  transport  and \nvehicle  operating  costs,  (ii)  greater  passenger  time  savings,  and \n(iii) reduced spoilage of agricultural inputs and produce.  \n \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  the  first  batch  of \nsubprojects  involving  3,200  km  is  around  18.0%.  Beneficiaries \n(including \nof \ninclude \nowners/operators  of  buses  and  trucks)  and  laborers.  Urban \ncommunities will also benefit, including wholesalers and retailers, \nconstruction  groups  and  construction  workers,  banking  and \ninsurance service providers, communication companies, and input \ndistributors. \n \nThe  risk  of  implementation  delays  has  been  addressed  by \nestablishing an SRRDA in each state to act as the implementing \nagency.  The  SRRDA  will  have  authority \nto  decide  on \nimplementation including procurement, and suitably qualified core \nstaff to manage implementation effectively. MORD will provide the \nSRRDAs  with  sufficient  resources  to  engage  consultants  and \ncontractors to perform the main engineering and civil works tasks, \nas well as requisite social and environmental studies.  \n \nThe economic analysis of the investments suggests no significant \neconomic  risks.  Sensitivity  tests  and  risk  analysis  undertaken  on \nsample  subprojects  show \nin \naccordance with the Investment Program selection criteria will be \neconomically  viable  even  under  a  combination  of  adverse \nscenarios.  \n \nThe  risk  of  adverse  social  and  environmental  impacts  has  been \naddressed  by  examining  sample  subprojects.  Consultations  with \nlocal  stakeholders  were  made  and  will  continue  during \nimplementation.  The  risk  of  road  connectivity  improvements \nleading  to  increased  road  accidents  is  to  be  addressed  through \nthe capacity-building component.  \n \nThe  fiduciary  risk  under  PMGSY  will  be  manageable  and \naddressed mainly  through  the  use of  standardized  procedures  in \nthe  areas  of  procurement,  accounting,  and  reporting.  The \nGovernment  will  continue  training  state  government  officials  on \nfinancial  management  and  reporting  as  part  of  its  effort  to  make \nthe  online  management,  monitoring,  and  accounting  system  fully \nfunctional. \n \n\nthe  subprojects  selected \n\nthat \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nfor  reviewing  and  monitoring \n\nADB will address risk associated with the use

\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to India for the Rural Roads Sector II Investment Program \n(Investment Program).1  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nIndia\u2019s road network mainly consists of three road categories: (i) about 60,000 kilometers \n(km) of national highways; (ii) about 600,000 km of secondary roads, comprising state highways \nand  major  district  roads;  and  (iii)  about  2.7  million  km  of  rural  roads.  The  total  road  length  is \nestimated  to  be  about  3.4  million  km.  National  highways,  providing  high-density  links  between \nstates, comprise only 2% of the network but carry about 40% of the traffic. State highways link \nnational  highways  with  district  headquarters,  important  towns,  and  minor  ports.  Major  district \nroads run within districts, connecting areas of production with markets, and rural areas to district \nheadquarters and to state and national highways. The secondary system comprises about 18% \nof the network and carries about 40% of the traffic. Rural roads link rural communities with the \nhighway  network,  providing  access  to  higher  agricultural  incomes,  employment  opportunities, \nand  social  services.  They  represent  about  80%  of  the  network  and  carry  about  20%  of  the \ntraffic. An analysis of the rural roads subsector is in Appendix 2. \n \n3. \nIndia\u2019s  sustained  underinvestment  in  road  infrastructure  has  affected  the  entire  road \nnetwork.2  The  national  highways  and  secondary  system  have  not  been  able  to  meet  the \ndemands  of  the  rapid  traffic  growth.  During  the  past  decade,  freight  traffic  increased  at  about \n12%  per  year  and  passenger  traffic  at  about  8%.  This  rapid  growth  led  to  congestion,  road \ndeterioration,  and  high  costs  of  transport.  In  2000,  in  rural  areas  where  70%  of  India\u2019s \npopulation lives, about 330,000 habitations, 40% of the total 850,000 habitations, were without \nall-weather  road  connectivity.  Many  villages  still  rely  on  earth  tracks  that  are  unsuitable  for \nmotorized  traffic  and  become  impassable  during  the  rainy  season.  Even  where  all-weather \nconnections  are  provided,  the  standard  of  rural  roads  is  low,  maintenance  is  poor,  and  many \nroads are in need of rehabilitation. \n \n4. \nA task force on infrastructure, set up by the Prime Minister in 1998, identified the need to \ntriple or quadruple the ongoing rate of investment in transport infrastructure. As a first step, the \ntask  force  supported  the  13,000-km  National  Highway  Development  Project  to  establish  an \nintegrated  national  highway  network.  This  involved  upgrading  the  links  between  major \nmetropolitan towns and two central transverse routes, one north-south and the other east-west, \nto  4  or  6  lanes  in  heavily  trafficked  sections.  Project  implementation  was  entrusted  to  the \nNational Highways Authority of India for completion by 2010.  \n \n5. \nIn  2000,  the  Government  established  a  national  rural  roads  program:  Pradhan  Mantri \nGram  Sadak  Yojana  (PMGSY),  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Rural  Roads  Program,  to  address  the \nproblem  of  lack  of  rural  road  connectivity.  Its  objective  is  to  provide  good  all-weather  road \nconnections3 to all habitations with a population of 1,000 or more by 2003 and to all habitations \n                                                 \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   Since  the  6th  Five-Year  Plan,  1980\u20131985,  annual  investment  in  roads  varied  between  0.6%  and  1.5%  of  gross \n\ndomestic product, with an average of 1.1%. \n\n3   PMGSY defines an all-weather road as one that is negotiable in all weather conditions, and has adequate cross-\n\ndrainage structures to effectively drain the roadbed.  \n\n\f2 \n \n\n \n\nfor  planning, \n\nimplementation,  as  well  as \n\nwith a population of 500 or more by 2007. In hilly or desert areas, or scheduled tribe areas as \ndefined in Schedule V of the Constitution of India, the objective is to connect all habitations with \na  population  of  at  least  250  by  2007.  On  this  basis,  PMGSY  identifies  more  than  170,000 \nunconnected  habitations  requiring  new  road  connectivity  investments.  Details  of  the  eligible \nhabitations under PMGSY are in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \n6. \nPMGSY  is  funded  by  the  central  Government,  with  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Development \n(MORD)  acting  as  the  overall  coordinating  ministry.  State  governments  have  responsibility  for \nfunding,  and  executing \nstate  planning  and \nmaintenance.  The  latest  estimated  total  cost  of  PMGSY  to  provide  all-weather  connectivity  to \neligible  habitations  is  about  Rs1,320  billion  (about  $30  billion  equivalent).  A  50%  share  of  the \nspecial excise duty (cess) on high-speed diesel oil (about Rs24 billion or $0.5 billion annually) \nwas initially identified for the development of rural roads under PMGSY; this was increased by \n50%.4  From  fiscal  year  (FY)  2001  to  FY2005,  a  total  of  Rs120  billion  was  allocated  from  the \ncess  on  high-speed  diesel  oil.  The  Government  approached  external  agencies,  including  the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank, for financing for the PMGSY scheme in 10 \ncore  states5  with  large  numbers  of  unconnected  habitations.  ADB\u2019s  first  loan,  Rural  Roads \nSector I Project (RRSI) for $400 million, was to finance the construction and upgrading of rural \nroads in the states of Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh and related project management and \nimplementation  support.6  The  World  Bank\u2019s  first  loan-credit  for  $400  million  was  approved  in \nSeptember 2004 to finance road improvement under PMGSY in Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, \nRajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh.  \n \n7. \nMORD  provides  national  administration  of  PMGSY,  and  the  National  Rural  Roads \nDevelopment  Agency  (NRRDA)  provides  technical  support.  The  state  governments  each \ndesignate  one  or  two  executing  agencies  (EAs)  for  PMGSY,  typically  the  rural  development \ndepartment  or  the  public  works  department.  The  department  is  required  to  (i)  appoint  district \nprogram  implementation  units  (PIUs)  to  be  responsible  for  program  implementation,  and  (ii) \nidentify  or  establish  an  autonomous  state  agency  with  a  distinct  legal  status  to  receive  funds \nfrom MORD. All PMGSY road investments are executed by private contractors engaged through \ncompetitive tendering.  \n \nIn consultation with the states, MORD has established various guidelines, manuals, and \n8. \ninstructions for state implementation of PMGSY.7 They provide the following guiding principles \nand  definitions:  (i)  improvements  are  limited  to  roads  categorized  as  other  district  roads  and \nvillage roads forming part of the core rural roads network of through routes and link routes;8 (ii) \n\n                                                 \n4  The  Central  Road  Fund  Act,  2000  introduced  an  additional  excise  duty  (cess)  of  Rs1.00  per  liter  on  petrol  and \nRs1.00  on  high-speed  diesel  oil,  to  be  allocated  as  follows:  (i)  50%  of  the  cess  on  high-speed  diesel  to  the \ndevelopment  of  rural  roads;  and  (ii)  50%  of  the  cess  on  high-speed  diesel  and  100%  of  the  cess  on  petrol  to  \ndevelopment  and  maintenance  of  national  highways,  road  bridges  under  or  over  railway  lines,  safety  work  at \nunstaffed railway crossings, and development and maintenance of state roads. The cess on high-speed diesel was \nincreased to Rs1.5 per liter in 2003. \n\n5   Assam,  Bihar,  Chhattisgarh,  Himachal  Pradesh,  Jharkhand,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Orissa,  Rajasthan,  Uttar  Pradesh, \n\nand West Bengal.   \n\n6   ADB. 2003.

Through routes collect traffic from several \nlink roads or a long chain of habitations and connect to marketing centers either directly or through higher category \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\nproviding  new  all-weather  connectivity  has  precedence  over  improvement  of  existing  fair-\nweather  connectivity,  and  upgrading  fair-weather  through  routes  has  precedence  over \nupgrading fair-weather link routes; and (iii) among eligible roads of similar type, precedence is \ngiven  to  those  serving  a  larger  population.  The  guidelines  also  establish  (i)  the  technical \nspecifications  and  geometric  design  standards  for  PMGSY  roads  to  ensure  that  all  roads  built \nwill  be  of  sound  design  with  adequate  drainage,  in  accordance  with  Indian  Road  Congress \nstandards;  and  (ii)  a  three-tier  quality  control  system  consisting  of  the  PIU  or  executive \nengineer, independent state quality monitoring, and independent national quality monitoring.  \n \n9. \nThe PMGSY guidelines also establish the approach to state, district, and block PMGSY \nplanning.  The  guidelines  explain  the  procedures  for  developing  each  district\u2019s  plan  for \nconnecting  all  eligible  habitations,  with  choice  of  routing  for  each  eligible  habitation  to  be \ndetermined by weighing socioeconomic and infrastructure variables to select the route that will \nmaximize  socioeconomic  benefits  of  the  new  connection.  The  preparation  of  plans  requires \nextensive community consultation. Plans are first prepared at the block level for approval by the \nintermediate panchayat.9 Block plans are consolidated into district plans for approval by the zilla \npanchayat. After this exercise, link roads identified in district plans as forming the core network \nare  included  in  the  Comprehensive  New  Connectivity  Priority  List,  from  which  annual  project \nproposals for PMGSY financing are selected.  \n \nThe  PMGSY  guidelines  indicate  that  establishing  and  implementing  satisfactory \n10. \nmechanisms  to  provide  funding  and  other  assistance  for  maintaining  PMGSY  assets  will  be  a \nkey  requirement  for  states  to  be  considered  for  future  PMGSY  assistance.  The  guidelines \nrequire states seeking PMGSY financing to use standard bidding documentation with a 5-year \npostconstruction  maintenance  component.  Before  submitting  annual  project  proposals  for \nMORD approval each year, the states are required to approve budgeting of an annual slice of \nrequired funds under the 5-year road maintenance contracts. The guidelines require the states \nto  identify  suitable  zilla  or  intermediate  panchayat  institutions  for  undertaking  maintenance  of \nthe rural roads developed under PMGSY, and to hand over PMGSY roads to such institutions.10 \nThe state government is also required to provide an undertaking to remit to these institutions the \ncosts  of  the  requisite  maintenance  through  either  budget  allocations  or  alternative  sources  of \nfunding. \n \n11. \nAlthough not meeting the first phase target, PMGSY has made good progress in its first \n4  years  of  implementation.  MORD  allocated  Rs22  billion\u2013Rs25  billion  (about  $0.5  billion \nequivalent)  in  each  of  FY2001  to  FY2005.  As  of  April  2005,  a  cumulative  Rs119  billion  ($2.8 \nbillion equivalent) had been disbursed to participating states for about 40,000 road works, which \nare  to  connect  about  20%  of  the  eligible  habitations  under  PMGSY.  By  March  2005,  about \n24,600  road  works  were  completed  including  about  95%  of  the  13,217  road  works  in  the \nFY2001 allocation and about 81% of the 11,131 road works in the FY2002-2003 allocation.11  \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \nroads. Link routes connect a single habitation or group of habitations to through routes or district roads leading to \nmarket centers.  \n\n9   A  panchayat  is  a  body  of  directly  elected  people  responsible  for  development  of  activities  in  an  area.  The  three \nlevels  of  panchayats  comprise  gram  panchayat  at  village  level,  intermediate  panchayat  at  block  level,  and  zilla \npanchayat at district level. These panchayats are collectively called the panchayati raj institutions. \n\n10 Following  the  73rd  Constitutional  Amendment  in  1992,  state  governments  are  to  assign  responsibility  for \n\nmaintenance of rural roads to panchayats and to remit necessary financial resources for this purpose. \n\n11  The annual allocations for FY2002 and FY2003 were combined and done at one time. Due to the time required by \nthe  states  to  prepare  project  proposals  and  tender,  and  by  NRRDA  to  review  proposals,  normally  a  minimum  6-\nmonth interval follows the beginning of a fiscal year and the start of road works under the annual allocation.  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n \n\n \n\n12.   Recently,  the  Government  announced  a  revised  time  frame  for  achieving  rural \nconnectivity  under  an  umbrella  program,  Bharat  Nirman,12  to  rebuild  rural  infrastructure.  The \nrevised  target  to  achieve  connectivity  to  all  habitations  with  a  population  of  1,000  (500  in  the \ncase of hilly or tribal areas) or more by 2009/10 would require about Rs480 billion ($11 billion \nequivalent)  from  FY2006  to  FY2010.  About  40%  of  this  requirement  is  to  be  funded  from  the \ncess on high-speed diesel oil, and about 7% from the committed assistance from ADB and the \nWorld Bank; funding sources for the balance of 53% have not been identified. The Government \nhas requested ADB and the World Bank to provide additional loans-credit to finance part of the \nidentified  funding  gap.  The  Government  is  also  considering  mobilizing  additional  resources \nthrough domestic borrowing.    \n \n13. \nThe three states to be initially covered under the Investment Program are among the 10 \nstates  with  more  than  10,000  unconnected  habitations  and  were  selected  by  the  Government \nfor  focused  PMGSY  intervention.  The  state  governments  of  Assam,  Orissa,  and  West  Bengal \nattach high priority to PMGSY. The three states are among the best-performing states in terms \nof  the  number  of  habitations  connected  under  the  PMGSY  allocation  from  FY2001  to  2005.13 \nThe national quality monitors rate the quality of the road works completed to date in the three \nstates as average to very good, despite the long monsoons that disrupt construction works and \ndifficulty in obtaining good construction materials, particularly in West Bengal.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nKey Challenges \n\nThe  Investment  Program  is  ADB\u2019s  second  rural  roads  investment  under  PMGSY.  The \n14.  \nfirst, the RRSI, is currently improving about 1,000 km of rural roads in the states of Chhattisgarh \nand  Madhya  Pradesh.  The  RRSI  identified  policy  issues  to  be  addressed  during  project \npreparation and implementation, and included components in its project scope to address them. \nPolicy  issues  with  programwide  implications  include  (i)  provision  of  reliable  implementation \narrangements  for  large  investments  in  rural  roads  including  establishment  of  dedicated  state \nrural  road  development  agencies  to  streamline  implementation;  (ii)  refinement  of  the  project \nselection  criteria  to  incorporate  network  efficiency  considerations,  economic  return  thresholds, \nand safeguard provisions; (iii) commitment to required levels of financing for maintenance and \nestablishment  of  reliable  approaches  for  planning  and  executing  maintenance;  and  (iv) \nincorporating road safety measures to accompany PMGSY road connectivity improvements.  \n \n15.   Recognizing  the  relevance  of  these  issues  in  the  effective  implementation  of  PMGSY, \nMORD quickly expanded and upgraded PMGSY standard operating procedures over the past 2 \nyears to address these issues, in consultation with the participating states and through dialogue \nwith  ADB  and  World  Bank.  MORD  also  refined  the  planning  and  monitoring  tools.  Notable \nimprovements to the standard operating procedures include  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nestablishment  of  a  state  rural  roads  development  agency  (SRRDA)  in  all \nparticipating states;  \nadoption  of  the  network  concept  including  through  routes  to  achieve  better \nconnectivity in the project selection criteria; \n\n                                                 \n12  The finance minister, in his budget speech of 28 February 2005, announced that rural roads comprise one of the \nsix components of Bharat Nirman (meaning Laying the foundation for India). The other proposed components are \nirrigation, rural housing, rural water supply, rural electrification, and rural telecommunication connectivity.  \n\n13  During  the  period,  2,232  habitations  were  connected  in  Assam,  2,668  in  Orissa,  and  2,717  in  West  Bengal;  the \n\nthree states rank from fourth to sixth among all states. \n\n\f \n\n5\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\nintroduction  of  a  transect  walk  (para.  37)  at  the  project  preparation  stage  to \nensure active community participation and to address community concerns at an \nearly stage of project preparation;  \n\n(iv)  mandatory  use  of  the  standard  bidding  document  for  civil  works  with  a  5-year \npostconstruction  maintenance  component,  and  budgetary  allocation  of  funds  by \nparticipating states for this component;  \nintroduction of a maintenance planning process based on a simple road surface \ncondition indicator\u2014the pavement condition index; and \nintroduction  of  a  road  safety  audit  and  inclusion  of  financing  provisions  under \nPMGSY for road safety awareness-raising activities. \n\n(vi) \n\n(v) \n\n \n16. \nTo  implement  these  new  initiatives,  MORD  prepared  an  operations  manual  that  spells \nout  detailed  procedural  requirements  consolidating  administrative  circulars  and  instructions \npreviously  issued  by  MORD  and  NRRDA.  For  monitoring  purposes,  MORD  is  introducing  the \nonline  management,  monitoring,  and  accounting  system  (OMMAS),  which  enables  effective \nmonitoring  of  work  progress  and  reporting  of  fund  flow  via  the  PMGSY  website.14  MORD \nmonitors  compliance  of  the  state  implementing  agencies  with  requirements  under  these \ninitiatives, and has made some of the key requirements conditions for MORD approval of state \nannual project proposals. In sum, PMGSY is administered by a very strong national government \nagency  capable  of  identifying  and  addressing  problems  in  a  timely  and  effective  manner,  and \nwilling to adopt good practices.  \n \n17.   While \nthe  PMGSY  procedural  requirements,  early \nimplementation  of  the  RRSI  and  formulation  of  the  Investment  Program  identified  a  few  areas \nrequiring  improvement  that  would  be  facilitated  through  ADB  intervention.  These  include  the \nfollowing:  \n \n\nthe  states  generally \n\nfollow \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  community  consultation  scheme  introduced  during  project  preparation \n(transect walk, etc.) is yet to be fully implemented. \nSubstantial  capacity  expansion  is  required  at  the  PIU,  State  Technical  Agency \n(STA), and SRRDA to meet the current technical, fiduciary, and other procedural \nrequirements  under  PMGSY;  and  to  process  the  increased  workload  that  will \nneed to be undertaken under ADB financing. \nTechnical expertise currently available at the PIU, STA, and SRRDA needs to be \ndiversified  and  broadened  to  handle  safeguard  issues  that  arise  during  project \npreparation and implementation.  \n\n2. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n18.   ADB\u2019s support for the road subsector has been developed in close collaboration with the \nDepartment  for  International  Development  (United  Kingdom),  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation,  and  World  Bank.  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  have  adopted  the  Coordinated \nAssistance Strategy for the Road Sector, which was prepared jointly in March 2001 and updated \nin  January  2002.  Based  on  this  strategy,  they  hold  regular  tripartite  meetings  with  the \nGovernment  to  discuss  impending  road  policy  issues.  ADB  has  also  met  regularly  with  the \nWorld Bank team that prepared its Rural Roads Project, and the two banks have shared their \nrespective  project  preparatory  studies.  For  the  preparation  of  the  Investment  Program,  ADB \nadopted  an  approach  to  streamline  procedural  requirements  and  harmonize  those  with  World \nBank  interventions.  The  two  institutions  have  started  a  dialogue  on  joint  review  of  their \n\n                                                 \n14  http://pmgsy.nic.in, http://pmgsyonline.nic.in.  \n\n \n\n\f6 \n \n\n \n\nrespective rural roads projects. Japan Bank for International Cooperation and ADB are exploring \npossible cofinancing of road projects in India. A summary of external assistance is in Appendix \n3. \n \nPMGSY has received two loans-credit totaling $800 million, one from ADB and the other \n19. \nfrom  the  World  Bank,  both  for  $400  million.  The  World  Bank  is  also  providing  a  technical \nassistance loan of $8.5 million to (i) prepare manuals and pilot projects, (ii) purchase laboratory \nand survey equipment, and (iii) provide training to the engineers of the state agencies as well as \nof  the  contractors.  The  Government  of  the  United  Kingdom  provided  $1.7  million  to  finance \ntechnical assistance for project preparation for the RRSI and the Investment Program. To meet \neven  the  revised  and  more  realistic  target  of  connecting  all  habitations  with  a  population  of \n1,000 (500 in the case of hilly or tribal areas) by 2009/10, the funding gap is huge. The World \nBank plans to increase its support to rural roads by expanding the coverage of its financing.15  \n \n20. \nPMGSY,  with  its  clear  program  goals,  generally  well-established  standard  operating \nprocedures  based  on  an  annual  program  cycle,  and  high  level  of  central  Government \ncommitment to continuously allocate necessary funds to the program, offers a good opportunity \nfor ADB to apply the newly introduced MFF.16 ADB\u2019s second and third loans to finance PMGSY \nwere originally programmed at $400 million for 2005 and $350 million for 2007. The proposed \nInvestment Program combines these two into a single MFF covering the period up to 2009/10, \nproviding a predictable financing source for the Government and at the same time allowing the \ncentral Government flexibility to flow funds to rural road investments in core PMGSY states in \nan  effective  and  efficient  manner,  on  the  basis  of  progress  achieved  by  the  states  under \npreceding annual fund allocations and the states\u2019 readiness for new investment. \n  \n\n3. \n\nLessons Learned  \n\n \n21. \nTo ensure effective and timely delivery of intended output, the Investment Program will \nhave  the  following  design  features,  reflecting  lessons  learned  from  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  past \nand  ongoing  transport  sector  projects  and  PMGSY  implementation  during  the  last  5  years:  (i) \nuse of the existing implementation setup for PMGSY, which is capable of implementing a large \nInvestment Program; (ii) use of agency procedures for procurement and financial management; \n(iii)  greater  delegation  of  authority  under  the  sector  loan  modality  to  the  EA,  taking  full \nadvantage  of  the  well-established  and  standardized  operating  procedures  of  PMGSY;  (iv) \nstreamlining  of  procedural  requirements  and  harmonization  of  those  with  World  Bank \ninterventions,  particularly  with  respect  to  safeguards;  (v)  improved  upstream  community \nparticipation to better address safeguard issues at an early stage of subproject preparation; and \n(vi) strengthened performance monitoring.  \n \n\n4. \n\nAsian Development Bank Sector Strategy \n\nThe  theme  of  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP)17  for  India  is  mainstreaming \n22. \npoverty  reduction.  In  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  priorities  for  the  10th  Five-Year  Plan  2002\u2013\n2007,  this  is  to  be  addressed  primarily  by  supporting  economic  growth,  including  both  high \ngrowth  and  equitable  pro-poor  growth.  The  CSP  points  to  emerging  consensus  over  the \nimportance of infrastructure in poverty reduction, through its indirect impact on growth leading to \nincreased  incomes  and  employment,  and  its  direct  contributions  to  incomes  and  employment \nand reducing human poverty by improving access to social services. The CSP update for 2005\u2013\n\n                                                 \n15  The World Bank\u2019s Country Strategy for India lists Rural Roads II at $500 million for 2007. \n16  ADB. 2005. Pilot Financing Instrument and Modalities. Manila.  \n17  ADB. 2003. Country Strategy and Program (2004\u20132006): India. Manila. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\n200718 highlights strong connectivity to link poor rural families to social services and markets as \nthe  organizing  theme  for  the  transport  sector.  The  CSP  update  also  identifies  the  need  for \ninfrastructure  projects  to  incorporate  institutional  reforms  to  improve  sustainability,  particularly \nby establishing sound approaches to maintenance. The RRSI was formulated to combine each \nof these thrusts of the CSP and CSP update.  \n \n23. \nThe  Investment  Program  will  build  on  the  achievements  of  ADB\u2019s  initial  rural  roads \nintervention  under  the  RRSI,  and  seek  to  assist  PMGSY  in  introducing  the  good  practices \nadopted at the central level to the Investment Program states. The Investment Program will also \nseek  to  improve  program  delivery  by  streamlining  ADB\u2019s  procedural  requirements  including \nadoption  of  agency  procedures  capable  of  handling  a  large-scale  investment  while  ensuring \nquality output. The supplementary operating procedures developed for the Investment Program \nto  improve  program  planning,  execution,  and  monitoring  have  incorporated  lessons  learned \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  initial  intervention  and  benefited  from  the  practices  and  operating  procedures \ndeveloped for the World Bank\u2019s Rural Roads Project.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  Investment  Program  is  a  subset  and  an  area  and  time  slice  of  the  Government\u2019s \n24. \nrural  roads  program\u2014PMGSY;  and  therefore  shares  the  objective  common  to  all  PMGSY \ninvestments:  to  reduce  poverty  and  deprivation,  and  support  economic  growth  of  rural \ncommunities  in  India  by  providing  them  with  enhanced  access  to  markets;  employment \nopportunities; and social services, including health and education.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\nThis  outcome  will  be  attained  by  (i)  providing  rural  habitations  in  the  most  poorly \n25. \nconnected states\u2014initially Assam, Orissa, and West Bengal, and any other states meeting the \nInvestment  Program  requirements\u2014with  all-weather  road  connections;  and  (ii)  improving \nefficiency and sustainability of PMGSY implementation in these states by providing support for \ncapacity building in technical, safeguard, financial management, and road safety aspects. The \nInvestment  Program  will  build  and  upgrade  about  30,000  km  of  rural  roads  to  an  all-weather \nstandard;  they  are  expected  to  connect  about  19,000  habitations  to  a  greater  transportation \nnetwork.  The  outputs  of  the  noninvestment  interventions  will  be  high-quality  rural  roads  and \nincreased capacity of the state institutions responsible for managing the rural road investment \nand maintenance.  \n \n\n1. \n\nRoad Connectivity Component \n\n26. \nThe  Investment  Program  will  include  investments  for  rural  roads  that  form  part  of \nPMGSY. The Investment Program will be implemented in batches, generally coinciding with the \nPMGSY  annual  project  approval  and  fund  allocation  cycle.  The  Investment  Program  will  be \nfinanced  by  central  Government\u2019s  funds  and  borrowing  from  ADB.  ADB  financing  will  be \nprovided  in  the  form  of  an  MFF,  under  which  actual  funds  will  be  provided  in  multiple  loans, \neach financing a clearly defined investment project (hereinafter called the Project) comprising a \nset  of  subprojects  and  components.  A  framework  financing  agreement  (FFA)  recording  basic \nconditions and terms applicable to individual loans and overall MFF operation is attached. The \n\n                                                 \n18  ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program Update (2005\u20132007): India. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n \n\n \n\nGovernment  will  submit  periodic  financing  requests  (PFRs),  which  will  be  reviewed  and \nconverted into individual loan and project agreements by ADB.  \n \n27.   Subprojects covering 3,200 km of rural roads, about 1,000 km each in Assam and West \nBengal and about 1,200 km in Orissa, have been prepared for inclusion in the first batch to be \nimplemented  under  the  Investment  Program.  The  procurement  of  civil  works  for  these \nsubprojects  is  at  an  advanced  stage  for  implementation  in  the  first  year  of  the  Investment \nProgram.  In  addition  to  ADB-financed  subprojects,  the  first  yearly  batch  of  the  Investment \nProgram will include about 3,800 km of subprojects to be implemented in the three states.  \n \n28. \nThe remaining subprojects, covering about 23,000 km of rural roads, will be prepared by \nthe  states  in  phases,  and  implemented  in  the  subsequent  three  annual  batches.  The  MFF, \nunder each of the subsequent individual loans, will cover about one third of the annual financing \nrequirement of the Investment Program.  \n \n29. \nThe  subprojects  to  be  included  in  the  first  batch  serve  as  samples  for  developing \nselection  criteria  for  ADB  financing,  which  supplement  the  PMGSY  guidelines.  Throughout \nInvestment  Program  implementation,  subprojects  seeking  ADB  financing  will  be  prepared  in \naccordance  with  the  selection  criteria  given  in  Appendix  4.  These  selection  criteria  establish \nrequirements  for  subprojects  in  terms  of  (i)  eligibility  of  road  connectivity  investment  in \naccordance  with  the  PMGSY  guidelines,  (ii)  preparedness  and  adherence  to  technical \nspecifications,  and  (iii)  compliance  with  agreed  safeguard  requirements  applicable  at  the \nsubproject  preparation  stage.  Adherence  to  eligibility  requirements  will  be  monitored  during \nsubproject implementation and only subprojects meeting the technical, safeguard, fiduciary, and \nmaintenance funding requirements in Appendix 4 will be eligible for ADB financing by the loans \nunder  the  MFF.  For  the  design  of  subprojects,  the  technical  standards  and  specifications  of \nPMGSY roads (summarized in Appendix 5) will be followed. \n \nADB  will  review  subproject  proposals  seeking  ADB  financing  before  completion  of  the \n30. \nprocurement  process.  However,  if  it  finds  that  an  individual  state\u2019s  capacity  to  prepare \nsubprojects to the agreed standards is evident in the additional subproject proposals from that \nstate,  ADB  may  delegate  subproject  approving  authority  to  MORD  for  that  state.  Approval \nprocedures to be followed for additional subprojects seeking ADB financing are also in Appendix \n4. ADB will conduct regular review of overall performance and compliance by the Government \nand the state governments with the agreed procedures.  \n \n\n2. \n\nCapacity-Building Component \n\n31. \nPMGSY  is  administered  nationally  by  MORD  with  technical  and  management  support \nfrom NRRDA, which is a lean organization equipped with a highly qualified staff. During the last \n5  years  of  PMGSY  implementation,  the  three  participating  states  have  developed  a  sound \ntechnical and operational track record in road planning, design, and supervision of engineering \nworks. This capacity has been developed principally in the context of PMGSY rules, regulations, \nand requirements pertaining to procurement, safeguards, fiduciary oversight, and administration \nas a whole. The central and state governments are generally satisfied with their expertise and \nthe  experience.  However,  for  operations  funded  through  multilateral  development  institutions \nsuch as ADB, both parties are aware of the additional policy and administrative requirements. \nFurther,  adoption  of  an  MFF,  a  financing  modality  new  to  both  India  and  ADB,  will  require \nadditional support, at least at the early stage, for smooth operation and risk management under \nthe  MFF.  Thus  the  Investment  Program  includes  noninvestment  interventions,  all  aimed  at \nstrengthening  capacity  and  expertise.  These  interventions  will  be  channeled  through  two \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\nmeans: (i) engagement of external experts to the implementing agencies; and (ii) a more active \nand longer term involvement in the execution of the Investment Program by ADB staff.  \n \n32. \nCapacity building provided by external experts to the implementing agencies will build on \nRRSI  interventions  and  focus  on  state  capacity  building  for  subproject  implementation.  The \nRRSI  was  designed  to  provide  capacity-building  support  to  mainly  address  national  policy \nissues  with  respect  to  road  maintenance  and  road  safety,  and  to  develop  and  implement \nnational  training  programs.  This  support  will  continue  while  the  Investment  Program  is \nimplemented.  The  resulting  standard  operating  procedures  in  the  form  of  guidelines  and \nmanuals  will  benefit  the  states  as  well.  Capacity  building  under  the  Investment  Program  will \nfocus  on  state  support  to  build  institutional  capacity  to  prepare  and  implement  rural  road \ndevelopment in an efficient and sustainable manner, and to properly address policy issues such \nas  safeguard  and  road  safety  throughout  the  investment  cycle.  Policy  areas  addressed  under \nthe RRSI and the Investment Program and the status of ADB intervention are summarized in a \npolicy  matrix  in  Appendix  6.  The  areas  of  capacity  building  on  which  the  Investment  Program \nwill focus are highlighted in Supplementary Appendix B.   \n  \n33. \nCapacity building provided by more active and longer term involvement of ADB staff in \nprogram execution will require that ADB program teams on standby offer advice and guide the \nEAs on specific issues and problems pertaining to operations under the MFF. The Government \nis  providing  ADB  with  a  set  of  specific  \u201cwarranties  and  representations\u201d  on  various  fronts  and \nmay  need  \u201creal  time\u201d  support  prior  to  formal  submission  of  PFRs  under  the  MFF.  ADB  will \nhandle  this  requirement  in  two  ways.  Firstly,  ADB  will  ensure  capacity  of  the  India  Resident \nMission  for  review  and  monitoring  of  Investment  Program  implementation,  particularly  with \nrespect  to  fiduciary  and  safeguard  oversight,  while  providing  sufficient  support  to  the \nGovernment in the form of an advisory technical assistance to be separately provided for these \nareas. Secondly, headquarters staff responsible for the Investment Program will use time saved \nduring processing to supervise and monitor Investment Program implementation. This is clearly \none of the advantages of the MFF.  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nIn  recognition  of  the  good  progress  achieved  by  PMGSY  to  date  and  the  substantial \n34. \nimprovements  made  to  its  standard  operating  procedures,  and  considering  the  community-\nbased, small-scale nature of the road works involved, the Investment Program will maximize the \nuse of the existing government system for PMGSY implementation.  \n \n35. \nUnder  the  Investment  Program,  authority  under  the  sector-lending  modality  to  approve \nsubprojects seeking ADB financing will be largely delegated to the EA fully taking advantage of \nthe  well-established  and  standardized  operating  procedures  applicable  to  PMGSY.  The \nInvestment  Program  will  operate  with  streamlined  procedural  requirements,  which  are \nharmonized with those of the World Bank, particularly with respect to safeguards.  \n \n36. \nAlthough centrally financed and administered, the PMGSY planning and implementation \nprocesses employ decentralized decision making and extensive community participation. At the \nplanning stage, panchayats play the central role in selecting and prioritizing eligible roads and \nroad  works \nthe  past  5  years  of  PMGSY \nimplementation, MORD has expanded the scope for community participation under PMGSY by \nformalizing the process of preparing rural road plans and consultation with the local community \nduring design.  \n \n\nimplemented  under  PMGSY.  Over \n\nto  be \n\n \n\n\f10 \n \n\n \n\nthe \n\nimpacts  of \n\ntransect  walk \n\ninformation  on \n\nthe  process  of \n\nto  dissemination  of \n\nThe PMGSY guidelines require PIUs to consult with the local community in coordination \n37. \nwith the gram (village) panchayat concerned to determine the suitable road alignment, resolve \nissues  of  land  availability,  and  address  other  adverse  social  and  environmental  impacts  while \npreparing the detailed project report. The PMGSY guidelines set out detailed requirements for a \ntransect walk to be conducted as part of the community consultation process. Representatives \nof the village and PIU engineers will traverse the entire stretch of the road/path to be improved, \nand conduct consultations with interested persons.  \n \nIn  line  with  the  community-based  nature  of  the  road  works,  the  customary  community \n38. \npractice is to make land and associated assets available for PMGSY investment as a voluntary \ndonation. This practice has proven effective, allowing implementation of 66,000 km of PMGSY \nroad works nationwide and 5,700 km in Assam, Orissa, and West Bengal over the last 4 years.  \n \n39.  \nThe  Investment  Program  will  seek  to  strengthen  the  existing  PMGSY  community \nparticipation  process  with  a  view  to  strengthening  ownership  of  road  improvements  by  the \ncommunity  and  minimizing  adverse  social  and  environmental \nroad \nimprovements.  Each  of  the  three  states  has  prepared  a  community  participation  framework \n(CPF)  to  supplement  the  existing  PMGSY  guidelines  and  to  establish  requirements  for \ntransparent community-based decision making to deal with safeguard issues. The CPF provides \ndetailed procedural steps to be followed by the PIUs from preparation for advance publicity for \ntransfer, \nthe \nsupport/assistance provisions, and grievance procedures to the affected communities. The PIUs \nwill  be  supported  by  project  implementation  consultants  (PICs),  who  will  include  social  and \nenvironmental  experts  and  assist  PIU  engineers  in  incorporating  social  and  environmental \nconsiderations  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  road  works.  External  monitoring  will  be \nconducted  by  the  technical  support  consultants  (TSCs)  engaged  by  NRRDA  to  check \ncompliance  with  the  agreed  CPF  procedures,  and  monitor  and  evaluate  the  participatory \nprocesses on a sample basis. The outline of the CPF is in Appendix 7.  \n \n40.  \nFor  environmental  safeguard,  an  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework \n(EAF)  was  developed  to  establish  guidelines  for  the  EAs,  SRRDAs,  PIUs  and  other  parties \nconcerned  for  preparing  and  implementing  environmental  mitigation  measures  under  the \nInvestment  Program.  Environmental  codes  of  practice  (ECOP)  were  developed  based  on  the \nassessment of the environmental impacts in the first 3,200 km of subprojects, and will be used \nin  the  subsequent  batches  to  effectively  identify  and  implement  required  mitigation  measures. \nThe outline of the EAF is in Appendix 8. \n \n41.   Under the MFF, the amount and timing of the financing requests will be at the discretion \nof  the  Government,  subject  to  meeting  the  MFF\u2019s  terms  and  conditions;  and  be  mainly \ndetermined  by  the  progress  achieved  under  preceding  annual  fund  allocations  and  the  states\u2019 \nreadiness  for  new  investment.  The  Government  indicated  that  under  the  MFF  it  may  request \nfinancing for PMGSY investments in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, which are among the \n10  core  PMGSY  states  and  are  receiving  financing  under  the  RRSI.  Subprojects  in  new \nparticipating states will be eligible for ADB financing under the MFF if ADB is satisfied that the \nnew  participating  states  are  capable  of  implementing  subprojects  meeting  the  same  technical, \nsafeguard,  economic,  fiduciary,  and  sustainability  requirements  being  met  by  those  under  the \nInvestment  Program  in  the  Assam,  Orissa,  and  West  Bengal.  The  same  selection  criteria  and \napproval  process  as  indicated  in  Appendix  4  will  be  followed  by  subprojects  in  the  new \nparticipating  states.  The  governments  of  these states  will  have  to  adopt  the  CPF  and  EAF  for \nsocial and environmental safeguards for the respective states. Implementation arrangements of \nthe  Investment  Program  are  largely  based  on  those  for  PMGSY,  which  are  universally \n\nland \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11\n\n \n\napplicable  across  India.  The  implementation  arrangements  currently  proposed  for  Assam, \nOrissa, and West Bengal can be easily replicated in the new participating states.           \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n42. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Investment  Program  is  estimated  at  about  $2.1  billion  equivalent \ninclusive  of  taxes,  duties,  and  interest  and  other  charges  on  the  loans  from  ADB  during \nconstruction (Table 1). Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 9. \n \n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n \n\nItem \n \nRoad Connectivity Componentb \nCapacity-Building Componentc \nInterest during Construction \n \na \nb \n\nTotald \n\n \n\nTotala \n\n \n2,039.0 \n2.0 \n59.0 \n2,100.0 \n\nIn mid-2005 prices. \nIncluding  social  and  environmental  mitigation,  civil  works,  and  project \nimplementation consultants. \nIncluding technical support consultants for capacity building. \nIncluding taxes and duties estimated to be about $86 million. \n\nd \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nc \n\n \nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n43. \nThe  Government  has  requested  financing  of  up  to  an  equivalent  of  $750  million  from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the Investment Program. The financing will be \nprovided under an MFF in accordance with ADB policy.19 The MFF will extend multiple loans to \nfinance  a  range  of  subprojects  under  the  Investment  Program,  subject  to  submission  of  a \nrelated PFR by the Government and execution of the related loan and project agreements. The \nGovernment has entered into a FFA with ADB. The FFA satisfies the requirements set forth in \nAppendix  4  of  the  Pilot  Financing  Instruments  and  Modalities  (see  footnote  19).  The \nGovernment  is  required  to  comply  with  the  FFA  requirements.  Pursuant  to  the  FFA,  the \nGovernment has submitted to ADB the first PFR in the amount of $100 million. The first PFR is \npresented to the Board, together with the FFA. The loans under the MFF will finance civil works, \nand  consulting  services  and  other  capacity  building  supports.  The  minimum  amount  of  a  loan \nrequest  will  be  $30  million.  All  of  the  provisions  of  the  ordinary  operations  loan  regulations \napplicable  to  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  loans20  will  apply  to  each  loan,  subject  to  modifications,  if \nany,  that  may  be  included  under  any  loan  agreement.  The  Government  has  the  option  to \nchoose  between  eligible  currencies  and  the  interest  rate  regime  for  each  loan.  The  specific \nterms  of  each  loan  will  be  based  on  the  related  PFR  with  interest  to  be  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility.  The \nGovernment  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  lending  facility,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n\n                                                 \n19  ADB. 2005.

For subprojects intended \nfor  financing  by  the  loans  under  the  MFF,  implementation  arrangements  described  in  this \nsection,  which  are  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  standard  policy  and  operation  requirements,  will \ngenerally apply. Arrangements and requirements specific to individual loans/projects under the \nMFF will be included in the corresponding legal documents.  \n \n\n2. \n\nManagement \n\n47. \nThe  EAs  for  the  Investment  Program  are  MORD  at  the  central  level  and  the \ngovernments of the participating states (initially Assam, Orissa, and West Bengal) at the state \nlevel.  MORD,  with  technical  and  management  support  from  NRRDA,  will  be  responsible  for \noverall  Investment  Program  supervision  and  execution.  The  state  governments,  through  their \nrespective  state  departments  responsible  for  rural  road  improvement,  will  be  responsible  for \nexecuting  the  Investment  Program  at  the  state  level.  The  MORD  joint  secretary  will  chair  a \ncoordination committee, to be set up by the Government within 3 months of loan effectiveness \nof the first loan to be provided under the MFF. The committee will meet quarterly and monitor \nthe use of loan funds and overall implementation performance of the Projects under the MFF. \nThe committee members will comprise senior officials of MORD; the Department of Economic \nAffairs; NRRDA; and the governments of Assam, Orissa, and West Bengal.  \n \n48. \nThe  implementing  agencies  for  the  Investment  Program  are  the  SRRDAs  in  the \nparticipating states, namely Assam State Road Board, Orissa State Rural Roads Agency, and \n\n                                                 \n21  As required under the PMGSY guidelines, the proceeds will be provided directly by MORD to the SRRDAs. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13\n\n \n\nWest  Bengal  State  Rural  Development  Agency.22  The  SRRDAs  are  each  headed  by  a  chief \nexecutive  officer  who  is  the  state  program  director  for  overall  coordination  of  implementation, \nincluding  planning,  management,  consultant  selection,  and  procurement.  The  chief  executive \nofficer  is  supported  by  experienced  personnel  at  state  headquarters  and  in  the  district  PIUs, \nwhich implement PMGSY investments. In Assam, 19 PIUs cover 23 districts; in West Bengal, 19 \nPIUs  cover  one  district  each;  and  in  Orissa,  29  PIUs  cover  30  districts.  A  PIU  is  normally \nheaded by a superintending/executive engineer and staffed with assistant/junior engineers and \nclerks/cashiers.  \n \n49. \nTo monitor the use of loan funds and overall implementation performance of the Projects \nunder the MFF at the state level, and to ensure coordination among the key agencies involved, \neach  participating  state  will  establish  a  project  implementation  committee  within  3  months  of \nloan effectiveness of the first loan. The committee will meet monthly, and be chaired by the chief \nexecutive  officer  of  the  SRRDA,  with  representation  from  the  respective  state  department \nresponsible  for  rural  road  development,23  PIUs,  and  consultants.  As  necessary,  other  state \nagencies may be invited to this committee to assist in implementing the Project in areas such as \nforestry  and  land  availability.  The  organizational  structure  for  program  implementation  is  in \nAppendix 10. \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n50.  \nThe Investment Program will be implemented over 5  years inclusive of preconstruction \nactivities.  Each  civil  works  contract  will  require  12  months  for  completion.  Based  on  the \nestimated schedule, the civil works are expected to be implemented in four annual batches. The \nfirst batch of subprojects (the sample subprojects) is expected to be ready for contract award in \nDecember  2005.  For  each  of  the  subsequent  subproject  batches,  the  Government  and  the \nSRRDAs  will  develop  detailed  implementation  schedules  by  the  time  of  submission  of  the \ncorresponding PFR. An indicative implementation schedule is in Appendix 11.  \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n51. \nProcurement  to  be  financed  by  the  loans  under  the  MFF  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The upper limit for a civil works contract to \nbe  procured  through  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB)  procedures  will  be  initially  set  at  $10 \nmillion, and be reviewed during implementation. The PMGSY standard bidding documents and \nprocedure  developed  by  NRRDA  for  procurement  of  civil  works  based  on  item  unit  rates  are \nfound acceptable to ADB, and will be used for all LCB contracts by the loans under the MFF. \nThe  PMGSY  bidding  process  follows  the  single-stage,  two-envelope  system  in  which  each \nbidder simultaneously submits its technical and financial proposals in two separate envelopes, \nand only the financial proposals of technically qualified and responsive bidders will be opened \nand evaluated.     \n \n52.  \nThe PMGSY guidelines specify that civil works contract packages should be in the range \nof  Rs10  million  to  Rs50  million  ($0.2  million  to  $1.1  million),  but  encourage  use  of  larger \n\n                                                 \n22  The three SRRDAs  were  all established  in 2003  as nonprofit organizations  under the  Firms and Societies Act to \nimplement PMGSY. Their staff focus on planning and managing PMGSY. Design, supervision, and civil works are \noutsourced to private consultants and contractors. Outsourcing was adopted both to ensure the quality and value \nfor  money  of  works  undertaken  and  to  avoid  creating  a  large  establishment  that  would  become  underemployed \nonce the main PMGSY activities are completed. \n\n23  Assam  State  Public  Works  Department,  Orissa  State  Department  of  Rural  Development,  and  West  Bengal  State \n\nDepartment of Panchayat and Rural Development. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n \n\n \n\ncontracts.  Civil  works  contract  packages  under  the  Investment  Program  will  be  prepared  with \ndue consideration to the geographic setting against which the civil works are carried out, i.e., the \nremoteness  of  subproject  locations  often  noncontiguous  and  the  small  size  of  individual  civil \nworks.  The  3,200  km  of  first  batch  subprojects  have  been  packaged  into  about  300  contract \npackages  in  the  range  of  $0.2  million  to  $3  million,  with  an  average  size  of  $0.9  million \n(Supplementary  Appendix  C).  Contract  packages  for  additional  subprojects  will  be  decided \nduring implementation, generally following the PMGSY norm and based on experience gained \nduring  early  Investment  Program  implementation.  To  facilitate  timely  implementation  of  the \nsubprojects, consultants have been assisting the SRRDAs in preparing bidding documents for \ncivil works. The same assistance will be provided by the PICs.  \n \n53. \nIn  addition,  to  support  timely  contract  approvals  while  ensuring  sound  practice, \nownership,  and  accountability,  post  facto  approval  procedures  will  be  adopted  for  LCB  civil \nworks contracts intended for financing by the loans under the MFF. For the first five civil works \npackages under LCB in each state intended for ADB financing under the MFF, the SRRDA will \nsubmit  bid  evaluation  reports  for  ADB\u2019s  review  and  approval  before  awarding  the  contracts.  If \nADB  finds  bid  evaluation  for  the  first  five  contract  packages  satisfactory,  the  SRRDA  will \nproceed  with  procurement  procedures  and  contract  award  for  subsequent  contract  packages \nwithout  prior  ADB  review  and  approval.  In  these  cases  the  following  post  facto  approval \nprocedures  will  apply:  (i)  the  SRRDA  will  retain  a  record  of  all  procurement  documentation, \nincluding  copies  of  the  signed  contracts  and  the  bid  evaluation  reports,  to  be  available  for \ninspection; (ii) at the time of each contract award, the SRRDA will provide ADB with a certified \nsummary sheet reporting on the main aspects of the bid evaluation and contract award; (iii) the \nprocurement processes and contract awards will be audited annually as part of the performance \naudit; and (iv) if any contract award is found to be unacceptable, ADB may refuse to finance the \ncontract. \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Procurement Action and Retroactive Financing \n\n54. \nAt  the  second  Management  Review  Meeting,  ADB  management  approved  (i)  advance \naction  for  procurement  of  civil  works,  and  (ii)  the  request  to  seek  ADB  Board\u2019s  approval  for \nretroactive  financing,  both,  for  each  of  the  individual  loans  under  the  MFF.  Up  to  20%  of  the \nproceeds  of  each  individual  loan,  provided  that  expenditures  are  incurred  for  civil  works  and \nconsulting services eligible for financing under the MFF in accordance with agreed procedures \nand  during  the  12  months  before  the  signing  of  the  corresponding  individual  loan  agreement, \nwill  be  eligible  for  retroactive  financing.  The  Government  has  been  informed  that  approval  of \nadvance  procurement  action  and  retroactive  financing  does  not  in  any  way  commit  ADB  to \nfinance the subprojects. \n \n\n6. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n55. \nConsulting  services  will  assist  the  EAs  and  the  SRRDAs  to  implement  the  Investment \nProgram.  Government-financed  PICs  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  PMGSY  procedures \nfound  acceptable  to  ADB  and  will  assist  the  PIUs  of  the  SRRDAs  in  (i)  preparing  additional \nsubprojects; (ii) supervising civil works; (iii) implementing the CPF to address social impacts, if \nany; and (iv) implementing the EAF and the relevant provisions of the ECOP. Outline terms of \nreference for the PICs are in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n \nNRRDA  will  engage  ADB  loan-financed  TSCs  to  provide  technical  support  to  the \n56. \nSRRDAs  in  social  and  environmental  safeguards,  and  road  safety.  The  TSC  will  comprise  a \nteam of domestic experts who will (i) conduct checking of detailed project reports and random \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15\n\n \n\nchecks  of  roads  under  construction  to  ensure  that  road  safety  measures  are  properly \nincorporated;  (ii)  provide  support  to  the  PIUs  in  implementing  road  safety  awareness-raising \nschemes being developed under the RRSI; (iii) check compliance of subprojects with CPF and \nEAF/ECOP  provisions  during  subproject  preparation  and  implementation;  and  (iv)  conduct \nimpact monitoring. For each individual state, the TSC will require 12 person-months of inputs for \nthe  first  batch,  and  11  person-months  of  inputs  for  subsequent  batches.  Outline  terms  of \nreference for the TSC are in Supplementary Appendix E.   \n \nAll  consultants  financed  by  the  loans  under  the  MFF  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in \n57. \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  for \nrecruitment  of  domestic  consultants  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  domestic  consultants  will  be \nselected and engaged in accordance with procedures acceptable to ADB, and the selection and \nengagement of the consultants will be subject to ADB approval with regard to their competence \nand experience for carrying out the assignment. As soon as the proposals received have been \nevaluated  but  before  negotiations  are  started  with  the  consultants  selected  for  negotiations, \nADB will be provided with three copies of (i) a list of consultants invited, (ii) an evaluation of the \nproposals  (together  with  one  set  of  the  first-ranked  proposal),  and  (iii)  justification  for  the \nselection. After the conclusion of negotiations but before the signing of the contract, the contract \nas negotiated will be provided to ADB for approval. Promptly after the contract is signed, ADB \nwill  be  provided  with  three  copies  of  the  signed  contract.  If  any  substantial  amendment  of  the \ncontract is proposed after its execution, the proposed changes will be submitted to ADB for prior \napproval.  \n \n\n7. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nits  commitment \n\nto  and  discussed  with \n\nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998)  was  explained \n\nthe \n58. \nGovernment.  Consistent  with \nto  good  governance,  accountability  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Projects  under  the  MFF.  To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan \nregulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Projects  under  the  MFF.  In  particular,  all \ncontracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  MFF  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the \nright  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all \ncontractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Projects \nunder the MFF. \n \n\n8. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n59. \nLoan  disbursements  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n(2001) and Interim Guidelines for Disbursement Operations, LIBOR-Based Loan Product (2002) \nusing direct payment and reimbursement procedures. Any individual payment to be reimbursed \nunder statement of expenditure procedures will not exceed $100,000. \n \n\n9. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n60. \nThe  existing  financial  management  arrangements  with  the  autonomous  SRRDA \nentrusted  with  administering  the  PMGSY  funds  and  the  OMMAS  as  a  comprehensive  online \nmonitoring  tool  have  been  assessed  and  found  to  be  capable  of  adequately  accounting  for \nproject resources and expenditures, with the Government\u2019s continued support to improve state \narrangements.  Projects  to  be  financed  under  the  MFF  will  rely  on  the  existing  financial \nmanagement  arrangements  with  specific  requirements  listed  in  the  following  paragraphs. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n \n\n \n\nFinancial  management  assessment  of  the  three  participating  states  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix F.  \n \n61.  \nThe EAs and SRRDAs will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify \nthe  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  the  expenditures  incurred  for  the \nInvestment Program components and their subprojects under each individual project, and use of \nlocal funds under each individual Project. These accounts and related financial statements will \nbe audited annually in accordance with sound auditing standards by independent auditors. The \nGovernment will submit to ADB within 9 months after the end of each fiscal year consolidated \nannual audited reports and related financial statements under each Project, identifying separate \naccounts of subprojects as required for the individual states. The auditor\u2019s opinion of that part of \nthe  examination  relating  to  the  statement  of  expenditure  should  be  separately  set  out  in  the \nauditor\u2019s opinion. Since the PMGSY guidelines require state governments to engage chartered \naccountants  of  standing  to  audit  PMGSY  accounts,  wherever  possible  the  same  auditors  that \naudit the SRRDA will audit Project accounts in each state.  \n \nIn  addition,  state  governments  will  be  required  to  undertake  an  objective  and \n62. \nindependent  performance  audit  of  subprojects  on  a  sample  basis  to  evaluate  adherence  to \nprocurement procedures, overall contract performance, and value for money. ADB will conduct \nprocurement audits during implementation as part of its regular review process. \n \n63. \nThe  SRRDAs  will  submit  to  MORD,  through  the  relevant  state  government,  monthly \nprogress reports of subproject implementation under the road connectivity component, in such \nform  and  detail  as  required.  Day-to-day  reporting  from  the  PIUs  through  the  SRRDAs  to \nMORD/NRRDA  will  be  by  way  of  the  existing  OMMAS.  Based  on  these  reports,  MORD,  with \nassistance  from  NRRDA,  will  prepare  and  provide  ADB  with  quarterly  progress  reports  on \nsubproject  implementation.  Such  reports  will  include  a  report  on  progress  made  during  the \nperiod  of  review,  changes  if  any  of  the  implementation  schedule,  problems  or  difficulties \nencountered and remedial actions taken, and work to be undertaken in the coming quarter. The \nreports, which will be submitted to ADB within 45 days of the close of each quarter, will include \na  summary  financial  account  for  each  subproject,  expenditures  to  date,  and  report  on  benefit \nmonitoring. \n \n64. \nThe  Government  will  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report  within  3  months  of \nphysical  completion  of  the  subprojects  financed  under  each  individual  loan  and  an  MFF \ncompletion  report  within  3  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  subprojects  under  the  MFF. \nThese  reports  will  include  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  project  and  the  Investment  Program, \nrespectively, covering the design, costs, contractors\u2019 and consultants\u2019 performance, social and \neconomic  impact,  economic  rate  of  return,  and  other  details  relating  to  each  individual \nProject/Investment Program for each state as may be requested by ADB.  \n \n\n10. \n\nPerformance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n65. \nExisting PMGSY planning and monitoring procedures provide a substantial database for \nall roads, including details of traffic before improvement, population served, and social facilities \nalong the alignment, and the progress of individual road works to help establish baseline data \nfor  monitoring  the  indicators  at  the  outcome  and  impact  levels  of  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework  (Appendix  1).  MORD  has  also  been  conducting  impact  assessment  studies  in \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17\n\n \n\nselected  PMGSY  participating  states.24  Performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  under  each \nProject  and  under  the  Investment  Program  will  utilize  this  existing  setup,  and  strengthen  the \nmonitoring of key impact and outcome indicators and associated assumptions. For this purpose, \nwithin 3 months of the effective date of the first loan agreement, MORD through the SRRDAs \nwill carry out the necessary arrangement for systematic performance monitoring, integrated with \nthe OMMAS, for the Investment Program as well as for each Project under the MFF.  \n \n\n11. \n\nReview \n\n66. \nIn addition to regular reviews including a midterm review for each loan by ADB staff, a \ndetailed midterm review of the Investment Program will identify any problems or weaknesses in \nimplementation  arrangements,  and  agree  on  any  changes  needed  to  achieve  the  Investment \nProgram  objectives.  The  midterm  review  will  be  conducted  during  the  third  year  of \nimplementation;  terms  of  reference  will  be  included  in  the  MFF  administration  memorandum \nprepared by ADB\u2019s inception mission for the MFF. Overall Investment Program preparation and \nimplementation flow is shown in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n\nIV. \n\nINVESTMENT PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nOverall Impacts and Benefits \n\n67. \nADB  support  to  the  Investment  Program  will  help  the  Government  meet  the  target  set \nunder Bharat Nirman to provide universal connectivity to habitations with a population of 1,000 \n(500 in the case of hilly or tribal areas) or more by 2010. Improving rural connectivity is also a \npriority  in  the  selected  states.  Economic  activity  is  constrained  if  the  movement  of  people, \ngoods, and services is constrained. Many communities in the target states have been isolated \nfor  years.  Existing  roads  require  rehabilitation.  Although  the  program  focuses  on  new \ninfrastructure, part of the investments will improve existing networks. This approach arrests the \ndepreciation  of  fundamentally  sound  assets,  and  delivers  economies  of  scale\u2014rehabilitation \ncosts will come down if the contracts are mixed with the construction of new assets.  \n \n68.  \nThe Investment Program will contribute to the economic well-being of rural communities \nin  the  selected  states,  and  thus  reduce  poverty.  Agriculture  will  benefit.  Agricultural  input \ndistribution will be easier, as will the dispatch of final products to market. The cost of distributing \ninputs  and  final  products  will  decrease.  Greater  and  better  access  to  markets  will  inevitably \nmake  a  difference,  with  farm  income  expected  to  increase  as  a  result.  But  greater  market \naccess  will also  fuel  competition  and  benefit  customers.  Better  connectivity  will  make  it  easier \nfor investors. More inward investment, especially in agribusiness, will have a positive impact on \njobs  and  income.  Construction  and  wholesale  and  retail  trade  will  increase,  together  with \nhousing and selected public utilities such as rural water, communications, and electricity. Labor \nmobility benefits rural and urban areas alike. The exodus of the young to the city is expected to \ndecrease. This will create impetus for more and better education and health services.25 \n \n\n                                                 \n24 Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Mizoram, Orissa, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and West \n\nBengal. \n\n25  ADB\u2019s  recent  studies  on  the  impact  of  infrastructure  on  poverty  reduction  (Cook,  C.,  T.  Duncan,  W.  Guobao,  S. \nJitsuchon,  and  A.  Sharma.  2005.  Assessing  the  Impact  of  Transport  and  Energy  Infrastructure  on  Poverty \nReduction.  Manila:  ADB)  confirmed  that  the  impacts  of  past  rural  transport  improvements  in  India  include  the \nfollowing:  (i)  travel  time  savings,  (ii)  increased  employment  opportunities  and  higher  wages,  (iii)  increased \navailability  and  accessibility  of  educational  and  health  services,  (iv)  reduced  vulnerability  of  the  poor,  and  (v) \npositive effect on participation of the poor in activities outside the rural community. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n \n\n \n\nB. \n\nSustainability of Investment \n\n69. \nThe investment proposed will be sustainable as the PMGSY design requires a high level \nof  commitment  by  the  participating states  to  finance  post-construction road  maintenance.  Two \nkey  requirements  are  effectively  linked  with  MORD\u2019s  approval  of  states\u2019  project  proposals:  (i) \nmandatory use of the standard bidding document for civil works with a 5-year post-construction \nmaintenance component, and (ii) written commitment required of the states to allocate funds for \nthis  component  in  their  state  budget.  Signing  civil  works  contracts  with  a  maintenance \ncomponent  obligates  states  to  allocate  funds  to  meet  the  maintenance  expenditure.  For \nFY2005, the three participating states budgeted and allocated the required maintenance funds. \nDuring Investment Program implementation, states\u2019 commitment and actual budget allocation to \n5-year maintenance will be closely monitored. The state governments also provided assurances \nthat  they  will  enter  into  contractual  commitments  to  maintain  the  entire  PMGSY  rural  road \nnetwork,  including  the  Investment  Program  roads,  for  the  subsequent  5  years.  A  simple  and \npractical maintenance planning process based on the pavement condition index will be used to \ndetermine maintenance priority.      \n \nC. \n\nSustainability of Policy and Institutional Interventions \n\n70. \nThe  Investment  Program  is  not  new  to  India  or  ADB.  Rural  and  nonrural  roads  have \nbeen financed many times in the past, with and without ADB involvement. The country and the \nindividual  states  have  considerable  expertise  in  the  subsector.  This  track  record  covers \nplanning,  design,  and  implementation  of  operations.  It  addresses  procurement,  safeguards, \nfinancial  management,  administration,  contract  supervision,  and  monitoring.  National  systems, \nthose developed for PMGSY in particular, are quite sophisticated in each of these areas and the \nlevel  of  oversight  appears  to  be  high  compared  with  many  other  countries  in  which  ADB \noperates. The Projects under the MFF will adopt many of these systems found compatible with \nADB  requirements.  The  differences  between  the  PMGSY  requirements  and  the  requirements \nspecific  to  the  Projects  under  the  MFF  have  been  narrowed.  Interventions  specific  to  the \nProjects  under  the  MFF  are  limited  to  the  areas  of  road  safety,  and  social  and  environmental \nsafeguards.  Even  in  these  areas,  ADB  interventions  are  aligned  with  the  existing  PMGSY \ninitiatives. \n   \n71. \nThe longer term objective of ADB interventions will be to leave in place systems, people, \nand  procedures  that  can  outlive  the  Investment  Program  itself.  The  central  and  state \ngovernments  are  especially  keen  on  this  approach  and  accordingly  provided  assurances  to \nwork  with  ADB  toward  this  endeavor.  The  central  Government  will  continuously  improve  the \nPMGSY  standard  operating  procedures  and  provide  training  to  state  officials  involved  in \nPMGSY implementation. \n \nD. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n72. \nQuantifiable economic benefits consist of (i) lower transport and vehicle operating costs, \n(ii) greater passenger time savings, and (iii) reduced spoilage of agricultural inputs and produce. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated by comparing the with- and without-\ninvestment scenarios for about 3,200 km of the first batch subproject roads in the three states. To \nhave  EIRRs  on  ensured  benefits, only the  first  two  types  of benefits were considered in the \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19\n\n \n\neconomic analysis. Without the investment, transport cost to and from rural habitations will remain \nvery high. With the investment, transport costs will be significantly reduced, leading to savings for \nexisting  traffic,  rapid  growth  in  generated  traffic,  and  a  shift  in  traffic  composition  toward  more \nefficient modes. \n \n73. \nThe  estimated  overall  EIRR  for  the  sample  subprojects  is  18.0%;  the  overall  EIRRs  for \nAssam, Orissa, and West Bengal are 15.6%, 18.0%, and 20.2%, respectively. Sensitivity analysis \nshows  that  the  proposed  investment  will  remain  economically  viable  under  adverse  scenarios, \nincluding  increased  costs,  decreased  benefits,  and  implementation  delays.  The  economic  and \ndistribution analysis is in Supplementary Appendix H. \n \nE. \n\nSocial Impact \n\n1. \n\nPoverty Reduction \n\nThe states of Assam, Orissa, and West Bengal have a large rural population26 with the \n74.  \nmajority  dependent  on  agriculture  for  their  livelihood.  Despite  the  improvements  during  the \nrecent decade, these states are still among the poorest in India in terms of various development \nindicators.  Poverty  is  particularly  acute  in  rural  areas.  In  terms  of  the  proportion  of  rural \npopulation living below the poverty line, Orissa ranks at the top at 48%, Assam 3rd at 40%, and \nWest  Bengal  12th  at  32%,  all  above  the  national  average  of  26%.  Indeed,  the  total  rural \npopulation living below the poverty line in the three states accounts for 21.5% of that of India, \nhigher  than  the  three  states\u2019  share  in  India  in  terms  of  rural  population  (15.4%)  and  total \npopulation (14.1%).  \n \n75.  \nThe  provision  of  all-weather  roads  in  rural  areas  will  lead  to  increased  access  to  rural \nmarkets  and  rapid  economic  diversification  increasing  the  incomes  of  farmers  in  all  income \ngroups. Farmers will benefit from reduced cost of supply of agricultural inputs. This will increase \nthe  size  of  the  agricultural  surplus  contributing  to  increase  in  income,  which  will  be  spent  on \nother  goods  and  services.  Improved  access  will  lead  to  greater  mobility  enabling  rural \ncommunities  to  shift  from  subsistence  farming  to  more  commercially-oriented  agricultural \nproduction. Production and marketing of high-value perishable products will become possible on \na  commercial  basis.  Increased  mobility  will  support  poor  households  to  access  better  paying \njobs  outside  their  villages.  The  improvement  of  connectivity  is  also  expected  to  encourage \ninvestments  in  nonagricultural  enterprises  and  larger  investments  in  transport  services. \nCommunities  with  all-weather  roads  will  attract  assistance  from  government  programs  and \ndistrict poverty reduction projects. The Investment Program is expected to have  an immediate \nand short-term impact on poverty reduction due to labor opportunities for rural poor who will be \nhired  during  construction.  Another  major  benefit  will  be  reliable  access  to  schools  and  health \nservices  through  reduced  travel  time  and  transportation  costs,  contributing  directly  to  the \naccumulation  of  human  capital,  which  is  a  key  factor  in  sustainable  poverty  reduction.  The \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 12. \n \n\n2. \n\nGender Impacts \n\n76.   Women in both poor and non-poor households in rural areas are disadvantaged by low \nstatus in households and communities in terms of access and control. The status of women is \n\n                                                 \n26  The proportion of population living in rural areas is at 88% in Assam, and 83% in Orissa\u2014much higher than that of \nall India at 72%. West Bengal has the same proportion of rural population as all India, but in absolute number, its \nrural population of 56.5 million is larger than that in Assam and Orissa combined.   \n\n \n\n\f20 \n \n\n \n\nbetter in West Bengal compared with the other two states. Gender assessment carried out as \npart  of  social  and  poverty  assessment  found  that  the  Investment  Program  will  improve \nconnectivity to nearby towns and villages, thereby increasing access to health and educational \nservices.  Better  transport  services  will  open  up  opportunities  for  more  girls  to  access  higher \neducation  outside  the  village.  Improved  rural  roads  will  also  contribute  to  safe  motherhood  by \naugmenting access to medical facilities outside the village and reducing obstacles to improved \nhealth services within the village. Women noted that better roads would make travel safer and \nmore  comfortable  as  presently  they  travel  on  foot;  improved  roads  will  also  mean  increased \ntransportation facilities, which will enable them to travel at all times. \n \n\n3. \n\nLand Availability  \n\n77.      The  construction  of  rural  roads  will  be  carried  out  mostly  within  existing  right-of-way, \nhowever in some cases, straightening of alignment will require narrow strips of land to be made \navailable.  The  survey  carried  in  the  sample  roads  in  the  three  states  revealed  that  the  impact \ndue to land take will be mostly on marginal farmers.27 West Bengal and Assam will face loss of \nresidential and commercial structures28 by both titled and nontitled households. Transect walks \nundertaken for the sample subprojects demonstrated that, through design modification, impacts \non  structures  could  be  mostly  minimized.  A  similar  exercise  will  be  carried  out  for  other \nsubprojects, with the impacts on structures expected to be minimized. \n \n78.      Most  of  the  adverse  social  impacts  will  be  mitigated  by  the  selection  of  alternative \nalignments  and  design  modifications.  However,  if  extra  land  must  be  secured  for  specific \nsubprojects,  the  voluntary  land  donation  system  will  be  used,  recognizing  the  effectiveness  of \nthe  system  for  rural  road  developments  in  India.  The  procedural  requirements  are  provided  in \nthe  resettlement  and  participation  framework  developed  for  the  World  Bank-financed  Rural \nRoads Project. Under the MFF, ADB requirements will be harmonized with those of the World \nBank with necessary adjustments in consideration of the specific situations of the participating \nstates. A CPF, which incorporates key elements of the resettlement and participation framework \ntogether  with  necessary  adjustments  to  it,  was  developed  for  each  of  the  three  participating \nstates for project preparation and implementation. The CPF adopts road selection criteria similar \nto those of the World Bank\u2019s resettlement and  participation framework, in which rural roads in \nquestion will not be financed until relevant social issues are resolved. The outline of the CPF is \nin  Appendix  7.  The  EAs  will  ensure  that  the  road  selection  criteria,  process  for  community \nparticipation, and documentation requirements comply with the CPF principles and procedures.  \n \n79.      Implementation of this system needs to be monitored closely. The internal monitoring will \nbe carried out by the PIUs with support of the PIC, and external monitoring will be carried by the \nTSC appointed by NRRDA for each of the states. These arrangements are introduced on a pilot \nbasis. ADB will review effectiveness of these arrangements jointly with the Government and the \nWorld Bank at an appropriate time during implementation, and appropriate modifications to the \nsafeguard frameworks made as required. In addition to this ongoing monitoring, ADB will closely \nreview the sample subprojects and an additional 100 km of roads from each state. Based on the \ninitial review, ADB will discuss any revisions and agreements for corrective action before finally \ndelegating subproject approving authority to MORD. \n \n                                                 \n27  In  West  Bengal,  46%  of  affected  agricultural  households  were  marginal  farmers,  30%  in  Orissa,  and  2.6%  in \n\nAssam.  \n\n28  In  West  Bengal,  3  residential  and  1  commercial  structures  are  affected.  In  Assam,  105  residential  and  12 \ncommercial structures are affected with impacts mostly on fences and frontages of the homestead land. In Orissa, \nonly 2 residential and 2 commercial structures are affected. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n21\n\n \n\n4. \n\nIndigenous People \n\n80.  \nThe  social assessment  of  the  sample  subprojects  identified  the  presence  of  scheduled \ntribes  in  the  three  states.  These  groups  are  largely  assimilated  into  the  local  population.  The \nInvestment Program will not have any differential impact on scheduled tribe population; they will \nreceive  similar  benefits  from  the  Investment  Program  as  the  non-scheduled-tribe  households. \nNo significant impact will be made on their tribal and cultural identity. The assessment indicates \nthat the rural road construction will benefit scheduled tribe households by providing connectivity \nto  habitations  and  increasing  access  to  better  facilities  in  health,  education,  and  markets.  In \naddition, the Investment Program is expected to open up alternate opportunities for employment \nin nearby towns thereby diversifying their sources of income. As stipulated in the CPF, for any \nimpact on land involving traditional and tenurial rights of the scheduled tribes, national and state \nlegal  provisions  pertaining  to  land  transfers  will  be  duly  followed.  The  CPF  identifies  special \nprovisions  for  all  scheduled  tribe  households  to  ensure  that  their  living  standards  are  not \nadversely affected as a result of land donation or in the event of any loss of nonland asset and \nimpacts on their livelihoods.  \n \nF. \n\nEnvironmental Impact \n\nThis Investment Program is categorized as \u201cB\u201d in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental \n81. \ninitial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  of  sample \nAssessment  Guidelines  (2003).  An \nsubprojects  was  prepared  as  part  of  the  detailed  project  reports.  The  IEE  rates  the  physical \ninterventions  of  the  Investment  Program  as  minor;  none  of  the  sample  subprojects  involve \nrealignment or the establishment of new road alignment. The Investment Program activities are \nmostly related to providing black topping of 3.5 meter carriageway and earthen shoulders, and \nside  drains  if  the  roads  run  through  residential  areas.  Based  on  these  activities,  the  predicted \nenvironmental  impacts  occur  mostly  during  construction.  The  characteristics  of  impacts  are \ntemporary and reversible. The mitigation measures are available and can mostly be integrated \ninto construction works. In this context, an ECOP setting out generic mitigation measures to be \nimplemented  throughout  the  investment  cycle,  from  selection  of  the  alignment,  preparation  of \nthe  detail  engineering  design,  construction,  and  operation  is  being  prepared  to  provide \nguidelines for mainstreaming environmental concerns into the development of rural roads. The \nenvironmental assessment of the additional subprojects will follow procedures under the sector \nloan modality. The agreed EAF will govern the preparation and implementation of the additional \nsubprojects. The summary IEE with the EAF is in Appendix 8.  \n \nAlthough  the  environmental  impacts  are  insignificant,  continued  monitoring  to  ensure \n82. \nthat  the  mitigation  measures  are  well  implemented  is  needed.  The  existing  institutional \narrangement to develop rural roads has no setup to address environmental concerns identified \nby  the  IEE  studies.  Therefore,  each  SRRDA  will  assign  an  environment  officer  with  a  primary \nresponsibility  to  mainstream  environmental  concerns  related  to  development  of  rural  roads.  At \nthe  initial  implementation  of  the  Projects  under  the  MFF,  environment  specialists  will  be \nengaged  as  part  of  the  TSC  to  work  closely  with  the  environment  officers  in  the  respective \nstates  to  appraise  additional  subprojects  and  to  monitor  implementation  of  the  mitigation \nmeasures. The environmental checklist, which serves as the IEE, to be prepared as part of the \ndetailed  project  report  for  each  subproject,  will  identify  the  relevant  provisions  of  the  ECOP, \nwhich in turn will serve as an environmental management plan for the subproject, to be adhered \nto  during  subproject  implementation.  ADB  will  provide  special  training  early  in  project \nimplementation to the environment officers as well as to the PIUs of the SRRDAs.  \n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n \n\n \n\nG. \n\nRisks \n\nincluding  procurement,  and  suitably  qualified  core  staff \n\n83. \nThe  risk  of  implementation  delays  has  been  addressed  by  establishing  an  SRRDA  in \neach  state  to  act  as  the  Implementing  Agency.  The  SRRDA  will  have  authority  to  decide  on \nto  manage \nimplementation \nimplementation effectively. MORD will provide the SRRDAs with sufficient resources to engage \nconsultants  and  contractors  to  perform  the  main  engineering  and  civil  works  tasks,  as  well  as \nrequisite social and environmental studies.   \n \n84. \nThe  economic  analysis  of  the  investments  suggests  no  significant  economic  risks. \nSensitivity tests and risk analysis undertaken on sample subprojects show that the subprojects \nselected  in  accordance  with  the  selection  criteria  will  be  economically  viable  even  under  a \ncombination of adverse scenarios.  \n \n85. \nThe  risk  of  adverse  social  and  environmental  impacts  has  been  addressed  through \nexaminations of sample subprojects. Consultations with local stakeholders were made and will \ncontinue during the Investment Program. Support for a program of this nature is universal. The \nrisk of road connectivity improvements leading to increased road accidents are to be addressed \nthrough the capacity-building component.  \n \nThe fiduciary risk under PMGSY will be manageable and addressed mainly through the \n86. \nuse  of  standardized  procedures  in  the  areas  of  procurement,  accounting,  and  reporting.  The \nGovernment  will  continue  providing  training  to  state  government  officials  on  financial \nmanagement and reporting as part of its effort to fully functionalize the OMMAS.  \n \n87. \nADB will address the risk associated with the MFF, which is new to both India and ADB, \nby  ensuring  capacity  of  the  India  Resident  Mission  for  reviewing  and  monitoring  Investment \nProgram  implementation,  particularly  with  respect  to  fiduciary  and  safeguard  oversight,  while \nproviding sufficient support to the Government in the form of an advisory technical assistance in \nthese areas. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n88.  \nIn addition to the standard assurances, the national Government and the governments of \nthe states (Assam, Orissa, and West Bengal at the outset) have given the following assurances, \nwhich  have  largely  been  incorporated  in  the  attached  FFA,  and  will  be  incorporated  in  the \nindividual loan agreement and project agreement(s) as applicable and mutually agreed between \nthe Government and ADB for each Project under the MFF. \n \n\n1. \n\nGeneral \n\n89.       (i)   \n\n \n\n(ii)  \n\n  \n(iii) \n\n \n\nThe  Project  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  PMGSY  guidelines  as \nsupplemented  by  specific  requirements  described  in  the  FFA,  including  those \ndescribed more fully in the agreed CPF and the EAF for the participating states, \nas applicable.  \n\nA Coordination Committee will be set up at MORD to assist in implementation of \nthe Project. \n\nEach participating state will likewise set up a Project implementation committee \nfor implementation of the Project at state levels. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n23\n\n \n\nEach  state  will  assist  in  obtaining  the  requisite  approvals  and  clearances  for  timely \n\n90. \nimplementation of the Project. \n \n91. \nEach  state  will  provide,  as  necessary,  respective  counterpart  staff,  land  facilities,  and \ncounterpart  funding  for  the  Project  in  accordance  with  the  financing  plan;  cost  of  making  land \navailable for the subprojects and assistance, and implementation and monitoring under the CPF \nand  EAF  (including  unforeseen  expenses  beyond  the  estimates);  utility  relocation;  general \nproject  management  expenses;  and  road  maintenance  in  a  timely  manner  through  approved \nannual budget allocations. \n \n92.   Each  state  will  ensure  that  the  respective  IAs  will  recruit  PICs  with  expertise  in  social \ndevelopment and environmental management to help implement the provisions of the CPF and \nthe EAF for all subprojects in the related state. \n \n\n2. \n\nRoad Maintenance \n\nIn accordance with the PMGSY guidelines, the states will provide adequate and timely \n93. \nfunding for proper maintenance of the PMGSY roads. Any increases in the actual amounts to be \nprovided  will  be  met  by  the  respective  state  through  additional  budget  allocations,  or  other \nalternative sources of financing.  \n \n94. \nAs also required under the PMGSY guidelines, except as ADB may otherwise agree, the \nstates  will  require  the  respective  IAs  (through  the  PIUs)  to  ensure  proper  maintenance  of  the \nPMGSY roads until these are transferred to the designated zilla panchayats in accordance with \nthe  PMGSY  guidelines.  The  states  will  also  allocate  the  requisite  funds  to  the  relevant \nfunctionaries  (the  related  PIU/zilla  panchayat)  for  such  maintenance  in  accordance  with  the \nrequirements of the PMGSY Guidelines. \n \nThe states will ensure that related PIU/zilla panchayat, as the case may be in each state, \n95.  \nwill  enter  into  further  maintenance  contracts  with  competitively  procured  contractors  (on  the \nbasis  of  the  standard  performance-based  contracts  for  road  maintenance  prepared  by  project \nmanagement consultant under ADB funded RRSI. The contracts will begin upon completion of \nthe  initial  5-year  maintenance  period  under  the  related  construction  contracts  and  will  cover \nroutine  maintenance  and  renewal  of  all  PMGSY  roads  for  further  periods  of  not  less  than  5 \nyears. \n \n\n3. \n\nRoad Safety \n\n96. \nAs  part  of  the  midterm  review  of  the  Investment  Program  as  also  under  each  Project, \nMORD, the states, and ADB will review the outcomes of the road safety program, to consolidate \nthe  institutional  mechanism,  financing  modalities,  and  detailed  implementing  arrangements  to \nfurther ensure sustainable road safety programs for the roads to be developed under PMGSY \nand the Investment Program at the national and state levels. \n \n\n4. \n\nLand Availability  \n\n97. \nThe  states  will  ensure  that  the  respective  IAs  implement  the  relevant  provisions  of  the \nCPF for all subprojects as agreed upon with ADB and in conformity with all applicable laws and \nregulations of the Government/respective state government. \n  \n\n \n\n\f24 \n \n\n \n\nThe states will ensure that the IAs will, subject to compliance with the relevant provisions \n98. \nof  the  CPF  and  EAF/ECOP  and  in  accordance  with  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of  the \nGovernment/respective state government, acquire or make available the land and rights to land \nfree from any encumbrances, and clear the utilities, trees, and any other obstruction from such \nland,  required  for  commencement  of  construction  activities  in  accordance  with  the  schedule \nagreed under the related civil works contract. \n \n99. \nThe states will ensure that (i) the  respective  IAs  will  (a)  carry  out  the  community \nconsultation  process  for  all  subprojects  in  accordance  with  the  PMGSY  Guidelines  as \nsupplemented  by \nland \ntransfer/availability  as  the  case  may  be,  support/assistance  provisions,  and  grievance \nprocedures to the project-affected communities in a timely manner so that all related issues are \nresolved  before  awarding  civil  work  contracts;  and  (c)  ensure  that  in  case  of  voluntary  land \ndonations/transfer, these are undertaken in a transparent manner under proper documentation, \nand avoid any kind of coercion or forced donations/transfer; and in this regard will not exercise \nany eminent domain or related mechanisms that may be deemed to be compulsory acquisition \nof land; and  (ii)the details of land made available in accordance with the procedures prescribed \nin  the  PMGSY  Guidelines,  are  reflected  in  the  local  land  records  in  a  timely  manner  and  not \nlater than commencement of the related civil works contract under a subproject. \n \n\ninformation  on  process  of \n\n(b)  disseminate \n\nthe  CPF; \n\nthe \n\n5. \n\nExecution of Civil Works Contracts \n\n100.  Subject to compliance with the requirements of CPF and EAF/ECOP, the states will (i) \nacquire  or  make  available  on  a  timely  basis  the  land  and  rights  in  land,  free  from  any \nencumbrances; and (ii) clear the utilities, trees, and any other obstruction from such land, on a \ntimely basis, i.e., strictly in accordance with the schedule as agreed under the related civil works \ncontract, as required for construction activities relating to each section of the related civil works \ncontract under the subproject. \n \n101.  The  states  will  ensure  that,  subsequent  to  award  of  civil  works  contract  under  any \nsubproject, no section or part thereof under the civil works contract will be handed over to the \ncontractor unless the applicable provisions of the CPF and the EAF/ECOP have been complied \nwith. \n \n102.  Any  changes  to  the  land  alignment  or  environment  impacts  on  account  of  detailed \ndesigns of related subproject roads will be subject to prior approval by ADB or related agency \n(MORD) as the case may be in accordance with the subproject selection criteria and procedures \nincluded in Appendix 4. \n \n\n6. \n\nSocial Impacts \n\n103.  The states will ensure (i) through specific provisions in the bid documents and the civil \nworks  contracts  under  each  individual  Project  under  the  MFF  that  the  contractors  will  (a) \ndisseminate  information  at  work  sites  on  the  risks  of  sexually  transmitted  diseases  and \nHIV/AIDS as part of the health and safety measures for those employed during construction; (b) \nfollow  legally  mandated  provisions  on  health,  sanitation,  and  appropriate  working  conditions, \nincluding accommodation, where appropriate, for construction workers at camp sites; (c) comply \nwith all applicable labor laws, not employ child labor for construction and maintenance activities, \nand  provide  appropriate  facilities  for  children  of  laborers  in  construction  campsites;  and  (d) \nprovide  equal  opportunities  for  women  for  road  construction  activities,  and  not  differentiate \nwages for men and women for work of equal value; and (ii) that compliance with provisions in \n\n\f \n\n \n\n25\n\n \n\nclause (i) of this paragraph is monitored by the respective IAs. The civil works contracts will also \nprovide for their termination by the employer for breach of any provision. \n \n104.  The  states  will  ensure  acceptance  of  the  Project  through  effective  community \nparticipation  in  selecting  and  implementing  subprojects  in  accordance  with  the  PMGSY \nGuidelines as supplemented by the CPF. \n \n105. \nIn case of any significant or related impacts on scheduled tribes under any subproject, \nthese will follow the requirements as set out in the CPF as agreed by ADB (the CPF lays down \nspecial provisions for all scheduled tribe households to ensure that their living standards are not \nadversely affected as a result of land donation or in the event of any loss of non-land asset and \nimpacts  on  their  livelihoods).  As  also  laid  down  in  the  CPF,  for  any  impact  on  land  involving \ntraditional  and  tenurial  rights  of  the  scheduled  tribes,  the  legal  provisions  laid  down  by  the \nGovernment and the state governments pertaining to transfer of land will be duly followed.  \n \n\n7. \n\nEnvironment  \n\n106.  ADB  will  only  finance  subprojects  that  meet  the  eligibility  requirements  set  out  in \nAppendix 4, and that adhere to relevant requirements of the PMGSY Guidelines, the CPF, the \nEAF, and other applicable guidelines for subproject implementation. The states will monitor the \nimplementation of subprojects through to their completion of each subproject.   \n \n107.  The  states  will  ensure  that  (i)  subprojects  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  the \nEAF; and (ii) relevant provisions of the ECOP identified in the subproject preparation stage are \nincorporated  into  the  subproject  designs  and  followed  during  subproject  design,  construction, \noperation, and maintenance.  \n \n108.

It  serves  a  land  area  of  3.3 \n1. \nmillion square kilometers (km2) and consists mainly of roads, railways, and air services. Inland \nwater transport plays a small role in some states and has a total traffic share of 0.15%. In the \npast,  railways  were  the  predominant  transport  mode.  In  1960,  railways  carried  85%  of  goods \ntraffic  (in  ton  km)  and  51%  of  passenger  traffic  (in  passenger  km).  By  2001,  the  figures  had \ndeclined  to  32%  of  goods  and  13%  of  passenger  traffic.  Road  transport  is  now  the  dominant \nmode  and  accounts  for  68%  of  goods  traffic  (in  ton  km)  and  87%  of  passenger  traffic  (in \npassenger km).  \n \nB. \n\nStatus of Roads Subsector and Government Strategy  \n\n1. \n\nCurrent Status \n\n2. \nIndia\u2019s road network mainly consists of three categories of roads: (i) about 60,000 km of \nnational  highways,  (ii)  about  600,000  km  of  the  secondary  system  comprising  state  highways \nand major district roads, and (iii) about 2.7 million km of the tertiary system mainly consisting of \nrural  roads.  The  total  road  length  is  estimated  to  be  about  3.4  million  km.  National  highways \nprovide the high-density links between states. They comprise only 2% of the network but carry \nabout 40% of traffic. State highways link national highways with district headquarters, important \ntowns,  and  minor  ports;  and  major  district  roads  run  within  districts,  connecting  areas  of \nproduction  with  markets,  and  rural  areas  to  district  headquarters  and  to  state  highways  and \nnational  highways.  The  secondary  system  comprises  about  18%  of  the  network  and  carries \nabout  40%  of  traffic.  Rural  roads  link  rural  communities  with  the  highway  network,  providing \naccess  to  higher  agricultural  incomes,  employment  opportunities,  and  social  services.  They \nrepresent about 80% of the network and carry about 20% of traffic. \n \n3. \nThe  sustained  underinvestment  in  road  infrastructure  in  India  has  affected  all  levels  of \nthe road network.1 The national highways and the secondary system had not been able to meet \nthe  rapid  traffic  growth.  In  the  road  subsector,  freight  traffic  increased  at  about  12%  per  year \nand  passenger  traffic  at  about  8%  in  the  past  decade.  The  rapid  growth  in  traffic  led  to \ncongestion,  road  deterioration,  and  high  costs  of  transport.  Widespread  overloading  of  freight \nvehicles  damages  the  road  pavement.  Mixed  use  of  the  roadway  by  both  motorized  and \nnonmotorized  vehicles  (bicycles,  animal-drawn  vehicles,  etc.)  causes  congestion  and  high \nlevels  of  traffic  accidents.  In  rural  areas,  where  70%  of  India\u2019s  population  lives,  many  villages \nstill rely on earth tracks that are unsuitable for motorized traffic and become impassable during \nthe  rainy  season  due  to  the  poorly  finished  road  surface;  missing  bridges;  and  inadequate, \ndefective,  or  missing  drainage  structure.  Even  where  all-weather  connections  have  been \nprovided, the standard of rural roads is low, maintenance is poor, and many roads are in need \nof rehabilitation. \n \nImproving  the  road  transport  network  is  important  for  the  economic  development  and \n4. \nsocial integration of the country. Providing rural areas with all-weather roads is a key component \nof rural development and economic growth, and will significantly improve the quality of life of the \nmajority of the people. Roads have considerable impacts on poverty reduction as they lead to \n\n                                                 \n1   Since  the  6th  five-year  plan,  1980\u20131985,  annual  investments  in  roads  varied  between  0.6%  and  1.5%  of  gross \n\ndomestic product, with an average of 1.1%. \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n31\n\nhigher  agricultural  incomes,  increased  productive  employment  opportunities,  and  improved \naccess to economic and social services. \n \n\n2. \n\nGovernment Strategy  \n\n5. \nThe main objective for the road subsector in the Government\u2019s 10th plan (2002\u20132007) is \nthe  balanced  development  of  the  total  road  network,  which  includes  adding  capacity  by \nwidening  roadways,  improving  riding  quality,  strengthening  road  safety  measures,  and \nestablishing  wayside  amenities.  Two  major  investment  initiatives  are  being  implemented.  The \nfirst is the National Highway Development Project comprising the 6,000 km golden quadrilateral \nlinking  Delhi,  Mumbai,  Chennai,  and  Kolkata;  and  the  7,300  km  north\u2013south,  east\u2013west \ncorridors from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and Silchar to Porbandar. This project, which is being \nimplemented  by  the  National  Highway  Authority  of  India,  envisages  creating  four/six-lanes  on \nthe  existing  network  at  a  cost  of  Rs540  billion  ($11  billion).  Financing  comes  from  earmarked \nexcise duty (cess)2 on petrol and diesel, multilateral funding, budgetary allocations, and market \nborrowing.  \n \n6. \nThe  second  major  initiative  is  the  Pradhan  Mantri  Gram  Sadak  Yojana  (PMGSY),  the \nPrime Minister\u2019s Rural Roads Program, established in 2000, which has the overall objective of \nconnecting  rural  habitations  with  populations  of  500  or  more  to  all-weather  roads  by  2007. \nRecently,  the  Government  announced  a  revised  time  frame  for  achieving  rural  connectivity \nunder an umbrella program for rebuilding rural infrastructure called Bharat Nirman.3 The revised \ntarget  to  achieve  connectivity  to  all  habitations  with  a  population  of  1,000  (500  in  the  case  of \nhilly or tribal areas) by 2009 would require about Rs480 billion ($11 billion) from the fiscal year \n(FY) 2006 to 2010. Financing is being provided from earmarked cess, multilateral funding, and \nbudgetary  allocations.  The  Government  is  also  considering  mobilizing  additional  resources \nthrough domestic borrowing.  \n \nC. \n\nRural Roads Subsector  \n\n1. \n\nCurrent Status \n\nThe tertiary road network in India comprises about 2.7 million km; the majority are rural \n7. \nroads.  The  rural  road  network  consists  of  zilla  parishad  roads,  gram  panchayat  roads,4  and \ncommunity roads. Following the 73rd Constitutional Amendment in 1992, state governments are \nto assign responsibility for management of rural roads to the panchayati raj institutions and to \nremit necessary financial resources for this  purpose. This has not yet been fully implemented. \nMost of the states still retain the rural roads under their responsibility. Due to this ambiguity in \nresponsibility and lack of mechanisms to systematically assess the conditions of the rural roads, \ntheir status is not well inventoried and only partially recorded in government statistics. According \n\n                                                 \n2   The  Central  Road  Fund  Act,  2000  introduced  an  additional  excise  duty  (cess)  of  Re1.00  per  liter  on  petrol  and \nRe1.00  on  high-speed  diesel  oil,  to  be  allocated  as  follows:  (i)  50%  of  cess  on  high-speed  diesel  to  the \ndevelopment of rural roads; and (ii) 50% of cess on high-speed diesel and 100% of cess on petrol to development \nand  maintenance  of  national  highways,  road  bridges  under  or  over  railway  lines  and  safety  work  at  unstaffed \nrailway crossings, and development and maintenance of state roads. The cess on high-speed diesel was increased \nto Rs1.5 per liter in 2003. \n\n3  The  finance  minister,  in  his  budget  speech  on  28  February  2005,  designated  rural  roads  as  one  of  the  six \ncomponents  of  Bharat  Nirman  (meaning  Laying  the  foundation  for  India).  The  other  proposed  components  are \nirrigation, rural housing, rural water supply, rural electrification, and rural telecommunication connectivity. \n\n4   A  panchayat  is  a  body  of  directly  elected  people  responsible  for  development  of  activities  in  an  area.  The  three \nlevels  of  panchayat  comprise  gram  panchayat  at  village  level,  intermediate  panchayat  at  block  level,  and  zilla \npanchayat at district level. These panchayats collectively called \u201cpanchayati raj institutions.\u201d \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 2  \n\nto  statistics  published  by  the  Ministry  of  Shipping,  Road  Transport,  and  Highways,  of  412,600 \nkm gram panchayat roads, only 57,300 km (14%) were surfaced in 2002. These figures do not \ncover those roads being added under PMGSY. Table A2.1 shows the status of different types of \nrural roads. \n \n\nTable A2.1: Status of Rural Roads in India \n\nCategory \n\nSurfaced \n(%) \n57 \n14 \n25 \n36 \n20 \n\nTotal Length \n(km) \n499,462 \n412,595 \n148,104 \n1,060,161 \n900,000 \n\nSurfaced Length \n(km) \n283,832 \n57,338 \n37,273 \n378,443 \n183,202 \n\n2.  \n\nRural Roads under PMGSY \n\nZilla Parishad Roads \nVillage Panchayat Roads \nPanchayat Samiti Roads  \nPanchayat Raj Roads Totala \nRural Roads Constructed under Jawahar \nRojgar Yojna \nkm = kilometer.   \na Excludes roads being improved under PMGSY. \nSource: Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport, and Highways website. \n \n \n \nPMGSY  focuses  on  providing  all-weather  connectivity5  to  rural  habitations  that  are \n8. \nlacking  this.  The  road  works  to  be  financed  under  PMGSY  are  to  create  the  \u201clast  1  mile\u201d \nconnectivity  to  villages  in  rural  areas.  A  nationwide  planning  exercise  conducted  in  2000  to \nidentify  unconnected  habitations  and  eligible  roads  under  PMGSY  found  that  in  rural  areas \nwhere  70%  of  India\u2019s  population  lives,  about  330,000  habitations,  40%  of  the  total  850,000 \nhabitations,  were  without  all-weather  road  connectivity.  To  maximize  the  impacts  of  the \ninvestment  under  PMGSY,  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Development  (MORD)  established  criteria  to \ngive priority to habitations with a larger population. The original target was to provide good all-\nweather road connections to all habitations with a population of 1,000 or more by 2003 and to all \nhabitations with a population of 500 or more by 2007. In hilly or desert areas, or scheduled tribe \nareas  as  defined  in  Schedule  V  of  the  Constitution  of  India,  the  objective  is  to  connect  all \nhabitations with a population of at least 250 by 2007. On this basis, PMGSY has identified more \nthan  170,000  unconnected  habitations  requiring  new  road  connectivity  investments  for  about \n370,000  km  of  roads.  Details  of  the  eligible  habitations  under  PMGSY  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix A.  \n \n9. \nThe  level  of  rural  connectivity  varies  significantly  across  the  states.  The  eligible \nunconnected  habitations  under  PMGSY  are  concentrated  in  the  following  10  states:  Assam, \nBihar, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan, Uttar \nPradesh,  and  West  Bengal;  and  account  for  88%  (151,000)  of  the  eligible  habitations  under \nPMGSY  nationwide.  MORD  has  selected  these  states  for  focused  PMGSY  intervention.  The \nfirst Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan, Rural Roads Sector I Project (RRSI), for $400 million \nis to finance PMGSY in the states of Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. The World Bank\u2019s first \nloan-credit  for  $400  million  is  to  finance  PMGSY  in  Himachal  Pradesh,  Jharkhand,  Rajasthan, \nand  Uttar  Pradesh.  The  proposed  Rural  Roads  Sector  II  Investment  Program  is  to  finance \nPMGSY in  Assam, Orissa, and West Bengal. Bihar may be covered under the ongoing World \nBank project. \n \n10. \nKey indicators related to the road subsector of Assam, Orissa, and West Bengal are in \nTable A2.2. Of the three states, Assam has the poorest road network with only 14% of the roads \n                                                 \n5   PMGSY defines an all-weather road as one that is negotiable in all weather conditions, and has adequate cross-\n\ndrainage structures to effectively drain the roadbed. \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n33\n\nsurfaced.

Because PMGSY is a fully Government-sponsored scheme, the financial \n11. \nviability of the program depends on the willingness and ability of the Government to raise and \nallocate funds to effect its delivery and achieve its targets. Full achievement of program targets \nas originally scheduled has been constrained due to limited funding availability. Current estimates \nsuggest  that  the  total  investment  required  to  meet  PMGSY  targets  is  about  Rs1,320  billion \n(approximately  $30  billion).  Based  on  this  estimation,  several  billion  per  year  is  required  to \ndeliver  PMGSY  targets  within  a  reasonable  time  frame.  A  more  realistic  target  set  under  the \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 2  \n\nBharat  Nirman  still  requires  about  Rs480  billion  from  FY2006  to  2010.  About  40%  of  this \nrequirement  is  to  be  funded  from  the  cess  on  high-speed  diesel  and  about  7%  from  the \ncommitted assistance from ADB and the World Bank; for the balance of 53%, funding sources \nremain to be identified. MORD is seeking domestic and external borrowing to deliver the program, \nand  is  taking  steps  to  find  ways  to  lower  the  unit  costs  of  new  roads  and  reduce  the  overall \ninvestment  requirement.  Program  support  for  these  efforts  is  recommended  to  strengthen  the \noverall financial viability of PMGSY. \n \n12.  Maintenance  Funding.  Sustainability  of  the  PMGSY  investment  will  be  dependent  on \neffective  implementation  of  appropriate  design  and  construction  standards  and  an  adequate \nmaintenance  regime.  PMGSY  requires  implementation  of  technical  oversight  during  design  and \ncontractor supervision during construction, as well as inclusion in the construction contract of a 5-\nyear maintenance component to be implemented by the construction contractor. The maintenance \ncomponent, which includes the construction/defects liability period, is separately financed by the \nstate.  \n \nState  governments  are  also  required  to  furnish  a  certificate  to  the  effect  that  the \n13.  \nprovision  of  funds  for  maintenance  has  been  made  for  PMGSY  roads  separately  in  the  state \nbudget,  as  a  precondition  for  submitting  annual  project  proposals  to  the  central  Government. \nAmounts budgeted and allocated for FY2005 are \n\n(i)  Assam. Rs600 million (about $14 million) are budgeted for the entire road network \nunder  state  responsibility,  of  which  Rs150  million  (about  $3.5  million)  were \ndeposited in the Assam State Road Board (ASRB) account as of April 2005.   \n(ii)  Orissa. Rs12.6 million (about $0.3 million) are budgeted and this amount has been \n\ndeposited in the Orissa State Rural Roads Agency (OSRRA) account.  \n\n(iii)  West  Bengal.  Has  budgeted  Rs30  million  (about  $0.7  million)  earmarked  for \n\npayment to PMGSY contractors. \n\n \nAlthough  funding  required  to  meet  existing  contractual  obligations  is  relatively  modest, \n14. \nfunding  requirements  will  increase  exponentially  as  PMGSY  roads  constructed  under  the  new \nform  of  contract  are  completed.  This  requirement  will  experience  another  significant  increase \nwhen  ADB-funded  roads  begin  to  come  online  in  FY2008.  Maintenance  requirements  for \nFY2007 to FY2012 in constant rupees, without taking inflation into consideration are as follows: \n(i)  Assam from Rs130 million ($3 million) in FY2008 to Rs790 million ($18.2 million) in \n\n(ii)  Orissa from Rs330 million ($7.6 million) in FY2008 to Rs1.140 billion ($26.2 million) \n\n(iii)  West Bengal from Rs230 million ($5.3 million) in FY2008 to Rs1.320 billion ($30.3 \n\nFY2012; \n\nin FY2012; and \n\nmillion) in FY2012. \n\n \nThese  are  significant  when  compared  with  the  existing  level  of  maintenance  funding \n15.  \nbudgeted  by  the  respective  states.  Moreover,  state  financing  of  program  maintenance  for  new \nroads  should  not  result  in  a  reduced  level  of  funding  for  maintenance  already  committed  to  by \neach state for existing roads. \n \n16.  With maintenance of existing state rural road networks already significantly underfunded, \nthis program will need to explore ways to more reliably and effectively ensure adequate financing \nfor  the  maintenance  of  all  state  rural  roads\u2014existing  and  proposed,  particularly  core  rural  road \nnetworks. In this regard, loan assurances agreed upon for ADB support of the RRSI, with respect \nto road maintenance, will also be required for the second phase of ADB support.  \n\n\fEXTERNAL ASISTANCE TO THE

The  existing  monitoring  mechanism  under  PMGSY,  namely  the \nonline  management,  monitoring,  and  accounting  system  and  the  state  and  national  quality \nmonitors,  will  be  supplemented  by  input  from  the  technical  support  consultant  for  safeguard \ncompliance and road safety.  \n\n                                                 \n2 The  PIUs  of  the  SRRDA,  with  support  of  the  project  implementation  consultants,  will  finalize  the  detailed  project \nreports of proposed subproject roads meeting all the selection criteria, and will submit them to the state technical \nagency for technical scrutiny after completing all the procedural requirements of the PMGSY guidelines, CPF, and \nEAF. Compliance with the requirements of the CPF and EAF will be concurrently reviewed by the technical support \nconsultant financed under the MFF.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n39\n\nDESIGN FEATURES AND TECHNICAL STANDARDS \n\nDesign Standards for Investment Program Roads \n\n \n1. \nThe  roads  to  be  constructed  or  upgraded  under  the  Rural  Roads  Sector  II  Investment \nProgram are rural roads comprising village roads and other district roads to provide all-weather \nconnectivity  to  habitations.  The  project  roads  will  be  built  along  the  alignments  of  the  existing \nearth/gravel roads, which are in poor condition. The majority of these roads are impassable for \n3\u20134 months during the wet season. As they presently carry a low volume of traffic\u2014on average, \nless than 50 motorized vehicles per day\u2014and projected traffic for them after 20 years will still be \nbelow 1,000, the project roads are classified as low-traffic. \n \nA. \n \nThe  design  criteria  adopted  are  in  accordance  with  the  Indian  Roads  Congress  (IRC) \n2. \npublication Rural Roads Manual (IRC:SP:20-2002) and other IRC design codes that have been \nfollowed by the Prime Minister\u2019s Rural Roads Program (PMGSY). The standards are consistent \nwith standard international practices adopted by the American Association of State Highway and \nTransportation  Officials  design  standards  and  Transport  Research  Laboratory  Overseas  Road \nNote 31: Guide to the Structural Design of Bitumen-Surfaced Roads in Tropical and Subtropical \nCountries, and are found appropriate. \n \n3. \ndesign standards of rural roads. \n \n\nThe following codes have been developed by IRC to provide guidelines on the geometric \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nIRC:73-1980 Geometric Design Standards for Rural (Nonurban) Highways. \nIRC:52-2001  Recommendations  about  the  Alignment  Survey  and  Geometric \nDesign of Hill Roads. \nIRC:SP:23-1983 Vertical Curves for Highways. \nIRC:38-1988  Guidelines  for  Design  of  Horizontal  Curves  for  Highways  and \nDesign Tables. \nIRC:SP:48-1998 Hill Road Manual. \n\n \n4. \nPMGSY  only  requires  that  roads  be  negotiable  in  all  kinds  of  weather.  The  choice  of \nsurfacing  takes  into  account  factors  such  as  traffic,  soil  type,  and  rainfall.  Under  the  Rural \nRoads  Sector  II  Investment  Program,  the  subprojects  must  meet  an  economic  criterion  to \nensure that they are economically justified. In many cases, bitumen surfacing will be the most \neconomic  option,  particularly  because  (i)  under  monsoon  conditions,  gravel-surfaced  roads \ncould be washed away by rains; and (ii) gravel roads require frequent maintenance if they are to \nrealize  their  potential  life,  and  include  uncertainties  about  establishing  a  permanent  capacity \nsufficient for carrying out required activities. \n \nB. \n \n5. \n \n\nThe major improvements on the project roads are as follows: \n\nGeneral Design Consideration \n\nWiden  the  existing  roadway  to  7.5  meters  (m)\u2014efforts  will  be  made  to  confine \nwidening within the existing right-of-way to minimize adverse environmental and \nsocial impacts. \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n  \n(vi) \n \n(vii) \n\nProvide  a  3.75  m  wide  carriageway  with  granular  subbase,  waterbound \nmacadam as base, and bitumen overlay. Where the traffic is low and is not likely \nto increase in the future,1 width of 3 m will be provided. \n\nProvide a 3.75 m shoulder (1.875 m on each side). \n\nRaise the embankment to provide a minimum subgrade level of 0.5 m above the \nnatural  ground  level  or  0.6  m  above  the  highest  flood  level  to  meet  hydraulic \nrequirements. \n\nImprove  horizontal  and  vertical  alignment  to  allow  a  design  speed  of  50 \nkilometers/hour  on  level  terrain.  The  existing  alignment  will  be  followed  in  most \ncases to minimize resettlement. \n\nProvide adequate road safety features through a safety audit. \n\nProvide  proper  cross-drainage  structures,  where  necessary,  to  ensure  all-\nweather connectivity. Conduits for future irrigation pipes will be provided.   \n\n \n(viii)  Provide road furniture, including signs and kilometer posts. \n  \n(ix) \n \n\nEstablish tree plantations along the roads where appropriate.  \n\n                                                 \n1   In case the road has a dead end. \n\n\fPOLICY MATRIX \n\nIntervention \n\nImpact \n\nStatus \n\n(RRSI) Policy dialogue with Ministry \nof Rural Development (MORD) to \nidentify a core network of rural \nroads in each district that will be the \nbackbone providing connectivity to \nall planned link rural roads \n\n\u2022  Giving priority to rural roads \n\nforming part of core network will \nallow for the optimization of \nnetwork benefits from the \ninvestment in rural roads \n\n \n\n\u2022  Preparation of core network based on \ndistrict rural roads plan, procedures to \ndraw up lists of priority roads for new \nconnectivity and upgrading, and \nselection procedures to prepare an \nannual list of project roads \nincorporated in updated PMGSY \nguidelines \n\n\u2022  Consideration to economic viability \nforms part of eligibility criteria in the \nnewly issued PMGSY Operations \nManual \n\nIncorporated in updated PMGSY \nguidelines \n\n2.

The  Investment \nProgram  will  finance  improvement  to  around  30,000  kilometers  (km)  of  rural  roads.  The \nInvestment  Program  is  categorized  as  a  \u201cB\u201d  project  in  accordance  with  Asian  Development \nBank  (ADB)  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003).  The  Investment  Program  is  not \nsubject  to  the  Indian  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  Notification  of  the  Ministry  of \nEnvironment and Forests (MOEF). The Government of India does not require an environmental \nassessment for this Investment Program and its subprojects. \n \n2. \nThe  Investment  Program  will  not  involve  a  significant  physical  intervention  due  to  the \ncharacteristics of the construction works involved. Rural roads under PMGSY vary from 1 to 25 \nkm  in  length;  the  average  is  about  10  km.  PMGSY  does  not  finance  reconstruction  or \nimprovement of bridges longer than 25 meters (m). The rural road improvement will involve (i) \nimprovement  of  the  road  to  an  all-weather  standard;  (ii)  widening  of  the  existing  alignment  to \naccommodate a 3.75 m single carriageway, and 1.875 m shoulders, which may be adjusted by \ntaking  into  account  the  availability  of  land  along  the  alignment;  and  (iii)  construction  of  a  side \ndrain along the road in residential areas. Considering the magnitude of individual works under \nthis Investment Program, no significant impacts are expected. However, some stretches of the \nrural roads may pass through a forest area, where expansion of the existing road will require a \npermit  from  the  state  Forest  Department.  The  Forest  Protection  Act  requires  any  activities \ninvolving  forest  areas  to  \u201cforest  clearance\u201d  from  the  Forest  Department.  Under  the  same  act, \nany  activities  involving  tree  cutting  are  required  to  compensate  the  damage  by  planting  two \ntrees for every tree cut.    \n \n3. \nOn  the  basis  of  the  environmental  classification of  the  Investment  Program,  as  well  as \npotential  environmental  impacts  related  to  the  Investment  Program,  initial  environmental \nexaminations  (IEE)  of  sample  subprojects  were  prepared  by  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance (TA) consultant on behalf of the Ministry of Rural Development (MORD).  \n \nB. \n \nRural  road  investments  under  the  Investment  Program  are  expected  to  provide  rural \n4. \ncommunities with better access to essential basic services such as education and health, and to \ncontribute  to  increasing  the  incomes  of  rural  communities  by  providing  improved  access  to \nmarkets  for  agriculture products  and  to  employment  opportunities.  The  Investment  Program  is \nalso  expected  to  support  improvements  in  rural  productivity  and  to  help  reduce  urbanization \nover the longer term. \n \n5. \nMORD commissioned a rapid independent assessment of the socioeconomic impact of \nPMGSY on the livelihoods of rural communities in Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, \nMizoram, Orissa, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. The findings of the \nassessment  show  that  improvements  of  rural  roads  in  those  states  resulted  in  increased \nagriculture production  for  commercial  purposes.  However,  the  improvement  of  rural  roads  has \nalso led to increased consumption of agrochemicals such as fertilizer and pesticides.  \n \n\nEnvironmental Impacts of the Sector \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n51\n\nImpact on the industrial sector has not yet resulted in increased numbers of new small \n6. \nindustries.  However,  impacts  on  the  existing  cottage  and  small  industries  were  observed  in \nterms of easier access to raw materials and availability of commercial vehicles to transport bulk \nproduct  to  the  market.  This  has  led  to  improved  economic  conditions  in  some  rural  areas  in \nAssam and Mizoram states.  \n \n7. \nSignificant positive impacts on health and education of rural communities were observed \nin  all  states  where  the  study  was  conducted.  Similarly,  positive  impacts  on  employment \ngeneration  was  observed,  particularly  in  processing  postharvest  products,  as  well  as  shifting \nfrom grain to cash crops and moving to multiple cropping.      \n  \nC. \n \n8. \nAn  IEE  was  prepared  for  each  of  the  Investment  Program  states,  instead  of  for  each \nroad project. From the total 1,000 km subproject roads in each state, the IEE was carried out for \naround  100  km.  The  total  sample  subprojects  cover  322  km  scattered  in  the  three  states\u2014\nAssam,  Orissa,  and  West  Bengal.  For  the  remaining  about  900  km  of  subprojects  included  in \nthe first batch in each state, the environmental scrutiny is based on the information provided in \nthe environmental checklists, which serve as the IEE for these subprojects.  \n \n\nSummary of IEEs for Sample Subprojects \n\nSubproject Description \n\n1. \n \n9. \nThe Investment Program will cover improvement to the existing roads by providing black \ntopping of a 3.75 m carriageway and as much as possible to provide a 1.875 m earth shoulder \non  each side  of  the  road.  In  residential  areas, side  drainage  will  be  provided  along  the  roads. \nThe  roadway  is  expected  to  have  a  width  of  7.5  m  in  flat  areas  and  6  m  in  hilly  mountainous \nareas.    \n \n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental Conditions \n\n \n10. \nAssam.  The  physiographic  of  Assam  is  categorized  into  four  distinct  divisions:  (i)  the \neastern and central plains with elevation of 600 m above mean sea level; (ii) the Cachar plains \nwith elevation of 50 m; (iii) the North Cachar Hills and Rengma Hills with elevation ranging 150\u2013\n300  m;  and  (iv)  the  north  and  south  Brahmaputra  hills  with  the  remaining  plains  in  the  central \nand  eastern  part  of  the  state.  All  of  Assam  is  within  the  Brahmaputra  River  Basin  with  the \nBrahmaputra River traversing the state in a highly braided channel characterized by numerous \nsand bars or chars. Flood-prone areas can be found mainly along the Brahmaputra River from \nthe  east  to  west.  Soil  condition  is  dominated  by  entisols  predominant  along  the  Brahmaputra \nRiver and the southern part of the state, with the mollisoils prevalent in the western and northern \nfringes,  and  the  alfisols  occurring  in  central  parts.  Land  utilization  is  classified  into  arable, \nreserved forest, protected forest, orchard and plantation, scrub and grass, and urban. \n \n11. \nField  investigation  of  the  floral  components  was  carried  out  within  the  Investment \nProgram districts. The dominant flora is trees along rural roads particularly in agricultural lands. \nMost  of  these  trees  do  not  have  ecological  and/or  significant  economic  value.  No  wildlife  or \nthreatened  or  endangered  species  are  reported  within  the  corridor  of  impact  of  the  road \nproposals. \n \n12.  West  Bengal.  The  physiographic  of  Darjeeling,  Jalpaiguri,  and  Koch  Bihar  in  the \nHimalayan  Region  is  classified  as  hilly  with  elevation  ranging  from  100  to  3,500  m  above  sea \nlevel. Puruliya district, the western part of Barddhaman and Medinipur districts, and the western \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nand  northern  part  of  Birbhum  form  a  fringe  of  the  western  plateau.  The  Sunderbans  area  of \nSouth 24 Parganas and a small part of North 24 Parganas form a part of the deltaic zone. The \nremaining central and eastern parts are mainly alluvial plains. West Bengal has three major river \nbasins namely the Ganga draining about 80% of the state, the Brahmaputra and Subarnarekha \ndraining  the  remaining.  Some  of  the  chronically  drought-prone  areas  are  Puruliya  and  part  of \nBankura  and  Medinipur  districts;  while  the  chronically  flood-affected  areas  are  parts  of \nBarddhaman,  Haora,  Hugli,  Medinipur,  and  Murshidabad  districts  and  a  few  patches  in  the \nnorthern  districts  of  Koch  Bihar  and  Jalpaiguri.  The  state  has  numerous  low-lying  areas  that \nflood  during  the  monsoon  and  remain  waterlogged  due  to  inadequate  drainage  outlets  for  the \nreceding floodwaters. The soil conditions in Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri districts are dominated by \nbrown soil. Red acidic lateritic soils are predominant in Bankura, Birbhum, Puruliya, and parts of \nBarddhaman  and  Medinipur  districts.  Deltaic  and  saline  soils  occur  in  Bankura,  Barddhaman, \nBirbhum,  Dinajpur,  Haora,  Medinipur,  Murshidabad,  and  North  24  Parganas  districts.  Land \nutilization  within  the  Investment  Program  districts  is  broadly  classified  into  uncultivable, \nforestland, for cultivation, wasteland, urban area and industrial. \n \nField  investigation  of  the  floral  components  was  carried  out  within  the  Investment \n13. \nProgram districts. The dominant flora is trees along rural roads particularly in agricultural lands. \nMost  of  these  trees  do  not  have  ecological  and/or  significant  economic  value.  No  wildlife  or \nthreatened  or  endangered  species  are  reported  within  the  corridor  of  impact  of  the  road \nproposals. \n \n14. \nOrissa.  The  physiographic  of  Orissa  is  categorized  into  two  broad  regions  namely  the \ncoastal districts with coastal tracts interspersed with estuarine environment, with elevation of 0\u2013\n1,200 m above sea level, and the upland districts with elevation of 50\u2013750 m. Orissa has three \nmajor  river  basins,  with  the  Mahanadi  River  largely  draining  the  central  and  southern  parts  of \nthe state, the Brahmani River draining the central part, and the Subarnarekha River draining the \nnorthern part. The soil in most areas is dominated by alfisols and inceptisols, with mostly deltaic \nalluvial soils prevalent in the coastal districts. Some of the chronically drought-prone areas are \nthe Balangir, Kalahandi, Koraput districts, while the most frequently affected cyclone area is the \nGajapati  district  along  the  southern  coast.  Land  utilization  within  the  Investment  Program \ndistricts \nforest  areas, \nis  broadly  classified \nwasteland/scrub, and rural/urban settlement. \n \n15. \nField  investigation  of  the  floral  components  was  carried  out  within  the  Investment \nProgram districts. The dominant flora is trees along rural roads particularly in agricultural lands. \nMost  of  these  trees  do  not  have  ecological  and/or  significant  economic  value.  No  wildlife  or \nthreatened  or  endangered  species  are  reported  within  the  corridor  of  impact  of  the  road \nproposals. \n\nirrigated,  arable  unirrigated, \n\ninto  arable \n\n \n\n3. \n\nPotential Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n\n16. \nEnvironmental  Impacts  Due  to  Location  of  Subprojects.  No  adverse  environmental \nimpacts due to the location of the rural roads are perceived. Of the total 322 km of sample rural \nroad construction works in 48 different stretches, none passes through national parks or wildlife \nsanctuaries. No archaeological, historical, or protected heritage monuments; natural habitats or \nnature  reserves;  or  reserve,  protected,  or  unclassified  forest  areas  are  situated  within  a  5  km \nradius of the subproject roads in the first annual batch.  \n\n \n\n17. \nEnvironmental Impacts Related to Subproject Design. The design of the rural roads \nwill not pose any significant environmental problem. Assessment of the present road conditions \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n53\n\nand  the  construction  proposals  indicate  no  major  embankment  construction  with  a  height \ngreater  than  1.2  m.  The  proposals  are  also  confined  to  the  existing  alignment  with  minor \ncorrections to vertical or horizontal profile to minimize any environmental impacts. Provision of \nsmall drainage structures is expected to improve the existing drainage system. Considering the \nlength  of  the  rural  roads  (mostly  less  than  10  km),  they  are  not  projected  to  cause  major \nadverse environmental impacts. \n\n \n\n18. \nEnvironmental  Impacts  during  Construction.  Most  of  the  environmental  impacts  will \narise  during  construction.  These  impacts,  however,  are  temporary  and  negligible.  The \nvegetative  cover  within  the  right-of-way  will  be  affected  due  to  clearing  operations  for  road \nconstruction. To mitigate this impact, the cleared corridor will be replanted. Other environmental \nimpacts such as increasing dust, noise, and emissions from the construction equipment, hot mix \nplants,  and  other  vehicles  deployed,  as  well  as  sedimentation,  soil  erosion,  and  run-off  from \nearth  borrowing  or  quarrying  activities  are  expected  to  occur  during  construction.  However, \nfollowing  good  construction  practice  such  as  equipment  maintenance,  efficient  materials \nhandling,  and  site  maintenance,  can  mitigate  such  impacts. The  rural  road  construction  works \nare  not  expected  to  generate  construction  debris  that  requires  safe  handling  prior  to  disposal. \nHence, no specific mitigation measures are required. \n \n19. \nEnvironmental Impacts Resulting from Operation. No major environmental problems \nin the operation phase of rural road investment are perceived. The rural road investments are \nexpected  to  have  positive  environmental  impacts  that  will  improve  environmental  conditions \nalong  the  road  corridors.  The  revegetation  of  the  corridor  will  enhance  the  aesthetics  and \nprovide  serenity  to  road  users.  Ambient  air  and  noise  quality  will  be  improved  due  to  the \nretrieved tree cover and paved surface.  \n \n\n4. \n\nInstitutional Arrangement and Environmental Monitoring  \n\n \nThe  IEE  identified  the  need  for  generic  monitoring  of  implementation  of  mitigation \n20. \nmeasures  as  well  as  monitoring  of  the  adverse  impacts.  During  construction  phase,  the \nenvironmental monitoring will focus on implementation of the mitigation to minimize dust, volatile \nsubstances from hot-mix plant, and logging of drainage and streams.  \n \n21. \nImplementation  of  mitigation  measures  during  construction  will  be  the  responsibility  of \nthe  contractor.  An  environment  consultant,  who  will  be  part  of  the  project  implementation \nconsultant group to assist the project implementation unit (PIU), will be responsible for preparing \ncontractual  documentation  to  obligate  the  contractor  to  implement  mitigation  measures  during \nconstruction. This environment consultant will also assist the PIU in monitoring and supervising \nthe  contractor  in  implementing  mitigation  measures.  The  state  rural  roads  development \nagencies  (SRRDAs)  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  overall  environmental  monitoring \nprogram for overall Investment Program implementation.  \n \nD. \n\nEnvironmental Assessment and Review Framework \n\n \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Selection Criteria for Subprojects \n\n \n22. \nConsidering  the  potential  direct  and  indirect  impacts  of  the  Investment  Program, \nadditional  subprojects  will  be  selected  by  taking  into  account  the  following  environmental \ncriterion: Subprojects will be environmentally sound and none will be located within or close to \nan environmentally sensitive area such as a wildlife sanctuary, national park, or other areas with \nsignificant  ecological \nthat  are  declared  as  national  parks,  sanctuaries,  or \nnational/international cultural heritage. \n\nfunctions \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n \n23. \nAssessment of the environmental impacts of the sample roads reveal that environmental \nimpacts associated with Investment Program subprojects are similar across the 322 km sample \nroads.  The  environmental  impacts  have  the  following  characteristics:  (i)  occur  only  during \nconstruction  or  are  temporary,  (ii)  reversible,  and  (iii)  mitigation  measures  could  be  easily \nincorporated into design and construction. Taking into account the IEE findings for these sample \nroads,  standard  guidelines  for  environmental  management  plans\u2014environmental  codes  of \npractice\u2014will  be  prepared  to  guide  the  subprojects  in  incorporating  the  environmental \nmanagement plan. \n \n24. \nTaking into account the potential impacts related to the sample subprojects and ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental  assessment  guidelines,  the  environmental  requirement  for  the  follow-on \nsubprojects  is  as  follow:  For  each  individual  subproject,  an  environmental  checklist,  which  will \nserve as IEE, will be prepared. However, if the environmental checklist indicates that significant \nimpacts  are  likely,  a  standard  full  IEE  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines (footnote 1) will be prepared. \n\n \n25. \nSince the Investment Program is not subject to the Government\u2019s Environmental Impact \nAssessment  Notification,  the  specific  procedure  to  mainstream  environmental  concerns  into \nInvestment  Program  implementation  is  formulated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines (footnote 1).  \n \n\n2.  \n\nResponsibilities and Authorities \n\nProject Implementation Unit. The PIU will \n\n \n26. \n\ncomplete the detailed project report (DPR) using the environmental checklist that \nserves  as  IEE  for  construction,  and  ensure  that  construction  will  be  along  the \nexisting alignment; and \nobtain  necessary  statutory  environmental  clearance  prior  to  commencement  of \ncivil works.   \n\n27. \n\n \nState Rural Roads Development Agencies. The SRRDAs will \n\nensure that DPRs for follow-on subprojects are completed with the environmental \nchecklists that serve as IEE;  \nensure  that  the  environmental  checklists  are  reviewed  by  the  environmental \nofficer of the concerned SRRDA;1  \nensure that all required statutory environmental clearances are obtained and the \nconditions noted in the clearances are implemented; \nensure  that  the  relevant  provisions  of  the  environmental  codes  of  practice  are \nfollowed as part of the effort to mainstream environmental concerns; \nensure \nmeasures; \nensure  that  the  environmental  checklist,  which  covers  recommendations  to \nmitigate the impacts, is made available to the contractors; and \nundertake  routine  monitoring  of  the  implementation  of  the  identified  mitigation \nmeasures. \n\nthat  bidding  documents  cover  required  environmental  mitigation \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1  If  the  environmental  checklist  indicates  that  significant  impacts  are  likely,  the  SRRDA  will  report  to  ADB  through \n\nMORD for further guidance. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n55\n\n28.

MORD,  the  Executing  Agency,  should  ensure  that  ADB  is  given  access  to  undertake \nenvironmental  due  diligence  for  all  subprojects,  if  needed.  However,  MORD  has  the \nresponsibility for undertaking environmental due diligence and monitoring of the implementation \nof  environmental  mitigation  measures  for  all  subprojects.  The  due  diligence  as  well  as \nmonitoring  of  the  implementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan  needs  to  be \ndocumented systematically.  \n \n\n4. \n\nPublic Disclosure and Public Consultation \n\n \n30. \nDuring the preparation of the DPR and filling up the checklist through the transect walk \nexercise,  the  PIU  has  to  ensure  that  consultation  with  the  affected  people  and  their  concerns \nare recorded. Aside from consultations, all environmental assessment documents are subject to \npublic disclosure. These documents should be made available to the public, if requested. In this \ncontext the following system will be adopted:   \n \n\nThe  SRRDAs  are  responsible  for  ensuring  that  all  environmental  checklist \ndocumentation,  including  the  environmental  due  diligence  and  monitoring \nreports, are properly and systematically kept as part of the Investment Program \nspecific records. \nMORD  must  make  the  IEE  report  for  the  new  construction  road  with  new \nalignment available on its website. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\nStaffing Requirements and Budget \n\n5. \n \nEnvironment  specialists  of  the  technical  support  consultants  will  check  and  review  the \n31. \nenvironmental  checklists,  and  to  monitor  and  supervise  the  implementation  of  environmental \nmitigation measures.

To provide \nconnectivity to  unconnected habitationsa and promote  access to economic and social services, the Government of \nIndia launched the national program Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (Prime Minister\u2019s Rural Roads Program or \nPMGSY)  in  2000.  To  help  finance  PMGSY,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  extending  loans  under  a \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  to  the  Government  for  rural  road  investment  in  selected  core  PMGSY  states \nhaving large numbers of unconnected habitations, initially the states of Assam, Orissa, and West Bengal. The Rural \nRoads Sector II Investment Program (Investment Program) will provide augmented access to social and economic \nfacilities  and  markets,  and  connect  remote  villages  leading  to  increased  agricultural  incomes  and  productive \nemployment/trading opportunities for the local villagers. \nB.         Poverty Analysis                                 Proposed Classification: General intervention   \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe core sample subprojects for the Investment Program in 11 districts in the three states were identified for poverty \nanalysis. The three Investment Program states have a largely agrarian economy with the majority of the population \ndependent  upon  agriculture  for  their  livelihood.  These  states  are  among  the  poorest  states  in  India  and  lagging  in \nterms  of  a  number  of  key  development  indicators  such  as  per  capita  income,  poverty  ratios,  and  unemployment. \nTable A12 illustrates the proportion of population living below the poverty line in the three states; each has a higher \nproportion  vis-\u00e0-vis  the  national  average.  Poverty  is  a  particularly  widespread  reality  in  the  state  of  Orissa  with \n47.15% of the total population living below the poverty line.b The proportion of poor is even higher in the rural areas \nof each of these states thereby necessitating the need of sustainable poverty reduction in these areas.  \n \n\nTable A12.

National Human Development Report. Delhi. \n \nIn Assam, as per the survey findings in the subproject districts, 3.4% of households are below the poverty line and \n32% derive their livelihood from agriculture or worked as agricultural laborers. The population in the subproject areas \ncomprises  primarily  poor  and  low-income  groups  with  nearly  73%  having  an  annual  income  less  than  Rs30,000. \nNearly 42% households are illiterate with only 13% reported to have completed primary level education. In terms of \naccess to water supply, the surveyed population depends primarily on ground wells (64%); 65% of households have \nno access to sanitation facilities. \n \nIn Orissa, nearly 22% of the households live below the poverty line; about 14% are engaged in agriculture; 22% are \nwage  laborers  and  derive  their  livelihoods  from  agricultural  or  nonagricultural  activities.  Similar  to  other  states,  the \npoor and low income groups (90%) with annual incomes of less than Rs30,000 predominate in the subproject areas. \nIn  terms  of  educational  attainments,  20%  of  the  households  are  illiterate  and  only  7%  have  completed  primary \neducation. In terms of access to water supply, 54% depend on public stand posts and very few (4%) have access to \nsanitation facilities.  \n \nIn West Bengal, 12% of the households in the subproject areas live below the poverty line. Nearly 38% households \nare  engaged  in  agriculture  and  as  daily  wage  laborers.  Only  9%  of  households  are  involved  in  small  trade  and \nbusinesses.  The  poor  and  low-income  groups  predominate  (76%),  earning  less  than  Rs30,000  per  annum.  In  the \nsubproject  areas,  15%  households  are  illiterate  and  21%  have  completed  primary  education.  In  terms  of  water \nsupply, 58% have access to piped water system and only 24% have proper sanitation facilities. \n \n \n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nA comparative assessment of the socioeconomic characteristics of poor and non-poor households in the three states \nfound no significant difference in access to facilities in rural areas. However, the poor households had lower levels of \nincome, fewer assets, and smaller landholdings; most were scheduled castes or scheduled tribes.   \n \nCommunity  assessments  carried  out  in  the  three  states  reveals  that  rural  households  perceive  a  positive  linkage \nbetween  road  improvement  and  poverty  reduction.  The  analysis  reveals  that  the  improvement  of  rural  roads  will \nimprove  economic  lives  (income  poverty)  and  the  social  way  of  life  (human  poverty)  of  the  poor  in  the  subproject \nareas. The perceived socioeconomic benefits identified by nearly 80\u201390% of rural households in the three states are \n(i)  increase  in  income;  (ii)  increased  access  to  facilities  like  schools,  hospitals,  and  health  centers;  (iii)  increase  in \nemployment  opportunities  associated  with  increased  mobility;  (iv)  industrial  development;  and  (v)  improvement  in \ntransportation systems. Provision of all-weather roads will also lead to increased access to rural markets and rapid \neconomic diversification increasing the incomes of farmers in all income groups. Production and marketing of high-\nvalue  perishable  products  will  become  possible  on  a  commercial  basis,  thus  potentially  increasing  the  incomes  of \nmarginal farmers. The poor households mostly engaged as wage labor regard improved mobility as an opportunity \nthat  would  provide  them  with  better-paying  jobs  outside  their  villages.  The  improved  connectivity  is  expected  to \nencourage investments in nonagricultural enterprises and larger investments in transport services. Communities with \nall-weather  roads  will  also  attract  assistance  from  existing  government  programs  and  district  poverty  reduction \nprojects. \n \nOverall,  the  Investment  Program  will  have  an  immediate  and  short-term  impact  on  poverty  reduction  by  providing \nlabor opportunities to rural poor  who  will be hired during construction. In the longer term, improved rural roads  will \nenable  farmers  to  gain  access  to  markets,  benefit  from  reduced  cost  of  supply  of  agricultural  inputs,  and  in  turn, \nincrease the size of agricultural surplus contributing to increases in income, which will be spent on other goods and \nservices. Improved access will lead to greater mobility enabling rural communities to shift from subsistence farming \nto  more  commercial  agricultural  production.  One  of  the  major  benefits  of  the  Investment  Program  will  be  reliable \naccess  to  schools  and  health  services  through  reduced  travel  time  and  transportation  costs,  which  will  contribute \ndirectly to their accumulation of human capital, which is a key factor in sustainable poverty reduction.  \n\n \nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\n \n\n   No \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\n   Yes               \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nDuring Investment Program preparation, discussions, interview schedules and small group meetings were conducted \nwith  the  subproject-affected  communities  to  ascertain  their  response  to  the  Investment  Program,  their  needs  and \ndemands,  estimates  of  losses  that  they  might  suffer,  and  steps  to  mitigate  the  same.  These  interviews  and  group \nmeetings  were  held  in  groups  comprising  men,  women,  farmers,  scheduled  castes,  scheduled  tribes,  and  other \nbackward classes to ensure a comprehensive perspective of the Investment Program as well as its impacts. These \nprocesses brought forth unanimous support from the communities for the Investment Program, primarily due to the \nprospective socioeconomic benefits that it will bring.  \n \nD. \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe  assessments  undertaken  during  Investment  Program  preparation  brought  forth  that  the  proposed  road \nconstruction will not entail any adverse impacts on women. As part of gender analysis focus group discussions were \norganized with women belonging to various castes, communities, and income groups in the subprojects to get their \nfeedback on the proposed Investment Program and to ascertain the probable positive or negative impacts on them. \nAccording  to  them,  the  augmented  access  to  medical  facilities  during  rainy  seasons  would  be  one  of  the  major \nbenefits  especially  during  childbearing.  Road  improvement  would  make  travel  safer  and  more  comfortable  for \nwomen as presently they travel on foot; road improvement would enable them to travel at all times due to availability \nof other means of transportation. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n\nGender and Development \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nE.

Most  of \nimprovements will be carried out within existing right-of-way \nin  the  three  states  and  will  affect  mostly  narrow  strips  of \nagricultural  land.  The  finalization  of  the  alignment  was \ncarried  out  through  a  community  consultation  process  and \ndesign  modification  to  minimize  impact  on  structures,  and \ntitled  and  nontitled  holders  to  the  extent  possible.  A \nvoluntary \nthe \nInvestment  Program  in  recognition  of  the  effectiveness  of \nthe  system  for  rural  roads  development  in  India.  The \nInvestment  Program  will  also  ensure  that  the  voluntary \ndonation  does  not  severely  affect  the  living  standards  of \naffected  people,  and  provides  mitigation  measures  to \nreplace  losses  related  to  assets,  livelihoods,  and  common \nproperty  resources,  which  will  be  recorded  and  verified  by \nan independent third party, the gram panchayat. \n \nThe Investment Program will lead to loss of a narrow strip of \nagricultural \ntribe \nhouseholds  in  the  three  states.  The  assessment  indicates \nthat  the  rural  road  construction  will  be  beneficial,  providing \nconnectivity  to  the  habitants  but  bringing  them  in  contact \nwith wider society and consequently better facilities in health \nand  education.  In  addition,  the  Investment  Program  is \nexpected  to  open  up  alternate  options  of  employment  in \nnearby  towns  thereby  diversifying  sources  of  income.  Also \nthe  subproject  areas  show  a  remarkable  degree  of \nassimilation  and \ntribe \npopulation,  which  can  be  primarily  attributed  to  scheduled \ntribes  living  in  close  proximity  with  the  non-scheduled  tribe \npopulation;  and  in  some  states  dominating  some  districts. \nThus  the  Investment  Program  does  not  envisage  any \ndifferential \ntribe  population \ncompared  with  the  nonscheduled  tribe  population;  they  will \nbenefit  equally.  Any  impact  on  scheduled  tribe  households \nwill  be  addressed  through  the  provisions  as  outlined  in  the \ncommunity participation frameworks and plans. \nDuring  construction  labor  opportunities  will  be  available  for \nboth  men  and  women  in  local  communities  at  minimum \nwage rates.  \n \n\nthe  scheduled \n\nthe  scheduled \n\nintegration  of \n\nimpact  on \n\n Full \n Short \n None \n\n \nCommunity \nparticipation \nframework \nprepared for \npreparation and \nimplementation \nof ADB-financed \nsubprojects, and \nplans prepared \nfor core sample \nsubprojects. \n\n Yes \n  No \n\n \nSpecial \nprovisions are \nincluded in the \ncommunity \nparticipation \nframework and \nplans prepared \nfor core sample \nsubprojects. \n\n \nNot required \n \n\n Yes \n  No \n\n Yes \n  No \n\n \nNot required \n\nLabor \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n Significant \n\nAffordability \n\nroad  construction  will  not  have  any \n\nThe  proposed \naffordability issues. \n \n\n \n\n Not significant \n\nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerabilities  \n \n\nRoad safety \nawareness \nprogram being \nprepared under \nprevious loan. \na  In  2000,  about  40%  of  villages  in  rural  India  still  remained  unconnected  by  all-weather  roads.
