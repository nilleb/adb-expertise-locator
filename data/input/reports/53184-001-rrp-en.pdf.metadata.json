\ninvestment of up to $40,000,000 in Everbridge Partners Fund I, L.P. (Everbridge I).1  \n \n2. \nThe proposed investment in Everbridge I will provide growth capital to about ten middle-\nmarket  companies  operating  primarily  in  the  health  care,  business  services,  and  consumer \nsectors, in India, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), and Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Malaysia, \nthe Philippines, and Thailand).2 These companies often lack access to affordable capital because \nequity financing is generally limited and traditional bank financing is difficult to source without hard \nassets that can be pledged as collateral. Furthermore, many companies in emerging Asia need \nimproved professional management to scale up their operations. The proposed investment by the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) in Everbridge I would help deepen capital markets and support \nAsia\u2019s growing private sector.3 \n \n3. \nEverbridge I will be established as a Cayman Islands limited partnership, which will invest, \nvia Everbridge Partners Master Fund I Private Limited, the Singapore master fund (together: the \nfund),  in  companies  with  substantial  operations  in  Asia. 4 Everbridge  Partners  Private  Limited \n(together  with  its  affiliates:  Everbridge),  a  Singapore  company,  will  be  the  fund  manager.  The \nfund\u2019s target capitalization is $750 million.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FUND \n\nInvestment Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n4. \nDescription. Everbridge is a newly formed investment management firm spun out of a \nleading  private  equity  firm,  Capital  Group  Private  Markets  (CGPM).  CGPM  is  part  of  Capital \nGroup, a financial services company with its headquarters in the United States, specializing in \nmutual  funds,  private  equity,  and  investment  services  (7,500  employees,  $1.8 trillion  of  assets \nunder  management).  Everbridge  was  founded  by  the  ex-managing  partner  of  CGPM  Asia, \nLeonard Kim, who now leads a team of ex-CGPM employees.5 Everbridge is headquartered in \nSingapore and has an additional office in Beijing. The Everbridge team (through CGPM) has a \n20-year history (since 1998) investing across multiple market and economic cycles in Asia.

Through  the  market  mapping  of  Asia\u2019s  private  equity \nlandscape, ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) first met the Everbridge team \nin September 2018 and has been in regular contact with Leonard Kim and his team since then. \nPSOD  has  identified  Everbridge\u2019s  profile  to  be  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  private  equity  fund \ninvestment guidelines: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nit  is  one  of  the  more  experienced  fund  management  teams  in  Asia  with  an \nextensive 20-year track record (through CGPM); \nthrough its management of four similar funds, the team has demonstrated its ability \nto add value to investee companies; and \nthe fund is expected to provide attractive co-investment opportunities in PSOD\u2019s \ntargeted sectors and countries. \n\n \n7. \nEverbridge\u2019s  proposed  investment  mandate  supports  ADB\u2019s  development  focus  as \nevidenced by the Everbridge team\u2019s prior investments (while at CGPM) in a range of health care \nand education initiatives, including the largest privately owned maternity hospital chain in the PRC \nby number of births (Jinxin Maternity), India\u2019s fourth largest pharmaceutical company by domestic \nsales  of  chronic  medicines  (Intas),  and  an  innovative  education  service  platform  for  distance \nlearning  and  vocational  training  in  India  (Manipal  Global  Education  Services). 9 Everbridge\u2019s \nstrategy also focuses on tech-enabled businesses. The rapid increase in smartphone and mobile \nbroadband  penetration throughout  emerging  Asia  has  driven the  widespread  adoption  of tech-\nenabled products and services. Innovative solutions are increasingly enabling companies to reach \nunderserved populations in remote areas and low-income groups, and the Everbridge team has \nstrategically focused on investing in businesses that benefit from this trend. Given ADB\u2019s focus \non  promoting  innovative  technology  and  digital  transformation,  its  relationship  with  Everbridge \ncan provide ADB an opportunity to increase its exposure to and build domain knowledge in this \nimpactful space.10 \n \nB. \n \n8. \nEverbridge I will target about 10 investments in the range of $50 million to $150 million \neach, and it is expected that such investments will primarily be in segments relating to health care, \nbusiness  services,  and  consumer  products.  The  fund  manager  will  also  actively  seek  co-\ninvestments for transactions requiring larger equity commitments. Everbridge I expects to make \nmainly influential minority investments (ownership stake above 5% and below 50%) with a typical \nfour to five year holding period for each investment.11 Everbridge seeks to invest in opportunities \nthat exhibit some of the following characteristics: \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\n(i) \n\nStrong,  secular  growth.  Everbridge  targets  businesses  that  enjoy  high  growth \nrates  with  structural  drivers.  The  fund  manager  will  avoid  businesses  that  are \nheavily exposed to general macroeconomic cycles, commodity cycles, and credit \ncycles. \n\n \n\n7  [This information  has  been  removed  as  it  falls  under  the  exception  to  disclosure  in  ADB\u2019s  Access  to  Information \n\n8  [This information  has  been  removed  as  it  falls  under  the  exception  to  disclosure  in  ADB\u2019s  Access  to  Information \n\n9  The technology and products of Everbridge\u2019s future portfolio companies have the potential to benefit countries across \n\n10 ADB.  2018.

Everbridge invests in management teams that \nstrive to be best-in-class operators, create significant value for shareholders, and \nwant to establish strong governance standards. \nInnovation  and  technology.  Technologies  such  as  mobile  broadband  are \nreshaping economies in emerging Asia. Everbridge seeks to invest in businesses \nthat leverage innovation and technology to create new market demand. \nPotential to add value. Everbridge focuses on investment targets with significant \nvalue-creation potential. Everbridge spends time with portfolio companies, typically \nvia holding board seats, to strengthen management, financial controls, strategy, \ngovernance,  and  operating  processes  to  help  these  businesses  successfully \nscale.12 \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n \nC. \n \n9. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].13,14 \n \n10. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].15,16  \n \n11.  Management.  Everbridge  currently  consists  of  16  employees,  including  10  investment \nprofessionals, 1 compliance director, and 5 support staff, who are based either in Singapore or in \nBeijing. Everbridge anticipates hiring six additional investment professionals to support the fund\u2019s \noperations  after  its  initial  close.  In  addition,  Everbridge  leverages  a  network  of  six  operating \npartners who will support the investment team for origination, due diligence, and post-investment \nvalue-creation activities. \n \n12. \nincludes two investment committee meetings. \n\nGovernance structure. Everbridge\u2019s investment process is organized in five stages and \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThematic screening. The Everbridge team develops investment themes within its \ntargeted sectors and identifies the most promising companies in each industry.  \nPipeline  development.  During  the  pipeline  development  stage,  an  initial  deal \nteam,  typically  consisting  of  one  senior  professional  and  one  or  two  junior \nprofessionals, will be formed to research the key thesis and risk factors. This stage \nmay  entail  several  on-site  meetings  and  numerous  follow-up  information \nexchanges with the target company. \nInitial investment committee review. When the relevant information is available, \npromising  investment  opportunities  are  escalated  to  a  formal  initial  investment \ncommittee  review  session.  This  discussion  is  solely  focused  on  the  specific \ninvestment opportunity. If three members of the investment committee, including \nLeonard  Kim,  preliminarily  support  the  opportunity,  a  due  diligence  plan  and \n\n \n\n12 [This information  has  been  removed  as  it  falls  under  the  exception  to  disclosure  in  ADB\u2019s  Access  to  Information \n\n13 [This information  has  been  removed  as  it  falls  under  the  exception  to  disclosure  in  ADB\u2019s  Access  to  Information \n\n14 [This  information  has  been  removed  as  it  falls  under  the  exception  to  disclosure  in  ADB\u2019s  Access  to  Information \n\n15 [This  information  has  been  removed  as  it  falls  under  the  exception  to  disclosure  in  ADB\u2019s  Access  to  Information \n\n16 [This information  has  been  removed  as  it  falls  under  the  exception  to  disclosure  in  ADB\u2019s  Access  to  Information \n\nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n\nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n\nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n\nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n\nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nbudget will be approved.  \nInvestment  committee  workshop.  During  the  weeks  that  follow  the  initial \ninvestment committee review, the deal team will spend a significant amount of time \nengaging  with  the  company\u2019s  management,  customers,  and  suppliers,  and  will \nwork  with  Capital  Group  colleagues  and  third-party  advisors  to  thoroughly \nunderstand  all  aspects  of  the  investment.  The  deal  team  typically  organizes \nmultiple deep-dive workshops into various high-priority aspects of the investment \nopportunity  for  the  investment  committee.  Investment  committee  members \ntypically give feedback after each workshop. \nFinal  investment  committee  discussion.  If  an  investment  progresses  to  an \nadvanced stage, a final investment committee discussion will be organized. At this \nfinal discussion, a complete investment proposal and a compliance checklist are \ncirculated.  After  all  aspects  of  the  investment  are  discussed,  the  investment \ncommittee  will  take  a  final  vote  on  whether  to  undertake  the  investment.  A \nproposed investment must receive four affirmative votes, including that of Leonard \nKim, to be formally approved by the investment committee. \n\n \n13. \nOnce  capital  is  disbursed,  the  Everbridge  team  will  actively  engage  with  the  investee \ncompany based on the agreed road map to improve the business. The tailored plans identify and \nfocus  on  key  critical  areas  where  Everbridge  can  add  value  and  drive  immediate  changes. \nMoreover, Everbridge reaches out to its panel of industry experts and strategic advisors to provide \nrelevant advice and inputs to the investee company. Everbridge holds regular review meetings \nwith the key management team of the portfolio companies and participates in board meetings. \n \nAdvisory committee. The fund will establish an advisory committee consisting of at least \n14. \nthree  limited  partner  members  independent  of  Everbridge.  The  advisory  committee\u2019s  remit \nincludes  advising  on  conflicts  of  interest,  related  party  transactions,  and  valuation  matters. \nEverbridge has agreed to reserve ADB a seat on the advisory committee. \n \nD. \n \n15. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\nFinancial Performance \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \n16. \nADB  will  provide  an  equity  investment  of  up  to  $40,000,000  in  Everbridge  I.

The fund will have a 10-year term from initial closing.17 The anticipated exit \n18. \nstrategies for the fund\u2019s investments include public offerings, trade sales of portfolio companies \nto local and foreign strategic buyers, and secondary sales to other private equity funds. \n \n19. \nReporting arrangements. Everbridge will be required to provide ADB with (i) quarterly \nreports;  and  (ii)  audited  annual  financial  statements,  an  overview  of  the  portfolio  with  brief \ninformation  on  each  portfolio  company\u2019s  performance,  an  annual  development  effectiveness \nmonitoring report, and an annual environmental and social monitoring report. ADB will review this \ninformation and follow up with the fund manager if more information or clarification is needed. If \nthe information received from the fund manager raises issues that could impair the value of ADB\u2019s \ninvestment in the fund, ADB can place the fund on a watch list for more frequent review and closer \nmonitoring. \n \n20. \nEverbridge  will  be  required  to  report  annually  on  environmental  and  social  safeguard \nissues in compliance with its environmental and social management system (ESMS). ADB will \nmonitor the timing and quality of the safeguards reports and offer guidance if the fund manager \nrequires clarification on ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements. \n \nD. \n \n21. \nCapital mobilization and strategy validation. ADB\u2019s participation as an initial investor \nwill help anchor the fund and attract additional institutional capital to enable the fund to reach its \ntarget  size.  ADB\u2019s  investment  in  the  fund  will  allow  Everbridge  to  achieve  a  diversified,  well-\nbalanced  institutional  investor  base  for  the  fund.  In  addition,  ADB\u2019s  participation  will  provide \nvalidation of the fund\u2019s strategy, and its commercial and developmental attributes. \n \nSetting  standards.  ADB  will  require  Everbridge  to  implement  an  ESMS  acceptable  to \n22. \nADB  that requires  it  to  oblige  its  portfolio  companies  to  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  and \nsocial safeguard requirements and report to ADB on development indicators. ADB will support \nEverbridge in its environmental and social risk appraisal of proposed portfolio companies. \n \n23. \nGender  equality.  ADB\u2019s  participation  will  promote  gender  equality  in  the  fund  and \ninvestee companies of the fund. Everbridge will work with ADB throughout the investment period \nin the design and implementation of an overarching gender policy to guide its efforts in achieving \ngender equality in its business and its investees companies, and that Everbridge will screen its \npotential  investees  using  a  gender  equality  scorecard  developed  in  collaboration  with  ADB  to \nassess their inclusiveness and diversity status and responsiveness to women\u2019s empowerment in \nthe  workplace.

The  equity  investment  will  have  the  following  outputs:  (i)  Everbridge  I  is \n\n \nA. \n \nImpact.  The  equity  investment  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  development \n32. \naccelerated in targeted developing member countries (DMCs) through (i) promotion of innovative \ntech-enabled businesses primarily in the health care, business services, and consumer sectors; \nand  (ii)  strengthened  capacity  of  private  equity  markets  with  respect  to  funding  volume  and \ndiversity of sector-specific business models. \n \n33. \nOutcome. The equity investment will have the following outcome: financial sustainability \nand operational value addition of private equity investments demonstrated to benefit DMCs across \nAsia. \n \n34. \nestablished, (ii) capital is invested, and (iii) Everbridge adopts a gender-inclusive approach. \n \nB. \n \nConsistency  with  ADB  strategy.  The  proposed  investment  in  Everbridge  I  aligns \n35. \nstrongly  with  two  operational  priorities  outlined  in  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  (footnote  10).  These \ninclude  (i)  addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities  by  generating  quality  jobs, \nimproving  education,  and  achieving  better  health  for  all;  and (ii)  fostering  regional  cooperation \nand integration by enhancing connectivity and strengthening finance sector cooperation. ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030 also aims to expand private sector operations to support its operational priorities \nby (i) expanding regional reach through private equity funds, (ii) strengthening the finance sector \nand capital markets, and (iii) widening geographic coverage. Given its track record with CGPM, \nEverbridge is uniquely positioned to deliver on ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 themes through investments \nsuch  as  Go-Jek,  which  promotes  regional  cooperation  and  integration,  and  Innovent  Biologics \nand Mankind Pharma, which deliver high-quality health care products and services. \n \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n\fConsistency  with  country  strategies.  The  investment  in  Everbridge  I  is  aligned  with \n36. \nADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  the  PRC,  2016\u20132020,  which  promotes  finance  sector \ninfrastructure  and  supports  commercially  viable  business  models  to  assist  in  the  continued \ndomestic rebalancing from industry to services.18 The investment in the fund is also consistent \nwith  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  India,  2018\u22122022,  which  includes  support  for  the \nhealth  sector  as  a  strategic  priority  and  focuses  on  the  importance  of  gender  equality. 19 The \ninvestment  in  Everbridge  I  is  also  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for \nIndonesia,  2016\u20132019, which  prioritizes  inclusive  growth  by  improving job  creation,  deepening \ncapital markets, and investing in financial infrastructure.20 \n \n37. \nConsistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  proposed \ninvestment  in  Everbridge  I  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  plan  for  finance  sector  operations  and  its \nsubsequent  review  in  2017,  which  prioritize  improved  access  to  capital  markets  and  regional \ncooperation  and  integration. 21  The  investment  in  the  fund  is  also  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s \noperational  plan  for  health,  2015\u20132020,  which  strongly  supports  private  sector  approaches  to \naddress  quality,  efficiency,  and  financing  issues  in  the  health  sector.22 The  Everbridge  team\u2019s \nexperience in the health care industry and its ability to drive growth and create value in companies \nwithin the industry are reflected in CGPM\u2019s investments in Jinxin Maternity and Intas (para. 7). \n \n38. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].23  \n \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \n39. \nCategory FI.
