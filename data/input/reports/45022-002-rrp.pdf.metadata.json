Such a \nmass  migration  will  require  a  major  expansion  of  smaller  cities,  such  as  Ji\u2019an,  to  relieve \ndevelopment  and  environmental  pressures  on  existing  urban  centers,  and  provide  economic \nopportunities and higher incomes for the large population of poorer rural residents. Investments \nin  urban  infrastructure,  transport,  and  related  services  are  needed  to  support  development  in \nthird-tier  cities.  The  PRC  needs  examples  of  good  practice  in  sustainable  urban  transport  to \ndemonstrate  the  benefits  to  cities  of  supporting  and  prioritizing  public  and  nonmotorized \ntransport3, while providing safe and efficient urban road development in expanding urban areas. \n \n4. \nJi\u2019an  is  located  in  central  Jiangxi  Province,  along  the  Ganjiang  River.  The  city  is  a \nprovincial-level  municipality  of  4.9  million  people  of  which  41.6%  are  urban  residents. \nEconomically,  Ji'an  lags  behind  nearby  provinces  and  remains  relatively  poor.  In  2012,  per \ncapita  disposable  income  was  CNY20,282  ($3,253)  compared  with  the  national  average  of \nCNY38,460 ($6,169). Incomes have been rising rapidly, but remain just over 50% of the national \naverage. Ji\u2019an has five national poverty counties. \n \n5. \nJi\u2019an  is  a  major  center  for  tourism.  Its  hinterland  includes  the  Jinggangshan  National \nScenic Area, which attracts many domestic tourists, most arriving by railway and long-distance \nbuses. Ji\u2019an is considered one of the most important areas for revolutionary history in the PRC \nand a major draw for the so-called \u201cred tourism.\u201d4 The government has been actively supporting \nthe development of \u201cred tourism,\u201d in part, to promote socioeconomic development in areas that \nare generally more rural and poorer than the coastal areas. The city includes a large university \nand has an expanding manufacturing base for electrical equipment. \n \n6. \nJi\u2019an is located 210 km from Nanchang (the provincial capital) to the north and 600 km \nfrom Guangzhou (the provincial capital of Guandong Province) to the south. The existing Jing\u2013\nJiu  Railway  (Beijing\u2013Kowloon)  and  G45  Expressway  (Daqing\u2013Guangzhou)  provide  the \nfoundation for the regional transport network in Ji\u2019an. The Chang\u2013Ji-Gan high-speed passenger \nrailway  line  is  now  being  planned  with  a  station  expected  to  be  constructed  about  \n4 km west of the currently developed urban district in Ji\u2019an. Once operating, Ji'an will become \nbetter  connected  to  fast-growing  and  relatively  prosperous  cities  in  Guangdong  Province  and \n                                                                            \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for Jiangxi Ji\u2019an Sustainable \n\nUrban Transport (TA 7965-PRC). \n\n3  Nonmotorized transport includes pedestrian, bicycle and wheelchair transport. \n4  \u201cRed tourism\u201d refers to tourist travel to locations with historical significance to  the development of communism in \n\nthe PRC. \n\n\f2 \n\nthe  provincial  capital  of  Nanchang.  The  opening  of  the  new  railway  offers  a  significant \nopportunity  to  improve  the  Ji'an  economy  by  better  integrating  the  region  into  the  dynamic \neconomy of the southern PRC and by enabling development of tourism. \n \nThe  city  is  typical  of  emerging  third-tier  cities  in  the  PRC,  and  offers  an  opportunity  to \n7. \ndemonstrate more sustainable urban transport development in line with the PRC\u2019s urbanization \nstrategy considered at the Third Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party (November 2013) and \nreleased  in  March  2014.  The  population  of  the  urban  district  where  the  project  is  located  was \n550,000 in 2013 and is expected to reach 730,000 by 2020 and more than 1 million by 2030. To \naccommodate  planned  growth,  the  city  has  been  rapidly  expanding  its  developed  urban  area. \nThe planned development of the new high-speed rail line serves as the focal point for a major \nnew  development  area  on  the  west  side  of  Ji\u2019an.  The  railway  is  expected  to  be  operating  by \n2020,  and  will  require  road  and  related  urban infrastructure  access for  construction  and future \ndevelopment  in  the  urban  district  surrounding  the  new  station.  This  new  development  area  is \nexpected to have more than 150,000 residents by 2030. To realize the opportunity presented by \nthe new railway, there is a need for new urban roads and public transport systems, and services \nare  required  to  serve  the  new  area  and  provide  an  efficient  and  low-cost  means  for  local \nresidents  to  access  the  new  railway  station  and  the  employment  opportunities  expected  to  be \ndeveloped nearby.   \n \nThe  Yudai  River,  a  winding  waterway  on  the  west  side  of  the  Ji\u2019an  urban  area,  runs \n8. \nthrough  the  new  development  area  and  is  integrated  into  the  irrigation  system  for  rice \ncultivation.  During  the  rainy  season,  flooding  affects  farmland  on  both  sides  of  the  river. \nRehabilitation of the Yudai River is needed to protect the new development area from flooding.    \n \n9. \nThe  existing  public  transport  system  in  Ji\u2019an  is  inadequate  to  serve  the  needs  of  a \ndeveloping  third-tier  city,  and  will  require  substantial  investment  to  improve  its  efficiency  and \nexpand  its  services to  the new  development  area.  The  bus  system transported  about  111,000 \npassengers per day in 2013 (increasing by about 7% per year since 2009). Buses are not given \npriority,  resulting  in  relatively  slow  and  unreliable  service.  Public  transport  services  in  the  city \ncenter are affected by increasing traffic resulting in declining operating speeds and longer travel \ntimes.  Traffic  signals  are  manually  controlled  and  uncoordinated  resulting  in  added  delays  on \nheavily traveled roads. Bus stops and multimodal connections at existing transport facilities are \ninadequate,  poorly  designed,  and  inconvenient  for  passengers.  The  multimodal  connection  to \nthe Ji\u2019an Railway Station is unorganized; provides no service information or weather protection; \nand requires passengers to navigate a long stairway with luggage, which is particularly difficult \nfor women with children, the elderly, and disabled. \n \n10. \nJi\u2019an needs to change its approach to urban transport to avoid an unsustainable future. \nSubstantial capacity expansion and quality improvements are needed to meet current and future \ndemand.  Public  and  nonmotorized  transport  must  be  improved  and  given  priority  to  ensure \nsustainable  transport  modes  provide  convenient  and  cost-effective  service  and  prevent \nexcessive motorization, congestion, and pollution. \n \nLessons.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  funded  three  earlier  projects  to \n11. \nsupport  bus  rapid  transit  (BRT)  in  the  PRC. 5 A  key  lesson  from  the  projects  is  that  when \n\n                                                                            \n5  ADB.  2009.

Manila;  and  ADB.  2013.  Report  and \n\n\fdeveloping  BRT,  an  integrated  approach  is  needed  with  careful  coordination  of  BRT  design, \nroad  development,  and  traffic  management.  Due  to  the  specialized  nature  of  BRT  planning, \ndesign,  and  operation,  a  program  of  institutional  capacity  development  for  the  municipal  bus \ncompany,  project  management  office  (PMO),  and  the  municipal  transport  bureau  is  needed. \nDrawing  on  past  lessons,  the  project  adopts  an  integrated  approach  that  also  incorporates \nmeasures to maximize the energy efficiency of bus operations on the BRT and feeder services \nby  introducing  hybrid  buses  and  a  monitoring  system,  and  providing  for  improved  multimodal \nconnections at the existing railway station.    \n \nThe project is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for the PRC6 \n12. \nin  the  areas  of  (i)  inclusive  growth  and  balanced  development  by  promoting  urbanization,  and \n(ii)  resource  efficiency  and  environmental  sustainability  by  promoting  efficient  and  sustainable \nurban transport and transit-oriented development.7 The focus on public transport and multimodal \nintegration fits well with ADB's Sustainable Transport Initiative, which identifies urban transport, \nclimate  change,  road  safety,  and  social  sustainability  as  key  opportunities.8 The  project  will \ncomprehensively  address  these  opportunities  and  position  ADB  to  increase  its  support  for \nsustainable transport in the PRC. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n13. \nThe impact will be an efficient, inclusive, and sustainable urban transport system in Ji\u2019an. \nThe  outcome  will  be  efficient multimodal  access to  major  activity  centers  in  Ji\u2019an. Through the \nproject, the planned high-speed railway station and surrounding new development area will be \nlinked  to  the  existing  city  with  well-designed  multimodal  transport  infrastructure,  greenway \ndevelopment, and integrated public transport services. The existing public transport network will \nbe improved through a prioritized BRT system and upgraded multimodal connections. This will \nreduce transport costs, increase the efficiency and attractiveness of the public transport system, \nexpand travel opportunities and regional accessibility to jobs and services, promote sustainable \nurbanization, and encourage a shift to modes of travel with lower emissions. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nOutput  1:  Public  transport \n\nimproved.  BRT  system  improvement  will  include \n14. \ndeveloping  a  6.9  km  BRT  corridor  on  the  existing  Jingganshan  Road  between  the  Ji'an  North \nRoad  intersection  and  Ji'an  South  Road  intersection.  The  corridor  will  have  dedicated  center-\nrunning bus lanes with 15 stations on island platforms. The project will procure 95 BRT buses, \nwhich will constitute about a quarter  of the municipal bus company\u2019s fleet.9 The station square \nimprovement will upgrade the multimodal connection between public transport and the existing \nrailway  station.  It  will  rationalize  vehicle  and  pedestrian  access  to  the  station,  install  weather-\n\n                                                                                                                                                       \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of China for \nthe Hubei\u2013Yichang Sustainable Urban Transport Project.

Manila. \n7  Transit-oriented development refers to mixed-use residential and commercial areas designed to maximize access \nto  public  transport  and  facilitate  pedestrian  movement.  It  is  typically  centered  on  a  transit  station  (train  station, \nmetro  station,  bus  terminal),  surrounded  by  relatively  high-density  development  with  progressively  lower-density \ndevelopment farther away from the high-capacity public transport facility. \n\n8  ADB. 2010.

The Yudai River runs through the \nnew development area where urban roads (output 3) are to be constructed and is integrated into \nthe irrigation system for rice cultivation. The Yudai River rehabilitation and greenway is needed \nfor  flood  control  in  the  area  and  will  provide  recreation  areas,  parkland,  and  paths  for \nnonmotorized  transport  and  facilities  that  will  connect  the  new  development  area  with  the \nexisting city. \n \n16. \nOutput  3:  Traffic  management  and  urban  roads  developed.  The  transport  network \nwill  be  developed  to  connect  the  city  center  to  the  new  development  area,  the  Yudai  River \ngreenway  (output  2),  and  serve the feeder  bus  routes integrated  into  the  BRT corridor  (output \n1). Five urban trunk roads with a total length of 19.3 km will be constructed along with utilities, \nstreetscape improvements,  pedestrian  enhancements,  and segregated  lanes for  nonmotorized \ntransport. Given the rapid growth of traffic demand and implementation of the BRT system, the \ntraffic signal system along the major existing and new road corridors will be upgraded. This will \ncoordinate signals at 37 intersections along the BRT corridor and the proposed urban roads in \nthe new development area. \n \nOutput 4: Institutional capacity developed. The project will build capacity for energy-\n17. \nefficient  BRT  operations  and  integrated  urban  and  transport  planning;  support  project \nimplementation  to  ensure  that  project  outputs  are  delivered  on  time  and  within  budget  in \naccordance  with  ADB  policies  and  procedures;  develop  and  maintain  the  project  performance \nmonitoring system; assist with procurement, financial management, and disbursement; oversee \ndetailed design and road safety audits; and ensure that safeguard measures are implemented, \nmonitored, and reported. \n \nSpecial  feature.  A  GEF  grant  will  support  environmental  improvement  by  maximizing \n18. \nthe energy efficiency of bus operations on the BRT and feeder services. The GEF grant will be \nincluded  as  joint  cofinancing  and  will  be  used  to  augment  project  outputs  to  improve  energy \nefficiency.  The  proposed  GEF  grant  will  fund  three  activities:  (i)  fuel-efficient  bus  operations \nusing  12  diesel  hybrid  electric  buses  (output  1);  (ii)  evaluation  and  monitoring  of  hybrid  bus \nperformance \nand  \n(iii)  development  of  an  integrated  transport  and  land  use  plan  (output  4).  The  GEF-financed \nactivities  are  designed  to  reduce  the  carbon  intensity  of  the  transport  system  in  Ji\u2019an  and \nprovide a low-carbon blueprint for future urban development.  \n \nD. \n \n19. \n \n20. \nThe  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $120  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources  to  help  finance  the  project.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per \nannum, and such terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements.

The project is technically viable with technology choices based on efficient \nand  proven  designs.  JMG  capacity  is  adequate  to  implement  the  project,  based  on  its \nperformance  on  past  and  ongoing  urban  transport  development  projects;  it  will  be  supported \nwith institutional capacity development during detailed design and implementation. The  project \ndoes not have any unusual technical risks. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nThe  project  (including  the  GEF-financed  component)  is  economically  viable,  with  an \n24. \nestimated economic internal rate of return of 16.4% and net present value of CNY549.6 million \ndiscounted  at  12%.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  covers  all  three  physical  outputs \n(excluding  institutional  capacity  development)  for  2015\u20132039.  The  estimated  costs  include \ninvestment  in civil  works  and  equipment,  land  acquisition  and resettlement,  and  operation and \nmaintenance.  The  estimated  benefits  include  savings  in  vehicle  operating  cost,  travel  time, \nreduced road crashes, and flood protection benefits. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the \nproject\u2019s  economic  viability  is  robust.  Other  benefits  that  could  not  be  quantified  include  the \nreduced costs of flooding, and improved air quality and quality of life. \n \n\n                                                                            \n11 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fThe  project  has  revenue  and  nonrevenue  components.  The  nonrevenue  components \n25. \ninclude  road  network  improvements,  construction  of  a  passenger  transfer  facility,  and  Yudai \nRiver  improvements.  The  BRT  component  will  generate  revenue  through  the  collection  of  bus \nfares from passengers and advertising revenue. Operating and capital subsidies are provided to \npublic  transport  operators  in  the  PRC  to  ensure  their  financial  sustainability.  The  financial \ninternal  rate  of  return  for  the  BRT  component  was  calculated  to  be  3.6%  after  tax. 12 The \nfinancial  internal  rate  of  return  after  tax  is  higher  than  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital \n(2.92%). The BRT component is financially viable. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n26. \nAll procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). The relevant sections of \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  will  be  included  in  all  procurement \ndocument and contracts. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy  was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment,  the  JMG,  and  JIDC,  including  the  project  management  office.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual \n(footnote 10). The financial management capacity assessment indicates that the JMG and JIDC \nfollow  the  PRC  policies  and  procedures  for  accounting  and  financial  management.  JIDC  has \nstrong  accounting  and  financial  management  capacity  and  experience  in  managing  large \nconstruction  projects,  however  it  has  no  experience  with  ADB-financed  projects.  Project  and \nfinancial management, implementation support, and on-the-job training in ADB procedures will \nbe provided through the institutional capacity development component. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n27. \nA poverty and social analysis, conducted in accordance with ADB guidelines, assessed \nthe  transport  and  economic  development  needs  of  area  residents.  The  project  will  benefit \napproximately  468,000  Ji\u2019an  residents:  63%  are  urban  and  37%  rural.  About  8%  of  the  urban \nand  6%  of  rural  residents  are  classified  as  poor.  The  project  will  facilitate  the  growth  of  a \nsustainable transport system and contribute to addressing existing and future transport needs. \nMany urban residents, especially women and the poor, are dependent on public transport. The \nproject  will  provide  a  convenient  and  efficient  mode  of  transportation  to  meet  their  mobility \nneeds. The inclusive aspect of the project is strengthened by the introduction of dedicated lanes \nfor  nonmotorized  transport  on  project  roads  and  within  the  Yudai  River  greenway.  Job \nopportunities  created  during  project  construction  and  operation  will  first  be  made  available  to \nlow-income groups to increase their income and quality of life. The project will reduce transport \ncosts,  improve commerce and  economic growth,  increase  local  residents\u2019  income,  and ensure \nparticipation of the poor and vulnerable in project implementation. A social development action \nplan is prepared with measures to enhance project benefits for local residents. \n \n28. \nGender.  The  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  gender \nanalysis found that the specific transport needs of women are a result of their social roles and \nresponsibilities,  which  often  combine  household  work  with  travel  to  work  outside  the  home. \nWomen are concerned with personal safety when using public transport. The gender action plan \n(i) incorporates  gender-responsive  features  in  the  project  design,  (ii)  promotes  increased \nemployment  opportunities  for  women,  (iii) ensures  women\u2019s  equitable  participation  in  public \n\n                                                                            \n12 The business tax for transport entities is 3.36% of total sales revenues; the corporate income tax for all businesses \n\nis 25% of profit. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nconsultation,  and  (iv)  builds  institutional  capacity  for  gender  mainstreaming. 13  The  GAP \nimplementation will be monitored and financed through the project budget. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n29. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  category  A  for  environment  as  construction  will  result  in \nloss of farmland,  woodland,  and riverine habitats;  and  it  will  have noise,  air  quality,  and water \nquality impacts. An environmental impact assessment and an environmental management plan \nwere  prepared  covering all  project  components  including  activities  to  be financed  by the GEF. \nThese  documents  comply  with  the  PRC  regulatory  requirements  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (2009),  and  were  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  on  9  May  2014.  The  budget  for \nimplementing the environmental management plan is $775,000. Public consultation was carried \nout during the project design and environmental impact assessment process, and will continue \nthroughout  project  implementation.  The  JMG  and  JIDC  have  good  capacity  for  environmental \nmanagement,  but  institutional  capacity  development  is  proposed  to  minimize  environmental \nrisks and ensure adequate monitoring and reporting. Environmental complaints will be handled \nthrough a grievance redress mechanism established for the project. \n \n30. \nThe  provision  of  a  safe,  efficient,  and  sustainable  urban  public  transport  system; \nimproved traffic management; and a new riverside park and greenway are expected to reduce \nemissions, travel time, and flood vulnerability, while improving the quality of the environment in \nJi\u2019an  and  creating  a  more  livable  city.  The  project  is  estimated  to  result  in  avoidance  of  \n0.9  million  tons  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  over  20  years.  With  the  introduction  of  hybrid \ndiesel  electric  buses  and  support  for  low-carbon  transport  planning  proposed  through  GEF-\nfunded activities, an additional 1.4\u20131.7 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions are estimated \nto  be  avoided  over  20  years. 14 Project  construction  and  operation  will  have  some  adverse \nimpacts  including  generation  of  dust,  noise,  and  air  and  water  pollutants;  conversion  of  210 \nhectares  (ha)  of  farmland  and  woodland  to  urban  development;  and  potential  impacts  on  a \nnational  protected  tree  species.  The  environmental  impact  assessment  concludes  that  the \nanticipated  environmental  impacts  and  risks  are  modest  and  can  be  limited  to  an  acceptable \nlevel through implementation of the environmental management plan and compliance with loan \ncovenants. No cultural relics or historical sites will be affected by the project in the impact area. \n \n31. \nClimate  change. Initial climate risk screening determined that the project is at high risk \nfrom  climate  change  effects.  A  detailed  climate  risk  and  vulnerability  analysis  determined  the \nnature and level of project risks and specified design features to mitigate the project risks.15 \n \n32. \nResettlement.  The  project  is  category  A  for  involuntary  resettlement.  It  will  acquire \n199.4  ha,  including  162.2  ha  of  collective  land,  and  37.2  ha  of  state-owned  land.  Rural  land \nacquisition  and \nincluding  \n184  households  with  806  persons  affected  by  house  demolition.17 Additionally,  the  project  will \nresult  in  the  relocation  of  90  urban  households  with  360  persons,  and  partial  demolition  of  \n14 enterprises with 188 employees. It will have no impact on the continuing operation of these \nenterprises.  The  resettlement  plan  adequately  addresses  the  involuntary  relocation  impacts  of \nthe  project. The JMG  has  endorsed  the  plan  and  disclosed  it to  the  affected  people. The  plan \nwas disclosed on the ADB website on 25 July 2014. \n\nrelocation  will  affect  6,789  people \n\nin  1,742  households, \n\n                                                                            \n13 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 Details are provided in  the Global Environment Facility (GEF)-Financed Component Description (accessible from \n\nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n15 Project Climate Risk Assessment and Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Of these, 1,029 households with 4,092 persons will lose more than 10% of their landholdings. \n\n\f \n33. \nThe estimated cost of land acquisition and resettlement is CNY504.22 million. The JMG \nwill  make  counterpart  funding  available  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  Resettlement \nimplementation will be monitored both internally and externally. The PMO\u2019s resettlement unit will \ncoordinate internal supervision and reporting of plan implementation. The JMG and JIDC have \ngood  capacity  for  managing  resettlement  activities,  but  institutional  capacity  development  is \nproposed  to  minimize  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  risks  and  ensure  sufficient  monitoring \nand reporting. The PMO will engage an independent external monitor for semiannual monitoring \nand reporting. Public consultations were undertaken during project preparation and will continue \nthroughout  the  project  cycle  as  per  the  public  consultation  schedule  prepared  under  the \nresettlement plan. A grievance redress mechanism was established to address the concerns of \nthose affected. \n \n34. \nthe PRC\u2019s majority ethnic group, comprise 99% of Jiangxi Province\u2019s population. \n \nF. \n\nIndigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples.  Han  Chinese, \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n35. \nThe JMG and JIDC have successfully carried out many large infrastructure projects and \nhave substantial experience in project implementation and management, but no experience with \nADB-financed  projects.  Training  on  ADB  safeguard  procedures,  procurement,  and  project \nmonitoring  procedures  was  provided  during  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance. \nConsulting services will assist the JMG, JIDC, and project implementation unit in strengthening \nproject  management,  implementation,  and  institutional  capacity.  Advance  procurement  action \nwill  contribute  to  reducing  the  potential  risk  of  delays  in  implementation.  Major  risks  and \nmitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment \nand  risk  management  plan. 18  The  overall  benefits  from  public  transport  improvement, \nnonmotorized  transport  improvement,  urban  road  development,  river  rehabilitation  and  energy \nefficient bus operation and the impacts of the project on the urban development are expected to \noutweigh the costs. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nDelay in implementation \ncaused by lack of \nexperience with ADB \nprocurement, monitoring, \nand reporting \nrequirements \n\nWeak project coordination \namong the project \nmanagement office, the \nJMG, and JIDC \nThe JMG and JIDC have \nadequate safeguard \nmanagement capacity but \nno prior experience with \nADB \n\nPrice escalation of \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nA qualified procurement company was selected and international and \nnational procurement specialists will be recruited to support the initial stage \nof project implementation. Additional consulting support and on-the-job \ntraining will be provided to JMG and JIDC staff to ensure adherence to \nADB policies and procedures and to minimize the risk of delays. A project \nmanager with ADB project implementation experience will be recruited \nusing advance contracting. \nThe project-leading group, led by the vice-mayor in charge of the project, \nwill coordinate among various agencies and resolve issues, including land \nacquisition and resettlement. \n\nSpecific clauses on safeguards management will be included in the civil \nworks and supervision contracts. The JMG will hire independent monitors \nfor resettlement and environment safeguard compliance. ADB supervision \nmissions will include safeguard specialists. The project includes consulting \nsupport for capacity development on environmental, resettlement, and \ngender monitoring. \nChanges  in  the  prices  of  construction  materials  prior  to  implementation \n\n                                                                            \n18 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \nconstruction materials or \nother costs might cause an \nincrease in total project \ncosts \n\nMitigating Measures \nwere  monitored  as  part  of  the  technical  assistance  and  substantial  price \nand physical contingencies provided to cover cost overruns.
