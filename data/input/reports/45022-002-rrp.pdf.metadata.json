THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Global Environment \nFacility (GEF), both to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Jiangxi Ji\u2019an Sustainable \nUrban Transport Project.1  \n \n2.  The  project  will  contribute  to  inclusive  growth  and  environmentally  sustainable \ndevelopment in Ji\u2019an by improving the efficiency and sustainability of urban transport.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  With more than 100 million people expected to move to urban areas during 2014\u20132020, \nsustainable support for rapid urbanization is a key development challenge in the PRC. Such a \nmass  migration  will  require  a  major  expansion  of  smaller  cities,  such  as  Ji\u2019an,  to  relieve \ndevelopment and environmental pressures on existing urban centers, and provide economic \nopportunities and higher incomes for the large population of poorer rural residents. Investments \nin urban infrastructure, transport, and related services are needed to support development in \nthird-tier cities. The PRC needs examples of good practice in sustainable urban transport to \ndemonstrate  the  benefits  to  cities  of  supporting  and  prioritizing  public  and  nonmotorized \ntransport3, while providing safe and efficient urban road development in expanding urban areas. \n \n4.  Ji\u2019an is located in central Jiangxi Province, along the Ganjiang River. The city is a \nprovincial-level  municipality  of  4.9  million  people  of  which  41.6%  are  urban  residents. \nEconomically, Ji'an lags behind nearby provinces and remains relatively poor. In 2012, per \ncapita disposable income was CNY20,282 ($3,253) compared with the national average of \nCNY38,460 ($6,169). Incomes have been rising rapidly, but remain just over 50% of the national \naverage. Ji\u2019an has five national poverty counties. \n \n5.  Ji\u2019an is a major center for tourism. Its hinterland includes the Jinggangshan National \nScenic Area, which attracts many domestic tourists, most arriving by railway and long-distance \nbuses. Ji\u2019an is considered one of the most important areas for revolutionary history in the PRC \nand a major draw for the so-called \u201cred tourism.\u201d4 The government has been actively supporting \nthe development of \u201cred tourism,\u201d in part, to promote socioeconomic development in areas that \nare generally more rural and poorer than the coastal areas. The city includes a large university \nand has an expanding manufacturing base for electrical equipment. \n \n6.  Ji\u2019an is located 210 km from Nanchang (the provincial capital) to the north and 600 km \nfrom Guangzhou (the provincial capital of Guandong Province) to the south. The existing Jing\u2013\nJiu  Railway  (Beijing\u2013Kowloon)  and  G45  Expressway  (Daqing\u2013Guangzhou)  provide  the \nfoundation for the regional transport network in Ji\u2019an. The Chang\u2013Ji-Gan high-speed passenger \nrailway  line  is  now  being  planned  with  a  station  expected  to  be  constructed  about  \n4 km west of the currently developed urban district in Ji\u2019an. Once operating, Ji'an will become \nbetter connected to fast-growing and relatively prosperous cities in Guangdong Province and \n                                                                            \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for Jiangxi Ji\u2019an Sustainable \nUrban Transport (TA 7965-PRC). \n3  Nonmotorized transport includes pedestrian, bicycle and wheelchair transport. \n4  \u201cRed tourism\u201d refers to tourist travel to locations with historical significance to the development of communism in \nthe PRC. ", "2 \nthe  provincial  capital  of  Nanchang.  The  opening  of  the  new  railway  offers  a  significant \nopportunity to improve the Ji'an economy by better integrating the region into the dynamic \neconomy of the southern PRC and by enabling development of tourism. \n \n7.  The city is typical of emerging third-tier cities in the PRC, and offers an opportunity to \ndemonstrate more sustainable urban transport development in line with the PRC\u2019s urbanization \nstrategy considered at the Third Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party (November 2013) and \nreleased in March 2014. The population of the urban district where the project is located was \n550,000 in 2013 and is expected to reach 730,000 by 2020 and more than 1 million by 2030. To \naccommodate planned growth, the city has been rapidly expanding its developed urban area. \nThe planned development of the new high-speed rail line serves as the focal point for a major \nnew development area on the west side of Ji\u2019an. The railway is expected to be operating by \n2020, and will require road and related urban infrastructure access for construction and future \ndevelopment in the urban district surrounding the new station. This new development area is \nexpected to have more than 150,000 residents by 2030. To realize the opportunity presented by \nthe new railway, there is a need for new urban roads and public transport systems, and services \nare required to serve the new area and provide an efficient and low-cost means for local \nresidents to access the new railway station and the employment opportunities expected to be \ndeveloped nearby.   \n \n8.  The Yudai River, a winding waterway on the west side of the Ji\u2019an urban area, runs \nthrough  the  new  development  area  and  is  integrated  into  the  irrigation  system  for  rice \ncultivation.  During  the  rainy  season,  flooding  affects  farmland  on  both  sides  of  the  river. \nRehabilitation of the Yudai River is needed to protect the new development area from flooding.    \n \n9.  The existing public transport system in Ji\u2019an is inadequate to serve the needs of a \ndeveloping third-tier city, and will require substantial investment to improve its efficiency and \nexpand its services to the new development area. The bus system transported about 111,000 \npassengers per day in 2013 (increasing by about 7% per year since 2009). Buses are not given \npriority, resulting in relatively slow and unreliable service. Public transport services in the city \ncenter are affected by increasing traffic resulting in declining operating speeds and longer travel \ntimes. Traffic signals are manually controlled and uncoordinated resulting in added delays on \nheavily traveled roads. Bus stops and multimodal connections at existing transport facilities are \ninadequate, poorly designed, and inconvenient for passengers. The multimodal connection to \nthe Ji\u2019an Railway Station is unorganized; provides no service information or weather protection; \nand requires passengers to navigate a long stairway with luggage, which is particularly difficult \nfor women with children, the elderly, and disabled. \n \n10.  Ji\u2019an needs to change its approach to urban transport to avoid an unsustainable future. \nSubstantial capacity expansion and quality improvements are needed to meet current and future \ndemand. Public and nonmotorized transport must be improved and given priority to ensure \nsustainable  transport  modes  provide  convenient  and  cost-effective  service  and  prevent \nexcessive motorization, congestion, and pollution. \n \n11.  Lessons. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has funded three earlier projects to \nsupport bus rapid transit  (BRT) in the PRC.5 A key lesson from the projects is that when \n                                                                            \n5  ADB. 2009. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for the Lanzhou Sustainable Urban Transport Project. Manila; ADB. 2012. Report and \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of China for \nthe Jiangxi Fuzhou Urban Integrated Infrastructure Improvement Project. Manila; and ADB. 2013. Report and ", "3 \ndeveloping BRT, an integrated approach is needed with careful coordination of BRT design, \nroad development, and traffic management. Due to the specialized nature of BRT planning, \ndesign, and operation, a program of institutional capacity development for the municipal bus \ncompany, project management office (PMO), and the municipal transport bureau is needed. \nDrawing on past lessons, the project adopts an integrated approach that also incorporates \nmeasures to maximize the energy efficiency of bus operations on the BRT and feeder services \nby introducing hybrid buses and a monitoring system, and providing for improved multimodal \nconnections at the existing railway station.    \n \n12.  The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for the PRC6 \nin the areas of (i) inclusive growth and balanced development by promoting urbanization, and \n(ii) resource efficiency and environmental sustainability by promoting efficient and sustainable \nurban transport and transit-oriented development.7 The focus on public transport and multimodal \nintegration fits well with ADB's Sustainable Transport Initiative, which identifies urban transport, \nclimate change, road safety, and social sustainability as key opportunities.8 The project will \ncomprehensively  address  these opportunities  and  position  ADB  to  increase  its  support for \nsustainable transport in the PRC. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact will be an efficient, inclusive, and sustainable urban transport system in Ji\u2019an. \nThe outcome will be efficient multimodal access to major activity centers in Ji\u2019an. Through the \nproject, the planned high-speed railway station and surrounding new development area will be \nlinked  to  the  existing  city  with  well-designed  multimodal  transport  infrastructure,  greenway \ndevelopment, and integrated public transport services. The existing public transport network will \nbe improved through a prioritized BRT system and upgraded multimodal connections. This will \nreduce transport costs, increase the efficiency and attractiveness of the public transport system, \nexpand travel opportunities and regional accessibility to jobs and services, promote sustainable \nurbanization, and encourage a shift to modes of travel with lower emissions. \n \nC.  Outputs \n14.  Output  1:  Public  transport  improved.  BRT  system  improvement  will  include \ndeveloping a 6.9 km BRT corridor on the existing Jingganshan Road between the Ji'an North \nRoad intersection and Ji'an South Road intersection. The corridor will have dedicated center-\nrunning bus lanes with 15 stations on island platforms. The project will procure 95 BRT buses, \nwhich will constitute about a quarter of the municipal bus company\u2019s fleet.9 The station square \nimprovement will upgrade the multimodal connection between public transport and the existing \nrailway station. It will rationalize vehicle and pedestrian access to the station, install weather-\n                                                                                                                                                       \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of China for \nthe Hubei\u2013Yichang Sustainable Urban Transport Project.

Output 2: Yudai River and greenway rehabilitated. The Yudai River runs through the \nnew development area where urban roads (output 3) are to be constructed and is integrated into \nthe irrigation system for rice cultivation. The Yudai River rehabilitation and greenway is needed \nfor  flood  control  in  the  area  and  will  provide  recreation  areas,  parkland,  and  paths  for \nnonmotorized  transport and facilities  that  will  connect the  new  development  area  with  the \nexisting city. \n \n16.  Output 3: Traffic management and urban roads developed. The transport network \nwill be developed to connect the city center to the new development area, the Yudai River \ngreenway (output 2), and serve the feeder bus routes integrated into the BRT corridor (output \n1). Five urban trunk roads with a total length of 19.3 km will be constructed along with utilities, \nstreetscape improvements, pedestrian enhancements, and segregated lanes for nonmotorized \ntransport. Given the rapid growth of traffic demand and implementation of the BRT system, the \ntraffic signal system along the major existing and new road corridors will be upgraded. This will \ncoordinate signals at 37 intersections along the BRT corridor and the proposed urban roads in \nthe new development area. \n \n17.  Output 4: Institutional capacity developed. The project will build capacity for energy-\nefficient  BRT  operations  and  integrated  urban  and  transport  planning;  support  project \nimplementation  to  ensure  that  project  outputs  are  delivered  on  time  and  within  budget  in \naccordance with ADB policies and procedures; develop and maintain the project performance \nmonitoring system; assist with procurement, financial management, and disbursement; oversee \ndetailed design and road safety audits; and ensure that safeguard measures are implemented, \nmonitored, and reported. \n \n18.  Special feature. A GEF grant will support environmental improvement by maximizing \nthe energy efficiency of bus operations on the BRT and feeder services. The GEF grant will be \nincluded as joint cofinancing and will be used to augment project outputs to improve energy \nefficiency. The proposed GEF grant will fund three activities: (i) fuel-efficient bus operations \nusing 12 diesel hybrid electric buses (output 1); (ii) evaluation and monitoring of hybrid bus \nperformance  under  BRT  and  normal  operating  conditions  (output  4);  and  \n(iii) development of an integrated transport and land use plan (output 4). The GEF-financed \nactivities are designed to reduce the carbon intensity of the transport system in Ji\u2019an and \nprovide a low-carbon blueprint for future urban development.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n19.  The project is estimated to cost $289.6 million (Table 1). \n \n20.  The government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $120  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, an annual interest rate to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per \nannum, and such terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The \nbase cost includes civil works (78.4%), goods (20.5%), and consultants (1.1%). The ADB loan \nwill cover civil works, equipment, project management and capacity development consulting ", "5 \nservices, and taxes and duties on expenditures financed by ADB.10 The GEF will provide grant \ncofinancing equivalent to $2,546,300, to be administered by ADB. ADB will make the grant \nproceeds available to the Ji\u2019an Municipal Government (JMG). The JMG will provide $167.1 \nmillion to finance civil works, resettlement, design, surveys and research, and contingencies.  \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n23.  Technical due diligence was performed to assess the investment components, including \n(i)  the  BRT  system  and  railway  station  square  improvement  (including  the  GEF-financed \ncomponent), (ii) Yudai River and greenway rehabilitation, and (iii) traffic management and urban \nroads development. The project is technically viable with technology choices based on efficient \nand  proven  designs.  JMG  capacity  is  adequate  to  implement  the  project,  based  on  its \nperformance on past and ongoing urban transport development projects; it will be supported \nwith institutional capacity development during detailed design and implementation. The project \ndoes not have any unusual technical risks. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n24.  The project (including the GEF-financed component) is economically viable, with an \nestimated economic internal rate of return of 16.4% and net present value of CNY549.6 million \ndiscounted at 12%. The economic internal rate of return covers all three physical outputs \n(excluding  institutional  capacity  development)  for  2015\u20132039.  The  estimated  costs  include \ninvestment in civil works and equipment, land acquisition and resettlement, and operation and \nmaintenance. The estimated benefits include savings in vehicle operating cost, travel time, \nreduced road crashes, and flood protection benefits. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the \nproject\u2019s economic viability is robust. Other benefits that could not be quantified include the \nreduced costs of flooding, and improved air quality and quality of life. \n \n                                                                            \n11 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "7 \n25.  The project has revenue and nonrevenue components. The nonrevenue components \ninclude road network improvements, construction of a passenger transfer facility, and Yudai \nRiver improvements. The BRT component will generate revenue through the collection of bus \nfares from passengers and advertising revenue. Operating and capital subsidies are provided to \npublic  transport  operators  in  the  PRC to  ensure their financial  sustainability.  The financial \ninternal rate of return for the BRT component was calculated to be  3.6% after tax.12 The \nfinancial internal rate of return after tax is higher than the weighted average cost of capital \n(2.92%). The BRT component is financially viable. \n \nC.  Governance \n26.  All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). The relevant sections of \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in all procurement \ndocument and contracts. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment, the JMG, and JIDC, including the project management office. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual \n(footnote 10). The financial management capacity assessment indicates that the JMG and JIDC \nfollow the PRC policies and procedures for accounting and financial management. JIDC has \nstrong  accounting  and  financial  management  capacity  and  experience  in  managing  large \nconstruction projects, however it has no experience with ADB-financed projects. Project and \nfinancial management, implementation support, and on-the-job training in ADB procedures will \nbe provided through the institutional capacity development component. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n27.  A poverty and social analysis, conducted in accordance with ADB guidelines, assessed \nthe transport and economic development needs of area residents. The project will benefit \napproximately 468,000 Ji\u2019an residents: 63% are urban and 37% rural. About 8% of the urban \nand 6% of rural residents are classified as poor. The project will facilitate the growth of a \nsustainable transport system and contribute to addressing existing and future transport needs. \nMany urban residents, especially women and the poor, are dependent on public transport. The \nproject will provide a convenient and efficient mode of transportation to meet their mobility \nneeds. The inclusive aspect of the project is strengthened by the introduction of dedicated lanes \nfor  nonmotorized  transport  on  project  roads  and  within  the  Yudai  River  greenway.  Job \nopportunities created during project construction and operation will first be made available to \nlow-income groups to increase their income and quality of life. The project will reduce transport \ncosts, improve commerce and economic growth, increase local residents\u2019 income, and ensure \nparticipation of the poor and vulnerable in project implementation. A social development action \nplan is prepared with measures to enhance project benefits for local residents. \n \n28.  Gender. The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. The gender \nanalysis found that the specific transport needs of women are a result of their social roles and \nresponsibilities, which often combine household work with travel to work outside the home. \nWomen are concerned with personal safety when using public transport. The gender action plan \n(i) incorporates  gender-responsive  features  in  the  project  design,  (ii)  promotes  increased \nemployment opportunities for women, (iii) ensures women\u2019s equitable participation in public \n                                                                            \n12 The business tax for transport entities is 3.36% of total sales revenues; the corporate income tax for all businesses \nis 25% of profit. \n ", "8 \nconsultation,  and  (iv)  builds  institutional  capacity  for  gender  mainstreaming.13 The  GAP \nimplementation will be monitored and financed through the project budget. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n29.  Environment. The project is category A for environment as construction will result in \nloss of farmland, woodland, and riverine habitats; and it will have noise, air quality, and water \nquality impacts. An environmental impact assessment and an environmental management plan \nwere prepared covering all project components including activities to be financed by the GEF. \nThese documents comply with the PRC regulatory requirements and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009), and were disclosed on the ADB website on 9 May 2014. The budget for \nimplementing the environmental management plan is $775,000. Public consultation was carried \nout during the project design and environmental impact assessment process, and will continue \nthroughout project implementation. The JMG and JIDC have good capacity for environmental \nmanagement, but institutional capacity development is proposed to minimize environmental \nrisks and ensure adequate monitoring and reporting. Environmental complaints will be handled \nthrough a grievance redress mechanism established for the project. \n \n30.  The  provision  of  a  safe,  efficient,  and  sustainable  urban  public  transport  system; \nimproved traffic management; and a new riverside park and greenway are expected to reduce \nemissions, travel time, and flood vulnerability, while improving the quality of the environment in \nJi\u2019an  and  creating  a  more  livable  city.  The  project  is  estimated  to  result  in  avoidance  of  \n0.9 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions over 20 years. With the introduction of hybrid \ndiesel electric buses and support for low-carbon transport planning proposed through GEF-\nfunded activities, an additional 1.4\u20131.7 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions are estimated \nto be avoided over 20 years.14 Project construction and operation will have some adverse \nimpacts including generation of dust, noise, and air and water pollutants; conversion of 210 \nhectares (ha) of farmland and woodland to urban development; and potential impacts on a \nnational  protected  tree  species.  The  environmental  impact  assessment  concludes  that  the \nanticipated environmental impacts and risks are modest and can be limited to an acceptable \nlevel through implementation of the environmental management plan and compliance with loan \ncovenants. No cultural relics or historical sites will be affected by the project in the impact area. \n \n31.  Climate change. Initial climate risk screening determined that the project is at high risk \nfrom climate change effects. A detailed climate risk and vulnerability analysis determined the \nnature and level of project risks and specified design features to mitigate the project risks.15 \n \n32.  Resettlement. The project is category A for involuntary resettlement. It will acquire \n199.4 ha, including 162.2 ha of collective land, and 37.2 ha of state-owned land. Rural land \nacquisition  and  relocation  will  affect  6,789  people  in  1,742  households,  including  \n184 households with 806 persons affected by house demolition.17 Additionally, the project will \nresult in the relocation of 90 urban households with 360 persons, and partial demolition of  \n14 enterprises with 188 employees. It will have no impact on the continuing operation of these \nenterprises. The resettlement plan adequately addresses the involuntary relocation impacts of \nthe project. The JMG has endorsed the plan and disclosed it to the affected people. The plan \nwas disclosed on the ADB website on 25 July 2014. \n                                                                            \n13 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 Details are provided in the Global Environment Facility (GEF)-Financed Component Description (accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 Project Climate Risk Assessment and Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Of these, 1,029 households with 4,092 persons will lose more than 10% of their landholdings. ", "9 \n \n33.  The estimated cost of land acquisition and resettlement is CNY504.22 million. The JMG \nwill make counterpart funding available for land acquisition and resettlement. Resettlement \nimplementation will be monitored both internally and externally. The PMO\u2019s resettlement unit will \ncoordinate internal supervision and reporting of plan implementation. The JMG and JIDC have \ngood capacity for managing resettlement activities, but institutional capacity development is \nproposed to minimize land acquisition and resettlement risks and ensure sufficient monitoring \nand reporting. The PMO will engage an independent external monitor for semiannual monitoring \nand reporting. Public consultations were undertaken during project preparation and will continue \nthroughout  the  project  cycle  as  per  the  public  consultation  schedule  prepared  under  the \nresettlement plan. A grievance redress mechanism was established to address the concerns of \nthose affected. \n \n34.  Indigenous peoples. The project is category C for indigenous peoples. Han Chinese, \nthe PRC\u2019s majority ethnic group, comprise 99% of Jiangxi Province\u2019s population. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n35.  The JMG and JIDC have successfully carried out many large infrastructure projects and \nhave substantial experience in project implementation and management, but no experience with \nADB-financed  projects.  Training  on  ADB  safeguard  procedures,  procurement,  and  project \nmonitoring  procedures  was  provided  during  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance. \nConsulting services will assist the JMG, JIDC, and project implementation unit in strengthening \nproject management, implementation, and institutional capacity. Advance procurement action \nwill  contribute  to  reducing  the  potential  risk  of  delays  in  implementation.  Major  risks  and \nmitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment \nand  risk  management  plan. 18  The  overall  benefits  from  public  transport  improvement, \nnonmotorized transport improvement, urban road development, river rehabilitation and energy \nefficient bus operation and the impacts of the project on the urban development are expected to \noutweigh the costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nDelay in implementation  A qualified procurement company was selected and international and \ncaused by lack of  national procurement specialists will be recruited to support the initial stage \nexperience with ADB  of project implementation. Additional consulting support and on-the-job \nprocurement, monitoring,  training will be provided to JMG and JIDC staff to ensure adherence to \nand reporting  ADB policies and procedures and to minimize the risk of delays. A project \nrequirements  manager with ADB project implementation experience will be recruited \nusing advance contracting. \nWeak project coordination  The project-leading group, led by the vice-mayor in charge of the project, \namong the project  will coordinate among various agencies and resolve issues, including land \nmanagement office, the  acquisition and resettlement. \nJMG, and JIDC \nThe JMG and JIDC have  Specific clauses on safeguards management will be included in the civil \nadequate safeguard  works and supervision contracts. The JMG will hire independent monitors \nmanagement capacity but  for resettlement and environment safeguard compliance. ADB supervision \nno prior experience with  missions will include safeguard specialists. The project includes consulting \nADB  support for capacity development on environmental, resettlement, and \ngender monitoring. \nPrice escalation of  Changes in the prices of construction materials prior to implementation \n                                                                            \n18 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nconstruction materials or  were monitored as part of the technical assistance and substantial price \nother costs might cause an  and physical contingencies provided to cover cost overruns. The JMG will \nincrease in total project  be responsible for financing all cost overruns, including land acquisition \ncosts  and resettlement. \n \nFinancial management risk  The government, the JMG, and JIDC will ensure the timely release of \ncounterpart funds, as per the loan covenants. An external auditor \nacceptable to ADB will conduct and submit to ADB an annual audit of the \nproject accounts in accordance with the International Standards of Auditing \nor National Auditing Standards acceptable to ADB. The project will provide \nconsulting services to support and assist in establishing financial and \nmanagement systems and controls, and help to ensure that ADB\u2019s \nreporting and monitoring requirements are met. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, JIDC = Ji\u2019an Urban Investment and Development Company; JMG = Ji\u2019an \nMunicipal Government. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.
