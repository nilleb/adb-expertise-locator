A more secure and sustainable future for Indonesia is \n2. \ncontingent  upon  increased  access  to  clean  energy.  The  country  presented  strong  economic \nperformance  throughout  the  global  recession,  with  annual  gross  domestic  product  growth \naveraging 6% during 2009-2012.2 If this growth continues, demand for electricity is projected to \nrise by more than 8% per annum until 2029. As Indonesia currently uses coal and oil to produce \n65%  of  its  electricity  and  fuel  its  economic  growth,  a  failure  to  diversify  into  cleaner  energy \nsources  for  power  generation  will  magnify  the  country\u2019s  contributions  to  global  greenhouse \ngases (GHGs) and ultimately its own exposure to climate change risks.  \n \n3. \nThe Government of Indonesia recognizes the imperative of sustainable growth and aims \nto  increase  the  share  of  renewable  energy  in  the  country\u2019s  primary  energy  supply  from  5%  in \n2010 to 25% by 2025 and achieve a reduction in GHG emissions of 26% by 2020.3 Indonesia is \nendowed  with  several  renewable  energy  options,  including  wind,  solar,  geothermal,  and \nbiomass.  However,  geothermal  energy  is  particularly  suited  to  support  Indonesia\u2019s  more \nsustainable future: \n\n(i)  Geothermal  power  comes  from  thermal  energy  that  is  naturally  generated  in  the  earth \nand most accessible and abundant near tectonic plate boundaries.4 Due to its location at \nthe  edge  of  the  Pacific plate, Indonesia  has  extensive  geothermal resources  estimated \nat about 29 gigawatts and equivalent to 40% of the global geothermal resource base.  \n\n(ii)  Geothermal power plants are very reliable and demonstrate high capacity factors. Thus, \nthey  can  provide  a  sizeable  portion  of  base  load  power,  unlike  intermittent  renewable \nenergy sources like wind or solar, and contribute to a more secure energy mix. \n\n(iii)  Geothermal  power  plants  typically  emit  less  than  10%  of  the  GHG  emitted  by  fossil-\nfuelled thermal plants, and thereby provide an effective means for Indonesia to achieve \nboth domestic and international climate change mitigation objectives.  \n\n(iv)  Power generation costs of large geothermal power plants in Java and Sumatra are less \nthan the country\u2019s total average power generation cost. Geothermal sector development \ncan  therefore  improve  the  long-term  financial  health  of  the  national  electricity  utility, \nPerusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), while reducing the country\u2019s reliance on fossil fuels.5  \n\n                                                 \n1 Financed by the ADB\u2019s Clean Technology Fund. http://www.climateinvestmentfunds.org. \n2 Sector Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n3 Geothermal Sector (accessible from the list of supplementary linked documents in Appendix 2). \n4 In a geothermal power plant, high-pressure steam from a production wellhead powers a turbine to generate energy. \n5 PLN. 2013. 2012 Statistik PLN. Jakarta.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nlong-term  operations. 6  Commercial \n\nIndonesia\u2019s 3,200 megawatt (MW) geothermal development project pipeline accounts for \n4. \n24%  of  the  capacity  of  geothermal  projects  now  planned  globally.  Despite  the  compelling \nopportunity presented by untapped geothermal resources, only 1,226 MW of installed capacity, \nor 4.2% of the country\u2019s total geothermal potential, has been developed to date. Challenges in \ngeothermal power development include high up-front costs and geological risks that can affect \nexploration,  development,  and \nfinancing  has  not \nmaterialized  even  though  geothermal  regulation  in  Indonesia  has  substantially  improved  since \n2003. The investment needed to develop the country\u2019s full geothermal potential will only appear \nwhen  the  actual  and  perceived  risks  are  reduced  through  the  financing,  implementation,  and \noperation of projects with the demonstrative capacity to initiate market transformation.   \n \n5. \nHistory.  The  project\u2019s  geothermal  resources  were  originally  explored  by  Unocal  North \nSumatera Geothermal in 1993. The company spent about $80 million in initial resource and site \ndevelopment  and  technical  studies,  but  suspended  its  works  in  1998  due  to  challenges \npresented  by  the  Asian Financial  Crisis  and  later  sold  its  development  rights to  PLN. In  2004, \nsoon after a law was adopted to promote private sector participation in the geothermal sector, \nPLN invited qualified power generators to participate in an Independent Power Producers (IPP) \nbidding  process  for  the  Sarulla  development  rights.7 The  first-ranked  bidder  failed  to  secure \nfinancing  during  2005,  and  the  right  was  offered  to  the  second  lowest  bidder,  a  consortium \nformed  by  Itochu  Corporation,  Ormat  International,  and  Medco  Power  Indonesia  in  2006. \nKyushu  Electric  Power  Company  joined  the consortium  in  2008.  ADB  and  the  Japan  Bank for \nInternational  Cooperation  (JBIC)  were  subsequently  invited  to  support  the  project  due  to  its \nneed for long-term foreign currency financing.  \n \nConcessional  financing.  The  proposed  project  will  be  ADB\u2019s  first  loan  in  Indonesia \n6. \nadministering resources allocated by the ADB CTF and the Canadian Climate Fund for Private \nSector in Asia under CEFPF. Funded by the multilateral Climate Investment Funds, ADB CTF \npromotes financing for demonstrating, deploying, and transferring low-carbon technologies with \nsignificant potential for long-term reduction of GHG emissions. It is implemented by multilateral \ndevelopment  banks,  including  ADB,  and  is  one  of  the  largest  multilateral  funds  helping \ndeveloping  countries  finance  climate  change  mitigation  projects.8 Given  the  inherent  resource \nrisks,  capital-intensive  development,  and  current  market  stagnation  in  the  geothermal  sector, \nADB,  the  government  and  development  partners  have  identified  a  clear  need  to  deploy  a \ndiscrete amount of concessional financing to leverage commercial lending and accelerate sector \ndevelopment.  \n\n2. \n\nProject Design  \n\n7. \nThe  project  will  develop  the  steam  resources  in  the  Sarulla  concession  area  and \nconstruct, operate, and maintain three geothermal power generation units with a total capacity \nof  about  320  megawatts  (MW).  The  units  will  be  powered  by  steam  from  production  and \ninjection facilities at the Silangkitang and Namora-I-Langit reservoirs, located in North Sumatra. \nThe  project  will  be  developed  and  implemented  under  a  30-year  energy  sales  contract  (ESC) \nwith  PLN,  a  30-year  joint  operating  contract  (JOC)  with  Pertamina  Geothermal  Energy  (PGE) \n                                                 \n6 As  a  result  of  the  drilling  required,  capital  costs  for  geothermal  plants  can  be  more  than  three  times  those  for \nconventional fossil fuel plants. In addition, future development of the geothermal market is unlikely  to benefit from \ndramatic, technology-driven cost reductions that have recently occurred in the solar, wind, and natural gas sectors. \nSee Geothermal Sector (accessible from the list of supplementary linked documents in Appendix 2). \n7 Government of Indonesia. 2003.

The  project  is  intended for  base  load  operation and  will  include  a  14 \nkilometer transmission line from Namora-I-Langit to a 150 kilovolt (kV) substation to be built by \nPLN  near  Silangkitang.  The  substation  will  connect  power  from  the  generation  units  to  the \nSumatra grid through a 275 kV transmission line, to be built by PLN. The project benefits from \nstrong contractual arrangements with creditworthy, investment-grade parties: the Government of \nIndonesia, rated BB+ by Standard & Poor\u2019s (S&P) and Baa3 by Moody\u2019s; PLN, rated BB by S&P \nand Baa3 by Moody\u2019s; and Pertamina, rated BB+ by S&P and Baa3 by Moody\u2019s. \n\n3. \n\nThe Borrowers and Sponsors \n\n8. \nThe  project  sponsors  are  Itochu  Corporation,  Kyushu  Electric  Power  Company,  Ormat \nInternational  and  Medco  Power  Indonesia,  as  seen  in  Table  1.

The project will help the government advance towards its renewable energy and \nclimate  change  mitigation  goals.    Successful  implementation  of  the  project  and  deployment  of \nconcessional cofinacing will lead to: (i) increased geothermal power generation in Indonesia; (ii) \nmore private sector investment in the geothermal sector; and (iii) increased electrification rate in \nIndonesia.  \n \nOutcome. The project outcome will be expanded geothermal power generation in North \n10. \nSumatra.  The  project  will  demonstrate  the  viability  of  a  large-scale  IPP  geothermal  project  for \nthe first time since 1999. By developing new geothermal, base load power generation in North \nSumatra,  the  project  will  help  displace  fossil  fuel-generated  power,  which  is  the  dominant \nalternative for base-load generation in the Sumatra grid. The construction and operation of the \npower  plants  will  generate  employment  for  the  local  community,  including  opportunities  for \nwomen,  and  support  climate  change  mitigation  through  an  estimated  net  reduction  in  carbon \ndioxide (CO2) emissions equivalent to 1.3 million tons per year. A smaller carbon footprint helps \nprovide healthier and more sustainable living conditions for the people of Indonesia. \n \n11. \ngeothermal power generation units with a total capacity of about 320 MW.  \n\nOutput.  The  project  output  will  be  the  construction  and  commissioning  of  three \n\nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n12. \nConsistency  with  Strategy  2020. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, \nwhich  emphasizes  support  for  environmentally  sustainable  growth,  and  development  of  the \nprivate  sector.10 The  strategy  supports  expanding  environment-friendly  technologies  for  clean \nenergy generation and energy efficiency, as well as a larger role for private sector financing of \ninfrastructure through  public\u2013private  partnerships. Through the  administration  of the  ADB  CTF \nand  CEFPF  loans,  the  project  increases  direct,  value-adding  cofinancing  in  nonsovereign \nprojects supporting multiple strategies and objectives under ADB\u2019s finance ++ approach.11 \n \n13. \nConsistency  with  the  country  strategy.  The  project  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership  strategy  for  Indonesia  for  2012\u20132014.12 It  supports  the  strategy\u2019s  second  pillar  of \nenvironmental  sustainability  through  climate  change  mitigation,  which  prioritizes  projects \ndesigned  to  promote  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency.  The  project  also  supports  the \ngovernment\u2019s  long-term  objective  under  the  endorsed  CTF  investment  plan  for  Indonesia13 to \ndeploy CTF resources to leverage commercial financing of geothermal projects. \n \n14. \nConsistency  with  the  sector  strategy.  The  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Energy \nPolicy, which emphasizes investment in energy efficiency, renewable energy, and wider access \nto  energy.14 Though  ADB  reached  its  internal  goal  of  $2  billion  per  annum  in  clean  energy  in \n2011,  the  project  helps  sustain  that  level  of  investment  in  2013  and  further  bolster  the  private \nsector role in catalyzing additional resources in the renewable energy sector.15  \n\n                                                 \n10  ADB.  2008.

In  compliance  with  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (2009),  the  project  is  classified  as  category  A  for  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  potential  environmental  and  social  impacts  of  the \nproject  have  been  identified  and  effective  measures  to  avoid,  minimize,  mitigate,  and \ncompensate  for  the  adverse  impacts  are  incorporated  in  the  safeguard  reports  and  plans.  \nSOL\u2019s  institutional  capacity  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and  environmental  impacts  is \ndeemed adequate.  Information disclosure consultations with affected people were conducted in \n\n                                                 \n16  Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\naccordance  with  ADB  requirements.17 The government  approved the  environmental  and  social \nassessments  and  management  plans  in  2005  and  2009.18 The  documents  were  submitted  to \nADB  and  disclosed  on  its  website  in  August  2009.  SOL  has  prepared  an  environmental  and \nsocial  impact  assessment  addendum  based  on  (i)  supplemental  environmental  studies  and \ninvestigation;19 and (ii) an environmental compliance audit report of existing facilities, including a \ntime-bound  corrective  action  plan20 to  meet  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  requirements.  An \naudit  of  prior  land  acquisition  was  conducted  and  the  corrective  action  plan  was  prepared  to \naddress potential economic impacts on landowners. The remaining land identified for acquisition \nis  being  procured  through  negotiated  settlement,  and  a  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  to \nmitigate any potential economic displacement. In addition, an indigenous peoples plan has been \nprepared  to  mitigate  impacts  on  members  of  the  Batak  ethnic  group  and  to  maximize  project \nbenefits for affected communities.  \n \n17. \nTo  help  avoid  the  anticipated  impacts,  SOL  will  implement  generally  recognized  good \npractices,  as  well  as  preventive  and  control  measures  outlined  in  the  World  Bank  Group \nenvironmental,  health,  and  safety  (EHS)  guidelines  and  laid  out  in  the  project\u2019s  environmental \nand  social  assessments  and  management  plan.  Key  community  concerns  raised  during \nconsultations included EHS, employment, corporate social responsibility opportunities, and land \nacquisition  impacts.  SOL  is  committed  to  developing  and  implementing  an  EHS  management \nsystem in line with applicable national legislation and industry codes and standards. Through a \ncontractors\u2019 safety management system, SOL has also committed to accord equal priority in the \nprotection of its contractors, vendors, customers, and company employees.  \n \n18. \nOther  social  dimensions.  The  project  is  expected  to  have  some  gender  elements. \nMeasures  to  benefit  women  have  been  incorporated  in  the  project  design  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and  Development  (2003).21 These  include  assistance  for  vulnerable \nwomen affected by the land acquisition, facilitating the employment and involvement of women \nand  collection  of  sex-disaggregated  data  during  surveys.  The  project  is  also  expected  to \ngenerate job opportunities during both its construction and operational phases, and SOL will try \nto meet the employment targets set for women and indigenous peoples.  ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions requiring SOL to comply with the \nnational labor laws and, in addition, take specific measures (including in relation to contractors) \nto  meet  internationally  recognized  core  labor  standards  for  the  ADB-financed  portion  of  the \nproject, in compliance with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy.22   \n\nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy   \n\n19. \nThe  sponsors  and  borrowers  were  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date), and policy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing \n\n                                                 \n17 Since  2008,  consultation  and  negotiation  activities  were  conducted  by  SOL  in  a  culturally  appropriate  manner, \nusing Batak facilitators and both the Bahasa Indonesia and Batak languages. Key information from the safeguard \nplans  were  disclosed  to  affected  villages,  project-affected  households  and  civil  society  organizations  during \nadditional consultations in August and September 2013. \n\n18 These  comprise  the  environmental  and  social  impact  analysis  and  environmental  management  and  monitoring \nplans.  Due  to  design  changes,  an  addendum  environmental  and  social  impact  analysis  was  prepared  and  is \nawaiting government approval. \n\n19  Supplemental  studies  on  water  resources  extraction,  potential  occurrence  of  natural  and  geologic  hazards, \nbiodiversity and cumulative impacts, hydrogen sulfide modeling, among other assessments were undertaken, and \nassociated management plans were prepared. \n\n20 A contingency budget has been allocated to implement the environmental corrective action plan. \n21 ADB. 2003.
