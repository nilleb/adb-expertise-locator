I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npolicy-based loan to the Kingdom of Cambodia for subprogram 2 of the Third Financial Sector \nProgram. 1 \n \n2.  The  development  framework  for  Cambodia\u2019s  finance  sector  is  based  on  the \ngovernment's  10-year  rolling  Financial  Sector  Development  Strategy  (FSDS).  The  10-year \nstrategy  was  recently  updated  as  the  FSDS,  2011\u20132020. 2 It  has  incorporated  the \nrecommendations  of  the  Financial  Sector  Assessment  Program  (FSAP),  2010  of  the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nmeets regularly with all development partners in the finance sector to discuss current issues and \ncoordinate activities. Development partner coordination was further strengthened during the \nupdate of the FSDS. As per the Government of Cambodia\u2019s request, the proposed policy-based \nloan for subprogram 2 is part of three subprograms to implement the first phase of the FSDS, \n2011\u20132020.  These  reforms  have  been  discussed  with  all  relevant  government  agencies, \nindustry associations, and development partners. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The export-led garment and footwear industries are still the main engines of economic \ngrowth in Cambodia, despite the government's efforts to diversify the economic base, including \nthe  services,  agriculture,  and  manufacturing  sectors.  The  recent  uncertainty  around  the \neconomic outlook for the European Union and the United States\u2014Cambodia\u2019s major export \nmarkets\u2014has softened the demand for these items. Expected gross domestic product (GDP) \ngrowth has fallen to 6.5% in 2012 and 6.7% in 2013. The impact of slower growth in garment \nand footwear exports should be largely offset by higher than expected growth in the services \nsector, supported by a strong increase in value of approved construction projects. Approved \ninvestment in construction activities went up by almost 85% in the first 7 months of 2012 to \n$1.38 billion, from $747 million during the same period of 2011. Together with foreign direct \ninvestment in property development, a 27% increase in bank credit to construction activities to \n$349.3 million by the end of June 2012 also helped compensate for reduced exports. Overall \ngrowth in bank credit was about 31% in June 2012. The presence of a robust finance sector \nwhich  supports  efficient  resource  mobilization  for  a  broad-based  economy  is  essential  for \nsustainable development. \n \n4.  The  FSDS,  2011\u20132020  is  aligned  with  Cambodia\u2019s  updated  National  Strategy  and \nDevelopment Plan (NSDP), 2009\u20132013, and Rectangular Strategy on Growth, Employment, \nEquity, and Efficiency, as well as with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Cambodia, 2011\u2013\n2013.3 The  government  launched  the  NSDP,  2009\u20132013  update  in  mid-2010,  with  the \noverarching objective of reducing poverty to 19.5% by 2015. The policy priorities of the NSDP \nupdate intersect closely with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, especially in the core areas of infrastructure, \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2011.

", "2 \neducation, and finance.4 The government seeks a new development paradigm to respond to \nchanges in the global economy, strengthen resilience to external shocks, and achieve higher-\nquality growth. \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Cambodia, 2011\u20132013 has identified the finance \nsector as one of the five priority sectors (footnote 3). The finance sector assessment in the \nstrategy  also  identified  the  lack  of  public  confidence  in  the  overall  financial  system  as  a \nbottleneck  to  further  finance  sector  development  in  Cambodia.  The  following  have  been \nidentified as challenges: (i) potential systemic risk (weak financial structure meaning highly \ndollarized economy, concentration of activities in few banks, and asset exposure for vulnerable \nsector including real estate), (ii) high information costs (with limited transparency and availability \nin terms of financial statements and credit information), (iii) moderate to high operating costs \n(rural  and  informal  nature  of  the  economy),  and  (iv)  weak  human  and  technical  capacity \n(scarcity of qualified staff for regulator and industry). As a result, access to finance to support \nthe country\u2019s growing economy has remained well below potential. Although the data in the \nsector assessment has been updated, the assessment remains relevant. \n \n6.  In designing the program, the following past lessons have been incorporated: (i) a set of \nlong-term  objectives  is  required  to  guide  and  shape  medium-term  policy  design  and \nimplementation; (ii) flexibility in design is important to accommodate changes in economic, \nsocial, and political circumstances; (iii) the time lag between adoption of reforms and their \neffective  enforcement  needs  to  be  shortened;  (iv)  substantial  technical  assistance  (TA) \nresources are required to build technical capacity. In addition, through the updating process of \nthe FSDS, 2011\u20132020, the importance of early establishment of the government coordinating \nbody covering consultation and translation was recognized as a lesson for future updates. This \nis important in maintaining the major concepts between the English version and Khmer (local \nlanguage) version of the FSDS, 2011-2020. \n \n7.  ADB has supported government reform efforts in the finance sector with the approval of \nthe first financial sector program for Cambodia.5 ADB\u2019s contributions are duly recognized in the \nfollowing  areas:  (i)  modernizing  the  national  payment,  clearance,  and  settlement  system;  \n(ii)  improving  access  to  domestic  deposits  and  credit  for  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs);  \n(iii) strengthening bank and MFI regulations and supervision; (iv) introducing higher standards of \naccounting, auditing, and financial reporting for financial institutions; (v) setting up a registry that \nrecords the assets that banks take as security for loans; (vi) drafting and passing the securities \nlaw; (vii) setting up a financial intelligence unit in the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) to \ncounter money laundering and prevent the financing of terrorism; (viii) setting up the Securities \nExchange Commission of Cambodia (SECC) and the stock exchange; and (ix) launching a \ncredit information bureau covering the banking industry and MFIs. \n \n8.  Based on successful implementation of the programs with effective and flexible ways of \nconverting  complex  policy  objectives  into  implementable  policy  actions,  the  government \nrequested continuing ADB support to the finance sector, which led to the design and approval of \nthe third program. Subprogram 1 for $15 million was approved in November 2011 and fully \ndisbursed  in  March  2012.  Implementation  of  subprogram  2,  estimated  at  $15  million, \ncommenced in December 2011. Subprogram 2 was successfully completed and significant \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2008.

The impact will be a sound, market-oriented financial sector to enhance the mobilization \nof financial resources. The outcome will be a growing, resilient, and efficient financial system. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n10.  The program comprises a series of three single-tranche subprograms to be implemented \nfrom December 2010 to December 2013. Subprogram 2 originally had 22 policy triggers and \n10 milestones.  With  changing  domestic  circumstances  and  development  priorities,  the \ngovernment requested minor modifications to three policy triggers and three milestones. An \nalternative  approach  has  been  proposed for  two  policy  triggers  and deferral  of two  policy \ntriggers to subprogram 3 (Appendix 4). The impact of proposed changes is within the medium-\nterm program framework and will not have any adverse implications for the program outcome \nand outputs. The program has four outputs: (i) improved legal, regulatory, and institutional \nframework, (ii) improved financial infrastructure, (iii) strengthened finance sector governance, \nand (iv) enhanced finance sector efficiency. Key activities for each output are described in \nparas.11\u201324. \n \n  1.   Improved Legal, Regulatory, and Institutional Framework \n \n11.  Update and enhance the legal foundation for banks and microfinance institutions. \nUnder the Second Financial Sector Program,6 the NBC strengthened prudential supervision, \nupdated regulations, and ensured the stability of the banking system. A comprehensive review \non the Law on Banking and Financial Institutions, 1999 (LBFI) conducted with ADB TA support \nunder the second program addressed the issues relating to consumer protection, bank secrecy \nprovisions to support the development of a credit information-sharing system, administrative \nprocedures for insolvent or distressed banks, and protection or immunity of bank regulators. In \n2010, the FSAP proposed specific areas to be amended in the Law on the Organization and \nConduct of the NBC and the LBFI. Although a draft revised LBFI reflecting the issues identified \nwas submitted to the Council of Ministers (COM), the NBC decided to incorporate the inputs \nfrom the FSAP. With NBC oversight, legal experts fielded under support from First Initiatives (a \ntrust fund administered by the World Bank) will undertake the consultation process with other \nconcerned government agencies where additional changes may be identified, and the NBC \nplans to submit the revised laws to the COM during subprogram 3. Under subprogram 2, \nsupport for initial assessment of the two laws was provided because of the delay in fielding legal \nexperts from the World Bank. \n \n12.  Strengthen bank supervision capacity and adopt measures to sustain financial \nstability.  The  memorandum  of  understanding  (MOU)  between  the  NBC,  the  Ministry  of \nEconomy and Finance (MEF), and the SECC is part of the 2010 FSAP recommendations and it \nwas considered crucial because of Cambodia\u2019s highly dollarized economy. Under subprogram \n2,  dialogue  on  the  MOU  which  establishes  procedures for  practical  information  exchange, \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2007. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Program Loan and \nTechnical Assistance Grant to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the  Second Financial Sector Program Cluster \n(Subprogram 1). Manila (Loan 2378-CAM and TA 4999-CAM).  \n  \n ", "4 \ncoordination and accountability among domestic supervisors for financial crisis was initiated. \nBecause of slow progress, the IMF Article IV mission in September 2012 proposed a two-phase \napproach, starting with work on the MOU for information sharing. In due course, a second MOU \nwill be signed, which sets out a time-bound process for instituting a comprehensive crisis \nmanagement framework. The NBC has (i) issued instructions to banks that are performing \nadditional non-bank-related activities to provide consolidated financial statements, (ii) signed \nbilateral  agreements  covering  supervision  cooperation  with  countries  that  have  banks  with \nsubsidiaries licensed in Cambodia, and (iii) issued regulations to cover some of the Basel I core \nprinciples. The NBC also produced audiovisual materials to promote wider use of the riel and \nwill continue this effort under subprogram 3, as well as the work on updating the corporate \nprofile of each licensed bank. \n \n13.  Strengthen prudential supervision and regulations of microfinance institutions. \nThe NBC has achieved significant progress in terms of a regulatory framework for licensing and \nsupervising MFIs. The Economist Intelligence Unit  report on microfinance in 20107 ranked \nCambodia  first  in  the  category  of  regulatory  framework  together  with  Pakistan  and  the \nPhilippines. Based on the fully implemented microfinance information system for improving the \nquality of off-site supervision under subprogram 1, the NBC also reorganized the supervision \ndirectorate into four departments in 2011, which helped improve its interactions with banks and \nMFIs.  The  NBC  worked  on  improvement  of  the  onsite  supervision  methodology  under \nsubprogram  2,  including  reporting  arrangements  based  on  the  new  organization  and  new \napproaches that contribute to improved supervision. Capacity development continued and NBC \nmanagement  provided  10  additional  staff  positions  (against  the  current  total  of  80  staff \nmembers) before the end of 2012 for supervision of financial institutions. Under subprogram 3, \nthe NBC will conduct an assessment of compliance with the Microfinance Activities and the \nCore Principles for Effective Banking Supervision.8 \n \n14.  Enhance legal foundation to support financial and commercial transactions. A \nstrong legal foundation to support Cambodia\u2019s financial and commercial activities is essential for \nsound economic development. A review of potential conflicts between the Civil Code supported \nby Ministry of Justice and other commercial related laws by other government agencies was \nconducted  under  subprogram  1.  Subprogram  2  supported  upgrade  of  the  financial  legal \ninfrastructure, including the proposed law for  a commercial court, adoption of  a consumer \nprotection  policy,  drafting  of  a  consumer  protection  law,  and  drafting  of  a  comprehensive \nfinancial trust law. The council of jurists at the COM decided that, rather than establish one \ncentralized  commercial  court,  each  existing  civil  court  will  have  its  own  chamber-specific \njurisdiction of commerce. The MEF\u2019s priority is to (i) introduce the legal framework covering \npublic trust, first by inserting provisions covering public trust arrangements in the 2013 Budget \nLaw; and (ii) draft a subdecree for its implementation. The consultation process to develop a \ncomprehensive financial trust law will continue with TA support from ADB under subprogram 3. \nThe consultation process and the review of draft laws with the COM took much longer than \nanticipated  and  therefore  caused  the  delay.  Under  subprogram  3,  both  a  draft  consumer \nprotection law and a draft financial trust law will be submitted to the COM, as well as the new \nLaw on Insurance to the National Assembly, which is proposed to be deferred from subprogram \n2 because of the provisions on compulsory motor vehicle cover. \n \n \n                                                \n7  Economist Intelligence Unit.  2010.

Modernize the national payments, clearance, and settlement system. The process \nfor modernizing the national payments, clearance, and settlement system started in 2006 when \nthe NBC established the payments policy unit. With TA support from ADB,9 the NBC developed \na plan to modernize the system. Under subprogram 2, the NBC has been working on upgrading \nthe interim solution, developed by the NBC Information Technology Division in 2009, to a \ncentralized full-solution software system for clearance and settlement of payment instruments. \nThe hardware has been procured and installed, and software development completed the final \nstage of full system tests before the market rehearsal with participating banks. The full-solution \nphase was commissioned in December 2012. Part of the restructuring of the NBC in 2011 was \nthe upgrade of the payments policy unit to the Payments System Division, and the Information \nTechnology Division to a department. The procurement arrangement for the shared switch will \ncommence after the full solution is in operation, although the funding has been committed by the \nMEF. The consultation process to review the draft e-commerce law is ongoing and will be \nsubmitted to the COM under subprogram 3. \n \n16.  Enhance  consumer  access  to  credit,  consumer  protection,  and  market \nconfidence. Under the initiative of the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Program,10 a \npilot  online  credit  information  system  offering  negative  data  was  developed  in  2006  with \ncooperation between the NBC and the Association of Banks in Cambodia. The initiative was \ntaken over by the Second Financial Sector Program and the plan to upgrade the system to \ninclude credit data covering both banks and MFIs has been implemented. Under subprogram 1, \na privately owned credit information bureau\u2014the Credit Bureau Cambodia\u2014was established in \n2011 as a joint venture involving the Association of Banks in Cambodia, Cambodia microfinance \nassociation, and an international service provider. Under subprogram 2, the Credit Bureau \nCambodia commenced operation in March 2012. Both the banking industry and MFIs have \ngiven  positive  feedback  on  the  benefits  of  online  credit  data  of  loan  applicants.  Under \nsubprogram 3, the NBC will work on improving the operation of Credit Bureau Cambodia in \nterms of governance, including confidentiality of data and fee structures to support financial \nsustainability. \n \n17.  Develop interbank market and government securities markets. Under subprogram \n1, the NBC introduced the negotiable certificate of deposit that can be used as collateral for an \ninterbank market. Under subprogram 2, in cooperation with the NBC the MEF has completed \nthe study on (i) developing capacity; (ii) considering the timing for issuance of Treasury bills in \nriel based on a predetermined borrowing program; and (iii) establishing a system for accrediting \nprimary market dealers of government securities. Under subprogram 3, the MEF and NBC will \ndevelop market procedures on the Treasury bills. \n \n18.  Develop domestic securities market.    The development of capital markets for equity \nsecurities will improve domestic resource mobilization and help domestic firms to directly access \nfunds for business development. The legal framework for capital markets was developed under \nthe  Second  Financial  Sector  Program  and,  under  subprogram  1,  the  SECC  issued  the \nimplementing regulations and officially launched the Cambodia Securities Exchange.

(Loan 2129-CAM). \n \n ", "6 \nsubprogram  2,  the  SECC  (i)  prepared  a  subdecree  on  bankruptcy  relating  to  market \nparticipants, (ii) formulated a capacity building program for its staff, and (iii) consulted with the \nNBC  and  MEF  to  undertake  a  self-assessment  on  the  SECC\u2019s  compliance  with  the  core \nprinciples of the International Organization of Securities Commissions. In April 2012, a major \nmilestone  in  Cambodia\u2019s  capital  market  development  was  reached  when  trading  at  the \nCambodia Securities Exchange started; the first issue involved the state-owned Phnom Penh \nWater Supply Authority; 15% of the total shares were offered to the market and it was fully \nsubscribed.  The  SECC  is  taking  measures  raising  financial  literacy  on  capital  markets  to \nbroaden the investor base and promote investor protection. In addition, the SECC initiated a \nstudy for development of a corporate bond market, with a target of starting trading in 2013\u2013\n2014, while the government bond market is still under consideration. Under subprogram 3, the \nSECC will submit the draft subdecree on bankruptcy to the COM and initiate an evaluation of \nthe legal framework for new markets, including collective investment schemes and securities \nborrowing and lending. \n \n19.  Develop  insurance  industry.  In  Cambodia,  the  insurance  sector  started  with  the \ngeneral insurance business. Under the Second Financial Sector Program the MEF worked on \ndeveloping  implementing  regulations  on  licensing,  a  tariff  on  premium  rates,  corporate \ngovernance, and solvency. To align with regional and international practices, a draft insurance \nlaw  was  submitted  to  the  COM,  including  provision  for  (i)  compulsory  third-party  liability \nautomobile  insurance  to  address  the  increasing  traffic  accidents,  (ii)  life  insurance,  and  \n(iii)  micro  insurance.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  MEF  issued  life  insurance  licenses  to  two \ncompanies\u2014one foreign company and one state-majority-owned joint venture. The MEF also \nprepared a plan for an insurance promotion campaign to increase market awareness and led \nvarious awareness workshops. The MEF will complete the actuarial study on life insurance to \ndevelop a mortality table during subprogram 3. \n \n  3.   Strengthened Finance Sector Governance \n \n20.  Promote  international  initiatives  on  anti-money-laundering  and  combating  the \nfinancing of terrorism. Cambodia has gained membership in the Asia Pacific Group on Money \nLaundering  and  is  committed  to  complying  with  the  Financial  Action  Task  Force  (FATF) \nrecommendations, international conventions, and United Nations Security Council resolutions. \nCambodia is currently under the FATF International Co-operation Review Group process and \nsince  July  2011  has  been  on  a grey  list  of jurisdictions  which  have  strategic  anti-money-\nlaundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) deficiencies but have given \nhigh-level political commitment to address the shortcomings through an action plan with the \nFATF. Cambodia issued a subdecree on establishment of a national coordination committee on \nAML/CFT in April 2012. Under subprogram 2, a national risk assessment framework and a draft \nnational  AML/CFT  strategy  have  been  prepared  for  committee  approval.  Eight  AML/CFT \nseminars have been conducted in Cambodia during 2012. Under subprogram 3, the Cambodian \nFinancial Intelligence Unit will adopt the national risk assessment framework and commence \nimplementation. \n \n21.  Enhance corporate governance and transparency in the finance sector. To build \nconsumer confidence in the sector, formal financial institutions have to be more transparent in \nhow they conduct business and consistently implement good governance practices. Under \nsubprogram  1,  the  SECC  developed  a  framework  for  implementing  a  code  of  corporate \ngovernance practices for listed companies. Under subprogram 2, the NBC required banks and \nMFIs to disclose loan terms and conditions according to a uniform framework that will help \ninform and protect clients, as well as addressing a program to align accounting and prudential \n ", "7 \nstandards with international financial reporting standards. Further, the SECC introduced a code \nof corporate governance practices for listed companies. Under subprogram 3, the SECC will \npromote use of the code of corporate governance for nonlisted companies and conduct an \neducational  campaign  with  emphasis  on  responsibilities  of  board  directors,  corporate \nsecretaries, and management. \n \n22.  Establish commercial dispute resolution mechanism. The government adopted the \nlaw on commercial arbitration in 2006 and a subdecree was issued in July 2009. Following \nestablishment of the legal and regulatory framework, examinations were conducted in 2011 and, \nupon passing those examinations, qualified arbitrators were registered as founding members. \nUnder subprogram 2, the Ministry of Commerce (MOC) made efforts to make the national \narbitration  center  operational,  but  revision  to  the  subdecree  to  allow  private  sector \nrepresentatives  caused  some  delays.  The  first  general  assembly  meeting  of  the  national \narbitration center for election of the first board of directors, including representatives from the \nprivate sector, was held in January 2013 and directors were duly appointed. Under subprogram \n3, recruitment of and training for new arbitrators will continue, while the business plan for the \nnational arbitration center to ensure its operational and financial sustainability will be finalized. \n \n23.  Improve accounting and auditing profession. Efforts to increase the national capacity \nfor  accounting  and  auditing  (the  infrastructure  that  supports  economic  development  with \ngovernance) started under the Second Financial Sector Program. The scholarship program for \ncertified public accountants was initially restricted to government officials, but results were not \nencouraging so it was offered to the public on merit. Since then, the results have improved. \nUnder the program, the focus has been redirected to development of an International Financial \nReporting Standards-based curriculum for universities to provide accounting degrees that are \naffordable to the public while maintaining financial support for ongoing scholarship holders. \nUnder  subprogram  2,  the  MEF  revised  the  Accounting  and  Auditing  Law,  2002  to  reflect \ninternational developments. In addition, the MEF worked on reviewing and updating the chart of \naccounts for public financial management, in line with the International Public Sector Accounting \nStandard, along with upgrading the government accounting system. Many senior government \nofficials  have  realized  the  importance  of  accounting  standards  for  government  financial \nmanagement through the operation of the upgraded government accounting system. Under \nsubprogram 3, the MEF will submit the Accounting and Auditing Law to the National Assembly \nwhile continuing the financial support for an International Financial Reporting Standards-based \ncurriculum for universities and the existing scholarship program. \n   \n  4.   Enhanced Finance Sector Efficiency \n \n24.  Modernize the business registration system. The MOC corporate registry system \nneeds to be consolidated and upgraded to improve the national database of corporate entities \nand  make  corporate  information  more  accessible  to  stakeholders  in  the  financial  market \nincluding investors, lenders, and the public. This will reduce the transaction costs and improve \nefficiency.  Following  the  review  of  current  systems  for  improvement  under  subprogram  1, \nsubprogram  2  supported  the  consolidation  of  current  systems.  However,  limited  technical \ncapacity for system development within the MOC and insufficient available MOC budget in 2012 \ncaused a delay in implementation. The MOC requested TA support from ADB in this regard and \nsubmitted a full budget proposal that will be reviewed by the MEF together with the 2013 \nbudget. With ADB TA support and the approval of adequate budget funds, this work is expected \nto be deferred but will be completed during subprogram 3. \n \n \n ", "8 \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n25.  A total of $45 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special Fund resources was programmed \nfor the Third Financial Sector Program, which will comprise three subprograms. The size of the \nbudget support program is based on (i) development financing needs for the sector as identified \nduring  country  programming  and  strategy  formulation,  (ii)  the  importance  the  government \nattaches to the reform program, and (iii) the estimated costs of designing and implementing the \nmedium-term reform program minus estimated financial support provided by other development \npartners.11 Each successive subprogram will be processed following the successful completion \nof the subprogram preceding it. The loan for subprogram 2 will be disbursed in a single tranche \nupon satisfactory completion of all subprogram triggers and following loan effectiveness. The \nproceeds of the loan will be disbursed in accordance with the provisions of ADB's Simplification \nof Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.12 \n \n26.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  \nSDR9,887,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance subprogram 2. The loan will \nhave a 24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions \nset forth in the draft loan agreement. Loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign \nexchange cost of items produced and procured in ADB member countries.13 ADB will retain the \nright to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of withdrawal application \ncertification. The closing date of the loan is 31 December 2013, by which date all proceeds of \nthe loan will have been fully disbursed. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n27.  The NBC will be the executing agency, and the MEF, MOC, and SECC will be the \nimplementing agencies. The finance sector steering committee and the technical working group \n(TWG), as updated under regulation 393 of 21 June 2011, will oversee implementation of the \nFSDS, 2011\u20132020 and coordinate with the government ministries and agencies concerned. To \nensure timely program implementation, the TWG, chaired by a senior official of the MEF and \ncomprising senior officers of the MEF, MOC, NBC, SECC, and other government agencies \nconcerned, will meet as needed to review progress and consider pending issues. The TWG will \nreport to the steering committee, chaired by the governor of the NBC, and will propose concrete \nactions to resolve any issues that arise. A senior officer of the NBC has been appointed as \nprogram director and will assist ADB in coordinating day-to-day program implementation with \nthe MEF, MOC, NBC, SECC, and other agencies. The program director will be required to \nsubmit  quarterly  progress  reports  and  an  annual  report  on  the  progress  of  subprogram \nimplementation and, in particular, on progress in implementing policy actions adopted for the \nprogram. Implementation period of subprogram 2 is from December 2011 to December 2012. \n \nII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n28.  The   program will generate economic  gains  through  successful  implementation  of \nmedium-term policy actions. The estimated benefits of the program far exceed the loan amount. \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2011. Policy-Based Lending. Operations Manual. OM D4/BP.

Improved financial infrastructure \nwill support further development of access to finance and other financial services. Strengthened \nfinance sector governance will lead to the improvement of quality of financial reporting and \neffective AML/CFT measures. Enhanced financial sector efficiency will reduce the information \nand transaction costs related to commercial activities.  \n \nB.  Governance \n \n29.  An assessment of the country\u2019s public financial management systems was carried out to \nbetter  understand  fiduciary  risks  and  determine  appropriate  fiduciary  arrangements  for \nsubprogram 2. The assessment took the sector work of ADB\u2019s report on Cambodia\u2019s country \ngovernance risk assessment and risk management plan into consideration.14 The government \ncontinues to emphasize strengthening the public financial management system, internal control \nsystems, and the functions of the National Audit Authority,15 which have mitigated the fiduciary \nrisk of the public financial management system as a whole.16 According to the 2010 public \nexpenditure  financial  accountability  (PEFA)  report,  the  report  indicated  mixed  results  but \nimproving performance since the 2002 PEFA report. Due to significant improvement with budget \nformulation, internal controls, treasury operations and cash management, accounting system, \nand internal and external auditing, Cambodia is rated by the 2010 PEFA report to be at par with \nother low-income countries at similar stages of development. Under subprogram 2, efforts have \ncontinued to (i) improve the management information system and reporting standards within the \nNBC, banks, insurance firms, and MFIs; (ii) promote transparency in the information released by \nbanks, MFIs, insurance firms, and listed companies; (iii) support the operation of the Credit \nBureau of Cambodia; and (iv) strengthen the enforcement of AML/CFT regulations. \n \n30.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  NBC.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  the  government  will  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with \ninternal  procedures  and  controls  following  international  best  practices  for  the  purpose  of \npreventing corruption, money laundering, or the financing of terrorism and covenant with ADB to \nrefrain from engaging in such activities. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n31.  Subprogram 2 is categorized as a general intervention to support sustainable economic \ngrowth and is expected to contribute to poverty reduction in an indirect manner.17 Further, the \npromotion of inclusive finance facilitated by finance sector development expands the outreach of \naffordable formal financial services for the poor and rural micro enterprises and so has direct \nimpacts on poverty reduction. While implementing finance sector reforms based on market \nprinciples has been gender neutral, the results show that improved access to financial services \nhas brought more benefits to women in rural areas. During subprogram 2, the NBC reported that \nlending by MFIs to women increased from 21% of loans in 2002 to 83% in June 2012.

Safeguards \n \n32.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program is classified \ncategory C for impacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigation Measures \n \n33.  The program assumes continuing political stability and macroeconomic recovery from \nthe global economic downturn. Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.18 The main risks are external challenges to \nsustaining  economic  growth,  weak  governance  and  corruption  in  the  sector,  and  weak \ninstitutional  and  human  capacity. With  the  design  safeguards,  the  integrated  benefits  and \nimpacts are expected to far outweigh any costs. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n34.  The government and the NBC have assured ADB that implementation of the program \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the loan agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n35.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and acting in the absence of the President, \nunder the provisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the \nBoard approve the loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR9,887,000 to the Kingdom of \nCambodia for subprogram 2 of the Third Financial Sector Program, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such \nother terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nloan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \nBindu N.

As an interim \narrangement, MEF, while committed to lead the \nconsultation process towards the submission of the draft \ncomprehensive trust law to the Council of Ministers (CoM) \nin 2013, proposed to insert the relevant provisions covering \npublic trust into the 2013 budget law that was approved in \nDecember 2012. The legal provisions will empower MEF to \nissue regulations on public trust area as interim measure.  \nThe Mission agreed that the TA support from ADB will \nassist the MEF with the interim arrangements and also \nwork with MEF towards completion of and the submission \nof the comprehensive financial trust law to the CoM in \n2013. \nxii.

MEF has made all the efforts to get it through \nthe various Committees of the CoM. It is now with the inter-\nministerial Committee of the CoM before being submitted to \nthe plenary session. The provision covering compulsory \nthird party liability automobile insurance to extend coverage \nfrom commercial motor vehicles to cover non-commercial \nvehicles has been proven very challenging.  Despite the \nprovision of data to support the increased number of road \naccidents and the technical support from ADB TA \nconsultants to help MEF\u2019s briefing that compulsory motor \nvehicle is generally accepted internationally, there appears \nto be more political reluctance because of the public \nconcern due to the general election scheduled for July \n2013.  One of the options offered from those opposing the \ncompulsory provision is for the insurance law to drop the   \n \ncompulsory provision. However, MEF\u2019s view is to retain the \nA\nexpanded compulsory coverage in the proposed law  p\np\nbecause of the increased number of traffic accidents and it  e\nn\nis generally considered as international practice.  MEF is  d\nix\ncontinuing to put pressure for clearance of the draft law   4\nwithout any changes by the CoM for submission to the     \n \n2\nNational Assembly between now and the end of 2013.  9\n \nxiii.
