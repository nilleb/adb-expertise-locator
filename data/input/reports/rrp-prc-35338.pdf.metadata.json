An environmental impact assessment was  undertaken; on 2 \nApril 2004, the summary  was published on the web site of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) on 2 April 2004. \n\nThe  Project  is  located  in  the  western  part  of  Hunan  Province,  one  of \nthe  poorest regions of  the  PRC.  The Project will  (i)  construct  a 173 \nkilometer  (km)  expressway  across  hilly  to  mountainous  terrain;  (ii) \nimprove 517 km of local roads servicing poor counties and townships; \nand  (iii)  provide  consulting  services  and \nto  enhance \nconstruction  quality,  road  safety,  and  project  monitoring  and \nevaluation. \n\ntraining \n\nThe  Project  will  support \nthe  Government\u2019s  Western  Region \nDevelopment  Strategy  by  supplying  a  link  in  the  vital  Changsha\u2013\nChongqing  corridor(cid:190) one  of  the  eight  prioritized  western  corridors \nincluded in 10th Five-Year Plan. The project area is largely rural and \nmountainous  with  limited  accessibility.  Around  56%  of  the  rural \npopulation  is  defined  as  poor  with  an  annual  income  of  below \nCNY900.  Road  infrastructure  is  inadequate  to  support  economic \ngrowth, a necessary prerequisite to tackle poverty in the project area. \nSome  86%  of  the  roads  in  Hunan  fall  below  class  III.  The national \nhighway (NR319), which runs parallel to the project expressway and \ncurrently  serves  as  an  outlet  to  major  trading  destinations  such  as \nChongqing,  is  a  combination  of  class  III  and  below  roads  with \npavement  in  poor  condition.  Over  65%  of  the  highway\u2019s  length \nexperiences frequent congestion and interference from nonmotorized \ntraffic. Traffic on NR319 has grown at around 7.3% annually over the \npast  few  years  and  will  exceed  the  highway\u2019s  capacity  at  several \npoints by 2008. A better road network in western Hunan is needed to \nfacilitate economic growth and to integrate the poor, isolated western \nregions with the economic centers. The Project is expected to boost \neconomic activities in western Hunan, encourage interregional trade, \nthus  reducing  poverty  in  the  project  area.  Consistent  with  ADB\u2019s \ncountry  operational  strategy, the  Project\u2019s  approach  integrates  the \nconstruction  of  the  expressway  and  improvement  of  local  roads  so \nthat  the  benefits  of  the  expressway  are spread  over  a  wider  cross-\nsection of local poor communities. \n\nThe Project\u2019s principal objective  is to increase economic growth and \nthus reduce poverty in Hunan. The Project will (i) enhance economic \nefficiency, \nintegration,  and \nimprove traffic safety; (ii) provide a link in the Changsha\u2013Chongqing \n\ninterregional \n\nfacilitate \n\ntrade, \n\nfoster \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\nwestern  corridor;  (iii)  spread  economic  and  social  benefits  over  a \nwider  cross-section  of  local  communities  by  improving  accessibility \nfor  the  rural  poor  in  the  corridor;  and  (iv)  help  improve  people\u2019s \nincomes and well-being. The Project comprises (i) constructing a 173 \nkm,  4\u2013lane,  access\u2013controlled,  toll  expressway  from  Changde  to \nHuaihua,  including  tunnels  and  bridges,  interchanges,  toll  stations, \nand service areas; (ii) upgrading or improving 517 km of local roads, \nthereby  providing  improved  access  to  poor,  minority  areas;  (iii) \nprocuring equipment for road maintenance and  safety, toll collection, \nsurveillance  and  communications,  tunnel  ventilation  and  lighting, \nvehicle axle  load  testing,  and  environmental  protection;  (iv) provide \nfor  land  acquisition  and  resettlement;  and  (v)  provide  consulting \nservices  for  construction  supervision,  safety  audits,  monitoring  and \nevaluation, and capacity building. \n\nThe total cost of the Project is the equivalent of $778.1 million, with a \nforeign exchange cost of  $314.2  million  (40%) and a local currency \ncost equivalent  to  $463.9  million  (60%).  The  cost  of  the  local  road \ncomponent  is  $81.9  million.  Of the  $312.5 million  ADB  loan,  $12.5 \nmillion will finance the local road component. \n\n \n \n Source \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nADB loan \nMinistry of Communications  \nHunan Provincial Government \nDomestic loan  \nTotal \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nForeign \nExchange \n312.5 \n0.0 \n1.7 \n0.0 \n314.2 \n\n       ($ million)  \nTotal \nCost \n312.5 \n106.4 \n40.0 \n319.2 \n778.1 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n0.0 \n106.4 \n38.3 \n319.2 \n463.9 \n\n          \n\n \n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $312.5 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nprovided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \nlending  facility.

The local road improvement program will be \nimplemented under the overall responsibility of HCD. \n\nGoods  and  services  financed  by  the  ADB  loan  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works for the \nexpressway will be procured through international competitive bidding. \nProcurement  for  the  local  roads  financed  by  the  $12.5 million  ADB \nloan  will  use  local  competitive  bidding,  while  procurement  for  the \nlocal  roads  under  government  financing  will  follow  government \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Equipment will be procured through \ninternational  competitive  bidding.  ADB approved  advance action for \nprocurement of civil works  in May 2004. \n\nThe Project will provide 49 person-months of international consulting \nservices  and  about  5,184  person-months  of  domestic  consulting. \nInternational consulting services will be provided under the Project to \n(i)  assist  in  project  management  during  the  construction  period;  (ii) \nprovide  expertise  in  tunnel  and  bridge  construction;  (iii)  assist  in \npreparing the operation and maintenance concession framework and \nbidding documents; (iv) enhance the provision of transport services; \n(v)  conduct  a  safety  audit  of  the  project  design  and  make \nrecommendations on improving the safety of completed construction \nworks; (vi) help set up and implement quality control procedures; (vii) \nassist  in  formulating  a  human  resource  development  and  training \nimplement  a  project \nprogram;  and  (viii)  help  establish  and \nperformance  management  system,  including  the  assessment  of  the \nimpact on poverty reduction. Of the 5,184 person-months of domestic \nconsulting services, 300 person-months will be allocated to the local \nroad component for ensuring proper design and supervision, project \nmonitoring  and  evaluation,  training  of  the  engineering  staff,  and \nmanaging the Project.  \n\nOverall  project  supervision  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  chief \nsupervision  engineer\u2019s  office.  The  chief  supervision  engineer  (CSE) \nwill be assisted by two deputy CSEs, one of whom will be the team \nleader  of  the  international  consultants.  He  or  she will  help the CSE \nwith  project  and  contract  management  activities,  and  certify  the \ncontractor\u2019s progress payments and contract variations prior to their \napproval  by  the  CSE.  The  international  consultants  will  be  financed \nfrom  the  ADB  loan;  they  will  be  recruited  based  on  the  quality  and \ncost-based selection method in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants .

The better road conditions will  \nreduce  vehicle  operating  costs,  a  benefit  that  is  expected  to  flow \ndown \ntime.  The  project \nexpressway  will  directly  benefit  transport  providers,  bus  and  truck \noperators,  passengers,  and  traders.  It  will  speed  up  transport, \nprovide  a  comfortable  ride,  improve  road  safety,  and  reduce \naccidents.  Migration,  an important  source  of  cash  income  for  most \nrural  households,  will  also  increase  with  better  access  to  other \nregions.  Poor  farmers  will  benefit  from  better  profit  margins  gained \nthrough  lowered  transport  costs  of  agricultural  inputs  and  outputs, \nand higher market competition. The poor in Yuanling and Fenghuang \ncounties  will obtain benefits by increased  tourism,  as the improved \nroads will help spur the tourism potential in the area. Improved roads \nwill  also  facilitate  the  flow  of  information.  Some  1.9  million  people \n(66%  of  the  total  population  in  the  project  area)  will  directly  benefit \nfrom the Project, of whom, around 42%  are ethnic minorities. Of the \n1.3  million  rural  beneficiaries,  49%  are  poor,  including  the  287,000 \npoor  beneficiaries  of  the  local  road  component.  The  economic \ninternal rate of return  for the Project  is  estimated  at  18.6%  and  the \nfinancial  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  expressway  component  at \n7.6%, higher than the 4.4% real weighted average cost of capital.  \n\nThe Project is not expected to be subject to any significant technical \nrisks.  Tunnels  and deep-cut   works   will   be  carefully  investigated   \nbefore construction and monitored to avoid implementation problems. \nThe  expected  continued  economic  growth  and  the  ensuing  traffic \nincrease  limit  the  risk  that  potential  economic  benefits  will  not \nmaterialize. Initial traffic was estimated based on the actual traffic of \nthe  ADB-financed  expressways  in  the  project  corridor.  Sensitivity \nanalysis  indicates  that  the  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  are \nstable. Since the Project will generate revenue in domestic currency, \na financial risk is related to changes in the exchange rate. However, \nsensitivity tests indicate that an adverse change in the exchange rate \nwill have only a  minimal effect on the financial internal  rate of return. \nA  major  environmental  risk  is  possible  soil  erosion.  A  soil  erosion \nplan has been developed, and incremental costs have been included \nin the project cost. The villages in the project area may be at risk of \nacquiring  and  transmitting  human  immunodeficiency  virus/acquired \nimmunodeficiency  syndrome  Targeted  and  broad-based  advocacy \nand  awareness  programs  will  be  carried  out  in  the  project  area  to \nmitigate this risk. \n\n\f \n\n\f \n1. \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Hunan Roads Development II Project. \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORT UNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe  PRC\u2019s  economic  growth  since  the  1980s  has  resulted  in  an  unprecedented \nexpansion in intra- and interprovincial traffic. The economy\u2019s changing structure and increasing \ndiversification have altered the pattern of transport demand. The demand for road transport has \noutpaced that of other transport modes. There is a rapidly increasing  movement of goods and \npassengers by road, which is more flexible and responsive than other modes to the needs of a \nmarket  economy.  The  shift  in  transport  demand also reflects  the  loosening  of  anticompetitive \nrestrictions  in  the  road  transport  industry  itself.  Between  1990  and  2003,  road  traffic  grew \naround 9.6% per annum (p.a.) for passenger traffic, reaching 769.6 billion passenger-kilometers \n(km);  and  around  5.7%   p.a.  for  freight,  reaching  708  billion  ton-km.  In  2003,  road  traffic \naccounted  for  55.7%  of  the  country\u2019s  total  passenger  traffic  and  13.2%  of  total  freight  traffic.  \nWith  the  country\u2019s rapid economic growth,  low vehicle ownership rates, lower car prices after \nWorld  Trade  Organization  accession,  increasing  access  to  loans  to  finance  automobile \npurchases, and investment in automotive manufacturing ($6 billion provided by the state banks \nduring 2001\u20132003), the fast expansion in vehicle fleets will continue in the coming years. ADB \nsupports the improvements of road transport efficiency and service quality through its technical \nassistance (TA) program.1  \n \n3. \nTo meet the growing demand for improved access to markets and services and to build \nan  enabling  environment  for  the  private  sector,  the  Government  has  made  major  efforts  to \nincrease  the  country\u2019s  road  capacity. 2  The  heart  of  the  road  network  development  is  the \nNational  Trunk  Highway  System  (NTHS),  a  35,000  km  system  of  interprovincial  expressways \nand high-class highways to be constructed over 20 years (target completion: 2007). The NTHS \nwill  be  complemented  by  the  development  of  a  network  of  national,  provincial,  county,  and \ntownship roads. The Government\u2019s road development policies are: (i) constructing expressways \nto  expand  the  NTHS  and  link  all  cities  that  have  a  population  more  than  500,000  and  (ii) \ndeveloping secondary roads, particularly those that will  help reduce poverty and promote  rural \nmarkets. The Government adopted the Western Region Development Strategy (WRDS), a key \ntheme of the 10th Five-Year Plan (FYP) (2001\u20132005), to enhance economic development in the \nwestern  part  of  the  country,  where  most  of  the  poor  reside.  The  WRDS  aims  to  reduce  the \ndisparity  between  the  western  and  coastal  regions,  and  assigns a high priority to  road sector \ndevelopment  as  a  means  to  promote  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  in  the  western \nregion.  The  proposed  Project,  a  173  km  section  of  the  Changsha-Chongqing  corridor,  will \nsupport the WRDS by building an important link in one of the eight  prioritized western corridors \nincluded  in  10FYP 3 and improving  access  to  Changsha  and  other  cities  in  the  poor  western \nregion. The project framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Peoples Republic of China for Policy Reform in Road Transport. Manila. \n2   Roads  in PRC  are classified  by design capacity  into  expressways,  and  class  I-IV  and  unclassified  roads. The \ndesign capacity of class I is 7,500-15,000 medium truck equivalent (MTE), and 1,500-3,750 MTE for class II road.  \nMTE is a standard unit for measuring traffic volume in the PRC.  Passenger cars are equal to 0.5 MTE and large \narticulated trucks, to 2.0 MTE. \n\n3  These  include  Altai-Hongqilafu,  Xi\u2019ning-Korla,  Yinchuan-Wuhan,  Arongqi-Behai,  Lanzhou-Mohan,  Xi\u2019an-Hefei, \n\nChangsha-Chongqing, and Chengdu-Zhangmu. \n\n\f 2\n\nAs a result, the road network grows from 1.16 million km in 1995 to 1.81 million km in 2003, \n4. \nfor an average annual increase of 81,300 km.4 The length of expressways increases from 2,141 \nkm to 29,800 km.5 The density has increased from 12.1 km per 100 square km (km2) in 1995 to \n18.6 km per 100 km2 in 2003. The new road development program (2003\u20132020) will increase the \nroad  network  to  over  3  million  km,  or  by  68,000  km  annually.  Expressways  will  increase to \n70,000 km.  In  2003  the  Government  launched  5,300  rural  road  projects,  covering  78,000  km \nand costing $9.1 billion.  \n \nB. \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nProblems \n\n \nDespite the huge investment, the road network is still underdeveloped in both quality and \n5. \nextent, and  does  not  provide  access  to  large  parts  of  the  country,  particularly  in  the  poorer \ninland  regions.  High-standard  roads  (above  class  II)  account  for  only  12%  of  the  total  network. \nThe remaining 88% are medium - to low-grade paved roads and gravel roads. The road density for \nevery 1 million inhabitants is only 1,100 km. The growing road transport demand has put a strain \non  the  road  infrastructure,  as  manifested  by  the  congestion  and  bottlenecks  in  the  network. \nWeaknesses  in  the  road  network  have  resulted in  high  transport  and  logistics  cost between \ninterior provinces and the coastal ports.6 A road sector analysis is included in Appendix 2. \n \n6. \nHunan, located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, is bordered by Jiangxi to the \neast, Chongqing to the west, Guangxi to the south, and Hubei to the north. In 2003, the region\u2019s \nper capita GDP was CNY 6,549, 85% of the national average. Agriculture is the mainstay of the \neconomy, employing 69% of the labor force. The major agricultural products\u2014ramie, wheat, rice, \ncorn, tea, and citrus (cid:190) are grown in the Yuan  Valley, through which the Project passes. Hunan \nhas a potential for industrial development. Its industrial output grew over 20% p.a. during 2000-\n2003. The major sectors include steel, nonferrous metals, coal, chemical processing, machinery, \nand textiles. The demand for its products from other provinces has sharply increased in recent \nyears. However, weaknesses in road infrastructure lag, failing to adequately support economic \ngrowth. Some 86% of the roads in Hunan are below Class III. The national highway (NR319), \nwhich  runs  parallel  to  the  project  expressway  and  currently  serves  as  a  link  to major trading \ndestinations such as Chongqing, is a combination of Class III and lower roads. The pavement is \nin  poor  condition.  Two  thirds  of  the  road  suffers  frequent  congestion  and  nonmotorized  traffic \ninterfere with fast moving traffic, which frequently lead to accidents. Traffic on NR319 has grown \nat around 7.3% p.a. in the past few years and will exceed its capacity at several points by 2008.  \n \nThe  Project  is  located  in  the  western  part  of  Hunan(cid:190) one of the poorest  areas  in the \n7. \nPRC. The project area is largely rural and mountainous with  limited accessibility. About 56% of \nthe rural population is defined as poor with annual per capita  incomes of below CNY 900. The \npoor are concentrated in remote communities in mountains. Due to geographical isolation and \nthe high cost of motorized transport, most farmers in the mountainous poor villages do not have \nadequate  access  to  markets  and  have  limited  mobility  beyond  their  immediate  communities. \nLow-grade farm-to-market roads and collector markets increase handling costs and postharvest \nlosses,  further  depressing  farm-gate  returns  and  the  incentive  to  raise  production.  Inadequate \n\n                                                 \n4  The  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  improve  road  infrastructure  is  reflected  in  a  large  investment  program,  which \n\nreach $44.9 billion in 2003 (source: Minis try of Communications (MOC). 2004. Transport Statistics). \n\n5  The PRC now ranks second after the United States in terms of length of expressways. \n6  The shortage of  adequate road networks has slowed economic growth and regional development. A World Bank \nstudy argued that the annual economic costs of  insufficient road infrastructure in the PRC in the 1980s amounted \nto 1% of its gross national product (World Development Report, 1994). \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nroad  access  is  an  impediment  to  higher  agricultural  productivity  and  prevents  the  poor  from \ntaking  advantage  of  job  opportunities  in  towns.  Better  roads  in  western Hunan  is  needed to \npromote economic growth and integrate the poor, isolated regions with the economic centers. \n \nThe  private  sector  will  be  the  PRC\u2019s  engine  of  employment  generation  and  a  main \n8. \nmechanism  to  increase  productivity.  According  to  an  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) survey, \ninfrastructure constraints are among the impediments faced by private companies operating in \nthe  PRC. 7  If  private  investment  is  to  be  attracted  to  the  poor  interior  provinces,  road \ninfrastructure,  among  other  things,  needs  to  be  improved.  The  country\u2019s  road  investment \nrequirements  (1996\u20132010)  are  estimated  at  $504  billion.  Available  revenues  are  estimated  at \n$302 billion from road user charges and $29 billion from toll collections, leaving a financing gap \nof $173 billion. Consistent with ADB\u2019s policy dialogue, the Government creates a framework to \nattract private financing for roads. ADB provided TA to strengthen the institutional capacity for \nthe private sector participation in roads.8 \n \n\n2. \n\nOpportunities \n\n \n9. \nADB\u2019s  operational  strategy  in  the  PRC\u2019s  road  sector  supports  (i) the  construction of \nroads  that  connect  major  growth  centers  with  hinterland  economies;  (ii) the  integration of the \nnetwork,  so  that  the  NTHS  is  supported  by  a  system  of  local  roads,  particularly  those  that \nprovide access to poor areas; (iii) the promotion of road safety; (iv) institutional strengthening to \nincrease  financial  and  managerial  efficiency  in  expressway  operation;  (v)  the  adoption  of \nappropriate  pricing  policies  to  optimize  the  road  transport  capacity;  and  (vi)  the  use  of \nalternative  methods  of  investment  financing.  Consistent  with  this  strategy,  policy  dialogue \nfocuses  on  key  issues,  such  as  strengthening  the  poverty  reduction  impact,  enhancing  the \nprovision of transport services, operation and maintenance concession to the private sector, and \nimproving road safety. These comprise the special features of the Project. \n \nThe Project, which will support the Government\u2019s 10FYP and WRDS, is consistent with \n10. \nADB\u2019s  country  operational  strategy.  The  173  km  expressway  from  Changde  to  Huaihua  will \nsupply  a  link  in  the  Changsha-Chongqing  corridor.  The  expressway will shorten the distance \nbetween Changde and  Huaihua by 45 km and will reduce  the journey time by 2\u20133 hours, thus \noffering  a  considerably  faster and  safer  alternative.  By lowering transport costs and improving \nthe frequency and level of transport services, the Project is expected to spur economic activities \nand interregional trade, and thereby help reduce poverty in the project area. The development \nof  the  road  network  in  western Hunan  will help  transmit  the  benefits  of  the  eastern  region\u2019s \neconomic growth to the poor region. The local road improvement has been integrated into the \nProject to spread the benefits of the expressway over a wider cross-section of poor communities. \nThe  integrated  approach  will  improve  the  rural  poor\u2019s  mobility  and  road  access  to  economic \nopportunities, thereby helping raise their incomes in the project area. \n \n11. \nThe  impact of  road  investments  on  poverty  reduction  was  confirmed  in  studies  that \nexamined the effectiveness of the government\u2019s various sectoral expenditures in contributing to \n\n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2003.

Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Corporatization, Leasing, and Securitization \n\nin the Road Sector. Manila. \n\n\f 4\n\ngrowth and poverty reduction.9 The studies concluded that a significant portion of rural poverty \nreduction  is  attributable  to  nonfarm  employment  and  wage  increases.  Road  investment  has  a \nsignificant impact on the creation of such opportunities in the rural economy. The importance of \nroads in improving  the  quality  of  life  is  highlighted  in  an  ADB-financed  study.10 A  regional TA \nreviewed  the  poverty  reduction  impact  of  infrastructure  projects.11  TA  3900  examined  the \nsocioeconomic impact of road investment in  the PRC.12 The findings of TA 3900 reconfirm the \ncontribution  of  road  investments  to  poverty  reduction  in  the  PRC  as  well  as  the  validity  of  the \ngeographic  focus  of the road portfolio  on the poorer  western  interior  provinces.13 The results \nalso confirm that complimentary investments in local roads strengthen the impact of expressway \ninvestments.  Well-integrated  road  investments  help  ensure  that  the  benefits  derived  from  the \nexpressway filter down to the poor. These results affirm the relevance of  ADB\u2019s strategy in the \nroad  sector.    An  ADB-financed  TA14  will  also  help  the  Government  prepare  a  road  network \nstrategy  that  promotes  expressway  and  local  roads  to  meet  communities\u2019 needs and support \neconomic growth, and to provide road agencies with cross-disciplinary skills and tools. \n  \n12. \nExternal  assistance  to  help  the  Government  develop  its  road  sector  strategy has been \ngiven,  mainly  by  ADB,  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC),  and  the  World \nBank. Since 1991, ADB has provided 27 loans, totaling $4.8 billion, to finance 3,500 km of road \ndevelopment, together with 5,800 km of associated local road networks. Since 1995, local roads \nhave been included in the scope of road projects to make ADB\u2019s interventions in the road sector \nmore  pro-poor. Of the  ADB-funded  projects,  12  have  been  completed  and  are  open  to  traffic. \nADB also has provided 45 TA packages, totaling $23.6 million, to the road sector. The advisory \nTAs  have  addressed  policy  and  institutional  issues,  including  highway  planning,  road  safety, \nhuman  resources  development,  transport  pricing,  and  the  mobilization  of  nongovernment \nfinancial resources. The World Bank and JBIC have provided about $6.1 billion and $990 million \nrespectively  to finance  road investments.  ADB  coordinates  with  the  World  Bank  and  JBIC to \nensure the complementarity of aid involvement in the transport sector (Appendix 3). \n \n\n3. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n \n13. \nThe  Hunan  Provincial  Communications  Department  (HCD)  has  experience  as  an \nexecuting agency (EA) in 4 externally financed road projects,15 including the Hunan Expressway \nProject  financed  by  ADB.  The  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  ADB-financed expressways, \nChangtan  and  Changyong,  was  awarded  a  concession  to  a  company  in  1998.   The lessons \nlearned  from  this  Project 16  suggest  that  while  this  experience  introduced  sound  business \npractices  to  the  Hunan\u2019s  expressway  sector,  the  concessionaire,  was  a  joint  venture  between \nthe government and the private sector and consequently the terms of concession were reached \nthrough  direct  negotiation  without  the  transparency  in  the  bidding.  Concession  with  private \ncompanies should be awarded through transparent competitive bidding. Other lessons include \n                                                 \n9  S.  Fan,  L.

International consulting inputs for the supervision of \ncivil works were strengthened in the Project. \n \nPerformance  reviews18 of completed  road  projects  concluded  that  all  loans  to  the road \n14. \nsector in the PRC have been or are being implemented satisfactorily. Of 7 completed projects, 6 \nprojects were generally successful and 1 was partly successful. The project performance audit \nreports  for  3  road  projects 19  concluded  that  the  projects  were  either  highly  successful  or \nsuccessful. The lessons learned from previous ADB-financed road projects are reflected in the \nproject design. To avoid delayed loan effectiveness due to delay in the procurement process, a \ntendering  company  was recruited  to  prequalify the civil works contractors. ADB\u2019s procurement \nguidelines and requirements, including the anticorruption provisions, were discussed extensively \nduring  appraisal. Emphasis was put on the need to (i) strictly follow ADB\u2019s mandatory bidding \ndocuments,  (ii)  evaluate  bids  according  to  ADB-approved  evaluation  criteria,  and  (iii) \nsubstantiate clearly the conclusions of the bid evaluation. The Government has made significant \nefforts  to  combat  corruption  in  the  road  sector.  To  date,  15  government  officials  from  10 \nprovinces  have  been  found  to  be  involved  corruption.  Information  related  to  these  corruption \ncases  is  in  the  public  domain.  There  is  no  evidence  that  any  of  the  reported  corruption  was \nrelated to ADB funded road projects. During project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was \nexplained to government officials. The section on fraud and corruption that was added to ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants is an efficient mechanism \nfor preventing unethical behavior. ADB\u2019s program for the PRC included assistance for improving \ngovernance and providing incentives to reduce the incidence of fraudulent practices. 20 \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nObjectives \n\n \nA. \n \n15. \nThe  principal  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  facilitate  efficient,  sustainable  economic \ngrowth and thus contribute to poverty reduction in  Hunan. The Project will (i) improve economic \nefficiency, foster trade, and facilitate interregional integration by alleviating congestion, reducing \nVOCs,  and  improving  traffic  safety;  (ii)  supply  a  missing  link  in  the  Changsha-Chongqing \nwestern  corridor;  (iii)  spread  economic  and  social  benefits  over  a  wider  cross-section of local \ncommunities  by  improving  accessibility  for  the  rural  poor  in  the  corridor;  and  (iv)  improve \npeople\u2019s incomes and well-being. \n\n                                                 \n17 During the implementation of the Xiheng expressway, the first World Bank project, handbook for road safety audits \nwas  developed.  During  the  implementation  of  the  Changlin  expressway,  the  second  World  Bank  project,  the \nhandbook\u2019s practical application was enhanced and is now used in all expressway projects in Hunan.  \n\n18 ADB. 2001.

Manila. \n\n\f 6\n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nB. \n \n16. \nThe Project comprises (i) the construction of a 173 km, four-lane access-controlled, toll \nexpressway  from  Changde  to  Huaihua,  including  tunnels  and  bridges,  interchanges  and  toll \nstations,  and  service  areas;  (ii) the  upgrading  or  improving  of  517  km  of  local  roads,  thereby \nproviding  improved  access  to  404  villages;  (iii)  the  procurement  of  equipment  for  road \nmaintenance and safety, toll collection, surveillance and communications, tunnel ventilation and \nlighting,  vehicle  axle  road  testing,  and  environmental  protection;  (iv)  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement; and (v) consulting services for construction supervision, safety audits, monitoring \nand evaluation, and capacity building. \n \nC. \n \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nPoverty Reduction Impacts\u2014the Local Road Component \n\n \nIn line with ADB\u2019s policy dialogue, a local road improvement program was integrated into \n17. \nthe Project to expand the road network in rural minority villages and to meet their needs.21 The \nintegrated approach will help spread the expressway benefits to the poor. Better tie-ins between \nthe  expressway and  local  roads  will  help  rural  agricultural  products  reach  markets  and  allow \nfarmers to  upgrade farming practices.  As  reliable  transport to markets becomes more readily \navailable, cash-crop farming in remote or isolated areas will be stimulated and the access to off-\nfarm employment opportunities will be broadened. A set of 9 priority local road sections in the \npoor area, totaling 517 km, was selected from Hunan\u2019s road development plan.  \n  \nOf  the  ADB  loan  of  $312.5  million,  $12.5  million  will  be  provided  for  the  local  road \n18. \ncomponent, which will finance one section from Zhangjiajie to  Yuanling.22 The total cost of the \nlocal road component is about $81.9 million, of which $12.5 million (15.3%) will be the foreign \nexchange  cost  and  $69.4  million  equivalent  (84.7%)  will  be  the  local  currency  cost.    Around \n627,000, or 49% of the 1.3 million rural beneficiaries, including the 287,000 poor beneficiaries of \nthe local road component,  have  an  annual per capita income  of  below CNY900.  The  nine  local \nroad segments will  (i)  be  implemented  concurrently  with  the  expressway  component, (ii)  use \nGovernment  designs and  standards  that  are  acceptable  to  the  ADB, (iii)  apply  ADB\u2019s social \nsafeguard  policies,  and (iv)  be  accorded  the  same  degree  of  attention  as  the  expressway  in \nimpact monitoring.  The  procurement for the  ADB-financed section  will  use  LCB, while  that for \nthe domestically financed sections will follow government procedures acceptable to ADB. About \n300  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  will  be  allocated  to  the  local  road \ncomponent  for  ensuring  proper  design  and  supervision,  project  monitoring  and  evaluation, \ntraining the engineering staff, and project management.  \n \n\n2. \n\nTransport Services in the Project Area \n\n \n19. \nThe extent to which the lower transport costs derived from a road investment project are \npassed  on  to  the  rural  poor  depends  on  their  access  to  reliable,  affordable  and  competitive \ntransport  services.  The  less  the  access,  the  less  benefits  they  will  receive  compared  to  other \nsocial groups, and thus the lower the poverty impact of  the Project. Transport services are well \ndeveloped  in  the  eastern  section  of  the  project  area  close  to  Changde,  but  less  so  in  the \nwestern  section(cid:190) mountainous  and  underdeveloped.  Few  bus  and  truck  operators  ply  the \n                                                 \n21 Since  1995, the scope of  the  ADB-financed  road  projects  has  been  expanded  to  strengthen  their impacts  on \n\npoverty reduction by adding local road improvements to improve the accessibility of poor communities. \n\n22 This 135-km section, of which 29 km is class IV and the rest is unclassified, will be upgraded to class II (11 km) \n\nand class 3 (124 km). The upgrading of this section is expected to spur the tourism in the project area. \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nroutes  to  the  poor  villages  due  to  bad  road  conditions  or  limited  road  access.  The  fares and \nroutes  of  the  formal  bus  system   are  regulated, which  may  result  in  inefficient  services.  Thus, \npeople in these areas rely more on informal transport services, such as bicycles and motorized \ntricycles. Despite the crucial role of informal transport services in rural transport, their supply is \nalso  insufficient.  As a result,  the  rural  poor  sell  their  produce  to  drive-in traders who  have the \nadvantage  of  a  buyer\u2019s  market.  Adequate  and  affordable  transport  services  provided  on  a \ncompetitive  basis  are  a  prerequisite  to  spreading  the  Project\u2019s  benefits  to  the  rural  poor, \nespecially those  who are  beyond  the  reach  of  road  transport  services.  Due  attention  will be \ngiven to such services during the Project\u2019s implementation so that the Project\u2019s benefits reach \nthe  rural  poor  in  the  project  area.  Under  the  ADB  loan,  an  international  consultant  will  be \nengaged to develop an action plan and associated measures, which would be incorporated into \nthe Project. She/he will examine the following measures: (i)  increasing the competition among \ntransport  service  providers,  (ii) deregulating  fare and route  controls to  raise  system  efficiency \nand enhance commercial viability, (iii) making more credit available for the purchase of transport \nvehicles, and (iv) integrating rural transport services into the local roads development (Appendix \n4).  \n \n\n3. \n\nOperation and Maintenance (OM) Concession to the Private Sector \n\n \n20. \nHunan  has  actively  diversified  highway  financing  and  encouraged  private  sector \nparticipation  in  expressways.  The  private  sector  is  involved  in  5  expressways  in  Hunan: \nChangtan,  Changyong,  Xiheng,  Changtan  West,  and  Changyi. 23  In  Changtan,  Changyong, \nXiheng,  and  Changyi,  the  private  sector  has  been  involved  in  OM  through  concession \nagreements.24 During the  Project\u2019s  initial  years  of  operation,  its  OM  will  be  entrusted  to  the \nChangji Expressway Construction and Development Company (CECC). 25 Then HCD will enter \ninto  an  OM  concession  after  a  few  years  of  opening.  To  this  end,  HCD  will  develop  the \nconcession  agreement  framework  during  the  implementation  of  the  Project.  In  particular,  due \nattention  will  be  given  to  enhance  transparency  in  the  bidding  process  for  the  concession, to \noptimize the gain of the concession to the  efficiency in expressway operation. HCD will prepare \na bidding document\u2014which specifies the concession period and selection criteria, and ensures \nadequate  pricing  and  transparent  bidding\u2014and  submit  it  to  ADB  for  review  by  the  midterm \nreview in 2006. Under the ADB loan, an international  consultant will be engaged  for 1 month to \nhelp  HCD  prepare  the  concession  agreement  and  bidding  document.  The  agreement  should \ninclude  incentives  and  penalties  to  ensure  expressway  maintenance  adheres  to  the  agreed \nstandards. HCD will assess a specific schedule of the concession\u2019s implementation and advise \nADB  about  it  by  the  midterm  review.  HCD  and  ADB  will  ensure  that  (i)  the  concession is \nadequately priced by awarding it through transparent bidding; and (ii) expressway maintenance \nwill meet the agreed standards (Appendix 5). \n \n\n4. \n\nRoad Safety \n\n \n21. \nRoad safety is a serious concern in Hunan and the PRC. The number of accidents in the \nproject area has increased substantially over the past few years.  The 2002 Road Safety Action \nPlan  prepared by the  Ministry  of  Public  Security  aims  to  reduce  accidents.  This  goal  will be \n\n                                                 \n23 They are Changsha-Xiangtan, Changsha-Yongan, Xiangtan-Hengyang, Changsha-Xiangtan West, and Changsha-\n\nYiyang. Changtan and Changyong were funded by ADB (Hunan I Expressway Project [footnote 15]).  \n\n24 The  OM  of  Changtan  was  awarded  as  a  30-year  concession  to  a  company  in  1998;  in  Changyong,  the \nconcessionaire  was  successfully  listed  in  the  A-share  section  of  the  Shenzen  Stock  Exchange  in  1998;  and in \nXiheng, funded by the World Bank, a 20-year concession was awarded in 2002.  See Appendix 5 for details. \n\n25 The CECC was established as a 100% state-owned company in July 2004 for the construction and operation of the \n\nproject expressway.  \n\n\f 8\n\nachieved  through driver training, targeted  traffic  enforcement,  and  better  traffic  management. \nThe Road Traffic Safety Law, effective from May 2004, is enforced nationwide. A  Road Safety \nCommittee has been established by Hunan Provincial Government (HPG) to investigate causes \nof road accidents and identify preventive measures. At least 6 months prior to the opening of the \nexpressway, HCD will (i) develop and implement a road safety action plan acceptable to HPG \nand  ADB\u2014with  the  help  of  an  international  consultant\u2014for  the  safe  operation  of  the \nexpressway;  and  (ii)  ensure,  in  collaboration  with  the  Hunan  Public  Security  Bureau  (HPSB), \nthat  a  team  of  HPSB  personnel  will  patrol  the  expressway  and  enforce  the  new  law  and \nregulations  in  accordance  with  national  and  provincial  standards.  The  Project\u2019s  major \ncontribution  to  road  safety  will  be  the  application  of  a  high  standard  to  the  expressway\u2019s \nconstruction  to  reduce  accidents  in  the  corridor.  HCD  will  (i)  use  its  traffic  control  and \nsurveillance  system  for  the  safety  of  the  expressway,  (ii)  make  all  facilities  of  the  system \navailable to the agencies concerned to strengthen traffic enforcement and emergency services \nin  the  corridor;  (iii)  promote  the  use  of  the  Road  Safety  Audit  Guidelines,  applied  to \nexpressways in Hunan, in local roads; and (iv) ensure the enforcement of road safety measures \nin the expressway and local roads. An international road safety specialist will be engaged for 2 \nmonth under the Project to assist HCD in developing the road safety action plan, and check all \ndesigns and safety aspects of the expressway during implementation (Appendix 6). \n \n\n5. \n\nVehicle Emissions \n\n \n22. \nThe  rapid  rise  in  the  number  of  private  vehicles  has  drawn  attention  the  problem  of \nvehicle  emissions.  Vehicle  emissions  will  have  an  adverse  impact  on  the  environment  if  no \nmitigation  measures  are  taken.  The  Government  has  taken  several  measures  to  control \nemissions,  through  regulation  on the  automobile  industry,  annual  vehicle  test, and inspection \nand  maintenance  program.  The  new  measures  also  set  emissions  and  fuel  efficiency  targets \nand offer tax incentives to encourage developing more environmentally friendly cars. Hunan has \nformal vehicle emission standards by which all types of vehicles regularly tested by the Hunan \nenvironmental  protection  bureau  (HEPB),  in  collaboration  with  the  traffic  police.  At  least  6 \nmonths  prior  to  the  opening  of  the  expressway,  HCD  will  (i)  provide  ADB  with  the  vehicle \nemission  regulation  limits  prepared  by  the  HEPB  and  the  penalties  for  violating  emission \nstandards; and (ii) provide ADB with the latest government plan to improve air quality in Hunan, \nincluding the cleaner fuel programs (e.g. ethanol and CNG), vehicle testing center facilities, and \nan  inspection  and  maintenance  program.  An international  vehicle  emissions  specialist will be \nemployed  to  develop  an  action  plan  to  control  vehicle  emissions  in  the  project  area,  with  the \nhelp  of  the  HCD  and  HEPB.  The  HCD,  in  close  collaboration  with  HEPB  and  other  agencies \nconcerned, will implement the vehicle emissions action plan accordingly (Appendix 6). \n \n\n6. \n\nResettlement Plan \n\n \nThe  Resettlement  Plan  (RP)  was  prepared  by  the  HCD  based  on  the  detailed \n23.  \nmeasurement  survey  (DMS),  56  village  surveys,  657  household  surveys,  local  government \nstatistics, and consultations with local officials, village leaders, and affected households. Unless \nproper mitigation measures are adopted,  some  37,000  people  could  be  adversely  affected by \nthe Project, which includes 6,414 people to be relocated. The total resettlement cost including \ncontingencies  is  estimated  at  CNY434.5  million  ($52.5  million).  A  resettlement  information \nbooklet, with sections on resettlement policy and impacts, compensation rates and entitlements, \norganizational  arrangements,  consultation  and  participation,  and  grievance  procedures,  was \ndistributed to the affected villages and publicized in the local media in November 2003. The RP, \nwhich has been discussed with county level offices, was submitted to ADB in January 2004 and \napproved  by  ADB  in  May  2004.  The  final  RP,  updated  based  on  the  DMS,  was  submitted to \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nADB in June 2004, posted on ADB\u2019s web site both in English and Chinese  in August 2004, and \nwill be distributed to affected county and township offices. For the local roads component, HCD \nis  the  responsible agency and the  implementing agencies  will be the county  communications \nbureaus.  There  will  be  some  resettlement  along the  local road  section  to  be  financed  by  the \nADB loan; other local roads will only require paving. A summary RP is in Appendix 7. \n \n\n7. \n\nStakeholder Participation and Consultations \n\n \nDuring  the  feasibility  study,  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA), and  resettlement \n24. \nplanning, consultations were conducted with government agencies, villagers, other people likely to \nbe affected by the Project, and local groups to discuss environmental concerns, land acquisition \nand resettlement issues, and economic development potential. Village investigations and surveys \nwere conducted in the  project  area  to  assess  the  potential  adverse  effects  and benefits of the \nProject.  Over  3,370  people  were  interviewed  in  public  opinion  surveys,  social  assessment, \nenvironmental assessment,  and resettlement planning. For the  RP, consultation meetings were \nheld with the affected  counties , townships, and villages. The Project was well known by the rural \npeople and public support for it was high. The local officials explained the policies and regulations \nfor land compensation and housing removal to those who would be adversely affected by the loss \nof  farmland  or  housing.  These  concerns  were  considered  in  (i)  determining  the alignment to \nreduce  adverse  social,  resettlement,  and  environmental  impacts;  (ii)  designing  connector roads \nand  pedestrian  access;  and  (iii)  completing  a  detailed  RP.  The  consultation  process  was \nexpanded  to  finalize  the  design  and  formulate  appropriate  compensation  standards  and \nrehabilitation  measures  for  people  displaced  by  land  acquisition  or  house  demolition.  Villagers \nparticipated in the discussions and decisions on village resettlement (Appendix 8). \n \nD. \n \n25. \nThe total cost of the Project is the  equivalent of $778.1 million, with a foreign exchange \ncost of  $314.2  million  (40%) and a local currency cost  amounting  to  the  equivalent  of  $463.9 \nmillion  (60%).  The  cost  of  the local road  component  is  $81.9  million.  Of the  ADB  loan,  $12.5 \nmillion is allocated for the local road component, with the remaining costs to be  funded by the \nprovincial  and  county  governments.  HCD  has  committed \nthe  appropriate \nimplementation of the local road component during the project period (Appendix 9). \n\nCost Estimates \n\nto  ensure \n\n \n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n \n\nLocal Currency \n\nTotal Cost \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nForeign Exchange \n\n1.

The Borrower of the Loan will be the PRC.  The loan will \ncarry a 25-year term, with a grace period of  5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% p.a., and other terms \nand  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project  Agreements.  The  Government  has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions;  and  (ii)  an undertaking that these choices \nwere independently made, not influenced by any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n27. \nOf  the  total  project  cost,  ADB  will  finance  40.2%;  the  Government,  13.7%,  on  a  grant \nbasis; and HPG, 5.1%, using its own funds. The remaining local currency cost of $319.2 million \nwill  be  domestically  raised  by  HPG.  The  ADB  loan  proceeds  will  be  made  available  to  the \nGovernment, which, in turn, will make them available to HPG, on the same financial terms and \nconditions  as  those  of  the  ADB  loan.  HPG  will  bear  the  interest  rate  fluctuation  and foreign \nexchange risks. HPG will onlend a portion of the loan proceeds\u2014$300 million\u2014to CECC on the \nsame  financial  terms  and  conditions  as  those  of  the  ADB  loan.  CECC  will  bear  the  interest \nfluctuation and foreign exchange risks. Hunan Province will keep the balance of $12.5 million and \nuse  it  for  the  local  road  component;  it  will  bear  the  interest  rate  variation  fluctuation  and foreign \nexchange risks. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \n\n  Source \n\nForeign Exchange \n\nLocal Currency \n\nTotal Cost \n\n \nAsian Development Bank \nMinistry of Communications  \nHunan Provincial Government \nDomestic loan  \n \n \n\nTotal \n\n \n312.5 \n0.0 \n1.7 \n0.0 \n314.2 \n \n\n \n0.0 \n106.4 \n38.3 \n319.2 \n463.9 \n \n\n \n312.5 \n106.4 \n40.0 \n319.2 \n778.1 \n \n\n          Source: Asian Development Bank estimates . \n \nF. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \n28. \nHCD will be the EA responsible for overall Project implementation and implementation of \nthe local road component of the Project. CECC will be the implementing agency, responsible for \ncoordinating  and  monitoring  all  construction  activities  of  the  expressway,  as  well  as  operating \nthe  expressway.  CECC\u2019s  general  manager, the  project  director,  will  be  responsible  for  overall \nproject  management  in  respect  to  the  expressway,  the  approval  of  contracts,  and  payments. \nHCD  will  implement  the  local  road  component  through  the  local communications bureaus.  A \nproject implementation unit established within CECC will facilitate land acquisition, resettlement, \nand  environmental  protection  measures,  and  ensure  that  local  concerns  are  adequately \naddressed. The unit is headed by a project manager, who will oversee physical implementation \nactivities  day-to-day  and  prepare  progress  reports.  Apart  from  its  central  office,  CECC  has \nseven toll stations and  four  maintenance  centers.  CECC  has  sufficient  technical  capability  to \nhandle  the  Project.  However,  its  institutional  capacity  needs  to  be  further  strengthened; \nassistance will be provided under the consulting services. \n\n\f \n\n11\n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n29. \nPreconstruction  activities\u2014detailed  design,  the  preparation  of  bidding  documents,  the \nprequalification  of  contractors,  and  the  tendering  and  awarding  of  contracts\u2014began  in  April \n2003. Preliminary design was completed in March 2003 and detailed design in December 2003. \nCompletion of the preconstruction activities is targeted for 31 October 2004. The construction of \nthe  expressway  is  scheduled  to  start  in  March  2005  and  the  Project  will  be  completed  by \nDecember 2009. The construction schedule is in Appendix 10. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n30. \nAll  ADB-financed procurements will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The main \ncivil works will be divided into 21 packages and the equipment, into 3 packages, all of which are \nto  be  procured  under  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures  (Appendix  11). \nAncillary  facilities,  including  the  administration  building  and  service  areas  building  under \ndomestic financing, will be procured using local competitive bidding (LCB). The procurement for \nthe local road  section  financed by  the  ADB  loan  will  use  LCB, while  the  procurement for the \nlocal roads under government financing will follow government procedures acceptable to ADB. \nThe  international  bidding  will  be  conducted  by  a  qualified  tendering  company  with  previous \nexperience in externally funded projects. Only prequalified contractors with adequate technical \nand financial capacities will be allowed to bid for several packages; they may be awarded more \nthan  one  contract  based  on  the  least-cost combination of contracts.  The relevant sections  of \nADB\u2019s anticorruption policy will be included in all documents and contracts related to the bidding \nand implementation of the Project. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nThe  Project  will  provide  49  person-months  of \n\n \n31. \ninternational  consultants  and \napproximately 5,184 person-months of domestic consultants. Thirty-six of the 49 person-months \nof international consultants will be for the supervision of the civil works; 1 person-month each for \npavement  design, tunnel  construction,  vehicle  emissions  and  environment,  the  operation  and \nmaintenance  concession,  and  transport  services;  2  person-months  each  for  road  safety, and \nsocioeconomic  and  poverty  impact  monitoring  and  evaluation;  and  4  person-months  for \nadditional  experts,  as  needed.  Of  the  total  of  5,184  person-months  of  domestic  consulting \nservices, 300 person-months will be allocated to the local road component. HCD will establish 6 \nresident  supervision  engineer  offices \nfor  construction  supervision,  environmental  and \nresettlement monitoring,  and  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation.  Overall project \nsupervision will fall under the responsibility of the  chief supervision engineer\u2019s office. The chief \nsupervision engineer (CSE) will be  assisted by 2 deputy CSEs, one of whom will be the team \nleader of the  international  consultants.  He  or  she  will  assist  the  CSE  in  project  and  contract \nmanagement  activities, and certify  the  contractor\u2019s progress payments and contract variations \nprior to their approval by the CSE. The international consultants will be financed by the ADB loan \nand will be recruited  based  on  the  quality- and cost-based selection method  in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  Domestic consultants will be funded by domestic \nfinancing and recruited in accordance with government procedures acceptable to ADB. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f 12\n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \nThe  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.26 \n32. \nSince most of the payments will be made for large contracts (above the equivalent of $100,000), \ndirect  payments,  reimbursements,  and  commitment  procedures  will  be  used  to  withdraw  loan \nfunds.  If  government  funds  are  used  first  for  eligible  expenditures,  ADB\u2019s  reimbursement \nprocedure  will  be  followed.  To  expedite  the  flow  of  funds,  the  statement  of  expenditures \nprocedure  may  be  used  for  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  for  any  individual  payment \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $100,000. \n \n\n6. \n\nAdvance Procurement Action \n\n \nThe Government requested for advance procurement action for civil works,27 which ADB \n33. \napproved  in  May  2004.  This  covers  the  prequalification  of  contractors,  tendering,  and  bid \nevaluation for civil works contract packages, but does not include the signing of contracts. The \nadvance  actions  are  being  undertaken  in  accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement \nand Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The Government and  HCD have been advised that \nthe approval of the advance action does not commit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n34. \nHCD  and  CECC  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  Project  related  financial \nstatements,  such  as  statements  of  source  and  application  of  funds,  income  statements, and \nbalance sheet. The income statements will start on the commencement of toll operations. CECC \nand  HCD  will  prepare  one  set  of  financial  statements  each  for the  expressway and local road \ncomponent  and  have  them  audited  annually.  The  audit  will  be  in  accordance  with  appropriate \nauditing  standards  consistently  applied  by  independent  external  auditors whose qualifications, \nexperience, and terms of reference are acceptable to ADB.  HCD and CECC will submit to ADB \nwithin  6  months  of  the  end  of  each  related  fiscal  year,  certified  copies  of  audited  project \naccounts  and  financial  statements  and  an  auditor\u2019s  report  for  the  Project,  all  in  English.  To \nensure that  internal  controls and checks on the  project construction costs and operations are \neffective, HCD will establish an internal audit unit and will maintain it during implementation and \noperation  of  the  Project.  The  unit,  composed  of  full-time  accountants,  will  undertake \nindependent  tests  on  day-to-day  transactions,  prior  to  reference  to  external  auditors.  HCD will \nmake  satisfactory  arrangements  for  reporting  implementation  progress  through  quarterly \nprogress reports. Within 3 months of completion, HCD will submit a project completion report to \nADB. \n \n\n8. \n\nAnticorruption \n\n \nDuring  project  processing,  the  mission  explained  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  to \n35. \nprovincial  and  local  government  officials,  highlighting  the  section  on  fraud  and  corruption  that \nwas  added  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  Procurement and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants. \nADB\u2019s  program  for  the  PRC  includes  assistance  that  will  improve  governance  and  provide \nincentives to reduce the incidence of corruption in the longer term. For the Project, the EA will \ntake  the  following  anticorruption  actions:  (i)  involving  full-time  officials  from  HCD\u2019s supervision \ndivision in bidding, construction, and operations; (ii) introducing  a dual-signing system, in which \n\n                                                 \n26 ADB. 2001. Loan Disbursement Handbook . Manila. \n27 This Project was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 11 February 2004. \n\n\f13\n\n \n\n \n9. \n\nthe civil-works contract winner also signs an anticorruption contract with the employer; and (iii) \nperiodic inspections on the contractor\u2019s activities related to fund withdrawals and settlements. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n36. \nThe HCD concurred with the proposed set of indicators for monitoring and evaluating the \nperformance  of  the  Project  in  relation  to  its  goals  and  objectives.  Based on the results of TA \n3900, a set of monitoring indicators for the socioeconomic and poverty reduction impacts was \nrefined,  in  close  consultation  with  HCD  and local government officials. The key indicators and \nassumptions  outlined  under  goal  and  purpose  in  the  project  framework  (Appendix  1)  will  form \nthe core of the data required for assessment. Prior to project implementation, HCD will establish \nthe  necessary  baseline  values  for  impact  indicators  and  update  them  during  project \nimplementation.  Where  relevant,  indicators  will  be  disaggregated  by  gender  and  ethnic  group. \nHCD  will  measure  the  indicators  for  project  evaluation  on  project  inception,  completion,  and \nannually for 3 years after completion. The level of effort for the project performance monitoring \nsystem (PPMS) tasks will include: 3 person-months of international expertise to design and set \nup  the  PPMS  and  train  domestic  consultants  on  monitoring  methodology;  and  24  person-\nmonths  of  domestic  expertise  for  database  management,  village-level  surveys,  analysis, and \nreporting\u2014for which HCD will recruit an independent local institute. To facilitate the assessment \nof the Project\u2019s socioeconomic impact, the  terms  of  reference to monitor and evaluate project \nimpacts  are  included  in  the  scope  of  consulting  services  to  be  provided  under  the  Project.  \nReports summarizing the key findings of monitoring at inception, completion, and  annually for 3 \nyears thereafter will be submitted to ADB. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n37. \nIn 2006, ADB and HCD will carry out a midterm review of the Project, focusing on policy, \ninstitutional, administrative, organizational, technical, environmental, social, economic, financial, \nand other relevant aspects that may have an impact on the performance of the Project and its \ncontinuing  viability.  The  review  will  examine  the  progress  in  implementing  sectoral  reforms, \npolicy development, resettlement, and compliance with assurances in the Loan Agreement. \n \n\nCapacity Building and Human Resources Development \n\n \n11. \n\n \n38. \nTo cope with increased expressway construction and management activities,  a Human \nResources Development Plan will be drawn up in time for the start of civil works. The plan will \ntake  into  account  the  EA\u2019s  need  for  capacity  building,  and  the  recruitment  and  training \nrequirements. One element of the plan, an international training program funded by the loan, will \ncover  expressway  operations;  accounting,  auditing,  and  reporting  of  financial  statements; \ncommercial  development  of  expressways  and  business  planning;  expressway  maintenance; \nroad safety;  project management; bridge and tunnel design; traffic engineering; and pavement \ndesign. HCD staff will undergo about 65 person-months of international training. Assisted by the \nconsultants, HCD will prepare the training programs, their location, and a list of candidates, for \nADB\u2019s concurrence. The output of the training will be disseminated through HCD and CECC. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n \nA. \n \n39. \nIn 2003, traffic volume on NR319 reached around 3,510 MTE per day between Changde \nand Huaihua. Traffic has been growing  at 7.3% p.a. The traffic on NR319  will reach 5,500 MTE \n\n\f 14\n\nin 2008, exceeding the road\u2019s capacity at several points. Traffic on the expressway is forecast to \ngrow  from  5,630  MTE  to  10,130  MTE  per  day  between  2008  and  2018,  a  6.1%  annual \nincrease.28 Thereafter,  traffic  growth  will  slow  to  5.1%  p.a.,  reaching  16,700  MTE  by  2028. \nBased on the economic forecast  in  the  project  area,  the  traffic  projections  consider (i)  traffic \ngrowth  for  the  past 10 years, (ii) a  probable  generation  of  traffic  due  to  expanded  economic \nactivities, (iii) the likelihood that  NR319 traffic will be diverted to the expressway once the latter \nis operational, and (iv) origin-destination survey results (Appendix 12).  \n \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the project expressway was estimated by \n40. \ncomparing the project case with a base case involving the continued use and maintenance of \nNR319. Without the Project, congestion will worsen, causing delays, increasing VOCs and more \naccident  and  deaths.  The  Project,  with  its  shorter  distance  and  travel  time,  safer  design,  and \nbetter running conditions, will reduce VOCs and accident risks along the corridor. The economic \ncosts  of the expressway  are:  (i)  the  capital  cost,  which  includes  physical  contingencies, land \nacquisition,  and  resettlement,  and  (ii)  the  costs  of  operating  and  maintaining  the  expressway, \nincluding  the  costs  of  replacing  depreciated  equipment.  The  economic  benefits  include  (i) \nsavings in VOC due to the shorter  distance and improved road conditions, (ii) time savings for \nroad users, (iii) savings in road accident costs, and (iv) benefits to generated traffic.29 Economic \ncosts  and  benefits  have  been  valued  at  2004  economic  prices.  The  benefits  identified  for  the \nlocal  road  component  include (i)  VOC  savings  to  current  and  future  traffic  on  the  improved \nroads, (ii) crop value-added benefits because of higher farm-gate prices and improved access, \nand (iii)  generated  benefits  from  tourism  development. However,  the  last  two  benefits  were \nexcluded in the EIRR calculation since it is hard to quantify them.   \n \nAt  18.6%  p.a.,  the  EIRR  for  the  Project  demonstrated  the  Project\u2019s  economic  viability \n41. \n(Appendix 13). The VOC savings from the expressway accounted for most of the benefits (66% \nof the total), followed by time savings at 14%. The other benefits were comparatively small. The \nbenefits  of  the  local  road  component,  while  extremely  important  to  the  villages  concerned, \nconstituted a minor percentage of the overall project benefits, reflecting the modest traffic levels \non  the  local  roads.  The  results  of  the  sensitivity  analysis  confirmed  the  robustness  of  the \nProject\u2019s  economic  viability.  Changes  in  the  key  variables\u2014construction costs, toll rates, and \nbenefits\u2014did not significantly affect its viability, and the EIRR remained above the threshold of \n12% p.a. The EIRR for the expressway was 17.7% and for the local road component, 20.1%. \n \nB. \n \nFinancial projections have been prepared for the expressway component in accordance \n42. \nwith ADB's  Guidelines  for the  Financial  Government  and Management of Investment Projects \nFinanced  by  the  ADB  to  assess  the  financial  viability  and  sustainability  of  the  expressway \n(Appendix  14).  The  projected  financial  statements  indicate  that  financial  revenues  will  be \nsufficient to cover operating and maintenance costs, income taxes, debt service and provide a \nreasonable rate of return. Based on the financial projections, a debt service coverage rate of 1.0 \nwill be achievable from the third year of full commercial operations. The financial evaluation of \nthe  expressway  was  undertaken  in  real  terms  using  constant  2004  prices.  The  project  cost \nestimates and financial projections in nominal terms were converted to real terms by adjusting \nfor the projected effects of foreign and domestic inflation and currency fluctuations. The financial \ninternal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  for  the  project  expressway,  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis,  is \n                                                 \n28 For the Changtan expressway (ADB funded Hunan I Expressway Project [footnote 15]), traffic growth was 12.2% \n\nFinancial Benefits \n\np.a. for the first 3 years of operation (1997\u20131999), compared with the 3.4% projected at appraisal. \n\n29 Environmental benefits will also come from reduced vehicle emissions and noise, but these have not been included \n\nin the analysis because of the lack of a suitable evaluation methodology. \n\n\f \n\n15\n\n7.6%. This compares favorably with the weighted average cost of capital, also computed on an \nafter  tax  basis,  of  4.4%. The  expressway  is  considered  both  financial  viable  and  sustainable. \nSensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  the  FIRR  is  robust  under  adverse  conditions  (Appendix  15). \nHunan  has  a  toll  policy  for  expressways  governed  by  the  Highway  Law.  The  following  criteria \nwere  used:  (i)  toll  levels  on  other  expressways,  (ii)  affordability,  (iii)  benefits  to  users  of  the \nexpressway and the alternative roads, (iv) historical and actual traffic flows, and (v) debt service. \nCECC, in consultation with ADB, will propose the toll rates for the expressway. HCD, the Hunan \nFinance  Department,  and  Hunan  Price  Bureau  will  evaluate  the  proposal  and  approve  the \napplicable toll rates. HCD will consult with ADB regarding the proposed initial toll rates 6 months \nbefore the opening of the expressway. HCD and CECC will review the toll annually and monitor \nactual traffic levels and financial performance. \n \nC. \n \n\nSocial and Poverty Reduction Impacts \n\n1. \n\nProject Beneficiaries \n\n \nThe  field surveys indicate that the  project  expressway  will  directly  benefit  road users, \n43. \nsuch as transport providers, bus and truck operators, passengers, traders, government officials, \nand the private sector in general.  Rural  households  in  the  project  area  are  also  a  beneficiary \ngroup.  Farmers,  particularly those  living in  the  area  of  the  local  road  program  and  near the \nexpressway  interchanges,  will  be  in  a  position  to  increase  their  agricultural  incomes  through \nbetter  access  to  markets,  more  competitive  product  and  input  prices,  and  cheaper  transport \ncosts .  They  will  also  have  better  access  to  social  services,  faster  information  flows,  and \nincreased interaction with the outside world. The poor in  Yuanling and Fenghuang counties will \nobtain significant benefits from increase tourism due to improved roads. \n\n \n2. \n\nSocial Impacts \n\n \nBetter  roads  help  to  improve  the  quality  of  life  due  to  better  access  to  social  services . \n44. \nMore qualified teachers and doctors are willing to work in  the rural  areas.  Improved roads cut \ntransport  costs  and  the  time  it  takes  to  go  to  seek  health  care  at  a  health  facility.  The  health \nimpact will be reflected in lower mortality and morbidity rates. Road improvements also increase \nthe mobility of people. The construction of the expressway will also increase the number of truck \nand bus drivers passing through communities, putting the residents at a higher risk of acquiring \nand  transmitting  sexually  transmitted  infections (STI)  and  HIV/AIDS.30 The  surveys  indicated \nthat  rural  poor  households  know  little  about  HIV/AIDS  prevention,  possibly  exacerbating  the \ndisease\u2019s spread  to  local  communities,  particularly  the  minority  groups.  Through  the  ethnic \nminorities  development  plan  (EMDP)  and  social  action  plan  (SAP), the  Project  will  support \nHIV/AIDS  awareness  and  prevention  programs.  Targeted  and  broadly  based  advocacy  and \nawareness programs will be carried out in the project area.31  \n \n45. \nThe minority population in the project area totaled  1.3 million  in 2002 (41% of the total \npopulation), of whom 96% were Tujia and Miao. Of the total minority people in the area, 60% \nwill benefit from the Project.  The  major  benefits  to  the  minorities  include  higher  income  from \nincreased  cash-crop  farming,  more  cash  income  sources  due  to  seasonal  migration  work, \nenhanced contract with urban centers, and better access to social services. Minorities comprise \n\n                                                 \n30 Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n31 HCD will ensure that contractors disseminate information on the risks of STIs and HIV/AIDS to their employees \nduring project implementation\u2014a requirement that will be included in the contract. Local public health offices will \ndisseminate  similar  information  to  ethnic  minorities,  transport  operators,  and  women  in  the  project  area,  in \naccordance with ongoing HIV/AIDS prevention efforts.  \n\n\f 16\n\nabout  38%  of  the people  affected  by  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  Adverse impacts on \nminorities are addressed in the RP.32 The EMDP was prepared based on RP, SAP, and ongoing \ngovernment policies and programs for minority groups. In accordance with PRC regulations and \nADB\u2019s  indigenous  peoples  policy  it  provides  special  mitigation  measures  for  the  minority \nhouseholds identified as poor and vulnerable. A summary of EMDP is in Appendix 16. \n \n46.  \nThe Project will enhance women\u2019s access to information and better contact opportunities \nwith towns (as bus passengers) and jobs (as traders or sellers in local markets). Female migrant \nworkers will benefit from the expressway since they often have to  travel to distant provinces to \nfind suitable work.  The  benefits  for  farmers  will  include  women,  as  it  is they  who  handle the \nmajority  of  farm  work.  Women  will  also  benefit  from  increased  marketing  opportunities  (most \nfruit and vegetable sellers in local markets are women) and from better access to education and \nhealth facilities. The Project will enhance women\u2019s participation in planning, project monitoring \nand  evaluation,  and  the  implementation  of  other  poverty  reduction  programs,  especially  in  the \nvillages  served  by  the  local  road  component.  Women  have  an  equal  opportunity  and  pay  in \nconstruction  and  operation  jobs  under  the  PRC  Labor  Law  and  will  receive  preferential \ntreatment in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development. \n \n\n3. \n\nImpacts on Poverty \n\n \nThe improved local roads linked to the major road network will facilitate the spread of the \n47. \nexpressway\u2019s benefits to the rural economy. By lowering transport costs and travel time along \nthe corridor, the Project will improve the availability of daily necessities in the local markets and \nvillages that are served by its interchanges, and the access to markets and income-generating \nopportunities. With the expressway, the journey time between Changde and Huaihua will be cut \nby  2-3 hours.  Improved  local  roads  will  stimulate  the  development  of  the  rural  economy  by \nspreading  the  benefits  of  the  expressway  into  these  areas.  Poor  farmers  will  get  better  profit \nmargins  because  the  lower  transport  costs  of  agricultural  inputs  and  outputs.  Migration  to  off \nfarm jobs, an important source of cash income for most rural households, will further increase \nas  the  expressway  improves  access  to  other  cities  and  provinces.  The  expressway will  allow \nmore tourists to visit the project area. The improved roads will help develop the tourism potential \nin  the  Golden  Tourism  Triangle  Area.  Increased  tourist  traffic  will  benefit  the  poor  residing  in \nYuanling  and  Fenghuang  counties.  Some  1.9  million  people,  around 42%  of  whom  are ethnic \nminorities, will directly benefit from the  Project. About 49% of the 1.3 million rural beneficiaries \nand 15% of 573,000 urban beneficiaries are poor (Appendix 17).33  \n \n\n4. \n\nResettlement Impacts \n\n \n48.  \nThe  project  expressway  will  directly  affect  22  townships,  97  villages,  and  465 \nlandowning groups in 3 districts or counties: Dingcheng District, Taoyuan County, and Yuanling \nCounty. In the 97 villages, minority nationalities account for 38% of the population. According to \nthe  DMS,  1,349  ha  of  land  will  be  acquired.  Of  which  38%  is  farmland,  composed of irrigated \nland (79%) and dryland (21%). The remaining portion permanently acquired land comprises of \nforestland,  housing  plots  and  bush  land.  About  290  ha  of  land  will  be  temporarily  used  during \nthe construction phase. According to the method described in the Administration Land Law, land \nacquisition  will  directly  affect  30,564  persons  who  will  totally  lose  their  land.  Along  with  land \nacquisition,  about  235,000  m2  of  houses  and  other  structures  will  be  demolished,  which  will \n                                                 \n32 Minority households affected by the alignment are more integrated and better off than minorities living in the poor \n\nmountainous areas. \n\n33 The urban poverty estimate was  based on the per capita monthly income of CNY 180 in municipalities  and CNY \n\n130 in counties . The PPTA study concluded that 15% of the urban population in the project area is poor. \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\naffect about  1,414  rural  households,34 5 primary schools, and  1  tree  nursery  in  the  Zhengjiayi \nForestry  Farm.  The  total  number  of  affected  people  is  estimated  at  37,000. 35 An  RP  was \nformulated  in  accordance  with  PRC  laws  and  local  regulations,  and  the  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  and \nIndigenous  People\u2019s  Policy.  The  resettlement  strategy, \ncompensation standards, entitlements, and rehabilitation plans were based on impact surveys \nand  consultations  with  local  officials  and affected households.  Considering that the  degree of \nthe impact on villages is modest and  most of the affected persons are not poor compared with \nthe average income in their community, the RP will be implemented smoothly. Land acquisition \nwill be completed in 2004 and compensation will be paid  prior to the displacement of people or \nloss of land. Compensation and other allowances will be used to invest in economic and social \ninfrastructure  so  that  farmers\u2019  livelihoods  and  living  standards  will  improve.  Economic \nrehabilitation plans have  been prepared for 10 seriously affected villages. Special attention will \nbe paid to the vulnerable groups to prevent their marginalization or impoverishment. \n \nD. \n \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  A  by  ADB.  The  EIA  report  was \n49. \nprepared by  HCD,  under the supervision of  HEPB,  and  approved  by  the  State  Environmental \nProtection  Administration  in  November  2003.  The  EIA  assessed  environmental  impacts of the \nselected  alignment  of  the  expressway  and  the  local  road  component,  and  prescribed \nenvironmental  protection  and  mitigation  measures  costing  $2.4  million. 36  The  proposed \nalignment  does  not  cross  or  impinge  on  any  protected  areas.  There  are  no  known  rare  or \nendangered species in the project area, and no old growth forest, with the exception of one tree \nnear Guanzhuang  village.  This  tree  is  believed  to  be  more  than  400  years  old,  and  has  been \ntagged as a protected item. The alignment was diverted away from this area, thereby increasing \nits  length  by  about  700  meters.  The  Project\u2019s  major  environmental  impacts  include  soil and \nwater  conservation,  erosion  control,  borrow and  disposal  site  management, and  revegetation. \nBorrow  and  spoil  disposal  sites  were  identified  at  10  km  intervals.  An  erosion  control  and \nprotection plan was prepared separately from the EIA, and approved by the Water Resources \nBureau. Environmental mitigating measures will be incorporated in the bidding documents and \nbills of quantities of the civil work contracts. \n \nE. \n \n50. \nSince  the  project  expressway  will  pass  through  hilly  and  mountainous  terrains,  tunnels \nand  deep  cut  works  will  be  carefully  evaluated  by  an  international  tunnel  expert  before \nconstruction  begins,  and  subsequently  monitored  to  avoid  implementation  problems.  The \nprequalification  of  contractors  will  focus  on  their  technical  and  financial  capacity  in  handling \ncomplex works. During the construction period, monitoring and contract management systems \nwill be set up with the assistance of the international consultants for the timely identification of \ntechnical issues and implementation of corrective measures. The expected continued economic \ngrowth  and  the  ensuing  traffic  increase  limit  the  risk  that  potential  economic  benefits  will  not \nmaterialize. Based on the actual traffic of the expressways in the project corridor, the estimated \n\nProject Risks \n\n                                                 \n34 Of the people affected, 12% are poor. \n35 The  final  alignment  and  staking  survey  was  done  in  close  consultation  with  local  officials,  village  leaders,  and \npeople  to  be  affected  so  as  to  minimize  the  loss  of  high  quality  land.  The  local  villagers  have  discussed  their \nrequirements for accessibility once the expressway is constructed. Local roads will be rerouted and underpasses or \noverpasses will be constructed to ensure the unhindered flow of local traffic. \n\n36 A summary EIA was circulated to the ADB Board on 30 March 2004, and placed on the ADB web site on 2 April \n2004. The Chinese version of the EIA was sent  to the Project\u2019s field offices as reference for the public and other \ninterested parties . \n\n\f 18\n\ninitial traffic is probable. The proposed toll level is consistent with the local economy and reflects \nthe  trend  in  tolls  for  PRC  expressways.  HCD  reviewed  the  tolls  for  each  expressway  to \nmaximize the traffic flow along the corridor. ADB\u2019s policy dialogue on private sector participation \nin expressways will promote the efficiency of the financial and operational management of the \nexpressway.  The  financial  covenants  will  encourage  CECC  to  exercise  improved  operating \nefficiency  and  better  financial  management  for  the  market-based  financial  costs.  Since  the \nProject will generate revenue in domestic currency, there is a  financial risk from fluctuations in \nthe exchange rate. However, sensitivity tests indicate that an adverse  change in the exchange \nrate will have only a  minimal  effect  on  the  FIRR.  A potential environmental risk is soil erosion \ndue to road construction, which  may worsen the natural soil erosion resulting from the removal \nof vegetation, soil disturbance, and the  exposure of the bare soil surface. A comprehensive soil \nerosion plan was developed and the associated incremental costs were included in the project \ncost.  The  Project  will  improve  mobility  of  people,  which  may  exacerbate  the  rapid  spread of \nHIV/AIDS  to  local  communities,  particularly  the  minorities.  Targeted  and  broadly  based \nadvocacy and awareness programs addressing the associated risks of HIV/AIDS will  be carried \nout in the project area. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  following  specific  assurances  have been \n\n \nA. \n \n51. \nincorporated in the legal documents.  \n \nCounterpart Financing.

At least 6 months prior to the opening of the expressway, HCD will  propose the \nappropriate toll rates for the expressway in accordance with the Highway Law (which requires \nthat toll rates be set at levels sufficient to fulfill the debt service obligations of the Project as well \nas maintain sound operation, management, and maintenance practices for the Project). For the \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nFinancial Ratios. HCD will ensure that CECC maintains a debt service coverage ratio of \n\nfirst 3 years of full commercial operation, HCD will review the toll structure and levels and report \nto ADB significant difficulties in meeting the principles established under the Highway Law.  \n \n56. \nnot less than 1.0 from the third year of full commercial operation.  \n \n57. \nOperation and Maintenance Concession. With the help of an international  consultant, \nthe  EA  will  prepare  the  bidding  document  and  the  concession  framework  by  2006,  which \nspecifies  the  concession  period  and  selection  criteria,  and  ensures  adequate  pricing  and \ntransparent  auctioning,  and  submit  it  to  ADB  for  review  by  2006.  HCD  will  assess  a  specific \nschedule of the concession\u2019s implementation by the midterm review and advise ADB about it.  \n \nNongovernment Financing.  Six  months  prior  to  the  start  of  the  project  expressway \n58. \noperation,  HCD  will  analyze  the  feasibility  of  attracting  nongovernment  investment  funds  for \nfuture  road  sector  investment,  including  private  sector  participation  in  the  operation  and \nmaintenance of the project expressway, and report its conclusions to ADB. \n \n59.   Change in Operations. In the event that HPG or CECC plan to make (i) any change in \nownership  of  the  Project  facilitates;  or  (ii)  make  any  sale,  transfer,  or  assignment  of  HPG's  or \nCECC's interest in the Project expressway; or (iii) lease out, or contract out, or otherwise modify \nCECC\u2019s  responsibilities  for  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  Project  expressway,  the \nGovernment, HPG and CECC shall, at least 6 months prior implementation of such plan, consult \nADB and obtain ADB's consent prior to implementation of such plan. \n \nFinancial Reporting. During the construction period and for the first 3 fiscal years of full \n60. \ncommercial  operation,  HCD  will  submit  to  ADB  annual  audited  accounts  and  financial \nstatements for the Project, including the accounts maintained by CECC for the Project. In each \ncase,  independent  and  qualified  auditors,  appointed  by  HCD,  will  review  such  statements, \nincluding the project account, income statement, funds statement, and balance sheet. HCD will \nsubmit to ADB certified copies of the audited project accounts and financial statements, and an \nauditor\u2019s report for the Project (all in English) on or before June 30. \n \nHuman Resources Development and Training.  Prior to the start of civil works for the \n61. \nProject  expressway,  CECC,  in  consultation  with  HCD,  shall  develop  and  implement  a  human \nresources  development  plan,  acceptable  to  ADB,  that  identifies  the  managerial,  staffing,  and \ninvestment  requirements  of  CECC  in  relation  to  the  Project  and  that  includes  an  international \ntraining component to address these needs.  For each following year, as an integral part of this \nhuman  resources  development  plan,  CECC  shall  prepare  an  annual  training  plan  including  (i) \nthe objectives of the training activities, (ii) number of the training participants, (iii) duration, (iv) \ncost  estimates,  and  (v)  the  program  of  workshops  to  be  given  to  CECC  employees  by  those \nwho  will  participate  in  the  international  training.

EA will coordinate with other agencies to implement the plan.  \n \n68.  Monitoring and Evaluation. HCD and CECC will monitor and evaluate project impacts \nthrough  a  PPMS  to  ensure  that  the  project  facilities  are  managed  effectively  and  the  benefits, \n\n\f \n\n21\n\nparticularly to the poor, are maximized.  HCD  and  CECC will collect  PPMS  data agreed with \nADB prior to implementation, at completion, and annually for 3 years thereafter. \n \n69. \nGender and Development. CECC will follow ADB\u2019s policy on gender and development \nduring project implementation and will take necessary steps to  encourage women living in the \nproject  area  to  participate  in  planning  and  implementing  the  Project,  including  advising  the \ncontractors on maximizing their employment of women in connection with the Project.  HCD will \nmonitor the Project\u2019s effects on women during project implementation. \n \n70. \nHealth Risks. HCD and CECC, in coordination with  the appropriate agencies identified \nby the Government, will cause the contractors to disseminate information on the risks of socially \nand  sexually  transmitted  diseases,  including  HIV/AIDS,  to  their  employees  during  project \nimplementation. HCD will cause the appropriate agencies to disseminate similar information to \ntransport  operators  and  to  local  communities  living  in  the  project  area  during  project \nimplementation and operation of the project facilities. \n \n71.  Women and Child  Labor.  CECC  will  ensure  that  all  civil  works  contractors  engaged \nunder the Project (i) provide timely payment of wages and safe working conditions to all workers \nincluding  male  and  female  workers  (to  be  included  in  civil  works  contract  and  monitored  by \nconstruction supervision consultant);

Of  this,  1.4  million  km  were \nclassified\u2014class 2 and above roads accounted for 271,600 km, 15% of the total length. Density \nincreased from 12.1 km per 100 square km (km 2) in 1995 to 18.9 km per 100 km2 in 2003. In 2003, \nHunan\u2019s road network accounted for 4.8% of the country\u2019s total, with a length of 85,233 km. Of \nthis total, 45,544 km (53.4%) were classified: 1,218 km of expressways (1.4%), 468 km of class \nI roads (0.5%), 5,173 km of class II roads (6.1%), and 32,830 km of class III-IV roads (38.5%). \nUnclassified roads amounted to 46,376 km (54.7%).  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nIn 2003,  the  PRC vehicle fleet totaled  24 million trucks, cars, and buses.  The privately \nowned  fleet  of  motor  vehicles  increased  above  20  times  during  1985\u20132003,  from  0.3  million \nvehicles to  12  million.  Despite  the  rapid  increase  in  total  vehicles,  there  are  only  about  1.3 \nvehicles  for  100  persons,  which  is  low  relative  to  other  Asian  countries.  In  2003,  about  1.0 \nmillion  vehicles  were  registered  in  Hunan,  of  which  45%  are  passenger  vehicles.  Road \npassenger  traffic  in  Hunan  in  passenger-km  of  travel  grew  at  6.9% per annum  (p.a.)  between \n1990 and 2003, slower than the 9.3% rate for the PRC as a whole. Road freight traffic, in ton-\nkm,  grew  at  8.1%  annually,  compared  with  5.7% for the country.  Privately  owned  vehicles  in \nHunan totaled 0.36 million vehicles, of which 53% are passenger cars. The Government issued \nnew rules, which will have impacts on PRC\u2019s car industry: by tightening the opening of new car \nfactories,  setting  a  minimum  investment  for  new  vehicle  factories,  and  loosening  decade-old \nrestrictions  on  foreign  carmakers.  Currently,  the  PRC  has  more  than  100  manufacturers,  but \nmost  operate  on  a  scale  too  small  to  compete  with  world-class  automakers.  Cars  are also \namong  the  sectors  where  the  Government  tries  to  squeeze  soaring  investment  to  help  ease \ninflation. The new rules also set emissions and fuel efficiency targets and offer tax incentives to \nencourage producing more environmentally friendly cars. \n \nC. \n \n3. \nHunan  Provincial  Communications  Department  (HCD)  is  responsible  for  regulating  the \nroad  transport  industry  in  Hunan  by  licensing  drivers,  vehicles,  and  intercity  bus  services. \nFreight transport is essentially deregulated; however  interprovincial bus routes require  Ministry \nof Communications\u2019 (MOC) approval. Through tariff reform in trucking,  private operations have \nincreased  resulting  in  improved  transport  efficiency  and  quality  of  services  from  increased \ncompetition. Road administration is decentralized.  Road  transport  tariffs  are  allowed  within  a \nrange of plus or minus 20% of advisory tariffs set by provincial and lower administrations on the \nadvice of their communications departments and bureaus. This flexibility, coupled with ease of \nmarket entry, will help ensure that cost reductions resulting from improved road conditions are \npassed on to passengers. \n \nD. \n \n4. \nExpenditures  in  highway  infrastructure  are  financed  from  dedicated  user  charges, \nGovernment grants, domestic bank loans and bonds, and foreign loans and investments. Two \ndedicated  user  charges,  the  road  maintenance  fee  and  vehicle  purchase  fee,  have  provided \nmuch  of  the  financing  for  the  road  sector.  During  the  9th  Five-Year-Plan  (FYP),  the  road \nmaintenance  and  vehicle  purchase  fee  provided  53%  and  13%  respectively  of  the  total road \n\nRoad Sector Revenues and Expenditures \n\nRoad Administration \n\n\f26\n\nAppendix 2 \n\nRoad Engineering, Construction, and Maintenance  \n\ninvestments. Government grants provided 2% mainly to construct or improve rural roads in poor \nareas.  The  remaining  was  financed  from  domestic  loans  and  bonds   (9%),  other  domestic \ninvestments  including  financing  from  local  governments  and  state-owned  enterprises  (12%), \nforeign loans (8%), and foreign direct investment (3%). In Hunan, investment in highways during \nthe  9FYP was  CNY30  billion,  of  which  78%  was  for  expressways  and  high-grade highways. \nInvestment in 2002 was CNY11 billion, an annual increase of 12%. Proposed road  investment \nfor the 10FYP  is CNY65 billion, of which 71% is for expressways and high-grade highways. The \nfunding for rural roads is supplemented by poverty reduction funds. HCD expects debt funding \nto increase significantly; 55% of the total expenditure during the 10FYP will be new debt. \n \nE. \n \nRoad  projects  are  designed  by  the  planning  and  design  institutes  at  the  provincial, \n5. \nprefecture, and county levels. MOC reviews the designs of expressways, high standard roads, \nand associated structures. The institutes are staffed with experienced, well-qualified personnel. \nThe  city  and  county  highway  bureaus  have  their  own  construction  units  to  carry  out  minor \nprojects within their administrative districts. Competitive bidding practices were mandated by the \n1999  Tendering  and  Bidding  Law.  Many  of  the  largest  provincial  and  urban  construction  units \nare being reorganized into financially independent companies and have been awarded contracts \nindividually or as partners in joint ventures on several ADB- and World Bank-financed in-country \nor  overseas  projects.  Road maintenance is well organized by the expressway companies and \nthe highway administration bureaus and is carried out mainly through labor-intensive operations \nbut  with  increasing  amounts  of  mechanized  works.  MOC  has  established  an  advanced  road \nmaintenance  management  system,  consisting  of  a  road  data  bank  and  a  pavement \nmanagement  system,  which  is  being  introduced  in  stages  to  all  provinces  and  autonomous \nregions, and will become the key tool for programming future maintenance needs and budgets. \n \nF.  Government\u2019s Rural Road Development Program \n \n6. \nMOC is drafting a national rural road development plan. Under this plan, rural roads will \nbe developed in  three  stages.  By  2005,  total  mileage  of  rural  roads  will  be  1.6 million km; by \n2010,  1.85  million  km,  connecting  100%  of  townships  and  administrative  villages  in  the  PRC; \nand by 2020, 2.5 million km and transport services will be provided at the village level. \n \nG. \n \nADB  has  been  undertaking  policy  dialogue  on  the  PRC  road  sector  since  1991.  The \n7. \nprincipal  issues  addressed  include  the  poverty  impact  of  road  projects,  highway  design \nstandards  and  construction  quality,  road  safety,  vehicle  emissions,  pricing  policies, \ncommercialization and corporatization, and nongovernment financial resources. The status and \nachievements to date are summarized in the following Road Sector Policy Reform Plan. \n \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\nTable A2: Road Sector Policy Reform Plan \n\n \nInitiative \n\n1.

The  eastern section  of  the  project  area  is  close to Changde  where  the  economy  is \nprosperous and  transport services  are  adequate  in  both  quality  and  extent.  In  the  middle and \nwestern  section,  including  Huaihua  Prefecture,  however,  transport  services  are  limited.  The \nrural population in the area lives in remote, isolated natural villages, of which only two thirds are \nserved by roads (cid:190) most are of poor quality. The mountainous terrain  in the area makes it difficult \nto develop a good road network; many administrative villages have only one road linking them to a \ntown. An inefficient transport system can serve as a significant constraint on agricultural efforts \nin rural areas, both by raising the cost and effectiveness of inputs to production and by delaying \nthe sale of harvested crops.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nIn the central and western part of the project area,  trucks and buses provide services to \nvillages,  but  the  cost  of  travel  is  high.  The  people  in  the  area  mostly  rely on informal transport \nservices including bicycles and motorized tricycles to  travel to a town. A survey  found that the \naverage trip for the poor was longer than that for the non-poor because villages are far away from \ncommercial centers. Such trips are costly for the poor and hence infrequent.1 As a result, the poor \nwho are often limited to walking to nearby rotating village markets can sell their produce up to \nthe amount that they can carry on their backs, or sell it to four-wheel drive-in traders who benefit \nthrough a buyer\u2019s market situation. Likewise, the poor are  comparatively limited in traveling to \nbuy  farming  inputs.  On  the  other  hand,  higher  income  households  trade  at  larger  markets  in \ntowns because they have access to affordable transport services.  \n \nWhere there is no road access, all personal trips are made on foot (or at least start on \n3. \nfoot).  In those villages with road access, a  variety of modes is used for journeys.  Walking and \nbicycles  are  the  dominant  modes  for  short  journeys,  but  as  the  journey  length  increases,  the \nnumber of motorized trips increases. Most walking trips are of less than 6 kilometers (km). Even \non  short  journeys,  motorized  transport,  such  as  motorized  tricycles,  is  often  used.  The total \nnumber  of  trips  per  household  is  low.  With  each  household  making  1  trip  every  3  days,  trips \nwithin the township constitute the vast majority of all trips. The traffic volume in a village is quite \nlow. The average volume of grain marketed in a village is below 80 tons per year (equivalent to \nless than one small truck load per week), with similarly small volumes of fertilizer being brought \nin.  Only  small  volumes  of  passenger  traffic  are  generated.  The  survey  found  that  the  rural \npopulation is most concerned with availability and quality of local roads. The absence of roads \nor  very  poor  quality  roads  limits  access  to  markets  and  social  infrastructure,  health,  and \neducation.  For  instance,  one  village  reported  difficulty  crossing  a  major  river  that  separates \nthem from important social services, such as hospitals.   \n \n4. \nBuses. Two-thirds of the villages in the rural remote area are connected to a bus route. \nMost roads in  the  rural  villages  are  unclassified  and in  poor  condition.  Bus  operators  do not \nnormally  operate  on  unclassified  roads, or  they  operate  with  smaller  buses  and  fares  20% \nhigher  than  those  charged  on  classified  roads.  Bus  fares  depend  on  the  road  class,  road \nconditions,  daily  frequency  of  bus  services, and bus size. For  a  small  bus  (15\u201320  seats), the \nofficial  fare  is  CNY0.18  per  km.  Fares  can  vary  in  the  range  of  plus  or  minus  20%.  Long-\n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002.  Technical  Assistance  for  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Hunan  Roads  Development  II  Project. \n\nManila.  \n\n\f32\n\nAppendix 4 \n\ndistance  services  are  run  by  companies,  while  intracounty  services  are  normally  run  by \nindividuals.  Normally  several  operators  provide  services  on  each  route,  but  the  extent  of \ncompetition  on  fares  or  on  service  is  limited.    The  Hunan  Provincial  Communications \nDepartment (HCD) controls the number of operators on each route, to prevent over-supply. The \nnumber of trips per day carried out by each operator is also  controlled, either through operator \nassociations, or directly by state-owned bus terminal companies, which control the bus schedule \nand  allocate  slots  to  operators.  The  interviews  with  operators  carried  out  during  the  survey \nfound  that  these  restrictive  operating  practices  result  in  low  vehicle  utilization  and,  as  a \nconsequence, unnecessarily high operating costs.  \n \n5. \nTrucks.  Any  commercial  trucking  operation  requires  a  license.  The  number  of  large \ntrucks has decreased slightly, while small trucks have increased substantially. Operators must \nmeet  basic  requirements  for  financial  resources  and  maintenance.  Once  licensed,  the  trucks \ncan operate anywhere in  the country. In practice, rates are negotiated between the shipper and \nthe trucker and are normally lower than the Government guidelines. Current freight rates in the \nproject area are CNY0.5 per ton-km.  Most trucks are run by small, private operators, although \nsome  large  state  and  private  companies  exist.  The  state  companies  are  being  privatized, and \nthe  market  appears  to  be  competitive.  The  restrictions  on  the  granting  of  licenses  are  not \nunreasonable, and trucking capacity is adequate, possibly in excess. \n \n6. \nSmall trucks:  Agricultural  Use  Vehicles. The agricultural use vehicle is a registration \ncategory,  rather  than  a  vehicle  type.  They  are  normally  small  trucks,  based  on  agricultural \ntractors,  with  a  registered  capacity  of  between  500  kilograms  and  1  ton,  although  in  practice \nloads of up to twice as much can be carried in these vehicles. In addition, normal trucks, with a \nnominal  capacity  of  less  than  2  tons  can  also  be  registered  for  agricultural  use.  The  tractor-\nbased vehicles are common in country towns and villages. \n \n7. \nOther Informal Transport Means. Mini-taxis (7-seat buses) are run by a large numbers \nof  operators,  many  of  whom  appear  to  be  unlicensed.  They  are  based  in  towns  and  provide \nservices into the rural areas.  The vehicles are normally owned by the drivers.  They operate a \nfixed  route,  pick  up  and  drop  off  passengers  on  demand,  and  are  prepared  to  negotiate \nvariations on the routes. Fares are normally on a per-trip basis and established by custom, but \ncan be negotiated. \n \n8. \n Motor-tricycles  provide  short  distance  passenger  services  in  both  urban  areas  and \nvillages.  They  are  also  used  to  carry  small  volumes  of  freight,  in  addition  to,  or  instead  of, \npassengers. The negotiable fares are on a per-trip basis. Rates for freight are about CNY0.50 \nper ton-km. However, for short journeys and small volumes, rates are set by custom on a trip-\nby-trip  basis.  Drivers  operate  the  motor-tricycles  without  licences.  The  large  urban  areas  are \ngradually prohibiting motor-tricycles services. \n \nTwin-cab pickups are used to carry both passengers and freight. The back of a pickup is \n9. \nenclosed and benches are provided for passengers. The benches can be removed when freight \nis carried. \n \n10. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nAgricultural tractors equipped with pulling carts carry cargo on occasion. \n\n\f Appendix 4 \n\n33\n\n \n\n \n\nC. \n \n\nAssessment of Transport Services \n\n1. \n\nAdequacy of Transport Services \n\n \n11. \nThe study survey found that informal transport services, for both passenger and freight, \nrespond to demand in a flexible way. Service provision increases on market days for those who \nbuy  or  sell  at  local  markets.  Informal  transport  services  play  a  crucial  role  in  meeting  the \ntransport  demand  for  rural  residents,  thereby  improving  their  mobility.  However,  informal \ntransport supply in rural villages is not sufficient to meet the transport demand. The provision of \ninformal transport services should be increased through an increase in vehicle ownership. There \nare  also  safety  driver  licensing  issues  that  need  to  be  addressed.  The formal bus system is \nregulated on fares, but there is flexibility on route planning, with the initiative for new routes lying \nwith the operators.  Although  the  number  of  routes  operated  in  the  last  5  years  has  increased \nsubstantially,  about  one  third  of  villages  in  the  rural  area  still  do  not  have  a  bus  route.  Most \nroads in those rural villages are unclassified or are in poor condition. The survey results indicate \nthat  road  accessibility  is  crucial  for  bus  operators  to  provide  services.  The market for  trucking \nservices is active and fares are  market determined. Where larger volumes of cargo have to  be \nmoved, traders are able and willing to pick up produce and bring in inputs. \n \n\n2. \n\nConstraints of Accessing Transport Services \n\n   \nThe rural poor, especially in the rural, mountainous areas, often have difficulty accessing \n12. \ntransport services. Regulated transport services often lead to inefficient service, routing, and/or \npricing in rural areas. Provision of transport services in the project area, especially the central \nand  western  part,  is  insufficient.  This  is  mainly  due  to  lack  of  competition  in  the  transport \nservices market, regulations, or government interference. Private operators lack access to credit \nto  purchase  vehicles,  especially  for  means  of  informal  transport.  Inadequate  roads  make  the \nprovision of transport services to the rural poor difficult. In most rural villages, the poor quality of \nroad access was identified as a major problem in accessing transport services . \n \n\n3. \n\nInterventions to Enhance Provision of Transport Services  \n\n13. \nThe  extent  to  which  the  rural  poor  benefit  from  a  road  investment  project  depends  on \ntheir access to reliable and affordable transport services. The less the access, the less benefits \nthey will receive compared with other social groups, and the lower will be the poverty impact of \nthe  Project.  Due  attention  will be  given  to  such  services  during  project  implementation. The \nProject includes an action plan to enhance the provision of transport services.  Under the loan, \nan international consultant will be engaged  for 1 month to develop an action plan and promote \nspecific  measures  that  will  be  incorporated  into  the  Project.  The  consultant,  in  close \ncoordination with the Executing  Agency, will also recommend ways to implement the plan. The \nreport will be submitted to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  for  review  by  2006.    She/he  look  will \nexamine  the  following  measures: (i)  increasing  competition  among  transport  service  providers,2 \n(ii)  deregulating  fare  and  route  controls  to  raise  system  efficiency,  (iii)  making  more  credit \navailable for the purchase of transport vehicles,3 and (iv) integrating rural transport services into \nlocal roads development.  \n \n\n                                                 \n2  To  construct  competitive  environment  in  rural  trans port,  the  following  regulatory  reforms  may  be  considered: (i) \nregulatory responsibility should be separated from operational responsibility; and (ii) any subsidy should be in the \nform  of  service  contracts  between  government  authorities  and  operators,  and  it  should  be  open  to  competitive \nprocess. \n\n3  New credit schemes  should be established, link to existing credit lines , or work with existing credit institutions to \n\nbroaden their scope of credit services to support private ownership of informal transport means . \n\n\f34\n\nAppendix 5 \n\nOPERATION AND MAINTENANCE CONCESSION TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR \n\nOperation and Maintenance Concession \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nAn  operation  and  maintenance  (OM)  concession  is  an  agreement  between  a \ngovernment  or  a  state  enterprise  and  a  private  enterprise  whereby  a  private  enterprise:  (i) \ncollects  tolls  from  users,  to  finance  the  maintenance  and  reward  the  concessionaire;  (ii) \nmaintains the road to agreed standards; and (iii) pays an agreement amount to the government. \nAny surplus  will  accrue  to  the  concessionaire  as  profit.  The  bidder who commits the highest \ncanon (or the lowest negative canon, meaning the lowest government support) under a certain \ntoll level will be selected as a concessionaire. The OM concession (i) overcomes public sector \nbudget constraints by securing toll revenues as a maintenance fund without requiring funds to \nflow through the budgeting process; and (ii) increases efficiency in service provision by bringing \nin  an  experienced  private  sector  concessionaire  who  can  operate  and  maintain  the  project \nexpressway, at a lower cost than the government.  \n \n2. \nUnder  an  OM  concession,  the  concessionaire  assumes  the  traffic  and  ultimately  the \nrevenue  risk.  As  such,  the  OM  concession  is  differentiated  from  a  maintenance  management \ncontract whereby the private sector maintains an existing road under performance specifications, \nfor  which  it  receives  fixed  management  fees  from  the  government.  It  is  also  different  from  a \nbuild-operate-transfer  (BOT)  scheme  where  the  private  sector  finances  designs,  builds, \noperates,  and  maintains  the  expressway,  under  which  significant  project  risks  including \nconstruction  and  finance  risk  are  transferred  to  the  private  sector.  The  OM  concession  is the \npromising  alternative  modality  for  private  sector  participation  in  the  road  sector  as  it  leads \npublic-private  sector  partnering  in  a  feasible  way  by  more  equally  allocating  project  risks \nbetween the government and the private sector. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nCompared  with  other  provinces,  Hunan  has  actively  diversified  highway  financing  and \nencouraged  private  sector  participation  in  expressways. The private sector  is  involved  in  five \nexpressways  in  Hunan:  Changtan,  Changyong,  Xiheng,  Changtan  West,  and  Changyi. 1 \nChangtan  and  Changyong  were  funded  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  under  the \nHunan Expressway Project.2 Except for Changtan West, which was implemented using a BOT \nscheme,  in  the  other  four  expressways the private sector  has been  involved  in  operation  and \nmaintenance through concession agreements. For the Changtan expressway, the 30-year OM \nconcession was awarded to  the Modern Investment Company in 1998; the traffic risk is borne \nby  the  company.  For  Changyong,  the  concessionaire,  the  Modern  Investment  Company,  was \nsuccessfully listed in the A-share section of the Shenzen Stock Exchange in 1998. For Xiheng, \nfunded  by  the  World  Bank,  the  20-year  OM  concession  was  awarded  in  2002  to  the  Modern \nInvestment Company.  For  Changyi,  a  joint  venture  between the  Government  (51%)  and  the \nHong Kong Road King  Company (49%) was established for construction and operation (Table \n\nOperation and Maintenance Concession in Hunan Expressways \n\n                                                 \n1  The  sections  are  Changsha-Xiangtan,  Changsha-Yongan,  Xiangtan-Hengyang,  Changsha-Xiangtan  West, and \n\nChangsha-Yiyang, respectively. \n\n2  ADB. 1993.

To  this  end,  HCD  will \ndevelop  the  concession  agreement  framework  during  the  implementation  of  the  Project.  In \nparticular,  due  attention  will  be  given  to  enhance  transparency  in  the  bidding process for the \nconcession, to  optimize  the  gain  of  the  concession  to  the  efficiency in expressway  operation. \nHCD  will  prepare  a  bidding  document\u2014which specifies  the  concession  period  and  selection \ncriteria, and ensures adequate pricing and transparent bidding\u2014and submit it to ADB for review \nby the midterm review in 2006. Under the ADB loan, an international consultant will be engaged \nfor  1  month  to  help  HCD  prepare  the  concession  agreement  and  bidding  document.  The \nconcession agreement  will  set  out  the  rights  and  responsibilities  of  the  concessionaire  and \ngovernment  during  the  concession  period,  to  maintain  the  project  expressway  to  agreed \nstandards, and to collect tolls from users. A draft concession agreement  will be included in the \nbidding  documents  to  ensure  that  all  bidders  have  equal  opportunities.    HCD  will  assess  a \nspecific schedule of the  concession\u2019s implementation and advise ADB  about it by the midterm \nreview.

Other laws and regulations are \nalso  essential  to  address  traffic  management  by  the  concessionaire,  policing  the  road, \nadvertising  control  on  the  road,  arrangement  for  emergency  vehicles,  etc.  Estimates of  traffic \nvolumes  are  crucial  in  determining  the  toll  road  viability.  However,  any traffic forecast may be \nuncertain because of the complexity of interaction between economic development, the toll rate, \nand  traffic.  This  high  uncertainty  for  traffic  sometimes  discourages  the  private  sector  from \nbidding for concessions. Increasingly, agreement exists that when traffic is particularly uncertain, \nthe traffic risk should be shared by the government and the private sector. The government can \nprovide  a  downside  guarantee  for  a  certain  minimum  level  of  traffic,  with  a  complementary \nscheme put together for sharing super-profits if traffic is higher than expected. Most concession \nagreements should include a toll escalation formula that is related to the consumer price index \nand allows for toll increases either every year or every few years. However, the  concessionaire \nis  sometimes  not  permitted  to  increase  the  toll  as  specified  in  the  agreement  because  of \nadministrative intervention  or contract frustration. In this case, a clause should be added in the \nagreement  to  prescribe  compensation  arrangements  that  can  be  acted  upon  when  the  toll \nincrease is denied. \n \n\n2. \n\nMonitoring of Maintenance Performance  \n\n \n7. \nThe  concessionaire  is  responsible  for  maintaining  the  road  at  performance  standards \nagreed  in  the  concession  contract.  These  standards  should  be  defined  to  minimize  the  long-\nterm  cost  of  preserving  the  road  as  well  as  the  cost  to  the  road  user.  Performance-based \nconcessions  must  have  appropriate  monitoring  procedures,  combined  with  penalties  for \nnoncompliance.  Concession  contracts  should  include  well-defined  monitoring  procedures. \nInspectors  may  be  hired  to  inspect  the  road  and  make  regular  random  checks  to  verify \ncompliance. A well-documented inventory of the road and daily records of activities undertaken \nby the concessionaire will help understand the specific behavior of the roads and contribute to \nbetter preventive maintenance. To strengthen the monitoring and compliance, road users may \nalso be encouraged to report road deficiencies to the road agency.  \n \n\n3. \n\nBidding Process \n\n \n8. \nThe  guiding  principle  for  bidding  processes  should  be  to  maximize  competition, \ntransparency, and clarity in the process so that the ultimate road users pay a competitive  toll. \nThe major aspects that should be considered for ensuring competitive and transparent bidding \nprocesses are \n \n\ndetailed development of the concession should be set out clearly in the bidding \ndocuments, specifying the responsibilities of the concessionaire and government; \na  draft  concession  agreement  should  be  prepared  by  the  government  and \ninclude  it  in  the  bidding  documents  to  ensure  that  all  bidders  make  similar \nassumptions; and  \nthe decision criteria should be clearly set out in the bidding documents. The most \ntransparent approach is to select a single criterion, perhaps the highest level of \ncanon (or the lowest level of government support) for a given toll. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n37\n\nROAD SAFETY AND VEHICLE EMISSIONS \n\nRoad Design Standards \n\n \nA. \n \nThe Project expressway has been designed and will be constructed in accordance with \n1. \nMinistry of Communications\u2019 standards. This will provide a facility of a high standard in keeping \nwith international practice and will ensure a good degree of safety and operational efficiency. 1 \nThe  geometric  design  of  the  expressway  has  been  selected  to  ensure  that  speed  limits  are \nchosen to suit the geometric design rather than the design speed. Signs, markings, interchange \nstructure,  and  crash  barriers  will  be  selected  carefully  prior  to  the  expressway  opening.  All \ninterchanges  of  the  new  expressway  are  of  the  trumpet  layout  to  minimize  land  acquisition. \nThey  have  low  loop  radii  (50  meters  [m]  to  60  m)  and  low  design  speeds  (35  kilometers \n[km]/hour [hr]). The minimum taper plus deceleration lengths used in the design are 150 m for \nthe 100 km/hr sections and 130 m for the 80 km/hr sections. Current accident statistics show a \nsignificant  number  of  tail-end  collisions  at  the  exit  tapers.  It  was  recommended  to  review  the \ndeceleration lengths to take account of the main line to loop design speed change prior to the \ncommencing civil works. Guardrails will be installed when the consequences of a vehicle impact \nwith the barrier are likely to be less severe than an impact with the feature being shielded. For \nthe new expressway, the median width is 2.0 m and continuous guardrail is proposed on both \nsides of the median.  \n \n2. \nTo maximize benefit from the expressway project, the Hunan Provincial Communications \nDepartment (HCD) will undertake all necessary measures to impound and prohibit overloaded \nvehicles  from  entering  the  expressway  until  the  load  is  reduced  to  the  legal  requirements. \nMaintenance  works  can  have  a  serious  effect  on  traffic  flow  and  safety,  especially  as  traffic \nvolumes  increase.  Adequate  advanced  warnings  of  maintenance  interruptions  to  normal \nexpressway  traffic  will  be  given  to  the  road  users  to  minimize  inconvenience  and  delays.  The \nexpressway  has  15  tunnels.  HCD  will  implement  a  pavement  management  system  on  the \nexpressway  and  local  roads  and  develop  a  complete  maintenance  management  system  to \nprovide  realistic  maintenance  budgeting,  expenditure  control,  performance  standards,  and \nevaluation. Regarding the safety of tunnels, HCD has developed an emergency plan according \nto a safety audit.  As part of the final design, HCD will prepare a risk management plan to cover \nareas of safety concern during construction, especially construction of bridges and tunnels. \n \nB. \n \nAccident  rates  in  the  PRC  are  high  compared  with  many  other  developing  countries. \n3. \nRoad accidents and their resultant economic losses represent a substantial problem and require \nurgent  attention.  The  2002  accident  statistics  for  the  PRC  were  773,137  accidents,  109,381 \nfatalities, and 562,074 injuries. This equates to one death every 5 minutes, the highest such rate \nin  the  world.  The  economic  cost  to  the  country  is  significant;  between  1\u20133%  of  its  gross \ndomestic product. Hunan had 28,056 accidents, 3,658 fatalities, and 27,468 injuries in 2002. To \naddress this issue, the Ministry of Public Security prepared the 2002 Road Safety Action Plan, \nwhich aims to (i) reduce serious accidents, involving more than 10 fatalities, by 10% compared \nwith  2001;  and  (ii)  eliminate  major  accidents,  involving  30  or  more  fatalities.  This  will  be \nachieved  by  improved  vehicle  safety,  driver  training,  and  improved  traffic  management.  In \nHunan,  the  Traffic  Police,  under  the  Hunan  Public  Security  Bureau  (HPSB),  is  responsible  for \ninvestigating  accidents  and  identifying  preventive  measures.  The  Traffic  Police  also  makes \n\nRoad Accidents And Traffic Enforcement \n\n                                                 \n1  The design speed of the expressway varies along the route with 62 km having a design speed of 100 km/hr and \n\nthe remaining 111 km having a design speed of 80 km/hr. \n\n \n\n\f38\n\nAppendix 6 \n\nOrganization and Action Plan \n\nsubstantial efforts to identify accident blackspots, to establish the causes and so to avoid similar \naccidents  in  the  future.  This  work  is  coordinated  with  HCD  when  the  causes  are  road  related \nrather  than  driver  or  vehicle  related.    The  Hunan  Safety  Audit  for  Highway  Design  was \ndeveloped during the implementation of a World Bank funded project and has been  used for all \nexpressways since 2000. Although the guidelines are comprehensive, it needs to strengthen the \nend  of  construction  and  pre-opening  to  traffic  practice.  Such  audits  should  also  involve  the \nTraffic Police since this group will have the traffic safety responsibility after opening to traffic and \nmay  well  spot  different  safety  issues  from  their  practical  experience  of  operating  on  the \nexpressways.  Such  guidelines  need  to  be  more  practical  rather  than  theoretical  and  the  audit \nstaff  should  be  experienced  accident or  safety  personnel  or  have  been  involved  in  accident \ninvestigation.  The  international  consultant  will  review  the  guidelines  during  the  implementation \nof the Project expressway. \n \nC. \n \n4. \nThe  organizations  responsible  for  road  safety  and  enforcement  on  the  expressways  in \nHunan  are  the  HPSB  and  HCD.  The  Road  Safety  Committee  of  HPSB  currently  implements \naccident  management  in  Hunan,  which  is  responsible  for  enforcement  of  traffic,  accident \nrecords, accident analysis, and identification of blackspots. An interdepartmental framework will \nbe  established  under  the  Project  to  enhance  road  safety  in  the  project  area.  While  HCD  will \nconcentrate  on  the  engineering,  road  safety  audit,  and  blackspot  improvement,  HPSB  will \nundertake traffic law enforcement for safer expressways. A qualified team will be set to manage \ntraffic operations for the expressway. The local traffic police will be responsible for road safety of \nthe  local  roads.  HPSB  will  assign  a  senior  officer  to  coordinate  the smooth implementation of \nthe  Project.  HCD  will  help  develop  a  comprehensive  road  safety  strategy  in  the  project  area, \nwith the help of an international road safety specialist. The strategy aims to improve road safety \nthrough:  (i)  institutional  strengthening,  (ii)  capacity  building,  and  (iii)  enhanced  coordination \namong various agencies.  \n \nD. \n \n5. \nMotor  vehicle  emissions  are  a  growing  contributor  to  air  pollution.  The  Government  is \ntaking significant measures to control emissions by regulating the automobile industry, enforcing \nan annual vehicle test and inspection and maintenance program. The new measures also set \nemissions and fuel efficiency targets and offer tax incentives to encourage development of more \nenvironment  friendly  cars.  In  the  new  rule,  it  targeted  that  average  fuel  consumption  will  be \nreduced  15%  points  from  2003  to  2010.  Hunan  is  developing  alternative  fuels  that  could  help \nreduce  petroleum  imports.  A  300,000  ton  per  year  ethanol  plant  has  been  proposed  in \nChangde; it would use corn  and  other  grains  as  feedstock.  The  Sichuan-Hunan gas pipeline \nproject  is  currently  under  construction.  Natural  gas  will  be  provided  for  power  generation, \nindustrial fuel, commercial and residential users, and transport. HCD and Hunan Environmental \nProtection  Bureau  (HEPB)  will  proceed  with  the  planning  for  a  vehicle  emissions  control \nimplementation plan. Implementing such a program will require the cooperative of a number of \nagencies,  jurisdictions,  and  the  community,  as  well  as  Government  commitment.  An \nimplementation plan will be developed to promote efficient vehicle emission reduction measures \nin the project area. An integrated approach may be adopted to facilitate the implementation of \nthe  action  plan.  A  vehicle  emissions  specialist  will  be  engaged  to  develop  a  comprehensive \nvehicle  emissions  action  plan,  including  enforcement  management,  prevention  measures, \nsocioeconomic costs, and major issues for the emission control programs.  \n\nVehicle Emissions \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n39\n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN  \n\nThe Resettlement Plan \n\nPolicy Framework and Compensation \n\n \n1. \nThe  173-kilometer  (km)  project  expressway  and  3  interconnector  roads  (12  km)  will \naffect 22 townships and 97 villages in 3 district or counties: Dingcheng, Taoyuan, and Yuanling. \nBased on the detailed measurement  survey (DMS), the Project will permanently occupy about \n1,349 hectares (ha) of land,  including 509 ha (38%) of cultivated land. About 30,564 people will \nlose  some  land.  The  temporary  use  of  land  during  construction  will  amount  to  290  ha. The \nnumber of rural people whose houses will be demolished is 4,807 people (1,414 households), \nwith a total floor space of  225,139 square meters (m2). Some 1,607 persons in 5 schools and a \nforestry farm also require relocation. Land acquisition and resettlement impacts were minimized \nthrough consultations with local officials, aligning the expressway away from densely populated \nareas, and avoiding irrigated land and facilities. \n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe  Resettlement  Plan  (RP)  was  prepared  by  the  Hunan  Provincial  Communications \nDepartment (HCD). The RP includes the project expressway, interconnector roads, and 517 km \nof  existing  local  roads.  The  RP is based on the  project  preliminary  study,  and  Hunan Design \nInstitute  detailed  design  survey  data  on  impacts.  The  socioeconomic  survey  covered  657 \nhouseholds  from  72  villages,  and 56  interviews of  village  representatives.  The  draft  RP  was \nreviewed  by  the  affected  people  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  HCD  incorporated \ncomments into the RP. The RP and cost implications were finalized based on the DMS. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe  resettlement  objective  is  to  ensure  attainment  of  equal  or  better  livelihoods  and \nliving  standards  for  people  affected  by  the  Project  in  line  with  the  Land  Administration  Law \n(1998)  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  and  the  ADB\u2019s  policies  on  involuntary \nresettlement (1995) and indigenous people (1998). The RP is also based on the Implementation \nMeasures  for  the  Land  Administration  Law  of  the  PRC  in  Hunan  Province  (2000)  and  the   \nHunan Provincial Government\u2019s Management Measures on Temporary Land Occupation. HCD \nwill ensure that any people losing land, housing, other assets, or other means of production will \nbe  assisted  in  restoring  their  incomes  and  living  standards  to  at  least  the  levels  without  the \nProject\u2019s intervention. Lost assets will be replaced or compensated at replacement cost. The RP \nalso  stipulates  eligibility  and  entitlement  provisions  for  affected  people  and  provides \nrehabilitation  subsidies.  Permanent  land  losses  are  compensated  either  through  land \nreallocation within the villagers\u2019 group or through cash payments to the collective at rates of 8 \ntimes  the  average  annual  output  value.  Temporary  land  losses  will  be  directly  paid  to  the \nindividual  at  a  rate  stipulated  in  the  RP.  House  losses  will  be  paid  directly  in  cash  at \nreplacement  cost,  free  of  demolition  expenses  and  salvaged  materials.  Crops  and tree  losses \nwill be directly paid in cash at rates. Each resettled household will also receive an allowance to \ncover transport costs, work loss, transfer costs, medical expenses, and temporary housing. \n \nC. \n \n4. \nThe three options for residential resettlement site selection are (i) new housing sites will \nbe selected in the same village or land owning group for villages where only several households \nwill be relocated (light impact); (ii) a site suitable for  clustered buildings will be selected if more \nhouseholds are involved in relocation, but enough land is available for their livelihood (moderate \nimpact);  and  (iii)  relocation  to  towns  with  the  permission  from  the  township government  for \nhouseholds that are engaged in nonfarm business. Along the Changji expressway, no structure \nloss is expected for enterprises. Five schools and one forestry farm will be affected, and general \n\nRelocation Site Development and Rehabilitation Assistance \n\n\f40\n\nAppendix 7 \n\nImplementation Arrangements and Budget \n\nStakeholder Participation, Disclosure of Resettlement Plan, and Grievances \n\nrelocation  plans  have  been  prepared.  Since  project  impacts  are  spread  over  many  village \ngroups,  the  degree  of  income  loss  is  not  serious.  Most  affected  people  prefer  cash \ncompensation  for  their  land  loss.  Village  groups  will  decide  based  on  villagers\u2019  preference. \nConsequently, no village income rehabilitation plans are needed. But, initial rehabilitation plans \nhave been discussed for the 10 most seriously affected villages, and further consultation will be \nconducted on compensation disbursements. Relevant training will also be arranged for farmers \nwishing to expand their skills. Special assistance for vulnerable groups will be provided by the \nProject to secure their livelihood. \n \nD. \n \n5. \nAt various stages of the project planning,  the people affected by the Project have been \ninformed  and  consulted  about  the  likely  project  impacts.  Stakeholders  consulted  include  (i) \nheads  of  households  to  be  affected, (ii)  village  heads  and  villagers\u2019  representatives, (iii) local \ngovernment  agencies  and  departments,  and  (iv)  women  and  other  vulnerable  groups. \nConsultations  will  continue  through  the  project  implementation  period.  HCD  prepared the RP, \nwhich was discussed with local government and stakeholders for review and comments.  HCD \nalso  organized  consultations  in  each  affected  district  or  county.  Consultations  revealed  full \nsupport  for  the  Project. Some concerns raised  during  consultations  have  been addressed by \nadjusting the  road design and  by  improving  compensation and resettlement policy measures \nand entitlements. Resettlement information booklets have been distributed and discussed with \naffected villages and households.  A working organization for resettlement consisting of officials \nfrom the Land Administration Bureau and related department will implement the RP.

It  will  connect  Changde  and  Huaihua  cities  and  Xiangxi  Autonomous \nPrefecture  in  the  west  of  Hunan  with  Changsha,  Hubei,  Chongqing  Municipality,  and  Sichuan \nand  Guizhou  provinces.  Traffic  surveys  were  carried  out  by  the  Hunan  Provincial  Design \nInstitute. Sixteen-hour origin-destination surveys and associated 24-hour classified traffic counts \nwere done at 15 key locations along the existing NR319 and linking roads. Trucks make up 62% \nof all vehicles on NR319, and cars and buses only 38%. The nonmodeled traffic accounted for \n10% of total traffic.  Over 80% of the vehicles make long distance trips of over 200km, and 16% \nhave both origin and destination within this area. \n \n2. \nBy  2008,  the  traffic  on  NR319  will  exceed  the  optimal  capacity  at  several  points, \nparticularly near Changde and on the class III and IV sections. By 2018, traffic on NR319 will be \nwell  over  capacity  along  its  whole  route.  With  the  expressway,  some  additional  traffic  will  be \ngenerated as a result of (i) additional trips made by existing users due to cheaper and quicker \njourneys; and (ii) trips made by others who, in the absence of the Project, were deterred from \nmaking them because of the prohibitive cost or time. Based on the feasibility study,  additional \ntourism traffic is  estimated at 1,263 medium-truck equivalent per day in 2008, rising to 2,475 in \n2028. Other generated traffic occurs due to reduced prices. Price elasticities were minus 0.4 for \npassengers  and  minus  0.3  for  freight.  Estimates were made on the present  traffic  volume on \nNR319, and the traffic volume likely to be either generated or diverted from NR319 as a result of \nthe  expressway.  Based  on  the  economic  growth  forecast  in  the  project  area,  the  traffic \nprojections  consider  (i) the  traffic growth  for  the  past 10 years, (ii)  the  probable  generation of \ntraffic due to enhanced economic activities resulting from the expressway, (iii) the likelihood that \ntraffic  will be diverted from NR319  once  the  expressway  is  opened, and (iv)  origin-destination \nsurvey results. Traffic along the corridor increased at 7.3% per annum over the last 5 years. The \nfactor  used  to  forecast  traffic  was  income  elasticity  of  traffic  demand.  Gross  domestic  product \ngrowth rates were projected at 8.4%, 7.1%, 6.5%, and 5.6% each for 2000\u201305, 2005\u201310, 2010\u2013\n20, and 2020\u201325. The demand elasticity was 1.05 for passengers and 0.85 for freight. \n \n\nTable A12: Forecast Traffic Flows  \n(medium-truck equivalent) \n \n\n \nSection \n\n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \nAverage \n\n \n\n \n\n \nBase Case \n\n2008\n2028\n2018\n6,984 13,858 25,353\n5,415 10,745 19,658\n5,415 10,745 19,658\n5,415 10,745 19,658\n5,415 10,745 19,658\n5,546 11,004 20,132\n4,314\n8,561 15,663\n5,501 10,915 19,969\n\nExpressway \n\n2008\n2028\n2018\n6,613 11,719 19,419\n9,618 15,819\n5,442\n5,560\n9,829 16,174\n5,684 10,051 16,547\n9,995 16,456\n5,652\n9,952 16,387\n5,627\n4,799\n9,745 16,173\n5,625 10,130 16,711\n6.1% 5.1%\n\nWith the Expressway \nNR 319 and Others \n\nTotal \n\n2008\n3,291\n2,623\n2,231\n2,109\n2,140\n2,325\n2,167\n2,412\n\n2018\n2028\n6,711 12,841\n5,387 10,416\n8,853\n4,575\n8,437\n4,337\n8,538\n4,397\n9,327\n4,874\n8,445\n4,418\n4,846\n9,337\n7.2% 6.7%\n\n2008\n2028\n2018\n9,904 18,430 32,260\n8,065 15,005 26,235\n7,791 14,405 25,027\n7,793 14,388 24,984\n7,792 14,392 24,994\n7,952 14,825 25,714\n6,966 14,163 24,618\n8,037 14,976 26,048\n6.4% 5.7%\n\nGrowth rate (%)  7.3% 7.1% 6.2%   \n\n \n\n1 = Changde-Taoyuan; 2 = Taoyuan-Zhengjiayi; 3 = Zhengjiayi-Cha'angpu; 4 = Cha'angpu-Guanzhuang;  \n5 = Guanzhuang-Yuanling; 6 = Yuanling-Shanjiaoping; 7 = Shanjiaoping-Louxi, NR = national road, MTE = medium -truck \nequivalent. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n\f48\n\nAppendix 13 \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\nExpressway Component \n\n \n1. \nThe  Project  comprises  the  expressway  that  traverses  the  northwestern  part of  Hunan \nand the local roads connected to the expressway through the road network system. The Project \nwill be implemented over 5 years. The economic analysis covers the following 20 years of full \noperation. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the project expressway was estimated \nby comparing the project case with a base case involving the continued use and maintenance of \nthe existing road, NR319. Without the Project, congestion levels would increase, causing delays \nand increasing vehicle operating cost (VOC); accident rates would also rise. The Project, with its \nshorter  distance  and  travel  time,  safer  design,  and  better  running  conditions,  will reduce VOC \nand accident risks along the corridor. \n \nA. \n \n2. \nEconomic evaluation was undertaken using 2004 prices. The project costs and benefits \nwere  revalued  at  economic  prices  by  separating  the  cost  items  into  tradable  materials  and \nequipment, nontradable materials, labor, and land. The prices were expressed in yuan using the \ndomestic  price  numeraire  with  a  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  of  1.01  for  foreign  exchange \neffects. A shadow price was used to put an economic value on the wages paid to unskilled labor, \nbut not on wages for skilled labor since no skilled worker surplus existed. A shadow wage rate \nfactor of 0.67 was used to convert  the  financial  wage  rate  to  an  economic  opportunity  cost  of \nlabor. The costs of the expressway include (i) the capital cost, including physical contingencies, \nland  acquisition,  and  resettlement;  and  (ii)  the  costs  of  operating  and  maintaining  the \nexpressway, including the costs of replacing depreciated equipment. In estimating the economic \ncosts of land, the approach described in  The Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects \nwas followed.1 \n \n3. \nThe  economic  benefits  include  (i)  VOC  savings  resulting  from  the  reduced  travel \ndistance and improved road conditions, (ii) savings in the value of passenger time and of freight \ntied  up  in  transit,  (iii)  savings  resulting  from  fewer  accidents,  and  (iv)  benefits  to  generated \ntraffic.2 A reduction of VOC is the main source of economic benefits in new or improved roads. \nThe  expressway  shortens  the route between  Changde and the border  between Yuanling and \nLouxi  by  about  45  kilometers  (km).  Traffic  diverting  to  the  expressway  would  enjoy  higher \nspeeds on a smoother road, with better vertical and horizontal alignment, less congestion, and a \nshorter  journey  distance.  Traffic  remaining  on  the  alternative  NR319  route  would  also  benefit \nfrom a reduction in traffic volume and congestion. All these changes affect vehicle speeds and \nVOC, which were estimated for all vehicle types likely to use the corridor. Savings in travel time \nwill occur both on the project expressway and the existing roads. User time savings were valued \nat the wage rate for crew and 30% of the hourly wage rate for passengers.3 The value of time-\nfor-work or business trips is assumed to be related more to urban incomes for cars and average \nregional  incomes  for  buses.4 The  economic  cost  per  fatality  was  established  using  2001  data \n\n                                                 \n1  The economic opportunity costs of land are assumed to be equivalent to the replacement value of farmland, which \nwas  calculated  for  land  compensation.  Since  these  are  rural  areas,  it  was  assumed  that  there  is  no  additional \nopportunity cost for land.  \n\n2  Environmental benefits will also come from reduced vehicle emissions and noise, but these have not been included \n\nin the analysis for lack of a suitable evaluation methodology.  \n\n3  This is based on an assumed annual income of CNY14,000 for car passengers and CNY5,000 for bus passengers . \nFor  people  traveling  in  leisure  time,  the  preferred  method  of  valuation  is  willingness-to-pay  for  time  saved. \nHowever, in the absence of local information on willingness-to-pay, this study bases the values on annual income. \n4  This resulted in an economic opportunity cost of  CNY0.70 per hour for car passengers and CNY0.25 per hour for \n\nbus passengers. \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n49\n\nLocal Road Component \n\nwith  estimates  of  the  involvement  of  vehicle  occupants  and  pedestrians  at  different  levels  of \nincome in fatalities on different classes of road.5 \n \n4. \nThe  EIRR  for  the  expressway  component  is  estimated  at  17.7%,  indicating  that  the \nProject is economically viable, with a net present value of CNY3.6 billion. Of the total benefits, \n73.3% comprise VOC savings; 14.6%, savings in user time costs; 3.8%, accident cost savings; \n7.9%,  benefits  from  generated  traffic;  and  0.5%,  savings  in  freight  inventory  costs  in  transit. \nSensitivity  analyses  confirm  the  robustness  of  its  economic  viability\u2014changes  in  the  key \nvariables  of  construction  costs,  toll  rates,  and  benefits  do  not  significantly  affect  the  economic \nviability. \n \nB. \n \nThe  principal  benefits  of  the  local  road  improvements  have  been  identified  as  (i)  VOC \n5. \nsavings  to  existing  traffic  and  normal  growth  of  future  traffic  on  the  improved  roads,  (ii)  crop \nvalue-added  benefits  because  of  higher  farm-gate  prices  and  improved  access,  and  (iii) \ngenerated  benefits  from  tourism  development.  Transport  cost  savings  will  accrue  to  normal \ntraffic  on  the improved roads through  VOC.  Currently  farm-gate prices for fruits are low  since \nonly  traders  with  tractors  or  small  trucks  can  visit  the  villages  to  purchase  produce.  Improved \nlocal roads  would allow  farmers  to  go  to  markets  to  sell  their  produce  at  higher prices, thus \nbenefiting the serviced communities with resulting farm-gate price increase. A local road section \nfrom  Yuanling  to  Zhangjiajie,  which  will  connect  the  Zhangjiajie  area  with  Yuanling,  thereby \nspurring tourism in the project area, will benefit the rural people by increasing work opportunities \nsuch as catering services to tourists. Despite significant benefits of increased crop values and \ntourism  development,  these  were  not  included  in  the  EIRR  calculation  and  only  VOC  savings \nwere estimated.  The  nine  local  roads  have  a  combined  EIRR  of  20.1% per annum with a net \npresent value of CNY472 million.  \n \nC. \n \n6. \nBased on the combined economic cash flows over the period 2004 to 2027, the Project, \nas  a  whole,  comprising  the  174  km  expressway  and  the  517  km  of  local  road  improvement \nprojects, generates an EIRR of  18.6%. This  is relatively high,  mainly because of the Project\u2019s \nlow construction costs and  increased levels of traffic volume due to better road conditions. The \nVOC  savings from the expressway  tops the  list of  benefits, accounting for  66%,  followed  by \npassenger time savings at 14%.  Accident cost savings, savings to generated traffic, and other \nbenefits  are  all  comparatively  small.  The  benefits  of  the  local  road  component,  while critically \nimportant to the villages concerned, also  account  for  10%  of  the  total  benefits  (Table  A13.1). \nThe results of the sensitivity analysis confirm the robustness of the Project\u2019s economic viability: \nchanges  in  the  key  variables\u2014construction costs,  toll  rates,  and  benefits\u2014do not significantly \naffect its viability, and the EIRR remains above the 12% threshold (Table  A13.2). The level of \ntoll also affects the EIRR: the higher the toll, the less attractive is the expressway to users of the \nparallel road NR319 and hence the lower is the EIRR. The economic viability of the Project was \nfurther confirmed by a statistical distribution of the EIRR. With the uncertainties, the statistical \ndistribution of the EIRR concluded that (i) the expected EIRR for the whole Project is 18.6%, (ii) \nthe chance of an internal rate of return exceeding 12% is 98%, and (iii) the chance of an internal \nrate of return greater than 20% is 2%. \n\nThe Whole Project \n\n                                                 \n5  On the basis of the findings of a study on accidents carried out by Highway Planning and Design Institute of the   \nMinistry of  Communications in 1993,  savings  for  reduced  accidents were  calculated  using  the national  data for \n2001. The average direct cost of an accident was estimated at: CNY25,980 on expressways, CNY30,700 on class \nII roads, CNY29,390 on class III roads, and CNY26,230 on class IV roads. \n\n\fTable A13.1: Economic Internal Rate of Return of the Project \n(constant 2004 economic prices, domestic price numeraire, CNY million) \n\n50\n\nAppendix 13 \n\nWithout \nProject \nCosts \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n25 \n32 \n34 \n36 \n37 \n39 \n41 \n43 \n45 \n47 \n49 \n50 \n50 \n51 \n51 \n52 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n54 \n\nCosts \n\nWith Project Costs \n\nCapital  O&M \n\nLocal \nRoads \n0 \n117 \n117 \n220 \n9 \n6 \n7 \n7 \n7 \n7 \n7 \n7 \n7 \n7 \n7 \n7 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n(295) \n\n811 \n1,583 \n2,161 \n1,421 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n\n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n44 \n44 \n44 \n44 \n44 \n43 \n43 \n43 \n43 \n43 \n54  200 \n42 \n42 \n42 \n42 \n42 \n41 \n41 \n41 \n41 \n\n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n4,313 \n\n \n\nYear \n\n2005 \n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \n2027 \n2028 \n \n \n \n\nIncremental \nCost \n\nVOC \nSavings \n\nTime \nSavings \n\nAccident \nSavings \n\nOthers \n\nLocal \nRoads \n\nTotal \n\nNet \nBenefits \n\nBenefits \n\n811 \n1,700 \n2,278 \n1,641 \n28 \n18 \n16 \n15 \n13 \n11 \n9 \n7 \n5 \n3 \n212 \n0 \n(1) \n(1) \n(2) \n(2) \n(3) \n(4) \n(5) \n(4,621) \n\n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n519 \n586 \n661 \n744 \n838 \n942 \n1,059 \n1,189 \n1,335 \n1,498 \n1,680 \n1,860 \n2,059 \n2,279 \n2,523 \n2,791 \n3,087 \n3,415 \n3,776 \n4,175 \n\n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n63 \n76 \n91 \n110 \n131 \n156 \n187 \n223 \n265 \n315 \n375 \n432 \n497 \n572 \n658 \n756 \n869 \n999 \n1,148 \n1,319 \n\n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n39 \n42 \n45 \n48 \n51 \n55 \n59 \n63 \n67 \n72 \n77 \n80 \n83 \n87 \n91 \n95 \n99 \n103 \n107 \n112 \n\n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n66 \n72 \n82 \n91 \n101 \n112 \n124 \n138 \n153 \n171 \n190 \n205 \n222 \n240 \n260 \n282 \n306 \n332 \n362 \n327 \n\n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n757 \n70 \n853 \n77 \n85 \n963 \n94  1,086 \n103  1,223 \n113  1,378 \n124  1,553 \n137  1,750 \n150  1,971 \n165  2,221 \n182  2,503 \n194  2,771 \n207  3,068 \n221  3,399 \n236  3,767 \n252  4,176 \n269  4,630 \n287  5,136 \n306  5,699 \n334  6,266 \n\n(811) \n(1,700) \n(2,278) \n(1,641) \n729 \n835 \n947 \n1,071 \n1,211 \n1,367 \n1,544 \n1,742 \n1,966 \n2,218 \n2,290 \n2,771 \n3,069 \n3,401 \n3,769 \n4,178 \n4,633 \n5,140 \n5,703 \n10,887 \n \nEconomic internal rate of return: 18.6 % \nNet present value: 4,248 (CNY million)  \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\nCNY = Chinese yuan, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, O&M = operation and maintenance, VOC = vehicle \noperating cost. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \nTable A13.2: Sensitivity to Changes in Economic Benefits and Costs \n \n\nScenario \n\nSwitching \nValue (%)a \n\nNPV  \n(CNY million) \n\n1.

All  projections  are  in  current \nterms.  The  domes tic  inflation  rate  is  assumed  at  2%  for  2005,  3%  for  2006,  and  4%  for  2007 \nonward. The international inflation rate used is 2.4% throughout the projection period. \n \nB. \n \n2.  \n \n\nThe project expressway financial projections are based upon the following assumptions: \n \n(i)  \n\nCorporate  income  tax  is  assessed  against  the  expressway  operating  entity  at \n33% of net profit per year. \n\nMajor Assumptions for Financial Projections \n\n \n\n(ii)  \n\n \n(iii) \n\nGovernment  grants  consist  of  equity  capital  of  CNY369  million  contributed  by \nHunan  Provincial  Government  and  CNY880  million  by \nthe  Ministry  of \nCommunications. Both grants are included in the cost of construction. \n\nThe  toll  is  based  on  vehicle  size  and  types  (small  passenger  vehicles,  buses, \nsmall  trucks,  medium  trucks,  and  large  trucks including containers and trailers) \nand distance traveled. Toll-exempted vehicles (such as military, emergency, and \npublic  security  vehicles)  are  expected  to  make  up  about  5%  of  total  traffic.  The \nfee schedule will be updated regularly to reflect real price increase and domestic \ninflation.  Based  on  the  toll  rates  and  the  forecast  traffic  mix,  the  weighted \naverage  expressway  toll  rate  is  assumed  at  CNY0.99  per  medium-truck \nequivalent -kilometer (km) in the first operating year (2008). The analysis shows \nthat toll revenues from the average unit toll should be able to generate sufficient \nfunds  to  serve  the  repayment  of  the  loan  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB).  Traffic  revenues  will  be  generated  from  2008  with  annual  traffic  growth \nrates for 2008\u20132018 and 2019\u20132028 at 6.1% and 5.1%, respectively.  Adequate \ntoll  charges  are  very  important  for  the  financial  viability  of  expressway  projects. \nThe  level  of  tolls  must  generate  enough  revenue  to  obtain  the  higher  financial \nrate  of  return  on  investment,  but  not  deter  potential  users  and  compromise \neconomic objectives. These objectives can be contradictory, because the former \nrequires  a  higher  toll  while  the  latter  requires  a  lower  one.  The  proposed  toll \ncharges  for  the  expressway  were  carefully  assessed,  reflecting current average \ntolls in other expressways in Hunan:  \n\n \n\nTable A14.1: Toll Charges  \n(CNY per vehicle-km, 2004 prices) \n \n\nSmall Car \n0.45 \n\nBus \n1.0 \n\nLight Truck  Medium Truck \n\n1.0 \n\nHeavy Truck \n1.5 \n\nSource: Hunan Provincial Communications Department. \n\n0.5 \n\n \n\n(iv)  \n\nThe  operating,  management,  and  maintenance  costs, \nincluding  routine \nmaintenance  are  CNY47.5  million  per  year:  CNY14  million  per  year  for  the \noperating  and  management  costs  and  CNY33.5  million  per  year  for  the \nmaintenance  costs  in  2004  prices.  The  operating  and  management costs are \n\n\f52\n\nAppendix 14   \n\nbased  upon  the  employment  of  one  person  per  year  per  km  to  operate  and \nmanage all the sections of the project roads and connector roads. Management \ncosts are estimated at CNY32,000 per year per 6 km for each management staff, \nat CNY40,000 per per year for each tolling staff, and at CNY40,000 per per km \nper  year  for  each  maintenance  staff.  For  tunnel  operations,  CNY0.5  million  per \nyear  for  tunnels  less  than  1  km  and  CNY2  million  per  year  per  km  for  tunnels \nlonger than 1 km were assumed.  The maintenance costs have been estimated \non the basis of a unit rate of about CNY81,000 per year per kilometer. Operation \nand  maintenance  costs  will  increase  in  line  with  traffic  growth  and  domestic \ninflation.  \n \nFor  the  life  of  the  ADB  loan,  the  currency  is  assumed  as  US  dollar,  and  no \nconversion  of  interest,  currency,  rebate,  or  surcharge  is  assumed.  ADB  loan \nrepayment  and  domestic  loan  repayment  will  begin  in  2010.  The  interest  rate \ncharged  on  the  ADB  loan  was  estimated  at  5.85% (based on the  2004  London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)  in  US  dollars  and  the  10-year  swap  cost  for \nvariable  to  fixed  interest  rate).  The interest rate on the domestic loan is 5.18%. \nThe domestic loan will have  a  25-year term including a grace period of 5 years. \nThe commitment fee of 0.75% per year is included. \n\n  \n(v)  \n\n \n\n(vi) \n\nAfter  10  years  of  full  operation,  the  expressway  will  be  repaved.

The major assumptions include the \nfollowing. \n \n\n(i) \n\nThe FIRR calculation is in constant 2004 prices. They cover 24 years, comprising \nabout 4 years of construction (2005 to 2008) and 20 years of operation (2009 to \n2028). \nThe FIRR was calculated after corporate income tax. \n\n(ii)  \n(iii)   Capital  costs  include  all  incremental  capital  expenditures  related  to  the \nconstruction  and  equipment  of  the  project  roads,  but  exclude  local  roads,  price \ncontingency provisions, and interest during construction. \n\n(iv)   Operating  costs,  including  management  costs  and  maintenance  costs,  are  all \nincremental costs for operation and management of the project expressway, but \nexclude depreciation provisions. \n\n(v)   Operating revenues were projected based on forecast traffic based on proposed \ntoll  rates  for  the  project  expressway  in  real  terms.  Toll  rates  are  regularly \nupdated,  according  to  domestic  inflation.  The  traffic  volumes  have  taken  into \naccount  vehicles  that  are  exempt  from  tolls,  such  as  military,  emergency,  and \npublic security vehicles. \nPeriodic maintenance is assumed to take place in the  tenth year of full operation \n(2019), at the constant cost of CNY182 million. \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii)  About  a  half  of  equipment  will  be  replaced  in  the  fifteenth year of  full  operation \n\n(2024). \n\n \n2.  \nThe result of the financial evaluation for the project expressway shows an FIRR in real \nterms  of  7.6%  after  corporate  income  tax  (Table  A15.1).  This  is  higher  than  the  real  after  tax \nweighted  average  cost  of  capital  for  the  Project  estimated  at  4.4%. Sensitivity analysis of the \nfinancial return was carried out to test the effects of several scenarios on key parameters that \ndetermine costs and revenues. The Project is shown to be most sensitive to (i) capital costs, (ii) \nrevenue stream, and (iii) delay in completion. An increase of 20% in capital costs will reduce the \nFIRR to 6.0%; a decrease of 20% in revenues will reduce the FIRR to 4.9%; and a 1 year delay \nin  construction  reduces  the  FIRR to  7.0%.  Under  the  most  adverse  scenario  (capital  costs \nhigher by 20%, and revenues lower by 20%), the FIRR would fall to 3.5% (Table A15.2).  \n \nAdequate  toll  charges  are  very  important  for  the  financial  viability  of  expressway \n3. \nprojects. The level of tolls must generate enough revenue to obtain the higher financial rate of \nreturn on investment, but not deter potential users and compromise economic objectives. These \nobjectives  can  be  contradictory,  because  the  former  requires  a  higher  toll,  while  the  latter \nrequires  a  lower  one.  Sensitivity  tests  on  the  level  of  tolls  show  that  at  a  toll  of  CNY0.99  per \nMTE-km,  both  the  FIRR  and  economic  internal  rate  of  return  could  be  justified.  The  FIRR \nreaches its maximum at CNY1.98 per MTE-km.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n55\n\n  \n \n\n  \n \n\n  \n \n\nTable A15.1:  Financial Internal Rate of Return  \n(constant 2004 prices, CNY million) \n  \n  \n \n \n\n  \n \n\n  \n \n\n  \n \n\n  \n \n\n  \n \n\n Total    Capital   Operating  Maintenance   Corporate \n\n  \n\nProject \nYear \n  1 \n  2 \n  3 \n  4 \n  5 \n  6 \n  7 \n  8 \n  9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n\n \nYear \n2005 \n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \n2027 \n2028 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n Revenues  Costs \n851.9 \n1,703.8   \n2,271.8   \n851.9   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n182.0 \n \n \n \n \n36.5 \n \n \n \n\n389.6 \n419.7 \n452.2 \n487.2 \n524.8 \n565.4 \n609.2 \n656.3 \n707.0 \n761.7 \n812.9 \n867.5 \n925.8 \n988.0 \n1,054.4 \n1,125.2 \n1,200.8 \n1,281.5 \n1,367.6 \n1,459.4 \n\n(962.0) \n\n33.5 \n33.8 \n34.2 \n34.5 \n34.8 \n35.2 \n35.6 \n35.9 \n36.3 \n36.6 \n37.0 \n37.4 \n37.7 \n38.1 \n38.5 \n38.9 \n39.3 \n39.7 \n40.1 \n40.5 \n\nCosts \n \n\nCosts \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\nTax \n \n\nTotal \nCosts \n851.9 \n1,703.8 \n2,271.8 \n851.9 \n130.2 \n140.5 \n74.7 \n88.9 \n104.1 \n120.5 \n137.9 \n156.6 \n116.7 \n198.2 \n401.0 \n240.9 \n264.0 \n288.7 \n314.9 \n379.4 \n372.5 \n404.1 \n437.7 \n(488.6) \n\n82.7 \n92.5 \n26.3 \n40.0 \n54.7 \n70.5 \n87.5 \n105.7 \n65.2 \n146.3 \n166.6 \n187.9 \n210.5 \n234.7 \n260.4 \n287.7 \n316.8 \n347.9 \n380.9 \n416.1 \n After Corporate Tax \n\nCash Flow \nAfter \n Taxes \n(851.9) \n(1,703.8) \n(2,271.8) \n(851.9) \n259.4 \n279.2 \n377.5 \n398.2 \n420.7 \n445.0 \n471.2 \n499.6 \n590.4 \n563.5 \n411.8 \n626.6 \n661.7 \n699.3 \n739.4 \n745.8 \n828.3 \n877.3 \n929.8 \n1,948.0 \n\n7.63% \n\n \n \n\n14.0 \n14.1 \n14.3 \n14.4 \n14.6 \n14.7 \n14.9 \n15.0 \n15.2 \n15.3 \n15.5 \n15.6 \n15.8 \n15.9 \n16.1 \n16.3 \n16.4 \n16.6 \n16.7 \n16.9 \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \nTable A15.2: Sensitivity to Changes in Financial Factors \n \n\n  \nCase \n \n\nBase Case \n\n1  Capital cost up by 10% \n2  Capital cost up by 20% \n3  Capital cost less by 10% \n4  Revenues decrease by 10% \n5  Revenues decrease by 20% \n6  10% decrease in toll rates  \n7  10% increas e in toll rates  \n8  O&M cost increase by 30% \n9  Project delayed by 1 year \n10  10% capital costs increase and 20% revenues decrease  \n11  20% capital costs increase and 20% revenues decrease  \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return, O&M = operation and maintenance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nChanges \nin FIRR \n\n7.6%\n6.7 \n6.0 \n8.5 \n6.3 \n4.9 \n7.2 \n7.8 \n7.4 \n7.0 \n5.8 \n3.5 \n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 16 \n\nSUMMARY ETHNIC MINORITIES DEVELOPMENT PLAN  \n\nIntroduction \n\nSocioeconomic Characteristics of Ethnic Minorities in the Project Area \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nAn ethnic minorities development plan (EMDP) has been prepared to ensure equitable \nsharing  of  project  benefits  and  to  propose  mitigation  measures  to  adverse  effects  for  ethnic \nminority  communities 1  in  the  project  area.  Adequate  provisions  to  enhance  the  economic \nconditions of ethnic minorities are integrated in project design. Special mitigation measures are \nincluded in the resettlement plan, and will help ensure that ethnic minorities adversely affected \nby  resettlement  will  also  benefit  from  the  Project.  Government  policies  and  programs  for \nminorities further help protect and enhance project benefits.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe total minority population in project area is estimated at about 1.3 million. The Project \nwill directly benefit about 774,000 ethnic minorities. They make up 37% of beneficiaries of the \nexpressway  and  54%  of  the  local  roads.  Ethnic  minorities  have  limited  access  to  transport \nservices  and  own  fewer  vehicles  due  to  road  classification,  government  regulations, \ninaccessible  credit,  or  unreliability  of  transport  services.  Road  access  among  the  surveyed \nminority villages is as low as 57%, compared with 65% for the Han communities. An improved \nroad  network  in  the  project  area  will  enable  ethnic  minority  families  to  seek  both  social  and \neconomic  opportunities.  About  8%  of  resettlement-affected  households  are  poor  ethnic \nminorities. The Bai, Miao, Tujia, and Yao make up  96% of the total minority populations in the \nwestern  section  of  the  project  area.  Levels of  education  and  artisan  skills  differ for  minority \nnationalities within the project area. There is little gender disparity in school enrollment rates at \nthe primary level due to education programs and overall socioeconomic growth. However, few \nminority  women have artisan skills for  income-generation  activities  due  to  a  lack  of  access  to \ntechnology services.  \n  \nC. \n \n3. \nThe  EMDP  for  the  Project  is  based  on  regulations  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China \n(PRC)  and  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  policy  for  indigenous  people.  The  Government \nadopted  a  policy  of  ethnic  equality  post-1949 where all  groups  are  legally  and  constitutionally \nequal.  Since  the  1980s  governments  of  autonomous  areas  have  set  and  implement  their  own \neconomic  policy.  Current  government  policies  and  programs  for  minority  nationalities  further \nhelp  to  enhance  project  benefits  to  ethnic  minority  groups.    ADB  policy  aims  to  protect ethnic \nminorities from the adverse impacts of development, and to ensure that ethnic minorities benefit \nfrom  development  projects  and  programs.  The  Project  fully  mainstreams  ethnic  minorities\u2019 \nconcerns  into  its  design,  as  they  are  considered  one  of  the  primary  beneficiaries.  Specific \nactivities  are  incorporated  into  the  proposed  transport  interventions  to  ensure  that  minorities \nshare proportionately in project benefits (Table A16).  Local road improvement is a response to \nthe  development  needs  of  ethnic  minorities.  Significant  project  impacts  include  expanded \ntourism  development,  higher  farm-gate  prices  for  agricultural  goods,  increased  access  to \nmarkets and employment opportunities, and improved social services. \n \nD. \n \n4. \nImplementation arrangements and associated costs for the EMDP have been integrated \ninto  the  overall  project  arrangements,  or  are  part  of  ongoing  government  programs. \n\nLegal Framework and Principles \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n                                                 \n1  Ethnic minority groups refer to those groups that are different from the majority ethnic group, e.g., the Han.  Post-\n1949 policy defines nationalities (minzu) based on shared language, territory, economic base, and traditions and \nculture.  \n\n\fAppendix 16 \n\n57\n\nResettlement  assistance  of  CNY8  million  is  budgeted  for  vulnerable  households  in  the \nresettlement plan.

  \n\n  Yes \n    No \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n Yes \n  No \n\nPoverty Analysis Poverty                                                                                  Classification: Other \n\n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC):  \n \nThe Project will contribute through improved access to markets and social services for the poor; lower transport costs of \nagricultural inputs and products; better access to and interaction with other regions, and employment opportunities  during \nconstruction and after completion owing to increased economic activities. The expressway will help accelerate economic \ngrowth, spur interregional trade, and reduce poverty in the project area. To maximize the benefits of the expressway to \nthe poor, the local road component was integrated into the Project. The integrated approach will improve the rural poor\u2019s \nmobility and road access to economic opportunities , and thereby  contribute to poverty reduction. Better tie-ins between \nthe major roads and local roads will help rural agricultural products reach markets and allow farmers to upgrade farming \npractices. As reliable transport to markets becomes more readily available, cash-crop farming in remote or isolated areas \nwill also be stimulated and the access to off-farm employment opportunities, broadened. \n \n \nB. \n \nThe Project is located in the western part of Hunan(cid:190) one of the poorest regions in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), \nwhich has limited accessibility and widespread, severe poverty. It has a total population of 2.8 million, with the per capita \nannual income of CNY1,660 in 2001. Of 2.3 million rural people, some 56% have annual incomes  below CNY900. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nParticipation during project preparation:  Hunan Provincial Communications Department  (HCD) undertook socioeconomic \nsurveys  and  public  meetings,  which  raised  the  level  of  awareness,  gained  local support, and enabled stakeholders to \nvoice opinions and suggestions for project design and implementation. The participatory approach was initiated during \nproject  design,  and  is  an  ongoing  activity  that  will  continue  during  project  implementation.  The  poor  and  women  have \nbeen carefully considered in the conduct of participatory activities. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nFor  the  selection  of  unskilled  labor  in  the  project  area,  the  contractors  will  discuss  opportunities  with  villagers  in  the \nvicinity  of  the  expressway  alignment,  and  train  them  as  necessary.  During  the  selection  of  the  expressway  alignment, \nleaders of the affected villages were consulted in order to minimize the loss of irrigated land and housing. For the local \nroad component, the local villages will provide unskilled labor at market wage rates. Local communities will participate in \nthe project benefit monitoring. Some community-based organizations may be involved in the implementation of the village \neconomic  rehabilitation  component  of  the  Resettlement  Plan  (RP),  and  in  activities  related  to  the  ethnic  minorities \ndevelopment plan (EMDP). \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nWomen will not be adversely affected by the Project, as they will gain many project benefits. Nevertheless, some specific \nmeasures are included in the social action plan to enhance the Project\u2019s benefits to women. \nHas an output been prepared? \n \n\n   Yes               \n\n    Yes \n\n   No  \n\n  Yes \n\n   No \n\n   No \n\n \nE.   Social Safeguards and other Social Risks \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone \n\n Significant \n Not significant \n None \n\n Significant \n Not significant \n None \n\n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n \nThe RP was prepared, disclosure of information booklet, full \nRP  posted  on  websites,  use  of  in-house  capacity  and \nexperience, and implementation monitoring by  HCD and an \nexternal agency. \n \n\nPlan Required \n\n Full \n Short \n None \n\n Yes \n  No \n\nItem \n\nResettlement \n\nAffordability \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 17 \n\n59\n\nLabor \n\nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\n Significant \n Not significant \n None \n\n Significant \n Not significant \n None \n\nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerabilities \n\n Significant \n Not significant \n None \n\nThe  Project will hire  unskilled labor from  villages along the \nalignment. \n\n Adverse impact in terms of STI/HIV/AIDS and measures to \nensure  project  benefits  accruing  to  ethnic  minorities  are \naddressed  in  the  EMDP.  Land  acquisition  impacts  are \naddressed in the RP. \n \n\n Yes \n  No  \n\n  Yes \n   No \n\n  Yes \n   No  \n\nEMDP = ethnic minorities development plan, HCD = Hunan Provincial Communications Department, STI = sexually \ntransmitted  infections,  HIV/AIDS  =  acquired  immune  deficiency  syndrome,  human  immunodeficiency  virus,  RP = \nresettlement plan.  \n \n1. \nInitial  poverty  and  social  analysis  undertaken  during  technical  assistance  (TA)  fact-\nfinding identified key poverty and social issues to be analyzed during project preparation. Based \non the findings, a poverty and social analysis was carried out to ensure that the Project meets \nsafeguard  policy  requirements  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  involuntary \nresettlement and indigenous peoples. \n \n2. \nWith the expressway, the journey time between Changde and Huaihua will be cut by 2\u20133 \nhours. By lowering transport costs and travel time along the corridor, the Project will improve the \navailability  of  daily  necessities  in  the  local  markets  and  villages  nearby  its  interchanges, and \nimprove  the  access  to  markets  and  income-generating  opportunities.  Poor  farmers  will  earn \nhigher  profit  margins  owing  to  lower  transport  costs.  Migration,  an  important  cash  income \nsource  for  rural  people,  will  increase  with  the  better  access  to  other  cities  and  provinces. \nIncreased tourists to the Golden Tourism Triangle Area with improved roads will bring significant \nadvantages to the poor in  Yuanling and Fenghuang counties. Some 1.9 million people (66% of \nthe  total  population, of whom  42%  are  ethnic minorities)  will  directly  benefit  from  the  Project. \nHalf  of  1.3  million  rural  beneficiaries  are  poor,  while  15%  of  573,000  urban  beneficiaries  are \npoor.  Some  774,000  ethnic  minorities  will  benefit  from  the  Project\u2014about 33% are urban and \n46% are rural (Table A17.1).
