An environmental impact assessment was undertaken; on 2 \nAssessment      April 2004, the summary  was published on the web site of the Asian \n        Development Bank (ADB) on 2 April 2004. \n \nProject  Description  The Project is located in the western part of Hunan Province, one of \nthe poorest regions of the PRC. The Project will (i) construct a 173 \nkilometer (km)  expressway across hilly to mountainous terrain; (ii) \nimprove 517 km of local roads servicing poor counties and townships; \nand  (iii)  provide  consulting  services  and  training  to  enhance \nconstruction  quality,  road  safety,  and  project  monitoring  and \nevaluation. \n \nRationale  The  Project  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  Western  Region \nDevelopment Strategy by supplying a link  in the vital Changsha\u2013\nChongqing  corridor(cid:190) one  of  the  eight  prioritized  western  corridors \nincluded in 10th Five-Year Plan. The project area is largely rural and \nmountainous  with  limited  accessibility.  Around  56%  of  the  rural \npopulation  is  defined  as  poor  with  an  annual  income  of  below \nCNY900.  Road  infrastructure  is  inadequate  to  support  economic \ngrowth, a necessary prerequisite to tackle poverty in the project area. \nSome 86% of the roads in Hunan fall below class III. The national \nhighway (NR319), which runs parallel to the project expressway and \ncurrently serves as an outlet to major trading destinations such as \nChongqing,  is  a combination of class  III and below roads  with \npavement  in  poor  condition.  Over  65%  of  the  highway\u2019s  length \nexperiences frequent congestion and interference from nonmotorized \ntraffic. Traffic on NR319 has grown at around 7.3% annually over the \npast few years and  will exceed the highway\u2019s capacity at several \npoints by 2008. A better road network in western Hunan is needed to \nfacilitate economic growth and to integrate the poor, isolated western \nregions with the economic centers. The Project is expected to boost \neconomic activities in western Hunan, encourage interregional trade, \nthus reducing poverty in the project area. Consistent with ADB\u2019s \ncountry operational strategy, the  Project\u2019s approach integrates the \nconstruction of the expressway and improvement of local roads so \nthat the benefits of the expressway are spread over a wider cross-\nsection of local poor communities. \n \nObjectives  The Project\u2019s principal objective is to increase economic growth and \nthus reduce poverty in Hunan. The Project will (i) enhance economic \nefficiency,  foster  trade,  facilitate  interregional  integration,  and \nimprove traffic safety; (ii) provide a link in the Changsha\u2013Chongqing ", "iv   \nwestern corridor; (iii) spread economic and social benefits over a \nwider cross-section of local communities by improving accessibility \nfor the rural poor in the corridor; and (iv)  help  improve  people\u2019s \nincomes and well-being. The Project comprises (i) constructing a 173 \nkm,  4\u2013lane,  access\u2013controlled, toll expressway from  Changde  to \nHuaihua, including tunnels and bridges, interchanges, toll stations, \nand service areas; (ii) upgrading or improving 517 km of local roads, \nthereby  providing  improved  access  to  poor,  minority  areas;  (iii) \nprocuring equipment for road maintenance and safety, toll collection, \nsurveillance  and  communications,  tunnel  ventilation  and  lighting, \nvehicle axle load testing, and environmental protection; (iv) provide \nfor  land  acquisition  and  resettlement;  and  (v)  provide  consulting \nservices for construction supervision, safety audits, monitoring and \nevaluation, and capacity building. \n \nCost Estimates  The total cost of the Project is the equivalent of $778.1 million, with a \nforeign exchange cost of $314.2 million (40%) and a local currency \ncost equivalent to $463.9 million (60%). The cost of the local road \ncomponent is $81.9 million. Of the  $312.5 million ADB loan, $12.5 \nmillion will finance the local road component. \n \nFinancing Plan                       ($ million)  \n Source  Foreign  Local  Total \n   \nExchange  Currency  Cost \n    ADB loan  312.5  0.0  312.5 \n    Ministry of Communications   0.0  106.4  106.4 \n    Hunan Provincial Government  1.7  38.3  40.0 \n     Domestic loan   0.0  319.2  319.2 \n    Total  314.2  463.9  778.1 \n            Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $312.5 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nprovided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate determined in  accordance with \nADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% \nper annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan and project agreements. \n \nAllocation and Relending  The  ADB  loan  proceeds  will  be  relent  by  the  Borrower  to  Hunan  \nTerms   Province, which will onlend $300 million to the Changji Expressway \nConstruction  and  Development  Company  (CECC)  with  the same \nfinancial terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. CECC will \nbear the interest rate variation  and foreign exchange risks. Hunan \nProvince will keep the balance of $12.5 million to be used for the local \nroad component and will bear the interest rate variation and foreign \nexchange risks for this amount. \n \nPeriod of Utilization    Until 30 June 2010 \n \n ", "  v \nEstimated Project     31 December 2009 \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency    Hunan Provincial Communications Department (HCD) \n \nImplementation    CECC  will  be  the  implementing  agency  responsible  for  planning, \nArrangements     implementing,  and   operating   the  project  expressway.  The  project  \nimplementation unit established within CECC will be  responsible for \nexpressway construction. The local road improvement program will be \nimplemented under the overall responsibility of HCD. \n \nProcurement  Goods and services financed by the ADB loan will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works for the \nexpressway will be procured through international competitive bidding. \nProcurement for the local roads financed by the $12.5 million ADB \nloan will use  local competitive bidding, while procurement for the \nlocal  roads  under  government  financing  will  follow  government \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. Equipment will be procured through \ninternational competitive bidding. ADB approved  advance action for \nprocurement of civil works in May 2004. \n \nConsulting Services  The Project will provide 49 person-months of international consulting \nservices  and  about  5,184  person-months  of  domestic  consulting. \nInternational consulting services will be provided under the Project to \n(i) assist in project management during the construction period; (ii) \nprovide expertise in tunnel and bridge construction; (iii) assist in \npreparing the operation and maintenance concession framework and \nbidding documents; (iv) enhance the provision of transport services; \n(v)  conduct  a  safety  audit  of  the  project  design  and  make \nrecommendations on improving the safety of completed construction \nworks; (vi) help set up and implement quality control procedures; (vii) \nassist in formulating a human resource development and training \nprogram;  and  (viii)  help  establish  and  implement  a  project \nperformance management system, including the assessment of the \nimpact on poverty reduction. Of the 5,184 person-months of domestic \nconsulting services, 300 person-months will be allocated to the local \nroad component for ensuring proper design and supervision, project \nmonitoring  and  evaluation,  training  of  the  engineering  staff, and \nmanaging the Project.  \n \nOverall  project  supervision  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  chief \nsupervision engineer\u2019s office. The chief supervision engineer (CSE) \nwill be assisted by two deputy CSEs, one of whom will be the team \nleader of the international consultants. He or she will help the CSE \nwith  project  and  contract  management  activities,  and  certify  the \ncontractor\u2019s progress payments and contract variations prior to their \napproval by the CSE.  The international consultants will be financed \nfrom the ADB loan; they will be recruited  based on the quality and \ncost-based selection method in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants. The domestic consultants will be financed ", "vi   \nfrom domestic resources and will be recruited in accordance with \ngovernment procedures acceptable to ADB. \n \nProject Benefits     With  the new  expressway,  the  travel   time  between  Changde and  \nand Beneficiaries    Huaihua will be reduced by 2\u20133 hours. The better road conditions will  \nreduce vehicle operating costs, a benefit that is expected to flow \ndown  to  the  townships  and  villages  over  time.  The  project \nexpressway will directly benefit transport providers, bus and truck \noperators,  passengers,  and  traders.  It  will  speed  up  transport, \nprovide  a  comfortable  ride,  improve  road  safety,  and  reduce \naccidents. Migration, an important  source of cash income for most \nrural  households,  will  also  increase  with better access  to  other \nregions. Poor farmers will benefit from better profit margins gained \nthrough lowered transport costs of agricultural inputs and outputs, \nand higher market competition. The poor in Yuanling and Fenghuang \ncounties will obtain benefits by increased tourism, as the improved \nroads will help spur the tourism potential in the area. Improved roads \nwill also facilitate the flow of information.  Some 1.9 million people \n(66% of the total population in the project area) will directly benefit \nfrom the Project, of whom, around 42% are ethnic minorities. Of the \n1.3 million rural beneficiaries, 49% are poor, including the 287,000 \npoor  beneficiaries  of  the  local  road  component.  The  economic \ninternal rate of return for the Project is estimated at 18.6% and the \nfinancial internal rate of return for the expressway component at \n7.6%, higher than the 4.4% real weighted average cost of capital.  \n \nRisks and      The Project is not expected to be subject to any significant technical \nAssumptions     risks.  Tunnels  and deep-cut   works   will   be  carefully  investigated   \nbefore construction and monitored to avoid implementation problems. \nThe expected continued economic growth and the ensuing traffic \nincrease  limit  the  risk  that  potential  economic  benefits  will  not \nmaterialize. Initial traffic was estimated based on the actual traffic of \nthe  ADB-financed  expressways  in  the  project  corridor. Sensitivity \nanalysis  indicates  that  the  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  are \nstable. Since the Project will generate revenue in domestic currency, \na financial risk is related to changes in the exchange rate. However, \nsensitivity tests indicate that an adverse change in the exchange rate \nwill have only a minimal effect on the financial internal rate of return. \nA major environmental risk is possible soil erosion. A soil erosion \nplan has been developed, and incremental costs have been included \nin the project cost. The villages in the project area may be at risk of \nacquiring and transmitting  human mi munodeficiency virus/acquired \nimmunodeficiency syndrome Targeted and broad-based  advocacy \nand awareness programs will be carried out  in the project area to \nmitigate this risk.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Hunan Roads Development II Project. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  The  PRC\u2019s  economic  growth  since  the  1980s  has  resulted  in  an  unprecedented \nexpansion in intra- and interprovincial traffic. The economy\u2019s changing structure and increasing \ndiversification have altered the pattern of transport demand. The demand for road transport has \noutpaced that of other transport modes. There is a rapidly increasing movement of goods and \npassengers by road, which is more flexible and responsive than other modes to the needs of a \nmarket economy. The shift in transport demand also reflects the loosening of anticompetitive \nrestrictions in the road transport industry itself.  Between 1990 and 2003, road traffic grew \naround 9.6% per annum (p.a.) for passenger traffic, reaching 769.6 billion passenger-kilometers \n(km); and  around 5.7% p.a. for freight, reaching  708 billion ton-km.  In 2003, road traffic \naccounted for 55.7% of the country\u2019s total passenger traffic and 13.2% of total freight traffic.  \nWith the country\u2019s rapid economic growth, low vehicle ownership rates, lower car prices after \nWorld  Trade  Organization  accession,  increasing  access  to  loans  to  finance  automobile \npurchases, and investment in automotive manufacturing ($6 billion provided by the state banks \nduring 2001\u20132003), the fast expansion in vehicle fleets will continue in the coming years. ADB \nsupports the improvements of road transport efficiency and service quality through its technical \nassistance (TA) program.1  \n \n3.  To meet the growing demand for improved access to markets and services and to build \nan enabling environment for the private sector, the Government has made major efforts to \nincrease the country\u2019s  road capacity.2 The heart of the road network development is the \nNational Trunk Highway System (NTHS), a 35,000 km system of interprovincial expressways \nand high-class highways to be constructed over 20 years (target completion: 2007). The NTHS \nwill be complemented by the development of a network of national, provincial, county, and \ntownship roads. The Government\u2019s road development policies are: (i) constructing expressways \nto expand the NTHS and link all cities that have a population more than 500,000 and (ii) \ndeveloping secondary roads, particularly those that will help reduce poverty and promote rural \nmarkets. The Government adopted the Western Region Development Strategy (WRDS), a key \ntheme of the 10th Five-Year Plan (FYP) (2001\u20132005), to enhance economic development in the \nwestern part of the country, where most of the poor reside. The WRDS aims to reduce  the \ndisparity between the western and coastal regions, and assigns a high priority to road sector \ndevelopment as a means to promote economic growth and poverty reduction in the western \nregion. The proposed Project,  a 173 km section of the Changsha-Chongqing corridor, will \nsupport the WRDS by building an important link in one of the eight prioritized western corridors \nincluded in 10FYP3 and improving access to  Changsha and other cities in the poor western \nregion. The project framework is in Appendix 1. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Peoples Republic of China for Policy Reform in Road Transport. Manila. \n2  Roads in PRC are classified by design capacity into expressways, and class I-IV and unclassified roads. The \ndesign capacity of class I is 7,500-15,000 medium truck equivalent (MTE), and 1,500-3,750 MTE for class II road.  \nMTE is a standard unit for measuring traffic volume in the PRC.  Passenger cars are equal to 0.5 MTE and large \narticulated trucks, to 2.0 MTE. \n3  These include  Altai-Hongqilafu, Xi\u2019ning-Korla, Yinchuan-Wuhan, Arongqi-Behai, Lanzhou-Mohan, Xi\u2019an-Hefei, \nChangsha-Chongqing, and Chengdu-Zhangmu. ", "2  \n4.  As a result, the road network grows from 1.16 million km in 1995 to 1.81 million km in 2003, \nfor an average annual increase of 81,300 km.4 The length of expressways increases from 2,141 \nkm to 29,800 km.5 The density has increased from 12.1 km per 100 square km (km2) in 1995 to \n18.6 km per 100 km2 in 2003. The new road development program (2003\u20132020) will increase the \nroad network to over 3 million km, or by 68,000 km annually. Expressways will  increase to \n70,000 km. In 2003 the Government launched 5,300 rural road projects, covering 78,000 km \nand costing $9.1 billion.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.  Problems \n \n5.  Despite the huge investment, the road network is still underdeveloped in both quality and \nextent, and  does not provide access to large parts of the country, particularly in the poorer \ninland regions. High-standard roads (above class II) account for only 12% of the total network. \nThe remaining 88% are medium- to low-grade paved roads and gravel roads. The road density for \nevery 1 million inhabitants is only 1,100 km. The growing road transport demand has put a strain \non the road infrastructure, as manifested by the congestion and bottlenecks in the network. \nWeaknesses in the road network have  resulted in  high transport and logistics cost between \ninterior provinces and the coastal ports.6 A road sector analysis is included in Appendix 2. \n \n6.  Hunan, located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, is bordered by Jiangxi to the \neast, Chongqing to the west, Guangxi to the south, and Hubei to the north. In 2003, the region\u2019s \nper capita GDP was CNY 6,549, 85% of the national average. Agriculture is the mainstay of the \neconomy, employing 69% of the labor force. The major agricultural products\u2014ramie, wheat, rice, \ncorn, tea, and citrus (cid:190) are grown in the Yuan Valley, through which the Project passes. Hunan \nhas a potential for industrial development. Its industrial output grew over 20% p.a. during 2000-\n2003. The major sectors include steel, nonferrous metals, coal, chemical processing, machinery, \nand textiles. The demand for its products from other provinces has sharply increased in recent \nyears. However, weaknesses in road infrastructure lag, failing to adequately support economic \ngrowth. Some 86% of the roads in Hunan are below Class III. The national highway (NR319), \nwhich runs parallel to the project expressway and currently serves as a link to major trading \ndestinations such as Chongqing, is a combination of Class III and lower roads. The pavement is \nin poor condition. Two thirds of the road suffers frequent congestion and nonmotorized traffic \ninterfere with fast moving traffic, which frequently lead to accidents. Traffic on NR319 has grown \nat around 7.3% p.a. in the past few years and will exceed its capacity at several points by 2008.  \n \n7.  The Project is located in the western part of Hunan(cid:190) one of the poorest areas in the \nPRC. The project area is largely rural and mountainous with limited accessibility. About 56% of \nthe rural population is defined as poor with annual per capita incomes of below CNY 900. The \npoor are concentrated in remote communities in mountains. Due to geographical isolation and \nthe high cost of motorized transport, most farmers in the mountainous poor villages do not have \nadequate access to markets and have limited mobility beyond their immediate communities. \nLow-grade farm-to-market roads and collector markets increase handling costs and postharvest \nlosses, further depressing farm-gate returns and the incentive to raise production. Inadequate \n                                                 \n4  The Government\u2019s commitment to improve road infrastructure is reflected in a large investment program, which \nreach $44.9 billion in 2003 (source: Ministry of Communications (MOC). 2004. Transport Statistics). \n5  The PRC now ranks second after the United States in terms of length of expressways. \n6  The shortage of adequate road networks has slowed economic growth and regional development. A World Bank \nstudy argued that the annual economic costs of insufficient road infrastructure in the PRC in the 1980s amounted \nto 1% of its gross national product (World Development Report, 1994). ", "  3\nroad access is an impediment to higher agricultural productivity and prevents the poor from \ntaking advantage of job opportunities in towns.  Better roads in western Hunan  is needed to \npromote economic growth and integrate the poor, isolated regions with the economic centers. \n \n8.  The private sector will be the PRC\u2019s engine of employment generation and a main \nmechanism to increase productivity. According to an Asian Development Bank (ADB) survey, \ninfrastructure constraints are among the impediments faced by private companies operating in \nthe  PRC.7 If  private  investment  is  to  be  attracted  to  the  poor  interior  provinces,  road \ninfrastructure,  among  other  things,  needs  to  be  improved.  The  country\u2019s  road  investment \nrequirements (1996\u20132010) are estimated at $504 billion. Available revenues are estimated at \n$302 billion from road user charges and $29 billion from toll collections, leaving a financing gap \nof $173 billion. Consistent with ADB\u2019s policy dialogue, the Government creates a framework to \nattract private financing for roads. ADB provided TA to strengthen the institutional capacity for \nthe private sector participation in roads.8 \n \n2.  Opportunities \n \n9.  ADB\u2019s operational strategy in the PRC\u2019s road sector supports (i) the  construction of \nroads that connect major growth centers with hinterland economies; (ii) the integration of the \nnetwork, so that the NTHS is supported by a system of local roads, particularly those that \nprovide access to poor areas; (iii) the promotion of road safety; (iv) institutional strengthening to \nincrease  financial  and  managerial  efficiency  in  expressway  operation;  (v)  the  adoption of \nappropriate pricing policies to  optimize  the  road  transport  capacity;  and  (vi) the  use of \nalternative  methods  of  investment  financing.  Consistent  with  this  strategy,  policy  dialogue \nfocuses on key issues,  such as strengthening the poverty reduction  impact, enhancing the \nprovision of transport services, operation and maintenance concession to the private sector, and \nimproving road safety. These comprise the special features of the Project. \n \n10.  The Project, which will support the Government\u2019s 10FYP and WRDS, is consistent with \nADB\u2019s country operational strategy.  The 173 km expressway from Changde to Huaihua will \nsupply a link in the Changsha-Chongqing corridor. The expressway will shorten the distance \nbetween Changde and Huaihua by 45 km and will reduce the journey time by 2\u20133 hours, thus \noffering a considerably faster and safer alternative. By lowering transport costs and improving \nthe frequency and level of transport services, the Project is expected to spur economic activities \nand interregional trade, and thereby help reduce poverty in the project area. The development \nof the road network in western Hunan  will help  transmit the benefits of the eastern region\u2019s \neconomic growth to the poor region. The local road improvement has been integrated into the \nProject to spread the benefits of the expressway over a wider cross-section of poor communities. \nThe integrated approach will improve the rural poor\u2019s mobility and road access to  economic \nopportunities, thereby helping raise their incomes in the project area. \n \n11.  The impact of  road investments on poverty reduction was  confirmed in studies that \nexamined the effectiveness of the government\u2019s various sectoral expenditures in contributing to \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2003.

", "4  \ngrowth and poverty reduction.9 The studies concluded that a significant portion of rural poverty \nreduction is attributable to nonfarm employment and wage increases. Road investment has a \nsignificant impact on the creation of such opportunities in the rural economy. The importance of \nroads in improving the quality of life is highlighted in an ADB-financed study.10 A regional TA \nreviewed  the  poverty  reduction  impact  of  infrastructure  projects.11 TA  3900  examined  the \nsocioeconomic impact of road investment in the PRC.12 The findings of TA 3900 reconfirm the \ncontribution of road investments to poverty reduction in the PRC as well as the validity of the \ngeographic focus of the road portfolio  on the poorer western interior provinces.13 The results \nalso confirm that complimentary investments in local roads strengthen the impact of expressway \ninvestments. Well-integrated road investments  help ensure that the benefits derived from the \nexpressway filter down to the poor. These results affirm the relevance of ADB\u2019s strategy in the \nroad sector.  An ADB-financed TA14 will also help the Government prepare a road network \nstrategy that promotes expressway and local roads to meet communities\u2019 needs and support \neconomic growth, and to provide road agencies with cross-disciplinary skills and tools. \n  \n12.  External assistance to help the Government develop its road sector strategy has been \ngiven, mainly by  ADB, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), and the World \nBank. Since 1991, ADB has provided 27 loans, totaling $4.8 billion, to finance 3,500 km of road \ndevelopment, together with 5,800 km of associated local road networks. Since 1995, local roads \nhave been included in the scope of road projects to make ADB\u2019s interventions in the road sector \nmore pro-poor. Of the ADB-funded projects, 12 have been completed and are open to traffic. \nADB also has provided 45 TA packages, totaling $23.6 million, to the road sector. The advisory \nTAs have addressed policy and institutional issues, including highway planning, road safety, \nhuman  resources  development,  transport  pricing,  and  the  mobilization  of  nongovernment \nfinancial resources. The World Bank and JBIC have provided about $6.1 billion and $990 million \nrespectively to finance road investments. ADB coordinates with the World Bank and JBIC to \nensure the complementarity of aid involvement in the transport sector (Appendix 3). \n \n3.  Lessons Learned \n \n13.  The  Hunan  Provincial  Communications  Department  (HCD)  has  experience  as  an \nexecuting agency (EA) in 4 externally financed road projects,15 including the Hunan Expressway \nProject financed by ADB. The operation and maintenance of the ADB-financed expressways, \nChangtan and Changyong, was awarded a concession to a company in 1998.  The lessons \nlearned  from  this  Project16 suggest  that  while  this  experience  introduced  sound  business \npractices to the Hunan\u2019s expressway sector, the concessionaire, was a joint venture between \nthe government and the private sector and consequently the terms of concession were reached \nthrough direct negotiation without the transparency in the bidding. Concession with private \ncompanies should be awarded through transparent competitive bidding. Other lessons include \n                                                 \n9  S. Fan, L. Zhang, and X.

International consulting inputs for the supervision of \ncivil works were strengthened in the Project. \n \n14.  Performance reviews18 of completed road projects concluded that all loans to the road \nsector in the PRC have been or are being implemented satisfactorily. Of 7 completed projects, 6 \nprojects were generally successful and 1 was partly successful. The project performance audit \nreports  for  3  road  projects19 concluded  that  the  projects  were either highly successful or \nsuccessful. The lessons learned from previous ADB-financed road projects are reflected in the \nproject design. To avoid delayed loan effectiveness due to delay in the procurement process, a \ntendering company was recruited to prequalify the civil works contractors. ADB\u2019s procurement \nguidelines and requirements, including the anticorruption provisions, were discussed extensively \nduring appraisal. Emphasis was put on the need to (i) strictly follow ADB\u2019s mandatory bidding \ndocuments,  (ii)  evaluate  bids  according  to  ADB-approved  evaluation  criteria,  and  (iii) \nsubstantiate clearly the conclusions of the bid evaluation. The Government has made significant \nefforts to combat corruption in the road sector. To date, 15 government officials from  10 \nprovinces have been found to be involved corruption. Information related to these corruption \ncases is in the public domain. There is no evidence that any of the reported corruption was \nrelated to ADB funded road projects. During project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was \nexplained to government officials. The section on fraud and corruption that was added to ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants is an efficient mechanism \nfor preventing unethical behavior. ADB\u2019s program for the PRC included assistance for improving \ngovernance and providing incentives to reduce the incidence of fraudulent practices. 20 \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objectives \n \n15.  The principal objective of  the  Project is to facilitate  efficient,  sustainable  economic \ngrowth and thus contribute to poverty reduction in Hunan. The Project will (i) improve economic \nefficiency, foster trade, and facilitate interregional integration by alleviating congestion, reducing \nVOCs, and  improving  traffic safety; (ii) supply a missing  link in the Changsha-Chongqing \nwestern corridor; (iii) spread economic and social benefits over a wider cross-section of local \ncommunities by improving accessibility for the rural poor in the corridor; and (iv) improve \npeople\u2019s incomes and well-being. \n                                                 \n17 During the implementation of the Xiheng expressway, the first World Bank project, handbook for road safety audits \nwas developed. During the implementation of the Changlin expressway, the second World Bank project, the \nhandbook\u2019s practical application was enhanced and is now used in all expressway projects in Hunan.  \n18 ADB. 2001.

The Project comprises (i) the construction of a 173 km, four-lane access-controlled, toll \nexpressway from Changde to Huaihua, including tunnels and bridges, interchanges and toll \nstations, and service areas; (ii) the upgrading or improving of 517 km of local roads, thereby \nproviding  improved  access  to  404  villages;  (iii)  the  procurement  of  equipment  for  road \nmaintenance and safety, toll collection, surveillance and communications, tunnel ventilation and \nlighting,  vehicle  axle  road  testing,  and  environmental  protection;  (iv) land acquisition and \nresettlement; and (v) consulting services for construction supervision, safety audits, monitoring \nand evaluation, and capacity building. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n1.  Poverty Reduction Impacts\u2014the Local Road Component \n \n17.  In line with ADB\u2019s policy dialogue, a local road improvement program was integrated into \nthe Project to expand the road network in rural minority villages and to meet their needs.21 The \nintegrated approach will help spread the expressway benefits to the poor. Better tie-ins between \nthe expressway and local roads will help rural agricultural products reach markets and allow \nfarmers to upgrade farming practices. As reliable transport to markets becomes more readily \navailable, cash-crop farming in remote or isolated areas will be stimulated and the access to off-\nfarm employment opportunities will be broadened. A set of 9 priority local road sections in the \npoor area, totaling 517 km, was selected from Hunan\u2019s road development plan.  \n  \n18.  Of the ADB loan of $312.5 million, $12.5 million will be provided for the local road \ncomponent, which will finance one section from Zhangjiajie to Yuanling.22 The total cost of the \nlocal road component is about $81.9 million, of which $12.5 million (15.3%) will be the foreign \nexchange cost and $69.4 million equivalent (84.7%) will be the local currency cost.  Around \n627,000, or 49% of the 1.3 million rural beneficiaries, including the 287,000 poor beneficiaries of \nthe local road component, have an annual per capita income of below CNY900. The nine local \nroad segments will (i) be implemented concurrently with the expressway component, (ii) use \nGovernment designs and  standards that are  acceptable to the ADB, (iii)  apply ADB\u2019s social \nsafeguard policies, and (iv) be accorded the same degree of attention as the expressway in \nimpact monitoring. The procurement for the ADB-financed section will use LCB, while that for \nthe domestically financed sections will follow government procedures acceptable to ADB. About \n300  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  will  be  allocated  to  the  local  road \ncomponent for ensuring proper design and supervision, project  monitoring and evaluation, \ntraining the engineering staff, and project management.  \n \n2.  Transport Services in the Project Area \n \n19.  The extent to which the lower transport costs derived from a road investment project are \npassed on to the rural poor depends on their access to reliable, affordable and  competitive \ntransport services. The less the access, the less benefits they will receive compared to other \nsocial groups, and thus the lower the poverty impact of the Project. Transport services are well \ndeveloped in the eastern section of the project area close to Changde, but less so in the \nwestern section(cid:190) mountainous and underdeveloped. Few bus and truck operators ply the \n                                                 \n21 Since 1995, the scope of the ADB-financed road projects has been expanded to strengthen their impacts on \npoverty reduction by adding local road improvements to improve the accessibility of poor communities. \n22 This 135-km section, of which 29 km is class IV and the rest is unclassified, will be upgraded to class II (11 km) \nand class 3 (124 km). The upgrading of this section is expected to spur the tourism in the project area. ", "  7\nroutes to the poor villages due to bad road conditions or limited road access. The fares and \nroutes of the formal bus system are regulated, which may result in inefficient services. Thus, \npeople in these areas rely more on informal transport services, such as bicycles and motorized \ntricycles. Despite the crucial role of informal transport services in rural transport, their supply is \nalso insufficient. As a result, the rural poor sell their produce to drive-in traders who have the \nadvantage of a buyer\u2019s market. Adequate and affordable transport services  provided on a \ncompetitive basis  are a prerequisite  to spreading the  Project\u2019s benefits to the rural poor, \nespecially those  who are  beyond the reach of road transport services. Due attention will be \ngiven to such services during the Project\u2019s implementation so that the Project\u2019s benefits reach \nthe rural poor in the project area. Under the ADB loan, an international consultant will be \nengaged to develop an action plan and associated measures, which would be incorporated into \nthe Project. She/he will examine the following measures: (i) increasing the competition among \ntransport service providers, (ii) deregulating fare and route controls to raise system efficiency \nand enhance commercial viability, (iii) making more credit available for the purchase of transport \nvehicles, and (iv) integrating rural transport services into the local roads development (Appendix \n4).  \n \n3.  Operation and Maintenance (OM) Concession to the Private Sector \n \n20.  Hunan  has  actively  diversified  highway  financing  and  encouraged  private  sector \nparticipation  in  expressways.  The  private  sector  is  involved  in  5  expressways  in  Hunan: \nChangtan, Changyong, Xiheng, Changtan West, and Changyi.23 In Changtan, Changyong, \nXiheng,  and  Changyi,  the  private  sector  has  been  involved  in  OM  through  concession \nagreements.24 During the  Project\u2019s initial years of operation, its OM will be  entrusted to the \nChangji Expressway Construction and Development Company (CECC). 25 Then HCD will enter \ninto an OM concession after a few  years of opening. To this end, HCD will develop the \nconcession agreement framework during the implementation of the Project. In particular, due \nattention will be given to enhance transparency in the bidding process for the concession, to \noptimize the gain of the concession to the efficiency in expressway operation. HCD will prepare \na bidding document\u2014which specifies the concession period and selection criteria, and ensures \nadequate pricing and transparent  bidding\u2014and submit it to ADB for review by the midterm \nreview in 2006. Under the ADB loan, an international consultant will be engaged for 1 month to \nhelp HCD prepare the concession agreement and bidding document. The agreement should \ninclude incentives and penalties to ensure  expressway maintenance adheres to the agreed \nstandards. HCD will assess a specific schedule of the concession\u2019s implementation and advise \nADB about it by the midterm review.  HCD and ADB will ensure that (i) the  concession is \nadequately priced by awarding it through transparent bidding; and (ii) expressway maintenance \nwill meet the agreed standards (Appendix 5). \n \n4.  Road Safety \n \n21.  Road safety is a serious concern in Hunan and the PRC. The number of accidents in the \nproject area has increased substantially over the past few years. The 2002 Road Safety Action \nPlan prepared by the  Ministry of Public Security aims to reduce accidents. This goal will be \n                                                 \n23 They are Changsha-Xiangtan, Changsha-Yongan, Xiangtan-Hengyang, Changsha-Xiangtan West, and Changsha-\nYiyang. Changtan and Changyong were funded by ADB (Hunan I Expressway Project [footnote 15]).  \n24 The OM of Changtan was awarded as a 30-year concession to  a company in 1998; in Changyong, the \nconcessionaire was successfully listed in the A-share section of the Shenzen Stock Exchange in 1998; and in \nXiheng, funded by the World Bank, a 20-year concession was awarded in 2002.  See Appendix 5 for details. \n25 The CECC was established as a 100% state-owned company in July 2004 for the construction and operation of the \nproject expressway.  ", "8  \nachieved through driver training, targeted traffic enforcement, and better traffic management. \nThe Road Traffic Safety Law, effective from May 2004, is enforced nationwide. A Road Safety \nCommittee has been established by Hunan Provincial Government (HPG) to investigate causes \nof road accidents and identify preventive measures. At least 6 months prior to the opening of the \nexpressway, HCD will (i) develop and implement a road safety action plan acceptable to HPG \nand  ADB\u2014with  the  help  of  an  international  consultant\u2014for  the  safe  operation  of  the \nexpressway; and (ii) ensure, in collaboration with the Hunan Public Security Bureau (HPSB), \nthat a team of HPSB personnel will patrol the expressway and enforce the new law and \nregulations  in  accordance  with  national  and  provincial  standards.  The  Project\u2019s  major \ncontribution to road safety will be the application of a high standard to the expressway\u2019s \nconstruction  to  reduce  accidents  in  the  corridor.  HCD  will  (i)  use  its  traffic  control  and \nsurveillance system for the safety  of the expressway, (ii) make  all facilities of the system \navailable to the agencies concerned to strengthen traffic enforcement and emergency services \nin  the  corridor;  (iii)  promote  the  use  of  the  Road  Safety  Audit  Guidelines,  applied  to \nexpressways in Hunan, in local roads; and (iv) ensure the enforcement of road safety measures \nin the expressway and local roads. An international road safety specialist will be engaged for 2 \nmonth under the Project to assist HCD in developing the road safety action plan, and check all \ndesigns and safety aspects of the expressway during implementation (Appendix 6). \n \n5.  Vehicle Emissions \n \n22.  The rapid rise in  the number of private vehicles  has drawn attention the problem of \nvehicle emissions. Vehicle emissions will have an adverse impact on the environment if no \nmitigation measures are taken.  The  Government  has  taken  several  measures  to  control \nemissions, through regulation on the automobile industry, annual vehicle test, and inspection \nand maintenance program. The new measures also set emissions and fuel efficiency targets \nand offer tax incentives to encourage developing more environmentally friendly cars. Hunan has \nformal vehicle emission standards by which all types of vehicles regularly tested by the Hunan \nenvironmental protection bureau (HEPB),  in collaboration with  the traffic police. At least 6 \nmonths prior to the opening of the  expressway, HCD will (i) provide ADB with the vehicle \nemission  regulation  limits  prepared  by  the  HEPB  and  the  penalties  for  violating  emission \nstandards; and (ii) provide ADB with the latest government plan to improve air quality in Hunan, \nincluding the cleaner fuel programs (e.g. ethanol and CNG), vehicle testing center facilities, and \nan inspection and maintenance program. An international vehicle emissions specialist will be \nemployed to develop an action plan to control vehicle emissions in the project area, with the \nhelp of the HCD and HEPB. The HCD, in close collaboration with HEPB and other agencies \nconcerned, will implement the vehicle emissions action plan accordingly (Appendix 6). \n \n6.  Resettlement Plan \n \n23.   The  Resettlement  Plan  (RP)  was  prepared  by  the  HCD  based  on  the  detailed \nmeasurement survey (DMS), 56 village surveys, 657 household surveys, local government \nstatistics, and consultations with local officials, village leaders, and affected households. Unless \nproper mitigation measures are adopted, some 37,000 people could be adversely affected by \nthe Project, which includes 6,414 people to be relocated. The total resettlement cost including \ncontingencies is estimated at CNY434.5 million ($52.5 million).  A resettlement information \nbooklet, with sections on resettlement policy and impacts, compensation rates and entitlements, \norganizational arrangements, consultation and participation, and grievance procedures,  was \ndistributed to the affected villages and publicized in the local media in November 2003. The RP, \nwhich has been discussed with county level offices, was submitted to ADB in January 2004 and \napproved by ADB in May 2004. The final RP, updated based on the DMS, was submitted to ", "  9\nADB in June 2004, posted on ADB\u2019s web site both in English and Chinese in August 2004, and \nwill be distributed to affected county and township offices. For the local roads component, HCD \nis the responsible agency and the implementing agencies will be the county communications \nbureaus. There will be some resettlement along the local road section to be financed by the \nADB loan; other local roads will only require paving. A summary RP is in Appendix 7. \n \n7.  Stakeholder Participation and Consultations \n \n24.  During the feasibility study, environmental impact assessment (EIA), and  resettlement \nplanning, consultations were conducted with government agencies, villagers, other people likely to \nbe affected by the Project, and local groups to discuss environmental concerns, land acquisition \nand resettlement issues, and economic development potential. Village investigations and surveys \nwere conducted in the project area to assess the potential adverse effects and benefits of the \nProject.  Over  3,370  people were  interviewed  in  public  opinion  surveys,  social  assessment, \nenvironmental assessment, and resettlement planning. For the RP, consultation meetings were \nheld with the affected counties, townships, and villages. The Project was well known by the rural \npeople and public support for it was high. The local officials explained the policies and regulations \nfor land compensation and housing removal to those who would be adversely affected by the loss \nof farmland or  housing. These concerns were considered in (i)  determining the alignment to \nreduce adverse social, resettlement, and environmental impacts; (ii) designing connector roads \nand  pedestrian  access;  and  (iii)  completing  a  detailed  RP. The consultation process  was \nexpanded  to  finalize  the  design  and  formulate  appropriate  compensation  standards  and \nrehabilitation measures for people displaced by land acquisition or house demolition. Villagers \nparticipated in the discussions and decisions on village resettlement (Appendix 8). \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n25.  The total cost of the Project is the equivalent of $778.1 million, with a foreign exchange \ncost of $314.2 million (40%) and a local currency cost amounting to the equivalent of $463.9 \nmillion (60%). The cost of the local road component is $81.9 million. Of the ADB loan, $12.5 \nmillion is allocated for the local road component, with the remaining costs to be funded by the \nprovincial  and  county  governments.  HCD  has  committed  to  ensure  the  appropriate \nimplementation of the local road component during the project period (Appendix 9). \n \nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n \nItem    Foreign Exchange  Local Currency  Total Cost \nA.

", "10  \nE.  Financing Plan \n \n26.  The Government has requested a loan of $312.5 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The Borrower of the Loan will be the PRC. The loan will \ncarry a 25-year term, with a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% p.a., and other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements. The Government has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility on the basis of these terms and conditions; and (ii) an undertaking that these choices \nwere independently made, not influenced by any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n27.  Of the total project cost, ADB will finance 40.2%; the Government, 13.7%, on a grant \nbasis; and HPG, 5.1%, using its own funds. The remaining local currency cost of $319.2 million \nwill be domestically raised by HPG.  The ADB loan proceeds will be made available to  the \nGovernment, which, in turn, will make them available to HPG, on the same financial terms and \nconditions as those of the ADB loan.  HPG will bear the interest rate  fluctuation and foreign \nexchange risks. HPG will onlend a portion of the loan proceeds\u2014$300 million\u2014to CECC on the \nsame financial terms and  conditions as those of the ADB loan. CECC will bear the interest \nfluctuation and foreign exchange risks. Hunan Province will keep the balance of $12.5 million and \nuse it for the local road component; it will bear the interest rate variation fluctuation and foreign \nexchange risks. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \n  Source  Foreign Exchange  Local Currency  Total Cost \n       \nAsian Development Bank  312.5  0.0  312.5 \nMinistry of Communications   0.0  106.4  106.4 \nHunan Provincial Government  1.7  38.3  40.0 \nDomestic loan   0.0  319.2  319.2 \n  Total  314.2  463.9  778.1 \n       \n          Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF.

CECC will be the implementing agency, responsible for \ncoordinating and monitoring all construction activities of the expressway, as well as operating \nthe expressway. CECC\u2019s general manager, the project director, will be responsible for overall \nproject management in respect to the expressway, the approval of contracts, and payments. \nHCD will implement the local road component through the local communications bureaus. A \nproject implementation unit established within CECC will facilitate land acquisition, resettlement, \nand  environmental  protection  measures,  and  ensure  that  local  concerns  are  adequately \naddressed. The unit is headed by a project manager, who will oversee physical implementation \nactivities day-to-day and prepare progress reports. Apart from its central office, CECC has \nseven toll stations and four maintenance centers. CECC has sufficient technical capability to \nhandle  the  Project.  However,  its  institutional  capacity  needs  to  be  further  strengthened; \nassistance will be provided under the consulting services. ", "  11\n2.  Implementation Period \n \n29.

Preliminary design was completed in March 2003 and detailed design in December 2003. \nCompletion of the preconstruction activities is targeted for 31 October 2004. The construction of \nthe expressway is scheduled to start in  March 2005 and the Project will  be completed by \nDecember 2009. The construction schedule is in Appendix 10. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n30.  All ADB-financed procurements will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The main \ncivil works will be divided into 21 packages and the equipment, into 3 packages, all of which are \nto  be  procured  under  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures  (Appendix  11). \nAncillary  facilities,  including  the  administration  building  and  service  areas  building  under \ndomestic financing, will be procured using local competitive bidding (LCB). The procurement for \nthe local road section financed by the ADB loan will use LCB, while the procurement for the \nlocal roads under government financing will follow government procedures acceptable to ADB. \nThe international bidding will be conducted by a qualified  tendering company with previous \nexperience in externally funded projects. Only prequalified contractors with adequate technical \nand financial capacities will be allowed to bid for several packages; they may be awarded more \nthan one contract based on the least-cost combination of contracts. The relevant sections of \nADB\u2019s anticorruption policy will be included in all documents and contracts related to the bidding \nand implementation of the Project. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n31.  The  Project  will  provide  49  person-months  of  international  consultants  and \napproximately 5,184 person-months of domestic consultants. Thirty-six of the 49 person-months \nof international consultants will be for the supervision of the civil works; 1 person-month each for \npavement design, tunnel construction, vehicle emissions and environment, the operation and \nmaintenance concession, and transport services; 2 person-months each for road safety, and \nsocioeconomic  and  poverty  impact  monitoring  and  evaluation;  and  4  person-months  for \nadditional experts, as needed.  Of the total of  5,184 person-months of domestic consulting \nservices, 300 person-months will be allocated to the local road component. HCD will establish 6 \nresident  supervision  engineer  offices  for  construction  supervision,  environmental  and \nresettlement monitoring,  and project performance monitoring and evaluation.  Overall project \nsupervision will fall under the responsibility of the chief supervision engineer\u2019s office. The chief \nsupervision engineer (CSE) will be assisted by 2 deputy CSEs, one of whom will be the team \nleader of the international consultants. He or she will assist the CSE in project and contract \nmanagement activities, and certify the contractor\u2019s progress payments and contract variations \nprior to their approval by the CSE. The international consultants will be financed by the ADB loan \nand will be recruited based on the quality- and cost-based selection method in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Domestic consultants will be funded by domestic \nfinancing and recruited in accordance with government procedures acceptable to ADB. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "12  \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n32.  The loan will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.26 \nSince most of the payments will be made for large contracts (above the equivalent of $100,000), \ndirect payments, reimbursements, and commitment procedures will be used to withdraw loan \nfunds.  If  government  funds  are  used  first  for  eligible  expenditures,  ADB\u2019s  reimbursement \nprocedure will be followed. To expedite the flow of funds, the statement of expenditures \nprocedure may be used for reimbursement of eligible expenditures for any individual payment \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $100,000. \n \n6.  Advance Procurement Action \n \n33.  The Government requested for advance procurement action for civil works,27 which ADB \napproved  in  May 2004. This covers the  prequalification of contractors, tendering, and bid \nevaluation for civil works contract packages, but does not include the signing of contracts. The \nadvance actions are being undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement \nand Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The Government and HCD have been advised that \nthe approval of the advance action does not commit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n34.  HCD  and  CECC  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  Project  related  financial \nstatements, such as statements of source and application of funds, income statements, and \nbalance sheet. The income statements will start on the commencement of toll operations. CECC \nand HCD will prepare one set of financial statements each for the expressway and local road \ncomponent and have them audited annually. The audit will be in accordance with appropriate \nauditing standards consistently applied by independent external auditors whose qualifications, \nexperience, and terms of reference are acceptable to ADB. HCD and CECC will submit to ADB \nwithin 6 months of the end of each related fiscal year,  certified copies of audited project \naccounts and financial statements and an auditor\u2019s report for the Project, all in English. To \nensure that internal controls and checks on the project construction costs and operations are \neffective, HCD will establish an internal audit unit and will maintain it during implementation and \noperation  of  the  Project.  The  unit,  composed  of  full-time  accountants,  will  undertake \nindependent tests on day-to-day transactions, prior to reference to external auditors. HCD will \nmake  satisfactory  arrangements  for  reporting  implementation  progress  through  quarterly \nprogress reports. Within 3 months of completion, HCD will submit a project completion report to \nADB. \n \n8.  Anticorruption \n \n35.  During  project  processing,  the  mission  explained  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  to \nprovincial and local government officials, highlighting the section on fraud and corruption that \nwas added to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \nADB\u2019s program for the PRC includes assistance that will improve governance and provide \nincentives to reduce the incidence of corruption in the longer term. For the Project, the EA will \ntake the following anticorruption actions: (i) involving full-time officials from HCD\u2019s supervision \ndivision in bidding, construction, and operations; (ii) introducing a dual-signing system, in which \n                                                 \n26 ADB. 2001. Loan Disbursement Handbook. Manila. \n27 This Project was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 11 February 2004. ", "  13\nthe civil-works contract winner also signs an anticorruption contract with the employer; and (iii) \nperiodic inspections on the contractor\u2019s activities related to fund withdrawals and settlements. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n36.  The HCD concurred with the proposed set of indicators for monitoring and evaluating the \nperformance of the Project in relation to its goals and objectives. Based on the results of TA \n3900, a set of monitoring indicators for the socioeconomic and poverty reduction impacts was \nrefined, in close consultation with HCD and local government officials. The key indicators and \nassumptions outlined under goal and purpose in the project framework (Appendix 1) will form \nthe core of the data required for assessment. Prior to project implementation, HCD will establish \nthe  necessary  baseline  values  for  impact  indicators  and  update  them  during  project \nimplementation. Where relevant, indicators will be disaggregated by gender and ethnic group. \nHCD will measure the indicators for project evaluation on project  inception, completion, and \nannually for 3 years after completion. The level of effort for the project performance monitoring \nsystem (PPMS) tasks will include: 3 person-months of international expertise to design and set \nup the  PPMS and train domestic consultants on monitoring methodology; and  24 person-\nmonths of domestic expertise for database management, village-level surveys, analysis, and \nreporting\u2014for which HCD will recruit an independent local institute. To facilitate the assessment \nof the Project\u2019s socioeconomic impact, the terms of reference to monitor and evaluate project \nimpacts are included in the scope of consulting services to be provided under the Project.  \nReports summarizing the key findings of monitoring at inception, completion, and annually for 3 \nyears thereafter will be submitted to ADB. \n \n10.  Project Review \n \n37.  In 2006, ADB and HCD will carry out a midterm review of the Project, focusing on policy, \ninstitutional, administrative, organizational, technical, environmental, social, economic, financial, \nand other relevant aspects that may have an impact on the performance of the Project and its \ncontinuing viability. The review will examine the progress in implementing sectoral reforms, \npolicy development, resettlement, and compliance with assurances in the Loan Agreement. \n   \n11.  Capacity Building and Human Resources Development \n \n38.  To cope with increased expressway construction and management activities, a Human \nResources Development Plan will be drawn up in time for the start of civil works. The plan will \ntake into account the  EA\u2019s  need  for  capacity  building,  and  the  recruitment  and  training \nrequirements. One element of the plan, an international training program funded by the loan, will \ncover  expressway  operations;  accounting,  auditing,  and  reporting  of  financial  statements; \ncommercial development of expressways and business planning; expressway maintenance; \nroad safety; project management; bridge and tunnel design; traffic engineering; and pavement \ndesign. HCD staff will undergo about 65 person-months of international training. Assisted by the \nconsultants, HCD will prepare the training programs, their location, and a list of candidates, for \nADB\u2019s concurrence. The output of the training will be disseminated through HCD and CECC. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Economic Benefits \n \n39.  In 2003, traffic volume on NR319 reached around 3,510 MTE per day between Changde \nand Huaihua. Traffic has been growing at 7.3% p.a. The traffic on NR319 will reach 5,500 MTE ", "14  \nin 2008, exceeding the road\u2019s capacity at several points. Traffic on the expressway is forecast to \ngrow from  5,630  MTE to  10,130  MTE  per  day  between  2008  and  2018, a 6.1% annual \nincrease.28 Thereafter, traffic growth will slow to 5.1% p.a., reaching 16,700 MTE  by 2028. \nBased on the economic forecast in the project area, the traffic projections consider (i) traffic \ngrowth for the past 10 years, (ii) a probable generation of traffic due to expanded economic \nactivities, (iii) the likelihood that NR319 traffic will be diverted to the expressway once the latter \nis operational, and (iv) origin-destination survey results (Appendix 12).  \n \n40.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the project expressway was estimated by \ncomparing the project case with a base case involving the continued use and maintenance of \nNR319. Without the Project, congestion will worsen, causing delays, increasing VOCs and more \naccident and deaths. The Project, with its shorter distance and travel time, safer design, and \nbetter running conditions, will reduce VOCs and accident risks along the corridor. The economic \ncosts of the expressway are: (i) the capital cost, which includes physical contingencies, land \nacquisition, and resettlement, and (ii) the costs of operating and maintaining the expressway, \nincluding the costs of replacing depreciated equipment.  The economic benefits include (i) \nsavings in VOC due to the shorter distance and improved road conditions, (ii) time savings for \nroad users, (iii) savings in road accident costs, and (iv) benefits to generated traffic.29 Economic \ncosts and benefits have been valued at 2004 economic prices. The benefits identified for the \nlocal road component include (i)  VOC savings to  current and future traffic on the improved \nroads, (ii) crop value-added benefits because of higher farm-gate prices and improved access, \nand (iii)  generated benefits from tourism development. However,  the last two benefits  were \nexcluded in the EIRR calculation since it is hard to quantify them.   \n \n41.  At 18.6% p.a., the EIRR for the Project demonstrated the Project\u2019s economic viability \n(Appendix 13). The VOC savings from the expressway accounted for most of the benefits (66% \nof the total), followed by time savings at 14%. The other benefits were comparatively small. The \nbenefits of the local road component, while  extremely important to the villages concerned, \nconstituted a minor percentage of the overall project benefits, reflecting the modest traffic levels \non the local roads.  The  results of  the sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the \nProject\u2019s economic viability. Changes in the key variables\u2014construction costs, toll rates, and \nbenefits\u2014did not significantly affect its viability, and the EIRR remained above the threshold of \n12% p.a. The EIRR for the expressway was 17.7% and for the local road component, 20.1%. \n \nB.  Financial Benefits \n \n42.  Financial projections have been prepared for the expressway component in accordance \nwith ADB's Guidelines for the Financial Government and Management of Investment Projects \nFinanced by the ADB to assess the financial viability and sustainability of the expressway \n(Appendix  14).  The  projected  financial  statements  indicate  that  financial  revenues  will  be \nsufficient to cover operating and maintenance costs, income taxes, debt service and provide a \nreasonable rate of return. Based on the financial projections, a debt service coverage rate of 1.0 \nwill be achievable from the third year of full commercial operations. The financial evaluation of \nthe expressway was undertaken in real terms using constant 2004 prices. The project cost \nestimates and financial projections in nominal terms were converted to real terms by adjusting \nfor the projected effects of foreign and domestic inflation and currency fluctuations. The financial \ninternal rate of return (FIRR) for the  project expressway, computed on an after-tax basis, is \n                                                 \n28 For the Changtan expressway (ADB funded Hunan I Expressway Project [footnote 15]), traffic growth was 12.2% \np.a. for the first 3 years of operation (1997\u20131999), compared with the 3.4% projected at appraisal. \n29 Environmental benefits will also come from reduced vehicle emissions and noise, but these have not been included \nin the analysis because of the lack of a suitable evaluation methodology. ", "  15\n7.6%. This compares favorably with the weighted average cost of capital, also computed on an \nafter tax basis, of 4.4%. The expressway is considered both financial viable and sustainable. \nSensitivity analysis indicates that the FIRR is robust under adverse conditions (Appendix 15). \nHunan has a toll policy for expressways governed by the Highway Law. The following criteria \nwere used: (i) toll levels on other expressways, (ii) affordability, (iii) benefits to users of the \nexpressway and the alternative roads, (iv) historical and actual traffic flows, and (v) debt service. \nCECC, in consultation with ADB, will propose the toll rates for the expressway. HCD, the Hunan \nFinance Department, and Hunan Price Bureau will evaluate the proposal and approve the \napplicable toll rates. HCD will consult with ADB regarding the proposed initial toll rates 6 months \nbefore the opening of the expressway. HCD and CECC will review the toll annually and monitor \nactual traffic levels and financial performance. \n \nC.  Social and Poverty Reduction Impacts \n \n1.  Project Beneficiaries \n \n43.  The field surveys indicate that the  project expressway will directly benefit road users, \nsuch as transport providers, bus and truck operators, passengers, traders, government officials, \nand the private sector in general. Rural households in the project area are also a beneficiary \ngroup. Farmers, particularly those  living in  the area of the  local road program  and near the \nexpressway interchanges, will be in a position to increase their agricultural incomes through \nbetter access to markets, more competitive  product and input  prices, and cheaper transport \ncosts.  They  will  also  have  better  access  to  social  services,  faster  information  flows,  and \nincreased interaction with the outside world. The poor in Yuanling and Fenghuang counties will \nobtain significant benefits from increase tourism due to improved roads. \n \n2.  Social Impacts \n \n44.  Better roads help to improve the quality of life due to better access to social services. \nMore qualified teachers and doctors are willing to work in the rural areas. Improved roads cut \ntransport costs and the time it takes to go to seek health care at a health facility. The health \nimpact will be reflected in lower mortality and morbidity rates. Road improvements also increase \nthe mobility of people. The construction of the expressway will also increase the number of truck \nand bus drivers passing through communities, putting the residents at a higher risk of acquiring \nand transmitting sexually transmitted infections (STI)  and HIV/AIDS.30 The surveys indicated \nthat rural poor households know little about HIV/AIDS prevention, possibly exacerbating the \ndisease\u2019s spread  to local communities, particularly the minority groups. Through the ethnic \nminorities development plan (EMDP) and social action plan (SAP), the  Project will support \nHIV/AIDS awareness and prevention programs.  Targeted and broadly based advocacy and \nawareness programs will be carried out in the project area.31  \n \n45.  The minority population in the project area totaled 1.3 million in 2002 (41% of the total \npopulation), of whom 96% were Tujia and Miao. Of the total minority people in the area, 60% \nwill benefit from the Project. The major benefits to the minorities include higher income from \nincreased cash-crop farming, more cash income sources due to seasonal migration work, \nenhanced contract with urban centers, and better access to social services. Minorities comprise \n                                                 \n30 Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n31 HCD will ensure that contractors disseminate information on the risks of STIs and HIV/AIDS to their employees \nduring project implementation\u2014a requirement that will be included in the contract. Local public health offices will \ndisseminate similar information to ethnic minorities, transport operators, and women in the project area, in \naccordance with ongoing HIV/AIDS prevention efforts.  ", "16  \nabout 38% of  the people  affected by land acquisition and resettlement.  Adverse impacts on \nminorities are addressed in the RP.32 The EMDP was prepared based on RP, SAP, and ongoing \ngovernment policies and programs for minority groups. In accordance with PRC regulations and \nADB\u2019s  indigenous  peoples  policy  it  provides  special  mitigation  measures  for  the  minority \nhouseholds identified as poor and vulnerable. A summary of EMDP is in Appendix 16. \n \n46.   The Project will enhance women\u2019s access to information and better contact opportunities \nwith towns (as bus passengers) and jobs (as traders or sellers in local markets). Female migrant \nworkers will benefit from the expressway since they often have to travel to distant provinces to \nfind suitable work. The benefits for farmers will include women, as it is they who handle the \nmajority of farm work. Women will also benefit from increased marketing opportunities (most \nfruit and vegetable sellers in local markets are women) and from better access to education and \nhealth facilities. The Project will enhance women\u2019s participation in planning, project monitoring \nand evaluation, and the implementation of other poverty reduction programs, especially in the \nvillages served by the local road  component. Women have an equal opportunity and pay  in \nconstruction and  operation jobs  under  the  PRC  Labor  Law  and  will receive preferential \ntreatment in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development. \n \n3.  Impacts on Poverty \n \n47.  The improved local roads linked to the major road network will facilitate the spread of the \nexpressway\u2019s benefits to the rural economy. By lowering transport costs and travel time along \nthe corridor, the Project will improve the availability of daily necessities in the local markets and \nvillages that are served by its interchanges, and the access to markets and income-generating \nopportunities. With the expressway, the journey time between Changde and Huaihua will be cut \nby 2-3 hours.  Improved local roads will  stimulate the development of  the rural economy by \nspreading the benefits of the expressway into these areas. Poor farmers will get better profit \nmargins because the lower transport costs of agricultural inputs and outputs. Migration to off \nfarm jobs, an important source of cash income for most rural households, will further increase \nas the expressway improves access to other cities and provinces. The expressway will allow \nmore tourists to visit the project area. The improved roads will help develop the tourism potential \nin the Golden Tourism Triangle Area. Increased tourist traffic will benefit the poor residing in \nYuanling and Fenghuang counties. Some 1.9 million people, around 42% of whom are ethnic \nminorities, will directly benefit from the Project. About 49% of the 1.3 million rural beneficiaries \nand 15% of 573,000 urban beneficiaries are poor (Appendix 17).33  \n \n4.  Resettlement Impacts \n \n48.   The  project  expressway  will  directly  affect  22  townships,  97  villages,  and  465 \nlandowning groups in 3 districts or counties: Dingcheng District, Taoyuan County, and Yuanling \nCounty. In the 97 villages, minority nationalities account for 38% of the population. According to \nthe DMS, 1,349 ha of land will be acquired. Of which 38% is farmland, composed of irrigated \nland (79%) and dryland (21%). The remaining portion permanently acquired land comprises of \nforestland, housing plots and bush land. About 290 ha of land will be temporarily used during \nthe construction phase. According to the method described in the Administration Land Law, land \nacquisition will directly affect 30,564 persons who will totally lose their land. Along with land \nacquisition, about 235,000 m2 of houses and other structures will be demolished, which will \n                                                 \n32 Minority households affected by the alignment are more integrated and better off than minorities living in the poor \nmountainous areas. \n33 The urban poverty estimate was based on the per capita monthly income of CNY 180 in municipalities and CNY \n130 in counties. The PPTA study concluded that 15% of the urban population in the project area is poor. ", "  17\naffect about 1,414 rural households,34 5 primary schools, and 1 tree nursery in the Zhengjiayi \nForestry Farm. The total number of affected people is estimated at 37,000.35 An RP was \nformulated in accordance with PRC laws and local regulations, and the  ADB\u2019s Policy on \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  and  Indigenous  People\u2019s  Policy.  The  resettlement  strategy, \ncompensation standards, entitlements, and rehabilitation plans were based on impact surveys \nand consultations with local officials and affected households. Considering that the  degree of \nthe impact on villages is modest and most of the affected persons are not poor compared with \nthe average income in their community, the RP will be implemented smoothly. Land acquisition \nwill be completed in 2004 and compensation will be paid prior to the displacement of people or \nloss of land. Compensation and other allowances will be used to invest in economic and social \ninfrastructure  so  that  farmers\u2019  livelihoods  and  living  standards  will  improve.  Economic \nrehabilitation plans have been prepared for 10 seriously affected villages. Special attention will \nbe paid to the vulnerable groups to prevent their marginalization or impoverishment. \n \nD.  Environmental Impacts \n \n49.  The Project is classified as environmental category A by ADB. The EIA report was \nprepared by HCD, under the supervision of HEPB, and approved by the State Environmental \nProtection Administration in November 2003. The EIA assessed environmental impacts of the \nselected  alignment  of  the  expressway  and  the  local  road  component,  and  prescribed \nenvironmental  protection  and  mitigation  measures  costing  $2.4  million.36 The  proposed \nalignment does not cross or impinge on any protected areas. There are no known rare or \nendangered species in the project area, and no old growth forest, with the exception of one tree \nnear Guanzhuang village. This tree is believed to be more than 400 years old, and has been \ntagged as a protected item. The alignment was diverted away from this area, thereby increasing \nits length by about 700 meters. The Project\u2019s major environmental impacts include soil and \nwater conservation, erosion control, borrow and disposal site management, and revegetation. \nBorrow and spoil disposal sites  were identified at 10 km intervals. An erosion control and \nprotection plan was prepared separately from the EIA, and approved by the Water Resources \nBureau. Environmental mitigating measures will be incorporated in the bidding documents and \nbills of quantities of the civil work contracts. \n \nE.  Project Risks \n \n50.  Since the project expressway will pass through hilly and mountainous terrains, tunnels \nand  deep  cut  works  will  be  carefully  evaluated  by  an  international  tunnel  expert  before \nconstruction  begins,  and  subsequently  monitored  to  avoid  implementation  problems.  The \nprequalification of contractors will focus on their technical and financial capacity in handling \ncomplex works. During the construction period, monitoring and contract management systems \nwill be set up with the assistance of the international consultants for the timely identification of \ntechnical issues and implementation of corrective measures. The expected continued economic \ngrowth and the ensuing traffic increase limit the risk that potential economic benefits will not \nmaterialize. Based on the actual traffic of the expressways in the project corridor, the estimated \n                                                 \n34 Of the people affected, 12% are poor. \n35 The final alignment and staking survey was done in close consultation with local officials, village leaders, and \npeople to be affected so as to minimize the loss of high quality land. The local villagers have discussed their \nrequirements for accessibility once the expressway is constructed. Local roads will be rerouted and underpasses or \noverpasses will be constructed to ensure the unhindered flow of local traffic. \n36 A summary EIA was circulated to the ADB Board on 30 March 2004, and placed on the ADB web site on 2 April \n2004. The Chinese version of the EIA was sent to the Project\u2019s field offices as reference for the public and other \ninterested parties. ", "18  \ninitial traffic is probable. The proposed toll level is consistent with the local economy and reflects \nthe  trend  in  tolls  for  PRC  expressways.  HCD  reviewed  the  tolls  for  each  expressway  to \nmaximize the traffic flow along the corridor. ADB\u2019s policy dialogue on private sector participation \nin expressways will promote the efficiency of the financial and operational management of the \nexpressway. The financial covenants will encourage  CECC to exercise improved  operating \nefficiency and better financial management for the market-based financial costs. Since the \nProject will generate revenue in domestic currency, there is a financial risk from fluctuations in \nthe exchange rate. However, sensitivity tests indicate that an adverse change in the exchange \nrate will have only a minimal effect on the FIRR. A potential environmental risk is soil erosion \ndue to road construction, which may worsen the natural soil erosion resulting from the removal \nof vegetation, soil disturbance, and the exposure of the bare soil surface. A comprehensive soil \nerosion plan was developed and the associated incremental costs were included in the project \ncost.  The Project will improve mobility of people, which may exacerbate the rapid spread of \nHIV/AIDS  to  local  communities,  particularly  the  minorities.  Targeted  and  broadly  based \nadvocacy and awareness programs addressing the associated risks of HIV/AIDS will be carried \nout in the project area. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n51.  In addition to  the standard assurances, the following specific assurances  have been \nincorporated in the legal documents.  \n \n52.  Counterpart Financing. The Government will take, and will cause HPG, through HCD, \nto take all necessary measures to ensure that (i) CECC can successfully construct the project \nexpressway, and (ii) the local roads construction and improvements are completed prior to the \ncompletion of the project expressway. \n \n53.  Construction Quality. HCD will ensure that (i) the Project is constructed in accordance \nwith MOC\u2019s revised technical standards of highway engineering; (ii) the local roads under the \nProject are upgraded, constructed, and maintained in accordance with national standards; and \n(iii) project construction supervision, quality control, and contract management are conducted in \naccordance with national standards and internationally accepted practices. \n \n54.  Road  Safety.  (i)  At  least  6  months  prior  to  the  commencement  of  expressway \noperations,  (a)  HCD  will,  in  coordination  with  the  international  consultant,  develop  and \nimplement  a  plan,  acceptable  to  HPG  and  ADB,  for  ensuring  safe  operation  of  road \ninfrastructure facilities; and (b) HPG will establish teams of security personnel, in accordance \nwith national and HPG standards,  to patrol the project expressway and enforce the  national \nlaws and regulations. HCD shall utilize its traffic control and surveillance systems to implement \nroad safety measures for the Project; and (ii) CECC will (a) put in place the road safety signage, \nemergency communication system, traffic monitoring included in the project design; and (b) take \nall appropriate measures in order to prevent overloading on the project expressway by installing \nvehicle axle weighing and weighing scales equipment at expressway tollgates. \n \n55.  Tolls. At least 6 months prior to the opening of the expressway, HCD will propose the \nappropriate toll rates for the expressway in accordance with the Highway Law (which requires \nthat toll rates be set at levels sufficient to fulfill the debt service obligations of the Project as well \nas maintain sound operation, management, and maintenance practices for the Project). For the ", "  19\nfirst 3 years of full commercial operation, HCD will review the toll structure and levels and report \nto ADB significant difficulties in meeting the principles established under the Highway Law.  \n \n56.  Financial Ratios. HCD will ensure that CECC maintains a debt service coverage ratio of \nnot less than 1.0 from the third year of full commercial operation.  \n \n57.

Road Network \n \n1.  In 2003, the highway network of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) comprised 1.8 \nmillion kilometers (km), an increase of  44,600 km from 2002. Of this, 1.4 million km were \nclassified\u2014class 2 and above roads accounted for 271,600 km, 15% of the total length. Density \nincreased from 12.1 km per 100 square km (km2) in 1995 to 18.9 km per 100 km2 in 2003. In 2003, \nHunan\u2019s road network accounted for 4.8% of the country\u2019s total, with a length of 85,233 km. Of \nthis total, 45,544 km (53.4%) were classified: 1,218 km of expressways (1.4%), 468 km of class \nI roads (0.5%), 5,173 km of class II roads (6.1%), and 32,830 km of class III-IV roads (38.5%). \nUnclassified roads amounted to 46,376 km (54.7%).  \n \nB.  Vehicle Fleet and Traffic \n \n2.  In 2003, the PRC vehicle fleet totaled 24 million trucks, cars, and buses. The privately \nowned fleet of motor vehicles increased  above 20 times during 1985\u20132003, from 0.3 million \nvehicles to  12 million. Despite the rapid increase in total vehicles, there are only about 1.3 \nvehicles for 100 persons, which is  low relative to other  Asian countries. In 2003, about 1.0 \nmillion  vehicles  were  registered  in  Hunan,  of  which  45%  are  passenger  vehicles.  Road \npassenger traffic in Hunan in passenger-km of travel grew at 6.9% per annum (p.a.) between \n1990 and 2003, slower than the 9.3% rate for the PRC as a whole. Road freight traffic, in ton-\nkm, grew at 8.1% annually, compared with 5.7% for the country. Privately owned vehicles in \nHunan totaled 0.36 million vehicles, of which 53% are passenger cars. The Government issued \nnew rules, which will have impacts on PRC\u2019s car industry: by tightening the opening of new car \nfactories, setting a minimum investment for new vehicle factories,  and loosening decade-old \nrestrictions on foreign carmakers. Currently, the PRC has more than 100 manufacturers, but \nmost operate on a scale too small to compete with world-class automakers. Cars are also \namong the sectors where the Government tries to squeeze soaring investment to help ease \ninflation. The new rules also set emissions and fuel efficiency targets and offer tax incentives to \nencourage producing more environmentally friendly cars. \n \nC.  Road Administration \n \n3.  Hunan Provincial Communications Department (HCD) is responsible for regulating the \nroad transport industry in Hunan by licensing drivers, vehicles, and intercity bus services. \nFreight transport is essentially deregulated; however interprovincial bus routes require Ministry \nof Communications\u2019 (MOC) approval. Through tariff reform in trucking, private operations have \nincreased resulting in improved transport efficiency and quality of services from increased \ncompetition. Road administration is decentralized. Road transport tariffs are allowed within a \nrange of plus or minus 20% of advisory tariffs set by provincial and lower administrations on the \nadvice of their communications departments and bureaus. This flexibility, coupled with ease of \nmarket entry, will help ensure that cost reductions resulting from improved road conditions are \npassed on to passengers. \n \nD.  Road Sector Revenues and Expenditures \n \n4.  Expenditures  in  highway  infrastructure  are  financed  from  dedicated  user  charges, \nGovernment grants, domestic bank loans and bonds, and foreign loans and investments. Two \ndedicated user charges, the road maintenance fee and vehicle purchase fee, have provided \nmuch of the financing for the road sector. During the 9th Five-Year-Plan (FYP), the road \nmaintenance and vehicle purchase fee provided 53% and 13% respectively of the total road ", "26 Appendix 2 \ninvestments. Government grants provided 2% mainly to construct or improve rural roads in poor \nareas. The remaining was financed from domestic loans and bonds (9%), other domestic \ninvestments including financing from local governments and state-owned enterprises (12%), \nforeign loans (8%), and foreign direct investment (3%). In Hunan, investment in highways during \nthe 9FYP was CNY30 billion, of which 78% was for expressways and high-grade highways. \nInvestment in 2002 was CNY11 billion, an annual increase of 12%. Proposed road investment \nfor the 10FYP is CNY65 billion, of which 71% is for expressways and high-grade highways. The \nfunding for rural roads is supplemented by poverty reduction funds. HCD expects debt funding \nto increase significantly; 55% of the total expenditure during the 10FYP will be new debt. \n \nE.  Road Engineering, Construction, and Maintenance \n \n5.  Road projects are designed by the planning and design institutes at the provincial, \nprefecture, and county levels. MOC reviews the designs of expressways, high standard roads, \nand associated structures. The institutes are staffed with experienced, well-qualified personnel. \nThe city and county highway bureaus have their own construction units to carry out minor \nprojects within their administrative districts. Competitive bidding practices were mandated by the \n1999 Tendering and Bidding Law. Many of the largest provincial and urban construction units \nare being reorganized into financially independent companies and have been awarded contracts \nindividually or as partners in joint ventures on several ADB- and World Bank-financed in-country \nor overseas projects. Road maintenance is well organized by the expressway companies and \nthe highway administration bureaus and is carried out mainly through labor-intensive operations \nbut with increasing amounts of mechanized works. MOC has established an advanced road \nmaintenance  management  system,  consisting  of  a  road  data  bank  and  a  pavement \nmanagement system, which is being introduced in stages to all provinces and autonomous \nregions, and will become the key tool for programming future maintenance needs and budgets. \n \nF.  Government\u2019s Rural Road Development Program \n \n6.  MOC is drafting a national rural road development plan. Under this plan, rural roads will \nbe developed in three stages. By 2005, total mileage of rural roads will be 1.6 million km; by \n2010, 1.85 million km, connecting 100% of townships and administrative villages in the PRC; \nand by 2020, 2.5 million km and transport services will be provided at the village level. \n \nG.  Policy Dialogue \n \n7.  ADB has been undertaking policy dialogue on the PRC road sector since 1991. The \nprincipal  issues  addressed  include  the  poverty  impact  of  road  projects,  highway  design \nstandards  and  construction  quality,  road  safety,  vehicle  emissions,  pricing  policies, \ncommercialization and corporatization, and nongovernment financial resources. The status and \nachievements to date are summarized in the following Road Sector Policy Reform Plan. \n \nTable A2: Road Sector Policy Reform Plan \n \nInitiative  Current Status  Actions  Target Date \n1.

Overview \n \n1.  The eastern part of the project area includes fertile river flats, and easier access to major \ncities, while the central and western  part is mountainous terrain with a higher incidence of \npoverty. The eastern section of the project area  is close to Changde where the economy is \nprosperous and transport services are adequate in both quality and extent.  In the middle and \nwestern section, including Huaihua Prefecture,  however, transport services are limited. The \nrural population in the area lives in remote, isolated natural villages, of which only two thirds are \nserved by roads(cid:190) most are of poor quality. The mountainous terrain in the area makes it difficult \nto develop a good road network; many administrative villages have only one road linking them to a \ntown. An inefficient transport system can serve as a significant constraint on agricultural efforts \nin rural areas, both by raising the cost and effectiveness of inputs to production and by delaying \nthe sale of harvested crops.  \n \nB.  Transport Demands and Means in the Western Part of the Project Area \n \n2.  In the central and western part of the project area, trucks and buses provide services to \nvillages, but the cost of travel is high. The people in the area mostly rely on informal transport \nservices including bicycles and motorized tricycles to travel to a town. A survey found that the \naverage trip for the poor was longer than that for the non-poor because villages are far away from \ncommercial centers. Such trips are costly for the poor and hence infrequent.1 As a result, the poor \nwho are often limited to walking to nearby rotating village markets can sell their produce up to \nthe amount that they can carry on their backs, or sell it to four-wheel drive-in traders who benefit \nthrough a buyer\u2019s market situation. Likewise, the poor are comparatively limited in traveling to \nbuy farming inputs. On the other hand, higher income households trade at larger markets in \ntowns because they have access to affordable transport services.  \n \n3.  Where there is no road access, all personal trips are made on foot (or at least start on \nfoot). In those villages with road access, a variety of modes is used for journeys. Walking and \nbicycles are the dominant modes for short journeys, but as the journey length increases, the \nnumber of motorized trips increases. Most walking trips are of less than 6 kilometers (km). Even \non short journeys, motorized transport, such as motorized tricycles, is often used. The total \nnumber of trips per household is low. With each household making 1 trip every 3 days, trips \nwithin the township constitute the vast majority of all trips. The traffic volume in a village is quite \nlow. The average volume of grain marketed in a village is below 80 tons per year (equivalent to \nless than one small truck load per week), with similarly small volumes of fertilizer being brought \nin. Only small volumes of passenger traffic are generated. The survey found that the rural \npopulation is most concerned with availability and quality of local roads. The absence of roads \nor very poor quality roads limits access to markets and social infrastructure, health, and \neducation. For instance, one village reported  difficulty crossing a major river that separates \nthem from important social services, such as hospitals.   \n \n4.  Buses. Two-thirds of the villages in the rural remote area are connected to a bus route. \nMost roads in the rural villages are unclassified and in poor condition. Bus operators do not \nnormally operate on unclassified roads, or  they operate with smaller buses and fares 20% \nhigher than those charged on classified roads.  Bus fares depend on the road class, road \nconditions, daily frequency of bus services, and bus size. For a small bus (15\u201320 seats), the \nofficial fare is CNY0.18 per km. Fares can vary in the range of plus or minus  20%. Long-\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance for the People\u2019s Republic of China for Hunan Roads Development II Project. \nManila.  ", "32 Appendix 4 \ndistance  services  are  run  by  companies,  while  intracounty  services  are  normally  run  by \nindividuals.  Normally  several  operators  provide  services  on  each  route,  but  the  extent  of \ncompetition  on  fares  or  on  service  is  limited.    The  Hunan  Provincial  Communications \nDepartment (HCD) controls the number of operators on each route, to prevent over-supply. The \nnumber of trips per day carried out by each operator is also controlled, either through operator \nassociations, or directly by state-owned bus terminal companies, which control the bus schedule \nand allocate slots to operators. The interviews with operators carried out during the survey \nfound  that  these  restrictive  operating  practices  result  in  low  vehicle  utilization  and,  as  a \nconsequence, unnecessarily high operating costs.  \n \n5.  Trucks. Any commercial trucking operation requires a license. The number of large \ntrucks has decreased slightly, while small trucks have increased substantially. Operators must \nmeet basic requirements for financial resources and maintenance. Once licensed, the trucks \ncan operate anywhere in the country. In practice, rates are negotiated between the shipper and \nthe trucker and are normally lower than the Government guidelines. Current freight rates in the \nproject area are CNY0.5 per ton-km. Most trucks are run by small, private operators, although \nsome large state and private companies exist. The state companies are being privatized, and \nthe market appears to be competitive. The restrictions on the granting of licenses are not \nunreasonable, and trucking capacity is adequate, possibly in excess. \n \n6.  Small trucks:  Agricultural Use Vehicles. The agricultural use vehicle is a registration \ncategory, rather than a vehicle type. They are normally small trucks, based on agricultural \ntractors, with a registered capacity of between 500 kilograms and 1 ton, although in practice \nloads of up to twice as much can be carried in these vehicles. In addition, normal trucks, with a \nnominal capacity of less than 2 tons can also be registered for agricultural use. The tractor-\nbased vehicles are common in country towns and villages. \n \n7.  Other Informal Transport Means. Mini-taxis (7-seat buses) are run by a large numbers \nof operators, many of whom appear to be unlicensed. They are based in towns and provide \nservices into the rural areas. The vehicles are normally owned by the drivers. They operate a \nfixed route, pick  up and drop off passengers on demand, and are prepared to negotiate \nvariations on the routes. Fares are normally on a per-trip basis and established by custom, but \ncan be negotiated. \n \n8.   Motor-tricycles provide short distance passenger services in both urban areas and \nvillages. They are also used to carry small volumes of freight, in addition to, or instead of, \npassengers. The negotiable fares are on a per-trip basis. Rates for freight are about CNY0.50 \nper ton-km. However, for short journeys and small volumes, rates are set by custom on a trip-\nby-trip basis. Drivers operate the motor-tricycles without licences. The large urban areas are \ngradually prohibiting motor-tricycles services. \n \n9.  Twin-cab pickups are used to carry both passengers and freight. The back of a pickup is \nenclosed and benches are provided for passengers. The benches can be removed when freight \nis carried. \n \n10.  Agricultural tractors equipped with pulling carts carry cargo on occasion. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "   Appendix 4  33\nC.  Assessment of Transport Services \n \n1.  Adequacy of Transport Services \n \n11.  The study survey found that informal transport services, for both passenger and freight, \nrespond to demand in a flexible way. Service provision increases on market days for those who \nbuy or sell at local markets.  Informal transport services play a crucial role in meeting the \ntransport  demand  for  rural  residents,  thereby  improving  their  mobility.  However,  informal \ntransport supply in rural villages is not sufficient to meet the transport demand. The provision of \ninformal transport services should be increased through an increase in vehicle ownership. There \nare also safety driver licensing issues that need to be addressed. The formal bus system is \nregulated on fares, but there is flexibility on route planning, with the initiative for new routes lying \nwith the operators. Although the number of routes operated in the last 5 years has increased \nsubstantially, about one third of villages in the rural area still do not have a bus route. Most \nroads in those rural villages are unclassified or are in poor condition. The survey results indicate \nthat road accessibility is crucial for bus operators to provide services. The market for trucking \nservices is active and fares are market determined. Where larger volumes of cargo have to be \nmoved, traders are able and willing to pick up produce and bring in inputs. \n \n2.  Constraints of Accessing Transport Services \n   \n12.  The rural poor, especially in the rural, mountainous areas, often have difficulty accessing \ntransport services. Regulated transport services often lead to inefficient service, routing, and/or \npricing in rural areas. Provision of transport services in the project area, especially the central \nand western part, is  insufficient. This is mainly due to lack of competition  in the transport \nservices market, regulations, or government interference. Private operators lack access to credit \nto purchase vehicles, especially for means of informal transport. Inadequate roads make the \nprovision of transport services to the rural poor difficult. In most rural villages, the poor quality of \nroad access was identified as a major problem in accessing transport services. \n \n3.  Interventions to Enhance Provision of Transport Services  \n \n13.  The extent to which the rural poor benefit from a road investment project depends on \ntheir access to reliable and affordable transport services. The less the access, the less benefits \nthey will receive compared with other social groups, and the lower will be the poverty impact of \nthe Project. Due attention will be  given to such services  during project implementation. The \nProject includes an action plan to enhance the provision of transport services. Under the loan, \nan international consultant will be engaged for 1 month to develop an action plan and promote \nspecific  measures  that  will  be  incorporated  into  the  Project.  The  consultant,  in  close \ncoordination with the Executing Agency, will also recommend ways to implement the plan. The \nreport will be submitted to the Asian Development Bank for review by 2006.  She/he look will \nexamine the following measures: (i) increasing competition among transport service providers,2 \n(ii) deregulating  fare and route  controls to  raise system efficiency, (iii) making more credit \navailable for the purchase of transport vehicles,3 and (iv) integrating rural transport services into \nlocal roads development.  \n \n                                                 \n2  To construct competitive environment in rural transport, the following regulatory reforms may be considered: (i) \nregulatory responsibility should be separated from operational responsibility; and (ii) any subsidy should be in the \nform of service contracts between government authorities and operators, and it should be open to competitive \nprocess. \n3  New credit schemes should be established, link to existing credit lines, or work with existing credit institutions to \nbroaden their scope of credit services to support private ownership of informal transport means. ", "34 Appendix 5 \nOPERATION AND MAINTENANCE CONCESSION TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR \n \nA.  Operation and Maintenance Concession \n \n1.  An  operation  and  maintenance  (OM)  concession  is  an  agreement  between  a \ngovernment or a state enterprise and a private enterprise whereby a private enterprise: (i) \ncollects  tolls  from  users,  to  finance  the  maintenance  and  reward  the  concessionaire;  (ii) \nmaintains the road to agreed standards; and (iii) pays an agreement amount to the government. \nAny surplus will accrue to the concessionaire as profit. The bidder who commits the highest \ncanon (or the lowest negative canon, meaning the lowest government support) under a certain \ntoll level will be selected as a concessionaire. The OM concession (i) overcomes public sector \nbudget constraints by securing toll revenues as a maintenance fund without requiring funds to \nflow through the budgeting process; and (ii) increases efficiency in service provision by bringing \nin an experienced private sector concessionaire who can operate and maintain the project \nexpressway, at a lower cost than the government.  \n \n2.  Under an OM concession, the concessionaire assumes the traffic and ultimately the \nrevenue risk. As such, the OM concession is differentiated from a maintenance management \ncontract whereby the private sector maintains an existing road under performance specifications, \nfor which it receives fixed management fees from the government. It is also different from a \nbuild-operate-transfer  (BOT)  scheme  where  the  private  sector  finances  designs,  builds, \noperates,  and  maintains  the  expressway,  under  which  significant  project  risks  including \nconstruction and finance risk are transferred to the private sector. The OM concession is the \npromising alternative modality for private sector participation in the road sector as ti leads \npublic-private  sector  partnering  in  a  feasible  way  by  more  equally  allocating  project  risks \nbetween the government and the private sector. \n \nB.  Operation and Maintenance Concession in Hunan Expressways \n \n3.  Compared with other provinces, Hunan has actively diversified highway financing and \nencouraged private sector participation in expressways. The private sector is involved in five \nexpressways  in  Hunan:  Changtan,  Changyong,  Xiheng,  Changtan  West,  and  Changyi. 1 \nChangtan and Changyong were funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) under the \nHunan Expressway Project.2 Except for Changtan West, which was implemented using a BOT \nscheme, in the other four expressways the private sector has been involved in operation and \nmaintenance through concession agreements. For the Changtan expressway, the 30-year OM \nconcession was awarded to the Modern Investment Company in 1998; the traffic risk is borne \nby the company. For Changyong, the concessionaire, the Modern Investment Company, was \nsuccessfully listed in the A-share section of the Shenzen Stock Exchange in 1998. For Xiheng, \nfunded by the World Bank, the 20-year OM concession was awarded in 2002 to the Modern \nInvestment Company.  For Changyi, a joint venture  between the  Government (51%) and the \nHong Kong Road King Company (49%) was established for construction and operation (Table \n                                                 \n1  The sections are Changsha-Xiangtan, Changsha-Yongan, Xiangtan-Hengyang, Changsha-Xiangtan West, and \nChangsha-Yiyang, respectively. \n2  ADB. 1993.

The Hunan Expressway Construction and \nDevelopment Corporation, established in 1993 as a 100% state owned enterprise, was initially responsible for the \nconstruction and operation of these ADB-funded expressways, and now operates the majority of expressways in \nHunan. ", "Appendix 5  35\nA5). The Hunan Provincial Communications Department (HCD) is pursuing OM concessions \nwith the private sector for three more expressways.3 \n \n4.  These  arrangements  have  introduced  sounder  business  practices  to  Hunan\u2019s \nexpressways and enhanced financial efficiency. However, the full potential of the benefits may \nnot have been  achieved, as  the concessionaires were merely joint ventures between the \ngovernment and the private sector; the concessions\u2019 terms were set through direct negotiation \nand with little transparency. To ensure adequate pricing, the concession should be awarded \nthrough competitive and transparent bidding.4 \n \nTable A5: Private Sector Participation in Expressways in Hunan \n \nRevenue  \nOpen to \nExpressways  Length  (CNY million)  Form of Private Participation  Initial Setting \nTraffic \n1st year  2003 \nChangtan   52 km  1996.12  123.0 (1998)  136.1  OM concession (30 yrs)  SOE \nInitially OM Concession and \nChangyong   25 km  1994.12  24.5 (1995)  38.9  SOE \nthen securitized in 1998 \nChangtan West  28 km        BOT (30 yrs)  Sole venture \nXiheng  117.9 km  2000.12  247.2(2002)  299.2  OM concession (20yrs)  SOE \nChangyi  76 km  1998.7  27.1 (1998)  122.8  OM concession  Joint venture  \nBOT = build-operate-transfer, SOE = state-owned enterprise. \nSource: Hunan Provincial Communications Department.  \n \nC.  Operation and Maintenance Concession for the Project Expressway \n \n5.  During the Project\u2019s initial years of operation, its OM will be entrusted to the Changji \nExpressway Construction and Development Company (CECC), a state-owned company. 5 Then \nHCD will enter into an OM concession after a few  years of opening. To this end, HCD will \ndevelop the concession agreement framework during the implementation of the Project. In \nparticular, due attention will be given to enhance transparency in the bidding process for the \nconcession, to optimize the gain of the concession to the efficiency in expressway operation. \nHCD will prepare a bidding document\u2014which specifies the concession period and  selection \ncriteria, and ensures adequate pricing and transparent bidding\u2014and submit it to ADB for review \nby the midterm review in 2006. Under the ADB loan, an international consultant will be engaged \nfor 1 month to  help  HCD prepare the concession agreement and bidding document. The \nconcession agreement  will set out the rights and responsibilities of the concessionaire and \ngovernment  during  the  concession  period,  to  maintain  the  project  expressway  to  agreed \nstandards, and to collect tolls from users. A draft concession agreement will be included in the \nbidding documents to ensure that all bidders  have equal opportunities.   HCD will  assess a \nspecific schedule of the concession\u2019s implementation and advise ADB about it by the midterm \nreview. HCD and ADB will ensure that (i) the concession is adequately priced by awarding it \nthrough bidding; and (ii) expressway maintenance will meet the agreed standards.    \n \n                                                 \n3  The sections are Yiyang-Changde, Hengyang-Zaomupu, and Xiangtan-Shaoyang(cid:190) the construction is complete on \nall.  \n4  ADB. 1997. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Corporatization, Leasing, and Securitization \nin the Road Sector. Manila. \n5 The CECC was established in July 2004 for the construction and operation of the project expressway.  ", "36 Appendix 5 \nD.  Key Aspects of the Optimal Operation and Maintenance Concession \n \n1.  Environment for Workable Operation and Maintenance Concession \n \n6.  Two basic  laws  should  be  in  effect:  (i)  a  law  that  permits  concessions,  whereby \ngovernment can transfer the right of maintenance to a private party; and (ii) a law that permits \ntolling for use of public facilities and tolling by the private sector. Other laws and regulations are \nalso  essential  to  address  traffic  management  by  the  concessionaire,  policing  the  road, \nadvertising control on the road, arrangement for emergency vehicles, etc. Estimates of traffic \nvolumes are crucial in determining the toll road viability. However, any traffic forecast may be \nuncertain because of the complexity of interaction between economic development, the toll rate, \nand traffic. This high uncertainty for traffic  sometimes discourages the private sector  from \nbidding for concessions. Increasingly, agreement exists that when traffic is particularly uncertain, \nthe traffic risk should be shared by the government and the private sector. The government can \nprovide a downside guarantee for a certain minimum level of traffic, with a complementary \nscheme put together for sharing super-profits if traffic is higher than expected. Most concession \nagreements should include a toll escalation formula that is related to the consumer price index \nand allows for toll increases either every year or every few years. However, the concessionaire \nis sometimes not permitted to increase the toll as specified in the agreement because of \nadministrative intervention or contract frustration. In this case, a clause should be added in the \nagreement to prescribe compensation arrangements that can be acted upon when the toll \nincrease is denied. \n \n2.  Monitoring of Maintenance Performance  \n \n7.  The concessionaire is responsible for maintaining the road at performance standards \nagreed in the concession contract. These standards should be defined  to minimize the long-\nterm cost of preserving the road as well as the cost to the road user.  Performance-based \nconcessions  must  have  appropriate  monitoring  procedures,  combined  with  penalties  for \nnoncompliance.  Concession  contracts  should  include  well-defined  monitoring  procedures. \nInspectors  may  be  hired  to  inspect  the  road  and  make  regular  random  checks  to  verify \ncompliance. A well-documented inventory of the road and daily records of activities undertaken \nby the concessionaire will help understand the specific behavior of the roads and contribute to \nbetter preventive maintenance. To strengthen the monitoring and compliance, road users may \nalso be encouraged to report road deficiencies to the road agency.  \n \n3.  Bidding Process \n \n8.  The  guiding  principle  for  bidding  processes  should  be  to  maximize  competition, \ntransparency, and clarity in the process so that the ultimate road users pay a competitive toll. \nThe major aspects that should be considered for ensuring competitive and transparent bidding \nprocesses are \n \n(ii)  detailed development of the concession should be set out clearly in the bidding \ndocuments, specifying the responsibilities of the concessionaire and government; \n(iii)  a  draft  concession  agreement  should  be  prepared  by  the  government  and \ninclude it in the bidding documents to ensure that all bidders make similar \nassumptions; and  \n(iv)  the decision criteria should be clearly set out in the bidding documents. The most \ntransparent approach is to select a single criterion, perhaps the highest level of \ncanon (or the lowest level of government support) for a given toll. \n ", "Appendix 6  37\nROAD SAFETY AND VEHICLE EMISSIONS \n \nA.  Road Design Standards \n \n1.  The Project expressway has been designed and will be constructed in accordance with \nMinistry of Communications\u2019 standards. This will provide a facility of a high standard in keeping \nwith international practice and will ensure a good degree of safety and operational efficiency.1 \nThe geometric design of the expressway has been selected to ensure that speed limits are \nchosen to suit the geometric design rather than the design speed. Signs, markings, interchange \nstructure, and crash barriers will be selected carefully prior to the expressway opening. All \ninterchanges of the new expressway are of the trumpet layout to minimize land acquisition. \nThey have low loop radii (50 meters [m] to 60 m) and low design speeds (35 kilometers \n[km]/hour [hr]). The minimum taper plus deceleration lengths used in the design are 150 m for \nthe 100 km/hr sections and 130 m for the 80 km/hr sections. Current accident statistics show a \nsignificant number of tail-end collisions at the exit tapers. It was recommended to review the \ndeceleration lengths to take account of the main line to loop design speed change prior to the \ncommencing civil works. Guardrails will be installed when the consequences of a vehicle impact \nwith the barrier are likely to be less severe than an impact with the feature being shielded. For \nthe new expressway, the median width is 2.0 m and continuous guardrail is proposed on both \nsides of the median.  \n \n2.  To maximize benefit from the expressway project, the Hunan Provincial Communications \nDepartment (HCD) will undertake all necessary measures to impound and prohibit overloaded \nvehicles from entering the expressway until the load is reduced to the legal requirements. \nMaintenance works can have a serious effect on traffic flow and safety, especially as traffic \nvolumes  increase.  Adequate  advanced  warnings  of  maintenance  interruptions  to  normal \nexpressway traffic will be given to the road users to minimize inconvenience and delays. The \nexpressway has 15 tunnels.  HCD will implement a pavement management system on the \nexpressway and local roads and develop a complete maintenance management system to \nprovide  realistic  maintenance  budgeting,  expenditure  control,  performance  standards,  and \nevaluation. Regarding the safety of tunnels, HCD has developed an emergency plan according \nto a safety audit.  As part of the final design, HCD will prepare a risk management plan to cover \nareas of safety concern during construction, especially construction of bridges and tunnels. \n \nB.  Road Accidents And Traffic Enforcement \n \n3.  Accident rates in the PRC are high compared with many other developing countries. \nRoad accidents and their resultant economic losses represent a substantial problem and require \nurgent attention. The 2002 accident statistics for the PRC were 773,137 accidents, 109,381 \nfatalities, and 562,074 injuries. This equates to one death every 5 minutes, the highest such rate \nin the world.  The economic cost to the country is significant; between 1\u20133% of its gross \ndomestic product. Hunan had 28,056 accidents, 3,658 fatalities, and 27,468 injuries in 2002. To \naddress this issue, the Ministry of Public Security prepared the 2002 Road Safety Action Plan, \nwhich aims to (i) reduce serious accidents, involving more than 10 fatalities, by 10% compared \nwith 2001; and (ii) eliminate major accidents, involving 30 or more fatalities. This will be \nachieved by improved vehicle safety, driver training, and improved traffic management. In \nHunan, the Traffic Police, under the Hunan Public Security Bureau (HPSB), is responsible for \ninvestigating accidents and identifying preventive measures. The Traffic Police also makes \n                                                 \n1  The design speed of the expressway varies along the route with 62 km having a design speed of 100 km/hr and \nthe remaining 111 km having a design speed of 80 km/hr. \n ", "38 Appendix 6 \nsubstantial efforts to identify accident blackspots, to establish the causes and so to avoid similar \naccidents in the future. This work is coordinated with HCD when the causes are road related \nrather  than  driver  or  vehicle  related.    The  Hunan  Safety  Audit  for  Highway  Design  was \ndeveloped during the implementation of a World Bank funded project and has been used for all \nexpressways since 2000. Although the guidelines are comprehensive, it needs to strengthen the \nend of construction and pre-opening to traffic practice. Such audits should also involve the \nTraffic Police since this group will have the traffic safety responsibility after opening to traffic and \nmay  well  spot  different  safety  issues  from  their  practical  experience  of  operating  on  the \nexpressways. Such guidelines need to be more practical rather than theoretical and the audit \nstaff should be experienced accident or  safety personnel or have been involved in accident \ninvestigation. The international consultant will review the guidelines during the implementation \nof the Project expressway. \n \nC.  Organization and Action Plan \n \n4.  The organizations responsible for road safety and enforcement on the expressways in \nHunan are the HPSB and HCD. The Road Safety Committee of HPSB currently  implements \naccident  management  in  Hunan,  which  is  responsible  for  enforcement  of  traffic,  accident \nrecords, accident analysis, and identification of blackspots. An interdepartmental framework will \nbe established under the Project to enhance road safety in the project area. While HCD will \nconcentrate on the engineering, road safety audit,  and blackspot improvement, HPSB will \nundertake traffic law enforcement for safer expressways. A qualified team will be set to manage \ntraffic operations for the expressway. The local traffic police will be responsible for road safety of \nthe local roads. HPSB will assign a senior officer to coordinate the smooth implementation of \nthe Project. HCD will help develop a comprehensive road safety strategy in the project area, \nwith the help of an international road safety specialist. The strategy aims to improve road safety \nthrough: (i) institutional  strengthening, (ii) capacity building,  and (iii) enhanced coordination \namong various agencies.  \n \nD.  Vehicle Emissions \n \n5.  Motor vehicle emissions are a growing contributor to air pollution. The Government is \ntaking significant measures to control emissions by regulating the automobile industry, enforcing \nan annual vehicle test and inspection and maintenance program. The new measures also set \nemissions and fuel efficiency targets and offer tax incentives to encourage development of more \nenvironment friendly cars. In the new rule, it targeted that average fuel consumption will be \nreduced 15% points from 2003 to 2010. Hunan is developing alternative fuels that could help \nreduce  petroleum  imports.  A  300,000  ton  per  year  ethanol  plant  has  been  proposed  in \nChangde; it would use corn and other grains as feedstock. The Sichuan-Hunan gas pipeline \nproject is currently under construction. Natural gas will be provided for power generation, \nindustrial fuel, commercial and residential users, and transport. HCD and Hunan Environmental \nProtection  Bureau  (HEPB)  will  proceed  with  the  planning  for  a  vehicle  emissions  control \nimplementation plan. Implementing such a program will require the cooperative of a number of \nagencies,  jurisdictions,  and  the  community,  as  well  as  Government  commitment.  An \nimplementation plan will be developed to promote efficient vehicle emission reduction measures \nin the project area. An integrated approach may be adopted to facilitate the implementation of \nthe action plan.  A vehicle emissions specialist will be engaged to develop a comprehensive \nvehicle  emissions  action  plan,  including  enforcement  management,  prevention  measures, \nsocioeconomic costs, and major issues for the emission control programs.  ", "Appendix 7  39\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n \n1.  The 173-kilometer (km) project expressway and  3 interconnector roads (12 km) will \naffect 22 townships and 97 villages in 3 district or counties: Dingcheng, Taoyuan, and Yuanling. \nBased on the detailed measurement survey (DMS), the Project will permanently occupy about \n1,349 hectares (ha) of land, including 509 ha (38%) of cultivated land. About 30,564 people will \nlose some land.  The temporary use of land during construction will amount to  290 ha. The \nnumber of rural people whose houses will be demolished is 4,807 people (1,414 households), \nwith a total floor space of 225,139 square meters (m2). Some 1,607 persons in 5 schools and a \nforestry farm also require relocation. Land acquisition and resettlement impacts were minimized \nthrough consultations with local officials, aligning the expressway away from densely populated \nareas, and avoiding irrigated land and facilities. \n \nA.  The Resettlement Plan \n \n2.  The Resettlement Plan (RP) was prepared  by the Hunan Provincial Communications \nDepartment (HCD). The RP includes the project expressway, interconnector roads, and 517 km \nof existing local roads. The RP is based on the project preliminary study, and Hunan Design \nInstitute detailed design survey  data on impacts. The socioeconomic survey  covered 657 \nhouseholds from 72 villages, and 56 interviews of village representatives. The draft RP was \nreviewed by the affected people and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). HCD incorporated \ncomments into the RP. The RP and cost implications were finalized based on the DMS. \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Compensation \n \n3.  The resettlement objective is to ensure attainment of equal or better livelihoods and \nliving standards for people affected by the Project in line with the Land Administration Law \n(1998)  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  and  the  ADB\u2019s  policies  on  involuntary \nresettlement (1995) and indigenous people (1998). The RP is also based on the Implementation \nMeasures for the Land Administration Law of the PRC in  Hunan Province (2000) and the  \nHunan Provincial Government\u2019s Management Measures on Temporary Land Occupation. HCD \nwill ensure that any people losing land, housing, other assets, or other means of production will \nbe assisted in restoring their incomes and living standards to at least the levels without the \nProject\u2019s intervention. Lost assets will be replaced or compensated at replacement cost. The RP \nalso  stipulates  eligibility  and  entitlement  provisions  for  affected  people  and  provides \nrehabilitation  subsidies.  Permanent  land  losses  are  compensated  either  through  land \nreallocation within the villagers\u2019 group or through cash payments to the collective at rates of 8 \ntimes the average annual output value. Temporary land losses will be directly paid to the \nindividual  at  a  rate  stipulated  in  the  RP.  House  losses  will  be  paid  directly  in  cash  at \nreplacement cost, free of demolition expenses and salvaged materials. Crops and tree losses \nwill be directly paid in cash at rates. Each resettled household will also receive an allowance to \ncover transport costs, work loss, transfer costs, medical expenses, and temporary housing. \n \nC.  Relocation Site Development and Rehabilitation Assistance \n \n4.  The three options for residential resettlement site selection are (i) new housing sites will \nbe selected in the same village or land owning group for villages where only several households \nwill be relocated (light impact); (ii) a site suitable for clustered buildings will be selected if more \nhouseholds are involved in relocation, but enough land is available for their livelihood (moderate \nimpact); and (iii) relocation to towns with the permission from the  township government  for \nhouseholds that are engaged in nonfarm business. Along the Changji expressway, no structure \nloss is expected for enterprises. Five schools and one forestry farm will be affected, and general ", "40 Appendix 7 \nrelocation plans have been prepared. Since project impacts are spread over many village \ngroups,  the  degree  of  income  loss  is  not  serious.  Most  affected  people  prefer  cash \ncompensation for their land loss. Village groups will decide based on villagers\u2019 preference. \nConsequently, no village income rehabilitation plans are needed. But, initial rehabilitation plans \nhave been discussed for the 10 most seriously affected villages, and further consultation will be \nconducted on compensation disbursements. Relevant training will also be arranged for farmers \nwishing to expand their skills. Special assistance for vulnerable groups will be provided by the \nProject to secure their livelihood. \n \nD.  Stakeholder Participation, Disclosure of Resettlement Plan, and Grievances \n \n5.  At various stages of the project planning, the people affected by the Project have been \ninformed and consulted about the likely  project impacts. Stakeholders consulted include (i) \nheads of households to be affected, (ii) village heads and villagers\u2019 representatives, (iii) local \ngovernment  agencies  and  departments,  and  (iv)  women  and  other  vulnerable  groups. \nConsultations will continue through the project implementation period. HCD prepared the RP, \nwhich was discussed with local government and stakeholders for review and comments. HCD \nalso organized consultations in each affected district or  county. Consultations revealed full \nsupport for the Project. Some concerns raised during consultations have been addressed by \nadjusting the road design and by improving compensation and resettlement policy measures \nand entitlements. Resettlement information booklets have been distributed and discussed with \naffected villages and households. A working organization for resettlement consisting of officials \nfrom the Land Administration Bureau and related department will implement the RP. Claims will \nbe reviewed and resolved within 3 weeks. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements and Budget \n \n6.  The HCD is responsible on behalf of the Hunan Provincial Government for the general \nadministration of the project implementation and the monitoring of the work done by project \nimplementation agency to complete the project.  The Changji Expressway Construction and \nDevelopment Company (CECC) is responsible for resettlement implementation and supervision. \nA resettlement office has been established in  CECC, and others have been set up  in each \naffected district or county. This office will headed by a district leader and have 5\u20138 members \nfrom different government departments, usually 1 from each department of land administration, \nmunicipal  construction,  and  environment  protection.  Each  affected  township  will  have  a \nresettlement office and each village committee will appoint at least 1 person. Resettlement and \nland acquisition costs are estimated at CNY435 million ($52.5 million). The budget includes land \nand  buildings  compensation,  income  restoration  assistance,  repair  of  infrastructure, \nmanagement costs, monitoring, taxes, and contingencies. \n \n7.  CECC will carry out internal monitoring of land acquisition and resettlement to ensure \ntimely activities in accordance with the RP, and to protect the interest of those affected by the \nProject. The following will be monitored: (i)  compensation payments, (ii)  house rebuilding or \nrelocation of people affected, (iii) land redistribution, and (iv) grievance redress. CECC will \nprepare progress reports and submit them to ADB quarterly, until resettlement is completed. \nCECC  will  also  prepare  a  resettlement  completion  report  for  submission  to  ADB.  Hunan \nUniversity will carry out the external monitoring every 6 months in the first 2 years, and then \nannually for 2 years or until resettlement is deemed successful. Tasks include: (i) review and \nverification of the compensation payments; (ii) determination of the status of land acquisition \nand payments; (iii) assessment of the disbursement of compensation procedure; (iv) appraisal \nof the grievance procedure; (v) reaction and satisfaction of affected people with the entitlements \nand compensation; (vi) assessment of the restoration of livelihoods of affected people; and (vii) ", "Appendix 7  41\nlessons learned for future policy implementation, formulation, and planning.

The project expressway constitutes a 173 kilometer (km) section in the Changsha-\nChongqing corridor. It replaces the existing  road, NR319 (class II, III, and IV). The NR319 \npavement is in poor condition; 60% of its length suffers from frequent flooding. Traffic on NR319 \nis congested, due in part to local and nonmotorized traffic. The expressway will pass through \nTaoyuan in Changde City, Yuanling and Chenxi in Huaihua County, and Louxi and Jishou in \nXiangxi  Prefecture.  It  will  connect  Changde  and  Huaihua  cities  and  Xiangxi  Autonomous \nPrefecture in the west of Hunan with Changsha, Hubei, Chongqing Municipality, and Sichuan \nand Guizhou provinces. Traffic surveys were carried out by the Hunan Provincial Design \nInstitute. Sixteen-hour origin-destination surveys and associated 24-hour classified traffic counts \nwere done at 15 key locations along the existing NR319 and linking roads. Trucks make up 62% \nof all vehicles on NR319, and cars and buses only 38%. The nonmodeled traffic accounted for \n10% of total traffic. Over 80% of the vehicles make long distance trips of over 200km, and 16% \nhave both origin and destination within this area. \n \n2.  By  2008,  the  traffic  on  NR319  will  exceed  the  optimal  capacity  at  several  points, \nparticularly near Changde and on the class III and IV sections. By 2018, traffic on NR319 will be \nwell over capacity along its whole route. With the expressway, some additional traffic will be \ngenerated as a result of (i) additional trips made by existing users due to cheaper and quicker \njourneys; and (ii) trips made by others who, in the absence of the Project, were deterred from \nmaking them because of the prohibitive cost or time. Based on the feasibility study, additional \ntourism traffic is estimated at 1,263 medium-truck equivalent per day in 2008, rising to 2,475 in \n2028. Other generated traffic occurs due to reduced prices. Price elasticities were minus 0.4 for \npassengers and minus 0.3 for freight. Estimates were made on the present traffic volume on \nNR319, and the traffic volume likely to be either generated or diverted from NR319 as a result of \nthe  expressway.  Based  on  the  economic  growth  forecast  in  the  project  area,  the  traffic \nprojections consider (i) the traffic growth for the past 10 years, (ii) the probable generation of \ntraffic due to enhanced economic activities resulting from the expressway, (iii) the likelihood that \ntraffic will be diverted from NR319 once the expressway is opened, and (iv) origin-destination \nsurvey results. Traffic along the corridor increased at 7.3% per annum over the last 5 years. The \nfactor used to forecast traffic was income elasticity of traffic demand. Gross domestic product \ngrowth rates were projected at 8.4%, 7.1%, 6.5%, and 5.6% each for 2000\u201305, 2005\u201310, 2010\u2013\n20, and 2020\u201325.

The Project comprises the expressway that traverses the northwestern part of  Hunan \nand the local roads connected to the expressway through the road network system. The Project \nwill be implemented over 5 years. The economic analysis covers the following 20 years of full \noperation. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the project expressway was estimated \nby comparing the project case with a base case involving the continued use and maintenance of \nthe existing road, NR319. Without the Project, congestion levels would increase, causing delays \nand increasing vehicle operating cost (VOC); accident rates would also rise. The Project, with its \nshorter distance and travel time, safer design, and better running conditions, will reduce VOC \nand accident risks along the corridor. \n \nA.  Expressway Component \n \n2.  Economic evaluation was undertaken using 2004 prices. The project costs and benefits \nwere revalued at economic prices by separating the cost items into tradable materials and \nequipment, nontradable materials, labor, and land. The prices were expressed in yuan using the \ndomestic price numeraire with a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.01 for foreign exchange \neffects. A shadow price was used to put an economic value on the wages paid to unskilled labor, \nbut not on wages for skilled labor since no skilled worker surplus existed. A shadow wage rate \nfactor of 0.67 was used to convert the financial wage rate to an economic opportunity cost of \nlabor. The costs of the expressway include (i) the capital cost, including physical contingencies, \nland  acquisition,  and  resettlement;  and  (ii)  the  costs  of  operating  and  maintaining  the \nexpressway, including the costs of replacing depreciated equipment. In estimating the economic \ncosts of land, the approach described in The Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects \nwas followed.1 \n \n3.  The  economic  benefits  include  (i)  VOC  savings  resulting  from  the  reduced  travel \ndistance and improved road conditions, (ii) savings in the value of passenger time and of freight \ntied up in transit, (iii) savings resulting from fewer accidents,  and (iv) benefits to generated \ntraffic.2 A reduction of VOC is the main source of economic benefits in new or improved roads. \nThe expressway shortens the route between Changde and the border between Yuanling and \nLouxi by about  45 kilometers (km). Traffic diverting to the expressway would enjoy higher \nspeeds on a smoother road, with better vertical and horizontal alignment, less congestion, and a \nshorter journey distance. Traffic remaining on the alternative  NR319 route would also benefit \nfrom a reduction in traffic volume and congestion. All these changes affect vehicle speeds and \nVOC, which were estimated for all vehicle types likely to use the corridor. Savings in travel time \nwill occur both on the project expressway and the existing roads. User time savings were valued \nat the wage rate for crew and 30% of the hourly wage rate for passengers.3 The value of time-\nfor-work or business trips is assumed to be related more to urban incomes for cars and average \nregional incomes for buses.4 The economic cost per fatality was established using 2001 data \n                                                 \n1  The economic opportunity costs of land are assumed to be equivalent to the replacement value of farmland, which \nwas calculated for land compensation. Since these are rural areas, it was assumed that there is no additional \nopportunity cost for land.  \n2  Environmental benefits will also come from reduced vehicle emissions and noise, but these have not been included \nin the analysis for lack of a suitable evaluation methodology.  \n3  This is based on an assumed annual income of CNY14,000 for car passengers and CNY5,000 for bus passengers. \nFor people traveling in leisure time, the preferred method of valuation is willingness-to-pay for time saved. \nHowever, in the absence of local information on willingness-to-pay, this study bases the values on annual income. \n4  This resulted in an economic opportunity cost of CNY0.70 per hour for car passengers and CNY0.25 per hour for \nbus passengers. ", "Appendix 13  49\nwith estimates of the involvement of vehicle occupants and pedestrians at different levels of \nincome in fatalities on different classes of road.5 \n \n4.  The EIRR for the expressway component is estimated at 17.7%, indicating that the \nProject is economically viable, with a net present value of CNY3.6 billion. Of the total benefits, \n73.3% comprise VOC savings; 14.6%, savings in user time costs; 3.8%, accident cost savings; \n7.9%, benefits from generated traffic;  and 0.5%, savings in freight inventory costs in transit. \nSensitivity  analyses  confirm  the  robustness  of  its  economic  viability\u2014changes in the key \nvariables of construction costs, toll rates, and benefits do not significantly affect the economic \nviability. \n \nB.  Local Road Component \n \n5.  The principal benefits of the local road improvements have been identified as (i) VOC \nsavings to existing traffic and normal growth of future traffic on the improved roads, (ii) crop \nvalue-added  benefits  because  of  higher  farm-gate  prices  and  improved  access, and (iii) \ngenerated benefits from tourism development. Transport cost savings will accrue to normal \ntraffic on the improved roads through VOC. Currently farm-gate prices for fruits are low since \nonly traders with tractors or small trucks can visit the villages to purchase produce. Improved \nlocal roads would allow farmers to go to markets to sell their produce at higher prices, thus \nbenefiting the serviced communities with resulting farm-gate price increase. A local road section \nfrom Yuanling to Zhangjiajie, which will connect the  Zhangjiajie area with Yuanling, thereby \nspurring tourism in the project area, will benefit the rural people by increasing work opportunities \nsuch as catering services to tourists. Despite significant benefits of increased crop values and \ntourism development, these were not included in the EIRR calculation and only VOC savings \nwere estimated. The nine local roads have a combined EIRR of 20.1% per annum with a net \npresent value of CNY472 million.  \n \nC.  The Whole Project \n \n6.  Based on the combined economic cash flows over the period 2004 to 2027, the Project, \nas a whole, comprising the  174 km expressway and the  517 km of local road improvement \nprojects, generates an EIRR of 18.6%. This is relatively high, mainly because of the Project\u2019s \nlow construction costs and increased levels of traffic volume due to better road conditions. The \nVOC savings from the expressway tops the list of benefits, accounting for 66%, followed by \npassenger time savings at 14%. Accident cost savings, savings to generated traffic, and other \nbenefits are all comparatively small. The benefits of the local road component, while critically \nimportant to the villages concerned, also account for 10% of the total benefits (Table A13.1). \nThe results of the sensitivity analysis confirm the robustness of the Project\u2019s economic viability: \nchanges in the key variables\u2014construction costs, toll rates, and benefits\u2014do not significantly \naffect its viability, and the EIRR remains above the 12% threshold (Table A13.2). The level of \ntoll also affects the EIRR: the higher the toll, the less attractive is the expressway to users of the \nparallel road NR319 and hence the lower is the EIRR. The economic viability of the Project was \nfurther confirmed by a statistical distribution of the EIRR. With the uncertainties, the statistical \ndistribution of the EIRR concluded that (i) the expected EIRR for the whole Project is 18.6%, (ii) \nthe chance of an internal rate of return exceeding 12% is 98%, and (iii) the chance of an internal \nrate of return greater than 20% is 2%. \n                                                 \n5  On the basis of the findings of a study on accidents carried out by Highway Planning and Design Institute of the   \nMinistry of Communications in 1993, savings for reduced accidents were calculated using the national data for \n2001. The average direct cost of an accident was estimated at: CNY25,980 on expressways, CNY30,700 on class \nII roads, CNY29,390 on class III roads, and CNY26,230 on class IV roads.

General \n \n1.  The projected financial performance is based on the following assumptions and the pro \nforma financial statements are for 24 years from 2005 to 2028. All projections are in current \nterms. The domestic inflation rate is assumed at 2% for 2005, 3% for 2006, and 4% for 2007 \nonward. The international inflation rate used is 2.4% throughout the projection period. \n \nB.  Major Assumptions for Financial Projections \n \n2.   The project expressway financial projections are based upon the following assumptions: \n   \n(i)   Corporate income tax is assessed against the expressway operating entity at \n \n33% of net profit per year. \n \n(ii)   Government grants consist of equity capital of CNY369 million contributed by \nHunan  Provincial  Government  and  CNY880  million  by  the  Ministry  of \nCommunications. Both grants are included in the cost of construction. \n \n(iii)  The toll is based on vehicle size and types (small passenger vehicles, buses, \nsmall trucks, medium trucks, and large trucks including containers and trailers) \nand distance traveled. Toll-exempted vehicles (such as military, emergency, and \npublic security vehicles) are expected to make up about 5% of total traffic. The \nfee schedule will be updated regularly to reflect real price increase and domestic \ninflation.  Based  on  the  toll  rates  and  the  forecast  traffic  mix,  the  weighted \naverage  expressway  toll  rate  is  assumed  at  CNY0.99  per  medium-truck \nequivalent -kilometer (km) in the first operating year (2008). The analysis shows \nthat toll revenues from the average unit toll should be able to generate sufficient \nfunds to serve the repayment of the loan from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB). Traffic revenues will be generated from 2008 with annual traffic growth \nrates for 2008\u20132018 and 2019\u20132028 at 6.1% and 5.1%, respectively. Adequate \ntoll charges are very important for the financial viability of expressway projects. \nThe level of tolls must generate enough revenue to obtain the higher financial \nrate of return on investment, but not deter  potential  users  and  compromise \neconomic objectives. These objectives can be contradictory, because the former \nrequires a higher toll while the latter requires a lower one.  The proposed toll \ncharges for the expressway were carefully assessed, reflecting current average \ntolls in other expressways in Hunan:  \n \nTable A14.1: Toll Charges  \n(CNY per vehicle-km, 2004 prices) \n \nSmall Car  Bus  Light Truck  Medium Truck  Heavy Truck \n0.45  1.0  0.5  1.0  1.5 \nSource: Hunan Provincial Communications Department. \n \n(iv)   The  operating,  management,  and  maintenance  costs,  including  routine \nmaintenance are CNY47.5 million per year: CNY14 million per year for the \noperating  and  management  costs  and  CNY33.5  million  per  year  for  the \nmaintenance costs in 2004 prices. The operating and  management costs are ", "52 Appendix 14   \nbased upon the employment of one person per year per km to operate and \nmanage all the sections of the project roads and connector roads. Management \ncosts are estimated at CNY32,000 per year per 6 km for each management staff, \nat CNY40,000 per per year for each tolling staff, and at CNY40,000 per per km \nper year for each maintenance staff. For tunnel operations, CNY0.5 million per \nyear for tunnels less than 1 km and CNY2 million per year per km for tunnels \nlonger than 1 km were assumed. The maintenance costs have been estimated \non the basis of a unit rate of about CNY81,000 per year per kilometer. Operation \nand maintenance costs will increase in line with traffic growth and domestic \ninflation.  \n    \n(v)   For the life of the ADB loan, the currency is assumed as US dollar, and no \nconversion of interest, currency, rebate, or surcharge is assumed. ADB loan \nrepayment and domestic loan repayment will begin in 2010. The interest rate \ncharged on the ADB loan was estimated at 5.85% (based on the 2004 London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR) in US dollars and the  10-year swap cost for \nvariable to fixed interest rate). The interest rate on the domestic loan is 5.18%. \nThe domestic loan will have a 25-year term including a grace period of 5 years. \nThe commitment fee of 0.75% per year is included. \n \n(vi)  After 10 years of full operation, the expressway will be repaved. The repaving \ncost is estimated at CNY182 million in 2004 prices. It will be done during 1 year \nin 2019. Equipment (50%) will be replaced in 2024. \n \nC.  Financial Performance \n \n3.  The  projected  financial  statements  indicate  that  financial  revenues  under  the \nassumptions are sufficient to cover operation and maintenance costs, corporate taxes, debt \nrepayments on the ADB loan and the domestic loan, and reasonable profits.  Based on the \nfinancial project, operational efficiency is satisfactory and the debt service coverage ratio of \nmore than 1.0 is achievable from the third year of operation. The debt-to-equity ratio will be \nbelow 70:30 from the beginning year of the project operation. \n ", " Table A14.2: Projected Financial Statements For Changde-Huaihua Expresswaya\n(Current CNY million)\nProject Year 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 11 16 21 24\n2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2015 2020 2025 2028\nIncome Statement\nNet Operating Revenue 373 404 436 472 511 552 646 900 1,287 1,594\nOperating Expenses 144 145 146 147 148 149 152 157 164 168\nOperating Income   229 259 291 325 363 403 495 744 1,123 1,426\nLoan Interestb   0 291 283 274 265 246 185 106 46\nNet Profit Before Corporate Tax   229 259 0 42 88 138 249 558 1,017 1,380\nNet Profit After Corporate Tax 154 173 0 28 59 92 167 374 681 924\nCash Flow Statement\n   Net Cash from Operations 245 265 91 120 151 184 258 415 772 1,015\n   Hunan Provincial Government  55 113 154 59\n   MOC Grant 132 269 366 140\n   ADB Loanc 388 791 1,076 411\n   Domestic Bank Loan 396 808 1,099 420\nSubtotal Cash Inflows 971 1,981 2,694 1,275 265 91 120 150 184 258 464 772 1,015\n   Construction Costs 971 1,981 2,694 1,030\n   Debt Serviced  0 114 122 132 141 163 236 345 435\n   Principal Repayment\nSubtotal Cash Outflows 971 1,981 2,694 1,030 0 114 122 132 141 163 236 345 435\nNet Cash Flows 0 0 0 245 265 -23 -3 19 43 95 228 427 580\nBalance Sheet\nAccumulated Depreciation 91 183 274 366 457 548 731 1,185 1,692 1,963\n       Total Assets 971 2,952 5,646 6,830 7,003 6,889 6,795 6,722 6,674 6,654 7,070 8,295 9,604\nLiabilities\nBank Loans (SDB and ADB)e 784 2,382 4,557 5,388 5,388 5,274 5,152 5,020 4,879 4,565 3,542 2,054 844\nEquity Capital 187 569 1,089 1,288 1,288 1,288 1,288 1,288 1,288 1,288 1,288 1,288 1,288\n   Total Liabilities and Equity 971 2,952 5,646 6,830 7,003 6,889 6,795 6,722 6,674 6,654 7,070 8,295 9,604\nPerformance Indicators\nDebt to Equity Ratio 80.7 80.7 80.7 78.9 76.9 76.6 75.8 74.7 73.1 68.6 50.1 24.8 8.8\n  Debt Service Ratiof 0.94 0.99 1.05 1.11 1.23 1.54 1.86 2.21\nReturn on Investment 0.02 0.02 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.03 0.05 0.08 0.10\nADB = Asian Development Bank, CNY = Chinese yuan, MOC = Ministry of Communications, SDB = State Development Bank.

The  financial  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  for  the  Project  roads  is  based  on  estimated \nincremental revenues and costs resulting from its operation. The major assumptions include the \nfollowing. \n \n(i)  The FIRR calculation is in constant 2004 prices. They cover 24 years, comprising \nabout 4 years of construction (2005 to 2008) and 20 years of operation (2009 to \n2028). \n(ii)   The FIRR was calculated after corporate income tax. \n(iii)   Capital  costs  include  all  incremental  capital  expenditures  related  to  the \nconstruction and equipment of the project roads, but exclude local roads, price \ncontingency provisions, and interest during construction. \n(iv)   Operating costs, including management costs and maintenance costs, are all \nincremental costs for operation and management of the project expressway, but \nexclude depreciation provisions. \n(v)   Operating revenues were projected based on forecast traffic based on proposed \ntoll  rates  for  the  project  expressway  in  real  terms.  Toll  rates  are  regularly \nupdated, according to domestic inflation. The traffic volumes have taken into \naccount vehicles that are exempt from tolls, such as military, emergency, and \npublic security vehicles. \n(vi)  Periodic maintenance is assumed to take place in the tenth year of full operation \n(2019), at the constant cost of CNY182 million. \n(vii)  About a half of equipment will be replaced in the fifteenth year of full operation \n(2024). \n \n2.   The result of the financial evaluation for the project expressway shows an FIRR in real \nterms of 7.6% after corporate income tax (Table A15.1). This is higher than the real after tax \nweighted average cost of capital for the Project estimated at 4.4%. Sensitivity analysis of the \nfinancial return was carried out to test the effects of several scenarios on key parameters that \ndetermine costs and revenues. The Project is shown to be most sensitive to (i) capital costs, (ii) \nrevenue stream, and (iii) delay in completion. An increase of 20% in capital costs will reduce the \nFIRR to 6.0%; a decrease of 20% in revenues will reduce the FIRR to 4.9%; and a 1 year delay \nin construction reduces the FIRR to  7.0%. Under the most adverse scenario (capital costs \nhigher by 20%, and revenues lower by 20%), the FIRR would fall to 3.5% (Table A15.2).  \n \n3.  Adequate  toll  charges  are  very  important  for  the  financial  viability  of  expressway \nprojects. The level of tolls must generate enough revenue to obtain the higher financial rate of \nreturn on investment, but not deter potential users and compromise economic objectives.

An ethnic minorities development plan (EMDP) has been prepared to ensure equitable \nsharing of project benefits and to propose mitigation measures to adverse effects for ethnic \nminority  communities1 in  the  project  area.  Adequate  provisions  to  enhance  the  economic \nconditions of ethnic minorities are integrated in project design. Special mitigation measures are \nincluded in the resettlement plan, and will help ensure that ethnic minorities adversely affected \nby  resettlement  will  also  benefit  from  the  Project.  Government  policies  and  programs  for \nminorities further help protect and enhance project benefits.  \n \nB.  Socioeconomic Characteristics of Ethnic Minorities in the Project Area \n \n2.  The total minority population in project area is estimated at about 1.3 million. The Project \nwill directly benefit about 774,000 ethnic minorities. They make up 37% of beneficiaries of the \nexpressway and 54% of the local roads.  Ethnic minorities have limited access to transport \nservices  and  own  fewer  vehicles  due  to  road  classification,  government  regulations, \ninaccessible credit, or unreliability of transport services.  Road access among the  surveyed \nminority villages is as low as 57%, compared with 65% for the Han communities. An improved \nroad network in the project area will enable ethnic minority families to seek both social and \neconomic  opportunities.  About  8%  of  resettlement-affected  households  are  poor  ethnic \nminorities. The Bai, Miao, Tujia, and Yao make up 96% of the total minority populations in the \nwestern section of the project  area. Levels of  education and artisan skills  differ for  minority \nnationalities within the project area. There is little gender disparity in school enrollment rates at \nthe primary level due to education programs and overall socioeconomic growth. However, few \nminority women have artisan skills for income-generation activities due to a lack of access to \ntechnology services.  \n  \nC.  Legal Framework and Principles \n \n3.  The EMDP for the Project is based on regulations of the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC) and Asian Development Bank (ADB) policy for indigenous people. The Government \nadopted a policy of ethnic equality post-1949 where all groups are legally and constitutionally \nequal. Since the 1980s governments of autonomous areas have set and implement their own \neconomic policy. Current government policies and programs for minority nationalities further \nhelp to enhance project benefits to ethnic minority groups.  ADB policy aims to protect ethnic \nminorities from the adverse impacts of development, and to ensure that ethnic minorities benefit \nfrom development projects and programs. The Project fully mainstreams ethnic minorities\u2019 \nconcerns into its design, as they are considered one of the primary beneficiaries. Specific \nactivities are incorporated into the proposed transport interventions to ensure that minorities \nshare proportionately in project benefits (Table A16). Local road improvement is a response to \nthe  development  needs  of  ethnic  minorities.  Significant  project  impacts  include expanded \ntourism  development,  higher  farm-gate prices  for  agricultural  goods,  increased  access  to \nmarkets and employment opportunities, and improved social services. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n4.  Implementation arrangements and associated costs for the EMDP have been integrated \ninto  the  overall  project  arrangements,  or  are  part  of  ongoing  government  programs. \n                                                 \n1  Ethnic minority groups refer to those groups that are different from the majority ethnic group, e.g., the Han. Post-\n1949 policy defines nationalities (minzu) based on shared language, territory, economic base, and traditions and \nculture.  ", "Appendix 16  57\nResettlement  assistance  of  CNY8  million  is  budgeted  for  vulnerable  households  in  the \nresettlement plan. Data will be disaggregated by ethnic group and by gender where available. \nExternal monitoring will be conducted by an independent domestic agency. The ADB midterm \nreview will pay special attention to the implementation of the EMDP.  \n \nTable A16: Ethnic Minorities Action Plan \n \nProposed  Agencies  Funding \nTargets  Timing  Monitoring Indicators \nActions   Involved  Requirements \nImproved  Rural poor HHs in 28  IA, local  2004\u2013 Project local  Investment in local roads \ntransport   townships.

No    No \nagreement?   \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC):  \n \nThe Project will contribute through improved access to markets and social services for the poor; lower transport costs of \nagricultural inputs and products; better access to and interaction with other regions, and employment opportunities during \nconstruction and after completion owing to increased economic activities. The expressway will help accelerate economic \ngrowth, spur interregional trade, and reduce poverty in the project area. To maximize the benefits of the expressway to \nthe poor, the local road component was integrated into the Project. The integrated approach will improve the rural poor\u2019s \nmobility and road access to economic opportunities, and thereby contribute to poverty reduction. Better tie-ins between \nthe major roads and local roads will help rural agricultural products reach markets and allow farmers to upgrade farming \npractices. As reliable transport to markets becomes more readily available, cash-crop farming in remote or isolated areas \nwill also be stimulated and the access to off-farm employment opportunities, broadened. \n \n \nB.

It has a total population of 2.8 million, with the per capita \nannual income of CNY1,660 in 2001. Of 2.3 million rural people, some 56% have annual incomes below CNY900. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nParticipation during project preparation: Hunan Provincial Communications Department (HCD) undertook socioeconomic \nsurveys and public meetings, which raised the level of awareness, gained local support, and enabled stakeholders to \nvoice opinions and suggestions for project design and implementation. The participatory approach was initiated during \nproject design, and is an ongoing activity that will continue during project implementation. The poor and women have \nbeen carefully considered in the conduct of participatory activities. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nFor the selection of unskilled labor in the project area, the contractors will discuss opportunities with villagers in the \nvicinity of the expressway alignment, and train them as necessary. During the selection of the expressway alignment, \nleaders of the affected villages were consulted in order to minimize the loss of irrigated land and housing. For the local \nroad component, the local villages will provide unskilled labor at market wage rates. Local communities will participate in \nthe project benefit monitoring. Some community-based organizations may be involved in the implementation of the village \neconomic rehabilitation component of the Resettlement Plan (RP), and in activities related to the ethnic minorities \ndevelopment plan (EMDP). \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nWomen will not be adversely affected by the Project, as they will gain many project benefits.

Initial poverty and social analysis undertaken during technical assistance (TA) fact-\nfinding identified key poverty and social issues to be analyzed during project preparation. Based \non the findings, a poverty and social analysis was carried out to ensure that the Project meets \nsafeguard  policy  requirements  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  involuntary \nresettlement and indigenous peoples. \n \n2.  With the expressway, the journey time between Changde and Huaihua will be cut by 2\u20133 \nhours. By lowering transport costs and travel time along the corridor, the Project will improve the \navailability of daily necessities in the local markets and villages nearby its interchanges, and \nimprove the access to markets and income-generating opportunities. Poor farmers will earn \nhigher profit margins  owing to  lower transport costs. Migration,  an important  cash income \nsource for rural people, will increase  with the better  access to other cities and provinces. \nIncreased tourists to the Golden Tourism Triangle Area with improved roads will bring significant \nadvantages to the poor in Yuanling and Fenghuang counties. Some 1.9 million people (66% of \nthe total population, of whom 42% are ethnic minorities) will directly benefit from the Project. \nHalf of 1.3 million rural beneficiaries are poor, while 15% of 573,000 urban beneficiaries are \npoor. Some 774,000 ethnic minorities will benefit from the Project\u2014about 33% are urban and \n46% are rural (Table A17.1).
