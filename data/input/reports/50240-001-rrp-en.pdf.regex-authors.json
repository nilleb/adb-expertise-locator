THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan, \nand (ii) a proposed grant, both to Solomon Islands for the Tina River Hydropower Project.1  \n \n2.  The project will support the development of renewable energy to supply electricity to \nHoniara, the capital of Solomon Islands. The project will reduce the cost of power supply \ngeneration by replacing diesel power with hydropower, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It \nis estimated that, following the project, hydropower will generate 68% of Honiara\u2019s electricity. \nTransaction technical assistance was used in project preparation.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Solomon Islands has the fourth-largest economy among ADB\u2019s 15 Pacific developing \nmember countries, with a gross domestic product of just over $1 billion in 2016. However, annual \nper capita income is less than $1,800. Having withstood the impacts of the global financial and \neconomic crises, the economy grew by an average of 6.6% in 2008\u20132011, driven by expansions \nin logging output and mineral extraction. Growth has since dropped to an average of just 2.6%, \nand is expected to remain low in the near term. The country\u2019s longer term prospects depend on \nthe  development  of  more  sustainable  drivers  of  growth,  including  tourism  and  commercial \nservices. This will need to be underpinned by a stable and reliable energy supply. \n \n4.  High tariffs from over-reliance on diesel power generation. Grid-connected electricity \nin Solomon Islands is generated and supplied by Solomon Power, a state-owned electricity utility \ncompany. Solomon Power provides electricity to the capital Honiara and eight isolated provincial \ncenters on separate islands.3 Solomon Islands has a total population of 616,000, more than 10% \nof whom live in Honiara.4 Honiara has an installed electricity generation capacity of 34 megawatts \n(MW). Peak load on the Honiara grid is growing, having increased from 9.3 MW in 2003 to 15.8 \nMW in 2018. Solomon Power\u2019s electricity supply relies almost entirely on diesel generation. The \ncost to Solomon Power of generating power from diesel decreased from $0.36 per kilowatt-hour \n(kWh) in 2014 to $0.26/kWh in 2018, mainly due to a decline in diesel prices. Similarly, retail tariffs \npaid by the consumer fell from $0.93/kWh in 2014 to $0.65/kWh in 2016, due in part to declining \ndiesel prices and tariff reform.5 The high cost of electricity generation is negatively impacting \neconomic growth, particularly in the commercial and tourism sectors. \n \n5.  Low access. Electricity access in Solomon Islands is low. Approximately 9% of the \ncountry\u2019s population have access to grid-connected electricity, and another 2% rely on self-\ngenerated power. The access rate is 64% in urban Honiara, and 3% in rural areas. About one-\nthird of all households have small solar home systems. To improve access rates, Solomon Power \nis (i) extending the grid within Honiara, with financing support from the World Bank;6 (ii) converting \n                                                \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 ADB. 2016. Technical Assistance to Solomon Islands for Tina River Hydropower Project. Manila (TA 9305-SOL).  \n3 The current tariff setting mechanism allows Solomon Power to operate at full cost recovery without subsidies.  \n4 Government of Solomon Islands, Ministry of Finance and Treasury. 2015. Solomon Islands 2012/13 Household \nIncome and Expenditure Survey National Analytical Report. Volume 1. Honiara. \n5 In 2016, the World Bank funded the development of a new tariff regulation that came into effect in January 2017.  \n6 Solomon Islands Sustainable Energy Project. The increased power supply from the Tina River Hydropower Plant will \nexpand residential access to the Honiara grid in the medium term.  \n ", "2 \nprovincial grids to renewable energy with support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB);7 and \n(iii) establishing renewable energy mini-grids in larger villages, partially supported by the World \nBank and Government of New Zealand. \n \n6.  Least-cost  development  and  tariff  reduction.  Solomon  Power\u2019s  least-cost  power \nexpansion plan recommends the construction of the Tina River Hydropower Plant supported by \nthe  expansion  of  solar  power  generation.8 This  will  drive  tariffs  down  by  replacing  diesel \ngeneration with least-cost renewable energy. Tariff reductions will boost Honiara\u2019s economic \ndevelopment and lower power costs for households. The plan estimates that, with the construction \nof the plant, retail tariffs paid by consumers will decline to $0.33/kWh by 2023, compared to \n$0.51/kWh without the project. The plant will also provide suitable baseload power to facilitate the \nincreased penetration of intermittent solar power in the Honiara grid. With the commissioning of \nthe plant and proposed solar investments, the extent of renewable energy integration is expected \nto grow from 1% in 2016 to 85% in 2022 (68% from the plant and 17% from solar). The reduced \nuse of diesel will significantly reduce Solomon Islands\u2019 greenhouse gas emissions.   \n \n7.  Public\u2013private partnership. The project has been developed under a public\u2013private \npartnership.9 A special project company (SPC) will be established to design, build, own, operate, \nand manage the plant. The SPC will undertake the construction of the hydropower facility through \na build\u2013operate\u2013own\u2013transfer scheme, and it will be capitalized with equity investment from the \nconsortium of the Korea Water Resources Corporation (K-Water) and Hyundai Engineering \nCorporation Limited (HEC). The SPC will enter into a 34-year power purchase agreement (PPA) \nwith state-owned Solomon Power, which will purchase power on a net availability basis under a \n34-year implementation agreement with the government. Through the government guarantee \nagreement (GGA), the government will guarantee Solomon Power\u2019s payment obligations to the \nSPC. To maintain the project\u2019s financial viability and lower the tariff, the government is securing \nconcessional financing from multilateral and bilateral development partners that will be onlent to \nthe SPC.10  \n \n8.  Project readiness. The project\u2019s technical design is complete and has been reviewed by \nan independent panel of technical experts. Extensive topographic, geotechnical, geological, \nenvironmental, social, and hydrological site surveys have been undertaken. The land required for \nthe project was under customary ownership, and the clear land title has been secured following \nconsiderable consultation and negotiation. The PPA was signed on 6 December 2018 and will \nbecome effective once conditions precedent are met.11 Financial close is currently targeting 5 \nDecember 2019. \n \n9.  Alignment with development plans. The project supports the operational priorities of \nADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  by  (i)  addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities;  (ii)  \naccelerating progress in gender equality; and (iii) tackling climate change, building climate and \ndisaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability.12It will contribute to Sustainable \n \n                                                \n7 ADB. 2016.

Least Cost Modelling of Future Generation Expansion for the Honiara Electricity \nSystem. 19 December. This report includes demand projections for the Honiara grid, including a sensitivity analysis.  \n9 The government and International Finance Corporation (IFC) explored alternative PPP models, particularly given the \ngovernment\u2019s large commitment to secure concessional financing, and the proposed model was considered optimal.   \n10 Financial modeling indicates that the project would not be financially viable at commercial lending rates.  \n11 The following documents are currently being finalized: (i) the implementation agreement; (ii) the engineering, \nprocurement, and construction (EPC) contract; (iii) the operation and maintenance (O&M) contract; and (iv) the GGA. \n12 ADB. 2018.

The project is in line with the objectives of ADB\u2019s 2009 Energy Policy to promote renewable \nenergy.13 The project is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Solomon Islands, \n2019-2021.14 The project supports the Solomon Islands National Development Strategy, 2016\u2013\n2035 to promote private sector and renewable energy.15  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact will be improved economic conditions for Honiara in line with the Solomon \nIslands  National  Development  Strategy,  2016\u20132035.  The  outcome  will  be  the  increased \ngeneration of renewable energy on the Honiara grid.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n11.  The project\u2019s output will be the Tina River Hydropower Plant constructed. The SPC will \ndevelop, design, finance, construct, operate, maintain, and transfer a 15 MW hydropower plant \non the Tina River.  \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n12.  The project is estimated to cost $233.37 million (Table 1).16 Detailed cost estimates by \nexpenditure category and financier are included in the project administration manual (PAM). \n \nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates  \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

An independent cost \nestimator engaged by Solomon Power verified the proposed bill of quantities and EPC price breakdown, which was \nfound to be adequate given the reasonable level of profit.   \n ", "4 \n13.  The government has requested a concessional loan of $18 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year \nthereafter; and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft  loan and project \nagreements. The government has also requested a grant not exceeding $12 million from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources (the Asian Development Fund) to help finance the project. Concessional \nfinancing is also being provided by the Government of Australia ($11.70 million), Green Climate \nFund ($86.00 million), Abu Dhabi Development Fund ($15 million), Export-Import Bank of Korea \n($31.60 million), and the World Bank ($31.20 million). The World Bank will administer funding \nfrom  the  Green  Climate  Fund  and  Government  of  Australia.  Funding  from  Abu  Dhabi \nDevelopment Fund, ADB, Export-Import Bank of Korea and World Bank (including administered \nfunds) will be provided directly to the government as parallel financing.17 ADB will not administer \nany cofinancing. The government will finance the remainder of the total project cost ($17.07 \nmillion), for the construction of transmission lines. K-Water and HEC will provide equity of $10.80 \nmillion, and will enter into the GGA, whereby the government will guarantee payment obligations \nunder the PPA between the SPC and Solomon Power.18 \n \n14.  Concessional loan financing from various sources will be onlent to the SPC, through a \nsubsidiary lending agreement, on the same terms and conditions as provided by the various \nfinanciers to the government, with a 0.1% add-on to the onlending rate. Grants will be passed \nthrough as grants to the SPC.

ADB has agreed with this approach.   \n \n ", "5 \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The Ministry of Finance and Treasury will be the executing agency and the Ministry of \nMines, Energy, and Rural Electrification will be the implementing agency19. The Tina River \nHydropower Project Office (TRHPO) has been established under the Ministry of Mines, Energy, \nand Rural Electrification since 2010. The TRHPO will act as the project management unit. Funding \nsupport for the TRHPO has been provided to date through the Government of Australia and World \nBank, who have allocated a further $7 million grant to support it.20 ADB has reviewed the proposed \nsupport and considers it adequate to supervise and monitor project implementation. No additional \nADB support for the TRHPO is proposed at this stage. A project steering committee has been \nestablished  to review  project  progress, coordinate  inter-ministerial  activities,  and  guide the \nTRHPO. Co-financiers will develop a memorandum of understanding setting out coordination \nrequirements. A coordination mechanism will be established for reporting and sharing information \nbetween the government and development partner financiers. The implementation arrangements \nare summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM.21 ADB will be jointly financing the \nEPC contract with cofinancing sources.

The SPC has entered into a PPA with Solomon Power covering a 34-year period \n(including a 5-year construction period). At the end of the implementation agreement and PPA (in \n                                                \n19 ADB Office of Public Private Partnerships is providing capacity support to Ministry of Finance and Treasury to \nmanage co-financier fund flows and finalize conditions precedent.  \n20 Support will include consultants to (i) monitor overall project implementation; (ii) provide capacity building and \nawareness training for various stakeholders; (iii) monitor environmental and social safeguards, and implement plans, \nincluding environmental and social impact assessments and land acquisition and livelihood restoration plans, as well \nas independent safeguard monitoring agents; (iv) monitor the implementation of the gender action plan; (v) maintain \na dam safety advisory panel; and (vi) help communities utilize project benefits for community development.

Manila. \n \n ", "6 \n2054), the project ownership will be transferred to the government. The PPA includes provisions \nfor the transfer of the plant in a specified condition at the PPA\u2019s conclusion and for capacity \nbuilding to enable the government to take over management effectively.23 The PPA tariff is based \non plant availability, regardless of water availability, meaning that Solomon Power takes the \nhydrology risk.    \n \n17.  Engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) and operation and maintenance \n(O&M) contracts. The SPC will engage an EPC contractor (expected to be HEC) to construct \nthe Tina River Hydropower Plant and access road under an EPC contract.24 SPC will engage an \nowners engineer to supervise the EPC contract,25 and the SPC will engage a contractor (expected \nto be K-Water) to operate and maintain the plant and access road. Solomon Power will be \nresponsible for procuring contractors to construct the transmission line. Drafts of the EPC and \nO&M contracts have been negotiated, but have yet to be finalized.  \n \n18.  Land lease agreement. The land for the plant has been acquired, and the land title is \nnow with the lands commissioner on behalf of the government. The government is currently \nestablishing the Tina Core Land Company and will allocate 50% of the company\u2019s shares to the \noriginal landowners. The SPC will then enter into a land lease agreement with the company.26  \n \n19.  Selection of the concessionaire. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) acted as \ntransaction advisor and helped the government select the concessionaire. ADB\u2019s involvement in \nthe project was requested following the completion of the concessionaire selection. The World \nBank conducted a procurement due diligence and endorsed the concessionaire selection; and \nthe World Bank Board of Directors approved project financing in June 2017. To accommodate \nthe government\u2019s request to finance the project in part, ADB conducted a detailed post-review of \nthe concessionaire selection to ensure that procurement was undertaken in a manner consistent \nwith the core procurement principles of economy, efficiency, transparency, and fairness as \noutlined in ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015 as amended from time to time). The review \nconfirmed that this was the case. ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines for a build\u2013operate\u2013own\u2013\ntransfer project stipulate that the concessionaire should be selected in a transparent manner, \npreferably through competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB. Eligible bidders were \nprovided with the same information and equal opportunity to compete in the bidding. There was \nadequate transparency in the multi-stage selection process, which commenced with a request for \nexpressions of interest in 2011 and was republished in 2014, followed by a prequalification phase \nin 2014 during which two submissions were received. Following the withdrawal of one consortium, \nthe government proceeded to develop the project on a single bidder process based on a modified \nrequest for proposal. The selected concessionaire is a joint venture comprising two firms from \nADB member countries, and the arrangement does not place any restriction on the origin of goods \nto be supplied under the EPC contract. Neither the joint venture nor the firms constituting it are \nsubject to ADB sanctions. The government and World Bank confirmed that no representation or \ncomplaint was received about the concessionaire selection.  \n \n                                                \n23 The PPA was prepared with inputs from the IFC\u2019s technical and legal advisors and was signed on 5 December 2018, \nwith PPA close scheduled within 12 months of signing. The execution of implementation agreement, land lease \nagreement, EPC contract, and GGA are conditions precedent to closing under the PPA. \n24 The EPC contract will be a fixed price contract, with the EPC contractor taking construction-related geological risk.  \n25 The owners engineer will verify construction progress to support withdrawal applications to ADB against milestone \npayments in the EPC contract.  \n26 The government will not commence the establishment of the Tina Core Land Company until all landowners have \naccepted the negotiated payment.  \n \n ", "7 \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n \n20.  The technical  design  of  the  proposed  hydropower  plant  has  been  reviewed  and  is \nconsidered technically viable27. Alternative sites for the plant within the catchment were assessed \nand the current site is considered optimal. The TRHPO prepared the feasibility study with \ntechnical support from the World Bank and Government of Australia. Based on the feasibility \nstudy, K-Water submitted a proposed design that was reviewed by the World Bank dam safety \nadvisory panel and modified based on their comments. The advisory panel will continue to provide \nguidance during detailed design, construction, reservoir filling, and operation of the plant. IFC \ntechnical advisors supported the preparation of the minimum functional specifications (contained \nin the PPA) which ensure the plant will be constructed to international standards. The PPA also \ncontains O&M requirements, including plant condition requirements during the transfer of the plant \nto the government. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n21.  Economic. The project is economically feasible with an economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR) estimated at 9.3%, slightly above the economic opportunity cost of capital (EOCC) of 9%. \nA sensitivity analysis was conducted to test the robustness of the project\u2019s economic viability \nagainst (i) a 20% increase in capital costs, (ii) a 20% increase in O&M costs, (iii) a 20% decline \nin diesel prices, and (iv) a 1-year delay in operation. The project\u2019s EIRR falls below the minimum \nrequired EIRR of 9% in 3 of the 4 scenarios considered. The largest potential reduction in \neconomic viability occurs in a scenario with a substantial capital cost overrun. A 20% increase in \ncapital costs reduces the Project\u2019s EIRR to 7.8%. The switching value confirms that any capital \ncost overrun over 3.8% would cause the Project\u2019s EIRR to fall below the EOCC. Further, a one-\nyear delay in realizing Project benefits also reduces the EIRR to 8.8%. The results show that the \nproject\u2019s  economic  viability  may  be  sensitive  to  adverse  shocks.  However,  the  project  is \nconsidered economically viable given that risks are mitigated by robust project preparation and \nthe conservative estimation of benefits, and substantial economic benefits remain unquantified.  \n \n22.  Financial. The project\u2019s financial viability was examined by comparing incremental costs \nand benefits in the with- and without-project scenarios. The real weighted average cost of capital \n(WACC) for the SPC is 2.06%. The financial internal rate of return based on the expected \ncashflows is 4.71%, which exceeds the WACC. Financially, the project is viable. The sensitivity \nanalysis reveals that the financial internal rate of return remains above the WACC under such \nadverse scenarios as a 10% increase in operating costs, 10% increase in investment cost and 2-\nyear implementation delay.  \n \nC.  Governance \n \n23.  Financial management. A financial management assessment has not been completed \non the SPC as it has yet to be fully established. Financial management systems will be established \nand operated by K-Water. A desk review of K-Water and HEC indicated that K-Water is a large \nprogressive company with operations in several countries in partnership with various development \npartners, and that HEC has a robust corporate structure and solid financial performance. K-Water \nand HEC both have advanced financial management systems. Project development under a \n                                                \n27 The hydropower plant will include (i) a 72-meter (from foundation) roller compacted concrete dam, (ii) a 3.3-kilometer \nheadrace tunnel (3.3 meters in diameter), (iii) a surge shaft and steel penstock (3 meters in diameter), and (iv) a \npowerhouse with three 5 MW Francis turbines. \n ", "8 \npublic\u2013private partnership model is a sustainable model due to the lack of capacity within \nSolomon Islands to own and operate the hydropower plant.  \n \n24.  Anticorruption measures. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n25.  The project design includes pro-poor and poverty reduction measures, such as engaging \nlow-income households (including landowners) for construction works. The project will place \ndownward pressure on electricity tariffs which will improve affordability of electricity and reduce \nhousehold expenditure on electricity. The project will comply with applicable national labor laws \nand core labor standards, including, but not limited to, equal work for equal pay regardless of \ngender, race, or ethnicity, and excluding child labor. The TRHPO will implement the poverty \nreduction measures.  \n \n26.  The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. A gender action plan has \nbeen developed based on a gender analysis and community consultations. The plan includes \nspecific measures related to the construction of the hydropower plant and ensuring long term \ncompensation benefits are directed to women. Measures include (i) women\u2019s engagement in \nconsultation activities, (ii) gender awareness training for target groups, (iii) increased women\u2019s \nparticipation in project-related contracts, (iv) ensuring compensation is payed directly to women\u2019s \nbank accounts, and (v) community development activities from ongoing lease payments which \nbenefit women.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n27.  Environment. The project has been classified as category A for the environment following \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).28 An environment and social impact assessment has \nbeen prepared and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. Aquatic and terrestrial flora and fauna and habitat \nsurveys  and  impact  assessments  were  conducted,  and  project-affected  communities  were \nconsulted  extensively.  The  main  potential  environmental  impacts  during  construction  are \nincreased sedimentation, the inundation of 30.5 hectares (ha) of the reservoir, the removal of 115 \nha of modified and natural habitat, and minor impacts on fauna. The main potential impacts during \noperation are induced impacts on terrestrial flora and fauna from increased human access to the \nupper catchment, and impacts on aquatic fauna due to reduced water flow in the bypassed river \nsection. The SPC will prepare and implement a biodiversity management plan targeting no net \nloss of biodiversity for identified species, including an offset program to rehabilitate modified \nhabitat. The project design includes an environmental flow of 1 cubic meter per second in the \nbypassed river section. The SPC will update the environmental and social impact assessment, \nenvironmental and social management plan, and other management plans as required in the \nenvironmental and social impact assessment. The TRHPO will monitor and supervise compliance \nwith the approved environmental and social management plan during construction.29 A climate \nchange  risk  evaluation  was  conducted  and  the  findings  considered  in  the  project  design. \nAdaptation measures include an increase in the spillway size to address anticipated increase flood severity, \nand improved catchment monitoring to predict flooding. \n \n                                                \n28 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n29 The TRHPO will have dedicated international and national environment staff to support monitoring and reporting.  \n ", "9 \n28.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The project is classified as category \nA for resettlement and category C for indigenous peoples following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement.  The  government  has  acquired  428.8  ha  of  customary  land  for  key  project \ninfrastructure. The project will have an economic impact on tribal landowner groups and users \nmainly due to a lack of access to commercial timber and non-timber resources, although there \nwill be no physical displacement. ADB confirmed that the land acquisition processes for the core \nland meet the safeguard policy requirements of the government and ADB. The benefits package \nincludes royalties and the establishment of a benefit-sharing mechanism. Approximately 32.6 ha \nof private land has yet to be acquired for a power transmission corridor. A land acquisition and \nlivelihoods restoration plan will provide compensation and benefits to affected persons, and the \nplan has been disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. Although the Policy on Indigenous Peoples has not \nbeen triggered, all necessary measures to minimize adverse impacts on tribal communities are \nconsistent with ADB requirements. The SPC will implement a community development plan, \noverseen by TRHPO and supported by safeguard specialists.  \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Management Plan \n \n29.
