An initial environmental examination was undertaken. \nAssessment  The  summary  initial  environmental  examination  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix B. \n   \nProject Description  The  emergency  assistance  loan  will  rehabilitate  public \ninfrastructure that was damaged by torrential rains and flooding \nthat  occurred  over  the  Fiji  Islands  in  January  2009.  The \nrehabilitation  includes  main  and  rural  roads\u2014it  involves \nstabilization of landslides, resurfacing, reconstruction of culverts, \nand repairs and improvements to wet crossings. The Project will \nalso  rehabilitate  agricultural  drainage  schemes  and  water \nsupplies. Design and construction will incorporate climate proofing \nto  the  extent  economically  feasible.  The  Project  will  be \nimplemented under a sector approach. \n   \nRationale  Equitable economic growth and improvement in social and health \nindicators  depend  on  maintaining  the  rural  economy.  The \ndamaged transport network is a constraint to the movement of \npeople and goods, a disincentive to productive rural activity, and \nan  impediment  to  the  recovery  and  growth  of  tourism.  Better \ntransport infrastructure and services, which would restore access \nto domestic and international markets for agricultural products, are \nnecessary to rehabilitate rural economies in the affected areas. \nRestoring rural accessibility will reduce poverty. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact will be reduced economic losses and social disruption \nfrom  extreme  weather  in  the  future.  The  outcome  will  be  the \nrestoration of economic and social activities in affected areas to \npre-disaster  levels.  The  rehabilitation  of  damaged  roads  is \nexpected to restore accessibility to rural areas and allow a full \nresumption of economic activities and social services. Restoration \nof water supplies will safeguard public health. \n   ", "ii   \nProject Investment Plan   The Project is estimated to cost $19.99 million, including taxes \nand duties of $4.50 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan    Total  Share of \nSource  ($ million)  Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank  17.56  87.8 \nGovernment of the Fiji Islands  2.43  12.2 \nTotal    19.99  100.0 \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \n  A loan of $17.56 million from the ordinary capital resources of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) will be provided under ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of the Fiji Islands for the Emergency Flood Recovery (Sector) Project. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Overview \n2.  The Fiji Islands experienced continuous and heavy rain from 8 to 15 January 2009 that \nincluded periods of exceptional intensity. Flash flooding affected many areas of the Fiji Islands, \nparticularly the northwest of the main island of Viti Levu. Areas severely affected were the \nSigatoka valley, Nadi town and surrounding areas, Ba, Rakiraki, Nausori, Taileveu North, and \nparts of Vanua Levu. The extent and depth of flooding in Nadi and Ba was the worst since 1931. \nAbout 150,000 people (roughly one-sixth of the population) were affected directly or indirectly \nthrough disruption of communications and access to food and clean water. Affected areas \nsuffered damage to roads, schools, medical facilities, water and sanitation facilities, and crops. \nCommercial enterprises were particularly badly hit in Nadi and Ba, the former being the gateway \nfor tourism in the Fiji Islands. Tourism growth, already under pressure because of the global \nfinancial and economic crises, is expected to be impeded. Similarly, damage to sugarcane will \nreduce the quantity of sugar for export, further constraining the economy. \n \n3.  An emergency response by the Government and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) \n(with  widespread  support  from  the  international  community)  provided  short-term  food  and \nshelter to more than 11,000 people. While many houses suffered flood damage, few were \ndestroyed.  Most  people  were  able  to  return  to  their  homes  once  the  floods  had  abated. \nHowever, subsistence and market crops were extensively damaged and longer-term provision \nof food rations was needed, particularly in the rural areas where reliance on root crops for daily \nneeds was high. Hardship in the rural areas was compounded by damage to rural roads, \nrestricting access to markets and social services. The floods have had a disproportionate impact \nupon the poor and are exacerbating growth, poverty and social indicators in Fiji. \n \n4.  The  Government  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  which  has  long \nexperience and ongoing projects in the infrastructure sector in the Fiji Islands, to prepare an \nemergency assistance project for reconstruction of damaged roads, bridges, water systems, \nand other public infrastructure.  \n \nB.  Damage and Impact Assessment \n5.  The Government published its Consolidated Report on Flash Floods1 on 17 February \n2009, about 4 weeks after the disaster. The report brought together the damage and loss \nassessments of all Government agencies. The report estimated rehabilitation and reconstruction \ncosts for public infrastructure (and including assets belonging to the Fiji Electricity Authority, Fiji \nTelecom, and the Fiji Sugar Corporation) to be about $41 million. Damage and consequential \nlosses were not separately estimated in the report, though needs of $36 million were identified \nfor consideration by development partners. Of this amount, $9 million is for proposed river \ndredging work, which is longer-term development, rather than a requirement for emergency \nrehabilitation of essential infrastructure. The assessment did not include private sector losses. \n                                                 \n1  Office of the Prime Minister. 2009. Consolidated Report on Flash Floods. 8\u201316 January 2009. Suva. ", "2 \nBusiness losses in the commercial centers were considerable with shops submerged for several \ndays. The economic cost, public and private, of the flooding is estimated to be about $180 \nmillion\u2014equivalent  to  5.3%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP).2  The  damage  to  essential \ninfrastructure  and  to  productive  sectors  such  as  tourism,  and  sugar  and  other  crops  was \nsubstantial. \n \n6.  The extra demands on the budget over the rest of the year could result in a budget \ndeficit for 2009 exceeding 4% of GDP, above the projected deficit of 3% of GDP. General \ngovernment debt as a ratio to GDP, which was 48% at the end of 2008, down from 50.3% in \n2007, could reach or surpass 2007 levels. \n \nC.  Impact on Specific Sectors \n1.  Infrastructure \n7.  Roads. The estimated cost of repairing damage to the national road infrastructure is $16 \nmillion.  Secondary  and  rural  roads  suffered  damage  to  many  culverts,  stream  and  river \ncrossings, because of flood flows well in excess of the designed capacity. Drainage structures \nwere scoured, the road embankments were washed away. Numerous landslides occurred, \nblocking roads and access to rural communities. Gravel running surfaces were also washed \naway,  rendering  additional  sections  of  road  impassable.  Major  bridges  escaped  serious \ndamage, though some road approaches were washed away. Major highways also suffered \nsome  damage  from  landslides,  and  also  from  loss  of  the  bitumen  sealed  surface  and \nconsequent damage to the road base. Estimates of damage are based on restoring damaged \nroads to good condition. However, poor maintenance and inadequate original construction have \ncontributed to the extent of the damage. \n \n8.  Water and Sanitation. Water supplies to the main towns in the western division (Nadi, \nBa, and Sigatoka) were severely disrupted by damage to intake facilities and transmission \npipelines cut by washouts. Rural water supply systems were also damaged. Sewerage systems \nwere similarly disrupted with major damage to pipelines occurring in Sigatoka because of the \ncollapse of the sugar tramway bridge carrying the pipeline from the town to the treatment plant. \nPreliminary estimates (footnote 1) put the cost of repairs at $6.4 million including for the cost of \ndelivering water to consumers by tanker, pending emergency repairs to the pipelines. However, \nthese  costs  were  found  on  review  to  be  overstated,  even  though  the  impact of  disrupted \nservices was severe. \n \n9.  Utilities.  Power  supply  disruptions  were  extensive  across  all  three  flood-affected \ndivisions. The Government estimates the repair costs for damage to the power network and \nsubstations at $1.4 million. Telecommunications infrastructure suffered damage estimated at \n$0.6 million. \n \n10.  Transport. Airports were closed during the rainfall and flooding, affecting international \nand domestic routes. However, the airport infrastructure did not suffer any damage. \n                                                 \n2  International Monetary Fund. 2009. Use of Fund Resources \u2013 Request for Emergency Assistance. Washington \n(March) (Draft). \n ", "3 \n2.  Commerce Sector \n11.  Tourism. The industry incurred losses because of the early departure of tourists in the \ncountry at the time of the flooding and a reduction in tourist arrivals in the aftermath. Losses are \nlikely to have continued in the ensuing period because of the extensive publicity given to the \nfloods overseas. Estimated losses in tourism alone because of the decline in arrivals are $40 \nmillion (annual earnings from tourism in 2008 was an estimated $437 million). This decline has \nalso affected tourism operators, restaurants, shops, and their suppliers. There was little impact \non hotel infrastructure. \n \n12.  Business. The Nadi Chamber of Commerce has estimated losses to local business of \nup to $93 million. Only the largest businesses have flood insurance. This protection is not \navailable to middle and small businesses, which have suffered substantial trade and stock \nlosses. Many have lacked the capacity to restock, and have closed down or are looking at doing \nso as their stock depletes or leases expire. Many have ceased paying rent since the flood, \neither with or without the concurrence of the landlord. \n \n13.  Market vendors and hawkers suffered substantial economic losses because of their \ninability to trade for the duration of the flood and the subsequent cleanup stage (about 3 weeks), \nin addition to the loss of produce and goods, and difficulties in sourcing new stock. \n \n3.  Agriculture Sector \n14.  Sugar. The sugar industry suffered damage to crops, mill infrastructure, and tram and \nroad infrastructure, as well as loss of soil nutrients. The preliminary estimate of loss to the cane \ncrop is 69,000 tons (annual production is about 2.8 million tons) valued at $6.2 million. The loss \nwill result from the destruction of standing cane washed away by torrents, but also because of \nlower sugar content as a consequence of prolonged inundation. Damage was also caused to \nsugar-related  infrastructure,  including  access  roads,  railways,  and  associated  bridges.  In \nSigatoka, a major bridge dedicated to carrying a sugarcane tramway was destroyed. With a \nreplacement cost of $4.0 million, and declining cane production from the areas served, the \nbridge will not be replaced and future cane harvest will be transported to the mill by road. The \nRarawai sugar mill in Ba, inundated by more than 3 meters of water over several days, suffered \nsignificant damage. The cost of repairing damage to this and other sugar infrastructure is \nestimated to be $4.7 million. \n \n15.  Other Crops. Root crop staples such as cassava, taro, and sweet potato are intolerant \nto flooding and were badly damaged in flooded and poorly drained areas. This led to food \nshortages in the villages, and scarcity and high prices in the markets for 3 months following the \nfloods. Nascent export crops, particularly pawpaw, suffered considerable damage with several \nplantations being totally destroyed. The Ministry of Agriculture and Primary Industries (MAPI) \nassessed losses to crops other than sugar to be $4.2 million.3 Of this amount, $3.4 million \ncomprised losses to crops intended for export. About 2,900 hectares of crops were seriously \ndamaged in the Western and Central divisions, and the livelihoods of about 23,000 farmers \nwere affected, either through crop loss or loss of access to markets. \n \n                                                 \n3  Ministry of Agriculture and Primary Industries and Primary Industries. 2009. Flood Damage Report. Suva. \n ", "4 \n16.  Livestock. Damage to livestock is estimated at $4 million. About 75% of dairy farms \nexperienced  loss  of  pasture,  reducing  dairy  production  considerably.  Poultry  farmers \nexperienced extensive losses in the western division. \n \n17.  Agriculture Infrastructure. Flood damage to agricultural drainage and sea defenses, \nincluding flood gates is estimated at $1.5 million. \n \n4.  Social Sector \n18.  Health. Additional costs were associated with the vector control measures taken to \naddress the immediate public health risks associated with the damage to water and sanitation \ninfrastructure. Some health facilities incurred minor damage estimated at $0.4 million. \n \n19.  Education.  Floods  affected  22%  of  all  primary  schools  and  32%  of  all  secondary \nschools, covering 19,000 students. Classroom blocks, dormitories, dining halls, school gardens, \nfurniture, books, and teaching equipment and materials were damaged. Physical damage was \nestimated at $0.8 million. Many schools were used as evacuation centers during the flooding \nand in the immediate aftermath. The start of the school year was postponed by 1 week. \n \nD.  Social Impact and Effects on Poverty \n1.  Social Impacts \n20.  Floods directly affected more than 146,000 people in the Western and Central divisions, \nand about 90,000 people in Northern Division. \n \n21.  Loss  of  Life.  Twelve people lost their lives as a result of the floods. Nine people \ndrowned, two people died in landslides, and one person died at an evacuation center. \n22.  Displacement. One of the major social impacts was displacement. For most affected \npeople, the displacement was temporary. Evacuation centers were established for the duration \nof the flood. Evacuations started on 11 January 2009. At the peak of the flood on 16 January, \n11,458 people had been evacuated to 169 evacuation centers. By 23 January, the number of \nevacuees had declined to 1,191 in 27 centers. When another flood peak hit Central Division on \n30 January, an additional center was opened to 101 new evacuees. These numbers are likely to \nbe a significant underestimate of the actual number of people who had to flee their homes as \nmany took refuge with family or friends. \n23.  Housing. Floods destroyed 164 houses and partly damaged 1,677 other houses in \nWestern Division. The total value of housing loss and damage is estimated at $0.9 million. \n24.  Economic Loss. The loss of household items and personal belongings, clothes, and \nrecords and documents was significant. Many lost all they had. Food gardens were washed \naway, resulting in immediate hardship for households relying on their own produce for their food \nsupply, and in economic loss for those relying the sale of surplus produce. The immediate rise \nin price for basic foods had an impact not only on people in the flood-affected areas but across \nthe Fiji Islands. \n25.  Quality  of  Life.  In the immediate aftermath and in the longer-term recovery phase \npeople  experienced  life  with  no  water  or  interrupted  water  supply,  and  poor  sanitation, \n ", "5 \nImpassable  and  damaged  roads  made  access  to  markets  and  services  difficult.  All  who \nexperienced the floods suffered some degree of stress. \n2.  Impact on Poverty \n26.  Poverty  has  been  increasing  gradually  in  the  Fiji  Islands  since  1990  across  all \nhouseholds, both Fijian and Indian, and in urban and rural areas.4 The average incidence of \nbasic needs poverty for all households was estimated at 29.7% in 2006, up from 25% in 1990; \nand for the population at 34.4% in 2006, up from 25.5% in 1990. Urban poverty is greater in \nhouseholds living in settlement and Housing Authority areas, where 36% of people live below \nthe poverty line. In rural areas, 38% of people are estimated to live in poverty. Thus, it is \nreasonable to assume that at least one-third of the 236,000 people directly affected by the \nfloods were living in poverty and would have had little or no capacity to withstand the shock. \n27.  The floods have worsened the situation of those already living below the poverty line. \nThe floods have also likely increased the vulnerability to poverty for those previously above the \npoverty line. Food price increases after the flood would have had the biggest impact on the \npoor, who are most likely to rely on subsistence gardens for their own consumption. About 54% \nof low-income Fijian families provide a substantial proportion (more than 40%) of their own food. \nDuring the flood and immediate afterward, those directly affected by the flood were not able to \nengage in any economic activity for some weeks. \nE.  Macroeconomic Impact \n28.  As  the  economic  impact  of  the  floods  is  concurrent  with  the  impact  of  the  global \ndownturn, separation of the effects is difficult, particularly for tourism. However, the International \nMonetary Fund, in its assessment for the purpose of considering a request for Emergency \nAssistance for National Disasters (ENDA), has assessed the economic cost of the flooding, \npublic and private, to be around $180 million (5.3% of GDP). The direct impact on foreign \nexchange revenue includes losses in sugar exports and tourism receipts plus additional food \nimports to meet food shortages. In addition, stock losses and damaged infrastructure will be \nreplaced, further increasing import costs. \n29.  The  fiscal  impact  of  the  floods  is  expected  to  be  mostly  in  the  form  of  additional \nexpenditure on relief and reconstruction. This will be realized mainly by reorienting spending, \nbut some revenue will be lost. To finance the extra spending, the authorities have re-prioritized \nexpenditures as much as possible from within the existing budget, including deferring salary and \nwage increases and using part of the 2009 capital expenditure budget. Because of slower \ngrowth, especially in the tourist industry, tax revenues are expected to decline relative to the \nbudget estimates. Therefore, the overall budget deficit is likely to be slightly above 4% of GDP, \nwhich is higher than projected in the 2009 budget, provided that appropriate actions are taken to \nlimit the negative effects.  \nF.  Government's Response \n30.  The response and relief phases were generally well managed through the National \nDisaster Management Office. Warnings issued by the Nadi Meteorological Office on 7 January \n2009  triggered  activation  of  the  national  Emergency  Operations  Centre  and  divisional \noperations centers. A state of natural disaster was declared on 11 January 2009, when it \n                                                 \n4  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). 2006. Estimation of Basic Needs Poverty Lines and Incidence of \nPoverty in Fiji. Suva. \n ", "6 \nbecame apparent that widespread damage was occurring as a result of the continuous rain, and \nthat  local  authorities  could  not  respond  effectively  because  of  disruption  of  access  and \ncommunications. To safeguard properties, 12-hour curfews were imposed in Sigatoka, Ba, and \nNadi townships. The operations centers coordinated the establishment of evacuation centers, \nsearch and rescue operations, supply of emergency rations, and subsequently the orderly return \nof evacuees to their homes. \n \n31.  A  national  task  force  was  established  under  the  chairmanship  of  the  permanent \nsecretary of provincial development. It was responsible for obtaining and assessing information, \nand  coordinating  the  response.  Members  of  the  task  force  included  representatives  of  all \nrelevant government agencies and civil society. The division commissioners undertook field \nassessments to provide the detailed information needed for managing the immediate response \nand to start planning for rehabilitation. \n \n32.  Food rations were distributed in two phases. The first phase, which began on 8 January \n2009, provided food to persons gathering in the evacuation centers and continued until 22 \nJanuary 2009. The second phase started on 23 January 2009 and provided targeted assistance \nto flood-affected persons, including small-scale subsistence farmers who had lost their crops. \nRation packs, based on family size, included rice, flour, dhal, milk, sugar, cooking oil, and \ncanned fish. The cost of the distribution program was estimated to be $3.3 million per month. \nNumerous  NGOs  provided  considerable  assistance  in  distributing  food  and  clothing.  The \nGovernment's distribution program is planned to continue for up to 3 months. \n \n33.  The  Government,  through  the  Ministry  of  Works,  Transport  and  Public  Utilities \n(MWTPU),  began  repairs  to  transport  and  water  and  sanitation  infrastructure  as  soon  as \nconditions permitted. Considerable effort was expended to remove landslides blocking roads, \nrepair washed out road sections, and restore safe but basic access. On the main sealed road \nnetwork,  particularly  in  and  around  Nadi,  resources  were  diverted  from  an  ongoing  road \nrehabilitation contract to repair washed out and heavily potholed sections of sealed road to \npromote rapid recovery of the town and its function as a tourist center. Water was taken by \nwater tanker to areas with disrupted supplies, and a system of communal water tanks was \nestablished to provide potable water. Simultaneously, access roads to reservoirs and pumping \nstations were reopened and repairs made to washed out pipelines where possible. However, \nthe majority of the repairs only restored the service, and additional work will be required in most \ncases to effect permanent repairs. \n \n34.  MAPI  embarked  upon  an  immediate  program  of  distributing  planting  materials  and \nseeds. This program seems to have been remarkably successful; the area of land under crops \nafter the floods now exceeds that in place before. A factor may be that the supply of planting \nmaterials was free, stimulating greater interest in \"backyard\" farming in the urban areas as well \nas by those normally engaged in farming. The latter group generally would be totally reliant on \nsales of vegetables for cash income and compelled to use their best efforts to normalize their \nproduction. Fortunately, stocks of planting materials in other parts of the country escaped \ndamage. As part of its future preparedness approach, MAPI will maintain stocks at diverse \nlocations, maximizing the chances that a successful replanting program such as this can be \nrepeated.  MAPI  intends  to  continue  expanding  agricultural  production  for  export  and  for \nsubstitution of imports, and to mitigate risks arising from natural disasters by maximizing the \ngeographical distribution of the production centers. Over reliance on particular locations such as \nthe Sigatoka valley is one of the lessons emerging from this disaster. \n \n ", "7 \nG.  Development Partners' Response \n35.  The Government, development partners, regional governments, NGOs, and the private \nsector provided immediate assistance in response to the disaster. Donations in cash were \nchanneled  through  the  Prime  Minister's  Relief  Fund  (a  standing  account  maintained  on  a \npermanent basis to receive donations for emergency relief), the Red Cross, United Nations \nagencies, or directly to NGOs engaged in the emergency response. Donations in kind, including \nfood and nonfood items, water, water tanks, shelter, medical care, and logistics support, were \nalso received. About $1.3 million was donated to the Prime Minister's Fund with about $2.7 \nmillion for direct assistance from the donor or through an NGO. \n \n36.  The Government of Australia and the European Union coordinated closely to provide \nsupport in the education sector, including rehabilitation of 66 schools. The European Union \nresources were allocated from an ongoing project. The Government of New Zealand donated \nNZ$1 million for immediate relief and is considering allocating an additional $2 million for \nmedium-term rehabilitation. Assistance by development partners and NGOs is in Appendix 2. \n \n37.  Under a collaborative response to the disaster, the World Bank will finance and manage \njointly identified and evaluated TA for Disaster Risk Management. The TA project will develop \nand implement strategic management of flood risks with a long-term integrated perspective. \nSupport will be provided to promote an enabling environment for reforms, leading to policies on \nrisk  reduction  and  proactive  institutional  arrangements  within  an  integrated  flood  risk \nmanagement framework. Components of the TA will include (i) flood risk assessment and \nevaluation of risk reduction measures, (ii) strengthening of flood forecasting and early warning \nsystems, and (iii) institutional reform for flood management. \n \nH.  ADB's Response \n38.  The Government requested an emergency assistance loan from ADB on 30 January \n2009. Staff from the ADB South Pacific Subregional Office in Suva met with Government \nofficials and other development partners to prepare a coordinated response to the disaster. With \nits long-term involvement in transport, and water and sanitation infrastructure in the Fiji Islands, \nADB agreed to take the lead in preparing a project for the rehabilitation and repair of affected \ninfrastructure. \n \n39.  ADB has provided assistance to the land transport sector under the Second and Third \nRoad Upgrading (Sector) projects.5 ADB's assistance has included support for institutional and \npolicy change to improve efficiency, governance, and accountability within the land transport \nagencies, as well as for rehabilitation and upgrading of the roads. ADB is providing technical \nassistance (TA) for the preparation of a land transport master plan, and undertaking preparatory \nwork  for  a  fourth  road  upgrading  project,  the  timing  of  which  will  be  subject  to  ADB's \nreengagement approach in the Fiji Islands. 6  \n \n40.  ADB's approach to reengagement with Fiji Islands following the political crisis in 2006 \nhas two stages. In the first stage, ADB continued operations ongoing as of December 2006, as \nit ascertained that the interim government (i) effectively controlled the country, (ii) recognized \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 1992.

Stage two of \nreengagement\u2014preparation  of  a  new  country  partnership  strategy  and  approval  of  new \noperations\u2014requires that five conditions prevail.7  Management considers these have yet to be \nmet in full. The emergency assistance loan will be provided on an exceptional basis. \n \n41.  Processing has been delayed beyond the 12 weeks normally required for an emergency \nloan because of the evolving political situation, the lack of a current ADB country strategy, \ngovernment  capacity  constraints,  and  the  need  for  extensive  consultations  with  key \ndevelopment  partners.  Development  of  an  interim  operational  strategy  was  commenced  in \nparallel with processing of the loan. However its preparation has been similarly delayed by the \nneed  for  further  consultations  with  development  partners  and  delays  in  the  International \nMonetary Fund's Article IV mission until October 2009. Waiver of the requirement for an interim \noperational strategy as part of the processing of an emergency assistance8 loan is being \nsought. \n \n42.  ADB undertook a detailed review of the Government's damage and needs assessment \n(footnote 1) jointly with the World Bank with a view to  a collaborative response and with \nemphasis on verification of the priority needs and the cost of restoring infrastructure during the \nrecovery phase. As the emerging needs for infrastructure were relatively modest, it was agreed \nthat the World Bank would focus on needs for TA with disaster risk management being identified \nas a priority. A detailed review of the Government's expenditures associated with infrastructure \nrecovery during the transition phase was also carried out. \n \nI.  Lessons for Disaster Management \n43.  The National Disaster Management Office facilitated a number of debriefing meetings at \nthe  district  level  and  national  level,  and  with  development  partners  and  NGOs.  Identified \ndeficiencies in the emergency response were: \n(i)  Coordination  between  the  Government  and  NGOs.  Some  NGOs  worked \nalone and on their own priorities, resulting in some duplication of the relief effort. \nCloser cooperation for disaster planning is required to ensure better coordination. \n(ii)  Coordination with the private sector. The private sector provided considerable \nsupport during the emergency response, including for the delivery of drinking \nwater and transportation of relief assistance. However, delays were incurred \nwhile arrangements were made. A plan should be developed with private sector \ndonors to ensure more rapid mobilization of resources. \n(iii)  Targeting of relief for affected persons. Current arrangements do not allow for \ndistribution of Government-funded relief supplies to squatters, who are among \nthe most vulnerable after natural disasters. Procedures for assisting such people \nneed to be reviewed. \n(iv)  Financial  assistance  for  affected  persons.  Many small and medium-sized \nbusinesses suffered losses because of the floods. Many people needed short-\n                                                 \n7  The conditions are: (i) whether a new loan would expose ADB to additional legal or political risks, (ii) whether the \nde facto government is in effective control of the country and enjoys a reasonable degree of stability and public \nacceptance,  (iii)  whether  the  de  facto  government  generally  recognizes  the  country's  existing  international \nobligations, (iv) the number of countries (particularly ADB member countries and neighboring countries) that have \nrecognized the de facto government or dealt with it as the government of the country, and (v) the attitude of other \ninternational organizations towards the de facto government. \n8   ADB. 2004. Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy. Manila. \n ", "9 \nterm financial assistance to replace damaged stock, replant crops, pay school \nfees, etc. Local financial institutions, including the Fiji National Provident Fund, \nthe Fiji Development Bank, the Housing Authority, and the commercial banks, \nneed to develop policies and guidelines for small-scale emergency assistance \nloans to individuals to be prepared for such disasters. \n(v)  Risk-based approach for integrated water resource management. Damage \nto property could be reduced through an integrated approach to disaster risk \nmanagement. The South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission estimated the \naverage annual loss in the Fiji Islands from 1975 to 2005 was $11 million. A risk-\nbased approach to disaster management is needed to supplement the current \nreactive approach. \n \nJ.  Rationale for the Project \n44.  Equitable economic growth and improvement in social and health indicators depend on \nmaintaining the rural economy\u2014a need made more urgent by the disaster. The damage to the \ntransport  network  constrains  the  movement  of  people  and  goods.  It  is  a  disincentive  to \nproductive rural activity, and an impediment to the recovery and growth of tourism. While basic \naccess has been restored, the disaster has degraded the infrastructure, rendering it more \nvulnerable to repeated damage (along with the accompanying economic and social dislocation) \nfrom less severe weather events. Better transportation infrastructure and services, which would \nrestore access to domestic and international markets for agricultural products, are essential to \nrehabilitating rural economies in the affected areas. Therefore, the focus on restoring rural \naccessibility will reduce poverty. \n \n45.  The disaster is also evidence of increased vulnerability to changes in climatic conditions. \nClimate change is expected to increase extreme weather, and to cause the sea level to rise. \nRoads, bridges, and wharves require better environmental protection and higher construction \nstandards to withstand potential future natural events. The Project will be designed to withstand \nthe increased likelihood of such effects within the expected life of rehabilitated infrastructure. An \nADB publication describes methodology for incorporation of climate proofing and \"building back \nbetter,\" and this will be followed to the extent feasible. 9\n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n46.  Consistent with its Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy (2004), ADB\u2019s response \nto the floods will focus on the short-term rehabilitation of the damaged infrastructure. It will \nincorporate flexible implementation provisions to allow ADB to respond effectively to changing \nconditions, and it will support activities that anticipate and mitigate the impacts of future floods. \nThe recommended package for emergency assistance comprises an emergency assistance \nloan to the Fiji Islands to meet the entire cost of rehabilitating road infrastructure and agricultural \ndrainage schemes, and to contribute to the cost of rehabilitating water supply systems. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n47.  The impact will be reduced economic losses and social disruption from extreme weather \nin the future. The outcome will be the restoration of economic and social activities in affected \nareas  to  pre-disaster  levels.  The  rehabilitation  of  damaged  roads  is  expected  to  restore \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2005. Climate Proofing: A Risk Based Approach to Adaptation.

The design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1.  \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n48.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  using  a  sector  approach.  Each  subproject  will  be \nprioritized and selected in accordance with the process and eligibility criteria in Appendix 3. A \nsystematic and consultative approach will be established for subproject appraisal, covering (i) \nsocial,  economic,  and  environmental  evaluation;  (ii)  design;  (iii)  procurement;  (iv) \nimplementation;  and  (v)  monitoring.  Each  subproject  feasibility  study  will  provide  sufficient \nevidence of its eligibility under the agreed criteria, and will be in the detail and quality required to \nenable  ADB  to  assess  the  viability  and  suitability  of  the  subproject.  Implementation  will \nincorporate HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention and general health and safety activities. \n \n49.  Component A: Repairs in the Emergency Response Phase. The Project will finance \neligible expenditures incurred during the immediate post-disaster period to restore basic, safe \naccess.  Activities  included  clearing  of  landslides  and  debris,  reinstatement  of  washed-out \napproaches to bridges and wet crossings, and temporary road pavement repairs.  \n \n50.  Component B: Civil Works. The Project will finance the following civil works: \n(i)  rehabilitation of about 8 kilometers (km) of main sealed highway, restoring the \nbituminous sealed surface and including upgrading of the pavement structure as \nrequired for a design life of 20 years; \n(ii)  repairs  to  landslips  on  major  roads,  incorporating  appropriate  geotechnical \ninvestigation and design recommendations; \n(iii)  rehabilitation  of  secondary  roads,  including  re-gravelling  of  about  50  km  of \nunsealed roads, reconstruction of 30 culverts, and reconstruction or lengthening \nof washed-out wet crossings.  \n(iv)  miscellaneous repairs to water supplies; and \n(v)  repairs  to  agricultural  drainage  schemes:  MAPI's  Land  and  Water  Resource \nManagement Division (LWRM) has prepared a detailed plan for rehabilitation of \nflood-damaged drainage schemes in all three divisions (Western, Central, and \nNorthern);  and  works  will  be  undertaken  to  (a)  clear  waterways,  (b)  repair \ndamaged seawalls and dykes, (c) repair and protect scoured drains and culverts, \nand (d) repair floodgates (Supplementary Appendix A). \n \n51.  Component C: Consulting Services. The Project will finance consulting services for  \nProject  coordination,  design  and  supervision  of  implementation,  and  for  strengthening  the \nEnvironmental Management Unit (EMU) of the MWTPU. Recent emergency assistance loans in \nthe Pacific have suffered long delays in disbursement of funds due in large part to capacity \nconstraints  in  design,  contracting,  and  supervision.  Rapid  disbursement  is  only  possible  if \ndesign and supervision are effectively carried out in a timely manner. Contracting expertise to \nensure this happens is a sound investment. \n \n52.  Designs will enhance resilience against extreme weather by incorporating appropriate \nclimate  proofing  measures,  including  large  critical  drainage  structures  and  providing  scour \nprotection for bridges and wet crossings. A \"build back better\" approach will be adopted that will \nensure appropriate engineering design standards are met as a minimum requirement, and the \nopportunity will be taken to provide significantly more robust replacement structures.  \n \n ", "11 \nC.  Special Features \n53.  The Project has no special features. It is specifically designed to be uncomplicated and \nflexible to allow speedy execution. This need is a lesson emerging from recent emergency \nassistance projects in the Pacific, where major delays in implementation have largely negated \nthe rationale for an emergency assistance response.  \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n54.  The Project is estimated to cost $19.99 million, including taxes and duties of $4.50 \nmillion. The costs of the components are summarized in Table 1.

Financing Plan \n55.  The Government has requested a loan of $17.56 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources. As provided for in ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy, the loan will \nhave  a  32-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nLoan Agreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to \nborrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, \nand (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in \nreliance on any communication or advice from ADB.  \n \n \n ", "12 \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of \nSource  ($ million)    Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank  17.56    87.80 \nGovernment of the Fiji islands  2.43    12.20 \n  Total    19.99    100.00 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n56.  ADB will finance 87.8% of the total project cost, including taxes and duties, and the \nGovernment will fund the balance (12.2%). Country cost-sharing and financing parameters have \nbeen approved in July 2009. ADB may finance up to 99% of the project cost with higher \npercentages  being  provided  for  non-income-earning  projects  with  strong  evidence  of \ncommitment and that address binding constraints to growth and development.  Consideration \nhas been given to the amount of taxes and duties, and these do not constitute an excessive \nshare of project costs.  \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n57.  The EA for the Project will be the Ministry of National Planning (MNP). The MNP will be \nsupported by a Project Coordinator financed by the ADB loan. The Project will be implemented \nby  the  MWTPU  for  the  roads  and  water  supply  components  and  by  the  LWRM  for  the \nagricultural drainage scheme rehabilitation components. As the EA, MNP, will be responsible for \nthe overall execution of the Project and will coordinate with the MWTPU and LWRM. A project \nsteering committee will be established, comprising representatives from the MNP, the Ministry \nof Finance, the permanent secretary for MWTPU, the divisional commissioners, the director of \nthe LWRM, the director of national roads, the director of water supply, and the divisional \nengineers (as required). The steering committee will oversee and monitor all aspects of project \nimplementation  including  (i)  policy  guidance  and  coordination,  (ii)  subproject  selection,  (iii) \nproject  progress  reports  and  other  project  documentation,  and  (iv)  audited  accounts  and \nfinancial statements. \n \n58.  A project management team (PMT), housed within MWTPU will be responsible for day to \nday implementation and will coordinate the Project related activities of both the MWTPU and \nLWRM, and report to the EA accordingly. The PMT will be headed by the director of national \nroads. The PMT will (i) conduct subproject assessments, design, and supervision; (ii) manage \ntendering processes; (iii) manage contracts; (iv) prepare withdrawal applications; (v) prepare \nproject progress reports and a project completion report; (vi) maintain project accounts for \nauditing;  (vii)  monitor  the  Project\u2019s  socioeconomic  and  environmental  impacts;  and  (viii) \ncomplete  related  project  management  activities,  as  necessary  to  implement  the  Project \nsuccessfully and comply with ADB policies and guidelines. The PMT will be supported by \nconsultants that will be financed from the loan. \n \n59.  A project procurement audit10 of MWPTU in connection with its administration of the \nongoing  Third  Road  Upgrading  (Sector)  Project  found  critical  deficiencies  in  documenting \nproject expenditures, particularly for force account works. The audit report urged MWTPU to \nstrengthen the project management unit for future ADB project administration and management. \n                                                 \n10 Office of the Auditor General, ADB. 2006. 2006 Annual Report: Appendix 4: Project Procurement-Related Audit for   \nLoan 1530-FIJ: Third Road Upgrading Sector Project.

The improvements were verified during project review missions, and \ninformally  during  an  audit  of  ADB  South  Pacific  Subregional  Office.11  A  qualified  project \naccountant, financed by the ADB loan will support the financial management of the Project.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n60.  The Project will be implemented over 24 months. Consultants will be recruited under \nadvance procurement. Services for feasibility studies, detailed design, and bidding documents \nwill  be  procured  by  September  2009.  Services  for  project  management  and  construction \nsupervision will be procured by November 2009. Preparatory activities for all works (excluding \nrepairs to landslips) will be completed by November 2009, and initial contract awards will be \nmade in December 2009. Rehabilitation activities will be physically completed by August 2011. \nThe  loan  is  scheduled  to  close  by  29  February  2012.  The  implementation  schedule  is  in \nAppendix 5. \n \n3.  Procurement \n61.  Standard  ADB  operational  policies,  including  those  on  procurement  and  consulting \nservices, financial management, and disbursement, should be liberally interpreted to ensure \nspeedy and effective rehabilitation.12 This will include relaxing international competitive bidding \n(ICB) requirements to avail of faster project preparation and procurement procedures applicable \nto  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB).  Procurement  under  the  Project,  including  packages \nfinanced by ADB and the Government, will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time). Civil works will be divided into packages to be procured using ICB, \nNCB, or shopping procedures as appropriate. The civil works contracts to be procured consist of \na series of low-value works (less than $2 million). These contracts will be of limited interest to \nforeign contractors and suppliers, and local production and construction facilities are available, \noffering prices below the international market.13 These contracts will be procured by NCB. ICB \nmay be used for procuring rehabilitation of the main sealed highway and for landslide repairs if \nthe estimated value (after detailed design) of these packages exceeds $2 million. Procurement \nwill use ADB's standard bidding documents. Shopping will be used for procuring low-value (less \nthan $100,000), readily available, off-the-shelf goods, or simple civil works of low value. The first \ndraft version of the NCB procurement documents will be submitted to ADB for review to ensure \nconsistency  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  Draft  bidding  documents  for  ICB  will  be \nsubject to prior review by ADB. Technical and financial qualifications of contractors will be \nreviewed in conjunction with the review of the bid proposals. Contractors may be awarded more \nthan one contract package based on the least-cost combination of contracts and the capacity of \nthe contractor. The procurement plan is in Appendix 6. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n62.  Although the PMT will be fully integrated with MWTPU and LWRM professional and \ntechnical staff, the PMT needs to be supplemented with additional technical support because of \nthe  volume  and  schedule  of  existing  activities  and  both  agency's  limited  technical  staff \n                                                 \n11  A team from the Office of the Auditor General visited the EA on 9 June 2009 and reviewed records and record-   \nkeeping systems, and concluded that the recommendations of the 2006 audit had been satisfactorily implemented. \n12\nADB.  2004.

Consulting services will be required for (i) Project coordination and support for the \nMNP,  (ii)  engineering  design  and  preparation  of  bidding  documents,  (iii)  construction \nsupervision, and (iii) project management and for strengthening MWTPU's EMU. The Project \nwill fund about 42.5 person-months of international consulting services and 82 person-months of \nnational consulting services. The international consultants will include (i) a project manager (20 \nperson-months), (ii) a senior works inspector (15 person-months), (iii) a geotechnical specialist \n(4 person-months), (iv) a drainage and wet-crossing specialist (3 person-months), and (v) a \nfinancial management specialist (0.5 person months). The national consultants will comprise (i) \na project coordinator (24 person-months), (ii) a project accountant (18 person-months), (iii) a \nworks inspector (18 person-months), (iv) an environment specialist (18 person-months), and (v) \na drafts person (4 person-months). Consultants for design and supervision services, and for \nenvironmental monitoring will be supervised by the director of national roads. The MWTPU will \nalso provide support for the Project, including laboratory and field testing and surveys during \ndesign  and  construction.  The  consultants  will  train  MWTPU  and  LWRM  personnel  in \nconstruction supervision, and the trained staff will assist the team in supervising the project \nworks.  \n \n63.  Consultants will be recruited in accordance with the ADB Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007 as amended form time to time). For the first phase, a firm will be recruited to \nassist with the preparation of the subproject proposals, detailed designs, and contract bidding \ndocuments. The consultants qualification selection method will be used because recruitment \ntime is critical. In parallel, a firm will be recruited for project management and construction \nsupervision  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method,  and  a  biodata  technical \nproposal. Consultants recruited under the consultants qualification selection will be mobilized in \nSeptember 2009; those recruited under the quality- and cost-based selection method will be \nmobilized in November 2009. A Project coordinator and a national environmental specialist will \nbe recruited under the individual consultant selection method and will be mobilized during the \nfirst phase for the whole of the assignment. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 7. \n \n5.  Advance Procurement \n64.  Permanent repairs to damaged infrastructure should begin as soon as possible. ADB \nhas approved advance action for the procurement of goods and services, and for recruitment of \nconsultants. Advance action covers invitation of bids, bidding, bid evaluation, and contract \naward. The advance action will be reviewed to ensure that it conforms to ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines,  and  social  and  environmental  safeguards.  In  particular,  LWRM  has  initiated \nprocurement of 10 contracts for emergency repairs to agricultural drainage schemes ranging in \nestimated cost from $15,000 to $400,000. The Government has been advised that approval of \nthe advance action does not commit ADB to provide financing for the Project. \n \n6.  Retroactive Financing \n65.  The Project provides for retroactive financing of emergency repairs to infrastructure. \nADB management has agreed to provide retroactive financing for a maximum 30% of the total \nloan amount for eligible expenditures incurred before the effectiveness of the loan agreement \nbut not earlier than 11 January 2009 or 12 months before the date of the loan agreement, \nwhichever is the later. Retroactive financing will be permitted (i) if specifically agreed in the loan \nagreement and pursuant to the terms of such agreement, and (ii) the works are procured in \naccordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines.  \n \n ", "15 \n7.  Anticorruption Policy  \n66.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  EA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. A project website will be \nestablished and used to disclose the audited project financial accounts, project progress, and \nprocurement activities. \n \n8.  Disbursement Arrangements \n67.  The loan will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  disbursement  procedures  will  include  direct \npayments and reimbursements. Direct payments will be encouraged for most civil works and \nconsulting services. \n \n9.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n68.  Reports.  The  EA  will  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  progress  reports  on  preconstruction \nactivities and construction of civil works, including (i) physical and financial progress, (ii) status \nof land acquisition and resettlement (if required), (iii) environmental management, (iv) public \ncommunication  campaigns,  and  (v)  other  activities  essential  to  project  implementation.  To \nfacilitate  performance  monitoring  and  post-project  review,  the  Government  has  agreed  to \nprovide ADB, within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, a completion report that will \ncover implementation details, costs and benefits, and any other information that ADB might \nrequire. \n \n69.  Accounts and Audits. The EA will maintain separate records and accounts that will \nidentify the goods and services financed from the loan, the expenditures incurred for the Project, \nand the use of counterpart funds. The project accounts will be established and maintained in \naccordance  with  sound  accounting  principles  and  practices,  and  financial  reports  will  be \nprepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards. Auditors acceptable to \nADB shall be used to audit the accounts and annual financial statements annually. The audit \nreports will include an auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the loan proceeds and compliance with the \nfinancial covenants in the Loan Agreement. The Government will provide ADB with the annual \naudited financial statements, audited project accounts, audit reports, management letters, and \nother related statements no later than 6 months after the end of each fiscal year throughout the \nimplementation period. A special audit focusing on governance and financial accountability will \nbe carried out on completion of the Project. \n \n10.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n70.  The EA will establish a project performance and monitoring system within 3 months of \nloan effectiveness, using the targets and indicators in the design and monitoring framework. \nThese indicators will be refined and monitored during project implementation. The PMT will \n ", "16 \nmonitor and evaluate the Project\u2019s progress annually, and provide a final report within 6 months \nof the end of the contract period.  \n \n11.  Project Review \n71.  ADB and the Government will undertake regular review missions about every 6 months. \nReviews will evaluate the scope, implementation arrangements, and other relevant aspects of \nthe Project (including administrative, organizational, technical, environmental, social, poverty \nreduction, resettlement, economic, and financial aspects) that might affect project performance, \nviability, and achievement of scheduled targets. The Project will be administered by the ADB \nSouth Pacific Subregional Office in Suva. In addition to the formal reviews every 6 months, ADB \nstaff will provide constant support and oversight. \n   \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n72.  The Project will directly benefit the rural population in affected areas, many of whom are \npoor, by restoring access to economic opportunities and social services and safeguarding public \nhealth. Government agencies and private sector companies that use the transport network to \ndeliver products and services will benefit similarly. \n \nA.  Economic Impacts \n73.  Rehabilitation of roads and bridges, drainage schemes, and water supplies is essential \nto restoration of economic activities\u2014including agricultural exports from the affected areas and \naccess  for  tourism.  Thus,  it  will  improve  the  prospects  for  economic  growth  and  poverty \nreduction. In the affected areas, efficient and effective transport infrastructure is essential for \naccess to economic opportunities and social services by rural people who are disproportionately \npoor and disadvantaged. Damage to the transport network is restricting the delivery of food, \nfuel, and building materials necessary for the recovery. The rehabilitation program will mitigate \nthe potentially extended negative impacts of the disaster and enable the country to recover after \nonly a temporary setback. \n \n74.  Project activities will be widely scattered with graduated improvements to existing road \ninfrastructure. Project activities will be technically sound, cost-effective, and represent a least-\ncost alternative with appropriate adjustments for climate-resistant design. Quick and simple \neconomic  evaluations  of  subprojects  will  be  carried  out  using  methods  appropriate  to  the \ncontext. Narrative evaluations, addressing each of the subproject selection criteria (Appendix 3) \nwill be required to demonstrate that subprojects are economically justifiable and will be used to \nprioritize subprojects.  \n \nB.  Poverty Reduction Impact \n75.  The Project will support the country\u2019s efforts to reduce poverty by reinstating access to \nlocal  and  provincial  markets  for  agricultural  products,  thereby  restoring  income-generation \nopportunities. The Project also will reduce poverty by offering direct employment on the Project. \nDuring implementation, jobs will be created in construction and maintenance for civil works. The \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 8. \n \n ", "17 \nC.  Social Impact \n76.  The  Project  will  restore  safe  access  to  social  services  and  safe  water  for  rural \ncommunities. Positive social impacts include restoration of good access to education facilities, \nwhich will help maintain school enrollment and retention rates, and restoration of access to \nhealth services, which will promote more frequent use and facilitate rapid care during medical \nemergencies. The poor will benefit from the restoration of access to markets for the sale of \nvegetables from home gardens. Women in particular are commonly engaged in vegetable \ngardening to provide domestic food supply and supplementary income from the sale of excess \nproduce.  Other  social  benefits  include  restoration  of  access  to  administrative  and  service \ncenters, including communication facilities. \n \n77.  The  rehabilitation  subprojects  are  not  expected  to  require  resettlement  or  land \nacquisition, as all works are expected to be undertaken on existing facilities within existing \nrights-of-way. If changes in conditions require land acquisition or resettlement for civil works, the \nGovernment will inform ADB and prepare a resettlement plan according to relevant laws and \nregulations, the resettlement framework in Appendix 9, and ADB guidelines. The subproject \nselection process will include community consultations involving women. \n \n78.  Native Fijians, who comprise the majority of the population, are the indigenous people of \nthe Fiji Islands. For the indigenous population, the rehabilitation subprojects will improve access \nto health, education, livelihood, and social services. The Project is not expected to have a \ndifferential impact on indigenous peoples. \n \nD.  Environmental Impacts \n79.  The  Project  is  classified  environmental  category  B,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). Field surveys of \nsample subprojects were conducted to help assess the environmental impacts of the Project. All \nactivities are expected to be confined to existing locations and rights-of-way, and neither land \nacquisition nor resettlement should be required. A summary initial environmental examination \nincorporating an environmental management and monitoring plan (EMMP) has been prepared \n(Supplementary Appendix B). Two sample initial environmental examinations (IEEs) for sample \nsubprojects  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  C.  Environmental  assessment  and  review \nprocedures (EARP) are in Supplementary Appendix D. ADB\u2019s assessment procedure is aligned \nwith the environmental impact assessment requirements of the Environmental Management Act, \n2005. \n \n80.  The Project will be designed to withstand the increased likelihood of future disasters and \nnatural hazards, taking into account that Fiji is also routinely susceptible to geophysical hazards \n(e.g., dry landslide, earthquake, and tsunami). The design process will take an \"all hazards\" \napproach and will include an analysis of alternatives for construction that will be reviewed for \npotential environmental impacts and enhanced sustainability. \n \n81.  Subproject  environmental  selection  criteria  will  ensure  that  the  Project  will  not \npermanently harm any ecologically or culturally sensitive areas, and that all negative impacts \nidentified will be avoided or mitigated through the design. The construction of better drainage \nstructures, stabilization of slopes through bioengineering, and other measures undertaken by \nthe  Project  will  have  long-term  benefits  for  the  environment.  Short-term  impacts  will  be \nunavoidable during construction. These might include noise, dust, and other temporary impacts \nsuch as loss of vegetation because of earth moving; and minor sedimentation of waterways and \n ", "18 \nthe  coastal  environment  near  the  shore.  These  impacts  will  be  addressed,  and  methods \nspecified in the EMMP will mitigate them. \n \n82.  Each subproject will be subject to an IEE, which will include a detailed, site-specific \nEMMP prepared by the PMT. The EMMP will specify the required mitigation measures and \nmonitoring  activities  to  ensure  their  effectiveness.  The  EARP  will  guide  the  environmental \nmanagement of the sector project and preparation of the environmental assessments of the \nsubprojects. \n \nE.  Project Risks and Mitigation \n83.  Technical  Risks.  Weak  capacity  within  the  MWTPU  could  lead  to  implementation \nproblems.  Underestimation  of  resource  allocation  and  improper  construction  methods  and \nequipment might cause delays and increase costs. Limited availability of aggregates in some \nareas  could  pose  difficulties.  The  project  design  will  mitigate  these  risks  by  (i)  providing \nadditional  resources  through  an  integrated  PMT  to  manage  the  Project;  (ii)  incorporating \nprovisions in tender documents for evidence of satisfactory past performance by contractors in \nsimilar conditions; (iii) requiring a minimum level for provision of physical plant at mobilization, \ndetailed quantification of engineering risks, and adequate contingencies for unforeseen items; \n(iv) strengthening the MWTPU's EMU; and (v) holding community consultations in advance, with \nGovernment support, on access to resources. \n \n84.  Environmental Risks. Civil works, including material acquisition, could create negative \nimpacts  on  the  environment.  The  high  rainfall  climate,  ecologically  sensitive  coastal  and \nforested landscapes, and high level of biodiversity and endemism provide a large potential for \nenvironmental impacts. However, activities will be undertaken within the confines of the existing \nfacilities. The Project will not disturb major habitats, most activities will be in areas previously \nused for similar infrastructure, and an environmental management plan will be put in place for \neach set of subprojects. Adherence to best engineering practices during rehabilitation, and strict \nenforcement of the EMMP, will avoid or adequately mitigate all of the rehabilitation-related \nimpacts. The risks of a greater frequency or severity of natural events caused by climate change \nare increasing. The risks to rehabilitated infrastructure are mitigated by using higher engineering \nstandards  for  construction.  All  reports  on  the  Project's  environmental  performance  will  be \ndisclosed to the public through the project website. \n \n85.  Land and Material Acquisition Risks. Landowners and rural populations are expected \nto welcome the rehabilitation activities because of the social and economic benefits. Risks relate \nprincipally  to  gaining  access  to  construction  materials  including  sand,  gravel,  and  rocks. \nPractices for consultation and compensation are well established in the Fiji Islands, and strict \nadherence to these practices will mitigate the risks of delays.  \n \n86.  Governance  Risks.  Civil  works  and  consulting  contracts  are  subject  to  risks  of \ninappropriate  procurement  and  potentially  corrupt  practices.  The  Government  has  well-\ndocumented procedures that require all contracts to be procured through a tender board. All \nprocedures are publicly advertised. \n \n87.  An analysis of the project risks shows the potential adverse social and environmental \nimpacts  are  not  significant  and  can  be  mitigated.  Cost  and  implementation  risks  will  be \nmanaged through the proposed approach to contractor selection, contract conditions, financial \nincentives, and penalties for delayed implementation. The risks are manageable and do not \nconstitute barriers to successful project implementation. \n ", "19 \n \nV.  ASSURANCES  \n88.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Subproject  selection.

Project Components \n1.  The Fiji Islands Emergency Flood Recovery (Sector) Project will rehabilitate essential \ninfrastructure that was damaged by heavy rains and severe flooding in January 2009. The \nProject will be implemented via a sector approach. Each subproject will be prioritized and \nselected in accordance with the process and eligibility criteria set forth in this appendix. A \nsystematic and consultative approach will be established for subproject appraisal, covering (i) \nsocial,  economic,  and  environmental  evaluation;  (ii)  design;  (iii)  procurement;  (iv) \nimplementation;  and  (v)  monitoring.  Each  subproject  feasibility  study  will  provide  sufficient \nevidence of its eligibility under the agreed-upon criteria, and will be in accordance with the detail \nand quality required to enable the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to assess the viability and \nsuitability of the subproject. \n \n2.  Component A: Repairs in the Emergency Response Phase. The Project will finance \neligible expenditures incurred during the immediate post-disaster period to restore basic, safe \naccess.  Activities  included  clearing  of  landslides  and  debris,  reinstatement  of  washed-out \napproaches to bridges and wet crossings, and temporary road pavement repairs.  \n \n3.  Component B: Civil Works. The Project will finance the following civil works: \n(i)  rehabilitation of about 8 kilometers (km) of main sealed highway, restoring the \nbituminous sealed surface and upgrading the pavement structure, as required for \na design life of 20 years; \n(ii)  repairs  to  landslips  on  major  roads  incorporating  appropriate  geotechnical \ninvestigation and design recommendations; \n(iii)  rehabilitation  of  secondary  roads  including  re-graveling  of  about  50  km  of \nunsealed roads, reconstruction of 30 culverts, and reconstruction or lengthening \nof washed out wet crossings;  \n(iv)  miscellaneous repairs to water supplies; and \n(v)  repairs to agricultural drainage schemes. \n \n4.  Rehabilitation subprojects will be subject to investigation and design criteria, though a \nrange of engineering solutions will be considered. Assessments will include analysis of least-\ncost alternatives, including full life cycle costs, potential environmental impact, and sustainability \nto natural hazards. \n \nB.  Subproject Eligibility Criteria \n5.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Project supports the Fiji Islands\u2019 poverty reduction objective of ensuring that all categories of the poor are able to meet \ntheir basic needs, with a specific objective of reducing the proportion of the population below the poverty line from 34.4% to \n24%, as set out in the Fiji Islands Sustainable Economic and Empowerment Development Strategy 2008\u20132010.a There is no \ncountry partnership strategy for the Fiji Islands.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1.   Key Issues  \nThe Project will directly benefit the rural population in affected areas, many of whom are poor. The Project will contribute to \nthe country\u2019s efforts to reduce poverty by reinstating people\u2019s access to local and provincial markets for agricultural products, \nthereby restoring income-generation opportunities, and by safeguarding public health. \n \n2.  Design Features \nThe Project will involve activities spread throughout a large part of the country, which will bring benefits to many communities. \nThe subproject eligibility criteria include assessment of the subproject\u2019s contribution to employment of local communities and \ncontractors for maintenance and small-scale works, and to the restoration of incomes among poor and rural households. \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending \nNot applicable.  \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe floods directly affected more than 200,000 people, with a total loss of life of 12. Temporary displacement during and \nimmediately after the flooding was extensive\u2014164 houses were destroyed and an additional 1,677 houses were damaged in \nWestern Division. The total value of housing loss and damage is estimated at $0.9 million. The loss of household items and \npersonal belongings, clothes, and records and documents was significant. Many lost all they had. Food gardens were washed \naway, resulting in immediate hardship for households relying on their own produce for their food supply, and in economic loss \nfor those relying on selling surplus produce. The immediate rise in the price of basic foods had an impact not only on people \nin the flood-affected areas, but across the Fiji Islands. In the immediate aftermath and in the longer-term recovery phase, \npeople experienced life with no water or interrupted water supply, poor sanitation, and impassable and damaged roads, \nmaking access to markets and services difficult. All who experienced the floods would have suffered some degree of stress. \n \nIt can be assumed that at least one-third of the flood-affected population was living in poverty and would have had little or no \ncapacity to withstand the economic shock of the flood. The floods probably have worsened the situation of those already living \nbelow the poverty line. The floods have likely increased the vulnerability to poverty for those previously above the poverty line. \nFood price increases after the flood would have had the most severe impact on the poor, who are most likely to rely on \nsubsistence gardens for their own consumption. About 54% of low-income Fijian families provide a substantial proportion \n(more than 40%) of their own food. During the flood and immediately after, those directly affected by the flood were not able to \nengage in any economic activity for some weeks. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 8  43 \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. A damage and needs \nassessment was carried out jointly with officials of the World Bank. Consultations were held with with the Government, \nincluding  the  ministries  of  Finance  and  National  Planning,  Works,  Transport  and  Public  Utilities,  Agriculture,  Health, \nEducation,  and  Local  Government.  Consultations  were  held  with  development  partners,  relevant  United  Nations \norganizations,  the  South  Pacific  Applied  Geoscience  Commission  and  Non-Government  organizations.  In  the  field, \nconsultations were held with the business community, farmers organizations and town councils. \n \n2.

Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nNo C&P plan was prepared as the Project was prepared under the ADB's Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy (2004), \nwhich allows abbreviated procedures for project preparation in the interest of urgent response. \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.   Key Issues. According to analysis of data from the 2002\u20132003 household income and expenditure survey, households \nhead by women are more likely to be among the poorest households. Further, a disproportionate number of children live in \npoor households headed by women. Households headed by women account for 12.7% of all households; in the lowest two \ndeciles of average household income per capita, they account for 15.9% and 14.5%, respectively. In terms of population, \n10.8% of the total population live in households headed by women and 2.9% of all children live in such households. However, \nin the lowest two deciles of average household income per capita, households headed by women account for 16.9% and \n14.1%, respectively. Of the children living in households headed by women, 20.4% and 17.9% respectively are in the two \nlowest income deciles. \n \nIn the flooded areas, vegetable and market gardens suffered considerable damage, and markets were closed for several \nweeks. Road damage prevented access to markets for varying periods of time after the waters receded. Root crop staples, \nsuch as cassava, taro, and sweet potato, are intolerant to flooding and were badly damaged in flooded and poorly drained \nareas. This led to food shortages in the villages, and scarcity and high prices in the markets, for 3 months following the floods. \nWomen grow vegetables for subsistence and sale at local markets. On vegetable farms, women work with their families in the \nfields. Particularly in poor and disadvantaged households, women work as laborers for other farmers. The Project will restore \naccessibility to markets and jobs for women. \n \n2. Key Actions.

Description of Project \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Government of the Fiji Islands have agreed \non  an  emergency  assistance  loan  to  support  infrastructure  rehabilitation  required  following \nflooding in January 2009, the worst flooding in the country's. \n2.  The impact of the Project will be reduced economic losses and social disruption from \nfuture extreme weather. The outcome will be the restoration of economic and social activities in \naffected areas to pre-disaster levels. The rehabilitation of damaged roads is expected to restore \naccessibility to rural areas and allow a resumption of economic activities and social services. \nRestoration of water facilities will safeguard public health. \n  2.  Project Components \n \n3.  Component A: Repairs in the Emergency Response Phase. The Project will finance \neligible expenditures incurred during the immediate post-disaster period to restore basic, safe \naccess.  Activities  included  clearing  of  landslides  and  debris,  reinstatement  of  washed-out \napproaches to bridges and wet crossings, and temporary road pavement repairs. \n \n4.  Component B: Civil works. The Project will finance the following civil works: \n(i)  Rehabilitation of about 8 kilometers (km) of main sealed highway, restoring the \nbituminous sealed surface and upgrading the pavement structure, as required for \na design life of 20 years. \n(ii)  Repairs  to  landslips  on  major  roads  incorporating  appropriate  geotechnical \ninvestigation and design recommendations. \n(iii)  Rehabilitation  of  secondary  roads,  including  re-graveling  of  about  50  km  of \nunsealed roads, reconstruction of 30 culverts, and reconstruction or lengthening \nof washed-out wet crossings. Designs will enhance resilience against extreme \nweather by incorporating appropriate climate proofing measures, including large \ncritical drainage structures and provision of scour protection for bridges and wet \ncrossings. \n(iv)  Miscellaneous repairs to water supplies. \n(v)  Repairs  to  agricultural  drainage  schemes.  The  Land  and  Water  Resource \nManagement Division has prepared a detailed plan for rehabilitation of flood-\ndamaged  drainage  schemes  in  all  three  divisions  (Western,  Central,  and \nNorthern). Works will be undertaken to (a) clear waterways, (b) repair damaged \nseawalls and dykes, (c) repair and protect scoured drains and culverts, and (d) \nrepair floodgates. The plan is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n5.  Component C: Consulting services. The Project will finance consulting services for \ndesign  and  supervision  of  implementation,  and  for  strengthening  the  Environmental \nManagement Unit (EMU) of Ministry of Works, Transport and Public Utilities (MWTPU). \n \n3.  Purpose of the Resettlement Framework \n6.  This resettlement framework has been prepared to guide resettlement planning for the \nproject and to ensure that the resettlement impacts of all subprojects are identified, mitigated, \n ", "  Appendix 9  47 \nand compensated in accordance with acts and policy of the Government and ADB\u2019s Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995). The resettlement framework provides \n \n(i)  a  brief  description  of  the  overall  Project,  the  purpose  of  the  resettlement \nframework  and  plans,  and  the  likely  scope  of  the  resettlement  effects  of \nsubprojects; \n(ii)  the policy and legal framework of the Government and ADB with regard to land \nacquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement,  and  a  brief  review  of  resettlement \nexperiences in the Fiji Islands;  \n(iii)  the resettlement and compensation principles and entitlements to be applied to \nall subprojects under the Project;  \n(iv)  an outline of procedures to be followed for the preparation and implementation of \nresettlement plans; and  \n(v)  institutional,  administrative,  resourcing,  and  financing  arrangements  for \npreparation, approval, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of resettlement \nplans. \n \n7.  The resettlement framework will be distributed (translated into Fijian and Hindi by the \nexecuting  authority1  if  required)  to  the  affected  communities,  central  and  local  agencies, \ncompanies and agencies contracted to carry out design and works of the subprojects, and any \nother individuals responsible for aspects of subproject preparation and implementation.2 The \nframework will also be disclosed on the ADB resettlement website immediately upon ADB Board \napproval. The resettlement framework should be read in conjunction with ADB\u2019s Handbook on \nResettlement: A Guide to Good Practice,3 and the relevant Government acts and guidelines. \n  4.  Land Acquisition, Potential Impacts, and Types of Losses \n8.  The  rehabilitation  subprojects  are  not  expected  to  require  resettlement  or  land \nacquisition, as all works will be undertaken on existing facilities within existing rights-of-way. If \nchanges in conditions require land acquisition or resettlement for civil works, the Government \nwill inform ADB and prepare a resettlement plan according to relevant laws and regulations, this \nresettlement framework, and ADB guidelines. \n9.  Eligible subprojects will be identified for upgrading and rehabilitation using the following \ncriteria: (i) the subproject feasibility studies reflect need and high development priority of the \nGovernment; (ii) the minimum economic rate of return will be 12%; (iii) the proposed civil works \nwill not have any significant adverse effect on the environment; (iv) the proposed civil works will \nnot have any significant4 resettlement impact; and (v) land acquisition and resettlement plans (if \nneeded),  and  environmental  mitigation  plans,  will  be  prepared  and  other  social  issues \naddressed with action plans in accordance with ADB guidelines and the frameworks approved \nfor the Project, including this framework. \n10.  Land acquisition and resettlement impacts are not likely to occur as a result of the \nProject.  However,  if  conditions  change,  the  most  likely  impacts  are  associated  with  the \nupgrading of the damaged structures from their pre-flood state so they can withstand the \n                                                 \n1  The executing authority is the Ministry of National Planning. \n2  Project approval will include Government and ADB approval of a number of key project documents prepared during \nthe term of the project management team, including the finalized resettlement framework. \n3  ADB. 1998. Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice. Manila. \n4 In ADB terminology \u201csignificant\" means 200 or more persons will experience major impacts, which are defined as (i) \nbeing physically displaced from housing, or (ii) losing 10% or more of their productive assets (income generating).  \n ", "48  Appendix 9 \nincreased likelihood of future disasters and natural hazards. These upgrades may require that \nacquisition of margins on the borders of the existing sites. If the acquisition of land is necessary, \nthe entitlement matrix in section D of this framework sets out the compensation for such losses \nto  affected  persons.  Compensation  will  relate  to  matters  such  as  physical  relocation  of \nsecondary structures, unanticipated loss of structures or other loss due to unforeseen impacts, \nand the loss of crops and trees. All physical relocation and the destruction of primary structures \ncan and will be avoided. \n11.  All known grave sites in the subproject areas will be avoided. If graves are discovered, \nthe Project will ensure that relocation processes are acceptable to any relatives and to local \ncommunities. The Department of National Roads has established acceptable protocols for the \nrelocation  of  graves.  These  procedures  were  used  for  the  Third  Road  Upgrading  (Sector) \nProject (FRUP III)5 and will continue to be applied. \n12.  No  subprojects  that  might  be  classed  as  requiring  significant  resettlement  or  the \ndestruction  of  primary  structures  will  be  funded,  and  an  assurance  in  this  regard  will  be \nincorporated into the Loan Agreement. \nB.  Objectives of Resettlement Plans \n13.  ADB\u2019s resettlement policy states that if the screening or social assessment determines \nthat people will experience resettlement impacts a resettlement plan is required.6 It needs to be \na time-bound action plan with appropriate budget provisions, and should be incorporated as an \nintegral part of project design.7 Involuntary resettlers are people of any age, skill level, or \nsocioeconomic circumstance who have been requested to give up land or assets for a project. \nUnder ADB policy, these people require assistance to reestablish their home and/or livelihoods. \n14.  The policy requires that a plan be prepared that sets out all of the compensation and \nrehabilitation support to be provided to any person, family, or household that, because of the \nexecution of the project, would have his, her or their \n(i)  standard of living adversely affected; \n(ii)  right,  title,  or  interest  in  any  house,  or  interest  in  or  right  to  use  any  land \n(including  premises,  agricultural  and  grazing  land,  commercial  properties, \ntenancy, or right in annual or perennial crops and trees, or any other fixed or \nmoveable assets) acquired or possessed, temporarily or permanently; \n(iii)  income-earning opportunities, business, occupation, work, or place of residence \nor habitat adversely affected temporarily or permanently; or \n(iv)  social and cultural activities and relationships adversely affected.  \n \n15.  The objective of the resettlement plan is to provide a strategy for providing project-\naffected  persons  with  (i)  compensation  for  lost  land;  (ii)  replacements  for  lost  secondary \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 1997.

Business  assistance  might  include  access  to  credit,  site  selection,  labor \narrangements, training in a related or new skill, and a training allowance. The objective is to \nensure that affected persons are not left in a position where they are worse off with the project \nthan without it. Thus, in accordance with ADB policy, resettlement plans\u2014either full or short, \ndepending on the magnitude of impacts\u2014will be prepared for all subprojects that require land \nacquisition or create resettlement impacts.  \nC.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Policy Framework \n  1.  A Brief Review of Land Acquisition Laws \n16.  About 90% of land in the Fiji Islands is owned by native Fijians and is termed native \nland. Of the remainder, about 8% is freehold and the Government owns the balance of 2%. Of \nthe native land, nearly 64% is non-reserve and 34% is reserve land.9  \n17.  Native land is communally owned and cannot be bought or sold. The Native Land Trust \nBoard (NLTB) is the statutory body with the responsibility to administer, develop, and manage \nthis land on behalf of its owners and for their benefit.10 The NLTB identifies the land required for \nuse by traditional Fijian communities and makes the remainder available for leasing. The NLTB, \nnot the owners, issues the legally binding leases, which can be for agricultural, commercial, \nindustrial, or other uses. \n18.  All farmers of native land are either tenants or landowners farming with the permission of \ntheir own landowning clan. Some of these may have formalized their status by leasing the land, \nand have become tenants. Other tenant farmers will be either Fijians from other islands or parts \nof Viti Levu, or Indo Fijians. No distinction is made regarding race or community membership. \n19.  The Agricultural Landlord and Tenant Act (ALTA) governs all agricultural leases of more \nthan 1 hectare (ha) and the relations between landlords and agricultural tenants.11 Minimum 30-\nyear and maximum 99-year leases are allowed with no right of renewal. In practice, most leases \nare for 30 years. In the event of non-renewal, the tenant must vacate the land after a grace \nperiod. \n20.  The maximum annual rental is 6% of the unimproved capital value. In theory, the rental \nrate is reviewed every 5 years. The tenant can claim compensation for all development and \nimprovements of the property with claims determined by the Agricultural Tribunal. However, \ntenants can be compensated only for improvements if the NTLB has granted prior approval for \nthese improvements. In practice, lease rental rates are on a fixed schedule under the ALTA, and \nit has not been updated since 1997. The NLTB has introduced a lump sum payment to induce \n                                                 \n8  All primary structures can and will be avoided. Primary structures are considered to be buildings used as \nresidences, shops or buildings for community purposes (schools, clinics, churches, mosques or temples) and those \nused as principal places of work. Secondary structures are considered to be sheds, animal pens, out-houses, \nfences, etc. \n9  Reserve land, is land not leased, but reserved by Mataqali and/or Government for future use.

The ALTA can be amended only by a two-thirds majority in both upper and lower houses \nof Parliament. However, the requirement for tenants to vacate land once the fixed lease and \ngrace period have expired causes both social and economic hardship. With this in mind, the \nNTLB has proposed an alternative lease arrangement, envisaging a 50-year rolling lease with \nprovision for a review after 25-years to consider a further 25-year extension. Thus, the tenant \nfarmer would be given a minimum 25 years notice of non-renewal. A market-based rental \nsystem, as agreed to by the landlord and tenant (rather than imposed by legislation) and linked \nto the productivity of the land might also be introduced. Fair-market-oriented reviews could then \nalso be based on the system agreed on by the landlord and tenant.  \n22.  Land acquisition in the Fiji Islands is made under the State Acquisition of Lands Act13 \n(SALA) Under the act, all types of land can be acquired for public purposes. The law provides \nthat  in  cases  of  land  acquired  for  public  purposes,  legal  titleholders  have  a  right  to \ncompensation. The law also provides for the right of landowners to legal proceedings for solving \ndisputes and grievances. The customary rights of indigenous peoples without formal title are \nalso protected. \n23.  The  SALA  guarantees  cash  compensation  to  those  with  recognized  legal  rights  or \ninterests in land. Compensation is paid at market values effective from the date at which notice \nof the state\u2019s intention to acquire the land is given. However, structures are compensated only \nat book or depreciated values. Compensation covers land, crops and trees, damage to portions \nof land not acquired (if any), changes in use and restrictions on use of any  portions not \nacquired\u2014and any reasonable expenses associated with necessary changes of residence or \nplaces of business. \n24.  In some areas, however, local market prices and the prices overseas investors are \nwilling to pay differ significantly. For example, in Taveuni and around Savusavu, for roads \nconstructed under the FRUPIII, the affected freehold landowners requested about F$200,000 \nper ha price\u2014the current price obtained from overseas investors. The Department of Lands and \nSurvey (DLS), applying local market prices, assessed the market value at F$15,000 per ha. \nWith the expected growth in demand from overseas investors, new values in certain areas need \nto  be  recognized.  These  new  values  would  derive  from  recent  sales  prices  to  overseas \ninvestors. \n25.  SALA  and  its  regulations  also  do  not  require  compensation  payments  to  affected \npersons who have no recognized legal right or interest in the land. Compensation is required \nonly on a depreciated or book value basis for structures. Therefore, informal sharecroppers and \nsquatters are not entitled to any kind of compensation. People without titles are not entitled to \ncompensation for land. However, to comply fully with ADB\u2019s resettlement policy, all people \nwithout  titles  who  are  affected  by  the  project  will  be  entitled  to  compensation  for  loss  of \nstructures, crops, trees, or incomes they derive from land, regardless of whether they have \nformal title to the land. Adequate provisions for such have been included in the entitlement \nmatrix. \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2005. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of the Fiji Islands for Alternative Livelihoods Development Project. Manila (March, pages 29\u201330). \n13 Originally the Crown Acquisition of Lands Act, 1940, it was subsequently amended by ordinance Nos. 24 of 1940, \n11 of 1942, 15 of 1943, 9 of 1955; orders of January 1967 and October 1970; and Act of Parliament (Act No. 1 of \n1998). Laws of Fiji, Chapter 135. \n ", "  Appendix 9  51 \n26.  In addition, SALA does not provide relocation sites or assistance for the rehabilitation of \nadversely affected people. Since an express objective of the Project is to minimize, if not avoid, \nthe need for physical relocation, the development of resettlement sites will not be needed under \nthe Project. The law also does not provide for any special mitigation measures for vulnerable \ngroups  or  the  poorest  section  of  the  adversely  affected.  The  entitlement  matrix  includes \nprovisions  to  ensure  that  vulnerable  and  disadvantaged  people  are  given  opportunities  to \nimprove their living standards. \n27.  However, the SALA does not prevent the Government from providing assistance to \npeople adversely affected by the Project, including those having no legal title or interest in land. \nIn FRUP III, for example, the Government agreed to ensure that Public Works Department \nwould fully comply with the Government\u2019s existing policies and procedures for compulsory land \nacquisition  established  in  SALA;  and  also  with  ADB\u2019s  resettlement  policy,  which  covered \ncompensation for holders without titles and various other kinds of assistance. \n2.  ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy Requirements \n28.  ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy addresses both (i) social and economic impacts, \npermanent or temporary, caused by acquisition of land and other fixed assets; and (ii) changes \nin the use of land or restrictions imposed on land as a result of an ADB operation. An affected \nperson is one who experiences such impacts. The objectives of the policy are (i) to avoid \ninvoluntary  resettlement  wherever  feasible;  (ii)  to  minimize  resettlement  where  population \ndisplacement is unavoidable by choosing alternative viable project options; and (iii) where \ninvoluntary  resettlement is unavoidable, to ensure that affected people receive assistance, \npreferably under the project, so that they will be at least as well off as they would have been \nwithout the project. \n29.  Where involuntary resettlement is unavoidable, the policy is designed to include any \nresulting losses in project budgets. Therefore, ADB\u2019s policy calls for minimum land acquisition to \nminimize or eliminate the need for any involuntary resettlement. In determining compensation \nwhen resettlement is unavoidable, ADB policy insists on replacement value of lost assets.14 \nWhile such principles can be used to value structures, it is difficult to apply these principles to \nland, crops, and trees. However, current market prices as collated by the Lands Registry can be \napplied to land, and the schedules of rates for crops and trees as regularly published by the \nMinistry of Agriculture and Primary Industries. \n30.  Another principle of ADB\u2019s policy is to cover all categories of adversely affected persons \nirrespective of their legal status. \n31.  ADB policy to avoid and/or minimize resettlement is focused on (i) consultation with the \npotentially impacted people during project planning and implementation, including disclosure of \nresettlement  plans  and  other  project-related  information;  (ii)  payment  of  compensation  for \nacquired  assets  at  market  or  replacement  values;  (iii)  compensation  and  resettlement \nassistance to all categories of affected people, including those without titles such as informal \ndwellers  and  squatters,  or  encroachers;  (iv)  special  provision  of  assistance  for  vulnerable \ngroups, such as families headed by women, ethnic minorities, indigenous groups and tribes \n(particularly for the latter); (v) adequate provision for income restoration and generation; and (vi) \na  rehabilitation  program.  This  is  to  be  achieved  by  the  implementation  of  a  time-bound \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2003. Operations Manual. OM Section F2/BP: Involuntary Resettlement. Manila. \n ", "52  Appendix 9 \nresettlement plan in accordance with ADB's Handbook of Resettlement: A Guide to Good \nPractice. \n \n32.  ADB  policy  also  seeks  to  protect  sites  of  historical  and  archaeological  importance, \nenvironmental habitats (e.g., bird sanctuary, flora and fauna, parks), places of worships, and \ngraveyards. Therefore, project planners will design the Project to avoid such places. \n33.

State Acquisition of Lands Act, para 12 (a) (ii). \nSource: Government of the Fiji Islands. \n \n3.  Project Land Acquisition and Resettlement Policy \n34.  The basic resettlement principles proposed for the project are: \n(i)  Involuntary resettlement and loss of primary structures can and will be avoided. \n(ii)  Loss  of  secondary  structures,  other  assets, and  incomes  will  be  avoided  or \nminimized by exploring all viable options. \n(iii)  All affected persons are entitled to compensation for all lost and affected assets, \nincomes, and business assets at replacement cost and will be provided with \nrehabilitation  measures  sufficient  to  assist  them  in  improving  or  at  least \nmaintaining  their  pre-project  living  standards,  incomes,  and  productive \ncapacity.15\n(iv)  Lack of legal rights to the assets lost or adversely affected will not bar affected \npersons from entitlement to such compensation and rehabilitation measures.16  \n                                                 \n15 Where people are significantly affected by the loss of assets, incomes and employment, compensation solely for \nlost assets may not be adequate to restore their economic and social base. Such people will be entitled to \nrehabilitation assistance for restoring livelihoods, incomes and living standards. \n16 People without legal rights are referred to as \"non-titled\" in the Operations Manual, and include those who have no \nrecognizable rights or claims to the land that they are occupying and/or using. Restoration measures must be \ndetermined  in  consultation  with  affected  communities,  including  \u201cthose  people  who  might  not  be  formally \nrecognized in national legislation.\u201d \n ", "54  Appendix 9 \n(v)  If changes in conditions require land acquisition or resettlement for one of the \nsubprojects, preparation of resettlement plans and their implementation will be \ncarried out with participation and consultation of all affected people.  \n(vi)  Compensation for affected assets will be provided at replacement cost.17\n(vii)  An  implementation  schedule  and  budget  for  resettlement  planning  (including \nsocioeconomic survey and/or census) and implementation will be incorporated \ninto any subproject that reveals a need for resettlement, and will be incorporated \ninto the overall Project. \n(viii)  Agreements on compensation must be completed before land or other assets are \ntaken over by a subproject. \n(ix)  Compensation  for  vulnerable  households  will  aim  to  improve  their  livelihood \nrather than merely reestablishing their levels of poverty or marginalization, and \nwill be carried out with respect for their cultural values and needs. \n \n35.  An assurance will be attached to the Loan Agreement requiring the Government to \ncomply with the provisions of (i) the SALA, (ii) ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy, and (iii) \nprovisions and entitlements set out in this resettlement framework. \n36.  The additional compensation required under ADB's Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide \nto Good Practice18 and not otherwise paid will be (i) the compensation to people who do not \nhold titles such as squatters and sharecroppers, (ii) the compensation for any loss of livelihood, \nand (iii) full replacement value for secondary structures. This additional compensation, as and \nwhen  required,  will  be  paid  from  a  resettlement  budget  and  will  be  administered  by  a \nresettlement liaison officer (RLO) that will be established within the Ministry of Works, Transport \nand Public Utilities (MWTPU). The RLO will be set up before project implementation if a need \nfor resettlement emerges. In addition, a provision for unanticipated lost structures of various \ntypes should be included in this budget in case there are unforeseen impacts in any subproject. \nFor the same reason, a provision for the general a category of \u201cunanticipated impact\u201d should \nalso be included. These categories of compensation are included in the entitlement matrix in \nsection D. \n37.  The MWTPU and the Land and Water Resource Management Division in the Ministry of \nAgriculture and Primary Industries will not be able to take possession of land until the price \nnegotiation is complete, and will not be able to take possession of leased land without the \nconsent of the lessees. \n38.  The standard DLS procedure (which will be followed during the Project) is to prepare \ninitial valuations using local market prices, and data in this regard is obtained from the Land \nRegistrar\u2019s office. Finally determined prices, nonetheless, come about through negotiation. For \nland, 75% of the finally agreed price is paid in advance pending completion of the measurement \n                                                 \n17 Replacement cost means the replacement of lost assets and income. For land, it means the cost of buying or \nleasing replacement land with equal productive value and potential near the lost land plus the cost of preparing the \nland to levels similar to those of the affected land and cost of registration and taxes. For structure, it means current \nmarket value of building materials and labor without deduction for depreciation and/or any materials salvaged. For \ncrops and trees, it means current market value based on economic production, age, and type. Where national law \ndoes not meet the standard for providing replacement cost, it will be supplemented as necessary. In the absence of \nfunctioning markets, a compensation structure is required that enables affected people to restore their livelihoods \nto levels at least equivalent to those maintained at the time of dispossession, displacement, or restricted access.  \n18 ADB. 1998. Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice. Manila. \n ", "  Appendix 9  55 \nprocess, which occurs after construction is finished. Owners and lessees will be compensated \nfor lost income, standing crops, and other losses during construction also at the time of final \nmeasurement and at rates set by the Department of Agriculture.19 These procedures have \nadvantages in the Fiji Islands (para. 42) and will be continued. \n39.  Under current Government provisions, 100% of the value of structures (but only the \ndepreciated  book  value)  is  paid  at  the  same  time  as  the  initial  75%  for  land.  Secondary \nstructures  (if  any),  which  are  the  only  types  of  structure  that  will  be  affected,  will  be \ncompensated at replacement cost without depreciation or deduction for any salvaged materials. \n40.  For project resettlement issues, the only relevant differences between the Fiji Islands \nGovernment and ADB policy concern (i) the payment of 75% rather than 100% of agreed \ncompensation for land before work begins, (ii) the non-completion of any final transfer of the \nland to Government until the work is complete, (iii) the depreciated value paid on structures, and \n(iv) the lack of compensation provided to squatters. The Government system, with regard to \npoints  (i)  and  (ii),  has  the  advantage  of  allowing  easy  adjustments  during  construction  to \naccount for remedying cut slope instability, minor cut widening to obtain suitable fill material, \nand so forth.20 It was successful during FRUP III and should continue. Other policy differences \nwill be resolved by the assurance referred to in para. 36. \n41.  This land acquisition and resettlement framework has been prepared based on the \nfollowing legal and policy requirements: (i) SALA of the Fiji Islands, (ii) ADB's Operations \nManual: Bank Policies (BP): Involuntary Resettlement (F2/BP) and Operational Procedures \n(OP): Involuntary Resettlement (F2/OP), (iii) ADB's Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to \nGood Practice, and (iv) the information included in this document. \nD.  Entitlement Matrix \n42.  An entitlement matrix has been prepared to cover all anticipated potential impacts and \nlosses that could be created by the Project. \n43.  Potential  losses  include  loss  of  different  categories  of  land:  residential,  agricultural, \ncommercial and forest land; crops; trees; structures; and incomes. A summary of losses and \nentitlements is provided in Table A9.2.  \nTable A9.2: Summary of Losses and Entitlements \n \nTypes of Losses  Entitlements \nLoss of Land   \nAll land temporarily affected (less than 1 year)  For owner, rent for 1 year, land restored to pre-project \ncondition.

Farmers will often be allowed to harvest their crops at the \nproper time before the land is taken. \n20 Delays because of the Government system are rare, though occasionally, formal advance acquisition would have \nprevented a delay. On previous projects, the majority of delays in rural areas have been minor (and illegal as the \nlandowner will have given consent to the purchase in writing). If completion of land acquisition procedures before \ncontract award is insisted upon, more delays could occur.

The resettlement plans will identify the types and magnitudes of losses, persons, and/or \norganizations  entitled  to  compensation  and  the  value  of  their  entitlements,  institutional \narrangements for payments (including grievance redress), mechanisms for the implementation \nof the plan, and mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation, both internal and external, by \nproject  management.  Budget  estimates  will  be  made  to  meet  the  costs  involved  in  the \npreparation and implementation of the resettlement plan. In addition, the plans will include an \nentitlement matrix showing losses, entitled persons, and their entitlements and implementation \nissues. \n46.  The subprojects are not expected to require resettlement or land acquisition, as all works \nwill be undertaken on existing facilities within existing rights-of-way. If during the detailed design \nof the subprojects or during the DMS it is determined that land acquisition or resettlement will be \nnecessary, the PMT will inform ADB and prepare a resettlement plan according to relevant laws \nand regulations, this resettlement framework, and ADB guidelines. \nE.  Public Consultation and Disclosure \n47.  Information dissemination to, consultation with, and participation of affected persons and \ninvolved agencies maintain transparency of the Project, reduce potential conflicts, minimize the \nrisk of project delays, and enable the Project to design the resettlement and the rehabilitation \nprogram as a comprehensive development program to suit the needs and priorities of the \naffected  persons.  The  actions  that  need  to  be  undertaken  for  inclusive  participation  in \nresettlement planning are as follows: \n(i)  identification of stakeholders who will be involved in resettlement planning and \nimplementation  (affected  persons,  local  officials,  local  communities  at \nresettlement sites as required, project authorities, elected officials, approving and \nimplementing agencies, and nongovernment organizations); \n(ii)  dissemination of information (including project entitlements) and identification of \nappropriate mechanisms for feedback and facilitating the consultation process; \nand \n(iii)  identification of a grievance redress mechanism and procedure. \n1.  Consultation during Plan Preparation and Implementation \n48.  During the initial resettlement plan preparation, a socioeconomic survey, key informant \ninterviews,  and  informal  meetings  with  severely  affected  persons  and  stakeholders  will  be \ncarried  out.  Where  possible,  this  process  will  begin  with  a  meeting  with  the  village  and \nsettlement leaders adjacent to the areas where the civil works are to be carried out as well as \nalong  any  feeder  roads  to  the  civil  works  areas.  These  meetings  will  provide  subproject \nbackground and relevant details. Meetings will then be held with officers from the NLTB before \nany other public meetings, one-on-one interviews with affected persons, or the start of any \ninventory of losses. \n ", "  Appendix 9  59 \n49.  In updating of the plans (based on the detailed design), further consultation, a local \ncensus, a DMS, and participation will be undertaken by the Project Management Team to \nensure that information on the overall Project and the subprojects' objectives, implementation \nschedule, resettlement and land acquisition, eligibility, and compensation issues are properly \nunderstood  and  accepted  by  the  affected  communities.  The  DMS  will  be  undertaken  in \ncollaboration with the affected persons. The cutoff date for entitlement eligibility shall be the \ndate of commencement of the census in regard to the final resettlement plan. \n50.  Following mobilization of the project supervision consultant, and if detailed subproject \ndesign confirms that land acquisition and/or resettlement will be necessary, a resettlement \nworkshop will be held for the land acquisition officers (assigned staff of MWTPU) and other staff \nof government departments or agencies that have a role in land acquisition and resettlement. \nThe workshop will include seminars and participant exercises on the following topics: (i) the \noverall Project, (ii) Government and updated ADB policy and procedures on land acquisition, (iii) \nthe project resettlement framework, (iv) likely project impacts and the entitlements that flow from \nthem,  (v)  establishment  of  compensation  rates,  (vi)  proposed  resettlement  strategies,  (vii) \npreparation of resettlement plans, (viii) budget and costs, (ix) tentative implementation schedule, \n(x) implementation of the plan, and (xi) monitoring. The workshop will include question and \nanswer sessions to allow participants to share their experiences with resettlement on other \nprojects. \n51.  Detailed consultations individually and/or in small groups with severely affected women \nwho head households and other vulnerable households will be carried out to determine their \nspecific requirements and preferences for rehabilitation assistance. To facilitate this effort, the \nfollowing will be undertaken: \n(i)  Separate  consultations  will  be  held  with  women  and  vulnerable  groups  to \nencourage their participation in resettlement planning and implementation. \n(ii)  Consultations with women and vulnerable groups will take into consideration the \nfollowing issues: (a) timing of consultations to accord with people\u2019s daily and \nseasonal  responsibilities  and  availability;  and  (b)  communications  methods \nappropriate to people\u2019s literacy levels and/or local languages. \n2.  Information Disclosure \n52.  If land acquisition or resettlement is necessary, a series of meetings will be held with the \naffected persons, DLS, NLTB, district officers, village chiefs, and other relevant agencies. These \nmeetings will ensure that the affected persons and stakeholders of the affected areas fully \nunderstand the details of the resettlement plan, compensation, and rehabilitation measures \napplicable to the Project. These meetings will convey the following information: \n \n(i)  brief description of the Project and subproject, \n(ii)  types of impacts expected, \n(iii)  basic compensation policy and entitlements,  \n(iv)  outline of livelihood restoration measures, \n(v)  consultation  and  participation  opportunities  for  affected  persons  and  their \ncommunity, \n(vi)  implementation schedule, and \n(vii)  who to contact for additional information. \n \n ", "60  Appendix 9 \n53.  If  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  is  necessary,  the  resettlement  plan  and \nimplementation schedule will also be posted in affected districts and project offices. These \npostings will be updated whenever adjustments to the plans are made. These activities will \ncontinue  throughout  the  implementation  of  the  subproject.  In  addition,  press  releases  to \nnewspapers and the electronic media will be made the consultation process starts. \n54.  ADB\u2019s  disclosure  requirements  also  mean  that  the  framework  will  be  disclosed  to \naffected  persons  before  appraisal,  and  that  the  framework  and  plans  prepared  for  any \nsubproject  roads  will  be  available  on  ADB\u2019s  website  once  they  have  been  approved  or \nendorsed. The complete resettlement framework and plans, including all appendixes prepared \nfor the core subprojects, will be made available at district offices or any local project offices \nbefore appraisal. \n55.  The resettlement plans for the subprojects and any subsequent revisions to the plans \nprepared  after  detailed  design  will  also  be  disclosed  to  affected  persons  (including  DMS, \ndetailed  asset  valuations,  entitlements,  special  provisions,  grievance  procedures,  timing  of \npayments, and implementation schedule) before submission to ADB for review and approval. \n56.  In  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy  (2005),  ADB  will  upload  the \nresettlement framework and plans on the ADB resettlement website as follows: \n \n(i)  the draft resettlement plan and framework before appraisal, \n(ii)  the final resettlement plan upon receipt of the final resettlement plan, and \n(iii)  the revised resettlement plan upon receipt of a revised resettlement plan. \n3.  Grievance Redress Mechanisms \n57.  Care shall be taken to prevent grievances rather than going through a redress system, \nand grievances will be minimized through careful subproject design and implementation by (i) \nensuring full and frank participation and consultation with affected persons; (ii) establishing \nrapport between the community and MWTPU through its project management unit; (iii) and \nensuring frequent interactions, transparency, and monitoring.  \n58.  A grievance mechanism will be established that will allow affected persons to appeal any \ndisagreeable decisions or practices arising from compensation for land and other assets, or to \nsettle any general subproject-related disputes. Affected persons will be made fully aware of their \nrights  and  the  procedures  for  making  a  grievance,  whether  verbally  or  in  writing,  during \nconsultation. The Project has the potential for two types of grievances: grievances related to \nland acquisition and resettlement requirements; and grievances related to compensation or \nentitlement. \n59.  A grievance redress committee (GRC) will be established, chaired by the MWTPU public \nrelations officer. It will include a valuation officer from the DLS, and community leaders or \nrepresentatives of affected persons. The GRC will also include women and representatives of \nNLTB  and  Mataqali, 21   as  relevant,  to  reflect  the  composition  of  affected  persons  and \nbeneficiaries. \n60.  The GRC will deal with complaints relating to apportionment of compensation among \njoint owners, relocation issues, and unaddressed losses. It will not be empowered to challenge \n                                                 \n21 A clan is a group of people united by kinship and descent, which is defined by actual or perceived descent from a \ncommon ancestor. \n ", "  Appendix 9  61 \nthe legal entitlements of affected persons. Further, it will refrain from making decisions relating \nto design or engineering matters, or on any compensation matters that are pending before the \ncourts. \n61.  In the first instance, attempts will be made to settle the issues at the village level through \nconsultation  and  involvement  of  the  project  resettlement  specialists  (and  nongovernment \norganizations and mediators or facilitators) as required. Complaints that cannot be addressed at \nthis level may be presented to the GRC. \n62.  Affected persons will be exempted from all administrative and legal fees associated with \nresolving the grievance pursuant to the grievance redress procedure, except for cases filed in \ncourt by affected persons. \nF.  Procedure for Subproject Resettlement Plan and Budget \n63.  During project implementation, the MWTPU will be responsible for sending to the DLS a \nplan showing any land to be acquired for the purpose of the Project. The DLS will then be \nresponsible for the acquisition of this land. It will prepare the detailed land acquisition plans, \nidentify landowners, and undertake negotiations to reach an agreement on values. In the case \nof native land, the DLS will send the proposal to the NLTB, which will negotiate on behalf of the \nnative landowners. However, the Mataqali owning the land will have to accept or reject the \nNLTB recommendations. Land acquisition will be made in accordance with the provisions of the \nSALA. Thus, compensation will cover (i) land22 at fair market value; (ii) crops and trees; (iii) \nsecondary structures at replacement value; (iv) squatters and sharecroppers; (v) any other \ndamage caused during execution, if any; and (vi) any imposed changes in, or restrictions on, \nuse of remaining land following acquisition. In each case, compensation will be divided in a fair \nand equitable manner between lessee and lessor depending on present annual payments, the \nlength of the lease left to run, and the anticipated lease renewal premium. \n64.  Any subproject resettlement plans will be based on this resettlement framework and the \nentitlement matrix (Table A9.3). \n65.  Resettlement budgets will be prepared for each subproject that has resettlement needs. \nThese budgets will be based on the amounts of compensation required to cover all losses and \nimpacts, including (i) the costs of acquiring required land at market prices; (ii) compensation for \nlost crops and trees based on replacement and/or market values; (iii) lost income from the \ntemporary use of land for spoil; (iv) loss of traditional use rights and community properties and \nresources, compensated by replacement of similar common property resources or as cash \ncompensation  if  the  former  is  not  possible;  and  (v)  temporary  losses  as  a  result  of \nenvironmental impacts (for example, losses to crops from increased dust). Administration costs \nwill add about 20% to total costs. For physical contingencies, 10% has been allowed. \n \n66.  Budgets will be shown as the per unit costs required to cover replacement of all losses. \nG.  Organizational Arrangements and Institutional Responsibility  \n67.  The following are key organizations involved in the resettlement and compensation \nprocess: \n                                                 \n22 Land can be only acquired if it is intended to be made for public purposes. However, if some parcels become \neconomically unviable because they are separated from the original body and small, consideration should also be \ngiven to their purchase. \n ", "62  Appendix 9 \n(i)  The  MWTPU,  which  is  the  EA,  will  have  overall  control.  The  MWTPU \nresponsibilities are (a) identification of affected areas under their authority, (b) \ncommunity liaison, (c) budgetary provision, (d) administration of the PMU and its \nRLO; \n(ii)  The DLS will be responsible for (a) initial valuations, (b) identification of owners \nand leaseholders, and (c) negotiations with landowners. \n(iii)  The NLTB represents and negotiates on behalf of the Mataqali landowners, signs \nagreements on their behalf, and is responsible for securing the agreement of \n75% of Mataqali members before making such agreements. \n68.  The EA will forward outline plans to the DLS, which will negotiate and, with the DNR, pay \ncompensation. The NLTB will negotiate on behalf of the native landowners. \n69.  Resettlement and compensation following ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy will be \na new experience for project managers in the Fiji Islands. Therefore, it is important that officers \nin  the  DLS  and  EA  are  trained  in  ADB  requirements,  and  subproject-specific  tailored \nmanagement procedures are implemented as soon as possible if a need for resettlement is \nidentified during subproject design. An RLO will be established within MWTPU, which will \nensure that compensation is paid as required under ADB policy. A top-up resettlement budget \nwill be made available to the RLO to provide the additional compensation (if any) required by \nADB\u2019s Operations Manual, Involuntary Resettlement: Bank Policy (OM, F2/BP) and Involuntary \nResettlement: Operational Procedures (OM, F2/OP). \n70.  To expedite the acquisition process, continuous and early dialogue will be instituted \nbetween the land acquisition authorities and the owners. Only when consents of the owners, \nlessees, or other occupiers have been obtained and the initial payments have been made will \nthe land be turned over to the subprojects. \nH.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n71.  Monitoring will \n \n(i)  verify  that  project  activities  have  been  effectively  completed  with  respect  to \nquantity, quality, and timeliness; and \n(ii)  assess whether and how well these activities are achieving the stated goals and \npurpose of the Project. \n72.  Regular monitoring of the resettlement plan implementation will be conducted internally \nby the implementing agencies (EA, DLS and NLTB), as well as externally by an independent \nmonitoring organization, hired by the EA (para. 77). In carrying out all activities related to \nmonitoring, evaluation, and supervision, consideration will be given to gender issues in all of the \nabove, in accordance with the ADB Policy on Gender and Development, the Gender Checklist, \nand the Involuntary Resettlement Policy. \n1.  Internal Monitoring \n73.  Internal monitoring of the implementation of subproject resettlement plans will be the \nresponsibility of the implementing agencies, with the assistance of the project consultants. The \nimplementing  agencies  will  oversee  the  progress  in  resettlement  preparation  and \nimplementation through regular progress reports. \n ", "  Appendix 9  63 \n74.  The following indicators will be monitored regularly: \n \n(i)  payment of compensation to affected persons in various categories, according to \nthe  compensation  policy  described  in  the  resettlement  plan,  with  no \ndiscrimination according to gender, membership of ethnic group, or any other \nfactor; \n(ii)  delivery of technical assistance, relocation, payment of subsistence, and moving \nallowances (if appropriate); \n(iii)  delivery of income restoration and social support entitlements (if appropriate); \n(iv)  public information dissemination and consultation procedures; \n(v)  adherence  to  grievance  procedures  and  outstanding  issues  requiring \nmanagement\u2019s attention, and equality of access; \n(vi)  attention given to the priorities of affected persons regarding the options offered; \nand \n(vii)  coordination and completion of resettlement activities and award of civil works \ncontracts. \n \n75.  The MWTPU will maintain a database of resettlement monitoring information regarding \nthe Project, and will update it every month. Assisted by the project consultants, the MWTPU will \nsubmit to the ADB a monitoring report23 every 3 months on the progress of implementation of \nthe resettlement plan. The internal monitoring reports will cover the following issues: \n \n(i)  the number of affected persons by category of impact per component, and the \nstatus of compensation payment, relocation, and income restoration for each \ncategory; \n(ii)  the  amount  of  funds  allocated  for  operations  or  for  compensation,  and  the \namount of funds disbursed for each; \n(iii)  the eventual outcome of complaints and grievances, and any outstanding issues \nrequiring management or ADB\u2019s assistance; \n(iv)  implementation problems; and \n(v)  revised actual resettlement implementation schedule. \n \n2.    External Monitoring \n76.  The general objective of the external monitoring is to provide an independent periodic \nreview (every 6 months) and assessment of (i) the achievement of resettlement objectives; (ii) \nthe changes in living standards and livelihoods; (iii) the restoration of the economic and social \nbase of the affected people; (iv) the effectiveness, impact, and sustainability of entitlements; (v) \nthe need for further mitigation measures, if any; and (vi) strategic lessons for future policy \nformulation and planning. \n77.  In accordance with ADB requirements for consultant procurement, the MWTPU will hire \nan  organization  to  handle  independent  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  resettlement  plan \nimplementation. The independent monitoring organization (IMO) will be specialized in social \nsciences and experienced in resettlement monitoring. The IMO will start its work as soon as the \nupdated resettlement plan has been approved. \n78.  The IMO will monitor and evaluate the following indicators: \n \n                                                 \n23 As part of the DNR\u2019s regular quarterly progress report to ADB. \n ", "64  Appendix 9 \n(i)  payment of compensation; \n(ii)  coordination of resettlement activities with construction schedule, and provision \nfor technical assistance for house construction; \n(iii)  provision of allowances to all entitled affected persons; \n(iv)  facilitation  of    access  to  the  socioeconomic  support  program  and  income \nrestoration program, where relevant, according to the policies of the Project; \n(v)  public consultation and awareness of compensation policy; \n(vi)  restoration of productive activities; \n(vii)  the  level  of  satisfaction  of  affected  persons  with  various  aspects  of  the \nresettlement plan; and \n(viii)  trends in living standards. \n \n79.  The IMO will conduct an evaluation of the resettlement process and its impact between 6 \nand  12  months  after  completion  of  all  resettlement  activities,  using  the  same  survey \nquestionnaire and sample used during the monitoring activities. \nI.  Implementation Schedule \n80.  The implementation of resettlement and related activities will take place after the project \nsupervision consultant has been mobilized. The consultant will work closely with and assist the \nDNR in all resettlement and related activities. \n81.  Civil works contractors will be issued a notice of possession of site for any section of \nconstruction  works  only  when  the  MWTPU  has  (i)  satisfactorily  completed  compensation \npayments, in accordance with the approved relevant resettlement plan for that subproject; and \n(ii) ensured that the rehabilitation assistance is in place and the area required for civil works is \nfree of all encumbrances. \n82.  The plan implementation schedule (Table A9.4) envisages a sequence of activities. \nSome steps will overlap in their timing, and some will be repeated throughout the project \nschedule. \nTable A9.4: Implementation Schedule \n \nActivities  Timing \nMobilize project design consultant including resettlement specialist  Month 1 \nEstablish grievance committees   Month 1 \nBegin internal monitoring program (including monthly reporting)  Month 1 \nDistribute entitlement framework to affected persons and communities  Month 2 \nConsultation with local officials, affected persons, and concerned groups or departments  Month 2 \nContinue consultation, information dissemination, participation programs, and grievance \nOngoing \nresolutions \nBegin detailed site survey and design of subproject   Month 2 \nContract and mobilize independent monitoring organization  Month 3 \nConduct updated  detailed measurement survey (based on detailed design)  Month 4 \nFinalize list of entitled persons, replacement cost survey, and compensation rates  Month 4\u20135 \nBegin external monitoring program (baseline)  Month 5 & 6 \nSubmit updated plan to EA and ADB  Month 6 \nEA and ADB approval of updated plan  Month 6 \nPrepare and distribute copies of updated and approved resettlement plan  Month 6 \n ", "  Appendix 9  65 \nActivities  Timing \nDisclose approved resettlement plan on ADB\u2019s website    Month 6 \nDevelop resettlement site   Months 6\u201312 \nSubmit to local authorities for all clearances  Month 7(ongoing) \nEffect compensation payments and implement land transfer procedures  Month 9 (ongoing) \nEnsure appropriate advance evacuation notification (notice to clear construction area)  Month 9 (ongoing) \nIssue notice of possession of sites  Month 10 (ongoing) \nSubmit external monitoring report (on plan implementation) to ADB  Month 11 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, EA = executing agency. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20090828094234+08'00'", "Author": "GULEN ATAY", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 7.0.7 for Word", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0.5 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20090828161540+08'00'", "Company": "Licenced User", "SourceModified": "D:20090828014049", "Title": "Doc number"}, "author_page": "  \nVice-President  C.
