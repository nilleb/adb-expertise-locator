The focus is \n2. \non  improving  rural  transport  connectivity  and  community  infrastructure,  and  uplifting  the \nlivelihood of rural communities in 18 poor and remote hill and mountain districts of Nepal.2  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nNepal  is  a  landlocked  country  situated  between  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  in  the \n3. \nnorth  and  India  in  the  south,  east,  and  west.  The  road  networks  are  the  major  modes  of \ntransportation in the country because of its widespread mountainous terrain and difficult weather \nconditions.  Pervasive  poverty  in  the  hill  and  mountain  districts  is  linked  to  the  lack  of  road \nconnectivity  and  corresponding  high  transport  costs,  which  discourage  the  mobility  of  people, \nand  movement  of  goods  and  services  within  and  outside  the  regions.  The  majority  of \nsettlements  in hilly  and mountainous  areas  are not  accessible by motorized  vehicles;  they  are \ncut  off  from  the  road  network,  and  thus  face  constraints  of  limited  access  to  food  supplies, \nhealth  and  education  facilities,  and  other  essential  services.  In  these  areas,  rural  transport  is \nlargely based on a trail system of foot trails, mule tracks, and trail bridges. \n \n4. \nSince  1985,  the  Government  of  Nepal  has  made  considerable  progress  in  linking \nimportant  geographical  areas  of  Nepal  by  road  infrastructure,  aided  by  suitable  policies, \nlegislative  enactments,  and  guidelines.  Nepal\u2019s  road  network  increased  by  6.7%  a  year  from \n1995  to  2004,  with  rural  roads  growing  by  11%  a  year.  Despite  this  improvement,  the  rural \ntransport infrastructure in the country remains underdeveloped. Only 17% of the rural population \nhas access to an all-weather road, compared with 60% in India and 37% in Bangladesh. Road \ndensity is only 121 as against 1,838 in Bangladesh and 1,116 in India.3 Road density remains \nvery low in remote districts in the hills and mountain regions. \n  \nIn the 18 poor and remote hill and mountain districts4 of Nepal where the overall project \n5. \nwill  focus,  poverty  incidence  was  about  41%  in  2004,5 which  is  significantly  higher  than  the \nnational level of 30%. This difference is inextricably linked to the lack of accessibility for the rural \npopulation  in  the  districts.  The  more  distant  the  districts  are  from  the  center,  and  the  more \nmountainous,  the  less  access  people  have  to  social  services,  markets,  and  ultimately \nopportunities  to  enhance  their  economic  activities  and  livelihoods.  The  scope  for  developing \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2004.

Kathmandu. \n\n\f2 \n\nrural transport infrastructure such as roads, tracks, trail bridges, and ropeways is immense, and \nit requires a major investment in the medium to longer term. Non-transport constraints are also \npart  of  the  broad  accessibility\u2013poverty  nexus.  These  include  (i)  the  lack  of  social  and  market \nfacilities,  (ii)  the  lack  of  integrated  accessibility  planning,  and  (iii)  low  income  and  cash \navailability. The situation is aggravated by the persistence of strong inequalities between castes \nand ethnic groups. \n \n6. \nIn  Nepal,  the  road  maintenance  program\u2014including  planning  and  implementation\u2014is \ndecentralized  at  the  district  level,  with  the  involvement  of  the  road  users.  However,  there  are \nmany weaknesses in the approach to rural road maintenance: (i) periodic maintenance is given \npreference  over  routine  maintenance,  (ii)  over  50%  of  the  rural  roads  network  is  in  an \nunmaintainable condition, (iii) maintenance supervision is inadequate, (iv) maintenance budgets \n(covering  only  30%  of  needs)  are  inadequate,  and  (v)  maintenance  skills  and  material \nspecifications are poor. \n \nPast  and  ongoing  experiences  in  the  rural  roads  sector  in  Nepal6 provide  key  lessons \n7. \nlearned that need to be addressed. These include the following: (i) district administrations lack a \nmaintenance  culture  and  have \nroad  maintenance; \n(ii) supplementary  infrastructure  is  not  aligned  and  well  focused  with  the  project  accessibility \ncore  objective;  (iii)  skills  training  are  not  always  well  focused  and market-driven;  (iv)  transport \nservices are unreliable and expensive; (v) more works tend to be allocated to contractors than \nto  communities;  (vi)  subproject  planning,  appraisal,  and  works  procurement  are  too  slow;  (vii) \ndistricts  have  weak  implementation  capacity  and  a  skills  shortage;  (viii)  attention  is  lacking \nregarding  the  needs  of  poor  and  excluded7 groups  including  women,  excluded  ethnic  groups, \nand victims of the past conflict; and (ix) access of the rural poor to microfinance is lacking. \n \n8. \nThe  project  is  included  in  the  country  partnership  strategy  for  2010\u20132012  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), which supports the country\u2019s peace and development aspirations by \npromoting broad-based and inclusive economic growth.8 The overall project will help strengthen \npeace building directly through improved access in remote districts, thereby improving access to \nhealth  and  education,  enhancing  opportunity  for  skills  and  employment  for  income,  and \nestablishing  linkages  within  remote  geographic  locations. 9 This  can  help  in  delivering  long-\nanticipated public expectations in the form of peace dividends in the post- conflict environment \nin  the  country.  The  project  is  also  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020,  which  advocates  rural \ninfrastructure development. 10 \n \n9. \nDespite  weaknesses  in  the  approach  to  the  rural  road  sector,  the  current  project, \napproved  on  24  September  2004  continues  to  show  good  performance  and  implementation \nprogress has been satisfactory (or better) in regard to achievement of outcome and outputs, and \ncompliance with covenants.

These \ncommunity infrastructures are functioning well and are likely to be sustainable because they are \ndemand-driven,  with  community  participation  in  operation  and  maintenance.  In  the  current \nproject impact zone, between 2007 and 2010, household income rose by 57% against the target \nof  25%,  while  road freight  volume  increased  by 96%  against  the  target of  100%.11 By  30  April \n2011,  381  kilometers  (km)  of  roads  were  constructed  or  rehabilitated  (70%  of  the  revised \ntarget);  trail  bridges  with  a  length  of  8,430  meters  (m)  were  completed  (against  the  7,000  m \ntarget).    The  current  project  has  already  created  more  than  5.3  million  person-days  of  jobs \n(more than 70% from poor and excluded groups). \n  \n10. \nProgress  has  been  good  in  the  implementation  of  the  gender  design  features  and \ngender action plan. Women have represented 33.17% of the membership of the Village Works \nRoad  Coordination  Committee  against  the  target  of  33%;  and  38%  of  building  groups  against \nthe  target  of  40%.  The  current  project  risks  have  been  successfully  managed  through \nawareness raising, information dissemination, social mobilization, intensive on-site supervision, \nand  capacity  building  at  central  and  local  levels.  As  of  30  June  2011,  the  current  project\u2019s \noverall physical progress was estimated by ADB\u2019s Nepal Resident Mission at  90% against the \nelapsed  loan  period  of  95%.  As  of  5  July  2011,  the  cumulative  contract  award  was  $39.44 \nmillion  and  disbursement  was  $27.51  million.  Considering  the  withdrawal  applications  in  the \nprocess  and  expenditures  already  incurred  by  districts,  the  current  project  is  expected  to \ncomplete all the remaining works by the loan closing date of 31 October 2011. \n \n11. \nThe  scaled  up  project  scope  under  additional  financing  will  address  many  lessons \nlearned from implementing past and ongoing rural roads projects, including the current project. \nThese  include  undertaking  an  innovative  road  maintenance  program,  improving  the  access  of \nthe rural  poor  to microfinance,  strongly  promoting the  use  of  building groups, restructuring the \ntargeted skills training, and sharpening the focus on national and district capacity. The current \nproject has established a satisfactory operating modality between central agencies and district \nadministrations,  as  well  as  between  different  stakeholders  at  central  and  district  levels.  The \ncurrent  project  has  prepared  and  designed  a  pipeline  of  additional  rural  road  subprojects  for \nimplementation.  The  provision  of  additional  financing  for  the  current  project  will  build  on  this \nestablished pipeline of road subprojects to move rapidly toward implementation. There are very \nclear  efficiency  gains  to  be  realized  for  scaling  up  the  current  project  by  using  additional \nfinancing, especially in terms of being able to implement the subprojects already designed and \nto  utilize  the  structures  and  staffing  developed  in  the  current  project,  at  both  the  central  and \ndistrict levels. \n \nB. \n \n12. \nThe impact of the overall project will be reduced rural poverty in 18 poor and remote hill \nand  mountain  districts.  The  overall  project  outcome  will  be  widened  access  to  social  services \nand economic opportunities. \n \nC. \n \nThe  overall  project  outcome  will  be  achieved  through  the  following  overall  project \n13. \noutputs: (i) rural livelihood improved, (ii) capacity and decentralized local governance enhanced, \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2010.

These  investments  are capped  at  $120,000,  or \n20%  of  the  cost  of  the  road  subproject,  whichever  is  lower.  Community  infrastructure12 will  be \nbased on the demand and identified priorities in the impact zones of the road subprojects. The \nbeneficiaries  of  the  community  infrastructure  are  expected  to  be  at  least  50%  women  and \nmembers of excluded groups.  \n \n15. \n The scaled up project will organize training that can contribute to a level 1 certification \nby  the  Nepal  Skills  Testing  Board;  and  will  provide  livelihood-related  skills  training  to  3,000 \nbeneficiaries from the project impact zones, of which at least 40% are women and 60% are from \npoor  and  excluded  groups.  The  social  awareness-raising  training  will  be  provided  to  9,000 \npersons, of whom 80% are women, poor, and from excluded groups. The focus of awareness-\nraising  training  will  be  on  good  nutrition,  health  and  sanitation  concerns  in  poor  rural \npopulations. In nine pilot districts, it will work with existing savings and credit groups, and assist \nbuilding  groups  willing  to  form  themselves  into  formal  savings  and  credit  cooperatives  and \nfacilitate their access to credit from existing institutional suppliers. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutput  2:  Capacity  Building  and  Decentralized  Local  Governance \nEnhanced \n\n \n16. \nThe  scaled  up  project  scope  will  improve  district  and  national  capacity  building  to \npromote improved decentralized governance. The thrust will be on establishing the capacity for \nsustainable management of rural road networks, strengthening the decentralized management \nof  rural  infrastructure,  and  raising  central  capacity  to  support  local  government  bodies.  It  will \nprovide  a  variety  of  training  to  strengthen  local  rural  road  planning,  construction,  and \nmaintenance  management  capacity;  and  sustainable  financing.  At  the  national  level,  it  will \nimprove  the  technical  and  management  capacities  of  the  Department  of  Local  Infrastructure \nDevelopment and Agricultural Roads (DOLIDAR) by providing transport, training, and resources \nto  draw  on  specialized  services  from  the  consultants  and  nongovernment  organizations. \nRegional study tours will be designed and undertaken to enhance the learning experiences. \n\nOutput 3: Rural Transport Infrastructure Extended and Maintained \n\n \n3. \n \nThe  scaled  up  project  scope  will  improve  260  km  of  rural  roads  in  the  18  districts \n17. \n(200 km new and 60 km upgrading).13 The design phase of subprojects will consider the impact \nof  climate change,  which includes  avoiding  unstable  slopes,  high-risk soil  erosion-prone  areas \nand  landslide  areas,  and  waterlogged  areas near  streams;  strictly  implementing  slope stability \nmeasures  and  robust  road  drainage  systems;  graveling  the  road  in  high-risk  areas;  and  using \nbetter maintenance approaches. Rural roads of 1,200 km will be maintained in the 18 districts \nand 6,500 m of trail bridges will be constructed. The implementation of the road subprojects will \n\n                                                \n12 Criteria  for  funding  community  infrastructure  subprojects  are  in  Appendix  3  of  the  Project  Administration  Manual \n\n(PAM) (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n13 Criteria for selecting road subprojects are in Appendix 2 of the PAM (accessible from the list of linked documents in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n \n\n\femploy  labor-based  equipment-supported  methods,  and  works  performed  by  building  groups \nwill be promoted over construction by contractors.  \n \n18. \nThe scaled up project scope  will provide direct support to road maintenance programs \nin  line  with  the  pilot  program  being  supported  by  development  partners  toward  a  sector-wide \napproach for maintenance of rural roads throughout the country. To qualify for the maintenance \ngrant,14 the districts will clearly allocate the road maintenance function to a suitable person such \nas  the  district  maintenance  officer  in  the  district  technical  office,  prepare  an  inventory  of  all \ndistrict  roads,  conduct  annual  road  condition  surveys,  and  prepare  annual  road  maintenance \nplans.  Routine  maintenance  will  be  delivered  by  the  length-persons,  creating  jobs  in  the \ndistricts. 15  A  system  of  toll  collection  will  be  piloted  in  nine  districts  to  augment  road \nmaintenance funds. \n\n \n4. \n \nTechnical  support \n\nOutput 4: Project Management Improved \n\nto  project \n\nimplementation  will  be  provided \n\n19. \nthrough  central \nimplementation  support  consultants  and  district  implementation support  consultants  in  each  of \nthe  18  project  districts.  Suitable  vehicles  will  be  provided  to  each  district  project  office  to \nimprove  implementation  performance.  A  common  financial  management  system  will  be \ndeveloped  for  the  Ministry  of  Local  Development  (MLD),  the  district  development  committees \n(DDCs), and DOLIDAR for improved reporting of the overall project financial accounts. \n \nD. \n \nThe  overall  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $134.75  million  with  additional  financing  of \n20. \n$66.45 million that includes taxes and duties of $4.56 million.

The length of the roads ranges from 7.7 km for the Bajura road to 21.8 km for \nthe  Taplejung road.  All  of  the  roads  were  assessed  to  be  appropriately  designed to  represent \nthe least-cost approach to providing improved transportation. Economic benefits were assessed \nboth  in  terms  of  consumer  surplus  through  reduced  costs  for  existing  and  incremental \ntransportation  of  people  and  goods,  and  producer  surplus  in  terms  of  reduced  costs  of \nagricultural  production  and  incremental  production.16 The  analyses  of  the  sample  subprojects \nindicated that the economic internal rate of return is 15.3% for Bajura, 22.0% for Solukhumbu, \nand 22.7% for Taplejung. The sensitivity tests and risk analysis confirm that the subprojects are \nextremely  robust.  Distribution  analyses  confirm  that  the  overall  project  will  provide  substantial \nbenefits to the poor. \n \nB. \n \nProject-specific governance risks have been analyzed by carrying out a governance risk \n25. \nassessment. A thorough assessment of the financial management and procurement capacities \nof the MLD and DOLIDAR was undertaken, and a set of realistic risk mitigation measures has \nbeen proposed and discussed with the government. Risks associated with project management, \nincluding  procurement  and  disbursement,  will  be  mitigated  by  (i)  providing consulting inputs to \nadvise  and  assist  in  the  procurement  of  goods  and  services;  (ii)  requiring  that  civil  work \ncontracts  include  a  condition  that  contractors  adhere  to  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended  to  date);  (iii)  the  PCU  periodically  inspecting  the  contractor\u2019s  fund  withdrawals  and \nsettlements; and (iv) reporting on project activities and implementation on the website to foster \ntransparency  and  timely  awarding  of  contracts.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to \nand  discussed  with  the  government  and  DOLIDAR.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM.17 \n \nC. \n \n26. \nThe  scaled  up  project  scope  will  create  an  additional  4.7  million  person-days  of  jobs, \nfrom road improvement, maintenance, and the development of community infrastructure. About \n900,000\u20131,500,000  people  (of  which  65%  are  poor)  will  directly  benefit  from  the  project.  The \npoor\u2014estimated  at  about  500,000\u20131,000,000  and  mostly  from  excluded  castes  and  ethnic \ngroups  such  as  dalits,  Janajatis,  and  indigenous  peoples\u2014will  be  targeted  for  participation  in \nbuilding  groups,  complementary  investment,  and  access  to  microfinance,  awareness  raising, \nand  capacity  building  and  focused  livelihood  enhancement  schemes.  A  Gender  Equality  and \nSocial  Inclusion  Action  Plan18 has  been  prepared  for  the  project  to  address  gender  inequality \nand  social  exclusion  issues.  The  Gender  Equality  and  Social  Inclusion  Action  Plan  contains \nspecific targets for the participation of, and ensuring project benefits reach, poor rural women, \nand excluded groups in the subproject areas. \n \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n                                                \n16 Reduced costs of agricultural inputs and increased prices of outputs arising from reduced transportation costs were \n\nomitted from the consumer surplus estimates to avoid double counting. \n\n17 PAM (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Gender Equality and Social Inclusion Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nD. \n \n 27.  Environment.  The  overall  project  is  category  B  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (2009).  The  executing  agency  and  implementing  agencies  prepared  initial \nenvironmental  examinations,  including  environmental  management  plans  (EMPs),  for  the \nsample  subprojects.  The  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  was  revised  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The framework sets out the requirements \nfor  project  screening  and  classification,  subproject  selection,  information  disclosure  to,  and \nconsultation  with,  the  affected  people,  environmental  assessment,  EMP  development  and \nimplementation, and monitoring and reporting. The initial environmental examinations found the \nplanned  subprojects  to  have  only  small  and  localized  adverse  impacts  on  the  environment, \nwhich can be managed by the mitigation measures proposed in the EMPs. \n \n28. \nResettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  overall  project  is  category  B  for \ninvoluntary  resettlement  and  category  B  for  indigenous  peoples,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement.  Most  subprojects  involve  land  acquisition  and  involuntary \nresettlement,  but  the  involuntary  resettlement  impact  is  not  considered  significant.  The \nresettlement  framework  has  been  revised  and  updated  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement.  The  resettlement  framework  includes  a  due  diligence  procedure  to  ensure \nthose donating land will not be impoverished through donation. Any donation will be confirmed \nthrough  a  written  record,  including  a  no-coercion  clause  verified  by  an  independent  external \nparty.  Land  owners  not  conforming  to  the  donation  eligibility  criteria  will  be  offered \ncompensation  at replacement  cost  and/or  assistance  so that  they  maintain  the  same or  better \nincome  and  livelihood  status.  All  subprojects  will  be  screened  early  in  the  project  cycle.  If  a \nsubproject involves any  involuntary resettlement impacts, an appropriate resettlement plan will \nbe prepared based on the detailed design, disclosed to those affected persons, and submitted \nfor  ADB  approval  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement  framework.  The  indigenous  peoples \nplanning  framework  has  also  been  revised  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement,  with  special  assistance  measures  for  indigenous  peoples  and  other  vulnerable \ngroups. Considering the nature and scale of the subprojects, any negative impact on indigenous \npeoples is expected to be limited to a few involuntary resettlements and land acquisition cases. \nIn  addition,  a  gender  equality  and  social  inclusion  plan  contains  specific  actions  favorable  to \nindigenous peoples. \n \nE. \n \n29.
