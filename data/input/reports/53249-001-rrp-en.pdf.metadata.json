The  report  also  describes  the \nproposed  administration of  a  grant to  be  provided by  the  High-Level  Technology Fund1 for the \nFirst Utility-Scale Energy Storage Project, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grant. \n \nThe proposed project aims to install the first large-scale advanced battery energy storage \n2. \nsystem (BESS) in Mongolia to (i) supply clean peaking power that is charged by renewable energy \nelectricity, which is otherwise curtailed; and (ii) provide regulation reserve to integrate additional \nrenewable energy capacity in the transmission grid. The project will lead to the decarbonization \nof the heavily coal-dependent energy system in the country. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nCoal-dependent  energy  system  and  shortage  of  electricity  supply.  Mongolia  has \n1,240  megawatts  (MW)  of  installed  capacity.  The  central  energy  system  (CES)  grid\u2014which \ncovers major load demand centers, including Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia\u2014accounted \nfor 84% of the country\u2019s electricity demand in 2018. Since the country has no access to natural \ngas resources, its energy system is the most heavily dependent on coal among the developing \nmember countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). In 2018, coal-fired combined \nheat and power (CHP) plants constituted 93% of total power generation in the CES grid. Because \nof delayed investment in new generation capacity and growing electricity demand, the capacity \nfactor of aging CHP plants during peak time in winter (September to April) exceeds 90%, and the \ngeneration capacity reserve in the CES could be depleted as early as 2020.2 Based on updated \nelectricity load demand projections to 2030, generation capacity additions of 230 MW by 2023 \nand 891 MW by 2030 are essential to meet growing demand in the CES. \n \n4. \nDecarbonizing the energy sector. The energy sector is Mongolia\u2019s largest contributor to \ngreenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions,  accounting  for  about  two-thirds  of  the  country\u2019s  GHG \nemissions.  According  to  Mongolia\u2019s  nationally  determined  contributions,  GHG  emissions  will \nincrease to 51.5 million tons of carbon dioxide (mtCO2) by 2030 in the business-as-usual scenario, \nwith energy\u2019s share of total emissions increasing to 81.5%.3 The country targets reducing GHG \nemissions  by  7.3  mtCO2  by  2030  through  emission  reductions  from  power  generation \n(4.9 mtCO2), industry (0.7 mtCO2), and transportation (1.7 mtCO2). \n \n5. \nRenewable  energy  potential.  Mongolia  has  very  large  renewable  energy  resources, \nespecially for wind and solar energy. Renewable energy potential is estimated to be equivalent to \n2,600 gigawatts of installed capacity, which could fully meet future power demand in the country. \n\n \n\n1  Financing partner: the Government of Japan. \n2  Imported  electricity  from  the Russian  Federation  grew  from  176  gigawatt-hours  in  2015  to  304  gigawatt-hours  in \n2018.  The  loading  rate  of  the  220-kilovolt  transmission  line  (double  circuit)  for  electricity  imports  from  the \nRussian Federation also reached 60% in 2018, failing to meet the N-1 reliability standard. A transmission system \nwhich is designed to meet N-1 reliability standard can maintain its power supply without damage in case of any one \ncontingency event, e.g. the failure of one transmission circuit. \n\n3   United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change.  2016.  Intended  Nationally  Determined  Contribution \n(INDC) Submission by Mongolia to the Ad-Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (ADP). \nBonn. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nHowever, this rich renewable energy resource has been marginally utilized.4 The Government of \nMongolia aims to increase the share of renewable energy in total installed capacity from about \n12% in 2018 to 20% by 2023 and 30% by 2030, in line with the State Policy on Energy, 2015\u2013\n2030.5 Renewable energy capacity in the CES must grow to 274.2 MW by 2023 and 595.3 MW \nby 2030 to meet these medium- and long-term renewable energy targets. \n \n6. \nEnergy sector reform and evolving policies for renewable energy investment. The \ngovernment has initiated a series of energy sector reforms for sustainable sector development. \nIn 2001, the CES was unbundled into generation, transmission, and distribution companies; and \nthe  government  introduced  a  single-buyer  model  for  market-oriented  sector  operations.  The \ngovernment has designated the National Power Transmission Grid (NPTG) as a single national \ntransmission  company  to  secure third-party  access  to the  transmission  grid.  To  attract  private \nsector  investment,  the  Law  on  Investment  was  amended  in  2015  to  support  private  sector \ninvestment in energy infrastructure. The State Policy on Energy, 2015\u20132030 (para. 5) set financial \nsoundness  targets  for  all  state-owned  energy  utilities,  including  NPTG,  to  achieve  zero  profit \nmargin by 2023 and 5% by 2030 for financially sustainable energy operations.6 Enacted in 2007, \nthe Law on Renewable Energy aimed to increase the use of renewable energy in Mongolia and \nregulate its generation and supply, and has since enabled the generation of sizable private sector \ninvestment in renewable energy. It also set a United States dollar-denominated feed-in tariff to \nattract  foreign  investors.  An  amendment  to  the  Law  on  Renewable  Energy,  approved  by \nParliament  in  June  2015,  introduced  a  renewable  energy  surcharge  on  end-user  tariffs  and \nestablished a payment fund for renewable energy generators. The  Law on Renewable Energy \nwas further  amended in 2019  to introduce  a capacity  auction scheme  that  aims to establish  a \ntransparent  tariff-setting  mechanism  for  renewable  energy  power  plants  through  a  competitive \nbidding process in which the government designates the plant site location with a full guarantee \nfor grid connection. This amendment is expected to stimulate competition among private investors \nfor optimal energy pricing and reduce  the cost burden on end-users for sustainable renewable \nenergy deployment.7   \n \n7. \nGrid absorption limit to evacuate renewable energy. Private sector renewable energy \nprojects with installed capacity of about 400 MW have been licensed in the CES, of which 260 MW \nhave been commissioned.8 The growing number of grid-connected wind and solar photovoltaic \npower plants and a grid system dominated by coal-fired CHP plants, which have limited flexibility \nto support fluctuating renewable energy power output, have curtailed the generation of renewable \nenergy.  Mongolia\u2019s  renewable  energy  investment  plan  in  2015  estimated  the  maximum  grid \nabsorption capacity to be 50 MW in wind power and 125 MW in solar photovoltaic power without \ncurtailment.9 Since 2015, the government has been seeking the development of the 315 MW Egiin \nhydropower plant in the Selenge river basin upstream of Baikal lake in Siberia to fully evacuate \nrenewable energy into the grid and meet peak power demand. The project has not moved forward, \n\n \n\n4  The total renewable energy capacity was 145 MW in 2018 and 260 MW in 2019. \n5  Government of Mongolia. 2015. State Policy on Energy, 2015\u20132030. Ulaanbaatar. \n6  Since 2016, no state-owned utility in the CES has received a state subsidy to cover operation deficit. NPTG achieved \n\nzero net profit margin target in 2018. \n\n7  The 2015 law set the feed-in tariff at $0.08\u2013$0.10 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for wind power and $0.13\u2013$0.15 per kWh \nfor solar power. The 2019 amendment introduced the capacity auction scheme with a ceiling tariff of $0.08 per kWh \nfor wind power and $0.12 per kWh for solar photovoltaic power. The tariff for renewable energy projects with power \npurchase agreements signed before the 2019 amendment is grandfathered. The European Bank for Reconstruction \nand  Development  supports  the  Ministry  of  Energy in  preparing  regulations  for  implementing  the capacity  auction \nscheme. \n\n8  This comprises 155 MW of wind power and 105 MW of solar photovoltaic power. \n9  By 2018, the total installed capacity of wind power was 155 MW, exceeding the technical grid absorption limit of \n50 MW without curtailment. At 105 MW, the total installed capacity of solar photovoltaic power is below the 125 MW \ngrid absorption limit without curtailment. \n\n\fhowever, owing to the Russian Federation\u2019s concerns over environmental impacts and the water \nlevel  in Baikal  lake.10 With  stalled  hydropower  investment  and  lack  of  access to  natural  gas to \ndevelop  fast-responding  power  plants,  battery  storage  is  the  best  available  option  to  swiftly \nsupport  renewable  energy  evacuation  into  the  country\u2019s  less  flexible,  coal-dominated  energy \nsystem. \n \n8. \nThe project aims to expand the system\u2019s capacity to fully absorb renewable energy, which \nis otherwise curtailed to supply clean peaking power, and to integrate additional renewable energy \ncapacity into the CES grid. This would reduce GHG emissions from the highly carbon-intensive \nimported electricity from Siberia and provide room to connect an additional 350 MW of renewable \nenergy capacity to the CES without curtailment. This will help in fully meeting the government\u2019s \nrenewable energy target by 2030 (para. 5). The project will also indirectly support the promotion \nof  electric  heating  in  ger  (traditional  tent)  districts  in  Ulaanbaatar  through  the  supply  of  clean \nelectricity during winter peak demand time, which is one of the major policy actions in the National \nProgram for Reducing Air and Environment Pollution, 2017\u20132025.11 \n \nThe project directly contributes to broadening the climate change response in support of \n9. \nthe government\u2019s compliance with the targets indicated during the 21st Conference of the Parties \nto the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, as discussed in ADB\u2019s country \npartnership  strategy,  2017\u20132020  for  Mongolia.12 It  will  support  a  key  strategic  pillar  of  ADB\u2019s \nstrategy 2030\u2014tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing \nenvironmental sustainability\u2014by accelerating low GHG emission development. The project will \ncontribute to Sustainable Development Goal 13 on taking urgent action to combat climate change \nand its impact; and Sustainable Development Goal 7 on ensuring access to affordable, reliable, \nsustainable and modern energy for all. \n \nB. \n \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: renewable energy capacity increased to \n10. \n20% of total generation capacity by 2023 and 30% by 2030.13 The project will have the following \noutcome: renewable electricity penetration increased.14 On successful completion, the project will \nsupply  44  gigawatt-hours  of  clean  peaking  power  annually,  and  support  the  integration  of  an \nadditional 859 gigawatt-hours of renewable electricity into the CES grid annually, thereby avoiding \n842,039 tons of carbon dioxide emissions yearly by 2025.  \n \n11. \nOutput 1: Large-scale advanced battery energy storage system installed. By 2022, \n125  MW/160  megawatt-hours  of  advanced  BESS  is  installed.  The  BESS  will  be  resilient  to \nextremely cold climate and will be equipped with a battery energy management system to be fully \ncharged by renewable electricity, which is otherwise curtailed, and to discharge clean electricity \nto supply peaking power in the CES. The BESS will also provide the regulation reserve in the \n\nProject Description  \n\n \n\n10 ADB  supported  detailed  engineering  design  for  Egiin  hydropower  development  in  1992.  After  several  design \nchanges, initial site development work was initiated in 2015 with concessional finance from the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina. The Russian Federation objected to the project because of potential environmental impacts on Baikal lake. \nConcessional finance from the People\u2019s Republic of China was canceled in 2017. \n\n11 Government  of  Mongolia.  2017.

The  project  will  help \nstrengthen the capacity of the National Dispatching Center (NDC) to handle power dispatch and \ngrid operations and of the NPTG to operate and maintain the BESS sustainably.15 It will include \n(i) developing BESS operation and maintenance (O&M) regulations to avoid reducing battery life \nthrough overcharging and discharging, which is a major cause of fire, and to secure the necessary \nfunds for a major overhaul to replace the battery pack after 13 years of operation; (ii) developing \nan ancillary service pricing policy and guidelines to create room for private sector investment in \nBESS for future capacity addition; (iii) providing training for NDC and NPTG staff, with particular \nattention  on  female  staff,  and  developing  a  gender  policy  in  the  energy  sector;  and \n(iv) disseminating  project  knowledge  and  lessons  to  other  DMCs  facing  similar  challenges  in \nscaling up renewable energy. \n \nC. \n \n13. \nUpstream  involvement  of  ADB  and  knowledge  sharing.  ADB  identified  the  project \nthrough  policy  dialogue  with  the  government  during  the  country  programming  mission  in \nMarch 2018.  Based  on  these  discussions,  ADB  approved  knowledge  and  support  technical \nassistance  in  August  2018  to  assess  the  feasibility  of  the  BESS  investment  option  and \nconceptualize the project.16 In April 2019, the government requested $100 million loan financing \nfrom ADB for the project to be developed in 2020. ADB\u2019s loan financing, with grant support from \nthe  High-Level  Technology  Fund  (HLT  Fund)  will  demonstrate  the  feasibility  and  reliability  of \ncutting-edge large-scale BESS in extreme cold climate conditions.17 Since the project will be the \nworld\u2019s  largest  BESS  in  operation,  it  will  also  generate  knowledge  on  the  development  and \noperation  of  at-scale  BESS  to  decarbonize  power  systems  in  other  DMCs,  which  can  be \ndisseminated by ADB.18 \n \n14. \nSupport for private sector investment in renewable energy. The project will remove \nbarriers  to  private  sector  investment  in  renewable  energy  by  eliminating  possible  curtailment. \nFurther to the successful financial closure in March 2019 of the country\u2019s first nonsovereign solar \npower  project,  ADB\u2019s  East  Asia  Department  and  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  will \ncontinue to jointly support renewable energy transactions in the CES to decarbonize the country\u2019s \nenergy sector.19 The project will also develop an ancillary service pricing policy and guidelines to \nattract private sector investment in scaling up BESS capacity (para. 12). \n \n\n \n\n15 The NDC, a state-owned transmission power system operator, will send dispatch commands to the project BESS \nplant after commissioning. The NPTG, a state-owned transmission company, will be the owner of the project BESS \nplant and will be responsible for daily O&M. \n\n16 ADB.  2018.

The government will finance taxes and duties other than \nincome tax and social insurance fees for consultants and PMU staff. \n \n19. \nClimate mitigation is estimated to cost $102.9 million and climate adaptation is estimated \nto cost $0.1 million. ADB and the HLT Fund will finance 100% of mitigation and adaptation costs. \nDetails  are  in  the  project  administration  manual.  While  the  project\u2019s  major  contribution  to  the \nclimate change agenda is to mitigate the climate change impact by promoting renewable energy, \nthe project\u2019s design partly considers climate change adaptation (para. 22). \n \nE. \n \n20. \nThe Ministry of Energy (MOE) will be the executing agency for the project and the NPTG \nwill be the implementing agency. A project steering committee\u2014comprising the MOE, the Ministry \nof  Finance,  the  Energy  Regulatory  Commission  (ERC), 21 the  NDC,  and  the  NPTG\u2014will  be \nestablished to provide overall guidance in project management and implementation. The PMU, to \nbe established under the MOE, will manage, coordinate, and supervise project implementation. \nNPTG and NDC staff will be involved in the PMU for close coordination and smooth handover of \nthe project facility after its commission. The borrower and grant recipient is the Government of \nMongolia, which will onlend the loan and grant proceeds to the NPTG on the same terms and \nconditions  as  those  of  the  ADB  loan  and  the  HLT  Fund  grant.

The  power  system  analysis  confirmed  that  connecting  the  project  BESS  at  the \nSongino substation would not require additional construction in the power grid. The BESS will be \ndesigned to function under the country\u2019s severe climate conditions.23 To minimize the fire incident \nrisk, a buffer zone will be secured around the BESS plant. As there is no relevant international \nstandard, the  project  will  adopt the  common  practice of  having  a  20-meter-wide  fire-protection \nbuffer  zone.  The  country\u2019s  lack  of  experience  and  knowledge  of  utility-scale  BESS  will  be \naddressed by the project\u2019s capacity building component, including start-up operation services to \nbe  provided  by  the  contractor  during  the  initial  2-year  operation  after  project  commissioning. \nClimate  change  risks  relevant  to  the  BESS  plant  include  the  risk  of  flooding  from  increased \nprecipitation and the risk of an unstable foundation from possible melting permafrost. To adapt to \nthese climate change risks, the project is designed to bring its foundation to the same level as \nthat of the Songino substation. \n \nB. \n  \n23. \nThe financial analysis included an evaluation to determine financial viability of the project; \nand analysis of the financial statements of the NPTG, the owner of the project, to determine the \nfinancial sustainability of the project. The financial internal rate of return of the project is 3.65% \nwhich is higher than the weighted cost of capital of 2.12%, indicating that the project is financially \nviable.  Sensitivity  analysis  indicated  that  the  project  remains  financially  viable  even  when \ninfluenced by adverse changes in capital cost, O&M cost, transmission volume, and tariff. Given \nthat the NPTG will own, operate, and maintain the project asset and will repay the ADB loan, the \ngovernment  will  follow  the  established  regulation  and  pricing  mechanism  to  increase  the \ntransmission tariff, which is covenanted in the legal document, enabling the NPTG to generate \nsufficient cash flows to meet the project\u2019s O&M costs including battery pack replacement cost and \nrepay  the  ADB  loan.  With  the  envisaged  tariff  increase,  the  financial  statement  analysis \ndemonstrates  that  the  NPTG  will  have  adequate  financial  capacity  to  cover  the  project\u2019s \nincremental recurrent O&M costs and meet debt service requirements. The project is considered \nfinancially sustainable.24 \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\n \n23 The temperature in Ulaanbaatar ranges from about \u201330\u00b0C to +25\u00b0C. \n24 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nGovernance \n\nSustainability \n\n \n24. \nEconomic analysis of the project indicated an economic internal rate of return of 17.16% \nwith  environmental  benefits,  which  is  higher  than  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of \n9.00%.  Sensitivity  analysis  showed  that  economic  internal  rates  of  return  with  environmental \nbenefit would be (i) 15.19% if there is a 10% decline in economic benefits, (ii) 15.69% if there is \na 10% capital cost overrun, (iii) 16.82% if Operational expenses increase by 10%, (iv) 16.30% if \nthe economic cost of coal declines by 10%, (v) 16.09% if additional renewable energy capacity is \nreduced by 10%, and (vi) 17.07% if the project completion  is delayed by 1 year. The project\u2019s \neconomic viability is robust under all adverse scenarios.25 \n \nC. \n \nThe  project  design  has  incorporated  the  necessary  measures  for  sustainable  project \n25. \noperation. The project involves start-up operation services to be provided by the contractor during \nthe  initial  2-year  operation  to  ensure  knowledge  transfer  and  adequate training  for  sustainable \nO&M  (para.  22).  To  support  necessary  O&M  funding  including  battery  pack  replacement  cost, \nADB and the ERC agreed to the transmission tariff adjustment mechanism that is also covenanted \nin the legal document (para. 23). Institutional and organizational capacity development support \nunder output 2 of the project will also help (i) strengthen O&M capacity in the NDC and NPTG, \nand (ii) develop an ancillary services policy to support private sector investment in future BESS \ncapacity additions (para. 12). \n \nD. \n \nFinancial  management.  The  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  in \n26. \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  technical  guidance  note  for  financial  management  assessment.26 The \nfinancial management assessment evaluated the financial management capacities of the MOE \nand  NPTG.  The  assessment  confirmed  that  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  have \nadequate financial management systems and procedures in place to implement the project. The \nassessed  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  is  moderate.  The  key  weakness  in  project \nfinancial management is the implementing agency\u2019s lack of experience in executing ADB-financed \nprojects. This risk will be mitigated through the financial management action plan described in the \nproject administration manual. The executing and implementing agencies will implement the time-\nbound financial management action plan during the project to mitigate the risks. \n \n27. \nProcurement. The project procurement risk assessment followed ADB\u2019s guidance note \non  strategic  procurement  planning.27 It  found  the  project  procurement  risk  to  be  high  mainly \nbecause of the executing agency\u2019s lack of experience in procuring utility-scale BESS or similar \nsystems and in handling large-value contracts. To mitigate this risk, it is proposed to recruit two \ninternational individual consultants (a BESS specialist and a procurement specialist) to support \nthe  executing  agency  and  the  PMU  during  the  bidding  process  of  the  main  procurement \npackages. The project will be procuring the first large-scale BESS in Mongolia, and the supply \nmarket is currently dominated by several potential bidders. To minimize the risk of bidding failure, \nmarket  assessments  have been  conducted to  set  appropriate  qualifications,  and  technical  and \nbid evaluation criteria. To achieve value for money, ADB\u2019s Standard Bidding Document for the \nProcurement of Plant\u2014Design, Supply, Installation will be used and evaluation criteria will take \nlife-cycle costs and relevant sustainability and environment factors into account.28 \n\n \n\n25 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 ADB. 2015.

Manila \n\n\fPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nIntegrity  due  diligence  of  the  implementing  agency,  NPTG,  was  conducted. 29  No \n\n \n28. \nsignificant integrity risks were identified. \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n29. \nwith  the  government  and  the  MOE.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 21). \n \nE. \n \n30. \nPoverty  and  social  analysis.  People  in  the  CES  area,  including  the  capital  city  of \nUlaanbaatar, will benefit directly from the project through reduced power outages and improved \nair  quality.  A  social  survey  analysis  found  that  about  20%  of  the  population  in  the  CES  is \ncategorized poor or extreme poor and is more vulnerable to power outages than other segments \nof the population. The project\u2019s impact on energy prices is negligible. The project will indirectly \ncontribute  to  improved  air  quality  through  the  deployment  of  electric  heaters  in  ger  districts  in \nUlaanbaatar, which is one of the major policy actions in the National Program for Reducing Air \nand  Environment  Pollution,  2017\u20132025.30 The  project  will  create  jobs  during  construction  and \noperation.  The  contractors  will  be  required  to  adhere  to  national  labor  standards,  safety \nregulations, and equal pay for equal work. \n \n31. \nGender.  The  project  is  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  Gender  analysis \nindicates  that  the  project  will  benefit  the  population  of  Ulaanbaatar  as  a  whole.  Women  are \nexpected to benefit from reduced power outages resulting from the project. During power outages, \nwomen tend to play primary coping roles, such as reverting to traditional coal stoves for cooking, \nboiling  water,  and  heating,  most  of  which  are  time-  and  labor-intensive.  The  analysis  on  the \ngender mainstreaming status in the energy sector found that the country\u2019s energy sector is among \nthe few sectors lacking a gender strategy and that the NPTG and NDC have fewer female power \nengineers than male counterparts, particularly at senior levels. \n \n32. \nTo  assess  end-user  project  benefits,  the  project  will  conduct  end-user  surveys  on  the \ncommissioning of the BESS plant, with specific focus on the benefit for female end-users. At the \npolicy level, the project will develop the first gender policy for the energy sector together with the \nMOE. The project will support a tailored professional training program for female engineers at the \nNPTG  and  NDC  to  increase  the  pool  of  highly  qualified  female  engineers  eligible  for  senior \npositions. The training\u2019s counterpart will be the Mongolian University of Science and Technology. \nThe project sets targets for the participation of female engineers in BESS-specific training under \nthe turnkey contract. \n \nF. \n \n33. \ncategories are as follows.31 \n \nEnvironment (category B).

Sensitive ecosystems will not be affected. Potential adverse environmental impacts \nduring  construction\u2014including  soil  erosion,  noise,  dust  emissions,  construction  waste  and \nwastewater,  and  occupational  and  community  health  and  safety  risks\u2014are  mostly  temporary, \npredictable, and reversible; and can be mitigated through adherence to national regulations and \nEMP implementation. Potential impacts during operation include solid and hazardous waste (e.g., \nspent  battery  cells),  wastewater,  explosion  and fire hazards,  and occupational  and community \nhealth  and  safety  risks.  As  there  are  no  hazardous  waste  treatment  facilities  in  Mongolia,  the \nsupplier will be responsible for the final disposal of the spent battery cells. An occupational health \nand  safety  plan  and  an  emergency  response  plan  will  be  prepared,  and  meaningful  public \nconsultations have been conducted. The implementing agency will establish grievance redress \nmechanisms. The EMP has allocated sufficient budget to ensure proper implementation of the \nmitigation  and  monitoring  measures,  and  an  environmental  consultant  will  be  engaged  during \nproject implementation. Environmental monitoring reports will be submitted to ADB semiannually \nduring  construction  and  annually  during  operation.  During  preconstruction  and  construction, \ncontractors  will  be  required  to  comply  with  the  EMP,  which  will  be  updated  as  necessary  if \nunanticipated  impacts  are  identified  during  implementation.  Based  on  climate  risk  screening, \npotential climate risks to the project are medium. A climate risk assessment has been conducted. \nTo adapt to climate change risks, such as possible melting permafrost and flooding, the project is \ndesigned to bring the foundation of the BESS plant level with that of the Songino substation. \n \n35. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  C).  The  project  is  category  C  for  involuntary \nresettlement.    The  battery  field,  control  building,  high-voltage  and  medium-voltage  outdoor \nequipment,  and  one  of  three  transmission  towers  will  be  located  within  the  2 hectares  of  land \nallocated for the project, which are part of the 16 hectares of government land allocated to the \nMOE on 17 September 2019. The NPTG owns a storage building within the land allocated for the \nproject, but it is no longer being used. The remaining two towers will be located in the 25-meter \nelectrical-safety buffer zone of the Songino substation (existing facility). The NPTG is the operator \nfor both the proposed project and the Songino substation. Due diligence confirmed no outstanding \nor legacy issue on the land allocated for the project or the Songino substation. \n \n36. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).  The  project  is  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples \nsafeguards. The location of the battery storage facility and substation is about 5 kilometers from \nresidential communities. The project will benefit the residents, and it does not have differential \nimpacts on any specific ethnic minority communities that would trigger ADB\u2019s indigenous peoples \npolicy requirements. \n \nG. \n \n37. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.32 \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nProject implementation could be \ndelayed because of delays in \nprocurement and consultant \nrecruitment. \n\nMitigation Measures \nDraft bidding document has been prepared.
