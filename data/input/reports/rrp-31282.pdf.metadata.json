The  Project  is  the  first  major  attempt  in  this\ndirection, and is designed to stimulate economic growth in\nSouthern  Province \nsector\ninvestments \nenterprises.\nSimultaneously,  the  Project  aims  to  assist  in  establishing\nan  enabling  physical  and  institutional  environment  to\npromote  and  sustain  this  process.  Entrepreneurs  wanting\nto invest in the region will be assisted by contracted private\nsector  agencies \nidentify  economic  opportunities;\ntechnology,\nformulate  suitable  projects;  and  access \nmarkets,  and  financing.  A  credit  line  will  be  provided  to\nmeet the medium- and long-term financing requirements of\npotential entrepreneurs. In addition, the Project will provide\nmuch-needed,  capacity-building  support  to  the  public\nsector,  and  in  particular,  assist  local  governments  to\nupgrade and maintain key rural infrastructure.\n\nto \n\ninvestments \n\nDespite economic growth of 5.4 percent during 1990-1999,\ndevelopment  and  income  distribution  in  Sri  Lanka  remain\nuneven.  Rural  areas  of  Southern  Province  continue  to\nsuffer  from  high  levels  of  poverty  and  unemployment  due\nto  the  predominance  of  low-value  agriculture  and  limited\ndevelopment of value-added enterprises in the region. The\nGovernment  has  in  recent  years  placed  high  priority  on\nto\ndevelopment \nstimulate  its  rural  economy  and  achieve  more  balanced\nregional  development.  However,  in  promoting  investment,\nthe  Government  recognizes  the  importance  of  a  holistic\ndevelopment  approach  that  promotes  linkages  between\nagriculture  and \nissues  of\nbackward and forward linkages to provide opportunities for\nfarm  households \ntheir  subsistence\nincome  levels  to  micro  and  small  enterprises.  It  is  also\ncognizant  of \ninfrastructure  and  policy\ndevelopments that have occurred in the last few years.\n\nindustry,  and  addresses \n\nin  Southern  Province \n\nto  graduate \n\nthe  many \n\nfrom \n\nFirst, the Government intends to operationalize a shift in its\npolicy \nrural\ndevelopment  activities  to  the  promotion  of  commercially\n\nbroad-based \n\nintegrated \n\naway \n\nfrom \n\n\fObjectives and Scope\n\niii\n\noriented economic activities in rural areas through linkages\nwith the private sector. Second, political will is growing and\nGovernment  intends  to  implement  the  current  policy  of\ndevolution  of  power  and  development  responsibility  to\nprovincial  and  local  governments.  Third,  the  Government\nrecognizes  that  for  economic  growth  to  continue,  assets\nconstructed under different projects must be protected and\nkept  from  deteriorating  through  a  sound  and  sustainably\nfinanced operation and maintenance program. In addition,\nconsiderable  infrastructure  investments  are  under  way  in\nthe  Province.  Prominent  among  them  are  the  proposed\nhighway  from  Colombo  to  Matara,  in  the  center  of  the\nProvince,  and  the  550  kms  of  provincial  roads  which  are\nbeing  upgraded.  When  completed, \nroad\nprojects, supported by the ADB, will considerably enhance\nthe  transportation  network  in  the  region  and  provide  a\nboost to economic activities.\n\nthese \n\ntwo \n\nIn  response  to  these  factors,  the  Project  is  designed  to\nfocus on stimulating private sector-led economic growth in\nthe  rural  areas  of  Southern  Province,  while  at  the  same\ntime  develop  the  physical  and  institutional  environment  to\nsustain the process.\n\nto  be  accomplished  by \n\nThe  Project's  objective  is  to  support  the  Government\u2019s\nefforts  to  accelerate  economic  growth  and  create  income\nand  employment  opportunities  in  Southern  Province.  This\nis \nincreasing  private  sector\nparticipation and supporting the devolution of responsibility\nfor planning and implementation to the provincial and local\ngovernments. The Project will focus on (i) establishing and\nexpanding micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises in\nthe  region;  (ii)  providing  and  maintaining  key  economic\ninfrastructure; and (iii) enhancing public and private sector\ncapacities to facilitate, support, and sustain the process of\neconomic growth.\n\nThe  Project  comprises  two  interrelated  parts  that  will  be\nimplemented simultaneously. Part I is intended to stimulate\neconomic  activity  in  the  region  and  includes  support  to  (i)\nenterprise  development  services,  and  (ii)  a  credit  line  for\nfinancing  term  loans.  Part  II  is  intended  to  build  an\nenabling  environment  for  economic  growth  and  includes\nsupport  for  (i)  providing  rural  infrastructure,  particularly\naccess roads and markets; (ii) enhancing the technical and\nfinancial  capacity  in  local  governments  to  maintain  rural\ninfrastructure;  (iii)  providing  skills  and  capacities  at  the\nprovincial and Ministry of Plan Implementation (MPI) levels\nrural\nto \ndevelopment; and (iv) providing project administration and\nmanagement.\n\nsector  participation \n\nfacilitate  private \n\nin \n\n\fCost Estimates\n\nFinancing  Plan\n\nLoan Amount and Terms \n\niv\n\nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $42.7  million\nequivalent,  comprising  $13.2  million  in  foreign  exchange\nand $29.5 million equivalent in local currency costs.\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nPercent\n\n          ($ million)\n\nSource\n\nADB\nOPEC\nGovernment\nPFIs\nBeneficiaries\n\n11.2\n  2.0\n  0.0\n  0.0\n  0.0\n\n 13.8\n   3.0\n   6.7\n   2.0\n   4.0\n\n   25.0\n     5.0\n     6.7\n     2.0\n     4.0\n\n     58\n     12\n     16\n       5\n       9\n\n           Total\n\n   13.2\n\n 29.5\n\n   42.7\n\n   100\n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, OPEC Fund = Organization of\nPetroleum  Exporting  Countries  Fund \nInternational\nDevelopment, PFI = participating financial institution\n\nfor \n\nAn  ADB  loan  equivalent  in  various  currencies  of  Special\nDrawing Rights 19,384,000 ($25 million) will finance $11.2\nmillion  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $13.8  million\nequivalent of the local currency cost.

Long-term  benefits  will  flow  to  new\nand  potential  entrepreneurs  through  the  availability  of\ncompetent  sources  of  technical,  managerial,  and  financial\nadvice, and also financing agencies that have the capacity\nto  process  and  supervise  term  loans.  A  large  segment  of\nthe  rural  population  will  receive  both  short-  and  long-term\neconomic  benefits  from  improved  rural  access  roads  and\nmarkets,  not  just  through  project-based  support  for  their\nupgrading,  but  benefits  that  will  accrue  from  enhanced\n\n\fvi\n\ntechnical  and  financial  competence  in  local  bodies  to\noperate  them  over  the  longer  run.  Long-term  benefits  will\nalso accrue from improved capabilities in SPC and MPI to\nwork  with  the  private  sector,  manage  economic  growth\nprojects, and incorporate new responsibilities implicit in the\nongoing  process  of  decentralization.  Finally,  the  private\nsector support agencies and nongovernment organizations\nwill  benefit  from  enhanced  capacity,  expanded  business\nopportunities,  and  greater  acceptance  as  partners  of  the\npublic sector.\n\n\fv\ni\ni\n\f     I.\n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\n1.\nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  Report  and  Recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed\nloan to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Southern Province Rural Economic\nAdvancement  Project,  and  (ii)  the  proposed  administration  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank\n(ADB)  of  a  loan  for  the  Project  to  be  provided  by  the  Organization  of  Petroleum  Exporting\nCountries (OPEC) Fund for International Development.\n\nII.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2.\nIn 1997 the Government of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka asked ADB for\ntechnical assistance (TA) to prepare a rural economic advancement project in Southern Province\nfor possible ADB financing. In line with this request, the TA was approved in 1999 and consulting\nservices  were  awarded  in  May  2000.1  The  TA  was  divided  into  two  phases:  (i)  to  help  the\nGovernment  develop  the  Strategic  Framework  and  Operation  Plan  for  rural  economic\nadvancement  projects  (REAPs),  and  (ii)  to  design  the  REAP  for  Southern  Province.  The  first\nphase report was presented and discussed with the Government and ADB in July 2000. The draft\nfinal  report  for  the  second  phase  was  presented  in  March  2001.The  project  scope,  cost,  and\nfinancing  and  implementation  arrangements  were  further  investigated  and  firmed  up  during  the\nFact-Finding and Appraisal missions in May and July 2001.The Project is designed to capitalize\nthrough\non \nconsultations  with  potential  beneficiaries, \nlocal  government\nrepresentatives. A socioeconomic analysis and an impact survey were undertaken and a series of\nworkshops  convened  to  discuss  the  design,  scope,  and  implementation  arrangements  with\nthe  private  sector,  and\ngovernment \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).  The  project  design  represents  the  views  of  a  wide\nspectrum of stakeholders in the country. The project framework is in Appendix 1.\n\nrepresentatives,  external  development  agencies, \n\nthe  region\u2019s  resource  endowments  and \n\nto  address  context-specific  needs \n\nthe  private  sector,  and \n\nA.  \n\nThe Rural Sector\n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nSri Lanka has traditionally been a rural country with a society based on village life and an\n3.\neconomy based on agriculture. This has changed somewhat over the last two decades with the\ncontribution  of  agriculture  to  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  declining  from  30.3  percent  in\n1978  to  19.7  percent  in  2000,  and  the  contribution  of  the  service  sector  increasing  from  44.4\npercent  to  54.6  percent  during  the  same  period.2  These  figures  indicate  an  increasing  trend\ntoward  urbanization.  However,  almost  all  urbanization  has  tended  to  concentrate  in  Western\nProvince  and,  more  specifically,  in  and  around  greater  Colombo.    Most  other  areas  have\ncontinued  to  be  very  much  rural  oriented  with  economic  activity  predominantly  focused  on\nagriculture,  livestock,  fisheries,  and  forestry.  Statistics  also  show  that  the  level  of  poverty  by\nprovince is proportionate to the rural share of its population. Thus, in Western Province where 50\npercent of the population is rural, the poverty level is 23 percent, whereas in Southern Province,\n80 percent of the population is rural and the poverty level is about 40 percent.3 This link of rural\nareas  to  poverty  is  a  direct  result  of  the  inefficient  and  unproductive  nature  of  much  of  the\nagriculture  sector  upon  which  the  rural  areas  and  rural  populations  are  dependent.  Agricultural\ngrowth has remained low for many reasons, including uneconomic landholding size; restrictions\n\n                  \n\n1 \n\nTA 3385-SRI:  Southern Province Rural Economic Advancement Project, for $800,000, approved on 29 December\n1999 (Financed by Japan Special Fund).\n\n2  Central Bank of Sri Lanka. 2001. Annual Report 2000. Colombo.\n3 \n\nThe incidence of poverty is measured by the higher poverty line, which is set at SLRs950 per person per month.\n\n\f2\n\non land use; low level of technology; poor linkage to markets; and most importantly, limited value\naddition in the sector due to inadequate development of processing and agrobased industries. As\na  result,  while  the  economy  has  grown  overall  at  a  respectable  rate  of  5.4  percent  per  annum\nbetween 1990 and 1999 and 6 percent in 2000, growth in the agriculture sector has remained at a\nmodest  2.3  percent.  Thus,  the  positive  economic  growth  that  characterized  the  country  as  a\nwhole over the past two decades has bypassed a large proportion of the population living in rural\nareas.\n\n4.\nThe  Government  is  employing  several  strategies  to  remedy  this  situation,  including  (i)\npromoting growth in the nonrural sectors to find alternative means of economic production for a\nsection  of  the  rural  population;  (ii)  improving  the  efficiency  of  the  agriculture  sector  by\nencouraging  a  switch  to  higher-value  crops  and  improvements  in  the  transport  and  marketing\ninfrastructure serving rural areas; (iii) promoting rural enterprises, especially those that relate to\nprocessing  and  marketing  of  agriculture  and  agriculture-related  products;  and  (iv)  improving\ngovernance and building the capacity of provincial and local governments to plan for and support\nrural  economic  development  by  increasing  the  devolution  of  powers  and  development\nresponsibilities.\n\n1. \n\nSouthern Province\n\nSouthern  Province  comprises  three  districts:  Galle,  Hambantota,  and  Matara;  and\n5.\nstretches along the southern coast of Sri Lanka, extending 65 kilometers (km) inland at its widest\npoint.  It has a gross area of 554,200 hectares (ha) and is about 250 km long from the town of\nBentota in the west to Yala National Park in the east. The total population of the province is about\n2.4 million4 of which about 80 percent are considered rural and about 40 percent poor, according\nto the national poverty line.\n\n6.\nLand  forms  range  from  flat  coastal  plains  in  the  south  to  hills  in  the  north;  the  climate\nranges from wet and humid in the west to dry and arid in the east.  As a result, Southern Province\ncovers a wide range of natural ecosystems, and the land and water use patterns as well as the\nagricultural cropping systems are extremely varied. These range from forests and tea estates in\nrolling  upland  country  in  the  north  and  east,  through  low-lying  coconut  and  paddy  areas  in  the\nwetter coastal plains, to semiarid lowland plains in the eastern dry zone. The latter are suitable\nonly for subsistence shifting cultivation or livestock production. Being a coastal province, fisheries\nand fish production are also an important resource use.\n\nAgriculture, the predominant economic activity, contributes about 30 percent of provincial\n7.\nGDP  and  about  48  percent  of  employment.  However,  the  importance  of  agriculture  as  an\nemployer  varies  across  the  province  and  increases  considerably  in  the  east;  36  percent  of  the\npopulation in Galle is dependent on agriculture as compared with 54 percent in Hambantota. The\nmajor  export  crops  grown  in  the  region  include  tea  (43,000  ha),  rubber  (17,000  ha),  coconut\n(46,000  ha),  cinnamon  (19,000  ha),  rice  (76,000  ha),  banana  (11,000  ha),  and  jackfruit  (11,000\nha). The province produces 33 percent of Sri Lanka\u2019s tea and 75 percent of the world\u2019s cinnamon.\nIn  1999/2000,  the  combined  value  of  annual  and  perennial  farm  production  in  the  region  was\nestimated at SLRs25 billion. Most of the tea is grown efficiently, but considerable scope exists for\nintercropping and value addition in coconut areas.\n\n8.\nIndustrial growth in the region has been sparse and contributes only about 10 percent to\nthe  provincial  GDP  and  13  percent  to  employment.5  One  of  the  main  reasons  is  that  Western\n\n                  \n\n4 \n5 \n\nExtrapolated from 1994 sample census data and consisting of about 550,000 households.\nProvincial Planning Secretariat. 2000. Southern Province in Figures. Galle.\n\n\f3\n\nProvince  continues  to  provide  80  percent  of  the  industrial  value  added  in  the  country  and  the\nindustrial base of other provinces, including Southern Province, has remained narrow and unable\nto absorb the large pool of educated workers. Tourism currently accounts for about 14 percent of\nprovincial GDP and 11 percent of employment, but despite potential, the sector has not been able\nto grow.\n\n9.\nAs  with  the  area\u2019s  geographical  characteristics,  socioeconomic  characteristics  are  also\nvaried. Although the human development indicators in Southern Province are relatively high,6 the\nconsumption poverty levels remain high, indicating a lack of economic opportunities in the region.\nThe economy is dominated by agriculture, and the poverty originates both from low productivity in\nagriculture, and more importantly, the sluggish growth of the nonfarm sector. At the same time,\nthe uneconomic size of landholding requires people to engage in off-farm employment to reduce\nvulnerability.7 This currently accounts for 15-20 percent of total income among the lowest quintile.\nThe 1982 census data places the average size of landholding in the province at 0.6 ha, with only\nabout  25  percent  of  households  having  farmlands  of  greater  than  0.8  ha.  Landholdings  of  this\nsize would normally support little more than subsistence activities.8\n\n10. \nThis situation is compounded by high levels of unemployment rates and lack of economic\nopportunities available to a considerable segment of the population. The unemployment rate for\nthe province was 14 percent, compared with the national unemployment rate of 11 percent. The\nhigh  unemployment  rate,  especially  among  the  youth  (33  percent),  and  the  relatively  low\ninvolvement  of  women  in  the  formal  economy  are  two  major  social  problems  in  the  province.\nNational  data  indicates  that  unemployment  levels  among  women  in  the  labor  force  have  been\nconsistently higher than among men throughout the 1990s and the situation in Southern Province\nis similar.9 Increasing youth and female unemployment, despite the high overall school enrollment\nrate  of  73  percent,  is  resulting  in  growing  levels  of  social  dissatisfaction  among  this  potentially\nproductive segment of the population and is emerging as major Government concern.\n\nThis situation can be redressed if the economy of Southern Province can be uplifted from\n11.\nits  prevailing  subsistence-based  production  patterns  to  one  based  on  commercially  focused\nproductive activities. Considerable development assistance has been directed to the province in\nthe last two decades, and a series of irrigation, agriculture, and rural development projects have\nbeen  supported  by  ADB  and  other  development  agencies.  These  have  assisted  in  building  up\ninfrastructure,  and  in  particular,  expanding  the  irrigated  areas  in  the  region  and  promoting  crop\ndiversification,  but  the  region  continues  to  remain  disadvantaged.  The  last  in  the  series  of  ADB\nrural development support initiatives to the region was the Southern Province Rural Development\nProject  (SPRDP),10  which  was  implemented  between  1992  and  2000.  Planned  investments  in\nSouthern Province include the ADB-financed Southern Transport Development Project, which is\nto  construct  a  highway  from  Colombo  to  Matara,  at  the  center  of  the  province.  This  highway,\nwhen completed, will cut the travel time between the two cities from the present four to five hours\nto about one and a half hours, and result in a major economic boost for the region.\n\n12. \nConsultation  with  entrepreneurs,  producers,  processors,  market  associations,  and  local\ngovernments  have  identified  a  wide  range  of  potential  economic  opportunities  for  Southern\n\n                  \n\nDevelopment.

These  include  such  agriculture11  and  agriculture-related  enterprises,  as  intensive\nproduction  and  processing  of  high-value  fruit  and  vegetable  crops;  export-based  floriculture;\ngrading, packaging, and processing of spices; commercially oriented poultry and egg production;\nproduction  and  processing  of  fish;  value-added,  coconut-based  products  and  intercropping  of\ncoconut  lands  with  pasture;  fruit  or  timber  species;  production  and  supply  of  agricultural  inputs\nand animal feeds; commercial dairy and milk-based products; leather and wood-based industries;\nand other supporting services such as transportation, marketing, milling,  packaging, etc. Indeed,\npromotion  of  micro-,  small-,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (MSMEs)  could  provide  a  major\nstimulus  to  agriculture  production,  shifts  to  higher-value  crops  and  cropping  patterns,  and\nincreased exports from Southern Province.\n\n2.\n\nRural Enterprise Support\n\nThe Government recognizes that one of the main means to promote economic growth and\n13.\npoverty reduction in the rural areas is to create an environment in which private rural enterprises\ncan  flourish,  and  that  one  of  the  main  tools  for  accomplishing  this  is  the  provision  of  credit  for\nsuch  enterprises.  Making  credit  more  accessible  to  MSMEs  is  widely  regarded  as  the  most\nappropriate instrument because high costs of capital and its limited availability have been cited as\nthe major constraints to enterprise development. The aggregate demand for small- and medium-\nsized  enterprise  (SME)  credit,  without  including  microcredit,  for  13  domestic  lending  institutions\nwas  estimated  at  $262.5  million  for  1997-2001.    Credit  demand  for  2001  was  placed  at  $68\nmillion.12 Moreover, trends in the country indicate a 15 to 20 percent annual growth in the credit\ndemand for this sector.\n\nThe principal financing available for this type of credit has been from the externally funded\n14. \nrefinance schemes, mainly financed by the World Bank, Japan Bank for International Cooperation\n(JBIC), and ADB. During 1994-1999 these resources supported approximately 25,000 enterprises\nthrough  commercial  banks,  regional  development  banks,  cooperatives,  and  NGOs.13  Of  these,\nslightly more than 50 percent in terms of number and slightly less than 50 percent in terms of loan\namount  were  for  agriculture  and  agriculture-related  activities;  about  15  percent  were  located  in\nSouthern  Province.  The  rapid  disbursement  of  MSME  credit  provided  by  a  range  of  domestic\nlending institutions and international funding agencies indicates the need and likely high level of\nunmet  demand.    Funds  provided  by  JBIC  under  its  Small  and  Micro-Industries  Leader  and\nEntrepreneur Promotion (SMILE) project,14 for example, were fully committed within two years of\nstart-up.\n\nFunds are channeled to the MSMEs through commercial banks, development banks, and\n15. \nnonbank finance companies. The two gaps identified are  (i) the inadequacy of subloans ranging\nfrom SLRs1.0 million to SLRs5.0 million, and (ii) the shortage of term financing (medium- to long-\nterm loans that are more suited to the enterprise sector than short gestation loans). Lack of term\nfunds  in  Sri  Lanka  are  largely  attributed  to  the  Government\u2019s  appropriation  of  funds  from  the\nfinancial system through treasury bills to meet budgetary deficits, largely caused by high defense\nexpenditure  on  the  continuing  civil  war  in  the  country.  The  increased  budget  deficit  in  2000\ncompelled  the  Government  to  increase  its  borrowings  from  the  domestic  market  significantly.\nConsequently, domestic financing of the deficit increased from 6.8 percent of GDP in 1999 to 9.4\n\n                  \n\n11  Agriculture  includes crop production, livestock, fisheries, forestry, and their supporting agro-industries.\n12  Loan 1522-SRI: Small and Medium Enterprise Assistance Project, for $ 55 million, approved on 5 June 1997.\n13  The discussion on credit flow to SMEs is constrained by data limitations as neither the Central Bank of Sri Lanka\nnor  banks  collect  and  collate  SME  data  systematically.  The  information  in  this  document  was  compiled  from\nvarious sources and analysis is primarily based on externally funded projects rather than on overall SME financing\nby banks.\n\n14  The project started in 1997 with funding of $46 million.\n\n\f5\n\npercent  in  2000  (footnote  2).  This  situation  means  that  banks  must  mainly  rely  on  short-term\ndeposits  for  the  bulk  of  their  financing,  thereby  making  credit  both  scarce  and  expensive.\nUnfortunately, equity and venture capital services have not been able to expand and fill the gap in\nlong-term financing, and consequently, entrepreneurs have suffered. An overview of the financial\nsystem in the country is provided in Appendix 2.\n\n16. \nSeveral  commercial  and  development  banks  and  NGOs  are  providing  credit  support  in\nSouthern Province. But most loans are small, averaging $50 to $100 from the NGOs, $250 from\ncooperative rural banks, and about $300 from the regional development bank. Commercial bank\nloans  average  about  $1,000,  but  availability  is  limited.  Loans  provided  under  the  credit\ncomponent of the SPRDP show a similar pattern, with an average loan size of $500; the majority\nrange from $100 to $200. In addition, nearly 90 percent of these loans have been for short-term\npurposes with interest rates ranging from 18 to 36 percent. Term financing has been limited, both\nbecause  of  shortage  of  funds  and  skills  to  administer  such  loans.  Nonetheless,  some\nmicrofinance  institutions  (MFIs)  have  had  a  notable  degree  of  success  in  microenterprise\nfinancing,  for  example,  the  Sarvodaya  Economic  Enterprise  Development  Services  (SEEDS).\nClearly,  the  range  and  terms  of  enterprise  credit  must  be  increased,  especially  in  subsectors\nwhere economic potential is identified.\n\n17.\nOver  a  decade  of  experience  with  enterprise  financing  in  the  country  has  demonstrated\nthat other factors, such as access to technology, requisite skills, and market information, are as\nimportant  as  credit.  In  response  to  these  requirements,  some  encouraging  developments  have\ntaken place in the country, including the recent formation of the National Agribusiness Council (a\nprivate  apex  agency  representing  18  major  agribusiness  associations)  to  support  and  promote\nagribusiness enterprises in the country through policy advocacy, technology, and market linkage.\nIn  addition,  some  private  sector  organizations  including  several  chambers  of  commerce  and\nNGOs  have  established  enterprise  advisory  and  information  services.  A  few  private  sector\nspecialized  skills  development  agencies  have  also  emerged  and  are  imparting  demand-based\ntechnical  and  financial  training  to  entrepreneurs.  But  these  are  clearly  not  adequate  to  address\nthe  needs  of  a  growing  enterprise  sector.  In  addition  most  of  these  facilities  and  services  are\nColombo  based,  have  limited  outreach,  and  therefore  cannot  be  accessed  and  utilized  by  the\nsmaller and outlying entrepreneurs. Success stories include the SEEDS, which is demonstrating\nthe  demand  and  utility  of  such  support  services.  The  SEEDS  rural  enterprise  program  by  2000\nhad  provided  services  to  some  30,000  microenterprises  and  assisted  about  2,800  of  their\nborrowers with market contacts.\n\nB. \n\nGovernment\u2019s Policies and Plans\n\n18.\nOne  of  the  Government\u2019s  new  strategic  initiatives  is  to  harness  pro-poor  growth  by\nimproving  productivity  and  market  access  for  the  small-scale  enterprise  sector.15  It  recognizes\nthat  primary  agriculture  production  alone  is  unlikely  to  generate  significant  increases  in\nemployment  opportunities.  Therefore,  the  Government  is  focusing  on  creating  employment  in\nrural  industry  and  services  as  a  major  means  of  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  Rural\nenterprise promotion is  expected to contribute to poverty reduction, not only through employment\ngeneration but also through linkages with primary agriculture production, service enterprises such\nas  transport,  agriculture  input  supply,  and  other  small  industries.  The  Government  policy\nframework recognizes that facilitating MSMEs is critical to achieving the objectives of expanding\nthe country\u2019s industrial base, efficiently adding value to the country\u2019s resource endowments, and\n\n15  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka.

The  proposed  Project  is  in  line  and  fully  consistent  with\nthese Government policies.\n\n19. With  regard  to  rural  development,  the  Government's  policy  framework  recognizes  that\nseveral  decades  of  public  and  external  development  investments  in  broad-based  rural\ndevelopment  projects  have  resulted  in  little  sustainable  impact.  The  Government  has  thus\ndecided to move away from the earlier integrated rural development project (IRDP) approach to a\nmore  integrated  and  focused  approach  in  rural  development  in  order  to  lay  the  foundation  for\naccelerating  economic  growth.  This  new  genre  of  development  approach  focuses  on  rural\nrevitalization  by  promoting  commercial  activities  in  both  farm  and  nonfarm  sectors  in  active\ncollaboration with the private sector. Simultaneously, the new approach is to be incorporated into\nthe ongoing process of devolution of development responsibilities from the central Government to\nthe provincial councils and elected local governments (pradeshiya sabhas). The Government has\ntermed  this  paradigm  shift  as  \u201crural  economic  advancement.\"  In  other  words,  the  Government\nintends  to  undertake  future  rural  development  efforts  through  REAPs,  reflecting  a  move  away\nfrom a top-down, public sector-led approach to one that is decentralized and includes the private\nsector  as  a  partner  to  stimulate  economic  growth.  The  proposed  Project  will  be  one  of  the  first\nmajor projects designed to operationalize this new strategy.\n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n20.\nIn  the  last  three  decades,  external  funding  agencies,  including  ADB,  have  financed  a\nnumber  of  projects  in  Southern  Province.  Projects  supported  by  ADB  that  primarily  relate  to\nagriculture,  rural  development,  and  infrastructure  improvement  include  the  Uda  Walawe  Rural\nDevelopment  Project,16  Kirindi  Oya  Irrigation  and  Settlement  Project,17  First  and  Second  Tea\nSmallholders Development projects,18 First and Second Perennial Crops Development projects,19\nSouthern  Provincial  Roads  Improvement  Project,20  Southern  Transport  Development  Project,21\nand  the  Southern  Province  Rural  Development  Project  (footnote  10).  The  World  Bank  financed\nthe Third Roads Improvement Project,22 which upgraded class A roads throughout the province.\n\n21.\nIn  terms  of  rural  development,  36  IRDP  projects  were  undertaken  in  Sri  Lanka  during\n1979-2000.23  These  ranged  from  small  efforts  of  less  than  $2.0  million  by  United  Nations\nDevelopment  Programme  and  such  bilateral  agencies  as  Norwegian  Agency  for  Development\nCooperation  (NORAD),  Deutsche  Gesselschaft  fur  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  (GTZ),  and\nSwedish  International  Development  Cooperation  Agency  (SIDA),  to  major  efforts  by  the  World\nBank and ADB (the largest being the World Bank-financed Second Rural Development Project for\n$80.0  million).24  Three  IRDPs  were  implemented  in  Southern  Province,  one  supported  by  ADB\nand  two  supported  by  Swedish  and  Norwegian  assistance  in  Matara  and  Hambantota  districts.\n\n                  \n\n16  Loan 0017-SRI: Walawe Development Project, for $885,000, approved on 23 October 1969.\n17  Loan 0324-SRI: First Kirindi Oya Irrigation and Settlement Project, for $24 million, approved on 9 December 1977;\nLoan  0612-SRI:  Kirindi Oya Irrigation and Settlement Project  (Supplementary),  for  $10  million,  approved  on  9\nDecember 1982; Loan 0794-SRI: Second Kirindi Oya Irrigation and Settlement Project, for $26 million, approved\non 30 October 1986.\n\n18  Loan 0955-SRI: Smallholder Tea Development Project, for $25 million, approved on 21 February 1989.\n19  Loan  0899-SRI: First Perennial Crops Development Project,  for  $17  million,  approved  on  30  August  1988;  Loan\n\n1522-SRI: Second Perennial Crops Development Project, for $20 million, approved on 25 September 1997.\n20  Loan 1567-SRI: Southern Provincial Roads Improvement Project, for $30 million, approved on 30 October 1997.\n21  Loan 1711-SRI: Southern Transport Development Project, for $90 million, approved on 25 November 1999.\n22  Loan 1312-SRI: Third Road Improvement Project, for $55 million, approved on 15 September 1994.\n23  Of  which  two  were  financed  by  ADB:    the  Southern  Province  Rural  Development  Project  and  the  North  Central\n\nRural Development Project.\n\n24  Approved in 1981.\n\n\f7\n\nDetails of external assistance to the rural development sector in Sri Lanka are given in Appendix\n3.\n\n22. \nOther  related  external  assistance  to  the  country  include  the  ADB-funded  Small  and\nMedium  Industries  projects  I  and  II25  and  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Assistance  Project\n(footnote  12),  which  have  supported  the  establishment  of  about  11,500  SMEs  with  dedicated\ncredit lines. The World Bank also assisted the SME sector through two loans during 1979-1987.\nJBIC  provided  two  nationwide  loans:  SMILE  I  and  II  (footnote  14)  to  provide  access  to  term\nfinance for SMEs and to enhance the institutional capacities of participating financial institutions.\nThe second phase of the loan commenced in April 2001.\n\nD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nA  1997  study  of  postevaluated  projects  in  Sri  Lanka26  and  lessons  learned  from  several\n23.\nADB-financed agriculture, rural development, and finance projects highlight the importance of  (i)\nproper  staffing  and  institutional  and  project  management  capability  in  the  executing  and\nin  project  design,\nimplementing  agencies;  (ii)  beneficiary  participation  and \nimplementation, operation, and maintenance; (iii) a flexible project implementation system based\non  a  process-oriented  approach;  (iv)  establishment  of  benefit  monitoring  mechanisms  and\nobtaining pre-project benchmark data; and (v) need for continuous and close monitoring by ADB\nespecially early in project implementation.\n\ninvolvement \n\n24.\nPostevaluation studies of projects in Sri Lanka also highlight the importance of agriculture\nand  rural  credit  schemes  to  be  complemented  by  business  skills  development,  training,  and\nextension services, to ensure that credit is effectively invested and that projects are sustainable.\nRoads and road transport projects have highlighted the need to encourage small contractors and\nimprove their capacity for better maintenance of infrastructure. Lessons learned from ADB-funded\nSME projects indicate that credit lines acted as effective modalities for transferring term capital to\nSMEs, and that participation of banks strengthened their ability to appraise and administer SME\ncredit.  They  also  point  to  the  need  to  upgrade  capacity  of  field  staff,  and  to  closely  monitor\nsubloans.  Lessons  emerging  from  earlier  projects  have  been  fully  incorporated  in  the  design  of\nthis Project.\n\n25.\nThe most critical lessons learned from IRDP implementation in the country is the need to\nuse  a  focused  and  integrated  approach;  involve  the  private  sector  in  efforts  aimed  at  rural\neconomic  regeneration;  and  address  agriculture  production,  processing,  and  manufacturing  as\npart  of  a  continuum  for  economic  advancement.  These  lessons  are  already  incorporated  in  the\nREAP approach adopted by the Government. Another lesson learned from the IRDPs is that the\nimpact of infrastructure has not always been sustainable. Often insufficient provision was made\nfor  the  continued  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  project  infrastructure  and,  in  terms  of\nprivate  sector  support,  not  enough  attention  has  been  paid  to  continuing  support  programs  or\nundertaking  future  sector  expansion.  The  medium-  to  long-term  impacts  have  therefore  been\nsomewhat less than what might have been planned or expected.\n\nIn  terms  of  specific  lessons  to  be  learned  from  projects,  the  most  relevant  project  is  the\n26.\nSPRDP,  which  was  implemented  during  1992-2000  in  Southern  Province.  The  Government's\nevaluation  indicates  that  (i)  adequate  capacity  exists  in  the  provincial  government  to  implement\nrural development projects; (ii) activities such as credit provision for rural enterprises, promotion\n\n                  \n\n25  Loan 0873-SRI: Small and Medium Industries Project, for $15 million, approved on 8 December 1987; Loan 1084-\n\nSRI: Second Small and Medium Industries Project, for $30 million, approved on 30 May 1991.\n\n26  ADB. 1997.

The evaluation also highlighted two other problems: (i) rural roads\nbuilt  under  the  project  are  poorly  maintained  due  to  funding  limitations  and  lack  of  technical\ncapacity in local governments; and (ii) new entrepreneurs need technical guidance and support,\nand access to credit.\n\nExperience from the ongoing North Central Rural Development Project27 provides similar\n27. \nlessons.    Most  notably,  the  project  did  not  provide  a  credit  line  for  rural  enterprises;  financing\nagencies were expected to have sufficient funds to meet the project-generated demand for credit.\nIn  reality,  however,  without  a  designated  credit  line  devoted  to  the  project,  financing  agencies\nwere reluctant to adapt their programs and priorities to project requirements.\n\nE.\n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\nADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy28  emphasizes  pro-poor  sustainable  economic  growth,\n28. \nsocial development, and good governance as its three pillars. It focuses on the development of\nthe  agriculture  and  rural  sectors,  since  it  is  in  the  rural  areas  and  especially  in  the  low-value\nagriculture sector that poverty is most prevalent. The current country operational strategy for Sri\nLanka29 states that given the scarcity of ADB funds and large assistance by other development\nagencies  to  the  sector,  the  approach  for  ADB\u2019s  involvement  in  rural  development  needs  to  be\nreestablished  in  light  of  ADB\u2019s  focus  on  policy  reform  and  institutional  development,  and  the\nGovernment\u2019s  reorientation  of  rural  economic  activities.  While  past  ADB  assistance  has  had  a\nsignificant  development  impact,  a  major  question  has  been  on  the  sustainability  of  project\nbenefits.  The  Government  recently  redirected  its  traditional  approach  for  rural  development  and\nintroduced  the  REAP  policy  framework.  This  is  aimed  at  fostering  rural  development  led  by  the\nprivate  sector  and  transforming  the  Government\u2019s  role  from  a  direct  provider  of  development\nassistance to an enabler or facilitator of sustainable rural development. Given the redirection of\nthe  policy  framework,  ADB\u2019s  country  assistance  plan  (2001-2003)  and  its  country  strategy  and\nprogram  update,  currently  being  finalized,  support  ADB\u2019s  role  in  creating  opportunities  for  the\npoor  to  participate  in  economic  growth  through  the  new  REAP  process.  ADB\u2019s  new  focus  on\npoverty reduction also supports its involvement in rural development in Southern Province where\nthe  incidence  of  poverty  is  high.  The  design  of  the  proposed  Project  is  therefore  entirely\nconsistent with the intent and directions of ADB's country and sector strategy.\n\nF.  \n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\nThe  project  preparation  process  commenced  with  active  consultation  with \n\n29.\nthe\nGovernment,  academicians,  civil  society  representatives,  and  development  partners  on  defining\nthe  Government\u2019s  new  rural  development  approach  in  the  country,  and  its  key  thrusts  and\nimplications. The first consultative output of this process was the REAP strategy and operational\nframework,  which  clarified  the  Government\u2019s  future  policy  on  rural  development;  its  strategic\neconomic  thrust,  the  focus  on  the  nonfarm  sectors,  linkages  between  the  farm  and  nonfarm\nsectors,  private  sector  promotion,  public-private  partnerships  for  economic  growth,  capacity\n\n27  Loan  1462-SRI: North Central Province Rural Development Project,  for  $20  million,  approved  on  24  September\n\n28  R179-99: Fighting Poverty in the Asia and the Pacific: The Poverty Reduction Strategy of the Asian Development\n\n                  \n\n1996.\n\nBank, 19 October 1999.\n\n29 ADB. 1998.

The primary one was the ongoing devolution of development responsibilities\nto  the  provincial  government  and  pradeshiya  sabhas  under  the  Thirteenth  Amendment  to  the\nConstitution. The Government agreed that in keeping with the principle of devolution, the prime\nresponsibility  for  project  implementation  will  rest  with  the  Southern  Provincial  Council  (SPC),\nwhile  much  of  the  actual  implementation  work  will  be  devolved  to  the  pradeshiya  sabhas\nthemselves.  At  the  same  time,  project  preparation  work  raised  the  key  question  of  sustainable\nfunding for rural infrastructure O&M. The Government agreed that any upgrading and transitional\nmaintenance  support  for  rural  infrastructure  to  the  pradeshiya  sabhas  will  be  contingent  upon\ntheir  participation  in  the  financial  management  training,  improved  budgetary  management,\nexpected  counterpart  funding,  and  regular  performance  and  capacity  evaluation  during  project\nimplementation.\n\n31. \nPolicy discussions were also undertaken with the Government and the Central Bank of Sri\nLanka  (CBSL)  on  the  overall  financial  sector  issues  in  the  country,  and  specifically  on  the\ncontinuing  shortage  of  long-term  funds  in  the  system  and  the  consequent  prevalence  of  high\ncommercial lending rates (around 25 percent). These sectorwide issues will be taken up in detail\nwith  the  Government  as  part  of  the  implementation  of  the  Rural  Finance  Sector  Development\nProject.31  For  the  Project,  the  Government  and  ADB  agreed  that  the  project  credit  line  for  term\nfinance  will  be  routed  through  an  apex  commercial  bank,  and  that  the  relending  rates  to\nparticipating financial institutions (PFIs), will be anchored on the average weighted deposit rates\n(AWDR), which are periodically calculated by CBSL. In addition, synergy will be ensured with the\npolicy framework being addressed by the Private Sector Development Program32 and the Small\nand  Medium  Enterprise  Assistance  Project  (footnote  12)  to  increase  private  sector  activity  and\npromote  competition  to  intensify  resource  mobilization,  improve  economic  efficiency,  and  raise\nproductivity.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\n32.\nDespite  economic  growth  of  5.4  percent  during  1990-1999,  development  and  income\ndistribution in Sri Lanka remain uneven. Rural areas of Southern Province continue to suffer from\nhigh levels of poverty and unemployment due to the predominance of low-value agriculture and\nlimited development of value-added enterprises in the region. The Government therefore places\nhigh priority on development investments in Southern Province to stimulate its rural economy and\nachieve more balanced regional development in the country. However, in increasing investments\nin the area, the Government recognizes the importance of a holistic development approach that\npromotes  linkages  between  agriculture  and  industry,  and  addresses  issues  of  backward  and\n\n                  \n\n30\n\nThe  Government  and  the  ADB  agreed  that  restructuring  of  the  central  ministry  and  the  implementation\narrangements be further examined and developed as more experience is gained from REAP implementation.\n\n31   TA 3707-SRI: Rural Finance Sector Development Project, approved for $550,000, on 24 August 2001.\n32  Loan 1800-SRI: Private Sector Development Program, approved for $ 85 million, on 12 December 2000\n\n\f10\n\nforward linkages to provide opportunities for farm households to graduate from their subsistence\nincome  levels  to  micro  and  small  enterprises.  The  Government  is  also  cognizant  of  the  many\ninfrastructure and policy developments that are under way in the province and the country, and\nthat impact on the strategy for rural economic growth.\n\nFirst,  the  Government  intends  (para.  19)  to  operationalize  a  shift  in  its  policy  away  from\n33.\nbroad-based IRDPs to the promotion of commercially oriented activities through linkages with the\nprivate  sector.  Second,  political  will  is  growing  and  the  Government  intends  to  implement,  in\npractice,  the  current  policy  of  devolution  of  power  and  development  responsibility  to  provincial\nand local governments. Third, the Government recognizes that for economic growth to continue,\nassets constructed under the SPRDP and other similar projects must be protected and kept from\ndeteriorating through a sound and sustainably financed O&M program. In addition, considerable\ninfrastructure investments are under way in Southern Province. Prominent among these are the\nproposed highway from Colombo to Matara, and the 550 km of provincial roads being upgraded.\nWhen  completed,  these  two  road  projects  supported  by  ADB  will  considerably  enhance  the\ntransportation network in the region and provide a boost to economic activities.\n\n34.\nIn response to these factors, the Project is designed to focus on stimulating private sector-\nled economic growth in the rural areas of Southern Province, while at the same time developing\nthe physical and institutional environment to support and sustain the process.\n\nB.  \n\nObjective and Scope\n\n35.\nThe  Project's  objective  is  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  accelerate  economic\ngrowth  and  create  additional  income  and  employment  opportunities  in  Southern  Province.  This\nwill be accomplished by (i) establishing and expanding MSMEs in agriculture-related sectors; (ii)\nproviding  and  maintaining  key  economic  infrastructure;  and  (iii)  enhancing  public  and  private\nsector  capacities  to  facilitate,  support,  and  sustain  the  process  of  economic  growth.  Special\nemphasis  will  be  placed  on  unemployed  youth  and  women  with  the  objective  of  providing  them\nwith productive and sustainable income and employment opportunities.\n\n36.\nThe Project comprises two interrelated parts that will be implemented simultaneously. Part\nI  is  intended  to  stimulate  economic  activity  in  the  region  and  includes  support  to  (i)  enterprise\ndevelopment services (EDS); and (ii) a credit line for financing term loans. Part II is intended to\nbuild  an  enabling  environment  for  economic  growth  and  includes  support  for  (i)  providing  rural\ninfrastructure, particularly rural roads and markets; (ii) enhancing technical and financial capacity\nin  local  governments  to  maintain  rural  infrastructure;  (iii)  providing  skills  and  capacity  at  the\nprovincial and Ministry of Plan Implementation (MPI) levels to facilitate private sector participation\nin rural development; and (iv) providing project administration and management.\n\n1.\n\nPart I  Stimulating Economic Growth\n\n37.\nThe  major  part  of  this  component  will  be  a  credit  line  aimed  at  promoting  MSMEs  in\nSouthern Province. Recognizing that a credit line by itself is not sufficient to stimulate economic\ninnovation, the Project will contract private advisory services to provide agricultural producers and\nentrepreneurs  a  link  to  new  technologies,  marketing  channels,  technical  and  managerial  skills,\nfinancial  services,  and  key  information.  The  focus  of  this  component  is  on  stimulating  private\nsector  activity  and  building  up  sustainable  enterprise  support  services.  Part  I  has  two\ncomponents: advisory services to guide entrepreneurs and a credit line to enable investment.\n\n\f11\n\na.\n\nEnterprise Development Services\n\n38.\nConsiderable  potential  exists  in  Southern  Province  for  a  wide  variety  of  economic\nenterprises  in  rural  areas,  including  moving  from  traditional  low-value  crops  to  high-value\nproduction  and  to  secondary  value-adding  activities  (para.  12).  However,  the  majority  of  small\nagriculture producers and entrepreneurs lack technical and market information, skills, access to\nfinancial services, and market linkages.33 They need assistance and advice on possible economic\nventures, with initial project design, appraisal, and costing; technical and financial management;\nidentification and provision of technologies; and identification of potential markets, and sources of\ntraining and information. On the other hand, opportunities for larger enterprises can be facilitated\nby  improving  linkages  with  producers,  technology,  and  financial  services.  The  Project  will\ntherefore support the establishment and expansion of a range of professional EDS in the province\nto  enable  producers  and  entrepreneurs  to  access  necessary  services,  products,  market\ninformation, and contacts in a sustainable manner.\n\n39.\nSeveral  private  sector  and  NGO  agencies  in  the  country  have,  over  the  last  few  years,\ndeveloped  core  competencies  in  this  field.  For  example,  at  the  national  level,  the  National\nAgribusiness Council supports major agribusinesses with technology and marketing linkages, and\nat the local level, SEEDS, an NGO, provides advice to microentrepreneurs. Some EDS initiatives\nhave also been supported in Southern Province by NGOs, development agencies, and a district\nchamber  of  commerce  (Hambantota).  But  the  work  thus  far,  has  largely  been  dependent  on\nexternal/Government  funding or has remained limited to certain kinds of clients (various NGOs\nare  providing  support  to  very  poor  women  for  microenterprises).  The  Project  therefore  aims  to\nfacilitate the development and expansion of a range of enterprise service providers, build synergy\namong  them  to  access  and  share  information,  and  create  an  environment  for  competitive  and\ncosted services.\n\n40.\nA primary objective of this component will be to provide training and guidance to potential\nparticipants in the Project\u2019s credit component. Equally important will be to set up and strengthen\nenterprise development advisory units and enterprise information services, possibly patterned on\nthe  Hambantota  District  chambers  of  commerce.    Other  activities  to  be  undertaken  under  this\ncomponent will include an inventory of potential agribusiness opportunities within the project area;\nidentification of markets and technology linkages for new and existing products; direct provision of\nadvice for larger business proposals; provision of technical support and information linkages for\nEDS providers taking part in the Project; and direct advisory support to special lending programs\nof  financing  institutions  participating  in  the  credit  line.  Entrepreneur  training  will  be  substantially\nimproved  by  incorporating  modules  on  market  linkages,  value  addition,  and  enhanced\ncompetencies (innovation, risk taking, quality, etc.)  The component will operate on the basis of\nproviding  the  full  range  of  services  to  the  new  and  existing  enterprises  to  enhance  viable\ninvestments and improve the technical and managerial efficiency of the sector.\n\nb. \n\nCredit for Economic Growth\n\n41.\nThe country\u2019s banking system is currently short of medium- and long-term funds to finance\nthe long-term credit needs of the MSMEs. The country has experienced a general rise in interest\nrate  charges  and  volatility  over  the  last  several  years.  The  main  causes  have  been  increased\n\n                  \n\n33  The  TA  team  conducted  a  district  stratified  sample  survey  of  352  SMEs  in  the  province  to  identify  types  of\nactivities,  operational  levels,  and  constraints  faced  by  them.  Most  enterprises  surveyed  were  small  (2-20\nemployees  with  capital  investment  of  SLRs50,000-SLRs400,000),  and  most  frequently  reported  the  necessity  of\naddressing  problems  relating  to  credit,  followed  by  technology  and  markets,  if  any  operational  progression  is\nexpected.\n\n\f12\n\npublic sector borrowing, balance of payments deficit, reduced rupee liquidity, and tightening of the\nmonetary policy to contain pressure on exchange rates. The Government\u2019s medium-term strategy\nto  remedy  this  situation  involves  taking  measures  to  reduce  the  fiscal  deficit  under  standby\nagreements  with  the  International  Monetary  Fund  and  issuance  of  long-term  treasury  bonds  to\nstimulate the secondary market. By reducing the Government\u2019s credit demand, term financing will\nlikely be facilitated and a reliable interest rate indicator will emerge. The Project will address the\nfinancing  needs  of  potential  entrepreneurs  in  Southern  Province  and  give  them  access  to  long-\nterm  resources  at  appropriate  rates  and  terms.  Potential  subprojects  to  be  supported  will  be\nagriculture related; including production of high-value crops, and agricultural inputs and supplies,\nprocessing  of  fruits  and  vegetables,  processing  of  industrial  crops,  and  fish  and  livestock\nproducts;  provision  of  agricultural  services  such  as  mechanization  and  irrigation;  operation  of\nstorage, transport, and marketing businesses; and manufacturing and services. Special focus will\nbe placed on unemployed educated youth and women with the objective of providing them with\nproductive employment opportunities.\n\n42.\nTo achieve this, a credit line will be provided to finance medium- and long-term investment\nneeds of about 1,500 SMEs and about 7,000 microenterprises.  Small enterprises are defined as\nthose  with  fixed  assets,  excluding  land  and  buildings,  of  not  more  than  SLRs7  million  on\ncompletion  of  the  subproject.  Microenterprises  are  defined  as  those  having  fixed  assets,\nexcluding land and buildings, of not more than SLRs500,000 on completion of the subproject. The\nADB  credit  line  will  support  70  percent  of  the  total  subproject  cost.  The  PFIs  will  contribute  10\npercent and the balance will be the contribution of the suborrower.\n\n43.\nIn  the  absence  of  a  market-driven  benchmark  interest  rate  for  long-term  investments  in\nthe country (para. 41), the Project will use the AWDR as the anchor for relending to the PFIs. The\nAWDR, determined by CBSL on a monthly basis, captures an element of medium-term interest\nrates, largely reflects the average weighted costs of resources available in the banking system,\nand is therefore considered an appropriate benchmark.34 The National Development Bank (NDB)\nwill  serve  as  the  apex  agency  for  channeling  the  credit  line  and,  as  done  for  other  small  and\nmicroenterprise  projects,  it  will  be  given  a  1  percent  spread  for  this  purpose.  The  1  percent\nspread  to  NDB  will  be  used,  among  others,  to  strengthen  the  PFIs'  capacity,  especially  the\nNGOs,  to  appraise  and  process  medium-  and  long-term  loans  to  the  MSMEs  on  a  sustainable\nbasis.  The  Government  will  bear  the  foreign  exchange  risk  from  the  difference  between  the\nAWDR minus the 1 percent margin to NDB and the borrowing cost.\n\n2.\n\nPart II  Sustaining the Enabling Environment\n\n44. \nPart  II  is  designed  to  enable  the  provincial  council  and  the  pradeshiya  sabhas (the  key\ndevelopment agencies in the decentralized setup) to promote and sustain rural economic growth.\nThe  major  part  of  this  component  will  be  the  provision  of  critical  rural  infrastructure  and  the\ndevelopment of institutional capacity in local governments to maintain it.\n\n45. \nIn the course of the past decade, a large amount of rural infrastructure has been built or\nupgraded  within  Southern  Province  through  a  series  of  externally  funded  projects,  including  the\nSPRDP  and  IRDPs  in  Matara  and  Hambantota.  While  the  provision  of  these  facilities  has  had\npositive impacts on the economic and welfare status of the population of the province, a serious\nproblem has emerged. All of this infrastructure, as well as the previously existing infrastructure,\nneeds  to  be  maintained,  but  funds  available  to  the  provincial  government  and  the  pradeshiya\nsabhas  are  insufficient.  As  a  result,  much  of  the  province's  rural  infrastructure  is  deteriorating,\n\n                  \n\n34  The  AWDR  is  being  used  in  other  ongoing  ADB-funded  projects  with  credit  components.  The  AWDR  was  2\n\npercentage points higher in July  at 11.5 percent , as compared with 9.8 percent during fact-finding in May.\n\n\f13\n\nand if measures are not taken to improve the rural infrastructure maintenance capacity, much of\nthe benefits of past projects and key economic infrastructure will be lost.\n\n46.\nThe  Project  therefore  proposes  to  help  arrest  further  deterioration  of  the  existing  rural\ninfrastructure  in  Southern  Province,  enhance  the  capacity  of  the  pradeshiya  sabhas  to\nsustainably  maintain  and  manage  infrastructure,  and  provide  some  primary  rural  markets  in  the\nproject  area.  This  will  be  accomplished  by  (i)  demonstrating  low-cost  and  technically  sound\nmaintenance  standards  on  unclassified  roads,  and  supporting  local  governments  to  physically\nupgrade  critical  rural  roads  to  a  point  where  recurrent  maintenance  costs  will  be  minimized;  (ii)\nassisting  the  pradeshiya  sabhas  to  better  finance  infrastructure  maintenance  by  improving  their\ncapacity  for  financial  planning,  budgeting,  and  resource  utilization;  and  (iii)  physically  upgrading\nand improving the management of selected rural markets to facilitate rural activities and increase\nlocal revenues.\n\n47.\nIn addition, support will be provided for (i) project management; (ii) enhancement of SPC's\nimplementation capacity, in particular, the Department of Local Government; and (iii) institutional\nstrengthening of MPI.\n\na. \n\nCapacity Building for Pradeshiya Sabhas to Maintain Rural Roads\n\nSouthern  Province  has  about  7,000  km  of  rural  access  roads.  Maintenance  funds  are\n48.\navailable from many sources but are generally sufficient to maintain only about 25 percent of the\nroads. In addition to inadequacy of funding, most pradeshiya sabhas are often not aware of the\nneed for or mechanisms of routine infrastructure maintenance, nor are their limited technical staff\nfamiliar  with  cost-effective  and  technically  sound  maintenance  techniques.  Yet  rural  roads  must\nbe  kept  passable  since  they  are  the  basis  for  the  efficient  functioning  of  the  rural  economy.\nWithout  such  roads,  farmers  either  will  have  no  access  to  markets  or  will  have  to  pay  high\ntransport  costs  to  reach  them.  Moreover,  poor  road  conditions  deter  farmers  from  producing\ncommodities  such  as  fruits,  vegetables,  and  livestock  products  that  could  provide  high  returns.\nThis  component  has  thus  been  designed  to  help  overcome  some  of  the  constraints  facing\npradeshiya  sabhas  that  have  been  charged  with  responsibility  for  maintaining  rural  roads  in  a\npassable condition.\n\n49.\nThe first stage in this activity will involve demonstrating to the pradeshiya sabhas and their\ntechnical  staff  the  best  practices  in  rural  road  maintenance.To  do  this,  one  rural  access  road\napproximately  1  km  in  length  will  be  developed  as  a  demonstration  road  in  each  pradeshiya\nsabha.  These roads will be used to show (i) optimum design standards for rural roads, and (ii)\nlow-cost  measures  that  can  be  taken  to  reduce  maintenance  requirements  and  costs.    Such\nmeasures  include  proper  surface  and  side  drainage,  proper  compaction,  proper  shaping,  and\ntimely pothole filling. These demonstrations will be the basis for the standards set for contractors\nundertaking maintenance for the pradeshiya sabha and will also serve as examples to any private\nindividuals  or  village  communities  that  wish  to  voluntarily  undertake  maintenance  activities.\nConducting these demonstrations will also serve as a technical upgrading exercise for pradeshiya\nsabha technical staff.\n\n50.\nUpon  completion  of  the  demonstration  roads,  the  pradeshiya  sabhas  will  be  given  the\nopportunity  to  identify  and  propose  key  rural  roads,  in  accordance  with  established  selection\ncriteria  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  initial  upgrading  and  preventive  maintenance  works,  and  then  to\nreceive transitional funding from the Project for maintenance, as they mobilize their own budget\nfor maintenance funding. About 30 km of the most important roads will be taken up for transitional\n\n\f14\n\nmaintenance funding for each pradeshiya sabha.35 Such funding will be provided on a declining\nscale  such  that  by  the  end  of  the  Project,  maintenance  funding  will  be  provided  entirely  by  the\npradeshiya sabhas. During the period of transitional maintenance funding, engineering staff of the\nDepartment  of  Local  Government  along  with  project-financed  consultants  will  assist  and  advise\nthe  pradeshiya  sabhas  and  their  technical  staff  on  maintenance  contracting,  supervising,  and\nensuring  technically  acceptable  standards.  Selection  and  design  criteria  for  rural  roads  to  be\ntaken up under the Project are given in Appendix 4.\n\n51.\nTo fully avail of the financing provided through this component, the pradeshiya sabhas will\nneed  to  enter  into  an  agreement,  satisfactory  to  ADB,  with  SPC  to  participate  in  the  road\nupgrading and training exercise and to continue to maintain roads improved under the Project. To\nensure such compliance, improvement works in each pradeshiya sabha will be limited to 10 km\nas a first step. The balance of the work will be undertaken based on an evaluation conducted by\nthe  Project  Management  Office  (PMO)  of  the  pradeshiya  sabha\u2019s  performance  and  compliance\nwith  the  commitments  made  under  the  agreement.  A  draft  memorandum  of  understanding  is\nshown in Appendix 5.\n\n b.\n\nMarket Upgrading and Improvement\n\n52.\nThe  92  formal  markets  in  Southern  Province  and  their  environs  provide  the  foremost\nproducer  marketing  channel  for  fresh  produce,  and  constitute  accumulation  points  for  the\ntransport of produce to other parts of the country. Moreover market fees constitute a major part of\nthe  self-generated  income  of  the  pradeshiya  sabhas.  (Other  revenue  sources  include  limited\ngrants from the national and provincial governments, and local levies and taxes imposed by local\ngovernments).\n\n53.\nMost  markets  in  the  project  area  are  poorly  developed  and  poorly  maintained,  largely\nbecause of poor management. Yet they represent the most important source of direct revenue for\nthe  pradeshiya  sabhas;  this  could  be  substantially  increased  if  these  markets  were  better\ndeveloped  and  better  managed.  Once  markets  are  improved  with  better  facilities  and  or\nexpanded,  the  pradeshiya  sabhas  could  charge  higher  fees  and  accommodate  more  lessees,\nthereby  enhancing  revenues  for  the  maintenance  of  all  infrastructure,  including  roads,  in  their\njurisdiction.\n\n54.\nAccording to studies undertaken by SPC, the cost of improvements required for a number\nof markets studied, varies from about $50,000 to about $400,000. The Project will thus support\nmarket development and upgrading by providing financing for market improvement, which may be\ndrawn upon by a pradeshiya sabha that meets the selection criteria satisfactory to SPC and ADB,\nand is willing to commit to improved O&M practices and continued maintenance. Selection criteria\nfor markets to be taken up by the Project are given in Appendix 6.\n\n55.\nParticipation  in  the  Project  will  be  closely  linked  with  the  pradeshiya  sabha  drawing  up\nplans  for  the  sustainable  operation  of  the  market  through  adequate  levels  of  user  fees  and\nmanagement of the facilities by a market traders association, rather than through the tendering of\nfee collection on an annual basis as is currently the practice. Market designs will be finalized in\nconsultation  with  market  users.  Consulting  services  will  be  provided  to  help  design  market\nupgrading that best meets the needs of market users (and potential future commercial ventures).\nOn  the  basis  of  a  notional  average  upgrading  cost  of  $100,000  per  market,  $2.0  million  will  be\nprovided to cover 20 markets under this component.\n\n35  Only those rural roads linked with operable A, B, C, D, or E roads will be taken up for maintenance.\n\n                  \n\n\f15\n\nc.\n\nFinancial Management Advice\n\n56.\nGiven  the  limited  funding  base  of  the  pradeshiya  sabhas  and  their  lack  of  experience  in\naccounting, budgeting, and income generation, the pradeshiya sabhas require advice on how to\nmake best use of their financial resources and their legislated income-generating powers to fulfill\ntheir local government mandates. In many cases, opportunities for income generation do exist but\nare  underutilized.36  In  other  cases,  the  pradeshiya  sabha  must  be  able  to  identify  real  priority\nactivities that must be undertaken to ensure continued or improved levels of either public welfare\nor  economic  activity.  The  provision  of  advice  and  training  on  sound  financial  management  and\nresource utilization for staff and elected members of the pradeshiya sabhas will be undertaken as\nan integral part of the package of rural road and market upgrading activities.  Such advice will be\nprovided on a one-to-one basis by public finance advisers recruited under the Project.\n\n d.\n\nProject Management Office\n\n57.\nA professionally administered PMO is needed to coordinate and monitor project activities.\nThe  PMO  will  need  to  coordinate  with  and  contract  EDS  providers,  coordinate  with  financial\ninstitutions,  set  up  and  support  enterprise  development  and  information  centers,  administer  the\ninfrastructure  component,  and  undertake  the  project  implementation  monitoring  and  evaluation\ntasks.  The  office  facilities  established  for  the  SPRDP  in  Galle  will  be  utilized  for  the  Project.\nFunds  will  be  provided  for  transportation  requirements,  incremental  staff  salaries,  operational\nequipment, and materials. In addition, the Project will provide small support offices in each of the\nthree districts: Galle, Hambantota, and Matara, to coordinate and monitor the project activities at\nthe district level. Existing offices of the IRDPs in Hambantota and Matara districts will be utilized.\nFinancing will also be provided for the incremental staff equipment and materials needed by the\nDepartment of Local Government to properly supervise and implement the rural road and market\nimprovement activities to be undertaken by the Project.  Funds will be provided for training project\nstaff and staff of the Department of Local Government on subjects and activities relevant to their\nduties under the Project.\n\ne.\n\nSupport for MPI, SPC, and the Pradeshiya Sabhas\n\nThe changeover from the traditional IRDP approach to the REAP approach requires that\n58.\nMPI  and  SPC  staff  acquire  new  skills  to  facilitate  and  promote  private  sector  participation,  to\naddress  themselves  to  policy  and  regulatory  issues  in  sectors  proposed  to  be  promoted,  and\ndevelop  capacity  to  work  and  coordinate  with  a  range  of  partners.  The  Project  will  assist  MPI,\nSPC, and PMO to discharge these responsibilities.  For SPC and PMO, these include training in\nenterprise  development,  business  promotion,  and  marketing,  as  well  as  public  relations  and\ninformation management. For the elected members and staff of the pradeshiya sabhas, support\nwill be provided to brief them on the intent and implementation arrangements for the Project, and\nto  guide  them  on  how  to  participate  and  benefit  to  the  maximum  extent.  This  will  be\nsupplemented  by  courses  and  seminars \nin  governance,  public  management,  public\naccountability,  interaction  with  the  private  sector,  and  development  planning.    SPC  will  receive\nsupport to undertake special policy studies, to upgrade skills and equipment in the Department of\nLocal  Government,  and  to  strengthen  and  fully  utilize  the  existing  Provincial  Management  and\nTraining Institute at Wackwella as a venue for project-related training programs.  Some funds will\nbe provided for local and international study visits for officials of the best-performing pradeshiya\nsabhas,  enterprise  development  service  providers,  and  entrepreneurs  as  an  incentive  and\nrecognition of their performance under the Project.  At the national level, project support will be\n\n                  \n\n36  One pradeshiya sabha visited charges only SLRs135 per year for market stalls, which could well command such a\n\nrate on a daily basis, generating over SLRs700,000 annually from the 15 stalls available.\n\n\f16\n\nprovided  to  establish  and  equip  a  private  sector  promotion  and  policy  unit  under  the  MPI\nsecretary. The unit will develop strategies to enhance working relationships and coordination with\nthe private sector and to identify and pursue key policy and regulatory issues in the sector.\n\nC.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n59. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project,  inclusive  of  taxes,  duties,  and  physical  and  price\ncontingencies,  is  estimated  at  $42.7  million  equivalent,  comprising  $13.2  million  in  foreign\nexchange and $29.5 million equivalent in local currency costs (Table 1).

The loan will have a repayment period of 32\nyears including an 8-year grace period, and will carry an interest charge of 1.0 percent per annum\nduring  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  thereafter.  The  loan  will  finance  $11.2  million  of  the\nforeign  exchange  cost  and  $13.8  million  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The  OPEC  Fund\nwill provide $5 million to finance portions of rural roads and markets. The OPEC Fund loan will\nhave  a  maturity  of  20  years  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  with  an  interest  rate  of  1.5\n\n\fpercent  per  annum  and  a  service  charge  of  1.0  percent  per  annum.  ADB  has  been  asked  to\nadminister  the  OPEC  Fund  loan.  The  remaining  local  currency  cost  of  about  $12.7  million\nequivalent,  will  be  met  by  other  sources  including  the  Government  ($6.7  million),  PFIs  ($2\nmillion), and beneficiaries ($4.0 million). The proposed financing plan is in Table 2.\n\n17\n\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ '000)\n\nSource\n\nADB\nOPEC Fund\nGovernment\nPFIs\nBeneficiaries\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\n   Local\nCurrency\n\n           Total\n           Cost\n\nPercent\n\n 11,200.0\n     2,000.0\n       0.0\n       0.0\n       0.0\n\n    13,800.0\n      3,000.0\n      6,700.0\n      2,000.0\n      4,000.0\n\n        25,000.0\n          5,000.0\n          6,700.0\n          2,000.0\n          4,000.0\n\n58.0\n12.0\n16.0\n5.0\n9.0\n\n     Total\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  OPEC  Fund  =  Organization  of  Petroleum  Exporting\nCountries Fund for International Development, PFIs = participating financial institutions.\nSource:  Mission estimates.\n\n        42,700.0\n\n     29,500.0\n\n   13,200.0\n\n 100.0\n\nThe level of local currency for financing proposed by ADB takes into account the recent\n61.\nmacroeconomic imbalances, uncertain medium-term economic prospects, and the Government\u2019s\ninability to finance a substantial portion of the investment program required to enable Sri Lanka to\nundergo  social  and  economic  transformation  and  to  reduce  the  high  incidence  of  poverty.  The\nintensified  civil  conflict  since  April  2000  has  resulted  in  higher  security-related  expenditures,\nreaching 5.6 percent of GDP and the budget deficit expanding to 9.9 percent of GDP in 2000 from\n7.5  percent  in  1999.  Increased  imports  of  defense-related  goods,  together  with  high  oil  prices,\ncaused  the  current  account  deficit  to  deteriorate  in  2000.  As  a  result,  foreign  reserves\nsubstantially  declined  to  $1  billion  at  the  end  of  2000,  and  were  then  able  to  cover  only  1.5\nmonths of imports.\n\n62.\nThe  Government  is  currently  undertaking  an  economic  reform  program  with  assistance\nfrom  the  International  Monetary  Fund  to  stabilize  macroeconomic  imbalances  by  reducing  the\noverall budget deficit to 8.5 percent in 2001 and to around 7 percent in 2002. This is supported by\nstrengthening  the  tax  administration  and  collection  system,  curbing  growth  in  the  wage  bill  of\nGovernment employees, and reducing security-related spending by 1.3 percent in 2001. Despite\nthese  efforts,  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  to  self-finance  the  public  investment  program  in  the\ncoming years is expected to be limited. Therefore, continued ADB support for local cost financing\nis  justified  in  view  of  prevailing  difficult  country  circumstances  and  the  need  for  a  substantial\ninvestment program to successfully reduce poverty and move to a higher growth path.\n\nE.\n\nExecuting Agency\n\n63.\nMPI  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project.  MPI  and  specifically  the  Regional\nDevelopment  Division  (RDD)  within  it,  has  been  responsible  for  implementing  integrated  rural\ndevelopment projects since 1979.37 RDD is headed by a director general and is  mandated by a\nCabinet  decision  to  be  the  responsible  coordinating  agency  for  all  regional  development  and\nREAPs.  Block  budgets  for  all  national  and  externally  assisted  rural  development  projects  are\n\n37 While  the  name  of  the  ministry  itself  has  changed  several  times  in  the  past  two  decades,  the  role  of  RDD  has\n\n                  \n\nremained more or less constant.\n\n\f18\n\nchanneled  through  MPI-RDD,  even  after  the  responsibility  for  implementation,  monitoring,\nsupervision, and day-to-day project management has been vested in the provincial councils.\n\n64.\nMPI-RDD  has  been  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  two  ADB  projects  in  the  last\ndecade:  (i)  the  SPRDP  that  closed  in  May  2000;  and  (ii)  the  North  Central  Rural  Development\nProject,  currently  under  implementation.  It  has  functioned  efficiently  in  implementing  both  the\nprojects. It is also therefore, well-versed with ADB procedures, and has a satisfactory record for\nmonitoring  project  activities,  commissioning  and  undertaking  impact  assessment,  and  in\nsubmitting progress reports and audited financial statements.\n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1. \n\nImplementing Agencies\n\n65.\nSPC  is  one  of  nine  provincial  councils  set  up  under  the  Thirteenth  Amendment  to  the\nConstitution  and  the  Provincial  Councils  Act  of  1987.  It  is  an  elected  body  headed  by  a  chief\nminister (selected from the party with the majority of seats). SPC is served by a secretariat that\nhas  a  staff  of  about  1,000.  The  chief  secretary  heads  the  provincial  administration.  Devolved\nprovincial  responsibilities  include  education,  rural  development,  agriculture,  cooperatives,  and\nhealth, each of which is the responsibility of a separate department within the Secretariat and is\nheaded by a secretary. Staff turnover is not high, and therefore local knowledge and commitment\nlevels are high.38\n\n66.\nThe SPRDP project office was located in the planning office of SPC, which successfully\nfulfilled its role in implementing the project. The PMO for the SPRDP is still partially in place and\nstaff experienced in implementing an ADB-financed project are available. The same applies to the\nIRDP project offices in Matara and Hambantota.  Supervising the implementation of the proposed\nProject  will  thus  be  well  within  the  capacity  of  SPC,  although  appropriate  upgrading  would  be\nnecessary  to  prepare  the  selected  staff  for  the  Project\u2019s  increased  economic  and  private  sector\norientation.\n\n67.\nNDB  is  a  majority  privately  owned  bank  listed  on  the  Colombo  stock  exchange.\nEstablished  in  1979,  it  has  a  staff  of  396  and  is  managed  by  a  board  of  11  national  and\ninternational  directors.  It  has  played  a  key  role  in  providing  term  finance  to  the  private  sector\nespecially  for  SMEs.  NDB  is  in  the  process  of  transforming  itself  from  a  project  financing\ninstitution  to  a  universal  bank,  providing  one-stop  banking  facilities.  It  now  has  10  branches  for\nretail  banking,  one  of  which  is  in  the  project  area  (Matara).  It  set  up  an  office  in  Galle,  the\nprovincial capital of Southern Province at the end of 2000.\n\n68.\nNDB has strong financial fundamentals, adequate reserves, and profitability. At the end of\n2000, its total assets stood at  $416 million and annual profit at $5.6 million. Returns on assets\nand equity in the year were 1.37 percent and 9.19 percent, respectively. Its capital adequacy ratio\nat  13  percent  of  risk-weighted  assets  is  well  above  CBSL's  requirements.  NDB  is  audited  by\ninternational  auditors  and  has  been  complying  with  all  prudential  regulations  of  CBSL.  It  has\nshown diligence in the management of assets, liabilities, and risks associated with its operations.\nIn addition, NDB has functioned as the apex agency for past ADB-funded SME projects, and in\nJBIC-funded projects. Its role as an apex has been consistently commended by funding agencies\nfor timely reporting, controls exercised over the PFIs, and the close dialogue maintained between\n\n38  The current chief secretary has been in this position for the last seven years and has been a very active participant\n\n                  \n\nin the project preparation process.\n\n\f19\n\nfunding agencies and the PFIs. NDB performance and financial fundamentals therefore support\nits selection as the apex unit for the Project.\n\n2.\n\nProject Organization and Management\n\nThe  project's  organization  chart  is  shown  in  Appendix  8.  MPI  will  be  responsible  for\n69.\nbudgeting, ensuring timely and smooth flow of funds to the provincial council and NDB, for overall\nmonitoring  of \ninterministerial  and/or  development  assistance\ncoordination for project activities, policy advice and guidance to SPC and NDB, and resolution of\nany issues or disputes that may arise during implementation.\n\nimplementation  progress, \n\n70.\nSPC and NDB will be responsible for the day-to-day implementation of the Project. SPC\nwill be responsible for overall implementation and coordination of the project components working\nthrough  the  PMO  to  be  established  in  the  administrative  headquarters  of  Southern  Province  in\nGalle.  For  Part  I  of  the  Project,  SPC  will  select  and  contract,  on  terms  satisfactory  to  ADB,\nreputable  and  experienced  enterprise  development  service  and  training  providers;  and  develop\nan acceptable work plan with the service providers and PFIs to address the Project's objective,\nand oversee its implementation. In addition SPC will be responsible for the implementation and\nsupervision  of  Part  II  of  the  Project,  including  the  recruitment  and  supervision  of  consulting\nservices  and  coordination,  and  liaison  with  the  participating  pradeshiya  sabhas.  SPC  will  enter\ninto an agreement with each participating pradeshiya sabha, satisfactory to ADB, governing the\nparticipation of the pradeshiya sabha in Part II of the Project. Actual implementation of the rural\nroad  maintenance  activities  and  market  infrastructure  upgrading  will  be  undertaken  by  the  local\npradeshiya sabhas under the technical guidance of the Department of Local Government.\n\nNDB will be responsible for supervising the financial services component of Part I of the\n\n71.\nProject, which will be undertaken by the PFIs, and for the training of PFI staff.\n\nThree committees will oversee and supervise project implementation. At the national level,\n72.\na  national  coordination  committee  will  be  established  under  the  MPI  secretary  and  will  consist\namong others, of the chief secretary of SPC, the project director, the lead EDS technical support\nprovider  and    representatives  of  the  Department  of  External  Resources,  National  Planning\nDepartment,  NDB,  national  chambers  of  commerce,  and  the  private  sector.  This  committee  will\nbe responsible for (i) addressing issues referred to it by the provincial advisory committee and the\nproject  management  committee,  (ii)  reviewing  the  progress  of  project  implementation,  and  (iii)\ncoordinating among and between participating agencies in the Project.\n\n73.\n  At  the  provincial  level,  a  provincial  advisory  committee  will  be  chaired  by  the  chief\nsecretary  of  SPC,  and  include  the  project  director,  a  representative  of  NDB,  professionals  from\nRuhuna  University,  representatives  from  the  regional  and  district  chambers  of  commerce,  the\nthree  district  secretaries,  and  the  regional  manager  of  CBSL  at  Matara.  This  committee  will  be\nresponsible  for  providing  advice  and  guidance  to  the  PMO  and  act  as  a  think  tank  to  provide\nsuggestions on maximizing the role of the private sector, mobilizing the pradeshiya sabhas and\nidentifying new investment opportunities as well as enterprise support requirements.\n\n74.\nA  project  management  committee  will  be  established  under  the  chief  secretary  of\nSouthern Province and include the project director (as secretary), representatives of NDB and all\nPFIs,  the  commissioner  for  local  government,  the  lead  EDS  technical  support  provider,\nrepresentatives  from  other  contracted  service  providers,  and  the  three  district  directors.  This\ncommittee will act as the steering committee for the Project and will be responsible for discussing\nand resolving all project-related issues, approving the annual work plan and periodically reviewing\n\n\f20\n\nproject progress. It shall also coordinate project activities with other national and provincial level\nprograms, avoid duplication of effort with other programs and projects, and identify any gaps in\nterms of services, information supply, and technology.\n\n3. \n\nProject Management Office\n\n75. \nThe PMO put in place for the SPRDP will be revamped for the Project and will have five\nunits: (i) EDS technical support; (ii) infrastructure; (iii) budget, finance, and accounts; (iv) training\nand  administration;  and  (v)  monitoring  and  evaluation.    It  will  be  headed  by  a  suitably  qualified\nfull-time  project  director  acceptable  to  ADB,  who  will  be  selected  and  appointed  in  accordance\nwith  the  Government\u2019s  procedures  for  recruitment  of  project  staff  for  foreign-assisted  projects.\nThe  project  director  will  be  assisted  by  an  adequate  number  of  suitably  qualified  personnel  to\nhead  and  staff  the  other  units,  also  in  accordance  with  the  aforementioned  procedures.  The\nproject director will have sufficient authority and rank to perform the required functions of the post\nand  be  responsible  for  implementing,  coordinating,  and  monitoring  of  all  components  of  the\nProject. Specific functions include: (i) preparing the annual work program and drafting budget for\nthe Project; (ii) contracting and supervising agencies selected to provide enterprise development\nadvisory services; (iii) contracting and administering consulting services and training including the\npreparation  of  a  training  program;  (iv)  supervising  and  monitoring  all  procurement  of  equipment\nand  civil  works  contracts;  (v)  implementing,  monitoring,  including  liaising  with  the  PFIs;  (vi)\nsupervising  and  coordinating  project  benefit  monitoring;  and  (vii)  liaising  with  ADB  including  the\nsubmission  of  withdrawal  applications  and  periodic  progress  reports.  The  three  district  offices,\nfunctioning under the direction of the project director, will deal with local coordination issues and\nmonitor the implementation of project activities. All project staff will be given sufficient orientation\ntraining  in  the  new  concepts  being  introduced  by  the  Project,  especially  private  sector\nparticipation.\n\n4.\n\nSpecific Implementation Arrangements\n\na.\n\nPart  I\n\ni.\n\nEnterprise Development Support and Training\n\n76. \nThe PMO will contract, prior to loan effectiveness, a private sector partner that possesses\nadequate  background  and  experience  in  supporting  enterprise  development  in  the  agriculture\nsector, has linkages with the agribusiness community, and is willing to provide technical support\nto  the  project  office  for  the  duration  of  the  Project.  The  partner  will  be  housed  in  the  PMO  and\nfunction as the private sector technical arm of the PMO. It will support the PMO in (i) undertaking\nindustry  and  sector  surveys  to  identify  market  opportunities  and  the  region's  competitive\nadvantages; (ii) disseminating information; (iii) establishing linkages and networks for accessing\ninformation,  technologies,  and  markets;  and  (iv)  building  up  indigenous  capacity  to  provide\nenterprise  development  services  on  a  sustainable  basis.  Terms  of  reference  for  the  lead  EDS\ntechnical support provider in the PMO are provided in Appendix 9.\n\nSome  consulting  support  will  be  provided  to  assist  the  PMO  in  determining  mutually\n77.\nagreeable  target  groups,  achievement  indicators,  and  work  programs,  and  negotiating  fees  and\ncontracts  with  EDS  providers.  In  negotiating  contracts,  the  intent  that  the  provision  of  services\nshould ultimately be self-financing and self-sustaining will be kept in view, and services that could\nbe  charged  for  will  be  investigated.  Contracts  will  be  in  two  forms,  in  each  case  satisfactory  to\nADB, including a retainer contract in which an agreement is entered into by PMO and the agency\nconcerned that it will provide services for the Project for a certain period at a particular rate, and a\n\n\f21\n\ncontract  for  specific  identified  activities.  The  latter  may  entail  adaptive  research,  specialized\ntraining,  study  tours,  market  development  activities,  or  specialized  consultancies  depending  on\nthe identified needs that emerge during project implementation. Each EDS provider will develop\nan annual work plan satisfactory to ADB.\n\nii.\n\nFinancial Services\n\n78.\nNDB  will  serve  as  the  apex  agency  for  the  provision  of  the  Project's  credit  line.  Its\nperformance and financial fundamentals were assessed. The credit component will be provided\nby the Government to NDB under a subsidiary loan agreement satisfactory to ADB.  As the apex\nagency,  NDB  will  (i)  review  and  approve  subloan  applications  from  the  PFIs  for  eligibility  and\ncommercial viability, (ii) disburse loan proceeds, (iii) supervise the enterprise financing activities\nof the PFIs, (iv) compile and evaluate data on project progress; (v) provide training on enterprise\nfinancing to PFI staff; (vi) ensure PFI compliance with CBSL and Ministry of Finance guidelines;\nand (vii) coordinate with the Government and ADB for effective project implementation.\n\nEligibility criteria have been  developed and agreed to guide the selection of PFIs under\n79. \nthe  Project.  Financial  institutions  with  branch  networks  in  the  project  area,  experience  with\nlending  to  MSMEs  and  quality  of  MSME  portfolio  were  extensively  assessed,  and  the  following\nwere  identified  as  PFIs:  Hatton  National  Bank,  NDB,  Development  Finance  Corporation  of\nCeylon, Seylan Bank, Commercial Bank of Ceylon, Bank of Ceylon, Ruhuna Development Bank,\nand  SEEDS.  Each  PFI  will  be  required  to  enter  into  a  participation  agreement  with  NDB,\nsatisfactory  to  ADB,  and  will  be  subject  to  monitoring  both  by  NDB  and  PMO.  The  eligibility\ncriteria for PFI selection is in Appendix 10.\n\n80. \nAs  the  administrator  and  manager  of  the  credit  line,  NDB  will  receive  funds  from  the\nGovernment  at  AWDR  minus  1  percent  for  onlending  to  the  PFIs.  The  PFIs  will  add  their\ntransaction cost (currently ranging from 5.5 percent to 7 percent) to the AWDR and onlend to end\nborrowers.  The  maximum  subproject  size  is  pegged  at  SLRs7  million  for  small  enterprises  and\nSLRs500,000  for  microenterprises.  Since  many  NGOs  and  other  government  programs  are\nalready  providing    small  loans  (SLRs30,000  and  below)  to  the  poor  in  rural  areas  and  because\nthe Project is aiming at generating economic activity and scaling up microenterprises, a minimum\nloan  ceiling  is  set  at  SLRs40,000  to  target  viable  investments  and  to  minimize  substitution\npossibilities. The maximum maturity of subloans (7 years) is fixed, based on the utilization of the\ncredit  line  under  the  SME  assistance  project.39  Lending  for  subprojects  will  be  collateral  based\nand  all  credit  risks  will  be  borne  by  the  PFIs.  NDB  and  the  PFIs  will  be  financed  on  a\nreimbursable basis. NDB will submit quarterly reports to the PMO and ADB on the overall credit\nactivities, including details on net approvals, disbursements, collection ratio, the characteristics of\nSME  borrowers,  and  the  impact  of  subprojects.  Further  details  on  financing  arrangements  are\nprovided in a supplementary appendix, which is available on request.\n\n81.\nTo  ensure  that  subborrowers  have  the  necessary  skills,  information,  technology,  and\nmarketing links, the Project provides an additional tier of scrutiny.  All borrowers will be required\nto  route  their  proposals  to  the  PFIs  through  selected  EDS  providers  and  to  seek  guidance,  as\nnecessary, prior to applying for loans. This requirement will be validated by NDB when refinance\nis sought for such subloans by the PFIs. SEEDS, as the NGO PFI, combines its credit package\nwith enterprise development service to clients. As such, SEEDS, and not the EDS provider, will\nbe  required  to  ensure  and  certify  that  clients  have  acquired  the  necessary  skills,  training,  and\nmarket linkages for managing their enterprises. However, all PFIs retain the right to approve or\n\n39  Eighty-four percent of total subprojects under this project were for a maturity period of 3-5 years, 12 percent  for 5-\n\n                  \n\n7 years, and 4 percent for 7-10 years.\n\n\fdisapprove  any  loan  application  depending  on  their  independent  assessment  and  will  advise\nPMO accordingly.\n\n22\n\niii.\n\nRevolving Fund\n\n82. Within one year after the ADB loan becomes effective, NDB will establish a revolving fund\nto credit interest payments and principal repayment by the PFIs under the Project. The resources\nof  the  revolving  fund  will  be  utilized  for  second  generation  loans  for  eligible  subprojects  and\namortization of loans received from the Government. NDB will operate the revolving fund for 15\nyears. The revolving fund will be audited by independent auditors to assess the inflow and outflow\nof resources, and the application of funds.\n\niv.\n\nTraining of PFI Staff\n\n83.\nTraining  and  orientation  will  be  provided  by  NDB  for  PFI  staff  on  EDS  operations  under\nthe  Project  and  on  investment  appraisal  and  risk  analysis,  working  capital  management,  asset\nand  liability  management,  and  product  development  and  marketing.  Necessary  curriculum  and\nmaterials  acceptable  to  ADB  will  be  developed  especially  for  NGO-PFIs  by  NDB.  Training  will\ninclude  classroom  and  case-study  materials  and  approaches  as  well  as  exposure  visits  to\nborrowers  and  their  businesses.  Refresher  training  will  be  provided  as  course  follow-up.  The\nrelated costs will be covered by NDB from the spread it receives under the Project. NDB will also\ngive recognition awards to best performing PFIs under the Project.\n\nb.\n\nPart II\n\n84.\nSPC, as the Implementing Agency for Part II, will work through the PMO, which in turn will\nwork closely with the Department of Local Government. At the inception of the Project, staff of the\nDepartment of Local Government will contact each pradeshiya sabha to explain the Project and\ntheir  role  in  it.  Road  maintenance  demonstrations  will  be  prepared  on  selected  demonstration\nroads  (approximately  1  km  in  length)  in  each  pradeshiya  sabha  with  assistance  from  project\nconsultants and under the supervision of the Department of Local Government. SPC will ensure\nthat the technical staff of the pradeshiya sabha are  fully involved in this process.\n\n85.\nEach pradeshiya sabha will then be given the option to participate in initial upgrading and\nmaintenance of about 30 km of roads, provided they agree to abide by the agreed road selection\ncriteria,  are  willing  to  participate  in  the  financial  capacity  development  program  and  are  able  to\ndemonstrate  their  commitment  and  ability  to  improve  their  annual  financing  for  infrastructure\nmaintenance  over  a  four-year  period.  During  the  first  year,  upgrading  and  preventive\nmaintenance  will  be  undertaken  to  ensure  lower  subsequent  maintenance  costs.  The  amount\nallocated  for  the  first  year  of  upgrading  will  thus  be  SLRs750,000  per  km,  financed  fully  by  the\nProject. From year two, SLRs75,000 per km/year is budgeted for annual maintenance.  This will\nbe  shared  by  the  pradeshiya  sabha  and  the  Project  on  the  following  basis:  year  2:    Project  75\npercent,  pradeshiya sabha 25 percent; year 3: Project 50 percent, pradeshiya sabha 50 percent;\nyear  4:  Project  25  percent,  pradeshiya  sabha  75  percent;  year  5  and  subsequently:  pradeshiya\nsabha 100 percent.\n\n86.\nTo  qualify  for  financing  and  TA,  the  pradeshiya  sabhas  will  enter  into  individual\nparticipation agreements with SPC, within three months of loan effectiveness and satisfactory to\nADB, setting out the terms of their participation, including the agreement to provide the required\ncounterpart costs. The Government will ensure that at least one month prior to the end of each\nproject  year  in  which  road  maintenance  funding  will  be  provided,  each  pradeshiya  sabha\n\n\f23\n\ndemonstrates,  to  the  satisfaction  of  ADB,  that  it  has  budgeted  the  full  amount  of  the  required\ncontribution to road maintenance for the upcoming project year and has the capacity to manage\nthe funds. Each pradeshiya sabha will prepare and present an annual action plan along with the\nexpected annual budget allocation, prior to disbursement of any funds to them. In addition, prior\nto approving preventive maintenance funding beyond 10 km of roads, the PMO will undertake a\nfull  review  of  the  technical  and  financial  capacity  of  the  pradeshiya  sabhas  and  their  budgetary\nallocation  to  O&M  of  roads.  Further  funding  will  be  contingent  on  each  individual  pradeshiya\nsabha abiding  by  the  terms  and  agreements  contained  in  the  participation  agreement  and  their\nperformance evaluation.\n\n87. \nSimilarly,  pradeshiya  sabhas  wanting  to  improve  their  market  facilities  can  file  a  request\nwith  the  PMO,  specifying  improvements  planned,  and  how  the  market  management  and\nmaintenance  will  be  undertaken  once  the  improvements  are  completed.    Solid  and  liquid  waste\ndisposal  plans  will  also  be  required.  Advice  will  be  provided  on  market  design  and  market\nmanagement  by  the  Department  of  Local  Government  staff  in  consultation  with  project\nconsultants. Prior to the final decision to design and construct a particular market, the pradeshiya\nsabha  concerned  will  agree  to  prepare  a  market  management  plan  and  formulate  a  financing\nstructure  that    would  allow  the  market  to  operate  on  a  sustainable  basis  with  maximized\nrevenues.  Assistance  will  be  provided  to  the  pradeshiya  sabha  in  preparing  the  market\nmanagement and financing plans and designing the physical structure and layout of the market\nimprovements.  The market design and layout will avoid standard, replicated design, and will be\ndeveloped  in  consultation  with  market  users,  focusing  on  providing  facilities  to  stimulate  and\ncomplement the economic base of the market service area.  The selected pradeshiya sabhas will\nenter  into  participation  agreements  with  SPC  satisfactory  to  ADB  within  three  months  of  loan\neffectiveness,  setting  out  the  terms  of  their  agreement,  including  the  agreement  to  provide\ncounterpart funds. Construction will be undertaken on a contract basis under the supervision of\nthe  Department  of  Local  Government  in  cooperation  with  the  technical  staff  of  the  pradeshiya\nsabha. A draft memorandum of understanding is placed in Appendix 11.\n\n5.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n88.\nThe  Project  contains  several  innovative  components  that  require  time  to  set  up  and\norganize  before  full-scale  implementation  can  proceed.  In  addition,  several  of  the  components\nhave  a  strong  institution-building  focus  and  their  start-up  will  require  the  initial  recruitment  of\ndomestic and international consultants. With this in view, the Project will be implemented over six\nyears  with  the  first  year  primarily  focused  on  the  following  activities:  recruiting  staff  and\nconsultants; undertaking initial, benchmark, and investment surveys to delineate specific potential\nenterprises  to  be  promoted;  contracting  service  providers,  establishing  enterprise  development\nand information centers; undertaking consultation work with the pradeshiya sabhas; finalizing the\nmemorandums  of  understanding;  and  constructing  demonstration  roads.  Some  borrowing  from\nthe credit line could be expected by the beginning of the second year, but full-scale operation of\nthe credit line and advisory services, as well as preventive maintenance works under Part II are\nlikely to commence only in the second year. If the preparatory functions envisaged are completed\nahead  of  schedule,  the  delivery  of  project  inputs  could  be  accordingly  brought  forward  in\nconsultation with ADB. ADB has approved advance action for the recruitment of consultants. The\nGovernment  has  been  advised  that  such  advance  action  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  any\npart of the Project. A tentative implementation schedule is given in Appendix 12.\n\n\f6.\n\nProcurement\n\n24\n\n89.\nGoods and services financed by ADB and the OPEC Fund will be procured in accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.  In addition, the Project will implement the Government\u2019s\nRevised Guidelines on Tender Procedures for Foreign Assisted Projects,  including  compliance\nwith the delegation of administrative authority to different levels, to the extent that such guidelines\ndo  not  conflict  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement.  Under  Part  I,  the  major  items  to  be\nprocured for the enterprise development service providers will be equipment and materials, which\nwill be procured  by the PMO. For procurement of goods and services to be financed under the\ncredit  component,  NDB  will  demonstrate  to  ADB  that  the  procurement  procedures  adopted  by\nsubborrowers are appropriate in the circumstances and will ensure that the goods and services to\nbe financed by the credit component subloans are purchased at reasonable prices, account being\ntaken  of  relevant  factors  such  as  time  of  delivery,  efficiency  and  reliability  of  goods,  their\nsuitability  to  the  subproject,  and  the  availability  of  maintenance  facilities  and  spare  parts  and  in\nthe case of services, of their quality and the competence of the parties rendering them.\n\nFor Part II, the major goods and services to be procured will be equipment and materials\n90.\nas  well  as  a  modest  amount  of  civil  works.  Equipment  will  consist  of  office,  information\ntechnology,  communications,  and  training  equipment  for  the  PMO,  Department  of  Local\nGovernment, and selected enterprise development agencies. A small number of vehicles will be\nprocured  to  allow  mobility  in  the  field  for  staff,  service  contractors,  and  consultants.  As  all\ncontracts  for  goods  and  services,  except  for  vehicles,  are  expected  to  be  $100,000  or  less,\nprocurement  may  be  through  direct  purchase.  Contracts  for  goods  and  services  in  excess  of\n$100,000 will be procured through local competitive bidding.\n\n91.\nCivil  works  contracts  to  be  awarded  will  consist  of  routine  road  maintenance  works  and\nmarket  upgrading  under  Part  II.  Procurement  will  comprise  many  small  contracts  for  road\nmaintenance  and  for  the  construction  of  market  facilities.  No  single  contract  is  likely  to  exceed\n$200,000.  The  procurement  of  civil  works  for  road  maintenance  contracts  will  take  a  variety  of\nforms, and may entail a full package contract, the rental of equipment along with the use of hired\nlabor, or the use of hired labor, with the pradeshiya sabhas\u2019 own equipment. The procurement of\nsuch small-scale contracts will be in accordance with local competitive bidding using procedures\nacceptable  to  ADB,  or  on  a  case-by-case  basis  acceptable  to  ADB,  the  use  of  local  direct\npurchase or other practices that have been shown to be acceptable to ADB. Such acceptability\nmay entail open bidding and competition, or, in the event this is not realistically possible, the use\nof Southern Province Road Development Authority equipment on a contracted basis. Civil works\nfor  market  improvement  will  be  awarded  through  local  competitive  bidding  using  procedures\nacceptable to ADB.\n\n92.\nVehicles  and  equipment  will  be  procured  through  international  shopping  for  packages\ncosting more than $100,000 and less than $500,000, and by direct purchase for packages costing\n$100,000  or  less.  Service  contracts  for  enterprise  training  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  local\ncompetitive  bidding  among  prequalified  agencies  using  ADB  guidelines.  Service  contracts  for\nenterprise  development  services  will  be  through  direct  purchase,  negotiated  on  the  basis  of\npreselection  of  the  service  providers  and  with  payment  of  standard  fees.  An  indicative  list  of\nprocurement packages showing size and method of procurement is provided in Appendix 13.\n\n7.\n\nConsulting Services\n\n93.\nThe Project will require 246 person-months of consulting services consisting of 36 person-\nmonths of international and 210 person-months of domestic expert services. The consultants will\n\n\f25\n\n(i)  help  formulate  work  programs  for  the  agencies  and  intermittent  supervision  of  the  agencies\u2019\nwork; (ii) assist the pradeshiya sabhas and the PMO with the selection of markets for upgrading\nand rural infrastructure to be covered by the rural infrastructure component; (iii) help with market\ndesign  and  market  management;  (iv)  provide  training  to  the  pradeshiya  sabhas  staff  on\nsustainable  management  and  financing  of  rural  infrastructure;  (v)  design  an  overall  training\nprogram  for  staff  of  the  PMO,  pradeshiya  sabhas,  and  the  contracted  enterprise  development\nagencies  on  the  identification  and  promotion  of  economic  opportunities  in  rural  areas;  and  (vi)\nprepare environmental guidelines for project implementation and monitor compliance. A tentative\nlist  of  consulting  services  requirements  and  proposed  terms  of  reference  are  provided  in\nAppendix 14.\n\n94.\nIn  addition  to  direct  consulting  services,  the  Project  provides  that  service  contracts,\nsatisfactory  to  ADB,  will  be  entered  into  between  SPC  and  qualified  enterprise  development\nagencies for the provision of enterprise development advisory services aimed at the promotion of\ngrowth-oriented activities linked with the Project\u2019s credit line.  Procurement of services from the\nenterprise development agencies will take the form of service contracts satisfactory to ADB. The\nservices of the lead EDS technical support provider will be rendered under a technical services\ncontract,  for  the  term  of  project  implementation,  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The  selection  of  the  lead\nEDS  technical  support  provider  will  be  made  through  an  objective  and  transparent  process,\nsatisfactory  to  ADB,  based  on  an  institutional  and  technical  capability  assessment  with  special\nreference to the needs of the Project. Some of the factors to be considered will be the agency\u2019s\nmandate and background in agriculture-related enterprise promotion; national level linkages with\nrelevant private sector agribusinesses, associations, and technology and marketing experts; and\nwillingness  to  take  up  the  responsibility  envisaged  in  the  proposed  terms  of  reference  for  the\nduration of the Project. The selection process will be concluded and an agreement between MPI,\nSPC, and the selected agency, satisfactory to ADB, will be signed prior to loan effectiveness.\n\nin \n\nthree  packages:  enterprise  development,  rural  roads,  and  public \n\n95.\nAll  consulting  services,  including  those  financed  by  the  OPEC  Fund  will  be  engaged  in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements\nsatisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  Consulting  services  will  be\nrecruited \nfinance\nmanagement. Consultants, both domestic and international, for EDS support and rural roads will\nbe recruited through a firm. Other consultants, because of the nature of expertise required, will be\nrecruited as individual consultants. To expedite the appointment of consultants, the Government\nhas indicated that it  will undertake advance action to the stage of shortlisting during the  project\nprocessing period.\n\n8.\n\nTraining\n\n96.\nTraining  will  be  provided  for  (i)  staff  of  the  PFIs  on  credit  promotion  and  subproject\nappraisal, (ii) potential beneficiaries on technical and financial management, (iii) staff of the PMO\non  enterprise  development,  (iv)  staff  of  the  Department  of  Local  Government  on  rural  road\nmaintenance  techniques,  and  (v)    pradeshiya  sabhas  on  rural  infrastructure  maintenance  and\npublic finance and administration. PFI training will be undertaken at a suitable in-country training\ninstitute  and  will  consist  of  a  series  of  short  courses  throughout  the  project  period.  For  Part  I,\nproposals for training from the enterprise development advisory agencies will be assessed by the\nPMO and appropriate financing approved by the project director.  In addition, SPC will formulate a\nplan for the training institute\u2019s full utilization, including its long-term financial sustainability.\n\n97.\nThree  of  the  project\u2019s  components  will  entail  major  training  activities:  the  enterprise\ndevelopment  component  of  Part  I,  the  rural  roads  maintenance  component  of  Part  II,  and  the\n\n\f26\n\npradeshiya  sabha  financial  management  advisory  component  of  Part  II.  Under  the  enterprise\ndevelopment  component,  service  providers,  NGOs,  and  training  institutes  will  be  recruited  on  a\ncontract basis to provide training to prospective entrepreneurs interested in availing of the project\ncredit  line.  Such  training  will  entail  specialized  training  in  identified  fields  including  cultivation\ntechniques for high-value crops, such as fruits, vegetables, and spices, for livestock and poultry,\nand  for  improved  product  packaging  and  marketing.  More  generic  training  on  preparing  project\nreports  and  business  plans,  and  business  and  financial  management  will  be  provided.  Special\nmodules for women and youth to generate awareness of business opportunities and potential in\nthe project area will be formulated and provided. Training courses under this component will be\narranged and financed on the basis of perceived demand by the PMO's enterprise development\nwing.\n\n98.\nMuch  of  the  effort  expended  under  the  rural  roads  maintenance  component  will  be\ndevoted to on-the-job training of the technical staff of the pradeshiya sabhas.  This will include the\npreparation  of  the  demonstration  roads  in  each  pradeshiya  sabha under  the  guidance  of  road\nmaintenance  consultants,  and  initial  upgrading  of  roads  and  initial  maintenance  of  improved\nroads  under  the  guidance  of  the  technical  staff  of  the  Department  of  Local  Government.  The\nfinancial and management officers of the pradeshiya sabhas will receive direct on-the-job training\nin finance, budgeting, and management planning from the consultants recruited for the financial\nmanagement  advisory  component  of  Part  II.  This  will  include  training  in  assessing  expenditure\nrequirements, prioritizing expenditure requirements, assessing revenue sources, and maximizing\nsuch  sources  and  planning  activities  based  on  available  expenditures  and  prioritized\nrequirements.    General  training  in  governance  and  management  for  the  elected  officials  of  the\npradeshiya sabhas is included in the project scope.\n\n99.\nTraining will also be provided on (i) credit promotion and subproject appraisal for PFI staff;\n(ii)  enterprise  development,  business  promotion,  and  marketing  for  relevant  PMO  staff;  (iii)\ntechniques of rural road management for technical staff of the Department of Local Government;\nand  (iv)  the  latest  techniques  in  project  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation,  especially  tools  for\nimpact  assessment  for  the  project  staff  including  district  offices.  The  PMO  will  have  a  full-time\ntraining officer to coordinate and advise on training activities. In addition, support will be provided\nto  equip  the  Wackwella  Training  Institute  constructed  under  the  SPRDP,  so  that  it  can  be\neffectively used as a venue for project-sponsored training activities. SPC will (i) formulate a plan\nfor the Institute's full utilization, including its long-term financial sustainability, and (ii) monitor its\nimplementation.\n\n9.\n\nOperation and Maintenance\n\n100. As  the  Project  is  largely  credit  based  and  will,  to  a  considerable  extent,  use  existing\nfacilities  or  services,  large  incremental  O&M  costs  are  not  envisaged.  The  main  public  sector\nO&M costs will be for the operation of the PMO during project implementation, for the operation of\nany  market  facilities  upgraded  by  the  Project,  and  for  infrastructure  undergoing  transitional\nmaintenance.  These costs will be financed as follows:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nThe  O&M  costs  for  the  PMO  will  be  financed  from  project  funds  for  the  project\nduration after which the PMO will be phased out.\n\nO&M  costs  and  arrangements  for  market  facilities  will  be  covered  as  part  of  the\nmarket development plan that must be prepared by each participating pradeshiya\nsabha  prior  to  any  market  infrastructure  being  taken  up  for  financing.  The  plan\nmust include assurances that adequate revenues from the market turnover tax will\n\n\f27\n\nbe  allocated  for  market  maintenance.  Market  management  and  maintenance  will\nbe  the  responsibility  of  a  market  committee  made  up  of  representatives  of\nstallholders, clients, and the local government council.\n\n(iii)\n\nO&M for infrastructure covered by Part II will be financed from project funds on a\ndeclining  scale  during  the  four-year  period  with  the  pradeshiya  sabhas  devising\nlong-term O&M procedures and taking on an ever increasing share of the cost as\nthe project proceeds.\n\nFor O&M of facilities and activities of private sector project agencies, the operational cost\n101.\nof the enterprise development services will be built into the contracts with the service agencies,\nand the operational costs for the PFIs will be funded from their normal overhead.\n\n10. \n\nSustainability\n\n102.\nFostering sustainability of the project impact and the facilities and services provided by the\nProject is at the core of the project design.  While the EDS will initially be financed on a contract\nbasis by the Project, the ultimate goal by the end of the project period is to make such services\navailable  on  a  self-financing  sustainable  basis.  Similarly,  improvements  of  market  facilities  will\nonly be taken up if a sustainable management system is formulated. Market maintenance costs\nwill be borne by the private sector users of the market facilities.\n\n103.\nThe whole objective of the rural roads maintenance capacity strengthening is to assist the\npradeshiya sabhas to utilize their available funds more effectively and to maximize funding for the\noperation of key rural infrastructure under their jurisdiction. By the end of the project period, most\nof  the  pradeshiya  sabhas,  with  the  assistance  of  consulting  services,  are  expected  to  have\ndeveloped  long-term  O&M  procedures  and  sustainable  sources  of  funds  to  finance  the  most\ncritical roads under their jurisdiction. For the longer term, the national and provincial governments\nhave  come  to  realize  the  importance  of  increased  maintenance  allocations  for  the  pradeshiya\nsabhas.  To  this  end,  SPC  has  just  completed  an  inventory  of  all  roads  under  the  pradeshiya\nsabhas' responsibility to begin estimating and budgeting incremental maintenance requirements.   \n\n11.\n\nBeneficiary Participation\n\n104.\nThe Project is designed to be demand driven and participatory, especially Part I. It will be\nthe  role  of  the  EDS  to  identify  and  promote  key  promising  ventures,  while  at  the  same  time\nliaising with the PFIs for implementation of the credit line, and the option of owners or potential\nowners of micro and small enterprises to avail of the EDS, training, or credit line. In this context,\naccess to the credit line will be as much for existing entrepreneurs who wish to increase the size\nand  level  of  investment  in  their  enterprises  as  for  new  potential  start-ups.  Interested\nentrepreneurs will be provided with access to information on technology, markets, and financing,\nand  also to customized or group training, all at their own initiative.\n\n105. Beneficiary  participation  is  also  inherent  in  the  design  of  Part  II.  In  this  case  the  direct\nbeneficiaries  will  be  the  pradeshiya  sabhas,  which  are  the  driving  force  in  deciding  which\ninfrastructure  facilities  are  taken  up  for  upgrading  or  transitional  maintenance,  and  which  will\nreceive  capacity-building  support.  The  indirect  beneficiaries  will  be  the  local  population  who  the\npradeshiya  sabhas  represent  and  who  will  benefit  from  the  improved  market  and  transport\ninfrastructure.\n\n\f12.\n\nDisbursement Procedures\n\n28\n\n106.\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  full  budgetary  allocations  for  the  Project  are  made\nannually  by  MPI.  To  ensure  timely  release  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  counterpart  funds  and  to\nexpedite  project  implementation,  the  Government  will,  immediately  after  the  loan  becomes\neffective, establish two imprest accounts in CBSL; one for the credit component and one for all\nother components of the project. The initial amount to be deposited in each imprest account will\nnot  exceed  $1.0  million  equivalent.  Payments  will  be  made  from  and  to  these  accounts  for  all\neligible  expenditures  under  the  Project.  The  imprest  accounts  shall  be  established,  managed,\nreplenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan Disbursement Handbook.  ADB\u2019s\nstatement of expenditure procedure will be used to replenish and liquidate the imprest accounts,\nand  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures.  A  ceiling  of  $50,000  equivalent  will  be  placed  per\nindividual payment/expenditure. Disbursements to NDB and from NDB to the PFIs will be made\non  a  reimbursement  basis  in  accordance  with  the  subsidiary  loan  agreement  between  the\nGovernment and NDB and the participation agreement to be entered into by NDB and each PFI.\n\n13.\n\nAccounts, Audits, and Reports\n\n107. Each  agency  involved  in  project  implementation  will  establish  and  maintain  detailed\naccounts  and  records  of  project  progress  and  expenditures  to  facilitate  the  identification  of\nincome  and  expenditures  related  to  the  Project.  These  will  include  the  enterprise  development\nservice  agencies,  PMO,  PFIs,  and  the  participating  pradeshiya  sabhas.  The  PMO  will  be\nresponsible for consolidating all accounts except those relating to the credit line, and submitting\nreimbursement  requests  to  ADB.  Adequate  accounting  staff,  including  two  full-time  project\naccountants  within  the  PMO  will  be  dedicated  solely  to  monitoring  project  expenses,\nreimbursements,  and  accounts.  NDB  will  be  responsible  for  accounts  and  requests  for\nreimbursement relating to the credit line; it will establish a separate project cell in its head office to\nmaintain  detailed  records  on  the  use  of  loan  proceeds.  Accounts  of  NDB  and  the  PFIs  will  be\naudited annually by independent auditors. All audited accounts and financial statements together\nwith the report of the auditor will be submitted to ADB within six months of the close of the related\nfinancial  year.  Action  will  be  taken  by  ADB  under  its  administrative  instructions,  Project\nAdministration Instruction (PAI), section 7.05, in cases of any delays in the submission of audited\nproject  accounts  and  financial  statements  by  the  parties  concerned.  The  imprest  account  and\nstatement  of  expenditures  will  be  audited  as  part  of  the  regular  annual  audit  of  the  project\naccounts, and a separate opinion on their use will be required in the annual audit report.\n\n108. Each  project  agency  will  prepare  quarterly  progress  reports,  which  the  PMO  will\nconsolidate  into  project  reports.  The  reports  will  detail  the  achievements  related  to  the\nimplementation  schedule,  targets  and  plans  for  the  next  reporting  period,  problems  requiring\nresolution, and steps to be taken to resolve them. NDB will submit quarterly progress reports to\nthe PMO on the progress of its part of the Project. The report will be an aggregation of the PFIs'\nquarterly  reports,  which  will  cover  staffing,  training,  lending,  collection,  arrears  performance,\nportfolio  data,  subborrowers  and  enterprise  characteristics,  and  impact  of  subprojects.  In  its\nfinancial  statements  NDB  will  segregate  ADB  loan  proceeds  from  its  own  statements  and  from\nother ongoing projects, and present separate statements for the Project.\n\n109. Within  three  months  of  project  closing,  RDD  of  MPI  will  prepare  a  project  completion\nreport for submission to ADB. The report will detail the results and achievements of the Project\nincluding an impact assessment, provide an analysis of the funds spent, and indicate measures\nto ensure the sustainability of project investments.\n\n\f14.\n\nBenefit Monitoring\n\n29\n\n110. Benefit monitoring of the project impact will be undertaken by the monitoring unit to be set\nup in the PMO. Initial activities will include a benchmark survey to be undertaken during the first\nyear of the Project. Thereafter monitoring activities for the enterprise development services and\nthe  credit  line  will  be  undertaken  on  a  focused  basis,  concentrating  on  selected  individuals,\nincluding  women,  who  use  these  facilities.  This  will  consist  of  annual  interviews  of  randomly\nselected  clients  and  subborrowers  to  determine  the  nature  of  advice  received  from  enterprise\ndevelopment agencies and their opinion of it, the type of training received if any, and its perceived\nvalue; the type and scale of enterprise taken up for financing, the amount of the credit line drawn\ndown,  and  their  experience in dealing with the PFIs; and the results of the ensuing investment,\nand the amount and type of employment generated. The focus will move from activity monitoring\nto impact monitoring.\n\n111. Monitoring  of  Part  II  will  consist  of  inspections  of  the  roads  being  maintained  by  the\npradeshiya  sabhas,  and  annual  interviews  of  people  within  the  service  area  of  the  roads,  and\nmarket  lessees  and  users  to  determine  economic  and  social  benefits  of  infrastructure\nimprovement and maintenance.\n\n15.\n\nMidterm Review\n\n112. A comprehensive midterm review will be undertaken at the end of the third year of project\nimplementation. The purpose of the review will be to critically evaluate the project progress, the\nvalidity of the implementation procedures, the functioning and impact of the EDS, the impact of\ntraining activities, the rate of uptake of the credit line, and the impact of Part II on infrastructure\nmaintenance  by  the  pradeshiya  sabhas.    Recommendations  will  be  made,  as  required  for\nchanges  in  focus,  adjustments  to  contracts  and  implementation  arrangements,  and  selection  or\nqualification  procedures  for  access  to  the  credit  line  by  entrepreneurs  or  access  to  the\ninfrastructure component by pradeshiya sabhas.\n\nG.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironment\n\n113.  Any  potential  environmental  impacts  of  subprojects  financed  by  the  credit  line  are\nexpected  to  be  small  and  scattered,  given  the  small-scale  nature  of  the  enterprises  concerned\nand  their  likely  dispersion  throughout  the  project  area.    Localized  problems  of  liquid  and  solid\nwaste disposal, as well as noise and dust may, however, arise. To address these and any other\nproblems that may arise, the Project provides for a domestic environment consultant in the PMO,\nwho will support the contracted EDS providers to make an environmental impact assessment of\nthe  different  types  of  enterprises  identified  for  promotion  under  the  Project.  To  ensure  that\nsubproject  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  are  prepared  properly  and  that  the\nenvironmental review mechanism is adequately functioning, a sample of the first set of subproject\nIEEs will be submitted by the PMO to ADB for review. Any subprojects in which the IEE identifies\nsignificant  environmental  impacts  will  also  be  required  to  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and\nappraisal.  The  EDS  providers  and  the  PMO  will  undertake  programs  to  create  awareness  and\nunderstanding  of  general  and  specific  environmental  concerns  in  the  region.  In  addition,  the\nenvironmental  consultant  will  prepare  environmental  guidelines  for  the  PFIs  to  apply  during  the\nreview of subloan applications and for subborrowers to follow during the setup and operation of\ntheir enterprises.\n\n\f30\n\n114.  The  works  involved  in  rural  roads  will  be  simple  maintenance  works  and  no  serious\nenvironmental impacts are envisaged. Indeed by continuing to maintain rural roads in an operable\ncondition  the  component  will  have  a  positive  environmental  effect  by  preventing  sheet  erosion\nand  gullying,  and  the  consequent  siltation  of  adjacent  water  bodies.  In  the  case  of  market\nupgrading, some noise, dust, and disturbance may be experienced for a short temporary period\nwhile  the  upgrading  works  are  under  way.  Once  completed  to  an  improved  design,  the  state  of\nthe market site itself will be improved, with better drainage and traffic movement. Solid and liquid\nwaste  disposal  are  potential  problems  that  will  need  to  be  dealt  with  through  the  plans  to  be\nprepared  by  participating  pradeshiya  sabhas  and  submitted  to  SPC  as  a  requirement  in  the\napproval  process.  To  increase  the  positive  environmental  impact  of  the  Project,  rural  road\ndesigns  promoted  by  the  demonstration  roads  and  preventive  maintenance  works  under  Part  II\nwill incorporate environmentally sound practices. The environment consultant will also formulate\nappropriate guidelines for the infrastructure component. This activity will be undertaken in the first\nyear  of  the  Project,  so  that  technical  agencies  are  made  aware  of  any  special  environmental\nconsiderations in the implementation of project activities.\n\n2.\n\nSocial  Concerns\n\n115.\nThe Project aims to create or expand around 7,000 agro-based microenterprises and about\n1,500 SMEs with a corresponding increase in employment estimated for about 25,000 people. By\ngenerating  employment  and  upgrading  business  opportunities,  the  Project  will  address  the  key\nconsumption poverty issues exemplified by the lack of economic opportunities. Some of the poor\nwill  benefit  directly  by  becoming  microentrepreneurs.  The  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  will  range\nfrom  the  economically  disadvantaged  poor  to  higher  income  groups  in  Southern  Province.  The\nincrease  in  the  number  of  entrepreneurs  will  also  generally  improve  the  terms  of  trade  for  poor\nagricultural producers.\n\n116. A  number  of  activities  will  be  undertaken  to  enhance  benefits  to  vulnerable  groups,\nparticularly  unemployed  youth  and  women.  Special  consideration  will  be  given  for  the  full\nparticipation  of  female  entrepreneurs,  and  women  will  be  specially  targeted  to  participate  as\nequals in the business arena. Youth are somewhat reluctant to engage in business, and efforts by\ngrassroots  NGOs  have  only  been  partly  successful.  A  provincewide  promotional  campaign  is\ntherefore  planned  to  introduce  youth  to  enterprise  opportunities  and  to  business  as  a  career\nthrough  NGOs,  chambers  of  commerce,  and  the  EDS  providers.  Women\u2019s  participation  in\nmicrocredit  and  microenterprise  programs,  on  the  other  hand,  has  been  very  high,  but  women\nneed  higher  levels  of  credit,  business  counseling,  and  other  support  services  to  move  up  from\nmicro  to  small  and  from  small  to  medium-sized  enterprises.  In  addition,  gender  awareness\nprograms for bankers, service providers, and clients will help overcome some of the sociocultural\nconstraints  that  are  hampering  women  entrepreneurs  and  enable  them  to  make  better  use  of\nopportunities provided by the Project.\n\n117. Because ADB funds are for a long term, the PFIs will also be strengthened financially by\nreducing their duration- and interest-variation risks and improving fund management. By using the\nnetwork of financial institutions and NGOs, the Project will be able to provide access to financial\nservices  to  existing  and  potential  small  enterprises  and  microenterprises.  In  the  process,  the\ncapacity of NGO-PFIs to carry out sustainable and cost-effective lending to microenterprises will\nbe enhanced and permanent access provided to the poor in rural areas.\n\n\f31\n\nV. \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA.\n\nEconomic and Financial Analyses\n\n118. Economic  and  financial  analyses  have  been  undertaken  for  two  components:  (i)  the\nimprovement  of  road  maintenance,  and  (ii)  the  upgrading  of  market  infrastructure.  In  addition,\nanalysis  has  been  made  of  indicative  agriculture-based  enterprises  representing  the  types  of\ninvestments that entrepreneurs may undertake with credit and advisory services provided by the\nProject.  Plans are to improve 1,049 km (roughly 29 km per pradeshiya sabha) of economically\nimportant  gravel  roads  into  a  condition  in  which  they  are  maintainable  by  local  government\nauthorities. A total of 20 markets will also be upgraded, both to improve the level of services to\ntraders  and  consumers  and  to  enhance  the  revenue  that  pradeshiya  sabhas  glean  from  such\nmarkets. The indicative enterprises include floriculture for export, fruit, a poultry hatchery, broiler\nproduction,  ornamental  fish,  fish  culture,  a  rice  mill,  and  a  shoe  manufacture.    During  the  six\nyears of project implementation, approximately 8,000\u201310,000 of such enterprises are expected to\nemerge, encouraged by project assistance including financing, marketing services, TA, and other\nbusiness  management  services.    Detailed  results  of  the  economic  and  financial  analyses  are\nsummarized in Appendix 15.\n\n1. \n\nEconomic Justification\n\n119.\nThe  economic  analysis  adopted  a  world  price  numeraire  and  used  values  expressed  in\nconstant  2001  prices.    Economic  costs  were  derived  from  financial  cost  data,  and  nontraded\ngoods and services were converted to economic values using a standard conversion factor of 0.9\nand a shadow wage rate of 0.75.  Enhanced benefits of induced demand that might be expected\nfrom the completion of the ADB-financed Southern Transport Corridor Project and the Southern\nRoad Improvement Project have been excluded from project benefits.\n\n120. Quantifiable  benefits  of  gravel  rural  roads  include  the  value  of  time  savings  to  travelers,\ndecreased  vehicle  operating  costs,  and  a  decrease  in  the  amount  of  spoilage  of  agricultural\nproduce transported on the roads.  The economic internal rate of return of the roads is 23 percent\nand  the  economic  net  present  value  is  SLRs470  million.    Sensitivity  analyses  for  decreases  in\nbenefits and increase in costs indicates that these results are quite robust.  Care must, of course,\nbe paid to the level of maintenance actually done, as inadequate maintenance could eventually\ndecrease  road  services  to  their  without-project  level.  The  Project  will  provide  substantial  TA  to\nensure that road improvements result in maintainable roads and to help local authorities develop\nfinancial systems that will enable them to fulfill all of their maintenance responsibilities.\n\n121. Rural  markets  comprise  the  most  important  marketing  channel  for  farm  produce  in  the\nproject  area.    Facilities,  however,  are  inadequate.    Benefits  of  market  upgrading  will  include  a\nreduction  in  the  amount  of  spoilage  of  agricultural  produce  that  is  traded,  plus  a  portion  of  the\nincreased  business  that  could  be  expected  from  better  facilities.  The  economic  internal  rate  of\nreturn for this component is 26 percent and the economic net present value is SLRs142 million.\nThese figures are also quite robust.\n\n122.\nThe  Project  will  provide  enterprise  development  services  and  access  to  credit  to\nentrepreneurs  in  the  project  area.    While  the  actual  agriculture-based  investments  by  such\nentrepreneurs  will  be  determined  during  project  implementation,  a  number  of  indicative\nenterprises  have  been  examined.    Rates  of  return  for  these  enterprises  indicate  that  all  are\neconomically viable, indicating their potential for economic benefits to the local economy.\n\n\f2. \n\nFinancial Justification\n\n32\n\nfor  a  number  of  services, \n\n123. Pradeshiya  sabhas  have  responsibility \nthe\nmaintenance of rural roads. These local government entities, however, do have limited revenue\nsources.  Rent from markets represent one of the sources of revenue over which local authorities\nhave  control.    One  of  the  goals  of  the  market  improvement  component  is  to  increase  the\npradeshiya sabhas\u2019 income from this source. The enhanced facilities of such markets will be likely\nto generate greater produce sales and provide increased rents and fees than would unimproved\nmarkets.  For  a  large  market  that  was  examined,  incremental  income  (net  of  O&M  costs)  is\nestimated at SLRs1.3 million annually. For a smaller market, this revenue increment is estimated\nat  SLRs300,000.    In  addition,  the  Project  will  also  provide  public  finance  management  training\nand  services  to  the  pradeshiya  sabhas  to  help  them  develop  additional  ways  in  which  to  raise\nrevenues and manage their budgets.\n\nincluding \n\n124.\nFinancial  analysis  were  also  undertaken  for  10  indicative  enterprises.    These  analyses\nassumed an enterprise life of 15 years in most instances, according to the nature of investment.\nNo salvage values were assumed to exist at the end of this enterprise life. Financial internal rates\nof return for the sample enterprises ranged between 30 percent for leather shoe production to 66\npercent  for  pineapples.  These  results  demonstrate  the  profitability  of  such  potential  enterprises\nand  their  attractiveness  to  local  entrepreneurs  given  that  the  returns  are  well  above  18\u201320\npercent average cost of capital in Sri Lanka.\n\nTable 3:  Economic Analysis and Sensitivity Analysis\n\n                                     Road and Market Components\n\nIndicative Enterprises\n\nMaintenance\nImprovement\nfor Road\n\nMarket\nInfrastructure\nImprovement\n\nLeather Shoe\nProduction\n\nPineapple Processing\n\nItem\n\nSwitching\n\nSwitching\n\nSwitching\n\nSwitching\n\nEIRR\n(%)\n\nEIRR\n(%)\n\nEIRR\n(%)\n\n80\n\n68\n\n67\n\nEIRR\n(%)\n\n53\n\n45\n\n45\n\n75\n\n45\n\n94\n\n48\n\n110\n\n52\n\n70\n\n23\n\n21\n\nBase\nCase\n10%\nCost\nOverrun\n10%\nDecline in\nBenefits\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return\nSource: Mission estimates.\n\n20\n\n40\n\n26\n\n24\n\n23\n\nB.\n\nEnvironment\n\n125. No  significant  negative  environmental  impact  is  expected  from  the  Project.  Some  minor\nand  scattered  environmental  disturbance  may  potentially  occur  as  a  result  of  some  of  the\nsubprojects taken up for  financing  by the credit line in Part I (para.113). These will be avoided,\nminimized,  or  mitigated  by  adhering  to  the  guidelines  to  be  developed  by  project-financed\nconsultants, and which are consistent with environmental guidelines of ADB and the Government.\n\n\f33\n\n126.  With regard  to Part II, the works involved for the rural roads will be simple maintenance\nworks  and  no  serious  environmental  impacts  are  likely.  In  the  case  of  market  upgrading,  some\nnoise, dust, and disturbance may be experienced for a temporary period while upgrading works\nare under way, but once completed, the market site itself will be improved, with better drainage\nand traffic movement.\n\nC.\n\nSocial Dimensions and Impact on Poverty\n\n127.\nThe  Project  will  address  the  key  poverty  issue  of  lack  of  employment  opportunities  for\nvulnerable  groups,  most  of  who  are  currently  engaged  in  agriculture  and  related  activities.  The\nProject  will  also  generate  new  economic  opportunities  for  marginalized  groups,  such  as\ncommunities engaged in fishing, coconut workers, urban slum dwellers, etc. Part I of the Project will\nsupport  micro  and  small  enterprises,  and  enable  expansion  of  term  credit  facilities  to  those  who\ncurrently  have  limited  access  to  it.  As  microenterprises  are  dominated  by  the  economically\nweaker sections of society, especially women, it will improve women\u2019s livelihood and directly and\nindirectly  benefit  the  poor.40  In  addition,  the  EDS  will  help  upgrade  technology  and  market\nlinkages,  and  generate  employment  for  about  25,000  persons.41  The  enterprise  development\nassistance  and  awareness  building  efforts  of  the  Project  for  youth  will  contribute  to  making  the\nnecessary transitional process easier for both youth and local business communities to utilize the\nemerging opportunities. Because ADB funds are for a long term, the PFIs will also be strengthened\nfinancially by reducing their duration- and interest-variation risks and improving fund management.\nIn  the  process,  the  capacity  of  NGO-PFIs  to  carry  out  sustainable  and  cost-effective  lending  to\nmicroenterprises will be enhanced and permanent access provided to the poor in rural areas.\n\nThe  social  impact  of  Part  II  will  be  positive  as  it  will  facilitate  an  interface  between\n128.\nproducers and markets. By keeping rural roads in an operable condition the component will help\nprovide the infrastructure needed for the rural population to access health and sanitation benefits,\neducation, as well as product marketing facilities. Moreover, improved markets will allow the local\npopulation  access  to  an  increased  range  of  productive  activities  as  well  as  to  better  quality\nproduce at lower prices.\n\n129. Not  undertaking  the  component,  on  the  other  hand,  could  lead  to  serious  social\ndeprivation as the existing access to services and economic opportunities will be lost.  A further\npositive  social  aspect  of  the  component  is  that  it  will  generate  employment  through  road\nmaintenance activities and lead to a higher level of skills among the rural population.  An offshoot\nof  the  component  may  be  better  cooperation  among  rural  residents  as  they  form  beneficiary\ngroups to help share the burden of the pradeshiya sabhas for road maintenance.  Some voluntary\nrural  road  maintenance  activities  have  already  taken  place  within  Southern  Province  and  this\ncomponent will help them to continue more effectively and efficiently.\n\nD.\n\nRisks\n\n130.\nTo minimize the risks involved in implementation, the project design has been built firmly\non the ongoing reforms and the new rural economic advancement policy of the Government. This\ninvolves  a  focus  on  farm-  and  nonfarm-related  enterprise  development,  increased  partnership\n\n                  \n\n40  Microenterprises,  which  generally  use  family  labor  alone,  are  poor  and  include  small-scale  traders,  cottage\nindustry  operators,  weavers,  and  small  service  providers.  The  stratified  sample  survey  undertaken  by  the  TA\nindicated that females owned only 8 percent of surveyed enterprises and most were microenterprises.\n\n41  This was calculated based on data of Small and Medium Enterprise Assistance Project (5,800 SME borrowers with\nan average borrowing of $24,000 created 42,800 new jobs) and results of the stratified sample survey undertaken.\nFor  microenterprises,  two  additional  full-time  jobs  are  assumed  and  for  small  enterprises,  six  jobs  are  assumed,\nwhich adds up to: 14,000 + 9,000 = 23,000.\n\n\f34\n\nwith  the  private  sector  and  NGOs  for  this  process,  and  decentralized  implementation.\nNevertheless, some risks could affect overall project success.\n\n131.\nFirst,  the  REAP  approach  envisages  a  private  sector-led  and  decentralized  mode  of\noperation under which a new structure of roles and responsibilities has to necessarily evolve for\nMPI  and  SPC.  This  would  imply  new  capacity  to  discharge  new  responsibilities  and  attitudinal\nshifts  from  what  has  thus  far  characterized  the  two  agencies.  The  Project  provides  adequate\nsupport  to  enable  the  participating  public  sector  agencies  to  make  this  transition,  but  any\nobstructions  encountered  in  this  process  can  affect  the  project  success.  Therefore,  a  start-up\nperiod of one year is built into project implementation and close monitoring of project is planned\nduring the first year.\n\n132.  Second,  the  Project  will  entail  an  innovative  partnership  between  SPC,  and  private-  and\nNGO-operated  EDS.  Initiating  and  operating  this  partnership  will  have  risks.  As  a  first  step,  the\ndialogue process with MPI, SPC, and potential private sector partners was initiated during project\nprocessing  and  joint  workshops  organized.  To  minimize  risks  and  ensure  clear  delineation  of\noperational  modalities,  the  lead  EDS  agency  is  housed  in  the  PMO  and  will  function  as  the\ntechnical support unit of the public sector.\n\n133.\nThird,  local  entrepreneurs  are  unable  to  identify  adequate  profitable  opportunities  for\ninvestment  in  the  region.  The  project  design  therefore  includes  initial  investment  surveys,\nidentification  of  investment  opportunities,  and  canvassing  of  potential  entrepreneurs  during  the\nfirst  year.  The  investigation  of  possible  private  sector  partners  in  the  Project  has  focused  on\nagencies  that  have  developed  sufficient  links  with  industry  and  market  to  make  the  necessary\nlinkages with the new enterprises.\n\n134.  Fourth,  the  Project  is  designed  against  the  backdrop  of  several  new  developments  that\nwill  enhance  the  potential  for  economic  growth  in  Southern  Province.  These  include  projects\nfinanced by ADB, such as the Southern Transport Development Project, and other development\npartners.  If  completion  of  any  of  these  projects  or  accrual  of  benefits  is  delayed,  the  overall\npotential  benefit  generated  by  the  proposed  Project  will  be  reduced.  But,  this  eventuality  has\nbeen considered and due care taken in testing the economic viability of the Project (only benefits\ndirectly  generated  by  project  activities  have  been  calculated  and  those  emanating  from  other\nprojects have been ignored). The projected growth in vehicular traffic, for example, does not take\ninto  account  increased  traffic  generated  by  the  completion  of  the  Southern  Provincial  Roads\nImprovement  Project  and  the  Southern  Transport  Development  Project.  With  the  successful\ncompletion  of  these  other  projects,  the  overall  impact  of  the  Project  can  be  expected  to  be\nsubstantially greater than shown by the economic analysis.\n\n135.\nFinally,  risk  is  associated  with  lack  of  O&M  of  rural  infrastructure,  particularly  roads.\nBenefits from this component are dependent upon the upgrading being done properly, especially\nfor  adequate  compaction  and  drainage;  and  upon  local  governments  implementing  adequate\nO&M  regime  on  these  roads.  To  decrease  this  risk,  the  Project  (i)  has  set  up  road  selection\ncriteria,  (ii)  requires  that  local  governments  sign  a  memorandum  of  understanding  with  the\nprovincial council to implement adequate maintenance on chosen roads, and (iii) provides TA to\nensure  quality  road  improvement  and  maintenance  regimes,  and  guide  pradeshiya  sabhas  in\nrevenue generation and budgetary management.\n\n\f35\n\nVI.\n\nASSURANCES\n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances\n\n136.

There  are  9  domestic\ncommercial  banks,  1  savings  bank,  5  development  banks,  6  regional  development  banks,  10\nmerchant  banks,  25  finance  companies,  7  venture  capital  companies,  1,418  cooperative  rural\nbanks, 14 district cooperative rural bank unions, and 8,424 primary thrift and credit cooperative\nsocieties.  The  Employees\u2019  Provident  Fund,  the  Employees\u2019  Trust  Fund,  and  about  204\napproved  private  provident  funds,  4  investment  management  companies,  8  insurance\ncompanies,  15  stock  brokerage  companies,  and  7  venture  capital  companies  complete  the\nlandscape  for  the  financial  sector.  As  of  the  end  of  1999,  commercial  banks\u2019  assets  totaled\nSLRs571  billion,  while  National  Savings  Bank,  Employees\u2019  Provident  Fund,  Employees\u2019  Trust\nFund, and insurance companies\u2019 assets totaled SLRs100 billion, SLRs210 billion, and SLRs27\nbillion, respectively. The market capitalization of the stock market was SLRs113 billion.\n\n2.\nThe  commercial  and  licensed  specialized  banks  have  1,324  branches  in  the  country.\nApart  from  foreign  banks,  all  other  types  of  institutions  are  represented  in  Southern  Province\nwith 110 commercial and development banks branches, 34 cooperative rural banks, 1,255 thrift\nand  credit  cooperative  societies,  and  more  than  900  village  banks  served  by  a  range  of\nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).  Many  potential  rural  clients  are  not  able  to  access\nappropriate financial services, particularly term credit. Although access appears to be somewhat\ngood  for  small  borrowers  from  very  poor  households  who  borrow  less  than  SLRs20,000\nbecause of NGO/cooperative and Government intervention programs focused on this segment,\nthe amount borrowed is insufficient to impact their living standards.\n\n3.\nVarious measures were implemented during the 1990s to reform the financial markets.\nThese  included  the  adoption  of  international  accounting  standards  in  the  banking  system  and\ncapital markets; recapitalization of state banks; and improvement of regulation, supervision, and\ninfrastructure of the stock market. The ongoing financial sector reform program has created the\nconditions for the gradual emergence of a more market-oriented financial system. Interest rates,\nwith \nthe  exception  of  Government-sponsored  programs,  are  market  determined;  and\npolicymakers  appear  to  be  more  receptive  to  the  introduction  of  a  market-driven  financial\nsystem. Brief profiles of selected institutions and arrangements relevant to the Project follow.\n\nA.\n\nState-Owned Commercial Banks\n\nBank of Ceylon (BOC) and People\u2019s Bank (PB) broadly constitute half of the commercial\n4.\nbanking  system.  BOC  with  37  branches  and  PB  with  38  branches  are  active  in  Southern\nProvince.  Whereas  BOC  continues  to  show  improvement  in  its  financial  structure  and\nperformance,  PB  has  yet  to  demonstrate  acceptable  performance  standards.  BOC  is  in  the\nprocess  of  restructuring  and  reorganizing  to  develop  sustainable  capacity  in  domestic  and\nglobal banking. BOC assets in 1999 totaled SLRs179 billion and BOC posted a profit of SLRs2\nbillion.1  Loan  repayments  are  stated  to  be  86  percent.  Total  nonperforming  loans  (NPL)  are\nabout 17 percent. The annual return on total assets averaged 1.55 percent over the last three\nyears while return on shareholders funds averaged 23 percent.\n\n1   Provisional data in this appendix will be replaced with audited figures as soon as they are available.\n\n                  \n\n\f42\n\nAppendix 2, page 2\n\nB.\n\nPrivate Commercial Banks\n\n5.\nThe private commercial banks with branches in Southern Province are Hatton National\nBank  (8  branches),  Sampath  Bank  (4  branches),  Seylan  Bank  (9  branches),  and  Commercial\nBank  of  Ceylon  Limited  (3  branches).  These  banks  are  conscious  of  the  need  to  satisfy\nshareholders as well as customers, so are oriented toward the provision of high-quality services,\nand  the  expansion  of  attractive  services.  While  some  commercial  banks  cross-hold  shares,\ncompetition in the financial services market is substantial.\n\n6.\nHatton  National  Bank  is  the  largest  private  sector  bank  with  an  asset  base  of  SLRs88\nbillion in 2000. Profit after tax in 2000 was SLRs800 million. Return on total assets for the year\nwas 2.1 percent and 10.7 percent on equity. Seylan Bank with an asset base of SLRs56 billion\nin 2000 is the second largest private sector bank. Return on total assets, however, was lower at\n0.48 percent and return on equity stood at 13 percent. It made a profit of SLRs246 million during\n2000.  Commercial  Bank  of  Ceylon  Limited  has  an  asset  base  of  SLRs42  billion  and  made  a\nprofit of SLRs658 million in 2000 with a return on asset at 1.7 percent and a 16.2 percent return\non equity. Total assets of Sampath Bank stood at SLRs27 billion and its corresponding return\non  assets  and  equity  were  1.2  percent  and  13.9  percent,  respectively.  All  four  banks  have\ncollection ratios above 80 percent based on 2000 data.\n\nC.\n\nLicensed Specialized Banks\n\n7.\nDevelopment Finance Corporation of Ceylon (DFCC)  and National Development Bank\nof  Sri  Lanka  (NDB)  have  played  a  major  role  in  providing  long-term  finance  to  private\nenterprises,  especially  small-  and  medium-sized  enterprises.  DFCC  reported  total  assets  of\nSLRs24 billion, while NDB had total assets of SLRs38 billion in 2000. Both banks are profitable,\nwith a return on assets in the range of 1.4\u20132.10 percent, and return on equity above 10 percent\nduring  2000.  They  have  diversified  into  other  activities  including  fund  management,  venture\ncapital,  securities,  and  investment  banking  activities.  They  finance  their  operations  by  issuing\nbonds  and  borrowing  from  other  domestic  and  international  financial  institutions.  About  32\npercent  of  DFCC  direct  loans  and  43  percent  of  NDB  direct  loans  were  financed  by\nmultilateral/bilateral financial institutions. Loan collection levels are above 80 percent.\n\n8.\nRuhuna  Development  Bank  (RDB)  was  created  by  merging  three  regional  rural\ndevelopment banks in Galle, Hambantota, and Matara. RDB\u2019s head office is in Matara and 33\nbranches in: Galle (12), Hambantota (8), and Matara (13). RDB has 416 staff. Central Bank of\nSri Lanka (CBSL) is the major shareholder with a 68 percent stake. As a specialized licensed\nbank,  RDB  cannot  provide  demand  deposit  and  checking  accounts.  As  of  31  August  2000,\nloans outstanding amounted to SLRs1,345 million and deposits were SLRs954 million. At start-\nup,  RDB  inherited  a  substantial  amount  of  classified  loans  resulting  mostly  from  Government-\nand  project-sponsored  credit  programs.  RDB  management  with  support  of  CBSL  is  actively\nengaged in reducing the nonperforming loans.\n\n9.\nSANASA  Development  Bank  (SDB)  was  established  in  1997  with  an  issued  capital  of\nSLRs121 million. SDB\u2019s role is \u201cto mobilize deposits at competitive rates of interest and invest\nsuch deposits in community-based lending programs with particular focus on Sanasa societies,\ntheir members, and microenterprises.\u201d While SDB mainly lends to district unions and directly to\nprimary  societies  (acting  as  an  apex  institution),  it  also  lends  to  NGOs,  community-based\norganizations,  self-help  groups,  and  individuals  who  are  not  society  members.  Total  assets  at\nthe end of 1999 stood at SLRs1,047 million. SDB posted a loss of SLRs485 million in 1999. The\nnegative  bottom  line  is  largely  a  result  of  high  operational  expenditure  and  provisioning\n\n\f43\n\nAppendix 2, page 3\n\nrequirements. Net interest remained positive in the last two years of operations. SDB\u2019s financial\nresults  and  performance  are  expected  to  sufficiently  improve  to  provide  eligibility  as  a\nparticipating  financial  institution.  However,  eligible  Sanasa  societies  could  participate  in  the\nproject to provide financial services to microenterprises.\n\nD.\n\nNonbank Financial Institutions\n\n10.\nAt  the  end  of  1999,  14  district  cooperative  rural  bank  unions  (DCRBUs),  including  3  in\nSouthern  Province,  serviced  242  multipurpose  credit  societies  under  apex  arrangements\nwhereby  the  DCRBUs  are  owned  by  the  cooperative  societies  and  are  supervised  by  the\nDepartment  of  Cooperatives.  DCRBUs  will  have  to  strengthen  their  equity  base,  and  improve\ntheir  management  and  governance  to  qualify  as  participating  financial  institutions.  Within  the\nmultipurpose  credit  societies  in  Southern  Province  at  end  of  1999,  34  cooperative  rural  banks\nhad 486,000 members.\n\n11.\nThe size of venture capital companies in Sri Lanka is still small, with combined assets of\nonly  SLRs2.9  billion.  Seven  venture  capital  companies  invested  in  232  projects  in  1999,  with\nabout two thirds of the funds for start-up operations. Equity and venture capital services find it\ndifficult  to  cash  out  (exit)  investments  and  their  financial  performance  is  inadequate  to  offset\nfailures  against  investment  success  of  the  enterprises.  Ruhuna  Venture  Capital  Company  in\nSouthern Province has discontinued its equity financing services.\n\nE.\n\nNongovernment Organizations\n\nThe  Janashakhti  program  run  by  the  Women's  Development  Federation  uses  a\n12.\nmultidimensional  approach  to  poverty  reduction  aimed  at  women.  There  are  67  Janashakthi\nbank societies with 27,903 members in more than 5,300 groups of five women. The aggregate\nloan  outstanding  and  deposits  at  March  2000  was  SLRs61  million  and  SLRs44  million,\nrespectively.  Nearly  one  third  of  the  loans  are  for  microenterprises  with  a  24  percent  interest\nrate. Loan repayment rate is 95 percent.\n\n13.\nSarvodaya  Economic  Enterprise  Development  Services  Ltd.  (SEEDS),  operates  in  18\ndistricts  and  services  2,398  autonomous  village  societies  that  have  193,250  group  members.\nSEEDS provides systems and training to the societies and has a program that raises societies\nto the status of village banks of which there are now 365. Services, targeting the poor, comprise\nbusiness  training,  consulting,  and  agricultural  extension.  As  at  March  2000,  loans  outstanding\nwere  SLRs493  million  to  190,000  borrowers  and  SLRs469  million  in  savings  in  574,300\naccounts.  The  lending  rate  is  around  24  percent.  SEEDS  can  lend  up  to  SLRs500,000  for\nmicroenterprises.  The  loan  recovery  rate  is  94  percent.  Women  comprise  60  percent  of  total\nborrowers.\n\nF.\n\nColombo Stock Exchange\n\n14.\nDespite  the  capitalization  of  the  Colombo  Stock  Exchange  growing  about  three  times\nfrom 1990 to 1999 to about SLRs113 billion and the number of listed companies increasing to\n237,  the  market  is  quite  shallow,  accounting  for  only  10  percent  of  gross  domestic  product  in\n1999.  Turnover  was  SLRs14.8  billion  in  1999,  accounting  for  only  13  percent  of  market\ncapitalization. The corporate debt market is constrained because of the high interest rate being\noffered on Government debt, few investors, and insignificant volume of trading in the secondary\nmarket. Where trading occurs it is at heavily discounted prices. Other than this, the regulatory\nframework, institutional structures and fiscal incentives are in place.\n\n\f44\n\nAppendix 3\n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE SECTOR\n\n    Grant\n\n             Loan\n\nDatea\n\nAmount\n(million)\n\n         $20.0\n         $36.0\n\n    SDR21.4\n          $80.0\n          $55.0\n\n          $11.7\n          $8.53\n          $8.85\n       SDR9.9\n       SDR7.5\n   SDR12.95\n\nFunding Body\n\n                              Project Title\n\nADB\nADB\n\nWorld Bank\nWorld Bank\nWorld Bank\n\nNorth Central Province Rural Development Project\nSouthern Province Rural Development Project\n\nThird Rural Development Project\nSecond Rural Development Project\nKurunegala District Integrated Rural Development Project\n\nIFAD\nIFAD\nIFAD\nIFAD\nIFAD\nIFAD\n\nUNDP\nUNDP\n\nUNICEF\n\nWFP\n\nEEC\n\nFinland\n\nGermany\nGermany\nGermany\nGermany\nGermany\nGermany\n\nJapan\nJapan\n\nNorway\nNorway\nNorway\nNorway\n\nSweden\nSweden\nSweden\nSweden\n\nMatale Regional Economic Advancement Project\nNorth Central Province Participatory Rural Development Project\nNorthwestern Province Dry Zone Participatory Development  Project\nSecond Badulla District Integrated Rural Development Project\nKegalle District Integrated Rural Development Project\nBadulla District Integrated Rural Development Project\n\nArea Based Growth With Equity Programme\nSecond Badulla District Integrated Rural Development Project\n\nPuttalam District Integrated Rural Development Project\n\nParticipatory Rural Development Project (North Central Province)\n\n       $1.92\n\nMoneregala District Integrated Rural Development Project\n\nKalutara District Integrated Rural Development Project\n\nEnterprise Information Project\nIntegrated Food Security Project\nRural Banking Innovations Project\nCompetency Economies through Formation of Entrepreneurs\nKurunegala Northwestern Province Dry Zone Development Project\nKandy District Integrated Rural Development Project\n\nAgriculture Extension and Improvement Project\nGampaha District Integrated Rural Development Project\n\n       $4.9\n       $1.4\n\n       $2.29\n\n ECU5.76\n\n Fmk33.0\n\n     DM3.0\n   DM10.0\n     DM4.5\n     DM3.0\n        $3.3\nDM13.96\n\n    Y1,533\n    Y1,726\n\n      F26.5\n      F35.0\n\n  NKr60.0\n  NKr10.0\nNKr170.0\n  NKr200.0\n\n        $3.3\n    SKr3.0\nSKr156.6\n        $1.4\n\nNetherlands\nNetherlands\n\nRatnapura District Integrated Rural Development Project\nNuwara Eliya District Integrated Rural Development Project\n\nDevelopment and Rehabilitation for Batticola District\nHuman Resources and Institutional Development Project\nMonaragala District Integrated Rural Development Project\nHambantota District Integrated Rural Development Project\n\nNorth Central Province Participatory Rural Development\nHuman Resources and Institutional Development Project\nMatara District Integrated Rural Development Project\nBadulla District Integrated Rural Development Project\n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  EEC  =  European  Economic  Council,  IFAD  =  International  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development,\nUNDP  =  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  UNICEF  =  United  Nations  Children  Emergency  Fund,  WFP  =  World  Food\nProgramme\naDate of Agreement\n\nSource:  Ministry of Plan Implementation.\n\n1996\n1991\n\n1984\n1981\n1979\n\n2000\n1995\n1993\n1991\n1986\n1982\n\n1997\n1991\n\n1992\n\n1995\n\n1994\n\n1987\n\n1998\n1998\n1996\n1995\n1993\n1987\n\n1994\n1988\n\n1984\n1980\n\n1997\n1995\n1984\n1979\n\n1995\n1992\n1979\n1982\n\n\f45\n\nAppendix 4, page 1\n\nSELECTION AND DESIGN CRITERIA FOR RURAL ROAD MAINTENANCE\n\nA.\n\nSelection Criteria\n\n1.\nEach pradeshiya sabha will be given the option to select 30 kilometers (km) of rural road\nfor intensive maintenance works. The first step of such works will entail preventive maintenance\nto  bring  the  roads  into  a  condition  in  which  they  can  be  maintained  with  minimum  cost  over\nsubsequent years. The cost of preventive maintenance works is costed at about SLRs750,000\nper  km.  Subsequent  maintenance  activities  will  cost  about  SLRs75,000  per  km  per  annum.\nSelection criteria for roads to be included in this scheme will include the following:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)  \n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\nRoads will connect with major provincial (class C and D) or national (class A and\nB) roads.\n\nRoads  will  be  gravel  surfaced  since  the  preventive  maintenance  cost  and\nrecurrent maintenance cost of tarred roads would be prohibitively expensive.\n\nRoads taken up for maintenance will serve an identified economic purpose such\nas access to a particular market, access to an agriculturally productive area (e.g.,\ntea gardens or a fishing beach), or access to processing facilities.\n\nRoads  will  be  given  priority  if  they  provide  the  only  means  of  vehicle  access  to\nisolated areas with poor levels of income.\n\nRoads  should  be  in  a  reasonable  operable  condition  to  start  with  (i.e.,  they\nshould not require major and costly rehabilitation works). To this effect, estimated\npreventive  maintenance  costs  should  not  exceed  SLRs100,000  per  km  on\naverage for a particular pradeshiya sabha.\n\n(vi)   All river and channel crossings on proposed roads should have operable bridges.\n\nB.\n\n  Design Criteria\n\n2.\nWith  proper  maintenance,  an  unpaved  road  can  provide  a  good  level  of  service  for\ntraffic.    The  purpose  of  maintenance  is  to  provide  smooth  passage  for  vehicles  by  repairing\ndamage caused by a combination of weather and traffic.  The first objective of maintenance is to\nkeep the road in such a condition that it sheds water quickly.  If a road does not shed water, the\nsurface becomes soft and ruts, potholes will quickly appear.  Under such conditions earth roads\nsoon become impassable.\n\n3.\nMaintenance  to  restore  a  good  camber  to  the  road  to  enable  rapid  drainage  is  best\nachieved by regular grading or patching to fill potholes, maintain the shape of the surface, repair\nerosion  gullies,  and  restore  displaced  gravel  from  the  shoulders  to  the  main  road  platform.\nPatching is the optimum method for general repairs when machinery is not readily available and\nrequires properly trained workers.\n\n4.\nTo  minimize  maintenance  activities  and  hence  maintenance  cost  a  well-designed\nunpaved  road  is  necessary  in  the  first  place.  This  entails  a  road  with  adequately  compacted\nfoundation,  subbase,  and  surface  layers;  a  properly  shaped  surface;  properly  sorted  surface\nmaterial; and adequate lateral drainage.\n\n\f46\n\nAppendix 4, page 2\n\nThe Department of Local Government has prepared a standard design to which unpaved\n5.\nroads taken up by the Project will be upgraded to ensure optimum maintenance. It involves a 6-\nmeter wide road with a 4-meter platform with a 4 percent crossfall and  a 1:1.5 sideslope. Side\ndrains are designed at 0.6 meters on either side.  The surface dressing will be 300 millimeters of\ngravel. Of an average of four to six culverts per km, approximately two will need replacement as\npart of the upgrading.  Two designs are envisaged, a box culvert and a pipe culvert, depending\non the estimated size of the cross flow to be accommodated.  A standard design cross section\nis shown in Figure A4.1.\n\nFigure A4.1: Standard Design Cross Section For Upgraded Rural Roads\n\n              Shoulder                                                                                  Crossfall 4 percent\n\n    (1.3 m)\n\nSurface layer (300mm)\n\nRoad platform\n(4.0 meters)\n\nSubbase first layer\n\nSide drain (0.6 m)\n\nFoundation or existing ground level\n\n\f47\n\nAppendix 5, page 1\n\nDRAFT MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEEN THE SOUTHERN\nPROVINCIAL COUNCIL AND A PRADESHIYA SABHA FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE\nROAD MAINTENANCE IMPROVEMENT COMPONENT\n\nMEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE SOUTHERN PROVINCIAL\nCOUNCIL AND _____PRADESHIYA SABHA FOR THE IMPROVED MAINTENANCE\nOF UP TO 30 KM OF RURAL ROAD\n\nThis  Memorandum  of  Understanding  is  made  and  entered  into  on  this  ____  day  of\n___Year  Two  Thousand  and  ____  in  ___  between/or  with  their  successors  (name on\nbehalf of the Southern Provincial Council)  as  (designation and office address)  with\n(name on behalf of the Pradeshiya Sabha, designation, office address).\n\nWhereas  the  Southern  Provincial  Council  is  the  implementing  agency  for  a  project\nfinanced  with  assistance  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  and  whereas  ____\nPradeshiya Sabha wishes to participate in this project, the Southern Provincial Council\nagrees  to  include    ___Pradeshiya  Sabha  in  the  rural  road  maintenance  improvement\ncomponent of the project for up to 30 km of road provided the following:\n\na)\n\nb) \n\nc)\n\nd)\n\nAn inventory of rural roads in the Pradeshiya Sabha is undertaken and the roads\nare ranked in order of priority of importance for economic development.\n\nAn annual action plan for rural road maintenance is prepared by the Pradeshiya\nSabha along with an annual budget allocation.\n\nRoads  upgraded  under  the  project  are  provided  with  adequate  maintenance\nfunding  during subsequent years.

Upgrading works will be undertaken for wholesale markets serving major centers\nsuch  as  Colombo  and  Kandy,  and  for  smaller  consumer  markets  that  supply  everyday\nnecessities  to  the  local  population,  but  which  also  allow  market  outlets  to  local\nagricultural  producers.  Estimated  costs  for  market  improvement  range  from  as  low  as\n$10,000  for  small  consumer  markets  to  up  to  $400,000  for  large  combined  wholesale\nand consumer markets.\n\n2.\n\nSelection criteria for markets to be upgraded will include the following:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe  pradeshiya  sabha  has  produced  a  market  management  plan  which\ntakes  into  account  the  need  for  the  proper  disposal  of  solid  and  liquid\nwaste.\n\nThe  pradeshiya  sabha  has  agreed  that  separate  contracts  will  be  let  for\nfee collection and for market maintenance by private sector contractors.\n\nThe  pradeshiya  sabha  has  agreed  to  set  up  an  elected  committee  of\nmarket lessees.\n\nThe pradeshiya sabha has calculated the estimated increase in revenues\nas a result of improved facilities and has indicated the likely use of such\nincreased revenues.\n\nThe  markets  taken  up  for  maintenance  will  have  maximum  economic\nimpact based on population served, proximity to agriculturally productive\nareas, or access to processing or storage facilities.\n\n\f50\n\nDetailed Cost Estimates\n($ '000)a\n\nAppendix 7\n\nForeign\n\nLocal\n\nExchange Currency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\n            Subtotal (1)\n\n7,147\n\n15,650\n\n22,797\n\n2.

Most agricultural produce for local consumption is\ntraded at such markets and wholesale traders catering to urban markets also procure much of\ntheir  fruits  and  vegetables  from  farmers  and  other  traders  at  local  markets.    The  demand  for\nbetter quality vegetables and fruit is strong, both for local consumption and for urban markets.1\nCurrent markets, however, are not really suitable for high-quality produce trade due to their low\nsanitation  standard  and  uncovered  and  earthen-floored  facilities.  Traded  produce  is  also\ndamaged  during  transit  due  to  the  poor  quality  of  local  rural  access  roads.    Quantitative  and\nqualitative produce losses incurred in the local marketing chain are estimated at approximately\n40 percent of farmgate production.2  A series of discussions was undertaken with producers and\ntraders in the markets and better facilities and management were identified as among their top\npriorities.3  Improvement  of  the  quality  and  efficiency  of  markets  and  local  access  roads,\ntherefore,  can  be  seen  as  directly  benefiting  consumers,  farmers,  and  traders.  Such\nimprovements  will  also  complement  the  development  impacts  of  the  ADB-financed  Southern\nTransport  Corridor  Project  and  the  Southern  Road  Improvement  Project,  although  benefit\nquantification  has  conservatively  excluded  the  potential  demand  induced  by  these  two  road\ninvestments.\n\n2.\n\nDemand for Credit\n\n3.\nThe  demand  for  credit  by  potential  Southern  Province  entrepreneurs  is  estimated  from\nthe past experience of financial institutions participating in small- and medium-sized enterprise\n\n                  \n\n1 \n\n2 \n3 \n\nTA  3385-SRI: Southern Province Rural Economic  Advancement Project.

About 10 to 15 percent of this estimated demand is expected to\nemanate  from  the  project  area.  Assuming  a  continuation  of  the  historical  growth  in  credit\ndemand of 15 to 20 percent per year, the credit demand among SME enterprises in the project\narea during implementation amounts to at least $60 million.\n\nC.\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n1.\n\nGeneral\n\n4.\nPrices and other information used in the analysis were identified through market surveys\nand  observations.  To  determine  the  expected  direct  benefits  of  the  project  components  in\nquestion, quantifiable effects are valued by comparison of \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d project scenarios.\nBasic assumptions include\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nthe use of a world price numeraire;\nvalues expressed in constant 2001 prices so as to exclude inflation;\nthe Sri Lankan rupee is the unit of account, and the rate of exchange used here\nis the prevailing rate at the time of appraisal: SLRs 90 per dollar;\nfor nontraded goods and services, a standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.9 and\na shadow wage rate (SWR) of 0.75 are used; and\ntransfer payments such as taxes and subsidies are excluded in the calculation of\neconomic values.\n\n2.\n\nBenefits\n\na.\n\nImprovement of Rural Roads to Maintainable Standards\n\n5.\nGravel rural roads under local authorities (pradeshiya sabhas) are to be selected by the\nProject  for  upgrading  into  easily  maintainable  condition.    Selection  criteria  emphasize  the\neconomic  importance  of  the  roads  to  be  improved,  particularly  their  association  with  rural\nmarkets.  Benefits  of  these  road  enhancements  are  associated  with  the  initial  improvement  in\nroad quality plus the retention of that improved condition through timely and appropriate levels\nof maintenance.  Through better compaction, the installation of drains, etc., the improved roads\n(compared with their original condition) are expected to be within the capacity of the pradeshiya\nsabhas to maintain in good condition throughout the project life of 15 years.   Benefits include (i)\ndecreased  vehicle  operating  cost  (VOC),  estimated  to  decline  from  SLRs9.0/kilometer  (km)  to\n6.9/km as a per vehicle average; (ii) reduced travel time for farmers and consumers as average\nspeed on the roads increases from 10 km/hr to 15 km/hr; and (iii) a 15 percent decrease in the\namount of spoilage of agricultural produce during transportation to the markets.5  Spoilage and\ntraffic benefits are calculated in relation to the volume of business generated by the average of\ntwo markets (one large and one small) in the project area. To be conservative, benefits to future\ntraffic increases are not included in the analysis.\n\n                  \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\nThe  discussion  of  credit  flows  to  SMEs  is  constrained  by  limitations  of  data.  Neither  the  Central  Bank  of  Sri\nLanka nor the commercial banks collect SME data systematically.  The information in this document has been\ncompiled from various sources and the analysis is primarily based on externally financed projects rather than an\noverview  of  the  various  banks\u2019  financing  experience.    Figures  are  based  on  projections  from  Loan  1552:  SRI:\nSmall and Medium Enterprise Assistance Project, for $55 million, approved on  5 June 1997.\nFigures are drawn from TA 3385-SRI: Southern Province Rural Economic Advancement Project, for $800,000,\napproved on 29 December 1999.\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 15, page 3\n\nb. \n\nMarket Infrastructure Upgrading\n\n6.\nRural  markets  usually  include  some  open-sided  stalls  with  roofs  plus  a  larger  area  of\ncompletely  bare-earth,  open-air  stalls.  Access  and  parking  are  generally  congested  and\nsanitation  is  poor.    Improvements  under  the  Project,  while  site-specific,  are  likely  to  include\nelements  of  sanitation,  stall  construction,  paving,  parking  improvements,  etc.    Benefits  are\nexpected  to  include  (i)  a  9  percent  decrease  in  the  amount  of  produce  spoilage  during\nmarketing,  resulting  in  increased  farmer  sales  from  what  they  bring  to  the  market;  and  (ii)  a  5\npercent  increase  in  market  business  (beyond  the  increase  due  to  decreased  spoilage)  due  to\nbetter  facilities  for  consumers  and  traders,  half  of  which  is  assumed  to  be  generated  income\nincluded  as  an  economic  benefit.  Actual  markets  to  be  upgraded  will  be  determined  during\nproject  implementation  and  will  depend  upon  various  selection  criteria.    For  this  analysis,  two\nmarkets  have  been  evaluated:  one  at  Suriyawewa,  which  is  relatively  large,  plus  one  at\nAngunakalopalessa,  which  is  relatively  small  (footnote  5).  The  value  of  agricultural  produce\ntraded in the markets is calculated from the average local market price (by season) for produce\nof  the  typical  quality  that  prevails  in  these  markets.  These  prices  often  differ  from  those  of\nexport-quality commodities elsewhere in the country.\n\nc. \n\nIndicative Economic Activities Generated by the Project\n\nThe Project will provide enterprise development services and access to credit both for:\n7.\n(i)  the  upgrading  and  commercialization  of  existing  agriculture-based  enterprises,  and  (ii)  the\nestablishment  of  new  enterprises.  The  calculated  generated  net  economic  value  of  indicative\nenterprises represents the expected benefit to the local economy. Identified indicative enterprise\nactivities include broiler production, fruit production and processing, ornamental fish, fish pond\nculture, rice milling, shoe production, a poultry hatchery, and floriculture.\n\n3.\n\nCosts\n\n8.\nEstimated  costs  of  improvements  for  the  two  sample  markets  are  used.    Rural  road\nimprovement  costs  are  likely  to  differ  by  terrain  and  by  the  distance  that  the  material  must  be\ntransported.  An average estimated cost per km of SLRs725,000  (plus physical contingencies)\nis  used.    To  calculate  subcomponent  returns  for  the  roads  and  markets  subcomponents\n(respectively), shares of project implementation costs are included in the analysis.\n\n4. \n\nEconomic Returns\n\n9.\nThe rural roads subcomponent is expected to implement the improvement of 1,049 km\nof gravel roads.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 23 percent and the economic net\npresent  value  is  SLRs470  million  (Table  A15.1).    Sensitivity  analyses  for  decreases  in  the\nvarious  benefits  (spoilage  and  VOC  decreases  and  time  saving)  and  an  increase  in  costs\nindicate that these results are fairly robust. Maintenance, however, could prove to be a problem.\nIf  the  pradeshiya  sabhas  do  not  fulfill  their  responsibility  for  adequate  maintenance,  the\neconomic  returns  to  roads  could  dip  to  unacceptable  levels.  If  maintenance  is  sufficiently\ninadequate  as  to  cause  a  decline  in  expected  benefits  of  10  percent  each  year  over  the\npreceding year, the EIRR will dip to minus 1 percent.\n\n10.\nThe  Project\u2019s  market  subcomponent  assumes  that  20  markets  will  be  improved  at  an\naverage cost of SLRs9 million (plus physical contingencies). To analyze the full component, an\naverage of the Suriyawewa and Angunakalopalessa figures is used (Tables A15.2 and A15.3).\nUsing  the  assumption  that  benefits  can  be  expected  to  vary  in  proportion  to  the  level  of\n\n\f69\n\nAppendix 15, page 4\n\ninvestment,  all  benefits  are  adjusted  to  a  size  consistent  with  the  average  project  market\ninvestment. The EIRR for this subcomponent is 26 percent and the economic net present value\nis SLRs142 million.  Sensitivity analyses indicate the robustness of these figures.\n\nRates of return for 10 indicative enterprises are summarized in Table A15.4.  All can be\n11.\nconsidered  economically  viable,  indicating  their  potential  for  economic  benefits  to  the  local\neconomy.\n\nD.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\n1.\n\nPradeshiya Sabha Market Revenue\n\nPradeshiya  sabhas,  the  local  government  authorities,  have  responsibility  for  the\n12.\nprovision  of  a  number  of  local  services\u2014the  largest  of  which,  in  monetary  terms,  is  the\nmaintenance  of  rural  roads.    Resources  are  generally  inadequate  for  the  budgetary  demands.\nPradeshiya sabhas receive 60 to 70 percent of their revenue in the way of grants from provincial\nand  central  government  authorities.  They  also  raise  some  funds  on  their  own  via  various\nlicensing fees and rents. Of these sources, market revenues are particularly important.  One of\nthe goals of the improvement program for markets is to increase the pradeshiya sabhas\u2019 income\nfrom  this  source.  Market  managers  confirm  that  improved  markets,  compared  with  their\nunimproved state, will be likely to have more produce sales and will also be able to sustain an\nincrease in their fee rates due to the better facilities.  A \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d Project analysis of\npradeshiya sabha revenues is summarized in Table A15.3. The larger Suriyawewa market can\nbe expected to add SLRs1.3 million annually to the local authority\u2019s revenues while the smaller\nAngunakalopalessa  market  will  increase  revenues  by  SLRs300,000.  The  Project  will  also\nprovide public finance management training and services to the pradeshiya sabhas to help them\ndevelop additional ways in which to raise revenues and manage their budgets.\n\nFinancial  analyses  have  been  undertaken \n\nindicative\n13.\nenterprises.  Typical  investment  costs  include  equipment,  implements  and  materials,  land\npreparation, planning, and labor.  Depending upon the enterprise, unskilled labor is particularly\nexpected  to  be  utilized  plus  a  limited  amount  of  skilled  labor.  The  financial  internal  rates  of\nreturn  are  summarized  in  Table  A15.4.
