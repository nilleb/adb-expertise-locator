THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Sustainable and Inclusive Energy Program; (ii) a proposed \npolicy-based loan from the ordinary capital resources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) (A-\nloan); and (iii) a proposed policy-based loan funded through the participation of the Association \nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Infrastructure Fund (AIF) (B-loan), to the Republic of \nIndonesia for subprogram 1 of the Sustainable and Inclusive Energy Program.1 \n \n2.  Indonesia has set an ambitious target to raise its annual economic growth rate to 8% by \n2019. Achieving this target will depend to a large extent on the government\u2019s ability to revive an \nunderperforming energy sector. The government initiated a series of sector reforms in 2013\u2013\n2014 and is seeking to accelerate them during 2015\u20132019 with the aim to (i) expand energy \nproduction  through  greater  private  sector  investment  and  more  effective  public  sector \ninvestment; (ii) bolster the sustainability of the energy sector through increased reliance on \ndomestic gas, renewable energy, and energy efficiency investments; and (iii) provide access to \nmodern  energy  to  all  Indonesians.  The  program  closely  aligns  with  the  government\u2019s  key \npriorities and will cement a sustained partnership between ADB, the government, and several \ndevelopment partners. \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Development  problems.  Indonesia\u2019s  energy  sector  is  suffering  far-reaching, \ninterrelated problems throughout the value chain from the supply of primary energy to the \ndelivery of electricity to the country\u2019s people and enterprises. 2 Oil production continues to \ndecline while consumption skyrockets, causing the country to become a net oil importer in 2004. \nDespite being a world-leading exporter of liquefied natural gas from 1976\u20132006, the country \nsigned agreements in 2013 to begin importing sizeable amounts of liquefied natural gas in 2018 \nto meet rising demand for liquefied natural gas to fuel power generation and industrial use. Lack \nof sufficient capacity expansion and supply constraints in the electricity sector have led to \nbrownouts  in  several  high-density  areas.  Per  capita  electricity  consumption  and  electricity \naccess  are  low  compared  with  the  rates  in  other  countries  in  Southeast  Asia.  Electricity \nproduction relies heavily on coal, and this dependence is expected to grow from 54% in 2014 to \n65% by 2019, even though the country possesses a variety of renewable energy resources. \nPoor access to reliable and affordable electricity ranks among the top impediments faced by the \nmanufacturing sector. Investment in the energy sector overall remains greatly below what is \nneeded, and new projects often face long delays in permitting, financing, and construction.  \n \n4.  Inadequate  investment  in  the  energy  sector.  The  underinvestment by the public \nsector is the result of widespread government subsidies for fuels and electricity, which peaked \nat nearly $30 billion in 2013, and an inability to recover costs. Low energy tariffs have combined \nwith challenges in permitting, licensing, land acquisition, and environmental approvals, to restrict \nprivate sector investment in the sector to inadequate levels as well. So has the perceived \nfinancial  risk  posed  by  monopolistic,  subsidized  public  sector  offtakers.  For  example,  low \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Recent analyses of the energy sector that highlight the persistent challenges and provide potential policy solutions \nand road maps include the following: (i) National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS). 2014. Medium-\nTerm Economic Infrastructure Strategy\u2013Background Report for RPJMN, 2015\u20132019. Jakarta; (ii) ADB. 2014. \nEnergy Sector White Paper. Manila; and (iii) International Energy Agency. 2015. Energy Policies beyond IEA \nCountries: Indonesia 2015. Jakarta. ", "2 \ndomestic prices, aging fields, and an uncertain regulatory framework have discouraged private \nsector investment in the upstream and downstream gas markets. In the power subsector, \nunderinvestment has been compounded by delays in completing the few large and small fossil-\nfired, geothermal, and hydropower projects initiated during 2009\u20132014.3 \n \n5.  Constraints  to  scaling  up  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency. Renewable \nenergy deployment is lagging despite an abundance of renewable energy resources and a \nnational target to increase the use of renewables from just 6% of the country\u2019s primary energy \nmix in 2014 to 23% by 2025. This has been the result of low tariffs, delays in permitting, and \nprotracted negotiations with the State Electricity Corporation (PLN), which is the offtaker in \npower  purchase  agreements  in  the  country.  During  2012\u20132015,  the  government  began \nestablishing pricing mechanisms to incentivize private investment in small-scale hydropower, \nsolar photovoltaic, biomass, geothermal, and waste-to-energy systems. The government has \nalso set economy-wide energy efficiency targets. However, it has yet to enact guidelines to \nimplement  a  national  energy  conservation  master  plan  published  in  2005  that  would,  for \nexample,  promote  energy-efficient  equipment  or  appliance  standards  and  labeling  in  the \nhousehold and commercial sectors. This and the disincentive of low economy-wide energy \ncosts have made energy efficiency measures seem financially unviable. \n \n6.  Impediments to achieving 100% modern energy access. Indonesia\u2019s energy sector \nscores low on inclusiveness. Its 84% electrification ratio in 2014 was low relative to those of its \nneighbors.4 In many small power markets and rural areas, supply is limited to a few hours a day. \nWhile PLN did a commendable job by adding more than two million customers a year during \n2004\u20132014, connecting the remaining population will require a paradigm shift. The high cost of \ndelivering fossil fuels to small islands and remote areas\u2014when combined with low power loads, \nlimited household ability to pay, lack of interconnected grids that can support larger generating \nunits, and an unfavorable policy environment\u2014means that business-as-usual simply will not \nwork. The government\u2019s electrification effort lacks a comprehensive least-cost electrification \nplan  that  integrates  on-grid  and  off-grid  approaches,  a  suitable  regulatory  framework  that \nincorporates  the  private  sector,  an  appropriate  institutional  framework,  and  the  necessary \nbudgetary resources. \n \n7.  Energy sector at a crossroads. While it was once a significant energy exporter that \nsubsidized domestic energy prices, Indonesia must now import a substantial amount of its \nenergy needs at global market prices. This has occurred at a time when it is trying to transition \nfrom  being  a  bulk  commodity  producer  for  global  markets  to  becoming  an  exporter  of \nmanufacturing products and a more services-oriented economy. The government believes that \nexpanding manufacturing and services will provide greater opportunities for all the country\u2019s \ncitizens, but it will also require greater access to reliable energy sources. The country has \nstruggled  to  put  in  place  an  appropriate  planning  or  policy  framework  to  meet  its  energy \nchallenges in an affordable and inclusive manner during its period of economic growth in 2000\u2013\n2014. The lack of comprehensive planning to integrate fuel- and electricity-related issues had \nled to lopsided priorities, ad hoc decision making, and the resulting suboptimal investments. \nRegulatory uncertainty and an uneven playing field favoring state-owned companies meant that \nthe private sector mostly stayed away from the energy sector. In addition, those projects that did \nget under way often ground to a halt as they encountered a tangle of permitting and licensing \nobstacles and poor coordination between central and local government agencies. Subsidized \n                                                \n3  PLN estimates that the power subsector needs it and the private sector to invest almost $100 billion during 2015\u2013\n2019, about $50 billion of which PLN plans to deploy itself. \n4  In most other large Association of Southeast Asian Nations countries, the rate is close to 100%. In Indonesia, over \n35 million people still do not have access to electricity. ", "3 \nenergy and electricity prices fueled runaway demand. State-owned monopolies that were being \nregulated on a cost-plus margin formula had no incentive to manage this demand or become \nmore efficient.  \n \n8.  The  government\u2019s  medium-term  national  development  plan,  2015\u20132019.  The \ngovernment recognizes the crucial role the energy sector must play in realizing the country\u2019s \neconomic growth aspirations. It has made the sector a key part of its national medium-term \ndevelopment plan for 2015\u20132019.5 The plan aims to (i) expand electricity access to 96% of \nIndonesians and increase per capita consumption from 843 kilowatt-hours in 2014 to 1,200 \nkilowatt-hours in 2019; (ii) bolster domestic energy security by boosting the production of gas, \nimproving supply of downstream oil and oil products, and increasing the use of renewable \nenergy; and (iii) scale up energy efficiency. ADB is aligning its strategies and operations with the \nplan, whose goals will require a sustained, multiyear effort with a clear road map of actions \nrequired for each subsectors. This is included in the Indonesia Country Operations Business \nPlan for 2015\u20132017; and will be reflected in ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy (CPS) for \nIndonesia for 2015\u20132019, and its energy sector assessment, strategy, and road map, which are \nboth being finalized.   \n \n9.  ADB\u2019s value added in the energy sector. During 1967\u20132014, ADB has financed 21 \ninvestment projects in Indonesia\u2019s energy sector through $2.81 billion in loans. During 1999\u2013\n2015, these investments included six loans totaling $1.04 billion.6 In the policy arena, ADB\u2019s \nInfrastructure Reform Sector Development Program during 2006\u20132010 supported high-level \nstrategic, policy, and regulatory reforms in a variety of sectors that included energy.7 ADB\u2019s \nprivate sector operations have provided financing for large geothermal projects during 2013\u2013\n2014. During 2013\u20132015, ADB also provided technical assistance to Indonesia\u2019s energy sector \nthat helped the government kick off its reform agenda. Support included (i) policy dialogue on \nreducing subsidies and cost-recovery tariffs for fuels and electricity, (ii) the revision of the \ngeothermal law and an improved tariff scheme, (iii) developing proposals for a tariff scheme for \nwind energy and solar photovoltaic rooftop plants, (iv) exploring opportunities for regional power \ntrade and interconnections within the ASEAN, (v) establishing an energy efficiency market, and \n(vi) evaluating prospects for carbon capture and storage. \n \n10.  ADB\u2019s experience in the sector clearly indicates that an appropriate enabling policy \nenvironment is a prerequisite for scaling up clean energy deployment and making access to \nenergy more inclusive. This need is best exemplified by the geothermal sector where, during \n2010\u20132014, very few new projects were initiated despite the availability of concessional and \nlong-term finance.  In addition, the government has asked ADB to consider providing a mix of \nlending modalities during the new CPS period that have a strategic impact at the sector level, \nscale, and flexibility\u2014namely, policy-based lending, multitranche financing facilities, and results-\nbased lending. The programmatic approach and policy-based loan for this program incorporate \nthe lessons ADB has learned in the sector. By focusing on a series of subsector reforms, the \nprogram aims to translate the high-level sector regulatory reform that was implemented under \nADB\u2019s Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program into sustained subsector actions \n(footnote 7). \n                                                \n5  Government of Indonesia. 2015.

Looking ahead, promoting energy security is one of three strategic pillars in the CPS \nnow being prepared for 2015\u20132019. To improve energy security, ADB will help the government \nto (i) undertake sector policy reform to make access to energy sustainable and inclusive; (ii) \nstrengthen the reach, reliability, and efficiency of the nation\u2019s electricity grid; and (iii) enable \ngreater use of clean sources of primary energy, particularly in hydropower, geothermal, and \ngas-fired power generation. ADB will also provide TA for activities to expand energy efficiency, \ncarbon capture and storage (CCS), and access to electricity. These priorities align with ADB\u2019s \n2014 Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, which emphasizes the need for inclusive economic \ngrowth,  infrastructure  development,  and  policy-based  engagements  in  middle-income \ncountries.8 In addition, ADB plans private sector operations to support the expansion of liquefied \nnatural gas production in eastern Indonesia and other gas and renewable energy projects. \n \n12.  The policy-based loan approach and budget support. The program will help ensure \nthe planned increased contribution of clean energy from gas, renewable energy and energy \nefficiency  to  the  energy  mix  by  2025,  while  putting  in  place  measures  that  will  limit  the \nenvironmental impact of the country\u2019s growing fossil fuel reliance. \n \n13.  A programmatic approach will be pursued through three subprograms over the 5-year \n2015\u20132019  medium-term  plan  period.  The  program  will  complement  and  underpin  ADB\u2019s \nproposed project loans during 2015\u20132019 for geothermal, hydropower, and gas-fired power \ngeneration projects, as well as results-based loans for strengthening the electricity grid that will \nuse a new government modality providing a sovereign guarantee to state-owned enterprises \n(SOEs). This lending program and ADB\u2019s overall energy sector strategy are also designed to \nsupport  PLN\u2019s  electricity  power  supply  business  plan  for  2015\u20132024,  which  calls  for  35 \ngigawatts of additional capacity to be installed by 2019.9 To support these objectives, ADB \napproved a policy and advisory TA in December 2014 for targeted policy dialogue and to \nprepare the subsequent subprograms.10 The program represents a coordinated effort by several \ndevelopment partners to support the government\u2019s reform agenda.11 \n \n14.  Subprogram 1 aims to lock in prerequisite enabling policies, such as those needed to set \ncost-reflective  tariffs  and    improve regulatory certainty  in  the  extension  of gas  production-\nsharing contracts. In some cases, it will also carry out diagnostic work and planning to guide \nsubsequent policy actions. The subsequent subprograms will then seek to implement measures \nto further improve sector governance, expand domestic gas production, increase the use of \nrenewable energy, establish an energy efficiency marketplace in the public and private sectors, \nexpand inclusive energy access by streamlining public funding and expanding private sector \nparticipation,  and  scale  up  measures  to  lower  greenhouse  gas  emissions  from  fossil  fuel \noperations. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n15.  The  impact  will  be  greater  domestic  energy  security  and  an  increase  in  access to \nmodern forms of energy. They reflect the objectives of the government\u2019s medium-term plan for \n2015\u20132019. The outcome will be increased power supply from sustainable and more accessible \nenergy sources. This will be measured through several indicators, including the percentage of \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2014.

", "5 \npeople with access to electricity, with the target set at an increase from 84% in 2014 to 96% by \n2020. Other indicator targets will be increases in the percentage of renewable energy in the \nelectricity generation mix from 6% in 2014 to 10% by 2020 and annual private sector investment \nin the oil and gas sector raised from $14 billion in 2014 to $18 billion in 2020.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n16.  Subprogram 1 supports the government\u2019s energy sector reform agenda to achieve the \nfollowing  outputs:  (i)  improved  sector  governance,  (ii)  the  enabling  of  markets  for  private \nparticipation, and (iii) improved regulatory environment for expanding access to clean energy \nand energy efficiency. The government began undertaking reforms related to all three outputs in \nJune 2013, and all 17 policy actions (including 13 policy triggers) required for subprogram 1 \nhave been accomplished.12 \n \n1.  Output 1: Sector Governance Improved \n17.  Output 1 activities support government efforts to (i) adopt economic tariffs for fuels and \nelectricity, and (ii) improve the performance of public sector enterprises in the energy sector. \n \n18.  Cost-recovery-based tariffs for fuels and electricity adopted. In January 2015, the \ngovernment removed subsidies on gasoline and established a fixed per-liter subsidy scheme of \nRp1,000 ($0.08) for diesel. The retail fuel prices will be adjusted periodically by the Ministry of \nEnergy and Mineral Resources to reflect the global prices of the fuel products, including taxes. \nIn the case of electricity, the government removed subsidies for industrial, commercial, and \nlarge residential consumers in late 2014. It then established a system of monthly automatic \nprice adjustments for these consumers in early 2015 that accounts for the exchange rate, the \nIndonesian crude oil price, and inflation. The government has started these price increases.13 \nSubprograms 2 and 3 will phase in price adjustments for all classes of consumers. ADB has \nsupported the government in this effort through regional benchmarking of the fiscal burden of \nsubsidies and elaborating alternatives for phasing out subsidies. \n \n19.  Performance of public-sector enterprises in the energy sector improved. To try to \nimprove  the  efficiency  of  state-owned  energy  companies  and  regulate  them  based  on \nperformance, the government instituted service quality standards for PLN in 2014. Subprograms \n2 and 3 will establish an economic regulation for PLN and other SOEs in the energy sector. The \ngovernment is attempting to benchmark PLN\u2019s controllable costs for a 5-year tariff period. It will \nthen seek to incentivize it to improve efficiency by allowing it to keep eventual differences \nbetween allowed (regulatory) and actual costs of service provision as additional profit until the \nend of the tariff period. Subprograms 2 and 3 will also work to restructure energy sector SOEs \nalong regional lines or business divisions to allow for more efficient operations. \n \n2.  Output 2: Markets for Private Participation Enabled \n20.  Output  2  involves  support  for  government  efforts  (i)  to  increase  private  sector \nparticipation in the electricity business by streamlining the licensing and permitting of private \npower projects and enabling greater private sector participation in the electricity transmission \n                                                \n12 Policy triggers are prior reforms that are to be completed as a prerequisite for the disbursement of loan proceeds. \n13 The government will phase in adjustments for 1,300 volt-ampere (VA) and 2,200 VA households in 2016. It is also \nworking on a road map for phasing in market prices (with direct cash transfer payments) for the 450 VA and 900 \nVA customers who are currently being subsidized. These actions are included in subprogram 2. Currently, of total \nelectricity sales, about 52% in kWh terms and 60% in revenue terms are unsubsidized. \n ", "6 \nand generation business; and (ii) to promote domestic gas production and an increase in the \ndelivery of gas into the domestic market, in part through greater private sector involvement. \n \n21.  Increased private sector participation in the electricity business enabled. During \nMarch\u2013May 2015, the government delegated the licensing and permitting of private power \nprojects  to  a  new  one-stop-shop  within  the  Indonesia  Investment  Coordinating  Board. \nRecognizing that this itself was not enough, the government also began streamlining regulations \nthat govern project permits to reduce approval times.14 In addition, while a 2009 electricity law \nhad allowed the private sector to access PLN\u2019s transmission lines, the requisite implementing \nregulations were not enacted until early 2015. The government has now established the basis \nfor wheeling arrangements that could allow private power producers to use PLN\u2019s transmission \nsystem  to  sell  power  directly  to  end  users  in  distant  locations.  Under  the  subsequent \nsubprograms, it will set up rates and settlement rules and the basis for cross-border trade. \n \n22.  Domestic gas production and increased delivery of gas into the domestic market \npromoted. The government is keen to reverse the plateauing trend in domestic gas production \nby increasing investment in exploration and production and facilitating greater investment in the \npipelines, liquefied natural gas infrastructure, and fueling stations  needed to make greater \ndomestic use of the country\u2019s gas resources. It is currently preparing a new oil and gas law. It \nhas also addressed delays in decision making on expiring production-sharing contracts that \nhave thwarted private sector interest in Indonesia\u2019s gas sector by imposing a transparent, time-\nbound process for these decisions. ADB provided key inputs for drafts of this new regulation \n(footnote 10). \n \n3.  Output 3: Regulatory Environment for Increased Access to Clean Energy \nand Energy Efficiency Improved \n23.  Activities  under  output  3  aim  to  help  the  government  (i)  expand  generation  from \nindigenous forms of renewable energy that can offset fossil-fired generation and imports of oil, \n(ii) improve standards and policies for energy efficiency, (iii) expand access to electricity, and \n(iv) minimize the environmental impacts from the use of fossil fuels. \n \n24.  Incentives for renewable energy generation established. In 2014, the government \nrevised its law governing geothermal resources to reduce barriers to the large-scale deployment \nof geothermal energy. The obstacles were inadequate information on such resources, which led \nto failed tendering for projects; and a lack of ownership by local governments due to the \nlopsided prescribed division of revenue from potential projects between them and the national \ngovernment. The government also issued an improved tariff scheme based on the principle of \navoided costs by region. ADB helped develop the basis for the new tariff scheme and continues \nto support work in related areas.15 In 2014\u20132015, the government established tariff incentives \nfor hydropower, biomass, and biogas projects with a capacity of less than 10 megawatts. Under \nsubprograms 2 and 3, additional incentives for new renewable energy sources such as wind \npower and solar photovoltaic will be enacted, and existing related regulations will be updated. \n \n25.  Standards and policies for energy efficiency improved. The government reduction of \nelectricity subsidies and rising tariffs are expected to spur increased investments in energy \nefficiency investments. The government issued minimum efficiency performance standards for \nkey household appliances (air conditioners and compact fluorescent lamps) and established a \n                                                \n14 Key regulations that have been amended include those relating to acquiring land for buildings, land-use permits \nwithin forestry areas, and jetty permits for water-based transport. \n15 ADB. 2015. Unlocking Indonesia\u2019s Geothermal Potential. Manila. ", "7 \ngreen  building  code  that  includes  energy  efficiency  requirements.  ADB  is  helping  the \ngovernment  develop  these  regulations. 16  Subsequent  subprograms  will  support  the \nestablishment of energy services companies, energy-efficient building codes, and a national \nenergy-efficient street lighting program. \n \n26.  Access to electricity expanded. The government has begun creating a comprehensive \nregulatory framework to deploy public and private sources of finance for inclusive energy access. \nIt is preparing a national least-cost electrification road map and increasing budgetary resources \nfor rural electrification. It has included these elements in its new national energy plan to be \nissued  in  2015  and  has  launched  a  pilot  activity  on  Sumba  Island with  ADB\u2019s  support to \nevaluate  innovative  financing  and  project  designs  and  a  multi-stakeholder  approach  for \nelectrification.17 Subsequent subprograms will lead to a national electrification program involving \nboth the public and private sectors. \n \n27.  Environmental impacts of fossil-fueled generation minimized. The government has \nalso recognized the need to minimize carbon emissions from fossil fuel-based activity. It has \nidentified CCS as an important means to limiting carbon emissions from the industrial sector. \nSince 2012, ADB has been supporting the government in its CCS development efforts.18 The \ngovernment will seek to establish regulations for CCS activity in the gas sector, scale up other \nclean fossil fuel technologies, and develop plans for a low carbon future for the energy sector \nthrough pricing of carbon, participations in emission trading programs etc. \n \n28.  Triggers for subprograms 2 and 3. Subprograms 2 and 3 have been designed to scale \nup the reforms initiated in subprogram 1 in a flexible, incremental way. The government and \nADB have agreed that subprograms 2 and 3 will include 37 indicative policy actions that are to \nbe completed by the end of the program\u201422 under subprogram 2 by 2017, and 15 under \nsubprogram 3 by 2019. A medium-term framework, which includes anticipated achievements, is \nincluded in the policy matrix. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n29.  To support its energy sector reform initiatives, the government has requested a single-\ntranche loan of $400,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (A-loan) and a single \ntranche loan of $100,000,000 funded through the participation of AIF (B-loan), to help finance \nsubprogram 1. The A-loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, a \nstraight-line repayment method, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% \nper year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the loan agreement. Based on this \narrangement, the average loan maturity is 9.25 years, and there is no maturity premium payable \nto ADB. The B-loan will have the same term and repayment schedule as the A-loan and an \ninterest rate determined in accordance with the LIBOR-based lending facility. The government \nhas provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices \nwere its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any advice from ADB. The \nproceeds of the loans will be used to finance the full foreign exchange cost (excluding local \ntaxes  and  duties)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding \n                                                \n16 ADB. 2013.

Manila. \n ", "8 \nineligible items and imports listed in the negative list attached to the loan agreement. The \nproceeds of the loans will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s simplification of disbursement \nprocedures  and  related  requirement  for  policy-based  loans.19 Per  AIF  requirements,  the \nproceeds of the loans should be withdrawn concurrently. \n \n30.  The size of the program loan is based on (i) the importance of the sector to the economy \nand  the  program\u2019s  projected  benefits,  (ii)  the  need  to  conform  to  the  overall  financing \nrequirement of ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, and (iii) the development expenditure \nsupported  by  the  program.  Based  on  its  2015  revised  budget,  the  government\u2019s  net \ndevelopment financing needs are $40.6 billion (deficit plus debt and non-debt payments). The \ngovernment  is  required  to  restrict  its  budget  deficit  to  3%  of  gross  domestic  product. \nDevelopment assistance loans from external development partners are expected to contribute \n$3.9 billion to this amount. With a larger deficit expected as a result of slower economic growth \nand continued volatility in the financial market, the government has requested additional budget \nfinancing to the tune of $3.6 billion, from development partners. For the program, in addition to \nADB\u2019s loan, development partners have confirmed their contribution of about the equivalent of \n$813 million in collaborative parallel financing (Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement of France\u2013\n$113 million equivalent, German development cooperation through KfW\u2013$200 million equivalent, \nand the World Bank\u2013$500 million). \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n31.  The Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs will be the executing agency. This will \nallow for inter-ministerial cooperation on energy sector issues. The Ministry of Energy and \nMineral Resources, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, and the \nIndonesia Investment Coordinating Board will be the implementing agencies. The executing \nagency will be responsible for  overall program implementation. The program implementing \nagencies will be responsible for undertaking certain program-related actions. The Coordinating \nMinistry for Economic Affairs will establish a program management unit to oversee overall \nprogram  monitoring  and  reporting.  The  program  implementation  units  at  the  implementing \nagencies  will  report  to  the  program  management  unit  and  monitor  the  progress  on  the \nimplementation of reforms within their agencies. The implementation periods are June 2013\u2013\nSeptember 2015 for subprogram 1, October 2015\u2013September 2017 for subprogram 2, and \nOctober 2017\u2013September 2019 for subprogram 3. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n32.  The  program\u2019s  three  outputs  will  each  make  positive  macroeconomic  contributions. \nElectricity tariffs based on cost recovery will lead to (i) fiscal savings that can be used for \ninfrastructure  development  and  welfare  programs,  which  in  turn  will  have  multiplier  effects \nacross the economy; and (ii) stimulation of increased investment and capacity expansion in the \nelectricity sector that will directly boost gross domestic product. Better sector governance will \nimprove efficiency in public sector energy  companies, lower borrowing costs, and improve \nfinancial sustainability. Greater private sector investment in the energy sector will help increase \ndomestic production of energy and lead to economy-wide employment benefits. Finally, by \nincreasing access to clean energy from renewable energy and gas in Indonesia, the program \nwill  help  avoid  some  expansion  in  coal-fired  power  generation  and  the  emissions  of  air \npollutants and greenhouse gases that these plants would have produced. To the extent that \n                                                \n19 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila.

Saving energy through energy efficiency measures will \nreduce  total  added  generation  capacity  needs  and  expand  access  to  energy  to  unserved \nsections of the population. The program\u2019s economic benefits will average $5.5 billion per year \nand readily exceed its annual economic costs of $3.3 billion. The program is expected to add \nmore than $113 billion to Indonesia\u2019s overall gross domestic product cumulatively by 2023.20 \n \nB.  Governance \n \n33.  Indonesia has made steady progress in strengthening its public financial management \n(PFM). The Government Financial Management and Revenue Administration Project, under \nimplementation by the government of Indonesia since 2004, has supported reforms aimed at \nstrengthening efficiency, governance, and accountability in PFM. In addition, the government\u2019s \n2012 medium-term strategy note called for improving the oversight of PFM reforms designed to \nstrengthen the process of allocating the budget resources of priority sectors, the link between \nplanning and budgeting, and the budget\u2019s results orientation. PFM reforms are also increasingly \naligned with the priorities identified in Indonesia\u2019s 2015\u20132019 medium-term development plan \n(footnote 5). The majority of SOEs are fully owned by the government, and SOE operations are \nlinked to the government budget because many receive significant subsidies. The government \nalso  monitors  the  performance of  SOEs  due to  the  potential fiscal  risks  they  represent.21  \nTechnical assistance provided by ADB to review the country\u2019s energy sector-wide procurement \nsystem  found  SOEs  in  the  energy  sector  to  have  satisfactory  institutional  frameworks, \nmanagement capacity, procurement operations, and market practices.22 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n34.  The reforms supported under the program will increase access to modern forms of \nenergy, stimulate economic growth, and help create jobs, all of which are key elements in \nreducing poverty. The program is classified as a general intervention, since its proposed outputs \nwill benefit all citizens, including the poor and vulnerable. In the case of tariff increases, low-\nincome  households  will  have  access  to  direct  cash  transfers.  The  third  output  will  have \nparticularly positive impacts on the poor by increasing their access to energy. This will stimulate \nrural and peri-urban small businesses and create jobs; add value within the agriculture, fishing, \nand forestry sectors; and reduce household exposure to the indoor air pollution that comes from \nburning  biomass  for  heat  and  cooking.  Subprogram  1  is  classified  as  having  no  gender \nelements. Better access to energy will benefit women along with the population at large.23 \n \nD.  Safeguards \n35.  The program has been classified as category B for environment and category C for both \ninvoluntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  people.  The  envisaged  reforms  will  not  entail \ninvoluntary land acquisition or activities in indigenous peoples\u2019 areas. Any potential indirect \nsocial and environmental impacts arising from increased investment in the energy sector will be \nevaluated on a project-by-project basis as required by Indonesia\u2019s environmental and land \n                                                \n20 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Government  of  Indonesia  and  Development  Partners.  2012.

The \ngovernment has the institutional capacity and commitment to manage these impacts.24 \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n36.  The main risks to the program\u2019s success arise from the potential for (i) macroeconomic \ninstability, (ii) a lack of coordination in policy formulation and project implementation, and (iii) \nregulatory backsliding and resistance within the legislative process to increased private sector \nparticipation  in  the  energy  sector. These  and the  other  pertinent  risks  are  categorized  as \nmedium and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.25 Mitigation \nmeasures  taken  include  TA  to  support  improved  coordination  and  support  the  design  of \nregulations  and  policies  that  are  well-aligned  with  government  priorities  and  tenets  of  the \nconstitution. The program\u2019s overall risk level is considered to be medium, and its benefits \noutweigh its costs.  \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITION \n37.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of program shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan \nagreement. No disbursement shall be made unless ADB is satisfied that the government has \ncompleted the policy actions specified in the policy matrix relating to the program. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n38.
