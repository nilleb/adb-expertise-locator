Achieving this target will depend to a large extent on the government\u2019s ability to revive an \nunderperforming  energy  sector.  The  government  initiated  a  series  of  sector  reforms  in  2013\u2013\n2014  and  is  seeking  to  accelerate  them  during  2015\u20132019  with  the  aim  to  (i)  expand  energy \nproduction  through  greater  private  sector  investment  and  more  effective  public  sector \ninvestment;  (ii)  bolster  the  sustainability  of  the  energy  sector  through  increased  reliance  on \ndomestic gas, renewable energy, and energy efficiency investments; and (iii) provide access to \nmodern  energy  to  all  Indonesians.  The  program  closely  aligns  with  the  government\u2019s  key \npriorities  and  will  cement  a  sustained  partnership  between  ADB,  the  government,  and  several \ndevelopment partners. \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\nis  suffering \n\nDevelopment  problems. \n\nIndonesia\u2019s  energy  sector \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nfar-reaching, \ninterrelated  problems  throughout  the  value  chain  from  the  supply  of  primary  energy  to  the \ndelivery  of  electricity  to  the  country\u2019s  people  and  enterprises.  2 Oil  production  continues  to \ndecline while consumption skyrockets, causing the country to become a net oil importer in 2004. \nDespite  being  a  world-leading  exporter  of  liquefied  natural  gas  from  1976\u20132006,  the  country \nsigned agreements in 2013 to begin importing sizeable amounts of liquefied natural gas in 2018 \nto meet rising demand for liquefied natural gas to fuel power generation and industrial use. Lack \nof  sufficient  capacity  expansion  and  supply  constraints  in  the  electricity  sector  have  led  to \nbrownouts  in  several  high-density  areas.  Per  capita  electricity  consumption  and  electricity \naccess  are  low  compared  with  the  rates  in  other  countries  in  Southeast  Asia.  Electricity \nproduction relies heavily on coal, and this dependence is expected to grow from 54% in 2014 to \n65%  by  2019,  even  though  the  country  possesses  a  variety  of  renewable  energy  resources. \nPoor access to reliable and affordable electricity ranks among the top impediments faced by the \nmanufacturing  sector.  Investment  in  the  energy  sector  overall  remains  greatly  below  what  is \nneeded, and new projects often face long delays in permitting, financing, and construction.  \n \n4. \nInadequate  investment  in  the  energy  sector.  The  underinvestment  by  the  public \nsector is the result of widespread government subsidies for fuels and electricity, which peaked \nat nearly $30 billion in 2013, and an inability to recover costs. Low energy tariffs have combined \nwith challenges in permitting, licensing, land acquisition, and environmental approvals, to restrict \nprivate  sector  investment  in  the  sector  to  inadequate  levels  as  well.  So  has  the  perceived \nfinancial  risk  posed  by  monopolistic,  subsidized  public  sector  offtakers.  For  example,  low \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Recent analyses of the energy sector that highlight the persistent challenges and provide potential policy solutions \nand  road  maps  include  the  following:  (i)  National  Development  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS).  2014.

Manila;  and  (iii)  International  Energy  Agency.  2015.  Energy  Policies  beyond  IEA \nCountries: Indonesia 2015. Jakarta. \n\n\f2 \n\ndomestic prices, aging fields, and an uncertain regulatory framework  have discouraged private \nsector  investment  in  the  upstream  and  downstream  gas  markets.  In  the  power  subsector, \nunderinvestment has been compounded by delays in completing the few large and small fossil-\nfired, geothermal, and hydropower projects initiated during 2009\u20132014.3 \n \n5. \nConstraints  to  scaling  up  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency.  Renewable \nenergy  deployment  is  lagging  despite  an  abundance  of  renewable  energy  resources  and  a \nnational target to increase the use of renewables from just 6% of the country\u2019s primary energy \nmix  in  2014  to  23%  by  2025.  This  has  been  the  result  of  low  tariffs,  delays  in  permitting,  and \nprotracted  negotiations  with  the  State  Electricity  Corporation  (PLN),  which  is  the  offtaker  in \npower  purchase  agreements  in  the  country.  During  2012\u20132015,  the  government  began \nestablishing  pricing  mechanisms  to  incentivize  private  investment  in  small-scale  hydropower, \nsolar  photovoltaic,  biomass,  geothermal,  and  waste-to-energy  systems.  The  government  has \nalso  set  economy-wide  energy  efficiency  targets.  However,  it  has  yet  to  enact  guidelines  to \nimplement  a  national  energy  conservation  master  plan  published  in  2005  that  would,  for \nexample,  promote  energy-efficient  equipment  or  appliance  standards  and  labeling  in  the \nhousehold  and  commercial  sectors.  This  and  the  disincentive  of  low  economy-wide  energy \ncosts have made energy efficiency measures seem financially unviable. \n\n \n6. \nImpediments  to  achieving  100%  modern  energy  access.  Indonesia\u2019s energy  sector \nscores low on inclusiveness. Its 84% electrification ratio in 2014 was low relative to those of its \nneighbors.4 In many small power markets and rural areas, supply is limited to a few hours a day. \nWhile  PLN  did  a  commendable  job  by  adding  more  than  two  million  customers  a  year  during \n2004\u20132014, connecting the remaining population will require a paradigm shift. The high cost of \ndelivering fossil fuels to small islands and remote areas\u2014when combined with low power loads, \nlimited household ability to pay, lack of interconnected grids that can support larger generating \nunits,  and  an  unfavorable  policy  environment\u2014means  that  business-as-usual  simply  will  not \nwork.  The  government\u2019s  electrification  effort  lacks  a  comprehensive  least-cost  electrification \nplan  that  integrates  on-grid  and  off-grid  approaches,  a  suitable  regulatory  framework  that \nincorporates  the  private  sector,  an  appropriate  institutional  framework,  and  the  necessary \nbudgetary resources. \n\n \nEnergy  sector  at  a  crossroads.  While  it  was  once  a  significant  energy  exporter  that \n7. \nsubsidized  domestic  energy  prices,  Indonesia  must  now  import  a  substantial  amount  of  its \nenergy needs at global market prices. This has occurred at a time when it is trying to transition \nfrom  being  a  bulk  commodity  producer  for  global  markets  to  becoming  an  exporter  of \nmanufacturing products and a more services-oriented economy. The government believes that \nexpanding  manufacturing  and  services  will  provide  greater  opportunities  for  all  the  country\u2019s \ncitizens,  but  it  will  also  require  greater  access  to  reliable  energy  sources.  The  country  has \nstruggled  to  put  in  place  an  appropriate  planning  or  policy  framework  to  meet  its  energy \nchallenges in an affordable and inclusive manner during its period of economic growth in 2000\u2013\n2014.  The  lack  of  comprehensive  planning  to  integrate  fuel-  and  electricity-related  issues  had \nled  to  lopsided  priorities,  ad  hoc  decision  making,  and  the  resulting  suboptimal  investments. \nRegulatory uncertainty and an uneven playing field favoring state-owned companies meant that \nthe private sector mostly stayed away from the energy sector. In addition, those projects that did \nget under way often ground to a halt as they encountered a tangle of  permitting and licensing \nobstacles  and  poor  coordination  between  central  and  local  government  agencies.  Subsidized \n\n                                                \n3  PLN estimates that the power subsector needs it and the private sector to invest almost $100 billion during 2015\u2013\n\n2019, about $50 billion of which PLN plans to deploy itself. \n\n4  In most other large Association of Southeast Asian Nations countries, the rate is close to 100%. In Indonesia, over \n\n35 million people still do not have access to electricity. \n\n\f3 \n\nenergy and electricity prices fueled runaway demand. State-owned monopolies that were being \nregulated  on  a  cost-plus  margin  formula  had  no  incentive  to  manage  this  demand  or  become \nmore efficient.  \n \nThe  government\u2019s  medium-term  national  development  plan,  2015\u20132019.  The \n8. \ngovernment  recognizes  the  crucial  role  the  energy  sector  must  play  in  realizing  the  country\u2019s \neconomic  growth  aspirations.  It  has  made  the  sector  a  key  part  of  its  national  medium-term \ndevelopment  plan  for  2015\u20132019.5 The  plan  aims  to  (i)  expand  electricity  access  to  96%  of \nIndonesians  and  increase  per  capita  consumption  from  843  kilowatt-hours  in  2014  to  1,200 \nkilowatt-hours  in  2019;  (ii)  bolster  domestic  energy  security  by  boosting  the  production  of gas, \nimproving  supply  of  downstream  oil  and  oil  products,  and  increasing  the  use  of  renewable \nenergy; and (iii) scale up energy efficiency. ADB is aligning its strategies and operations with the \nplan,  whose  goals  will  require  a  sustained,  multiyear  effort  with  a  clear  road  map  of  actions \nrequired  for  each  subsectors.  This  is  included  in  the  Indonesia  Country  Operations  Business \nPlan  for  2015\u20132017;  and  will  be  reflected  in  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS)  for \nIndonesia for 2015\u20132019, and its energy sector assessment, strategy, and road map, which are \nboth being finalized.   \n \n9. \nADB\u2019s  value  added  in  the  energy  sector.  During  1967\u20132014,  ADB  has  financed  21 \ninvestment  projects  in  Indonesia\u2019s  energy  sector  through  $2.81  billion  in  loans.  During  1999\u2013\n2015,  these  investments  included  six  loans  totaling  $1.04  billion.6 In  the  policy  arena,  ADB\u2019s \nInfrastructure  Reform  Sector  Development  Program  during  2006\u20132010  supported  high-level \nstrategic,  policy,  and  regulatory  reforms  in  a  variety  of  sectors  that  included  energy.7 ADB\u2019s \nprivate  sector  operations  have  provided  financing  for  large  geothermal  projects  during  2013\u2013\n2014. During 2013\u20132015, ADB also provided technical assistance to Indonesia\u2019s energy sector \nthat  helped the government kick  off  its reform  agenda.  Support  included (i)  policy  dialogue  on \nreducing  subsidies  and  cost-recovery  tariffs  for  fuels  and  electricity,  (ii)  the  revision  of  the \ngeothermal law and an improved tariff scheme, (iii) developing proposals for a tariff scheme for \nwind energy and solar photovoltaic rooftop plants, (iv) exploring opportunities for regional power \ntrade and interconnections within the ASEAN, (v) establishing an energy efficiency market, and \n(vi) evaluating prospects for carbon capture and storage. \n \n10. \nADB\u2019s  experience  in  the  sector  clearly  indicates  that  an  appropriate  enabling  policy \nenvironment  is  a  prerequisite  for  scaling  up  clean  energy  deployment  and  making  access  to \nenergy  more  inclusive.  This  need  is  best  exemplified  by  the  geothermal  sector  where,  during \n2010\u20132014,  very  few  new  projects  were  initiated  despite  the  availability  of  concessional  and \nlong-term finance.   In  addition, the government  has asked  ADB  to  consider  providing  a mix  of \nlending modalities  during  the  new  CPS  period  that  have  a strategic  impact  at the  sector  level, \nscale, and flexibility\u2014namely, policy-based lending, multitranche financing facilities, and results-\nbased lending. The programmatic approach and policy-based loan for this program incorporate \nthe  lessons  ADB  has  learned  in  the  sector.  By  focusing  on  a  series  of  subsector  reforms,  the \nprogram  aims  to  translate the  high-level  sector  regulatory  reform  that  was  implemented  under \nADB\u2019s  Infrastructure  Reform  Sector  Development  Program  into  sustained  subsector  actions \n(footnote 7). \n                                                \n5  Government of Indonesia. 2015.

To improve energy security, ADB will help the government \nto  (i)  undertake  sector  policy  reform  to  make  access  to  energy  sustainable  and  inclusive;  (ii) \nstrengthen  the  reach,  reliability,  and  efficiency  of  the  nation\u2019s  electricity  grid;  and  (iii)  enable \ngreater  use  of  clean  sources  of  primary  energy,  particularly  in  hydropower,  geothermal,  and \ngas-fired power generation. ADB will also provide TA for activities to expand energy efficiency, \ncarbon capture and storage (CCS), and access to electricity. These priorities align with ADB\u2019s \n2014  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020,  which  emphasizes  the  need  for  inclusive  economic \ngrowth, \nin  middle-income \ncountries.8 In addition, ADB plans private sector operations to support the expansion of liquefied \nnatural gas production in eastern Indonesia and other gas and renewable energy projects. \n\ninfrastructure  development,  and  policy-based  engagements \n\n \n12. \nThe  policy-based  loan approach  and  budget support. The program will help ensure \nthe  planned  increased  contribution  of  clean  energy  from  gas,  renewable  energy  and  energy \nefficiency  to  the  energy  mix  by  2025,  while  putting  in  place  measures  that  will  limit  the \nenvironmental impact of the country\u2019s growing fossil fuel reliance. \n \n13. \nA  programmatic  approach  will  be  pursued  through  three  subprograms  over  the  5-year \n2015\u20132019  medium-term  plan  period.  The  program  will  complement  and  underpin  ADB\u2019s \nproposed  project  loans  during  2015\u20132019  for  geothermal,  hydropower,  and  gas-fired  power \ngeneration projects, as well as results-based loans for strengthening the electricity grid that will \nuse  a  new  government  modality  providing  a  sovereign  guarantee  to  state-owned  enterprises \n(SOEs).  This  lending  program  and  ADB\u2019s  overall  energy  sector  strategy  are  also  designed  to \nsupport  PLN\u2019s  electricity  power  supply  business  plan  for  2015\u20132024,  which  calls  for  35 \ngigawatts  of  additional  capacity  to  be  installed  by  2019.9 To  support  these  objectives,  ADB \napproved  a  policy  and  advisory  TA  in  December  2014  for  targeted  policy  dialogue  and  to \nprepare the subsequent subprograms.10 The program represents a coordinated effort by several \ndevelopment partners to support the government\u2019s reform agenda.11 \n \n14. \nSubprogram 1 aims to lock in prerequisite enabling policies, such as those needed to set \ncost-reflective  tariffs  and    improve  regulatory  certainty  in  the  extension  of  gas  production-\nsharing  contracts.  In  some  cases,  it  will  also  carry  out  diagnostic  work  and  planning  to  guide \nsubsequent policy actions. The subsequent subprograms will then seek to implement measures \nto  further  improve  sector  governance,  expand  domestic  gas  production,  increase  the  use  of \nrenewable energy, establish an energy efficiency marketplace in the public and private sectors, \nexpand  inclusive  energy  access  by  streamlining  public  funding  and  expanding  private  sector \nparticipation,  and  scale  up  measures  to  lower  greenhouse  gas  emissions  from  fossil  fuel \noperations. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n15. \nThe  impact  will  be  greater  domestic  energy  security  and  an  increase  in  access  to \nmodern forms of energy. They reflect the objectives of the government\u2019s medium-term plan for \n2015\u20132019. The outcome will be increased power supply from sustainable and more accessible \nenergy  sources. This  will  be  measured through several  indicators,  including the  percentage of \n\n                                                \n8  ADB. 2014.

Other  indicator  targets  will  be  increases  in  the  percentage  of  renewable  energy  in  the \nelectricity generation mix from 6% in 2014 to 10% by 2020 and annual private sector investment \nin the oil and gas sector raised from $14 billion in 2014 to $18 billion in 2020.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n16. \nSubprogram  1  supports  the  government\u2019s  energy  sector  reform  agenda  to  achieve  the \nfollowing  outputs:  (i)  improved  sector  governance,  (ii)  the  enabling  of  markets  for  private \nparticipation,  and  (iii)  improved  regulatory  environment  for  expanding  access  to  clean  energy \nand energy efficiency. The government began undertaking reforms related to all three outputs in \nJune  2013,  and  all  17  policy  actions  (including  13  policy  triggers)  required  for  subprogram  1 \nhave been accomplished.12 \n \n\n1. \n\nOutput 1: Sector Governance Improved \n\nOutput 1 activities support government efforts to (i) adopt economic tariffs for fuels and \n\n17. \nelectricity, and (ii) improve the performance of public sector enterprises in the energy sector. \n \n18. \nCost-recovery-based  tariffs  for  fuels  and  electricity  adopted. In January  2015, the \ngovernment removed subsidies on gasoline and established a fixed per-liter subsidy scheme of \nRp1,000 ($0.08) for diesel. The retail fuel prices will be adjusted periodically by the Ministry of \nEnergy and Mineral Resources to reflect the global prices of the fuel products, including taxes. \nIn  the  case  of  electricity,  the  government  removed  subsidies  for  industrial,  commercial,  and \nlarge  residential  consumers  in  late  2014.  It  then  established  a  system  of  monthly  automatic \nprice  adjustments  for  these  consumers  in  early  2015  that  accounts  for  the  exchange  rate,  the \nIndonesian  crude  oil  price,  and  inflation.  The  government  has  started  these  price  increases.13 \nSubprograms  2  and  3  will  phase  in  price  adjustments  for  all  classes  of  consumers.  ADB  has \nsupported  the  government  in  this  effort  through  regional  benchmarking  of  the  fiscal  burden  of \nsubsidies and elaborating alternatives for phasing out subsidies. \n \n19. \nPerformance of public-sector enterprises in the energy sector improved. To try to \nimprove  the  efficiency  of  state-owned  energy  companies  and  regulate  them  based  on \nperformance, the government instituted service quality standards for PLN in 2014. Subprograms \n2 and 3 will establish an economic regulation for PLN and other SOEs in the energy sector. The \ngovernment is attempting to benchmark PLN\u2019s controllable costs for a 5-year tariff period. It will \nthen  seek  to  incentivize  it  to  improve  efficiency  by  allowing  it  to  keep  eventual  differences \nbetween allowed (regulatory) and actual costs of service provision as additional profit until the \nend of the tariff period. Subprograms 2 and 3 will also work to restructure energy sector SOEs \nalong regional lines or business divisions to allow for more efficient operations. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutput 2: Markets for Private Participation Enabled \n\n20. \nOutput  2  involves  support  for  government  efforts  (i)  to  increase  private  sector \nparticipation  in  the  electricity  business  by  streamlining  the  licensing  and  permitting  of  private \npower  projects  and  enabling  greater  private  sector  participation  in  the  electricity  transmission \n\n                                                \n12 Policy triggers are prior reforms that are to be completed as a prerequisite for the disbursement of loan proceeds. \n13 The government will phase in adjustments for 1,300 volt-ampere (VA) and 2,200 VA households in 2016. It is also \nworking on a road map for phasing in market prices (with direct cash transfer payments) for the 450 VA and 900 \nVA customers who are currently being subsidized. These actions are included in subprogram 2. Currently, of total \nelectricity sales, about 52% in kWh terms and 60% in revenue terms are unsubsidized. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nand  generation  business;  and  (ii)  to  promote  domestic  gas  production  and  an  increase  in  the \ndelivery of gas into the domestic market, in part through greater private sector involvement. \n \n21. \nIncreased  private  sector  participation  in  the  electricity  business  enabled.  During \nMarch\u2013May  2015,  the  government  delegated  the  licensing  and  permitting  of  private  power \nprojects  to  a  new  one-stop-shop  within  the  Indonesia  Investment  Coordinating  Board. \nRecognizing that this itself was not enough, the government also began streamlining regulations \nthat govern  project  permits to  reduce  approval times.14 In  addition,  while  a 2009  electricity  law \nhad  allowed  the  private  sector  to  access  PLN\u2019s  transmission  lines,  the  requisite  implementing \nregulations were not enacted until early 2015. The government has now established the basis \nfor wheeling arrangements that could allow private power producers to use PLN\u2019s transmission \nsystem  to  sell  power  directly  to  end  users  in  distant  locations.  Under  the  subsequent \nsubprograms, it will set up rates and settlement rules and the basis for cross-border trade. \n\n \n22. \nDomestic gas production and increased delivery of gas into the domestic market \npromoted. The government is keen to reverse the plateauing trend in domestic gas production \nby increasing investment in exploration and production and facilitating greater investment in the \npipelines,  liquefied  natural  gas  infrastructure,  and  fueling  stations  needed  to  make  greater \ndomestic use of the country\u2019s gas resources. It is currently preparing a new oil and gas law. It \nhas  also  addressed  delays  in  decision  making  on  expiring  production-sharing  contracts  that \nhave thwarted private sector interest in Indonesia\u2019s gas sector by imposing a transparent, time-\nbound  process  for  these  decisions.  ADB  provided  key  inputs  for  drafts  of  this  new  regulation \n(footnote 10). \n \n\n3. \n\nOutput  3:  Regulatory  Environment  for  Increased  Access  to  Clean  Energy \nand Energy Efficiency Improved \n\n23. \nActivities  under  output  3  aim  to  help  the  government  (i)  expand  generation  from \nindigenous forms of renewable energy that can offset fossil-fired generation and imports of oil, \n(ii)  improve  standards  and  policies  for  energy  efficiency,  (iii)  expand  access  to  electricity,  and \n(iv) minimize the environmental impacts from the use of fossil fuels. \n \nIncentives  for  renewable  energy  generation  established.  In  2014,  the  government \n24. \nrevised its law governing geothermal resources to reduce barriers to the large-scale deployment \nof geothermal energy. The obstacles were inadequate information on such resources, which led \nto  failed  tendering  for  projects;  and  a  lack  of  ownership  by  local  governments  due  to  the \nlopsided  prescribed  division  of revenue from  potential  projects  between  them  and  the  national \ngovernment. The government also issued an improved tariff scheme based on the principle of \navoided costs by region. ADB helped develop the basis for the new tariff scheme and continues \nto  support  work  in  related  areas.15 In  2014\u20132015,  the  government  established  tariff  incentives \nfor hydropower, biomass, and biogas projects with a capacity of less than 10 megawatts. Under \nsubprograms  2  and  3,  additional  incentives  for  new  renewable  energy  sources  such  as  wind \npower and solar photovoltaic will be enacted, and existing related regulations will be updated. \n\n \nStandards and policies for energy efficiency improved. The government reduction of \n25. \nelectricity  subsidies  and  rising  tariffs  are  expected  to  spur  increased  investments  in  energy \nefficiency  investments.  The government  issued  minimum  efficiency  performance  standards  for \nkey  household appliances (air  conditioners  and compact fluorescent  lamps)  and  established a \n\n                                                \n14 Key  regulations  that  have  been  amended  include  those  relating  to  acquiring  land  for  buildings,  land-use  permits \n\nwithin forestry areas, and jetty permits for water-based transport. \n15 ADB. 2015.

Manila. \n\n\f7 \n\nthese \n\nregulations. 16  Subsequent  subprograms  will  support \n\ngreen  building  code  that  includes  energy  efficiency  requirements.  ADB  is  helping  the \ngovernment  develop \nthe \nestablishment  of  energy  services  companies,  energy-efficient  building  codes,  and  a  national \nenergy-efficient street lighting program. \n \n26. \nAccess to electricity expanded. The government has begun creating a comprehensive \nregulatory framework to deploy public and private sources of finance for inclusive energy access. \nIt is preparing a national least-cost electrification road map and increasing budgetary resources \nfor  rural  electrification.  It  has  included  these  elements  in  its  new  national  energy  plan  to  be \nissued  in  2015  and  has  launched  a  pilot  activity  on  Sumba  Island  with  ADB\u2019s  support  to \nevaluate  innovative  financing  and  project  designs  and  a  multi-stakeholder  approach  for \nelectrification.17 Subsequent subprograms will lead to a national electrification program involving \nboth the public and private sectors. \n\n \n27. \nEnvironmental impacts of fossil-fueled generation minimized. The government has \nalso  recognized  the  need  to  minimize  carbon  emissions  from  fossil  fuel-based  activity.  It  has \nidentified  CCS  as  an  important  means  to  limiting  carbon  emissions  from  the  industrial  sector. \nSince  2012,  ADB  has  been  supporting  the  government  in  its  CCS  development  efforts.18 The \ngovernment will seek to establish regulations for CCS activity in the gas sector, scale up other \nclean fossil fuel  technologies,  and  develop  plans for  a  low  carbon future for the  energy  sector \nthrough pricing of carbon, participations in emission trading programs etc. \n \n28. \nTriggers for subprograms 2 and 3. Subprograms 2 and 3 have been designed to scale \nup  the  reforms  initiated  in  subprogram  1  in  a  flexible,  incremental  way.  The  government  and \nADB have agreed that subprograms 2 and 3 will include 37 indicative policy actions that are to \nbe  completed  by  the  end  of  the  program\u201422  under  subprogram  2  by  2017,  and  15  under \nsubprogram 3 by 2019. A medium-term framework, which includes anticipated achievements, is \nincluded in the policy matrix. \n \nD. \n \n29. \nTo  support  its  energy sector  reform  initiatives, the government  has requested  a single-\ntranche  loan  of  $400,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  (A-loan)  and  a  single \ntranche  loan  of  $100,000,000  funded  through  the  participation  of  AIF  (B-loan),  to  help finance \nsubprogram  1.  The  A-loan  will  have  a  15-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  a \nstraight-line  repayment  method,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15% \nper  year,  and such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in the  loan  agreement.  Based  on  this \narrangement, the average loan maturity is 9.25 years, and there is no maturity premium payable \nto  ADB.  The  B-loan  will  have  the  same  term  and  repayment  schedule  as  the  A-loan  and  an \ninterest rate  determined in accordance  with  the  LIBOR-based  lending facility.  The government \nhas  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nlending facility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices \nwere  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any  advice  from  ADB.  The \nproceeds  of  the  loans  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  cost  (excluding  local \ntaxes  and  duties)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\n                                                \n16 ADB. 2013.

The \nproceeds of the loans will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s simplification of disbursement \nprocedures  and  related  requirement  for  policy-based  loans. 19  Per  AIF  requirements,  the \nproceeds of the loans should be withdrawn concurrently. \n \n30. \nThe size of the program loan is based on (i) the importance of the sector to the economy \nand  the  program\u2019s  projected  benefits,  (ii)  the  need  to  conform  to  the  overall  financing \nrequirement  of  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan,  and (iii)  the  development  expenditure \nsupported  by  the  program.  Based  on  its  2015  revised  budget,  the  government\u2019s  net \ndevelopment financing  needs are  $40.6  billion  (deficit  plus debt  and non-debt  payments). The \ngovernment  is  required  to  restrict  its  budget  deficit  to  3%  of  gross  domestic  product. \nDevelopment  assistance  loans from  external  development  partners  are  expected  to  contribute \n$3.9 billion to this amount. With a larger deficit expected as a result of slower economic growth \nand continued volatility in the financial market, the government has requested additional budget \nfinancing to the tune of $3.6 billion, from development partners. For the program, in addition to \nADB\u2019s loan, development partners have confirmed their contribution of about the equivalent of \n$813 million in collaborative parallel financing (Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement of France\u2013\n$113 million equivalent, German development cooperation through KfW\u2013$200 million equivalent, \nand the World Bank\u2013$500 million). \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n31. \nThe  Coordinating  Ministry  for  Economic  Affairs  will  be  the  executing  agency.  This  will \nallow  for  inter-ministerial  cooperation  on  energy  sector  issues.  The  Ministry  of  Energy  and \nMineral Resources, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, and the \nIndonesia  Investment  Coordinating  Board  will  be  the  implementing  agencies.  The  executing \nagency  will  be  responsible  for  overall  program  implementation.  The  program  implementing \nagencies will be responsible for undertaking certain program-related actions. The Coordinating \nMinistry  for  Economic  Affairs  will  establish  a  program  management  unit  to  oversee  overall \nprogram  monitoring  and  reporting.  The  program  implementation  units  at  the  implementing \nagencies  will  report  to  the  program  management  unit  and  monitor  the  progress  on  the \nimplementation  of  reforms  within  their  agencies.  The  implementation  periods  are  June  2013\u2013\nSeptember  2015  for  subprogram  1,  October  2015\u2013September  2017  for  subprogram  2,  and \nOctober 2017\u2013September 2019 for subprogram 3. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n32. \nThe  program\u2019s  three  outputs  will  each  make  positive  macroeconomic  contributions. \nElectricity  tariffs  based  on  cost  recovery  will  lead  to  (i)  fiscal  savings  that  can  be  used  for \ninfrastructure  development  and  welfare  programs,  which  in  turn  will  have  multiplier  effects \nacross the economy; and (ii) stimulation of increased investment and capacity expansion in the \nelectricity  sector  that  will  directly  boost  gross  domestic  product.  Better  sector  governance  will \nimprove  efficiency  in  public  sector  energy  companies,  lower  borrowing  costs,  and  improve \nfinancial sustainability. Greater private sector investment in the energy sector will help increase \ndomestic  production  of  energy  and  lead  to  economy-wide  employment  benefits.  Finally,  by \nincreasing  access  to  clean  energy  from  renewable  energy  and  gas  in  Indonesia,  the  program \nwill  help  avoid  some  expansion  in  coal-fired  power  generation  and  the  emissions  of  air \npollutants  and  greenhouse  gases  that  these  plants  would  have  produced.  To  the  extent  that \n                                                \n19 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n\n\f9 \n\nGovernance \n\nclean energy will displace diesel generation, the program will also help save on oil imports and \nthe  country\u2019s  balance  of  payments.  Saving  energy  through  energy  efficiency  measures  will \nreduce  total  added  generation  capacity  needs  and  expand  access  to  energy  to  unserved \nsections of  the  population. The  program\u2019s  economic  benefits  will  average  $5.5  billion  per  year \nand  readily  exceed  its  annual  economic  costs  of  $3.3  billion.  The  program  is  expected  to  add \nmore than $113 billion to Indonesia\u2019s overall gross domestic product cumulatively by 2023.20 \n \nB. \n \n33. \nIndonesia  has  made  steady  progress  in  strengthening  its  public  financial  management \n(PFM).  The  Government  Financial  Management  and  Revenue  Administration  Project,  under \nimplementation  by  the  government  of  Indonesia  since  2004,  has  supported  reforms  aimed  at \nstrengthening efficiency, governance, and accountability in PFM. In addition, the government\u2019s \n2012 medium-term strategy note called for improving the oversight of PFM reforms designed to \nstrengthen  the  process  of  allocating  the  budget  resources  of  priority  sectors,  the  link  between \nplanning and budgeting, and the budget\u2019s results orientation. PFM reforms are also increasingly \naligned  with  the  priorities  identified  in  Indonesia\u2019s  2015\u20132019  medium-term  development  plan \n(footnote 5). The majority of SOEs are fully owned by the government, and SOE operations are \nlinked to the government budget because many receive significant subsidies. The government \nalso  monitors  the  performance  of  SOEs  due  to  the  potential  fiscal  risks  they  represent. 21  \nTechnical assistance provided by ADB to review the country\u2019s energy sector-wide procurement \nsystem  found  SOEs  in  the  energy  sector  to  have  satisfactory  institutional  frameworks, \nmanagement  capacity,  procurement  operations,  and  market  practices.22 ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n34. \nThe  reforms  supported  under  the  program  will  increase  access  to  modern  forms  of \nenergy,  stimulate  economic  growth,  and  help  create  jobs,  all  of  which  are  key  elements  in \nreducing poverty. The program is classified as a general intervention, since its proposed outputs \nwill  benefit  all  citizens,  including  the  poor  and  vulnerable.  In  the  case  of  tariff  increases,  low-\nincome  households  will  have  access  to  direct  cash  transfers.  The  third  output  will  have \nparticularly positive impacts on the poor by increasing their access to energy. This will stimulate \nrural and peri-urban small businesses and create jobs; add value within the agriculture, fishing, \nand forestry sectors; and reduce household exposure to the indoor air pollution that comes from \nburning  biomass  for  heat  and  cooking.  Subprogram  1  is  classified  as  having  no  gender \nelements. Better access to energy will benefit women along with the population at large.23 \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\nThe program has been classified as category B for environment and category C for both \n35. \ninvoluntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  people.  The  envisaged  reforms  will  not  entail \ninvoluntary  land  acquisition  or  activities  in  indigenous  peoples\u2019  areas.  Any  potential  indirect \nsocial and environmental impacts arising from increased investment in the energy sector will be \nevaluated  on  a  project-by-project  basis  as  required  by  Indonesia\u2019s  environmental  and  land \n                                                \n20 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Government  of  Indonesia  and  Development  Partners.  2012.

The \ngovernment has the institutional capacity and commitment to manage these impacts.24 \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n36. \nThe main risks to the program\u2019s success arise from the potential for (i) macroeconomic \ninstability,  (ii)  a  lack  of  coordination  in  policy  formulation  and  project  implementation,  and  (iii) \nregulatory  backsliding  and  resistance within the legislative process  to increased  private  sector \nparticipation  in  the  energy  sector.  These  and  the  other  pertinent  risks  are  categorized  as \nmedium and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.25 Mitigation \nmeasures  taken  include  TA  to  support  improved  coordination  and  support  the  design  of \nregulations  and  policies  that  are  well-aligned  with  government  priorities  and  tenets  of  the \nconstitution.  The  program\u2019s  overall  risk  level  is  considered  to  be  medium,  and  its  benefits \noutweigh its costs.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITION \n\n37. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of program shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting services,  and  disbursement as described in detail  in the  loan \nagreement.  No  disbursement  shall  be  made  unless  ADB  is  satisfied  that  the  government  has \ncompleted the policy actions specified in the policy matrix relating to the program. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n38. \nI am satisfied that the proposed programmatic approach and policy-based loans would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend \nthat the Board approve \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthe programmatic approach for the Sustainable and Inclusive Energy Program; \nthe  A-loan  of  $400,000,000  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  subprogram  1  of \nSustainable  and  Inclusive  Energy  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  for  a  term  of  15  years,  including  a \ngrace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially \nin  accordance  with those  set  forth  in the  draft  loan  agreement  presented  to  the \nBoard; and \nthe B-loan of $100,000,000 to the Republic of Indonesia for the Sustainable and \nInclusive  Energy  Program  to  be  funded through  the  participation  of  the  ASEAN \nInfrastructure  Fund  on  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n\n \n \n\n8 September 2015 \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n\n                                                \n24 Environmental and Social Impact Assessment of the Policy Matrix (accessible from the list of linked documents in \n\nAppendix 2).  \n\n25 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \nImpacts the Program is Aligned with \n \nIncreased domestic energy security and access to modern forms of energy (National Medium-Term \nDevelopment Plan, 2015\u20132019)a \n\n \n\nResults Chain  \nOutcome \nSupply from \nsustainable and \nmore accessible \nenergy options \nincreased \n\nOutputs \n1.
