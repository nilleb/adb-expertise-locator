An initial environmental examination was undertaken.  \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  credit  and  training  to  about  66,000  farm \nhouseholds  in  26  counties  of  five  municipalities  in  central  and  southern \nShanxi.  Of  these,  11  are  poverty  counties  and  12  are  on  the  priority  list \nfor  treatment  of  accelerated  soil  erosion  in  the  PRC.  The  Project \ncomprises four components (i) transition to high-value farm production by \nadopting \nthat  ensure  environmental \nsustainability and increase farm income; (ii) strengthening of farm\u2013market \nlinkages  by  supporting  on-farm  and  industrial  agroprocessing  and \nmarketing  of  high-value  products;  (iii)  capacity-building  and  training  of \nfarmers,  farmer  associations,  and  technical  support  agencies  to  support \nhigh-value  production  and  processing  of  farm  products;  and  (iv)  project \nmanagement to support efficient project implementation. To keep project \nimplementation manageable, each participating county will take up two of \nthe three activities in the first component\u2014perennial crops, annual crops, \nand  livestock.  Structured  criteria  were  used  to  select  project  counties, \nsites, and activities. \n \nMost project counties have a variety of  marketing channels with varying \ndegrees  of  efficiency.  Under  the  Project,  the  participating  farmers  will \nmake the transition to high-value production systems and connect to the \nvalue chain for the first time. By involving 24 agro-enterprises, the Project \nwill  support  beneficiary  households  to  establish  production  bases, \nexpand  their  on-farm  processing  capacity,  and  connect  with  agro-\nenterprises through formal contractual arrangements. Participating agro-\nenterprises  will  provide  subloan  guarantees  to  contracted  farmers.  To \nminimize  postharvest  losses  and  improve  storage-life,  the  Project  will \nsupport  on-farm  processing  and  farmer-managed  drying  rooms.  Five \nagro-enterprises  will  receive  credit  to  increase  storage  capacity  and \nprocessing operations.   \n \nThe Project will build the capacity of farmers, their associations, and staff \nof \nto  adopt  high-value  and \nenvironmentally sustainable production systems that will increase farmer \nincomes  and  farm  productivity,  and  improve  food  safety  and  quality. \nADB's  Multi-Donor  Trust  Fund  under  the  Water  Financing  Partnership \nFacility  (WFPF)  and  the  Gender  and  Development  Cooperation  Fund \n(GDCF) will provide grants to pilot-test creative interventions. The WFPF-\nfunded  activities  will  demonstrate  the  viability  of  more  productive  and \n\ntechnical  support  agencies \n\n(TSAs) \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nis  unsustainable  and  damaging \n\nefficient  irrigation  techniques,  and  support  farmers  to  adapt  to  climate \nchange  impacts.  Poor  farmers  will  be  provided  with  subsidies  to  adopt \nwater-saving  technologies  to  showcase  the  efficiency  and  economic \nbenefits  of  such  interventions.  Skills  training  will  help  farmers  reduce \ndependence  on  increasingly  scarce  water  resources.  The  GDCF  grant \nwill  facilitate  women\u2019s  economic  empowerment  by  (i)  setting  up  a \nrevolving  fund  for  microfinance;  (ii)  organizing  self-help  groups  linked  to \nexisting farmer associations to access markets; (iii) providing training on \ntechnical,  marketing,  alternative \nincome-generation  activities,  and \nleadership;  and  (iv)  building  capacity  to  ensure  sustainability  of  these \nactivities. \n \nShanxi has only about 3.8 million hectares of dependable arable land\u2014of \nmodest  quality  and  productivity\u2014for  its  23 million  rural  population.  Low \nrainfall, high evaporation, frequent natural disasters, and soil erosion lead \nto  instability  in  agricultural  production.  After  about  30  years  of  reforms, \nthe agricultural service system, farmers' technical capacity, and women\u2019s \neconomic participation have improved. However, the nature of extensive \nand scattered small-scale agriculture has not changed significantly. Most \nfarmers continue to practice traditional agriculture mainly growing wheat \nand maize that generate low incomes and require extensive use of water \nand agrochemicals. Similarly, the patterns of free-range livestock grazing \nand untreated disposal of animal waste adds to soil and water pollution. \nThis  agricultural  system \nthe \nenvironment,  and  keeps  most  farmers  in  poverty.  Most  farmers  also \nremain largely unorganized and cannot take full advantage of market and \nrural  finance  opportunities.  In  addition,  women\u2019s  participation  remains \nmarginal, and their social and economic rights are usually ignored.  \n \nOne of the main constraints to converting traditional farming to high-value \nfarming  is  access  to  formal  credit.  The  agricultural  lending  institutions \nhave (i) a limited range of products, (ii) inadequate experience with long-\nterm  lending,  and  (iii)  weak  capacity  to  assess  credit  risk.  These \nconstraints, coupled with the absence of market-led interest rates, lead to \nmarket failure, and the inability of agro-enterprises and farmers to access \nformal financial services. \n \nThe Project will address these constraints and provide financing for high-\nvalue \nsafety, \nenvironmentally  sustainable  farm  practices  by  adopting  water-saving \nirrigation \nimproved \ncapacity  of  farmers  and  TSAs.  These  initiatives  are  consistent  with  the \nGovernment's 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010) and ADB's PRC country \npartnership strategy, 2008\u20132010. \n \nThe  anticipated  project  impact  is  reduced  rural  poverty  and  the \ndevelopment  of  sustainable  agriculture  sector  in  26  counties  of  Shanxi. \nThe  project  outcome  will  be  increased  farm  productivity  and  higher \nhousehold  income  resulting  from  high-value  agricultural  production  by \nadopting  appropriate  and  environmentally  sound  technologies  and \npractices, value addition through processing, efficient market access, and \nimproved food quality and safety in the project area. \n \n\ntechniques,  microfinance \n\nto  poor  women,  and \n\nagroprocessing, \n\nfarming, \n\nproduct \n\nquality \n\nand \n\nto \n\n \nRationale \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nImpact and \nOutcome \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nProject Investment \nPlan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \nAllocation and \nRelending Terms \n\n \n\niii\n\nfinancial  charges  during \n\nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $189.3  million, \ntaxes  and  duties  of  $17.6  million,  contingencies  of \nincluding \n$0.8  million,  and \nimplementation  of \n$1.3 million. \n \nA  loan  of  $100,000,000,  about  52.8%  of  the  total  cost,  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources will be provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility.

The  MFBs  will  make \nloan proceeds available to the respective county finance bureaus (CFBs). \nThe  CFBs  in  participating  counties  will  extend  subloans,  from    the  ADB \nloan  funds,  to  final  borrowers,  subject  to  approvals  by  appropriate \nauthorities under subloan agreements. The terms and conditions for the \nloan  proceeds  transferred  from  the  Government  to  SFD  and  the  MFBs \nand CFBs will be the same as those applied to ADB loan, with SPG and \nCFBs bearing the foreign exchange and credit risks, respectively, for the \nloan  proceeds  made  available  to  them.  Terms  and  conditions  of  the \nsubloans  will  include  (i)  the  interest  rate  will  not  be  lower  than  the \nprevailing commercial rate of interest for equivalent types of loans; (ii) the \nrepayment  period  will  be  based  on  the  cash  flow  of  the  subborrower's \nprojected future revenue, including a grace period not exceeding that of \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nPeriod of \nUtilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nthe  ADB  loan;  and  (iii)  if  the  subborrower  is  an  agro-enterprise,  the \nsubborrower  will  bear  the  foreign  exchange  and  interest  rate  variation \nrisks.

The  PMO  will  coordinate  and  oversee \nimplementation  of  all  activities  on  a  day-to-day  basis.  The  PMO  will  (i) \nin  project \norganize,  coordinate,  and  guide \nmunicipalities and counties for effective implementation of the Project; (ii) \nprepare an annual work program and budget; (iii) organize procurement; \n(iv)  maintain  consolidated  accounts,  including  developing  a  project \nperformance  management  system  to  track  all  financial  transactions  with \nsubborrowers;  (v)  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  withdrawal  applications \nand  statements  of  expenditure  through  SFD;  (vi)  monitor  physical  and \nfinancial  progress,  including  benefits  flow  to  intended  beneficiaries,  and \nsubmit  reports  to  SPG  and  ADB;  and  (vii)  liaise  with  SPG  through  SFD \nfor reporting to the Ministry of Finance and ADB.  \n \nThe  municipal  and  county  project  implementation  units  (PIUs),  one  in \neach of the five municipalities and 26 counties, will assist the PMO. The \nunits  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  implementation  of  all  project \nactivities  under  the  overall  guidance  of  the  PMO.  The  provincial \nenvironmental  protection  bureaus  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring \ncompliance with national environmental standards, rules, and regulations. \nThe  CFBs,  as  implementing  agencies  for  the  five  agro-enterprises,  will \nsupervise \nfinancing  and  monitoring  activities.

Of the 26 project counties, 11 are classified as poor, \nand  6  of  the  11  are  national  priority  poverty  counties.  In  all  project \ncounties,  households  considered  as  poor  by  national  and  provincial \nstandards  will  participate  in  the  Project.  Over  66,000  beneficiaries, \nincluding  about  40,000  \u201cabsolute  poor\u201d  and  26,000  \u201clow-income\u201d \nhouseholds,  will  be  supported  by  the  Project.  The  Project  will  pay \nparticular  attention  to  households  headed  by  women,  identified  as \nvulnerable.  The  average  annual  household  incomes  is  expected  to \nincrease  by  30%,  or  about  CNY6,000.  The  \u201cabsolute  poor\u201d  households \n(with  a  per  capita  annual  income  of  less  than  CNY1,000)  can  expect  to \ndouble  their  income.  Higher  incomes  coupled  with  increased  production \ncapacity  and  enhanced  technical  skills  will  allow  vulnerable  poor \nhouseholds to move and stay out of poverty. \n \nFinancial  internal  rates  of  return  for  all  types  of  investments  range  from \n15%  to  20%,  and  are  above  the  estimated  weighted  average  cost  of \ncapital which is about 5.1%. The overall economic internal rate of return \nof the Project is estimated to be 19.5%. The sensitivity analysis indicates \nthat  the  Project  is  robust  with  respect  to  declines  in  net  incremental \nbenefits and rise in costs from individual activities. \n \n\n \n\nConsulting \nServices \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\nRisks and \nAssumptions \n \n\n \n\nIn \n\nthe \n\nthe  Project. \n\nAt the macro level, the principal risks to attaining project objectives relate \nfor  private  sector  agricultural  production  and \nto  stable  policies \nprocessing,  sustainable  agricultural  development,  and  poverty  reduction \nin rural areas. The financial sector's failure to provide investment capital \nto  farmers  and  agro-enterprises  is  being  addressed  in  the  short-term \nlong-term,  sustainable  agricultural \nthrough \ndevelopment  will  be  constrained  unless  requisite  policy  and  financial \nsector  reforms  are  carried  out.  At  the  project  level,  the  ability  and \nwillingness  of  beneficiaries \nto  market  signals  and \nopportunities  will  be  critical  to  its  success.  This  risk  will  be  mitigated \nthrough  farmer  training,  particularly  to  develop  effective  farmer\u2013market \nlinkages.  The  involvement  of  24  agro-enterprises  in  the  Project  will  be \ninstrumental  in  mitigating  market  risk.  Risks  relating  to  the  marketing  of \nfresh and processed products are minimal, given the strong domestic and \nglobal  demand  and  price  competitiveness  of  the  PRC's  agricultural \nproducts.  The  technical  risk  in  production  activities  is  limited,  as  the \nparticipating  farmers  have  some  prior  experience  in  growing/raising  the \nplanned  crops/livestock.  Farmers  will  also  be  able  to  adopt  new \ntechnologies and cropping practices with support from advisory services \nand training. \n\nrespond \n\nto \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f40  00'No\n\nI N N E R     M O N G O L I A\n\n40  00'No\n\no\n111  00'E\n\n114  00'Eo\n\nSHANXI INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL\nDEVELOPMENT PROJECT\nIN THE\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\nDatong\n\nYouyu Qiaocun\n\nShuozhou\n\nShenchi\n\nSanggan River\n\nFanshi\n\nYanggao\n\nLingqiu\n\nS H A A N X I\n\nBaode\n\nw River)\n(Yello\nH uang H e\n\nKelan\n\nYuanping\n\nJingle\nS H A N X I\n\nGujiao\n\nTAIYUAN\n\nXinghou\n\nShouyang\n\nYangquan\n\nYuchi\n\nYUCHI\n\nJIAOCHENG\n\nLishi\n\nLISHI\n\nFenyang\n\nWENSHUI\n\nTaigu\n\nTAIGU\n\nLIULIN\n\nMucun\n\nZHONGYANG\n\nXiaoyi\n\nWutong\n\nJIAOKOU\n\nQi Xian\n\nQI XIAN\n\nPINGYAO\nPingyao\n\nQin Xian\n\nYushe\n\nZuoquan\n\nYONGHE\n\nXIXIAN\n\nDANING\n\nFENXI\n\nHuozhou\n\nPu Xian\n\nQinyuan\n\nQIN XIAN\n\nLICHENG\n\nLicheng\n\nLucheng\n\nHONGDONG\n\nTunilu\n\nPINGSHUN\n\nPingshun\n\nChangzhi\n\nr\ne\nv\ni\n\nn R\ne\nF\n\nLinfen\n\nXIANGFEN\n\nJinshan\n\nJINSHAN\n\nHouma\n\nWANRONG\n\nLINYI\n\nYANHU\n\nYunchen\n\nYONGJI\n\nYongji\n\nH E N A N\n\nH E B E I\n\nN\n\n50\n\nKilometers\n\nProject County\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nNational Road\n\nProvincial Road\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\nCounty Boundary\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\n36  00'No\n\n36  00'No\n\nJincheng\n\n0\n\n100\n\no\n111  00'E\n\n114  00'Eo\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\n09-0989 HR\n\n\f         \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nloan, and (ii) proposed administration of grants to be provided by the Multi-Donor Trust Funds \nunder  the  Water  Financing  Partnership  Facility  (WFPF)1  and  the  Gender  and  Development \nCooperation Fund (GDCF)2 to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Shanxi Integrated \nAgricultural Development Project.

The  Yellow  River  forms  the  western  and  southern \nborders  of  the  province.  The  fertile  Fen  River  valley,  centrally  located  in  the  Taiyuan  basin,  is \nthe  economic  hub  of  the  province.  Shanxi  products  have  ready  access  to  markets  due  to  the \nprovince\u2019s  location  in  the  PRC.  Shanxi  has  an  area  of  about  156,000  square  kilometers  (km2) \nand  a  population  of  about  34  million  (2006  estimate).  It  has  119  counties,  57  of  which  are \nclassified  as  poor.  Of  these  57  poverty  counties,  35  are  national  priority  poverty  counties  as \ndetermined  by  the  State  Council.5  In  2008,  the  average  annual  per  capita  income  was \nCNY2,164 in 35 counties and CNY2,552 in 57 counties; the provincial average was CNY3,666. \nThe disparity between urban and rural incomes is wide. In 2008, the average annual per capita \nurban income was more than triple (CNY13,119) that of rural income (CNY4,097).  \n \n4. \nShanxi  is  richly  endowed  with  natural  resources,  especially  coal,  coal-bed  methane, \nbauxite,  refractory  clay,  pearlite,  and  gallium.  It  is  the  largest  coal-producing  province  in  the \nPRC, mining over 25% of the country's annual total of 2.5 billion tons. Despite limited cultivable \nland, the agriculture sector has retained its place as the major source of employment, engaging \nabout  6.4  million  people  in  2006,  the  highest  among  all  sectors.6  In  about  30  years  of  reform, \nsignificant  progress  has  been  made  in  agricultural  input  supply,  processing,  transportation, \nindustrial production, and production bases. The agricultural service system, farmers\u2019 production \ncapacity,  and  women\u2019s  economic  participation  have  also  improved.  However,  the  nature  of \n\n                                                 \n1  Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, and Spain. \n2  Contributors: the governments of Canada, Denmark, Ireland, and Norway. \n3  ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Preparing the Central and Southern Shanxi \n\nIntegrated Agricultural Development Project. Manila.  \n\n4  The loess plateau is the highland area in north-central PRC, covering much of Shanxi, northern Henan, Shaanxi, \nand  eastern  Gansu  provinces  (the  middle  part  of  the  Yellow  River  basin).  Averaging  about  1,200  meters  in \nelevation and covering some 400,000 square kilometers, it is the world's largest loess plateau. The loess plateau is \nparticularly susceptible to erosion by water. \n\n5   In  2007,  the  PRC\u2019s  national  priority  poverty  county  list  was  based  on  a  standard  that  identified  a  person  as \n\u201cabsolute  poor\u201d  if  annual  per  capita  income  was  below  CNY786,  and  as  \u201clow-income\u201d  if  less  than  CNY1,067.  In \n2008, these two categories were merged to have a unified poverty line set at CNY1,196/capita/year. These poverty \nlines  are  much  lower  than  the  international  standard  of  $1.25/capita/day,  which  is  currently  equivalent  to  about \nCNY3,200/capita/year.    \n\n6   National Bureau of Statistics. 2008.

The  majority  of \nfarmers  practice  traditional  agriculture  mainly  growing  wheat  and  maize,  which  generate  low \nincomes  per  unit  of  land  and  require  extensive  use  of  agrochemicals  and  irrigation  water. \nSimilarly,  the  practice  of  free-range  livestock  grazing  and  untreated  disposal  of  animal  waste \nadds to soil and water pollution. This agricultural system has almost no potential to help most \nfarmers out of the poverty trap. Most farmers also remain largely unorganized and cannot take \nfull  advantage  of  market  and  rural \nfarmer  cooperatives, \nassociations, and other rural economic organizations have recently emerged.7 However, these \ndevelopments are inadequate for building modern agriculture. In addition, women\u2019s participation \nremains marginal, and their social and economic rights are usually ignored.  \n \n5. \nDuring 2007\u20132008, surging inflation in the PRC was due mainly to rising food prices. In \nFebruary 2008, according to the Bureau of Statistics, inflation was 8.7%\u2014the highest since May \n1996. The price of pork rose 63%, fresh vegetables 46%, and cooking oil 41% compared with \nFebruary 2007. Rising urban incomes and international commodity prices, severe weather, and \nconversion of food crops to biofuel significantly increased demand for food in the PRC and the \nrest  of  the  world.  The  world\u2019s  food  stocks  were  the  lowest  they  had  been  in  the  last  30  years \nand international food commodity prices rose 40%\u201380% within 2 years culminating in the food \ncrisis  in  2008.  As  the  global  financial  crisis  accelerated  in  late  2008,  the  inflationary  pressure \neased  but  large-scale  industrial  layoffs  in  the  southern  provinces  sent  over  20  million  migrant \nworkers back to the rural areas. Many of Shanxi's migrant workers returned home in late 2008. \nAll  these  factors  have  put  added  pressure  on  agricultural  production  systems  to  ensure  food \nsecurity  and  environmental  sustainability  in  the  PRC  and  especially  in  Shanxi  where  land  and \nwater resources are scarce. \n \n6. \nTo address the widening income gap between rural and urban areas, and between the \neastern,  central,  and  western  regions  of  the  country,  the  Government  has  planned  significant \ninvestments including replacing grain production with high-value crops and livestock to increase \nrural  incomes,  reduce  poverty,  and  mitigate  adverse  environmental  impacts  on  soil  and  water \nresources.  Along  with  promoting  the  transition  to  modern  and  high-value  production  systems, \ntechnical  services,  processing,  and  marketing  will  be  carried  out  by  private  agro-enterprises. \nThis approach is fully consistent with the PRC\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010), which calls \nfor sustainable crop production, diversification, water conservation, environmental management, \nand economic growth. To mitigate the effects of lost jobs in the industry sector and stimulate the \nslowing  economy  due  to  the  global  financial  crisis,  the  Government  has  embarked  on  an \nambitious $585 billion stimulus plan. In part, this plan will generate demand in rural areas and \ncreate jobs, especially in small and medium-sized enterprises, including agro-enterprises.  \n \nB. \n \nLimited and Deteriorating Resource Base.  Shanxi has only 3.8 million hectares (ha) \n7. \nof arable land\u2014of modest quality and productivity\u2014for its 23 million rural population. Located on \nthe Loess Plateau, more than 60% of the total land area is vulnerable to erosion. On average, \nthe  erosion  rate  is  3,000  ton/km2.  In  addition  to  the  inherent  low  fertility  of  loess  soils,  other \nenvironmental problems are caused by (i) the declining organic matter content of soils because \nof  inappropriate  cultivation  practices  leaving  soils  susceptible  to  rain  and  wind  erosion, \n(ii) overuse  of  fertilizers  and  pesticides,  (iii)  alkaline  wastelands,  and  (iv)  damage  from \nwindborne dust from coal mining. Low rainfall, high evaporation, and frequent natural disasters \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n                                                 \n7   The Government promulgated a law on farmers' specialized cooperatives in July 2007. The law is one of several \npolicies  related  to  agriculture  sector  development  that  stipulate  requirements  and  support  instruments  for  the \ncreation and development of farmer associations.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nlead  to  instability  in  agricultural  production.  From  1997  to  2007,  arable  land  was  reduced  by \nmore  than  604,000  ha  due  to  rapid  infrastructure  developments  and  conversion  of  land  from \nfarming  to  forestry,  grassland,  and  orchards.  About  241,000  ha  are  on  slopes  with  gradients \nmore than 25 degrees, where only perennial crops, soil-binding trees, and shrubs are permitted. \n \n8. \nAcross  the  province,  shortages  of  water  (13%  of  the  PRC  average)  arise  from  low \naverage  annual  rainfall  (400\u2013650  millimeters)  concentrated  in  July\u2013September  and  high \nevaporation  rates.  Water  resources  in  Shanxi  have  been  declining  since  1956.  From  2000  to \n2007, water availability decreased by 5% annually; from 8.2 billion cubic meters (m3) to about \n7.0 billion m3. The proportion of water available for irrigation decreased from 95% in the 1950s \nto 59% in 2007. A low water utilization rate, due to severe waste, is another factor contributing \nto  reduced  water  availability.  Flood  irrigation  is  the  most  common  practice.  On  average,  \n3,500  m3  of  water  is  used  to  irrigate  1  ha,  which  is  3\u20137  times  more  water  than  used  in  drip \nirrigation and other water-saving methods. Water pollution is another source of land degradation \ncaused by discharge of contaminants, indiscriminate use of agrochemicals, and nondegradable \nagricultural waste such as plastic mulch. The utilization ratio of nitrogenous fertilizers is around \n30%, which is 20% lower than most industrialized countries. Water quality in rivers is severely \npolluted, and more than 1,000 villages have difficulty securing good quality water. Groundwater \ncontamination has been exacerbated by the extensive use of chemical fertilizers and leaching of \nanimal waste. The potential climate change impact can further aggravate the already precarious \navailability of water resources in Shanxi. \n \n9. \nHigh-density coal mining is another major cause of land degradation. Coal waste cover \nhas reduced average crop productivity by about 250 kilograms/ha, causing a production loss of \nmore  than  6.7  million  tons/year.  Coal  mining  is  also  rapidly  reducing  water  resources  in  the \nprovince. It takes 2.48 m3 of water to process 1 ton of coal. To maintain current coal mining at \nabout 600 million tons/year, about 1.5 billion m3 of water, or one fifth of the total water resources \nin the province, are required. Since 1999, more than 26,000 ha of potentially irrigable land have \nbecome  dry  because  of  coal  mining.  The  consequent  annual  economic  loss  caused  by  coal \nmining is estimated to be $675 million (CNY4.6 billion); about 2.8% of Shanxi's gross domestic \nproduct. A detailed sector analysis is provided in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \nAgricultural  and  Environmental  Sustainability.  In  Shanxi,  the  environment  places \n10. \nserious  limitations  on  agricultural  development  due  to  low  rainfall,  variable  elevation,  soil \nerosion, and degradation caused in part by overuse and poor management. Recent attempts at \nimproving  environmental  conditions  have  led  to  significant  and  visible  development,  i.e.,  tree \nand  vegetation  cover  on  hills,  along  roadsides,  and  in  urban  areas.  Improvement  in  coal \nproduction technology and closure of older mines has led to reduced pollution at many sites. \n \n11. \nThe  topography  and  consequent  climatic  variability  in  Shanxi  provide  an  appropriate \nenvironment  for  diversified  agricultural  production,  using  modern  and  environmentally  neutral \ntechnologies. These include cultivation of perennial crops on terraced slopes over 25 degrees, \ndecreasing the use of chemical fertilizers with organic manure and of pesticides with integrated \npest  management  (IPM),  water  conservation,  adoption  of  cleaner  production  technologies  in \ncoal  mining  to  reduce  water  pollution,  rotational  grazing,  stall  feeding  for  livestock  production, \nand  similar  practices.  Many  farmers  and  agro-enterprises,  through  collaboration  in  production \nbases,  already  have  some  experience  in  environmentally  sustainable  production  of  livestock, \ncrops, and vegetables. Some agro-enterprises either have in-house capacity or engage skilled \nstaff  from  qualified  institutions  to  assist  farmers  in  producing  high-value  vegetables  safe  from \nresidual  effects  of  pesticides  as  well  as  certified  livestock  products.  Since  higher  quality  farm \nproducts  are  priced  at  a  premium,  potential  exists  for  expansion  of  these  production \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n          \n\ntechnologies  and  practices  to  farmers  on  a  wider  scale.  This  requires  technical  support  from \nvarious  government  institutions  and  agencies,  many  of  which  require  capacity-building  to  fully \nrespond to the needs of farmers.  \n \nRealization  of  Market  Opportunities.  The  PRC  is  the  world\u2019s  largest  producer  of \n12. \ncereals, vegetables, fruits, eggs, meat, and aquatic products. It is also one of the world\u2019s largest \nconsumers of food, including meat products. The PRC's annual consumption accounts for 51% \nof the global production of pork, 33% of rice, 19% of poultry, and 12% of beef. Though just 30% \nof the food consumed is currently processed, compared with 80% in industrialized countries, the \nmarket for processed foods is growing rapidly, especially in urban areas. Urbanization and rising \ndisposable  incomes  have  brought  about  significant  increases  in  demand  for  agricultural \nproducts,  and  a  shift  in  demand  to  a  wider  range  of  higher  quality  and  safer  produce  and \nprocessed products.  \n \n13. \nFor  many  food  products  (particularly  processed  fruits,  vegetables,  and  meat  products), \nShanxi  is  a  net  importer  from  other  provinces.  However,  the  province  has  outperformed  the \nPRC as a whole in export growth in a number of niche markets. Exports of apple products from \nShanxi have grown dramatically, increasing from 32,540 tons in 2003 to more than 85,000 tons \nin  2007, an average  annual  growth  rate  of  36%.  By  comparison,  PRC  exports  of  fresh  apples \n(the  predominant  fruit  export)  grew  by  9.7%  from  609,045  tons  to  804,226  tons  in  the  same \nperiod. The PRC's apple exports are projected to grow to over 943,000 tons by 2015 (an annual \naverage  growth  rate  of  3.8%).  With  the  development  of  rural  infrastructure,  and  production  of \nhigh-quality  apples,  the  international  competitiveness  of  the  PRC's  fresh  and  processed  apple \nproducts  will  be  strengthened,  providing  an  opportunity  for  continued  expansion  in  production \nand export.  \n \n14. \nThe  realization  of  these  opportunities  will  depend  to  a  large  extent  on  the  ability  of \nShanxi  farmers  to  make  the  transition  to  producing  high-value  and  safe  food  products.  The \ninappropriate  use  of  agrochemicals  can  adversely  affect  the  quality  of  produce  sold  to  agro-\nenterprises for processing and export to international markets, where demand for raw material \ntraceability is gaining momentum both to ensure food safety and reduce adverse environmental \nimpacts. A number of food shipments from the PRC were refused entry into the United States in \nthe first half of 2007, and several frozen foodstuffs were removed from supermarket shelves in \nJapan in January 2008 following the discovery of traces of banned insecticides. In August 2008, \nmelamine-tainted  milk  made \ninfants  sick  and  several  died  of \ncomplications.  Later,  melamine  was  also  traced  to  animal  feed  and  eggs.  As  a  result, \nindustrialized  countries  are  paying  greater  attention  to  the  quality  and  safety  of  food  imports \nfrom  the  PRC.  The  Government  has  declared  food  safety  its  high  priority.  To  address  these \nconcerns and promote good agricultural practices (GAP), the PRC has initiated the ChinaGAP \nprogram,  which  will  eventually  match  standards  set  for  certified  producers  supplying \ninternational  markets  (GlobalGAP).  For  export  markets,  compliance  with  the  World  Trade \nOrganization standards is critical.8 While higher costs are associated with meeting the needs of \nincreasingly  discerning  domestic  and  international  consumers,  an  equally  significant  potential \nprice  premium  can  be  earned  by  Shanxi  farmers  and  agro-enterprises  prepared  to  make  the \nrequisite investments in upgrading their processing technology. More detailed farm investment \nand income analysis is provided in Supplementary Appendix B. \n\nthousands  of  Chinese \n\n15. \nLimited  Access  to  Rural  Finance.  One  of  the  main  constraints  to  the  transition  from \ntraditional agriculture to high-value farming in the PRC generally, and in Shanxi particularly, is \n                                                 \n8  This  will  also  comply  with  international  standards  already  achieved  by  agro-enterprises  through  hazard  analysis \n\nand critical control point and International Standards Organization (ISO) certification. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\naccess  to  credit.  The  agricultural  lending  institutions  have  (i)  a  limited  range  of  financial \nproducts,  (ii)  inadequate  experience  with  long-term  lending,  (iii)  weak  capacity  to  effectively \nassess credit risk and adjust products and services accordingly, and (iv) issues with land tenure \nand fixed asset valuation that prevent effective loan collateralization. These constraints, coupled \nwith the absence of market-led interest rates, have led to market failure. \n \n16. \nFarmers (especially women) and small businesses have limited access to formal credit. \nMost  farm  expenditures  are  financed  by  farmers'  savings,  and  most  loans  are  obtained  from \ninformal sources (e.g., relatives, friends, money lenders, and pawnbrokers). The small size and \nshort-term  nature  of  these  loans  precludes  investment  in  assets  that  have  a  long  payback \nperiod.  Also,  lending  by  state-owned  commercial  banks  and  credit  cooperatives  is  still  largely \nguided  by  government  policy  that  fixes  the  interest  rate  financial  institutions  can  charge.  On \naverage, only a third of rural households have access to formal sources of credit. The failure of \nthe  financial  sector  to  support  agriculture  and  agribusiness  development  means  that  market \nopportunities\u2014and  the  associated  adoption  of  economically  and  environmentally  sustainable \nagricultural  production  systems\u2014are  not  being  realized.  Unless  this  financing  gap  is  filled, \nfarmers  and  agro-enterprises  risk  losing  their  share  in  international  markets  in  the  face  of \nincreasing competition from other fruit- and vegetable-producing and -processing countries.  \n \n17. \nThe problem is compounded for agro-enterprises, which are mostly small and medium-\nsized  enterprises.  Agro-enterprises  generally  have  to  mobilize  their  own  capital,  which  is  far \nmore  difficult  in  rural  areas.  They  face  similar  borrowing  problems  as  farmers,  including \ninadequate collateral and short loan repayment periods. In addition, agro-enterprises often have \nto  provide  inputs  and  technical  support  to  farmers  in  order  to  purchase  produce  of  sufficient \nquality  for  processing.  Therefore,  agro-enterprises  are  squeezed  at  both  ends  of  the  value \nchain. Agro-enterprises experience difficulty justifying financing due to their uneven accounting \npractices  and  weak  management  capacity.  Projects  that  are  able  to  bridge  this  gap  and \ndemonstrate  to  financial  institutions  that  both  farmers  and  agro-enterprises  are  creditworthy\u2014\neven  for  long-term  and  unsecured  loans\u2014build  system  confidence  and  capacity  to  broaden \naccess to financial services in rural areas. The rural finance sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n18. \nTo  address  the  income  gap  between  rural  and  urban  areas  and  between  the  eastern, \ncentral,  and  western  regions  of  the  country,  investments  to  promote  high-value  crops  and \nlivestock are effective means of increasing rural incomes and reducing poverty. Processing and \nmarketing of increased production, and product quality and safety can be carried out by private \nsector  enterprises  with  access  to  favorable  financing  to  expand  processing  capacity.  For  poor \nfarmers,  local  government  agencies  will  be  required  to  provide  credit  for  planting  materials, \nirrigation  infrastructure,  and  breeding  stock.  In  the  absence  of  effective  rural  financial \ninstitutions,  the  finance  bureaus  will  need  to  provide  investment  finance  for  these  inputs.  A \ntransition  to  high-value  crops  and  more  sustainable  production  practices\u2014water-saving \nirrigation,  IPM,  appropriate  use  of  agrochemicals,  and  safe  disposal  of  animal  waste\u2014can \nincrease  household  incomes  and  preserve  arable  land  and  water  resources.  Therefore,  an \nintegrated  agricultural  development  approach  is  required  to  optimize  Shanxi's  land  and  water \nresources, reduce poverty, and improve farm productivity and incomes. \n \n19. \nGovernment Policies and ADB\u2019s Country Strategy. In the PRC's 11th Five-Year Plan \n(2006\u20132010), the objective is to achieve greater balance between (i) urban and rural incomes, \n(ii) geographic regions, (iii) economic and social development, (iv) increasingly market-oriented \neconomy, and (v) economic growth with environmental sustainability. To highlight the emphasis \non  sustainable  agricultural  development,  the  Government  published  its  Policy  Document  on \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n          \n\nriver  basin  development,  watershed \n\nModern  Agriculture  in  January  2007.9  This  initiated  the  New  Socialist  Countryside  Policy  to \nredress the slow rate of rural income growth and poor socioeconomic conditions of the PRC's \n750 million rural population. The document recognizes that the persistent decline in the quality \nof natural resources and the deteriorating environment need to be addressed by changing the \nnature  of  agricultural  development.  The  Government's  plan  and  policy  are  in  line  with  ADB's \nexisting  strategic  objectives  and  operations  in  the  PRC  outlined  in  its  country  partnership \nstrategy,  2008\u20132010.10  ADB\u2019s  future  operations  in  the  PRC  will  focus  on  rural  development, \nenvironmental  sustainability,  energy  conservation,  urban  development,  and \nregional \ncooperation. ADB will mobilize more resources and develop diversified instruments to meet the \ndemand  for  balanced  development  among  regions,  and  between  rural  and  urban  areas.  ADB \nwill contribute to strengthen knowledge in policy, law, and governance reforms. \n \nExternal  Assistance. Among  the  development  partners,  the  World  Bank  has  provided \n20. \nthe most support to the agriculture and natural resources sector in the PRC, followed by ADB, \nwith total financing of $1.48 billion for 19 projects. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation \nhas  provided  assistance  to  the  sector  for  seven  projects,  focusing  on environment,  education, \npublic  health,  infrastructure,  and  forestry.  The  World  Bank  assistance  to  Shanxi  province \nincludes  support  for  poverty  reduction,  agricultural  and  natural  resources  development, \nsmallholder  cattle  development, \nrehabilitation, \nenvironmental  management,  health  and  sanitation,  transport  and  communications,  and  social \ninfrastructure.  ADB  assistance  to  the  province  has  included  projects  in  environmental \nimprovement,  thermal  power,  and  transport  and  communication.  Germany  has  provided  grant \nassistance  for  two  projects  in  the  sector  in  Shanxi.  Major  projects  in  the  sector  supported  by \nexternal  assistance  are  listed  in  Appendix  3.  In  the  PRC,  all  the  external  assistance  is \nharmonized  through  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan  (2006\u20132010).  The  Government  coordinates  the \nexternal  assistance  through  the  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission  and  the \nrelevant ministries. ADB and other organizations meet and work together formally and informally \nthrough  conferences  and  workshops  along  with  the  Government  to  share  experiences  and \nlessons.  During  preparation  and  implementation  of  agriculture  and  natural  resources  sector \nprojects,  ADB  staff  regularly  interact  with  counterpart  staff  of  the  World  Bank,  United  Nations \nand bilateral agencies, and nongovernment organizations. \n \nLessons.  The  majority  of  ADB-assisted  agricultural  development  projects  in  the  PRC \n21. \nare  rated  successful  but  some  agro-enterprise-related  operations  require  improvement.  The \nmain lessons indicate that project implementation quality can be strengthened by (i) provincial \nand local governments providing adequate and timely financial and staff resources; (ii) effective \nsupervision, monitoring, and cost control; (iii) allowing flexibility in project design to respond to \nchanges  as  implementation  progresses;  (iv)  properly  administering  the  bidding  process;  and  \n(v)  setting  up  a  robust  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS)  at  the  outset  to  obtain \nadequate information needed for taking timely corrective measures.  \n \nADB's  country  assistance  program  evaluation11  identifies  a  number  of  agro-enterprise-\n22. \nrelated  issues  that  are  relevant  to  the  Project.  These  include  (i)  agroprocessing  projects  have \nhad to rely on the untested capacity of private agro-enterprises, (ii) due to insufficient financial \nrates  of  return  and  difficulties  in  servicing  the  debt,  the  Government  is  reluctant  to  borrow  for \nsuch  projects  on  ordinary  capital  resources  terms,  and  (iii)  the  failure  of  onlending  through \n\n                                                 \n9  Communist  Party  of  China  Central  Committee.  2007.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nfinancial  institutions  required  channeling  of  funds  through  agro-enterprises.  While  the  country \nassistance  program  evaluation  does  not  provide  reasons  for  the  less-than-satisfactory \nperformance of agroprocessing projects, the project completion report (PCR) for the Fujian Soil \nConservation and Agriculture Development Project12 refers to a number of problems common to \nsuch  projects,  including  (i)  changing  market  trends,  (ii)  location  in  relation  to  raw  material \nsupply,  (iii)  weak  financial  position,  and  (iv)  inappropriate  financing  terms,  which  (a)  failed  to \nreflect cash flow and required loan repayments to start immediately (prior to full operation of the \nfacilities installed with project loan funds), (b) included an interest spread for the finance bureau, \nwhich  drove  the  resulting  end-borrower\u2019s  interest  rate  above  domestic  market  rates,  and  (c) \nrequired  the  arrangement  of  complementary  working  capital.  ADB\u2019s  technical  assistance \nreport13  identifies  similar  lessons,  specifically  that  agro-enterprises  with  viable  business  plans \nand  good  management  capacity  can  succeed  by  using  ordinary  capital  resources  or  other \ncommercial  financing.  However,  where  financial  markets  fail,  development  partners  and \ngovernments  can  address  this  gap  by  providing  specific  financial  products  (loans,  equity,  and \nguarantees)  that  assist small  and  medium-sized  enterprises,  or  more  specifically  private  agro-\nenterprises. Agro-enterprises often need long-term financing because of the lead time required \nto attain full production capacity. But the long-term financing should not be subsidized. Instead, \nthe terms and conditions of financing should reflect a realistic repayment schedule.  \n \nThe  recently  completed  PCR  on  the  West  Henan  Agricultural  Development  Project14 \n23. \nfound that the horticulture and livestock components were successfully implemented and helped \nsignificantly reduce poverty among the participating households. More than 33,000 households \nwere  provided  with  subloans  and  the  average  repayment  rate  was  96%.  The  main \nrecommendations of the PCR include (i) the financial management system of subloans should \nbe computerized and integrated with the relevant government accounting systems; (ii) subloans \nto  farmers  should  be  disbursed  rather  than  reimbursed  as  poor  households  do  not  have  cash \noutlays  for  up-front  investment;  (iii)  to  make  project  management  more  inclusive,  the  Poverty \nAlleviation and Development Office (PADO) should be closely involved; and (iv) a PPMS should \nbe set up at an early stage and be computerized. The World Bank's implementation completion \nreport  on  the  Shanxi  Poverty  Alleviation  Project15  rates  almost  all  of  its  components\u2014river \nbeach development, village water supply, rural roads, soil and water conservation, horticulture, \nlivestock,  revolving  fund  for  microfinance,  and  project  management\u2014as  satisfactory  or  highly \nsatisfactory.  But  the  agroprocessing  component  is  rated  unsatisfactory  because  many  of  the \nagro-enterprises  had  been  state-owned  enterprises  with  \"poorly  trained  managers.\"  However, \none agro-enterprise is rated as \"exceptionally successful\" because it was privately owned and \nhad  outstanding  management  that  understood  the  markets  well  and  managed  its  operations \nefficiently. Overall, the project was rated successful. The rate of recovery of subloans from farm \nhouseholds  is  also  highly  satisfactory.  More  details  on  experiences  and  lessons  from  past \nprojects is presented in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \nThe recommendations outlined in the PCR on the West Henan Agricultural Development \n24. \nProject have been an integral part of the Project's design from the outset. Where appropriate, \nseveral  other  lessons  were  incorporated  in  the  design;  these  include  (i)  establish strict  criteria \nfor  selecting  project  components  and  agro-enterprises  that  satisfy  financial,  economic, \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2003.

Moreover, in-depth discussions of various aspects of project \nimplementation,  financing,  disbursement  procedures,  and  the  PPMS  were  held  with  the  PMO \nand concerned finance bureaus. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n25. \nThe  anticipated  impact  of  the  Project  is  to  reduce  rural  poverty  and  develop  a \nsustainable  agriculture  sector  in  26  counties  of  Shanxi.  The  outcome  of  the  Project  will  be \nincreased  farm  productivity  and  household  income  resulting  from  high-value  agricultural \nproduction  by  adopting  appropriate  and  environmentally  sound  technologies  and  practices, \nvalue addition through processing, and efficient market access; and improved food quality and \nsafety in the project counties. \n \nB. \n \nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  more  than  66,000  farm  households  (about  264,000 \n26. \npeople)  by  providing  them  with  credit  and  indirectly  benefit  another  16,000  household  in  26 \ncounties of five municipalities in central and southern Shanxi, where the per capita land area is \nless than 0.17 ha. Of these, 11 are poverty counties and 12 are on the priority list for treatment \nof accelerated soil erosion in the PRC. The Project comprises four components: (i) transition to \nhigh-value  production  by  adopting  technologies  and  practices  that  ensure  environmental \nsustainability  and  increase  farmers'  incomes;  (ii)  strengthening  of  farm\u2013market  linkages  by \nsupporting  on-farm  and  industrial  agroprocessing  and  marketing  of  high-value  products;  (iii) \ncapacity-building and training of farmers, farmer associations, and TSAs to support high-value \nproduction  and  processing  of  farm  products;  and  (iv)  project  management  to  support  efficient \nimplementation  of  the  Project.  The  first  component  includes  three  activities\u2014perennial  crops, \nannual  crops,  and  livestock.  To  keep  project  implementation  manageable,  each  participating \ncounty will take up any two of these. The criteria to select project counties, sites, and activities \nare  in  Appendix  4;  and  the  distribution  of  project  activities  by  municipalities  and  counties  is \ndescribed in Appendix 5.  \n \n\n1.  \n\nTransition to High-Value Production \n\n \n27. \nGrowing  traditional  cereal  crops  (wheat  and  maize),  in  the  project  area,  requires \nextensive  and  excessive  use  of  soil,  irrigation  water,  fertilizers,  and  pesticides.  Generally,  the \nLoess Plateau is not suitable for this type of extensive agriculture. Given the structural design, 4 \nmu  (about  0.25  ha)  are  needed  to  build  a  1-mu  greenhouse  (about  0.07  ha  or  667  m2).  Such \ngreenhouses can produce high-value vegetables that can more than double the annual income \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nof a household. This operation will also provide much higher employment and use far less water \nand fertilizers, thus improving the soil condition and ensuring food safety. Planting of perennial \nfruit trees, i.e., walnuts, pears, and apples, on sloping lands will preserve soils from erosion and \nincrease  household  incomes  by  about  30%.  Pig  raising  is  traditionally  carried  out  by  building \nsheds inside the homes. This practice is unhealthy for farm households and animals, and does \nnot allow for proper disposal of animal wastes. Under the Project, combined pig sheds will be \nbuilt  for  5\u20136  households  separate  from  homes  with  proper  infrastructure  to  dispose  of  animal \nwastes  safely,  either  by  turning  it  into  compost  or  biogas,  a  source  of  rural  clean  energy \ngeneration.  Other  livestock,  i.e.,  goats,  sheep,  and  cattle,  mostly  graze  free  on  the  range, \nlittering it with animal waste and causing extensive damage to grasslands that become prone to \nerosion and land degradation. The Project will assist these households to adopt pen-feeding to \nimprove  livestock  productivity  through  proper  feeding,  guarding  against  infectious  animal \ndiseases, and safe and productive disposal of animal waste. \n \n28. \nHigh-Value  Perennial  Crop  Production.  This  subcomponent  will  focus  on  perennial \ncrops  such as  fruits,  nuts,  and selected  Chinese  herbs.  The  Project  will  provide  credit  to  farm \nhouseholds  to  access  planting  material  and  technology  to  plant  high-value  crops,  increase \nproduction,  and  achieve  value-addition.  To  support  poor  households  in  rain-fed  areas,  hardy, \nhigh-value dryland crops such as Chinese medicinal herbs and walnuts will be promoted. The \nproject activities include planting of walnut, apple, pear, red jujube (Chinese date), prickly ash, \nasparagus,  fast-growing  poplar  trees,  and  Chinese  herbs.  The  estimated  planted  area  will  be \nabout 13,850 ha, benefiting about 46,000 households in 20 counties in five municipalities.  \n \n29. \nHigh-Value  Annual  Crop  Production.  This  subcomponent  will  support  the  production \nof  high-value  vegetables  and  yellow  millet.  The  credit  to  participating  households  will  finance \ninfrastructure  such  as  establishment  of  greenhouses,  improved  water  use  efficiency,  and \nterracing. The vegetables\u2014cucumber, vegetable marrow, and tomato\u2014will be produced in two \ntypes of greenhouses, whereas yellow millet will be field grown. About 1,240 \u201csunshine\u201d (on flat \nland)  and  4,650  \u201carchcanopy\u201d  greenhouses  will  be  established.  Another  1,530  sunshine \ngreenhouses will be established on hilly land. Each greenhouse occupies an area of about 667 \nm2  (1  mu)  and  will  be  established  by  a  single  household.  Qinzhou  yellow  millet  variety  will  be \nproduced  in  dryland  areas  of  Qin  county\u2014the  place  of  origin  of  the  nationally  famous  yellow \nmillet brand\u2014on about 600 ha. A total of 9,700 households will benefit from this activity. \n \n30. \nImproving  Livestock  Production.  This  subcomponent  will  promote  high-value  small-\nscale  livestock  production  by  extending  credit  to  eligible  farmers.  In  line  with  the  Project\u2019s \npoverty focus, limits will be placed on the size of livestock herds to ensure that benefits go to \npoor  farmers  in  a  wide  area.  It  includes  pig  breeding  and  fattening,  beef  cattle  breeding  and \nfattening,  broiler  and  layer  chicken  production,  and  sheep  breeding  for  meat  and  goats  for \ncashmere.  Livestock  production  bases  will  support  about  9,400  households,  of  which  about \n5,000 are poor households in 20 counties of five municipalities.  \n \n\n2.  \n\nStrengthening Farmer\u2013Market Linkages \n\n \nIn  most  project  counties,  a  variety  of  marketing  channels  exist  with  varying  degrees  of \n31. \nefficiency.  Rapid  development  of  expressways  and  rural  roads  and  extensive  coverage  of \ncellular  phone  networks  in  recent  years  have  made  input  and  output  markets  and  price \ninformation  readily  accessible  to  farmers.16  Under  the  Project,  the  participating  farmers  will \nmake the transition to high-value production systems and connect to the value chain for the first \n                                                 \n16  The loan fact-finding mission interviewed farmers in remote counties who carried cell phones, demonstrating easy \n\naccess to brokers and farmer associations to receive the latest information on prices and market trends.   \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n          \n\ntime.  Establishing  high-value  production  bases,  expanding  on-farm  processing  capacity,  and \nconnecting farmers to agro-enterprises\u2014through formal contractual arrangements\u2014are among \nthe  most  effective  ways  to  strengthen  farmer\u2013market  linkages.  Of  the  24  agro-enterprises \ninvolved in the Project, five will borrow from the Project to expand their storage capacity. Their \nincreased  procurement  of  farm  produce  will  indirectly  benefit  16,000  nonborrowing  farm \nhouseholds.  Another  19  will  not  borrow  from  the  Project  but  will  sign  buy-back  contracts  and \nprovide credit guarantees to about 30% (or about 20,000) of the 66,000 borrowing households.  \n \nExpanding  On-Farm  Processing.  On-farm  processing  investments  include  drying  of \n32. \nChinese dates in temperature-controlled warehouses within households. Red jujubes are dried \njust  before  full  ripening  to  prevent  splitting  soon  after  harvesting.  Drying  ensures  quality, \nprolongs  storage  life,  and  increases  value.  To  facilitate  the  drying  process  of  additional \nproduction  of  about  4,000  tons  annually  from  about  400  ha,  construction  of  about  100  drying-\nrooms, each with a capacity of 24 tons, will be supported. Each drying room will be managed by \none  household  and  cater  to  a  group  of  10  households.  Another  four  150-ton  capacity \natmosphere-controlled warehouses will be built to store other types of fruit. These warehouses \nwill  address  farmers\u2019  storage  problems  during  harvesting  and  prolong  fruits'  storage  life,  and \nresult in better prices during off-season sales. Each of these warehouses will benefit a group of \n10  households,  and  be  managed  by  one  household.  These  100  drying  rooms  and  four \nwarehouses will benefit a total of 1,040 households. \n \n33. \nExpanding  Agroprocessing  Operations.  About  150  agro-enterprises  in  the  project \narea are engaged in processing fruit, vegetable, and livestock products. These agro-enterprises \nare linked to farmers through a variety of formal, contract-farming, and informal arrangements, \nand  provide  an  important  market  outlet.  However,  for  many,  the  ability  to  expand  market \nopportunities is constrained by inadequate storage and processing facilities because of lack of \nlong-term investment financing. The Project will support five privately owned agro-enterprises to \nexpand cold storage capacity in fruit (two), millet, meat, and vegetable pickling. This will expand \n(i)  the  production  of  current  contract  farmers  with  whom  agro-enterprises  have  buy-back \narrangements,  and  (ii)  the  number  of  farmers  supplying  to  agro-enterprises.  The  five  agro-\nenterprises  were  identified  according  to  the  eligibility  criteria  set  up  during  project  preparation \nand have financially viable investment proposals (Appendix 6). More than 16,000 nonborrowing \nhouseholds will indirectly benefit from these investments. \n \n34. \nEnhancing  Product  Quality  and  Providing  Credit  Guarantees.  To  improve  product \nquality  and  safety,  the  Project  will  introduce  ChinaGAP  standards  both  at  the  farm  and  for \nagroprocessing. Compliance with ChinaGAP will eventually lead to certification by GlobalGAP. \nThese practices will improve raw material traceability and reassure importers about the quality \nand  safety  of  agricultural  exports  from  Shanxi.  The  Project  will  provide  specialized  training  to \nagro-enterprises and participating farmers to be able to comply with ChinaGAP standards.17 The \nProject will also help establish formal linkages between the beneficiary (borrowing) farmers and \n19  agro-enterprises  by  signing  contract-farming  agreements.  Through  these  agreements,  the \nfarmers  will  get  access  to  stable  markets  and  receive  premium  prices  for  their  produce,  and \nagro-enterprises  will  provide  credit  guarantees  for  farmers'  subloan  repayments.  These  agro-\nenterprises will benefit by ensuring access to stable and quality farm produce and fully utilizing \ntheir installed processing capacity.   \n \n\n                                                 \n17 Depending  on  the  readiness  to  meet  standards,  the  certification  process  takes  a  few  months  and  requires \nadditional costs\u2014on average about $50\u2013$70 per hectare\u2014to enroll in the program for quality audits. The farmers' \nand  agro-enterprises'  participation  in  ChinaGAP  initiatives  will  be  voluntary.  The  project  training  will  help  them \nassess the long-term benefits of certification and to make their own decision to participate in the program.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nNineteen  privately  owned  agro-enterprises  were  selected  from  a  long-list  of  138  to \n35. \nparticipate in the Project for the ChinaGAP and credit guarantee initiatives. They will not receive \nany  financing  from  the  Project  but  will  work  closely  with  the  project  beneficiaries.  They  were \nselected\u2014jointly  by  provincial,  municipal,  and  county  finance  and  agriculture  bureaus,  and \npoverty  alleviation  and  development  offices  (PADOs)\u2014based  on  the  following  criteria:  (i) \nvoluntary participation, (ii) profitable operation with good market access, (iii) potential to expand \nprocessing capacity, (iv) debt\u2013equity ratio not exceeding 1.5 or 60:40, and (v) total net assets \nexceeding outstanding loan amounts. The 19 agro-enterprises, in 14 project counties, will work \nwith  about  30%  of  the  66,000  beneficiary  households  by  providing  them  with  credit  guarantee \nand  technical  services,  and  signing  buy-back  contracts.  Through  these  arrangements,  the \nProject  will  help  these  agro-enterprises  fully  utilize  their  installed  capacity,  expand  their \nproduction  bases,  improve  product  quality  and  safety,  and  decrease  transaction  costs. \nTherefore, these arrangements will be mutually beneficial for participating households and the \nagro-enterprises. The selected agro-enterprises have expressed willingness to participate in the \nProject in writing to the county finance bureaus (CFBs).  \n \nAll  24  agro-enterprises  will  participate  in  the  project  activities,  demonstrating  effective \n36. \nfarmer\u2013market  linkages  and  showing  how  such  linkages  can  improve  value-addition  for  farms \nby improving product quality to satisfy the demands of international and, especially, increasingly \ndiscerning domestic consumers. During project preparation, a detailed due diligence review was \nundertaken  showing  that  all  24  agro-enterprises  are  financially  sound;  have  viable  business \nplans, adequate processing capacity, and a good outreach program; and have well-trained and \nexperienced  management,  and  a  good  reputation  in  dealing  with  farmers.  The  financial  due \ndiligence review report is in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n \n\n3. \n\nCapacity Building and Training \n\n37. \nFarmer  Training  and  Demonstration  Activities.  Successful  adoption  of  high-value \nproduction  systems  will  require  a  well-developed  farmer  training  program  and  demonstration \nactivities. Initially, \"trainer farmers\" will be trained to, in turn, provide training for other farmers in \ntownships  and  villages.  Training  will  be  provided  in  modern  farm  production  technologies  and \npractices, water-saving irrigation practices, IPM, animal waste disposal, and marketing. Training \nwill  be  spread  over  the  project  implementation  period  in  accordance  with  the  phasing  of \ninvestment activities. Given that training will be held in villages and communities, it will not be \nlimited  to  farmers  participating  in  the  Project,  but  will  be  provided  to  all  interested  farmers  to \nraise  awareness  about  new  technologies  and  practices.  Farmers  will  attend  refresher  courses \nfrom time to time. Training will be provided to 280,000 farmers in the project area over 5 years. \nOn  the  assumption  that  each  farm  household  participating  in  the  Project  (66,000)  attends  two \nrounds of training, 150,000 nonparticipating farm households will also benefit from the Project's \nfarmer  training  program.  To  ensure  women\u2019s  and  poor  households'  access  to  these \ntechnologies, training will specifically target members of their households. \n \n38. \nThe  Project  will  introduce  technologies  and  practices  to  encourage  sustainable  use  of \nland and water resources, and improve poor women's access to modern production technology \nand  microfinance.  Excessive  use  of  groundwater  in  many  project  counties  is  causing  a  rapid \ndrawdown  of  aquifers;  this  coupled  with  climate  change  impacts  means  the  situation  will \nexacerbate  in  the  coming  years.  The  transition  from  grain  crops  to  high-value  vegetable \nproduction in greenhouses will result in significant water saving. But the flood-irrigation practices \nin  the  existing  greenhouses  are  also  wasteful.  To  demonstrate  the  benefits  of  improved \ngroundwater  management,  WFPF  will  provide  a  grant.  Under  the  WFPF-supported  activities, \nabout  300  poor  farmers,  in  five  project  counties,  will  receive  subsidies  to  install  drip  irrigation \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n          \n\ninfrastructure in their greenhouses and receive training. Staff of the water resources bureaus will \nalso  receive  training  and  monitoring  equipment  for  sustainable  groundwater  management.  A \nsummary  of  activities  of  this  demonstration  project  and  its  implementation  arrangements  is  in \nAppendix 7, and a more detailed concept paper is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n39. \nRural finance is particularly inaccessible to poor women in Shanxi as they mostly (i) live \nin remote villages, (ii) need loans in small amounts, (iii) cannot provide collateral, and (iv) have \nfew skills in modern production and marketing practices. ADB's GDCF has provided a grant to \npilot-test  the  viability  of  microfinance  cooperatives  and  revolving  funds  in  four  villages  of  two \npoverty  counties.18  Selected  poor  women  will  get  access  to microfinance  from  revolving  funds \nand  receive  training  to  improve  production  and  marketing  skills,  and  to  increase  household \nincomes. A summary of GDCF activities and implementation arrangements is in Appendix 8 and \na detailed concept paper is in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n40. \nCapacity  Building  of  Farmer  Associations.  Shanxi  has  about  1,900  officially \nregistered farmer associations; of these 1,220 are in the project area. Despite their widespread \nproliferation, many of the associations have inadequate capacity and sometimes are too small \nto be effective. To demonstrate the role such associations play in marketing farm produce and \ndisseminating farm technologies and practices, the Project will support five associations in key \ncrop  and  livestock  activities.  The  Shanxi  provincial  government  (SPG)  identified  these \nassociations  during  project  preparation  as  having  the  potential  for  a  significant  demonstration \neffect within the project area as a whole. These include the Xinnong Science and Technology \nAssociation  in  Qin  county,  the  Prickly  Ash  Association  and  Walnut  Association  in  Pingshun \ncounty,  and  the  vegetable  and  livestock  associations  in  Liulin  county.  The  Project  will  provide \ntraining to enhance their organizational skills, support study tours to learn from better organized \nassociations  within  and  outside  the  province,  and  provide  equipment  and  furniture.  They  will \nalso receive training in farmer mobilization and group management to make them more effective \nas a conduit for information transfer. \n \n41. \nCapacity  Building  of  Technical  Service  Agencies.  The  Project  will  support  TSAs  to \nenhance their capacity for providing better services to beneficiary households. This will include \nsupport  to  provincial,  municipal,  and  county  TSAs  to  (i)  prepare  and  publish  farm  manuals;  \n(ii)  demonstrate  sustainable  farming  practices,  i.e.,  producing  high-value  outputs  ensuring \nquality  and  safety,  water-saving  irrigation  systems,  and  stall-feeding  livestock  practices;  and  \n(iii) monitor environmental parameters, including water quality and balance, and soil conditions. \nA detailed institutional analysis is presented in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n\n4.  \n\nProject Management  \n\n \n42. \nThe  PMO  and  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  will  be  strengthened  through  staff \ntraining,  workshops,  and  study  tours,  and  the  provision  of  vehicles  and  equipment.  Relevant \nstaff  from  the  implementing  agencies  as  well  as  from  the  provincial,  municipal,  and  county \nfinance  bureaus  will  receive  training  at  the  start  of  the  Project  in  financial  management  and \nreporting,  and  ADB  disbursement  and  procurement  procedures.  The  PMO  will  establish  and \nmaintain  a  PPMS  to  monitor  project  implementation  progress  and  performance  in  meeting  its \nobjectives and output targets. Project components and activities are discussed in greater detail \nin Supplementary Appendix H. \n \n\n                                                 \n18  ADB. 2003.

The GDCF is currently \n\nfinanced by Canada, Denmark, Ireland, and Norway. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nSustainable  Production  Processes.  The  Project  will  promote \n\n43. \nThe transition to high-value crops is taking place in many parts of Shanxi but its pace is \nslow  and  not  well-coordinated  to  optimize  the  impact  on  farmers'  income,  access  to  markets, \nproduct  quality  and  safety,  and  the  environment.  Poor  farmers,  especially  poor  women,  have \nlimited  or  no  access  to  rural  finance.  The  Project  will  introduce  technologies  and  practices, \nsome for the first time, in Shanxi for integrated agricultural development. \n \nintegrated  and \n44. \nsustainable farm production and processing technologies and practices to significantly improve \nenvironmental management of land and water resources. This will include efficient groundwater \nuse  for  irrigation,  reduced  use  of  agrochemicals,  increased  use  of  compost,  wider  practice  of \nIPM, as well as safe disposal of livestock waste.  \n \n45. \nEnhanced Food Quality and Safety. The Project will improve farmer\u2013market linkages \nby connecting agro-enterprises with production bases and establishing a series of best practices \nto  improve  product  quality  and  safety  by  introducing  ChinaGAP.  Improving  farmer\u2013market \nlinkages will (i) enhance farmers\u2019 awareness about food safety, (ii) improve farmers' access to \nstable markets, (iii) enhance product quality to attain premium prices, (iv) reduce price volatility, \nand  (v)  increase  farm  incomes.  Farmers,  agro-enterprises,  and  consumers  will  benefit  from \nreduced transaction costs. \n \n46. \nClimate  Change  Adaptation.  The  WFPF-funded  activities  will  demonstrate  viability  of \nmore  productive  and  efficient  irrigation  techniques,  and  support  the  participating  farmers  in \nadapting to climate change impacts. Skills training will directly and indirectly help an estimated  \n5,000  farmers  to  reduce  their  dependence  on  the  already  scarce  water  resources.  Poor \nhouseholds will be given subsidies to adopt water-saving irrigation technology. These initiatives \nwill provide examples of good practices that are replicable in non-project counties of Shanxi and \nin  other  provinces.  The  capacity  of  water  resources  bureaus  will  also  be  strengthened  to \nimprove sustainable management of groundwater resources. \n  \n47.  Women's  Economic  Empowerment.  In  many  participating  counties,  the  majority  of \nfarm  households  are  headed  by  women  as  men  migrate  to  seek  off-farm  employment. \nTherefore,  the  Project  will  pay  special  attention  to  households  headed  by  women  to  provide \ntraining  and  to  ensure  they  receive  proportionate  assistance  from  project  activities,  especially \nloan  funds.19  Due  to  variability  in  databases  on  households,  the  percentage  of  households \nactually  headed  by  women  is  difficult  to  quantify.  Therefore,  targeting  will  be  done  in  villages \nduring project implementation. To ensure women's access to loan funds, they will be allowed to \nsign the credit agreement without needing a male cosignatory, which is currently not a common \npractice.  The  GDCF-funded  pilot  will  introduce  revolving  funds  for  poor  women  to  access \nmicrofinance in four poverty villages for the first time in Shanxi. Poor women will be organized in \nproduction  groups  and  allowed  access  to  microfinance  through  group  guarantees  and  without \nrequiring collateral. If this pilot is successful, it may be replicated in other project counties. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n19  If the households in a project village or county are headed by women, the same proportion of project assistance, \ni.e., number and amount of subloans and training will be provided to women. But women in general will have equal \naccess to project activities including training.   \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n          \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nD. \n \n48. \nThe project investment cost is estimated at $189.3 million, including taxes and duties of \n$17.6  million,  contingencies  of  $0.8  million,  and  financial  charges  during  implementation  of  \n$1.3 million.

Physical  contingencies  are \ncomputed  at  5%  on  all  project  costs.  Price  contingencies  are  computed  at  0.8%  on  foreign  exchange  costs, \nand  2.2%  on  local  currency  costs  in  2009,  and  at  3.0%  thereafter;  includes  provision  for  potential  exchange \nrate fluctuation under the assumption of a purchasing power parity exchange rate. \n\nd  Includes interest and commitment charge.

The  loan  will  have  a  26  year-term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  6  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  on  undisbursed \nfunds, and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the loan agreement. The Government \nhas  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nlending  facility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these \nchoices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or \n\n \n\n\fadvice  from  ADB.  In  addition,  the  Multi-Donor  Trust  Fund  under  the  WFPF20  will  provide \n$500,000  (0.3%  of  the  total  project  cost)  and  the  GDCF21  will  provide  grant  cofinancing \nequivalent  to  $195,000  (0.1%  of  the  total  project  cost),  both  to  be  administered  by  ADB.

The  remaining  cost  will  be \n50. \nfinanced as follows (i) SPG, through its finance bureaus, $26.5 million; (ii) farmer associations, \n$0.3  million;  (iii)  participating  farmers,  $59.3  million;  and  (iv)  participating  agro-enterprises,  \n$2.5 million. SPG has agreed that interest during implementation and commitment charges will \nbe  financed  by  the  end  users  of  the  ADB  loan.  SPG  has  also  agreed  that  all  contingencies \nrelating to expenditures under the Project will be financed by local governments and end users. \n \n51. \nThe PRC will be the borrower of the ADB loan. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will make \nthe  proceeds  of  the  ADB  loan  available  to  SPG.  The  Shanxi  Finance  Department  (SFD),  on \nbehalf  of  SPG,  will  make  the  loan  proceeds  available  in  agreed  amounts  through  the  five \nparticipating  municipal  finance  bureaus  (MFBs)  to  the  26  participating  county  finance  bureaus \n(CFBs).22  The  CFBs  will  provide  subloans  to  final  borrowers  (farmers  and  agro-enterprises) \nunder  subloan  agreements  subject  to  approval  by  appropriate  authorities.  The  terms  and \nconditions for the loan proceeds transferred from MOF through SFD and MFBs to CFBs will be \nthe  same  as  those  applied  to  the  ADB  loan.  The  terms  and  conditions  of  the  subloans  will \ninclude  (i)  the  interest  rate  will  not be  lower  than  the  prevailing commercial  rate  of  interest for \n\n                                                 \n20  Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, and Spain. \n21 Contributors: the governments of Canada, Denmark, Ireland, and Norway. \n22 During  project  preparation,  a  financial  management  assessment  of  SFD,  including  a  sample  of  one  of  the  five \nMFBs (Jinzhong municipality), a sample of five of the 26 CFBs (Yuchi district, Lishi district, Houma city, Wanrong \ncounty, and Qin county) and a sample of five of the 185 township finance stations (Fengcun, Yuebe, Jinjiazhuang, \nLicheng, and Xujiaduo) was carried out (Supplementary Appendix I). It concludes that these entities satisfy ADB\u2019s \nminimum  financial  management  requirements  for  executing  and  implementing  agencies.  All  of  these  are \ngovernment offices in the hierarchy under MOF and have satisfactory financial management capability to (i) record \nrequired  financial  transactions  and  balances,  (ii)  provide  regular  and  reliable  financial  statements  and  monitoring \nreports,  and  (iii)  safeguard  financial  assets.  These  offices  are  adequately  staffed  and  some  staff  have  prior \nexperience with the World Bank- or ADB-financed projects. However, additional training on relevant ADB policies \nand procedures will be provided to enhance their capacity prior to or at the start of the Project.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n          \n\nequivalent types of loans;23 (ii) a repayment period to be determined based on the cash flow of \nthe subloan borrower's projection of future revenue, including a grace period not exceeding that \nof  the  ADB  loan;  (iii)  SFD  bearing  the  foreign  exchange  risk  for  all  subloans;  (iv)  the  CFBs \nbearing  the  credit  risk  for  all  subloans.  Currently,  the  Government  has  a  policy  that  requires \nhousehold borrowers to apply for a subloan to reimburse their capital expenditures.24 Under this \nProject, the Government has agreed to pilot-test the advance disbursement of subloans to the \nqualified  borrowers.  Based  on  the  assessment  of  financial  management  capacity,  SPG  will \nselect up to five qualified participating counties where the second-generation imprest accounts \nwill  be  set  up  to  pilot-test  the  subloan  disbursement  procedure.  Based  on  successful \nperformance  of  such  arrangements,  the  same  procedure  may  be  expanded  to  other \nparticipating  counties.  The  subloan  disbursement,  financial  management  and  monitoring \nprocedures, and the flow of funds are described in Appendix 10. \n \nF. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n52. \nSPG,  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project,  will  coordinate  and  supervise  all \nimplementation  activities  through  a  project  leading  group  chaired  by  the  vice  governor  of \nShanxi, with the deputy director of the Provincial Development and Reform Commission, deputy \ndirector  of  SFD,  and  director  of  PADO  as  vice  chairpersons.  The  deputy  directors  of  the \nprovincial  departments  of  water  resources,  agriculture,  land  and  resources,  forests,  audit,  and \nenvironmental  protection,  and  of  the  All  China  Women's  Federation  (ACWF)  will  be  the \nmembers. Similar municipal and county leading groups will be constituted.  \n \n53. \nSPG  will  set  up  the  PMO  at  PADO  in  Taiyuan.  The  PMO,  together  with  the  Fund \nAdministration  Unit  (Division  of  International  Capital  Management)  of  SFD  will  coordinate  and \noversee  implementation  of  all  activities  on  a  day-to-day  basis.  The  PMO  will  (i)  organize, \ncoordinate,  and  guide  related  departments  in  project  municipalities  and  counties  for  effective \nimplementation  of  the  Project;  (ii)  prepare  an  annual  work  program  and  budget;  (iii)  organize \nprocurement;  (iv)  maintain  consolidated  accounts,  including  developing  a  PPMS  to  track  all \nfinancial transactions with subborrowers; (v) prepare and submit to ADB withdrawal applications \nand  statements  of  expenditure  through  SFD;  (vi)  monitor  physical  and  financial  progress, \nincluding  benefits  flow  to  intended  beneficiaries,  and  submit  reports  to  the  provincial \ngovernment and ADB; and (vii) liaise with SPG through SFD for reporting to MOF and ADB. The \nmunicipal and county PIUs, one in each of the five municipalities and 26 counties, will assist the \nPMO. The PIUs will be responsible for day-to-day implementation of all project activities under \nthe  overall  guidance  of  the  PMO.  The  provincial  Environmental  Protection  Department  will  be \nresponsible  for  monitoring  compliance  with  national  environmental  standards,  rules,  and \nregulations.  The  CFBs,  as  implementing  agencies  for  the  five  agro-enterprises,  will  supervise \nthe  financing  and  monitoring  activities  in  Yuchi  district,  and  Taigui,  Pingyao,  Qin  Xian,  and \nWanrong counties. The relevant environmental protection bureaus and water resources bureaus \nwill undertake environmental monitoring of soil and water resources, and agrochemicals.  \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n23  The benchmark is the People's Bank of China's lending rate over 5 years. The prevailing rate is around 7.75% per \n\nannum. http://www.pbc.gov.cn/english/detail.asp?col=6400&id=1159. \n\n24 While this policy improves financial management and lowers the risk of subloan misappropriation, it increases the \nprobability of excluding many poor borrowers who cannot arrange for upfront financing from family and friends.   \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  6  years  from  2010  to  2015.  The  implementation \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n54. \nschedule is in Appendix 11. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement  \n\n \n55. \nOf the $100.0 million loan, about $98.7 million will be disbursed in cash as farm credit to \nfarmers and agro-enterprises. The remaining $1.3 million will be used to procure office and farm \nequipment, vehicles, and to conduct workshops and training by the PMO and PIUs. The detailed \nprocurement plan is in Appendix 12. All procurement of goods and works will be carried out in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nContracts for works estimated to exceed or equal $10.0 million and those for goods estimated to \nexceed or equal $1.0 million will be procured using international competitive bidding procedures. \nContracts  for  works  estimated  to  cost  less  than  $10.0  million  but  more  than  or  equal  to \n$200,000,  and  contracts  for  goods  estimated  to  cost  less  than  $1.0  million  but  more  than  or \nequal  to  $100,000  will  be  procured  through  national  competitive  bidding  procedures  in \naccordance  with  the  PRC  Tendering  and  Bidding  Law  (1999),  subject  to  modifications  agreed \nwith ADB. Contracts for works estimated to cost less than $200,000 and for goods estimated to \ncost  less  than  $100,000  will  be  procured  using  shopping  procedures.  All  procurements  and \nexpenditures by farmers and agro-enterprises\u2014undertaken or incurred using the subloans\u2014will \nbe  supported  with  receipts  provided  to  the  PIUs  and  kept  on  the  PIU  and/or  PMO  record  for \naudit. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be \nincluded in all procurement documents and contracts.  \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n56. \nThe  Project  will  provide  120  person-months  of  national  consulting  services  for  project \nmanagement  and  training.  SPG  will  finance  and  engage  five  individual  consultants  to  \n(i) introduce ChinaGAP to promote best practices in product quality and safety; (ii) build capacity \nof  farmers  and  their  associations  to  adopt  improved  production  and  marketing  practices;  \n(iii)  train  TSAs  in  gender  development,  monitoring  of  soil  and  water  quality,  safe  disposal  of \nanimal  waste,  and  environmental  impact  assessment;  and  (iv)  support  the  PMO  and  PIUs  to \nundertake  and  prepare  project  monitoring  and  supervision,  bidding  and  procurement \ndocuments,  midterm  review,  and  a  project  completion  report.  Specific  consulting  inputs  are \noutlined  in  Appendix  13.  To  implement  WFPF  activities,  three  individual  consultants  will  be \nengaged  for  25  person-months\u2014one  international  (water  resources  specialist,  5  person-\nmonths) and two national (irrigation specialist 12 person-months and hydrogeologist 8 person-\nmonths).  To  implement  GDCF  activities,  a  local  nongovernment  organization  will  be  engaged \nfollowing  the  single-source  selection  procedure  (Appendix  8).  A  national  individual  consultant \nwill be engaged for 2.5 person-months to monitor and evaluate GDCF activities. All recruitment \nfinanced  under  the  WFPF  and  GDCF  grants  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n \n57. \nSPG  has  requested  advance  contracting  action  and  retroactive  financing  to  procure \noffice  and  farm  equipment,  vehicles,  and  civil  works.  This  request  is  justified  to  make  timely \npreparations  for  the  upcoming  cropping  season.  ADB  has  advised  SPG  that  retroactive \nfinancing  could  apply  for  up  to  20%  of  the  loan  for  expenditures  incurred  before  loan \neffectiveness  and  within  12  months  prior  to  the  signing  of  the  loan  agreement.  All  contracts \nproposed  for  advance  action  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n          \n\nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The Government and \nSPG have been advised that approval of the advance action and retroactive financing does not \ncommit ADB to financing the Project. PADO and municipal and county agencies have adequate \ncapacity to manage requisite procurement as demonstrated under similar projects in the recent \npast. PADO is engaging an independent design institute to prepare the bidding documents. The \nADB\u2019s  resident  mission  in  the  PRC  provided  training  to  PMO  and  PIU  staff  in  July  2009  to \nfamiliarize them with ADB's procurement and disbursement policies and procedures. \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n58. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with SPG. Consistent with \nits commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to \ninvestigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive \npractices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and bidding documents of the Project. \nIn particular, all contracts financed by ADB under the Project will include provisions specifying \nthe  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  PMO,  PIUs,  and  all \ncontractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service  providers  related  to  the  Project.  The \nproject  design  and  implementation  arrangements  provide  for  mitigating  corruption  risks.  Risks \nassociated with project management, including procurement and disbursement, will be mitigated \nby  (i)  engaging  a  national  consultant  to  advise  and  assist  in  the  procurement  of  goods  and \nservices,  and  the  engagement  of  other  consultants;  (ii)  introducing  a  dual  signing  system  in \nwhich  the  contractor  awarded  the  contract  will  also  sign  an  anticorruption  contract  with  the \nemployer;  and  (iii)  periodic  inspection  by  the  PMO  of  the  contractor\u2019s activities  related  to  fund \nwithdrawals and settlements. In furtherance of the principles of transparency and accountability, \nSPG  will  cause  the  PMO  to  set  up  and  develop  a  project  website  to  provide  the  public  with \ninformation  on  the  Project,  including  (i)  a  summary  of  the  audited  financial  statements  of  the \nProject, and (ii) tracking of procurement contract awards in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines.  SPG  will  ensure  that  each  implementing  agency  establishes  financial  control  and \nmanagement arrangements compatible with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Financial Governance and \nManagement  of  Investment  Projects  Financed  by  ADB  and  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n59. \nThe  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook.  Because  some  of  the  payments  will  be  made  for  large  contracts, \nfunds  will  be  withdrawn  from  the  loan  account  using  direct  payment,  reimbursement,  and \ncommitment  procedures.  SFD  will  set  up  and  maintain  three  separate  project  imprest \naccounts\u2014one  for  the  loan  and  one  each  for  the  WFPF  and  GDCF  grants\u2014in  commercial \nbank(s) acceptable to ADB. To expedite the flow of funds and simplify document processing, the \nstatement of expenditure procedure may be used to reimburse, replenish, and liquidate eligible \nexpenditures  to  be  financed  from  the  loan  and  grant  imprest  accounts  for  any  individual \npayment not exceeding $200,000 for the loan, and $50,000 for WFPF and $30,000 for GDCF \ngrants  at  CFBs  and  township  finance  stations.  Payments  exceeding  this  ceiling  will  be \nreimbursed  based  on  the  full  documentation  process.  The  financial  management  assessment \nconcludes  that  SFD  and  a  sample  of  the  five  municipalities,  26  counties,  and  their  township \nfinance  stations  satisfy  ADB\u2019s  financial  management  requirements  for  municipalities  and \ncounties.  They  are  all  government  offices  in  the  hierarchy  under  MOF  and  have  satisfactory \nfinancial management capability. Disbursements from the imprest account will be supported by \nan  appropriate  withdrawal  application  and  related  documentation.  The  initial  amounts  to  be \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19\n\ndeposited in the loan and grant imprest accounts will not exceed the estimated expenditures to \nbe financed from each of the imprest accounts for the following 6 months of implementation or \n10% of the loan and respective grant amounts, whichever is lower. \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n60. \nFive  borrowing  agro-enterprises  and  other  government  agencies  involved  in  project \nimplementation  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  loan  and  grant  funds.  These  accounts \nand  related  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  by  an  independent  auditor  in \naccordance  with  auditing  standards  acceptable  to  ADB,  i.e.,  those  set  in  the  China  National \nAccounting  Law.25  The  PMO  will  verify  the  subproject  accounts  and  consolidate  for  the  entire \nProject. Within 6 months after the end of each fiscal year, the PMO will submit to ADB certified \ncopies  (in  English)  of  such  audited  project  accounts  and  financial  statements  and  auditor's \nreports. The participating agro-enterprises will also submit annual audited financial statements \nfor their operations, including income statements, balance sheets, and cash-flow statements to \nADB  through  the  PMO  within  6  months  after  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year.  The  audit  of  such \nfinancial statements will include (i) an assessment of the adequacy of  accounting and internal \ncontrol  systems  with  respect  to  project  expenditures  and  other  financial  transactions,  (ii)  an \nassessment  of  compliance  with \nfor  project \nmanagement,  (iii)  an  opinion  on  the  operation  of  the  imprest  account  and  on  the  use  of  the \nstatement of expenditure procedure, and (iv) a review of the execution of commitments between \nthe  participating  five  agro-enterprises  and  their  farm  production  bases.  The  PMO  will  prepare \nbrief quarterly and detailed semiannual reports. The quarterly reports will provide a summary of \nprogress  and  problems  encountered  based  on  the  outputs  of  the  PPMS  and  computerized \nsubloan  management  system,  and  activities  planned  for  the  next  quarter.  The  detailed  \nsemiannual  reports  will  provide  analysis  of  the  issues  encountered  and  steps  taken  to \nameliorate  the  situation.  Within  3  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  Project,  the  PMO  will \nsubmit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report  that  describes  achievements  in  relation  to  the \nProject\u2019s expected impact, outcome, and outputs. \n \n\nloan  covenants  and  ADB's  requirements \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \nTo  monitor  the  progress  of  the  Project  in  achieving  the  planned  outcome  and  outputs, \n61. \nthe  PMO  will  establish  and  maintain  a  computerized  PPMS,  which  will  be  designed  to  permit \nadequate flexibility to adopt remedial action regarding project design, schedules, activities, and \ndevelopment impacts. The PPMS will be based on targets outlined in the design and monitoring \nframework  (Appendix  1).  Considering  baseline  data  in  the  feasibility  study  reports,  the  PPMS \nwill  adopt  the  following  agreed  indicators:  (i)  progress  in  crop  and  livestock  production  by \nfarmers,  and  processing  and  marketing  by  agro-enterprises;  (ii)  changes  in  perennial  crop \nvarieties  and  yields;  (iii)  changes  in  application  methods  and  volume  of  water  used  in  various \nactivities;  (iv)  changes  in  type  and  application  rates  of  agrochemicals;  (v)  progress  in \nenvironmental management activities such as animal waste disposal; (vi) progress in capacity-\nbuilding in extension, training delivery, and outreach; (vii) strengthening of farmer organizations \nand  their  role  in  agricultural  products  supply  chains;  (viii)  increases  in  farm  incomes;  \n(ix)  reduction  in  poverty  incidence,  and  progress  in  gender  and  social  development;  \n(x)  improvement  in  soil  nutrient  content  and  water  quality;  and  (xi)  track  record  of  interest \npayment and recovery of subloans. The PMO, with support from consultants and in consultation \nwith  each  implementing  agency  and  agro-enterprise,  will  develop  comprehensive  PPMS \n\n                                                 \n25  These standards are comparable to those of International Financial Reporting Standards. The China National Audit \n\nOffice is an active member of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n          \n\nprocedures to systematically generate data on inputs and outputs of project activities, and the \nphysical,  socioeconomic,  and  environmental  indicators  to  measure  project  impacts.  Within  the \nPPMS  framework,  the  PMO  will  confirm  achievable  targets,  refine  monitoring  and  recording \narrangements, and establish systems and procedures no later than 6 months after the start of \nthe  Project.  Baseline  and  progress  data  will  be  reported  to  the  PMO  at  the  requisite  time \nintervals by the implementing agencies and concerned bureaus. The PMO will also collect oral \nhistories  from  a  sample  of  beneficiary  farmers  and  agro-enterprises  and  take  photographs  of \ninteresting activities. It will analyze and consolidate data and report the outcome to ADB through \nquarterly progress reports.  \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n \nIn  addition  to  regular  monitoring,  ADB  and  the  Government  will  jointly  review  project \n62. \nperformance at least once a year. The review will assess achievement of project outcomes and \noutputs,  financial  progress,  and  issues  and  constraints  affecting  implementation.  If  need  be, a \ntime-bound action plan for resolution of issues will be developed. ADB and the Government will \nundertake  a  midterm  review  during  year  3  of  the  Project  to  assess  implementation  status  and \ntake appropriate measures\u2014including modification of scope and implementation arrangements, \nand  reallocation  of  loan  proceeds,  as  appropriate\u2014to  achieve  the  Project\u2019s  outcomes  and \nimpact. During the midterm review, the subloan portfolio performance will be assessed, and the \noption of bundling and selling the loan portfolio in a bidding process to one or more commercial \nbanks will be considered. All subborrowers with on-time repayment history may also choose to \nhave their records disclosed to local financial institutions to improve their access to credit. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS  \n\n \nA. \n\nFarm Investments and Incomes \n\nThe  Project  will  support  a  range  of  investments  by  establishing  perennial  and  annual \n63. \ncrops,  livestock  rearing,  and  agroprocessing.  The  investments  will  range  from  CNY4,300  for \nimproved  millet  production  per  household  (average  farm  size  of  0.26  ha),  to  CNY528,000  for \nestablishing  on-farm  cold  storage  by  farmer  associations.  The  increase  in  farm  household \nincome  will  range  from  about  CNY5,300  to  CNY16,000  per  annum  depending  on  the  type  of \noperation;  on  average  about  a  30%  increase  in  household  income.  Financial  internal  rates  of \nreturn for all types of investments range from 15% to 20%, well above the estimated weighted \naverage costs of capital for each investment, which is around 5.1%.  \n\nB. \n\nFinancial Analysis of Agro-Enterprises \n\n64. \nThe  Project  will  support  investments  in  expanding  production  capacity  of  five  agro-\nenterprises (two engaged in fruit, and one each in millet, pork, and vegetable processing). Due \ndiligence of these agro-enterprises was undertaken to determine their eligibility to participate in \nthe  Project  based  on  socioeconomic,  environmental,  and  financial  criteria.  All  these  agro-\nenterprises (i) have been in operation for at least 4 years; (ii) are financially sound (based on an \nassessment of their last 3 years' audited financial statements); (iii) are privately owned; (iv) have \nprofessional  management  and  qualified  staff;  and  (v)  have  well-established  markets  both  at \nhome and in Europe and South-East Asia. The one for yellow millet products, supplies 40% of \nthe PRC market. Such investments will be financed by a mix of debt (from project loan funds) \nand equity. Loan financing will not exceed 50% of the total cost of each investment. Each agro-\nenterprise has confirmed availability of its equity to complement loan financing. The estimated \nfinancial internal rate of return of all five agro-enterprises ranges from 18% to more than 25%.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21\n\nC. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n65. \nConsidering economic net incremental benefits and establishment costs over 20 years, \nthe Project's economic internal rate of return is estimated to be 19.5%. The sensitivity analysis \nindicates  that  the  Project  is  robust  with  respect  to  decline  in  the  net  incremental  benefits  and \nrise  in  costs  from  individual  activities.  The  economic  and  financial  analyses  is  described  in \nAppendix 14 and more details are in Supplementary Appendix J. \n\nD. \n\nEnvironmental Benefits and Impacts \n\n66. \nThe Project will generate significant environmental benefits by helping farmers to adopt \nmodern  technologies  and  practices.  The  expansion  of  high-value  perennial  and  annual  crops \nwill  reduce  soil  erosion  in  sloped  areas,  improve  water-use  efficiency,  reduce  use  of \nagrochemicals,  and  produce  high-quality  and  safer  products.  The  estimated  annual  water \nsavings will be approximately 3.8 million m3. Fertilizer use is expected to be reduced by about \n2,300  tons/per  annum.  Environmental  benefits  will  not  be  even  across  all  project  counties. \nDepending  on  the  nature  and/or  number  of  activities,  a  net  increase  may  result  in  the  use  of \nwater and agrochemicals in certain counties. Net annual savings from reduced use of water and \nagrochemicals is expected to be around CNY15 million. Livestock activities will provide health \nbenefits by encouraging farmers to collectively manage their herds in larger facilities, improving \nhygienic conditions in living areas, and reducing soil degradation by limiting free-range grazing. \nLivestock waste, a major source of nonpoint source pollution in soil and water, will be disposed \noff  safely  either  by  composting  and/or  through  biogas  digesters  to  produce  clean  energy  for \ndomestic use.26 \n \n67. \nDue  to  increased  fruit-tree  production,  net  annual  pesticide  use  will  increase  by  about \n5.4 tons. Other potential adverse environmental impacts may stem from increased generation of \nagricultural  waste  and  construction  of  cold  storage  and  processing  capacity  for  five  agro-\nenterprises. The increase in waste production will be mitigated by adopting adequate treatment \nand disposal procedures. Construction impacts will be mitigated by applying a code of practice \nfor all construction works, as outlined in the environmental management plan. \n \nThe Project is classified as a category B environment project. During project preparation, \n68. \ninitial  environmental  examination  and  summary  initial  environmental  examination  reports  were \nprepared in accordance with the PRC regulations and ADB guidelines. A summary of findings \nand  recommendations  of  expected  benefits  and  impacts  are  presented  in  Appendix  15.  The \nsummary  initial  environmental  examination  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  K.  Due  diligence \nreview  of  environmental  management  practices  by  the  participating  24  agro-enterprises  was \nalso  undertaken  (Supplementary  Appendix  L).  The  review  shows  that  the  agro-enterprises \ncomply with all national regulations and apply adequate environmental management procedures \nacceptable to ADB.  \n\nE. \n\nEmployment Generation \n\nBased  on  incremental  labor  requirements  for  each  activity  and  assuming  300  working \n69. \ndays per year, approximately 10,900 person-years of employment will be generated annually at \nfull  development.  Of  these,  7,600  are  expected  to  be  generated  by  perennial  crop  cultivation, \n630  by  greenhouse  vegetables  and  annual  crops,  40  by  on-farm  processing,  and  2,700  by \nlivestock activities. In addition to this full-time employment, approximately 23,000 person-years \n\n                                                 \n26  There  is  an  active  market  for  compost  (average  price  CNY50\u2013CNY80/m3  depending  on  the  type)  in  the  project \n\narea, which ensures that it has well-managed processing, application, and/or marketing. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n          \n\nof  part-time  or  seasonal  employment  will  be  generated.  Of  this,  20,000  person-years  will  be \nrequired  for  establishing  perennial  crops  as  these  investments  will  require  labor  inputs  over  a \nnumber  of  years.  Much  of  the  labor  generated  will  be  provided  by  the  participating  farm \nhouseholds.  Some  unskilled  agricultural  work  will  be  available  to  nonparticipating  households. \nWith  the  return  of  migrant  workers  to  farms,  as  a  result  of  the  ongoing  financial  crisis  in  the \nindustry and mining sectors, employment generated by the Project will have a significant social \nand economic impact on the project area.   \n\nF. \n\nPoverty Impact  \n\n70. \nOf the 26 project counties, 11 are classified as poor, and 6 of the 11 are national priority \npoverty counties. As the PMO will be established at PADO, it will pay close attention to poverty \nreduction in the project area. The Project will support about 40,000 absolute poor and another \n25,000 low-income households. The Project will pay special attention to households headed by \nwomen,  identified  as  particularly  vulnerable.  The  annual  household  income  is  expected  to \nincrease by 30%, by about CNY6,000. A beneficiary absolute poor household (with a per-capita \nannual  income  of  less  than  CNY1,000)  can  expect  to  double  its  income.  And  a  low-income \nhousehold  can  expect  its  annual  per-capita  income  to  increase  from  CNY1,600  to  more  than \nCNY2,200. Higher income coupled with increased production capacity and enhanced technical \nskills will help vulnerable poor households to move out and remain out of poverty. The summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 16.  \n \nG. \n\nGender and Development \n\nTo  increase  gender  awareness,  training  will  be  provided  to  the  PMO,  PIUs,  and  TSA \n71. \nstaff  and  the  leaders  of  township  and  village  committees.  Women's  participation  in  project-\nrelated meetings and decision making will be actively encouraged. Women will elect their own \nrepresentatives for village councils to facilitate consultation and participation in project activities. \nACWF  will  monitor  project  benefits  for  women,  in  particular  poor  women  and  households \nheaded  by  women.  ACWF  will  be  included  in  the  project  leading  group,  and  its  county  and \nvillage chapters will receive training to improve mobilization and support to women.  \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  women  with  (i)  needs-based  training  to  adopt  modern  farm \n72. \nproduction  technology  and  access  markets;  and  (ii)  proportionate  assistance  from  project \nactivities, especially from subloans. The Project will create about 18,000 job opportunities for a \ntotal of 10,900 person-years; women are expected to take up about 12,000 jobs. Of the 300,000 \nperson-days of training to enhance farmers\u2019 technical knowledge, more than half are expected \nto be provided to women.27 A gender action plan is in Appendix 17.  \n \n73. \nThe  GDCF  grant  will  facilitate  women\u2019s  economic  empowerment  in  four  villages  of  two \npoverty  counties  by  (i)  setting  up  revolving  funds  for  microfinance;  (ii)  organizing  self-help \ngroups  linked  to  existing  farmer  associations  to  ensure  their  access  to  markets,  and  modern \nfarm  production  technology,  (iii)  providing  training  on  technical,  marketing,  and  alternative \nincome  generation  activities,  and  leadership  at  times  and  venues  convenient  for  women;  and \n(iv) capacity-building of county and village ACWF chapters to ensure sustainability of women\u2019s \nempowerment activities. For the first cycle of the GDCF pilot, 140 women will be organized in  \n20  production  groups  and  given  access  to  microfinance  through  a  group  guarantee  without \nrequiring collateral. This initiative, if successful, will be replicated in the Project.  \n \n\n                                                 \n27  The  Government's  Chinese  Women  Development  Program  (2001\u20132010),  approved  on  22  May  2001,  stipulates \n\nthat the proportion of women's share in training and job opportunities should remain at more than 40%. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n23\n\nH. \n\nResettlement \n\nThe Project does not require land acquisition or involuntary resettlement. The expansion \n\n74. \nof production systems and agroprocessing will be on existing land.  \n \nI. \n\nRisks and Mitigation Measures \n\n75. \nAt the macro level, the major risks to attaining project objectives relate to stable policies \ngoverning  private  sector  agricultural  production  and  processing,  sustainable  agricultural \ndevelopment,  and  poverty  reduction  in  rural  areas.  The  financial  sector's  failure  to  provide \ninvestment  capital  to  farmers  and  agro-enterprises  is  being  addressed  by  the  Project  in  the \nshort  term.  In  the  long  term,  sustainable  agricultural  development  will  be  constrained  unless \nrequisite policy and financial sector reforms are carried out. At the project level, the ability and \nwillingness of beneficiaries to respond to market opportunities will be critical to its success. This \nrisk  will  be  mitigated  through  farmer  training  to  strengthen  farmer\u2013market  linkages.  The \ninvolvement of 24 agro-enterprises in the Project will be instrumental in mitigating market risk. \nGiven  the  strong  domestic  and  global  demand  and  price  competitiveness  of  the  PRC's \nagricultural products, risks relating to the marketing of fresh and processed products are limited. \nProduction activities entail only limited technical risk, as both the project area farmers and agro-\nenterprises have experience in cultivating and processing related products. Farmers will also be \nable to adopt new technologies and practices through advisory service and training. \n\n76. \nFinally,  the  success  of  the  Project  will  also,  to  a  large  degree,  depend  on  its  effective \nimplementation by the PMO and PIUs and monitoring by ADB to identify potential problems and \ninitiate remedial measures at an early stage. This risk is largely mitigated as the PMO and PIUs \nare already established at each level of government, and have gained experience from previous \nintegrated agricultural development projects. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  SPG  have  given  the \n\n \n77. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents.28 SPG will ensure that  \n \n\nInvoluntary  resettlement.  SPG,  PIUs,  and  participating  enterprises  will  ensure \nthat the activities do not result in involuntary resettlement. \n\nGender  development.  Women  have  equal  access  to  project  benefits  and  they \n(a)  receive  proportionate  assistance  from  project  activities,  especially  access  to \nproject  subloans,  (b)  get  at  least  a  40%  share  in  employment  and  training \nopportunities,  (c)  sign  subloan  agreements,  and  (d)  are  consulted  in  all  project-\nrelated  events  and  minutes  are  recorded  to  monitor  their  participation  in \nmeetings.  Moreover,  ACWF  is  a  member  of  the  project  leading  group  and \ninvolved  in  project  implementation  in  villages  and  the  PMO  collects  data  to \nmonitor gender targets set to ensure women's participation in project activities. \n\nEnvironment.

The majority \nof crop production originates from small farms averaging 0.65 hectares (ha). While a large part \nof  livestock  production  also  comes  from  small,  part-time  \u201cbackyard\u201d  operations,  full-time \n\u201cspecialized\u201d household and commercial operations have grown rapidly. While the contribution \nof agriculture to gross domestic product decreased to about 11% in 2008, from 27% in 1990, it \ncontinues to be the major source of employment for about 725 million rural population.   \n\n2. \nThe  economic  policy  reforms,  started  in  1978,  brought  about  remarkable  progress  in \nagriculture. The annual average agricultural growth rate over the first 20 years was about 6.5%. \nBy  1999,  agricultural  production  showed  significant  improvement  with  the  output  of  grain  at  \n508  million  tons  (67%  increase),  cotton  4  million  tons  (77%),  and  oilseeds  26  million  tons \n(400%)  over  1978.  Similarly,  the  output  of  meat  (60  million  tons)  increased  sevenfold  and \naquatic products (41 million tons) ninefold from 1978. As a result, the chronic shortage of major \nagricultural  products  was  finally  overcome.  The  policy  reforms  consisted  of  (i)  increasing \nprocurement  prices  for  grains,  (ii)  allowing  farmers  to  sell  above  quota  production  at  market \nprices,  (iii)  lowering  grain  quotas,  (iv)  increasing  grain  imports,  and  (v)  expanding  private \ninterprovincial  trade.  But  the  most  important  feature  of  the  reforms  has  been  the  \u201chousehold \nresponsibility system,\u201d in which collective land was contracted to households for up to 30 years \nand  the  local  governments  took  strong  initiatives  to  transfer  production  decisions  from \ncommunes \nthe  establishment  of \ndragonheads1 that are now a major source of nonfarm employment for off-season rural labor. \n\nto  households.  Economic  reforms  also  encouraged \n\nB. \n\nAgriculture in Shanxi Province \n\n3. \nAgricultural Development Policies and Plans. The 11th Five-Year Development Plan \nfor  Provincial  Economy  and  Social  Development  calls  to  strengthen  agricultural  infrastructure, \nand develop fruit, forest, vegetable, and livestock industries. In accordance with the Principles \non Further Enhancing Agricultural Restructuring formulated by the Shanxi provincial government \n(SPG) in 2000, strategic guidelines were formulated to promote steady development of pork and \npoultry production, and accelerate development of beef and mutton production. In line with the \n11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010) of the PRC, SPG has supported 59 counties in two economic \nzones (north Shanxi and central and southern Shanxi) to promote socioeconomic development \nin rural areas and to improve farmer incomes particularly in poverty counties. The plan includes \nthe following targets: (i) defining agricultural production zones, (ii) maintaining production bases \nof  essential  commodities,  (iii) fast-tracking  the  introduction  of  high-value  annual  and  perennial \ncrops and breeding livestock, (iv) improving irrigation efficiency, (v) upgrading technical services \nto support transition to high-value production, and (vi) improving environmental management.  \n\n4. \nClimate, Soil, and Water. Shanxi is situated in the northwest of the country and in the \nmiddle  reaches  of  the  Yellow  River  and  eastern  part  of  the  Loess  Plateau.  Shanxi  consists  of \nmountains in the east, plateaus in the west, and basins in the middle. The mountains account \nfor 35% of the land area, hills 45%, and plateaus 20%. The capital, Taiyuan, is the largest city \nand  the  main  industrial  center.  The  province  has  short  and  mild  winters.  The  mean  annual \ntemperature  ranges  from  3.60C  to  13.80C.  The  annual  rainfall  in  the  province  is  between  \n                                                 \n\n1  Dragonheads  are  contract-farming  agroprocessing  firms  set  up  with  the  technical  and  financial  assistance  of  the \ngovernment.  These  firms  are  designated  by  different  levels  of  government\u2014national,  provincial,  municipal  or \ncounty\u2014based  on  their  financial  strength,  scale  of  operations,  level  of  technology,  management,  and  potential  to \nimprove farm incomes. Dragonheads at national or provincial level normally receive government support or subsidy, \nparticularly financing from the Agricultural Development Bank of China. \n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\n         Appendix 2 \n\n \n\n400  and  650  millimeters.  But  it  is  not  evenly  distributed;  about  60%  of  the  total  rainfall  is \nreceived from July to September. Shanxi has an area of about 156,000 square kilometers (km2) \nand  population  of  about  33  million.  It  only  has  about  3.8  million  ha  of  arable  land\u2014of  modest \nquality  and  productivity\u2014for  its  23 million  rural  population.  The  majority  of  farmers  practice \ntraditional  agriculture  mostly  growing  staple  crops,  i.e.,  wheat  and  maize,  that  generate  low \nincome  per  unit  of  land  and  require  extensive  use  of  agrochemicals  and  irrigation  water. \nTransition to high-value production will increase farm productivity and household incomes, and \nimprove environmental management. \n\n1. \n\nHigh-Value Agricultural Products \n\n5. \nWalnuts.  Shanxi  ranks  first  in  exports  and  second  in  total  walnut  production  in  the \ncounty. Production increased from less than 47,000 tons in 2000 to about 70,000 tons in 2008. \nHowever, processing has lagged the growth in production because of variability in quality of raw \nwalnuts. The PRC has a long tradition of walnut exports and accounted for 40%\u201350% of world \ntrade  in  the  1960s.  The  growth  in  the  United  States  (US)  production  in  the  1970s  negatively \naffected  PRC  exports  and  its  share  declined  to  20%\u201330%.  However,  by  2005,  the  PRC's \nposition  in  export  markets  recovered  and  exceeded  that  of  the  US  when  the  PRC  exported \n60,000  tons  (20%  of  its  production)  and  the  US  exported  50,000  tons  (30%  of  its  production). \nShanxi  accounted  for  60%  of  PRC  exports.  With  the  rise  in  disposable  incomes  in  the  PRC, \ndomestic  demand  is  expected  to  grow.  The  United  Nations  forecasts  that  over  the  next  \n10 years, world demand for walnuts will grow by 10% annually. Therefore, Shanxi is well placed \nto take advantage of these opportunities by expanding walnut production and processing, and \nensuring high quality and safety of its products. \n\nFresh  and  Processed  Apples  and  Fruits.  The  demand  for  fresh  apples  and  apple \n6. \nproducts resulted in an almost six-fold increase in production in the PRC over the last 15 years; \nan average annual growth rate of over 12%. In the same period, apple production in the rest of \nthe  world  remained  almost  unchanged.  Growth  in  the  PRC  apple  production  is  expected  to \ncontinue to 2015 contributing to more than a 60% increase in world apple production. Most of \nthe  future  growth  in  production in  the  PRC  is expected  to  result  from  increases in  productivity \nrather than expansion in the area. Similarly, world demand for apple concentrate is expected to \ncontinue growing. With infrastructure development in rural areas and increasing product quality, \ninternational competitiveness of the PRC's processed apple products will be strengthened. PRC \napple  exports  are  projected  to  grow  to  over  943,000  tons  by  2015.  Exports  of  fruit  products, \nincluding  apples,  from  Shanxi  have  grown  dramatically  in  recent  years,  increasing  from  about \n33,000 tons in 2003 to more than 90,000 tons in 2008, an average annual growth rate of 36%, \nexceeding that of the PRC, which was 9.7% in the same period. \n\n7. \nChinese  Date  (red  jujube).  This  is  a  traditional  product  with  medicinal  and  nutritional \nqualities that add to its popularity. Although other countries such as the Republic of Korea have \ntried to develop Chinese date production, 98% of the world's total cultivated area is in the PRC. \nWhile the fruit is exported to more than 20 countries in Europe, North America, Australasia, and \nthe  Middle  East,  Chinese  dates  are  largely  consumed  by  Chinese  communities  in  these \ncountries. By far, the largest market is domestic, which accounts for 98% of Chinese date sales. \nIn spite of a doubling of output in recent years, there is no indication of oversupply. In Shanxi, \nfor  many  years,  date  production  was  mainly  of  low  quality  varieties  that  did  not  provide  much \nprofit for farmers. Government initiatives for the last few years have promoted diversification into \nhigh-quality  varieties  for  which  demand  is  strong  and  expected  to  grow.  Shanxi  also  has  a \nmodern  date-processing  industry  accounting  for  50%  of  national  production.  Shanxi  plans  to \nincrease the area from about 370,000 ha in 2006 to 540,000 ha by 2010.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                                 Appendix 2                                        \n\n31\n\n8. \nLivestock Products. Although the PRC is a major exporter of live pigs and processed \npork products, more than 300,000 tons in 2008, it also imports about the same volume of pork \nproducts. In recent years, Shanxi has been a net importer of pigs and pork products from other \nprovinces;  especially  after  the  2006\u20132007  blue-ear  epidemic  (also  known  as  Porcine \nReproductive  and  Respiratory  Syndrome)  outbreak,  which  resulted  in  significant  market  and \nprice  instability.  SPG  took  immediate  steps  to  contain  the  outbreak  and  provided  longer-term \nstability to support the local pig industry. With increasing urbanization and disposable incomes, \ndemand for pork, poultry, and beef products is expected to grow significantly. Environmentally \nsafe  and  hygienic  production  practices,  product  safety  and  quality  at  processing,  and  efficient \nmarketing practices will be the key to future development of the livestock industry in Shanxi. \n\n \n\n2. \n\nFarm\u2013Market Linkages  \n\nA survey of marketing systems in the project area conducted during project preparation \n9. \nindicates a wide range of marketing channels for agricultural products. The main channels are \neither  brokers  or  farmer  associations.  The  project  area  has  about  270,000  brokers  or  farmer \nagents; a majority run small-scale operations in specific locations or for a particular product or \nmarket niche. Only around 4,500 brokers are of a larger scale, with annual turnover in excess of \nCNY100,000,  and  with  an  average  customer  base  of  around  30,000  farmers.  About  1,220 \nregistered  intermediary  agencies,  such  as  farmer  associations,  deal  with  a  variety  of \ncommodities\u2014their  coverage  and  effectiveness  varies.  In  some  areas,  associations  are  well \ndeveloped and about half of local farmers are members. For others, coverage is lower with only \nabout 10% of area farmers as members. In addition, the area has 18,000 farmer cooperatives \n(with 220,000 members), 611 registered technical associations, 92 wholesale markets, and 146 \nrural markets. \n\n10. \nA small but significant marketing channel for project area farmers is through 575 agro-\nenterprises that process produce for sale in local, national, and international markets. Of these, \n195 have established production bases. About 250 have turnovers in excess of CNY1.0 million \n($130,000).  The  province  has  a  general  shortage  of  storage  capacity.  The  Department  of \nAgriculture  estimates  that  for  fruit,  total  storage  capacity  is  150  million  tons  while  the  annual \noutput is around 500 million tons. The project area survey identifies key marketing constraints \nfaced  by  farmers,  including  (i)  need  for  improved  linkages  with  agro-enterprises  to  provide \nalternative outlets, (ii) more effective role by farmer associations, (iii) improved access to market \nand price information, and (iv) improved access to advice on marketing. \n\n3. \n\nRural Finance \n\nFinancial markets in Shanxi are going through similar developments as those in the rest \n11. \nof  the  country  since  2005.  Financial  institutions  in  the  PRC  include  four  large  state-owned \nbanks,  a  postal  savings  bank,  urban  commercial  banks,  and  rural  cooperative  banks.  Others \ninclude  microcredit  companies,  nongovernment  organization  microfinance  institutions,  rural \ncredit  cooperatives  (RCCs),  and  lending  companies.  In  addition,  credit  to  the  rural  sector  is \nprovided  by  the  municipal  and  county  finance  bureaus  from  funds  provided  by  the  provincial \nbudget, Poverty Alleviation and Development Office, and international projects. \n\nThe  main  rural  financial  institutions  are  the  Agriculture  Bank  of  China,  the  Agricultural \n12. \nDevelopment Bank of China, the RCCs, and the Postal Savings Bank. For the last 4 years, the \nAgriculture Bank of China has been consolidating its services and focusing on profitability and \nefficiency of loan operations. Accordingly, it has closed numerous rural branches and restricted \nlending operations to a centralized system, including lending only 50%\u201360% of deposit bases in \nrural  areas  in  Shanxi.  The  Agricultural  Development  Bank  of  China  currently  has  insufficient \nfunds  or  offices  to  expand  services  for  agricultural  transformation  of  the  type  proposed  under \nthe Project. RCCs in Shanxi are in the early stages of transformation to become more efficient \ninstitutions. These reforms have been completed in only four counties. Other county RCCs are \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\n         Appendix 2 \n\n \n\nunable to mobilize sufficient liquidity or staff capacity to provide new lending services of the type \nproposed  under  the  Project\u2014long-term  loans  to  support  farmers'  transition  to  high-value \nproduction  bases  and  expand  agro-enterprise  operations.  These  financial  institutions  lend  for \nshort periods, generally require significant collateral, and lend largely to state-owned enterprises \nand  large  firms.  Studies  in  the  PRC  show  that  small  urban  and  rural  enterprises  are  able  to \nfinance  only  about  20%  of  their  needs  from  formal  financial  institutions.  Loans  are  provided \nmainly to big firms and those in urban areas with large fixed assets. In the PRC, firms are still \nborrowing  largely  from  the  informal  market,  almost  43%  overall  compared  with  about  9%  in \ncomparable countries.  \n\n13. \nThree key issues that have affected access to rural finance in Shanxi and elsewhere in \nthe  PRC  are  (i)  interest  rate  control,  (ii)  methods  to  assess  and  manage  credit  risk,  and  \n(iii) availability of collateral or security. The Government has employed the interest rate control \npolicy  as  a  means  to  prevent  usurious  practices  and  protect  farmers  and  rural  households. \nHowever,  it  has  also  had  the  unintended  impact  of  limiting  the  development  of  loan  products \nthat  are  more  suitable  to  farmers'  needs.  Recently,  additional  flexibility  was  provided  to  banks \nand  nonbank  financial  institutions  in  the  application  of  interest  rate  rules.  However,  the \nintroduction of new products has been slow. \n\n14. \nThe availability of collateral is a significant problem for agro-enterprises and farmers who \nwish  to  undertake  substantial  capital  investment.  Financial  institutions  are  innovating  by  using \ngroup  guarantee  arrangements  and  cash  flow  analysis  of  firms.  In  rural  areas,  land  is  not \nindividually owned and cannot be used as collateral by households. The province does not have \na system of fixed asset valuations operating in rural areas; many agro-enterprises are new, and \nno history of comparable developments and sales is available to help banks realistically assess \nthe collateral value. Accordingly, smaller agro-enterprises have difficulty securing loans. \n\n15. \nThe Project will fill financial product gaps in rural lending by taking five initiatives. First, \nmedium to long-term loans (1.5\u20138 years) will be provided to households to make a transition to \nproducing high-value products. Such long-term financing is currently not available to farmers or \nagro-enterprises from financial institutions, and will enable them to make significant investments \nand increase household incomes over time. Second, loan security will be provided using group \nguarantees.  The  24  participating  agro-enterprises  will  buy  back  farm  outputs  and  provide  a \nguarantee  for  beneficiary  farmers.  The  village  leaders  will  provide  guarantee  for  poor \nhouseholds that have not borrowed previously but have capacity and character to borrow. Fixed \nassets  will  be  pledged  for  loans  to  agro-enterprises.  The  borrower  selection  process  will  be \nsimilar to that of risk assessments by financial institutions, except that the local finance bureaus \nwill manage the process and take the risk. The loan portfolio will be managed the same way as \nby  financial  institutions,  demonstrating  the  creditworthiness  of  borrowers.  Third,  the  proposed \nloans  to  five  agro-enterprises  will  enable  them  to  increase  their  capital  base  and  expand \noperations. The due diligence review has been completed, confirming that they have the interest \nand  capacity  to  use  funds  appropriately  and  repay  on  time  and  in  full.  Data  shows  that  these \nagro-enterprises have accessed funds from informal sources and (for two) from the Agriculture \nBank of China in smaller amounts and have a good credit history. Fourth, the loans to farmers \nwill be disbursed rather than reimbursed. Poor farmers, who do not have cash at hand to make \nthe initial purchases, can receive funds and use them to make the necessary input payments. \nFifth, if borrowers wish, tracking and reporting data will be provided to financial institutions. This \nwill help borrowers develop a credit history that can be shared with formal financial institutions. \nWith  a  good  credit  history,  both  agro-enterprises  and  farm  households  can  go  to  financial \ninstitutions to seek credit to expand their operations in the future.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nDonor\n\nAsian Development Bank\n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE \n\nProject Title \n\nHexian Pulp Mill \nAgricultural Bank of China\nGuangdong Tropical Crops Development\nYunnan-Simao Forestation and Sustainable Wood Utilization\nSecond Agricultural Bank of China\nHainan Agriculture and Natural Resources Development\nFujian Soil Conservation and Rural Development\nZhejiang-Shanxi Water Supply Project (Phase I)\nNortheast Flood Damage Rehabilitation: Inner\nMongolia Autonomous Region\nNortheast Flood Damage Rehabilitation: Heilongjiang Province\nNortheast Flood Damage Rehabilitation: Jilin Province\nWest Henan Agriculture Development \nYellow River Flood Management \nSonghua River Flood Control Management Sector \nEfficient Utilization of Agricultural Wastes Project \nFujian Soil Conservation and Rural Development II\nSanjiang Plain Wetlands Protection\nHunan Flood Management Sector\nHenan Sustainable Agriculture and Productivity Improvement\n\nWorld Bank\n\nHenan Agriculture Development\nHenan Highway \nLoess Plateau Watershed Rehabilitation   \nYangtze Basin Water Resources \nHenan Provincial Highway  \nShanxi Poverty Alleviation  \nSeed Sector Commercialization \nAnning Valley Agricultural Development \nSmallholder Cattle Development \nSecond Loess Plateau Watershed Rehabilitation  \nForestry Development Project in Poor Area\nThird Henan Provincial Highway \nWater Conservation \nHenan Towns Water Supply and Sanitation\n\nJapan Bank for International Cooperation\n \n\nHuai River Henan Water Pollution Control \nHenan Panshitou Reservoir Construction \nXinxiang\u2013Zhengzhou Highway Construction\nHenan Environment Protection \nInland Henan Higher Education\nPublic Health Project (Henan Province) \nHenan Province Afforestation \n\nKfW Sino-Germany Finance Cooperation\n\nHenan Province Small Household Afforestation \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n33\n\nYear\n\n1988\n1990\n1992\n1994\n1995\n1995\n1995\n1997\n\n1999\n1999\n1999\n2001\n2001\n2002\n2002\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n\n1991\n1993\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1996\n1996\n1999\n1999\n1999\n1999\n2000\n2000\n2006\n\n1997\n1998\n2000\n2003\n2003\n2004\n2006\n\n2004\n\nAmount\n($ million)\n\n           \n           \n           \n           \n         \n           \n           \n         \n\n49.60\n50.00\n55.00\n77.00\n100.00\n53.00\n65.00\n100.00\n\n         \n         \n         \n           \n         \n         \n           \n           \n           \n         \n           \n\n110.00\n110.00\n110.00\n69.23\n150.00\n150.00\n33.12\n80.00\n15.00\n200.00\n66.70\n\n110.00\n120.00\n100.00\n210.00\n210.00\n100.00\n80.00\n120.00\n93.50\n100.00\n4.90\n150.00\n78.00\n150.00\n\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n           \n         \n           \n         \n             \n         \n           \n         \n(\u00a5 million)\n      \n      \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n($ million)\n             \n\n4,945.00\n6,734.00\n23,491.00\n19,295.00\n4,699.00\n5,016.00\n7,343.00\n\n3.43\n\n \n\n\f34 \n\n         Appendix 4 \n\n \n\nCRITERIA TO SELECT PROJECT COUNTIES, SITES, AND ACTIVITIES \n\n \n1. \nThe following design parameters and guiding principles were employed to select project \ncomponents,  sites,  activities,  and  investment  proposals;  and  will  be  used  to  select  beneficiary \nhouseholds.  \n \n2. \nsupport based on the following criteria: \n \n\nThe 26 participating counties in five municipalities were identified as eligible for project \n\nSocial dimensions: (a) poverty rates are more than 50%, and (b) no involuntary \nland acquisition and/or resettlement is required. \nEnvironmental  sustainability:  have  potential  for  (a)  water-saving  irrigation \nsystems,  (b)  reduced  use  of  agrochemicals  and  increased  use  of  organic \ncompost,  and  (c)  perennial  fruit  and  tree  crops  on  hilly  slopes  greater  than  25 \ndegrees. \nFlow  of  funds:  have  a  mechanism  for  providing  subloans  to  participating \nfarmers through finance bureaus with some prior experience and capacity. \n\nThe following criteria were adopted to select project sites and activities: \n\n \n3. \n \n\nFocus: the activities (a) have a critical mass to take advantage of economies of \nscale,  and  (b)  can  be  efficiently  and  effectively  implemented  with  minimum \nexternal supervision. \nPotential  for  transition:  considerable  potential  for  improving  productivity  and \nexpanding production of high-value annual crops, perennial crops and trees, and \nlivestock that significantly improve farmer incomes. \nVoluntary participation: farm households and agro-enterprises participate on a \nvoluntary basis, and have independent associations and executive bodies.  \nPoverty  intervention:  activities  focus  on  poverty  reduction  to  comply  with  the \nnational  priorities  and  strategies  and  Asian  Development  Bank  policies  and \ncountry strategy with particular attention to vulnerable groups such as the poor, \nhandicapped, and households headed by women.  \nGender  equity:  women  have  equal  access  to  project  funds  and  training \nopportunities. \nEnvironmental sustainability: activities promote environmental protection, and \nconserving  soil  and  water  resources;

Financial  and \nenvironmental due diligence was carried out. Proposed investments will be further reviewed to \nensure  eligibility  and  financial  viability  at  the  time  of  their  application  for  project  loan  funds. \nCriteria used to identify the five agro-enterprises include the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nThe objectives of the agro-enterprise\u2019s business plans are consistent with those \nof the Shanxi 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010). \nThe loan amount to an agro-enterprise must not exceed half of the total project \nloan received by the county in which agro-enterprise is located. \nThe agro-enterprise must at least match the project loan amount with funds from \nother sources for the development of its investment proposal. \nThe agro-enterprise must provide appropriate collateral in physical assets equal \nto at least 125% of the proposed project loan value. \nPrior to and for the duration of the loan term, the agro-enterprise must maintain a \ndebt\u2013equity  ratio  not  exceeding  1.5  (60:40),  a  debt  service  capacity  ratio  of  at \nleast 1.5, and a current ratio of at least 1.2. \nThe  agro-enterprise's  investment  must  not  involve  an  expansion  of  more  than \nthree times its capacity at the time of loan application. \nThe  proposed  investment  must  be  financially  sound,  including  demand  and  risk \nanalysis, and demonstrate a financial internal rate of return in excess of the agro-\nenterprise's weighted average cost of capital. \n\n(viii)  The enterprise must have in place sound accounting and financial management \n\n(x) \n\n(ix) \n\n(xi) \n\ninformation systems to help monitor the performance of the investment. \nThe agro-enterprise must have access to water and land rights necessary for its \noperation. \nThe  agro-enterprise  must  have  transparent,  effective,  and  mutually  beneficial \narrangements  with  households  under  contracts  clearly  indicating  input\u2013output \nsupply arrangements, procedures for determining procurement prices, and rights \nand responsibilities of both parties in the event of a dispute. \nThe agro-enterprise must facilitate (a) an increase in the production base and the \nnumber  of  participating  farm  households,  (b)  an  improvement  in  crop  yields  on \nthe  existing  production  base,  and  (c)  use  of  environmentally  sound  production \npractices to reduce use of irrigation water and agrochemicals. \ntreatment  and \nThe  enterprise  must  have  or \nenvironmental management systems that comply with all national and provincial \nstandards (demonstrated by Environmental Protection Bureau certification). \n(xiii)  The proposed investment must meet national, provincial, and local environmental \nstandards;  must  not  generate  waste  or  result  in  any  adverse  environmental \nimpacts that cannot be mitigated; and, where necessary, must incorporate in its \ndesign and costs measures to ensure environmental mitigation. \n\ninstall  appropriate  waste \n\n(xii) \n\n(xiv)  The  proposed  investment  will  be  subjected  to  an  environmental  examination \ncarried  out  in  accordance  with  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003) of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). The resulting environmental assessment report must \nbe approved by the appropriate provincial authorities.  \nThe  agro-enterprise  must  comply  with  all  local,  national,  and  ADB  safeguard \nrequirements, as specified in relevant local and national policies and regulations, \nand ADB safeguards policies and guidelines. \n\n(xv) \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                    Appendix 7 \n\n39\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION THROUGH GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT \n\ntechniques;  and \n\n \n1. \nThe  total  cost  of  this  demonstration  project  is  estimated  at  $600,000  equivalent.  The \nMulti-Donor  Trust  Fund  under  the  Water  Financing  Partnership  Facility  (WFPF)1  will  provide \ngrant cofinancing equivalent to $500,000. The Government will provide the remaining $100,000 \nequivalent  to  cover  in-kind  counterpart  costs  and  services.  The  WFPF  grant  will  support \nconsulting services, water-saving equipment for irrigation and groundwater monitoring, training \nand workshops, and contingencies and reporting. Three individual consultants will be engaged \nto  implement  the  demonstration  project:  an  irrigation  specialist  and  team  leader  (national),  a \nhydrogeologist  (national),  and  a  water  resources  specialist  (international).  A  more  detailed \nconcept note is provided in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n2. \nThe  demonstration  project  will  be  implemented  over  2  years  from  January  2010  to \nDecember 2011. The project management office in Taiyuan will be responsible for the day-to-\nday  operations  and  coordination  with  the  participating  municipal  and  county  water  resources \nbureaus (WRBs). The activities will assist farmers to cope with dwindling groundwater resources \nresulting  from  overuse  and  climate  change,  while  maintaining  or  increasing  their  farm \nproductivity and income. The impact will be sustainable use of groundwater resources in the 26 \nproject  counties.  The  outcome  will  be  the  sustainable  application  of  water  conservation \ntechniques  and  improved  water  resources  management  in  five  project  counties  where \ngroundwater scarcity is acute. \n \nThe outputs will include (i) demonstration of more productive, efficient, and economical \n3. \nirrigation \nthrough  effective \nimplementation of national and provincial regulations and capacity building. These initiatives will \nprovide  examples\u2014replicable  in  other  project  and  nonproject  counties  of  Shanxi  and  other \nprovinces\u2014of  improved  groundwater  management  to  adapt  to  climate  change  impacts.  The \nexperience and findings will be presented in a national workshop in Shanxi and summarized in \nan Asian Development Bank knowledge product. \n \n4. \nThe  participating  farmers  will  be  supported  to  adopt  water-saving  technologies, \nespecially  drip  irrigation.  Activities  include  support  for  purchasing  and  installing  water-saving \nand  monitoring  equipment.  Support  will  focus  on  poor  households  that  will  borrow  from  the \nProject  to  make  a  transition  to  high-value  and  less  water-demanding  crops.  About  150  poor \nhouseholds  will  be  provided  with  a  subsidy  to  purchase  water-saving  irrigation  equipment  to \ndefray  the  marginal  cost  that  may  be  over  and  above  the  cost  of  their  traditional  irrigation \nsystem.  The  subsidy  will  encourage  them  to  adopt  modern  irrigation  technology  without \nadditional  cost,  and  show-case  the  benefits  of  this  technology  to  other  farm  households.  The \ncapacity-building  activity  will  implement  a  training  program  for  WRBs  to  learn  improved \nirrigation,  surveying,  and  monitoring  techniques.  The  program  will  also  develop  and  conduct \ndirect  and  indirect  skills  training  of  an  estimated  5,000  farmers  to  adopt  modern  and \nenvironmentally sound water-saving techniques.   \n \n5. \nMost  farmers  involved  in  the  Project  will  use  groundwater  for  irrigation.  To  improve \ngroundwater management, the demonstration project will strengthen the provincial groundwater \nmonitoring system, including support to update the inventory of current groundwater usage and \ndemand  estimates.  WRBs  will  develop  groundwater  management  alternatives  based  on \ngroundwater  supply  and  demand;  and  support  for  implementing  the  regulatory  framework, \nincluding the preparation of a strategy to address water-related climate change adaptation in the \nprovince and a study on possible economic incentives to promote water savings. \n\nimproved  groundwater  governance \n\n(ii) \n\n                                                 \n1 Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, and Spain. \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\n         Appendix 8 \n\n \n\nWOMEN\u2019S ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT PILOT PROJECT \n \n\n1. \nIn rural areas of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), women are increasingly taking \ncharge  of  agriculture.  Shanxi  is  no  exception.  More  than  35%  of  men  migrate  seasonally  or \npermanently  to  urban  centers  or  coal  mines,  leaving  women  to  manage  agricultural  and \nlivestock  production  and  marketing,  as  well  as  household  and  family  responsibilities.  Despite \ntheir  considerable  contribution,  women  are  not  getting  sufficient  economic  benefits.  Women \naccount for 44% of the total labor force in the 26 project counties. However, in 13 counties, the \npercentage  of  women  engaged  in  paid  labor  activities  is  only  11%\u201321%.1  This  implies  that \nwomen are primarily engaged in household chores and small-scale backyard animal rearing or \nsporadic crop farming that does not generate significant cash income. Supporting rural women \nto  realize  higher  income  contributes  to  improved  overall  social  welfare.  Moreover,  greater \neconomic  power  shifts  the  gender  dynamics,  helping  women  exert  their  rights,  voice  their \nneeds, and play a greater role in planning and decision-making.  \n \n2. \nA  pilot  project  to  enhance  economic  empowerment  of  poor  rural  women  was  prepared \nfor  estimated  $285,000  equivalent.  The  Gender  and  Development  Cooperation  Fund2  will \nprovide  grant  cofinancing  equivalent  to  $195,000.  The  Government  will  provide  the  remaining \n$90,000 equivalent to cover in-kind counterpart costs and services. The proposed pilot aims to \nenhance women\u2019s access to economic opportunities through a modified village banking model \nthat combines microfinance and collective purchase and sale of agricultural products. The pilot \nproject will be implemented over 2 years, from January 2010 to December 2011, in four villages \nof Daning and Liulin counties where poverty and male out-migration rates are high.  \n \nThe impact of the pilot project is the advancement of gender equality through women\u2019s \n3. \neconomic  empowerment  in  Shanxi.  The  outcome  is  women\u2019s  enhanced  access  to  economic \nopportunities  in  target  villages  through  support  to  women\u2019s  production  groups  and  capacity \nbuilding. The pilot has three components (i) building capacity for women\u2019s production and village \nto  women\u2019s  production  groups,  and  \nbanking  groups; \n(iii)  strengthening  the  capacity  of  local  government  agencies  including  the  All  China  Women's \nFederation and the project management office to support women's economic empowerment.  \n \nUnder  the  pilot  project,  in  the  first  cycle,  about  20  women's  production  groups  (five \n4. \ngroups in each of the four villages, seven women in each group) will be organized and trained. \nA  revolving  fund,  for  about  $100,000  equivalent,  will  be  set  up  to  extend  microfinance  (about \nCNY5,000  or  $730  per  women),  to  individuals  but  guaranteed  by  the  group.  Loan  delivery, \napproval, and repayment processes will be managed by setting up microfinance cooperatives. A \nnongovernment  organization  will  be  engaged  to  provide  (i)  technical  training  to  beneficiary \nwomen,  (ii)  support  to  form  microfinance  cooperatives,  and  (iii)  appropriate  training  to  project \nmanagement  office  and  local  government  officials.  A  nongovernment  organization  will  be \nengaged following the single-source selection procedure because this is a specialized task and \nthe engagement will be undertaken through direct negotiations. Upon completion of the pilot, an \nevaluation will examine the efficacy of the model and ways to improve, sustain, and scale it up \nwithin the Project. A national individual consultant will be engaged for monitoring and evaluation \nactivities.  An  indicative  implementation  schedule  and  more  details  of  the  pilot  project  are \nprovided in the concept note in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n\n(ii)  providing  microfinance \n\n                                                 \n1  Source: Socioeconomic household survey conducted by the project management office in May 2007.

Subloan  approval \nauthority will be delegated to the municipal or county finance bureaus (MFBs, CFBs). Subloan \nterms  are  set  out  in  the  Project  Agreement.  Subloans  to  farmers  will  be  made  in  cash  by  the \nrespective  CFBs.  Priority  will  be  given  to  those  who  are  designated  by  the  Poverty  Alleviation \nand Development Office (PADO) as poverty households if they also meet the Project's selection \ncriteria (Appendix 4). Individual farmers will submit subloan applications to their local township \nfinance  station  (TFS),  which  will  undertake  an  initial  assessment  of  eligibility.  Eligible \napplications  will  be  reviewed  by  the  relevant  Project  Implementation  Units  and  forwarded  to \nCFBs  for  approved.  Subloans  in  excess  of  the  CFB's  lending  authority  will  be  reviewed,  and \nwhere applicable, forwarded to the relevant MFB with a recommendation for approval. \n \n2. \nOnce  a  subloan  is  approved,  the  CFB  will  enter  into  a  subloan  agreement  with  the \napplicant,  which  will  include  the  method  of  disbursement.  For  farmers,  the  applicable  subloan \narrangements  will  include  (i)  a  subloan  agreement  between  the  farmer  and  CFB;  (ii)  as \nappropriate, an agreement between each farmer and the concerned agro-enterprise as buyer of \nfarm  output  and  loan  guarantor;  and  (iii)  as  appropriate,  an  agreement  between  the  agro-\nenterprise  and  CFB  regarding  the  agro-enterprise's  guarantee  of  the  concerned  subloan \nrepayment. Draft model subloan agreements are in Supplementary Appendix D. Disbursement \nof subloans will be channeled from the CFB to the TFS, then directly to the farmer in cash but \ndrawn through a bank debit card.1 Subloan principal repayments for all farmers will be required \nin accordance with the expected cash flow from the specific investment being made, inclusive of \nan appropriate grace period for principal repayments and subject to the grace period limitations \nof the Asian Development Bank loan. Farmers will be required to pay the interest payments on a \nsemiannual  basis  with  a  maximum  of  1-year  grace  period.  The  TFS  and  CFB  will  monitor \nimplementation  of  the  borrower's  investment,  accept  repayments  in  accordance  with  the \nagreement, and initiate any remedial action necessary to ensure proper implementation of the \ninvestment, utilization, and recovery of the subloan funds.  \n \n3. \nFor  subloans  to  agro-enterprises,  the  concerned  CFB  will  enter  into  a  subloan \nagreement  and  be  responsible  for  disbursement,  recovery,  and  monitoring  of  the  utilization  of \ninvestment  funds.  To  ensure  proper  utilization,  all  subloans  will  be  disbursed  according  to  a \nschedule  specified  in  the  agreement  that  reflects  the  phasing  of  the  investment  and  its  cash \nflow. Where previous disbursements are not utilized in accordance with the subloan agreement, \nthe subloan borrowers will be required to take remedial action before further disbursements are \nmade.  The  MFB  will  also  monitor  implementation  of  the  borrower's  investment;  recover  the \nsubloan in accordance with the agreement; and initiate any remedial action necessary to ensure \nproper implementation of the investment, utilization, and recovery of the subloan funds.  \n \nMunicipal  and  county  project  implementation  units,  supervised  by  the  MFB,  CFB,  and \n4. \nTFS, will monitor investment implementation to ensure compliance with government regulations \nand project eligibility and criteria. The MFB and CFB (with links to the TFS) portfolios of loans \nand subloans will be computerized\u2014with software consistent with that in use by other financial \ninstitutions  lending  to  farmers  and  agro-enterprises\u2014integrated  into  other  relevant  accounting \nsystems  in  the  Shanxi  Finance  Department,  and  the  status  of  lending  and  repayment  of \nprincipal and interest reported monthly to the project management office. The CFB and TFS will \n\n                                                 \n1   The CFB and/or TFS will set up special accounts in local banks to disburse subloans. Each borrowing farmer will \nbe issued a debit card to withdraw the subloan to defray investment costs. Similarly, the CFB and/or TFS will set \nup separate designated accounts, in the same local bank, for farmers to deposit subloan repayments.  \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                    Appendix 10 \n\n43\n\ntake immediate action and document all steps to recover subloan repayments overdue beyond \n30  days  and  report  to  the  project  management  office  and  Shanxi  Finance  Department  on  a \nmonthly basis. A summarized quarterly and more detailed semiannual reports will be submitted \nto the Asian Development Bank. Subborrowers with loans repaid for at least 3 years will have \nthe option of having their good repayment records provided to local finance institutions so they \ncan  seek  additional  or  new  financing.  At  the  Project's  midterm  review,  the  Government  and \nAsian Development Bank will discuss the option of bundling these loans and selling the package \nof  farmer  and  agro-enterprise  subloans  to  a  commercial  bank  or  other  suitable  financial \ninstitution for further engagement.

ADB will review the bid evaluation report and award of contract on a post-review basis. \nFor shopping and direct contracting, ADB will normally review the award of contracts on a post-review basis. \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\n         Appendix 12 \n\n \n\nConsulting Services Contracts Estimated to Cost More than $100,000 \n\n \n3. \n\n \n \n \n3. \nis either ongoing or expected to commence within the next 18 months: \n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe following table lists the consulting services contracts for which procurement activity \n\n \nRecruitment \nMethod \n\nContract \nValue \n($ million) \n0.500 \n\n \nAdvertisement \nDate \n\nInternational \nor National \nAssignment \nIndividual selection Within 18 months 1 international \nand 2 national \nexperts \nNational \n\n \n \nGeneral Description \nWFPF consultants (financed \nby the WFPF, engaged by \nADB) \nGDCF consultants (financed \nby the GDCF, engaged by \nADB) \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  GDCF  =  Gender  and  Development  Cooperation  Fund,  NGO  =  nongovernment \norganization, WFPF = Water Financing Partnership Facility. \n \n \n\nGoods  and  Works  Contracts  Estimated  to  Cost  Less  than  $1  million  and \nConsulting Services Contracts Less than $100,000 \n\n \n \nComments \n3 contracts \n\nAn NGO will be \nengaged \n\nSinge-source \nselection \n\nWithin 18 months\n\n0.200 \n\n4. \n\nThe following table lists the goods and works contracts estimated at less than $1 million \n\n \n4. \nand consulting services contracts estimated at less than $100,000: \n \n\n \n \n \nGeneral Description \nA.

Farm budget analysis was undertaken for each of the farm investments \nproposed under the Project to determine potential incremental returns to farmers. Based on field \nsurveys with farmers and of markets, technical, and price parameters were estimated for each \ninvestment.  Input  and  output  quantities  and  prices  are  based  on  2008  values,  adjusted  where \nappropriate to reflect any seasonal or cyclical fluctuations observed over the preceding 3 years. \nResulting  input  and  output  values  were  used  to  prepare  20-year  farm  cash  flows  from  which \nfinancial  internal  rates  of  return  (FIRRs)  were  estimated.  All  farm  investments  involve  farmers \nforegoing  existing  farming  operations  or  off-farm  income  earning  opportunities  in  order  to \nundertake the proposed activities. Current farm operations and related incomes and costs were \nestimated to determine current net income. These were deducted from the net income deriving \nfrom  the  proposed  investment  to  determine  incremental  FIRRs  and  incremental  returns  to \nhousehold labor. Current net income is assumed to represent future without-project net income \non the basis that scope for improving farm productivity is limited. In fact, the continued use of \ntraditional farming practices is likely to result in a decline in productivity and, therefore, incomes. \nThe use of current net incomes to determine incremental net incomes under the Project may be \nconsidered  conservative,  as  incremental  returns  are  actually  likely  to  rise  over  time.  Actual \nincremental  returns  to  farmers  will  be  greater  since  the  cost  of  their  labor  is  included  in  the \noperating  cost  of  each  investment.  However,  not  all  of  the  labor  cost  included  relates  to \nhousehold labor, as some will be hired from outside the household. \n\n2. \nSensitivity  analysis  was  undertaken  to  determine  the  risk  to  rates  of  return  and  net \nincomes of adverse movements in revenues and costs, which may result from changes in input \nand output quantities and/or prices. Switching values were calculated to determine the extent to \nwhich  costs  can  increase  or  revenues  decrease  before  an  investment's  FIRR  falls  to  the \nweighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC),  indicating  that  larger  increases  in  costs  or  falls  in \nrevenue would make the investment nonviable. The WACC of each investment was estimated \nin  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of \nInvestment Projects Financed by the Asian Development Bank, using the relative proportions of \neach  source  used  in  financing  each  investment  and  their  relative  costs,  and  an  estimate  of \ninflation  rates  applicable  to  the  various  sources.  The  three  sources  of  investment  are  (i)  loan \nfinance  under  the  Project;  (ii)  a  household's  own  equity  contribution  that  principally  comprises \nin-kind household labor for which an imputed value equal to the prevailing wage for agricultural \nlabor was applied; and (iii) where appropriate, a contribution from the local government budget. \nA single WACC was used for all on-farm investments, based on weighted average contributions \nfor project loans of 53%, government 10%, and farmers 37%. \n\n3. \nThe analysis of the investments of five agro-enterprises is based on the estimate of input \nand  output,  technical,  and  financial  parameters  derived  from  discussions  with  each  agro-\nenterprise and a market analysis for each output. FIRRs and switching values are calculated for \n20-year cash flow. Agro-enterprise investments will be financed only by a loan from the Project \nand equity. No government contribution is proposed for the five private sector agro-enterprises. \nA  separate  WACC  was  calculated  for  each  agro-enterprise.  Although  each  of  the  five  agro-\nenterprise investments represent an expansion in storage capacity or the introduction of a new \nproduct line rather than completely new ventures, the analysis assumes that the build-up to full \ncapacity utilization, which will only be reached in the third year after the investment is made, will \nbe  phased.  The  agro-enterprises  could  reach  full  capacity  utilization  before  the  third  year,  in \nwhich case actual FIRRs will be higher than those estimated.

The FIRRs indicate the viability of all investments in perennial crops. \nInvestments  in  Chinese  herbs,  both  rainfed  and  irrigated,  have  relatively  low  FIRRs  but  they \nremain  above  the  WACC  of  5.1%.  With  the  exception  of  rainfed  Chinese  herbs,  none  of  the \ninvestments in perennial crops are sensitive to negative changes in revenue or investment and \noperating  costs.  In  the case  of  rainfed  Chinese  herbs,  the switching  value  for  revenue  is  12% \nand for operating costs 17%. This indicates a higher degree of risk but is considered to be well \nwithin  limits  that  are  manageable  by  farmers  who  have  experience  in  the  cultivation  of  herbs. \nIncremental  annual  net  incomes  range  from  CNY2,480  for  prickly  ash  investments  to \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\n        Appendix 14 \n\n \n\nCNY18,270  for  the  investment  in  fast-growing  poplar  trees. These  compare  favorably  with  the \ncurrent estimated income for poor and low-income households. \n\n5. \nAnnual  Crops.  All  greenhouse  investments  have  FIRRs  of  about  17%  or  above, \nindicating their viability. None of the greenhouse investments are sensitive to adverse changes \nin  revenue  or  cost.  Incremental  annual  net  incomes  from  greenhouse  investments  show  a \nsignificant  increase  over  current  poverty  income  levels,  with  the  exception  of  the  tunnel \ngreenhouse  for  which  the  incremental  annual  net  income  is  relatively  low  at  CNY1,500.  The \nproduction of vegetables in greenhouses lends itself well to the introduction of improved farming \npractices.  Linking  greenhouse  growers  to  the  Project's  initiative  to  create  linkages  to  the \nChinaGAP certification program offers the potential for higher income through improved product \nquality and marketability and related price premiums. The investment in millet production has an \nacceptable FIRR of 17.4% and is robust with respect to adverse changes in revenue and costs. \nThe incremental annual net income of CNY1,270, is low compared with other project-supported \nfarm investments.  \n\nLivestock.  With  the  exception  of  pig  breeding,  all  the  proposed  livestock  investments \n6. \nare viable with incremental FIRRs above 12%. The incremental FIRR for pig breeding is 9.6%, \nwhich  is  relatively  low  but  remains  well  above  the  WACC.  Sensitivity  analysis  suggests  that  a \nnumber  of  the  livestock  investments  are  sensitive  to  changes  in  revenue  and  operating  costs. \nThe  pig  investments,  cattle  fattening,  and  chicken  investments  show  switching  values  for \nrevenue  and  operating  costs  between  4%  and  8%.  This  suggests  the  need  for  effective  cost \ncontrol  and  proactive  marketing  on  the  part  of  livestock  farmers  to  maintain  the  volume  and \nquality  of  product  sales.  These  risks  are  mitigated  to  an  extent  by  the  strong  demand  and \nupward trend in market prices for livestock products in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), \nthough  livestock  product  markets  are  often  subject  to  shocks  resulting  from  the  outbreak  of \ndisease. Risks may be further mitigated with support from technical service agencies to assist \nfarmers  in  arranging  supply  contracts  with  agro-enterprises.  Nonetheless,  careful  appraisal  of \nthese investments will need to be undertaken at the time of subloan application to review and \nupdate investment assumptions. \n\n7. \nOn-Farm Processing. Both on-farm processing investments are viable. The investment \nin  household  storage  is  also  robust  in  relation  to  negative  movements  in  revenues  and  costs. \nThe  investment  in  household  storage  would  be  undertaken  by  10  households,  which  would \nresult in a relatively high investment cost per household of CNY53,000. However, incremental \nannual net income per household is also high at CNY9,400. \n\nThe investment in date drying is sensitive to adverse changes in revenue and operating \n8. \ncosts with switching values of 8.4% and 9.7%, respectively, indicating the need for both careful \ncost control and effective marketing. The high demand for Chinese dates and existing network \nof  brokers  competing  for  product  should  mitigate  the  risk.  However,  the  sensitivity  analysis \npoints  to  the  need  for  detailed  appraisal  at  the  time  of  loan  application  to  reassess  prevailing \nmarket  conditions  and  financial  and  technical  parameters.  Under  the  Project,  a  number  of \nhouseholds would jointly invest in the date-drying facility, mainly to process their own crop. The \nrelatively  low  incremental  annual  net  income  of  CNY8,000  suggests  returns  per  household \nwould be low if more than 3\u20134 households invested in the drying unit. However, the investment \ncost  is  also  relatively  low,  and  with  3\u20134  households  combining  to  make  the  investment,  the \ninvestment  per  household  would  be  in  line  with  other  on-farm  investments.  For  both  on-farm \nprocessing investments where a number of households collaborate in the activity, support from \nproject agencies will be required to ensure that operating and financial modalities are effective, \nfully  supported,  and  adhered  to  by  all  participating  households.  Interhousehold  disputes  could \n\n \n\n\f \n\n                                                                                                        Appendix 14   \n\n53\n\nundermine the viability of the investments, especially in the case of date drying, which appears \nsensitive to adverse revenue and cost movements. \n\nB. \n\nFinancial Analysis of Agro-Enterprises \n\nAll  five  agro-enterprises  are  assessed  to  be  eligible  according  to  socioeconomic, \n9. \nenvironmental, and financial criteria (Appendix  6).  An analysis of the historical performance of \neach  agro-enterprise,  based  on  a  review  of  the  last  3  years'  financial  statements,  and  the \nprojected  performance  with  the  proposed  investment,  indicates  that  they  are  financially  sound \nand their investment proposals financially viable.  \n\n10. \nHuarong  Fruit  Production  Company  was  established  in  April  2002  with  registered \ncapital  of  CNY5  million.  It  is  located  in  Wanrong  County  and  operates  temperature-controlled  \nstorage  with  a  capacity  of  2,000  tons  mainly  for  apples.  It  has  160  staff,  including  \n10 management and 5 experienced technicians. More than 90% of the company's apple output \nis  exported  to  Germany,  United  Kingdom,  Netherlands,  Singapore,  India,  and  Thailand. \nHuarong\u2019s total assets have risen steadily in the last 3 years to reach CNY19.2 million. Over the \nsame  period,  equity  increased  to  CNY12.0  million.  Sales  revenue  increased  by  6%  in  2007, \nreaching  CNY11.5  million  and  increased  by  35%  in  2008,  reaching  CNY10.3  million.  The \ncompany  proposes  to  expand  storage  capacity  by  2,000  tons  at  a  cost  of  CNY6.6  million,  of \nwhich  CNY3.0  million  will  be  financed  from  project  loan  funds,  and  the  balance  from  the \ncompany's  own  sources.  Financial  analysis  shows  that  the  FIRR  for  the  investment  is  22.9%, \nand the investment is marginally sensitive to adverse changes in revenue and operating costs \nwith switching values of 9% and 11%, respectively.  \n\nLonglang Fruit Company was founded by local farmers in 2004 with registered capital \n11. \nof CNY0.5 million. It operates a cold store facility of 1,750-ton capacity for local pear farmers. It \nhas  more  than  80  staff,  including  60  women.  Longlang  has  state  green-food  certification  and \nexports  two-thirds  of  its  output  to  the  European  Union,  Eastern  Europe,  and  Southeast  Asia. \nLonglang\u2019s total assets increased by 7% in 2007, and in 2008 were CNY7.0 million by the end \nof July 2008. Equity increased significantly in the last 3 years to CNY5.6 million by the end of \nJuly  2008.  Sales  revenue  increased  by  67%  in  2006,  but  fell  by  53%  in  2007  as  a  result  of \nreduced  production  of  pears  due  to  severe  weather  in  the  spring  of  2006.  Sales  in  2007 \namounted  to  CNY15.4  million  and  had  reached  CNY15  million  by  the  end  of  July  2008.  The \ncompany's investment proposal includes expanding cold storage capacity for fruit by 600 tons, \nfor a proposed total investment of CNY2.4 million, of which CNY1.0 million will be financed from \nproject  loan  funds,  and  the  remainder  from  the  enterprise\u2019s  own  sources.  Financial  analysis \nshows  that  the  FIRR  for  the  investment  is  16.1%.  Sensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  it  is \nmoderately sensitive to reduced revenue and increased operating costs, with switching values \nof 7% and 8%, respectively. \n\nQinzhou Yellow Millet Company was established in 1992 as a state-owned enterprise. \n12. \nIt  was  bought  from  the  state  in  2000  by  four  persons  (with  a  combined  shareholding  of  83%, \nwith one person holding 74%) and an investment management company, which owns 2% of the \nshares.  Other  small  shareholders  account  for  the  remaining  equity.  The  registered  capital  is \nCNY0.5  million.  The  company  has  150  staff,  including  110  women.  The  company  packs  and \nsells  high-quality  millet  products  with  sales  of  around  7,500  tons  per  year,  representing  more \nthan  40%  of  the  total  PRC  market.  Total  assets  increased  over  the  last  3  years  reaching \nCNY103.3  million  in  2008.  Equity  also  increased  to  CNY90.8  million  to  2008.  Sales  revenue \namounted to CNY48.2 million and net profit after tax to CNY4.3 million in 2008. The company's \ninvestment proposal includes establishing 2,000-ton capacity cold storage for millet at a cost of \nCNY7.6  million,  of  which  CNY3.5  million  is  to  be  financed  from  project  loan  funds,  and  the \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\n        Appendix 14 \n\n \n\nbalance  from  the  company's  own  resources.  The  FIRR  of  the  proposed  investment  is  22.6%. \nSensitivity  analysis  suggests  that  the  investment  is  slightly  sensitive  to  negative  changes  in \nrevenue with a switching value of 9%, and operating costs with a switching value of 10%.  \n\nXintai  Food  Company  is  a  joint  stock  company  founded  by  a  single  individual  who \n13. \nowns 55% of the equity and is the company manager. The remaining shares are held by three \nstate investment companies at provincial (25% equity), municipal (15% equity) and county (2% \nequity)  levels.  The  company  was  established  in  December  1998  with  registered  capital  of \nCNY13.0  million.  It  has  390  staff  including  310  women.  The  company  produces  dried  fruit  (in \nparticular Chinese dates and walnuts) and vegetables using five processing lines, with an output \nof 6,000\u20137,500 tons per year. Xintai\u2019s total assets rose to CNY60.1 million in 2008, and equity \nremained steady at around CNY33.0 million. Sales revenue rose by 23% in 2006, and by 2% in \n2007 to CNY78.6 million, then fell to CNY51.0 million in 2008. Net profit after tax followed the \nsame trend, rising by 78% in 2006, but falling by 4% in 2007 to CNY3.6 million and again falling \nby 33% to CNY2.4 million in 2008. The fall in sales in 2007 resulted from reduced Chinese date \nproduction  following  rain  during  harvest  and  in  2008  reflected  the  cyclical  nature  of  fresh \nvegetable marketing. The proposed investment is to establish a 2,000-ton per year processing \nline  for  pickled  vegetables,  and  to  increase  storage  for  fresh  produce  raw  materials.  The \nproposed total investment is CNY8.5 million, of which CNY4.0 million is to be financed from the \nproject  loan.  Financial  analysis  shows  that  the  FIRR  of  the  proposed  investment  is  16.3%. \nSensitivity analysis indicates that the investment is relatively sensitive to revenue and operating \ncosts with switching values of only 4% and 5%, respectively.  \n\n14. \nZeyu Livestock Development Company was founded in 2003 with registered capital of \nCNY5.5 million. It has 82 staff including 38 women. The company slaughters pigs and produces \npork products, with a capacity of 1,500 head per day, and operates refrigerated storage with a \ncapacity of 500 tons. Pork products are sold to large retail outlets in Jinzhong municipality and \nTaiyuan city. Due to widespread disease in pigs in 2006, capacity utilization fell dramatically to \naround 400 head per day. The disease problem is no longer an issue, and with a combination of \nGovernment policy aimed at preventing similar outbreaks and/or mitigating their effects, and the \npromotional  efforts  of  the  company  itself,  the  situation  is  improving.  Zeyu\u2019s  total  assets  have \nrisen significantly over the last 3 years, reaching CNY23.2 million in 2007 and CNY27.7 million \nin  2008.  Equity  also  increased  significantly,  rising  to  CNY16.2  million  in  2007.  Sales  revenue \nincreased by 508% in 2007 due to both increased production and significantly higher pork prices \nfollowing the disease problem in 2006. Revenue in 2007 was CNY116.6 million. Net profit after \ntax rose in 2007 to CNY4.4 million, an increase of almost 200%, reflecting the increased prices \nachieved  for  pork  products.  Net  profit  after  tax  fell  to  CNY1.0  million  in  2008  due  to  rapid \nexpansion,  increased  liabilities,  and  consequently  higher  interest  repayments.  The  company's \ninvestment  proposal  includes  establishing  additional  refrigerated  storage  for  meat  products  of \n500 tons. The cost of the investment is CNY8.1 million, of which CNY3.5 million will be financed \nfrom  project  loan  funds,  and  the  remainder  from  Zeyu's  own  sources.  The  FIRR  for  the \nproposed investment is 17.8%. It is, however, highly sensitive to a fall in revenue or an increase \nin operating costs, with switching values of 2% for both. \n\nC. \n\nEconomic Analysis of Project Investments \n\n15.  Methodology. The economic analysis was carried out using the world price numeraire.1 \nTraded  goods  and  services  were  converted  to  their  border  price  equivalent  values  and \nnontraded goods and services at their financial market prices. Three outputs (walnuts, apples, \nand asparagus) and two inputs (fertilizers and pesticides) were treated as traded. The economic \n\n                                                 \n1   A detailed discussion of the methodology and results of the analysis are in Supplementary Appendix J. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n                                                                                                        Appendix 14   \n\n55\n\nconversion factors derived for walnuts and apples are also used for pears and Chinese dates. \nWhile the PRC has a significant trade in livestock products, none of the livestock output from the \nProject is expected to be traded outside of Shanxi, which is a net importer of livestock products. \nIncremental  net  economic  benefits,  based  on  the  derivation  of  financial  cash  flows,  were \nestimated  for  each  of  the  activities  to  be  supported  under  the  Project.  Without-project  returns \nare based on existing cropping activity in areas to be converted to new, largely perennial crops. \nGiven the expected continued degradation and decline in the productivity of land, especially in \nmarginal  areas,  the  analysis  assumes  no  increase  in  without-project  benefits  over  time.  For \ninvestments that do not involve converting existing agricultural activities, without-project benefits \nare estimated on the basis of the nominal income foregone calculated from the number of days \nthat  need  to  be  diverted  to  new  activities  and  an  imputed  wage  rate.  The  wage  rate  used  is \nbased on the market wage rate and a shadow wage rate factor of 0.84. Incremental net benefits \nof individual investments are aggregated for the Project as a whole based on the number and \nphasing of activities over the life of the Project. Project establishment costs\u2014not related to farm \nor  agro-enterprise  investments  including  farmer  training,  capacity  building  in  technical  support \nservices, and project management\u2014were converted to economic values by deducting taxes and \nduties, and converting domestic value added components using a standard conversion factor of \n0.93. The resulting project net incremental cash flow is used to derive an economic internal rate \nof return (EIRR) over a 20-year period. \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis. The estimated EIRR of \n16. \nthe Project is 19.5%. This relatively high rate of return reflects the fact that incremental returns \nare  high,  especially  as  farmers  convert  lower  value  field  crops  to  perennial  crops.  Also, \nincremental  returns  from  on-farm  processing  and  livestock  activities  are  based  upon  the \nopportunity cost of labor income forgone from current off-farm employment for which wage rates \nare low given the oversupply of labor in rural areas, especially during off-peak periods, which is \nreflected in high out-migration of labor. \n\nBecause  of  the  wide  range  of  activities  to  be  supported  under  the  Project,  only  four \n17. \nactivities  account  for  more  than  5%  of  the  total  net  incremental  benefit  of  the  Project.  Pork \nproducts production, which accounts for 15.3% of the total, is the major contributor. The other \nmajor  contributors  to  total  net  incremental  benefit  are  walnut  production  in  hilly  areas  (9.2%), \ncattle fattening (7.5%), and table apples (6.0%). In terms of groups of activities, perennial crops \ncontribute  33.9%  of  total  net  incremental  benefit,  livestock  29.6%,  and  agroprocessing  24.7%, \ntogether  accounting  for  88.2%.  The  spread  of  benefits  across  multiple  activities  indicates  that \nthe Project is not sensitive to potential negative changes in respect of the proposed activities. If \nno  benefit  is  realized  from  pork  products,  the  EIRR  would  only  fall  to  19.3%.  Similarly,  if  the \nentire net incremental benefit from perennial crops is not realized, the EIRR would fall to 12.3%, \nstill above the assumed opportunity cost of capital of 12%. Sensitivity to negative changes in the \nincremental  returns  from  all  other  individual  activities  is  negligible.  A  failure  to  achieve  any \nbenefit from the Project's productive investments is highly unlikely. This also does not allow for \nany  reduction  in  project  costs  for  such  activities  as  capacity  building  in  technical  services, \nfarmer training, and project management related to these activities, which would inevitably occur \nif a whole subcomponent or activity is dropped from the Project. That equates to the improbable \nsituation in which the Project provides all necessary capacity-building support for these activities \nbut results in no take-up in terms of productive activity.  \n\n18. \nIn  economic  prices,  total  project  establishment,  administration,  and  management  costs \nover  the  6  years  of  project  implementation  amount  to  CNY60.5  million.  These  costs  must \nincrease  almost  15  fold  before  the  EIRR  falls  below  the  opportunity  cost  of  capital  Project \nmanagement  costs  account  for  60%  of  total  project  establishment,  administration,  and \nmanagement  costs,  and  would  have  to  increase  almost  25  times  to  reduce  the  EIRR  to  the \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\n        Appendix 14 \n\n \n\nin \nopportunity  cost  of  capital.  These  are  both  highly \nimplementation have the potential to adversely impact the Project. However, assuming that all \nproject  capacity  building  and  management  activities  proceed  as  planned  but  that  there  is  a \ndelay  of  1  year  in  the  take-up  of  all  productive  activities  the  EIRR  would  only  be  reduced  to \n19.1%.  A  delay  of  all  productive  activities  is  extremely  unlikely.  Therefore,  the  project \ninvestment  is  considered  economically  viable  and  robust  to  potential  negative  changes  in  key \nproject parameters. A detailed economic analysis is presented in Supplementary Appendix J. \n\nimprobable  scenarios.  Delays \n\nIndirect Economic Benefits. The persistence of traditional, extensive farming systems, \n19. \ncombined  with  a  large  population,  presents  a  major  threat  to  the  project  area's  natural \nresources,  especially  soil  and  water.  Degradation  of  forests  continues  in  spite  of  government \nefforts  to  restrict  agricultural  encroachment  through  programs  such  as  the  Land  Conversion \nProject,  which  provides  incentives  to  rural  communities  to  conserve  natural  resources.  The \nforested area in Shanxi declined from 405,000 hectares (ha) in 2000 to 140,000 ha in 2007. The \narea  of  fruit  orchards  declined  by  3%  over  the  same  period  from  289,000  ha  to  280,000  ha.2 \nProtection and conservation of the remaining natural forests to protect natural resources, reduce \nsoil erosion, and maintain biodiversity are key government policies. The area of land cultivated \ndeclined by 14% between 2000 and 2007, from 4.34 million ha to 3.79 million ha. In 2007, the \narea of land under regular cultivation was 3.26 million ha (86% of the total). Of the land under \ntemporary cultivation, 241,800 ha was land with a slope of 25 degrees or more. The decline in \narea cultivated resulted in a decrease in the average area cultivated per person from 0.14 ha to \n0.11  ha.  In  spite  of  government  efforts  to  promote  diversification  into  more  sustainable  crops, \nthe area under grain has remained stable at around 80% of the area under regular cultivation \nsince 2000. Grain production represents a greater environmental risk than fruit tree crops due to \nhigher  water  requirement  and  soil  retention  characteristics.  Currently,  farmers  over  exploit \nfragile soils with little or no fallow period to allow soil fertility to recover. The Project will address \nthis  by  converting  grain-producing  land  to  fruit  tree  production,  which  will  conserve  water  and \nsoil  resources,  increase  forest  cover  and  agricultural  value  added,  and  provide  income  and \nemployment opportunities in local communities that will act as an incentive to more sustainable, \nenvironmentally  sound  agricultural  practices.  This  will  be  reinforced  by  collaboration  with  the \nChinaGAP initiative and certification of project farmers' adoption of improved farming practices. \nAnimal waste from the Project's livestock activities, having been properly composted, will offer a \nsafer  and  low-cost  alternative  to  chemical  fertilizers,  decreasing  their  use  in  the  long-run.  The \nlinking  of  pig  and  cattle  investments  to  complementary  investments  in  biogas  digesters  offers \nthe  advantage  of  both  improving  the  quality  of  animal  compost  and  providing  a  cheap, \nrenewable source of energy for participating households.3  \n\n20. \nThe  savings  from  improved  irrigation,  from  adopting  water-saving  technologies  and \ntechniques  and  integrated  pest  management,  and  more  effective  application  of  fertilizers  and \npesticides  are  significant;  though  the  savings  will  not  be  universal  across  all  project  counties. \nDepending on the nature and number of activities to be established, specific counties may have \na  net  increase  in  water,  fertilizer,  and  pesticide  usage.  Over  the  whole  project  area,  annual \nwater  savings  are  estimated  at  approximately  3.8  million  cubic  meters  (CNY7.6  million). \nReduction in fertilizer usage is expected to be 2,300 tons, with an approximate economic value \nof CNY7.8 million. However, a net increase in the use of pesticides of 5.4 tons is expected with \nan  estimated  incremental  cost  of  CNY0.6  million.  The  increase  will  result  from  their  use  with \nperennial crops compared with currently usage on annual crops. The net annual savings from \nreduced water, fertilizer, and pesticide uses are expected to be around CNY15 million. \n\n                                                 \n2   Shanxi Bureau of Statistics. 2008.

The  Shanxi  provincial  government  (SPG) \nengaged China Agricultural University to conduct the environmental assessment and prepared \nthe environmental impact assessment reports and a summary initial environmental examination. \nThese  documents  were  reviewed  by  ADB  and  approved  by  the  provincial  Environmental \nProtection Department. Due diligence of the management practices of the 24 agro-enterprises \nshows that they are complying with the environmental regulations. These agro-enterprises will \nprovide support and credit guarantees for participating farmers. \n \nA. \n\nProject Description \n\ntechnologies  and  practices \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n2. \nThe  Project  will  reduce  resource  degradation  by  promoting,  adopting,  and  expanding \nenvironmentally  sound  modern  technologies  and  practices  in  the  production  of  high-value \nagricultural products. These products will be of high quality and safe for consumers, and ensure \nbetter  returns  for  poor  farmers  and  agro-enterprises.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  in  the \ncentral  and  southern  part  of  Shanxi,  covering  26  counties  and  districts  in  five  municipalities,  \n11 of which are poverty counties. The Project comprises four components (i) transition to high-\nthat  ensure  environmental \nvalue  production  by  adopting \nsustainability  and  increase  farmers  income;  (ii)  strengthening  of  farm\u2013market  linkages  by \nsupporting  on-farm  and  industrial  agroprocessing  and  marketing  of  high-value  products;  \n(iii)  capacity  building  and  training  of  farmers,  farmer  associations,  and  technical  support \nagencies  to  support  high-value  production  and  processing  of  farm  products;  and  (iv)  project \nmanagement to support efficient implementation of the Project. The specific project outputs are \noutlined in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1).   \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe  project  area  is  mostly  hilly  where  water  pollution,  soil  erosion,  and  the  loss  of \nnitrogen  and  phosphorus  in  the  soils  are  key  concerns.  Agrochemical  use  has  resulted  in \nincreased  residues  in  water,  soil,  agricultural  products.  Excessive  application  of  pesticides \nthreatens  health  of  producers  and  consumers,  and  damages  diversity  in  the  agro-ecological \nsystem.  The  chemical  pollution  in  water  bodies  and  soil  has  adversely  affected  quantity  and \nquality of agricultural products. Moreover, an increased amount of undecomposed waste-plastic \nmulch  is  left  in  the  soil  year  after  year,  having  a  negative  impact  on  the  soil's  physical \ncharacteristics and the growth of crops.  \n \n4. \nWater scarcity and poor water quality hinder rural development. Unsustainable livestock \nproduction  practices  are  gradually  increasing  in  the  province,  resulting  in  the  accumulation  of \nlarge volumes of livestock waste; a major source of pollution in water, air, and soil; and spread \nof  mosquitoes  and  flies.  Unregulated  and  overuse  of  groundwater  is  a  common  practice.  The \nprovince has a program to close deep wells in areas considered to be overexploited, while the \ncounties still insist on drilling and extracting more groundwater. Surface water is also overused \nand controlled through dams and reservoirs, and pollution is visible.  \n \n5. \nThe province has good plant diversity with more than 1,500 species of wild plants, which \ninclude  over  500  species  of  woody  plants,  forming  complex  and  diversified  forest  types.  The \nprovince  has  preserved  17  wild  species  of  plants.  It  has  more  than  439  terrestrial  species  of \nanimals; about 19% of the total number of such species in the country. The fruit and vegetable \n\n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\n        Appendix 15 \n\n \n\nScreening of Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\nspecies  included  in  the  Project  are  not  listed  in  the  \u201cBiological  List  of  Quarantine  Harmful \nImported Plants in PRC\u201d (No. 862 Order issued by the Ministry of Agriculture). The main crops \nin the project areas are wheat, cotton, vegetables, potato, and perennial plants such as apple, \npear, walnut, Chinese dates, and herbs. Three harvests occur over every 2 year period in the \nmiddle south, two harvests in 1 year in the middle south of Shanxi, and one harvest per year in \nthe  north.  In  terms  of  their  regional  distribution,  agro-enterprises  play  an  effective  role  in \nextending value chain to the farms and markets.  \n \nC. \n \n6. \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  generate  significant  environmental  benefits  for  Shanxi.  The \nProject  will  support  farmers  to  replace  environmentally  unsustainable  practices  by  adopting \nmodern  and  appropriate  technologies  and  practices.  Support  for  transition  to  high-value \nperennial  and  annual  crops  will  reduce  erosion  in  higher  sloped  areas,  improve  efficiency  in \nwater use, reduce application of agrochemicals, and help produce safer agriculture products.  \n \nThe increase in fruit area, over 11,000 ha, will have a positive impact on local ecology. \n7. \nCultivation  of  fruit  trees  will  conserve  water  (prevent  floods,  increase  flow  during  low  water \nperiods, and improve water quality), maintain air balance, improve soil structure and fertility, and \npreserve  biodiversity.  Other  environmental  benefits  are  (i)  reduced  use  of  chemical  fertilizers \nand increased use of organic manure; (ii) reduced wind speed due to increased tree cover over \n11,000  ha;  (iii)  about  35%  saving  in  water  through  increased  infiltration;  and  (iv)  increased \nvegetative  cover  resulting  in  carbon  sequestration,  reduced  rainwater  run-off,  increased \nrecharge of groundwater, and reduced soil erosion.  \n \nThe project interventions will annually conserve about 3.8 million m3 of water and reduce \n8. \nfertilizer  use  by  about  2,300  tons.  The  annual  net  savings  from  reduced  water,  fertilizer,  and \npesticides will amount to around CNY15.0 million. But these savings will not be similar across all \nproject counties. Livestock interventions will provide health benefits by encouraging farmers to \ncollectively  manage  their  herds  in  larger  facilities  and  improving  hygienic  conditions  in  living \nareas,  and  reduce  soil  degradation  by  limiting  free-grazing  practices.  The  increased  fruit  and \nvegetable production will result in a net increase in pesticide use by 5.4 tons, with an estimated \nincremental  cost  of  CNY0.6  million.  Other  potential  adverse  environmental  impacts  include \nincreased  agricultural  waste  and  standard  construction  impacts.  The  increased  waste  will  be \nmitigated  by  adopting  adequate  waste  treatment  and  disposal  procedures,  in  accordance  with \nPRC regulations and ADB guidelines. Livestock waste will be safely disposed of by composting \nand/or converting it into gas for home consumption using biogas digesters. During construction, \nthe  main  adverse  impacts  on  the  surrounding  environment  include  waste  gas  emission,  dust, \nnoise,  solid  wastes,  and  wastewater,  among  which  dust  and  construction  noise  are  most \nsignificant.  Construction  impacts  will  be  mitigated  to  acceptable  levels  by  applying  a  code  of \npractice for all construction works.  \n \nD. \n \nSPG\u2019s  project  management  office  and  project  implementation  units  will  be  responsible \n9. \nfor  ensuring  compliance  with  environmental  safeguards  during  project  implementation. \nMonitoring  will  be  jointly  organized  with  the  provincial  and  county  environmental  protection \nbureaus, which were involved in project preparation. Skills training will be provided to farmers to \nadopt  modern  and  environmentally  sound  technologies.  Provincial,  municipal,  and  county \ntechnical  agency  staff  will  receive  training  in  workshops  focusing  on  (i)  improved  crops  and \nintegrated  pest  management,  \nlivestock  production,  (ii)  efficient \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program \n\nirrigation  systems,  (iii) \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                  Appendix 15 \n\n \n\n59\n\nPublic Consultations and Disclosure \n\n(iv) environmental monitoring, and (v) water balance monitoring. Training costs are included in \nthe project costs. \n \nE. \n \n10. \nPublic  participation  in  the  environmental  assessment  was  undertaken  through  public \nmeetings,  interviews,  and  surveys  during  July  and  August  in  2007.  Survey  questionnaires  on \npublic participation for environmental protection of the Project were distributed to 2,400 village \nresidents.  The  respondents  comprised  people older  than  50  years  of  age  (13%),  40\u201350  years \n(40%),  and  30\u201340  years  (47%).  The  respondents  included  those  with  high  school  education \n(20%)  and  less  than  middle  school  education  (80%).  Interviews  were  also  conducted  with \nindividuals from rural households in the project area. All residents affected or living in the project \narea support the Project. A consultation meeting was also held with experts on 2 August 2007, \nhosted by the Center of Environmental Impact Appraisal, China Agriculture University, and the \nproject  management  office.  The  meeting  supported  project  interventions  and  proposed  an \nenvironmental management plan and mitigations measures. \n \nF. \n \n11. \nThe  Project  will  have  significant  positive  environmental  impacts  in  the  area,  including \nreduced soil erosion and air pollution, increased forestation, and conservation of biodiversity. No \nsignificant  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  anticipated  from  other  activities.  Appropriate \nmitigation  measures  will  be  taken  against  any  adverse  impacts  resulting  from  livestock \nproduction,  including  conversion  of  animal  waste  to  compost  (reducing  the  use  of  chemical \nfertilizers),  and  biogas  (reducing  the  use  of  fossil  fuels).  Adoption  of  integrated  pest \nmanagement  practices  will  reduce  the  use  of  pesticides  and  make  vegetables  and  fruits  safe. \nAppropriate mitigation measures and budget for environmental management and monitoring are \nprovided. Therefore, a full-scale environmental impact assessment was not required. \n\nFindings and Conclusions \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 16 \n\n60 \n \n\n \n\nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\nLoan \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n\nCountry/Project Title: Shanxi Integrated Agricultural Development Project \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n\nEast Asia Department/Agriculture, \nEnvironment, and Natural Resources \nDivision \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\n No \n\n  Yes \n\n   Yes \n\n   No \n\n \nIs the sector identified as a national                    \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?                                                         \n\nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nIs the sector identified as a national     \npriority in country poverty analysis? \n                                                             \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China: \nThe  agriculture  sector  has  played  a  major  role  in  reducing  poverty  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  Since  the  1978 \nreforms, annual agricultural gross output has grown by 6.5% per  annum. Rural income has increased more than three-fold since \n1980, reaching CNY4,800 in 2007. The overall rise in rural incomes has led to a dramatic fall in poverty. However, the pace of rural \nincome  growth  has  lagged  that  of  urban  income  resulting  in  widening  inequity  between  rural  and  urban  areas  and  between  the \neastern region, and the central and western regions of the country. Poverty reduction in rural areas is one of the major objectives of \nthe Government. In the 11th Five-Year Plan 2006\u20132010, the Government shifted its overemphasis on growth to sustainable, more \ninclusive rural development, and social programs. One of the main objectives of the plan is to decrease income inequality between \nrural  and  urban  areas,  and  between  geographic  regions.  To  highlight  emphasis  on  sustainable  agricultural  development,  the \nGovernment  published  its  Policy  Document  on  Modern  Agriculture  in  January  2007.  This  initiated  the  New  Socialist  Countryside \nPolicy to redress the slow rate of growth of rural incomes and development and poor socioeconomic conditions of the PRC's 750 \nmillion farmers. The policy recognizes the persistent decline in natural resources and deteriorating environment, and places priority \non investments to (i) support sustainable rural growth, (ii) increase farm productivity, and (iii) raise rural incomes.    \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention \n1.    Key Issues \nProject interventions target 26 counties including 11 poverty counties. The key issues with poverty implications are (i) water scarcity \nand  inefficient  irrigation  systems,  (ii)  land  scarcity  and  declining  soil  fertility,  (iii)  inadequate  access  to  finance,  and  (iv)  limited \naccess to technical knowledge.  \n \n2.    Design Features \nThe  Project  will  reduce  rural  poverty,  increase  farm  incomes,  support  sustainable  environmental  management,  and  reduce  out-\nmigration.  The  Project  will  target  poor  households  to  reduce  their  vulnerability  to  environmental  degradation  and  improve  their \naccess  to  employment,  financing,  and  market  opportunities.  The  poor  will  get  support  to  make  the  transition  to  high-value  farm \nproduction systems through introduction of modern technologies, capacity-building, more efficient use of irrigation water, reduced \nuse of agrochemicals, and access to long-term credit.  \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \nPoor  households  account  for  15.7%  of  the  population  in  the  project  counties.  Farmers\u2019  perspectives,  noted  from  wealth  ranking \ndone  during  the  feasibility  study  survey,  show  that  poor  and  extremely  poor  often  account  for  60%\u201380%  of  the  population  in  the \nmountain and hilly areas. During the survey, households expressed a strong desire to participate in the Project, and willingness to \nborrow  for  investments  in  production  systems  and  repay  on  time.  They  also  wish  to  participate  in  training  to  learn  modern \nagricultural techniques to sustainably manage soil and water resources.  \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\nDuring the social and poverty assessment undertaken in April 2007, eight county stakeholder meetings were held. For the feasibility \nstudy, municipal and county agencies conducted an in-depth survey; with more than 13,000 farm households participating. \n \n1.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n2.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \n \nThe Project will ensure stakeholder C&P in its activities through a series of workshops and meetings throughout its implementation. \nFarmers  and  farmer  associations  will  receive  training  on  group  mobilization,  organization,  management,  and  marketing  skills  to \nenhance their capacity to participate in project implementation. \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                   Appendix 16 \n\n \n\n61\n\nC.  Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues. \nThe project preparation surveys identified the following gender issues: \n\n\uf0b7  Women\u2019s participation in farm labor was only 44%, and  much less in the mountain and poverty counties.  \n\uf0b7  Borrowing  from  a  rural  credit  cooperative  generally  requires  the  signature  of  a  husband  on  the  agreement.  Therefore, \n\nhouseholds headed by women do not have access to credit.  \nTraining to women is not provided to suit calendar of household activities, and not adapted to their lower education.  \n\n\uf0b7 \n\uf0b7  Women's employment is in general limited to agriculture, while out-migration and nonfarm jobs are mainly for men. \n\uf0b7  All China Women Federation (ACWF) branches are located in every village, but have limited operating capacity. \n\n \n2.  Key Actions.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION \n\n \nAre social indicators included in the design and monitoring framework to facilitate monitoring of social development activities and/or \nsocial impacts during project implementation?  \n      \n \n\n   Yes        \n\n  No \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\n        Appendix 17 \n\n \n\nGENDER ACTION PLAN \n \nOver the last 20 years, the People's Republic of China has achieved a significant reduction in \noverall  poverty.  Women,  however,  have  not  benefited  equally  due  to  social  barriers.  In  the \nproject areas, women have less employment both in on-farm and off-farm activities. They also \nhave  lower  education  and  less  access  to  technical  training  and  services,  which  might  prevent \nthem from participating in, and benefiting from, the Project. Generally, women have lower status \nin  decision-making  both  at  home  and  in  the  community,  which  might  also  prevent  them  from \nparticipating  in  the  consultation  and  participation,  leaving  their  needs  and  concerns  not \nadequately  addressed  during  project  implementation.  Due  to  inadequate  resources,  the  All \nChina Women Federation has not functioned well in each village to mobilize women and protect \ntheir  interests.  Finally,  in  many  project  counties,  more  than  half  of  all  farm  households  in  a \nvillage are headed by women as men migrate to seek off-farm employment.
