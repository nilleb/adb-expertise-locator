An  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  was \nundertaken.  The  summary  EIA  was  circulated  to  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  Board  along  with \nthe  summary \nresettlement  plan  on  28  December  2004  and  uploaded  on  the \nADB website on 29 December 2004. \n \nThe  Jilin  Water  Supply  and  Sewerage  Development  Project  is  a \nkey urban infrastructure initiative of the Jilin provincial government \n(JPG).  The  Project  will help  (i)  reduce  water  pollution;  (ii)  protect \nwater  resources;  (iii)  address  water  shortage  through  recycling \neffluent  and  meet  the  demand  for  high-quality  treated  water  by \n2010;  (iv)  promote  sustainable  economic  development;  and  (v) \nimprove  the  environment,  living  conditions,  and  public  health \nstandards  in  three  cities  and  one  district  of  Jilin  Province.  The \nProject  has  five  components  involving  the  improvement  and \nexpansion  of  (i)  the  Changchun  wastewater  treatment  and \nsewerage  system;  (ii)  the  Shuangyang  water  supply  system;  (iii) \nthe  Changchun  Yongchun  River  flood  control  capacity;  (iv)  the \nLiaoyuan water supply system; and (v) the Meihekou water supply \nsystem. The Project will provide capacity building and training on \nproject  management,  institutional  and  wastewater  management, \nand tariff analysis for all the project implementing agencies (IAs). \nThe  Project  supports  the  Government\u2019s  objectives  for  the  water \nand  wastewater  sector  as  set  out  in  the  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan \n(2001\u20132005), to improve living conditions and health in the project \ncities, and promote their sustainable economic development. \n \nThe Songhua River Basin (SRB) is the third largest river basin in \nthe  PRC  and  intersects  Jilin  and  Heilongjiang  provinces  and  the \nInner  Mongolia  Autonomous  Region.  The  SRB  has  a  catchment \narea of 557,000 square kilometers and a population of 62 million. \nThe  Songhua  River is one  of the  most   polluted of the 47 major \nrivers in the PRC, and  is  contaminated with a number  of organic \nchemicals, heavy metals, and conventional pollutants.  \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nimposes  a  major  constraint \n\nThis \nto  sustainable  economic \ndevelopment  in  the  region.  The  Yitong  and  Yongchun  rivers  in \nChangchun,  which  flow  into  the  SRB,  are  highly  polluted  due  to \ninadequate  wastewater  treatment  in  Changchun.  As  a  result  of \nrapid  economic  growth  and  urbanization,  water  pollution  and \nwater  scarcity  have  become  major  problems.  The  Project  will \ncontribute  significantly  to  controlling  water  pollution  in  the  Yitong \nand Yongchun rivers and in the upstream section of the SRB. The \nProject  will  also  help  solve  the  current  water  shortages  in  the \nproject  cities  and  meet  future  demand  for  high-quality  treated \nwater.  Further,  ADB  is  developing  an  integrated  plan  and  an \nimmediate action plan for pollution control in the SRB through the \nongoing  advisory  Songhua  River  Water  Quality  and  Pollution \nControl  Management  technical  assistance  (TA).  The  Project  fits \nwell within the strategic framework for pollution control in the SRB \nas it was developed under the Songhua Pollution Control TA. \n \nThe  Project  will  enhance  the  urban  environment,  and  improve \npublic health and quality of life for urban residents in the cities of \nChangchun,  Liaoyuan,  and  Meihekou  by  increasing  wastewater \ncoverage and improving the supply of potable water. The outcome \nof  the  Project  will  be  improved  management  and  utilization  of \nwater  resources  in  the  SRB  by  (i)  achieving  the  goal  of  70% \nwastewater treatment rate in Changchun by 2010; (ii) solving the \nwater  shortage  problem  through  effluent  reuse;  (iii)  increasing \nflood  control;  (iv)  providing  a  supply  of  reliable  and  high-quality \npotable water; (v) reducing the incidence of waterborne diseases \nsuch as diarrhea and hepatitis A; (vi) increasing the efficiency and \nmanagement  capacity  of  the  IAs;  (vii)  integrating  approaches  to \nbasin-wide  pollution  prevention  and  control;  and  (viii)  improving \ncost  recovery  through  a  better  tariff  structure,  with  gradual \nincreases to achieve full cost recovery.  \n \nThe  total  project  cost  is  $232.2  million  equivalent,  including  a \nforeign exchange cost of $110.8 (48%) and local currency cost of \n$121.4 million (52%) equivalent. \n \n\n($ million equivalent)\n\n \nSource \nAsian Development \n\nForeign \nExchange\n  100.0 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n0.0 \n\nTotal \nCost \n100.0 \n\n \n% \n    43 \n\nBank \n\nBank  \n\nDomestic Commercial \n\n     0.0 \n\n5.8 \n\n5.8 \n\n     3 \n\nCMG, LMG, and MMG \nand tariff increases \n\n     10.8 \n\n115.6 \n\n126.4 \n\n   54 \n\n  Total \n232.2  100.0 \nCMG  =  Changchun  municipal  government,  LMG  =  Liaoyuan  municipal \ngovernment, MMG = Meihekou municipal government. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.\n\n  110.8 \n\n121.4 \n\n\f \n\n    \n\nv\n\nADB will provide a loan of $100 million equivalent, to finance 90% \nof  the  foreign  exchange  cost  of  the  Project.

JPG will onlend the loan proceeds to CMG, LMG, and MMG. \nAll three transactions will have the same terms and conditions as \nthe  ADB  loan.  CMG,  LMG,  and  MMG  will  onlend  the  loan \nproceeds  to  the  IAs  serving  the  project  cities  on  the  same  terms \nand conditions as the ADB loan. The IAs will assume the foreign \nexchange and interest rate variation risks for the ADB loan. \n \nUntil 30 June 2010 \n \n31 December 2009 \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nJilin \n\nReform \n\nCommission, \n\n \nJPG has established a project steering committee (PSC) led by a \nVice  Governor.

The PSC will meet periodically \nto provide policy guidance, facilitate interagency coordination, and \nresolve  institutional  problems  affecting  project  implementation. \nThe Project Management Office (PMO) for the project preparatory \nTA led by the Jilin Construction Bureau will continue as the PMO \nfor  the  Project  and  the  secretariat  of  the  PSC.  The  PMO  will \ncoordinate  with  the  project  implementing  units  established  in \nCMG,  LMG,  and  MMG,  which  will  monitor \nimplementation \nprogress made by the IAs.  \n \nJilin Provincial Government \n \nADB-financed  equipment  and  materials  will  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines \nfor  Procurement.  Major \ncontracts  for  equipment  and  materials  will  be  tendered  through \ninternational  competitive  bidding  or \ninternational  shopping \nprocedures,  depending  on  the  contract  amount.  In  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement,  foreign contractors may \n\n \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n\n\fvi \n\n \n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n \n\n participate in bidding for local competitive bidding contracts.  \n \nAbout  30  person-months  of  international  consulting,  including  6 \nperson-months for a social and resettlement monitoring specialist, \nand  120  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  will  be  required. \nExpertise  will  be  needed  in  international  competitive  bidding \nprocedures,  construction  supervision,  and  quality  control; \nresettlement  monitoring;  pipelines  and  water  and  wastewater \ntreatment plant and network construction and improvement; ADB \nprocurement  procedures  and  reporting  requirements;  social  and \nenvironmental  monitoring;  tariff  analysis;  quality  control;  and \nproject  performance  management  systems.  The  international \nconsultants will also provide training and capacity building in water \nsupply  and  wastewater  treatment  planning,  water  resources  and \nquality  management, \nfinancial  management,  environmental \nmonitoring  and  management,  and  project  performance \nin \nmanagement  system.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  \n \nThe  Project  will  benefit  about  3  million  urban  residents  whose \nliving conditions and public health standards will be improved due \nto  (i)  improved  quality  of  water  supply  and  wastewater  services, \nprotection  from  flooding,  and  elimination  of  hazards  associated \nwith  poor  drainage;  and  (ii)  reduction  in  the  incidence  of \nwaterborne  diseases  such  as  diarrhea  and  hepatitis  A,  below \n2003  levels  in  Changchun,  Liaoyuan,  and  Meihekou  (to  be \nmonitored through the project performance management system). \nThe Project will result in improved management and utilization of \nwater  resources  in  the  upper  SRB,  bringing  positive  downstream \nand  transjurisdictional  benefits  in  the  province  of  Heilongjiang. \nThe water quality improvements in the SRB will also contribute to \nintegrated  water  resource  management  and  pollution  control;  the \nbasinwide  management  program;  and  transboundary  pollution \nprevention and control. \n \nThe  Project  will  secure  the  provision  of  reliable  drinking  water  to \nChangchun,  Liaoyuan,  and  Meihekou.  Recycling  wastewater  will \nreduce  water  pollution  and  address  the  water  shortage  problem. \nThis  will  have  a  catalytic  effect  on  encouraging  the  replication  of \nsimilar  optimal  and  cost-effective  approaches  to  address  water \npollution  and  water  shortage.  Of  the  total  beneficiary  population, \nabout  210,000  or  7.0%  are  classified  as  poor  measured  by  the \nlocal  urban  poverty  line  of  CNY1,875  per  year.  Major  social \nmeasures  to  protect  urban  residents  from  falling  into  poverty \n(ii) \ninclude \nunemployment insurance,  and  (iii)  social support program under \nthe  minimum  living  standard  scheme.  Further,  CMG,  LMG,  and \nMMG  have  agreed  to  implement  poverty  reduction  measures, \nincluding  (i)  implementing  lifeline  tariffs,   (ii)  providing water bill \ndiscounts or cash rebates amounting to 50% of the monthly water \nbill  for  households  living  below  the  poverty  line;  and  (iii) \nconnecting  the  poorest   households  to  tap  water  in  Liaoyuan, \n\nlaid-off  employees, \n\nliving  allowance \n\nfor \n\n(i) \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n    \n\nvii\n\nMeihekou,  and  Shuangyang  district  in  Changchun.  The  Project \nwill create a minimum of 570 permanent jobs for the operation of \nthe facilities, and 3,200 jobs during the 5-year construction period. \nFollow-on  multiplier  effects  are  expected  to  create  an  additional \n5,100  full-time  jobs.  About  half  of  the  construction  jobs  are \nunskilled and are most likely to be filled by currently unemployed \npersons. Since unemployment is a  major cause of poverty in the \nproject  area,  the  poor  will  benefit  disproportionately  from  this  job \ncreation. Public health benefits will accrue through the reduction in \nwaterborne  diseases.  The  Project  is  expected  to  reduce  disease \nepisodes  by  an  average  of  8,000  cases  per  year.  One  in  20  of \nthese  cases,  or  400  cases  annually,  are  likely  to  be  serious \nenough to result in a medical consultation. The reliable supply of \nwater will reduce the burden on women responsible for domestic \nduties  and  caring  for  the  sick.  Provision  of  clean  water  will \nimprove the quality of life of the poor and vulnerable by reducing \nthe  proportion  of  household  income  spent  on  medical  treatment \nfor  waterborne  diseases.  The  number  of  school  days  and \nworkdays  lost  due  to  sickness  will  also  be  reduced.  Further,  the \nProject  will  reduce  the  proportion  of  household  income  spent  on \nbuying water from private sources and buying storage containers, \nfilters,  and  other  water-cleaning  equipment.  Water  pressure \nimprovements will greatly enhance the quality of life of households \nliving  in  apartments  and  reduce  their  water-pumping  costs.  The \nincreased  flood  control  will  reduce  the  risk  of  infection  from \noverflowing sewers during the flooding season.  \n \nThe  Project  is  technically  sound,  affordable  to  beneficiaries,  and \nfinancially and economically viable with a financial internal rate of \nreturn  of  6.2%  (higher  than  the  real  weighted  average  cost  of \ncapital of 1.9%). The base case economic internal rate of return of \n21.1%  is  well  above  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of \n12%. \n \nPotential  institutional,  financial,  and  policy  risks  related  to  the \nProject  include  failure  of  CMG,  LMG,  and  MMG  to  (i)  implement \ninstitutional  reforms;  (ii) increase  water  and  wastewater  tariffs  to \nmeet cost-recovery targets; and (iii) meet the equity requirements \nto  implement  the  Project.  These  risks  have  been  mitigated  by \n(i) obtaining assurances from JPG, CMG, LMG, and MMG on the \nfinancial  and  managerial  autonomy  of  the  IAs;  (ii) institutional \nstrengthening  of  the  IAs;  (iii) periodic  water  tariff  reviews  and \nadjustments following the national guidelines; and (iv) provision of \ncounterpart funding. ADB review missions will monitor compliance \nwith the financial and operational covenants to ensure the IAs are \nfinancially sustainable. \n \nThe  Project  does  not  have  any  unusual  technical  risks.  The \nproject components will use standard technology that conforms to  \ninternational  standards.  Specific  construction \nrisks  will  be \nmitigated  by  the  use  of  experienced  consultants  to  prepare \ndesigns and monitor project implementation. \n\n \n\n\f\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People's Republic of China (PRC) for the Jilin Water Supply and Sewerage Development \nProject. \n \n2. \nIn  line  with  its  long-term  goals  for  the  urban  sector  of  improving  living  conditions  and \nexpanding the supply of clean water and enhancing wastewater treatment coverage, the PRC \nGovernment  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  help  increase  the  wastewater \ntreatment  capacity  and  provision  of  clean  potable  water  in  the  cities  of  Changchun,  Liaoyuan, \nand Meihekou in Jilin Province in northeastern PRC. The Project is consistent with ADB water \npolicy1  and  will  help  the  PRC  achieve  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDG)  of \nenvironmental  sustainability  and  increased  access  to  safe  drinking  water  and  basic sanitation. \nThis  report  is  based  on  the  findings  of  the  loan  appraisal  mission  and  discussions  with  the \ncentral  and  local  governments,  relevant  agencies,  and  community  organizations.  The  design \nand monitoring framework2 is in Appendix 1.  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nOver  the  last  20  years,  economic  growth  in  the  PRC  averaged  8%  per  year  and  it  is \nprojected to average 7% over the next 5 years. The urban population increased from about 190 \nmillion in 1980 to about 524 million in 2003, about 40% of the total population. This is expected \nto  increase  to  700  million  or  50%  by  2030.3  The  Government\u2019s  Agenda  for  Economic  Reform \nand  Social  Development  in  the  New  Century  aims  to  accelerate  urbanization  and  the \ndevelopment of large, medium, and small cities and small towns. This urbanization process will \ncontinue to increase the demand for all urban services. In particular, it will place a strain on the \nphysical  and  financial  capacity  of  most  cities  to  provide  adequate  water  and  wastewater \ntreatment  infrastructure.  Without  significant  investment,  quality  of  life  for  urban  residents  will \ndeteriorate,  the  urban  environment  will  be  degraded,  and  economic  development  will  be \ninefficient.  \n \n4. \nMunicipal water supply in the PRC has increased steadily in the past decade. In 2003, \ntotal water production was 28.8 billion cubic meters (m3)/day and sales 24.8 billion m3/day, with \nunaccounted  for  water  at  15%  of  total  water  production.  Industrial  and  domestic  water  sales \naccount for 35.4% and 56.4% of water sold, while other sales are 8.2%. The national average \nuse of water was 365 liters per capita per day and domestic consumption 220 liters per capita \nper day. In most large cities, more than 90% of all urban households have access to piped water \nsupply.  However,  this  indicator  obscures  shortages  in  many  cities  of  good  quality  raw  water \nsupply,  water  supply  delivery  capacities,  and  wastewater  treatment  facilities.  The  Government \nhas classified more than 300 cities as water-short, with 108 having serious water problems and \nmore  than  60  being  critically  short  of  water.  Many  of  the  cities  facing  water  shortages  are  in \nnorthern  PRC.  The  per  capita  water  availability  ranges  from  360\u2013750  m3  (lower  than  the \ninternational definition of water scarcity of 1,000 m3/person). The situation is exacerbated by the \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2001. Water for All: The Water Policy of the Asian Development Bank.

Physical  impacts  are  indicated \n\nprimarily in the \u201cActivities and Milestones\u201d section of Appendix 1. \n\n3   The Government\u2019s long-term vision for development was set out during the 16th Party Congress held in November \n\n2000 and reiterated during the 10th National People\u2019s Congress held in March 2003.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\npollution of raw water sources by the discharge of inadequately treated agricultural, municipal, \nand industrial wastewater.  \n \n5. \nThe  PRC\u2019s  urban  areas  face  environmental  threats  from  pollution  of  rivers,  lakes,  and \nunderground  aquifers  from  untreated  water.  In  2003,  about  46  billion  m3  of  wastewater  were \ngenerated, of which about 65% was from  municipal sources and 35% from industrial sources. \nCurrently, about 90% of industrial wastewater is treated before discharge to a municipal sewer. \nMunicipal wastewater is a major contributor to pollution of the PRC\u2019s rivers and lakes, with the \nmost  severe  pollution  impacts  in  the  water-short  northern  region.  Currently,  only  about  40% \n(34%  in  1999)  of  urban  wastewater  is  treated;  the  rest  is  discharged  untreated  to  rivers  and \nlakes.  In  regional  and  administratively  higher  level  cities,  only  30%  of  rivers  meet  designated \nwater  quality  standards  compared  with  the  Government  objective  of  60%  in  the  current  Tenth \nFive-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005).  About  52%  of  the  water  in  the  seven  major  river  basins4  do  not \nmeet  the  class  III5  national  quality  standard.  Surface  water  sources  serving  municipal  water \nsupply systems are polluted to levels unacceptable under water quality standards. To address \nthe  pollution  of  lakes  and  rivers,  the  following  actions  are  required  to  (i)  strengthen  laws, \nregulations,  and  institutions  to  address  transjurisdiction  pollution;  (ii)  adopt  river  basin \nmanagement  approaches  for  water  resource  management;  and  (iii)  reduce  nonpoint  pollution. \nSignificant investments are needed to solve the water shortage problems, supply clean drinking \nwater, and expand wastewater treatment capacity. \n \n6. \nRecognizing that adequate environmental protection and pollution controls are essential \nfor sustainable economic growth, the Government has incorporated environmental protection as \na  national  priority  in  its  development  strategy.  In  addition  to  enacting  environmental  protection \nlaws  and  implementing  regulations  that  emphasize  preventive  measures,  the  polluter  pays \nprinciple, and decentralized environmental management, the Government has also undertaken \nnumerous  programs  including  those  for  wastewater  management.6  Industries  were  ordered  to \ntreat wastewater to national wastewater discharge standards by the end of 2000; municipalities \nhave been required under successive 5-year plans to address wastewater collection, treatment, \nand disposal; and pollution control plans have been developed and partially implemented for the \nkey  river  basins.  The  Government  plans  to  increase  centralized  urban  wastewater  treatment \nduring  the  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan  to  increase  the  treatment  rate  to  45%.  The  Government  has \ndecreed 7 that by 2010, the wastewater treatment rate in all the PRC cities should not be lower \nthan  60%,  and  not  lower  than  70%  for  major  cities8  with  secondary  treatment  facilities.  The \ntreatment level required is dependent on water quality class for the receiving water. To achieve \nwater quality class I, II, or III, secondary wastewater treatment is normally required.  \n \n7. \nThe Government has accorded priority in the Tenth Five-Year Plan to addressing water \nsupply  and  wastewater  treatment  issues  through  policy  reform,  increased  investment,  and \nimproved  urban  infrastructure  management.  The  Government\u2019s  strategy  focuses  on  (i) \n\n                                                 \n4  Changjiang (Yangtze River), Haihe, Huaihe, Huanghe Liaohe, Songhuajiang, and Zhujiang.  \n5   The  PRC  water  quality  standards  have  five  classes  of  quality  covering  about  40  pollution  parameters.  Class  I  is \npristine,  while  class  V  is  suitable  only  for  industrial  use.  Class  III  is  the  minimum  water  quality  required  for \nmunicipal water supply. \n\n6  The PRC Law on Prevention and Control of Water Pollution was first adopted in 1984 and amended in 1996. The \nlaw  was  enacted  to  prevent  and  control  water  pollution,  protect  and  improve  the  environment,  safeguard  human \nhealth,  and  ensure  effective  utilization  of  water  resources.  The  law  also  establishes  the  standards  for  water \nenvironment  quality  and  for  discharge  of  water  pollutants;  and  enumerates  the  planning,  supervision,  and \nmanagement of the prevention and control of water pollution. \n\n7  Ministry  of  Construction.  2000.  Publication  of  Urban  Wastewater  Treatment  and  Control  Technology  Advice. \n\nBeijing. \n\n8  These include cities directly under the central Government, provincial capital cities, and key tourist cities. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\ndeveloping water sources; (ii) protecting existing sources by controlling industrial and residential \npollution;  (iii)  controlling  overextraction  from  groundwater  resources;  (iv)  introducing  water \nefficient  technologies  and  operations;  and  (v)  using  appropriate  pricing  mechanisms  to \nencourage  conservation  and  generate  necessary  funds  for  operation,  maintenance,  and \ninvestment. The Government\u2019s ongoing economic and enterprise reform programs require that \nall  water  supply  and  wastewater  projects  be  financially  sustainable  and  capable  of  cost \nrecovery. The water supply and wastewater sector analysis is given in Appendix 2. \n \nB. \n \n8. \nKey  problems  and  opportunities  include  (i)  shortage  of  good  quality  drinking  water;  (ii) \ninadequate  wastewater  treatment  capacity;  (iii)  land  subsidence  arising  from  the  overuse  of \ngroundwater;  and  (iv)  the  need  to  assist  water  supply  and  wastewater  treatment  to  be  self-\nfinancing  through  tariff  reforms.  Assistance  is  required  to  help  the  Government  achieve  the \nMDG  for  environmental  sustainability  (MDG  goal  7)  and  to  halve  the  proportion  of  people \nwithout sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015 (MDG target 10).  \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nBackground and Long-Term Plans for the Songhua River Basin \n\n \n9. \nThe  Songhua  River  Basin  (SRB)  is  the  third  largest  river  basin  in  the  PRC  after  the \nYangtze and Yellow rivers. It has an area of 557,000 square kilometers (km2) and a population \nof  62  million.  Major  cities,  such  as  Harbin  and  Changchun,  and  the  country\u2019s  largest  oil  fields \nare located in the basin. Agriculture is well developed and the basin has a large industrial base. \nThe Songhua river catchment area covers portions of Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces and Inner \nMongolia Autonomous Region. Changchun is located in the upstream part of the Sonhua River, \nwhich  flows  through  Harbin.  After  Harbin,  the  river  joins  the  Heilongjiang  River,  enters  the \nRussian Federation, and eventually discharges to the sea (Map 1).  \n \nThe Songhua River is one of the most polluted of the 47  major rivers in the PRC. It is \n10. \ncontaminated  with  a  number  of  organic  chemicals,  heavy  metals,  and  conventional  pollutants \nthat result mainly from the discharge of untreated or partially treated wastewater, primarily from \nindustries upstream from Harbin. The river is classified by the Government as class IV (falling \nbelow  class  V  during  the  6-month,  low-flow  winter  season),  and  is  considered  unsuitable  for \nmunicipal domestic water use. The river water parameters consistently fail to meet PRC class III \nstandards, the minimum water quality required for the water to be used as a raw water source \nfor  water  supply.  In  March  2003,  ADB  approved  the  Harbin  Water  Supply  Project  for  $100 \nmillion to address the needs of Harbin city (population of 3 million) for clean and reliable drinking \nwater from an alternative water source (Lalin River), since their existing source\u2014the Songhua \nRiver\u2014was highly polluted. Because of the deteriorating water quality in the Songhua River, the \nHarbin Municipal Government is expediting construction of the project, which is on track to be \ncompleted ahead of the original schedule.9 From 2001 to 2005, Heilongjiang Province has taken \nconcrete actions to reduce pollution into the SRB, immediately upstream of Harbin City, namely, \nfrom  the  cities  of  Daqing  and  Qiqihar.  Daqing  City  constructed  a  50,000  m3/day  wastewater \ntreatment plant (WWTP) in 2001, and a second WWTP with a capacity of 80,000 m3/day will be \nin  operation  in  2005.  The  current  wastewater  treatment  rate  in  Daqing  of  50%  is  expected  to \nreach 70% by 2008. Qiqihar City constructed a 350,000 m3/day WWTP, which started operating \nin  November  2003.  In  addition,  Harbin  commissioned  a  163,000  m3/day  WWTP  in  2004  and \n\n                                                 \n9  ADB.  2003.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for the Harbin Water Supply Project. Manila. As of May 2005, overall physical progress \nof the Project was 60% against elapsed time of 40%.   \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\nanother  WWTP  with  a  capacity  of  325,000  m3/day  is  under  construction.  In  addition,  to  help \naddress  SRB  pollution,  ADB  has  provided  TA  for  Songhua  River  Basin  Water  Quality  and \nPollution  Control  Management.10  The  ongoing  TA  is  (i)  addressing  technical  knowledge  gaps; \n(ii)  strengthening  the  capacity  of  the  Songhua  Water  Resources  Protection  Bureau;  and  (iii) \nhelping  the  Government  develop  a  long-term  water  pollution  control  plan  for  the  SRB  beyond \n2010. The TA will provide strategic policy inputs to the Eleventh Five-Year Plan and will propose \na  prioritized  list  of  wastewater  and  sewerage  development  projects  to  clean  up  the  SRB.  The \nproposed  Project  will  be  the  first  major  ADB  investment  directly  contributing  to  the  cleanup  of \nthe SRB. In addition, a new law on management of water resources adopted in 200211 formally \nintroduces the concept of river basin management. The State Environment Protection Bureau is \ntaking the lead role in coordinating the issues of SRB pollution and has developed a Five-Year \nSonghua  Pollution  Control  Plan,  which  is  the  first  of  the  concrete  steps  needed  to  return  the \nSonghua River to meet the minimum water quality levels.  \n \n\nProject Rationale  \n\n2. \n \nChangchun,  the  capital  of  Jilin  Province,  has  an  urban  population  of  3  million.  It  is \n11. \nlocated in the upper reaches of the SRB, between the provinces of Heilongjiang and Liaoning. \nThe rivers in Changchun (Yitong and Yongchun rivers), which flow into the Songhua River, are \nhighly polluted due to inadequate treatment of wastewater discharge. Jilin Province, therefore, \nhas a critical role to play in wastewater management in the upstream of the SRB. The current \nwater  quality  in  the  Yitong  and  Yongchun  rivers  does  not  meet  class  V  of  the  national  water \nquality standards; this has caused severe pollution of the Songhua River, and poses a threat to \npublic health of the urban population and downstream users. Changchun has inadequate water \nsupply and wastewater treatment. Further, water shortage is expected to reach 360,000 m3/day \nby  2010  and  water  rationing  is  sometimes  implemented.  Changchun\u2019s  current  wastewater \ntreatment capacity of 565,000 m3/day is inadequate and has already resulted in heavy pollution \nof  the  Yitong  and  Yongchun  rivers.  To  meet  future  demands,  this  capacity  needs  to  be \nincreased to 803,000 m3/day by 2010 and 1,700,000 m3/day by 2020. The sewer network and \nwastewater treatment capacity in Changchun must be expanded to improve water quality in the \nYitong and Yongchun rivers. Through the Project, the discharge of untreated wastewater in the \nupstream  of  the  SRB  will  be  significantly  reduced.  The  Project  will  also  contribute  to  the \nChangchun municipal government (CMG) goal of achieving a wastewater treatment rate of 70% \nby  2010.  The  Project\u2019s  rationale  is  consistent  with  the  ADB  water  policy,  which  aims  to  foster \nintegrated management of water resources from a river basin perspective.  \n \nShuangyang  district,  which  is  located  46  km  southeast  of  Changchun,  has  an  urban \n12. \npopulation  of  85,000.  Shuangyang\u2019s  current  drinking  water  source  is  groundwater.  This  is \ndepleting the aquifer beneath the city resulting in land subsidence. To address the current water \nshortage  (20,000  m3/day)  and  increased  demand  through  2010,  the  proposed  water  supply \nsubproject  will  convey  class  II  raw  water  (39,000  m3/day)  from  the  existing  Shuangyang \nReservoir,  to  a  water  treatment  plant  (WTP)  constructed  under  the  project  which  would  be \nconnected to the existing distribution network. \n \nLiaoyuan,  with  a  population  of  470,000,  has  an  aging  water  treatment  and  distribution \n13. \nsystem  suffering  from  persistent  corrosion,  adversely  affecting  the  system\u2019s  treatment  and \n\n                                                 \n10  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Songhua River Water Quality and Pollution \n\nControl Management. Manila. \n\n11  The  Law  on  the  Management  of  Water  Resources  was  approved  by  the  Standing  Committee  of  the  National \n\nPeople\u2019s Congress on 29 August 2002 and became effective 1 October 2002. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\nconveyance capacity. The water reticulation systems, particularly in low-pressure zones, cannot \ncope with the city\u2019s supply requirements. Liaoyuan also has aging drainage systems dominated \nby  combined  storm-water  drainage  and  sewerage  systems.  Wastewater  has  caused  serious \ndrainage  system  deterioration.  Some  of  the  drains  are  constantly  blocked  because  of  low \ncapacity,  leakage,  and  poor  maintenance.  During  heavy  rainfall,  surface  runoff  from  nearby \nmountain terrain carries large quantities of grit and mud from the degraded soil and landscape \nto  the  drainage  systems,  causing  blockage  to  the  drainage  systems  and  flooding  that  in  turn \ndisrupts city traffic and results in economic losses. \n \n14.  Meihekou,  with  a  population  of  629,000,  uses  solely  groundwater  for  its  drinking  water \nsupply. The groundwater sources are estimated to have a capacity of 13,600 m3/day. However, \nwithdrawals are now 16,900 m3/day. Prolonged overextraction has resulted in the formation of a \ndrawdown zone of 2.5 km2 in the vicinity of the underground water source. As a result of heavy \nindustrial  water  demand,  the  groundwater  level  has  fallen  by  9  meters,  resulting  in  land \nsubsidence in some areas of the city. The distribution networks within the city have deteriorated \ndue  to  aging  and  lack  of  maintenance.  The  leakage  of  the  water  mains  is  serious  and  the \nleakage  rate  reaches  approximately  30%,  resulting  in  inadequate  water  pressure,  unreliable \nwater supply, and the need for occasional water rationing. \n \n15. \nThe  Project  will  contribute  significantly  to  water  pollution  control  within  the  SRB  and \nwithin Jilin Province by improving wastewater collection and treatment. The project components \nand  subcomponents  include  sewage  treatment  with  effluent  reuse,  drainage  and  sewerage \nnetworks,  water  supply  and  distribution  networks,  and  flood  mitigation.  Water  pollution  and \nwater  scarcity  are  recognized  as  major  problems:  the  Project  is  a  major  urban  infrastructure \ninitiative  under  Jilin\u2019s  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005).  Downstream  beneficiaries  include \nresidents of Heilongjiang Province.  \n  \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\n3. \n \n\n16.  The  Project  supports  and  strengthens  ADB  policy  dialogue  and  initiatives  with  the \nGovernment  in  several  key  areas  including  (i)  cost  recovery  and  tariff  reform,  (ii)  adoption  of \nwater  purchase  agreements,  (iii)  wastewater  management,  (iv)  upstream  pollution  prevention \nand  control,  (v)  water  conservation,  (vi)  corporate  governance  and  enterprise  reform,  and  (vii) \nwatershed  management  (Appendix  3).  The  reform  agenda  for  water  supply  and  wastewater \nmanagement moved forward significantly with the introduction of tariffs and enterprise reforms, \nstrengthening of legal and regulatory frameworks, and promotion of private sector participation. \nADB  has  supported  the  water  supply  tariff  reform  process  through  two  completed  water  tariff \nstudies12 with the Ministry of Construction under which the National Guidelines on Water Tariffs \nwere  developed,  promulgated,  and  implemented.  The  proposed  Project  is  noteworthy  as  a \nmajor water supply and wastewater treatment investment in which the national guidelines and \nthe  principle  of  funding  investments  directly  from  tariffs  are  being  implemented  in  the  PRC. \nFurther, ADB\u2019s wastewater tariff study TA13 developed national guidelines for wastewater tariffs, \nincluding  tariff  calculation  methodologies  that  allow  for  full  cost  recovery  taking  into \nconsideration  affordability  and  social  constraints.  The  TA  also  recommended  options  for \nencouraging multi-channel investment, including private sector participation in urban wastewater \nmanagement. \n\n                                                 \n12  ADB. 1997.

The  ongoing  ADB  TAs  will  strengthen  ADB\u2019s  role  in  promoting \nprivate  sector  participation  in  water  supply  and  wastewater  management.  During  project \nprocessing,  the  main  features  of  the  ADB-supported  Chengdu  build-operate-transfer  project \nwere  discussed  with  CMG,  Liaoyuan  municipal  government  (LMG),  Meihekou  municipal \ngovernment  (MMG),  and  the  implementing  agencies  (IAs);  they  indicated  interest  in  this \nmodality of private sector involvement for future investments. Completed in February 2002, the \nbuild-operate-transfer  plant  is  delivering  its  contracted  capacity  to  Chengdu  municipality, \nproviding an additional source of clean water to its residents. The proposed Project will create \nthe environment necessary for eventual private sector participation by pursuing tariff reform, full \ncost  recovery,  enterprise  reform,  and  improved  governance;  all  are  prerequisites  for  private \nsector  involvement.  Other  modalities  of  private sector  participation,  including  leasing  contracts \nand  joint  ventures,  were  also  assessed  and  discussed.  For  the  proposed  Project,  the  IAs \nindicated their strong intent to list in one of the regional stock exchanges once the plants have \ncompleted the mandatory 3-year period for commercial operations. \n \n\nLessons Learned \n\n4. \n \n18. \nADB  has  provided  more  than  $1.7  billion  in  loans  for  wastewater  and  water  supply \nprojects in the PRC (Appendix 4). Loan projects have generally been implemented well. During \nproject  processing,  lessons  of  experience  were  addressed  by  (i)  thoroughly  evaluating  the \ntechnical  designs  and  technologies;  (ii)  ensuring  an  adequate  debt-equity  ratio  for  the  project \nIAs;  (iii)  undertaking  rigorous  sensitivity  analysis  of  cash  flows,  and  financial  and  economic \nanalysis;  and  (iv)  incorporating  institutional  strengthening  measures  to  improve  the  level  of \ncorporate governance.  \n \n19. \nLessons  learned  from  ADB  postevaluation  experience  in  water  supply  and  sanitation \nhighlight  the  importance  of  integrating  both  supply  and  demand  concerns  into  project  design. \nEncouraging broad reforms, such as commercial management, and introducing competition will \npromote efficient and responsive delivery of water supply and wastewater services. Appropriate \npricing policies for water and sanitation services are also required. Lessons learned include (i) \nthe importance of a thorough review of technical designs; (ii) the need for strategic master plans \nin urban development and environmental management; (iii) consideration of local conditions and \nconstraints;  (iv)  the  importance  of  measures  to  support  financial  reform,  particularly  in \nestablishing  autonomous  wastewater  entities  and  tariff  increases;  (v)  the  need  for  institutional \nstrengthening,  particularly  in  establishing  managerial  autonomy;  (vi)  the  need  to  address \nregulatory  and  enforcement  issues;  (vii)  the  importance  of  public  education  on  environmental \nimprovement; (viii) the need to provide training to utility personnel; (ix) better public consultation \nand  community  participation;  (x)  early  attention  to  resettlement  issues;  and  (xi)  the  need  to \nsupport public-private partnerships in water supply and wastewater treatment.  \n \n \n\n                                                 \n14   ADB. 2003.

The outcome of the Project will \nbe improved management and utilization of water resources in the SRB by (i) achieving the goal \nof  70%  wastewater  treatment  rate  in  Changchun  by  2010;  (ii)  solving  the  water  shortage \nproblem  through  effluent  reuse;  (iii)  increasing  flood  control;  (iv)  providing  a  supply  of  reliable \nand  high-quality  potable  water;  (v)  reducing  the  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases  such  as \ndiarrhea  and  hepatitis  A;  (vi)  increasing  the  efficiency  and  management  capacity  of  the  IAs;16 \n(vii)  integrating  approaches  for  basinwide  pollution  prevention  and  control;  and  (viii)  improving \ncost  recovery  through  a  better  tariff  structure,  with  gradual  increases  to  achieve  full  cost \nrecovery.  \n \nB. \n \n21.  The Project has five physical components that involve the improvement and expansion of \nthe  (i)  Changchun  wastewater  treatment  and  sewerage  system,  (ii)  Shuangyang  water  supply \nsystem,  (iii)  Changchun  Yongchun  River  flood  control  capacity,  (iv)  Liaoyuan  water  supply \nsystem,  and  (v)  Meihekou  water  supply  system.  The  Project  also  includes  capacity  building \n(Supplementary Appendix A) to support project management and implementation, by improving \nthe capabilities of the project management office (PMO) and implementing agencies (IAs). The \ndetailed description of the physical components is given Supplementary Appendix B.  \n \n22. \nThe  improvement  and  expansion  of  wastewater  services  in  Changchun  includes  (i) \nupgrading the existing Beijiao primary WWTP to secondary treatment with a capacity of 130,000 \nm3/day including recycling of treated wastewater; (ii) constructing sewerage pipelines, pumping \nstations,  and  maintenance  and  management  stations;  and  (iii)  constructing  a  150,000  m3/day \nNanjiao  WWTP  including  recycling  of  treated  wastewater.  These  improvements  will  result  in \n70%  of  the  wastewater  treated  and  wastewater  services  coverage  increased  to  85%  of  the \nurban population in Changchun by 2010. The improvement and expansion of the Shuangyang \nwater  supply  system  involves  constructing  a  WTP  with  a  capacity  of  36,000  m3/day,  with  a \nrelated  water  pumping  station  to  extract  surface  water  from  Shuanyuang  reservoir,  and \npipelines to convey treated water from the WTP to the district\u2019s distribution network.  \n \n23. \nThe  Changchun  Yongchun  River  flood  control  improvement  component  involves \nimproving  the  dam  and  spillway  of  the  Sanjia  reservoir,  widening  the  Yongchun  River,  and \nconstructing seven new box culverts.  \n \n\n                                                 \n15  Based  on  review  of  work  completed  by  World  Bank  and  Department  for  International  Development  (United \nKingdom), indicators based on water quality service standards should be used to monitor the health impact of the \nProject. In addition, a direct measure of the risk of exposure to pathogens in the water supply should also be used, \nsuch  as  the  occurrence  of  Escherichia  coli  in  tap  water  monitored  in  the  distribution  system.  Data  on  disease \nincidence (diarrhea  and  hepatitis A) can also be monitored as a composite indicator  of the impact of this Project \nand other public health measures affecting these diseases.   \n\n16  The  IAs  include  (i)  Changchun  Water  Group  Urban  Drainage  Company,  (ii)  Changchun  High-Tech  Industry \nDevelopment  Company,  (iii)  Liaoyuan  Water  Group  Company,  (iv)  Meihekou  Water  Supply  Company,  and  (v) \nShuangyang Water Supply Company. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe improvement and expansion of the water supply and sewerage system in Liaoyuan \n24. \nincludes  (i)  upgrading  two  existing  WTPs  to  enable  full  utilization  of  their  design  capacity;  (ii) \nimproving the water distribution network by constructing booster pumping stations, rehabilitating \nexisting  water  supply  networks,  and  laying  new  water  supply  pipelines;  (iii)  upgrading  the \ndrainage/sewerage  network  to  separate  the  drainage  and  sewerage  systems  including \nconstructing  sewerage  pipelines  and  three  wastewater  pumping  stations;  and  (iv)  constructing \nstorm-water  open  channels  and  box  culverts  to  collect  mountain  terrain  runoff  for  flood \nmitigation.  \n \n25. \nThe  improvement  and  expansion  of  the  Meihekou  water  supply  system  includes  (i) \nconstructing  a  WTP  with  a  capacity  of  100,000  m3/day  and  a  40  km  raw  water  transmission \npipeline to convey surface water from the Hailong reservoir to the WTP, and (ii) upgrading 56 \nkm  of  the  existing  water  distribution  network.  Under  the  institutional  capacity  building \ncomponent, the PMO and IAs will develop expertise in (i) efficient operation of the facilities; (ii) \nfunctional areas covering administration, finance, accounting, and business planning; (iii) human \nresource development; and (iv) cost-recovery and financial sustainability aspects including tariff \nreview  and  increases  to  reflect  inflation,  increasing  operating  costs,  and  managing  currency \nfluctuations and collections. \n \n26. \nBeneficial outputs include increased access to and improved quality of water supply and \nwastewater services, protection from flooding, and elimination of hazards associated with poor \ndrainage.  These  benefits  fall  disproportionately  to  women  and  the  poor.  Women  benefit \nbecause they now assume primary responsibility for measures taken to cope with flooding, and \npoor water supply and wastewater services. The poor will benefit because they can least afford \nto pay for these coping mechanisms. Moreover, existing and proposed cost-recovery measures \nand poverty reduction policies protect the poor from any increases in tariffs required to finance \nthe subprojects. \n \nC. \n \n27. \nThe funding of the Project directly from water and wastewater tariffs is a major reform in \nline  with  the  ADB  water  policy.  This  is  expected  to  reduce  water  consumption  and  increase \nrecycling of industrial water. ADB involvement in the Project, coupled with water tariff increases, \nis  expected  to  have  a  catalytic  effect  in  attracting  future  private  sector  participation.  Recycling \nwastewater at a rate of 150,000 m3/day will have two significant benefits: reduce water pollution \nand  address  water  shortage  problems.  Further,  the  demonstration  of  a  successful  wastewater \nrecycling subproject will encourage replication of similar optimal and cost-effective approaches \nto address water pollution and water shortage. \n \n28. \nTo  safeguard  the  quality  of  water  from  the  Shuangyang  reservoir  for  the  Shuangyang \nwater supply and the Hailong reservoir for the Meihekou water supply, and to prevent pollution \nin the upstream part of these reservoirs, Shuangyang and Meihekou water resource protection \ncommittees  will  be  established  before  August  2005.  They  will  coordinate  and  facilitate \nenvironmental  monitoring  and  mitigation,  and  address  the  interests  of  stakeholders,  before, \nduring, and after project implementation. Plans include (i) closing off the reservoir to the general \npublic,  and  (ii) restricting  access  to  the  catchment  areas  to  prevent  any  pollution  entering  the \nwater system upstream.17 The committees will increase environmental awareness in the project \narea, develop cooperation between various regional stakeholders by sharing data, and provide \na forum for discussion of environmental issues not related to the Project. The committees will be \n\nSpecial Features \n\n                                                 \n17  Three concentric reservoir protection zones will prevent development activities.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\nCost Estimates \n\nchaired  by  the  vice  mayor  of  Meheikou  and/or  Shuangyang,  and  comprise  members  of \nconcerned provincial and municipal environment protection bureaus, IAs, and civil society.  \n  \nD. \n \n29. \nThe  total  project  cost  is  $232.2  million  equivalent,  including  foreign  exchange  cost  of \n$110.8  million  (48%)  and  local  currency  cost  of  $121.4  million  equivalent  (52%).

A project steering committee (PSC) was established, \nheaded  by  the  JPG  vice  governor  and  comprising  the  heads  of  the  Jilin  Development  Reform \nCommission;  Jilin  Construction  Commission;  Jilin  Finance  Bureau;  and  the  mayors  of  CMG, \nLMG,  and  MMG.  The  PSC  will  provide  overall  policy  guidance,  facilitate  interagency \ncoordination,  and  resolve  any  institutional  problems  affecting  project  implementation.  A  PMO \nwas established at the JPG level led by the Jilin Construction Commission. The PMO will also \nbe  the  PSC  secretariat.  Project  implementing  units  (PIUs),  established  in  CMG,  LMG,  and \nMMG,  will  report  to  the  PMO,  and  coordinate  and  monitor  activities  of  the  IAs.  The  IAs  are \n\n                                                 \n18  The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China has issued a letter of commitment for the domestic loans. The loans \ncarry an interest rate of 6.1% per annum with a maturity of 11 years, including a grace period of 4 years. Analysis \nof the cash flow obligations of CMG, LMG, and MMG indicate that they have sufficient financial resources to meet \ntheir counterpart financing obligations under the Project.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11\n\n \n\nlimited  liability  companies  incorporated  under  the  PRC  company  law  with  initial  registered \ncapital. A board of directors will oversee financial and operational matters of the IAs including \n(i) hiring  and  firing  senior  management,  (ii) reviewing  staffing  and  remuneration  plans, \n(iii) reviewing construction progress and approving annual construction plans, (iv) reviewing and \napproving annual financial budgets, (v) reviewing investment plans and accounts of the IAs, and \n(vi) approving procurement of major equipment and civil works contracts. The IAs will increase \ntheir  staff  strength  significantly  for  the  construction  period  and  when  operations  begin.  A \nfinancial  management  assessment  of  the  internal  controls,  and  accounting  and  auditing \nprocedures of the IAs found them to be generally in order and they will be fully functional and \navailable for use under the Project for the construction and operational phases (Appendix 7). An \nassessment  of  the  IAs\u2019  technical  and  institutional  capacities  found  them  to  be  adequate  for \nproject  implementation.  The  detailed  financial  management  assessment  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix  D.  IA  organization  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  E.  The  IAs\u2019  current  and  projected \nfinancial  position  is  detailed  in  Supplementary  Appendix  F.  The  IAs  will  retain  the  services  of \ndesign  institutes,  specialist  procurement  agencies,  and  construction  supervision  companies  to \nhelp  with  implementation.  The  PMO  and  IAs  will  have  several  staff  trained  in  project \nmanagement and relevant ADB procedures during project implementation.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n \nThe Project will be implemented over 5 years from 2005 to the end of 2009 (Appendix \n34. \n8).  This  schedule  is  considered  realistic  as  the  project  implementation  structure  is  already  in \nplace and preparatory works are under way. ADB\u2019s successful experience in similar projects in \nthe  PRC,  and  JPG\u2019s  and  the  IAs\u2019  in-depth  knowledge  and  experience  in  water  supply  and \nwastewater treatment projects indicates that this schedule is achievable. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \nEquipment, materials and goods, and services financed by the loan will be procured in \n35. \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement and follow ADB procedures for international \ncompetitive  bidding  (ICB)  for  packages  each  with  a  value  greater  than  $1.0 million.  Packages \nvalued  at  $1.0  million  or  less  will  be  procured  following  international  shopping  procedures; \npackages  valued  at  $100,000  and  less  will  be  procured  through  direct  purchase  procedures. \nCivil  works  contracts  costing  more  than  $10  million  will  be  procured  using  ICB.  Civil  works \ncontracts  valued  at  $10  million  equivalent  or  less  can  be  procured  using  local  competitive \nbidding procedures in accordance with the PRC Tendering and Bidding Law and the respective \nprocurement  regulations.19  Selection  and  engagement  of  contractors  will  be  subject  to  ADB \napproval.20 Indicative procurement packages are listed in Appendix 9. Major equipment will be \npurchased through ICB procedures and financed by the ADB loan. The internationally tendered \nequipment  packages  will  include  necessary  technical  support  for  ensuring  proper  installation, \ntesting,  commissioning,  and  training  of  operational  staff  as  part  of  the  related  contracts.  In \naccordance  with  ADB  requirements,  foreign  contractors  may  participate  in  bidding  for  local \ncompetitive bidding contracts. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n19  ADB.  1997.

Advance action will include (i) prequalification of contractors, tendering, and bid \nevaluation  for  civil  works  contract  packages;  and  (ii)  preparation  of  tender  documents  for  the \nprocurement  of  materials,  plant,  equipment,  and  vehicles.  Such  advance  action  will  cover  the \nperiod  from  the  end  of  the  Appraisal  Mission  visit  until  loan  effectiveness.  The  issuance  of \ninvitations  to  bid  or  to  prequalify  under  advance  procurement  action  will  be  subject  to  ADB \napproval.21  All  advance  procurement  actions  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB \nGuidelines on Procurement. The Government and JPG were advised that approval of advance \naction does not commit ADB to finance the Project.  \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n37. \nConsulting  services  will  be  required  to  (i)  build  the  capacity  of  PMO  and  IA  staff;  (ii) \nmonitor  construction  and  operation;  and  (iii)  monitor  resettlement.  A  consultant  firm  will  be \nrecruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants using the quality and \ncost-based  selection  method.  Provision  has  been  made  for  30  person-months  of  international \nand 120 person-months of domestic consulting services to be funded under the loan, to support \nthe PMO, PIUs, and IAs in project implementation and capacity building. These tasks include (i) \nreview  of  designs,  specifications,  and  tender  documents;  (ii)  construction  supervision,  quality \ncontrol,  and  related  monitoring  of  progress  during  project  implementation;  (iii)  training  for  the \nPMO,  PIUs,  and  IAs  in  finance,  accounting,  mechanical,  and  operation  and  maintenance \n(O&M), including leakage detection; (iv) development of a management information system for \nthe PMO, PIUs, and the IAs; (v) social, resettlement, and environmental monitoring; (vi) review \nof project water and wastewater tariffs, and impact on retail tariffs based on actual investment \ncost; (vii) project management; (viii) efficient operating procedures; (ix) preventive maintenance; \n(x)  financial  management;  (xi)  human  resource  development;  (xii)  corporate  governance;  and \n(xiii)  provision  of  advice  to  the  PMO  and  IAs  on  performance  improvements  including \nmanagement  of  nonrevenue  water.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix G. Capacity building for the IAs will also include hands-on domestic and international \ntraining  on  project  facilities.  The  consultants  will  assist  the  PMO  with  ADB  procedures  and \ntesting,  commissioning,  O&M,  and \nreporting,  procurement,  quality  control,  start-up \nimplementation of the project performance management system.  \n \n\n6. \n\nResettlement Monitoring \n\n \n38. \nADB requires monitoring and evaluation of the resettlement and resettlers for at least 2 \nyears  after  the  resettlement  program  has  been  completed.  The  PMO  and  IAs  will  retain  the \nservices  of  a  domestic  monitor,  to  be  engaged  by  the  PMO  (and  one  international  social \nspecialist under the consulting services). The monitor will visit the sites semiannually to review \nprogress  made  and  the  general  welfare  of  those  resettled,  make  recommendations  to  resolve \nany issues/problems, and support the training programs. The monitor will pay special attention \nto  programs  to  help  resettlers  experiencing  difficulties  to  regain  their  preproject  standard  of \nliving. Monitoring and evaluation reports will be prepared and simultaneously submitted to ADB, \nPMO, PIUs, and IAs. \n\n \n \n\n                                                 \n21 Advance action was approved on 22 February 2005. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13\n\n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n39. \nTo  make  adequate  amounts  of  the  project  loan  proceeds  available  on  a  timely  basis, \nJilin  Provincial  Finance  Bureau  will  establish  an  imprest  account  after  loan  effectiveness  in \naccordance  with  the  ADB  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  Disbursements  from  the  imprest \naccount will be supported by an appropriate withdrawal application and related documentation. \nSuch documentation will demonstrate, among other things, that the goods and/or services were \n(i) produced  in  and  procured  from  ADB  member  countries,  and  (ii) eligible  for  ADB  financing. \nThe initial amount to be deposited in the imprest account will not exceed 6 months of estimated \nexpenditure  for  the  Project  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount,  whichever  is  lower.  ADB  statement  of \nexpenditures  procedure  may  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures  and  to  liquidate \nadvances  in  amounts  not  exceeding  $200,000  equivalent  per  item  of  expenditure.22  The \nonlending  agreement  along  with  the  legal  opinion  regarding  a  project  component  will  be \nrequired as a condition of disbursement for the concerned project component. \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n40. \nSound  auditing  is  an  important  element  of  good  governance  and  an  important \nanticorruption  measure.  ADB  is  helping  strengthen  the  PRC  auditing  system.  The  IAs  will \nmaintain  records  adequate  to  identify  goods  and  services  financed  out  of  the  loan  proceeds, \nfollowing accounting principles and practices prescribed by the PRC Accounting Law. The law \nrequires  enterprises  to  prepare  financial  statements  and  generally  follow  internationally \naccepted  accounting  standards.  The  IAs  will  maintain  separate  project  accounts  and  records. \nThe financial statements of the project accounts and the annual corporate financial statements \nfor IAs will  be subject to external audit by the  Changchun, Liaoyuan,  and Meihekou municipal \naudit bureaus; Jilin Provincial Audit Bureau; and State Audit Administration. The audits will be \ncarried  out  in  accordance  with  regulations  for  auditing  approved  by  the  State  Council  in  1993 \nand will meet ADB requirements. A separate auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the imprest account \nand statement of expenditure will be incorporated in the audit reports. The IAs\u2019 annual audited \nfinancial  statements  and  audited  project  accounts  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  no  later  than  6 \nmonths after the end of the fiscal year for the entire implementation period.23 The Government, \nJPG,  CMG,  LMG,  MMG,  and  IAs  have  been  informed  about  ADB  policy  on  submission  of \naudited financial statements and possible penalties for delays in submission. JPG and the IAs \nwill  submit  reports  and  information  to  ADB  concerning  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds,  project \nimplementation, and IA performance. They will include (i) quarterly progress reports on project \nimplementation; (ii) annual reports; and (iii) a project completion report, not later than 3 months \nafter completion of the project facilities.  \n  \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Management System \n\n \n The project performance management system indicators include water and wastewater \n41. \ntreatment  service  levels,  treated  wastewater  quality,  percentage  of  wastewater  collected  and \ntreated,  user  satisfaction  with  the  urban  environment,  nonrevenue  water,  water  conservation, \ntreated  water  quality,  and  other  measures  of  operational  performance;  relevant  social  and \neconomic data, such as income, health and gender, incidence of waterborne diseases including \ndiarrhea and hepatitis A, and levels of Escherichia coli in tap water. These will permit monitoring \n\n                                                 \n22 Limits for the imprest account and the statement of expenditure are in accordance with the recent review of ADB\u2019s \n\nPRC portfolio and to facilitate improved efficiency in loan disbursement. \n\n23 IAs  currently  have  three  tiers  of  audit  including  (i)  internal  audit,  (ii)  municipal  government  level  audit,  and  (iii) \n\nprovincial and state government level audit. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\nlife, \n\ntreatment \n\n(iii) resettlement, \n\n(iv) physical  completion, \n\nto  (i) improved  water  supply  and  wastewater \n\nof  project  impacts  on  improved  living  conditions  and  economic  opportunities;  number  of \nconnections  provided  to  the  poor;  and  number  of  people  benefiting  from  lifeline  tariffs.  These \nfacilities  and  services, \nrelate \n(ii) improved  quality  of \n(v) institutional \nstrengthening,  and  (vi) policy  reforms.  The  Project  provides  for  baseline  and  follow-up \nsocioeconomic and health impact surveys in years, three, four, and five of project construction. \nThe  surveys  will  collect  necessary  information  on  the  target  population  (disaggregated  by \npoor/nonpoor  status)  to  monitor  coverage  of  the  poor  and  impact  on  public  health  against  the \nbaseline survey data as the new water is distributed and wastewater treatment rate increases \nthroughout  the  project  area.  The  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases  will  be  monitored  with \nreference  to  official  health  statistics  and  using  the  socioeconomic  survey  as  a  cross-check  to \nobtain  beneficiary  views  on  the  extent  that  public  health  is  showing  real  improvements  as  a \nresult  of  the  Project.  The  IAs  will  finalize  the  project  performance  management  system \nframework,  confirm  achievable  goals,  firm  up  monitoring  and  recording  arrangements,  and \nestablish systems and procedures no later than 6 months after loan effectiveness. The IAs, with \nthe assistance of the consultants, will monitor and assess activities, and report to ADB quarterly \non  the  physical  implementation;  resettlement;  environment;  and  social,  poverty,  and  financial \naspects  of  the  Project  to  ensure  that  impacts  are  monitored  and  reported  in  line  with  ADB \nrequirements.  \n \n\n10. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \n42. \nThe  ADB  anticorruption  policy  was  explained  to  central  and  local  government  officials. \nAttention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption that was added to ADB Guidelines \nfor  Procurement,  particularly  the  need  for  bidders,  suppliers,  and  contractors  to  observe  the \nhighest  standards  of  ethics  in  the  procurement  and  execution  of  ADB-financed  contracts,  and \nthe sanctions to be applied if fraud and corruption are discovered. The anticorruption provisions \nadded  to  ADB  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  were  discussed.  For  the  Project,  CMG, \nLMG, and  MMG  will undertake the following anticorruption actions: (i) involve full-time officials \nfrom  the  Changchun,  Liaoyuan,  and  Meihekou  municipal  discipline  investigation  bureaus  in \nbidding and construction; (ii) introduce a dual-signing system, in which the civil works contract \nwinner also signs an anticorruption contract with the employer; and (iii) periodically inspect the \ncontractor\u2019s activities related to fund withdrawals and settlements.  \n \n\n11. \n\nProject Review \n\n \nBesides  regular  ADB  review  missions,  ADB  and  the  Government  will  undertake  a \n43. \ncomprehensive  midterm  review,  2  years  after  project  implementation  begins.  This  review  will \ninclude  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  resettlement, \nachievement of scheduled targets, and progress on the agenda for policy reform and capacity-\nbuilding  measures. A  review  of  retail  water  tariffs  in  Changchun,  Liaoyuan,  and  Meihekou  will \nalso be undertaken.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nProject Benefits and Impacts \n\n \nA. \n \n44. \nThe  Project  will  benefit  about  3  million  urban  residents  whose  living  conditions  and \npublic  health  standards  will  be  improved  due  to  (i)  improved  quality  of  water  supply  and \nwastewater services, protection from flooding, and elimination of hazards associated with poor \ndrainage;  and  (ii)  reduction  in  the  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases  such  as  diarrhea  and \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15\n\n \n\nhepatitis A, below 2003 levels in Changchun, Liaoyuan, and Meihekou (to be monitored through \nthe project performance management system). The Project will result in improved management \nand utilization of water resources in the upper SRB by (i) achieving the goal of 70% wastewater \ntreatment rate in Changchun by 2010; (ii) solving the water shortage problem through effluent \nreuse, which can be used beneficially for industry or irrigation; (iii) increasing flood control; (iv) \nproviding  a  supply  of  reliable  and  high-quality  potable  water;  (v)  increasing  the  efficiency  and \nmanagement  capacity  of  the  IAs;  and  (vi)  improving  cost  recovery  through  a  better  tariff \nstructure, with gradual increases to achieve full cost recovery. The water quality improvements \nin the SRB will also contribute to integrated water resource management and pollution control; \nthe basinwide management program; and transboundary pollution prevention and control. \n \n45. \nThe  Project  will  secure the  provision  of  clean  and  reliable water  supply  to  Changchun, \nLiaoyuan  and  Meihekou,  by  developing  drinking  water  sources  from  rivers  and  existing \nreservoirs,  instead  of  relying  solely  on  groundwater  that  is  overexploited  and  has  reached \nunsustainable  levels.  The  proposed  extension,  replacement,  and  rehabilitation  of  water \ndistribution  systems  will  increase  the  proportion  of  the  population  with  access  to  piped  water \nsupplies.  These  improvements  in  the  distribution  system  will  reduce  water  losses  and  reduce \nthe risk of contamination of treated water within the distribution system. Recycling wastewater \nwill  reduce  water  pollution  and  address  the  water  shortage  problem.  The  Project  will  improve \nflood  control  by  improving  the  drainage  systems,  separating  the  storm-water  drains  and \nsewerage  networks,  and  strengthening  the  dam  and  spillway  of  the  existing  Sanjia  reservoir. \nThis  will  minimize  loss  of  life  and  damage  to  property,  agriculture,  and  infrastructure.  The \nextraction of groundwater will be reduced to sustainable levels, thus reducing land subsidence.  \nThe reliable supply of water will reduce the burden on women responsible for domestic duties \nand caring for the sick.  \n \nB. \n \n\nSocial Dimensions \n\n1. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n \n46. \nImpacts  related  to  resettlement  (physical  and  economic  displacement)  include  people \naffected by (i) permanent acquisition of land for the WWTP and pumping stations, (ii) temporary \nuse of land for installation of trunk sewers and water pipelines, and (iii) demolition of houses and \nshops.  Resettlement  requirements  have  been  carefully  considered  and  incorporated  into  the \nproject design. All project components were planned to minimize disruption of residential areas \nand villages, and maintain village cohesion. The Project will require the permanent acquisition of \n78  hectares  (ha)  of  land,  temporary  acquisition  of  202  ha,  and  dismantling  of  62,700  m2  of \nresidential  houses  and  2,077  m2  of  commercial  buildings.  In  total,  244  households  with  911 \npeople will be permanently affected by land acquisition, and 502 households with 1,799 people \nby  the  dismantling  of  houses.  In  addition,  two  enterprises  and  18  shops  will  be  affected.  The \ncompensation of the permanent land loss is based on PRC Land Administration Law (1998) and \nthe  State  Council  Decision  to  Deepen  Reform  and  Strictly  Enforce  Land  Administration  (28 \nNovember 2004). \n \n47.  The  total  cost  for  both  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  estimated  to  be  CNY179.43 \nmillion or $21.62 million. Resettlement impacts were identified and six resettlement plans (RPs) \nprepared in accordance with PRC laws and ADB policy on involuntary resettlement.24 The RPs \nprovide a socioeconomic profile of those affected and the scope of the impacts; and addresses \nissues  related  to  entitlements  for  compensation,  legal  framework,  public  consultations, \n\n                                                 \n24  ADB. 1998. The Bank\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\ngrievance  procedures,  rehabilitation  measures,  budget,  and  monitoring  and  implementation \nmilestones.  \n \n48. \nJPG, CMG, LMG, MMG, and the IAs implemented the ADB full disclosure policy for the \nresettlement activities, including (i) disclosure of the summary resettlement plan attached to the \nsummary  environmental  impact  assessment  (SEIA)  circulated  to  the  Board  on  28  December \n2004; (ii) distribution of the Resettlement Information Booklet to affected households and village \noffices  between  August 2004  and January  2005;  and,  (iii) posting  of  the  RPs  in  village  offices \nand  resident  committees  in  January  2005,  and  on  the  ADB  website  in  May  2005.25  The  PMO \nhas established subproject resettlement units for supervision and monitoring in April 2005. \n \n49. \nAll those affected will be compensated and resettled in a timely and adequate manner in \naccordance  with  the  RPs  so  that  they  will  be  at  least  as  well  off  as  they  would  have  been \nwithout the Project. To ensure that they have been adequately compensated and rehabilitated, \nJPG  and  the  IAs  will  (i)  keep  ADB  informed  of  RP  implementation  through  quarterly  progress \nreports  until  resettlement  is  complete,  and  (ii)  prepare  resettlement  completion  reports  and  a \npost-resettlement impact evaluation report and submit it to ADB. JPG and the IAs will engage \nan independent agency for semiannual monitoring and annual evaluation of land acquisition and \nresettlement  until  2  years  after  the  completion  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The \nsummary RP is provided in Appendix 10. \n \n\n2. \n\nPoverty Reduction and Social Benefits \n\n \n50. \nThe  Project  will  benefit  about  3  million  urban  people  in  Changchun,  Liaoyuan,  and \nMeihekou,  through  the  provision  of  clean  water,  expansion  of  wastewater  capacity,  and \nincreased  flood  protection.  Of  the  total  beneficiary  population,  about  210,000  or  7.0%  are \nclassified as poor measured by the weighted average local urban poverty line of CNY1,875 per \nyear.  The  Project  will  support  poverty  reduction  by  (i)  providing  safer  and  more  reliable  urban \nwater  supplies;  (ii)  improving  the  natural  environment  by  increased  wastewater  treatment;  (iii) \nreducing  morbidity  due  to  decreased  exposure  to  waterborne  diseases  such  as  diarrhea  and \nhepatitis  A; (iv)  reducing  risk  of  frequent  local flooding by  improving  collection  and disposal  of \nwastewater  and  storm  water;  (v)  reducing  the  risk  of  major  flooding  through  river  training  and \nreservoir rehabilitation works; and (vi) providing employment opportunities for the poor.  \n \n51. \nThe  Project  will  improve  public  health  by  reducing  waterborne  diseases  through \nimproved  water  supply,  expanded  wastewater  capacity,  and  increased  flood  protection.  An \norder  of  magnitude  analysis  of  the  impact  on  morbidity  and  mortality  was  completed  for  the \nProject (Supplementary Appendix H). The Project is expected to reduce disease episodes by an \naverage of 8,000 cases per year. One in 20 of these cases, or 400 cases, is likely to be serious \nenough  to  result  in  a  medical consultation.  Provision  of clean  water  will  improve  the  quality  of \nlife of the poor and vulnerable by reducing the proportion of household income spent on medical \ntreatment  for  waterborne  diseases.  The  number  of  school  days  and  workdays  lost  due  to \nsickness  will  also  be  reduced.  Further,  the  Project  will  reduce  the  proportion  of  household \nincome spent on buying water from private sources and buying storage containers, filters, and \nother water-cleaning equipment. Water pressure improvements will greatly enhance the quality \nof life of households living in apartments and reduce their water-pumping costs. Improved water \nsupply will significantly reduce the time, cost, and labor that mainly women spend on collecting \nwater, cleaning containers, and improving water quality. The increased flood control will reduce \nthe risk of infection from overflowing sewers during the flooding season.  \n\n                                                 \n25 All RPs were uploaded on the ADB website on 22 May 2005. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17\n\n \n\nFinancial Aspects \n\n \n52. \nThe Project will create 3,200 full-time jobs during the 5 years of construction. The poor \nand  women  will  fill  about  one  half  of  these  jobs.  Project  operations  will  create  567  full-time \npermanent  jobs;  many  will  be  available  to  unemployed  persons  with  basic  technical  training. \nProject-related  services,  such  as  procurement  of  construction  materials  and  equipment,  and \nfollow-on  multiplier  effects  will create  an  additional  5,000  jobs.  Those temporarily  employed  in \nconstruction operations will benefit from additional training and experience that will provide them \nwith opportunities in planned infrastructure construction.  \nIn the project area, the major social measures to protect urban residents from falling into \n53. \npoverty include (i) living allowance for laid-off employees, (ii) unemployment insurance, and (iii) \nsocial  support  program  under  the  minimum  living  standard  scheme.  Further,  CMG,  LMG,  and \nMMG  have  agreed  to  implement  poverty  reduction26  measures  including  (i)  lifeline  tariffs,  (ii) \nwater bill discounts or cash rebates amounting to 50% of the monthly water bill for households \nliving  below  the  poverty  line;  and  (iii)  connections  for  the  poorest  households  to  tap  water  in \nLiaoyuan,  Meihekou,  and  Shuangyang  district  in  Changchun.  The  Project  will  promote  public \nawareness  and  education  programs  about  project  benefits,  public  hygiene,  and  consumer \nbehavior on water saving and managing wastewater disposal. The summary poverty reduction \nand social strategy is in Appendix 11. \n \nC. \n \n54. \nThe financial evaluation of the Project was undertaken in real terms using constant 2004 \nprices. The project cost estimates and financial projections in nominal terms were converted to \nreal terms by adjusting for the projected effects of foreign and domestic inflation and currency \nfluctuation.  Incremental  benefits  and  costs  were  derived  by  evaluating  the  financial position  of \nthe  IAs  under  with-  and  without-project  scenarios.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  for  the \nProject  was  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis  of  6.2%,  which  compares  favorably  with  the \nweighted average cost of capital in real terms of 1.9%. The financial analysis is in Appendix 12.  \n \n55.  The sensitivity analysis includes examination of the risk that project costs will increase by \n10%,  or  that  revenues  will  be  depressed  by  a  1-year  delay  in  tariff  adjustments;  the  resulting \nfinancial  internal  rates  of  return  are  5.3%  and  5.5%,  respectively.  Detailed  verification  of  the \nlocal financing plan indicate that the equity contributions from CMG, LMG, and MMG are about \n1%, 1.3%, and 1.5% of annual revenues respectively, indicating minimal risk. CMG, LMG, and \nMMG  have  sufficient  financial  resources  to  take  on  responsibility  for  guaranteeing  the  loan \nrepayments, and have provided assurances that they accept this risk. An affordability analysis \nhas  been  undertaken,  based  on  proposed  tariffs  and  household  income  data  from  the  social \nsurvey. Tariffs under the Project are considered affordable if the combined average water and \nwastewater charges are less than 5% of household income. The estimated tariffs on this basis \nare  affordable  to  the  average  household  (2.0%  of  income),  and  also  affordable  to  the  poorest \n10%  of  households  (less  than  3.4%  of  income  before  accounting  for  poverty  reduction \nmeasures that exist now or that have been committed to).  \n \n56. \nThe  IAs  have  agreed  to  minimum  levels  of  financial  performance,  and  these  will  be \nincluded as loan covenants covering capital structure (debt to equity), debt service cover, and \nliquidity.  Financial  projections  estimate  the  tariffs  required  for  an  appropriate  level  of  financial \n\n                                                 \n26 The TA study (i) defined poverty levels used in the analysis, (ii) assessed and provided an income and expenditure \nprofile  of  poor  households  based  on  a  household  survey  of  1,200  households,  (iii)  evaluated  and  recommended \nmeasures  to  alleviate  the  impacts  of  increased  water  and  wastewater  tariffs  on  the  poor,  and  (iv)  assessed  the \npositive impacts of the Project on the poor and low-income beneficiaries.  \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\nEconomic Aspects \n\nperformance.  Periodic  tariff  reviews  will  be  required  to  overcome  the  risk  of  poor  financial \nperformance or of unexpected changes in the tariff income.  \n \n57. \nThe  financial  sustainability  of  the  Project  was  verified  through  the  financial  analysis  of \nthe IAs and secured through the signed water purchase agreements (WPAs) in Meihekou and \nShuangyang for the water supply components. The financial projections for the IAs indicate that \nthe minimum debt-service coverage ratios and acceptable rates of return on equity will generally \nbe achieved by the Project. To ensure that the Project does not have an adverse fiscal impact \non  any  level  of  government,  wholesale  and  retail  tariffs  were  structured  on  the  basis  of \nachieving full cost recovery.  \n \nD. \n \n58. \nThe  Project  is  an  integral  part  of  the  ongoing  provincial,  municipal,  and  basinwide \nenvironmental programs directly contributing to the cleanup of the SRB. The economic analysis \nwas  conducted  over  25  years,  inclusive  of  project  construction,  in  accordance  with  ADB \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Project benefits and costs were estimated on \na  without-  and  with-project  basis  appropriately  apportioned  on  the  basis  of  being  tradable  or \nnontradable,  and  with  appropriate  adjustments  to  the  nonincremental  and  incremental  project \nbenefits. Incremental benefits were valued on the basis of willingness to pay and, in the case of \nflood  prevention,  avoided  damages.  The  willingness  to  pay  and  demand  analysis  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix I.  \n \n59. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  (i)  Changchun  wastewater  component  is \n16.6%; (ii) Shuangyang water supply component, 32.2%; (iii) Liaoyuan water supply component, \n30.0%; (iv) Meihekou water supply component, 20.9%; (v) Yongchun River component, 25.6%; \nand  (vi)  Liaoyuan  drainage  component,  32.2%.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  for  the \nwhole  Project  is  estimated  at  21.1%,  which  exceeds  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital, \nassumed to be no less than 12% (Appendix 13). The detailed economic and least-cost analysis \nis in Supplementary Appendix J.  \n  \nE. \n \n60. \n The  Jilin  Environmental  Protection  Bureau  has  already  approved  the  environmental \nimpact  assessment  reports  for  all  project  components.  The  SEIA  along  with  the  summary  RP \nwas circulated to the ADB Board on 28 December 2004 and posted on the ADB website on 29 \nDecember  2004.  The  Project  will  improve  the  urban  environment  and  surface  water  quality, \nprimarily  in  the  Yitong  and  Yongchun  rivers,  which  flow  into  the  SRB.  The  Project  will  target \nsubstantial  improvements  in  wastewater  management  in  Changchun  and  Liaoyuan,  which  will \nhave significant positive effects on water pollution control in the upper reaches of the SRB. The \nProject  will  provide  clean  and  reliable  water  supply  to  Liaoyuan,  Meihekou,  and  Shuangyang \ndistrict in Changchun, secured from rivers and existing reservoirs instead of from overexploited \ngroundwater.  The  Project  will  have  an  overwhelming  positive  environmental  impact  and  any \nenvironmental  risks  during  construction  will  be  mitigated  through  measures  in  the  SEIA.  The \nSEIA summarizes the environmental impacts, mitigation measures, and monitoring plans. About \n100  million  m3  annually  of  untreated  wastewater  will  be  treated  under  the  Project.  The \nenvironmental  management  plan,  prepared  as  part  of  the  SEIA,  will  guide  environmental \nmitigation  and  monitoring  under  the  Project.  Extensive  public  consultations  were  undertaken \ntwice during TA implementation involving 35\u201340 stakeholders. \n \n\nEnvironmental Aspects \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19\n\n \n\nimplementation, \n\nthe  manufacturer.  During  project \n\nProject Risks and Mitigation Measures \n\nF. \n \nThe  Project  does  not  have  any  unusual  technical  risks.  The  water  supply  and \n61. \nwastewater  subprojects  have  adopted  conventional  engineering  design  and \ntreatment \nprocesses that are robust and with proven records of reliable performance. The ICB equipment \nprocurement packages will include technical support for installation, testing, and commissioning \nas  recommended  by \ninternationally \nexperienced  consultants  will  provide  support  to  the  PMOs,  PIUs,  and  IAs  to  ensure  the \ndelivered  equipment  and  works  comply  with  the  design  requirements  and  quality  standards. \nBased  on  the  performance  of  ADB\u2019s  PRC  portfolio,  cost  overruns  and  major  implementation \ndelays are not expected.  \n \nPotential  risks  in  developing  a  strong  water  supply  and  wastewater  utility  include:  (i) \n62. \nfuture  constraints  on  institutional  reforms;  and  (ii)  lack  of  adequate  public  support  to  increase \nwater  supply  tariffs  and  wastewater  charges  to  meet  cost  recovery  targets.  These  risks  have \nbeen mitigated by: (i) assurances from CMG, LMG and MMG on the financial and managerial \nautonomy  of  the  IAs;  (ii)  local  programs  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  tariff  increases  on  poor \nhouseholds; and (iii) the diversity and frequency of public participation conducted to date, which \nthe  IAs  are  committed  to  continue,  in  combination  with  regular  tariff  reviews  and  oversight  of \nlocal  price  bureaus.  Potential  financial  and  commercial  risks  related  to  the  project  include  (i) \nfailure  to  meet  the  cash/equity  transfers  required  to  construct  the  Project;  (ii)  failure  of  the \nShuangyang Tap Water Company and Meihekou Reservoir Management Bureau to honor the \nWPA; (iii) constraints on institutional reform of water supply and drainage companies; and (iv) \nfailure by the IAs to increase the tariffs to meet cost recovery targets. The potential financial and \npolicy risks will be mitigated by assurances related to the financial and managerial autonomy for \nwater  supply  and  drainage  companies.    The  risks  associated  with  lack  of  local  funding  will  be \naddressed by the assurance from CMG, LMG, and MMG that they (i) would meet whatever cost \nincreases are incurred, and (ii) provide a guarantee on the required equity injections to meet the \nfinancing requirements and financial ratios of the project. \n \n\n \n63. \nIAs have given the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government,  JPG,  CMG,  LMG,  MMG,  and \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nJPG,  the  Executing  Agency,  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  the  Project.

Wastewater  management  practice  was  based  on  septic  tanks, \ndesignated  open  drainage  ditches,  and  no  treatment.  Services  were  funded  through  tax \nrevenue,  with  minimum  or  no  charges  levied  on  consumers.  With  rapid  economic  growth  and \nurban expansion, the Government recognized the need for environmental protection measures \nto be implemented alongside economic growth policies to meet its vision of clean, modern, and \nenvironmentally  sustainable  cities  that  would  be  competitive  in  the  global  market  place.  As  a \nresult,  the  Government  made  a  fundamental  shift  to  a  market-based  approach  and  enterprise \nprovision  in  the  delivery  of  infrastructure  services  and  an  integrated  approach  to  urban \nmanagement. \n \n2. \nThe Water Pollution and Prevention Law (1996) authorizes the setting of standards for \nambient  surface  water  quality1  and  uses  these  standards  to  set  targets  for  individual \nwatercourses. The State Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) defines the technical national \nstandards, including standards that apply to sections of rivers or other watercourses of strategic \nsignificance.  For  other  rivers  and  watercourses, \nthe  relevant  municipal  or  provincial \nenvironmental protection department sets the targeted water quality class. \n \n3. \nThe  water  sector  continues  to  be  a  priority  sector  in  the  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan.  The \nGovernment\u2019s strategy focuses on (i) developing water sources; (ii) protecting existing sources \nby  controlling  industrial  and  residential  pollution  in  rivers,  lakes,  and  reservoirs;  (iii)  controlling \noverextraction  from  groundwater  resources;  and  (iv)  improving  demand  management  by \nintroducing technologies that enhance the efficiency of water operations, and using appropriate \npricing mechanisms. Guidelines for urban water supply emphasize (i) proper planning and the \ninclusion of water supply projects in national, provincial, and municipal economic development \nplans;  (ii)  mobilizing  financial  resources  from  users  and  from  various  Government  sources  for \nthe  construction  of  new  facilities;  (iii)  full  cost  recovery  from  industrial  and  commercial  users, \nand recovery of operation and maintenance costs from residential users; (iv) use of loans and \ncredit to finance urban water supply; and (v) application of new technology where appropriate. \nThe  Government  is  increasingly  concerned  about  the  need  for  policy  reform  and  capacity \nbuilding to improve water resource management, and to introduce cost-recovery techniques and \ncapability  to  enable  water  delivery  programs  to  be  financially  self-sustaining. Also,  because  of \nthe severity of urban environmental problems, the Government has made cities the focal point \nof its environment protection efforts.  \n \n4. \nThe  Government\u2019s  successive  5-year  plans  have  set  targets  and  requirements  for \nachieving  the  designated  water  quality  classes.  Provincial  and  municipal  governments  are \ncalled upon to draw up specific plans to address wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal. \nRegulations are provided for effluent standards for industries prior to discharge to a municipal \nsewer.  Industries  are  required  to  provide  adequate  wastewater  treatment  to  meet  specific \nregulatory pollution limits. For municipal wastewater, the level of treatment is determined by the \nwater  quality  class  of  the  receiving  water  and  specific  target  treatment  rates.  A  target  in  the \n\n                                                 \n1   The Environmental Quality Standards have five classes for surface water quality based on their use. Class I is for \nwater resources and nationally protected bodies of water. Class II is for high-value fish production areas. Class III \nis for potable water resources. Class IV is for industrial water sources. Class I water sources are the best in quality \nand class V are the worst.  \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\ntreatment, \n\nin  on-site  wastewater \n\nWastewater Management  \n\nincluding  some  supported  by \n\nTenth  Five-Year  Plan  was  a  wastewater  treatment  rate  of  45%  for  regional  and  higher  level \ncities, and rates of 60% for cities discharging more than 500,000 cubic meters (m3)/day by 2005. \nThe  Ministry  of  Construction  has  set  more  stringent  targets  for  larger  cities  (e.g.,  major  cities; \nprovincial capitals) to have a 70% treatment rate by 2010.2 Several other policies, regulations, \nand  plans  support  the  framework  for  water  quality  management.  Building  regulations  from  the \nMinistry of Construction (dating back to the 1980s) require the construction of septic tanks for all \nnew residential and other nonindustrial developments. New developments are excused from this \nrequirement if the discharge is to a municipal sewer connected to a wastewater treatment plant \n(WWTP). The Tenth Five-Year Plan also requires substantial progress in establishing systems \nof  discharge  permits,  installing  continuous  monitoring  for  larger  industrial  discharges,  and \nsetting discharge limits based on total pollution loads. \n \nB. \n \n5. \nProgress  in  environmental  management  was  made  during  the  Ninth  Five-Year  Plan \n(1995\u20132000). By 1999 the total discharge volume of major pollutants, including chemical oxygen \ndemand and petroleum-related products, declined by 15\u201325% compared with 1995 levels. Much \nof the progress was made in industrial pollution in line with Government policy to target major \npoint  source  polluters  first.  Many  polluting  industries  were  closed  down  and  others  undertook \ninvestment \nthe  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). Investment also took place in municipal treatment plants. By 2002, \nabout 537 municipal WWTPs were treating approximately 35.8 million m3/day. \n \nIn 2003, wastewater generated was 46 billion m3/year. Growth in domestic3 wastewater \n6. \ngeneration  (about  65%  of  the  total)  is  outweighing  the  reductions  achieved  in  industrial \nwastewater  (about  35%).  Currently  about  40%  of  the  total  wastewater  generated  is  treated, \nleaving  an  annual  volume  of  over  20  billion  m3  of  untreated  wastewater.  In  the  absence  of  a \nmunicipal  WWTP,  a  mixture  of  raw  domestic  wastewater  and  partially  treated  industrial \nwastewater is discharged from the municipal sewer into the nearest body of water. Designated \nopen  wastewater  ditches  are  still  common  in  many  cities.  Municipal  wastewater  is  a  major \ncontributor  to  the  pollution  of  rivers  and  lakes,  with  the  most  severe  pollution  impacts  in  the \nwater-short northern region of the country. \n \n7. \nIn regional and higher level cities, only 30% of rivers meet their designated water quality \nstandards  compared  with  the  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan  objective  of  60%.  In  seven  major  river \nbasins,4 52% of rivers do not meet the class III standard required for sources of potable water. \nMore  than  half  the  rivers  in  urban  areas  are  the  lowest  quality\u2014class  V  or  below.  About  16% \nare at the lowest class V standard, and 36% are worse than class V standard. Eutrophication is \noccurring in three quarters of major fresh water lakes. Surface water sources serving municipal \nwater  supply  systems  are  polluted  to  levels  unacceptable  under  water  quality  standards.  The \nwater  quality  in  groundwater  aquifers  is  deteriorating.  Much  more  investment  in  collection \nsystems and municipal WWTPs is needed. WWTPs are the key to water pollution control, since \nindustrial treatment plants typically provide only pretreatment to a low effluent standard, prior to \ndischarge  to  a  municipal  sewer.  Social  surveys  demonstrate  that  the  urban  population  is \nimpact  of  wastewater  pollution.  Although \nthe \nbecoming \nwastewater companies have been established in many cities, few are financially or managerially \nautonomous/ and tariff increases have been slow to be implemented. \n\nincreasingly  concerned  about \n\n                                                 \n2   Ministry of Construction. 2000.

Three  tributaries  of \nSonghua River: Yongchun, Xinkai, and Yitong, pass through Changchun. The Yongchun River \nflows into the Xinkai River, which flows into the Yitong River, which flows into the SRB.  \n \nD. \n \nSRB water quality is managed through legally established targets for water quality: five \n10. \nclasses plus a residual class for water bodies with quality below the lowest class. Yitong River \nreceives  Changchun\u2019s  domestic  and  industrial  wastewater.  The  water  quality  of  the  section  of \nYitong  River  downstream  of  Changchun  has  been  characterized  as  class  V,  based  on  water \nquality  monitoring  data  for  this  Project.  Major  pollutants  are  chemical  oxygen  demand  (COD), \nbiochemical oxygen demand (BOD), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), and petroleum hydrocarbon. \n \nCurrently,  about  677,300  m3/day  of  wastewater  is  collected  in  the  five  urban  built-up \n11. \ndistrict areas of Changchun. The total capacity of the existing municipal wastewater treatment \nplants is 540,000 m3/day; however, one (Beijiao treatment plant of capacity 390,000 m3/day) is a \nprimary treatment plant, and the treated wastewater does not meet secondary effluent standard. \nThe actual secondary wastewater treatment rate in Changchun is estimated to be 22.15%, while \nthe remaining untreated wastewater is discharged into rivers causing major pollution. \n \nE. \n \nThe  institutional  framework  for  managing  surface  water  quality  in  the  SRB  includes  (i) \n12. \nlegal standards and targets for surface water quality; and (ii) policies, regulations, and plans to \nmeet  the  targets.  The  1996  Water  Pollution  and  Prevention  Law  authorized  setting  national \nstandards  for  surface  water  quality,  and  using  these  standards  to  set  targets  for  individual \nwatercourses. The law empowers SEPA to define national technical standards. \n \n13. \nThe  standards  of  surface  water  quality  are  set  according  to  the  intended  use  of  the \nwater. Classes I, II, and III apply to surface water for drinking. Classes IV and V are for surface \nwater for irrigation or industry. Each class is defined by 30 criteria, prescribing numeric ranges \nfor  the  physical,  chemical,  and  biological  properties  of  water  (such  as  temperature,  pH,  and \ncoliform  counts).  Once  SEPA  defined  the  water  quality  classes,  desired  or  targeted  ambient \nwater  quality  was  determined  for  each  river  reach.  SEPA  set  the  desired  or  targeted  ambient \nwater  quality  for  some  strategic  river  reaches  but,  more  generally,  either  the  municipal  or \nprovincial environmental protection department set the targeted water quality class.  \n \n14. \nTo  help  address  pollution  of  the  SRB,  ADB  provided  the  SRB  Water  Quality  and \nPollution Control Management technical assistance. A key objective is to help develop an SRB \npollution  control  plan  that  includes  a  list  of  prioritized  wastewater  and  sewerage  development \nprojects that would contribute to pollution control in the SRB.  \n \n \n \n\nInstitutional Framework: Laws, Policies, and Government Agencies \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nNeed for the Project \n\nEvaluation of Current Framework and Needed Reforms \n\nF. \n \n15. \nThe  PRC\u2019s  approach  to  managing  water  quality,  based  on  targets  for  ambient  water \nquality, is an approach used widely and effectively around the world. Like other comprehensive \napproaches  to  managing  water  quality,  ambient  standards  require  advanced  scientific, \nengineering,  and  administrative  expertise.  The  SRB  pollution  control  plan  is  to  be  developed \nunder the ongoing Songhua Pollution Control technical assistance.  \n \nG. \n \n16. \nThe  Project  will  reduce  transboundary  pollution  by  reducing  pollutant  input  into  the \ntributaries  of  the  Songhua  River.  Upon  project  implementation,  the  following  quantities  of \npollutants are expected to be removed from the SRB: 15,549 tons biochemical oxygen demand; \n27,631  tons  chemical  oxygen  demand;  17,885  tons  suspended  solids;  1,570  tons  ammonia \nnitrogen, and 268 tons total phosphorous.  \n \nH. \n \n17. \nThe ADB agenda for policy dialogue in the water and wastewater sector covers (i) SRB \nmanagement,  (ii)  reduction  of  transjurisdiction  pollution,  (iii)  regulatory  enforcement  and \n(v)  water \nmonitoring \nconservation,  (vi)  cost  recovery  and  tariff  reform,  (vii)  corporate  governance  and  enterprise \nreform, and (viii) adoption of water purchase agreements. \n \n\nfor  environmental  management, \n\n(iv)  wastewater  management, \n\nPolicy Dialogue  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \nA. \n\nPOLICY DIALOGUE \n\nRiver Basin Management \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n29 \n\nThe Songhua River Basin (SRB) is the third largest river basin in the People\u2019s Republic \n1. \nof  China  (PRC)  after  those  of  the  Changjiang  and  Yellow  rivers.  Located  in  Jilin  and \nHeilongjiang provinces and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the SRB has a catchment area \nof  557,000  square  kilometers  with  a  population  of  62  million.  The  Songhua  River,  one  of  the \nmost  polluted  of  the  47  major  rivers  in  the  PRC,  is  contaminated  with  a  number  of  organic \nchemicals, heavy metals, and conventional pollutants. Water pollution has been identified as a \nmajor  constraint  to  sustainable  development  of  the  PRC  economy.  An  ongoing  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  cluster  technical  assistance  (TA)1  is  helping  the  Government \noperationalize  transjurisdictional  provisions  of  the  Water  Pollution  Prevention  and  Control  Act. \nTo  help  address  SRB  pollution,  ADB  provided  the  SRB  Water  Quality  and  Pollution  Control \nManagement TA2 to strengthen the capacity for water quality and pollution control management, \nand help develop an SRB pollution control plan. The TA will (i) address the technical knowledge \ngaps, (ii) strengthen the capacity of the Water Resources Protection Bureau and the central and \nlocal stakeholders in identifying basinwide lines of institutional responsibility for policy analysis \nand  pollution  control  management,  and  (iii)  help  the  Government  develop  a  long-term  plan  to \n2010.  The  TA  consultants  were  fielded  on  27  June  2004  and  will  complete  the  assignment  in \nJune  2005.  The  TA  will  (i)  provide  inputs  on  policies  and  strategic  points  related  to  pollution \ncontrol in the SRB to the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, which is currently under preparation; and (ii) \nrecommend a list of prioritized wastewater and sewerage development projects to contribute to \npollution  control  in  the  SRB  for  inclusion  in  the  ADB  lending  program.  The  Jilin  provincial \ngovernment (JPG), Changchun municipal government (CMG), Liaoyuan municipal government \n(LMG), and Meihekou municipal government (MMG) have worked closely with the TA to identify \na prioritized list of wastewater and sewerage treatment projects in Jilin for possible future ADB \nfunding  that  would  all  contribute  to  SRB  cleanup.  The  proposed  Jilin  Water  Supply  and \nSewerage  Development  Project  would  be  the  first  major  ADB  investment  project  to  directly \ncontribute  to  pollution  control  in  the  upper  reaches  of  the  SRB.  The  annual  wastewater  to  be \ntreated will be about 100 million tons. Key annual wastewater load reduction that will impact the \nSRB include 15,549 tons biochemical oxygen demand; 27,631 tons chemical oxygen demand; \n17,885 tons suspended solids; 1,570 tons ammonia nitrogen, and 268 tons total phosphorous. \n \n2. \nADB  policy  dialogue  has  stressed  the  need  to  strengthen  Songliao  Water  Resources \nCommission  to  give  it  greater  authority  for  comprehensive  flood  management.3  A  new  law  on \nmanagement of water resources adopted in 20024 formally introduces the concept of river basin \nmanagement.  The  State  Environment  Protection  Bureau  (SEPA)  is  taking  the  lead  role  in \ncoordinating  issues  of  SRB  pollution  and  has  developed  a  5-year  Songhua  pollution  control \nplan\u2014the  first  of  the  concrete  steps  needed  to  return  the  Songhua  River  to  minimum  water \nquality levels. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2000.

Manila. \n\n4  The  Law  on  the  Management  of  Water  Resources  was  approved  by  the  Standing  Committee  of  the  National \n\nPeople\u2019s Congress on 29 August 2002 and became effective 1 October 2002. \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nB. \n\nTransjurisdiction Pollution \n\n3. \nThe  ADB  $2.1  million  cluster  TA  to  help  the  Government  strengthen  transjurisdiction \nenvironment  management  (footnote  1)  has  four  components:  (i)  legislation  to  support \ntransjurisdiction  water  pollution  prevention  and  control,  (ii)  procedures  and  methodologies  for \ntransjurisdiction  water  quality  management,  (iii)  capacity  building,  and  (iv)  dissemination  of \nfindings  and  recommendations  for  potential  application  in  river  basins.    A  major  output  of  the \nfirst  component  was  model  river  basin  legislation  developed  for  the  Fen  River  in  Shanxi \nProvince, a major tributary of the Yellow River.  \n \n4. \nNonpoint  Pollution.  Over  the  past  2  decades,  the  PRC  has  made  progress  in \ncontrolling and preventing point source pollution, especially in reducing industrial pollution. With \nthis  progress,  management  of  nonpoint  source  pollution  (NSP)  is  becoming  increasingly \nsignificant for improving PRC water quality. Policies that have traditionally focused on industrial \npoint  source  pollution  control  need  to  be  complemented  by  measures  to  address  NSP, \nespecially  in  view  of  the  known  significant  impacts  of  nonpoint  sources.  Against  this \nbackground,  ADB  has  provided  TA  to  study  the  control  and  management  of  rural  NSP.  The \nmain objectives of the TA are to (i) help prepare national policies, plans, and programs for the \ncontrol and prevention of rural NSP, based on better understandings of the status and trends of \nthe  problem;  and  (ii)  strengthen  national  and  local  institutional  capacity  for  control  and \nmanagement  of  rural  NSP.  The  TA  is  ongoing.  Major  outputs  to  date  include  (i)  an  analytical \nreport  on  the  main  problems  and  underlying  causes  of  rural  NSP  (under  preparation);  (ii)  a \nreport  on  international  experience  with  rural  NSP  control  and  implications  for  PRC  policies, \nplans,  and  programs;  and  (iii)  a  medium-term  national  action  plan  for  the  control  and \nmanagement of rural NSP, with a focus on pollution generated from livestock production (under \npreparation). JPG, CMG, and LMG have agreed to prepare comprehensive policies, plans, and \nprograms for the control and prevention of NSP by December 2006.  \n \nC. \n\nRegulatory Enforcement and Monitoring for Environmental Management \n\n5. \nTo build the necessary capacity for sound environmental management and to strengthen \nthe legal framework, ADB helped train staff of the Environment Protection Commission, and is \nhelping  draft  and  revise  some  PRC  environmental  laws.5  ADB  is  helping  to  promote  a  more \neffective legal/regulatory framework for environmental protection in light of the PRC\u2019s transition \nto a market economy and its adherence to international environmental protection agreements. \nADB helped to upgrade the knowledge and skills of provincial legislative drafters in the review, \namendment, and formulation of local legislation related to the protection and conservation of the \nenvironment  and  natural  resources.6  In  addition,  ADB  provided  assistance  in  environmental \nmanagement  by  improving  the  institutional  capacity  of  SEPA,  and  the  local  and  provincial \nenvironmental  protection  bureaus,  to  strengthen  environmental  standards  and  to  enforce \nenvironmental  laws  and  policies.7  JPG,  CMG,  LMG,  and  MMG  have  acknowledged  their \nresponsibilities to ensure that the commitments given in the environmental impact assessment \ndocumentation  are  adhered  to  during  project  implementation.  This  responsibility  will  be \ndischarged  by  the  implementing  agencies  (IAs)  in  conjunction  with  relevant  departments  of \nCMG,  LMG,  and  MMG;  a  specific  staff  member  will  be  designated  to  undertake  a  monitoring \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB. 1996.

Establishment  of  appropriate  monitoring  procedures  is  included  in  the \nconsulting services contract for project implementation. \n\n \nWastewater Management \n\nD. \n\n6. \nThe  focus  of  the  policy  dialogue  on  wastewater  management  is  the  integrated \nmanagement  of  industrial  and  domestic  wastewater  including  on-site  treatment  and  public \nsewer connections. ADB has supported the Government's policies for wastewater management \nby  providing  a  number  of  related  environmental  loans  that  include  wastewater  treatment \ncomponents  in  Beijing,  Chengde,  Chaohu,  Fuzhou,  Hefei,  Qingdao,  Shanghai,  Tangshan, \nTianjin, and Wuhan; and along the Hai River system. Wastewater treatment was also addressed \nunder  the  Urban  Environmental  Improvement  Planning  TA  that  strengthened  institutions \nresponsible  for  environmental  improvement  in  a  number  of  cities,  and  identified  future \ninfrastructure requirements.  \n \n7. \nCMG,  LMG,  and  MMG  recognize  that  provision  of  adequate  facilities  for  wastewater \ntreatment is essential for public health. This treatment must be undertaken incrementally and in \nphases because of the high cost involved. The success of wastewater management policy will \nimpact  on  the  sector  objective  of  pollution  reduction  and  also  on  the  cost-effectiveness  of \nwastewater  management  and  operations. The  incremental  wastewater  treatment  capacity  that \nwill be added will exceed the incremental water supply in the project area. \n \nE. \n\nCost Recovery and Tariff Reform \n\nin  September  1998.  Major \n\nThe  Project  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  ongoing  economic  and  enterprise  reform \n8. \nprograms  that  require  all  water  supply  and  wastewater  management  projects  to  be  financially \nsustainable  and  capable  of  cost  recovery.  Water  supply  companies  (WSCs)  are  required  to \nimprove  their  cost-recovery  capability.  Appropriate  mechanisms  for  tariff  setting  are  a  critical \nfactor  in  attracting  the  needed  investment  to  the  sector,  ending  WSC  reliance  on  government \nsubsidies and providing incentives to users to conserve water resources.  \n \n9. \nADB is actively encouraging this transition in its policy dialogue and lending operations. \nTwo ADB water tariff studies support the Government\u2019s initiatives. A major output of the first TA \nwas  the  National  Guidelines  on  Water  Tariffs  (NGWT),  subsequently  promulgated  by  the \nNational  Development  and  Reform  Commission  (NDRC)  and  the  Ministry  of  Construction \n(MOC) \nthat  reflect  specific  TA \nrecommendations include: (i) selecting a tariff structure based on local conditions and priorities, \n(ii) considering a two-part tariff with a volumetric charge and fixed demand charge, (iii) adopting \nfull  cost  recovery  as  the  main  objective  in  setting  and  approving  tariff  levels,  (iv)  use  of  the \npublic  hearings  mechanism  to  disseminate  tariff  increase  plans  to  the  public  and  obtain  their \nfeedback;  and  (v)  adopting  a  simplified  process  for  tariff  regulation,  requiring  evaluation  and \napproval  by  the  municipal  government  and  supported  by  provincial  and  national  review  and \nmonitoring. The NGWT improved the long-term financial viability of the WSCs, and provided for \noperation, maintenance,  and  service  expansion,  which  in turn  will  help  increase private  sector \nparticipation in the water sector.  \n \n10. \nThe  second  water  tariff  study  TA  focused  on  helping  the  Government  develop \ninstitutional and methodological capacities to implement the NGWT. The TA helped prepare the \ndraft  local  implementing  regulations  of  the  NGWT  for  Zhangjiakou,  Fuzhou,  and  Chengdu. \nEnactment  of  a  local  tariff  regulation  provides  a  legal  basis  for  regulating  water  tariffs  and \nensures  transparency  and  efficiency.  The  Zhangjiakou  Implementation  Regulations,  approved \n\nthe  NGWT \n\nfeatures \n\nin \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nby  the  Zhangjiakou  municipal  government  in  September  2000,  were  the  first  local  water  tariff \nregulation  under  the  NGWT.  The  Chengdu  Implementation  Regulations  were  issued  in  2002. \nPublic hearing meetings are a mandatory requirement of the NGWT. The TA advocated the use \nof  hearings  to  obtain  the  views  of  the  public  on  water  supply  and  to  promote  public \nunderstanding of WSCs, policies, and efforts to develop improved water supply services. Based \non  the  first  public  hearing  meeting,  Zhangjiakou  increased  its  water  tariffs  by  75%.  The  TA \nrecommendations, including the achievements in Zhangjiakou, have been acknowledged by the \nState Council as a good example  of tariff reform. NDRC issued a notice to local governments \nnationwide  indicating  that  the  Zhangjiakou  water  tariff  reforms  were  recognized  as  a  good \nexample for undertaking tariff reforms required by the NGWT. On 1 April 2002, upon completion \nof  the  study,  MOC,  Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of  Water  Resources,  NDRC,  and  SEPA \nofficially issued a notice on strengthening urban water tariff reforms; this was followed on 9 April \n2002  by  a  nationwide  video  conference  to  discuss  the  Zhangjiakou  experience  on  water  tariff \nreforms. Nationwide replication of the Zhangjiakou tariff reforms model is ongoing. Generation \nof funds for future expansion and rehabilitation of water supply and wastewater systems directly \nfrom  tariff  increases  is  gaining  momentum  and  having  a  positive  impact  on  the  financial \nsustainability of WSCs and wastewater utility agencies.  \n \n11. \nSpecific impacts of the overall package of reforms are best illustrated by the benefits in \nZhangjiakou.  The  benefits  include  (i)  the  Price  Bureau's  lead  role  in  tariff  administration  was \nclearly  established;  (ii)  the  water  supply  administration  of  the  Public  Utility  Bureau  was \nstreamlined;  (iii)  a  financial  plan  was  in  place  for  the  Zhangjiakou  Water  Supply  Company  to \nservice  the  debt  within  a  reasonable  time  frame,  while  recovering  other  costs  and  earning \nprofits;  (iv)  the  Zhangjiakou  municipal  government  has  funds  to  repay  international  and \ndomestic loans within 6 years and will have funds for future development; (v) the construction \ncommission, which is responsible for Zhangjiakou's new water treatment plant, has the funding \nrequired to finish its work; (vi) proposed tariffs are affordable for domestic customers, and poor \nhouseholds benefit from a new program to provide relief from cost of their water bills; (vii) public \nhearings  make  the  tariff  approval  process  transparent,  encourage  cost  control  and  service \nimprovements,  promote  understanding  of  the  importance  of  tariff  increases,  and  help  support \ntariff  adjustments;  (viii)  the  institutional  capacity  to  control  costs  and  tariff  increases  was \nstrengthened; and (ix) water conservation was improved by tariff increases and an appropriate \ntariff structure. Multiyear tariff adjustment proposals such as the one developed for Zhangjiakou \nwill result in other benefits. First, the underlying financial plan for the proposal provides the basis \nof  a  service  contract  between  the  municipality  and  the  WSC,  which  can  serve  as  a  tool  to \ncontrol  costs.  Second,  the  long-term  financial planning  provides  a  framework  to  attract  private \ninvestors. \n  \n12. \nJPG,  CMG,  LMG,  and  MMG  confirmed  that  they  were  implementing  the  NGWT.  CMG, \nLMG,  and  MMG  have  been  increasing  water  and  wastewater  tariffs  in  keeping  with  the  state \ngovernment  policies  to  promote  better  cost  recovery.  Between  1999  and  2004,  aggregate \ndomestic  tariffs  (water  plus  wastewater)  have  increased  by  194%  in  Changchun,8  150%  in \nLiaoyuan, and 70% in Meihekou. Corresponding increases in industrial tariffs have been 66%, \n50%, and 15%. A water supply and wastewater tariff increase policy will be issued by December \n2005 for 2006\u20132009. \n \n\n                                                 \n8 Changchun tariffs apply in Shuangyang. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n33 \n\nADB\u2019s wastewater tariff study TA9 implemented between 2002 and 2003 also contributed \n13. \nto  the  Government\u2019s  initiative  on  wastewater  tariff  reform.  The  major  output  of  the  TA  was  a \ndetailed  draft  national  guidelines  for  urban  wastewater  tariffs,  which  comprises  a  short  and \nconcise  main  text  of  37  clauses,  and  five  annexes  covering  (i)  rationale  and  explanation,  (ii) \ntariff  calculation  methodology,  (iii)  model  agreement  for  tariff  billing  and  collection,  (iv)  penalty \nand administrative remedies for nonpayment, and (v) model contract for industrial discharge to \nsewer  network.  The  TA\u2019s  recommendations  on  wastewater  tariff  policies,  objectives,  and \nstructure were supported by MOC, which indicated the intention to use the recommendations in \npreparing the draft guidelines for submission to the PRC State Council for approval in 2005. The \nPRC policy guidance on setting wastewater tariffs was amended by Circular No, 1192, issued in \nSeptember  1999  by  MOC,  NDRC,  and  SEPA  jointly.  The  circular  includes  provisions  that \nwastewater  tariffs  be  set  on  the  basis  of  full  cost  recovery  principles  but  allows  local \ngovernments flexibility in deciding the timing for implementing  the circular. \n \nF. \n\nWater Purchase Agreements  \n\n14.  Water  purchase  agreements  (WPAs)  are  required  under  the  proposed  Project  for  the \nShuangyang  and  Meihekou  components.  The  Shuangyang  WSC  will  sell  water  to  the \nShuangyang Tap  Water  Company,  and  Meihekou  WSC  will  buy  raw  water  from  the  Meihekou \nReservoir  Management  Bureau. The  WPAs  will  be  implemented  to  protect  both  the  purchaser \nand the seller. The WPAs, signed in December 2004, specify the minimum quantities to be sold \nand the tariff. \n \nG. \n\nWater Conservation \n\n15. \nThe  water  conservation  policies  pursued  in  conjunction  with  the  Project  include  (i) \nensuring that system losses are kept to a minimum through efficient and commercial operations, \nleakage  detection  and  repair,10  and  training  related  to  reduction  of  nonrevenue  water;  and  (ii) \nproviding market-based incentives to reduce water use through adequate pricing of water and \nwastewater tariffs. ADB is pleased that the Government will use the pricing mechanism during \nthe  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan  to  help  allocate  water  resources  between  competing  uses,  such  as \nagriculture, industry, and municipal. This will encourage the efficient utilization of scarce water \nresources and water conservation. The loan consulting package will include 4 person-months of \ninternational and 7 person-months of domestic consulting to develop a strategic action plan to (i) \ndetect  and  reduce  water  main  leakage,  (ii)  propose  optimum  water  main  rehabilitation  and \nreplacement techniques, and (iii) provide an outline on asset inventory system development for \nthe project cities. \n \nH. \n\nCorporate Governance and Enterprise Reform \n\nADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  during  project  processing  addressed  three  aspects  of  corporate \n16. \ngovernance: (i) strong local ownership, (ii) guaranteed water sales, and (iii) structuring of the IAs \nalong  commercial  lines.  A  detailed  assessment  was  undertaken  of  (i)  CMG,  MMG,  and  LMG \nequity ownership of the respective IAs and their representation on the board of directors; (ii) the \nguaranteeing of water sales through legally binding WPAs; (iii) the incorporation of the IAs under \nPRC Company Law as a registered, limited liability company; (iv) the need for the IAs to prepare \na corporate plan that identifies the longer term operation and financial targets of the enterprise \n                                                 \n9 ADB. 2001.

In  particular,  policies  relating  to  project  budgeting \nshould  require  (a)  a  monthly  review  of  expenditures  against  budgets,  (b)  the \nroutine  use  of  variance  analysis  in  all  monthly  budget  reviews,  and  (c)  budget \nsetting  based  on  both  physical  and  financial  targets.  Budgeting  policies  should \nestablish clear accountability at the level of the work unit and their managers for \ncost  control,  with  a  system  of  rewards  for  exceptionally  good  performance  and \npenalties  for  exceptionally  poor  performance.  All  the  IAs  have  one  or  more  of \nthese policies in place, but the policies are not universally used.  \n\nReview and evaluate policies and procedures relating to conflict of interest and to \nreporting options for whistle blowers. Strong policies in these areas are essential \ntools to prevent wasteful and fraudulent uses of company resources.  \n\nReview policies and procedures concerning delinquent accounts. Water bills that \nwill  never  be  paid  should  be  promptly  recognized  as  bad  debt  and  written  off \nagainst  current  revenues.  Customers  that  regularly  fail  to  pay  their  water  bills \nshould have their water services cut off. If social, political, or economic reasons \nprevent  this  from  happening,  then  the  local  government  should  assume \nresponsibility for compensating the IA for the unpaid water bills. \n\n \nPrivate Sector Participation \n\nI. \n\nADB  is  also  providing  support  to  the  Government  through  a  TA  to  strengthen  policy \n18. \nreform on the use of market-based instruments in enhancing private sector partnership in public \nutilities mainly for water supply, and wastewater and solid waste management.11 This ongoing \nTA will provide an analysis of the issues in the context of international best practices and how \nthese  could  be  adopted  in  the  PRC  situation.  The  ongoing  TAs  will  strengthen  ADB\u2019s  role  in \npromoting  private  sector  partnerships  in  water  supply  and  wastewater.  The  Government  is \nconsidering using market instruments to improve investment and management efficiency in the \npublic utility industries. The Regulated for Chartered Operation in Urban Infrastructure Facilities \n(Regulation) was issued in May 2004. The Regulation outlines the principles and procedures for \nregulating  chartered  operations \nthe \nqualifications of a concessionaire, outlines the contents of a concession agreement, and defines \nresponsibilities  of  the  concession  granting  agency  and  the  concessionaire.  The  outputs  of  the \nTA  included  (i)  an  analysis  of  the  issues  that  need  to  be  resolved  to  attract  private  sector \ninvestment in the PRC from a perspective of international best practices and recommendations \non how these could be addressed in the PRC context; (ii) a study of the Government regulatory \nframework in the water sector; and (iii) comments on the Regulation and recommendations for \namendments to the Regulation. \n \n19. \nDuring  project  processing,  the  main  features  of  the  ADB-supported  Chengdu  build-\noperate-transfer  (BOT)  project  were  discussed  with  CMG,  LMG,  MMG,  and  the  IAs,  who \nexpressed  interest  in  this  modality  of  private  sector  involvement  for  future  investments.

Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n35 \n\nChengdu,  ADB,  together  with  the  European  Investment  Bank,  facilitated  the  participation  of  a \ngroup of six international commercial banks, providing debt funding of $75 million to Chengdu \nGenerale  des-Eaux  Marubeni,  a  consortium  of  Vivendi  Environment  (France)  and  Marubeni \n(Japan),  for  constructing  a  400,000  cubic  meters/day  water  treatment  plant  under  a  BOT \nscheme for Chengdu. Completed in February 2002, the plant has been delivering its contracted \ncapacity to Chengdu municipality, providing an additional source of clean water to its residents.  \n \n20. \nThe Chengdu Project achieved several notable firsts: (i) the first urban water supply BOT \nproject awarded under an open bidding system; (ii) the first official BOT water supply project to \nreach  financial  close  in  the  PRC;  (iii)  the  first  major  BOT  water  supply  project  in  which  the \nsponsors  and  lenders  took  a  municipal  risk;  (iv)  the  first  PRC  project  financing  involving  the  \nEuropean Investment Bank; and (v) first use of an efficient new French technology that enabled \nthe consortium to bid the lowest tariff. This project has received three international awards for \nexcellence. ADB is now actively pursuing other private sector investment opportunities related \nto water supply and wastewater treatment.  \n \nThe  Project  will  create  the  enabling  environment  necessary  for  eventual  private  sector \n21. \nparticipation  by  pursuing  tariff  reforms,  full  cost  recovery,  enterprise  reform,  and  governance, \nwhich are prerequisites for such private sector involvement. Jilin Province is very progressive in \nadopting  water  and  wastewater  tariff  reforms.  During  project  processing,  the  main  features  of \nthe Chengdu BOT project were discussed with CMG, LMG, MMG, and the IAs; they expressed \ninterest in this modality of private sector involvement for future investments. Other modalities of \nprivate  sector  participation  including  leasing contracts  and joint  ventures  were  also  discussed. \nThe  water  and  wastewater  IAs  confirmed  their  intent  to  list  in  one  of  the  regional  stock \nexchanges once the 3-year mandatory period for commercial operations is complete. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n \n \nNo. \nA. \n1205 \n1270 \n1313

A  cursory  assessment  was  completed  for  the  Shuangyang  Water \nSupply Company, established recently to act as IA and is not yet operational. \n \n3. \nSupplementary Appendix D. A summary description of each IA follows. \n \nThe  Changchun  Water  Group  Urban  Drainage  Company  is  responsible  for  three \n4. \nproject  components  and  will  manage  a  significant  portion  of  the  loan  funds.  It  has  prior \nexperience  working  with  an  international  lending  agency  and  foreign  exchange  risks.  It  is \nregistered  and  fully  incorporated,  which  is  unusual  for  wastewater  service  providers  in  the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China.  Adequate  accounting  and  financial  management  policies  and \nprocedures appear to have been implemented, including procedures for project accounting.  \n \n5. \nThe  Changchun  High-Tech  Industry  Development  Company  is  a  prosperous  land \ndevelopment  company.  It  has  a  comprehensive  system  in  place  for  accounting  and  financial \nmanagement, and is registered and fully incorporated. The company is audited annually by an \nindependent auditor. The project component managed by this company, a water management \nstructure,  is  relatively  small.  Water  resources  are  not  an  element  of  the  company\u2019s  core \nbusiness but it has extensive experience in civil works and project management.  \n \n6. \nThe Liaoyuan Water Group Company manages water supply and wastewater operations \nfor  Liaoyuan.  It  is  registered  and  fully  incorporated,  and  has  a  comprehensive,  computerized \naccounting system in place featuring standard reporting and control policies and procedures. It \nis audited annually by an independent auditor. Certain improvements are required notably with \nrespect to budget control.  \n \nThe Meihekou Water Supply Company manages water supply operations for Meihekou. \n7. \nIt  is  registered  and  fully  incorporated.  It  uses  a  manual  accounting  system  featuring  standard \nreporting and control policies and procedures. It is audited annually by an independent auditor \nand a government auditor. This system was found to be generally acceptable but improvements \nare required notably with respect to routine and project budget control.  \n \n8. \nThe  Shuangyang  Water  Supply  Company  is  a  newly  established  company  set  up \nexpressly  to  construct  and  operate  the  project  component  for  Shuangyang  District.  It  is \nregistered and fully incorporated. The company has 10 staff. The general manager, appears to \nhave  a  reasonable  general,  but  not  detailed,  knowledge  of  accounting  and  financial \nmanagement requirements.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n Appendix 7       \n\n41\n\nAll  of  the  operating  IAs  seem  to  have  adequate  accounting  and  financial  management \n9. \npolicies  and  procedures  in  place including  procedures  for  project  accounting.  The  accounts  of \nthe  Changchun  Drainage  Company  and  the  Meihekou  Water  Supply  Company  are  not \ncomputerized  but  this  should  not  be  an  issue.  The  most  significant  shortcomings  concern \nbudgeting  and  cost  control.  With  the  exception  of  the  Changchun  National  High-Tech \nDevelopment  Company,  the  IAs  do  not  appear  to  hold  staff  accountable  for  budget  overruns. \nPolicies and procedures relating to conflict of interest and reporting options for whistle blowers \nneed to be strengthened. The Project provides for training on accounting controls and financial \nmanagement.  \n \n10. \nThe  Jilin  provincial  government  (JPG),  Changchun  municipal  government  (CMG), \nLiaoyuan  municipal  government  (LMG),  and  Meihekou  municipal  government  (MMG)  have \nagreed to the recommendations concerning financial management. All the IAs will be provided \nwith thorough training in ADB loan processing policies and procedures, as well as methods for \nthe effective management of foreign exchange risks. \n\n \nAll  IAs  should  review  and  evaluate  their  budgeting  policies  and  procedures  to  assure \n11. \nthat  these  provide  effective  cost  control.  In  particular,  policies  relating  to  project  budgeting \nshould  require  (i)  a  monthly  review  of  expenditures  against  budgets,  (ii)  the  routine  use  of \nvariance analysis in all monthly budget reviews, and (iii) budget setting based on both physical \nand  financial  targets.  Budgeting  policies  should  also  establish  clear  accountability  for  cost \ncontrol  at  the  level  of  the  work  unit  and  their  managers,  with  a  system  of  rewards  for \nexceptionally good performance and penalties for exceptionally poor performance. All of the IAs \nhave one or more of these policies in place, but the policies are not universally used.  \n\n \n12. \nThe IAs failed to provide clear or detailed information on policies and procedures relating \nto conflict of interest and to reporting options for whistle blowers. Strong policies in these areas \nare  essential  to  prevent  wasteful  and  fraudulent  use  of  company  resources.  The  IAs  should \ntherefore review, evaluate, and strengthen policies and procedures in these areas. \n\n \n13. \nThe  respective  IAs  have  established  a  well  staffed  project  management  offices. \nCompany  accounts  should  be  adapted  and  appropriate  subsidiary  accounts  established  as \nrequired to assure that project management office activities can be separately accounted for. In \nthe  case  of  the  Shuangyang  Water  Supply  Company,  a  qualified  person  has  been  hired  to  fill \nthe  position  of  finance  director.  This  person  will  develop  the  company\u2019s  basic  policies, \nprocedures,  and  systems  for  accounting  and  financial  management  including  its  chart  of \naccounts  and  procedures  for  budgeting  and  cost  control.

In  total,  28  villages  will  be \naffected  by  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  About  78  hectares  (ha)  of  land  will  be \npermanently acquired, of which 21% is classified as farmland; this will affect 244 households or \n911 people. The Project will also require the temporary acquisition of 202 ha, of which 67% is \nfarmland  and  affect  2,305  households  or  8,113  people.  A  total  of  502  households  or  1,799 \npeople  will  be  relocated  and  about  62,729  square  meters  (m2)  of  houses  will  be  demolished. \nTwo small enterprises and 18 shops with a total of 112 employees will be affected and 2,077 m2 \nof commercial structures will be dismantled. In addition, some public infrastructure and facilities \nwill be affected, including gravel roads, culverts, fiber cables, electric poles, transformers, and \nmachine-operated  wells.  The  10,569  people  affected  include  urban  and  rural  residents,  legal \nand  nonlegal  owners  of  structures,  private  business  owners,  and  permanent  and  temporary \nemployees.  \n \nTo  avoid  or  minimize  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  the  preliminary  and  final \n3. \nfeasibility  study  stages  involved  close  consultation  with  local  officials  and  village/street \ncommittees. \n \nCompensation of the permanent land loss is based on the Land Administration Law of \n4. \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (1998) and the State Council Decision to Deepen Reform and \nStrictly  Enforce  Land  Administration  (Document  28  dated  November  2004).  The  house \ndemolishment  is  based  on  the  Provincial  and  Municipal  Urban  Housing  Demolishment \nAdministration  Regulations.  Six  resettlement  plans  (RPs)  were  prepared  to  comply  with  the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) policy on involuntary resettlement. Based on consultations with \nlocal  governments  and  those  affected,  and  general  practice  in  Changchun,  Liaoyuan,  and \nMeihekou  cities,  a  set  of  compensation  standards  was  adopted  by  the  respective  city  project \nmanagement  offices  (PMOs)  and  implementing  agencies  (IAs).  The  resettlement  principles \nestablished  for  the  Project  are  (i)  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement  should  be \navoided  or  minimized  where  feasible  by  developing  and  comparing  a  series  of  design \nalternatives;  (ii)  compensation  and  entitlements  provided  are  based  on  market  value  or \nreplacement  value,  and  must  be  adequate  to  allow  those  affected  to  at  least  maintain  their \npreproject  standard  of  living,  with  the  prospect  of  improvement;  (iii)  land  temporarily  occupied \nand  the  period  for  disruption  are  to  be  kept  to  a  minimum;  (iv)  all  those  affected,  legal  and \nillegal, are to be taken into consideration and accounted for; (v) the per capita landholding after \nland  acquisition  will  be  sufficient  to  maintain  the  previous  livelihood  standard;  (vi)  where  land \nallocation per capita is not sufficient to maintain the previous livelihood standards, other income-\ngenerating  activities  will  be  provided;  (vii)  a  preferential  policy  will  be  provided  to  vulnerable \ngroups in such things as compensation, housing assignment, transfer, and employment; (viii) all \nthose affected will be adequately informed about eligibility, compensation rates and standards, \n\n                                                 \n1  The  Beijiao  wastewater  treatment  plant  phase  II  will  be  built  on  the  existing  industrial  property  owned  by  the \ncompany,  so  no  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  will  be  involved.  Also  the  Long  Shan  water  treatment  works \nimprovement and He Bing water treatment works improvement under the Liaoyuan component will not involve any \nland acquisition and resettlement as the two subprojects involve rehabilitation of water treatment works. \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n\nlivelihood and income restoration plans, and project timing; and (ix) close monitoring and timely \nactions will be carried out to identify and resolve any problems.  \n \n5. \nOn  various  occasions  during  meetings,  interviews,  focus  group  discussions,  public \nconsultation  workshops,  and  community  consultation  meetings,  local  representatives  have \nparticipated in the planning; and concerns integrated into the RPs. The resettlement information \nbooklet was distributed to affected villages and households between August 2004 and January \n2005. The RPs were provided to village offices and resident committees, and was posted on the \nADB  website  in  May  2005.  The  respective  project  IAs  have  established  project  resettlement \nunits to supervise implementation, continue public consultation, monitor progress, and respond \nto  grievances.  The  grievance  address  procedures  are  well  established  and  explanations  are \nincluded in the resettlement information booklets.  \n \n6. \nFor land acquisition, part of the compensation will be paid to the affected village and \nthe  resettlement  subsidy  will  be  paid  to  the  affected  households.  For  residential  houses, \nenterprises,  and  commercial  shops  to  be  demolished,  compensation  will  be  paid  to  owners, \nincluding those without house registration. The payment will be made in cash according to the \nappraised  value  of  the  property.  Households  that  have  to  relocate  will  also  receive  a  transfer \nand  transportation  allowance.  Compensation  for  standing  crops,  auxiliaries,  and  other  assets \nwill be paid directly to affected farmers. Income losses resulting from reduced production/sales \nand wages caused by the Project will be compensated in cash. \n \n7. \nThe  resettlement  strategy  encompasses  (i)  the  replacement  of  housing,  and  (ii)  the \nrestoration  of  livelihoods  and  income.  People  losing  housing  in  urban  areas  have  two \nresettlement  options\u2014to  receive  cash  compensation  or  property  exchange.  Assistance  will  be \nprovided to find available housing close to their original homes, if that is their preference. People \nwill  be  relocated  to  apartment  housing  that  has  better  infrastructure,  e.g.,  water,  sewer,  road, \ngas,  and  electricity.  The  respective  subproject  implementation  units  (PIUs),  IAs,  and  local \ngovernment  will  provide  necessary  assistance  for  house  construction  and  relocation  during \nresettlement implementation. \n \n8. \nThe measures for economic rehabilitation include (i) providing employment opportunities \nduring  the  project  construction  and  operational  phases;  (ii)  arranging  for  those  affected  to  be \nemployed  in  the  local  enterprises  and  businesses;  (iii)  redistributing  land  where  possible;  (iv) \nintensifying and diversifying farm operations to increase the value of production and income per \nunit of land; (v) developing greenhouses and animal-breeding income-generating activities; (vi) \npromoting  and  developing  new  enterprises  and  self-employed  tertiary  businesses  (i.e.,  auto-\naccessory  manufacturing,  transportation,  entertainment,  and  catering  services;  and  (vii) \nproviding  training  on  scientific  and  diversified  agricultural  business,  technology  on  animal \nhusbandry  and  economic  crops  planting,  and \nin \ngreenhouses,  to  assist  those  affected  increase  their  income.  Compensation  paid  to  village \ncommittees will be used to improve village production and infrastructure (e.g., road construction, \nirrigation  works,  clinics,  day  cares,  and  bathhouses).  Relocated  enterprises  and  shops  will  be \nprovided with the options of compensation and resettlement. The same enterprises and shops \nwill either reemploy affected employees, or former employees will help to secure other work. \n \n9. \nBased on the survey results, 7 vulnerable people were identified for the Nanjiao WWTP \nsubproject. The subproject PMO will establish a special fund at CNY2,000 per person for them \nto improve their living standards. The fund will be paid as a one-time cash payment. In addition, \nthe  vulnerable  households  will  receive  CNY140/month  as  municipal  living  guarantee  from  the \nmunicipal  civil  affairs  bureau.  The  PMO  will  supervise  implementation  to  ensure  these \n\ntechnology  on  planting  vegetables \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n47\n\n \n\n \n\nvulnerable  persons  receive  adequate  compensation,  special  funds,  and  municipal  living \nguarantee; and assistance to restore their living conditions and incomes. \n \n10. \nEach PIU and IA will have at least 2 full-time staff responsible for land acquisition and \nresettlement,  respectively.  The  staff  from  each  subproject  resettlement  unit  will  take  the  lead \nresponsibility  for  coordinating  the  planning,  implementation,  financing,  and  monitoring  of  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement.  They  will  work  closely  with  relevant  village/street  officials,  land \nadministration bureaus, and house demolishment offices; and will be responsible for supervision \nand  monitoring  of  resettlement  (e.g.,  delivery  of  entitlements,  selection  of  new  housing  sites, \nrestoration  of  incomes,  provision  of  replacement  land,  and  other  economic  measures).  A \ntraining program will be organized for the resettlement officers.  \n \nThe cost estimate for land acquisition and resettlement is $21.62 million, equivalent to \n11. \nCNY179.43 million in 2004 prices, including contingencies. Resettlement implementation will be \nscheduled  to  precede  the  subproject  construction  schedules.  Most  resettlement  activities  will \noccur between June 2005 and December 2006. Resettlement implementation will be completed \nprior  to  subproject  construction.  Detailed  measurement  surveys  will  be  conducted  in  each \nvillage,  neighborhood,  and  enterprise;  and  the  compensation  contracts  will  be  negotiated  and \nsigned with village committees, households, and enterprises. Based on these surveys, the RPs \nwill be updated and submitted to ADB for review and approval. \n \n12. \nInternal  and  external  monitoring  of  RP  implementation  will  be  conducted.  Monitoring \nmethodologies  are  specified  in  the  RPs.  Internal  supervision  and  monitoring  will  be  done  by \neach IA to ensure compliance with the RP provisions. The PMO and IAs have agreed to a set of \nsupervision milestones with ADB, to ensure timely and effective implementation of resettlement \nactivities.  External  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  carried  out  by  an  independent  agency \nunder contract to the PMO/IAs. External monitoring reports will be forwarded directly to both the \nPMO and ADB. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nA. Changchun  \n1. Nanjiao \nWWTP \n2a. Beijiao \nWWTP \n2b.

However progress on some \ngoals has been slow with respect to improving the proportion of the population with access to safe drinking water and \nreversing  environmental  degradation.  The  Project  will  support  the  achievement  of  the  MDG  for  environmental \nsustainability (MDG, goal 7) and to half the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and \nbasic sanitation by 2015 (MDG, target 10). 1 \n \nThe Project will benefit an urban population of 3.0 million by (i) providing new and improved wastewater services, (ii) \nreducing  flood  damage,  and  (iii)  providing  a  24-hour  water  supply  service.  Of  the  total  beneficiary  population,  about \n210,000 or 7.0% are classified as poor measured by the weighted average local urban poverty line of CNY1,875 per \nperson per year. Provision of clean water will improve the quality of life of the poor and vulnerable people by reducing \nthe proportion of household income spent on medical treatment for waterborne diseases. The number of school days \nand  workdays lost due to sickness  will also be reduced. Further, the Project will reduce the proportion of household \nincome  spent  on  buying  water  from  private  sources,  and  buying  storage  containers,  filters,  and  water  cleaning \nequipment.  \n \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nThe  poverty  analysis  is  based  on  the  data  from  the  urban  household  survey  conducted  by  the  National  Bureau  of \nStatistics (2000) and socioeconomic survey of 1,200 households in Changchun, Liaoyuan, and Meihekou cities from \nJune to August 2004. The data indicate that the urban poverty line was CNY1,875 per capita per year in 2000 prices. \nThe  incidence  of  urban  poverty,  including  the  floating  population  in  2000  using  the  National  Bureau  of  Statistics \nmeasure  is  3.4%,  the  same  as  the  official  incidence  of  rural  poverty  in  2000.  Poor  households  in  the  project  area \ndemonstrate  many  of  the  characteristics  of  the  lowest  income  households  outlined  in  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) poverty profile of the PRC. The characteristics of low income or vulnerable households in the project area are \n(i) head of household is long-term, laid-off former state-owned-enterprise worker, often with children of school age; (ii) \nhouseholds  headed  by  women;  (iii)  households  containing  one  or  more  disabled  or  chronically  sick  person;  and  (iv) \nfloating population, usually from rural areas living in poor housing conditions. \n \nAn order of magnitude analysis of the impact on morbidity and mortality was completed for the Project. This analysis \nindicates that the Project is estimated to reduce disease episodes by an average of 8,000 cases per year. One in 20 of \nthese  cases,  or  400  cases,  is  likely  to  be  serious  enough  to  result  in  a  medical  consultation.  The  health  impact \nanalysis  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  H.  In  the  project  area,  the  major  social  measures  to  protect  urban  residents \nfrom falling into poverty include (i) living allowance for laid-off employees, (ii) unemployment insurance, and (iii) social \nsupport  program  under  the  minimum  living  standard  scheme.  Further,  Changchun  municipal  government  (CMG), \nLiaoyuan  municipal  government  (LMG),  and  Meihekou  municipal  government  (MMG)  have  agreed  to  implement \npoverty reduction2 measures under the Project including (i) providing lifeline tariffs, (ii) providing water bill discounts or \ncash  rebates  amounting  to  50%  of  the  monthly  water  bill  for  households  living  below  the  poverty  line;  and  (iii) \nconnecting the poorest households to tap water in Liaoyuan, Meihekou, and Shuangyang district in Changchun. The \nProject will promote public awareness and education programs about the benefits of the Project, public hygiene and \nbehavior of consumers on water saving, and managing wastewater disposal. The Project will provide 3,200 full- time \njobs over the 5-year construction period.  Project-related services, such as procurement of construction  materials and \nequipment and follow-on multiplier effects are expected to create an additional 5,000 full-time jobs. Just over half of \nthe  construction  jobs are  unskilled  jobs that are  most  likely  to be  filled by currently  unemployed  persons.  Since  \n \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2004. Poverty Profile of the People\u2019s Republic of China. Manila. \n2 The TA study (i) defined poverty levels used in the analysis; (ii) assessed and provided an income and expenditure \nprofile of the poor households based on a household survey of 1,200 households; (iii) evaluated and recommended \nmeasures  to  alleviate  the  impacts  of  increased  water  and  wastewater  tariffs  on  the  poor;  and  (iv)  assessed  the \npositive impacts of the Project on the poor and low-income beneficiaries.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n51 \n\nunemployment  is  a  major  cause  of  poverty  in  the  project  area,  the  poor  will  benefit  disproportionately  from  this  job \ncreation. Further, project operations will create 570 full-time permanent jobs. \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\n \n\n \n\n   No \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\n   Yes               \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nStakeholder analysis has been conducted throughout project preparation through public participation and consultation \nwith  key  stakeholders,  such  as  government  agencies,  beneficiaries,  people  affected  by  the  Project,  business \ncommunities, and civil society organizations. In addition to the socioeconomic survey, public consultation, focus group \ndiscussion,  and  key  respondent  interviews  have  been  conducted  with  170  persons  in  the  project  area.  The  issues \ndiscussed include qualitative aspects of poverty, gender aspects, affordability and willingness to pay for water service, \nbenefits of  water and sanitation to poor and women, impact of land acquisition, supply  of water, flood problems and \nrelief, coping mechanisms for interrupted water services, and satisfaction to water service. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \nParticipatory  approach  has  been  part  of  the  project  design  and  will  be  continued  during  project  implementation, \nmonitoring,  and  evaluation.  During  project  preparation,  public  hearing  meetings  on  water  supply  and  wastewater \ntreatment,  and  government  policies  and  efforts  to  develop  water  supply  service  were  held  in  the  project  cities.  The \nparticipants  unanimously  concluded  that  a  tariff  adjustment  was  necessary  to  recover  costs,  assist  with  the \nsustainable  development  of  water  supply  and  sewerage  system,  conserve  water,  protect  the  environment,  improve \nservices, and help poor families. Further public consultations will be held during project implementation to discuss and \nget  feedback  from  consumers  and  other  key  stakeholders,  particularly  the  poor,  on  cost  recovery,  tariff  adjustment, \naffordability, public participation, water conservation, hygiene program, and environmental protection.  \n \nTwo  rounds  of  five  public  consultations  in  project  cities  were  carried  out  in  preparing  the  environmental  impact \nassessment.  The  purpose  of  public  consultations  and  disclosure  was  to  (i)  introduce  the  project  components  to  the \nstakeholders;  (ii)  solicit  ideas,  suggestions,  comments,  concerns,  and  critiques  on  the  potential  environmental \nimplications  of  the  Project;  and  (iii)  present  the  findings  of  the  environmental  impact  assessment,  summarizing \npotential environmental impacts and mitigation measures, and provide answers raised by workshop participants in the \nfirst  round.  Plans  for  public  involvement  during  the  design  and  construction  stages  of  the  Project  were  developed. \nThese plans will provide forums for periodically updating the stakeholders on project progress and implementation of \nmitigation measures. \n \nPublic  consultation  and  disclosure  of  resettlement  plans  have  been  conducted  on  various  occasions  during \nmeasurement surveys, village meetings, interviews, and workshops. Results of these meetings and concerns of those \naffected are integrated in the resettlement plans.  \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nWater service deficiencies contribute to gender inequalities in terms of women\u2019s income-generating opportunities and \ngeneral status. Data from the social assessment survey clearly indicate that women cope with service deficiencies by \nspending more time and labor on collecting and purifying water, and cleaning up after floods. Women are also mainly \nresponsible for caring for the sick. Consequently, time spent on income-generating activities or the family is reduced.  \nImprovements to water supply will significantly reduce the time, cost, and labor that mainly women spend for collecting \nwater, cleaning containers, and improving water quality. To maximize the project benefits, women will be given priority \nfor  the  employment  opportunities  generated  by  the  Project.  Women\u2019s  needs  and  interests  will  be  represented  in \nproject  implementation.  To  maximize  project  benefits  for  women,  under  the  Health  Bureau  hygiene  program  in  four \ndistricts, women have been mobilized to play a role in public awareness of the hygiene program in the project area. \n \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \nE.

The technical assistance team reviewed \nlocal socioeconomic data, interviewed staff with social \naffairs agencies, undertook household surveys, and \ncompleted analysis of affordability. For the households \nwith average income, the combined water and wastewater \ntariff is less than 2% of total income (3.4% of the total \nincome for poor households) and is thus considered \naffordable.  \n \nTariff adjustment will be offset for most families by a \nreduction in expenditure on purchased water. The \nhouseholds most likely to be adversely affected by the \ntariff adjustment are those living below the poverty line. To \nmitigate the impact of tariff adjustment, the project cities \nprovide assistance for people living below the poverty line \nthrough a minimum living standard scheme besides the \nfive social insurance schemes, which cover old-age \npension, health care, disability compensation, \nunemployment, and maternity benefits. In addition, the \nproject cities provide water bill discounts or cash rebates \nin the amount of 50% of monthly water bill for household \nbelow the poverty line. The minimum living standard \nscheme and water bill discounts will offset the proposed \ntariff adjustment and are much better poverty reduction \nmeasures than the lifeline tariff primarily because they can \nbe properly targeted to poor households. \n \nNo job losses will occur. The construction and operation \nof the Project will generate many employment \nopportunities for the local beneficiaries. \n\n \nEthnic minorities of Manchu and Korean reside in the \nproject area; they are mixed with the Han majority. The \nsocial assessment shows that they are not negatively \naffected by the Project and are among the project \nbeneficiaries.  \n \nNo other social risks are anticipated as a result of the \nProject.  \n\n Full \n\n Short \n\n None \n\n6 RPs \n \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n53 \n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \n\nIntroduction \n\nA. \n \nThe financial analysis was prepared in accordance with Asian Development Bank (ADB) \n1. \nGuidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by \nADB.1 Details of the financial analysis and financial projections are in Supplementary Appendix \nF.  An  assessment  of  financial  performance  was  completed  for  operations  once  the  Project  is \nimplemented. The assessment was completed for the implementing agencies (IAs) that operate \nas enterprises.  \n \nB. \n \n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis \n\nPurpose and Approach \n\n1. \n \n2. \nThe  project  evaluation  assessed  the  financial  performance  of  the  IAs  following  project \nimplementation. The evaluation is completed for those IAs that will operate project components \non  a  self-financing  basis  based  on  tariff  revenues.  These  IAs  and  their  associated  project \ncomponents are identified. The evaluation determines the level of cost recovery from users that \nis required to service the ADB loan and achieve financial health.  \n \n3. \nKey  features  of  the  financial  evaluation  include  (i)  financial  evaluations  of  project \ncomponents were carried out in real terms using 2004 prices; (ii) financial internal rate of return \n(FIRR)  was  determined  using  incremental  annual  cash  flows  over  25years  of  operations;  (iii) \nresidual value of physical assets is assumed to equal its remaining book or depreciated value at \nthe end of the evaluation period; (iv) evaluation was carried out for the project components and \nthe combination of project components that feature cost recovery through tariffs; and (v) all cost \nand revenue projections were prepared using a pro forma financial modeling approach.  \n \n\n2. \n\nWeighted Average Cost of Capital \n\n4. \nThe  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  was  calculated  in  real  terms  for  the \nProject. Funding sources for the Project are the ADB loan (43%), a local bank loan (3%), and \ncapital  contributions  from  local  governments  (54%).  The  cost  of  foreign  debt  was  calculated \nbased  on  a  nominal  interest  rate  of  5.14%,  an  income  tax  rate  of  33%,  and  an  international \ninflation rate of 1.5% per annum. The real cost of foreign debt was estimated to be 1.59%. The \ncost of local debt was calculated based on a nominal interest rate of 6.21%, income tax rate of \n33%, and domestic inflation rate of 2.7% per annum. The real cost of local debt was estimated \nto be 2.29%. The WACC was determined to be 1.90% for the base case analysis. \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return \n\n5. \nEstimates of the FIRR were made for a base case scenario and to test sensitivity.

These  values \ncompare  favorably  to  the  WACC  of  1.9%.  All  four  project  components  are  financially  viable \nbased on their returns to net assets. Their debt-service coverage ratios are adequate. \n \nThe estimate of FIRR for the Project and its components seem to be fairly insensitive to \n7. \nthe variations tested in the sensitivity analysis. Increases in capital costs and in O&M costs have \nthe  greatest  impact  across  all  project  components  followed  by  a  delay  in  tariff  adjustments  or \nsales growth. But even the combination of a 10% increase in project costs plus a delay in tariff \nadjustments did not depress the FIRR below the WACC.2 The sensitivity analysis suggests that \ntariff  reform  and  improved  financial  management,  particularly  with  respect  to  cost  control,  are \nthe most important factors to assure a successful project outcome.  \n \n\nTable A12.2: Summary of the FIRR and Sensitivity Analysis \n(%) \n\n \n \n \nProject Component \nChangchun Wastewater \nShuangyang Water Supply \nLiaoyuan Water Supply and \nWastewater \nMeihekou Water Supply \nTotal  \n \n\n \n \nBase \nCase \n5.7 \n5.7 \n9.5 \n\n \nProject \nCosts \n+10% \n4.8 \n4.7 \n8.4 \n\n \nO&M \nCosts \n+10% \n5.1\n4.0\n8.4\n\nSales \nGrowth \nDelay by 1 \nyear \n5.6 \n5.1 \n9.0 \n\nTariff \nIncrease \nDelay by 1 \nyear \n4.9 \n5.9 \n8.8 \n\n5.0\n5.5\nFIRR = financial internal rate of return, O&M =  operation and maintenance.   \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n4.7 \n5.3 \n\n5.5 \n6.2 \n\n5.4 \n6.1 \n\n5.0 \n5.5 \n\n                                                 \n2   The WACC showed very little sensitivity to the different tests, falling at most to 1.89%. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n55 \n\nTable A12.3: Estimated Financial Performance Ratios of the Implementing Agencies \n\nProject Component \n\n \n\n \n\nChangchun  \nWastewater \n \n \n \nShuangyang  \nWater Supply \n \n \n \nLiaoyuan Water \nSupply and \nWastewater \n \n \nMeihekou Water  \nSupply \n \n \n \n\nTest \n\n \nTarget level (cid:198) \nBase case \nProject costs up 10% \nO&M costs up 10% \nDelay sales growth 1 year \nDelay tariff increase 1 yr \nBase case \nProject costs up 10% \nO&M costs up 10% \nDelay sales growth 1 year \nDelay tariff increase 1 yr \nBase case \nProject costs up 10% \nO&M costs up 10% \nDelay sales growth 1 year \nDelay tariff increase 1 yr \nBase case \nProject costs up 10% \nO&M costs up 10% \nDelay sales growth 1 year \nDelay tariff increase 1 yr \n\nRate of \nProfit \n6% to \n8% \n8.53 \n8.21 \n8.53 \n8.52 \n8.39 \n10.32 \n9.71 \n10.32 \n10.00 \n10.43 \n11.18 \n10.94 \n11.12 \n11.08 \n11.12 \n9.89 \n9.40 \n9.89 \n9.88 \n9.75 \n\nMinimum \nDSCR \n \n 1.2 \n4.23 \n3.85 \n4.23 \n4.11 \n3.31 \n2.82 \n2.57 \n2.82 \n2.67 \n2.82 \n1.50 \n1.51 \n1.48 \n1.50 \n1.45 \n1.54 \n1.43 \n1.54 \n1.54 \n1.49 \n\nCurrent \nRatio \n \n 1.2 \n16.76 \n15.99 \n16.76 \n16.67 \n14.68 \n6.07 \n5.90 \n6.07 \n5.95 \n6.04 \n4.67 \n4.32 \n4.58 \n4.67 \n4.34 \n12.13 \n11.42 \n12.13 \n12.13 \n11.14 \n\nDebt \nEquity \n 2.3 \n(70:30) \n0.43 \n0.45 \n0.43 \n0.43 \n0.45 \n1.16 \n1.18 \n1.16 \n1.18 \n1.15 \n0.35 \n0.37 \n0.35 \n0.35 \n0.36 \n0.76 \n0.77 \n0.76 \n0.76 \n0.78 \n\nDSCR = debt service coverage ratio, O&M = operation and maintenance \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\n \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n \nA. \n\nIdentification of Projects and Analysis of Alternatives \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\n1. \nThe Jilin Water Supply and Sewerage Development Project was identified in the Tenth \nFive-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005)  as  the  least  cost  alternative  to  addressing  the  wastewater \ntreatment and water supply needs in the cities of Changchun, Liaoyuan, and Meihekou in Jilin \nProvince.  During  the  design  of  the  Project,  alternative  locations  and  specifications  for  the \nwastewater treatment plant, sewer networks, water treatment plants, pumping stations, and raw \nwater transmission and distribution mains were considered within the project area. The detailed \neconomic analysis and least cost analysis are in Supplementary Appendix J. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic Parameters and Assumptions \n\n2. \nAn  economic  analysis  of  the  Project  was  conducted  over  25  years  inclusive  of  project \nconstruction.  Project  construction  commences  in  2005  and  is  completed  in  2009,  while \ncommissioning commences in 2010. Economic benefits and costs were denominated in terms \nof the domestic price numeraire and expressed in constant 2004 prices. International costs were \nconverted to local currency costs using an exchange rate that started at CNY8.26 per $1, and \nwere  adjusted  annually  based  on  a  purchasing  power  parity  assumption.  Project  costs  and \nbenefits  were  estimated  on  a  without-  and  with-project  basis  appropriately  apportioned  on  the \nbasis  of  nonincremental  and  incremental  project  effects  in  accordance  with  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects and Handbook for \nthe  Economic  Analysis  of  Water  Supply  Projects.  Tradable  components  were  adjusted  to \neconomic  prices  using  a  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  of  1.013,  and  nontraded  components \nwere valued at domestic market prices. A shadow wage rate factor of 2.0 and 0.67 was applied \nto the wage of skilled and unskilled labor respectively at the domestic price level.  \n \nC. \n\nCosts \n\n3. \nBase costs plus physical contingencies of the Project and each of the subproject capital \ncosts  were  estimated  and  apportioned  on  the  basis  of  tradable,  nontradable,  and  skilled  and \nunskilled  labor  costs.  Similarly,  operation  and  maintenance  costs  for  each  subproject  and  the \noverall  Project  were  estimated,  apportioned  on  the  basis  of  tradable  and  nontradable  works, \nconsumables,  services,  equipment  and  machinery,  and  skilled  and  unskilled  labor  valued  in \neconomic  prices,  i.e.,  shadow  wage  rate  factors.  Additional  conversion  factors  were  used  as \nnecessary. Transfer payments were excluded in the valuation of the cost estimates in economic \nprices. Physical contingencies were added to capital costs.  \n \nD. \n\nProject Benefits \n\nThe Project\u2019s primary benefits include \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nimproved wastewater collection and treatment services in Changchun; \nprovision of an alternative low-cost supply of water for industrial users based on \nreuse of treated wastewater effluent; \nreduced flood damage on the Yongchun River in Changchun;  \nimproved  water  supply \nMeihekou, and Shuangyang; and \nimproved local drainage works to reduce local flooding in Liaoyuan. \n\ntreatment  and  distribution  services \n\nin,  Liaoyuan, \n\n \n\n \n\n4. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n     Appendix 13 \n\n57\n\n \n\n1. \n\nWater Supply Benefits \n\n \n5. \nBenefits  associated  with  the  improved  water  supply  treatment  and  distribution  services \ninclude  the  provision  of  24-hour  service  in  areas  currently  experiencing  interrupted  service, \nimprovements in system pressure, increased security of supply, improved drinking water quality, \nreduced  risk  of  exposure  to  waterborne  pathogens  in  delivered  tap  water,  and  reductions  in \nnonrevenue water.  \n \nIndirect benefits of a 24-hour service for domestic beneficiaries include the elimination of \n6. \nfinancial  costs  incurred  to  cope  with  the  interrupted  water  supply  service,  elimination  of \ndisruptions including loss of employment opportunity, and a general enhancement of the quality \nof life. Nondomestic water supply customers will benefit financially due to lower costs and fewer \ndisruptions to production.  \n \n7. \nWater supply benefits are estimated using a willingness-to-pay approach. Water supply \ncustomers  were  asked  to  state  their  willingness-to-pay  for  service  improvements  and  their \nrevealed  willingness-to-pay  is  used  to  measure  benefit  to  customers.  Provided  that  customers \nare  well  informed,  the  amount  of  willingness-to-pay  represents  a  value  for  all  anticipated \nbenefits, including reduced health risk.  \n \nThe  economic  benefits  for  water  supply  improvements  were  estimated  for  the \n8. \nincremental  annual  water  demand  over  the  25-year  period  of  analysis.  Average  benefits  for \nproject components were estimated to be \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n \n\nLiaoyuan: CNY 4.7/ cubic meter (m3); \nMeihekou: CNY 7.3/m3; and \nShuangyang: CNY 8.8/m3. \n\n2. \n\nWastewater Benefits \n\n9. \nThe impacts associated with improvements in wastewater collection and treatment and \nthe  effluent  reuse  scheme  in  Changchun  include  (i)  lower  ongoing  discharge  of  untreated \nwastewater  to  receiving  streams,  (ii)  reduced  frequency  of  acute  surface  water  contamination \ndue  to  combined  sewer  overflows,  and  (iii)  reduced  hydraulic  loading  of  treated  wastewater \neffluent to receiving streams. Benefits that flow from these impacts include (i) improved aquatic \nenvironment in local streams and downstream in the Songhua River, (ii) reduced risk of human \nand livestock exposure to waterborne pathogens in surface waters, (iii) reduced transboundary \naquatic pollution in the Songhua River Basin, (iv) provision of low-cost water for industrial uses, \nand (v) enhanced sustainability of drinking water supplies for Changchun.  \n \nTwo approaches are used to evaluate these benefits. The first considers the wastewater \n10. \ncomponents within the broader context of urban, provincial, and national policies and objectives \nfor wastewater management and water quality control. Assuming these policies and objectives \nreflect  social  choice,  the  basic  requirement  is  that  the  Project  be  a  least  cost  option  that \ncontributes to achievement of the policy objectives.1 The second entails a quantitative analysis \nbased  on  willingness  to  pay  for  wastewater  improvements.  This  analysis  can  only  capture  a \nportion  of  project  benefits  since  it  only  considers  urban  wastewater  service  customers  in \nChangchun and not downstream beneficiaries. \n\n                                                 \n1 This approach is outlined in Dole, D. 2003. Economic Issues in the Design and Analysis of a Wastewater Treatment \n\nProject. Manila: ADB. \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\n \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nThe  national  policy  for  pollution  control  endorses  the  use  of  cost-effective  wastewater \n11. \nmanagement measures to achieve overall treatment targets. Under guidelines from the Ministry \nof  Construction,2  major  cities  like  Changchun  should  achieve  a  wastewater  treatment  rate  of \n70%  by  2010.  In  its  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan  for  Environmental  Protection,  Jilin  Province \nestablished  a  water  quality  target:  by  2010,  85%  of  the  Songhua  River  Basin  river  network \nwould  achieve  at  least  a  class  III  standard.  This  target  is  to  be  achieved  primarily  through \nimproved wastewater treatment. Changchun\u2019s target for water quality in the Yitong River is class \nIII by 2010. \n \n12. \nAt  present,  the  Yitong  River,  which  receives  the  majority  of  Changchun  wastewater \nflows, has class V water quality downstream of Changchun. Almost 60% of the Songhua River \nwas  in  class  IV  or  V  in  2002  and  40%  of  the  river  by  length  was  class  III.  The  proposed \nwastewater  works  are  therefore  consistent  with  provincial  plans.  Proposed  works  are  also \nconsistent with the Changchun City Urban Master Plan (1996\u20132020) and its Water Supply and \nSewage Master Plan. \n \nThe quantitative analysis of wastewater benefits is based on customer willingness to pay \n13. \nfor  wastewater  improvements  provided  in  response  to  a  household  survey.3  The  average \nwillingness  to  pay  was  estimated  to  be  CNY0.50  per  m3  of  metered  water  use.  This  amount \nrepresents  the  incremental  amount  customers  would  willingly  pay  through  their  water  bill  in \nreturn for the benefits associated with proposed wastewater improvements. It is an estimate of \nbenefit  for  the  urban  population  but  does  not  reflect  the  value  of  these  improvements  to \ndownstream  beneficiaries.  The  calculation  of  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the \nChangchun wastewater component is therefore an understatement of the true EIRR. \n \n14.  Wastewater  benefits  in  Changchun  will  be  offset  in  part  by  increases  in  wastewater \ndischarges  associated  with  water  supply  system  improvements  in  Liaoyuan,  Meihekou,  and \nShuangyang.  In  all  three  cases,  water  demand  will  increase  significantly  in  response  to \nimprovements in system pressure and an end to service interruptions. This in turn will cause an \nincrease in the generation of wastewater. Upgrades to the sewage network in Liaoyuan will help \noffset the wastewater increase in that city and Meihekou has completed a feasibility study report \nfor a wastewater treatment plant which was recently approved. From a watershed perspective, \nthe net impact of the Project will still be positive since pollutant loading reductions in Changchun \nexceed  loading  increases  from  these  three  cities.4  Moreover,  the  negative  impact  of  higher \nwastewater effluent volumes will diminish over time as national wastewater treatment standards \nare implemented in urban areas. \n \n\n3. \n\nFlood Reduction Benefits  \n\n15. \nFlood damage reduction benefits will be realized in Liaoyuan and the Yongchun River in \nChangchun.  These  are  estimated  using  an  avoided  damages  approach.  In  the  case  of \nLiaoyuan, damage estimates were based on responses to questions in the project preparatory \ntechnical assistance household survey. Damage estimates for the Yongchun River were based \non  standard  methods  and  parameters  for  flood  damage  calculations  used  in  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China.  In  both  cases,  annual  damage  was  measured  as  averages  considering \nfrequency of flooding to various depths.  \n                                                 \n2 Urban Wastewater Treatment and Control Technology Advice, Ministry of Construction, 2000. \n3   Survey  documentation  in  ADB.  2004.  Final  Report  for  TA  4227-PRC:  Jilin  Water  Supply  and  Sewerage \n\nDevelopment Project, Appendix 6.9. Manila.  \n\n4   The combined service population of the three smaller cities was just 29% of the Changchun service population in \n\n2004. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n     Appendix 13 \n\n59\n\n \n\n \n16. \nThe estimates of flood damage reduction are not measures of willingness to pay to avoid \nflooding. They only measure direct damage and, in the case of Liaoyuan, lost work time. Thus \nthey  fail  to  capture  benefits  associated  with  avoidance  of  risk  and  improved  living  conditions, \nand represent a lower limit for flood damage reduction benefits. \n \nE. \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return \n\nThe  base  case  EIRR  is  21.1%  for  the  overall  Project  and  varies  between  16.6  and \n17. \n32.3%  for  project  components  (Table  A13).  These  results  suggest  that  the  Project  is  highly \nbeneficial from a social perspective.  \n \nThe sensitivity analysis indicates that project costs, and the timing of tariff adjustments \n18. \nor  sales  growth  have  the  greatest  impact  on  the  EIRR  but  these  factors  are  not  enough  to \noverturn the judgement that this Project is socially beneficial. This is true even when a delay in \ntariff adjustments and an increase in project costs are combined. \n \n19. \nSwitching  values  for  the  cost  based  tests  were  high.  The  EIRR  did  not  fall  below  12% \nuntil project costs were increased by more than 91% or operation and maintenance costs were \nincreased by more than 190%. \n\nTable A13: Estimated EIRR \n(%) \n\n \nEIRR \n\nChangchun \nWW \n\nShuangyang \nWholesale \nWS \n\nBase Case \n\n16.6 \n\nSensitivity Analysis Tests \n\n32.2 \n\n \n\n30.0 \n\n31.6 \n\n15.1 \n\n16.2 \n\nLiaoyuan \nWS, WW \n\nMeihekou \nWS \n\nLiaoyuan \nFDR \n\nYongchun \nFDR \n\nTotal \nProject \n\n30.0 \n\n \n\n28.1 \n\n20.9 \n\n \n\n19.5 \n\n32.3 \n\n \n\n30.4 \n\n25.6 \n\n \n\n24.0 \n\n21.1 \n\n \n\n19.5 \n\n29.4 \n\n20.7 \n\n32.2 \n\n25.5 \n\n20.7 \n\n16.4 \n\n29.8 \n\n28.7 \n\n20.8 \n\n32.3 \n\n25.6 \n\n20.7 \n\n15.7 \n\n33.2 \n\n30.2 \n\n20.8 \n\n32.3 \n\n25.6 \n\n20.6 \n\n14.3 \n\n30.9 \n\n28.2 \n\n19.4 \n\n30.4 \n\n24.0 \n\n19.1 \n\nFDR= flood damage reduction; O&M = operation and maintenance, WS = water supply; WW = wastewater. \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nProject costs \nup by 10% \n\nO&M costs \nup by 10% \n\n1 year delay \nin sales \ngrowth  \n\n1 year delay \nin tariff \nincreases \n\n1 year delay \nin tariff \nincreases \nplus 10% \nincrease in \nproject costs \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 31 May 2005) \n", "Currency Unit\nCNY1.00\n$1.00\n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n", "yuan (CNY) \n$0.121 \nCNY8.27 \n \n", "Asian Development Bank \nBuild-operate-transfer \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Changchun municipal government \neconomic internal rate of return \n\u2013 \nfinancial internal rate of return \n\u2013 \ninternational competitive bidding \n\u2013 \nimplementing agency \n\u2013 \nJilin provincial government \n\u2013 \nhectare \n\u2013 \nkilometer \n\u2013 \nLondon interbank offered rate \n\u2013 \nLiaoyuan municipal government \n\u2013 \ncubic meter \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Millennium Development Goal \n\u2013  Meihekou municipal government \n\u2013  Ministry of Construction \n\u2013  National Development and Reform Commission \n\u2013  National Guidelines on Water Tariffs \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  weighted average cost of capital \n\u2013  water purchase agreement \n\u2013  water supply company \n\u2013  water treatment plant \n\u2013  wastewater treatment plant \n \n", "nonpoint source pollution \noperation and maintenance \nproject implementing unit \nproject management office \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \nproject steering committee \nresettlement plan \nsummary environmental impact assessment \nState Environmental Protection Agency \nSonghua River Basin \n", " \nNOTES \n", " \n", "ADB \nBOT \nCMG \nEIRR \nFIRR \nICB \nIA \nJPG \nha \nkm \nLIBOR \nLMG \nm3 \nMDG \nMMG \nMOC \nNDRC \nNGWT \nNSP \nO&M \nPIU \nPMO \nPRC \nPSC \nRP \nSEIA \nSEPA \nSRB \nWACC \nWPA \nWSC \nWTP \nWWTP \n \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December.  \nIn this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars.  \n", "This report was prepared by a team consisting of S.
