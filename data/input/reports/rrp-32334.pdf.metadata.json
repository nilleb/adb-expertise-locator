An environmental impact assessment was undertaken, \nand  the  summary  was  made  public  through  web  site  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) on 5 March 2002. \n\nThe Project is located in Sichuan Province in the poor southwestern \nregion of the PRC. In 2001 the per capita gross domestic product of \nSichuan was about two thirds of the national average. The Project \nwill  support  the  Government\u2019s  Western  Region  Development \nStrategy  by  building  an  important  section  of  the  western  region \nroute in Sichuan Province by (i) constructing an expressway across \nhilly to mountainous terrain; (ii) improving local roads servicing poor \ncounties and townships; and (iii) providing consulting services and \ntraining  to  enhance  construction  quality,  road  safety,  and  project \nmonitoring and evaluation.  \n\nTo  enhance  economic  development  and  reduce  poverty  in  the \nwestern  part  of  the  PRC,  the  Government  adopted  the  long-term \nWestern Region Development Strategy, which is the key theme of \nthe  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005).  The  strategy  aims  to \nreduce  development  disparities  between  the  western  and  coastal \nregions.  The  road  sector  forms  an  important  part  of  the  strategy, \nas it provides a vital link between these two regions. The Project \nwill  support  the  strategy  by  building  part  of  the  western  region \nroute  in  Sichuan  Province  and  will  improve  the  access  of  the \nsouthern part of Sichuan Province. \n\nThe  main  objective  is  to  accelerate  economic  development  and \nthereby  reduce  poverty  in  Sichuan  Province.  The  Project  will  (i) \nalleviate  congestion  and  reduce  traffic  accidents  and  vehicle \noperating  costs;  (ii)  improve  access  between  Chengdu  and \nKunming, two major centers in the western PRC; and (iii) improve \naccess  for  the  poor  rural  residents  in  the  transport  corridor.  The \nProject comprises (i) construction of a 160 kilometer (km) of four-\nto \nlane,  access-controlled \nPanzhihua, including access roads, interchanges with toll stations, \ntunnels,  bridges,  administrative  stations,  and  service  areas;  (ii) \nupgrading  of  558  km  of  county  and  township  roads  to  improve \nthe  economic \naccess  of \nmainstream; (iii) procurement of equipment for road maintenance, \ntoll  collection,  surveillance  and  communications,  vehicle  weigh \nstations, \nland \nroad  safety,  and  office  administration; \nacquisition  and  resettlement;  and  (v)  consulting  services  for \nconstruction supervision, safety audits, monitoring and evaluation, \nand capacity building. \n\nthe  poor  and  minority  areas \n\ntoll  expressway \n\nfrom  Xichang \n\n(iv) \n\nto \n\nBorrower \n \nClassification  \n\n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \nObjectives  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nCost Estimates \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project,  including  physical  and  price \ncontingencies  and  interest  during  construction,  is  estimated  at \n$1,019 million equivalent, of which $464 million (46%) is in foreign \nexchange and $555 million equivalent (54%) in local currency. \n\nSource \n\nAsian Development Bank  \nMinistry of Communications  \nSichuan Provincial Government  \nChina Development Bank  \n\nTotal \n% \n\nForeign \nExchange \n300 \n0 \n164 \n0 \n464 \n46 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\n($ million) \n\nTotal \nCost \n300 \n145 \n308 \n266 \n 1,019 \n100 \n\n0 \n145 \n144 \n266 \n555 \n54 \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $300 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nprovided  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility.

Civil works for \nthe  expressway  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive \nbidding.  Civil  works  for  local  roads  will  be  procured  through  local \ncompetitive  bidding  or  force  account.  On  7  March  2002,  ADB \napproved advance action for procurement of civil works. Equipment \nwill  be  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding  or \ninternational shopping. \n\nAbout  64  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  will \nbe provided under the Project to (i) assist in project management \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \nProject Benefits and  \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\nv\n\nduring the construction period; (ii) provide expertise in tunnel and \nbridge  construction;  (iii)  conduct  a  safety  audit  of  the  project \ndesign,  and  make  recommendations  on  improving  the  safety  of \ncompleted  construction  works;  (iv)  help  set  up  and  implement \nquality  control  procedures;  (v)  assist  in  formulating  a  human \nresource  development  and \ntraining  program;  and  (vi)  help \nestablish  and  implement  a  project  performance  management \nsystem,  including  assessing  the  impact  on  poverty  reduction. \nAbout 4,350 person-months of domestic consulting services will be \nrequired for construction supervision. The international consultants \nwill be financed from the ADB loan and be recruited based on the \nquality- and cost-based selection method in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  On  7  March  2002,  ADB \napproved  advance  action \ninternational \nfor \nconsultants.  The  domestic  consultants  will  be  financed  by  SPCD \nand  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  Government  procedures \nacceptable to ADB. \n\nrecruitment  of \n\nBy improving local roads to poor counties and townships  in addition \nto  constructing  the  expressway,  the  Project  will  help  improve \naccess to market opportunities and social services for the poor rural \nresidents in the project area. The Project will reduce transport time \nand  costs,  and  thereby  promote  investments,  enhance  incomes, \nand create employment opportunities. The economic internal rate of \nreturn  is  estimated  at  16.2%.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return \nafter  tax  for  the  expressway  component  is  5.5%,  which  is  higher \nthan  the  real  weighted  average  cost  of  capital.  There  are  197,000 \nproject  beneficiaries,  or  20%  of  the  total,  living  below  the  income \nlevels  of  CNY1,000  in  rural  and  CNY3,000  in  urban  areas.  The \ndistribution analysis shows that the proportion of net project benefits \npassed on to the poor, or the poverty impact ratio, is 24%. This ratio \nis higher than the country\u2019s poverty incidence and the income share \nof  the  poor.  The  main  project  beneficiaries  of  the  local  road \ncomponent  will  be  households  in  poor  counties  and  townships  in \nthe project area, providers of rural transport services, industrial and \nagricultural  businesses,  agriculture-based  households  producing \ngrains  and  vegetables  for  local  markets,  people  visiting  the \nhistorical sites along the expressway alignment, people living in the \nproject area who will have easier access to long-distance transport \nservices,  and  transport  operators  and  their  customers  for  transit \ntraffic.  The  Project  will  also  help  reduce  traffic  accidents,  vehicle \nemissions, and traffic noise on the existing roads. \n\nthe \n\nThe  Project  was  formulated  to  reduce  potential  risks.  The  main \ntechnical risks are associated with the extensive tunnel and bridge \nstructures.  To  mitigate \ninternational  consultants \nreviewed \nthe  proposed  design  and  construction  methods. \nPrequalification  of  contractors  focuses  on  their  financial  and \ntechnical  capability  in  handling  complex  works.  During  the \nconstruction  period,  monitoring  and  contract  management \ninformation  systems  will  be  set  up  and  implemented,  with  the \nassistance of the international consultants, for timely identification \n\nrisks, \n\n\fof technical problems and implementation of corrective measures. \nEconomic performance in the project influence area would have to \ndeteriorate substantially for the Project to lose economic viability. \nThe  financial  risk  associated  with  construction  and  operation  of \nthe expressway will depend on the actual construction costs when \ncontracts  are  awarded  and  the  subsequent  implementation.  To \nmitigate  this  risk,  SPECL  is  consciously  oriented  to  building  up  a \ncommercial business environment for expressway operations, and \nthe  project  expressway  will  receive  substantial  equity  from  the \ncentral and provincial governments.  \n\nvi \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  (RRP) 1  on  a \n1. \nproposed  loan  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Southern  Sichuan  Roads \nDevelopment Project (The project framework is in Appendix 1).  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nDespite  the  Government's  efforts  to  increase  the  country's  transport  capacity,  serious \nconstraints and bottlenecks remain, especially in the road sector. Between 1990 and 2000, when \neconomic  growth  averaged  10.2%  per  annum,  road  traffic  grew  at  9.7%  per  annum  for \npassenger traffic, reaching 660 billion passenger-kilometer (km) and 5.9% per annum for freight, \nreaching 597 billion ton-km. Road traffic accounts for 54.2% of total passenger traffic and 13.7% \nof total freight traffic (Supplementary Appendix A). The movement of goods and passengers will \nincreasingly be by road, as road transport is more flexible and responsive to needs in a market \neconomy than other modes. In addition, car ownership is growing, and an increasing proportion \nof passengers are traveling by road. \n \nThe road network grew from 1.16 million km in 1995 to 1.68 million km in 2001 equivalent \n3. \nto an annual increase of 86,700 km. Of this, the expressway length increased from 2,141 km to \n19,437 km during the same period. 2 But the road network is still underdeveloped in both quality \nand extent. High standard roads, i.e., above class II, account for only about 13% of the total road \nnetwork, and the remaining 87% (class III road and below) are medium- to low-grade paved roads \nand  gravel  roads.  With  only  1,100  km  of  roads  per  million  inhabitants,  the  density  of  the  PRC's \nroad network is low.3 Road density relative to the area increased from 12.1 km per 100 square km \n(km2) in 1995 to 14.6 km per 100 km2 in 2000. Of the 92,000 km of roads in Sichuan Province in \n2001, 1,152 km were expressways. Roads are generally of low standard. The 78% in class IV or \nlower  in  Sichuan  is  a  higher  share  of  low-quality  roads  than  that  for  the  PRC  as  a  whole. \nSichuan  has  about  1,091  km  of  classified  roads  per  million  inhabitants,  slightly  below  the \nnational average. \n \nThe  significant  road  sector  development  during  the  9th  Five-Year  Plan  (FYP)  (1996\u2013\n4. \n2000)  reflected  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  stimulate  the  economy  through  public \ninvestment in the road sector. Because of the need to remove transport bottlenecks to facilitate \nefficient,  sustained  economic  growth  and  reduce  poverty,  the  Government  implemented  a  large \ninvestment  program  in  the  road  sector  during  this  period,  totaling  CNY924  billion,  or  CNY185 \nbillion  per  year,  up  from  CNY242  billion,  or  CNY48  billion  per  year,  during  the  8th  FYP  (1991\u2013\n1995). The road sector investment grew at an average annual rate of 16% during this period. The \nGovernment will have difficulty sustaining this level of investment even with official development \nassistance. An increasing proportion of financing will have to come from private sector sources. A \nroad  sector  analysis  is  included  in  Appendix  2.  The  road  sector  revenue  and  expenditures  in \nSichuan Province is given in Supplementary Appendix B. \n\n                                                 \n1  This  report  was  prepared  by  the  project  team,  comprising  M.  Ojiro,  Principal  Project  Economist/Project  Team \nLeader; L. Blanchetti-Revelli, Resettlement Specialist; K. Emzita, Counsel; Y. L. Feng, Sr. Environment Specialist; \nT.

Tas-Anvaripour, Financial Management Specialist. \n\n2  The PRC\u2019s expressway length is second in the world after the United States. \n3  Comparative figures for km of road per million inhabitants in other geographically large countries are about 25,300 \n\nkm for the United States and 1,800 km for India. \n\n\f 2 \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nB. \n \n5. \nSichuan  Province  is  a  poor  interior  area  in  western  PRC.  In  2001  the  per  capita  gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP)  of  the  province  was  about  two  thirds  of  the  national  average.  The  key \nproblem in Sichuan Province is poverty: the per capita GDP was CNY5,118 in 2001, or 68% of \nthe  national  average.  The  per  capita  rural  income  was  CNY1,987,  or  84%  of  the  national \naverage.  About  one  third  of  the  counties  in  Sichuan  are  officially  designated  poor  counties.  In \nthe project area, 197,000 poor project beneficiaries, or 20%, are living below the income levels \nof CNY1,000 in rural areas and CNY3,000 in urban areas. An overview of the poverty reduction \nand the government\u2019s social strategy is given in Appendix 3. One of the reasons for high poverty \nincidence  is  slow  economic  growth,  partly  because  of  inadequate  infrastructure.  Despite  the \nconsiderable  investments,  the  road  network  is  still  inadequate,  and  does  not  provide  efficient \ntransport  access  to  large  parts  of  the  country.  Better  transport  links  are  necessary  to  improve \neconomic  efficiency,  foster  domestic  and  international  trade,  facilitate  interregional  integration, \nand reduce poverty.   \n \nThe traffic volume on the existing roads in the project area has been increasing at about \n6. \n11% per annum in the last few years, reaching 2,350 vehicles per day to 9,700 vehicles per day \ndepending on sections in 2001. The roads are already at capacity in certain sections. If the new \nroad  is  not  constructed,  traffic  will  be  suppressed  and  transport  costs  will  increase.  The \nrestricted traffic movements will slow economic growth of the project area. Based on the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB)-financed technical assistance (TA),4 the forecast traffic volume on the \nexpressway is expected to grow from 6,300 medium truck equivalents (MTEs) in 2008 to 11,900 \nMTEs in 2018, a 6.6% average annual growth rate. It will grow more slowly at 5.6% per annum \nthereafter  to  reach  20,400  MTEs  in  2028  (Appendix  4  and  Supplementary  Appendix  C).  The \nprojected volumes justify the construction of an expressway. \n \n7. \nThe impact of transport infrastructure investments on poverty reduction is demonstrated \nby recent studies using an econometric model, which examined the effectiveness of government \nexpenditure in various sectors in contributing to growth and poverty reduction in the PRC and \nIndonesia. 5  The  studies  concluded  that  investments  in  road  infrastructure  have  the  largest \nimpact on poverty reduction, productivity, and growth. The importance of road infrastructure in \nimproving quality of life is highlighted in the ADB-financed Rural Asia Study.6 The link between \ntransport  development  and  poverty  reduction  is  also  supported  by  studies  and  evaluation  of \nseveral completed transport projects, financed by ADB7 and the World Bank.8 A regional TA9 is \nbeing implemented to examine the poverty reduction impact of infrastructure projects. \n \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2000.

In Liaoning Province and \nYunnan  Province,  construction  of  expressways  complemented  by  local  road  upgrading  was  associated  with  a \nsignificant increase in rural incomes in the project area.  \n\n8  Hajj, Hatim, and Pendakure, V.

According to \nthe  ADB  surveys 10  infrastructure  constraints  are  among  the  impediments  faced  by  private \ncompanies  operating  in  the  PRC.  Of  756  firms  interviewed,  21%  cited  poor  roads  as  a  major \nconstraint,  which  is  the  second  most  frequently  cited  infrastructure  constraint  after  land  and \nbuildings.  If  private  investment  is  to  be  attracted  to  the  poor  interior  provinces  by  creating  an \nenabling framework, road infrastructure, among other things, needs to be improved.  \n \nThe  Government  adopted  the  long-term  Western  Region  Development  Strategy,  which \n9. \nis the key theme of the 10th FYP (2001\u20132005) to enhance economic development and reduce \npoverty in the western part of the country, where most poor reside. The strategy aims to reduce \ndevelopment  disparities  between  the  western  region  and  the  coastal  region.  The  proposed \nProject will support the strategy by building one of the eight western region routes11 and improve \nthe access of Chengdu and other cities in the poor western region. \n \n10. \nTo  help  the  Government  develop  and  implement  its  road  sector  strategy,  external \nassistance has been provided mainly from ADB, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation \n(JBIC),  and  the  World  Bank  (Appendix  5).  Since  1991,  ADB  has  provided  22  loans  totaling \nnearly $3.6 billion to finance 3,000 km of road development, together with the associated 4,484 \nkm local road network. Local roads have been included in the project scope since 1995 to make \nADB\u2019s interventions in the road sector more pro-poor. ADB\u2019s assistance to the road subsector \nhas  been  effective  and  successful  in  achieving  the  project  objectives.  Among  the  projects \nfinanced  by  ADB,  12  have  been  completed  and  are  open  to  traffic.  The  project  completion \nreports  (PCRs)  prepared  for  7  road  projects  concluded  that  six  projects  were  generally \nsuccessful,12 and  one  was  partly  successful.13 The  project  performance  audit  reports14 for  three \nroad  projects  concluded  that  the  projects  were  either  highly  successful  or  successful.  A \ndevelopment impact study15 of the 1,867 km Beijing-Tongjiang expressway route, for which ADB \nprovided  loans  totaling  $1.2  billion,  showed  that  the  improved  road  network  significantly \ncontributed  to  the  development  of  the  northeastern  part  of  the  PRC.  A  midterm  review  and \nprocurement  review  of  the  ongoing  road  project16 being  implemented  by  the  same  executing \nagency  were  undertaken  in  2001  and  concluded  that  the  project  is  being  implemented \nsatisfactorily  in  principle.  Lessons  learned  from  these  reviews  cover  implementation-related \nmatters, including (i) ADB procurement guidelines and requirements were not always followed; \n\n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2002.

ADB has also provided the road \nsector with 41 TAs totaling $21.5 million. The advisory TAs have supported the development of \nroad  infrastructure  by  addressing  policy  and  institutional  issues,  including  highway  planning, \nroad  safety, 17  human  resource  development, \ntransport  pricing,  commercialization  and \ncorporatization,  and  mobilization  of  nongovernment  financial  resources.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  has \nbeen complemented by the World Bank and JBIC, which have provided about $5.3 billion and \n$990 million to finance road infrastructure investments. ADB's policy dialogue in the road sector \nand identification of projects are coordinated with the World Bank and JBIC. \n \nADB's  operational  strategy18 in  the  PRC\u2019s  road  sector  supports  (i)  construction  of  roads \n11. \nthat connect major growth centers and promote linkages with hinterland economies; (ii) integration \nof the network so that the national trunk highway system is supported by a system of local roads, \nparticularly  those  that  provide  access  to  poor  areas;  (iii)  promotion  of  road  safety  and  vehicle \nemission  reduction;  (iv)  institutional  strengthening  to  increase  the  commercial  orientation  and \nefficiency  of  expressway  organizations;  (v)  improvement  of  highway  planning  and  evaluation \ntechniques; (vi) adoption of appropriate pricing policies to ensure optimum use of road transport \ncapacity;  and  (vii)  use  of  alternative  methods  of  investment  financing,  including  private  sector \nparticipation.  Consistent  with  this  strategy,  the  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  focused  on \nkey  issues,  including  enhancing  poverty  impact  and  monitoring  of  road  projects,  improving  road \nsafety, reducing vehicle emissions, strengthening corporate governance, facilitating private sector \ndevelopment. These constitute special features of the Project (paras. 15\u201322) and are detailed in \nAppendix 2.  \n \n12. \nDuring the 2002 Country Programming Mission, the Government reconfirmed its request \nfor assistance for the Project. A feasibility study19 and a resettlement plan were prepared by the \nSichuan  Highway  Design  Institute.  The  Highway  Research  Institute  of  the  Ministry  of \nCommunications  undertook  an  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA). 20 ADB  provided  TA \n(footnote 4) to supplement the Government studies. Fact-finding for the Project was undertaken \nfrom  22  November  to  5  December  2001  and  appraisal  from  12  to  22  March  2002.  Loan \nnegotiations with authorized representatives of the Government were conducted in Manila from \n5  to  7  August  2002.  The  Project  was  formulated  based  on  the  findings  of  the  ADB  missions, \ninformation  provided  by  the  Government,  beneficiary  consultations,  discussions  with  other \nfunding agencies, and recommendations of the feasibility study and TA consultants. The Project \nis consistent with ADB\u2019s country operational strategy.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n17 In  January  2001,  ADB\u2019s  Operations  Evaluation  Department  completed  a  performance  audit  report  on  traffic  safety \n\nTAs.

The Project will (i) alleviate \ncongestion  and  reduce  traffic  accidents  and  vehicle  operating  costs;  (ii)  improve  access \nbetween  Chengdu  and  Kunming,  two  major  centers  in  western  PRC;  (iii)  provide  additional \ntransport capacity to accommodate traffic growth due to economic growth and the shift to more \nflexible  road  based  transportation;  and  (iv)  provide  improved  access  for  the  poor  rural \npopulation  in  the  transport  corridor.    The  Project  will  also  support  reforms  relating  to  poverty \nreduction, road safety and vehicle emissions, and corporate governance. \n \nB. \n \nThe  Project  comprises  the  following:  (i)  construction  of  a  160  km,  four-lane  access-\n14. \ncontrolled  toll  expressway  from  Xichang  to  Panzhihua,  including  access  roads,  interchanges \nwith  toll  stations,  tunnels,  bridges,  administrative  stations,  and  service  areas;  (ii)  upgrading  of \n558 km of county and township roads to improve access to poor and minority areas (Map 2); (iii) \ntoll  collection,  surveillance  and \nroad  maintenance, \nprocurement  of  equipment \ncommunications,  vehicle  weigh  stations,  road  safety,  and  office  administration;  (iv)  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement;  and  (v)  consulting  services  for  construction  supervision,  safety \naudits,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  capacity  building.  The  key  inputs  needed  to  implement \nthe  Project  include  civil  works,  consultants,  equipment,  and  staff  of  the  Sichuan  Provincial \nCommunications  Department  (SPCD)  and  the  Sichuan  Panxi  Expressway  Company  Limited \n(SPECL).  \n \nC. \n \n\nSpecial Features \n\nfor \n\n1. \n\nTargeting Poor Beneficiaries \n\n \n15. \nADB  and  the  Government  have  had  extensive  discussions  on  how  to  enhance  the \npoverty  reduction  impact  of  road  investments.  The  policy  dialogue  focused  on  three  main \nissues.  First,  the  location  of  ADB-financed  road  sector  projects  has  shifted  from  the  northeast \nand  coastal  areas  to  the  poorer  central  and  southwest  regions.  This  shift  to  poorer  interior \nprovinces  is  in  line  with  the  10th  FYP.  Second,  the  dialogue  focused  on  the  inclusion  of  local \nroads under ADB-financed road projects. Since 1995, the scope of ADB-financed road projects21 \nhas  included  improvements  to  local  roads  connecting  to  the  expressway  interchanges  to \nfacilitate  access  of  rural  communities  to  county  centers  and  to  the  expressway  facilities.  The \nscope of the Project includes upgrading 558 km of local roads that will connect poor areas to the \nexpressway interchanges. This local road component was added to the project scope at ADB\u2019s \ninitiative  and  was  formulated  by  prioritizing  road  sections  that  serve  areas  where  most  poor \npeople  live  and  where  the  most  beneficial  impact  can  be  made  on  poverty  reduction.  Third, \n\n                                                 \n21 Chengdu-Nanchong  Expressway  Project,  Chongqing-Guizhou  Roads  Development  Projects \n\n(Leichong \nExpressway/Chongzun  Expressway),  Guangxi  Roads  Development  Project,  Hebei  Expressway  Project,  Hebei \nRoads  Development  Project,  Jiangxi  Expressway  Project,  Liaoning  Expressway  Project,  Shaanxi  Roads \nDevelopment  Project,  Shanxi  Road  Development  Project,  Shenyang-Jinzhou  Expressway  Project,  and  Southern \nYunnan Road Development Project. The local road components of these projects are being implemented or have \nbeen completed successfully, helping improve living conditions of the poor people in the project area. \n\n\f 6 \n\nADB\u2019s agenda for policy dialogue included maximizing employment of poor people during road \nconstruction.  Specific  measures  have  been  formulated  in  the  Project  to  support  these \nobjectives. \n \nThe project area is very diverse in terms of climate, topography, ecology, economy, and \n16. \nsocial  structure.  The  project  area  covers  poor  counties  of  Dechang,  Miyi,  and  Yanbian;  small \nparts  of  Huili,  Renhe,  and  Xichang  counties,  and  the  urban  district  of  Panzhihua.  The  total \npopulation  living  in  the  project  area  is  1.2  million,  of  which  about  1.0  million  are  project \nbeneficiaries. About 137,000 rural residents, or about 34% of rural beneficiaries (406,000), have \nannual  incomes  of  less  than  CNY1,000  while  60,000  urban  residents,  or  about  11%  of  urban \nbeneficiaries (563,000), have annual incomes of less than CNY3,000.  \n \nThe local road component directly targeting poor and minority villages in the mountains \n17. \nwill  be  implemented  in  parallel  with  the  construction  of  the  expressway.    While  the  poor \nthemselves may not directly use the expressway, they will make use of the local roads to sell \ntheir  produce  to  others  who  will  use  the  expressway  to  transport  the  goods  to  markets  in \nPanzhihua,  Xichang,  and  beyond,  or  to  supply  agricultural  inputs  inputs,  such  as  fertilizer, \npesticides,  and  seeds.  The  poor  could  pool  resources  in  the  future  to  purchase  vehicles  that \ncould use the expressway to access major markets. \n \nTo  ensure  that  the  project  benefits  accrue  to  poor  people  as  intended,  a  set  of \n18. \nmonitorable poverty impact indicators was developed in consultation with the SPCD based on \nfindings  of  ongoing  TA,  which  supports  the  rural  poverty  reduction  projects  in  the  PRC.  The \nmain indicators will include poverty incidence, rural incomes, production of grain crops, housing \nconditions,  productive  assets,  access  to  markets,  access  to  basic  infrastructure,  access  to \nhealth and education services, and off-farm economic activities. Baseline indicators and targets \nwill  be  worked  out  at  the  beginning  of  project  implementation.  The  poverty  monitoring  will  be \ncarried  out  as  part  of  the  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  (para.  40  and \nSupplementary Appendix D) with the support of 26 person-months of consulting assistance. A \nTA,  Socioeconomic  Assessment  of  Road  Projects,  which  is  under  processing,  will  strengthen \npoverty monitoring by providing advice and assistance to SPCD.    \n \n \n \n19. \nRoad safety is a serious issue in the PRC and in Sichuan province. The 2001 accident \nstatistics for the PRC were 755,000 accidents, 106,000 fatalities, and 536,000 injuries. Sichuan \nProvince  had  39,090  reported  accidents,  5,727  fatalities,  and  31,972  injuries.  To  address  this \nissue,  the  Ministry  of  Public  Security  has  prepared  the  2002  Road  Safety  Action  Plan,  which \naims  to  (i)  reduce  serious  accidents,  involving  more  than  10  fatalities,  by  10%  compared  with \n2001; and (ii) eliminate major accidents, involving 30 or more fatalities.22 This would be achieved \nthrough  improved  safety  of  vehicles,  driver  training,  and  improved  traffic  management.  In \nSichuan,  the  Road  Safety  Council  was  established  to  investigate  road  accidents,  and  prepare \ncodes and standards for accident prevention. To enforce traffic regulations for a completed 70 \nkm  section  adjoining  the  project  expressway,  a  highway  patrol  team  was  organized  by  the \nPublic  Security  Bureau.  It  will  be  expanded  to  work  on  the  project  expressway.  To  strengthen \nthe  capacity  of  the  Road  Safety  Council  and  the  highway  patrol  team,  assistance  will  be \nprovided  to  the  public  security  bureau  under  the  international  consulting  services  through  in-\ncountry training for concerned staff. Assistance will also be provided, in light of the findings of \n\nRoad Safety and Vehicle Emissions \n\n2. \n\n                                                 \n22 In 2000, 39 accidents involved 10 or more fatalities and 4 accidents involved 30 or more fatalities. \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nthe ongoing ADB TA23 on road safety, to review and improve (i) provincial road safety guidelines \nfor the interdepartmental road safety initiatives; and (ii) road safety action plans for Liangshan \nand Panzhihua prior to opening of the project expressway (Appendix 6). \n \n20.  With a rapid increase in vehicle ownership, vehicle emissions have also become a serious \nissue  in  the  PRC.  Vehicle  emissions  will  have  an  adverse  impact  on  the  environment  if  no \nmitigation measures are taken. Fragmented responsibility, lack of interdepartmental coordination, \nand an inadequate database and monitoring system prevent the formulation of specific targets for \na  reduction  in  vehicle  emissions.  Sichuan  Province  has  an  annual  program  for  testing  vehicle \nemissions. Road-side testing is carried out in Panzhihua city where the project alignment passes. \nTo  address  the  motor  vehicle  emissions  issue,  international  consultants  will  provide  training  to \nstaff  of  the  environmental  protection  bureau  involved  with  vehicle  emissions  inspection  and \ntesting.  Assistance  will  also  be  provided,  in  light  of  the  findings  of  the  recently  completed  ADB \nTA24 on  vehicle  emissions,  to  review  and  improve  (i)  general  provincial  guidelines  for  vehicle \nemissions reduction, and (ii) action plans for Liangshan and Panzhihua prior to opening of the \nproject expressway (Appendix 6). \n\n \n3. \n\nCorporate Governance \n\n \n21. \nAn expressway company, SPECL, was established in September 1998 as a joint stock, \nlimited liability company to construct and operate expressway sections, including the proposed \nproject expressway. However, it still operates as an implementing department of SPCD, rather \nthan  as  an  autonomous  corporate  entity.  SPECL\u2019s  initial  objective  is  to  build  the  project \nexpressway  as  efficiently  and  cost  effectively  as  possible.  Its  management  team  and  staff  will \nprimarily  be  involved  in  project  construction  management.  The  company  must  have  the \nprofessional  resources  and  experience,  and  the  management,  accounting,  and  reporting \nsystems  required  for  the  efficient  and  safe  operation  of  its  existing  and  future  expressways. \nSPECL needs to be managed independently by its board, reporting its financial performance to \nits  shareholders.  SPECL  should  develop  its  management,  corporate,  and  financial  reporting \nprocedures \nthe \nrequirements of private investors. SPECL\u2019s ultimate objective should be to operate as a private \ncommercial road management company. SPCD and SPECL agreed to enter into a concession \nframework  agreement  (Supplementary  Appendix  E)  by  30  June  2004,  which  will  ensure \nautonomy  of  operations,  encourage  the  establishment  of  road  facility  performance  indicators, \nand facilitate future refinancing of road sector assets. SPCD and SPECL agreed to implement \nthe  corporate  development  plan  (Supplementary  Appendix  F)  by  31  December  2004  to \ndemonstrate  that  the  standard  of  its  corporate  governance,  management  procedures,  and \nfinancial reporting satisfies the requirements of international investors. \n \n\nin  compliance  with  government  and \n\ninternational  practices \n\nto  satisfy \n\n \n4. \n\nPrivate Sector Development \n\n \n22. \nIn  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Development  Strategy,  consideration  was  given  to \nalternative approaches to highway financing  recommended  under  a  recently  completed  ADB  \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n23 ADB. 1999.

Capacity to attract nongovernment \nfinancing, particularly equity capital, for road projects such as the project expressway with low \ninitial  demand  and  low  financial  returns,  but  with  high  long-term  economic  returns,  is  limited.  \nTherefore,  the  construction  of  the  Project  will  be  financed  from  public  sources  with  funds \nmodified from a variety of sources including national financial bonds, development banks, public \nequity contributions, and ADB. Nevertheless, establishing a sound administrative structure using \nmodern  business  principles  at  the  outset  may  make  it  possible  for  the  operator  to  secure \nnongovernment  financing  at  a  later  stage,  depending  on  traffic  buildup  and  financial \nperformance. Nongovernment financing options will be examined before operations start. ADB \nwill favorably consider such refinancing for the Project, provided that advance notice is received \nand  the  proposal  meets  ADB\u2019s  standards  of  good  governance,  transparency,  and  project \nviability.  An  overview  of  private  sector  involvement  in  the  PRC  road  sector  is  given  in \nSupplementary Appendix G.  \n \n \n \n23. \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  environment  category  A.  The  EIA  concluded  that  no  major \nadverse environmental impacts will result provided the recommended mitigation measures27 are \nimplemented.  The  TA  consultants  (footnote  4)  and  field  visits  by  ADB  staff  confirmed  the  EIA \nconclusion.  The  summary  EIA28 for  the  Project  was  uploaded  on  ADB\u2019s  web  site  on  5  March \n2002.  In  addition  to  following  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Guidelines  for  Selected  Infrastructure \nDevelopment  Projects,  all  applicable  PRC  laws  and  regulations  will  be  complied  with  during \nimplementation  and  operation.  To  ensure  that  potential  adverse  environmental  impacts  of \nproject  construction  and  operation  are  minimized,  the  environmental  monitoring  program  and \nmitigation measures, as specified in the EIA, will be implemented. \n\nEnvironmental Assessment \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement Plan \n\n \n24. \nThe  land  acquisition  for  the  construction  of  the  project  expressway  will  result  in  some \nloss of land, houses, and other assets. A resettlement plan was prepared for the affected people \nbased on the 1998 Land Administration Law29 and provincial guidelines. It was reviewed by the \nTA consultants and the Mission and confirmed by the detailed measurement survey based on \nthe detail design alignment in accordance with ADB\u2019s requirements for involuntary resettlement. \nAbout  11,000  people  (2,400  households)  will  be  affected.  Among  these,  6,040  people  (1,290 \nhouseholds)  will  be  affected  by  either  house  or  building  losses  and  will  be  relocated.  Those \nlosing land will be compensated through their economic collectives, according to the 1998 Land \nAdministration  Law  and  the  provincial  guidelines.  The  Project  will  permanently  acquire  about \n825  hectares  (ha),  plus  about  117  ha  of  temporarily  borrowed  land  for  construction  purposes. \n\n                                                 \n25 ADB. 1997.

Under the \ntwo projects, the expressways' future toll revenue was securitized through an initial public offering in August 1999 \nand January 1999. \n\n27 They  include  (i)  countermeasures  to  reduce  noise  for  the  residents  near  the  alignment;  (ii)  preventive  measures \nsuch as planting of trees and grasses, and construction of side ditches, torrent chutes, slope walls, and retaining \nwalls  to  prevent  soil  erosion;  and  (iii)  measures  to  prevent  adverse  impacts  at  borrow  and  spoil  sites  through \ncontracts  containing  environmental  covenants  and  by  supervising  consultants  during  implementation.  During \nexpressway operation, SPECL will help monitor vehicle emissions on the expressway in cooperation with the local \nenvironmental protection bureau, traffic police, and other related organizations. \n\n28 Available: http://www.adb.org/Documents/Environment/PRC/roads_devt.pdf \n29 The law was drafted with assistance provided under ADB. 1996.

If any resettlement effects \nare  associated  with  the  local  roads,  the  same  resettlement  policy  will  apply.  The  resettlement \nplan meets ADB\u2019s requirements for involuntary resettlement. \n \n25. \nSPCD  will  fund  the  resettlement  costs  according  to  the  standards  set  out  in  the \nresettlement  plan  in  accordance  with  the  government  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \nresettlement.  Compensation  will  be  paid  for  housing,  and  new  housing  will  be  made  available \nbefore relocation takes place. In line with the relevant law, the resettlement information booklet \nwas  released  to  affected  people  through  county  and  township  offices  and  local  media  on  6 \nFebruary 2002, and the summary resettlement plan30 (Appendix 7) was disclosed to the public \nthrough ADB\u2019s web site on 5 March 2002. The full resettlement plan31 (Supplementary Appendix \nH)  was  also  posted  on  ADB\u2019s  web  site  on  8  May  2002.  The  resettlement  booklet  contains \nresettlement  impacts,  the  resettlement  policy,  compensation  rates  and  policies,  organizational \narrangements,  consultation  and  participation,  and  grievance  procedures.  SPCD  will  be \nresponsible for internally monitoring the resettlement implementation and for submitting reports \nto  ADB.  A  regular  reporting  system  was  established  to  ensure  key  resettlement  activities  are \nimplemented on time. SPCD will engage a local institute to carry out independent monitoring of \nthe resettlement implementation. Further surveys will be done on completion of the resettlement \nand 1 year later, and the findings reported to SPCD and ADB. \n \n \n \nStakeholder  participation  and  consultations  have  been  an  important  element  in  the \n26. \ndevelopment and design of the Project. They have involved over 900 people, since beginning in \nMarch  1997  (i)  during  the  preparation  of  the  feasibility  study,  EIA,  and  resettlement  plan;  (ii)  to \ninform the people affected about the project objectives and to understand their priorities, needs, \nand concerns; (iii) to dialogue with the county and township representatives in the project area to \nensure  that  local  concerns  are  adequately  addressed  in  the  project  design;  and  (iv)  through \ndiscussions with NGOs. A number of surveys, consultations, and discussions were held with the \nminority  population  of  the  project  area.  These  surveys  and  discussions  provided  much  of  the \nquantitative  and  qualitative  information,  which  has  been  used  as  the  basis  for  identifying  the \npotential  project  impacts  and  assessing  their  significance.  Surveys  in  communities  served  by \nthese roads revealed a high degree of support for the Project (Appendix 8).  \n \nD. \n \n27. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $1,019  million  equivalent,  with  a  foreign \nexchange cost of $464 million (46%) and a local currency cost of $555 million (54%) equivalent \nas shown in Table 1 and detailed in Appendix 9. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCost Estimates \n\n                                                 \n30 This is included in the summary EIA (on-line) (footnote 28). \n31 Available: http://www.adb.org/Documents/Resettlement_Plans/southern_sichuan_roads.pdf \n\n\f 10 \n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n \n\n \nItem \nA.

The remaining foreign exchange cost of $164 million will be financed by \nthe  Sichuan  Provincial  Government  (SPG).  The  local  currency  cost  will  be  financed  by  SPG, \nMinistry of Communications, and cofinancing through a loan from the China Development Bank. \nThe  China  Development  Bank  loan,  which  is  already  effective,  is  repayable  over  18  years, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  and  at  a  variable  lending  rate,  currently  at  5.76%  per \nannum.  \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nThe ADB loan proceeds will be made available to Sichuan Province, which will onlend to \n30. \nSPECL with the same financial terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. SPECL will bear \nthe interest rate variation and foreign exchange risks. \n \nF. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \nSPCD  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  responsible  for  overall  implementation  of  the \n31. \nProject. Part of SPCD was corporatized to form SPECL to be the Implementing Agency for the \nproject expressway. SPECL has a board of directors and will have sufficient technical, financial, \nand  administrative  staff  (Supplementary  Appendix  I).  Most  of  the  staff  have  experience  in \nimplementing  internationally  financed  road  projects.  Sichuan  Province  will  implement  the  local \nroad  component  through  local  governments.  The  project  director,  general  manager  of  the \nSPECL,  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project  management,  approval  of  contracts,  and \npayments.  A  project  implementation  unit  established  within  SPECL  will  monitor  and  follow  up \nfor  physical \nimplementation.  The  unit \nimplementation  activities  on  a  day-to-day  basis  and  the  preparation  of  progress  reports.  The \nproject  manager  is  assisted  by  a  team  of  qualified  engineering,  financial,  and  administrative \nstaff.  SPECL  has  sufficient  technical  capability  to  handle  the  Project  as  their  engineers  have \nexperience  in  implementing  internationally  financed  road  projects.  However,  its  institutional \ncapacity  needs  to  be  developed.  Assistance  will  be  provided  under  the  consulting  services  in \nthis  respect.  A  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  committee  was  established  under  SPG  to \nensure  the  appropriate  agencies  and  authorities  coordinate  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nactivities. \n\nis  headed  by  a  project  manager  responsible \n\n2.   \n\nPeriod of Implementation \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \nThe Project will be implemented over about 5 years from December 2002 to September \n32. \n2007  (Appendix  10).  The  local  road  component  will  be  implemented  concurrently  with \nexpressway construction. \n \n \n \n33. \nAll  ADB-financed  procurement  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.    The  civil \nworks  for  the  expressway  will  be  divided  into  19  packages  to  be  procured  under  international \ncompetitive bidding procedures. Equipment will be divided into 8 packages and procured under \ninternational  competitive  bidding  or  international  shopping.  Ancillary  facilities  including  the \nadministration  building  and  service  areas  under  domestic  financing  will  be  procured  in  16 \npackages  using  local  competitive  bidding.  Procurement  for  the  local  roads  under  government \nfinancing  will  follow  Government  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  (Appendix  11).  International \nbidding will be handled by the China International Tendering Company, selected by SPECL on a \ncompetitive  basis.  It  is  well  qualified  to  perform  these  tasks  and  has  previous  experience  in \nother externally funded projects. Prequalified contractors with adequate technical and financial \ncapacities will be allowed to bid for several packages and, if successful, may be awarded more \nthan one contract based on least-cost combination of contracts. SPECL has agreed to include \nthe  relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  in  all  documents  and  contracts  during \nbidding for and implementation of the Project. \n\n \n\n\f 12 \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nConstruction  supervision  activities, \n\n \n34. \ninvolving  4,350  person-months  of  consulting \nservices, will be undertaken by domestic consulting teams under government financing, headed \nby a chief supervision engineer. SPCD will use the regulations and guidelines prepared under \nan ADB TA32 for selecting and engaging consultants. Each contract package will be supervised \nby a site resident engineer assisted by a deputy resident engineer and supported by technical \nand  administrative  personnel.  The  site  resident  engineer  will  report  to  the  chief  resident \nengineer. The chief supervision engineer will report to the project manager of SPECL. \n \n35. \nThe Project will provide 64 person-months of international consulting services to (i) help \nwith  project  management  during  the  construction  period;  (ii)  provide  expertise  in  tunnel  and \nbridge  construction;  (iii)  conduct  a  safety  audit  of  the  project  design,  and  make  safety \nrecommendations on the completed construction works; (iv) help set up and implement quality \ncontrol procedures; (v) help develop capacity in road safety and vehicle emissions, and improve \nguidelines  and  action  plans  in  this  regard;  (vi)  prepare  a  procedural  manual  for  good \nmanagement of SPECL; (vii) assist in formulating a human resource development and training \nprogram;  and  (viii)  help  establish  and  implement  a  project  performance  management  system, \nincluding  assessing  the  impact  on  poverty  reduction  (Supplementary  Appendix  J).  The  team \nleader  will  be  in  the  field  during  the  entire  construction  period  and  will  act  as  assistant  chief \nsupervision engineer: helping the chief supervision engineer certify variation orders, contractor \npayments,  and  subcontracting  documents,  and  establishing  a  contracts  management  system. \nAll consultants to be financed under the ADB loan will be selected and engaged based on the \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants.  Domestic  consultants  experienced  in  implementing  similar  road  projects  will  be \nfinanced  by  SPECL,  and  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  government  procedures \nacceptable to ADB. \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Action  \n\n \n36. \nBecause of the high priority accorded to the Project and the need to commence works in \nDecember  2002,  on  7  March  2002  ADB  approved  advance  procurement  action  for  civil  works \nand  advance  recruitment  action  for  international  consultants. 33  Advance  actions  up  to  the \nevaluation  of  bids  and  proposals,  but  not  including  award  of  contracts,  covers  (i)  the \nprequalification of contractors, bidding, and bid evaluation for the civil works contract packages; \nand  (ii)  recruitment  of  international  consultants  to  help  implement  the  Project.    The  advance \nactions  are  being  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  and \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  The  Government  and  SPCD  have  been  advised  that \napproval of the advance actions does not commit ADB to financing the Project. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n37. \nAll disbursements under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with the ADB\u2019s \nLoan  Disbursement  Handbook.  The  disbursement  procedures  will  include  (i)  a  direct  payment \nprocedure, (ii) a commitment procedure, or (iii) a reimbursement procedure. \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n32 ADB. 1998. TA to the PRC for Regulatory Framework for the Engagement of Consultants. Manila. \n33 The advance action was reported in the April 2002 edition of ADB Business Opportunities. \n\n\f \n\n13\n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n38. \nSPECL  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  Project,  and  have  such  accounts  and \nrelated  financial  statements  (balance  sheet,  income  statements,  and  cash-flow  statements) \naudited annually in accordance with national auditing standards consistently applied by external \nauditors  whose  qualifications,  experience,  and  terms  of  reference  are  acceptable  to  the \nGovernment  and  ADB.  In  addition,  it  will  submit  to  ADB  within  9  months  of  the  end  of  each \nrelated  fiscal  year,  certified  copies  of  such  audited  project  accounts  and  financial  statements, \nand the report of the auditors of the Project as acceptable to ADB, all in the English language. \nSPECL  will  follow  the  audit  report  formats  adopted  for  all  ADB-financed  projects  in  the  PRC. \nThe formats provide an example of the auditor's certificate in accordance with the Government \nrequirement as well as a model auditor's report to ensure compliance with the Loan Agreement \nand  internal  control  on  financial  reporting.  To  ensure  that  internal  controls  and  checks  on  the \nexpressway construction costs and operations are effective, SPECL has established, at ADB\u2019s \nsuggestion,  an  internal  audit  unit  and  will  maintain  it  during  project  implementation  and \noperation.  The  unit  will  undertake  independent  tests  on  day-to-day  transactions,  prior  to \nreference to external auditors. \n \n39. \nSPECL  will  make  satisfactory  arrangements  for  reporting  the  progress  of  project \nimplementation  by  submitting  quarterly  progress  reports  and  brief  monthly  updates.    Within  3 \nmonths of completion, SPECL will submit a project completion report to ADB. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \nA set of indicators for evaluating project performance in relation to its goals, purposes, \n40. \noutputs, and conditions was discussed and agreed upon with SPECL (Supplementary Appendix \nD).  The  indicators  will  be  reviewed  at  the  start  of  project  implementation  and  will  include  (i) \neconomic  development  and  poverty  indicators  for  Sichuan  Province  and  the  project  area,  (ii) \ntransport  costs  and  time  for  specific  types  of  vehicles  and  trips,  (iii)  transport  services  and \ntransport  charges,  (iv)  accident  rates,  (v)  financial  sustainability,  (vi)  county  and  township \nincomes  per  capita,  (vii)  access  to  social  services,  and  (viii)  jobs  created  in  construction  and \nmaintenance.  Employment  impact  indicators  will  include  information  about  unskilled  laborers, \npoor  laborers,  and  women  laborers,  and  will  be  monitored  through  an  annual  report.  At  the \nbeginning  of  project  implementation,  SPECL  will  establish  baseline  and  target  values  for  the \nindicators.  The  indicators  will  be  measured  at  project  completion  and  3  years  later,  and \ncompared  with  the  baseline.  Where  relevant,  indicators  will  be  disaggregated  by  gender. \nSPECL  will  recruit  a  qualified  consultant  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  to  help  establish  the \nmonitoring and evaluation system, and train the staff of SPECL and implementing agencies in \nits use. The main sources of data used include (i) a review of secondary data from government \nsources,  (ii)  a  household  socioeconomic  sample  survey,  and  (iii)  participatory  rural  appraisal \nwith the help of nongovernment organizations in communities affected by the expressway and \nlocal roads. A report summarizing the key findings of monitoring at inception, completion, and 3 \nyears later will be submitted to ADB. \n\n \n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n41. \nIn  2005,  ADB,  SPCD,  and  SPECL  will  carry  out  a  midterm  review  of  the  Project, \ncovering all institutional, administrative, organizational, technical, environmental, social, poverty \nreduction,  economic,  financial,  and  other  relevant  aspects  that  may  have  an  impact  on  the \nperformance  of  the  Project  and  its  continuing  viability.    The  review  will  examine  progress  in \n\n\f 14 \n\n10. \n\nAnticorruption Measures \n\nsector reforms, policy development, progress in resettlement, and compliance with assurances \nin the loan agreement. \n \n \n \n42. \nDuring project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to central and local \ngovernment officials. Attention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption that was added \nto ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. ADB's program \nfor the PRC includes assistance that will improve governance and provide incentives to reduce \nthe incidence of corruption in the longer term. \n \n43. \nBased  on  SPCD\u2019s  experience  in  fighting  corruption,  the  following  actions  have  been \ntaken to prevent corruption: (i) a leading group of officials from the Provincial Discipline Unit and \nSupervision  Department  will  be  resident  in  project  offices  for  bidding,  construction,  and \noperations; (ii) a supervisory \"watchdog\" body has been established to prevent interference in \nthe processes; (iii) a two-contract system has been established where the winner of a civil works \ncontract  must  also  sign  an  anticorruption  contract  with  the  employer;  (iv)    liaison  meetings \nbetween  SPCD  and  the  Provincial  Prosecutor's  Office  are  held  on  a  regular  basis  where \nwarnings about or information on corrupt practices can be discussed; and (v) midyear and end-\nof-year  inspections  of  contractors  have  been  instituted  to  ensure  procedures  related  to  fund \nwithdrawals and settlements are being followed. \n \n\n11. \n\nCapacity Building and Human Resource Development \n\n \nTo cope with its increased expressway construction and management activities, SPECL \n44. \nneeds  to  develop  a  corporate  strategy  and  outline  its  managerial,  staffing,  and  investment \nrequirements.  A  human  resource  development  plan  will  be  drawn  up  with  the  help  of  the \ninternational  and  domestic  consultants.  The  plan  will  consider  the  needs,  and  the  recruitment \nand  training  requirements  identified.  One  element  of  the  plan  will  be  an  international  training \nprogram financed under the loan. It will cover expressway operations, commercial development \nof  expressways  and  business  planning,  expressway  maintenance,  road  safety,  vehicle \nemissions,  project  management,  highway  development  planning,  monitoring  and  evaluation, \nenvironmental  management,  bridge  and  tunnel  design,  traffic  engineering,  toll  management, \nand  pavement  design.  SPECL  staff  will  undertake  about  60  person-months  of  international \ntraining.  With  the  assistance  of  the  consultants,  SPECL  will  prepare  for  ADB's  concurrence  a \nprogram of training activities, their location, and a list of candidates. Findings from the training \nwill be disseminated in Sichuan Province through an appropriate institute. \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nEconomic Benefits and Distribution Analysis \n\n \nThe  project  benefits  and  impacts  were  assessed  along  with  the  potential  risks \n45. \nassociated with the Project. The integrated benefits and impacts will outweigh the costs and the \nProject will bring net benefits in the project area. \n \nA. \n \n46. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated by comparing the with- and \nwithout-project  situations.  Without  the  Project,  the  traffic  volume  would  exceed  the  capacity  of \nthe  existing  national  highway  108,  which  would  become  congested,  increasing  travel  time, \nvehicle  operating  costs  (VOCs),  and  the  number  of  accidents.  With  the  Project,  travel  time  on \nthe road will be reduced because of higher speeds and shorter distance; VOCs will be reduced \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nbecause of faster and smoother travel on the expressway; and the accident rate will be reduced \nby  eliminating  congestion,  providing  safety  features,  and  separating  fast-  and  slow-moving \ntraffic.  Similar  benefits  also  accrue  to  the  traffic  on  the  existing  road.  If  local  roads  are  not \nupgraded, people in the remote parts of the project area will have less mobility and the mainly \npoor inhabitants will not be able to participate in the mainstream of economic activity.  \n \n47. \nThe  economic  costs  of  the  expressway  reflect  the  resource  costs  for  construction, \noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  and  the  value  of  agricultural  production  from  land  lost \npermanently. The economic benefits generated by the expressway include (i) savings in VOCs \nas  a  result  of  reduced  road  length  and  improved  traffic  conditions,  (ii)  time  savings  for  road \nusers,  (iii)  savings  from  avoided  physical  damage  as  a  result  of  fewer  accidents,  and  (iv) \nbenefits to generated traffic. Environmental benefits will come from avoided vehicular emissions \nas a result of the reduced level of congestion on national highway 108. However, these benefits \nwere  not  included  in  the  economic  analysis  because  an  established  methodology  for  their \nvaluation is not available.  \n \nThe EIRR for the Project, including the expressway and local roads, is 16.2%, indicating \n48. \nthat the Project is economically viable (Appendix 4). Results of sensitivity analysis confirm the \nrobustness  of  the  Project's  economic  viability.  Changes  in  the  key  variables,  such  as  a  10% \nreduction  in  benefits  do  not  significantly  impact  the  economic  viability.  The  capital  cost  would \nhave to increase by 85% over the estimate for the EIRR to fall below the cutoff rate of 12%. The \nbenefit  level  would  have  to  decrease  by  43%  to  achieve  the  same  effect.  In  light  of  previous \nexperience in the PRC's road sector, variations of such magnitude are unlikely. The EIRR was \nalso  calculated  separately  for  the  expressway  and  local  road  components.  The  EIRR  was \n16.1% for the expressway component and 20.3% for the local road component. \n \n49. \nThe economic analysis of the Project was extended to quantify the direct poverty impact \nby examining the distribution of project net benefits by determining the project effects for various \nbeneficiaries,  including  road  users,  local  economy,  labor,  and  government.  The  impact  on  the \npoor was assessed by quantifying the direct benefits that would accrue to poor people under the \nProject.  The  proportion  of  net  benefits  passed  on  to  poor  people,  or  the  poverty  impact  ratio, \nwas  calculated  as  24%  (Appendix  4).  This  ratio  is  higher  than  the  country\u2019s  poverty  incidence \nand the income share of the poor.  \n \nB. \n \nToll  setting  is  the  responsibility  of  the  provincial  government.  Within  Sichuan  Province, \n50. \napplications  to  set  and  adjust  toll  levels  are  proposed  by  expressway  corporations  for \nconsideration  by  SPCD  and  the  provincial  price  bureau  and  approval  by  SPG.  SPECL  will \nundertake a toll analysis before opening the expressway, and each year for 5 years thereafter, to \nconfirm  the  appropriate  level  of  toll,  and  will  submit  the  results  for  ADB\u2019s  concurrence.  ADB \nprovided TA34 to carry out a toll diversion study and the manual has been distributed to provincial \ncommunications  departments.  Findings  from  these  studies  will  help  SPECL  determine  the  toll \nlevels for the Project. \n \n\nFinancial Benefits \n\n                                                 \n34 Toll  Diversion  Model:  Application  Manual  (September  2000)  developed  under  ADB.  1998.  TA  to  the  PRC  for \n\nPreparing the Chongqing-Guizhou Expressway Project. Manila. \n\n\f 16 \n\nThe  proposed  toll  rates35 are  considered  reasonable  to  attract  sufficient  traffic  to  meet \n51. \neconomic  and  financial  rate  of  return  criteria.  The  effects  of  alternative  toll  rates  on  the  EIRR \nand  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  were  assessed.  Reduction  in  the  EIRR  for  the  toll \nrates of up to double the base rate are minor, but beyond this point, a more pronounced impact \nis likely, and the EIRR will be below 12%. At this toll rate, the FIRR rises by about 2 percentage \npoints. Based on these findings, the toll rate could be increased if required to ensure SPECL\u2019s \nfinancial viability. In practice, however, this may be difficult because (i) the proposed toll rates \nare already high compared with other expressways in Sichuan Province, and (ii) social concerns \nare  considered  when  toll  rates  are  determined,  particularly  when  expressways  pass  through \npoor areas. Toll levels will be reviewed annually in relation to operating costs, toll levels on other \ntoll facilities, and affordability. The level and structure of the tolls will be such as to ensure that \nthe expressway\u2019s toll revenue will cover O&M costs, debt servicing, and depreciation in excess \nof  debt  servicing,  and  generate  a  reasonable  rate  of  return  on  the  investment  as  adjusted  for \ninflation from time to time. If an adjustment of the toll levels is required based on this principle, \nSPECL will submit its toll adjustment plans for ADB\u2019s concurrence before finalizing and submitting \nit to SPG for approval. \n \n52. \nThe  financial  performance  of  the  project  expressway  was  forecast,  taking  into  account \nthe  anticipated  traffic,  the  projected  operating  costs,  and  the  proposed  toll  rates.  The  working \nratio is expected to be below 12% over the project life. The debt service coverage ratio of more \nthan 1.2 is achievable from the second year of full operation. The debt-to-equity ratio will remain \nbelow 60:40 throughout the Project\u2019s life. SPECL, as a corporation independent of the provincial \ngovernment, will be financially autonomous. Projections based on currently available information \nand investment plans show that SPECL will be able to generate sufficient income. The financial \ninternal rate of return for the project expressway is 5.5%, which is greater than the real weighted \naverage cost of capital of 4% (Appendix 4). \n \nC. \n \n53. \nThe  root  causes  of  poverty  in  the  project  area  are  the  poor  productive  conditions  and \ndifficult  topography\u2014a  situation  exacerbated  by  general  remoteness  and  inadequate  road \naccess. Although all townships are accessible by vehicle, no mountain township is served by a \npaved road. Roads are mostly rock and earth, narrow, and subject to frequent rock-falls, which \nmake them impassable. Medium-sized trucks are the prime means of road transport. Passenger \nfares are more than double those on good roads. As a consequence, many people walk, for up \nto 7 hours, to get to market, and up to 5 hours to get fuelwood. Horses and donkeys are a vital \nelement  of  the  transportation  system  in  the  mountains  for  heavy  loads.  Because  of  the  poor \nroads  and  high  cost  of  transport,  the  cost  of  construction  materials  and  fertilizer  are  also \nconsiderably higher. In some areas, farmers feed their fruit to pigs as the transport cost makes it \nprohibitive  to  take  the  fruit  to  market.  Poor  access  also  limits  the  ability  of  residents  to  take \nadvantage of increased employment opportunities in the urban areas, and makes it difficult for \nlocal officials and agricultural extension officers to visit the part of the project area suffering most \nfrom poverty. \n \nThe  Project  will  have  a  substantial  beneficial  socioeconomic  impact  on  the  majority  of \n54. \nthe population, urban and rural, living in the project area. An initial poverty and social analysis \n\nImpact on Poverty \n\n                                                 \n35 The opening toll rates per vehicle-km are CNY0.52 for cars, CNY1.00 for light trucks, CNY1.89 for medium-sized \ntrucks, and CNY2.68 for heavy trucks. This will be reviewed every 5 years and adjusted as necessary. These rates \nare  slightly  higher  than  currently  charged  tolls  in  Sichuan  Province  but  are  within  a  range  of  tolls  applicable  for \nsimilar expressways in the region. \n\n\f \n\n17\n\n(Appendix 3) undertaken during TA fact-finding and a full poverty and social analysis carried out \nduring the TA indicate that farmers and urban residents will be the largest beneficiary groups, \nalthough  the  majority  of  the  easily  quantifiable  benefits  will  accrue  to  road  users,  especially \nexpressway  users.    Many  farmers  living  in  townships  located  on  the  local  road  network  will \nincrease their agricultural production through improved access to markets, and lower transport \ncosts for both agricultural produce and agricultural inputs. These farmers will also benefit from \nreduced  travel  time  to  markets  and  for  routine  activities  such  as  water  and  fuelwood,  much \neasier  access  to  emergency  health  care,  and  increased  information  flows  and  access  to  the \noutside  world.  Rural  residents  in  and  on  the  hillsides  overlooking  the  Anning  Valley  will  also \nbenefit indirectly from improved transport conditions on the existing main roads and the impetus \nto  economic  growth  resulting  from  a  better  road  network.  The  construction  of  the  expressway \nwill  provide  significant  benefits,  especially  to  townships  along  the  project  alignment,  through \nemployment  during  construction  and  the  provision  of  services  to  labor  construction  sites. \nInterchanges  will  provide  opportunities  for  trading  and  service  activities.  The  only  adverse \nconsequences are those arising from loss of land or property because of the land acquisition for \nthe  Project.  Any  resulting  adverse  effects  will  be  mitigated  by  compensation  payments  and \nreplacement houses as per the resettlement plan. \n \n55. \nDirect  benefits  accruing  to  the  poor  from  the  local  road  component  will  be  more \nsignificant than those accruing from the expressway component. The local road improvements \nwill  provide  a  greater  relative  improvement  in  accessibility  to  poor  communities,  and  will  cater \ndirectly  to  the  transportation  needs  of  farmers  in  general  and  poor  farmers  in  particular.  In \ncontrast,  benefits  from  the  expressway  component  will  mostly  be  longer  term  and  indirect  in \nnature,  resulting  from  the  general  increase  in  economic  activity  in  the  Anning  Valley  made \npossible by the expressway. The transportation needs of farmers, and especially poor farmers, \nprimarily involve local, as opposed to interurban, roads. \n \nD. \n \n56. \nThe Project was formulated to reduce potential technical, economic, financial, and social \nrisks. The main technical risks, which could result in implementation delays and cost overruns, \nare  associated  with  the  tunnel  and  bridge  structures.  To  mitigate  the  risks,  international \nconsultants  reviewed  the  proposed  design  and  construction  methods.  Prequalification  of \ncontractors focuses on their financial and technical capability in handling complex works. During \nconstruction,  monitoring  and  contract  management  information  systems  will  be  set  up  and \nimplemented,  with  the  assistance  of  the  international  consultants,  for  timely  identification  of \ntechnical  problems  and  implementation  of  corrective  measures.  Given  the  safety  hazards \nassociated with bridge works, the contractors will be required to strictly enforce working safety \nrules and measures. SPCD has proven experience and has shown satisfactory performance in \nimplementing \nfinanced  projects.  Appropriate  coordination  and  monitoring \nmechanisms  will  be  put  in  place  to  mitigate  resettlement  risks.  There  is  a  risk  that  the \nopportunities for anticipated development in social services and income generation may not be \naccessible to the poor. This risk is mitigated by the strong commitment of the Government and \nSichuan Province to poverty reduction as part of the Western Region Development Strategy and \nthe monitoring system to ensure that benefits accrue to the poor.    \n \n57. \nEconomic  performance  in  the  project  influence  area  would  have  to  deteriorate \nsubstantially  for  the  Project  to  lose  economic  viability.  The  financial  risk  associated  with \nconstruction  and  operation  of  the  expressway  will  depend  on  the  actual  construction  costs, \ncommercial  management  and  appropriate  tolls.  To  mitigate  the  financial  risks,  SPECL  is \nbuilding a commercial business environment for expressway operations, the project expressway \n\ninternationally \n\nRisks  \n\n\f 18 \n\nwill receive substantial equity from the central and provincial governments, and an appropriate \ntoll  structure  will  be  adopted.  For  a  project  generating  revenue  in  domestic  currency,  a  risk  is \nrelated  to  exchange  rate  changes,  and  is  partly  accounted  for  in  the  base  case  calculations. \nSensitivity tests indicate that an adverse exchange rate change of 30% would have only a small \neffect  on  the  FIRR.  A  30%  one-off  adverse  change  in  the  exchange  rate  in  the  first  operating \nyear would also have little impact on the debt service coverage ratio. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nRoad  Safety.  SPCD  and  SPECL  will \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  SPCD  have  given  the \n\n \nA. \n \n58. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n59. \nCounterpart Financing. SPCD and SPECL will obtain, on a timely basis, all funds and \nresources necessary for project implementation. The Government will take, and will cause SPG, \nthrough  SPCD,  to  take  all  necessary  measures  to  ensure  that  SPCD  and  SPECL  can \nsuccessfully implement the Project, and operate and manage it after completion. \n \n60. \nConstruction  Quality. SPCD and SPECL will ensure that the Project is constructed in \naccordance with technical standards of the Ministry of Communications for highway engineering \nand with reference to the highway design manual developed under ADB-financed TA for Review \nof Highway Design Standards.36 The international consultant designated as the team leader and \nassistant  chief  supervision  engineer  will  review  and  certify  variation  orders  and  contractors\u2019 \nmonthly payments, before the chief supervision engineer approves them. \n \n61. \nroad  safety  signage, \ncommunication,  hazard  barriers,  traffic  monitoring,  and  vehicle  weighing;  and  will  cooperate \nclosely  with  the  public  security  bureau  to  implement  necessary  road  safety  measures.  The \npublic  security  bureau  will  prepare  and  implement  the  provincial  road  safety  guidelines  and \naction  plans  for  road  safety  in  Liangshan  and  Panzhihua  prior  to  opening  of  the  expressway. \nBefore  opening  the  expressway,  SPCD  in  consultation  with  the  public  security  bureau  will \nsubmit a report on the emergency response plan to ADB for review. Recommendations of the \nroad safety audit will be considered prior to the expressway construction and operations. \n \n62. \nTolls. In determining toll level, SPG will take into consideration levels sufficient to satisfy \nthe  SPECL\u2019s  debt  service  coverage  ratio  of  minimum  1.2  times  from  the  second  year  of  full \noperation. Six months before the expressway is opened, SPCD through SPECL will seek ADB\u2019s \nconcurrence  on  the  proposed  toll  structure  and  levels  prior  to  SPG\u2019s  approval.  For  the  first  5 \nyears of operation, SPCD through SPECL will review the toll structure and levels annually, and \nsubmit  a  report  to  ADB.  SPCD  through  SPECL  will  seek  ADB\u2019s  concurrence  on  toll  levels \nadjustment before SPG approval is sought. \n \n63. \nstrengthen its corporate governance by 31 December 2004. \n \n64. \nFinancial  Ratios.  To  ensure  financial  sustainability,  SPECL  will  maintain  (i)  a  debt-to-\nequity ratio of not more than 60:40; (ii) a working ratio (annual O&M cost, but excluding periodic \nmaintenance  cost,  to  revenue)  of  not  more  than  12%  during  expressway  operation;  and  (iii)  a \n\nCorporate  Governance.  SPECL  will  implement  the  corporate  development  plan  to \n\nimplement \n\nthe \n\n                                                 \n36 ADB. 1996.

Manila \n\n\f \n\n19\n\ndebt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.2 during expressway operation from the second \nyear of full operation. \n \n65. \nHuman  Resource  Development  and  Training. SPECL in consultation with SPCD will \nprepare a human resource development plan. Before undertaking international training, SPECL \nwill  prepare,  for  ADB\u2019s  concurrence,    (i)  a  training  plan  and,  separately,  a  list  of  nominated \ncandidates,  (ii)  a  program  of  workshops  to  be  delivered  at  SPECL  by  those  trained \ninternationally,  and  (iii)  a  list  of  training  equipment  and  aids  required  to  strengthen  SPECL\u2019s \ndomestic training programs. Upon completion of each workshop, SPECL will submit to ADB an \nevaluation of the international training and the workshop. \n \n66. \nPrivate Sector Development. SPCD will enter into a concession framework agreement \nwith  SPECL  by  30  June  2004.  Six  months  before  the  opening  of  the  project  facilities,  SPCD \nthrough SPECL will analyze the feasibility of attracting private sector investment funds for future \nroad sector investment, including private sector participation in O&M of the project expressway, \nand report its conclusions to ADB. \n \n67. \nEnvironment.  SPCD  and  SPECL  will  ensure  that  the  Project  is  constructed  and \noperated  in  accordance  with  Government\u2019s  rules  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Environmental \nGuidelines for Selected Infrastructure Development Projects. SPCD and SPECL will implement \nthe  mitigation  measures  and  environmental  monitoring  program  set  out  in  the  EIA  to  mitigate \nany adverse environmental impacts arising from the Project.  \n \n68. \nVehicle Emissions. SPECL will cooperate with and assist the Environmental Protection \nBureau of Sichuan in controlling vehicle emissions on the project expressway. Before opening \nthe project expressway, SPECL will submit to ADB the emission regulation limits prescribed by \nthe  Government,  penalties  for  their  infringement,  and  the  plan  for  enforcing  vehicle  emission \ncontrol  for  the  expressway.  The  Provincial  Environmental  Protection  Bureau  will  prepare  and \nimplement  the  provincial  guidelines  for  vehicle  emissions  reduction  and  the  action  plans  for \nLiangshan and Panzhihua prior to opening of the expressway. \n \n69. \nLand Acquisition and Resettlement. SPCD and SPECL will ensure that the resettlement \nplan,  including  land  acquisition,  is  carried  out  promptly  and  efficiently,  in  line  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s Land Administration Law and ADB's policy on involuntary resettlement. SPCD and \nSPECL will ensure that implementation of the resettlement plan is monitored and evaluated by a \nlocal  institute  and  reported  to  ADB,  and  that  a  baseline  survey  is  carried  out  as  required  in  the \nplan.  \n \n70. \nPoverty  Reduction. SPECL will cause the contractors to maximize the employment of \nlocal poor persons who meet the job and efficiency requirements for construction of the project \nroads.  Such  workers  will  be  provided  on-the-job  training.  The  Government  will  cause  SPG  to \nextend  the  coverage  and  quality  of  public  utilities,  basic  health,  and  basic  education  in  the \nproject  area  to  enhance  the  poverty  reduction  impacts.  The  Poverty  Alleviation  Office,  in \nconsultation  with  SPECL,  will  monitor  the  impacts  on  poverty  with  the  assistance  of  a \ndesignated local institute based on a set of indicators and will submit annual monitoring reports \nto ADB. \n \n71. \nGender  and  Development. SPCD and SPECL will follow ADB\u2019s policy on gender and \ndevelopment  during  project  implementation,  and  will  take  all  necessary  actions  to  encourage \nwomen to participate in planning and implementing the Project. SPCD and SPECL will monitor \n\n\f 20 \n\nthe effects on women during project implementation through gender-disaggregated data where \nrelevant in the resettlement plan and the monitoring and evaluation system. \n \n72. \nHealth  Risks.  The  Department  of  Health  and  SPECL,  together  with  the  appropriate \nauthorities,  will  ensure  that  contractors  disseminate  information  on  the  risks  of  socially \ntransmitted  diseases  to  those  employed  during  project  implementation.  The  Department  of \nHealth, SPCD, and SPECL will also ensure that similar information is disseminated to transport \noperators during operation of the project facilities. \n \n73.  Women  and  Child  Labor.  SPECL  will  include  a  specific  clause  in  bidding  documents \nrequiring  that  the  civil  works  contractors  (i)  do  not  differentiate  payment  between  men  and \nwomen  for  work  of  equal  value,  and  (ii)  do  not  employ  child  labor  in  the  construction  and \nmaintenance activities. \n \n74. \nAxle  Loads.  SPCD,  through  SPECL,  will  install  vehicle  axle-weighing  equipment  at \nselected  entry  points.  SPCD  through  SPECL  will  make  suitable  arrangements  for  operation  of \nsuch equipment. Before opening the project expressway, SPECL will submit to ADB the plan for \noperation  of  the  vehicle  weigh  stations,  including  the  prescribed  axle-load  limits  and  penalties \nfor infringement. \n \nChange in Ownership. If (i) any change in ownership of the project facilities, or (ii) any \n75. \nsale,  transfer,  or  assignment  of  SPCD\u2019s  interest  in  the  project  expressway  is  anticipated,  the \nGovernment,  SPG,  and  SPECL  will  consult  ADB  at  least  6  months  before  the  change.  The \nGovernment,  SPG,  and  SPECL,  will  ensure  that  any  proposed  change  in  ownership  of  the \nproject facilities is carried out in a legal and transparent manner. \n \nB. \n \nThe  loan  agreement  will  take  effect  subject  to  the  following  condition:  an  onlending \n76. \nagreement  between  SPG  and  SPECL  will  have  been  executed  on  the  same  terms  and \nconditions as those of the ADB loan. \n \n\nCondition for Loan Effectiveness \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n77. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nADB  and  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the  provisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the \nArticles of Agreement of ADB.

The total number of trucks, cars, and buses increased by \nabout 1.3 million in 2000, with the market share for trucks dropping to 45.0%, down from 66.8% in \n1990. Despite the rapid increase in total vehicles, every 100 persons had only about 1.3 vehicles \n(truck, car, or bus). This figure is low relative to other countries in the Asia and Pacific region.1 Not \nuntil  the  early  1980s  were  modern  vehicles  imported  and  joint  ventures  formed  with  foreign \nautomobile  manufacturers  to  introduce  modern  technology.  Over  the  next  5  years,  plans  are  to \ninvest  up  to  $7  billion  in  automotive  manufacturing.  The  PRC\u2019s  accession  to  the  World  Trade \nOrganization  in  December  2001  should  increase  investment  in  automobile  production.  The \nmodernization  of  the  vehicle  fleet  will  improve  vehicle  safety,  and  reduce  fuel  consumption  and \nvehicle  emissions.  In  2000  there  were  438,000  passenger  vehicles  and  319,000  trucks  and \npassenger vehicles in Sichuan, equal to 4.8% of the national fleet. This is lower in proportion to \nboth  population  and  length  of  road  by  comparison  with  the  PRC  as  a  whole.  For  example,  in \n2000, Sichuan had about 0.9 vehicles for 100 persons, only two thirds of the national average. \nGrowth in the number of vehicles in Sichuan between 1990 and 2000 was 10.1% per annum, \nslightly lower than the national average of 11.1% per annum. \n \n2. \nThe  privately  owned  fleet  of  motor  vehicles  in  the  PRC  increased  more  than  20  times \nduring 1985\u20132000, from 0.3 million vehicles to 6.3 million. Trucks accounted for 41% of the total \nprivately owned vehicles; cars and buses, 58%; and other specialized vehicles, 1%. In Sichuan, \nprivately owned motor vehicles in 1999 totaled about 117,800. Given the PRC's rapid economic \ngrowth  and  low  vehicle  ownership,  both  the  public  and  private  vehicle  fleets  are  expected  to \ncontinue to grow rapidly in the coming years. This will result in substantial increases in the volume \nof  road  traffic  and  mounting  congestion.  The  high  share  of  slow-moving  traffic,  mainly  tractors, \nbicycles,  and  nonmotorized  agricultural  vehicles,  aggravates  road  congestion,  and  is  a  major \ncause of traffic accidents.  \n \n3. \nThe Road Transport Industry. The provincial communications departments (PCDs) are \nresponsible  for  regulating  the  road  transport  industry  by  licensing  drivers,  vehicles,  and  intercity \nbus services. Road transport tariffs are subject to controls in the range of plus or minus 20% of \nlocally  established  advisory  tariffs.  The  relaxation  of  trucking  regulations  in  the  1980s  allowed \nprivately owned trucks to haul cargo for state-owned factories and cooperatives. Privately owned \ntrucks  absorbed  most  of  the  traffic  growth  in  the  1990s  with  the  market  share  of  state-owned \ntransportation  companies  declining.  The  resulting  competition  is  improving  road  transport \nefficiency  and  the  quality  of  services.  ADB  supported  this  process  through  technical  assistance \n(TA).2 The Ministry of Communications (MOC) is encouraging the private sector to augment the \noverall capacity of the road transport industry. The annual passenger handling capacity increased \nfrom  12.0  billion  passengers  in  1997  to  14.5  billion  in  2000.  About  900,000  buses  were  in \noperation  in  2000  compared  with  764,000  in  1994.  The  number  of  bus  routes  reached  about \n85,000 to serve more than 94% of the villages accessible by road. \n \nRoad  Administration.  Road  administration  in  the  PRC  is  decentralized.  At  the \n4. \nprovincial  level,  the  PCDs  are  responsible  for  the  highway  networks,  and  plan,  budget,  and \nfinance  road  projects.  Generally  the  PCDs  are  financially  independent  of  the  Government, \nexcept with large projects of national significance. MOC provides policy guidance and technical \n\n                                                 \n1   Figures  for  other  countries  are  2.5  for  India,  5.0  for  Indonesia,  14.3  for  Thailand,  59.6  for  Australia,  and  65.3  for \n\n2  ADB.  1993.

Provincial  planning  commissions  approve  development  plans  and  projects.  The \nPCDs,  through  their  city,  prefecture,  and  county-level  units,  are  responsible  for  planning  and \nadministering  the  road  sector,  including  constructing  and  maintaining  the  road  network.  Road \nsafety and annual vehicle testing are the responsibility of the Ministry of Public Security at the \nnational  and  local  government  levels.  Inspection  of  vehicle  emissions  is  the  responsibility  of \nlocal  environmental  protection  bureaus  in  conjunction  with  provincial  public  security  bureaus. \nThe road sector agencies are generally well staffed with trained technical personnel, particularly \nat  the  central  and  provincial  levels.  Human  resource  development  systems  provide  regular \ntraining  for  technical  staff,  operators,  and  various  technicians.  The  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) has supported human resource development in sector institutions under loans and TAs. \nADB\u2019s  country  assistance  program  evaluation  for  the  PRC  concluded  that,  in  the  transport \nsector,  executing  agencies  have  been  making  good  use  of  the  knowledge  transfer,  and  in-\ncountry and external training opportunities provided under ADB projects. \n \n5. \nRoad Sector Revenues and Expenditures. Expenditures in highway infrastructure are \nfinanced from dedicated user charges, Government grants, domestic bank loans and bonds, and \nforeign  loans  and  investments.  Two  dedicated  user  charges,  the  road  maintenance  fee  and  the \nvehicle purchase fee, have provided much of the financing for the road sector. During the 9th Five-\nYear  Plan  (FYP,  1996\u20132000),  the  road  maintenance  fee,  levied  on  the  revenue  of  freight  and \npassenger transport companies and on the load capacity of private vehicles, provided about 53% \nof the total financing requirements of road investments. Revenues from the vehicle purchase fee, \nlevied  on  the  retail  price  of  vehicles,  financed  about  13%,  mostly  in  poorer  provinces  as \ngovernment  policy.  MOC  provided  supplementary  financing  of  about  2%  of  the  requirements  to \nconstruct  or  rehabilitate  rural  roads  in  poverty  areas.  Domestic  loans  and  bond  financing, \ngenerally  with  short  maturities,  were  still  relatively  low,  and  accounted  for  9%  of  all  highway \ninvestments.  Other  domestic  financing,  including  from  local  governments  and  state-owned \nenterprises, accounted for 12% of the requirements. Foreign loans covered 8% of the investment \nin highway construction, and foreign direct investment the remaining 3%. During the 1980s and \n1990s,  the  PRC  increased  its  foreign  borrowing  for  infrastructure,  mainly  from  ADB,  the  Japan \nBank for International Cooperation (JBIC), and the World Bank. \n \nIn  Sichuan,  road  maintenance  fees  and  domestic  borrowings  are  major  financing \n6. \nsources for its budget. During the 9th FYP, the road maintenance fee, levied on the revenue of \nfreight  and  passenger  transport  companies  and  on  the  load  capacity  of  private  vehicles, \nprovided about 20% of the total financing requirements of road investments, and the domestic \nborrowings provided about 37%. The provincial road budgets during the 9th FYP increased from \nCNY6,065 million in 1996 to CNY11,220 million in 2000. However, an increasing proportion of \nprovincial road budgets is being used to meet the national priority for expressway and highway \nconstruction.  The  proportion  of  funding  for  new  construction  of  expressways  increased  from \n64%  to  75%  in  the  last  5  years,  while  the  proportion  for  county  and  township  roads  declined \nfrom  11%  to  5%.  In  addition,  the  proportion  of  funding  for  road  maintenance  decreased  from \n17% in 1996 to 13% in 2000. The proposed Project, however, includes not only the construction \nof  new  expressway  but  also  the  upgrading  of  high-priority  local  roads,  so  that  the  Project  will \nhelp ensure that expenditures for expressways and local roads are reasonably balanced during \nthe 10th FYP. According to the forecasted 10th FYP, the proportion of funding for rehabilitation \nand  new  construction  of  county  and  township  roads  will  increase  from  5%  in  2000  to  20%  in \n2005. \n \n7. \nRoad  Engineering  and  Construction.  Road  and  bridge  projects  are  designed  by  the \nplanning and design institutes at the provincial, prefecture, and county levels. MOC reviews the \ndesigns of expressways, class I highways, and associated structures. In general, the institutes are \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nstaffed with experienced, well-qualified personnel. Construction is supervised by personnel from \ncounty, city, and prefecture highway units. The city and county highway bureaus have their own \nconstruction units to carry out minor projects within their administrative districts. Drawing on the \nexperience gained under ADB- and World Bank-financed projects, competitive bidding practices \nwere mandated by the 1999 Tendering and Bidding Law. Many of the larger provincial and urban \nconstruction  bureaus  are  being  reorganized  into  financially  independent  companies  and  have \nbeen awarded contracts individually or as partners in joint ventures on several ADB- and World \nBank-financed highway projects. \n \nIn  1999,  MOC  implemented  a  series  of  measures  to  enhance  quality  control  in  highway \n8. \nconstruction and carried out two nationwide quality audits of the construction of national highways \nand  major  trunk  roads.  As  required  by  MOC,  all  PCDs,  including  the  Sichuan  Provincial \nCommunications  Department  (SPCD),  have  been  inspecting  the  quality  of  their  ongoing  road \nconstruction  works  from  1999.  Taking  into  account  findings  of  the  audits,  MOC  will  adopt  more \nstringent regulations to ensure that roads are constructed to national standards. Investment will be \nincreased in regions, including Sichuan Province, that have completed good quality roads that are \nwell-managed  and  well-maintained.  Investment  will  be  decreased  in  regions  with  projects  of \nsubstandard quality due to inappropriate technical design or poor implementation. \n \n9. \nPolicy Dialogue. ADB has been actively undertaking policy dialogue on the PRC road \nsector since 1991. The principal issues addressed include the poverty impact of road projects, \nhighway  design  standards  and  construction  quality,  road  safety,  vehicle  emissions,  pricing \npolicies,  commercialization  and  corporatization,  and  nongovernment  financial  resources.  The \nstatus and achievements to date are summarized in the Road Sector Policy Reform Plan. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fROAD SECTOR POLICY REFORM PLAN \n\n \n\nInitiative \n\n  Current Status \n\nActions \n\nTarget Date \n\n \n\n \n1.

Based \non its findings, a poverty and social analysis (Table A3.1) was carried out to ensure that the Project \nmeet ADB\u2019s safeguard policy requirements for involuntary and indigenous peoples. \n \n2. \nIn 1994, Sichuan Province drew up the provincial poverty reduction plan and social strategy \nin line with the national poverty reduction plan. Physical achievements of the provincial action plan \nincluded  improved  water  supply  (10  million  people),  land  development  (380,000  hectares  [ha]), \nprovision  of  irrigation  (167,000  ha),  afforestation  and  grassland  development  (500,000  ha),  road \nconstruction  (38,000  kilometers  [km]),  and  new  housing  separating  minority  people  from  their \nlivestock (250,000 households). Vehicular access to most townships is now possible and the great \nmajority of villages receive electricity. Some voluntary resettlement schemes have been carried out \nby relocating high mountain communities to areas with greater production potential. \n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe project area is centered on the Anning River valley in the southwest of Sichuan. The \nproject area is diverse in terms of climate, topography, ecology, economy, and ethnic minorities. It \nincludes Dechang, Miyi, and Yanbian counties; the urban district of Panzhihua; and small parts of \nHuili, Renhe, and Xichang counties. About 1.2 million people live in the project area. Over 80% of \nthe rural population live in Dechang, Miyi, and Yanbian counties. The economy of the project area \nhas grown at an average annual rate of 10% since 1990. The soil is fertile and climactic conditions \nin  the  valleys  are  favorable.  Although  agriculture  contributes  16%  of  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP), almost 60% of the total labor force in the project area work in agriculture. Major agricultural \nproducts include grain and cash crops such as sugar, fruit, meat production, and tobacco, much of \nwhich  is  sold  in  other  parts  of  the  country.  In  the  mountainous  areas,  where  irrigation  is  limited, \ncash cropping is limited and grain yields are lower.   \n \n4. \nMinority groups account for about 12% of the population in the project area, principally the \nYi minority (90%), who mostly live in poor mountainous villages. Twenty-four of the 101 townships \nin  the  project  area  have  a  minority  population  exceeding  75%.  Relative  to  the  poor  Han,  poor \nminority  families  tend  to  have  a  lower  level  of  cultivation  expertise,  experience  a  higher  level  of \nabsolute  poverty,  have  larger  families,  are  in  poorer  health,  especially  women  and  children,  and \nhave lower school attendance and adult literacy rates. \n \n5. \nDespite declines in poverty in the project area, the poverty incidence is still high. Out of a \ntotal  rural  population  of  611,900,  194,190  (32%)  have  annual  incomes  of  less  than  CNY1,000 \ncompared with 12% nationally. Of the 544 rural villages in the project area, 282 are classified as \npoor.  Around  40%  of  the  total  rural  population  live  in  poor  villages.  The  incidence  of  poverty  is \nunevenly  distributed  in  the  project  area:  under  20%  in  the  Anning  valley,  around  80%  in  the \nmountainous areas. Yanbian is the poorest county\u201353% of the rural poor population are classified \nas poor compared with 22% in Renhe and Xichang counties.  \n \n6. \nDuring  the  participatory  rural  appraisal  undertaken  as  part  of  the  project  processing \nactivities,  several  types  of  information  were  collected  for  each  village  and  township:  the  rural \npopulation and average income per capita (Table A3.2), road access, and access to basic facilities \nsuch power, telephone, water, health, and education (Table A3.3). \n \n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nTable A3.1: Summary Poverty and Social Analysis \n\n \nYes \n\n \n \nYes \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nSector Identified as a National Priority \nin Country Poverty Partnership \nAgreement (draft)? \n\n \nA. \nSector  Identified  as  a  National  Priority  in \nCountry Poverty Analysis?   \n \nContribution  of  the  road  sector  to  reduce  poverty  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC):  Road  sector \ncontributes  to  poverty  reduction  directly  through  improved  access  to  markets,  employment  opportunities,  and \nsocial services; and indirectly thorough stimulating economic development. \n \nB. \n                                                                     Poverty Classification: Other \nPoverty  analysis  was  carried  out  to  identify  the  causes  of  poverty  in  the  project  area  and  demonstrate  how  the \nProject would help reduce poverty by including the 558 kilometer (km) local road component in poor and remote \nareas, and by giving priority to local poor laborers for unskilled jobs. The distribution analysis was carried out and \nthe  poverty  impact  ratio  was  calculated.  The  poverty  impact  ratio  (24%)  is  higher  than  the  national  poverty \nincidence (12%) and the income share of the poor (4%). \n \nC. \nStakeholder participation and consultations have been an important element in the development and design of the \nProject.  They  have  occurred,  involving  over  900  people,  since  March  1997  during  the  preparation  of  the  social \nanalysis,  feasibility  study,  environmental  impact  assessment,  and  the  resettlement  plan;  to  inform  the  people \naffected about the project objectives and to understand their priorities, needs, and concerns; through dialogue with \nthe  county  and  township  representatives  in  the  project  area,  to  ensure  that  local  concerns  are  adequately \naddressed  in  the  project  design  and  thereby  gain  their  support  and  cooperation  during  implementation;  and \nthrough discussions with nongovernment organizations that represent the poor. \n\nParticipation Process \n\nParticipation strategy required:     Yes \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\n \nOutput \nPrepared  \n\nNot Significant  The Project is gender neutral.

Manila. \n\n \n7. \nThe  root  causes  of  poverty  in  the  project  area  (particularly  in  the  mountainous  areas)  are \nthe  poor  productive  conditions  and  difficult  topography\u2014a  situation  exacerbated  by  general \nremoteness  and  inadequate  road  access.  Although  all  townships  are  accessible  by  vehicle,  no \nmountain  township  is  served  by  a  paved  road.  Roads  are  mostly  rock  and  earth,  narrow,  and \nsubject  to  frequent  rockfalls,  which  make  them  impassable.  Few  are  accessible  by  a  normal  car, \npickup, or minibus; the risk of accidents is high in bad weather. Medium-sized trucks are the prime \nmeans  of  vehicular  transport.  Passenger  fares  are  more  than  double  those  on  good  roads\u2013 \nCNY0.35 compared with CNY0.15 per km. Consequently, many people walk, for up to 7 hours to \nget to market, and up to 5 hours to get fuelwood. Horses and donkeys are an important element of \nthe  transportation  system  in  the  mountains  for  heavy  loads;  they  are  rarely  ridden.  The  cost  of \nconstruction  materials  and  fertilizer  are  considerably  higher  in  areas  with  poor  road  access.  In \nsome  areas,  farmers  feed  their  fruit  to  pigs  as  they  cannot  market  it.  Poor  access  also  limits  the \nability  of  residents  to  take  advantage  of  increased  employment  opportunities  in  the  urban  areas \nand makes it difficult for local officials and agricultural extension officers to visit the poorest areas. \n \n8. \nUrban incomes in the project area are on average, higher than in the province as a whole. \nOne  reason  is  that  the  Pangang,  a  state-owned  enterprise  providing  over  25%  of  total  urban \nemployment  in  the  project  area,  pays  above  average  salaries  as  well  as  numerous  ancillary \nbenefits. Of the total urban population in the project area, 10.6% have annual incomes of less than \nCNY3,000, compared with around 10% of a national average for urban. \n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nSocial and Poverty-Related Project Features \n\n9. \nVarious  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  in  Sichuan, \nincluding  the  Sichuan  Foundation  for  Aiding  Poverty-Stricken  Areas,  Development  of  Rural \nSichuan,  Ford  Foundation  of  the  United  States,  Aierbert  Foundation  of  Germany,  and  Kaier  of \nJapan.  The  Sichuan  Foundation  is  a  prominent  NGO  in  Sichuan  (the  local  office  of  the  China \nFoundation for Poverty Alleviation). One of their main priorities is environmental protection in poor \nareas, especially along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The foundation has helped the Yi \nminority in Liangshan in renovating houses and moving from felling trees to reclaiming wasteland \nso that farmers can be engaged in planting and livestock. \n \nB. \n \n10. \nTo  strengthen  the  poverty  reduction  impact  of  the  Project,  three  main  features  received \nparticular attention: (i) the expressway was designed with attention to social and poverty issues; (ii) \nthe  local  road  component  was  selected  mainly  using  poverty  criteria;  and  (iii)  the  Project  will \nmaximize the use of poor people for the unskilled labor jobs created during project construction. \n \nThe  selected  alignments  of  the  project  road  are  the  least  disruptive  of  alternative \n11. \nalignments. The design incorporates the following features: (i) bypassing heavily populated areas \nas  evidenced  by  the  relatively  small  number  of  households  to  be  relocated,  (ii)  constructing  35 \nunderpasses in urban and rural locations for people and animals, and (iii) installing 311 culverts to \naccommodate surface runoff and to augment water flow to irrigation canals. \n \n12. \nThe Project, with a local road component of 558 km (Table A3.4) improving access to poor \nand  minority  areas,  will  provide  the  poor  rural  population  the  needed  transport  link  to  new  and \nlarger markets. The existing county, township, and village roads in the project area were mapped \nduring project preparation to identify the most effective local road component to be included in the \nProject. The local road component was designed using the following criteria: (i) connecting poverty \ntownships to the expressway\u2019s interchanges, (ii) connecting poverty townships to each other, and \n(iii) impact on economic and social development of the local areas. Experience has shown that to \nraise  communities  and  households  above  the  poverty  level,  alternative  sources  of  incomes  in \naddition to farming are required. An important factor in providing such off-farm income sources is \nall-weather access roads for migrant labor, village enterprises, or small family businesses.  \n \n13. \nTo enhance the direct impact of the Project on poverty reduction, priority in unskilled labor \njobs will be given to poor people. The Sichuan Panxi Expressway Company Limited (SPECL) will \nensure  through  contractors  to  maximize  the  employment  of  local  poor  persons  who  meet  the  job \nand  efficiency  requirements  for  construction  of  the  project  roads.  Such  workers  will  be  given  on-\nthe-job training. The Sichuan Provincial Government will extend the coverage and quality of public \nutilities,  basic  health,  and  basic  education  in  the  project  area  to  enhance  the  poverty  reduction \nimpacts.  SPECL  will  monitor  the  impacts  on  poverty  with  the  assistance  of  a  designated  local \ninstitute and will submit annual monitoring reports to the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n \nC. \n \nThe Project will have a substantial beneficial socioeconomic impact on the majority of the \n14. \npopulation,  urban  and  rural,  of  the  project  area  in  general,  and  the  poor  population  in  particular. \nFarmers and urban residents will be the largest beneficiary groups.  Farmers will benefit through \nincreases in agricultural output arising from improved access to markets, lower transport and travel \ncosts,  reduced  travel  times  for  routine  activities  (going  to  market,  carrying  water  and  fuel  wood), \neasier access to emergency health care, increased interaction with the outside world, more visits \nfrom local officials involved in development  activities  and  increased  nonagricultural  employment   \n \n\nPoverty Impact Assessment \n\n\f \n\nRoad  Start \n\nA'Ci \nDechang \n\nFinish \n\nQiaodi \nMa'an \n\n5 \n35 \n\nTable A3.4: Local Road Component \n\nLength \n(km) \n\nPopulation  \nServed \n\nOther Townships \nServed \n\nPopulation/ \nkm \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n33\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nMa'an-Dechang road  Tielu \nMa'an \nMa'an-Dechang road  Dashan \nYalong River \nCi Da \nG108 \nLinsuo \nLaonian \nXiacun \nTiechang \nLiumin \nLiumin \nPuwei \nNanba \nYalong river \nNanba \nMiyi-Puwei road \nYunfeng \nMalong \nPingshan \nYumen-Ertan road \nLongsheng spur \nLinhai \nGong He \nGonghe \nHongguo \nHongguo \nHongguo \nHongge \nTotal \n\n24 \nYalong river  17 \n30 \n17 \nRehe \n21 \nDaliucao \n13 \nYinlu \n7 \nNanshan \n15 \nCangtian \n6 \nTiechang \n10 \nLiumin \n15 \nLiuhua \n17 \nSandi \nNanba \n11 \nYalong river  15 \n19 \nShengli \n12 \nLianhe \n15 \nYunfeng \n28 \nMalong \n36 \nS214 \n15 \nXin shan \n25 \nLongshen \n20 \nLinhai \nGonghe \n33 \nYalong river  13 \n16 \nTai tian \n9 \nHongming \nHuajiaoqing  14 \n31 \nWuben \n14 \nXinjiu \n558 \n \n\n    5,000 \n  18,050 \n\n    5,400 \n    4,750 \n    5,100 \n    4,750 \n    2,100 \n    2,800 \n    5,000 \n    7,100 \n  12,550 \n    7,550 \n    3,800 \n    1,650 \n  10,100 \n    2,800 \n    2,800 \n    2,800 \n    6,900 \n    4,200 \n    7,500 \n    4,300 \n    5,400 \n    3,200 \n    5,300 \n    9,000 \n    3,700 \n    1,500 \n    1,700 \n  13,900 \n  17,000 \n187,700 \n\n1,000 \n   520 \n\n \nTielu,  Rehe,  Dawan, \nDashan, Dezhou \n   230 \n \n   280 \nRehe \n   170 \nDawan \n   280 \n \n   100 \n \n   220 \n \n   710 \nLiusuo (part) \n   470 \n \nLiumin, Liuhaa, Sandi  2,090 \n   760 \nLiuhaa, Sandi \n   250 \n \n   100 \n \n   920 \nShengli, Lianghe \n   190 \nShengli \n   150 \n \n   230 \n \n   460 \nMalong \n   150 \n \n   210 \nFangtian \n   290 \nPingshan (part) \n   150 \nLongsheng \n   400 \n \n   160 \nLinhai \n   690 \nTaitien, Linhai \n   230 \n \n   170 \n \n   120 \n \n   450 \nHongni \n1,210 \nHongge (part) \n   336 \n(average) \n\n  Source: ADB. 2000.

Urban residents will benefit from additional economic growth resulting from a more \nefficient and higher capacity transport network. Farmers along the expressway alignment will gain \ntemporary  employment  during  its  construction.  These  benefits  will  affect  poor  and  nonpoor \npopulations  alike.  The  only  significant  disbenefits  are  those  arising  from  loss  of  land  and/or \nproperty.  Compensation  payments  and  replacement  houses  as  per  the  Resettlement  Plan  will \nmitigate these. \n \n15. \nThe Project is expected to generate a sustainable poverty reduction impact in both the long \nand  short  term.  The  short-term  improvements  will  come  primarily  as  a  result  of  the  local  road \nimprovements,  while  the  impact  of  the  expressway  will  be  mainly  felt  in  the  longer  term.  The \nnumber of poor beneficiaries will be around 244,000, of which almost 100,000 will benefit from the \nlocal  roads  component  (Table  A3.5).  Around  three  quarters  of  the  poor  population  of  the  project \narea will derive some benefit from the Project.  \n \n\nTable A3.5:  Project Beneficiaries Classified by Income and Sub-Group \n\nPopulation (\u2019000) by income \n\nBelow \nCNY625 \n\nCNY625- \n1,000 \n\nCNY1,000-\n1,300 \n\nCNY1,300-\n2,000 \n\nOver \nCNY2000 \n\nTotal \n\n16 \n\n7 \n\n20 \n\n43 \n\n19 \n\n8 \n\n70 \n\n97 \n\n3 \n\n1 \n\n120 \n\n49 \n\n126 \n\n237 \n\n130 \n\n406 \n\n32 \n\n13 \n\n6 \n\n51 \n\n17 \n\n3.0% \n\n21 \n\n89 \n\n50 \n\n20 \n\n15 \n\n86 \n\n43 \n\n7.6% \n\n129 \n\n38 \n\n143 \n\n% of rural beneficiaries \n\n12.6% \n\n21.2% \n\n10.6% \n\n23.9% \n\n32.0% \n\n100.0%\n\nUrban \n\nUrban residents \n\nBelow \nCNY2,000 \n\nCNY2,000-\n3,000 \n\nCNY3,000-\n4,000 \n\nCNY4,000-\n5,000 \n\nOver \nCNY5,000 \n\nTotal \n\n81 \n\n84 \n\n338 \n\n563 \n\n% of urban beneficiaries \n\n14.4% \n\n14.9% \n\n60.0% \n\n100.0%\n\nTotal beneficiary population \n\n68 \n\n124 \n\n181 \n\n468 \n\n969 \n\n% of all beneficiaries \n\n7.0% \n\n13.3% \n\n12.8% \n\n18.7% \n\n48.3% \n\n100.0%\n\nPopulation not affected \n\nTotal \n\nProject.

The  minorities  will  benefit  particularly  from  the  local  road  improvements  as  minorities \naccount  for  over  40%  of  the  beneficiaries  from  this  component.  The  resettlement  impact  on  the \nminority households, who live in a substantial number of villages mostly along the feeder roads, will \nbe small. Compensation and other measures included in the Resettlement Plan will ensure that the \nliving standards of these households are maintained. No adverse impacts are anticipated from the \nlocal  road  component.  Positive  discrimination  toward  minorities  will  continue  as  exemplified  by \nnational  fiscal  and  development  policies,  given  the  explicit  targeting  of  this  group  in  the  new \nNational  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy.  On  the  basis  of  this  analysis,  a  minority  peoples\u2019 \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n35\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \ndevelopment  plan  is  not  required  for  this  Project,  given  that  the  minorities  in  the  project  area  will \nnot be adversely affected and ongoing development programs will target this group while ensuring \nthat  their  cultural  identify  is  maintained.  The  resettlement  impact  on  the  minority  people  will  be \ndealt with as part of the resettlement plan. \n \n17. \nThe impact of the Project will be gender neutral\u2014women will benefit as much as men, and \nfew will experience adverse impacts. In one respect, women, and especially minority women, are \nexpected to benefit more than men. The division of labor in minority areas is more marked than in \nHan  areas.  Women  perform  a  large  proportion  of  farming  activities.  In  addition,  they  frequently \nundertake the marketing of the small surplus produce produced by the family. They also have the \nprime  responsibility  for  fetching  water  and  fuelwood.  All  these  tasks  require  much  walking  with \nheavy  loads,  often  accompanied  by  young  children.  Reduced  travel  costs,  greater  availability  of \ntransport,  and  improved  road  surfaces  will  all  lead  to  a  decrease  in  the  burden  of  these  daily \nactivities.  In  addition,  improved  transport  will  result  in  better  access  to  health  clinics  in  an  area \nwhere gynecological problems are common. \n \nD. \n \n18. \nThe  immediate  socioeconomic  effects  will  start  to  be  monitored  during  the  construction \nphase. Construction on several locations along the route will begin simultaneously under different \ncontractors.  Given  the  number  of  contractors  involved,  the  direct  short-term  effects  will  be \nmonitored  semiannually.  Any  favorable  practices  or  policies  by  one  of  them  will  be  used  as  a \nmodel for the others. Among the indicators to be collected for short-term effects are (i) labor force \nemployed  on  expressway  construction,  (ii)  number  of  unskilled  laborers,  (iii)  percentage  of  poor \nlaborers  in  the  labor  force,  (iv)  percentage  of  local  laborers  in  the  labor  force,  (v)  percentage  of \nwomen  in  the  total  labor  force,  and  (vi)  wage  level  of  laborers  on  the  local  road  component. \nPoverty  monitoring  will  be  carried  out  independently  as  part  of  the  project  performance \nmanagement system with the help of the consultants and a local institute. Monitoring will involve a \nbaseline  survey  at  the  start  of  construction  and  updates  as  stated  in  the  project  performance \nmonitoring  system  schedule.  The  baseline  data  will  be  collected  from  a  sample  of  the  affected \nbeneficiaries  and  a  control  group  before  construction  starts.  Consultants  and  an  institute  will \nconduct surveys as necessary. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nA. \n \n\n1. \n\nProject Costs and Benefits \n\n \n1. \nThe  Project  comprises  the  expressway  that  traverses  the  southern  part  of  Sichuan \nProvince and local roads connected to the expressway through the road network system. The \nProject  will  be  implemented  in  about  5  years,  and  economic  analysis  covers  the  following  20 \nyears of full operation.  Without the Project, traffic will use the existing road network, which will \nsoon  be  congested  and  expensive  to  maintain  because  of  the  rapidly  increasing  traffic.  Some \ntravel  may  not  take  place  because  of  the  congestion.  With  the  Project,  congestion  on  the \nexisting roads will be reduced, and traffic on the expressway and the existing roads will benefit \nfrom faster, cheaper, and safer travel. Some additional trips will be generated. \n \n2. \nLocal  roads  in  six  counties  will  be  improved  concurrently  with  the  expressway \ncomponent. The costs of this component include capital costs and operation and maintenance \n(O&M)  costs.  The  estimated  benefits  are  reduced  vehicle  operating  costs  (VOCs),  travel  time \nsavings  for  freight  and  passengers,  reduced  accidents,  and  additional  economic  activities \ngenerated from improved accessibility of the project area. \n \n\n2. \n\nValuation of Costs and Benefits \n\n \n3. \nGeneral  Parameters.  Economic  evaluation  was  undertaken  using  constant  2002 \neconomic prices. The prices are expressed in yuan using the domestic price numeraire with a \nshadow  exchange  rate  factor  of  1.08  for  foreign  exchange  effects.  A  shadow  price  is  used  to \nplace an economic value on the wages paid to unskilled labor, while skilled labor is not shadow \npriced since there is no surplus of skilled workers.  A shadow wage rate factor (SWRF) of 0.67 \nwas used to convert the financial wage rate to an economic opportunity cost of labor as 70% of \nemployees on highway construction projects are unskilled. \n \n \n4. \nCosts.  The  capital  costs  and  physical  contingencies  for  the  Project  are  revalued  at \neconomic  prices  by  separating  the  cost  items  into  tradable  materials  and  equipment, \nnontradable  materials,  labor,  and  land.  The  project  equipment  is  generally  tax  exempt.  A \ncomposite conversion factor of 0.964 was used. \n \nTraffic Forecasts. During the feasibility study prepared by the provincial design institute, \n5. \ntwo types of traffic surveys were carried out for traffic analysis, pavement design, and economic \nand financial evaluation: (i) manual classified counts, which provided base data for calculating the \nbase year average annual daily traffic (AADT) in medium truck equivalents (MTE); and (ii) origin-\ndestination surveys to obtain information about traffic movement. The traffic surveys undertaken \non 12 April 2000 were verified by the technical assistance consultants in 2001, at 15 key locations \nalong national highway 108 and provincial highway 214. The manual traffic surveys involved 12- \nto 24-hour counts that lasted for 7 days, and classified traffic into six vehicle categories (car, bus, \nsmall  truck,  medium  truck,  large  truck,  and  tractor-trailer).  The  surveys  collected  data  on  the \nnumber  of  vehicles  by  type,  trip  distribution,  type  and  weight  of  the  freight  loaded  on  vehicles, \nnumber  of  passengers,  and  transport  capacity  of  vehicles.  The  result  of  the  traffic  forecasts  is \ngiven  in  Table  A4.1  and  a  methodology  and  assumptions  used  are  detailed  in  Supplementary \nAppendix C. \n \n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n37\n\nTable A4.1: Average Annual Daily Traffic (medium truck equivalents) \n\n \n\n \nExpressway Section \nXichang-Dechang \nDechang-Guabang \nGuabang-Miyi \nMiyi-Yakou \nYakou-Xinjiu \nXinjiu-Jinjiang \n\nWeighted Average \n\n \n2008 \n     4,161 \n     6,240 \n     4,018 \n     7,214 \n     6,921 \n10,896 \n     6,281 \n\n \n2018 \n     9,139 \n11,403 \n     9,289 \n13,534 \n13,073 \n17,985 \n11,874 \n\nGrowth \nRate \n8.2% \n6.2% \n8.7% \n6.5% \n6.6% \n5.1% \n6.6% \n\n \n2028 \n16,179 \n20,526 \n17,360 \n21,866 \n21,649 \n28,068 \n20,389 \n\nGrowth \nRate \n5.9% \n6.1% \n6.5% \n4.9% \n5.2% \n4.6% \n5.6% \n\n             Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nBenefits. The main source of economic benefits of new or improved roads is a reduction \n6. \nin VOCs. VOCs vary by vehicle type (car, bus, truck), road characteristics (pavement width and \nroughness,  and  horizontal  and  vertical  alignment).  The  economic  costs  of  the  vehicles  are \nderived from international prices, with a quality adjustment for domestically produced vehicles. \nDomestically produced trucks and buses are valued at 75% of internationally traded trucks and \nbuses,  and  cars  at  90%  of  the  internationally  traded  cars.  Parts,  fuel,  and  oil  were  also \ncalculated  based  on  current  international  prices.  The  benefits  from  VOC  savings,  which  will \ninitially accrue to vehicle owners and operators, will in the long term be passed on to users of \ntransport services through reduced transport rates and fares, given the increasingly competitive \nnature of the road transport industry in the project area. \n \n7. \nThe benefits from a reduction in number and severity of accidents constitute an important \npart of economic benefits. Accident reductions were estimated based on the findings of a study \non  accidents  carried  out  by  the  Highway  Planning  and  Design  Institute  of  the  Ministry  of \nCommunications. Although the economic cost of accidents is higher on the expressway than on \nthe existing roads, with the Project the number of accidents per vehicle-kilometer in the project \ncorridor  will  be  reduced  substantially,  resulting  in  net  cost  savings  derived  from  avoided \naccident costs. The reduction in lives lost was not quantified in the analysis.  \n \n8. \nTravel  time  savings  will  be  enjoyed  by  traffic  both  on  the  project  expressway  and  the \nexisting roads.  VOCs embody the value of the time saved by vehicle drivers and crews, but not \nthe value of time saved by passengers. The value of time saved by passengers traveling in work \ntime  was  calculated  from  that  person\u2019s  wage  rate.  For  people  traveling  in  leisure  time,  the \npreferred method of valuation is willingness-to-pay for time saved. However, in the absence of \nlocal information on willingness-to-pay, this study bases its choice of values on annual income. \nThe value of time for work or business trips is assumed to be related more to urban incomes for \ncars, and more to average regional incomes for buses. Nonwork trips were given no value. The \nvalue of passenger travel time will increase as income rises. The economic model increases the \nvalue of personal travel time at 4% per annum. \n \n9. \nFor the 558 km local road component, providing access for mountain communities that \nare  transport-disadvantaged  and  poor,  the  benefits  are  computed  by  identifying  producer \nsurplus and consumer surplus. The producer surplus benefit is a consequence of reducing the \ncost of transport to markets. Producer surplus comes mainly from farming, and is the value of \nthe additional production less production costs. Increased producer surplus eventually shows up \nas  increased  household  income.  In  the  mountains,  income  is  limited  by  access  and  land \nproductivity. Improving access in the mountains will bridge part of the income gap between the \nmountains  and  the  valleys.  This  income  increase  is  tallied  as  a  producer  surplus  benefit.  The \nproducer surplus benefit is based on a 15% bridging of the income gap, which would realistically \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nbe  achievable. 1  Consumer  surplus  from  access  improvements  is  usually  estimated  by \nforecasting  generated  traffic.  Consumer  surplus  is  therefore  estimated  based  on  forecasted \npassenger  traffic  increase  that  amounts,  on  most  of  these  local  roads,  to  between  10  and  30 \nvehicles a day. 2 The road improvements will reduce VOCs and raise travel speeds from around \n20 km/h to around 40 km/h. \n \n10. \nResults  and  Conclusion.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the  Project, \nincluding  the  expressway  component  and  local  road  component,  is  16.2%  (Table  A4.2).  The \nEIRR  for  the  expressway  component  alone  is  16.1%  and  that  for  the  local  road  component, \n20.3%.  VOC  savings  are  the  major  economic  benefit  (78%),  followed  by  travel  time  savings \n(14%), accident cost savings (5%), and local road component (2%). \n  \nThe  EIRR  was  calculated  separately  for  the  local  roads.  The  Project  includes  31 \n11. \nsections of local roads that carry mainly local traffic including motorized traffic, such as local bus \nservice.  With  all  of  the  local  roads  connected  to  the  trunk  highway  system  through  the  road \nnetwork,  improvement  of  the  local  roads  is  expected  to  stimulate  the  rural  economy  in  the \nproject area. The costs of improvement vary, depending on the type of work required. Economic \nbenefits  for  motorized  traffic  are  reductions  in  VOCs  and  time,  and  generated  economic \nactivities  as  a  result  of  improved  access.    An  EIRR  of  16.2%  is  relatively  low  compared  with \nother recent projects in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) of a similar type. This is mainly \ndue to the high construction unit cost and low traffic.   \n \n12. \nSensitivity  analysis  tested  six  scenarios  to  assess  the  robustness  of  the  results  of  the \neconomic analysis (Table A4.3). The capital cost would have to be more than 85% higher than \nestimated in every case for the EIRR to fall below the cutoff rate of 12%. Considering the past \nexperience of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the PRC road sector, this switching value \nis  unlikely  to  occur.  ADB-financed  road  projects  in  the  PRC  have  not  encountered  major  cost \noverruns,  and  the  contract  prices  tend  to  be  lower  than  estimated  because  the  contracting \nprocess is becoming increasingly competitive. The benefits level would have to decrease more \nthan 43% to make the Project economically nonviable. A 2-year delay in completion causes the \nnet  present  value  to  decrease  by  62%.  A  20%  reduction  of  the  major  factors  determining \neconomic  benefits\u2014VOC  savings,  growth  rate  of  normal  traffic,  and  traffic  generation  rate\u2014 \ndoes not affect the economic viability of the Project. \n \n13. \nThe economic analysis of the Project was extended to quantify the direct poverty impact \nby  examining  distribution  of  project  net  benefits  by  determining  the  project  effects  for  various \nlabor,  and \nbeneficiaries, \ngovernment. The impact on the poor was assessed by quantifying the direct benefits that would \naccrue  to  poor  people  under  the  Project.  The  proportion  of  net  benefits  passed  on  to  poor \npeople,  or  the  poverty  impact  ratio,  was  calculated  as  24%  (Table  A4.4).  This  ratio  is  higher \nthan the country\u2019s poverty incidence and the income share of the poor.   \n \n \n \n \n\nincluding  road  users,  expressway  company, \n\nlocal  economy, \n\n                                                 \n1  To achieve this, per household income needs to increase by CNY1,000 per year. CNY1,000 can be earned from 50 \ndays  of  unskilled  labor  at  CNY20/day.  One  mu  (667  square  meters)  of  fruit  trees  produces  a  profit  of  at  least \nCNY1,000/year.  Livestock  projects  in  the  area,  promoting  free-range  grazing  of  cattle  and  goats,  are  generating \naverage net incomes of about CNY500/year and animal. Pigs earn a net CNY100 to CNY400 each. \n\n2  The estimate is likely to be less than the true value since the increase in passenger traffic is unlikely to reflect the \n\nfull benefit of increased personal mobility. \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n39\n\nFinancial Analysis \n\nB. \n \n14. \nGeneral.  Proforma  financial  statements  including  income  statement,  cash  flows,  and \nbalance  sheet  for  the  project  expressway  are  based  on  the  following  assumptions  and  were \nprepared  for  26  years  from  2002  to  2027.    All  projections  are  in  nominal  (inflation  adjusted) \nterms. Throughout the project life, annual inflation rates are assumed to be 2.4%.  \n \n15. \nassumptions:  \n \n\nfinancial  projections  are  based  on \n\nFinancial  Statements.  The \n\nfollowing \n\nthe \n\nBusiness tax is assessed at 5.75% on the gross operating revenues. \n\n(i) \n \n(ii) \n \n(iii) \n\n(v) \n\n \n(i) \n\nCorporate tax is assessed at 33% of net profit per year.  \n\nBased  on  the  toll  rates 3  and  the  forecast  traffic  mix,  the  weighted  average \nexpressway toll rate is assumed to be CNY1.38 per MTE-km in the opening year \n(2007). The toll rate is assumed to increase in real terms every 5 years.  \n\n(iv) \n\nThe depreciation is based on the economic life of project components.  \n\nTotal  operation  and  maintenance  costs  are  CNY287.3  million  in  2008  and  are \nescalated at an average rate of 5% per annum, based on a staff of 317 people \nemployed  at  toll  stations,  on  maintenance  teams,  and  at  administrative  offices.  \nAnnual salaries and benefits amount to an average 2002 cost of CNY15,000 per \nemployee,  and  the  total  payroll  is  CNY14.5  million.  Maintenance  expenses  are \nestimated  to  be  CNY27  million  annually.  Operation  and  maintenance  costs  are \nassumed to increase in line with traffic growth and domestic inflation.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(vi) \n\nAfter  10  years  of  full  operation,  the  expressway  will  need  to  be  repaved.    The \nrepaving cost of CNY60 million in the years 2018\u20132020 was adjusted by a price \nescalation factor of 2.4%. \n\n \nConclusions  of  financial  statements  are  summarized  as  follows:  (i)  The  projected \n16. \nfinancial  statements  indicate  that  the  expected  revenues  under  the  base  assumptions  are \nsufficient  to  cover  operating  costs,  business  tax,  debt  repayments  on  the  ADB  loan  and  the \ndomestic loan, and reasonable profits from the expressway operation (Table A4.5); and (ii) the \ndebt-to-equity  ratio,  which  decreases  steadily  from  50:50  in  the  first  year  of  full  operation, \nindicates a sound financial condition for the expressway under the proposed financing plan and \ntoll  structure.  The  debt  service  coverage  ratio  reaches  1.2  during  the  second  year  of  full \noperation.  \n\n \n17. \nFinancial  Evaluation.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  for  the  project \nexpressway is based on estimated incremental revenues and costs resulting from the operation \nof the expressway.  The assumptions in calculating the FIRR are as follows:  \n\nThe  cash  flows  and  financing  plan  are  in  real  2002  prices,  covering  25  years \ncomprising 4.75 years of construction and 20 years of full operation.  \n\n                                                 \n3 The opening toll rates per vehicle-km are CNY0.52 for cars, CNY1.00 for light trucks, CNY1.89 for medium trucks, \n\nand CNY2.68 for heavy trucks.  \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe FIRR was calculated after corporate tax, which is expected to be payable in \nthe sixth year of full operation. \n\nCapital  costs  include  all  incremental  capital  expenditures  related  to  the \nconstruction  and  equipment  of  the  project  expressway  as  well  as  periodic \nmaintenance  costs,  but  price  contingency  provisions  and  interest  during \nconstruction are excluded. \n\nOperation  and  maintenance  costs  include  all  incremental  costs  in  operating  the \nproject expressway, but exclude depreciation provisions. \n\nMajor  maintenance  (periodic  maintenance  such  as  pavement  resurfacing)  is \nassumed to take place in years 11\u201313 of operation, at a cost of CNY60 million. \n\nProjected  annual  operating  revenues  are  estimated  in  real  terms  based  on  the \ndiscounted weighted-average toll rate and the traffic forecast.     \n\n \n18. \nThe  results  of  the  financial  evaluation  show  an  FIRR  in  real  terms  of  5.5%  after \ncorporate income tax (Table A4.6). This is higher than the 4.0% real weighted average cost of \ncapital (WACC).  Moreover, the financial net present value at the WACC is CNY1,354 million.  \nSensitivity of the FIRR was tested under several scenarios on key parameters and combinations \nof parameters that determine costs and revenues. As shown in Table A4.6, the FIRR remains \nabove the WACC even under the worst scenario. When the capital cost increases by 10%, the \nFIRR decreases to 4.1%.  Increases in operating costs and traffic volume were found to have \nmarginal effects on the FIRR. \n \n\n\f  \n\nAppendix 4           41\n\nTable A4.2: Economic Internal Rate of Return of the Project\n(Constant 2002 economic prices, domestic price numeraire, CNY million)\n\nCosts\nOperation\nand\nMaintenance\n\nVOC\n\nTime\nSavings Savings Savings\n\nAccident Generated\n\nTraffic\n\nLocal\nRoad\nComponent\n\nNet\n\nTotal Benefit\n\nBenefits\n\nYear Capital\n\n672\n1,684\n2,024\n1,439\n1,099\n\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027 (3,459)\n\n52\n\n6\n23\n24\n24\n25\n25\n26\n27\n27\n28\n29\n29\n30\n31\n32\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n36\n\nTotal\n\n672\n1,684\n2,024\n1,439\n1,105\n23\n24\n24\n25\n25\n26\n27\n27\n28\n29\n81\n30\n31\n32\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n(3,423)\n\nVOC = vehicle operating cost.\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.\n\n102          10\n503          52\n572          61\n649          73\n737          86\n836        101\n948        120\n1,074        141\n1,215        167\n1,374        196\n1,554        231\n1,755        272\n1,987        323\n2,246        383\n2,534        453\n2,853        535\n3,209        630\n3,604        741\n4,043        870\n1,021\n4,528\n1,196\n5,065\n\n \n\n      11\n      55\n      60\n      65\n      72\n      78\n      86\n      94\n103\n112\n123\n135\n146\n158\n170\n184\n199\n216\n233\n252\n273\n\n          27\n          31\n          35\n          40\n          46\n          53\n          61\n          69\n          80\n          91\n104\n121\n140\n163\n189\n219\n254\n294\n341\n395\n\n(672)\n(1,684)\n(2,024)\n(1,439)\n(982)\n659\n748\n847\n960\n1,088\n1,232\n1,397\n1,582\n1,791\n2,028\n2,286\n2,649\n3,001\n3,395\n3,837\n4,335\n4,893\n5,521\n6,224\n10,401\n\n123\n676\n765\n864\n976\n1,104\n1,249\n1,413\n1,598\n1,806\n2,044\n2,311\n2,622\n2,973\n3,366\n3,807\n4,304\n4,861\n5,488\n6,190\n6,978\n\n40\n41\n41\n41\n42\n42\n43\n43\n44\n44\n45\n45\n46\n46\n46\n47\n47\n48\n48\n49\n\nEconomic Net Present Value at 12% =\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return =\n\n2,844\n16.2%\n\nEconomic Net\nPresent Value\n   (CNY million)\n\nSensitivity\nIndicatora\n\nSwitching\nValueb\n(%)\n\nTable A4.3: Sensitivity Analysis\n\nChange\n(%)\n\n+ 10\n+ 20\n - 10\n - 20\n\nEIRR\n(%)\n\n16.2%\n15.2%\n14.4%\n14.9%\n14.1%\n\n2,844\n2,511\n2,179\n2,184\n1,524\n\n1.17\n1.17\n2.32\n2.32\n\n85.4\n85.4\n(43.0)\n(43.0)\n\n1 year\n\n14.4%\n\n1,991\n\n  NPV declines by 30%.\n\n2 years\n\n12.7%\n\n1,081\n\n  NPV declines by 62%.\n\nScenario\n\n      Base Case\n1.

The  signs, \nmarking, interchange structure, and crash barriers must be selected adequately. The service/rest \nareas, if they are close to significant crossroads and towns, should also be used as long distance \nbus stops to provide convenient services for the passengers. Monitoring of overloaded vehicles will \nhelp  reduce  traffic  accident  risk,  pavement  damage  and  maintenance  cost.  Tunnel  safety  should \nbe incorporated as an integral design component. Road safety audits will be undertaken during the \ndesign and construction. \n \n \n \n2. \nThe  two  organizations  concerned  with  road  safety  and  enforcement  on  the  existing \nexpressways in Sichuan are the Expressway Subdivision of the Traffic Police of the Sichuan Public \nSecurity  Bureau  (SPSB)  and  the  Enforcement  and  Emergency  Division  of  the  Expressway \nCompanies. Sichuan\u2019s Road Safety Council investigates all types of accidents and produces draft \nprovincial  codes  and  standards  for  accident  prevention.  While  establishing  the  council  is  a \nsignificant step, the authority of this council needs to be enhanced to play a more proactive role in \ncoordinating road safety across the province.   \n\nOrganizational Structure \n\n2. \n\n \n3. \n\nInterdepartmental Coordination and Action Plan  \n\n \n3. \nCoordination.  An  interdepartmental  framework  is  needed  to  enhance  road  safety  in  the \nprovince.  While  the  Sichuan  Provincial  Communications  Department  (SPCD)  will  concentrate  on \nthe engineering, road safety audit, blackspot, and operation issues of the expressway, involvement \nof the SPSB is essential. SPCD will establish a working relationship strategy with SPSB to enforce \nsafer  and  better  expressway  operations.  The  strategy  will  seek  to  promote  innovative  ways  to \nimprove  road  by  following  a  broad-based  approach  (i)  institutional  strengthening:  strengthen  the \nprovincial  road  safety  council  by  establishing  interdepartmental  executive  group;  develop \ncomprehensive  action  programs,  technical  studies,  and  modalities  for  greater  leadership  and \nawareness;  improve  the  policy  and  regulatory  framework;  and  ensure  effective  monitoring;  (ii) \ncapacity  building  and  human  resources  development:  set  up  an  effective  and  uniform  database, \nupgrade  skills  and  knowledge,  and  provide  options  for  institutionalizing  road  safety  research;  (iii) \nprovincial  cooperation:  develop  potential  common  projects  and  activities,  conduct  regional \nworkshops,  foster  knowledge  and  dissemination  of  best  practice,  strengthen  the  linkage  with  the \nnational program, and set road safety targets and time frame; and (iv) create effective coordination \napproach  through  government  and  nongovernment  organizations,  private  sector,  and  community \ngroups.  This  will  be  achieved  through  (i)  computerized  accident  and  enforcement  reporting  and \nmonitoring system, (iii) development of a strategy framework and performance indicators, (iv) staff \ntraining,  and  (v)  strengthening  the  role  of  the  province  road  safety  council,  e.g.,  establishing  an \nexecutive management group comprising directors of SPSB, SPCD, and Municipal Commission, to \nidentify  the  role  of  each  stakeholder,  coordinate  the  interdepartmental  road  safety  programs, \noptimize the use of resources, manage road safety budget, promote road safety awareness, define \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 1996.

An action plan is required to promote an efficient road safety strategy in the \nprovince,  and  for  the  expressway.  An  integrated  approach  may  be  adopted  to  facilitate \nimplementation of the action plan by involving SPCD and SPSB. Insurance companies, the private \nsector,  and  NGO  groups  can  also  be  involved.  This  will  result  in  (i)  reduction  of  accidents;  (ii) \nreduced demand for emergency and hospital services; and (iii) improved productivity. Formulation \nof  a  better  fine  system  and  other  measures  will  generate  revenues  to  support  the  program. \nModification  of  the  vehicle-testing  center  will  also  provide  some  funds  to  support  the  proposed \nprogram. Implementation of the program will fulfil requirements of current Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and Government initiatives.2  \n \nA  road  safety  specialist  in  safety  strategy  development,  enforcement  management, \n5. \nprevention measures, socioeconomic cost, and critical issues of successful road safety programs is \nrequired for 2 person-months. The specialist will (i) develop general provincial road safety guidelines \ncovering  all  key  issues;  and  (ii)  develop  an  action  plan  and  procedures  in  the  project  area,  e.g., \nLiangshan  and  Panzhihua.  Coordination  between  SPCD  and  SPSB  is  important  to  facilitate \ndevelopment  and  implementation  of  the  action  plan.  The  existing  highway  patrol  team  will  be \nexpanded and strengthened through capacity development efforts to provide traffic policing services \nfor the project expressway. SPSB will implement the action plan, provide the necessary services, and \nassign senior officials to ensure smooth implementation and coordination with all parties. \n \nB. \n\nVehicle Emissions  \n \n1. \n\nBackground \n\n \n6. \nMotor  vehicle  emissions  are  a  significant  contributor  to  air  pollution  problem.  With  rapid \ngrowth  in  the  population  and  vehicle  ownership,  and  slow  action  by  authorities,  air  pollution \nconditions will deteriorate if no mitigation measures are taken. At present Chengdu ranks among \nthe 10 most polluted cities in the country.  \n \nFragmentation  of  responsibility,  lack  of  interdepartmental  coordination,  together  with \n7. \ninadequate  base  data  and  monitoring  system  prevent  the  formulation  of  any  specific  targets  for \nreducing  key  pollutants  such  as  carbon  monoxide,  nitrogen  oxides,  particulate  matter,  and  non-\nmethane  hydrocarbons.  Given  these  conditions,  SPCD  and  related  bodies  should  proceed  with \nplanning  a  vehicle  emission  action  plan.  They  should  cooperatively  (i)  undertake  a  pilot  motor \nvehicle emission inspection and maintenance program in the province, laying out the targets, the \norganization,  and  the  budget  with  a  time-bound  implementation  timetable;  (ii)  tailor  the  2000 \nNational Vehicle Emission Control Regulations to Sichuan conditions (such as the requirement for \nemission testing stickers to be placed in every vehicle meeting the standard); an environmental tax \ncould  be  applied  to  any  vehicles  entering  a  tollway  in  the  Chengdu  area  without  a  valid  and \ncompliant sticker; (iii) undertake a baseline air quality study; (iv) design a plan for the installation of \nliquefied petroleum gas and compressed natural gas filling sites,3 and for a faster conversion (from \npetrol)  of  buses,  taxis,  and  government  motor  vehicles;  (v)  fund  emission  testing  equipment  to \nestablish  the  SPCD  testing  facility,  which  should  be  replicated  at  various  locations;4   (vi)  legalize \nthe requirements for new engine technologies such as fuel injection and catalytic converters; and \n                                                 \n2  ADB.  1999. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Capacity Building in Traffic Safety, Planning \n\nand Management. Manila. \n\n3 There are 18 compressed natural gas fuelling stations in Chengdu and plans call for all petrol stations in Chengdu to \n\nhave compressed natural gas capabilities by 2005. \n\n4 One testing facility with four bays can inspect about 34,500 vehicles per year. \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n2. \n\nCoordination Approach and Action Plan \n\n(vii)  agree  on  an  action  plan  to  undertake  travel  demand  management  measures,  and  an \nintegrated  transport  and  land  use  planning  approach;  (viii)  modify  the  vehicle  testing  center,  or \ncreate  inspection  stations  along  the  expressway  to  provide  advice  to  the  road  users  to  facilitate \nimplementation of the program and create some funds.  \n \nImplementing  such  a  program  will  require  a  cooperative  effort  among  a  number  of \n8. \nagencies, jurisdictions, and community, as well as Government commitment and leadership.  The \nrecommended approach is to implement a pilot vehicle emission testing and certification program, \nfocusing  initially  on  diesel  trucks,  2  or  3  wheelers,  buses,  taxis,  and  all  government  vehicles;  the \nprogram  then  could  be  assessed  and  adapted  for  areawide  implementation.  The  pilot  program \ncould  include  (i)  identification  of  vehicle  type,  (ii)  establishment  of  vehicle  inspection  sites;  (iii) \nconstruction  of  more  compressed  natural  gas  filling  stations;  (iv)  public  awareness  campaign \nregarding the inspection timetable for vehicles, based on license plate numbers and widely indicate \neconomic  incentives,  e.g.  toll  reductions  for  certified  vehicles;  (v)  intensive  training  program  and \ncapacity  building  focusing  on  emission  testing,  data  analysis,  and  reporting;    (vi)  an  annual  air \nquality monitoring program; (vi)  media, NGO, and community involvement; and (vi) establishment \nof an integrated province emission council. \n \n \n \nAn  action  plan  is  required  to  promote  an  efficient  vehicle  emission  reduction  measures  in \n9. \nthe  province  and  in  the  project  area.  An  integrated  approach  may  be  adopted  to  facilitate  the \nimplementation of the action plan. Various departments such as SPCD, environment bureau, and \nSPSB  should  participate  in  implementation  of  the  plan.  Fuel  companies,  the  private  sector,  and \nNGO  groups  can  be  involved.  Modification  of  current  programs  of  the  environment  bureau  and \noptimization  of  resources  is  necessary  to  enhance  emissions  reduction  in  the  project  area. \nFormulation of a better fine system and other measures will generate some revenue to support the \nprogram. Modification of the vehicle-testing centers and inspection will also provide some funds to \nsupport the proposed program. \n \n10. \nA  vehicle  emissions  specialist  will  be  provided  under  the  consulting  services,  covering \nemissions strategy development, enforcement management, prevention measures, socioeconomic \ncost,  and  critical  issues  of  successful  emission  control  programs.  This  assistance  will  (i)  develop \ngeneral  provincial  vehicle  emissions  guidelines,  covering  all  key  issues;  and  (ii)  develop  a  time-\nbound action plan in Liangshan and Panzhihua. \n \nis  essential.  The \n11. \nenvironmental  protection  bureau  will  take  the  lead  in  implementing  the  action  plan,  provide  the \nnecessary services, and assign senior officials to ensure smooth implementation and coordination \nwith  all  parties.  Fuel  companies,  the  private  sector,  and  NGO  groups  may  also  be  involved. \nImplementation of the program will fulfil requirements of current ADB and Government initiatives to \nenhance  air  quality  and  minimize  greenhouse  and  global  effects.  Development  of  the  current \nvehicle  testing  centers  to  create  an  integrated  vehicle  testing  system  (both  safety  and  vehicle \nemissions) will be a cost-effective method to support the program. \n\nCoordination  between  SPCD,  environment  bureau,  and  SPSB, \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n51\n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n\n \n1. \nBackground. The feasibility study and the detailed measurement survey for the Project \nand  stakeholders  consultation  form  the  basis  for  preparing  a  resettlement  plan  (RP).  The \nexpressway component is expected to cause extensive impacts on land and buildings, while the \nlocal  road  component  is  expected  to  have  little  impact  as  works  will  be  on  the  existing \nalignment.  The  approach  adopted  to  satisfy  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  policy  on \ninvoluntary  resettlement  (ADB's  policy)  will  thus  be  different  for  each  component.  For  the \nexpressway  component,  a  full  RP  has  been  prepared.  The  RP  is  based  on  a  compensation \nstrategy following the 1998 Land Administration Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), \nrelevant provincial regulations, and the policy of ADB. \n \nAn  RP  will  not  be  prepared  for  the  local  road  upgrading  component.  However,  to \n2. \nguarantee  that  unforeseen  impacts  are  treated  in  accordance  with  ADB's  policy,  the  same \ncompensation  framework  for  expressway  impacts  will  be  applied  to  the  local  roads.  To \neffectively  inform  the  village  of  this  provision  and  document  eventual  impacts  of  any \nresettlement  effects  arising  from  this  component,  the  following  provisions  have  been \nestablished: (i) a shorter version of the RP detailing compensation policy and procedures will be \nmade available to all villages along the targeted local roads; (ii) if impacts occur, an impact data \nsheet detailing quantity, area, and compensation will be sent to ADB as soon as the impact is \nknown; and (iii) independent monitoring activities will also cover local roads. \n \n3. \nPolicy Framework. The RP outlines basic policy principles: (i) negative impacts will be \nminimized as much as possible, (ii) resettlement/compensation will be carried out to improve or \nat  least  restore  the  affected  people  to  preproject  living  standards,  (iii)  affected  people  will  be \nthoroughly informed and consulted on compensation options and the RP\u2019s design, (iv) affected \nassets  will  be  compensated  at  replacement  cost,  and  (v)  compensation  and  resettlement \nsubsidies will be provided in full prior to ground leveling and demolition. \n \n4. \nThe  RP  also  stipulates  generic  eligibility/entitlement  provisions  for  people  losing  land, \nhouses,  and  income,  and  provides  rehabilitation  subsidies.  Permanent  land  losses  are  dealt \nwith through land reallocation within village domains and through cash payments at rates 6\u201310 \ntimes  the  average  annual  output  value  (AAOV)  as  per  the  1998  Land  Administration  Law. \nTemporary land losses will be directly paid to the affected people at a rate corresponding to the \nAAOV. House losses will be directly paid to the affected people in cash at replacement cost free \nof demolition expenses and salvaged materials. Crop losses will be directly paid to the affected \npeople  in  cash  at  rates  corresponding  to  1  time  the  AAOV.  Affected  people  will  also  receive \nvarious  subsidies,  including  a  land  relocation  subsidy  of  4\u20136  times  the  AAOV;  a  resettlement \nsubsidy  to  be  directly  paid  to  each  resettled  household  for  transport  costs,  work  loss,  transfer \ncosts, medical expenses, and temporary housing; and a business loss allowance based on tax \ndeclarations  to  be  paid  to  each  person  so  affected  for  each  month  of  interruption  of  business \nactivities. \n \n5. \nThe  RP  indicates  detailed  compensation  provisions  for  each  affected  village.  These \ninclude  the  definition  of  AAOVs,  relative  land  compensation  and  resettlement  subsidies \nmultipliers,  and  entitlement  options  to  be  selected  on  the  basis  of  village  consultation  among \nvarious alternatives allowed by the law. \n \nImpact  Assessment.  According  to  the  detailed  measurement  survey  based  on  the \n6. \ndetailed  design  alignment,  the  project  expressway  will  involve  permanent  acquisition  of  825 \nhectares (ha) of land, including 372 ha of irrigated farmland, 195 ha of dry farmland, 34 ha of \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nresidential/service land, and 224 ha of others. Temporary land impacts amount to 117 ha. The \nProject will also require the demolition of 1,257 ha of houses and several public buildings for a \ntotal  of  429,481  square  meters  of  building  floor  space.  Approximately  11,000  people  (2,400 \nhouseholds) will be affected. Among these, 5,657 (1,208 households) and 383 (82 households) \nwill be affected by house and public building losses, respectively, and will be relocated.  \n \n7. \nResettlement  Planning  Process.  The  RP  impact  data  and  costs  have  a  high  level  of \nreliability  as  they  were  prepared  based  on  the  detailed  design  alignment  through  a  detailed \nmeasurement  survey.  The  survey  was  accompanied  by  a  review  of  the  village  compensation \nrates and options, a productive improvement plan for each village, and a rehabilitation plan for \nirrigation schemes. The results of the survey and the review was included in a resettlement plan \naddendum.  \n \n8. \nInstitutional  Responsibilities.  The  Sichuan  Provincial  Communications  Department \n(SPCD)  through  the  Sichuan  Panxi  Expressway  Company  Limited  (SPECL)  has  overall \nresponsibility  for  resettlement  planning  and  design  tasks.  Resettlement  implementation  and \nfinancing  responsibilities  will  rest  on  SPECL  through  the  local  governments.  Prefectures  and \ncounties  will  be  responsible  for  land  management  tasks,  asset  valuation,  consultation,  and \ndelivery of entitlements. Field tasks such as actual payment of entitlements, replacement land \nselection, and provision of livelihood support will be the responsibility of townships and villages. \n \n9. \nVulnerable  Groups.  Vulnerable  households,  defined  for  the  Project  as  the  \"welfare \npoor\"  will  receive  special  assistance  for  house  relocation/reconstruction,  and  will  be  given \nparticular  attention  for  postproject  rehabilitation.  Specific  livelihood  improvement  strategies  for \ntheir benefit are currently under study. These strategies may include provision of employment in \nproject activities and training will be provided.  \n \n10. \nDisclosure and Public Consultation. RP preparation was based on an intensive public \nconsultation process carried out through questionnaires and community meetings, and involving \nimplementing  agencies,  local  governments,  and  affected  people.  An  information  booklet \nsummarizing  the  resettlement  plan  entitlements  policy  provisions  was  released  to  all  affected \npeople through local government offices on 6 February 2002. A summary resettlement plan and \na full resettlement plan were disclosed to the public through ADB\u2019s web site on 5 March 2002 \nand 8 May 2002, respectively.  \n \n11. \nGrievance  Procedures.  Complaints  and  grievance  procedures  are  established  in  the \nresettlement plan. Grievances will be first lodged with the village committee. If no agreement is \nreached  within  2  weeks,  the  complainant  will  have  1  month  to  raise  the  case  with  the  county \nland  administration  bureau  or  building  demolition  office.  If  still  unresolved  within  2  weeks,  the \ncase can be sent to the subproject office. Final appeal will be available in civil courts. \n \n12.  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  SPECL  will  establish, \nlocal \ngovernments,  a  monthly  reporting  system  involving  resettlement  staff  at  the  county  and \ntownship  level.  External  monitoring  will  be  assigned  to  an  independent  agency.  Quarterly \ninternal monitoring reports will be sent to ADB. External monitoring reports will be submitted to \nADB twice a year and will include a final evaluation report. \n\nin  collaboration  with \n\n\fSTAKEHOLDER PARTICIPATION AND CONSULTATIONS \n\n   Appendix 8  \n\n53\n\n \n\nAgency \n\n \n\nDesign \nInstitute \n\nDate \n\n \n\nParticipants \n\n \n\nMarch 1997  Farmers, local \n\n12 \n\nNumber of \nPeople \n\n \n\ngovernment/ \nagency \nrepresentatives \n\nResponses \n\n \n\n1.
