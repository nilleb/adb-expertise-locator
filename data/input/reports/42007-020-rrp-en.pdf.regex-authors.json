THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Development Program, and \n(ii) proposed policy-based loans to the Republic of Uzbekistan for subprogram 1 of the Small and \nMedium-Sized Enterprises Development Program. The report also describes proposed technical \nassistance (TA) for Support to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Development Program, and \nif the Board approves the proposed loans, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The proposed program will improve the enabling environment for small and medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs), increasing their resilience to future economic shocks and allowing them to \nbecome drivers of private sector-led, diversified economic growth with high-value-added job \ncreation. The program is a systematic next step in the support of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) for SMEs in Uzbekistan, which commenced in 1996 and has focused primarily on access \nto finance and improving the financial and technical capacity of participating financial institutions \nto  better  serve  micro  and  small  enterprises.  Cross-sector  reforms  under  the  program\u2014\ncomprising  simplifying  and  streamlining  the  regulatory,  policy,  and  institutional  framework, \ndiversifying formal financial instruments, easing barriers to trade and competitiveness, increasing \ndigitalization, and aligning skills development with market needs\u2014are aimed at creating a more \ncost-effective and efficient operating and commercial environment for SMEs. In parallel with \ncountercyclical measures to combat the economic impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-\n19), key structural reforms have continued with a prudent overall macroeconomic stance. The \nprogram is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Uzbekistan, 2021\u20132023 and \nis aligned with relevant ADB strategies and programs including Strategy 2030 (para. 14).  \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  The Government of Uzbekistan is accelerating its transition toward a market economy with \nthe adoption of the National Action Strategy on Five Priority Development Areas (Strategy 2017\u2013\n2021) and follow-on Roadmap of Reforms.1 The contribution of SMEs to Uzbekistan\u2019s gross \ndomestic product (GDP) growth and formal and informal employment has been substantial. The \ngovernment is keen to build on these gains and make SMEs even more integral to its policy \nobjectives of diversifying the economy, creating value-added employment, reducing the informal \neconomy, and creating effective links with regional and global value chains. Pillar 3.4 of Strategy \n2017\u20132021 is focused on institutional and structural reforms to reduce the state\u2019s presence in the \neconomy and create a favorable environment for small businesses and private entrepreneurship. \n \n4.  COVID-19  impact  and  macroeconomic  policy  management.  COVID-19  severely \nimpacted Uzbekistan\u2019s economy in the early part of 2020, but the impact was moderated by timely \ncontainment and support measures. GDP growth, which averaged 6.8% during 2010\u20132019, \nslowed to 1.6%\u2014well below the pre-COVID-19 forecast of 6%.2 Economic recessions in its main \ntrading partners led to a 17% decline in imports from Kazakhstan in 2020. However, gold exports \nsurged by 18%. Travel restrictions impacted migrant workers working in the Russian Federation \n \n1  National Action Strategy on Five Priority Development Areas 2017\u20122021 (Presidential Decree No. 4947 dated 7 \nFebruary 2017); and Roadmap of Reforms (2019\u20122021) (Presidential Decree No. UP-5614 dated 8 January 2019). \n2  International Monetary Fund (IMF). 2021.

Uzbekistan has maintained a largely conservative fiscal and debt policy since \n2010, as the economy has been driven by growth in industry, services, commodity exports, and \nforeign investment. Fiscal policy in 2020 and 2021 has been more accommodative to support \nCOVID-19 health and economic measures (para. 26), but the government\u2019s past commitment to \nsound macroeconomic policies, including fiscal sustainability, is expected to continue. Monetary \npolicy remains focused on lowering inflation (targeting 5% by 2023), with exchange rate flexibility. \nFor 2021, the debt-to-GDP ceiling has been set at 60% and the annual borrowing limit on state \nexternal debt has been set at $5 billion. The total public and publicly guaranteed debt-to-GDP \nratio increased from 29.3% in 2019, to 37.8% in 2020, to 40.4% in 2021, but the risk of debt \ndistress is low because of low rollover risk and healthy foreign exchange reserves.4 \n \n5.  Contribution  of  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  to  economic  growth  and \npoverty reduction. Uzbekistan\u2019s economic expansion during 2010\u20132019 has been concomitant \nwith the rising incomes of SMEs and microenterprises, regular minimum wage increases, and \nimproved social safety nets to cushion the impacts of structural reforms that have been underway \nsince 2017. The national poverty rate declined from 25.8% in 2005 to 11% in 2019. Supported by \ngovernment policies to develop the private sector and improve the country\u2019s business climate, the \nrole  of  SMEs  in  the  economy  has  become  significant,  particularly  in  terms  of  providing \nemployment.5 About 411,203 SMEs were registered and active at the end of 2020, up 4% year-\non-year. SMEs accounted for 54% of GDP in 2019\u20132020, with sectoral breakdown being 97% in \nagriculture, 82% in trade, 72% in construction, and 52% in services. SMEs accounted for 27% of \nexports  and  62%  of  imports.  Their  share  of  investment  was  40%.6 SMEs  are  the  largest \nemployers, providing 78% of formal and informal jobs combined in 2018, compared with 50% in \n2000.7 In 2020, of SUM48.4 trillion in credit extended to small businesses, SUM6.1 trillion was \nchanneled through the Family Entrepreneurship Development Program to provide low-cost credit \nto spur regional micro-entrepreneurship.8 SMEs are critical for achieving and sustaining the \ngrowth forecast of above 5% annually for the 2021\u20132024 period and for boosting employment. \n \n6.  COVID-19  impact  on  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  and  government \nresponse. In Uzbekistan, the economic shock triggered by COVID-19 affected SMEs through lost \nsales and revenues and depleted cash reserves. Tourism, hospitality, catering, and transport \nexperienced the sharpest drop in demand and revenue, leading to suspension of operations, \nfrequent involuntary leaves (especially unpaid), layoffs, and salary cuts (for those who remained \nemployed). Tourism, a key SME segment, saw only 1.5 million international arrivals in 2020\u2014a \n77% decline compared with 2019.9 Women, comprising 54% of workers in catering and trade \nSMEs, and 46% of workers in agriculture and forestry, have been substantially affected. In \n \n3  According to government statistics, about 2.6 million Uzbek migrant workers work in construction and agriculture in \nthe Russian Federation and Kazakhstan. Net inflows of primary and secondary income fell from $6.2 billion in 2019 \nto $4.9 billion in 2020. \n4  Government of Uzbekistan, Ministry of Finance. 2021 (April). Newsletter No. 20. Tashkent. By end-2020, external \ndebt increased by $5.4 billion, or 34.4%, compared with the beginning of the year and accounted for $21.1 billion, or \n36.5% of GDP. \n5  Microenterprises comprise 91.8% of all registered businesses and small firms make up about 8.2% (18,900 units). \nD.

Reforms  to  support  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  and  continuing \nconstraints. Since 2017, Uzbekistan has been undertaking reforms to improve the enabling \nenvironment for private sector development, including SMEs. Commencing in January 2019, tax \nsystem distortions that unfairly burdened small businesses were removed. Tax rates for personal \nincome, corporate income, and payroll were unified for both large and small firms. Tax rates for \nsmall firms were reduced (unified tax rate from 5% to 4%, property tax rate from 5% to 2%, and \ndividend tax from 10% to 5%). Tax policy and administration reforms have resulted in 30,000 new \nfirms  entering  the  standard  tax  regime  and  boosting  tax  revenue  in  2019.11 To  support \nentrepreneurship, the value-added tax rate was reduced from 20% to 15% in October 2019.12 To \nease  cross-border  trade,  risk-based  inspections  have  been  instituted  and  documentation \nrequirements for imports simplified. To reduce SMEs\u2019 transport costs, since May 2019 exporters \nhave been compensated by the Government up to 50% of their rail transport costs, and from \nFebruary 2020 this has also applied to road and air transport.13 Strategy 2017\u20132021 and related \ndecrees have identified reform areas to facilitate SME development and increase the resilience \nof SMEs to future shocks in the context of the overall thrust to diversify the economy and drive \ngrowth through the private sector.14 The program will help the government identify and implement \nkey actions within those reforms areas.15 \n \n8.  Lack of diversified financing instruments. SMEs in Uzbekistan lack access to the \ndiversified formal financial instruments needed for various phases of the SME life cycle. Although \nmost widely used, bank finance is marked by high interest rates (about 19%), and only about one-\nquarter of SMEs have a bank loan. More than 80% of SMEs finance their working capital and \ninvestment needs through internally generated funds or personal sources. Banks see SMEs as a \nhigh credit risk and have limited expertise in evaluating SME loans. Coupled with difficulties in \nenforcing creditors' rights, this higher risk perception translates into high collateral requirements \n(despite  sufficient  cash  flow  or  purchase  orders)  and  complex  application  procedures, \ndisproportionately affecting women\u2019s businesses. Data from the Collateral Registry indicate that \nabout 94% of loans issued since 2015 have been secured by hard collateral while 4% have been \nsecured by cash deposits. Despite a 25% expansion in access to bank credit, the share of loans \nto women\u2019s small businesses shrank from 11.6% in 2018 to 8.1% in 2019 (the share of all loans \n \n10 ADB. 2020.

These and other \ninnovative  mechanisms  have  become  even  more  necessary  with  the  Basel  III  regulatory \nframework further constraining start-up and SME capital access.18 Credit bureaus can reduce \ninformation asymmetries\u2014increasing SMEs\u2019 access to credit at lower interest rates\u2014and serve \nas a powerful tool for regulators in bank supervision and credit risk monitoring.19 As Uzbekistan\u2019s \ncapital markets and related regulatory and supervisory framework develop, SMEs' access to \nmarkets could be facilitated through simplified disclosure and listing requirements, removal of the \ncascading effect of dividend tax, and reducing witholding tax on dividends being supported under \nthe Financial Markets Development Program.20 \n \n9.  Low  financial  literacy  of  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises.  Most  SMEs  in \nUzbekistan have low financial literacy, adversely impacting sound business decisions and long-\nterm sustainability. Credible business plans and appropriate financial reporting  are lacking. \nTraining in bookkeeping and financial statement and cash-flow analysis is critical for SMEs to take \nadvantage of risk-assessed business opportunities and minimize information gaps to access \nappropriate sources of finance. The Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) is implementing programs \nto improve the financial literacy of the population and increase uptake of digital financial services. \n \n10.  High institutional and administrative costs. The government has simplified some \nbusiness-related legislation, streamlined business registration and tax payment procedures, and \nexpanded e-government services (para. 7). However, institutional and administrative burdens \ncontinue to impose costs on doing business for SMEs. Obtaining permits and licenses, including \nconstruction permits, is costlier for small firms than for large firms.21 It can take up to 246 days to \nobtain a construction permit, compared with an average of 170 days in other Central Asian \ncountries. Most SMEs remain microentrepreneurs, operating in low-value-added sectors, and are \n \nnot registered (footnote 5). Reducing the number of permits and licenses required by 30% could \nsave SMEs at least SUM125 billion a year, while digitalization using a single e-portal system \nwould save at least SUM13 billion in printing costs and make the registration process more \nefficient and expedient.22 A single point of contact would prevent overlapping of government \nagencies' services, including credit lines, training, and advisory services. In the absence of an \nSME definition consistent with international best practices, financial and non-financial support \ntargeted towards SMEs will be ineffective and inefficient. \n \n16 CBU. 2020.

Low human capital development, including entrepreneurial skills. With almost 60% \nof the population of Uzbekistan under the age of 30 and with the country's economic structure in \ntransition from labor-intensive agriculture to services and industry (including technology-focused \nindustries), there is a strong need for diversified job creation. Technical and vocational education \nand training (TVET) needs to be aligned with the needs of the labor market to increase the \ncompetitiveness of businesses. TVET in Uzbekistan largely lacks industry involvement in the \narticulation of skills demand, development of competency standards and curricula, delivery of \ntraining, and assessment and certification. Teachers and masters need to update their knowledge \nand experience related to the industry practices and the TVET institutions are often lacking \nupdated training equipment and facilities. Enterprise surveys, and occupational demand and \nsupply outlooks to better guide TVET, are also lacking. Labor market information systems are still \nat the initial stage of development, hindering the job search and skills signaling process. Skills \nshortages  are  prevalent  in  construction,  transport,  and  information  and  communications \ntechnology (ICT)\u2014the key growth sectors of the economy among others.23 Skilled human capital \nwill  be  critical  to  increasing  enterprise  productivity,  creating  higher-value-added  jobs,  and \nreducing regional inequalities.24 Industry\u2013skills consultative bodies (e.g., sector skills councils) \nare  being  established  under  the  government\u2019s  very  recent  reform  request.    Quality  sex-\ndisaggregated data will help address the institutional, financial, and legal barriers to training \nwomen entrepreneurs. Labor market information systems are needed to better link job seekers \nwith employers and ensure that newly acquired skills translate into employment and productivity. \nSkills development in the country requires coordination among  various government and sectoral \nplayers, including the private sector,  to link TVET and training programs to market needs.25 A \ndedicated skills development window under the State Unemployment Fund would also be a useful \nplatform to support this coordination.  \n \n12.  Underexploited benefits of digitalization. Digitalization tools, services, and practices \nhelp overcome the size-related barriers that SMEs typically face in innovating, growing, linking to \nglobal value chains, and ultimately becoming more productive and competitive. Because most \nSMEs in Uzbekistan are unaware of the range of digital possibilities open to them, their digital \nuptake is largely confined to basic services\u2014e.g., a website, or use of social media for business \npurposes. Most SMEs lack the skills to identify technology and financing solutions to help them \ngrow.  The  COVID-19  outbreak  has  shown  how  digitalization  can  be leveraged to  develop \ninnovative  and  more  resilient  business  models.  Digitalization  has  the  potential  to  reduce \ntransaction costs and lower entry barriers for SMEs and microenterprises.26 Training programs \nfor  SMEs  on  the  use  of  digital  technology  for  business  development  complemented  by \ngovernment-funded  high-speed  telecommunication  infrastructure  will  promote  SME \ndigitalization.27 The digital transition\u2014both for SMEs and for the country as whole\u2014must go hand \nin hand with awareness-raising and adoption of robust regulatory frameworks, especially with \n \nrespect to cybersecurity and data protection. Financial technology (fintech) regulatory sandboxes \nwill  enable  financial  institutions  and  fintech  players  to  experiment  with  innovative  financial \nproducts and services, including for SMEs.

Uzbekistan has the fourth largest gender \ngap in the index, with men 21% more likely to have access to mobile devices than women. \n \n13.  Weak trade facilitation infrastructure. As a double landlocked country, Uzbekistan is \nhandicapped by the policies and infrastructure of its neighbors.28The time and monetary costs for \nbusinesses to comply with documentary and border requirements for exports ($570) and imports \n($520) are higher than for most countries in the region. Streamlining and digitalizing trade \nfacilitation infrastructure and support services under a single window will improve efficiency for \nthe entire trade supply chain. Horticulture, one of Uzbekistan\u2019s key growth segments, provides \nopportunities for export diversification, but SMEs know little about potential export markets outside \nof Central Asia.29 The Export Promotion Agency provides information on consumer preferences, \nproduct quality standards, and labeling, but does not help SMEs translate this information into \nviable sales and marketing plans or facilitate transactions. The national system of technical \nregulation, standardization, certification, and metrology is outdated, making it difficult for SMEs to \nimprove product quality and enter world markets. A certificate of conformity and a sanitary\u2013\nepidemiological conclusion is required for nearly 34,000 types of products. The trade facilitation \necosystem  (comprising  testing,  certification,  sanitary  and  phytosanitary  measures,  product \nlabeling,  and  country  rules  of  origin)  requires  strengthening.  The  Export  Credit  Agency \n(UzbekInvest), set up in 2020, is expected to support SMEs that do not have the reputation or \ncapital to access foreign markets.  \n \n14.  The program supports private sector-led diversified economic growth, with SMEs and \nentrepreneurship at the forefront (para. 1), and is in line with ADB\u2019s country operations business \nplan for Uzbekistan, 2021\u20132023 and country partnership strategy for Uzbekistan, 2019\u20132023.30 It \nis aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational priorities 1, 2, and 6, which support development \nof SMEs, quality job creation, gender equality, and strengthening institutional capacity and \ngovernance.31  \n \nB.  Policy Reform, ADB\u2019s Value Addition, and Sustainability \n \n15.  Programmatic approach. Given that improving the SME enabling environment requires \ntime-bound reforms in parallel across sectors, the two-subprogram programmatic approach is \nmost suited for the program. The approach (i) facilitates effective coordination among multiple \nagencies to ensure that subprograms 1 and 2, individually and collectively, achieve meaningful \nimprovements through well-deliberated and government-driven reforms; (ii) where warranted, \nallows follow-up reforms under subprogram 2 as well as continued implementation of reforms \nstarted in subprogram 1; (iii) allows time to build the institutional capacity of key agencies, \nparticularly the Entrepreneurship Development Agency (EDA) and the State Fund (which has \nbeen  revamped  in  2021)  to  help  them  become  effective  host  institutions  for  future  SME \ninterventions; and (iv) protects the long-term reform agenda by providing space for recalibration \nof reforms (policy actions) if warranted based on the government\u2019s evolving private sector and \nSME development strategy and macroeconomic conditions. Subprogram 1 has helped address \n \n28  The Economist. The Inclusive Internet Index (accessed 26 June 2021).

All actions have been completed and \nverified. Under subprogram 2 (indicative), (i) the regulatory framework for PCGs and other \ninnovative financial instruments will be strengthened by expanding the mandate of CBU to include \nregulation of these mechanisms; (ii) the government will operationalize a national venture capital \nfund with an operational and governance framework based on international good practices to \nexpand the forms of finance available to SMEs and to develop a private equity market in \nUzbekistan; (iii) the government will approve by-laws and regulations for effective implementation \nof credit information sharing with the credit bureau by legal entities and individuals; and (iv) CBU \nwill mandate financial institutions to report on sex-disaggregated data for their entire portfolios, \nincluding guarantees to enable better targeting of financial support for women\u2019s businesses. \n \n17.

Reform area 3: Trade facilitation and digitalization environment improved. The \nactions under this reform area aim to promote export competitiveness, diversify export products \nand markets, and increase and accelerate ICT uptake in SMEs. Under subprogram 1, (i) to lower \ntrade transaction costs, especially for small businesses, the government adopted Resolution 6240 \nestablishing  the  agency  for  technical  regulation  and  implemented  risk-based  control  over \nconformity  of  imported  products;  (ii)  COM  complied  with  all  economic  and  governance \nrequirements and obtained the Generalized System of Preferences plus (GSP+) trade beneficiary \nstatus of the European Union (EU) to increase and diversify exports to the EU (and increase \noverall  export  revenue);  (iii)  the  Ministry  of  Information  and  Communications  Technology \nimplemented  Government  Resolution  No.  UP-6079  and  established  133  regional  digital \ncompetency training centers, with women trainees comprising 25% of the total (28,800) trainees \nto catalyze ICT SMEs and support digitalization of SMEs; and (iv) EDA implemented Government \nResolution No. 5088 and provided interest subsidies to youth entrepreneurs to increase and \nexpedite digitalization of SMEs by developing open-source digital tools and online platforms for \nSMEs.

Reform area 4: Skills development and market needs aligned. The actions under this \nreform area aim to better align technical and vocational education and skills training with market \nneeds to increase employability and productivity. Under subprogram 1, to facilitate industry-\nfocused TVET including through public\u2013private partnerships, the Ministry of Employment and \nLabor Relations (i) earmarked SUM44.5 billion from the State Employment Promotion Fund for \nskills training in 2021, (ii) accredited 14 regional nongovernment skills training centers (Ishga \nmarhamt) for women and youth with prospective employers involved in curriculum development \n \n ", "9 \nand training, and (iii) incentivized training by reimbursing 70% of the training cost from the State \nEmployment Promotion Fund. All actions have been completed and verified.

ADB\u2019s value addition. The program is (i) is a systematic next step in ADB\u2019s support for \nMSMEs in Uzbekistan, which has focused on financial intermediation interventions (para. 2); (ii) \ncreating a coordination platform (for agencies and development partners) for implementing cross \nsectoral  reforms  necessary  for  SME  development;  (iii)  implementing  key  aspects  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s private sector development strategy; (iv) supporting the implementation of the \ncountry\u2019s Digital Uzbekistan\u20132030 strategy (2021); (v) supporting the implementation of the green \neconomy transition strategy, including by catalyzing uptake of green and digital technologies in \nSMEs; (vi) creating conditions for innovation (e.g., national venture capital fund, regulatory \nsandbox for fintech) to support SMEs; and (vii) creating a replicable program that could also \nbenefit other countries in the region. \n \n21.  Lessons incorporated. Key lessons from ADB\u2019s past interventions in the SME sector, \nincluding in Uzbekistan, have been incorporated in the program. Access to finance is just one of \nseveral key constraints to SME development, and financial intermediation loans should be \ncomplemented with policy-based operations to catalyze critical sector, policy, and institutional \nreforms, even for financial intermediation loans to have their intended development impact. An \nADB Institute SME study and an Independent Evaluation Department synthesis note reiterate that \na program cluster approach and policy and regulatory measures that complement access to \nfinance with improving the enabling environment  contribute to sustained and optimal SME \n \ndevelopment.34 The program has been coordinated with the sovereign Skills Development for a \nModern Economy Project (for reform area 4),35 and with the nonsovereign Expanding Access to \nCredit  for  Micro,  Small  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprise  and  Agriculture  Borrowers  Project.36 \nAnchoring the policy actions in the government\u2019s long-term development strategy, which focuses \non private sector and SME-led economic growth, will help ensure the sustainability of reforms. \n \n22.

Expected Outcome of the Reforms \n \n23.  The program is aligned with the country\u2019s overarching development objective of increased \nemployment (footnote 1). The expected outcome is the enabling environment for SME growth, \ndiversification,  and  high-value-added  job  creation  improved.  The  links  between  the  reform \nproposals and the outcome can be illustrated as follows: (i) for reform area 1, diversifying the \nrange of financial instruments will help expand the operations of more than 185,000 credit-\nconstrained SMEs; (ii) for reform area 2, reducing the number of permits and licenses that SMEs \nneed to obtain from the government and streamlining SME support services will improve the \nviability of small businesses by saving nearly SUM125 billion per year in unwarranted operational \ncosts, and will also incentivize formalization (i.e., registration); (iii) for reform area 3, accrediting \ntesting laboratories internationally, harmonizing outdated technical regulations and standards with \ninternational norms, and effectively utilizing the EU\u2019s GSP+ trade status will increase SME exports \nby about $30 million in 2021 and create related jobs across the country; and (iv) for reform area \n4, better alignment of TVET with market needs will improve the employability of about 10,000 \ntrainees and professionals, attending professional training centers and digital competency training \ncenters  for  value-added  private  sector  SME  jobs  per  year,  including  women  and  women \nentrepreneurs. Overall, the program i.e., subprogram 1, will increase SMEs\u2019 share in GDP by $30 \nmillion and create nearly 13,700 jobs in 2021. 38 \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n24.  ADB proposes to provide an estimated $200 million through a policy-based programmatic \napproach, divided equally between two subprograms, from its regular ordinary capital resources \n(concessional  and  regular  loans).  The  $100  million  for  subprogram  1  is  based  on  the \ngovernment\u2019s indicative development financing needs in 2021 (para. 25). The government has \nrequested (i) a concessional loan of $80 million; and (ii) a regular loan equivalent to $20 million \ndenominated in SUM (using the applicable exchange rate on the date of loan negotiations) from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, to help finance subprogram 1. The concessional loan will have \na 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; an interest rate of 2% per year during the \ngrace  period  and  thereafter;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft \nconcessional loan agreement. The regular loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period \nof 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft regular loan agreement. Given uncertainty over the \ncontinuing availability of local currency funding for the project, no conversion fee will be charged \nto the borrower if it converts to United States dollar at the termination of any SUM funding period. \n \n37 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n38 Program Economic Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "11 \nBased on the straight-line repayment method, the average maturity is 9.25 years, and there is no \nmaturity premium payable to ADB.39 \n \n25.  Estimated  development  financing  needs.  The  government\u2019s  indicative  financing \nrequirements  in  2021  are  estimated  at  $3.36  billion.  The  2021  budget  maintains  an \naccommodative fiscal policy, with a fiscal deficit of up to 5.5% of GDP, to ensure adequate \nresourcing of health care systems, vaccine purchases, and expansion of social assistance for \nCOVID-19. The government proposes to finance its requirements from internal and external \nsources, including borrowings from international financial institutions, eurobonds, and domestic \nsecurities (Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Financing Needs and Support for 2021 \n($ million) \nItem  Amount \nGross financing requirement  3,359.0 \nGross domestic financinga  706.0 \nGross external financing  2,653.0 \n \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s programmed policy-based \nloans \nFinancial Markets Development Program, Subprogram 1  100.0 \nSmall and Medium-Sized Enterprises Development  100.0 \nProgram, Subprogram 1 \nWorld Bank  500.0 \nJapan International Cooperation Agency  150.0 \nEurobonds  850.0 \nSupport from other international financial institutions and  953.0 \nbilateral development partners \nOf which, bilateral loans  270.0 \na  Domestic financing is from deposits at the Central Bank of Uzbekistan and state-owned banks ($500 million), \ndomestic securities ($187 million), and privatization proceeds ($19 million).  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s  public  debt  sustainability  analysis  for  Uzbekistan  shows  overall  debt  to  be \nsustainable and at low risk of debt distress, even in the post\u2013COVID-19 scenario.40 These findings \nare corroborated by the debt sustainability analysis of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) \nunder its April 2021 Article IV consultations report (footnote 2) and recent assessment letter.41 \nThe total public and publicly guaranteed debt-to-GDP ratio increased from 29.3% in 2019 to \n37.8% in 2020 because of COVID-19-related health and economic support measures. According \nto ADB\u2019s analysis, the public debt-to-GDP ratio (including both internal and external debt and \npublic guarantees) is projected to increase to 42.9% in 2021 before declining to 42.6% in 2022 \nand to 41.0% by 2024. With most debt comprising long-term concessional loans and a strong \nforeign exchange reserves position ($35.5 billion, as of June 1, 2021), Uzbekistan\u2019s debt is at low \nrisk of distress. The government\u2019s commitment to sound macroeconomic policies, including fiscal \nsustainability, is continuing. Public financial management (PFM) is being strengthened: (i) with \nmost extra-budgetary funds, externally financed expenditures, and the Fund for Reconstruction \nand Development incorporated into the budget; and (ii) a debt ceiling included in the budget law, \nwherein for 2021 a debt-to-GDP ceiling of 60% and an annual limit of $5 billion on state external \n \n39 The development policy letter is in Appendix 3. \n40 Debt Sustainability Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n41 International Monetary Fund Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "12 \nborrowings have been set.42 Policy dialogue on macroeconomic analysis and fiscal projections \nhas been coordinated online with the IMF. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n27.  The MOF will be the executing agency. EDA, the State Fund, MOF, CBU, the Ministry of \nEmployment and Labor Relations, and the Ministry of Investment and Foreign Trade will be the \nkey implementing agencies. The proceeds of the policy-based loan will be withdrawn following \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time).43 The program will \nbe implemented over two subprograms, with subprogram 1 implemented from January 2021 to \nNovember 2021, and subprogram 2 from December 2021 to December 2023. \n \nIII.  ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n28.  ADB will provide TA to mitigate key risks to program implementation and maximize \nprogram impact. The TA will have four outputs. Output 1 will strengthen the operation and \ngovernance of the credit guarantee scheme under the State Fund, including developing eligibility \ncriteria  for  participating  financial  institutions,  a  risk  management  framework,  operational \nprocedures, and a guarantee pricing policy. Output 2 will improve the operations and strengthen \nthe capacity of the EDA to provide streamlined financial and non-financial support for SME \ndevelopment, including collection and analysis of sex-disaggregated data and skills surveys. \nOutput 3 will (i) promote uptake of digitalization and green technologies by SMEs by supporting \nthe Department of Non-Financial Support to Entrepreneurship (under EDA) to introduce digital \nsolutions for the SME sector, (ii) support methods to improve SME business functions through \ndigitalization, (iii) enhance the digital financial literacy of SMEs, and (iv) design and implement \nfinancial support mechanisms for the State Fund to fund green technology investments by SMEs.  \nOutput 4 will support the MOF to develop an action plan for SMEs to implement IFRS. 44 The TA \nis estimated to cost $265,000, of which $250,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 7). The government will provide counterpart support in \nthe form of staff, office accommodation, inter-agency coordination, and other in-kind contributions. \nThe TA will be administered by ADB. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n29.  Economic. Uzbekistan's economy, post-COVID-19 economic recovery and sustained \nresilient economic growth is dependent on the performance of SMEs (para. 5). Overall, program \nreforms will help generate nearly 13,700 additional jobs. Greater access to different financing \ninstruments will add value for 185,041 credit-constrained SMEs. Streamlining and simplifying \nadministrative procedures and regulatory and tax burdens will result in savings for SMEs of at \nleast $11.9 million (SUM125 billion) each year. Digitalization of government support services to \nSMEs using a single e-portal system will save at least $1.2 million (SUM13 billion) in operational \ncosts for SMEs annually. Enhancing the capacity of the single window digital information system, \ncombined with simplification of export-related clearance processes and international accreditation \nof testing laboratories, will improve export competitiveness, enable Uzbek SMEs to capitalize on \nthe EU\u2019s GSP+ trade status, and help increase SMEs\u2019 trade by $30 million in 2021. Creation of a \ndigital learning environment through state-subsidized regional digital training centers will help \nincrease the digital economy\u2019s contribution to Uzbekistan\u2019s GDP, which was only 2.2% as of 2020. \n \n42 Ministry of Finance. 2020.

Poverty and social. The poverty rate rose to 9.0% in 2020, from the pre-COVID-19 \nprojection of 7.4% (using the World Bank\u2019s $3.20 a day threshold for lower middle-income \ncountries).45 According to some national estimates, 12%\u201315% of the population (4 million to \n5 million people) live in poverty.46 SME development is a key driver of economic growth and \npoverty reduction. MSMEs in Uzbekistan provide 78% of the formal and informal jobs in the \neconomy  and  their  share  of  labor  income  (income  of  employees  and  income  from  self-\nemployment) comprised 69.3% of the total income of the population in 2020. 47 The economic \nimpact of COVID-19 has highlighted the need to support the SME sector, which is the main driver \nof employment and GDP growth. The reforms to improve the enabling environment for SMEs \nunder the program will help create jobs and increase incomes. Skills training through accredited \ntraining programs and centers will increase employability, especially for women and youth. \n \n31.  Gender. Women owned 24% of SMEs as of 2020, but their share of SME loans is less \nthan 10%. Women SME workers have been more affected than men by COVID-19 because \nwomen comprise 54% of the workers in the hardest hit sectors of catering and trade.

The program, which is classified \neffective gender mainstreaming, includes policy actions to ensure women\u2019s participation as \nbeneficiaries and decision makers. Notable policy actions in this regard include: (i) at least 25% \nof the PCGs  issued by the State Fund must go to women\u2019s businesses (i.e., owned by women \nor have a workforce that is majority women) to improve their access to bank credit; (ii) the State \nFund and EDA are required to collect and systematically analyze sex-disaggregated data to \nensure better targeting of government financial and non-financial support for women\u2019s small \nbusinesses; (iii) hiring female technical staff in EDA\u2019s data collection and analyzing department \nwill ensure that women\u2019s representation in technical work and decision making; (iv) the regional \ndigital competency training centers will ensure that women and female entrepreneurs constitute \nat least 25% of the trainees, thereby increasing the employability of women in a key growth area \nof the economy; and (v) the establishment of 14 accredited regional skills training centers for \nwomen and youth (Ishga marhamt), with representation from prospective employers and training \ncosts subsidized by the State Fund for Unemployment, will improve the employability of women \n(and youth). \n \n32.  Governance.  ADB  staff  conducted  a  governance  risk  assessment  in  line  with  the \nGuidelines for Implementing ADB\u2019s Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan.48 Risks \nidentified that could affect reform momentum and timely implementation of policy actions under \nthe program include (i) a serious resurgence of COVID-19 infections leads the government to \nprioritize the health sector at the expense of SME reform, and (ii) weak capacities and lack of \ncoordination between the executing agency and implementing agencies. PFM is deemed reliable \nin  budget  credibility,  debt  management,  and  treasury  functions,  but  weaknesses  exist  in \ntransparency, public participation, off-budget funding, internal audit, and external audit.
