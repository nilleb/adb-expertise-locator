The  report  also \ndescribes the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the European Union (EU) for \nthe Sustainable Rural Infrastructure and Watershed Management Sector Project, and if the Board \napproves the proposed loan and grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, \napprove the administration of the EU grant.  \n \n2. \nThe  project  will  improve  rural  incomes  from  market-driven  diversified  farm  output, \nwatershed  health,  and  community  nutrition  in the four  northern  provinces  (FNP)  of  Houaphan, \nLouangphabang, Xaignabouli, and Xiangkhouang. It will (i) promote diversification into dry season \nhigh-value crops (HVCs), improve the yields of wet season rice by providing irrigation and access; \n(ii)  protect  watershed ecological  services;  and  (iii)  improve  nutrition. The project  contributes to \ngovernment policy goals for food security, economic growth, and natural resource conservation.1  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe Lao PDR\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 7.7% during 2010\u20132017, \nbut its Human Development Index ranking (139th out of 189 countries) remains low.2 The benefits \nof growth are distributed unevenly, with the poorest quintile sharing only 7.6% of the gross national \nincome.  Rapid  urbanization,  with  40%  of  the  population  living  in  urban  areas,  is  leading  to  a \n\u201cfeminization\u201d  of  rural  areas  as  males  seek  work  in  urban  areas.  During  2005\u22122015,  the \npopulations of Houaphan and Xiangkhouang fell by 10%, the highest decline in the Lao PDR. The \npoverty incidence was 23% nationwide in 2012, but 29% for rural areas.3 Headcount poverty in \nthe  northern  region  is  three  times  higher  in  rural  areas  than  urban  areas.  Poverty  in  the  FNP \nranges  from  20%  in  Xiangkhouang  to  37%  in  Houaphan,  and  is  due  to  low  returns  from  rice \nfarming, limited skills, and lack of investment resources. It creates vulnerability to commodity price \nvolatility, loss of land through concessions, and ill health from poor diets and sanitation. Lao PDR \nremains an agrarian economy. Agriculture contributes 16% of GDP and engages more than 65% \nof  the  population,  more  than  half  of  whom  are  women.4  Rice  accounts  for  70%  of  agricultural \noutput, reaching  4  million  tons  in  2014.5 Only  10%  of the  land  is  arable because  the  terrain  is \nmountainous.  Agriculture  in  the  FNP  is  typified  by  fragmented  production  systems,  high  input \ncosts, and weak aggregate surplus production.  \n \n4. \nRural  development  is  a  government  priority.  The  Five-Year  National  Socioeconomic \nDevelopment Plan VIII, 2016\u20132020; the Agriculture Development Strategy to 2025 and Vision to \n                                                \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided transaction technical assistance.

From 1994 to 2014, the area cultivated by wet season \n5. \nirrigated  agriculture  (WSIA)  doubled  from  136,000  hectares  (ha)  to  274,000  ha,  providing \nsupplementary  water  during  periods  of  low  rainfall  and  improving  household food security,  but \nproviding  low  returns.  Dry  season  irrigated  agriculture  (DSIA)  increased  from  16,000  ha  to \n182,000  ha,  with  more  than  18,000  irrigation  schemes,  of  which  (i)  20%  involved  dams  or \nreservoirs; (ii) 10% used pump lift systems; and (iii) 70% used diversion weirs, 80% with small \ncommand areas of less than 100 ha. The FNP have 37,600 ha of WSIA and 13,438 ha of DSIA \nregistered. Dry season HVCs offer high returns. HVCs can increase farm incomes by (i) 180% if \na farmer changes from growing rice during both  the wet and dry seasons to a wet season rice \ncrop  and  a  dry  season  HVC;  and  (ii)  500%  if  a  farmer  grows  a  wet  season  rice  crop  and  an \nirrigated dry season HVC. However, most farmers are unable to diversify into DSIA HVC because \nof  the  lack  of  water  control  systems  (WCSs).  Improving  the  capacities  of  water  users  groups \n(WUGs)  and  water  users  associations  (WUAs)  is  crucial  for  managing  WCSs.  The  increasing \nfeminization of agriculture demands women\u2019s full involvement in the decision making of WUGs \nand WUAs.  \n \nUpland forest cover has declined from 70% in the 1960s to 58% in 2015, and agriculture \n6. \naccounts for nearly 50% of upland conversion in the FNP. With climate change impacts, the FNP \nare vulnerable to a range of natural disasters, including wet season high-intensity storms causing \nflooding from monsoonal rainfall, and drought related upper catchment loss of vegetative cover \nand fires. Intensified cropping on fragile and steep uplands further aggravates flash flooding, loss \nof  biodiversity,  soil  instability,  causing  degraded  watersheds.  These  events  are  high  risks  for \nhuman life and property, agricultural production, and the destruction of PRI.  \n \nThe  annual  economic  cost  of malnutrition  is  estimated  to  be  2.4%  of GDP  (2013). The \n7. \nNNSPA  prioritizes  nutrition-sensitive  agriculture,  which  requires  irrigation,  and  recognizes  that \nhigher incomes lead to improved diets. In 2017, stunting was present in 33% of all children under \n5 years of age in the country and more than 40% of those in Houaphan and Xiangkhouang.9 \n \n8. \nADB  value  addition.  Most  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  investment  in  the \nLao PDR\u2019s rural development targets PRI, where ADB\u2019s scale of investment exceeds the capacity \nof most development partners. Lessons from ADB\u2019s experience include the following:  \n \n                                                \n6  In this context, PRI comprises irrigation and rural access infrastructure. \n7  World  Bank.  2018.

The project supports the government\u2019s goal of inclusive sustainable \neconomic growth. It aligns with the operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 (Table 1); Lao \nPDR country partnership strategy, 2017\u20132020; Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020; Operational \nPlan  for  Agriculture  and  Natural  Resources,  2015\u20132020;  Climate  Change  Operational \nFramework, 2017\u20132030; Gender Equality and Women\u2019s Empowerment Operational Plan, 2013\u2013\n2020;  and  Strategy for Promoting  Safe  and  Environment-Friendly  Agro-based Value  Chains in \nthe Greater Mekong Subregion and Siem Reap Action Plan, 2018\u20132022.11 \n \n\nTable 1: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \n\nStrategy 2030 Priority \n\nProject Interventions \n\nAddressing remaining poverty and \nreducing inequalities \nAccelerating progress in gender equality  Women and girls will benefit from better socioeconomic \n\nPRI stimulates the production of rice and dry season \nirrigated HVCs, increasing rural incomes. \n\nTackling climate change and building \nclimate and disaster resilience, and \nenhancing environmental sustainability \nPromoting rural development and food \nsecurity \n\nopportunities and nutrition. \nReliable irrigation enables production adaptation \nmeasures.

For  each  of  the \n18 subprojects,13 the project will: (i) prepare market assessments for dry season and upland crops \nleading to market linkages for demand-driven cropping; (ii) provide up to 200 matching grants for \nproducers and entrepreneurs, with at least 50 grants to women, and support for farmer-to-farmer \nextension  (para.  20); (iii)  provide  awareness and access  to new  climate-resilient  technologies, \nalong  with training  in good  agricultural  practice,  including  3,200 female members  of WUGs, to \nproduce  dry  season  HVCs  on  4,200  ha;  and  (iv)  prepare  forest  tea  production  plans  for \nXiangkhouang.  \n \n12. \nOutput  2:  Watershed  ecological  services  protected.  The  project  will  prepare  18 \nparticipatory land use plans (PLUPs), one for each of the subproject catchments. In Houaphan \nand Xiangkhouang provinces, ADB resources will be used to implement nine PLUPs, covering 37 \nvillages and 223,000 ha and increasing the area under perennial land use by 10%.14 The PLUPs \nwill be prepared in consultation with the relevant communities, with input from women, and include \ninvestment plans for land use, measures for flooding and landslides, and rural connectivity. \n \n13. \nOutput 3: Command area irrigation reliability improved. The project will: (i) modernize \nand make climate-resilient 18 subprojects (footnote 13) to support WSIA and DSIA on about 4,200 \nha, supported by 100 kilometers of year-round access infrastructure; (ii) train 120 WUGs to carry \nout operation and WCS management of the subprojects; and (iii) form 18 WUAs from the 120 \nWUGs, with women taking leadership positions in 25% of the WUAs. \n \nOutput  4:  Nutrition  awareness  and  facilities  improved.  The  NNSPA  has  prioritized \n14. \nHouaphan  and  Xiangkhouang  provinces  to  (i)  promote  nutrition-sensitive  agriculture  in  six \ndistricts; (ii) meet the nutritional needs of 9,400 adolescent girls and women of reproductive age \nthrough the establishment of 100 nutrition schools; and (iii) improve water, sanitation, and hygiene \n(WASH) facilities for women and men in the communities of eight subprojects. \n \n15. \nThe EU will provide an ADB-administered grant of \u20ac4 million to support output 4. Parallel \ncofinancing  will  be  provided  by  (i)  the  International  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development \n(Partnerships for Irrigation and Commercialization of Smallholders\u2019 Agriculture Project), aligning \nits  support  with  outputs  1  and  3;  and  (ii)  German  development  cooperation  through  Deutsche \nGesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Internationale  Zusammenarbeit  (Lao  PDR  Emission  Reductions  Programme \nthrough  Improved  Governance  and  Sustainable  Forest  Landscape  Management),  aligning  its \nsupport with output 2.15 \n \nD. \n \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $51.46  million  (Table  2).

The project will prepare market plans for each subproject to \nlink  production  to  markets.  Based  on  these  plans,  matching  grants  for  producers  and \nentrepreneurs  will  be  competitively  awarded  to  provide  resources  for  productive  assets  as \ndescribed in the PAM. The disaster risk profiles indicate the need for stream flow measurements \nand assessments of historical weather events that caused damage to PRI and inadequate dry \nseason  stream  flows.  Engineering  designs  have  been  adjusted  to  ensure  that  (i)  the  PRI  can \nwithstand flood events, (ii) WCSs enable efficient water scheduling within the command area, and \n(iii) road designs are able to withstand high-intensity and lengthy rain events. Key features are:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nHouaphan\u2019s  Nam Pua  RSP  will  upgrade  a  main  canal  and  introduce  piped \ndistribution systems for the 70 ha command area to enable DSIA HVCs. WCSs, \nsuch as gravity-pressured sprinkler systems, will enable intensified production and \nreduce women\u2019s workload.  \nXiangkhouang\u2019s Nam Tong RSP will (a) improve two headworks with supporting \nfish  passages,  (b)  improve  distribution  canals  for  producing  HVC  vegetables, \n(c) put in place community agreements to shift upland cultivation to irrigated areas \nand fodder production, (d) cultivate forest tea to increase economic opportunities \nwith the objective of lowering destructive forest cultivation and grazing practices, \nand  (e)  connect  upland  communities  to  the  RSP  command  area  for  job \nopportunities.  \nLouangphabang\u2019s Nam Seng RSP will extend the scheme to an additional 265 ha \nfor DSIA green soya and rehabilitate the main canal with slope stabilization.  \nXaignabouli\u2019s Nam Phieng 1 and 2 RSP will install WCSs and canal lining for green \nsoybean production. All additional subprojects will undergo technical reviews to be \neligible for ADB financing. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n  \nB. \n \n21. \nThe economic analysis followed ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects, \ncomparing  scenarios  with  and  without  the  project,  at  a  discount  rate  of  9%.18  The  economic \ninternal rates of return for the RSPs range from 9% to 43%. For irrigation, financial returns per \nday increased by 30% to 80%, reflecting the high value of dry season crops and increased returns \nthat  are  above the  nonagricultural market  rate for  casual  labor.  As  the  RSPs  are  nonrevenue-\ngenerating and the participating farmers are not contributing any capital or equity, a calculation of \nthe  financial  internal  rates  of  return  is  not  meaningful.  The  four  RSPs  will  generate  about \n160,000 days of paid labor per year. The incremental increases in household incomes provide \nthe  resources for  an  irrigation  service  fee  that  is  affordable  and  able to  sustain  operation  and \nmaintenance costs. Switching values for the RSPs are robust, exceeding a 20% change in the \nmain  parameters,  except  for  Houaphan\u2019s  Nam  Pua  RSP,  which  has  a  base  case  economic \ninternal rate of return of 9%, and has a switching value of 3% on projected benefits.19 \n \n \n\n                                                \n18 ADB. 2017.

The financial management risk is high.20 A financial management action plan was \nprepared  taking  into  consideration  the  devolved  implementation  arrangements  and  which  will \nmitigate  risk,  with  consultant  support.  The  risks  will  be  further  managed  by  adopting  financial \nmanagement  systems  and  procedures,  based  on  double-entry  accounting  systems,  including \nprovincial  accounting  modules  linked  via  cloud-based  internet  capabilities.  The  financial \nmanagement system will support the introduction of public sector double-entry accounting that \nwill interface with MAF\u2019s accounting system, along with capacity building for staff, with oversight \nfrom  the  program governance team.21  Government staff  were trained  in financial  management \nduring the project design stage, and training continues during project start-up and implementation. \n \n23. \nProcurement  risks  were  assessed  as  medium\u2013high,  but  have  been  mitigated  to  low\u2013\nmedium  as  (i)  the  executing  agency  (MAF)  and  the  central  implementing  agency  (DOI)  have \nprocurement experience in ADB projects, (ii) procurement staff have been trained, and (iii) loan \nimplementation  consultants  will  provide  procurement  support.  The  number  of  procurement \npackages has been minimized. The provincial implementing agencies have minimal experience \nrecruiting consultants following ADB procedures, so DOI will recruit consultants with ADB support \nbefore  loan  effectiveness.  All  procurement  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  ADB \nProcurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  the  associated  project \nadministration instructions and staff instructions. \n \n24. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  MAF,  DOI,  and  each  PAFO.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n \n25. \nFNP  households  derive  30%\u201350%  of  income  from  wet  season  rice.  Most  food-secure \nhouseholds allocate labor to off-farm employment, usually by men, which aggravates women\u2019s \ntime  poverty.22  The  project  seeks  to  develop  and  enable  the  cultivation  of  HVCs  through  the \nprovision of DSIA, yielding returns three to four times those of wet season rice, and higher than \nlocal nonfarm wage rates. HVCs are labor-intensive and generate jobs, which can draw labor out \nof inappropriate land uses in the upper watershed catchments. The four RSPs are estimated to \ncreate paid jobs, equivalent to about $1 million income per annum. The project will support the \ngovernment policy for nutrition-sensitive agriculture and hygiene support for adolescent girls and \nwomen to address high levels of wasting and stunting by providing WASH infrastructure in homes, \nschools, and markets in 100 villages. \n \nGender. The project is classified gender equity as a theme. Gender analysis reveals that \n26. \nwomen  have  fewer  opportunities  to  participate  in  public  decision  making;  and  less  access  to \ninformation,  training,  employment,  and  voice.  Improved  PRI  will  enable women to  benefit  from \nexpanded economic opportunities and access to social services. The project\u2019s gender action plan \npromotes  (i)  equal  project  benefits  among women  and  men,  including to job  opportunities and \ncontrol  over  resources;  (ii)  a  reduction  in  gender  inequalities  and  social  risks;  (iii)  increased \n\n                                                \n20 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Including the double-entry accounting packages and project financial management manuals. \n22 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n\n \n\n\f    9 \n\n \n\n \n\nSafeguards \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nrepresentation of women in decision making; and (iv) the use of sex-disaggregated data. Women \nare  central  to  DSIA  and  WASH  and  will  have  increased  access  to  water,  improved  command \nareas, labor-saving technologies, and funds for matching grants.23 \n \nE. \n \n27. \ncategories are as follows. \n \n28. \nEnvironment (category B). MAF and ADB have agreed on an environmental assessment \nand  review  framework.24  The  subprojects  will  not  infringe  on  protected  or  environmentally \nsensitive areas and will only require simple mitigation measures such as proper management of \nconstruction camps or storage of building materials. All subprojects are sited on existing irrigation \nschemes  and  have  enough  water  during  the  dry  season  to  support  irrigation  without  adverse \nstream flow impacts. The project will provide training in Lao PDR good agricultural practice and \nwill improve the safety of produce and mitigate the risks associated with increased agrichemical \napplication. Each initial environmental examination for the four RSPs includes an environmental \nmanagement plan with publicly disclosed mitigation measures.  \n \n29. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B).  MAF  and  ADB  have  agreed  on  a  combined \nresettlement and ethnic group development framework. Due diligence carried out on the RSPs \n(i) revealed  no  social  safeguards  impacts  on  Xaignabouli\u2019s  Nam  Phieng  1  and  2  RSP  and \nconsequently a due diligence plan was prepared; (ii) found social safeguard impacts for the other \nthree RSPs, leading to the preparation of land acquisition and resettlement plans; and (iii) publicly \ndisclosed  all  the  plans.25  The  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans  are  supported  by  public \nconsultation and disclosure, with minor impacts of land acquisition and compensation for roadside \ntrees,  crops,  or  small  structures  within  the  right-of-way  for  which  compensation,  allowances, \nsurveys, monitoring, and reporting will be financed from ADB loan proceeds.26 MAF will monitor, \nevaluate, and report the impacts semiannually to ADB. \n \n30. \nIndigenous peoples (category B). Impacts on indigenous peoples, referred to as ethnic \ngroups in the Lao PDR, are overwhelmingly positive as they are fully integrated into the subproject \ncommunities  and  will  share  in  the  project  benefits.  The  project  will  not  cause  physical \ndisplacement from traditional or customary lands, nor will it negatively impact the identity, culture, \nor  customary  livelihood  systems  of  the  ethnic  groups.  The  combined  resettlement  and  ethnic \ngroup development framework will be used to prepare resettlement and ethnic group development \nplans  for  each  subproject.  These  plans  will  include  mitigation  measures  to  address  impacts, \ninstitutional capacity development programs, a grievance redress mechanism, and compliance \nwith ADB\u2019s information disclosure and consultation requirements. \n \n \n \n\n                                                \n23 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Resettlement and Ethnic Group Development Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 In the case of loss of land there are two compensation scenarios for a household as detailed in the Resettlement and \nEthnic  Group  Development  Framework:  (i)  9%  or  less  loss  -  the  household  is  eligible  to  make  a  voluntary  land \ndonation or reach a negotiated settlement in accordance with the community participation framework; or (ii) 10% or \nmore loss \u2013 the household shall be compensated in cash, or in kind, as determined through consultation.  \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nF. \n \n31. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.27 \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  5  and  described  in \n\nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nRisks \nExtreme weather events \n\nGovernance and integrity \n\nGovernment imposes crop and \nproduction targets \n\nPrice incentives lead to upland \ncropping \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nSoil and water conservation in the watersheds, conservative engineering \ndesign assumptions, water conserved by efficient irrigation practices \nTraining on procurement and the financial management system for the \nDepartment of Irrigation and the provincial agriculture and forestry offices \nduring project preparation, to be continued during implementation with \nconsultant support. \nSubproject market plans will provide a counter to top\u2013down government \ntargets.
