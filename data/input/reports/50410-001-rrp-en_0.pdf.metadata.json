The report  also  describes  the  proposed \nadministration of a loan of up to $20,000,000 to be provided by the Canadian Climate Fund for \nthe  Private  Sector  in  Asia  (CCFPS)  under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing  Partnership  Facility \n(CEFPF). If the Board approves the proposed equity investment described above, I, acting under \nthe authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the loan from CCFPS. \n\n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n2.  Project identification. Demand for electricity in Thailand increased by an average of 3.6% \nper year during 2005\u20132016. Total electricity consumption was 182,846 gigawatt-hours in 2016, \nup 4.6% from the 2015 level of 174,834 gigawatt-hours. As of January 2017, Thailand\u2019s installed \npower generation capacity was 41,242 megawatts (MW). Production of electricity depends heavily \non fossil fuels\u201463% is generated from natural gas, 11% from lignite, and 7% from coal. Although \nrenewable energy sources currently contribute only 8%, the Government of Thailand\u2019s promotion \nof alternative energy under the Alternative Energy Development Plan, 2015\u20132036 is expected to \nincrease renewable energy capacity to 19,684 MW (30% of total capacity) by 2036, with 6,000 \nMW coming from solar power and 3,000 MW from wind power. 1 The plan was prepared as part \nof the government\u2019s strategy to diversify the energy mix and promote renewable energy, and (i) \nnotes  the  significant  potential  of  renewable  energy  in  Thailand,  and  (ii)  indicates  that  energy \nimports can be avoided through development of domestic renewable energy projects with private \ninvestment.  \n \nCountries  in  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  region  face  a  rapid \n3. \nincrease in energy demand, driven by socioeconomic factors that include rapid population growth, \nsustained  economic  growth,  growing  urbanization,  an  expanding  middle  class  population,  and \nincreased  access  to  electricity.  According  to  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and \nDevelopment, electricity consumption by countries in the ASEAN region will grow 8.04% per year \nduring  2009\u20132030.  This  poses  major  challenges  to  achieving  and  balancing  energy  policy \nobjectives in the region, including energy security, sustainable development, energy access, and \naffordability. \n \n4. \nADB identified the opportunity to provide financial assistance to B.Grimm through close \ncooperation and strong relationships that ADB has built over the last 5 years with key players in \nthe Thai energy sector, with the goal of (i) implementing ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 \nand the country operations business plan, 2017\u20132019 for Thailand, which emphasize support for \nclean energy and environmentally sustainable growth;2 and (ii) supporting the recently adopted \nSustainable  Development  Goals,  which  seek  to  substantially  increase  the  share  of  renewable \nenergy in the global energy mix.3  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n                                                 \n1   Government of Thailand, Ministry of Energy. 2015.

B.Grimm,  established  in  1993  in  Thailand,  is  an  energy \ncompany  that focuses  on  the  development, financing,  construction  and operation  of greenfield \npower plants. B.Grimm is a part of B.Grimm Group, Thailand\u2019s oldest infrastructure and industrial \ngroup in operation, which was founded in 1878.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Output \n\nOutcome. The outcome will be the sustained operation of private sector renewable power \n\n7. \nImpacts. The impacts will be (i) regional progress ensured in increasing substantially the \nshare of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030;4 and (ii) the energy mix diversified \nthrough  the  addition  of  alternative  energy  capacity  and  more  electricity  consumption  from \nrenewable sources.5  \n \n8. \nprojects in the ASEAN region. \n \n9.  \nASEAN region. \n \nC. \n\nOutput. The output will be the rollout and operation of renewable power projects in the \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\nConsistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \n10. \nthe  ADB  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020  (footnote  2)  for  (i) environmentally  sustainable \ndevelopment; (ii) the role of the private sector in meeting growing energy demand in the region; \nand  (iii)  capitalizing  on  ADB\u2019s  operating  strengths  in  infrastructure  development,  finance,  and \nother  areas.  The  midterm  review  also  supported  the  expansion  of  environment-friendly \ntechnologies for clean and efficient energy generation and use, as well as a larger role for private \nsector  financing  of  infrastructure.  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategies  for  various  ADB \ndeveloping member countries echo the themes of the energy policy, including the promotion of \nenvironmentally sustainable economic development and energy security.  \n \n11. \nConsistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, which supports wider access to energy through investments \nin energy efficiency and renewable energy projects.6 The project will contribute to ADB\u2019s target of \n$6 billion in annual financing for climate mitigation and adaptation by 2020, and catalyze further \nprivate sector resources in the clean energy sector.  \n \nD. \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTable 4 summarizes the implementation arrangements.7 \n\n12. \n                                                 \n4  In support of Goal 7 of the Sustainable Development Goals (footnote 3, above).  \n5  In support of the Alternative Energy Development Plan (para. 2, above). \n6  ADB. 2009.

By  working  with  a  well-established  energy \ncompany with a strong track record of successful execution, ADB will be able to extend its reach \nto multiple energy and renewable power projects, which would be difficult to assist directly. ADB\u2019s \nparticipation in the IPO will play an important role not only in providing direct financing but also in \nattracting third-party investors and establishing more confidence in B.Grimm\u2019s future access to \ncapital markets. ADB\u2019s presence as an equity investor will also ensure that B.Grimm will adopt \nand implement ADB\u2019s environmental and social safeguards standards. \n \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nThe CCFPS loan will contribute to the diversification of the ASEAN region\u2019s energy mix \n14. \nby adding renewable energy capacity, in particular distributed solar energy, thereby helping the \nregion achieve sustainable long-term economic growth and transition to a low-carbon economy.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \n15. \nThe CCFPS loan will also help the company establish renewable energy solutions in some \nof  the  ASEAN  region\u2019s  more  challenging  legal  and  regulatory  contexts.  Countries  such  as \nCambodia,  Myanmar,  the  Lao  PDR,  Indonesia  and  Viet  Nam  are  only  recently  beginning  to \ndevelop distributed renewable power options such as solar and wind, and new developers face a \nrange of technical, legal, regulatory and financing challenges. Through the use of concessional \nfinance, ADB will help to demonstrate a track record of successful financing to encourage private \nsector developers to take on the higher risk associated with these projects. \n \nC. \n\nRisks  \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nIn compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \n\n16. \ncategory B for environment, involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nB.Grimm  will  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection \n17. \nStrategy  (2001),  will  take  measures  to  comply  with  the  internationally  recognized  core  labor \nstandards.8 B.Grimm will report on an annual basis to ADB on (i) its compliance with such laws \nand (ii) the measures taken.
