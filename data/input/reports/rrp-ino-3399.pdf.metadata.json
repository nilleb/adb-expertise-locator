Specifically, the proposal is for: \n \n(i)  A  cluster  comprising  two  loans  to  support  policy  reforms  for \nfinancial  governance  and  social  security.  The  first  loan  (Phase \nI) will  consist  of  three  tranches  and  will  be  implemented  during \n2002  to  2003.  Subject  to  satisfactory  progress  under  Phase  I, \nthe  second  loan  (Phase  II) will  proceed  and  be  implemented \nover 2003 to 2005. \n\n \n(ii)  Technical  assistance  for  Phase  I  for  financial  governance  and \n\nsocial security reform. \n\nfrom \n\nstemmed \n\nstrategic  weaknesses \n\n \n \nThe  Asian  economic  crisis  highlighted  Indonesia\u2019s  weak  regulatory \nand supervisory framework and the risks associated with vulnerable \nfinancial structures in a financially integrated world. Vulnerabilities in \nIndonesia \nincluding \n(i) excessive  dependence  on  bank \nfinancing  characterized  by \nimprudent lending; (ii) a small and underdeveloped nonbank financial \nsector;  (iii)  lack  of  accountability,  independence,  and  adequateness \nof  regulation  and  supervision;  and  (iv) weak  corporate  governance. \nTo  promote  the  soundness  and  stability  of  Indonesia\u2019s  financial \nsystem  and  promote  economic  growth,  the  Government  needs  to \nlaunch broad-based financial sector reforms, strengthen frameworks \nfor  financial  sector  regulation  and  supervision,  and  establish  an \neffective anti-money laundering regime.  \n \nDuring the crisis, a large proportion of the population dropped below \nthe  poverty  line  and  a  significant  proportion  currently  remain  there, \nhighlighting the need to establish adequate social protection systems \nand retirement income. To address this need, the Government needs \nto  improve  the  governance  and  design  of  mandatory  pension  and \nretirement  schemes,  improve  fiscal  sustainability  of  programs, \nestablish  a  national  law  for  social  security  to  provide  a  unified \nframework for social security reform, and increase coverage of social \nsecurity systems to a broader segment of the population. \n \nThe  FGSSR  will  build  upon  the  core  reforms  of  INO-Loan  1618: \nFinancial  Governance  Reforms  Sector  Development  Program.1 \nPhase I will support a broad framework for the overall strengthening \nof  the  financial  sector  and  promote  the  development  of  sound \nfinancial  institutions  necessary  to  support  good  governance  and \neconomic  growth.  It  also  aims  to  improve  social  protection  through \n\n\fiv\n\n \n\n \nClassification \n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n\nimproved  governance,  supervision,  and  regulation  of  pension  funds \nand  mandatory  social  insurance  programs.  Sustainable  economic \ndevelopment  and  growth  in  Indonesia  depend  on  strengthening \ngovernance,  financial  supervision,  and  regulation.  Robust  economic \ngrowth  will  also  help  the  country  create  jobs,  raise  standards  of \nliving, and reduce poverty. \n \nTo promote consistency, efficiency, and harmonization of supervision \nacross  financial  services  and  products,  Phase  I  will  support  the \nestablishment of a consolidated regulatory and supervisory authority \n(OJK)  for  the  financial  sector.  In  the  pre-OJK  transition  period  of \n2002\u20132004,  Phase  I  will  (i) support  preparation  of  comprehensive \nlegal reform necessary to transfer regulatory and supervisory powers \nto  OJK;  (ii) support  development  of  an  effective  anti-money \nlaundering  regime;  (iii) strengthen  financial  sector  regulation  and \nsupervision  under  existing  authorities; \n(iv) improve  corporate \ngovernance; and (v) promote adoption of international best practices \nand standards for regulation and supervision. \n \nTo  strengthen  the  national  social  security  system,  Phase  I  will \n(i) support  the  development  of  a  law  for  a  national  social  security \nsystem; (ii) improve supervision and governance of mandatory social \ninsurance  and  social  security  programs  by  bringing  the  related \nentities  under  the  jurisdiction  of  OJK;  (iii) support  measures  to \nimprove  fiscal  sustainability  of  mandatory  programs;  (iv) improve \nprograms \nincome;  (v) support \ndevelopment  of  a  unified  identification  system  for  social  security  to \nimprove  administration  of  benefits;  (vi) assess  potential  options  for \nexpanding coverage of social security systems to the informal sector; \nand (vi) undertake a special audit of the mandatory social insurance \nscheme for formal sector workers and independent financial reviews \nof insurance firms to support reforms and restructuring. Phase II will \ncontinue  support  for  Phase  I  reforms,  and  include  measures  to \nsupport broader social security reform and restructuring as needed. \n \nEconomic growth \n \nCategory C \n\nto  provide  adequate  retirement \n\nlending \n\nthe  LIBOR-based \n\n \nIt  is  proposed  to  support  Phase  I  in  three  tranches  of  $100 million, \n$50  million,  and  $100 million  from  the  ordinary  capital  resources \n(OCR)  under \nthe  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB).  The  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance with ADB's LIBOR-based lending facility; a commitment \ncharge  of  0.75%  per  annum;  a  front-end  fee  of  1.0%;  conversion \noptions  that  may  be  exercised  in  accordance  with  the  draft  loan \nagreement,  the  loan  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  conversion  guidelines; \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the loan agreement. \n \n\nfacility  of \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nimplementing \n\nfurther  sector \n\nacross  multiple \n\nPhase  II  will  be  presented  for  Board  consideration,  based  on \nsatisfactory  implementation  of  Phase  I.  Policy  actions  for  Phase  II \nare  subject  to  revision  depending  upon  ADB\u2019s  reassessment  of  the \nmacroeconomic  environment, \ninformation  and \nanalyses  conducted,  lessons  learned  under  Phase  I,  and  status  of \nimplementation  and  readiness  of  the  Government  to  undertake  the \nproposed policy reform actions. \n \nThe  Government  will  be  able  to  withdraw  funds  from  the  Phase  I \naccount  during  a  period  of  1  year  from  loan  effectiveness.  Phase  I \nloan will be disbursed in three tranches. The first tranche, equivalent \nto $100 million, will be made available upon the Government meeting \nthe  conditions  of  loan  effectiveness.  An  additional  incentive  tranche \nof  $50  million  and  the  second  tranche  of  $100 million,  which  is \nexpected  to  be  released  within  eight  months  of  loan  effectiveness, \nwill  be  released  upon  satisfactory  compliance  with  agreed-upon \nconditions.  \n \nThe  Coordinating  Ministry  for  Economic  Affairs  (CMEA)  will  act  as \nthe  Executing  Agency  for  the  FGSSR  to  facilitate  (i) the  necessary \nfor \ncoordination \nimplementation  of  reforms  and  (ii) a  smooth  transition  from  Phase  I \nto  Phase  II  as  regulatory  and  supervisory  powers  are  transferred \nfrom existing authorities to OJK. \n \nIn  accordance  with  the  simplified  disbursement  procedures  and \nrelated  requirements  for  program  loans,  procurement  of  goods  and \nservices  produced  in  and  originating  from  ADB's  member  countries \nwill  be  made  with  due  consideration  to  economy  and  efficiency  in \naccordance  with  standard  Indonesian  public  sector  procedures  and \nnormal  private  sector  commercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB. \nDisbursement of the loan proceeds will be permitted on the basis of \na certification provided by the Borrower, confirming that in each year \nin which proceeds of the Phase I loan are expected to be disbursed, \nthe  value  of \nfrom \nnonmember countries, (ii) ineligible imports, and (iii) imports financed \nunder  other  official  development  assistance,  will  be  equal  to  or \ngreater than the amounts expected to be disbursed during that year. \nADB reserves the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and verify \nthe  validity  of  the  certification  issued  by  the  Government  with  each \nwithdrawal application. \n \nThe counterpart funds to be generated out of the loan proceeds will \nbe  used  to  finance  the  cost  of  structural  adjustments  and  activities \nconsistent with the FGSSR. \n \n\nimports  minus  (i) imports \n\nIndonesian \n\nagencies \n\ntotal \n\n \nProgram Period and \nTranching \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nProcurement and \nDisbursement \n\n \nCounterpart Funds \n\n \nRisks and Safeguards  The  implementation  of  the  FGSSR  could  be  affected  by  various \nfactors.  The  principal  risk  relates  to  the  potential  for  continuing \npolitical  uncertainty,  civil  conflict  or  unrest,  and  their  effect  on  the \npace  of  structural  reforms.  However,  there  is  a  firm  commitment  to \nfinancial governance and social security reform at the highest levels \n\n\fvi\n\n \n\n \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\nof  Government,  and  consequently  the  risk  of  the  Program  being \ndiluted or abandoned is reduced. \n \nThe  other  risk  stems  from  resistance  by  vested  interests  to  the \nreforms,  particularly  since  the  FGSSR  covers  sensitive  areas,  such \nas  social  security  reform,  restructuring  and  consolidation  of  the \ninsurance industry, and anti-money laundering. The Government has \nbeen  gradually  overcoming  resistance  in  these  areas  as  necessary \nsteps for reform are being undertaken. Delays may also occur in the \nimplementation of reforms due to lack of capacity. TA support will be \nprovided  under  the  FGSSR  to  help  address  this  risk,  and  the \nGovernment has identified areas where it will require assistance. \n \nTechnical  assistance  will  be  provided,  at  the  request  of  the \nGovernment,  for  $1.0 million  financed  from  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding \nprogram  to  support  implementation  of  the  FGSSR,  including  a \nfeasibility  study  for  social  security  reforms,  options  for  restructuring \nexisting  public  social  insurance  schemes,  and  assistance  in  the \ndevelopment of a new law for national social security.  \n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i) the  proposed \ncluster for the Financial Governance and Social Security Reform Program (FGSSR) in the Republic \nof Indonesia and (ii) the proposed loan to the Republic of Indonesia for Phase I of the FGSSR. The \nreport also describes technical assistance (TA) to support the implementation of the FGSSR, and if \nthe Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, \nshall approve the TA. \n \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT1 \n\n \n2. \nReflecting  weak  external  demand,  the  Indonesian  economy  posted  a  modest  economic \nperformance in the first half of 2002, growing by 2.9% year on year. External demand is expected \nto  remain  weak  during  the  remainder  of  2002,  and  the  impact  of  the  Bali  bombings  will  further \nserve to dampen growth prospects through their impact on the tourist industry (which accounted for \n3.7% of gross domestic product [GDP] in 2001) and on investor confidence. The economic fallout \nfrom  the  bombings  will  also  directly  and  significantly  add  to  an  already  high  and  rising \nunemployment  rate,  as  the  tourist  industry  alone  employs  some  9 million  people.  Any  significant \nreduction in unemployment will require a return to precrisis growth rates of 6\u20137% per annum. \n \n3. \nA  return  to  a  higher  growth  path  is  also  crucial  if  Indonesia  is  to  significantly  reduce  its \nheavy debt burden. Decentralization has shifted control over much revenue to local governments \nand the state budget for 2002 relies heavily on external financing\u2014projecting a deficit of 2.5% of \nGDP. Indonesia's debt burden, ballooned by the crisis, remains heavy and debt service obligations \nconstitute  the  largest  single  item  of  government  expenditure,  at  5.5%  of  GDP.  Any  significant \nreduction  in  the  public  debt  will  require,  among  other  things,  a  sustained  return  to  higher  growth \nrates. \n \n4. \nThe financial sector clearly has a central role to play in the country\u2019s economic performance \nthrough  its  role  in  stimulating  savings  and  investment  and  in  supporting  productivity  growth. \nUndermining  the  potential  for  growth,  however,  are  continued  weaknesses  in  financial  sector \ngovernance  due  to  distortions  in  incentives  created  by  the  existing  regulatory  and  institutional \nframework. Weak and uneven regulation and supervision have contributed to the development of a \nfragile,  structurally  unbalanced, \nfinancial  sector  characterized  by  bank  dominance  and \nunderdeveloped  capital  markets.  Bank  lending  to  the  corporate  sector,  moreover,  has  been \nconstrained  by  the  dead  weight  of  nonperforming  loans  accumulated  since  the  crisis.  The  sound \ndevelopment  of  alternative  channels  of  financial  intermediation  (e.g.,  contractual  savings,  capital \nmarkets)  has  been  hindered  by  weaknesses  in  the  regulatory  framework  and  in  supervisory \ncapacity. The need for regulatory and institutional reforms is fundamental if financial sector stability \nis  to  be  strengthened  and  the  sector  is  to  effectively  play  its  crucial  role  in  facilitating  long-term \neconomic growth. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  This  section  provides  a  brief  update  on  recent  economic  developments.  It  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  ADB. \n\n2002. Country Economic Review: Indonesia. Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\n \nA. \n \n5. \nThe financial sector in Indonesia is characterized by bank dominance and underdeveloped \ncapital markets. Combined assets of commercial and state banks in 2001 were over six times as \ngreat  as  the  Jakarta  Stock  Exchange  market  capitalization  (Table  1).  In  hindsight,  one  of  the \nindicators  signaling  Indonesia's  vulnerability  to  the  crises  might  have  been  found  in  the  heavily \nunbalanced  composition  of  its  financial  sector.  Postcrisis  reforms  in  the  banking  sector  have \nfocused on consolidation and recapitalization of the sector. Of the 239 banks operating prior to the \ncrisis,  Indonesia  closed  70  insolvent  banks  and  initiated  restructuring  of  seven  state  banks,  12 \nregional  development  banks,  and  20  private  national  banks.  Financial  sector  regulation  and \nsupervision  are  under  the  authority  of  three  regulatory  and  supervisory  authorities.  Banks  are \nregulated  and  supervised  by  the  central  bank,  Bank  Indonesia  (BI);  the  capital  markets  by  the \nCapital  Market  Supervisory  Agency  (Bapepam)  under  the  Minister  of  Finance;  and  insurance, \npension,  finance,  and  venture-capital  companies  by  the  Directorate  General  of  Financial \nInstitutions (DGFI) in the Ministry of Finance.

The ability of firms to raise \nfunds from Indonesia's capital markets has been limited by the small size and low liquidity of these \nmarkets.  Market  capitalization  of  the  Jakarta  Stock  Exchange  was  only  16%  of  GDP  in  2001, \namong the lowest in the region (Table 3).2 Apart from setbacks due to political and macroeconomic \ninstability,  growth  and  development  of  capital  markets  in  Indonesia  has  also  been  hindered  by \nhighly  concentrated  share  ownership  patterns  that  contribute  to  low  market  liquidity  and  weak \ncorporate governance.3  \n \n\n62 \n114 \n5 \n325 \n25 \n \n216 \n \n60 \n \n \n277 \n \n173 \n\n60 \n \n \n287 \n \n164 \n\n316 \n\n245\n\n222\n\n282\n\n208\n\n288\n\n159\n\n60\n\n61\n\n60\n\n \n\n \n\nTable 3: Selected Capital Market Indicators \n (Rp billion, unless otherwise indicated) \n \n1997 \n\n1999 \n\n1998 \n\n \nMarket Capitalization (JSX) \n   Value (Rp trillion) \n   % of GDP \nComposite Index (JSX) \nAverage Daily Trading Value (JSX) \nNumber of Listed Companies (JSX) \nInitial Public Offerings \n   Number \n   Value  \nBond Issuance \n   Number \n   Value \n\n159.9\n25.5\n401.7\n489.4\n282\n\n34\n3,950.5\n\n24\n7,205.0\n\n175.7\n18.4\n398.0\n403.6\n288\n\n3\n68.1\n\n451.8\n40.7\n676.9\n598.7\n277\n\n12\n805.2\n\n1\n150.0\n\n9\n4,284.0\n\n2000 \n\n \n259.6 \n20.1 \n416.3 \n513.7 \n283 \n \n25 \n1,772.2 \n \n19 \n5,613.0 \n\n2001 \n\n239.3\n16.0\n392.0\n396.4\n315\n\n32\n1,096.8\n\n6\n2,875.0\n\nJSX = Jakarta Stock Exchange. \nSources: Jakarta Stock Exchange, Capital Market Supervisory Agency. \n\n                                                 \n2  By way of comparison, stock market capitalization as a percentage of GDP in the Philippines was 77.6% in 2000. \n3  Most  listed  companies  are  majority  owned  by  the  founding  shareholders  with  the  general  public  holding  20\u201330%  of \n\nthe total shares. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \nResearch  indicates  that  prospective  local  investors  still  view  the  capital  market  as  a \n8. \ncomplicated  industry.4  Many  view  the  capital  markets  as  high  risk  and  in  general,  investor \npreference  is  for  bank  deposits.  This  is  particularly  pronounced  among  institutional  investors, \nwhose  portfolios  are  dominated  by  bank  instruments.  State-owned  pension  programs  have  over \n90%  of  their  assets  invested  in  bank  deposits  while  the  corresponding  figure  for  private  pension \nfunds  is  around  70%.  Portfolio  investment  in  the  stock  market  from  the  insurance  sector  is  also \nvery small. Of the Rp32 trillion investment portfolio of the insurance industry in 2000,5 time deposits \naccounted for almost 59% of investments, followed by private placements (11.4%), bonds (10.9%), \nand stocks (3.6%). Other factors impacting the size of the Indonesian capital markets include (i) a \nsmall  institutional  investor  sector\u2014the  combined  assets  of  the  pensions  and  insurance  sectors \nwere Rp51.2 trillion or 3.4% of GDP in 2001; (ii) lack of a developed government bond market with \nsuitable  benchmarks  for  corporate  bonds  and  private  issues  of  securities;6  (iii) access  to  funds \nthrough connected lending among industrial groups that include banks; and (iv) availability of lower \ncost offshore financing for multinationals and some large domestic firms. In addition, the increasing \ncorrelation  among  national  markets  due  to  globalization  has  reduced  the  incentive  for  industrial \ncountry  investors  to  diversify  into  emerging  markets.  Overall,  the  trend  in  foreign  investment  in \nIndonesia  has  shown  a  decline  from  a  roughly  equal  split  between  local  and  foreign  investors  in \n1996 to about 10% foreign participation in 2001. \n\n \n\n2. \n\nPension and Provident Funds  \n\n \n9. \nThe  old  age  or  retirement  benefit  system  in  Indonesia  targets  formal  sector  workers \nexclusively. There is no \u201cfirst pillar\u201d providing a minimum pension to the population. Approximately \n25 million people are currently covered under mandatory programs through state-run monopolies, \nand there are an additional 1.0 million participants in voluntary pension schemes. The Indonesian \nsocial  insurance  system  includes  three  mandatory  programs  covering  formal  private  sector \nworkers, civil servants, and the armed forces. Jamsostek (Jaminan Sosial Tenaga Kerja) is not a \npension  scheme,  but  a  mandatory  savings  scheme  that  provides  coverage  for  employees  of \nprivate sector and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) with 10 or more employees or a monthly wage \ncost  of  at  least  Rp1 million.  Taspen  (Tabungan  dan  Asuransi  Pegawai  Negari) covers  all  civil \nservants  and  Asabri  (Asuransi  Social  ABRI) covers  the  police,  and  civilian  and  military  defense \npersonnel.  These  mandatory  schemes  can  be  supplemented  by  voluntary  pensions  (dana \npensiuns)  of  two  types,  employer  pension  funds  (DPPKs)  and  financial  institution  pension  funds \n(DPLKs). A summary overview of pension programs\u2019 membership, assets, liabilities, and cash flow \nis shown in Table 4. \n \nThe mandatory programs were established by separate laws7 and are under the purview of \n10. \nseparate ministries. The Jamsostek program is under the purview of the Ministry of Manpower and \nTransmigration,  the  Taspen  program  is  controlled  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  the  Asabri \nprogram is controlled by the Ministry of Defense. The Ministry of Finance Pensions Directorate has \nauthority  to  supervise  voluntary  pension  schemes,  but  not  the  mandatory  programs  of  Asabri  or \nJamsostek,  which  are  considered  effectively  unsupervised.  Asabri  is  funded  from  current \ncontributions  and  the  Government\u2019s  general  budget,  and  Taspen  is  partially  funded  from  current \n\n                                                 \n4  Jakarta Stock Exchange, 2000-2004 Strategic Outlook. \n5 \n\nIndonesia Insurance in 2000, published by the Directorate of Insurance, Ministry of Finance and the Insurance Council \nof Indonesia. \n\n6  Until  the  crisis,  Indonesia  had  a  balanced  budget  policy  that  did  not  allow  for  treasury  bills  and  government  bonds. \n\nThe first bond issue to finance recapitalization was in May 1999. \n\n7  Law  No.  3  1992  on  Employees\u2019  Social  Security  for  Jamsostek;  Law  No.  11  1969  on  Pension  Benefits  for  Civil \nServants and their Beneficiaries; and Law No. 6 1966 for police and civilian and military defense personnel pensions. \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nVoluntary Plansc \n \n1.3f \n0.4g \n1.8 \n\n29.5f \n1.5g \n \n\n \n\n        \n\nDefined contribution \nor defined benefit \n\nand  accumulated  contributions,  but  is  largely  funded  from  the  general  budget.

The employer-sponsored voluntary plans have also shown increases but on a lesser scale. \nAlthough  still  a  small  component  of  Indonesia\u2019s  overall  system,  voluntary  pension  schemes  can \nplay  an  important  role  in  providing  long-term  security.  Improvements  in  the  supervisory  and  tax \nframeworks  are  needed.  There  are  no  formal  licensing  or  training  requirements  for  private  fund \nmanagers, supervision needs improvement, and industry disclosure is slow. \n \n12. \nThe  Jamsostek  old  age  benefit  is  a  mandatory  savings  scheme  that  pays  a  lump-sum \nbenefit upon (i) attaining the age of 55 years; (ii) death before the age of 55 years; or (iii) total and \npermanent  disability.  The  program  provides  insufficient  retirement  income,  representing  a  long-\nterm  potential  burden  on  the  Government  as  workers  become  poor  in  old  age.  The  low  wage \nreplacement ratio (i.e., small retirement income) stems from factors including low contribution rates \nand  poor  investment  performance.  The  monopoly  status  of  the  program  has  precluded \ndevelopment  of  more  effective  schemes.  In  spite  of  its  mandatory  status,  the  compliance  rate  is \nonly around 45% due to a lack of confidence in Jamsostek and concerns over lack of transparency, \ndisclosure, and governance. In 2001, Jamsostek used an independent auditor for preparation of its \nannual  statements.  However,  in  July  2002,  Indonesia\u2019s  Supreme  Audit  Agency  (BPK)  asked  a \nnumber of accounting firms to revise their audit reports on a group of state-owned enterprises as \nthey did not meet generally accepted accounting standards. This included Jamsostek. Jamsostek \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nhas  operated  with  high  overhead  costs  and  many  Jamsostek  members  have  multiple  identity \nnumbers, resulting in unconsolidated accounts and poor administration of benefits. \n\n \n13. \nImproving the social security system has become a priority of Government in the aftermath \nof  the  Asian  economic  crisis.  Participation  in  formal  pension  arrangements  decreased  along  with \nthe rise in unemployment, as people focused on fulfilling immediate needs rather than saving for \nretirement.  During  the  crisis,  calls  for  better  management  of  Jamsostek  increased.  Some \nemployers  pulled  out  from  the  fund,  others  stopped  contributions,  and  some  firms  pooled  their \ncontributions to manage themselves. Although the compulsory nature of the program is not often \nargued,  elimination  of  the  monopoly  of  its  management  by  a  government  company  is  constantly \nchallenged.  Privatizing  the  management  of  a  provident  fund  can  be  supported  with  the  view  that \ngovernment should not be the market when the private sector can provide the products or services \non a competitive basis. In April 2002, a presidential team was established8 to lead development of \nnational  policy  on  social  security  and  to  prepare  a  new  law  for  a  national  social  security  system. \nThe team is evaluating the potential scope of the law including extending coverage to the informal \nsector.9 The law will act to unify social insurance schemes and provide a framework for integrating \nthe voluntary pensions sector. \n \n\n3. \n\nInsurance Sector \n\n \nThe Indonesian insurance industry is characterized by a large number of companies in both \n14. \nthe  life  and  nonlife  sectors.  At  31  December  2001,  there  were  61  life  insurance  companies,  109 \nnonlife insurance companies, and 5 social insurance companies (mandatory programs under state \nmonopolies).10  Approximately  25.3 million  life  policies  were  issued  at  year-end  2001,  or  one  for \nevery  eight  members  of  the  population.  During  the  period  1996\u20132001,  the  number  of  life  and \nnonlife insurance firms remained fairly stable, and combined assets increased over this time from \nRp12.9  trillion  to  Rp39.9  trillion  (Table  1).  Recent  years  have  also  shown  rapid  growth  in  gross \npremiums  for  the  sector.  These  statistics,  however,  do  not  reveal  the  current  condition  of  the \ninsurance sector and the urgent impending consolidation facing this industry.  \n \n15. \nA  life  insurance  company  can  continue  to  operate  in  a  deficit  situation,  vulnerable  to  a \nfinancial  shock,  for  many  years  if  the  deficit  is  not  apparent  and  policyholders  continue  to  pay \nsufficient  premiums  to  meet  current  claims.  Many  insurance  firms  now  suspending  business  or \nclosing  were  likely  unsound  before  the  crisis  due  to  factors  such  as  insufficient  capital  base, \noveroptimistic  product  pricing, \nlack  of \nmanagement  expertise  and  technical  skills,  and  weak  internal  governance.  Lax  enforcement  of \nregulations,  weak  supervision,  and  lack  of  independence  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  Insurance \nDirectorate  to  carry  out  its  regulatory  and  supervisory  functions  were  also  factors.  Insurance \nregulating monitoring systems had been developed to provide sufficient advance information to the \nInsurance Directorate to avoid a situation of an insurer failing to meet obligations to policyholders, \n\nreserves,  asset-liability  mismatches, \n\ninadequate \n\n                                                 \n8  Decrees \n\ninclude:  (i) August  2000  Coordinating  Minister \n\nfor  Welfare  and  Poverty  Alleviation  Decree  No. \n25/KEP/MENKO/KESRA/VIII/2000  Concerning  the  Team  for  Improvement  of  the  National  Social  Security  System; \n(ii) March 2001 Decree of the Secretary to the Vice President No. 7 of 2001 regarding Working Group of the National \nSocial  Security  System;  and  (iii) April  2002  Decree  of  the  President  No.  20  of  2002  regarding  National  Social \nInsurance System Team. \n\n9  The presidential team has been consulting with ADB, and ADB has provided some initial support.  \n10  Social insurance includes the mandatory pension and savings schemes. It also includes basic protection programs for \nworkers  and  their  families  against  social  risks  in  connection  with  industrial  relations  such  as  work  accidents,  death, \nhealth,  and  old  age,  and  is  carried  by  the  five  state  monopolies:  Jamsostek,  Jasa  Raharja,  Taspen,  Askes,  and \nAsabri.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nbut political will has been lacking to take early action, and in some cases it was already too late for \nremedial measures. \n \n16. \nRevised  paid-up  capital  requirements  were  issued  in  1999  and  risk-based  capital  (RBC) \nrequirements were also introduced, with an allowance to phase in requirements up to 2004. This \nallowed firms adequate time to come into line with standards and aimed to encourage the industry \nto  rehabilitate  itself  through  rationalization  and  consolidation.  To  improve  transparency  of  the \ninsurance industry to the public, the DGFI issued a decree in December 2001 requiring publication \nof  insurance  companies\u2019  financial  position,  solvency  ratios,  ownership  of  the  firm,  and  names  of \ndirectors. Although financial and solvency information may be difficult for an average policyholder \nto assess, this public disclosure provides a means to accelerate owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 actions to \nimprove  conditions.  It  also  facilitates  enforcement  by  the  Insurance  Directorate  by  bringing  the \ninformation  into  the  public  forum.  The  requirement  for  first  publication  of  this  information  was  in \nJune 2002.  \n \n17. \nIn  August  2002,  DGFI  announced  that  six  insurance  firms  had  failed  to  meet  the  RBC \nrequirements, are under government order to restrict their operations, and may be closed by year-\nend.  Five  of  these  firms  are  in  the  life  sector.  Three  additional  firms,  including  two  nonlife  firms, \nhave voluntarily ceased business. DGFI also stated that another 30 firms have been put under its \nsurveillance. The first quarter 2002 data reported to the Insurance Directorate indicate that 25 life \ninsurance  firms,  representing  59%  of  market  share  in  terms  of  gross  premiums,  have  negative \nsolvency  margins.  This  negative  solvency  represents  a  total  capital  deficiency  of  Rp5.86  trillion \n($651 million  at  an  exchange  rate  of  Rp9,000  =  $1)  in  the  life  sector,  compared  to  the  nonlife \nsector, with 27 firms having negative solvency margins amounting to Rp59.8 billion ($6.6 million). \nOne major insurer accounts for over 85% of the capital deficiency among life insurance firms and \ncontinues to write new policies.    \n  \n18. \nPolicyholders under the five life firms slated for closure in 2002 totaled 440,638 at year-end \n2001. However, the number of policyholders affected by firms reporting negative solvency margins \namounts  to  21,474,876,  or  85%  of  policyholders.  DGFI  has  not  announced  any  measures  to \naddress  policyholder  concerns  or  potential  losses.  Law  No. 8  of  1999  regarding  Consumer \nProtection  provides  for  the  establishment  of  a  consumer  protection  agency  and  a  consumer \ndisputes  resolution  body;  however,  neither  has  yet  been  established.  Dispute  resolution  in  the \ninsurance  sector  has  been  limited  and  controversial.  In  2000,  there  were  121  complaint  cases \nregarding  claims  settlement,  though  only  17  cases  were  settled  in  the  corresponding  year.  From \nJanuary  to  July  2001,  72  claim  settlement  complaints  were  filed.  Issues  included  claim  denials, \nsettlements,  interpretation  of  policies,  the  amount  of  claims,  timely  issuance  of  policies,  and \nunclear explanation on provisions in the policies. \n   \n19. \nIn looking forward to address the capital needs of the insurance sector, firms may consider \npotential  resources  from  foreign  investors.  There  are  presently  22  joint  ventures  operating  in  the \nlife sector and 23 in the nonlife sector. However, in 2002 a well-publicized bankruptcy case against \na  solvent  insurance  firm  brought  international  attention  to  the  serious  deficiencies  in  Indonesia\u2019s \nlegal  framework  and  judicial  process,  and  the  adverse  impact  this  has  on  investor  confidence. \nGovernment actions and the Indonesian supreme court\u2019s decision to overturn the commercial court \ndeclaration  demonstrated  Indonesia\u2019s  commitment  to  act  against  corrupt  judicial  practices; \nhowever, the legal framework requires amendment to provide for supervisory authorization in filing \npetitions against insurance firms for bankruptcy or liquidation. This issue was raised in connection \nwith  the  Financial  Governance  Reforms:  Sector  Development  Program  (FGRSDP)  third  tranche \ndiscussions  of  progress  in  governance  in  Indonesia.  It  was  discussed  that  the  FGSSR  program \nwould address this deficiency. \n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nB. \n \n\nSector Issues \n\n \n\n1. \n\nInadequate Financial Sector Regulation and Supervision and Multiple Agency \nFramework \n \n\n \n \nIndonesia  has  suffered  from  historically  weak  regulatory  implementation  and  a  lack  of \n20. \nsupervisory  resources  and  capacity  in  the  financial  sector.  The  effectiveness  of  agencies  in \ncarrying  out  their  roles  has  been  largely  undermined  by  weak  accountability  and  a  lack  of \nindependence. The multiple agency framework encompassing BI, Bapepam, and DGFI, lacks good \ngovernance, efficiency, and the resources and capacity to effectively enforce laws and regulations. \nAlthough  the  mandatory  social  insurance  companies  report  data  to  the  Insurance  Directorate  in \nDGFI,  the  Insurance  Directorate  does  not  supervise  any  of  these  mandatory  programs\u2014they \nremain unsupervised in a regulatory framework. Indonesia is still in the process of building human \ncapital,  and  the  small  trained  cadre  of  professionals  has  been  dispersed  among  many \norganizations.  Lack  of  resources  is,  in  particular,  a  factor  for  DGFI;  lack  of  independence  affects \nDGFI and Bapepam; and weak accountability and poor governance are factors impacting all three \nagencies. In addition, the existing legal framework and multiple agency structure is not conducive \nto  the  supervision  of  companies  engaging  in  connected  lending.  Weak  coordination  and \ninformation sharing among the supervisory agencies have made it difficult to supervise and assess \nconsolidated risk exposure in the absence of harmonized prudential standards, financial reporting, \nor  joint  inspections  programs.  Although  only  a  few  Indonesian  companies  have  succeeded  in \noffering a broad range of financial services, banks may set up subsidiaries in insurance, securities \nbroking,  or  leasing.  The  potential  remains  for  regulatory  arbitrage  and  increasing  risk  exposure. \nImprovements  have  been  made  in  the  regulatory  and  supervisory  frameworks  across  agencies \nover the past decade; however, changes have often come in a piecemeal fashion and have taken \na long time. Further improvements in the regulatory and supervisory framework could benefit from \na consolidated effort among agencies in lifting the level of supervision and good governance.    \n \n \n \n21. \nIndonesia\u2019s weak financial sector governance and supervision encompass frameworks for \nfighting money laundering. Until recently, money laundering was not a crime in Indonesia. Money \nlaundering also increases vulnerability to other kinds of crimes, such as drug trafficking, trafficking \nin  people,  fraud,  and  corruption.  This  vulnerability  leads  to  poor  governance,  further  undermining \nstate institutions and sound economic development. Indonesia was placed on the Financial Action \nTask Force on Money Laundering (FATF) list of Non-Cooperative Countries and Territories (NCCT) \nin June 2001 due to its lack of an anti-money laundering regime. It was classified in FATF\u2019s June \n2002  review  to  identify  NCCTs  as  among  the  jurisdictions  that  have  made  progress  in  enacting \nlegislation to address deficiencies following its adoption of an anti-money laundering law. Further \nimprovements  are,  however,  required  to  avoid  imposition  of  FATF  countermeasures  that  could \nseverely impact Indonesia\u2019s progress in recovery. Key issues have been identified, including a high \nrupiah  threshold  for  reporting  suspicious  transactions  and  a  14-day  period  before  suspicious \ntransactions  must  be  reported.  The  law  allows  up  to  1  year  following  enactment  of  the  law  to \nappoint the Chairman and deputies of the financial intelligence unit, and an additional 6 months to \nstart  implementing  functions.  In  October  2002,  the  President  appointed  the  Chairman  and  Vice \nChairman of PPATK11 indicating key progress in this area, however, additional staff are required to \nmake  PPATK  operational.  ADB  is  providing  a  TA  to  support  development  of  an  anti-money \n\nLack of Anti-Money Laundering Regime \n\n2. \n\n                                                 \n11  Presidential Decree No. 201/2002 dated 8 October 2002. \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nlaundering  regime,12  and  is  coordinating  closely  with  other  agencies  in  this  area  including  the \nAustralian  Agency  for  International  Development,  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment,  Department  for  International  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom,  International \nMonetary  Fund,  World  Bank,  United  Nations,  and  Asia-Europe  Meeting  Anti-Money  Laundering \nInitiative (ASEM). Discussion of ADB\u2019s TA is included under the proposed program.  \n\n \n\n3.  \n\nNeed  for  Advancement  of  Sector  Reforms  in  Transition  to  the  Financial \nServices Authority \n\n \nThe  Government  is  committed  to  moving  toward  the  establishment  of  a  consolidated \n22. \nregulatory  and  supervisory  authority  for  financial  services  (OJK)  to  strengthen  regulatory  and \nsupervisory frameworks and more efficiently utilize regulatory resources. However, this process of \ntransition is projected to span a period of 18\u201324 months, and it is important to continue to advance \nsector  reforms  for  the  long-term  strength  and  stability  of  the  financial  system.  In  this  regard,  BI, \nBapepam,  and  DGFI  will  need  to  continue  to  implement  measures  to  improve  supervision  and \nenforcement  of  appropriate  prudential  safeguards  and  standards.  Areas  to  be  addressed  include \nlicensing,  qualifications  for  experts,  procedures  for  onsite  and  offsite  examinations,  training  for \nsupervisors  and  examiners,  implementation  of  RBC  requirements,  and  adoption  of  a  risk-based \nregulatory  approach.  Full  conversion  to  a  scripless  trading  and  settlement,  adoption  of  measures \nfor an early warning system, and prompt revocation of licenses of broker-dealer companies not in \ncompliance with RBC and reporting requirements are among key required actions. \n \n23. \nThe  recent  government  announcement  of  insurance  sector  insolvencies  and  the  large \nnumber  of  unsound  firms  placed  under  DGFI  surveillance  raise  questions  on  the  viability  of  the \nsector. Major industry consolidation is anticipated, and some analysts have projected a reduction in \nthe  number  of  companies  to  as  few  as  20  firms.13  The  closure  of  firms  and  consolidation  raise \nquestions as to the adequacy of consumer protection and the impact on employment. Although the \nConsumer  Protection  Law  mandates  establishment  of  an  agency  and  disputes  resolution  body, \nneither has yet been established and it is unclear when these will be in operation and how they will \nbe  engaged  in  the  financial  sector.  Policyholders  are  currently  unprotected.  An  evaluation  of  the \nimpact on employment of rapid industry consolidation has not yet been undertaken. There are over \n100,000  workers  in  the  insurance  sector.14  The  Government  believes  that  the  new  Rp100  billion \ncapital  requirement  for  new  entrants  to  the  insurance  sector  will  provide  an  adequate  level  of \ncapital  for  new  businesses  and  will  also  serve  as  a  barrier  to  entry  for  firms  with  inadequate \nresources. What remains a central issue is how to manage the existing firms now to avoid major \nmarket disruption and to minimize losses among policyholders. One major life insurer alone has a \ncapital  deficiency  of  over  $500 million.  The  Insurance  Directorate  has  proposed  a  possible  new \ninsurance  guarantee  institution  for  life  insurance  customers  in  2004;  however,  such  an  institution \ncould  only  be  effectively  established  after  financial  health  has  been  restored  to  the  sector  and, \nbased  on  recent  data,  this  would  likely  be  beyond  2004.  In  the  meantime,  plans  for  restructuring \nand/or mergers need to be urgently developed. There is also a need to train actuaries and develop \nthe  actuarial  profession  in  Indonesia  to  increase  their  number  as  well  as  the  capacity  and  skills \nrequired to support the insurance industry, as it comes into line with international best practices. \n \n\n                                                 \n12  ADB.  2002.

Life  Insurance\uf8e7Review  of  Regulatory  Practices  and  Developments.  Paper  presented  at  the \nManaging Regulatory Change in Life Insurance and Pensions International Symposium, Beijing, People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, 8\u20139 November 2000. \n\n14  Includes  39,591  employees,  70,446  individual  insurance  agents,  and  447  legal  entity  insurance  agents  reported  in \n\n2000. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n4. \n\nInadequate National Social Security \n\n \n24. \nImproving  governance  and  supervisory  frameworks  for  pensions  and  insurance  are \nfundamental  first  steps  in  strengthening  the  social  security  system.  However,  significant  reforms \nwill  be  required  to  provide  adequate  retirement  income.  There  is  no  unified  policy,  supervisory, \nregulatory,  or  legal  framework  for  the  pension  sector  or  social  security.  Multiple  ministries  are \ninvolved  in  the  control  and  regulation  of  pension  programs.  Mandatory  programs  target  formal \nsector workers exclusively, leaving the majority of the working population uncovered, and there is \nno  first  pillar  providing  a  minimum  pension.  Fiscal  sustainability  of  the  mandatory  programs  of \nTaspen and Asabri is also a critical issue as unfunded pension liabilities are presently estimated at \nRp380.3  trillion.  Future  funding  problems  are  inevitable  as  unfunded  liabilities  mount  under  the \ncurrent pay-as-you-go basis, and the Government is reluctant to take the necessary measures to \nincrease funding in view of its current immense debt burden. \n \n25. \nIn 2002, the President established a team to lead the policy development of national social \nsecurity.  This  team  has  been  given  a  mandate  to  prepare  a  new  national  law  addressing  social \nsecurity  in  2002.15  However,  additional  resources  and  assistance  are  needed  to  meet  these \nambitious goals. Key issues in the present system include (i) insufficient governance of mandatory \npension  and  provident  funds,  (ii) lack  of  fiscal  sustainability  of  mandatory  pension  programs, \n(iii) inadequate  retirement  incomes  for  formal  sector  workers  and  limited  coverage  of  the \npopulation, (iv) lack of a unified national identification system for administering social security and \nfacilitate portability, and (v) no unified social security framework or law. For Jamsostek (a defined \ncontribution  plan),  the  primary  concern  is  that  the  plan  does  not  provide  sufficient  retirement \nincome,  potentially  burdening  the  Government  in  years  ahead.  Encouraging  competition  and \neliminating state monopolies will be important factors in strengthening the social security system. \nGradual  reduction  or  elimination  of  the  option  for  one-off  lump-sum  benefits  at  retirement  is  also \nimportant.  Taking  lump-sum  benefits,  a  common  practice  in  Indonesia,  leaves  room  for  myopic \nspending by retirees with that could significantly reduce or eliminate retirement savings. Additional \nconcerns include low wage replacement ratio, underreporting of wages, lack of enforcement, lack \nof a common national identification number, lack of governance, and lack of government-directed \ninvestment.  Inadequate  management  information  systems  also  make  it  more  difficult  to  address \nproblems  related  to  underreporting  or  misallocation  of  contributions.  Under  the  PT  corporate \nstructure,16  the  mandatory  schemes  are  required  to  operate  on  a  profit-seeking  basis  and  to  pay \ndividends and taxes to the Government (the only shareholder). This further diminishes members\u2019 \ninvestments  and  strengthens  the  impression  that  the  state  schemes  are  an  additional  form  of \ntaxation.  Profit  for  owners  is  not  generally  accepted  to  be  an  appropriate  objective  for  insurance \nprovided on a monopoly and mandatory basis. Surpluses should be applied to the benefit of those \ninsured. Reforms under the FGSSR will focus on the pension and provident funds components of \nthe social insurance companies.17  \n \n\n5. \n\nPoor Corporate Governance  \n\n \n26. \nIndonesia's  corporate  and  commercial  system  is  not  working  under  a  robust  system  of \ncorporate governance. Existing rules and regulations have not been rigorously enforced. External \nmechanisms and enforcement through banks and capital markets, which are a feature of corporate \ndiscipline  in  other  countries,  have  not  functioned  well.  There  has  been  little  incentive  for  internal \n                                                 \n15  ADB  provided  support  to  a  delegation  from  the  presidential  team  to  establish  a  national  social  insurance  system  in \n\nManila in June 2002, in connection with preparatory work for establishing a national social insurance law. \n\n16  The Indonesian equivalent of the incorporated limited liability company is the perseroan terbatas or PT. \n17  Health, accident and other insurance are not planned to be addressed under the FGSSR given the need to maintain a \n\nmore focused program. \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nLessons Learned from Asian Development Bank Operations in the Sector \n\nmechanisms or voluntary best practices to be adopted. Essential legislation establishing adequate \nauditors\u2019  liability  for  audits  and  commissioners\u2019  liability  for  misleading  or  false  public  information \nand  board  decisions  needs  to  be  put  in  place.  Comprehensive  disclosure  in  corporate  reporting, \nindependent  directors  or  commissioners  safeguarding  the  rights  of  minority  shareholders,  and \ntransparency  in  financial  dealings  with  related  parties  are  still  lacking.  Stock  exchanges  in \nIndonesia are required to be in the mutual form, limiting trading access to members. The option to \ndemutualize should be allowed by law and promoted to separate ownership from trading access to \nimprove  corporate  governance  and  provide  a  framework  for  eliminating  conflicts  of  interest  and \nraising the necessary capital for development and growth.  \n \nC. \n \n27. \nADB  has  had  major  financial  sector  operations  in  Indonesia  addressing  banking,  capital \nmarkets, pensions, and insurance for over 15 years. Three major program loans undertaken during \nthis  time  are  the  Financial  Sector  Program,  for  $200 million,  approved  in  1988;  the  Second \nFinancial  Sector  Program,  for  $250 million,  approved  in  1992;  and  the  Financial  Governance \nReforms  Sector  Development  Program,  for  $1.4  billion,  approved  in  1998.  The  thrust  of  financial \nsector  reforms  over  this  period  moved  from  a  focus  on  deregulation  of  the  banking  sector  and \ncapital  markets  as  a  means  of  increasing  competition,  efficiencies,  growth,  and  diversification  of \nthe  financial  system  to  a  period  of  implementation  of  a  comprehensive  set  of  reforms  aimed  at \nstrengthening  potential  safeguards  while  encouraging  market  forces  and  market  efficiency.  The \nrapid  dramatic  growth  that  occurred  following  deregulation,  and  the  subsequent  problems  from \nderegulation, highlighted inadequacies in the legal, regulatory, and supervisory frameworks. Basic \nlaws for the operation of insurance companies and pension funds were approved in 1991 and 1992 \nand Bapepam was divested in 1991 of its dual and conflicting responsibility of both regulating and \nmanaging  the  Jakarta  Stock  Exchange.  Although  basic  legislative  frameworks  were  established, \nregulatory and supervisory frameworks remained weak and enforcement was lax. The Asian crisis \nexposed  those  weaknesses,  and  subsequent  reforms  have  concentrated  on  strengthening \nregulation  and  supervision,  improving  corporate  governance,  and  adopting  international  best \npractices  and  standards  for  prudential  regulation  and  supervision.  Based  upon  ADB  program \ncompletion  reports  and  a  special  evaluation  study,18  all  of  the  noted  programs  were  considered \nsuccessful,  though  not  without  difficulties  and  incomplete  attainment  of  some  reforms.  Lessons \nrelevant to this program learned from prior programs include: \n \n\nMore time was needed than envisaged to meet some of the targets, particularly in \n\nEffective  loan  designs  require  not  only  an  understanding  of  the  sector,  but  also  of \n\n(i) \nthe area of legislative reform. This reality should be factored into future program designs; \n \n(ii) \nthe overall policy environment and the macroeconomic and structural forces at work; \n \nPrograms concentrating on deregulation need to ensure that adequate supervisory \n(iii) \nand  regulatory  frameworks  are  in  place  to  prevent  subsequent  sector  weakening  or \ncollapse; \n \nPrograms  are  often  only  one  phase  of  a  continuing  process  of  reforms  and \n(iv) \nadjustments.  Further  measures  are  often  necessary  to  ensure  that  the  gains  from  the \nprograms are consolidated and retained; \n \n\n                                                 \n18  ADB.  2001.

Phase I will \nsupport  a  broad  framework  for  the  overall  strengthening  of  the  financial  sector  and  promote  the \ndevelopment of sound financial institutions necessary to support good governance and economic \ngrowth.  It  also  aims  to  improve  social  protection  through  improved  governance,  supervision,  and \nregulation  of  pension  funds  and  mandatory  social  insurance  programs.  Sustainable  economic \ndevelopment and growth in Indonesia depend on strengthening governance, financial supervision, \nand regulation. Robust economic growth can help the country create jobs, raise standards of living, \nand reduce poverty. \n\n29. \nTo  promote  consistency,  efficiency,  and  harmonization  of  supervision  across  financial \nservices and products, Phase I will support the establishment of Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK), a \nconsolidated  regulatory  and  supervisory  authority  for  financial  services.  In  the  pre-OJK  transition \nperiod  of  2002\u20132003,  Phase  I  will  (i) support  comprehensive  legal  reform  necessary  to  transfer \nauthorities  to  OJK;  (ii) support  development  of  an  anti-money  laundering  regime;  (iii) continue \nstrengthening  regulation  and  supervision  in  the  relevant  institutions;  (iv) improve  corporate \ngovernance;  (v) promote  adoption  of  international  best  practices  and  standards  for  prudential \nregulation and supervision; and (vi) strengthen the soundness of financial institutions. \n \nTo  improve  national  social  security,  Phase  I  will  (i) bring  the  entities  related  to  mandatory \n30.  \nsocial insurance and social security programs under OJK\u2019s jurisdiction; (ii) improve governance of \nmandatory pension and provident funds; (iii) undertake measures to improve fiscal sustainability of \nmandatory programs including assessment of unfunded pension liabilities and preparation of plans \nto  reduce  liabilities  and  operating  costs;  (iv) support  improvements  to  programs  to  provide \nadequate retirement income; (v) support development of a unified identification system for national \nsocial security to improve administration and portability of benefits; (vi) assess potential options for \nexpanding  coverage  of  the  social  security  system  to  the  informal  sector;  (vii) develop  a  new  law \nand agency for national social security; and (viii) undertake a strategic audit, company valuations, \nand  reviews  to  identify  necessary  reforms  and  restructuring.  Phase  II  would  continue  support  for \nPhase  I  reforms,  and  include  measures  to  support  broader  social  security  reform,  restructuring, \nand  consolidation  of  enterprises  as  needed.  Appendix  2  is  the  development  policy  letter  of  the \nGovernment on the envisaged sector reforms, together with the policy matrix. Appendix 3 provides \nthe program framework. \n \n\n                                                 \n19  ADB.  1998.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nRepublic of Indonesia for Financial Governance Reforms: Sector Development Program. Manila. \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nPolicy Framework and Actions for Phase I 20  \n\nB. \n \n\n1. \n\nStrengthen Frameworks for Financial Sector Regulation and Supervision \nthrough Consolidation of Regulatory and Supervisory Authorities  \n\n \nTo improve governance and to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory frameworks in the \n31.  \nfinancial sector, Law No. 23 of 1999 concerning Bank Indonesia mandated the establishment of a \nconsolidated supervisory authority for financial services. The passage of this central bank law was \na  condition  under  FGRSDP.  In  line  with  this  mandate,  the  Government  will  establish  OJK,  the \nplanned consolidated regulatory and supervisory authority, with the support of two ADB TAs.21 To \neffectively  improve  such  regulation  and  supervision,  essential  levels  of  accountability  and \nindependence of OJK must be maintained by law. It is in this respect \u2013 the achievement of a higher \nlevel  of  accountability  and  independence  \u2013  that  OJK  can  offer  a  fundamental  and  significant \nchange  in  the  regulatory  and  supervisory  framework  for  the  financial  sector.  OJK\u2019s  mandate  for \nconsumer protection in the financial sector will also be supported. OJK is also important in that a \nconsolidated  regulatory  and  supervisory  authority  will  (i)  provide  a  structure  that  can  more \neffectively  utilize  the  scarce  regulatory  resources  and  skilled  staff  in  Indonesia;  and  (ii) promote \nconsistency and harmonization across financial services and products (i.e. regulatory neutrality).  \n \n32. \nThe  development  of  OJK  also  provides  a  critical  opportunity  to  improve  the  quality  of \nsupervision  of  specific  sectors.  Sector  reforms  can  be  accelerated  through  a  coordinated  effort \namong supervisory agencies for adoption and amendment of relevant sector laws and through the \ndevelopment  of  the  OJK  framework.  One  example  of  an  important  reform  with  respect  to  the \ninsurance  sector,  is  the  requirement  for  written  authorization  from  OJK  for  filing  petitions  for \nbankruptcy or liquidation (see discussion in para. 19).   \n \n33. \nUnder  Phase  I,  the  draft  OJK  law  will  be  prepared  with  ADB  assistance,  lodged  with  the \nState  Secretary  Office  and  submitted  by  the  President  to  Parliament  for  enactment.  To  ensure \neffective  transfer  of  authority  to  OJK,  the  Government  will  support  all  necessary  amendments  to \nexisting  legislation.  To  enable  effective  operations  of  OJK,  the  Government  will  support  the \npreparation  of  comprehensive  legislation  and  implementing  rules  and  regulations  that  adequately \ndefine  OJK\u2019s  role,  functions,  powers,  responsibilities,  appropriate  governance  and  organizational \nstructure, policy and terms for staff, and capacity-building and training needs. The Government will \nprovide  budgetary  support  to  enable  OJK  to  make  transitional  arrangements  to  begin  operations \nand  integrate  operations  within  one  or  two  years  of  enactment  of  the  law.  OJK\u2019s  purview  will \ninclude  banking,  capital  markets,  pensions,  insurance,  and  other  financial  services  companies. \nOJK  will  also  have  jurisdiction  over  social  insurance  and  social  security  programs  including \nJamsostek,  Taspen,  and  Asabri  as  described  in  paras.  38\u201339.  To  promote  greater  transparency, \naccountability, disclosure, and compliance, OJK will adopt and promote best practices in corporate \ngovernance and international standards for prudential regulation and supervision.  \n \n34. \nThe emergence of a single agency with integrated regulatory and supervisory powers over \ndifferent  types  of  financial  institutions  first  gained  recognition  in  the  1980s  in  northern  Europe  in \nresponse to banking crises. There has been an increasing interest and adoption of this approach in \nother  regions  including  Asia.  The  institutional  responsibilities  and  powers  have  varied  across \nregulatory models, and the motivations for moving toward regulatory integration have ranged, with \nefficient  use  of  regulatory  resources,  regulatory  neutrality,  and  the  opportunity  to  improve \n                                                 \n20  See policy matrix in Appendix 2. \n21  ADB.  2001.

Appendix  1  includes  additional  summary \ninformation on consolidated regulatory and supervisory authorities, and provides a comparison of \nregulatory responsibilities and powers among nine integrated regulators.  \n \n\n2. \n\nEstablish an Effective Anti-Money Laundering Regime \n\n \n35. \nUnder  the  FGRSDP,  an  anti-money  laundering  law  was  developed  and  signed  by  the \nPresident in 2002. The FGSSR will provide further support to accelerate reforms and establish an \neffective anti-money laundering regime. This assistance will be provided in close coordination with \nother  agencies  (see  para.  21).  The  Government  will  continue  to  place  priority  on  taking  the \nnecessary  measures  to  address  deficiencies  in  its  anti-money  laundering  regime  as  identified  by \nFATF  until  Indonesia  is  removed  from  the  NCCT  list.  The  Government  will  adopt  and  amend  as \nnecessary  the  anti-money  law,  and  issue  regulations  and  guidelines,  and  provide  the  necessary \nframeworks  for  institutions  to  support  implementation  of  the  new  law.  In  support  of  this  regime, \nsector decrees will also be issued including \u201cKnow Your Customer Principles\u201d by BI and Bapepam \nfor  banks  and  securities  markets  respectively.  Adequate  budgetary  support  will  be  provided  to \nenable set-up and operations of the financial intelligence unit (PPATK) mandated under the law. To \nfacilitate  the  start  of  operations  of  PPATK,  the  President  appointed  the  Chairman  and  Vice \nChairman of PPATK in October 2002 and BI is planning the appointment/secondment of additional \nstaff to PPATK on an interim basis. Additional staff will be key to ensuring operational capacity of \nPPATK, and a Presidential Decree will be issued on the organizational structure and operations of \nPPATK. \n \n36. \nBI  will  assume  financial  intelligence  unit  functions  for  the  banking  sector  until  PPATK  is \noperational, and will provide interim reports on monitoring of suspicious transactions. Systems for \nsuspicious  transactions  reporting  and  analysis  will  be  developed  and  guidance  notes  issued  for \nthose  institutions  subject  to  the  anti-money  laundering  law  for  reporting  suspicious  transactions. \nCapacity  building  and  training  will  be  conducted  for  PPATK,  related  financial  institutions,  the \njudiciary, law enforcement officers, and prosecutors. Workshops will be held in Jakarta and major \nprovinces  to  increase  awareness  of  money  laundering  as  a  crime  and  understanding  of  the  new \nlaw.  PPATK  will  issue  semiannual  reports  on  its  work  to  the  President,  Parliament,  and  related \nagencies. PPATK will undertake all necessary measures to enter into operational memorandum of \nunderstandings  with  other  relevant  Government  agencies  and  institutions,  and  begin  dialogue  to \nenter into information-sharing and cooperation arrangements with regulatory institutions in the Asia \nand Pacific region.  \n \n\nAdvance Core Sector Reforms in Transition to OJK \n\n \n37. \nDuring the transition to OJK, core sector reforms will be advanced over the transition period \nof 2002\u20132004. These reforms build upon initial actions taken under FGRSDP and fall broadly into \nthe following categories: \n \n\nstrengthen supervision and regulation; \npromote adoption of international best practices and standards; \nstrengthen capital base and implement RBC standards; and \nprovide institutional capacity building and public education. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n \n38. \nDGFI  and  Bapepam  will  continue  to  improve  enforcement  efforts  and  raise  standards, \nincluding  actions  to  implement  the  risk-based  prudential  standards  for  insurance  companies  and \nstrengthen  and  simplify  escalation  procedures  for  dealing  with  problem  companies;  issue  time-\nbound  warnings  to  brokers  not  in  compliance  with  existing  rules  and  regulations;  and  develop \nstandards  for  qualifications  and  licensing  requirements  for  fund  managers,  insurance  specialists \n\n \n3.  \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nand  companies,  agents,  and  brokers  in  line  with  international  best  practices.  Amendments  to \naccounting,  insurance,  pension,  company  and  capital  market  laws  will  be  undertaken  both  to \nstrengthen  supervision  and  regulation  and  provide  for  international  best  practices  and  standards. \nDGFI  and  Bapepam  will  continue  to  develop  criteria  and  issue  legislation  with  regard  to \nindependent directors, commissioners, and auditors, as well as liability for their actions. Increased \nsanctions for noncompliance and higher levels of enforcement will also be undertaken. Guidelines \nand standards for onsite and offsite examinations will be developed as well as software systems to \nsupport  effective  examination.  Bapepam  and  DGFI  will  improve  prudential  supervision  and \nregulation  by  enforcing  provisions  requiring  greater  transparency  in  operations.  To  build \ninstitutional  capacity,  Bapepam  and  DGFI  will  promote  human  resources  development  through \ncore training. \n \n39. \nTo  improve  market  efficiencies  and  increase  capacity  to  support  economic  growth, \nBapepam  will  monitor  the  move  to  a  fully  scripless  trading  system  in  2002  with  appropriate \noperational  clearance  and  settlement,  central  depository  systems,  and  bank  settlement  systems. \nTo ensure sound capital market operations, all firms that are members of the Indonesian Clearing \nand Guarantee Corporation, that extend margins, or that keep custody of customer securities will \nmaintain Rp5 billion net adjusted working capital, and all fund managers will be licensed to meet \nongoing  requirements.  Bapepam  will  also  introduce  stringent  procedures  to  enforce  RBC \nrequirements  on  a  consistent  and  transparent  basis.  DGFI  and  Bapepam  will  also  continue  to \nsupport  professional  and  company  associations  to  improve  qualification  standards  in  line  with \ninternational best practices. \n \n40. \nTo  promote  accountability  and  increase  consumer  protection,  DGFI  issued  a  decree \nrequiring insurance companies to publicly disclose solvency positions, names of company owners \nand  board  of  directors  and  commissioners.  To  determine  the  potential  systemic  risk  in  the \ninsurance  sector,  a  strategic  assessment  will  be  undertaken  by  the  Insurance  Directorate  to \ndetermine  the  financial  condition  of  insurance  companies,  and  strategic  options  including \nrestructuring, consolidation, or closure. High priority, at-risk insurance firms will be targeted by the \nInsurance Directorate for immediate action. The Government will establish a plan for the insurance \nsector  for  an  orderly  market  transition,  including  possible  assistance.  ADB  will  provide  TA  to \nsupport  this  action  (see  para.  61).  The  insurance  industry  will  be  required  to  comply  with  the \nincreasing  RBC  requirements  in  line  with  the  staged  escalation  to  2004,  and  to  seek  appropriate \nmerger  partners  if  they  are  unable  to  independently  increase  capital  to  required  levels.  The \nGovernment  will  enforce  sanctions,  including  suspension  of  licenses,  against  firms  not  in \ncompliance. \n \n\n4. \n\nImprove National Social Security \n\n \n41. \nImproving  financial  sector  governance  and  regulatory  and  supervisory  frameworks  for \npensions  and  insurance  are  fundamental  first  steps  to  strengthening  social  security.  However, \nsignificant reforms will be required to provide adequate retirement income. Phase I will concentrate \non improving social security in the following areas: \n \n\nentities related to mandatory social insurance or social security programs will come \n\na  new  law  for  national  social  security  will  be  developed  to  unify  programs  and \n\n(i) \nunder the jurisdiction of OJK and be subject to OJK\u2019s regulatory and supervisory authority; \n \n(ii) \nimprove social security frameworks, management, and administration; \n \n(iii) \n \n\ngovernance of mandatory pension and retirement schemes will be improved; \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n(iv) \nthe  financial  condition,  operations,  and  fiscal  sustainability  of  mandatory  programs \nwill  be  assessed,  and  options  developed  for  restructuring  and  reducing  unfunded  pension \nliabilities; \n \n(v) \nrequirements for private pension fund managers and licensing requirements; and \n \n(vi) \ninformal sector in the near and medium term will be examined.  \n\nproposals  for  a  realistic  scope  of  expansion  of  social  security  systems  to  the \n\nthe  management  of  voluntary  pension  plans  will  be  improved  through  certification \n\n \n42.  \nThe Government will conduct an independent special audit of Jamsostek including an audit \nof the investment portfolio and company assets, a current fair market valuation of the assets, and \nan  assessment  of  inadequacies  and  potential  problems  of  the  mandatory  program  for  formal \nprivate sector workers and SOEs. As Jamsostek is a defined contribution plan (savings scheme) it \ndoes not have the problem of unfunded pension liabilities. Problems to be addressed include lack \nof  transparency  and  public  disclosure,  weak  internal  corporate  governance  structures,  historical \ndirected  investments  under  political  pressure,  poor  returns,  high  operating  costs,  segregation  of \nassets,  and  cross-subsidization  of  programs.  Options  and  recommendations  for  improving \ngovernance  and  operations  will  be  developed,  including  restructuring  and  elimination  of \nmonopolies. Taspen will assess the unfunded pension liabilities of its mandatory pension plans for \ncivil servants and prepare options to reduce unfunded liabilities (accumulated liabilities in the pay-\nas-you-go  system  from  existing  debt  from  past  service  has  been  assessed  at  Rp342  trillion  for \nTaspen).22  Regular  independent  actuarial  assessments  of  unfunded  liabilities  of  mandatory \nprograms  will  be  supported.  To  provide  efficient  administration  of  benefits  and  to  allow  for \nportability of benefits, the Government will develop a unified identification system for national social \nsecurity. To provide adequate stakeholder inputs into the development of such a system, a series \nof  public  seminars  and  workshops  will  be  conducted  among  stakeholder  groups,  and  a  public \neducation  campaign  will  be  conducted  to  inform  the  public  of  social  security  system  and  reform \nissues. \n \n\n5. \n\nStrengthen Corporate Governance \n\n \nThe Government will take actions to improve governance in the corporate and commercial \n43. \nsystem in Indonesia in line with FGRSDP requirements and the FGSSR objectives. This includes \nenforcing  existing  rules  and  regulations,  issuing  new  legislation,  and  increasing  sanctions. \nLegislation will be prepared to establish significant liability of auditors for negligence and liability of \ncommissioners  for  misleading  or  false  public  information  and  board  decisions.  A  draft  public \naccountants  law  will  be  expanded  to  include  adequate  provisions  for  liability  for  auditors23  for \nnegligence,  to  be  submitted  to  the  State  Secretary  Office  in  2003.  As  an  interim  measure,  the \nMinistry  of  Finance  issued  a  decree  for  Public  Accountants  in  September  200224  including \nprovisions establishing liability of auditors for negligence and expanding the scope of coverage to \ninclude financial audits, performance audits, and special audits.  \n \n44. \nThe Ministry of Justice and Human Rights (MOJHR) will expand draft amendments to the \nCompany  Law  of  1995  to  include  provisions  for  liability  for  commissioners  and  directors  for  false \nand misleading public information and board decisions. In Indonesia, the Board of Commissioners \n                                                 \n22  ADB. 1998. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Reform of Pension and Provident Funds. Manila. \n23 The previous law prepared in 2001/2002 lacked sufficient provisions. See discussion in ADB. 2002. Progress Report \non  the  Release  of  Third  Tranche  Financial  Governance  Reforms  Sector  Development  Program  (Loan  1618-INO)  to \nIndonesia. Manila.  \n\n24  Minister of Finance Decree No. 423/KMK.06/2002 dated 30 September 2002. \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nis  the  group  responsible  for  company  policy  and  oversight  of  company  operations.25  Board  of \nDirectors in Indonesia means the officers with the day-to-day operational responsibility. To address \nthis  two-board  system  and  to  further  expand  the  legislative  scope  for  imposing  liability  on \nmanagement  with  a  view  to  strengthening  corporate  governance,  the  FGSSR  has  expanded \nFGRSDP conditionality to apply to both Boards of Commissioners and Boards of Directors.26 The \ndraft Company Law will be submitted with the draft OJK law in a package of laws for consideration \nby  Parliament  in  2003.  As  an  interim  measure,  Bapepam  will  exercise  its  regulatory  power  by \nimposing  sanctions  as  applicable  to  boards  of  commissioners  and  directors  of  listed  companies. \nThe  Government  will  submit  laws  as  a  package  to  facilitate  coordination  of  multiple  legislative \nreforms  in  the  financial  sector,  streamline  the  process  in  Parliament  and  provide  an  integrated \napproach to support the establishment of OJK.27 \n  \n45. \nAdditional measures by Bapepam include preparation of a rule in 2002 on independence of \naccountants providing audit services in the capital market to be issued by year-end. Bapepam will \nalso  amend  the  Capital  Market  Law  including  provisions  to  (i) establish  liability  for  directors  in \nviolation  of  the  Capital  Market  Law;  (ii) establish  responsibility  of  lawyers  involved  in  the \npreparation  of  legal  audit  for  reporting  violations  of  the  Capital  Market  Law;  and  (iii) allow \ndemutualization  of  stock  exchanges.  The  draft  Capital  Market  Law  will  be  submitted  with  the \npackage of laws with OJK. \n \n\n6. \n\nPhase Two \n\n \n46. \nPhase II is anticipated to be $150 million, and will continue support for Phase I reforms and \ninclude  measures  to  support  broader  and  deeper  social  security  reform  and  restructuring  as \nneeded.  Reforms  are  outlined  in  the  policy  matrix.  Phase  II  will  be  presented  for  Board \nconsideration, based on the progress of implementation of Phase I. Policy actions for Phase II are \nsubject  to  revision  depending  upon  ADB\u2019s  reassessment  of  the  macroeconomic  environment, \nfurther sector information and analyses conducted under Phase I, lessons learned during Phase I, \nand status of implementation and readiness of the Government to undertake the proposed policy \nreform actions. \n \nC.  \n \n\nThe Loan \n\n1. \n\nAmount of Phase I Loan and Source of Funds \n\n \n47. \nA $250 million program loan is proposed from ADB's ordinary capital resources to support \nPhase I as described in the attached development policy letter and the policy matrix. The Borrower \nwill be the Republic of Indonesia. The loan will be utilized over a period of 12 months from the date \nof  its  effectiveness.  The  loan  size  has  been  determined  by  the  complexity  of  the  program,  the \nprogram\u2019s  development  impact,  the  importance  of  the  sector,  and  the  potential  adjustment  costs \nrelated to the structural reforms. The estimated costs of reforms under Phase I are: \n \n\ncosts  to  establish  OJK  (the  consolidated  regulatory  and  supervisory  authority  for \nretrenchment/redeployment \n\nincluding  capacity  building  and \n\n(i) \nfinancial  services), \n($22.0 million) (Supplementary Appendix); \n \n\n                                                 \n25  Equivalent to Board of Directors in some countries. \n26  FGRSDP conditionality pertained to liability only at the commissioner level. \n27  ADB has supported this approach as a practical matter, given the large number of bills to be considered in Parliament  \nand the desirability of an ambitious and coherent approach to amending legislation governing regulatory institutions. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n(ii) \ncosts  to  establish  PPATK  (the  financial  intelligence  unit  for  the  anti-money \nlaundering  regime),  capacity  building  for  PPATK  and  related  government  institutions,  and \nsupport for the regulatory compliance costs associated with the new anti-money laundering \nlaw ($25 million);28 and \n \n(iii) \n\ncosts relating to restructuring the insurance sector ($200 million). \n\n \n48. \nThe adjustment costs to the economy could significantly exceed the amount of the program \nloan. The capital deficiency of one troubled life insurer alone is in excess of $500 million, and other \nfirms have been identified as financially weak or unsound.  \n \n\n2. \n\nInterest, Maturity, and Utilization Period \n\n \nThe Phase I loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, an interest \n49. \nrate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility; a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum; a front-end fee of 1%; conversion options that \nmay be exercised in accordance with the terms of the draft Loan Agreement, the loan regulations, \nand  ADB\u2019s  conversion  guidelines;  and  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \nAgreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) reasons for Indonesia\u2019s decision to borrow \nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any \ncommunication or advice of ADB. \n \nD. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProcurement and Disbursements \n\n \n50. \nUpon loan effectiveness, ADB will have the right to withdraw from the loan account and pay \nitself,  on  behalf  of  the  Government,  the  front-end  fee  charged  on  the  loan  in  the  amount  of \n$2.5 million.  The  proceeds  of  the  balance  of  the  loan  will  be  utilized  to  finance  the  foreign \nexchange  costs  of  items  produced  in,  and  procured  from,  ADB\u2019s  member  countries.  The \nGovernment  will  certify  that,  if  (i) the  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  finance  imports  already  made,  the \nvalue of eligible imports in the period concerned exceeds the amount of the requested withdrawal; \nor  (ii) the  loan  proceeds  are  to  finance  goods  to  be  imported,  the  value  of  eligible  imports  in  the \nimmediately  preceding  year  period  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  the  amount  of  the  requested \ndisbursement  plus  all  other  amounts  expected  to  be  withdrawn  from  the  loan  during  the \nsucceeding 1 year. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the \naccuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \n\n2. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n \n51. \nThe  policy  matrix  for  Phase  I  includes  specific  components  that  bear  distinct  costs  of \nstructural  adjustments  (Appendix  2).  The  counterpart  funds  to  be  generated  out  of  the  loan \nproceeds  will  be  used  by  the  Government  to  finance  the  cost  of  such  structural  adjustments,  as \nwell as other activities consistent with the program. \n \n\n                                                 \n28  As  reference,  the  compliance  cost  assessment  for  the  United  Kingdom  in  the  Money  Laundering  Regulations  1993 \nExplanatory Note estimated initial compliance costs at \u00a330 million. Although the larger institutions should be able to \nabsorb  compliance  costs,  smaller  institutions  may  need  some  initial  support  from  the  Government  for  timely \nimplementation. Government support is to be repaid by institutions.  \n\n\f \n\n19\n\n3. \n\nMonitoring and Tranching \n\n \n52. \nThe first loan of the FGSSR is to be released in three tranches. The first tranche equivalent \nto  $100 million  will  be  made  available  upon  the  Government  meeting  conditions  of  loan \neffectiveness. An additional incentive tranche of $50 million and the second tranche of $100 million \nwill be released upon satisfactory compliance with agreed upon conditions. The second tranche is \nexpected \nloan  effectiveness.  The  progress  of \nimplementation of specified policy actions set out in the policy matrix (Appendix 2) will be reviewed \nby ADB with the Government on an ongoing basis with respect to the incentive tranche, and about \n3 months prior to the scheduled second tranche release. \n \n53. \n  \n\nThe first tranche release conditions include the following: \n\nto  be  released  within  eights  months  of \n\na. \n\nFirst Tranche \n\n \n(i) \ndraft laws and/or amendments to the relevant principal laws:  \n \n\nDGFI, Bapepam, and MOJHR to complete the technical preparation of the following \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\nOJK law, including (i) provisions for the independence and accountability of \nOJK,  as  outlined  in  Appendix  2,  Attachment  1;  (ii) provisions  for  OJK  to \nexercise  jurisdiction  over  entities  related  to  existing  and  future  mandatory \nsocial  insurance  or  social  security  programs  which  will  be  subject  to  OJK\u2019s \nprudential  and  consumer  protection  mandate;  and  (iii) provision  requiring \nOJK\u2019s  written  approval  for  filing  petition  of  winding-up/bankruptcy  cases \ninitiated against entities under OJK\u2019s jurisdiction; \nCapital Market Law; \nPensions Law, including provisions for the management of pension funds to \nbe legally responsible for establishing anti-money laundering procedures; \n  Insurance  Law,  including  provisions  that  (i) life  insurance  companies  can \nmanage  employer-sponsored  pension  plans;  and  (ii) written  approval  of  the \nMinister of Finance must be obtained prior to filing a petition of winding-up/ \nbankruptcy; \nCompany  Law,  including  provisions  imposing  liability  of  commissioners  for \nfalse  and  misleading  public  information  and  board  of  commissioners\u2019 \ndecisions; and \nPublic  Accountants  Law,  including  provisions  imposing  liability  on  auditors \nfor negligence in audits. \n\nAs an interim measure, DGFI will issue a decree imposing liability on auditors. \n\n(ii) \n \nDGFI  to  launch  a  special  audit  of  Jamsostek  to  include  (a)  an  audit  to  confirm \n(iii) \nexisting portfolio and company assets and a provide a valuation of the current fair market \nvalue  of  assets;  (b)  an  audit  to  determine  whether  there  is  an  appropriate  segregation  of \nassets  of  each  program;  and  (c)  provide  an  assessment  and  actuarial  valuation  of  the \nsufficiency  of  technical  reserves,  including  the  actuarial  methods,  assumptions,  and \naccuracy of data utilized by Jamsostek.  \n \n(iv)   DGFI  to  launch  an  independent  financial  review  of  a  major  unsound  insurance \ncompany as agreed with ADB.29 The Ministry of Finance Insurance Directorate will provide \n\n                                                 \n29  Review to be funded under TA Loan 1620. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\nADB with current insurance sector financial data and RBC ratios, analysis, and reports on \nan ongoing basis. \n\n \n\nb. \n\nIncentive Tranche \n\nBI,  as  acting  financial  intelligence  unit,  to  provide  interim  report  on  monitoring  of \n\nAppoint or second additional staff to PPATK to ensure operational capacity.

ADB will also give close attention to \nthe  poverty  impact  of  policy  reforms  and  costs  of  adjustment  relating  to  any  retrenchment  in  the \ninsurance industry. The Government will make available the necessary information for ADB to be \nable to conduct a public expenditure review to ascertain that these policies are being implemented.  \n \nADB  will,  in  cooperation  with  the  Coordinating  Ministry  for  Economic  Affairs  (CMEA)  and \n56. \nthe  relevant  implementing  agencies,  carry  out  quarterly  reviews  of  progress  in  program \nimplementation.  The  Government  and  ADB  will  continue  to  engage  in  active  policy  dialogue \nthroughout  FGSSR  implementation  that  includes  issues  that  may  affect  financial  sector \ndevelopment,  and  additional  reforms  that  may  be  considered  necessary  or  desirable  for  the \nsustainable  development  of  the  financial  and  social  security  sectors.

On completion of the first loan, an interim report will be provided within \nthree months. On completion of the FGSSR, but in any event not later than 6 months of completion \nof  the  FGSSR,  the  Government  will  prepare  and  furnish  to  ADB  a  comprehensive  report  on  the \noverall  impact  of  the  policy  reforms  implemented.  Monitoring  indicators  and  mechanisms  will  be \nmutually agreed. \n \n\n4. \n\nExecuting Agency \n\n \n58. \nCMEA  will  act  as  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  FGSSR  to  facilitate  (i)   the  necessary \ncoordination  across  multiple  implementing  agencies  for  implementation  of  reforms  and  (ii) a \nsmooth  transition  from  Phase  I  to  Phase  II  as  regulatory  and  supervisory  powers  are  transferred \nfrom  existing  authorities  to  OJK.  A  program  director  will  head  the  program  implementation  unit. \nMeasures  are  being  undertaken  to  ensure  program  readiness.

These  objectives  will  be  addressed  through  the \nimplementation  of  reforms \nto  strengthen  regulation,  supervision,  and  governance \nframeworks,  with  the  potential  to  broaden  and  diversify  the  markets  and  encourage \ndomestic and foreign investment in Indonesia. Asset diversification away from the banking \nsector,  especially  given  continued  weakness  in  this  sector,  will  support  more  resilient \ndomestic  markets  able  to  withstand  exogenous  shocks  and  currency  contagion.  The \nestablishment of an effective anti-money laundering regime will also add to the stability of \nIndonesia\u2019s  financial  system,  and  reduce  vulnerabilities  to  other  types  of  crimes  including \ndrug trafficking, trafficking in people, fraud, and corruption. \n  \n(ii) \nImproved  frameworks  for  effectively  dealing  with  financial  crises  will  also  help  the \neconomy protect vulnerable groups that fall below poverty lines during a crisis, as currency \ndepreciation triggers unemployment and impacts lower income levels disproportionately. \n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\n(iii) \nOther major benefits include increased protection of consumers, policyholders, and \nworkers  and  more  transparent,  sustainable,  social  insurance  programs  with  improved \ngovernance, regulatory, and supervisory frameworks that can provide better social security \nand reduce the potential for poverty in old age. The Summary Poverty Reduction and Social \nStrategy and the Poverty Impact Assessment are in Appendix 6. The FGSSR is considered \nto be environmentally neutral and an environmental impact assessment is in Appendix 7. \n\nAn  additional  benefit  is  that  the  FGSSR  provides  an  essential  platform  to  carry \n\n(iv) \nforward the FGRSDP agenda.  \n \nRisks \n\nThe implementation of Phase I could be affected by various factors: \n\n(i) \nThe  principal  risk  relates  to  the  potential  for  continuing  or  escalating  political \nuncertainty,  civil  conflict  or  unrest,  and  their  effect  on  the  pace  of  structural  reforms. \nHowever, there is a firm commitment to financial governance and social security reform at \nthe highest levels of Government and consequently the risk of the FGSSR being diluted or \nabandoned is reduced; \n \nThe  other  main  risk  stems  from  resistance  by  vested  interests  to  the  reforms, \n(ii) \nparticularly  since  Phase  I  covers  sensitive  areas,  such  as  social  security  reform, \nrestructuring  consolidation  of  the  insurance  industry,  and  development  of  an  anti-money \nlaundering  regime.  The  Government  has  been  gradually  overcoming  resistance  in  these \nareas through public information campaigns and socialization of reforms through seminars \nand workshops; and \n \n(iii) \nGovernment has identified areas where it will require assistance. \n\nDelays may also occur in the implementation of reforms due to lack of capacity.

RECOMMENDATION \n\n \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  program  cluster  concept  and  loan  would  comply  with  the \n\n69. \nArticles of Agreement of ADB and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n\nthe  program  cluster  concept  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Social  Security \n\n \n(i) \nReform Program to the Republic of Indonesia; and \n  \n(ii) \nthe loan of $250,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to the Republic of \nIndonesia  for  Phase  I  of  the  Financial  Governance  and  Social  Security  Reform  Program, \nwith  a  term  of  15  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  and  with  interest  to  be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n\n \n18 November 2002 \n \n\nTADAO CHINO \nPresident \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n26 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nSECTOR/SUBSECTOR ANALYSIS \n\nPension and Provident Funds \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  pension  system  in  Indonesia  targets  formal  sector  workers  exclusively,  is  not \n1. \nredistributive,  and  there  is  no  \u201cfirst  pillar\u201d  providing  basic  social  security  pension  coverage.1 \nApproximately  25 million  people  are  currently  covered  under  mandatory  programs  through \nstate-run  monopolies,  and  there  are  an  additional  1.0 million  participants  in  voluntary  pension \nschemes. The Indonesian social insurance system includes three mandatory programs covering \n(i) formal  private  sector  workers,  (ii) civil  servants,  and  (iii) the  armed  forces.  Jamsostek \n(Jaminan Sosial Tenaga Kerja) is not a pension scheme, but a mandatory savings scheme that \nprovides coverage for employees of private sector and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) with 10 \nor  more  employees  or  a  monthly  wage  cost  of  at  least  Rp1 million.  Taspen  (Tabungan  dan \nAsuransi  Pegawai  Negari) covers  all  civil  servants  and  Asabri  (Asuransi  Social  ABRI) covers \npolice,  and  civilian  and  military  defense  personnel.  These  mandatory  schemes  can  be \nsupplemented  by  voluntary  pensions  (dana  pensiuns)  of  two  types,  employer  pension  funds \n(DPPKs)  and  financial  institutions  pension  funds  (DPLKs).  A  summary  overview  of  pension \nprograms\u2019 membership, assets, liabilities, and cash flow is shown in Table 4 in the main text. \n\n \n2. \nThere  is  no  unified  policy,  supervisory,  regulatory,  or  legal  framework  for  the  pension \nsector  or  social  security  at  present.  Multiple  ministries  have  been  involved  in  the  control  and \nregulation  of  pension  programs  in  Indonesia.  The  Jamsostek  program  is  under  the  purview  of \nMinistry of Manpower and Transmigration, the Taspen program is controlled by the Ministry of \nFinance,  and  the  Asabri  program  is  controlled  by  the  Ministry  of  Defense.  The  Ministry  of \nFinance  Pensions  Directorate  has  authority  only  to  supervise  voluntary  pensions,  not  the \nmandatory state-monopoly pension programs, which are, effectively, unsupervised. \n\n3. \nThe  Government  pension  schemes  of  Taspen  and  Asabri  suffer  from  significant  future \nfunding problems stemming from increasing unfunded liabilities under the pay-as-you-go basis. \nExisting  debt  from  past  service  is  Rp342  trillion  and  Rp38.3  trillion  for  Taspen  and  Asabri, \nrespectively. Asabri is funded from current contributions and the Government\u2019s general budget. \nTaspen  is  partially  funded  from  contributions  and  a  small  accumulation,  but  is  largely  funded \nfrom the general budget. In 2000, contributions to Taspen are estimated to have covered only \nRp0.6 trillion of the Rp14.1 trillion pension payments, the balance of Rp13.5 trillion to be met by \nthe  Government\u2019s  general  budget  and  by  drawing  down  the  Taspen  fund.  Under  the  present \nsplit  with  Government  covering  75%  and  Taspen  covering  25%  of  pension  payments,  Taspen \nassets will be depleted by 2003. In view of low government salaries, benefit levels may not be \nadequate  if  not  properly  indexed  to  inflation.  However,  salary  increases  for  government \nemployees  will  further  reduce  the  financial  sustainability  of  pension  schemes  if  the  scheme \ndesign is not amended to compensate for this. As an example, possible 20% salary increases \nfor the next 5 years for government employees would impose significant additional liabilities of \nRp135  trillion  and  Rp17  trillion  for  Taspen  and  Asabri,  respectively.  The  projected  pension \npayments for Taspen2 are estimated as follows:    \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1 \n\nIn  August  2000,  a  Committee  for  the  Improvement  of  National  Social  Security  was  formed.  Coordinated  by  the \nVice President\u2019s Secretariat, this Committee is exploring options for introducing a minimum pension scheme and \nlegislation. \n\n2  ADB.  1998.

In real terms, the \nannual  contribution  from  the  general  budget  to  Taspen  is  expected  to  exceed  Rp20  trillion \naround  2010  and  Rp30  trillion  around  2070  under  current  arrangements.  Under  the  increased \nsalary scenario, that contribution would exceed Rp20 trillion in 2004, Rp30 trillion around 2010, \nand Rp40 trillion around 2020. \n \n5. \nFor  Jamsostek,  a  defined  contribution  plan,  the  primary  concern  is  that  the  plan  as \npresently  designed  will  not  provide  sufficient  retirement  income,  potentially  burdening  the \nGovernment  in  the  years  ahead.  Some  critical  concerns  for  Jamsostek  include:  low  wage \nreplacement  ratio  (small  retirement  income  provisions)  due  to  low  contribution  rate  and  poor \ninvestment  performance;  lack  of  annuitization  requirement;  low  coverage,  underreporting  of \nwages and lack of enforcement; lack of a common national identification number; and monopoly \nstatus  of  the  program,  precluding  the  development  of  potentially  more  effective  schemes. \nInstitutional and governance issues include: lack of transparency and disclosure; weak internal \ncorporate  governance  structures;  directed  investments  under  political  pressure  and  poor \nreturns;  high  administrative  and  operational  costs;  cross-subsidization  between  pension  and \nnon-pension  programs;  payment  of  dividends  and  taxes  to  the  Government  due  to  corporate \nstatus;  a  general  perception  among  participants  that  there  is  no  independent  audit;  and \ninadequate  management  information  systems,  raising  the  possibility  of  underreporting  or \nmisallocation of contributions \n \n6. \nGeneral  lack  of  confidence  in  Jamsostek,  low  returns,  and  inadequate  benefits \ncontribute  to  the  low  45%  compliance  rate  for  the  program.  Many  issues  for  Jamsostek  are \nthose  broadly  facing  the  pension  sector.  Improvements  in  supervision,  regulation,  and \ngovernance are required throughout, and industry practices and operations need to be brought \nin  line  with  international  standards.  Encouraging  competition  and  eliminating  state  monopolies \nwill  be  important  factors  in  facilitating  reform  measures.  Gradual  elimination  of  the  option  for \none-off  lump-sum  benefits  at  retirement  with  no  subsequent  lifetime  income  is  also  important. \nTaking lump-sum benefits, a preferred practice in Indonesia, leaves room for myopic spending \nby retirees with the potential to significantly reduce or eliminate retirement savings. Additionally, \nthe severance and service benefits mandated for employees under separate legislation are not \nrequired to be separately funded, and do not provide protection for employees against employer \ninsolvency, which has been a frequent occurrence. \n \n7. \nInvestment allocation by pension fund managers continues to be heavily skewed toward \ntime  deposits.  Such  investments  have  accounted  for  70%  of  the  portfolios  of  private  pension \nfund managers. Investments in Bank Indonesia Certificates also account for a significant portion \nof  pension  fund  portfolios.  These  investment  patterns  reflect  the  combination  of  low  risk  and \nrelatively  attractive  interest  rates  offered  by  these  instruments  as  well  as  a  lack  of  investor \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n28 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\ninterest  in  the  stock  market  due  to  the  weak  business  environment  and  market  governance \nissues. In part due to aggressive marketing by private pension companies, there appears to be \nan  increasing  awareness  of  the  importance  of  pensions  for  providing  income  continuity  into \nretirement. The number of participants in financial institution pension funds increased by 29.2% \nfrom 260,277 in 1999 to 336,213 in 2000, and estimated participants in 2001 were 400,000. \n \nB. \n \n\nInsurance Sector \n\nTable A1.2: Selected Insurance Sector Data in Indonesia \n (Rp trillion) \n \n1997 \n \n62 \n3.6 \n7.9 \n12.7 \n9.8 \n \n110 \n2.2 \n5.1 \n8.0 \n1.8 \n \n\n2000 \n \n62 \n7.3 \n14.2 \n18.7 \n14.9 \n \n111 \n3.5 \n8.2 \n12.6 \n2.7 \n \n\n1999 \n \n62 \n5.5 \n12.6 \n16.8 \n10.5 \n \n114 \n2.8 \n7.2 \n11.3 \n2.1 \n \n\n1998 \n \n62 \n4.9 \n9.0 \n13.7 \n10.4 \n \n113 \n3.6 \n6.2 \n10.4 \n2.9 \n \n\n1996 \n \n56 \n2.9 \n5.7 \n7.3 \n5.1 \n \n102 \n1.2 \n3.7 \n5.4 \n1.4 \n \n\n   \n  Life Insurance \n  Number of Companies \n  Total Premiums  \n  Total Investments  \n  Total Assets  \n  Total Technical Reserves  \n  Nonlife Insurance  \n  Number of Companies \n  Total Net Premiums  \n  Total Investments  \n  Total Assets  \n  Total Technical Reserves \n  \u201cSocial Insurance\u201d \n\n2001 \n \n61 \n9.2 \n17.3 \n22.4 \n17.9 \n \n109 \n\uf8e7 \n9.4 \n14.8 \n3.3 \n \n\nNumber of Companies  \n(all state monopolies) \n\n5 \n2.1 \n8.6 \n9.3 \n7.7 \n\n5 \n\uf8e7 \n\uf8e7 \n11.4 \n\uf8e7 \n\n5 \n1.9 \n9.4 \n10.0 \n6.9 \n\n5 \n2.7 \n10.4 \n11.5 \n9.9 \n\n5 \n2.1 \n9.7 \n10.2 \n7.9 \n\n5 \n3.1 \n12.7 \n14.6 \n12.7 \n\n \n  Total Premiums  \n  Total Investments \n  Total Assets  \n  Total Technical Reserves \n\uf8e7 = not available \nSource: Insurance Directorate, Ministry of Finance. \n \n8. \nThe  Government  announced  in  August  2002  its  plans  to  close  nine  insurance \ncompanies,  and  more  firms,  particularly  in  the  life  sector,  are  in  danger  of  insolvency.  It  is \ngenerally  agreed  that  a  number  of  life  insurance  companies  in  Indonesia  were  already \nfundamentally unsound before the Asian financial crisis. A life insurance company can continue \nto operate in a deficit situation, vulnerable to a financial shock, for many years if the deficit is not \napparent  and  policyholders  continue  to  pay  premiums  so  that  there  is  enough  cash  to  meet \nclaims. Issues causing or allowing financial weakness to persist in the life insurance industry in \nIndonesia include: \n \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\nsmall capital base of companies limiting ability to cope with fluctuations; \noveroptimistic product pricing locking companies into payments not supportable by \ninvestment income, further eroding capital; \nasset-liability mismatches exposing the companies to rollover risk; \nhigh acquisition and maintenance expenses; \nlack of management expertise and technical skills; \nlack of transparency due to unreliable accounting and financial reporting; \nlax enforcement of solvency requirements; \nlack of autonomy of the insurance regulator; \nweak internal governance; \ncontrolling shareholders with objectives not consistent with policyholder interests; \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n29\n\n \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\napparent  corruption  in  claims  settlement  practices  and  use  of  intermediaries  for \ndiversion of funds; and \nlack of consumer protection provisions and procedures. \n\n \nGeneral areas of weakness identified for the life sector are similar for the nonlife sector \n9. \nin  terms  of  a  reform  agenda.  However,  the  nonlife  sector  is  less  vulnerable  to  collapse  by \ncomparison. Its liabilities are short term and can be more easily managed, and the failure of a \nsingle company is less likely to be as devastating. Some concerns for the nonlife sector include \ncaptive  companies  established  primarily  to  service  parent  groups  and  related  organizations \n(rather  than  to  underwrite  insurance  on  a  commercial  basis);  lack  of  proper  controls  for \nengaging in surety insurance (loans, performance bonds, promissory notes); excessive reliance \non reinsurance cover; and writing international reinsurance with limited capacity and expertise. \n \nAdditional key issues in the insurance sector include a weak competitive position for the \n10. \nopening  of  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations \nin  2003, \nunderdevelopment of the private sector, elimination of state monopolies, government exposure \nin SOEs, enhancement of the legal and regulatory system, development of tax-based incentives \nfor  socially  desirable  forms  of  insurance,  and  development  of  institutions  and  legislation  to \nimprove consumer protection. \n \nC. \n \n11. \nCapital  markets  in  Indonesia  are  small  and  underdeveloped  in  comparison  to  the \nbanking  sector.  By  the  end  of  2001,  there  were  189  securities  companies  licensed  to  act  as \nbroker-dealers,  116  licensed  to  act  as  underwriters,  and  47  licensed  to  act  as  investment \nmanagers.  In  terms  of  institutional  investors,  there  were  108  mutual  funds,  60  venture  capital \nfunds,  62  life  insurance  companies,  109  nonlife  insurance  companies,  5  social  insurance \ncompanies, 327 private pension funds, and 3 public pension schemes. \n \n12. \nThe ability of firms to raise funds from Indonesia's capital markets is limited by the small \nsize  and  low  liquidity  of  these  markets\u2014with  market  capitalization  of  the  Jakarta  Stock \nExchange  at  only  16%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  2001  (among  the  lowest  in  the \nregion).3  Apart  from  setbacks  due  to  political  and  macroeconomic  instability,  growth  and \ndevelopment of capital markets in Indonesia have been hindered by: \n\nCapital Markets Sector \n\n(ASEAN)  markets \n\n \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nhighly concentrated share ownership patterns among listed firms that contribute to \nlow market liquidity as well as weak corporate governance;4 \nweak  governance  at  the  regulator,  financial  institution,  and  firm  levels,  which \nincreases the scope for market manipulation and undermines public confidence; \na small institutional investor sector: combined assets of the domestic pensions and \ninsurance  sectors  amounted  to  Rp51.2  trillion  in  2001  or  approximately  3.4%  of \nGDP; \ncompany groups that include banks as well as industrial firms, where capital needs \nare typically met through intra-group lending; \ninvestor  bias  toward  bank  deposits:  this  is  particularly  pronounced  among \ninstitutional investors, whose portfolios are dominated by bank instruments.

Multinationals as well as large domestic firms have the option to raise \nmoney  offshore  where  costs  are  lower,  while  increasing  correlation  between \nmarkets  due  to  globalization  has  reduced  the  incentive  for  industrial  country \ninvestors to diversify into emerging markets.6 \n\nConsolidated Regulatory and Supervisory Authorities \n\n \nSelected capital market indicators are given in Table 3 in the main text. \n \nD. \n \n13. \nThe emergence of integration of regulatory and supervisory powers over different types \nof  financial  institutions  within  a  single  agency  first  gained  recognition  in  the  1980s  as  Norway \nand  Denmark  and  then  Sweden  adopted  an  integrated  approach  to  regulation.  The  banking \ncrises  in  these  countries  impacted  the  decision  to  adopt  this  structure,  and  subsequently \nincreasing  interest  and  adoption  of  this  approach  in  other  regions,  including  Asia,  have  been \nseen.  The  institutional  innovation  and  experience  with  implementation,  in  most  countries  that \nhave adopted this approach, are still at an early stage.  \n \n14. \nThe  specifics  of  institutional  responsibilities  and  powers  have  varied  somewhat  across \nthe group of innovators, and motivations underlying the move toward regulatory integration have \nincluded: \n \n\nthe  need  for  greater  consistency  in  the  application  of  policy  across  different \nindustries (i.e., regulatory neutrality); \nthe ability to make more efficient use of scarce regulatory resources; \neconomies of scale; \nincapacity  of  small  nonbank  financial  sectors  to  sustain  separate  and  effective \nregulatory agencies;  \nmore effective supervision of financial conglomerates; and \nthe opportunity to improve the quality of supervision of specific sectors. \n\n \nEfficient  use  of  regulatory  resources,  regulatory  neutrality,  and  the  opportunity  to \n15. \nimprove  the  quality  of  supervision  of  specific  sectors  are  motivations  that  remain  consistent \n\n                                                 \n5  Until the crisis, Indonesia had a balanced budget policy that did not allow for treasury bills and government bonds. \n\nThe first bond issue to finance recapitalization was in May 1999. \n\n6  The  changing  composition  of  investors  in  Indonesia's  equity  markets  reflects  this  growing  difficulty  in  remaining \nattractive to foreign investors. In 1996, investor composition was roughly equally split between local and foreign \ninvestors, while by 2001 foreign participation had dropped to about 10%. \n\n\facross  countries.

Stronger  financial  governance \nwill  not  only  help  reduce  the  likelihood  and  severity  of  future  crises  (and  consequently  help  safeguard \nagainst corresponding marked increases in the incidence of poverty) but will also play a powerful, albeit \nindirect, role in poverty reduction through facilitating long-term economic growth. \n \nB. \nAnalysis: \nFinancial sector development facilitates long-term economic growth by supporting productivity growth and \nstimulating  savings  and  investment.  Of  these  two  channels,  raising  productivity  is  the  chief  way  of \npromoting  long-term  economic  growth.  Financial  sector  development  can  raise  productivity  by \n(i) improving resource allocation, and (ii) strengthening the monitoring of resource usage. A key factor in \nsupporting  growth  through  this  channel  is  the  effectiveness  of  the  legal,  regulatory,  and  supervisory \nsystem in supporting financial sector efficiency. A well-governed financial sector can also stimulate growth \nand  employment  generation  by  increasing  investor  confidence  and  restoring  the  flow  of  much-needed \ninvestment capital to Indonesia. \n \nThat growth is instrumental to poverty reduction is incontrovertible. Growth, however, is turbulent and not \nnecessarily pro-poor. Growth entails change, which the poor may often not be well equipped to cope with. \nA  well-governed  financial  sector  that  facilitates  competition  can  help  make  growth  user-friendlier  by \n(i) improving  access  to  savings,  credit,  and  insurance  instruments,  which  enable  the  poor  to  cushion \nshocks as well as take advantage of opportunities created by change, and (ii) allowing for better terms on \nthose instruments. \n \nAs  noted  above,  a  well-governed  financial  sector  also  reduces  the  likelihood  and  severity  of  financial \ncrises.  Balanced  financial  sector  development  can  likewise  promote  financial  system  stability  and \nstrengthening  by  allowing  risks  to  be  more  evenly  spread  among  different  types  of  financial  institutions \nand  spurring  competition  between  them.  In  hindsight,  one  of  the  indications  signaling  Indonesia's \nvulnerability to the recent crises, may have been found in the heavily unbalanced structural composition \nof its financial sector\u2014characterized by bank dominance and underdeveloped capital markets. \n \nReducing  the  scope  for  regulatory  arbitrage  between  different  types  of  financial  institutions  can  help \npromote  balanced  financial  sector  development  and  the  establishment  of  a  consolidated  regulatory  and \nsupervisory  authority  can  significantly  facilitate  this  goal.  Also,  support  for  the  development  and \nstrengthening of certain types of financial institutions (e.g., pension funds and insurance companies) can \ndirectly and markedly stimulate development of other types of financial institutions (e.g., capital markets) \nby generating demand for their products. \n \nThe  strengthening  of  social  protection  programs  is  also  fundamentally  interrelated  with  financial  sector \ndevelopment. The pension and insurance sectors play direct and key roles in provision of instruments \nfor social protection. Their role, moreover, will assume increasing importance as reliance on family or \nindigenous systems of social security becomes less viable due to declining family size and increasing \npopulation  mobility.  Strengthening  these  sectors  through  improved  regulation  and  supervision  and \nwhere  possible,  through  promoting  competition,  is  fundamental  if  Indonesia  is  to  develop  an  effective \nsocial safety net system. \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n55\n\n \n\n \n\nSocial Issues \n\nParticipation Process \n\n \nC. \nStakeholder analysis prepared    \n \nParticipation strategy  \n \nD. \n \n \nSubject \nResettlementb \nGender \nAffordability \nLabor \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nYes \n\nYes \n\n \n \nOutput Prepareda \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \nNo negative impacts to be mitigated  None \nNo negative impacts to be mitigated  None \nNo negative impacts to be mitigated  None \nNone \nRedundancy severance packages/ \nretraining programs as necessary \n\nSignificant,  \nNonsignificant, None \nNone \nNone \nNone \nNonsignificant.

This program loan promotes poverty reduction through \nall  three  channels.  Sustainable  economic  growth  is  underpinned  by  a  well-regulated  and \nsupervised  financial  system.  This  in  turn  requires  good  governance,  a  well-developed  legal \nenvironment  for  regulation  and  institutional  capacity  for  supervision,  reduced  opportunities  for \ngraft and corruption, and greater access to timely information by industry players. The Program \nsupports  reforms  in  the  pension  and  insurance  sector,  and  capital  markets,  enabling  further \npotential  contributions  to  growth.  The  Program  supports  the  development  of  a  national \nframework for delivering social protection and helps to improve the supervisory frameworks for \npension and insurance firms that deliver services for the working population.  \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nAbout 35 million people or 37% of the labor force are in the formal sector. Of these, 15% \n2. \nare poor and another 15% are near poor.1 By 2001, 60% of the formal sector was covered by a \nmandatory  state  scheme,  the  main  source  of  coverage  for  lower  income  classes  and  the \nworking poor; however, compliance was less than 50%.  \n \n3. \nPrivate insurance supplements the state programs. In 2000, about 1.2 million employees \nwere  covered  under  employer  pension  funds,  and  financial  institution  pensions  funds2  and \ninsurance  premiums  had  risen  to  Rp7.2  trillion.  The  demand  for  insurance  for  workers  in  the \ninformal sector is growing. A number of insurance companies have programs targeting the lower \nend of the retail market such as pedicab drivers and sidewalk vendors. In general however, the \nlower  end  of  the  retail  market  is  underdeveloped.  Further  expansion  must  be  matched  by \nadequate  regulation,  supervision,  and  enforcement  to  protect  consumers  against  risk  of \ninsurance failure and mismanagement.  \n \nB. \n\nPoverty Impact Assessment of the Program \n\nTaken  as  a  whole,  the  reforms  to  the  financial  sector  proposed  under  this  cluster  loan \n4. \nare  necessary  steps  toward  strengthening  the  financial  sector  and  developing  a  system  of \nnational social security. The measures to be undertaken under the first loan of the cluster are \ndescribed in the four subsections below: \n \n\n1. \n\nConsolidate Regulatory and Supervisory Authority \n\n5. \nThe  program  for  strengthening  existing  financial  sector  regulation  and  consolidating \nfinancial  sector  supervision  and  regulation  facilitates  regulatory  neutrality,  reduces  regulatory \ndistortions,  thereby  promoting  better  allocation  of  resources  to  support  growth.  Including \nmandatory  social  insurance,  programs  under  the  authority  will  provide  protection  for  the \n25 million  participants  in  core  pension  schemes  and  the  more  than  30 million  participants  in \nprivate  sector  insurance  programs.  Increased  harmonization  of  standards  in  line  with \ninternational  best  practices  and  greater  efforts  to  increase  compliance  and  enforcement  with \nrules and regulations will lead to a more robust system and development of the financial sector, \nand reduce vulnerability to external shock. \n  \n6. \nThe consolidation of regulatory and supervisory authority under a single roof under the \nsecond  loan  in  the  cluster  is  likely  to  require  smaller  staff  numbers  than  under  the  current \nsystem.  This  will  lead  to  either  redeployment  or  retrenchment  of  staff  emanating  from  Bank \nIndonesia  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  each  with  their  own  employment  and  separation  rules. \nPart  of  the  preparation  for  the  establishment  of  the  consolidated  regulatory  and  supervisory \nauthority  for  financial  services  (OJK),  supported  under  TA  3850-INO:  Establishment  of  a \nFinancial  Services  Authority  will  include  a  further  review  of  the  potential  labor  impact  and \nrecommendations  for  an  equitable  process.  The  Government  has  represented  that,  although \nredeployment  is  expected,  retrenchment  is  highly  unlikely.  It  should  also  be  noted  that  state \nemployees engaged in regulation and supervision are not drawn from the lowest level of the civil \nservice that comprises the vulnerable working poor, and past government reorganizations have \nresulted in redeployment rather than retrenchment. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Calculated based on the proportion of the workforce in the formal sector in the lowest and second lowest quintile \n\nin 1999 (to be recalculated for 2000).  \n\n2  ADB. 2000. Indonesia Poverty Assessment. Manila. \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n57\n\n2. \n\nEstablish an Effective Anti-Money Laundering Regime \n\n \n\n7. \nIndonesia  needs  to  continue  to  work  to  improve  its  anti-money  laundering  regime. \nMoney  laundering  activities  have  their  origins  in  graft,  corruption,  and  other  forms  of  criminal \nactivity. These activities undermine the Government\u2019s legitimacy as well as investor confidence. \nThe development of an effective anti-money laundering regime will provide the Government with \nkey  tools  in  its  fight  against  graft  and  corruption  and  is  fundamental  to  strengthening  market \ngovernance and investor confidence. Indonesia has been included in the Financial Action Task \nForce on Money Laundering\u2019s (FATF) list of Non-Cooperative Countries and Territories (NCCT), \nand  it  needs  to  substantially  comply  with  FATF  recommendations  to  avoid  countermeasures. \nThe  countermeasures  would  significantly  impede  the  ability  of  financial  institutions  located  in \nIndonesia  and  of  Indonesian  financial  institutions  located  abroad  to  conduct  international \ntransactions.  Imposition  of  countermeasures  would  have  a  disastrous  impact  on  the  country\u2019s \neconomic recovery. The loan will support the development of a legal framework and the building \nof institutional capacity necessary to implement an effective anti-money laundering regime. \n \n\n3. \n\nStrengthen Financial and Corporate Governance \n\n8. \nThe  Program  will  strengthen  transparency  and  disclosure  of  market  transactions  and \nincrease efficiencies. Corporate responsibility and accountability are promoted through requiring \npublic  companies  to  have  independent  commissioners  and  audit  committees  composed  of  a \nmajority  of  independent  commissioners,  and  imposing  adequate  liabilities  on  auditors  and \nliability on commissioners for false or misleading public information and board decisions. Market \nstability  is  promoted  through  prudential  safeguards  such  as  increased  capital  requirements, \nenhanced  rules  of  disclosure,  and  the  adoption  of  an  early  warning  system  of  financial \nexposure.  These  measures  will \ninvestor  participation \ncontributing to market liquidity and an expanded capital market to support growth. \n \n\nincrease  public  confidence  and \n\n4. \n\nImprove Pensions, Provident Funds, and Insurance, and Develop a National \nSocial Security System \n\n9. \nThese  reforms  are  intended  to  strengthen  the  supervisory  framework  and  promote  a \nsound  system  for  social  benefits,  to  improve  the  system  for  pensions  and  provident  funds  to \nprovide adequate retirement income, and eventually to expand coverage to a wider segment of \nthe  population.  Strengthening  the  capacity  of  institutional  investors  can  deepen  the  capital \nmarkets  and  enable  the  expansion  of  the  social  protection  system  and  the  provision  of  basic \npublic infrastructure.  \n \n10. \nThe  measures  to  be  undertaken  under  this  reform  area  include:  (i) assessment  and \nspecial  audits  of  mandatory  programs,  (ii) strengthening  regulatory  and  supervisory  capacity, \n(iii) strategic  restructuring  of  the  pension  and  insurance  sector,  and  (iv) development  of  a \nnational social security law and policy framework for pension and insurance. \n \n11. \nThe Program supports assessment of unfunded liabilities of mandatory social insurance \nschemes,  enabling  preparation  of  financial  options  to  reduce  these  liabilities  and  prevent \nunanticipated demands on the public budget. \n \n12. \nRegulatory  and  supervisory  capacities  will  be  enhanced  through  measures  to  improve \ngovernance  and  timely  disclosure  of  information  regarding  financial  position,  solvency,  and \nownership  of  insurance  companies  as  well  as  establishment  of  minimum  competencies  and \ntraining for insurance and pension fund supervisors and examiners. Prudential safeguards and \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nenforcement  of  capital-based  requirements  will  also  provide  greater  consumer  protection  by \nensuring soundness of companies and their ability to meet obligations. \n \n13. \nDevelopment  of  a  national  social  security  law  and  policy  framework  for  pension  and \ninsurance  requires  a  comprehensive  evaluation  of  existing  laws  and  frameworks  impacting \npensions, insurance, and social protection. Such a law is required to ensure adequate system \nfor  social  security  in  the  future,  but  requires  decisions  with  far-reaching  implications  regarding \nthe  role  of  the  state  and  the  private  sector  in  providing  social  security  and  must  be  subject  to \ndiscussion  and  debate.  The  Program  supports  a  feasibility  study  addressing  options  for \nimproving  the  current  system  and  expanding  access  to  the  informal  sector  to  support  the \ndrafting  of  a  new  law  on  social  security.  The  Program  further  supports  discussion  of  the  draft \nlaw with a broad range of civil society.  \n \nC. \n\nPoverty Impact Assessment Matrix \n\n14. \nTaken as a whole, the Program is poor-neutral in its direct impact and indirectly pro-poor \nsupporting  the  three  pillars  of  ADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy,  namely,  pro-poor  sustainable \neconomic growth, good governance, and social development. A poverty impact matrix is shown \nfor the overall Program as each component of the Program contributes to the same outcome.  \n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n59\n\nMitigation or Enhancement \nMeasures \n\nPotential negative labor \nimpacts resulting from \nconsolidation of regulation and \nsupervisory authority, if any, \nare likely to be small. These \nwill be addressed under the \ntechnical assistance (TA) \nsupporting preparation of \nestablishment of the financial \nservices authority (OJK). \n\nChannel \nLabor \n\nMarkets and \nPrices \n\n \nTable A6: Poverty Impact of the Program \n\nIndirect Impact on  \nthe Poor\u2014Medium Term \nHelps promote adequate retirement \nincome for the working poor through \nstrengthening contractual saving \nschemes.  \n \nStrengthens financial sector \nregulation and supervision, \nsupporting economic growth and \nemployment. \n\nImproved governance and financial \nsoundness of mandatory social \ninsurance schemes help reduce \nvulnerability to poverty for the \nworking poor. \n\nExpansion of social security system \nto informal sector will provide greater \ncoverage for the working poor. \n \nHarmonization of standards and \nstrengthened governance can \nstimulate competition and lower \nprices for social insurance products \nmaking them more affordable to the \npoor. \n \n\nOther Stakeholders \n\nIncreased corporate \ngovernance and improved \nmonitoring reduce the \npossibility for market \nmanipulation, fraud, and \nabuse. The cost of these \nfinancial crimes has a direct \nimpact on business \nconfidence, future investment, \nand consequently labor \nabsorption. \n \nGreater investor confidence \nleads to greater capital \nformation increasing pool of \nfunds for short-term and \nlonger-term investment. \n \n \n\nIncreased prudential \nstandards and greater efforts \nto increase compliance and \nenforcement with rules and \nregulations leads to a more \nrobust system thereby \nreducing vulnerability to \nexternal shock and price \nswings. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAccess to \nPublic Service \n\nNet Impact \nNarrative \n\n \n\nStrengthening regulation and \nsupervision for contractual saving \nschemes can support sector \ndevelopment and increase the \navailability of long-term financing to \nsupport projects such as low-income \nhousing and infrastructure \ndevelopment. \n \nThe direct impact of the Program is neutral with regard to the poor. The indirect impact is pro-poor. \nThe actions taken under the Program will promote sustainable growth and enable a more robust and \nefficient financial sector where participants are better informed and protected. Improved governance \nin the capital market improves investor confidence and provides an alternative to the banking sector, \nthus reducing an over reliance on bank debt and the potential for external shock. Increased access \nto financial markets creates employment opportunities for skilled and unskilled labor, and increased \nopportunities for small businesses. \n \nPension and insurance reforms enables workers (including the working poor) and their families to \nobtain contracted benefits and to provide greater protection in illness and old age, and in the event of \nthe loss of a breadwinner. \n \nIncreased transparency, stability, and supervision in financial markets increases the opportunities for \nlocal government, pension plans, and insurance schemes to raise funds and develop long-term \ninvestment and long-term savings instruments. This enables expansion of the provision of public \nservices to the poor and improves the reliability of the social protection system. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT \n\nThe Program will not have any direct and immediate environmental impacts and \n\n \n1. \nit is expected that any indirect and long-term environmental impacts will be neutral. \n \n\nPotential Environmental Impacts \n\nPolicy Actions \n1.
