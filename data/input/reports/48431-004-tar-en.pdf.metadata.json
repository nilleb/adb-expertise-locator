The  Equipping  Youth  for \nEmployment  Project  (EYE)\u2014the  first  ADB  loan  for  Myanmar\u2019s  education  sector\u2014aims  to \nstrengthen the country\u2019s education and skills base and promote inclusive growth and job creation.1 \nThe  EYE  supports  reforms  to  realign  secondary  education  and  TVET  to  Myanmar\u2019s  evolving \nworkforce needs. These reforms are vital to equip youth with skills for employment in a modern \neconomy and meet employers\u2019 skill demands. The project\u2019s impact will be education and skills \nbase for inclusive growth enhanced, and its outcome will be secondary education subsector and \nTVET realigned to evolving labor force needs and equitably expanded. The EYE has three outputs: \n(i)  policy  frameworks  and  capacities  for  cohesive,  workforce-responsive  secondary  education \nsubsector and TVET enhanced; (ii) new secondary education subsector curriculum delivered and \naccess expanded; and (iii) new TVET programs introduced and access expanded. The project\u2019s \ntotal cost is $105.0 million, with $98.5 million financed by a loan from ADB.2  \n \n2. \nADB and the European Union (EU) have been closely collaborating with the Ministry of \nEducation (MOE) and other development partners to design and implement education reforms, \nfocusing strategically on secondary education and TVET.3 In 2019, the EU and the Government \nof Myanmar signed the financing agreement for  Education Sector Reform Contract with grant \nfinancing of up to \u20ac221 million, including budget support of \u20ac175 million for secondary education \nand  TVET  reforms  and  complementary  measures. 4  The  proposed  transaction  technical \nassistance (TA) will support a subset of the complementary measures. Enhancing ongoing ADB \n(EYE) and EU support, the EU will finance the proposed TA in the amount of \u20ac24 million ($26.0 \nmillion equivalent) and ADB will administer it. The TA will support continued reforms to better align \nsecondary education and TVET to Myanmar\u2019s evolving skill demands. The TA aligns with ADB\u2019s \nMyanmar country partnership strategy, 2017-2021, that focuses on strengthening human capital \nto  promote  a  skilled  workforce  and  increased  employment,  and  enable  the  poor  and \ndisadvantaged to benefit from economic growth.5 It also aligns with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and will \nhelp  address  remaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities  by  improving  education  and  training \n(operational priority 1) and accelerate progress in gender equality (operational priority 2).6  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nJustification \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nWeak human capital poses a critical obstacle to Myanmar\u2019s development, threatening to \ntrap  the  economy  in  a  low  value-added  model  based  on  cheap,  unskilled  labor  and  natural \n\n \n\n1   ADB. Myanmar: Equipping Youth for Employment Project.  \n2   As of 30 September 2019, cumulative contract awards reached $20.9 and disbursements reached $13.3 million. The \nproject is rated an actual problem as of September 2019 because of startup delays. Implementation progress has \nimproved, and thus project rating is expected to improve in 2020 after the midterm review. \n\n3   Development  partner support for  education in Myanmar is concentrated in primary education, while  ADB and EU \n\nprovide the main international support for secondary education and TVET.   \n\n4  European Commission.

Secondary education supplies \nthe  largest  share  (50%)  of  entrants  into  nonagricultural  formal  wage  labor.  However,  outdated \ncurricula  and  rote-based  teaching  and  learning  approaches  mean  that  school-leavers  lack \nfoundation skills (e.g., literacy and numeracy) and soft skills (e.g., critical thinking, problem-solving, \ncreativity, and communication skills). Likewise, TVET has struggled to equip youth with vocation-\nspecific hard skills (e.g., construction or mechanical skills) and with entrepreneurship and other \nbusiness-related  skills.  To  address  these  challenges,  the  MOE  initiated  reforms  under  the \nNational Education Strategic Plan, 2016\u20132021 to realign secondary education and TVET to meet \nevolving  labor  market  skill  needs.  However, reversing  decades  of  underinvestment  will  require \nsustained  support.  ADB  and  the  EU  are  committed  to  support  sequenced  reforms  under  the \ncurrent National Education Strategic Plan and any subsequent national plans.  \n \n4. \nThe EYE is providing introduction training of the new curriculum which will not be sufficient \nfor  teachers  to  change  their  teaching  and  learning  practice.  It  is  supporting  the  introduction  of \ncompetency-based modular short courses at selected public TVET schools which require further \nexpansion to meet demands from industry. Building on key initial reforms supported by EYE and \ncomplementing the budget support provided by the EU (para 2), the proposed TA will support the \nMOE in advancing critical follow-on reforms. First, it will strengthen MOE capacity to formulate \nand  implement  cohesive  and  evidence-based  reforms  to  align  skill  supply  with  evolving  skill \ndemand. Second, as part of a multipronged approach to improve teaching and learning, the TA \nwill support the MOE to formulate and introduce (i) a continuing professional development (CPD) \nsystem  for  in-service  secondary  education  teachers  and  (ii)  updated  pre-service  education \nprograms to prepare future high school teachers to deliver the new curriculum. This will enhance \nthe  MOE\u2019s  overhaul  of  the  secondary  education  curriculum  (including  textbooks  and  teacher \nguides) and annual rounds of in-service training of teachers to deliver the improved curriculum \nsupported  under  EYE.10 Third,  the  TA  will  provide  follow-on  support  to  the  MOE  to  (i)  reform \ncurricula of longer-term TVET programs at upper secondary and post-secondary levels; and (ii) \nstrengthen MOE cooperation with nongovernment organizations and industries to diversify TVET \nprovision, including targeting females and ethnic group youth. The TA will also feed into a potential \nsecond phase of EYE.11  \n \n\n \n\n7   S.  D\u2019Amico,  C.  Spohr,  and  S.  Tanaka.  2015.  Myanmar  Human  Capital  Development,  Employment,  and  Labor \n\nMarkets. ADB Economics Working Paper Series. No. 469. Manila: ADB.   \n\n8   Females are particularly likely to be trapped in vulnerable employment: 53% of working females age 20\u201329 are own \n\naccount or contributing family workers, versus 47% for their male counterparts. \n\n9   Myanmar\u2019s  Private  Sector  Development  Framework  and  Action  Plan  identifies  human  capital  as  a  core  priority: \n\nhttp://www.dica.gov.mm/sites/dica.gov.mm/files/document-files/psd_framework_final_01_apr_englidh.pdf.   \n\n10  In  May  2019,  EYE  provided  14  days  of  in-service  teacher  training  to  support  introduction  of  the  new  grade  6 \ncurriculum, with further annual rounds planned for 2020\u20132022 to support introduction of the new curriculum for grades \n7 to 12.  \n\n11  The proposed provision of a transaction technical assistance (TA) after the approval of EYE reflects (i) signing of the \nfinancing agreement of EU\u2019s assistance program with the Government of Myanmar in February 2019 (para. 2), (ii) \nthe technical nature of support, and (iii) EU preference for the TA modality in lieu of project grant modality, which \nwould require administration by the MOE. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fOutputs and Activities \n\nThe  TA  will  have  three  outputs,  as  outlined  below  and  elaborated  in  the  terms  of \n\nB. \n \n5. \nreference.12 \n \n6. \nOutput  1:  Evidence-based  post-primary  education  reforms  effectively  supported, \nmonitored, and disseminated. The TA will provide cohesive and crosscutting umbrella support \nfor post-primary education (focusing on secondary education and TVET) to align with evolving \nlabor  market  demands  for  foundation  skills,  soft  skills,  and  technical  and  vocational  skills.  In \nparticular,  it  will  support  (i)  analysis,  evidence-based  planning,  and  crosscutting  capacity \ndevelopment,  focusing  on  post-primary  education  reform,  and  (ii)  TA-wide  coordination, \nmonitoring and evaluation, gender actions, and communication.   \n \n7. \nAnalytical and evidence-based planning and capacity development. First, the TA will \nsupport  the  MOE  to  consolidate  and  analyze  data  from  various  sources  (including  via \ncollaboration with the Ministry of Labour, Immigration, and Population) on skill supply and evolving \nskill  demands,  including  disaggregation  by  gender,  geographic  areas,  and  other  social \ndimensions. 13 It  will  develop  bilingual  (Myanmar  language  and  English)  knowledge  products \ndistilling national and international analysis and experience. Second, the TA will help the MOE \ntranslate  national  analysis  and  international  experience  into  the  national  education  plan\u2019s  next \nphase  (2021\u20132026)  and  longer-term  skills  development  strategies  for  Myanmar  to  improve \nregional  and  global  competitiveness.  It  will  support  Myanmar\u2019s  hosting  of  and  participation  in \ninternational forums to bring insights from global practices to Myanmar\u2019s key reforms. Third, the \nTA will support MOE capacities in engaging stakeholders at central to grassroot levels (e.g., local \ngovernments, the private sector, civil society groups working with female and ethnic group youth, \nand  private  education  and  training  providers)  in  reform-related  dialogue.  It  will  enhance \ncoordination  mechanisms,  including  the  government\u2013industry  Working  Committee  on  Human \nCapital,  and  effective  use  of  affordable  digital  technology,  information,  education,  and \ncommunication tools for dissemination and social marketing of key reforms.14  \n \n8. \nSupport  for  TA-wide  coordination,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  gender  actions, \ncommunication,  and  administration.  The  TA  will  help  ensure  strong  ownership  and \ncoordination  across  all  outputs  with  relevant  departments  of  the  MOE.  It  will  also  support \nmonitoring and evaluation across all initiatives (including disaggregation by sex, ethnic group, and \nother dimensions), gender actions, communication plan implementation, other crosscutting work, \nand the TA-financed procurement of goods (e.g., learning materials and minor equipment).  \n \n9. \nOutput 2: New secondary education continuing professional development system \nand pre-service teacher education program introduced. The TA will support the introduction \nof two critical reforms to improve teaching and learning outcomes in secondary education: (i) a \n\n \n\n12 The terms of reference for consultants are accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. EYE\u2019s design \nand monitoring framework will be updated upon approval of the proposed TA during the midterm review of EYE, to \nreflect  the key activities  of  the  TA.  The  updated  design  and  monitoring  framework  will be  included  in  the  project \nadministration manual.  \n\n13  Such data sources include the MOE\u2019s Education Management Information System, the November 2019 Intercensal \nSurvey,  and  the  periodic  Labor  Force  Survey.  The  TA  will  build  on  initial  ADB-supported  geographic  information \nsystem mapping of school networks and employment patterns.  \n\n14 The Working Committee on Human Capital was established to support implementation of the human capital pillar of \nthe Private Sector Development Framework and Action Plan (footnote 7) and is chaired by the MOE Deputy Minister. \nThe TA may also support the proposed TVET Council (expected to be established by 2021) in promoting TVET-\nfocused coordination.  \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nschool-based  CPD  system  and  (ii)  upgraded  pre-service  education  programs  for  future  high \nschool  teachers.  The  TA  will  enhance  EYE-supported  introduction  of  new  textbooks,  teacher \nguides, and annual teacher training rounds, and will build on EU support for school-based CPD \nmodule development.  \n \n10. \nContinuous professional development for in-service secondary education teachers. \nThe TA will build on the ongoing EYE and EU support to introduce basic CPD activities for middle \nschool teachers linked to the rollout of the revised grade 6 curriculum in school year (SY) 2019/20. \nFirst, it will support capacity building at the central to school level to manage and deliver CPD \nlinked to the remainder of curriculum reforms, including extending high school through grade 12 \nin SY2022/23.15 Second, it will support digital technology and media-based materials to support \nCPD, which will be sensitive to gender and  ethnic group. Third, the TA will support development \nand institutionalization of a national CPD system to provide continued local and in-school support \nto teachers after the completion of ongoing curriculum reforms in SY2022/23. CPD programs will \nensure equitable access to female and ethnic group teachers. \n \nUpgraded pre-service teacher education for future high school teachers. First, the \n11. \nTA will help the MOE revise the curriculum for Bachelor of Education programs for future high \nschool  teachers  to  align  with  the  forthcoming  3-year  (grades  10\u201312)  high  school  curriculum.16 \nNew  curricula  will  be  sensitive  to  gender  and  ethnic  group.  Second,  the  TA  will  enhance  the \nprofessional skills and competencies of teacher educators at the three universities offering the \nBachelor  of  Education  programs. 17  Third,  the  TA  will  strengthen  the  Bachelor  of  Education \nprograms\u2019 management and quality assurance. The TA will help these three universities to forge \ntwinning  arrangements  with  international  teacher  education  institutions  to  establish  long-term \npartnerships to strengthen research capacity and teacher education management.  \n \n12. \nOutput  3:  Technical  vocational  education  and  training  programs  diversified  and \nbetter  aligned  with  evolving  labor  market  demands.  The  TA  will  support  the  MOE  in \naccelerating  reforms  to  improve  TVET  quality  and  relevance;  diversify  TVET  offerings;  and \nexpand  TVET  access,  including  for  female  students,  disadvantaged  youth,  and  underserved \nareas. Enhancing EYE and EU support, the TA will support longer-term TVET program reforms \nand new partnerships in TVET provision.  \n \n13. \nDevelopment  of  revised  curricula  for  government  technical  high  schools  and \ngovernment technical institutes. The TA will support MOE\u2019s introduction of new curricula for \ngovernment technical high schools and government technical institutes to better align with skill \ndemands  from  industries.  This  includes  capacity  development  of  trainers  in  partnerships  with \nindustry, and procurement of the required materials and equipment to support preparation and \ninitial roll-out of the revised TVET curricula. Social marketing will aim to attract more females into \nTVET, especially to nontraditional skill areas (e.g., manufacturing and electrical works). The TA \nwill help the MOE to develop a strategic plan on infrastructure, equipment, and materials for the \nrevised TVET programs, to be financed by government budget and/or international support.  \n \n14. \nExpansion of technical vocational education and training partnerships. The TA will \nhelp  the  MOE  expand  strategic  partnerships  with  international  nongovernment  organizations \n\n \n\n15 Following  the  MOE\u2019s  introduction  of  a  new  kindergarten  year  in  SY2016/17,  the  extension  of  high  school  (upper \nsecondary) through grade 12 (supported by EYE) in SY2022/23 will bring Myanmar up to international norm of a \nkindergarten\u201312 system.   \n\n16 These include a 5-year program for high school graduates and a 2-year program to upgrade middle school teachers. \n17 These  are  Yangon  University  of  Education,  Sagaing  University  of  Education,  and  University  of  Development  of \n\nNational Races. \n\n \n\n\fCost and Financing  \n\n(INGOs) and the private sector to diversify short-term TVET programs to include additional skill \nareas  and reach  more  youth  and  workers,  including  females  and  males  in  underserved  areas \n(including areas with large ethnic group populations). First, the TA will help the MOE collaborate \nwith INGOs and local partners to extend TVET short courses, through harmonizing approaches, \nensuring quality control, and facilitating issuance of completion certificates by the MOE. The TA \nwill support competitive tendering of INGOs to provide short courses in selected high priority skill \nand geographic areas to open more room for INGOs to operate effectively in Myanmar\u2019s TVET \nsector.18 Second, in coordination with the government\u2013industry Working Committee on Human \nCapital,  the  TA  will  support  the  MOE  to  expand  MOE\u2013industry  collaboration  in  reskilling  and \nupskilling  youth  and  existing  workers.  This  will  include  support  to  (i)  develop  operational \nguidelines for training organized jointly by public TVET schools and private sector entities, and (ii) \npilot a training partnership fund to cover eligible costs for the training. \n \nC. \n \n15. \nThe  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $26.1  million,  of  which  $26.0  million  (not  exceeding  \u20ac24.0 \nmillion) will be financed on a grant basis by the EU and administered by ADB. The key expenditure \nitems are listed in Appendix 1. Indicatively, output 1 is estimated to cost $5.1 million, output 2 is \nestimated  at  $7.3  million,  and  output  3  is  estimated  at  $10.7  million.  In  addition,  ADB \nadministration cost, contingencies, and audit cost are estimated at $2.9 million. The Government \nof Myanmar will provide the balance in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation for \nselected consultants, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \n16. \nThe EU grant will finance the TA activities and outputs, including operational expenses, in \nthe form of consulting services, trainings, workshops, conferences, modest goods procurement \nsuch as to support preparation and initial roll out of revised TVET curricula, as well as audit and \nadministration costs.19 The TA will not be used for civil works.  \n \nD. \n \n17. \nADB will administer the TA. The Human and Social Development Division, Southeast Asia \nDepartment  will  select,  supervise,  and  evaluate  TA-financed  consultants,  and  will  monitor \nprocurement of goods by the TA-financed consultants. The MOE will be the executing agency \nand the MOE Executive Committee will provide oversight with the relevant focal departments. \n \n18. \n \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in the table below. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\nAspects \nIndicative \nimplementation period \nExecuting agency \nImplementing agency \nConsultants \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n\nJanuary 2020\u2013December 2024 \n\nMinistry of Education \nADB Southeast Asia Department, Human and Social Development Division.  \nTo be selected and engaged by ADB.
