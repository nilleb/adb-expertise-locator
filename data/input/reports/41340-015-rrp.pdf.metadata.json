The \ninstallation  of  3.1  million  meters, \nintegrated  meter-to-cash  solutions,  and  a  capacity \ndevelopment component will help the power utility and its customers effectively adopt and utilize \nthe new technology.3 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nThe economy has sustained high growth, averaging 8% in 2010\u20132014. Growth in 2015 \nand  beyond  is  expected  to  remain  above  7%.  The  Government  of  Uzbekistan  prioritizes \nmodernizing  industry  and  developing  infrastructure  and  the  private  sector.  Reliable  and \naffordable  electricity  supply  is  vital  to  achieving  these goals.  One  of  the  key  challenges  is  the \nhigh  level  of  losses  in  the  power  sector.  The  Joint  Stock  Company  Uzbekenergo,  a  vertically \nintegrated  state-owned  utility,  reported  system  losses  of  over  18%  in  2014,  with  transmission \nlosses at 4% and distribution losses at 14%.4 Revenue collection rate was also low, at 80% or \nless. These reported losses may not be accurate because of Uzbekenergo\u2019s inability under its \ncurrent system to accurately collect information about the amount of electricity supplied and to \nmonitor the revenue collection. \n \n4. \nThe  high  level  of  electricity  losses  comes  from  the  lack  of  investment  in  modern \ndistribution assets and outdated manual operations, which results in inaccurate, unreliable, and \ninefficient revenue collection. Electricity meters are generally old and are in service beyond their \ndesigned  economic  life  without  proper  recalibration.  They  are  inaccurate  and  susceptible  to \ntampering.  Without  proper  grid  metering,  Uzbekenergo  faces  difficulty  in  accounting  for \nelectricity supplied and used. Manual billing systems leave room for potential collusion between \ncustomers  and  tariff  collection  officers.  Incentive  mechanisms  to  reduce  losses  are  not \nsufficiently institutionalized. \n \n5. \nTo  overcome  these  challenges,  Uzbekenergo  has  requested  international  financial \ninstitutions  to  finance  a  nationwide  AEM  program.5 AEM  or  \u201csmart  metering\u201d  allows  two-way \ncommunication  between  the  utility  and  customer  meters.  AEM  enables  the  utility  to  remotely \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The rollout started with the phase 1 project. ADB. 2011. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board \nof Directors: Proposed Loan to the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Advanced Electricity Metering Project. Manila. \nPhase 2 is financed by the World Bank and covers Tashkent City, Tashkent region, and Syrdarya region. Phase 3 \nis  financed  by  the  Islamic  Development  Bank  and  covers  Karakalpakstan,  Khorezm,  and  Navoi  regions.  The \nproject will be the fourth, and the last, phase of the national rollout of advanced metering.  \n\n3   The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance (TA) for the project.  \n4   Uzbekenergo is a 100% state-owned monopoly  in charge of electricity generation, transmission, and distribution, \n\nand operates under the supervision and regulation of the cabinet of ministers.  \n\n5  ADB  is  the lead  development  partner  in  this  initiative.  ADB  prepared the  feasibility  study  and  introduced  AEM  to \n\nUzbekistan, paving the way for the World Bank and the Islamic Development Bank to follow. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ndisconnect and reconnect supply without having to send utility officers to the site. This function \nremoves  the  human  factor  in  meter  reading  and  reporting,  thus  enhancing  disincentives  for \nmeter  tampering  and  customers  who  do  not  make  full  payment  on  time.  AEM  provides  more \naccurate power usage information, which helps customers manage their electricity consumption \nand improve energy efficiency, and empowers the utility in identifying losses in the distribution \nsystem. The  remote monitoring capability  also enables the  utility  to  prevent  overloading  of the \ndistribution system and, as a result, technical losses may be reduced. \n \nThe  introduction  of  AEM  is  one  of  many  efforts  being  undertaken  by  Uzbekenergo  to \n6. \nimprove  the  sector\u2019s  efficiency  and  performance,  and  it  is  a  priority  project  under  the \ngovernment\u2019s  long-term  investment  and  structural  reform  program  (2015\u20132019).6 Uzbekistan \nhas  13,500 megawatts of  installed  capacity,  of which  85%  is thermal  power.  Concurrently,  old \ninefficient power plants are being replaced by energy-efficient combined-cycle gas turbines. The \nelectricity  tariff  has  been  steadily  rising  to  support  financial  sustainability  and  cost  recovery. \nFinancial  transparency  has  improved,  with  ADB  assistance,  since  Uzbekenergo  adopted \nexternal audits based on the International Standards on Auditing from FY2011.7  \n \n7. \nUzbekenergo  aims  to  cover  6.3  million  customers  with  AEM.  It  initiated  its  first  large-\nscale  AEM  project  financed  by  ADB  for  1 million  customers.  Implementation  of  the  phase  1 \nproject  has  been  satisfactory,  although  procurement  has  taken  longer  than  expected  because \nAEM systems are complex and new to the country. To complete the nationwide rollout of AEM, \nUzbekistan has requested ADB to finance the project to cover five regions. \n \n8. \nADB is actively involved in the dialogue with the government to promote energy sector \nreform  and  development,  capacity  development,  and  good  governance.  In  2012,  the  power \nsector regional master plan was prepared under Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation, \ninvestment  priorities  and  development  plan. 8  ADB \nwhich \nis  also  assisting \nUzbekenergo\u2019s  capacity  development  efforts  to  improve  gender  equality  and  corporate \nmanagement and performance in Uzbekenergo.9 \n \n9. \nincludes a focus on energy efficiency and reliable power supply.10  \n \nB. \n\nThe  project  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  Uzbekistan,  which \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nidentifies \n\n10. \nThe impact will be improved financial viability in the power sector. The project will help \nensure  (i)  accurate  accounting  and  billing  of  energy,  (ii)  commercial  loss  reduction,  and \n(iii) improved energy efficiency. The outcome will be the improved electricity revenue collection \nin the targeted regions. The project will cover Andijan, Fergana, Kashkadarya, Namangan, and \nSurkhandarya  regions.  The  project  will  improve  metering  accuracy,  billing  efficiency,  and  tariff \ncollection rates; and provide anti-tampering and fault-detection capability to Uzbekenergo. \n\n                                                \n6  Government  of  Uzbekistan.  2015.

It  will  administer  all  consulting  and  procurement \ncontracts  and  prepare  project  plans,  bid  evaluation  reports,  progress  reports,  applications  for \nwithdrawal of funds, and other reports and documents required by ADB. \n \n18. \nUzbekenergo will employ turnkey contractors (two lots) to deliver the meters and related \nequipment,  install  the  AEM  and  billing  system,  and  provide  related  services  including  training, \ncustomization,  and  oversight  of  meter  installation.15 These  contracts  will  be  procured  through \nADB\u2019s single-stage, two-envelope bidding procedure. \n \n\n                                                \n14 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 The installation of meters will be undertaken by personnel of the regional distribution enterprises of Uzbekenergo, \n\nunder the supervision of the contractors and the project implementation consultant. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n\u2014\n\n19.  With  the  intention  to  rollout  AEM  in  the  entire  country,  Uzbekenergo  has  successfully \npiloted several AEM projects in many of its regions using its own resources. While the collective \nimpact  will  only  be  seen once  the  ongoing  AEM  projects  are  completed,  the  results  shown by \nthese pilot projects are already encouraging. The distribution losses in pilot districts (0.4 kilovolt \nsystem) were reduced from 40% to 10%. Tariff collection in the piloted districts improved from \n50% to 98%. Consumer behavior is also changing\ncustomers regularly paying bills have risen \nfrom 40% to 99.5%.16  Uzbekenergo has tested a locally developed automated billing system for \nits  entire  network  and  the  improvements  achieved  through  this  system  have  encouraged  the \ngovernment to proceed with countrywide deployment of the AEM system. \n \n20. \nUnder  the  project,  AEM  will  be  rolled  out  in  five  regions.  The  ATC&C  losses  in  these \nregions  range  from  20%  to  56%  and  are  about  11,000  gigawatt-hours  annually\u2014almost  a \nquarter  of  Uzbekenergo\u2019s  total  sales.  A  significant  part  of  these  losses  are  attributed  to \nresidential customers, who consume about one-third of the power distributed.17 \n \n21. \nThe installation of meters and concentrators will be carried out by staff provided by the \nregional  distribution  enterprises  of  Uzbekenergo  (PES)  under  the  supervision  of  the  turnkey \ncontractor  and  the  project  implementation  consultant.  The  installation  of  AEM  and  the  billing \nsystem will be done by the contractors. PES will appoint managers and technicians to work with \nthe contractor and the project implementation consultant, who will also provide training on AEM \nthe  successful \noperation  and  maintenance.  All  parties  will  be \ncommissioning  of  AEM.  This  approach  will  allow  the  local  staff  to  acquire  the  necessary  skills \nand knowledge to operate the system even after project completion. \n \nAdvanced electricity meters and communication systems. The technology selected \n22. \nfor  the  meters  will  follow  international  standards,  including  specific  local  requirements  and \nfunctionalities required to achieve the project\u2019s targets, such as remote data collection for billing, \nremote  connection  and  disconnection  of  the  meters,  prepayment  function,  energy  balancing, \nand alarms for theft detection. With regard to the communication infrastructure, after all options \nwere analyzed by the project preparatory TA consultants it was confirmed that power line carrier \nbe the primary technology and radio frequency for the remaining meters. \n \nHead-end  system  and  meter  data  management  systems.  AEM  comprises  (i)  the \n23. \nhead-end  system  and  (ii)  meter  data  management  systems  to  remotely  exchange  information \nwith the meters, process information, and provide the required alarms or inputs to manage the \nmeters. The modular design solution recommended in the feasibility study follows international \nstandards  and  allows  future  adoption  of  demand-side  management.  Interoperability  with  other \nPES  and  interface  with  the  head  office  were  carefully  considered.  The  project  also  includes \nsupporting software  to manage the  information technology  networks  and the  AEM  rollout. The \nAEM  control  centers  will  be  located  in  each  PES  for  independence  and  self-sustainability.  A \nbackup of these centers will be  installed considering the risks of flood and landslide  to ensure \noperational response in case of an unexpected major incident.  \n \n\njointly  responsible  for \n\n                                                \n16 The impact of pilot projects were reviewed and analyzed by project preparatory TA consultants. \n17 Industrial  consumers  account  for  about  40%  and  other  customers,  including  agricultural  and  public  entities, \n\nconsume 30%. \n\n \n\n\fBilling  systems.  A  separate  billing  system  shall  be  implemented  in  each  PES.  The \n24. \nsystem  shall  be  integrated  with  the  AEM  systems  so  that  the  \u201cmeter-to-cash\u201d  process  is  fully \nautomated. The billing system will also be accessible in each customer service center, as well \nas through mobile services and the internet. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n25. \nThe project is financially and economically viable. The financial internal rate of return is \n16.9%,  which  compares  favorably  with  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  at  0.7%.  The \nbenefits  include  additional  revenue  from  improved  collection  rates  and  incremental  electricity \nsales accrued from a reduction in commercial losses and unserved energy. \n \nThe  economic  benefit  is  the  net  redistribution  effect  of  electricity  consumption  due  to \n26. \nchanges in customer behavior. The project will reduce the electricity consumption that was not \npaid  for  and  that  was  valued  less  than  the  tariff  rate,  resulting  in  energy  saving.  The  saved \nenergy will be redistributed to those customers that were using alternative means for electricity \nand valued electricity higher than the tariff rate. The economic internal rate of return is  18.2%, \nwhich is greater than the economic opportunity cost of capital of 12.0%. The sensitivity analysis \nsuggests sufficient robustness of the project under all tested assumptions.  \n \nUzbekenergo  has  operated  profitably  since  2008.18 The  gross  profit  margin  remained \n27. \nabove  10.0%,  but  decreased from  35.1%  in  2008  to  16.9%  in  2013  largely  because  of  higher \nmaintenance costs resulting from aging facilities. However, low fuel costs and semiannual tariff \nadjustments to reflect inflation contributed to the profitability of Uzbekenergo. \n \n28. \nFinancial projections for 2014\u20132025 indicate that the financial base will remain stable if \ntariff  adjustments  remain  synchronized  with  inflation  and  gas  prices.  The  ongoing  capacity \ndevelopment  program  initiated  under  previous  projects  will  continue  under  this  project  to  help \nUzbekenergo sustain its profitability. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nSector  governance. The power sector is under the direct supervision of the cabinet of \n29. \nministers  and  is  managed  by  Uzbekenergo.  The  energy  policy  and  the  long-term  investment \nplan are prepared by the cabinet in coordination with ministries and government agencies. The \nlong-term  investment  plan  (2011\u20132015)  was  updated  annually  and  a  new  plan  for  the  period \n2015\u20132019  was  announced  in  March  2015.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  sets  the  tariff  for  utility \ncosts.  Uzbekistan  has  been  successful  in  adjusting  tariffs  semiannually  to  reflect  the  cost  of \nservices.  Licenses  are  issued  by  the  State  Inspection  of  Control  in  Power  Industry  under  the \ncabinet.  Institutional  capacity  development  activities  for  Uzbekenergo,  such  as  strengthening \nsafeguard  assessment,  bringing  in  modern  and  transparent  performance  assessment,  and \nupgrading the management information system, are under way with ADB support.19 \n \n30. \nFinancial  management.  Uzbekenergo\u2019s  financial  management  risk  is  considered  high \nand  requires  capacity  strengthening.  Uzbekenergo\u2019s  accounting  policies,  procedures,  and \n\n                                                \n18 This  is  based  on  Uzbekenergo\u2019s  unconsolidated  financial  statements;  consolidation  of  the  financial  account  is \n\nexpected to be completed for FY2015. \n\n19 ADB.  2010.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loans  and \nAdministration  of  Loan  to  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  for  the  Talimarjan  Power  Project.  Manila;  and  ADB.  2014. \nReport  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  to  the  Republic  of \nUzbekistan for the Takhiatash Power Plant Efficiency Improvement Project. Manila. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\ffinancial  reporting  follow  the  national  accounting  standards  of  Uzbekistan  and  national \nstandards  on  auditing.  However,  Uzbekenergo  has  not  fully  consolidated  its  account  with  its \nsubsidiaries, and current assessments are based on partially consolidated financial statements \nthat  cover  the  revenue  and  cost  of  the  core  electricity  operations.  To  enhance  its  financial \nmanagement, Uzbekenergo has adopted external audit of its financial statements since FY2011 \nbased on the International Standards on Auditing issued by the International Assurance Auditing \nStandards  Board.  The  audit  found  areas  for  improvement,  such  as  the  classification  methods \nand  impairment  provisions  on  account  receivables,  the  scope  of  account  consolidation,  and \nintegration of the accounting system. \n \n31. \nUzbekenergo started to adopt the International Financial Reporting Standards in FY2012 \nand plans to achieve full compliance to cover all subsidiaries in FY2015. Capacity development \nactivities planned under ADB- and World Bank-financed projects will train specialists to comply \nwith  the  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  and  will  strengthen  Uzbekenergo\u2019s \ninformation systems to improve its financial management capability. \n \nProcurement  capacity.  Uzbekenergo\u2019s  procurement  capacity  was  assessed  as  high \n32. \nrisk.  Uzbekenergo  has  experience  with  projects  funded  by  multilateral  and  bilateral  financiers, \nincluding ADB. Despite improvements, PMU\u2019s capacity is still weak. An international firm will be \nrecruited  as  project  management  and  supervision  consultant  to  assist  in  the  bidding  process \nand contract management. ADB will provide Uzbekenergo with specific procurement advice and \nrecommendations during project implementation. \n \n33. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  Uzbekenergo.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 14). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n34. \nPoverty.  The  increased  efficiency  and  reliability  of  power  supply  resulting  from  the \nproject  will  have a positive impact  on  economic growth and poverty reduction. The  project  will \nimprove  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  power  sector  through  reduced  ATC&C  losses.  The \nutility\u2019s  load  management  capability  will  also  improve  through  better  decision-making  resulting \nfrom  data  accessibility  through the  advanced metering technology.  Power  system  stability  and \npower outage reduction are essential for increased economic activity and job opportunities. To \nstrengthen customer  service,  the  project  will  (i) make  payment transactions  more user-friendly \nand  improve  the  response  time  to  payment  and  disconnection,  (ii)  establish  a  functional \ncomplaint redress mechanism, and (iii) develop a participatory public information program. \n \n35. \nGender  equality. The project supports effective gender mainstreaming. Reliable power \nsupply  to  households  and  effective  energy  use  positively  affects  women  who  are  often  the \nmanagers  of  household activities.  The  project  will  empower  consumers, especially  women,  as \nagents of change through public information program about energy efficiency, consumer rights, \nthe newly introduced billing system, and job opportunities. The project will improve career and \ntraining opportunities for women by providing better customer service and data collection and a \ngender-sensitive user  education  program.  The gender  action  plan  includes a targeted  strategy \nand  approaches  to  enhance  project  benefits  for  women  and  thus  improves  gender  equality  in \nthe energy sector. \n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n36. \nNo  major  social  or  environmental  safeguard  issues  are  envisaged.  The  project  is \ncategory  C  for  all  safeguards  as  defined  in  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The \nimpacts  on  the  environment  are  negligible  and  will  not  extend  beyond  the  immediate  meter \nreplacement  area.  All  the  waste  equipment  and  old  meters  will  either  be  recycled  within \nUzbekenergo, will be dismantled and reused for parts, or will be disposed to designated areas \nwithin  Uzbekenergo\u2019s  facilities.  ADB  will  monitor  safeguard  issues  during  implementation.  If \nADB  becomes  aware  of  any  unanticipated  environmental  or  social  impacts  during  project \nimplementation, ADB will advise and require Uzbekenergo to (i) assess the significance of such \nunanticipated  impacts,  (ii)  evaluate  the  options  available  to  address  them,  (iii)  prepare  the \nrelevant safeguard documents; and (iv) take necessary action. The project will be implemented \nand operated in compliance with the government\u2019s rules and regulations governing the project\u2019s \nenvironmental and social aspects. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n37.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 20  The  overall  risk  is  medium  and  the \nintegrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nRisks \nDelayed \nprocurement and \nimplementation of \nturnkey contract \n\nLimited financial \nmanagement \ncapacity and \ncapacity to prevent \ncorrupt practices \n\nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nAdvance contracting is adopted to recruit the project implementation consultant to \nassist procurement. \n \nAn international consulting firm will be recruited to assist Uzbekenergo in project \nimplementation and strengthen procurement transparency. \n \nUzbekenergo will recruit experienced procurement specialists for the PMU before \nthe bidding process. \n \nUzbekenergo will assign staff with experience in other AEM projects. Lessons from \nphase 1 project will be analyzed and will be shared with the PMU and project \nimplementation consultant.  \n \nADB\u2019s staff consultant and procurement specialist will provide procurement and \ncontract management training and advice throughout project implementation. \n \nThe institutions responsible for contract registration assessment will be involved in \nprocurement and consultant recruitment to avoid delays in the contract registration \nrequired for contract effectiveness.  \n \nADB will monitor implementation progress and identify the cause of delay and \nactions required through regular portfolio review meetings. \n \nNo imprest account will be established. An international consulting firm will support \nthe PMU. Experiences and lessons from ongoing projects will be shared with the \nPMU. Training on ADB procedures will be provided. Uzbekenergo will recruit staff \nand undertake training on International Financial Reporting Standards with the help \nof the international consulting firm. \nUzbekenergo will hire capacity development consultants financed under other \n\n                                                \n20 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \n\nLack of system \ncompatibility and \ninteroperability \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nprojects by ADB and other development partners to assist Uzbekenergo in \nachieving full consolidation of its accounts, International Financial Reporting \nStandards implementation, and upgrade of accounting and reporting systems. \nUzbekenergo has established and staffed its internal audit and the project will be \nsubject to review by the internal audit. \nUzbekenergo will engage a reputable independent audit firm to undertake external \naudit based on the International Standards on Auditing. \n\nThe bidding documents for the turnkey contracts will specify the details of the \nsystem requirements. \nThe turnkey contracts will have a pilot phase under which the contractor will test \nsystem compatibility and interoperability before the contract is fully implemented. \nMeters and the meter data management system are procured under the same \nturnkey contract and the contractor will assume responsibility for system \ncompatibility and interoperability. \n\nUzbekenergo will implement a public information program, which includes a \ncustomer complaint redress mechanism. \n\nLimited social \nacceptance \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PMU = project management unit. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n38. \nThe government and Uzbekenergo have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin  the  project  administration  manual  and  loan  documents.  The  government  and  Uzbekenergo \nhave  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the  project,  which  are  set  forth  in  the  loan \nagreement and project agreement. \n \n39. \nAs  a  condition  for  loan  effectiveness,  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement  for  the  relending  of \nthe  ADB  loan  to  Uzbekenergo,  in  form  and  substance  satisfactory  to  ADB,  shall  have  been \nsigned and become effective in accordance with its terms. In addition, no disbursement will be \nmade  for  the  turnkey  contracts  until  a  loan  agreement  between  the  UFRD  and  an  eligible \ncommercial  bank,  and  a  related  subsidiary  loan  agreement  between  such  bank  and \nUzbekenergo,  both  for  the  purposes  of  the  project  and  in  form  and  substance  satisfactory  to \nADB, have been signed and become effective in accordance with their terms. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n40. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$300,000,000  to  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  for  the  Advanced  Electricity  Metering  Phase  4 \nProject,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 25 years, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n25 August 2015 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nPower sector financial viability improved (National Investment Program: 2015\u20132019)a \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \nElectricity revenue \ncollection in the \ntargeted regions \nimproved. \n\nPerformance Indicators with\nTargets and Baselines \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n \n\na-c.
