I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nequity investment of up to $50,000,000 (in Indian rupee equivalent) in Welspun Renewables \nEnergy Limited (WREL) for the Solar and Wind Power Development Project in India. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  India remains in chronic need of additional power generation capacity. Although the \nelectrification rate of households in India has increased from 43% in 20001 to 75% in 2010,2 the \nquality  and  reliability  of  service  remain  suboptimal  and  rural  areas  in  particular  remain \nunderserved.  The  Eleventh  Five-Year  Plan,  2007\u20132012  targeted  additional  capacity  of  79 \ngigawatts (GW); however, actual realization was only 55 GW. The Twelfth Five-Year Plan, \n2012\u20132017 targets an addition of 88 GW, including 30 GW of renewable energy capacity. \nAlthough the 12th plan sets ambitious targets to connect all villages to the electricity network, \nreliability will likely remain an issue. Because of continued demand growth, power supply is \nexpected to continue to fall 10%\u201312% short of demand every year during the 12th plan.3  \n \n3.  India also needs to preserve its energy mix, not only to combat climate change but also \nto ensure the country\u2019s energy security. Indigenous conventional fuels are diminishing and India \nhas to import increasing quantities of coal and liquefied natural gas. Increasing scarcity of water \nis putting pressure on coal-based power plants. Investing in renewable power mitigates import \ndependency and the impact of potential imported fuel price increases. The share of renewable \npower, including hydro power, in total installed capacity has declined from 44% in 1970 to 31% \nin 2011. The government intends to stop this decline and has set a goal of maintaining the \nproportion of renewable power at its current level (31%) until 2023.4 \n \n4.  The Indian energy sector has recently seen some favorable developments that are \ntargeted to increase further investments in the sector, and particularly in renewable power \ngeneration. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission was launched in 2010, setting the \ntarget for 20 GW of grid-connected solar power capacity by 2020. In addition to capacity that will \nbe developed under this mission with central government offtake (4 GW by 2017), the different \nstates have announced targets for capacity that will benefit from state utilities\u2019 offtake (6 GW by \n2017).5 Under these programs, solar developers benefit from attractive tariffs, although most \ntariffs are determined as a result of bids and solar tariffs are expected to decrease and reach \n\u201cgrid parity\u201d over the medium term.6 In the wind subsector, the seven states with the highest \nwind potential increased their wind feed-in tariffs in 2012\u20132013 and the central government \nannounced the reinstatement of the generation-based incentive for wind projects in 2013.7 In \nSeptember 2012, the central government approved a large financial restructuring plan for state \n                                                 \n1  International Energy Agency (IEA). 2002.

See Sector Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "2  \nelectricity boards. Several state electricity boards are in bad financial health and the plan aims \nto strengthen their balance sheet to encourage investments across the energy sector. \n \n2.  Project Design \n5.  The  project  enables  the  funding  of  WREL\u2019s  equity  injection  in  a  portfolio  of  solar \nphotovoltaic and wind power projects with a total capacity of approximately 300 megawatts \n(MW) to be commissioned from December 2013 to March 2016. Although the exact composition \nof the portfolio might change as a result of public bid awards and other business considerations, \nWREL expects its portfolio to grow by at least 200 MW of solar power projects and 100 MW of \nwind power projects from December 2013 to March 2016.  \n \n3.  The Company and Sponsors \n6.  WREL is one of the leading renewable power developers in India. As of November 2013, \nWREL had 309 MW of operational projects (289 MW of solar projects in Andhra Pradesh, \nGujarat,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Maharashtra,  and  Rajasthan;  and  20  MW  of  wind  projects  in \nRajasthan), 211 MW of projects under construction (119 MW solar and 92 MW wind), and a \npipeline of 1.2 GW of projects at various stages of development. The project will help the \ncompany reach at least 600 MW of operational projects by March 2016.  \n \n7.  WREL is 100% owned by Welspun Energy Limited (WEL), which is in turn owned by \nWelspun Corp Limited and indirectly by two individual sponsors: B. K. Goenka  and Vineet \nMittal. The Welspun Group is a large Indian conglomerate engaged in textiles, steel pipes, oil \nand gas, and infrastructure with an annual turnover of approximately $2.6 billion. Welspun \nTextile is the third-largest home textile producer in the world, while Welspun Corp is the second-\nlargest large-diameter pipe company in the world. WEL is the power arm of the Welspun Group \nand is engaged in engineering, procurement, and construction for power projects (mainly for \nWREL\u2019s projects) and ownership of power generation projects, both renewable (through WREL) \nand thermal. B. K. Goenka is the chairman of the Welspun Group. V. Mittal started and ran one \nof the biggest outsourcing companies in India, and is a member of the advisory panel of the \nSolar Energy Advisory Council of the Government of India. 8 \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n1.  Impact \n8.  The project will contribute to the continued development of renewable energy generation \nin India. In doing so, it will help preserve India\u2019s energy mix by increasing the country\u2019s reliance \non indigenous energy sources as opposed to imported fuels. The project will contribute to the \nnational goal of at least maintaining the proportion of renewable power (including hydro power) \nin total installed capacity at its current level (31%) until 2023. \n \n9.  ADB\u2019s assistance will also support private sector development. It will help demonstrate \nthat profitable investments are achievable in the renewable power subsector and, as such, will \ncatalyze more private investments in renewable energy. Supported by favorable government \npolicies for renewable power, the private sector share in the total installed capacity of renewable \nenergy in India is expected to increase from 33% in 2011 to 50% in 2023. \n                                                 \n8  V. Mittal received several distinctions, including Solar Man of the Year from EQ International magazine in 2012. ", "    3\n2.  Outcome \n10.  The  project's  outcome  is  the  demonstrated  viability  and  sustainability  of  renewable \nenergy projects in the private sector. The project is expected to generate 540 gigawatt-hours of \nelectricity annually and avoid 400,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually from FY2017 \nonwards. The project will further contribute to local employment and tax revenues.  \n \n3.  Outputs \n11.   The project output is the development and commissioning of a portfolio of 200 MW of \nsolar photovoltaic power projects and 100 MW of wind power projects by March 2016. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n12.   The project is consistent with ADB's Strategy 2020.9 It relates to two of the strategy\u2019s five \ncore pillars: infrastructure and environment. The strategy calls for ADB support to clean energy \ndevelopment to meet growing energy demands in a sustainable manner. The project will also \ncontribute to ADB\u2019s operational goal of scaling up private sector development. The project is \naligned with the India country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132017, which calls for \u201cinvestments in \nrenewable energy development, particularly solar.\u201d10 \n \n2.  Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n13.   The project is fully aligned with ADB's Energy Policy.11 The policy states that support for \nrenewable energy projects will be prioritized and broadened. Starting in 2013, ADB will increase \nits target of clean energy investments to $2 billion a year from the previous target of $1 billion a \nyear. As part of the policy implementation, ADB is emphasizing private sector participation as a \ntool to increase energy sector efficiency by introducing increased competition and increased \ninvestable resources. The proposed investment also contributes to ADB\u2019s Asia Solar Energy \nInitiative and complements previous interventions in the solar industry in India. \n \n3.  Lessons from Previous Operations \n14.  No independent evaluation has been undertaken yet on prior nonsovereign investments \nby ADB in the solar industry. Lessons based on staff experience point to (i) the importance of \nfeed-in tariffs for renewable energy; (ii) the importance of the quality of panel suppliers, as well \nas their level of warranties and creditworthiness; and (iii) the need for verification of generation \nlosses due to dust and other soiling factors, especially in desert areas of India. To date, India \nand Thailand are the only two countries in Asia that have appropriate feed-in tariffs in place in \ncombination  with  credible  supporting  government  policies.  The  project  is  mitigating  risks \nassociated with panel supply by the fact that the quality of the solar panels, the adequacy of the \nwarranties, as well as the reputation of the supplier selected by WREL have been confirmed by \nADB\u2019s independent engineer. The independent engineer confirmed that WREL has adequate \noperations and maintenance capacity in place to minimize generation loss, and that soiling \nlosses have been taken into account when calculating net generation.  \n                                                 \n9 ADB. 2008.

The extended annual reviews of private sector wind projects previously financed by ADB \nin India highlighted three key lessons: (i) the importance of wind resource assessment, (ii) the \nrisks associated with land acquisition if forest land is included in the scope of the project, and \n(iii) the need for more power evacuation facilities. WREL\u2019s project selection aims to mitigate \nthese risks by (i) relying on multiple wind data sources, such as external databases as well as \ndata from wind masts placed by WREL at various project sites; (ii) a land acquisition approach \nthat avoids forest land; and (iii) working closely with local offtakers to ensure advance grid \nplanning is completed where required.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  Table 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements. \n \nTable 3: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory  The energy sector in India is regulated and administered through a multi-ministerial structure. The \nframework  CERC is the central regulator. Individual states have a state ministry of power as well as SERCs. \nRenewable energy policies are embedded in the framework of the Electricity Act, 2003; the \nNational  Electricity  Policy,  2005;  and  the  National  Tariff  Policy,  2006  (and  as  amended  in \nDecember 2010). The regulatory environment in India for the renewable subsector is under \ncontinuous development and aims to encourage further significant private sector investments.  \nManagement  The management team of WREL is headed by one of the sponsors, Vineet Mittal. He is supported \nby a team of professionals with ample experience in the renewable energy sector.  \nImplementation  December 2013\u2013March 2016 \nperiod \nConstruction arrangements \nType of  EPC contracts will be awarded in a transparent manner based on an assessment of the proposed \narrangement   cost, quality, time lines, and terms and conditions. \nEquipment  EPC contractors will source thin film and crystalline solar modules, inverters, wind turbines, \nSuppliers  transformers, and other necessary equipment from leading international suppliers. \nCivil works  Civil works for the balance of the plant (including construction of common facilities, control rooms, \nand access roads) will be subcontracted to local trade contractors. \nTransmission  Power evacuation facilities will be made by the respective state transmission companies, while \nlines  short connection lines are included as part of the EPC contract.  \nOperation arrangements \nRevenue  For all projects offtake will be fixed under long-term PPA (majority 25 years) with varying tariffs with \nstructure  the respective state offtakers. \nOperation  Operation and maintenance of the solar plants will be done in-house at the project level. Training \nand  and support is offered by WREL. Operation and maintenance of the wind projects will be done by \nmaintenance  the wind turbine supplier, generally for a 20-year period.  \nPerformance  Key performance indicators will be reported by WREL and monitored by ADB. \nmonitoring \nEPC  =  engineering,  procurement,  and  construction;  PPA  =  power  purchase  agreement;  WREL  =  Welspun \nRenewables Energy Limited.   \nSource: Welspun Renewables Energy Limited. \n \nE.  Unique Features \n17.  The project will be ADB\u2019s largest direct equity investment in renewable energy ($50 \nmillion) and it will be ADB\u2019s largest nonsovereign solar power project in size (200 MW). It is \nnoteworthy that ADB will become the first external investor in WREL. In most other direct equity \ninvestments so far, ADB has followed first-round private equity investors. In this transaction, \nADB is taking a leading structuring role. The valuation, corporate governance standards, and \nminority shareholder protection rights negotiated by ADB as part of its investment will help \nWREL attract further equity investment to support its growth.  \n ", "    5\nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n18.  ADB will subscribe to common equity shares of WREL for an amount up to the lower of \n(i) the Indian rupee equivalent of $50 million, and (ii) such amount that represents 25% of the \nnet worth of WREL after the ADB investment. \n \n19.  The equity investment has been structured to address the capital needs of WREL. It \nprovides growth capital to WREL without imposing the burden of interest payments, while the \nasset base is being expanded. It will enable ADB to share the investment upside created by an \ninitial public offering (IPO) or a strategic sale. \n  \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n20.  ADB's assistance will support the government's policy to develop renewable energy. It \nwill strengthen a local renewable energy sponsor with a good operational track record and a \ncommitment  to  comply  with  ADB's  environmental  and  social  safeguard  requirements.  In \naddition, ADB\u2019s investment is expected to be catalytic as it will enable the company to raise \nequity funds from other investors. As such, WREL sees ADB\u2019s potential assistance as a key \nsuccess factor for subsequent fund raising and its future IPO. \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n21.  The  proposed  equity  investment  is  considered  as  general  corporate  finance  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009);  it  is  classified  category  B  for \nenvironment and category C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. Although \nsolar and wind power projects involve potential environmental impacts during construction and \noperation (e.g. potential water and land pollution), these impacts are site-specific, reversible and \ncan be mitigated using tested mitigation measures.12 As required under the Safeguard Policy \nStatement, a corporate safeguards audit was conducted during due diligence. A corrective \naction  plan  which  describes  gap-filling  measures  at  the  corporate  and  project  level  was \nprepared based on the audit findings. WREL will be required to adopt an environmental and \nsocial management system (ESMS) satisfactory to ADB prior to ADB\u2019s investment. To ensure \nadequate implementation of its ESMS, WREL has agreed to develop its capacity to oversee the \nESMS implementation at the corporate level and at the project level.  \n \n22.  The  project  team\u2019s  due  diligence  and  external  expert\u2019s  corporate  audit  found  that \nWREL\u2019s existing environmental and social policies and systems are not fully aligned with the \nrequirements of ADB safeguards and social requirements. While there are existing procedures \nto screen, assess, and address environmental and social risks arising out of its portfolio of solar \nand  wind  power  projects,  there  are  still  improvements  required  to ensure  compliance  and \n                                                 \n12  On the social aspects, due diligence found that selected WREL solar and wind power projects were located either \non state-owned lands that are vacant and have low productivity or on private land procured through negotiated \nsettlements. None of these projects required use, purchase, or acquisition of tribal lands, or require any physical or \neconomic displacement. Future solar and wind power projects are planned in similar locations. ", "6  \neffective implementation. However, WREL is committed to adopting best practices and norms to \nachieve its commitment to environmental and social sustainability through the ESMS.13 \n \n23.  The project is classified as having some gender elements. WREL has committed to \nincrease the proportion of women staff from 10% in FY2013 to 15% by FY2018. Consistent with \nWREL\u2019s policy objective of empowering women, the ESMS will include arrangements to ensure \nmeaningful  consultation  with  women  during  the  conduct  of  environmental  and  social \nassessments. Further, the company engages in community programs and will ensure that these \nactivities include services and support that meet local women's needs. WREL will comply with \nADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy and report regularly to ADB on measures taken to ensure \ncompliance  (including  that  of  contractors)  with  national  labor  laws  and  adherence  to \ninternationally recognized core labor standards.14 Information disclosure and consultations with \naffected people for all WREL projects will be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements.15 \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy  \n24.  WREL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy on implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations  \n25.  The proposed equity investment is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and \nsingle-project exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n26.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment of India will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed \nassistance to WREL. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance \nsatisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the Board of Directors. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n27.  I am satisfied that the proposed equity investment would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nequity investment of up to $50,000,000 in Welspun Renewables Energy Limited for the Solar \nand Wind Power Development Project in India from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with such \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and \nas may be reported to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n21 November 2013 \n \n                                                 \n13 Safeguards and Social Dimensions Summary, and Findings of the Corporate Safeguards Audit: Environmental and \nSocial System Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 ADB. 2003.
