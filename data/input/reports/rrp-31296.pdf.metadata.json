The PSRB outlined the reform process proposed to be followed by\nthe  Government  to  gradually  remove  the  constraints  in  the  sector  through  improvements  in\nsector  and  corporate  governance,  introduction  of  competition,  and  public-private  partnerships.\nReform of the external environment was to be done through targeted interventions in the power\nsector.\n\n4.\nIn  accordance  with  the  PSRB,  the  power  sector  in  Bangladesh  has  gradually  been\nundergoing structural changes. The DPs have been supporting these changes through technical\nassistance for planning and institutional strengthening as well as capital for system expansion,\nin  line  with  the  principle  of  reforms-linked  assistance.  Prior  to  the  West  Zone  Power  System\nDevelopment Project (the Project), assistance by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) had focus\non  the  greater  Dhaka  area,  given  its  commercial  and  political  importance  to  Bangladesh.\nHowever,  while  the  greater  Dhaka  area  has  considerably  improved  both  physically  and\nfinancially  (although  by  no  means  near  financial  viability  and  sustainability  as  yet),  the  other\nregions  of  the  country,  which  have  not  been  able  to  attract  aid  or  private  sector  capital,  have\nbeen  falling  behind  in  physical  infrastructure  as  well  as  progress  of  reforms.  The  Project\nproposes to correct this imbalance by providing assistance to the western region of Bangladesh.\n\n5.\nThe Project, which will be the fourth assistance provided by ADB in support of the reform\nprocess, is part of ADB's 2001 Country Assistance Program for Bangladesh. The Project is an\nintegral  part  of  the  least-cost  development  plan  for  the  power  sector,  and  is  accorded  high\npriority  by  the  Government.  Loan  fact-finding  was  carried  out  during  7\u201317  May  2001  and\nappraisal during 26 September - 2 October 2001.2\n\n                  \n\n1  The Asian Development Bank, the World Bank, the Department for International Development of the UK, the Japan\nBank for International Cooperation, Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau for the Government of Germany, and the United\nStates Agency for International Development.\n\n2  The Appraisal Mission comprised S. Chander, Senior Project Engineer/Mission Leader; S. Ahmed, Senior Project\nOfficer;  M.Z.  Hossain,  Senior  Economist;  M.  Elerud,  Financial  Analyst;  and  Dewi  Utami,  Environment  Specialist.\nD. Gracyzk, Senior Energy Specialist, prepared the economics sections of the Report. ADB\u2019s Bangladesh Resident\nMission provided extensive assistance in the processing of the Project.\n\n\f2\n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA. \n\nSector Description\n\nThe  power  sector  in  Bangladesh  is  organized  under  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mineral\n6.\nResources. The Government, through the ministry, wholly owns and supervises the Bangladesh\nPower Development Board (BPDB), the Dhaka Electricity Supply Authority (DESA), and the Rural\nElectrification  Board  (REB),  which  are  its  three  executing  agencies  in  the  sector.  Till  fiscal  year\nFY1998,  BPDB  was  responsible  for  all  generation  and  most  of  the  transmission  in  the  country,\nand also for distribution in district towns, municipalities, and some rural areas, while DESA was\nresponsible for distribution in the greater Dhaka area, including the capital city. The distribution of\nelectricity  in  most  of  the  rural  areas  of  Bangladesh  is  the  responsibility  of  the  67  rural  electric\ncooperatives or Palli Bidyut Samities (PBSs), which are organized, initially funded, and monitored\nby REB. As part of the sector reform process, new public sector entities such as the Power Grid\nCompany of Bangladesh Ltd. (PGCB) and the Dhaka Electric Supply Company Ltd. (DESCO)\nas  well  as  private  sector  independent  power  producers  (IPPs)  such  as  the  Rural  Power\nCompany Ltd. (RPC),3 the Meghnaghat AES Power Company Ltd.,4 and the Haripur AES Power\nCompany Ltd. have been constituted. Over the next few years, these companies will own and\noperate a substantial part of the power sector\u2019s assets. The distribution subsector has also seen\na major rationalization of distribution territory between DESA and the PBSs. The Government,\nBPDB, and REB have taken steps to involve the private sector by (i) adopting a private power\ngeneration  policy  in  October  1996,  (ii)  adopting  a  small  power  generation  policy  in  1998  to\nencourage distributed generation, and (iii) awarding contracts for about 1,800 megawatts (MW)\nof generating capacity on a build-own-operate (BOO) basis.\n\n7.\nBangladesh\u2019s  annual  per  capita  electricity  consumption  of  87  kilowatt-hours  (kWh)  in\nFY2001  was  the  third  lowest  among  ADB's  developing  member  countries,  after  Cambodia  and\nNepal.5  Despite  intensive  efforts  to  increase  coverage,  only  about  20  percent  of  the  population\nhas access to electricity.6 Consumption of electricity in Bangladesh has increased at an average\nannual  rate  of  8.5  percent  from  FY1994  to  FY2001,  with  major increases  in  industrial  and\nresidential use. The ADB-financed Power System Master Plan Study7 estimated that the demand\nfor electricity will increase by about 8 percent per year for the next 10 years. The current installed\ncapacity is 4,035 MW. The peak demand met was 3,096 MW on 3 July 2001.\n\n8.\nInadequate supply of electricity is a major constraint to economic growth. During FY1999,\nload shedding in the range 16-774 MW was resorted to on 335 days for a total duration of 1,690\nhours.  The  situation  improved  in  FY2000  and  FY2001  with  load  shedding  restricted  to  15-663\nMW on 251 days for a total duration of 948 hours. The situation will improve further in FY2002\nwith  (i)  elimination  of  gas  supply  constraints  to  power  stations,  (ii)  full  commissioning  of  the\n\n                  \n\n3  The Rural Power Company Ltd. has 68 percent of its shares held by the private sector rural electric cooperative\nand  32  percent  by  the  public  sector  REB.  It  was  established  in  1994  as  part  of  the  policy  dialogue  for  ADB\nLoan 1356-BAN(SF): Rural Electrification Project for SDR34.4 million, approved on 30 May 1995.\n\n4  Supported by ADB through TA 2338-BAN: Solicitation for Private Sector Implementation of the Meghnaghat Power\nProject, for $211,000, approved on 30 May 1995 and enhanced to $595,000 in March 1998; and Investment Loan\n7165/1793-BAN:  AES  Meghnaghat  Power  Project,  for  $50  million  loan;  31909-BAN  $70  million  partial  risk\nguarantee and complementary financing scheme no. 39, for $20 million, all approved on 5 December 2000.\n\n5  In 2001, the annual per capita consumption was 55 kWh in Nepal and 30 kWh in Cambodia. Comparable figures\n\nfor some other developing member countries (DMCs) were 340 kWh for India, and 950 kWh for Thailand.\n\n6  Comparable figures for some other DMCs are less than 10 percent for Cambodia, 18 percent for Nepal, 82 percent\n\nfor India, 48 percent for Pakistan, and 98 percent for Thailand.\n\n7  TA  1962-BAN:  Preparation of a Power System Master Plan,  for  $600,000,  approved  on  11  October  1993.\n\nCompleted in early 1995.\n\n\f3\n\nHaripur  IPP  station,  (iii)  part  commissioning  of  the  Meghnaghat-I  IPP  station,  and  (iv)\nreinforcement  of  the  Dhaka  230  kV  ring  and  completion  of  the  Rampura  230  kV  substation.\nSome load shedding is expected to continue until substantial new generation capacity is added\nto the system to (i) replace very old power stations, (ii) allow for routine preventive maintenance\nthrough creation of reserve margin, and (iii) meet the additional demand from new connections\nand  suppressed  load  growth.  Erratic  power  supply  has  tended  to  increase  the  unwillingness  of\nconsumers to pay their bills, which in turn has led to shortages of funds for maintenance and has\nfurther aggravated the situation.\n\nAfter DESCO became operational in 1998, and distribution territory between DESA and\n\n9.\nthe PBSs was rationalized, the sector\u2019s financial situation improved (Table 1).\n\nTable 1: Performance of the Power Sector, FY1998 and FY2000\n\nDistribution\n\nShare\n\nFY1998\n\nFY2000\n\nDistribution Losses\n(% of imports)\n\nRevenue\nCollections\n(% of billings)\n\nGWH\n\n3,485\n3239\n1,435\n    224a\n\n%\n\n42\n39\n17\n  3\n\nBPDB\nDESA\nPBSs\nDESCO\n\nGWH\n\n5,888\n4,745\n4,114\n   628\n\n%\n\n38\n31\n27\n4\n\nFY1998\n\nFY2000\n\nFY1998\n\nFY2000\n\n29.1\n30.1\n16.5\n46.7a\n\n24.9\n36.6\n17.7\n29.9\n\n81\n80\n96\n88a\n\n86\n88\n94\n80\n\nTotal\n\n8,383\n\n100\na As the Mirpur Division of DESA prior to its restructuring.\nBPDB = Bangladesh Power Development, DESA = Dhaka Electric Supply Authority, DESCO = Dhaka Electric\nSupply Company, Ltd., GWh = Gigawatt-hours, PBSs = rural electric cooperatives.\n\n15,375\n\n100\n\n10.\nBangladesh  has  limited  hydropower  potential  because  the  terrain  is  flat.  The  Jamuna-\nPadma-Meghna  river  system,  which  runs  north  to  south,  divides  the  country  into  two.  The\ncountry's entire proven recoverable reserves of oil (including condensate) estimated at 59 million\nbarrels,  and  natural  gas  estimated  at  12  trillion  cubic  feet  are  on  the  eastern  side  of  the  river\nsystem. The limited hydropower potential is also in the eastern part of the country. The western\npart  has  no  developed  commercial  sources  of  energy.  Coal  reserves,  which  are  in  the\nnorthwestern part, are deep beneath the surface and difficult to develop, and only one potential\nmine with a limited output of about one million tons per annum is being developed with external\nassistance. Consequently, of the country's total installed generation capacity of 4,035 MW, about\n494 MW  fueled  by  diesel  oil  and  heavy  fuel  oil  and  171  MW  fueled  by  natural  gas,  are  in  the\nwestern  part.  Of  the  3,370  MW  in  the  eastern  part,  3,135  MW  is  based  on  natural  gas,  the\ncountry's  primary  commercial  fuel,  and  235  MW  on  hydropower.  In  terms  of  energy  generated,\nabout 90 percent of the total in FY2000 was from gas-fired power plants.\n\n11.\nIn  FY2001,  BPDB's  average  retail  tariff  for  its  ultimate  consumers  was  Tk3.13/kWh\n($0.055/kWh), DESA's was Tk2.83/kWh ($0.050/kWh), DESCO\u2019s was Tk2.95/kWh ($0.052/kWh)\nand  PBS's  Tk3.19/kWh  ($0.054/kWh),  leading  to  a  weighted  average  tariff  of  Tk3.06/kWh,\n($0.054/kWh),  compared  with  the  estimated  long-run  marginal  cost  (LRMC)  of  supply  of\nTk3.86/kWh  ($0.068/kWh).  The  LRMC  is,  however,  declining  due  to  (i)  the  lower  costs  of\nproduction  from  the  larger  private  sector  IPPs,  and  (ii)  declining  losses.  Retail  tariffs  are  being\nadjusted  every  six  months  to  reflect  increased  costs  of  inputs  by  way  of  (i)  the  increased  debt-\nservice  burden  on  the  utilities  in  local  currency,  caused  by  the  devaluation  of  the  taka;  and\n(ii) increase in the price of natural gas.\n\n\fB. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n4\n\n12.\nThe  PSRB  envisions  in  the  long-term  a  structure  of  the  power  sector  based  on\n(i) separation of sector regulation and operation; (ii) autonomy and commercial orientation of the\nsector  entities;  (iii)  separation  of  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution;  and  (iv) increased\nprivate  sector  participation.  Under  such  a  structure,  a  new  regulatory  authority  would  be\nresponsible  for  (i)  setting  electricity  tariffs  and  determining  the  corresponding  performance\nnorms; (ii) collecting, verifying and disseminating sector statistics; (iii) reviewing and approving\nlong-term  power  planning;  (iv)  creating  and  maintaining  a  nondiscriminatory  and  commercial\nbusiness environment in the sector; and (v) adjudicating disputes between sector entities. While\ntransmission  will  remain  in  the  public  sector,  generation  and  distribution  assets  will  have  both\npublic and private ownership. The objective is to eliminate monopolies and foster competition.\nCommercial  discipline  and  good  customer  service  are  expected  to  be  achieved  through\ncompetition among entities in the power sector.\n\n13. With the initiation of reforms in 1994, the organizational setup of the sector has changed.\nWhereas  in  1994,  all  generation  was  with  BPDB,  today  there  are  several  public/  private  and\nprivate  sector  entities  that  have  been  licensed  to  construct  and  operate  power-generating\nfacilities.  The  first  private  barge-mounted  power  station  started  operations  in  December  1998.\nThe RPC\u2019s (footnote 3) first gas turbine at its Mymensingh site started operation in April 2000.\nThree  barge-mounted  power  stations  totaling  about  310  MW  are  under  operation,  as  is  the\nopen-cycle  stage  of  the  Haripur  (360  MW)  IPP  station.  IPPs  under  construction  include\nMeghnaghat-1 (450 MW) (footnote 4) and the 100 MW expansion at Baghabari.\n\nGood governance, at both the sector and the corporate levels is emphasized in the PSRB.\n14.\nAt  the  sector  level,  governance  is  to  be  improved  through  predictability  (long-term  planning,\ncodification  of  rules  and  regulations,  and  independence  of  regulatory  processes),  transparency\n(systematic  dissemination  of  relevant  sector  information,  public  hearings,  and  discussions  on\nissues  before  they  are  decided),  and  accountability  (cause-effect  structure  of  incentives).  At  the\ncorporate  level,  governance  is  being  enhanced  through  corporatization,  independence  of  the\nboards  of  directors  from  the  Government,  defined  delegation  of  powers  to  staff,  computerized\nmanagement information systems, and commercialization of activities.\n\n15.\nThe  Government  realizes  that  the  investment  requirements  for  the  power  sector  during\n1995\u20132005,  estimated  at  about  $6.6  billion,  exceed  the  resources  available  in  the  public  sector\nand  could  crowd  out  investment  in  other  key  sectors.  Therefore,  the  Government  has  made  a\npolicy decision to invite the private sector to participate in developing the sector. The Government\nhas  made  substantial  efforts  to  streamline  administrative  and  commercial  procedures  and  the\nprivate sector has responded positively in its participation in the power sector. To streamline the\nlegislative basis for the sector\u2019s restructuring and regulation, and to allow the establishment of an\nindependent regulatory authority, the Government has drafted a new electricity reform act and has\nintroduced it for consideration of the Parliament. ADB has granted Technical Assistance (TA)8 to\nhelp  draft  the  regulations  for  the  power  sector  that  will  be  administered  by  the  new  regulatory\nauthority.  This  will  permit  depoliticization  of  tariff  setting  and  licensing,  making  the  sector\u2019s\noperations more transparent.\n\n8  TA 3129-BAN: Support for an Energy Regulatory Authority, for $900,000, approved on 16 December 1998.\n\n                  \n\n\f5\n\nThe  Government's  other  priority  in  the  power  sector  is  to  improve  the  operations  and\n16.\nfinancial  positions  of  BPDB  and  DESA  until  their  successor  organizations  develop,  and  thereby\nreduce its losses in the sector. Over the past five years, as part of its drive to improve the financial\nposition of the sector, the Government has been monitoring and encouraging these two utilities to\nimprove their technical operations, as well as their billing and collection procedures. Although the\ncommercial operations of both utilities have improved, they have not reached a level of financial\nviability and sustainability. The improvement process has been slow because of discontinuities in\nsenior management, the politicization of labor unions, and the day-to-day political interference in\noperations.  Extensive  discussions  between  the  Government  and  the  DPs  have  focused  on  the\nneed  to  (i)  improve  the  operations  of  BPDB  and  DESA;  (ii)  increase  the  participation  of  more\nefficient  agencies,  such  as  REB;  and  (iii)  create  new  sector  agencies  that  will  be  commercially\noriented. Many of these steps have been implemented.\n\nC. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\nInternational  Development  of  UK  (DFID),  United  States  Agency \n\n17.\nInvestment in the power sector during the last decade totaled $3.5 billion (Appendix 1).\nThe  major  sources  of  funding  have  been  ADB,  the  World  Bank,  France,  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr\nWiederaufbau of Germany (KfW), Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), Department\nfor \nInternational\nDevelopment  (USAID),  Organization  of  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries  (OPEC),  People\u2019s\nRepublic  of  China,  and  Russia.  Other  sources  include  the  Islamic  Development  Bank,  the\nKuwait  Fund  for  Arab  Economic  Development,  Saudi  Fund  for  Development,  Canadian\nInternational  Development  Agency,  United  Nations\u2019  Development  Programme,  Swedish\nInternational Development Agency, Belgium, Danish International Development Agency, Finnish\nInternational Development Agency, and the private sector.\n\nfor \n\n18.\nWhile  ADB  has  assisted  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  in  urban  and  semi-\nurban areas, JBIC has concentrated its assistance on generation and rural electrification projects.\nDFID has financed transmission and distribution in the Dhaka area. USAID has been instrumental\nin establishing and funding REB and the first PBSs, and continues to provide technical support to\nREB and the PBSs. KfW (for the Government of Germany) has assisted in augmenting generating\ncapacity,  and  in  reinforcing  transmission  projects.  Other  aid  agencies  have  also  financed\ngeneration  projects,  although  France  and  OPEC  have  financed  some  transmission  and\ndistribution  projects  as  well.  The  World  Bank  had  earlier  supported  distribution  in  smaller  towns\nand rural areas. However, after the reforms were initiated, it has not provided any assistance to\nthe sector other than TA for soliciting private participation in power generation and establishing the\nPower  Cell  which  is  mandated  to  plan  and  execute  reform  related  activities  and  act  as  a\nquasi-regulator until the statutory regulator is appointed.\n\nD. \n\nLessons Learned\n\n1.\n\nContextual Issues\n\n19.\nADB has been extensively supporting the power sector over the last 25 years. From being\na provider of funds for individual projects in the 1970s, it became a provider of funds as well as\ntechnical advice in the 1980s. Since the adoption of the PSRB in 1994, ADB has been providing\npolicy advice to the Government in implementing the PSRB, as well as funds to help achieve the\nleast cost expansion program. During this involvement, ADB has learned the following lessons.\n\n20.\nOverall Macroeconomic/Political Issues. Macroeconomic/political issues of the country\nhave  a  significant  bearing  on  the  sector's  performance  as  well  as  its  ability  to  reform.  Political\n\n\f6\n\nunrest,  labor  militancy,  law  and  order  enforcement,  speed  and  quality  of  the  judicial  processes,\nand ability of the education system to provide the staff required for efficiently operating the sector,\nall affect the sector's performance. However, there is very little that the sector by itself can do to\nsystematically redress these problems. Thus at any point in time, power sector development can\nonly proceed up to a point and no more. Forcing actions beyond this point without removing the\nconstraints becomes dysfunctional and even jeopardizes the reform process.\n\n21.\nSector  Entities.  Delegation  of  powers  from  the  Government  to  the  management  of  the\nsector entities and from the management to the staff is crucial for speedy and efficient decision\nmaking. Due to efforts by ADB, delegation of power has been significantly improved, resulting in\nspeedier  decisions  on  procurement  by  the  newly  established  companies.  BPDB  and  DESA  are\nalso  restricted  by  the  Government's  personnel  and  wage  policies;  therefore,  recruiting  and\nretaining  of  competent  staff  and  retrenching  or  dismissing  of  excess  or  nonperforming  staff  are\ninhibited.  The  situation  is  being  addressed  and  a  beginning  has  been  made  by  PGCB  and\nDESCO. The above factors clearly underscore the limited extent of the improvements that can\nbe made to the existing power sector entities in their present form. It is therefore essential to (i)\ncreate  new  sector  entities  that  are  not  subject  to  the  organizational  limitations  of  BPDB  and\nDESA, and (ii) establish an overall environment of commercialization in the sector.\n\n22.\nGradualism. Fundamental changes in infrastructure sectors take time to implement even\nin  developed  countries.  In  developing  countries,  change  is  more  difficult  to  implement  and,\ntherefore,  requires  a  gradual  approach.  Speeding  up  reforms  is  functional  only  if  the  change  is\ncomprehensive. For example, increasing tariffs too rapidly may help the finances of the sector but\noften  undermines  the  objectives  of  the  reforms  by  penalizing  the  good  consumer  if  the  utilities\ncollect only from a low percentage of consumers. Affordability is also a factor. Rapid rises in tariffs\ncan  drive  up  the  costs  of  electricity  so  that  it  becomes  unaffordable  to  the  poorer  consumers,\nwhereas  more  gradual  increases  could  have  allowed  time  for  managing  the  effects  of  the\nincrease.\n\n2.\n\nCompliance with Reforms Actions Under Earlier ADB Loans\n\nThe  ADB-financed  Eighth  Power  Project9  closed  on  23  February  2001  and  the  Rural\n23.\nElectrification  Project  (footnote  3)  on  29  January  2001.  All  structural  reform-related\nconditionalities  stipulated  in  these  loans  have  been  met.  While  several  of  the  restructuring\nconditionalities  stipulated  under  the  ongoing  Ninth  Power  Project10  and  Dhaka  Power  System\nUpgrade Project11 have been fulfilled, some are still to be met as indicated below.\n\n24.\nHanding over Transmission Assets to PGCB. BPDB and PGCB have jointly proposed\nthe physical and legal transfer of all transmission assets of BPDB to PGCB by September 2002.\nThe Government approved this plan in May 2001. The agreement needs to be followed by the\nphysical handover of assets, transfer of related personnel, finalization of the associated financial\ntransactions, and establishment of PGCB's partial tariffs. Considerable progress has been made\nin this  area.  PGCB\u2019s  partial  tariffs have been notified and approval for payment of termination\nbenefits  and  transfer  of  BPDB  personnel  to  PGCB  were  approved  on  6  September  2001.\nForty-five percent of BPDB\u2019s transmission assets have already been transferred to PGCB.\n\n                  \n\n9  Loan No. 963-BAN(SF): Eight Power Project, for SDR 132.677 million approved on 11 July 1989.\n10 Loan No. 1505-BAN(SF): Ninth Power Project for SDR 92.931 million approved on 18 December 1996.\n11 Loan  No.  1730/1731-BAN:  Dhaka  Power  Systems  Upgrade  Project,  for  SDR  54.319  million  plus  $82.0  million,\n\napproved on 21 December 1999.\n\n\f7\n\nCorporatizing Ashuganj Power Station. Ashuganj Power Company was incorporated\n25.\nin  June  2000,  and  its  first  board  of  directors  constituted  in  September  2001.  The  board  has\ninitiated the process for recruiting the company\u2019s first management.\n\nHanding over DESA's Gulshan Circle Assets to DESCO. Physical handover is to be\n26.\ncompleted by December 2002. Legal and financial aspects need to be settled by early 2002 to\nallow the transfer. DESCO also needs to establish its own billing and financial accounting center\nby early 2002 to accept the transfer of customer records from DESA.\n\n27.\nLiquidating  the  Government\u2019s  dues  to  BPDB,  REB,  and  DESA.  It  is  imperative  for\nthe Government to lead in commercializing the sector by liquidating the arrears owed by it and\nits agencies to BPDB and DESA. In September 2001, the Government made a special budget\nallocation of Tk690 million (about 30 percent of total dues) to settle outstanding dues to BPDB\nand DESA. This process will be expanded to include DESCO and PBSs also.\n\n28.\nThe  fulfillment  of  conditions  related  to  restructuring  has  been  delayed  in  some  cases  by\nover a year. Nevertheless, the Government must be complimented in its determination to follow\nthrough  with  these  politically  difficult  and  sensitive  actions.  Some  actions  have  led  to  law  and\norder  problems  that  the  Government  had  to  tackle  firmly.  Since  the  reform  program  started  in\n1994, the Government has always delivered on the conditionalities it has agreed to as part of the\nprocess  of  power  sector  reforms.  The  Government  has  also,  on  its  own,  started  the  process  of\nrationalizing retail electricity tariffs for residential consumers of BPDB and DESA, as also the base\nretail  tariffs  for  the  sector.  This  gives  DPs  confidence  that  the  Government  will  take  necessary\nactions to determinedly pursue reforms in the future.\n\n3.\n\nPerformance of Executing Agencies\n\n29.\nThe  political  unrest  in  the  country  over  the  last  few  years  has  significantly  affected  the\ncollection operations of both BPDB and DESA since many commercial establishments, including\nbanks,  were  closed  for  prolonged  periods  and  those  that  were  open  functioned  with  minimal\nservices.  DESA  was  particularly  hard  hit  since  Dhaka,  as  the  capital  city,  was  the  center  of  the\nunrest,  and  normal  life  in  the  city  was  disrupted  for  longer  periods  than  in  other  towns.  During\nFY2000,  the  collection-to-generation  ratio  of  BPDB  and  the  collection-to-import  ratio  of  DESA\nwere  65.9 percent  and  65.1  percent,  respectively.  These  were  way  below  the  targets,  which\nwere  75 percent  for  BPDB  and  70  percent  for  DESA.  In  FY2001,  however,  with  the\nimplementation  of  the  ADB-funded  Financial  Management  Upgrade  Project,12  the  collection\nperformance of both utilities has gone up dramatically, resulting in a collection-generation ratio\nof 70.8 percent for BPDB. DESA\u2019s performance remained stagnant on account of the deferred\npayments instituted with the PBSs that had just taken over DESA\u2019s loss-incurring rural areas in\nFY1999.  The  performance  of  the  seven  PBSs  supported  by  ADB  in  the  Rural  Electrification\nProject  (footnote  3)  has  been  very  good,  with  an  average  collection-to-import  ratio  of  over  85\npercent. REB\u2019s (PBSs\u2019) overall collection-import performance slightly deteriorated to 77.4 percent\nin  FY2001  on  account  of  the  bad  areas  taken  over  from  DESA.  However,  the  trends  are  in  the\nright  direction  and  these  PBSs  should  contribute  positively  to  the  sector\u2019s  financial  viability  in\nFY2002.  The  operational  performance  of  BPDB,  DESA,  REB  and  DESCO  over  the  last  eight\nyears since the start of reforms is summarized in Table 2.\n\n12 TA  2004-BAN: Financial Management Upgrade of BPDB and DESA,  for  $1,000,000,  approved  on  26 November\n\n                  \n\n1993.\n\n\f8\n\nTable 2: Operational Performance of the Power Sector, FY1994\u2013FY2001\n\nItem\n\n1994\n\n1995\n\n1996\n\n1997\n\n1998\n\n1999\n\n2000\n\n2001\n\n      9,784  10,806    11,475    11,858    12,870    14,450    15,563    17,021\n        578         824      2,248\n      9,221    10,166   10,845  11,243  12,182    13,634    14,739    16,309\n\n      7,441      8,372      8,996      9,447    10,177    11,351    12,469    14,002\n      5,082     5,586      5,825     5,810\n  6,238      7,045      7,515      8,324\n       3,745      4,209      4,445      4,485      4,757      5,405      5,965      6,762\n       3,696      4,162      4,551      4,962      5,419      5,947      6,504      7,240\n       2,538      2,914      3,209      3,589      3,908      4,469      4,831      5,392\n        344         550         628\n        205         369         440\n          906      1,247      1,372      1,472      1,718      2,442      3,172      4,114\n          765      1,052      1,172      1,220      1,435      1,989      2,546      3,386\n\n21.60\n23.69\n28.44\n29.49\n31.30\n\n20.33\n22.81\n27.59\n27.67\n29.55\n\n20.93\n23.73\n29.09\n27.89\n30.13\n\n14.60\n35.04\n\n17.15\n34.04\n\n16.46\n34.87\n\n21.45\n23.29\n29.69\n24.84\n29.89\n\n40.51\n18.55\n35.77\n\n19.88      17.73\n20.63      18.76\n26.72      24.93\n25.72      25.53\n34.56      36.55\n\n32.86      29.86\n19.74      17.68\n35.82      33.65\n\n     14,067    15,684    16,791    18,487    21,014    23,622    27,359    31,903\n     11,551    14,142    15,577    16,264    17,018    16,698    22,515    27,436\n       5,962      6,530      7,082      8,648      9,862    10,768    11,423    13,015\n       4,742      5,841      5,998      7,084      7,929      8,200    10,007    11,403\n        569      1,067      1,297\n        337         836      1,042\n       2,101      2,710      3,180      3,518      4,448      6,139      7,837    10,810\n       2,079      2,594      3,124      3,348      4,253      5,763      7,596    10,164\n\n23.95\n26.32\n30.26\n31.34\n32.77\n\n22.53\n24.65\n29.42\n30.00\n31.71\n\nGeneration, MkWh\nBPDB (gross)\nIPP\nNet\nEnergy Import and Sales, (MkWh)\nGross BPDB Sales\nImport by BPDB Zones\nSales by BPDB Zones\nImport by DESA\nSales by DESA\nImport by DESCO\nSales by DESCO\nImport by REB\nSales by REB\nSystem Loss (Percent)\nBPDBa\nBPDB Zonesb\nBPDB Zones (Net of sales to REB)\nDESAb\nDESA (Net of Sales to REB and\nDESCO)\nDESCOb\nREBb\nOverall Power Systema\nBilling and Collection (Tk million)\nBPDB Bills\nBPDB Collection\nDESA Bills\nDESA Collection\nDESCO Bills\nDESCO Collection\nREB Bills\nREB Collection\nCollection (as percent of Billing)\nBPDB\nDESA\nDESCO\nREB\nCollection-generation/Collection-Import ratio (Percent)\nBPDB Collection-Generation\nDESA Collection-Import\nDESCO Collection-Import\nREB Collection-Import\n\n69.85\n62.61\n-\n80.72\n\n62.45\n54.61\n-\n83.51\n\n82.11\n79.54\n\n90.17\n89.45\n\n15.67\n35.90\n\n15.61\n37.23\n\n95.72\n\n98.95\n\n92.77\n84.69\n\n87.98\n81.91\n\n80.98\n80.40\n\n98.24\n\n95.17\n\n95.62\n\n72.73\n59.72\n-\n83.90\n\n70.09\n59.25\n-\n78.85\n\n64.03\n57.98\n-\n79.88\n\n70.69\n76.15\n59.23\n93.88\n\n55.53\n57.24\n35.23\n76.46\n\n82.29\n87.60\n78.35\n96.92\n\n65.93\n65.07\n52.60\n77.79\n\n86.00\n87.61\n80.31\n94.02\n\n70.75\n65.25\n56.33\n77.40\n\nBPDB = Bangladesh Power Development Board, IPP = independent power producer, DESA = Dhaka Electric Supply\nAuthority, DESCO = Dhaka Electric Power Supply Authority, REB = Rural Electrification Board, MW = megawatts.\nNotes:    1.

In\nconsultation with the Government and the other DPs involved in the sector, ADB has developed\nits strategy to improve the power sector in Bangladesh. The strategy consists of (i) changes in the\nbusiness  environment  through  corporatization,  commercialization,  and  increasing  private  sector\nparticipation;  (ii) institutional  improvements  in  BPDB  and  DESA;  (iii)  creation  of  new  sector\nagencies that could serve as role models for the sector; (iv) enlarging the scope of the PBSs; and\n(v)  strengthening  the  long-term  planning  and  regulatory  processes  in  the  sector.  The  proposed\nProject addresses items (i), (iii), and (iv) of this strategy. Item (ii) is an ongoing process and item\n(v) has partially been addressed through the PSMP, the creation of the Power Cell, and ADB\u2019s TA\nSupport for an Energy Regulatory Authority (footnote 8).\n\nF. \n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n31.\nADB,  the  World  Bank,  JBIC,  DFID,  USAID,  and  KfW,  have  all  been  involved  in  policy\ndialogue with the Government about issues in the power sector, with ADB playing the role of DP\ncoordinator.  ADB  has  played  a  major  role  in  drawing  up  the  reform  assistance  strategy  of  the\nDPs.  In  addition,  it  has  organized  coordination  meetings  for  the  power  sector  in  1992,  1994,\n1995,  and  1996,  and  for  the  power  and  natural  gas  sectors  in  1997,  1998,  1999,  and  2001.\nADB-led  aid  coordination  meetings  in  December  1992,  December  1994,  and  September  1995\ncontributed to the formulation of reforms and identification of reforms-linked projects in the sector.\nADB  also  provided  TAs  to  review  electricity  legislation,13  prepare  a  power  system  master  plan\n(footnote 7), upgrade the financial management of BPDB and DESA (footnote 12), seek private\nsector  implementation  of  the  Meghnaghat  Project  (footnote  4),  and  corporatize  the  Ashuganj\nPower Station of BPDB.14 ADB has been instrumental in assisting the Government to draw up a\nplan for the planned transformation of the sector, as well as creation of new sector entities.\n\n32.\nThe medium-term goals of the policy dialogue with the Government up to 2005 and the\nresults achieved so far are summarized in  Appendix 2. Generation is no longer a monopoly and\nhas  sufficient  private  sector  interest,  and  the  public  sector  stations  are  starting  to  be\ncorporatized and commercialized. A start has been made segregating the transmission function\nand corporatizing it. Distribution is being corporatized in the Dhaka area, and the private sector\nPBSs have increased their share of sales from 13 percent in FY1993 to 27 percent in FY2001\nand will increase this to over 30 percent by FY2005. Average retail power tariffs were increased\nby about 15 percent (in September and December 1996) and an interim formula for semiannual\nadjustment  of  retail  power  tariffs  to  take  into  account  fluctuations  in  fuel  costs  and  foreign\nexchange  rates  has  been  successfully  implemented.15  On  the  regulatory  side,  work  has\nprogressed  through  the  creation  of  the  Power  Cell.  Preparatory  studies  on  new  legislation,\nsector structure, and tariff framework have been completed. The Electricity Reform Bill 2001,16\nwhich will form the legal basis for power sector reform, is being reviewed by parliament.\n\n                  \n\n13 TA 1743-BAN: Review of Electricity Legislation and Regulations, for $90,000, approved on 18 August 1992.\n14 TA 3343-BAN: Corporatization of Ashuganj Power Station, for $1,000,000, approved on 17 December 1999.\n15 Agreed upon as part of the policy dialogue under ADB\u2019s Loan 1505-BAN (SF): Ninth Power Project.\n16 Supported by ADB under TA 1743-BAN (footnote 10) as well as by a World Bank TA.\n\n\fG. \n\nAid Coordination\n\n10\n\n33.\nAid coordination in the sector has been intensive since the start of the reform process.\nThe DPs hold a formal coordination meeting every year where sector policies and achievements\nare reviewed by headquarters staff, and over the last year have introduced quarterly meetings\nat the Resident Mission level to monitor progress. Informal views are also exchanged between\nADB  missions  that  visit  Dhaka  and  the  resident  missions/  offices  of  other  DPs  whenever\npossible. Regular visits by senior ADB staff to Washington, and World Bank staff to Manila have\nalso  ensured  that  there  is  full  exchange  of  views  between  the  World  Bank  and  ADB.  Aide-\nmemoires of ADB missions are shared with all DPs, and points of specific concern to any DP\nare discussed by email and telephone.\n\nAs  is  to  be  expected  in  such  a  complex  sector,  there  are  differences  in  views  and\n34.\nperceptions among some of the DPs. However, these differences are not on the fundamentals\nof  the  reform  strategy  being  adopted,  but  on  the  pace  and  timing  of  specific  reform  actions,\nespecially those related to (i) privatization of distribution; (ii) transfer of assets between BPDB\nand DESA and their successor entities; and (iii) rationalization of tariffs.\n\n35.\nThe  Project  has  been  extensively  discussed  between  ADB  and  the  other  DPs  and  is\nsupported  by  JBIC,  KfW,  Nordic  Development  Fund  (NDF),  and  DFID.  JBIC  is  seeking  to\ncomplement the Project through a new loan that will strengthen and intensify rural electrification\nin  four  PBSs,  including  one  in  the  Khulna  area.  KfW  and  NDF  are  parallel  cofinancing  the\nProject.  KfW  has  also  been  in  constant  dialogue  with  the  Government  in  support  of  the\nliquidation of the Government's dues to BPDB and DESA. DFID is actively considering support\nfor the West Zone Electricity Distribution Company that is being established as a successor to\nBPDB\u2019s distribution operations in the west zone.\n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\n36.\nPoverty  reduction  is  ADB\u2019s  overarching  goal.  Poverty  reduction  requires  expansion  in\nthe economy, increase in productivity, as well as equitable distribution of the gains of economic\nexpansion and increased productivity to the entire population. The power sector contributes to\nthis  objective  by  (i)  being  an  essential  ingredient  for  increasing  economic  growth;  and  (ii)\nimproving  the  quality  of  life  of  consumers,  taking  advantage  of  the  information  technology\nrevolution  and  employment  opportunities  created,  especially  in  the  rural  areas.  In  the\nBangladesh  context,  where  only  about  20  percent  of  the  population  has  access  to  electricity,\nthis  means  that  the  electrification  program  in  the  smaller  towns  and  villages  should  be\naccelerated  to  increase  the  population's  access  to  electricity.  However,  increasing  rural\nconnections  is  not  feasible  until  the  entire  supply  chain  comprising  the  generation  and\ntransmission facilities is augmented. The Project, therefore, aims to facilitate generation through\nthe private sector by establishing transmission and distribution lines to help evacuate and utilize\nthe power, at the same time, providing electricity to the district towns and villages in southwest\nBangladesh, a relatively poor area of the country.\n\n37.\nThe  Project  continues  the  long-term  strategy  of  the  Government  and  ADB  for  power\nsector reforms, which are presented in Appendix 2. The rationale for the choice of the Project\ncomponents is given below.\n\n\f11\n\n1. \n\nGeneration\n\n38.\nPotential has been created for the private sector to add 1,400 MW of capacity over the\nnext five years. This is 35 percent of the current installed capacity of 4,028 MW and 50 percent\nof the currently available capacity of about 2,800 MW. There is a need to slow down and take\nstock of the situation before further capacity is committed in the private sector. The Government\nhas guaranteed conversion of foreign exchange under the several implementation agreements\nthat  were  signed  or  committed  to  be  signed  with  private  sector  IPPs,  and  the  amount  under\nguarantee  represents  a  significant  portion  of  its  total  foreign  exchange  reserves.  A  \u201cshelf\u201d  of\nprojects  for  speedy  implementation  already  exists.  The  expansion  stages  of  the  Meghnaghat\nproject  offer  the  least-cost  alternatives,  since  their  infrastructure  will  already  have  been\ndeveloped during the first stage. Sites are being identified for 200 MW of peaking capacity in the\nDhaka area, and these sites could be prepared for future expansion through advance actions for\nenvironmental  approvals,  permits/licenses,  and  draft  operating  agreements.  The  total  capacity\nof these projects would be adequate to fulfill the requirements of the east zone in the next five\nyears. In the west zone, the development of the Bheramara/Serajganj sites is being considered\nalong the lines of development of the Meghnaghat site. ADB has already allocated funds under\nits  Ninth  Power  Project  for  comprehensive  studies  and  development  of  two  peaking  power\nplants in the east zone and for a major site for base load generation in the west zone. Hence,\nthere is no priority public sector investment requiring ADB support in this subsector.\n\n2. \n\nTransmission\n\n39.\nIn  the  transmission  area,  priority  investments  include  (i)  the  National  Load  Dispatch\nCenter;  (ii)  the  strengthening  of  the  primary  transmission  system  in  the  west  zone;  (iii)\ncompletion of the 230 kilovolt (kV) double-circuit ring around Dhaka; and (iv) the second east-\nwest  interconnector  between  Ashuganj  and  Serajganj,  utilizing  the  Bangabandhu  Bridge  over\nthe Jamuna River.\n\n40. With the ADB assistance to PGCB under the Ninth Power Project and the Dhaka Power\nSystem Upgrade Project, funding for the 230 kV double circuit ring system around Dhaka has\nbeen secured. The World Bank and JBIC have indicated their possible support for financing the\nNational Load Dispatch Center. Components for strengthening the west zone network and the\nsecond  east-west  interconnector  are  the  only  remaining  works  of  priority  since  these  are\nessential  for  delivering  adequate  quantities  of  secure  power  to  the  west  zone  and  also  for\nevacuation  and  economic  utilization  of  power  from  all  the  BOO/build-operate-transfer  (BOT)\nprojects  proposed  to  be  contracted  at  Serajganj  and  Bheramara.  Hence,  these  components\nhave been identified for support by ADB, KfW, and NDF.\n\n3.\n\nDistribution\n\n41.\nGiven the extensive participation of the private sector in generation projects, the financial\nviability  of  the  power  sector  would  be  in  jeopardy  unless  the  distribution  subsector  is\nstrengthened  to  ensure  offtake  of  power  as  well  as  generate  adequate  revenues  for  servicing\nthe  investments  in  the  generation  and  transmission  subsectors.  Otherwise,  the  Government\u2019s\nguarantees  to  the  IPPs  could  be  called,  placing  an  unacceptable  burden  on  its  budgets.\nThrough its earlier operations, ADB has consolidated the reforms in the distribution subsector in\nthe  Dhaka  area.  It  would  be  prudent  to  wait  for  improvements  to  occur  and  the  reforms  to\nproduce the anticipated results before deciding on another round of assistance. Therefore, the\nonly  priority  would  be  to  assist  other  major  towns  to  restructure  and  upgrade  their  distribution\nnetworks. Given that the southwest is one of the poorer regions in Bangladesh, and upgrading\n\n\f12\n\nof infrastructure is urgently needed to stimulate economic growth for poverty reduction, it would\nbe appropriate if ADB\u2019s next assistance support both urban and rural distribution in this region.\nThis will also provide the opportunity for commencing the corporatization of BPDB's distribution,\nand rationalizing the boundaries between BPDB and REB in the area, leading to lower losses\nand higher collections, and improving the self-sustainability of the sector.\n\nIn  the  Dhaka  area,  results  of  the  Financial  Management  Upgrade  Project  (FMU)17\n42.\nfunded by ADB, combined with the Pilot Scheme for Loss Reduction supported by JBIC, have\nbeen  encouraging.  Such  reduction  in  losses,  if  effected  on  a  large  scale,  would  considerably\nease the financial pressure on the sector. Hence upgrading of distribution in the areas outside\nDhaka and extension of FMU to them, is an ADB priority in the next phase of sector reforms.\n\n4. \n\nInstitutional Strengthening\n\n43.\nThe Bangladesh power sector will have to rapidly expand if the current low access rate\nof  electricity  is  to  speedily  improve.  Expansion  will  place  a  major  burden  on  the  human\nresources  of  all  agencies  in  the  sector.  The  present  structures  of  BPDB  and  DESA  are  not\nconducive to rapid decision making and commercial accountability. It is therefore proposed that\nas part of the new operation, (i) the west distribution operations of BPDB be corporatized; and\n(ii) the remainder of DESA, which will service the southern part of metropolitan Dhaka after the\nhanding over of assets to DESCO, be corporatized. While the corporatization of DESA will be\naddressed  through  ADB's  proposed  TA  being  considered  separately,  the  corporatization  of\nBPDB's distribution in the west zone will be supported through TA and a loan component.18\n\nBased  on  the  above  analysis,  it  is  appropriate  for  ADB  to  support  (i)  completion  of  the\n44.\n230 kV  \"backbone\"  transmission  system  in  the  west  zone  and  the  second  east-west\ninterconnector,  (ii)  upgrading  of  urban  and  rural  distribution  in  the  southwest;  and  (iii)\ncorporatization of BPDB's southwest distribution.\n\nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n45.\nThe objectives of the Project are to (i) increase electrification in southwest Bangladesh;\n(ii) enable evacuation and economic utilization of the power generated from the projects being\ncontracted at Baghabari and Bheramara; and (iii) reduce losses, improve reliability, and expand\nthe capacity of the transmission and distribution systems in southwest Bangladesh. The logical\nframework for the Project is at Appendix 3.\n\n46.\n\nThe Project comprises the following:\n\n1. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nConstructing 230kV Transmission Lines and Substations (Part A)\n\nIshurdi-Baghabari 230 kV double circuit transmission line (55 kilometers [km])19\nBaghabari-Bogra  (via  Serajganj)  230  kV  double-circuit \n(110 km)20\nIshurdi-Bheramara-Khulna 230 kV double-circuit transmission line (160 km)\n\ntransmission \n\nline\n\n17 Supported  by  ADB  through  TA  2004-BAN  (footnote  9)  and  Loan  963-BAN  (SF):  Eighth Power Project  for\n\n18 DFID  has  indicated  that  it  may  be  interested  in  funding  a   \"twinning\"  arrangement  with  a  reputed  electric\n\npower utility.

In addition to\n47.\nthe evacuation of power from the current and planned generation capacity in the west zone, the\nProject will also add to the transfer capacity between the east and west zones thus optimizing\nthe generation resources in both regions. This will reduce the cost of power supply in the West\nZone  and  will  lead  to  better  stability  and  reliability  of  the  power  system  as  a  whole.  The\ndistribution  components  in  reducing  losses,  improving  the  quality  of  supply,  and  in  supplying\nelectricity to over 500,000  additional consumers, a significant portion of whom live in the rural\nareas. Computerization will result in significant improvements in billing and collections and will\nalso improve customer satisfaction.\n\nD. \n\nCost Estimates\n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  $402.1  million  equivalent,  including  foreign\n48.\nexchange  cost  of  $259.0  million  (64.4  percent)  and  local  currency  costs  of  $143.1  million\n(35.6 percent)  A  detailed  breakdown  of  the  Project's  scope  along  with  cost  estimates  is  in\nAppendix 4.

The  first  loan  will  be  for  Special  Drawing  Rights  (SDR)  47.581  million\n($60.2  million  equivalent)  from  ADB's  special  funds  resources  and  will  fund  parts  B  (iii)\nthrough(v), and C of the Project. The loan will have a repayment period of 32 years including a\ngrace period of 8 years and an interest charge of 1.0 percent during the grace period and 1.5\npercent thereafter. The borrower will be the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh and the proceeds\nwill be re-lent to BPDB (and later transferred to its successor companies) and REB pursuant to\nsubsidiary  loan  agreements  with  terms  and  conditions  acceptable  to  ADB.  Relending  terms  to\nBPDB will include a repayment period of 20 years including a 5 year grace period, and interest\nat  the  rate  of  5.5  percent  per  annum.  The  foreign  exchange  risk  will  be  assumed  by  BPDB\nduring  the  life  of  the  subsidiary  loan,  and  by  the  borrower  thereafter.  For  REB,  the  relending\nterms will include an interest rate of 2 percent per annum, repayment over 30 years including a\n\n\f15\n\ngrace period of 8 years during which the interest will be 0.75 percent per annum. The borrower\nwill bear the foreign exchange risk.\n\nThe second loan23 will be for $138.7 million from ADB's ordinary capital resources (OCR)\n51.\nand will fund parts A, B (i), and B (ii) of the Project. The loan will have a 20-year term, including\na grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based\nvariable lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum, a front-end fee of 1.0\npercent  (the  front-end  fee  will  be  capitalized  in  the  loan),  conversion  options  that  may  be\nexercised  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  draft  Loan  Agreement,  the  Loan  Regulations,\nADB\u2019s Conversion Guidelines, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan\nAgreement.  The  Government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  the  Government\u2019s\ndecision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and\nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were the Government\u2019s own independent\ndecision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice by ADB. The borrower will\nbe the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh. The loan proceeds will be re-lent to PGCB and BPDB\n(and later transferred to the new company) pursuant to subsidiary loan agreements with terms\nand  conditions  acceptable  to  ADB.  Relending  terms  to  PGCB  and  BPDB  will  include  a\nrepayment  period  of  20  years  including  a  5-year  grace  period,  and  interest  at  the  rate  of  5.5\npercent per annum. Foreign exchange risk will be assumed by PGCB and BPDB during the life\nof the respective subsidiary loan, and thereafter by the borrower.\n\n52. While  KfW  and  NDF  have  confirmed  their  participation  in  the  Project,  DFID  has\nexpressed interest in considering participation in part B and will be in a position to confirm such\nparticipation  only  by  January  2002.  This  may  result  in  changes  in  scope  and  implementing\narrangements  as  well  as  a  reduction  in  ADB\u2019s  OCR  loan.  For  the  first  time,  ADB  has  also\nencouraged  PGCB  to  obtain  commercial  cofinancing  (suppliers\u2019  credit)  through  international\ncompetitive bidding for $20.1 equivalent for the Ishurdi-Baghabari transmission line.\n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1. \n\nImplementation Schedule and Performance Review\n\nThe implementation schedule of the Project is in Appendix 5. Implementation will begin\n53.\nin  November  2001  and  be  completed  in  March  2006.  Direct  supervision  of  subproject\nimplementation and monitoring of subproject operation performance will be the responsibility of\nthe  Executing  Agencies  (EAs)  and  the  Government.  These  agencies  will  provide  quarterly\nprogress reports to ADB covering their respective responsibilities within 30 days from the end of\neach quarter. ADB will review the implementation and operation of the Project based on these\nreports and meet with the EAs and the Government semi-annually to discuss project progress.\nADB will also monitor the overall performance of the EAs.\n\n2. \n\nProcurement\n\nGoods  and  services  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  following  ADB's  Guidelines for\n54.\nProcurement. For such procurement, bid specifications will be prepared so as to ensure maximum\ncompetition  under  international  competitive  bidding.  A  list  of  the  major  contract  packages  under\nthe Project with their cost estimates is given in Appendix 6.\n\n                  \n\n23 Refer to note under Table 4  and para. 52. Reduction in ADB financing as a result of bilateral cofinancing will affect\n\nmainly parts B (i) and (ii) of the Project and hence the OCR loan.\n\n\f16\n\n3. \n\nConsulting Services\n\n55.\nConsultants will support PGCB, BPDB, and REB for their respective parts of the Project\nand will be recruited in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Consultants\nwill essentially provide design review, quality assurance services and training.24\n\n4. \n\nAdvance Procurement Action\n\nAll the EAs have sufficient expertise in procuring materials for the works entrusted to them\n56.\nunder  the  Project  and  were  allowed  to  initiate  advance  procurement  action  for  the  goods  and\nservices to be financed by ADB. The Government has been advised that ADB's approval of such\nadvance  procurement  action  will  not  in  any  way  commit  it  to  subsequently  approve  the  Project.\nRetroactive financing has not been permitted.\n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Procedures\n\nSince  the  disbursements  under  the  Project  will  be  mainly  for  supply  of  goods  and\n57.\nconsulting  services,  ADB's  commitment  letter  and  direct  payment  procedures  will  be  used  for\nthe purpose.\n\n6. \n\nReports,  Accounts,  and Audits\n\n58.\nThe  EAs  will  prepare  separate  progress  reports  for  their  respective  components  and\nsubmit  them  to  ADB  on  a  quarterly  basis.  The  reports  will  provide  a  narrative  description  of\nprogress made during the period, changes in the implementation schedule, problems or difficulties\nencountered,  the  performance  of  the  project  implementation  consultants,  and  the  work  to  be\ncarried out in the next period. The progress reports will also include a summary financial account\nfor  the  Project,  consisting  of  project  expenditures  during  the  period  year  to  date,  and  total\nexpenditure  to  date.  ADB  will  review  the  implementation  and  operation  of  the  Project  based  on\nthese  reports  and  meet  with  the  EAs  and  the  Government  semiannually  to  discuss  project\nprogress.  Project  completion  reports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  within  three  months  of  project\ncompletion.\n\n59.\nThe  EAs  will  have  their  annual  financial  statements  and  project  accounts  audited  by  a\nprofessional  auditing  firm  acceptable  to  ADB.  Unaudited  statements  will  be  submitted  to  ADB\nwithin  six  months  of  the  close  of  the  financial  year  and  audited  statements  within  three  months\nthereafter.\n\nG. \n\nExecuting Agencies\n\nPart A will be executed by PGCB. BPDB will transfer the Ishurdi 230 kV substation, the\n60.\nKhulna Central 132 kV substation, and the associated 230 kV and 132 kV transmission lines to\nPGCB  before  PGCB  executes  Part  A.  Part  B  will  be  executed  by  BPDB  initially  and  by  its\ncorporatized subsidiary ultimately. REB will implement Part C of the Project.\n\n                  \n\n24 DFID stated that it may enlarge the scope of consulting services under part B (ii) and training under B (v) to provide a\ncomprehensive organization development intervention, spanning 3-5 years. If realized, this intervention by DFID will\nbe a major step for power sector reforms in Bangladesh. Selection of consultants will then follow DFID guidelines.\n\n\f17\n\n1.\n\nThe Power Grid Company of Bangladesh (PGCB)\n\na.\n\nResponsibilities\n\nPGCB  is  a  limited-liability  company  registered  under  the  Companies\u2019  Act,  1994.  The\n61.\nMemorandum  of  Association  of  PGCB  gives  it  a  wide-ranging  mandate  to  be  involved  in  a\nmultitude of activities, not only in electricity but in any infrastructure project, both in Bangladesh\nand abroad. However, PGCB\u2019s primary role is to act as the owner and operator of the country\u2019s\ntransmission network and the National Load Dispatch Center.\n\nb.\n\nOrganization Structure\n\nPGCB  is  governed  by  a  part-time  board  of  directors  elected  by  its  shareholders,  who  in\n62.\nturn appoint a full-time managing director and two functional directors. The chairperson of BPDB\nis  the  chairperson  of  the  board  of  directors  of  PGCB  as  long  as  BPDB  holds  shares  in  PGCB.\nPGCB  has  recruited  about  550  staff  from  BPDB  in  September  2001  as  well  as  received  over\n1,200 km of 230 kV and 132 kV transmission lines and four major 230 kV substations. It already\nhas  an  established  project  management  team  that  is  conversant  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines,  with\nexperience  drawn  from  implementing  the  ADB-funded  Ninth  Power  and  Dhaka  Power  System\nUpgrade Projects.\n\nc.\n\nFinancial Performance\n\n63.\nThe  financial  performance  of  PGCB  depends  on  the  rate  of  transfer  of  assets  from\nBPDB to PGCB. Since the tariff structure applicable to PGCB is based on the net fixed assets in\noperation,  and  takes  into  account  a  post-tax  return  of  15  percent  per  annum,  the  financial\nsituation  of  PGCB  should  be  fairly  robust  provided  it  collects  its  dues  on  time.  To  alleviate\nconcerns  in  this  regard,  the  Government  has  already  issued  two  notifications  for  transmission\ntariffs  in  1998  and  2001,  taking  into  account  the  assets  held  by  PGCB  at  each  time.  PGCB\naccounts receivable from BPDB, REB, and DESA have been brought down to the equivalent of\ntwo months billing and steps are being taken to maintain this level. A summary of the financial\nprojections  and  indicators  for  PGCB  is  in  Table  5.  The  financial  projections  and  the  critical\nassumptions used in developing the financial projections are in Appendix 7.\n\n\f18\n\nTable 5: Summary of PGCB's Projected Financial Performance,\nFY 2000-2007\n(Tk million)\n\nItem\n\n2000\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\nTotal Revenue\n\nNet Profit\n\nTotal Assets\n\n172.6\n\n575.8\n\n994.2\n\n1,650.4\n\n2,549.2\n\n4,020.7\n\n5,667.2\n\n7,389.9\n\n23.8\n\n84.7\n\n317.1\n\n579.3\n\n654.9\n\n706.6\n\n1,218.0\n\n1,897.2\n\n3,489.6\n\n6,954.4\n\n19,576.8\n\n30,971.8\n\n43,193.0\n\n55,469.2\n\n64,855.1\n\n70,658.6\n\nCurrent Liabilities\n\n522.7\n\n263.9\n\n562.0\n\n1,043.6\n\n1,387.9\n\n2,749.1\n\n4,344.7\n\n6,344.9\n\nLong-Term Liabilities\n\n1,818.3\n\n4,347.6\n\n11,683.1\n\n19,749.2\n\n28,560,6\n\n36,909.2\n\n41,885.4\n\n43,245.3\n\nEquity\n\n1,148.5\n\n2,342.9\n\n7,331.7\n\n10,179.0\n\n13,244.5\n\n15,810.8\n\n18,625.0\n\n21,068.3\n\nRate of Return on Net\n\n22.9\n\n2.59\n\n5.3\n\n6.5\n\n4.7\n\n3.5\n\n3.9\n\n4.8\n\n     Fixed Assets  (%)\n\nOperating Margin (%)\n\n62.2\n\n63.5\n\n58.5\n\nRate of Return on\n\n2.1\n\n4.9\n\n6.5\n\n55.9\n\n6.6\n\n5.4\n\n1.9:1\n\n53.1\n\n5.6\n\n4.6\n\n2.2:1\n\n61.7\n\n4.9\n\n2.7\n\n2.3:1\n\n63.7\n\n7.1\n\n1.9\n\n2.3:1\n\n66.3\n\n9.6\n\n1.35\n\n2.1:1\n\n1.1\n\n5.4\n\n1.6:1\n\n1.9:1\n\n12.4\n\n1.6:1\n\nDebt-Service Coverage\n\n0.8\n\nneg.\n\n1.4\n\n0.7\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\nneg. = negative, PGCB = Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, Ltd.\n\n64.\nThe  financial  projection  for  PGCB  is  based  on  the  principles  discussed  in  para.  63,\ntransfer  of  transmission  grid  from  BPDB,  and  investments  derived  from  this  Project.

New Company for West Zone Distribution\n\na. \n\nResponsibilities\n\nThe  new  company  will  be  a  limited-liability  company  registered  under  the  Companies\u2019\n65.\nAct, 1994. It\u2019s memorandum of association will give it a wide-ranging mandate to be involved in\na  multitude  of  activities,  not  only  in  electricity  but  in  any  infrastructure  project,  both  in\nBangladesh  and  abroad.  However,  the  company\u2019s  primary  responsibility  will  be  to  distribute\nelectricity in the metropolitan areas of Khulna, Barisal, Kushtia, Jessore, and Faridpur, and other\nmajor towns in the west zone.\n\nb. \n\nOrganization Structure\n\n66.\nThe  new  company  will  be  governed  by  a  part-time  board  of  directors  elected  by  its\nshareholders, who in turn will appoint a full-time managing director and two functional directors\n\n\f19\n\n(finance director and technical director). The chairperson of BPDB will be the chairperson of the\nboard  of  directors  of  the  company  as  long  as  BPDB  holds  a  majority  interest.  For  the\nconstruction  and  supervision  of  part  B  of  the  Project,  the  new  company  is  expected  to  recruit\nabout 20 engineers and about 100 other technical and nontechnical support staff. This will be in\naddition to the 10 or 20 professional and support staff at the corporate office in Khulna to handle\nprocurement, and financial and administrative matters. While most of the staff will be recruited\nfrom BPDB, DESA, and REB on a selection basis, some will be recruited from the open market.\nOperation and maintenance (O&M) staff will be transferred from BPDB\u2019s staff in the distribution\nsubsector.\n\nc. \n\nFinancial Performance\n\nThe  financial  projections  for  the  new  distribution  company  are  summarized  in  Table  6\n67.\nand  detailed  in  Appendix  7.  These  projections  are  based  on  a  phased  transfer  of  assets  from\nBPDB  to  the  new  company  over  five  years  ending  in  FY2007.  This  transfer  process  could  be\naccelerated  if  DFID  decides  to  provide  assistance  to  the  company  for  comprehensive\norganization  development.  The  analysis  also  assumes  that  the  new  company  starts  off  with  a\nclean balance sheet and BPDB\u2019s assets will be gradually transferred to it in parallel with the new\nexpansion investments under the Project. It is expected that system losses will be reduced from\nthe current level of 26 percent to about 18 percent by FY2008, further increasing the profitability\nof the company.\n\nTable 6: Summary of the New West Zone Company\u2019s Projected Financial Performance,\nFY2001-FY2008\n(Tk million)\n\nItem\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\nNo. of Customers\n\n147,246\n\n154,608\n\n160,793\n\n165,616\n\n190,459\n\n247,597\n\n321,875\n\n418,438\n\n823,850\n\n827,527\n\n907,522\n\n977,432\n\n1,044,328\n\n1,247,994\n\n1,651,625\n\n2,185,875\n\n2,495.1\n\n2,613.7\n\n2,997.7\n\n3,376.4\n\n3,754.4\n\n4,659.6\n\n6,431.1\n\n8,882.5\n\n(35.6)\n\n(6.2)\n\n(6.0)\n\n45.2\n\n185.4\n\n283.8\n\n330.1\n\n700.0\n\n2,879.0\n\n2,990.5\n\n4,212.1\n\n5,572.3\n\n6,803.6\n\n7,867.0\n\n8,558.9\n\n9,612.0\n\n680.2\n\n759.3\n\n865.1\n\n1,261.3\n\n1,835.1\n\n2,400.6\n\n1,622.6\n\n2,526.5\n\n3,209.5\n\n3,459.1\n\n3,247.1\n\n3,035.1\n\nEquity\n\n1,526.3\n\n1,603.8\n\n1,909.3\n\n2,286.5\n\n2,728.9\n\n3,146.6\n\n3,476.7\n\n4,176.3\n\nRate of Return on Average\n\n(4.7)\n\n(0.4)\n\n(0.3)\n\n9.7\n\n10.0\n\n18.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.7\n\n0.7\n\n45.3\n\n(0.9)\n\n2.9\n\n1.5\n\n2.2\n\n0.6\n\n41.3\n\n10.2\n\n8.6\n\n3.4\n\n7.4\n\n0.8\n\n40.1\n\n10.5\n\n10.0\n\n4.1%\n\n12.1\n\n6.1\n\n15.5\n\n9.4\n\n1.1\n\n40.0\n\n33.2\n\n1.1\n\n40.6\n\n2.9\n\n1.4\n\n43.5\n\n3.8\n\nSales (MWh)\n\nTotal Revenue\n\nNet Profit\n\nTotal Assets\n\nCurrent Liabilities\n\nLong-Term Liabilities\n\nOperating Margin (%)\n\nRate of Return on Total\n\n     Assets  (%)\n\n     Equity (%)\n\nCurrent Ratio\n\nEquity Ratio (%)\n\nDebt-Service Coverage\n\n     Ratio (times)\n\nMWh = megawatt-hours.\n\n750.2\n\n602.5\n\n(0.3)\n\n0.1\n\n583.8\n\n803.0\n\n0.2\n\n1.0\n\n0.9\n\n53.0\n\n(27.0)\n\n0.8\n\n53.6\n\n(4.5)\n\n\f20\n\nThe  financial  projection  for  the  new  company  is  based  on  the  handover  of  147,000\n68.\ncustomers  and  a  load  of  824  gigawatt-hours  (GWh)  in  five  cities  from  BPDB,  as  well  as  the\neffects of the investments derived from the Project. With the net value of the transferred assets\nbeing financed as loans and equity in the ratio of 70:30, the expected improvements in losses,\nand  the  major  increase  in  number  of  customer  and  load,  the  projections  indicate  a  robust\nperformance.  The  expected  increase  in  number  of  customers  and  energy  sales  during  the\nproject  implementation  period  are  271,000  customers  and  1,362  GWh,  (an  increase  of\n284 percent and 339 percent, respectively).  The operating margin gradually increases from 0 to\nroughly 15 percent over seven years along with the decrease in losses and increased load. The\nreturn  on  total  assets  also  improves  from  0  to  9  percent  based  on  the  same  factors  and  the\ndeclining new investments later in the period. The financing of the transferred assets gives the\ncompany  a  very  solid  foundation,  which  is  indicated  by  an  equity  ratio  of  around  40  percent.\nThis solid foundation will give good opportunities for external financing of future expansions as a\nself-sustainable and independent company.\n\n3.  Rural Electrification Board/Palli Bidyut Samities\n\na. \n\nResponsibilities\n\n69.\nREB is an infrastructure development agency of the Government. It was created as an\nautonomous  entity  under  a  presidential  ordinance  in  1977,  to  implement  the  electrification\nprogram through consumer cooperatives, the PBSs. The creation of this autonomous body was\none  of  the  recommendations  of  the  consulting  firms  that  conducted  feasibility  studies  for  the\nGovernment\u2019s Rural Electrification Program in 1977, which was financed by USAID.\n\n70.\nAs  stated  in  its  charter,  the  major  functions  of  REB  are  to  (i)  establish  electricity\ngeneration, transmission, and distribution systems in the rural areas of Bangladesh; (ii) organize\nprospective  consumers  of  electricity  into  formal  and  informal  groups  such  as  societies  and\ncompanies;  (iii)  formulate  by-laws  for  the  PBSs  and  other  groups  registered  with  REB,  and\ndetermine  the  methods  of  their  operations;  (iv)  advance  funds  for  implementing  approved\nschemes,  operating  and  managing  works  and  services,  and  constructing  lines  for  electric\nconnections  for  members;  (v)  hand  over  to  the  PBSs  the  completed  projects  for  O&M  and\nmanagement; (vi) train personnel in the management and operation of REB and PBSs; and (vii)\ndevelop  standards  for  work,  equipment,  O&M,  procurement  and  warehousing,  personnel  and\nfiscal administration, and other aspects of management to be followed by REB as well as by the\nPBSs and other groups registered with REB.\n\n71.\nCurrently, 67 PBSs serve about 1.5 million consumers and distribute about 26 percent of\nthe electricity consumed in the country. The responsibilities of a PBS begins when a distribution\nscheme  is  handed  over  to  it  for  O&M  after  construction  and  commissioning.  Its  principal\nobjective is to supply its members and other consumers with electricity. Its functions include (i)\ndistributing  electricity  and  providing  consumer  connections;  (ii)  meter  reading,  billing,  and\ncollection; (iii) purchasing electricity from BPDB and DESA; and (iv) planning and implementing\nthe  expansion  of  local  distribution  systems  with  REB\u2019s  financial  and  technical  assistance  to\nconsumers  for  wiring  their  premises,  acquiring  and  installing  electrical  appliances,  and\nimproving their power factors through the installation of capacitors.\n\nb. \n\nOrganizational Structure\n\n72.\nREB  is  managed  by  a  board  consisting  of  a  chairperson  and  four  full-time  board\nmembers (finance, engineering, administration, and PBSs and training). To coordinate the rural\n\n\f21\n\nelectrification  program  in  their  respective  fields,  four  part-time  board  members,  one  each  from\nBPDB,  Bangladesh  Agricultural  Development  Corporation,  Bangladesh  Small  and  Cottage\nIndustries Corporation, and Bangladesh Rural Development Board serve on the board.\n\nEach  PBS  is  a  member-owned  autonomous  cooperative,  distributing  electricity  in  its\n73.\nservice area. The initial board of directors of a PBS is selected from local citizens, subject to the\napproval of REB\u2019s board of directors. After their appointment, the directors register the PBS with\nREB, which then proceeds to encourage potential consumers to become members of the PBS.\nThe  PBS  board  consists  of  10-15  members  elected  in  an  annual  members\u2019  meeting.  Persons\nare  to become or remain a director if they are bona fide members of a PBS and residents of its\nservice  area.  Any  person  or  organization  in  a  PBSs  area  may  become  a  member  of  the  PBS\nfollowing acceptance by the board and payment of a membership application fee of Tk10. The\nboard elects a president who functions as its chief representative officer.\n\nc.\n\nFinancial Performance\n\n74.\nThe ultimate owners and operator of the REB-implemented component of the Project will\nbe  the  eight  PBSs  which  are  receiving  assistance  from  the  Project:  Jessore-1,  Jessore-2,\nBarisal-1, Barisal-2, Kushtia, Bagherhat, Faridpur and Meherpur. In order to assess the financial\nposition  and  performance  for  part  C,  the  financial  statements  for  the  eight  PBSs  were\nconsolidated  and  projections  based  on  the  consolidated  position.  A  summary  of  the  financial\nprojection  and  indicators  for  the  eight  involved  PBSs  are  presented  in  Table  7.  The  detailed\nprojected  financial  statements  and  major  assumptions  used  for  the  financial  projections  are  in\nAppendix 7.\n\nTable 7: Summary of the Consolidated 8 PBS\u2019s Projected Financial Performance,\nFY2001-FY2008\n(Tk million)\n\nItem\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\nNo. of Customers\n\n391,276\n\n410,840\n\n427,273\n\n440,092\n\n484,101\n\n629,331\n\n818,130\n\n981,756\n\nSales (MWh)\n\nTotal Revenue\n\nNet Profit\n\nTotal Assets\n\n256,064\n\n282,311\n\n305,347\n\n323,943\n\n367,027\n\n486,678\n\n645,335\n\n782,146\n\n894.6\n\n1,026.5\n\n1,156.8\n\n1,279.7\n\n1,509.0\n\n2,075.1\n\n2,858.8\n\n3,609.6\n\n(111.9)\n\n(146.8)\n\n(132.5)\n\n(97.7)\n\n(57.3)\n\n(96.6)\n\n7.4\n\n168.9\n\n5,244.5\n\n5,460.6\n\n6,576.8\n\n7,801.7\n\n8,704.8\n\n9,247.8\n\n9,224.8\n\n9,382.9\n\nCurrent Liabilities\n\n759.1\n\n805.6\n\n823.1\n\n829.1\n\n865.3\n\n1,025.3\n\n1,092.7\n\n1,179.7\n\nLong-Term Liabilities\n\n4,344.3\n\n4,561.1\n\n5,472.8\n\n6,452.9\n\n7,138.9\n\n7,489.4\n\n7,391,7\n\n7,293.9\n\nEquity\n\n(32.3)\n\n154.6\n\n393.4\n\n574.3\n\n606.7\n\n614.0\n\n782.9\n\nRate of Return on Average\n\nneg.\n\nneg.\n\nneg.\n\nneg.\n\nneg.\n\nneg.\n\n1.2\n\n24.2\n\nOperating Margin (%)\n\nRate of Return on Total\n\n     Assets  (%)\n\n     Equity (%)\n\nCurrent Ratio\n\nEquity Ratio (%)\n\nDebt Service Coverage\n\n     Ratio (times)\n\n14.8\n\n(1.8)\n\n(0.4)\n\n0.5\n\n0.3\n\n0.7\n\nMWh = megawatt-hours, neg. = negative.\n\n(5.0)\n\n(1.1)\n\n(3.3)\n\n(0.7)\n\n(0.2)\n\n(0.2)\n\n0.4\n\n(0.6)\n\n0.7\n\n0.5\n\n2.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n5.0\n\n0.6\n\n2.5\n\n0.3\n\n0.7\n\n6.6\n\n0.8\n\n(0.1)\n\n(0.2)\n\n0.8\n\n6.6\n\n1.0\n\n4.7\n\n1.2\n\n0.8\n\n6.7\n\n1.3\n\n8.3\n\n2.9\n\n0.9\n\n8.3\n\n1.9\n\n\f22\n\n75.\nThe  PBSs  have  the  authority  to  set  retail  tariffs  except  agriculture  tariffs,  which  are\nestablished  by  the  Government.  PBS  tariffs  tend  to  be  sufficient  to  cover  all  operating  costs,\ndebt-service obligations with the expected increased energy load, an adequate return on equity\ncan be expected in the long run. The earnings of the PBSs are nontaxable and the PBSs do not\nbear foreign exchange risks. Surplus cash and reserves are invested in expansion and technical\nimprovement  projects.  In  general,  the  PBSs  already  perform  better  than  BPDB.  Their  system\nlosses,  on  the  average,  are  about  18  percent,  which  will  decrease  to  about  15  percent  by\nFY2007.  Considering  the  investments  financed  by  the  Project,  the  expected  increase  in\ncustomers  (590,000)  and  energy  load  (526  GWh)  will  be  about  250  percent  and  300  percent,\nrespectively,  during  the  implementation  period.  In  general,  due  to  the  lower  load  per  invested\ntaka,  the  PBSs  have  a  weaker  financial  position  than  the  more  dense  urban  distribution\nnetworks. It will take 7-8 years until the PBSs reach reasonable return on equity and another 7\nyears to reach an adequate equity ratio of roughly 30 percent to bring them to a self-sustainable\nand independent status.\n\nH. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1. \n\nEnvironment\n\nThe Project has been classified in environment category B requiring a summary of the\n76.\ninitial environmental examination to be attached to this Report. From the information supplied by\nPGCB,  there  appears  to  be  no  deleterious  environmental  impact  that  cannot  be  mitigated.\nPGCB conducted an initial environmental examination of the 230 kV and 132 kV transmission\nlines  and  substations  in  part  A  of  the  Project,  including  an  initial  social  assessment,.  Other\nproject  components  have  negligible  impact  on  the  environment.  A  summary  of  the  Mission\u2019s\nenvironmental  assessment  is  given  in  Appendix  8.  The  appendix  also  details  the  principles  of\nland acquisition and routing of transmission lines that will be followed to minimize environmental\nand social impact, and the principles of compensation that will be applied to persons affected by\nthe Project.\n\n77.\nPGCB  will  acquire  about  23.6  hectares  for  the  new  230  kV  substations  at  Bogra,\nBaghabari, and Khulna, and the switching station at Serajganj. The identified sites, other than\nthose  at  Bogra,  are  low-lying  and  get  flooded  every  year.  Hence  they  support  few  permanent\npopulation  or  structures.  At  Baghabari  and  Khulna,  it  will  be  necessary  to  demolish  one\nhomestead and resettle the occupant families. At Bogra, though the land is good for agriculture\nand  supports  three  crops  a  year,  there  are  no  permanent  settlements  or  structures.  For  the\nswitching station at Serajganj, land developed by the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Authority will\nbe used and land acquisition will not be necessary. Few trees need cutting at all the identified\nsites. In addition to land for the substations, PGCB will also need to acquire right-of-way for the\ntransmission  lines  that  will  be  constructed.  The  Mission  observed  that  the  transmission  lines\nwere  proposed  to  be  routed  through  paddy  fields  where  tree  cutting  is  not  necessary.  The\ntemporary disruption of agriculture (during line construction only) can easily be mitigated.\n\n2. \n\nSocial Analysis\n\n78.\nADB missions have discussed project components in detail with the management as well\nas  the  staff  of  BPDB  and  REB/PBSs  who,  in  turn,  have  briefed  their  members.  ADB  missions\nhave  also  discussed  the  elements  of  the  Project  with  potential  beneficiaries,  such  as  the\nFederation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry, several industrialists, as well as\na few residential and commercial consumers at Khulna. The beneficiaries are aware of the Project\n\n\f23\n\nand  support  the  power  sector  reforms  now  being  implemented.    The  staff  of  the  power  sector\norganizations  support  the  project,  but  some  have  reservations  regarding  the  restructuring  and\ncorporatization activities.\n\nThe  Project  will  not  necessitate  major  relocation  of  persons.  Only  about  63  landowners\n79.\nwhose land will be acquired for the four substations may be permanently affected. A resettlement\nplan has been prepared based on ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement (November 1995) and\nconsistent with laws, regulations, and practices of Bangladesh. Minor rerouting of the transmission\nlines, to be considered during project implementation, will further reduce the number of affected\npersons. ADB\u2019s review missions will closely monitor implementation of the plan for compensation\nand resettlement.\n\n3.\n\nProject Performance Monitoring\n\n80.\nProject  performance  monitoring  will  be  done  by  BPDB,  PGCB,  and  REB,  and  will  be\nreviewed  by  ADB  missions  as  part  of  the  supervision  work.  This  will  include  verifying  of  (i)  the\nnumber of additional connections provided, (ii) the consumer categories of the new connections,\nand  (iii)  the  improvements  in  service  for  the  existing  consumers  in  the  project  area.  Institutional\nparameters  such  as  accounts  receivable,  accounts  payable,  and  systems  losses  will  also  be\nevaluated.\n\nI. \n\nTechnical Assistance25\n\n81.\nThe  distribution  operations  of  BPDB  are  organized  into  four  zones:    central  zone,  east\nzone, west zone, and north zone. With a view to improving operating efficiencies of these zones\nas  well  as  their  consumer  orientation,  BPDB  intends  to  reorganize  its  distribution  systems  in\nthese zones and introduce modern management systems. As part of this effort, BPDB wishes to\norganize  each  zone  as  a  separate  company,  governed  by  its  own  board  of  directors,  and\nmanaged  independently.  The  first  zone  to  be  corporatized  will  be  the  west  zone,  with  its\nheadquarters  at  Khulna.  In  this  context  the  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  TA  to\nBPDB and the new company  for  west zone distribution to conduct studies necessary to effect\nthe corporatization of BPDB\u2019s western zone, as well as develop systems for efficient O&M.\n\n1. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n82.\nThe TA will assist the Government and BPDB to (i) corporatize BPDB\u2019s distribution in the\nwest  zone,  (ii) introduce  modern  management  systems  in  the  new  company,  (iii)   advise  the\nnew  company  on  modernizing  and  upgrading  the  power  network  of  Khulna  City,  and  (iv)\nestablish  quality  assurance  practices  in  the  new  company  for  its  efficient  operation.  Outline\nterms of reference are in Appendix 9.\n\n2. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan\n\n83.\nThe total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,250,000 equivalent, comprising $765,000 in\nforeign exchange costs and $485,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will finance, on a\ngrant  basis  from  the  ADB-funded  TA  Program,  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs  and  $135,000\nequivalent  of  the  local  currency  costs  for  a  total  of  $900,000.  The  remaining  $350,000  will  be\nprovided  by  the  Government  and  BPDB  in  kind,  to  cover  costs  of  office  accommodation,\n\n25  This TA will be withdrawn if DFID provides support for a comprehensive organization development.\n\n                  \n\n\f24\n\ntransport, salaries of counterpart staff, administrative support, and contingencies. A detailed cost\nestimate is in Appendix 10.\n\n3. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n84.\nThe TA will require about 22 person-months of input of an international consulting firm or\nutility  with  expertise  in  management  systems,  engineering,  O&M  of  distribution  systems,  legal\ndrafting  of  power  purchase  agreements,  and  cost  accounting.  The  international  consulting\nservices will be supported by 20 person-months of domestic consultants in the areas of  asset\nvaluation,  computerization  of  information  systems,  human  resources  management  (especially\nbeneficiary consultations), and legal aspects. The international consulting firm will be selected in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, and will be responsible to ADB for\nthe  total  scope  of  the  work.  The  consultant  will  be  requested  to  submit  a  simplified  technical\nproposal.\n \n85.\nBPDB and the new company for West Zone distribution will be the EAs for the TA. For\nsmooth  implementation  of  the  study  and  to  facilitate  transfer  of  knowledge,  a  task  force  with\nsuitably  qualified  and  experienced  staff  and  facilities  will  be  set  up  before  the  consultants  are\nfielded.  BPDB  and  the  new  company  will  provide,  free  of  charge  to  the  consultant\u2019s  team,\n(i) office  accommodation  and  facilities,26  and  (ii)  transport  within  Bangladesh.  BPDB  and  the\nnew company will assist the consultants in gathering data, preliminary analysis, and writing the\nreport. The entire work, including writing the report, will be done in Bangladesh, thus maximizing\ntransfer  of  knowledge  to  Bangladeshi  managers,  engineers,  accountants,  and  other  staff.  The\nconsulting  firm  will  make  its  own  arrangements  for  personal  computers  and  other  facilities  for\nproducing its reports.\n\nV. \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA. \n\nProject Basis\n\n86.\nAs part of its private power generation policy adopted in October 1996, the Government\nhas invited private sector investment to increase generation capacity in Bangladesh. Proposals\nhave been solicited for about 1,400 MW of generating capacity on a BOO basis. This capacity is\nexpected to be available within the next five years. In addition, 320 MW generation capacity is\nunder construction or commissioning in the public sector.\n\nAlmost  all  incremental  base  load  generation  is  thus  expected  to  come  from  IPPs.\n87.\nConsequently, to allow evacuation of power from the new plants, complementary investments in\ntransmission  and  distribution  facilities  are  required.  The  Project  provides  for  these  matching\nfacilities.  The  Project  also  provides  one  more  interconnection  to  the  east  zone,  improving\noptimization of generation sources. Appendix 11 presents the consumer connection summary,\nwhich was used as the basis for the financial and economic analyses of the Project.\n\nB. \n\nFinancial Analysis\n\n88.\nThe financial evaluation of the Project (Appendix 12) was undertaken as three separate\nbusiness  cases  and  in  real  terms  using  constant  2001  prices.  Project  cost  estimates  and\nfinancial projections in nominal terms were converted to real terms by adjusting for the projected\n\n                  \n\n26 Facilities, such as computer hardware, software and services for implementing financial management, billing and\n\nconsumer accounting systems will be purchased under the proposed ADB loan.\n\n\f25\n\neffects  of  foreign  and  domestic  inflation  and  currency  fluctuations.  Incremental  costs  and\nbenefits  were  derived  by  evaluating  the  financial  position  of  the  EAs  under  with-  and  without-\nProject scenarios.\n\nThe  weighted  average  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  for  Part  A  (PGCB),\n89.\ncomputed  on  an  after-tax  basis,  is  6.6  percent.  This  compares  favorably  with  the  weighted\naverage cost of capital (WACC), also computed on an after-tax basis, of 4.0 percent. Part A of\nthe  Project  is  considered  both  financially  viable  and  sustainable.  Sensitivity  analysis  indicates\nthat the weighted average FIRR is robust under adverse conditions.\n\n90.\nFor  Part  B  (the  new  company)  financial  analysis  is  based  on  input  data  provided  by\nBPDB regarding the expected transfer of assets, customers, and load for the involved five cities.\nThe  FIRR  for  part  B,  conservatively  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis,  is  10.0  percent,  which\ncompares  favorably  with  the  WACC  of  2.8  percent,  also  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis.\nDecreased system losses beyond those assumed are expected to bring higher returns since the\naverage  improvement  assumed  is  from  the  current  26  percent  to  the  projected  18  percent  by\nFY2008.\n\n91.\nThe weighted average FIRR for Part C (upgrade of eight PBSs), computed on an after-\ntax basis, is 5.9 percent. This slightly lower FIRR is, as earlier mentioned, caused by the lower\nload  and  less  dense  consumer  base  per  invested  amount  in  fixed  assets.  Still,  it  compares\nfavorably  with  the  WACC,  also  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis,  of  less  than  0  percent  in  real\nterms  because  of  subsidized  low  interest  rates  from  the  Government  to  REB/PBSs.    The\ninvolved  PBSs  are  expected  to  develop,  financially  as  well  as  operationally,  in  a  very  positive\ndirection  as  a  result  of  this  Project  and  after  some  years  become  sustainable  and  viable\nindependent entities capable of financing their own expansion.\n\nThe FIRR analysis is summarized in Table 8, and the WACC analysis is summarized in\n\n92.\nTable 9.\n\nTable 8: Summary of Financial Internal Rate of Return Analysis\n(percent)\n\nPart A\n\nPart B\n\nPart C\n\nCase\n\nBase Case\n\nRevenues Decrease by 10%\n\nOperating Expenses\n Increase by 10%\n\nOne-year Construction Delay\n with a 10% Cost Overrun\n\nneg. = negative.\n\nCase\n\nBase Case\n\nOne-year Construction Delay\n with a 10% Cost Overrun\n\n6.6\n\n4.8\n\n6.2\n\n4.3\n\n3.96\n\n4.27\n\n10.0\n\nneg.\n\nneg.\n\n7.2\n\n5.9\n\n0.2\n\n1.8\n\n3.2\n\n2.84\n\n3.26\n\n<0\n\n<0\n\nTable 9: Summary of Weighted Average Cost of Capital Analysis\n(percent)\n\nPart A\n\nPart B\n\nPart C\n\n\f26\n\nC. \n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n1. \n\nEconomic Rationale for the Project\n\n93.\nThe  greater  Dhaka  area  has  the  highest  commercial  and  political  importance  to\nBangladesh.  Thus,  infrastructure  and  other  investments  have  tended  to  focus  on  it.  As  a\nconsequence, the area has shown considerable improvement in its physical infrastructure, while\nother  regions  of  the  country,  which  have  not  been  able  to  attract  aid  or  private  sector  capital,\nhave been falling behind. However, increasing the connections in predominantly rural areas is\nnot feasible until the entire supply chain comprising the generation and transmission facilities is\naugmented.  Bangladesh  has  made  good  progress  in  promoting  private  sector  investment  in\ngeneration  facilities  while  the  public  sector  has  continued  to  establish  transmission  and\ndistribution  lines  to  help  evacuate  and  utilize  the  privately  generated  power.  This  successful\nmodel will now be applied to west Bangladesh, a relatively poor area of the country, with a view\nto the correct existing imbalance of physical infrastructure, electrification rate, and overall social\nand economic development in the country.\n\n94.\nStudies in Bangladesh have shown the crucial contribution of the power sector to social\nand economic development and, ultimately, poverty reduction. Power is an essential ingredient\nfor increasing economic growth, for improving the quality of life of consumers, and for creating\nemployment opportunities, especially in the rural areas. Given that only about 20 percent of the\npopulation in Bangladesh has access to electricity, this means that the electrification program in\nthe  smaller  towns  and  villages  should  be  accelerated  to  increase  the  population's  access  to\nelectricity and to reap the benefits offered by good quality power supply.\n\n95.\nThe  multiplier  effect  that  the  use  of  electricity  can  have  on  the  local  economy  was\nemphasized by the findings of a USAID-funded comprehensive field study carried out in 1996 to\ninvestigate  the  economic  and  social  impact  of  the  rural  electrification  programs  implemented\nthrough the PBS.27 A general finding of that study was that the creation of PBSs caused local\nmarkets  to  expand  and  gave  rise  to  a  new  class  of  entrepreneurs.  Since  the  launch  of  the\nprogram,  6,000 direct  jobs  have  been created in PBSs and REB. Once the PBSs mature and\nthe  industries  became  more  established,  use  of  local  raw  material  also  increased,  thereby\nestablishing a support economy that helps local employment and increases cash income. This\nhas resulted in the creation of about 20,000 indirect jobs at various industries and shops, which\nhad  opened  in  response  to  the  demands  created  by  the  program.  The  establishment  of\nindustries  as  a  result  of  electrification,  their  growth,  and  the  creation  of  a  support  industry  for\nindustrial  inputs  have  another  beneficial  aspect  on  the  local  economy  \u2013  the  gradual\ndevelopment of local demand markets.\n\n2. \n\nProject Costs in Economic Prices\n\n96.\nThe  economic  analysis  was  carried  out  at  border  price  level  using  2001  prices.  To\nconvert  financial  capital  costs  to  economic  costs,  taxes  and  duties  were  deducted.  No  price\ncontingencies  are  included  in  the  base  capital  costs.  However,  the  economic  capital  costs\ninclude  5  percent  physical  contingencies.  The  costs  have  been  separated  into  foreign\nexchange,  indirect  foreign  exchange,  and  local  currency  cost.  Local  costs  were  further\nseparated  and  specific  conversion  factors  used  for  skilled  and  unskilled  labor.  The  remaining\n\n27  A  Socio-economic  Impact  Estimation  of  the  Rural  Electrification  Program  in  Bangladesh  carried  out  by  NRECA\n\n                  \n\nInternational Ltd.\n\n\f27\n\nlocal  costs  were  converted  to  border  prices  by  applying  a  standard  conversion  factor.  Annual\nmaintenance  and  operating  costs  were  also  calculated  in  economic  prices  as  a  percentage  of\nthe  total  investment  costs  for  each  component.  The  cost  of  energy  is  valued  at  the  LRMC\ngeneration level for IPP plants, since the Project will evacuate and utilize the incremental power\nproduced by the Baghabari and Bheramara IPP plants that are expected to become operational\nin  2004.  Transmission  and  distribution  losses  included  in  the  total  amount  of  energy  to  be\nimported  into  the  transmission  system  separately  for  BPDB  and  REB  distribution  investments.\nReduction in system losses is reflected progressively in the reduced need for energy import to\nserve the same level of consumption.\n\n3. \n\nProject Benefits in Economic Prices\n\nThe  economic  benefits  of  electricity  consumption  for  each  major  consumer  category\n97.\nwere calculated separately for BPDB and REB. Different proportions of consumer categories in\neach  PBS  were  taken  into  account  for  the  REB  benefit  calculation.  Customers  suffer  from\nfluctuating voltage levels and general poor quality of supply.  In addition to improving the quality\nand quantity of supply, the Project will provide for new connections, in both the urban and the\nrural  areas.  It  is  expected  that  when  load  shedding  is  completely  eliminated  and  reliable\nelectricity  supply  is  created,  the  purchase  of  more  sensitive  electrical  appliances  like\nrefrigerators  for  domestic  consumers  or  production  equipment  for  industries  will  increase.  The\neconomic  benefits  were  calculated  separately  for  the  new  consumers  and  the  incremental\nconsumption  of  existing  consumers  due  to  reduced  load  shedding  and  improved  quality  of\nsupply. Consumption of new consumers was valued at replacement cost, that is the alternative\neconomic  costs  of  other  energy  sources  such  as  captive  power  plants  for  industrial  users  or\nkerosene lamps for the domestic segment. Incremental, or induced, consumption was valued at\nthe  estimated  average  willingness  to  pay  for  electricity  based  on  the  weighted  average  of  the\nalternative  cost  of  providing  similar  energy-related  services  and  the  current  electricity  tariff  for\neach consumer category. The evaluation is described in more detail in Appendix 13, which also\nprovides the results of the sensitivity analysis.\n\n98.\nThe base case economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project was estimated at\n19.3  percent.  The  EIRR  was  calculated  for  a  20-year  period  including  a  5-year  construction\nperiod,  corresponding  to  the  estimated  useful  life  of  the  Project.  No  residual  value  was\nconsidered.\n\n4. \n\nMacroeconomic Effects\n\n99.\nThe  creation  of  new  sector  entities  should  instill  discipline  and  financial  viability  into  the\nsector.  Presently,  because  of  failure  to  manage  utilities  properly,  system  losses  and  accounts\nreceivable are excessive and drain the sector of about $80 million per year. This has meant that\nthe Government has been directly subsidizing the end users of electricity. In FY1995, Government\nloans  of  $345 million  to  BPDB  were  converted  to  equity.  This  meant  that  the  Government  had\nforegone the domestic mobilization of funds inherent in the onlending of development loans and\ngrants  to  the  sector.  In  DESA,  the  Government\u2019s  equity  of  $260  million  has  become  almost\nworthless because of operational losses incurred since its creation in FY1992.\n\n100.\nElectricity tariff did not increase during September 1991-September 1996 thus the price to\nconsumers  was  reduced  in  real  terms  and  creating  further  strain  on  the  sector,  whereas\ndebt-service  obligations,  fuel  prices,  and  operating  costs  had  risen.  ADB\u2019s  Ninth  Power  Project\naddressed this issue by increasing the average retail tariffs by 14.93 percent effective September-\nDecember 1996 and introducing of a formula for automatic adjustment for variations in key input\n\n\f28\n\ncosts.  The  Dhaka  Power  Systems  Upgrade  Project  and  the  Project  will  seek  to  further  the\nfinancial  consolidation  of  the  sector  by  rationalizing  the  tariff  regime  to  decrease  subsidies  to\nricher  PBSs  and  reducing  in  the  consumption  slab  for  the  \u201clifeline\u201d  tariff.  Efforts  to  remove  the\ndrain on the national exchequer and improve public financial management are essential to aid in\nmacroeconomic  management,  which  is  one  of  the  objectives  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  good\ngovernance.28\n\n101.\nThe Project is designed to bring electricity to west Bangladesh, especially the southwest\nregion. With the completion of the Rupsha and Paksey bridges now under construction with JBIC\nfunding, extension of the natural gas network to the region as part of ADB\u2019s next operation in the\ngas sector, and proximity to the Indian market, this region of Bangladesh could become the next\ngrowth center of the country if appropriate infrastructure facilities exist.\n\nD. \n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n102.\nThe  Project  is  designed  to  promote  economic  growth  by  increasing  access  to  electricity\nsupply  in  urban  and  rural  areas  in  southwestern  Bangladesh.  The  Project  will  provide  a  reliable\npower  supply  that  will  improve  the    chances  for  industrialization  and  thus  provide  employment\nopportunities. A reliable electricity supply will also enhance education, health, and security facilities\nthat exist in the area.\n\n103.\nAlthough the Project is essentially gender neutral, there are benefits that will be derived by\nwomen  as  a  result  of  electricity  supply;  education,  security,  and  more  comfortable  living.  With  the\nadvantage  of  better  lighting,  women  can  spend  their  spare  time  on  education  or  other  vocations.\nCommunity  televisions  in  the  villages  can  improve  general  knowledge  on  health,  hygiene,  and\nprevention of diseases. Street lighting will provide better security to women after dark.\n\n104.\nThe  domestic  tariff  structure  incorporates  a  lifeline  tariff  of  Tk2.00/kWh  ($0.04)  for  the  first\n300 kWh per month. This amount of energy is much higher than the electricity consumed for lighting\nand  by  one  or  two  fans,  which  is  considered  the  basic  minimum  for  electricity  consumption.\nTherefore, ADB has requested that this level be brought down to 50 kWh per month, which is the\nconsumption of a poor household. While increasing tariffs in the past, it was ensured that this lifeline\ntariff is affordable to the lower income groups. The Government is considering a proposal submitted\nby the Power Cell on this issue.\n\n105. No layoffs are envisaged as part of the Project, the overall reform process will, in the future,\nlead  to surpluses in  certain  categories of staff in BPDB and DESA. Such staff can be retrained in\nother skills for redeployment in REB, DESCO, and BPDB's successor organizations. Staff who are\nnot employable in the sector will be given compensation packages for separation. The power sector\nagencies, in association with ADB and other aid agencies, will conduct studies next year and evolve\nan appropriate scheme to mitigate the social impact of the reforms.\n\nE. \n\nImpact on Poverty\n\nThe  Project  does  not  directly  address  poverty  reduction  because  the  primary\n106.\nbeneficiaries  are  largely  the  industrial,  commercial,  and  domestic  consumers,  both  rural  and\nurban. This mix of consumers is important to safeguard the financial and economic viability of\nthe  Project.  However,  the  Project  yields  very  attractive  economic  returns  and  with  increasing\nemployment opportunities as a result of electrification, there will be benefits for the poor. Power\n\n                  \n28  R151-95: Governance: Sound Development Management.\n\n\f29\n\noutages affect the small businesses more than the larger ones - the small shopkeeper and the\nartisan, as well as the poorer residential consumers who cannot afford backup generators.\n\n107. Over the past three years, agriculture output in Bangladesh has considerably increased\ndue to one additional crop a year based on irrigation, using water from nearby rivers or shallow\ntube wells, drawn up using electric pumps. Without the spread of electricity, farmers would be\nforced to use diesel pumps, which are considerably more expensive to purchase and operate,\nand  hence  may  not  be  an  incentive  for  additional  cropping.  This  increased  agriculture  activity\nhas  provided  more  employment  opportunities,  both  on  and  off  the  farm.  With  increasing\nelectrification,  agroprocessing \nindustries  are  also  slowly  developing,  providing  more\nemployment.\n\n108. A  long-term  research  study  on  rural  poverty,29  published  in  1995,  covered  62  villages\nrepresenting  57  of  64  districts  in  Bangladesh.  One  article  compiled  in  the  book  analyzes  the\ndeterminants  of  poverty  and  their  relative  significance.  One  of  the  six  major  factors  identified,\nphysical  infrastructure,  was  defined  to  comprise  rural  electrification,  irrigation,  and  transport\nfacilities.\n\n109.\nThe  methodology  compared  electrified  with  nonelectrified  villages.  Poverty  incidence\nwas estimated for electrified villages and was then compared with that of villages without access\nto  electricity.  Poverty  was  substantially  reduced  with  the  spread  of  electrification.  Only  14\npercent  of  the  residents  in  electrified  villages  are  hard-core-poor  \u2013  defined  as  persons  whose\naggregate expenditure falls below the normative poverty line of 2,112 calories per day plus a 30\npercent allowance for nonfood basic needs \u2013 as compared with 31 percent for villages without\nelectricity. The matched figure for moderate poverty is 27 percent and 31 percent respectively.\nThe researchers concluded that the extremely poor benefit more from rural electrification than\nthe moderately poor.\n\nF. \n\nRisks\n\n110.\nThe success of the Project depends on the maintenance of tariffs to ensure the financial\nviability  of  the  sector  and  its  entities.  The  FIRR  and  EIRR  of  the  Project  were  tested  for\nsensitivities and have been found robust. To further mitigate the risk, (i) covenants were proposed\nto  ensure  the  financial  viability  of  PGCB,  Ashuganj  Power  Company,  and  the  new  west  zone\ndistribution  company,  in  the  short  term;  and  (ii) the  legal  framework  for  the  sector  is  being\nchanged  and  an  independent  regulatory  authority  is  being  established  for  the  long  term.  ADB\ngranted TA to the new regulatory authority to support its operationalization (footnote 8).\n\n29 Rahman, H.Z. and M. Hossain eds. 1995.

(PGCB)  in  part  A  is  a  limited-liability\n1.\ncompany  incorporated  under  the  Companies  Act  1994.  PGCB\u2019s  primary  role  is  to  own  and\noperate the country\u2019s transmission network and the National Load Dispatch Center. PGCB is in\nthe  process  of  receiving  assets  and  staff  from  the  Bangladesh  Power  Development  Board\n(BPDB), which is expected to be completed by September 2002.\n\n2.\nIn part B, the new company that will be created for the five district towns in the western\nregion of Bangladesh, will start up with a \u201cclean\u201d balance sheet as an independent corporation\nunder the Companies Act, 1994. During the Project period, it will gradually take the over assets,\ncustomers database, and energy load from BPDB. Apart from this transfer, the Project will then\nprovide financial resources for further investment in an expanded grid that will secure a major\nincrease of new connected customers.\n\n3.\nPart  C  involves  eight  rural  electric  cooperatives  or  Palli  Bidyut  Samities  (PBSs)  that\nsurround  the  five  district  towns  covered  by  Part  B.  These  PBSs  are  operated  locally  as  fully\nindependent cooperatives, but with extensive support from the government institution, the Rural\nElectrification  Board  (REB),  regarding  technical  and  financial  management,  procurement,  and\ngeneral business control. To avoid uneven development between the urban and the rural areas,\nthe  Project  will  provide  similar  resources  to  the  eight  PBSs,  aiming  for  the  same  targets  in\nachieving  improved  quality  of  supply  and  a  major  increase  of  new  connected  customers,  as\nwell.\n\nB.\n\nPast Financial Performance\n\nPGCB was incorporated in 1996 as a public limited company with an authorized capital\n4.\nof Tk10 billion and the paid up capital by the end of FY1999\u20132000 was Tk938.72 million. During\nFY1999\u20132000 the company became partially operational, taking over some grid substations and\ntransmission  lines  from  BPDB  and  already  from  the  start  earning  a  return  on  its  investments.\nFrom  the  start  the  company  had  operational  success  as  a  result  of  the  Power  Sector  Reform\nProgram  initiated  by  the  Government  of  Bangladesh.  PGCB  aims  to  become  an  efficient  grid\nmanager by acquiring the whole existing transmission system of the country, by establishing a\nnew  National  Load  Dispatch  Center,  and  by  constructing  new  transmission  lines  and\nsubstations  commensurate  with  generation  growth.  For  the  first  operational  FY1999-2000,\nPGCB had a turnover of Tk172.6 million and a net profit before Tax of Tk39.7 million. (Further\ndetails are in the audited annual report for FY1999\u20132000 in a supplementary appendix.)\n\nFor part B, BPDB will initially act as the Executing Agency (EA) but as soon as the new\n5.\ncompany  is  incorporated,  and  its  first  executive  management  appointed  according  to  the  loan\ncovenants, the newly created entity will be the actual EA for implementing the Project. The initial\noperation  of  the  company  will  be  based  on  assets,  customer  database,  and  energy  load  that\ngradually  will  be  transferred  from  BPDB.  As  the  available  information  regarding  this  specific\nportion of BPDB\u2019s operation has been very limited, it was not possible to present any complete\nhistorical  financial  performance  reports.  From  the  available  basic  information  \u2013  number  of\ncustomers, energy load, and losses \u2013 the focus has been on the financial analysis of the future\nprojection. The audited annual report of BPDB for FY1999-2000 is available as a supplementary\nappendix.\n\n\f51\n\nAppendix 7, page 2\n\nREB  will  be  the  formal  EA  for  part  C  being  the  supporting  umbrella  institution  to  the\n6.\noperational  PBSs.  As  REB  will  be  just  administratively,  and  not  financially  affected  by  the\nproposed project, no further financial analysis have been carried out for this entity. The audited\nannual reports for the last years are available as supplementary appendixes. The consolidated\nfinancial historical data for the eight PBSs is presented in the projection for FY2000. Due to a\nless  dense  customer  database  and  lower  load,  these  rural  PBSs  show  a  weaker  financial\nperformance.  Despite  a  much  more  efficient  operation  in  terms  of  general  management  and\nadministration and much lower losses than those of the urban distribution entities.\n\nC. \n\nFinancial Projections\n\n1. \n\nGeneral\n\n7.\nThe  effects  of  the  proposed  Project  on  the  financial  position  of  PGCB,  the  new  west\nzone  distribution  company,  and  the  eight  PBSs  have  been  reflected  in  the  projected  financial\nstatements.  Projections  were  prepared  on  a  nominal  basis,  based  on  major  assumptions\noutlined in the following paragraphs. The financial projections are in supplementary Appendix A.\n\nDomestic inflation rates were assumed to be 4.5 percent and international inflation rates\n\n8.\n2.4 percent throughout the projections from FY2001.\n\n2. \n\nPower Grid Company of Bangladesh (PGCB)\n\na. \n\nIncome Statement\n\n9.\nPGCB\u2019s  revenues  are  derived  from  transmission  of  electricity.  Transfer  of  transmission\nassets  from  BPDB  has  been  effected  gradually  since  October  1999  and  till  September  2002.\nFor the purpose of the financial projections, it was assumed that the transmission tariff will be\ncomputed following a full-cost-recovery methodology. An operation and maintenance provision\nwas assumed at 1.5 percent on average fixed asset balance and increased in line with domestic\ninflation.  In  addition,  depreciation,  foreign  exchange  losses,  and  taxes  were  covered  by  the\ntariff. It was also assumed that a gross margin on average historical fixed assets of 10 percent\nconstitutes a reasonable return.\n\n10.\nIt  is  assumed  that  PGCB\u2019s  operating  expenses  will  include  repairs  and  maintenance,\nmaterials  and  equipment,  salaries  and  wages,  contract  labor,  and  administrative  charges.\nFinancial  projections  are  based  on  actual  historical  figures  and  a  budget  prepared  by  the\ncompany.  Local  costs  are  projected  to  increase  in  line  with  domestic  inflation.  An  average\ndepreciation rate of 3 percent per annum is charged, on a declining balance basis, against the\nhistorical  value  of  fixed  assets.  The  transferred  assets  from  BPDB  are  computed  to  be\ntransferred at historical net value after depreciation.\n\n11.\nTogether  with  the  earlier  transfer  of  assets  from  BPDB,  PGCB\u2019s  current  debt  position\nwas analyzed, and from available information, an amortization schedule was prepared to project\nannual interest expenditure including existing as well as new loans. The company has assumed\na  debt  and  an  equity  portion  associated  with  assets  transferred  from  BPDB.  In  addition,  it  will\nfinance  future  capital  expansion  through  a  combination  of  equity,  domestic  and  international\ndebt, including supplier\u2019s credit. Interest expense for the project loan is computed on the basis\nof an ordinary capital resource (OCR) interest charge estimated at 4 percent per annum with a\nlocal mark-up of 1.5 percent per annum. Cofinancing by Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW) of\n\n\f52\n\nAppendix 7, page 3\n\nGermany and Nordic Development Fund (NDF) is computed at an interest rate of 0 percent and\na local markup of 5.5 percent.\n\n12.\n\nFor PGCB, income tax is computed at 40 percent of gross profits.\n\nb. \n\nBalance Sheet\n\nIt is assumed that PGCB will maintain its accounts receivables to within two months of\n\n13.\nbilling.\n\nIt  is  assumed  that  PGCB  will  maintain  an  inventory  balance  of  approximately  three\n\n14.\nmonths use of materials and spare parts.\n\nIt is assumed that accounts payable will comprise one month\u2019s repairs and maintenance,\n\n15.\ncontract fees, procurement, and administrative charges.\n\nCapital  expenditures  are  based  on  the  ongoing  capital  expenditure  and  expansion\n16.\nprograms  to  2006.  Financing  for  the  planned  expenditures  will  be  from  domestic  debt  and\nequity,  bilateral  assistance,  and  supplier  credit.  For  purposes  of  the  financial  projections,  it  is\nassumed that no further investment in capital assets will be made after 2006.\n\n17.\nPGCB\u2019s  existing  debt  position  was  analyzed  (para.  11)  and  from  available  information,\nan  amortization  schedule  was  prepared  to  project  annual  interest  expenditures,  foreign\nexchange  losses  and  debt-service  obligations.  It  is  assumed  that  the  project  loan  will  have  a\n5-year  grace  period  (to  coincide  with  the  construction  timetable)  and  a  15-year  repayment\nperiod.\n\n18.\nIt  is  assumed  that  PGCB\u2019s  share  capital  will  increase  due  to  partial  equity  financing  of\nassets transferred from BPDB to assure an initial accurate equity ratio of roughly 30 percent for\nthe company.\n\n19.\nIt  is  assumed  that  if  cash  balance  at  the  end  of  the  year  exceeds  the  coming  year\u2019s\ndebt-service requirements, then up to 50 percent of the balance can be distributed as dividends.\n\n3.\n\nWest Zone Electricity Distribution Company\n\na. \n\nIncome Statement\n\nIt  is  assumed  that  the  new  company  will  gradually  take  over  distribution  assets  and\n20.\ncustomer  database  from  BPDB,  starting  with  Khulna  town  by  2002.  The  remaining  towns  will\nfollow in 2003\u20132006 along with expansion investment from the Project that will be implemented\nduring  the  same  period  for  all  five  towns.  The  current  customer  database  is  expected  to\nincrease by 15 percent in 2004, and 30 percent annually in 2005\u20132007. The total increase will\nbe roughly 147,000-418,000 customers during the implementation period. The tariffs are based\non  current  tariffs  increased  by  the  Tk0.15  increase  (approximately  5  percent)  in  line  with  the\ncovenant  of  this  Project.  The  initial  average  tariff  is  computed  at  Tk3.106  per  kilowatt-hour\n(kWh) and will increase with the local inflation rate. Aside from the increase in new connected\ncustomers  and  in  tariffs,  the  sales  are  conservatively  computed  with  no  expected  increase  in\naverage consumption for all customer categories.\n\n\f53\n\nAppendix 7, page 4\n\nIt  is  assumed  that  the  new  company  will  continue  to  purchase  its  power  supply  from\n21.\nBPDB  at  current  price  plus  Tk0.08  as  its  share  of  the  expected  general  increase  in\nend-consumer  tariffs.  The  purchase  tariff  will  increase  with  local  inflation  as  well.  The  initial\npurchase  tariff  is  computed  to  be  Tk1.99  per  KWh.  The  amount  of  power  purchased  will  be  a\nfunction  of  consumer  demand  and  system  losses.  According  to  BPDB\u2019s  records,  the  current\ntechnical and nontechnical system losses, range from 25 percent to 35 percent for the involved\ntowns. These losses are expected to conservatively slowly decrease to almost the same level\nas for most of the PBSs, 18 percent compared with the PBSs 15 percent. These decreases in\nsystem  losses  will  raise  the  collection  ratio  from  today\u2019s  extremely  low  50  percent  to  the\nexpected 88 percent from 2010 onwards.\n\n22.\nOperating costs are computed based on the current actual costs provided by BPDB and\ninclude  operation  supervision,  engineering,  overhead  lines  and  meters,  customer  installations,\nand  consumer  accounts  expenditures.  Financial  projections  are  based  on  actual  historical\nfigures from FY1999-2000 and are computed as a weighted average cost per kWh purchased,\nassuming  these  are  fully  variable  costs.  This  weighted  average  cost  will  increase  with  the\ndomestic inflation rate.\n\n23.\nDistribution  maintenance  costs  are  based  on  current  actual  costs.  For  the  financial\nprojection, these costs were computed at 1.5 percent of the ending book value of gross assets\nuntil  the  end  of  the  construction  period,  and  will  increase  with  domestic  inflation  from  2007\nonward.\n\nBased on actual figures, the administrative and general expenditures including salaries\n\n24.\nand wages are assumed to increase with domestic inflation.\n\n25.\nThe  fixed  assets  are  based  on  transfer  of  assets  from  BPDB  at  net  book  value  after\ndepreciation  as  well  as  additional  investments  related  to  the  Project.  It  was  assumed  that  all\nassets will be depreciated on a declining balance basis at 3 percent per annum.\n\n26.\nThe  company  has  assumed  a  30  percent  debt  and  a  70  percent  equity  portion\nassociated  with  assets  transferred  from  BPDB  to  ensure  a  healthy  equity  ratio  from  the  start.\nFuture  capital  expansion  will  be  financed  through  a  combination  of  equity,  domestic  and\ninternational debt, as well as supplier\u2019s credit. The interest charges are estimated at 4 percent\nper annum with a local markup of 1.5 percent per annum on foreign exchange loans. Interest on\ndomestic loans are computed at the rate of 5.5 percent per annum.\n\nFor  the  new  west  zone  distribution  company,  income  tax  is  computed  at  40  percent  of\n\n27.\ngross profits.\n\nb. \n\nBalance Sheet\n\n28.\nThe current accounts receivable for the entire five regions of BPDB, which was the only\ninformation  available  as  of  June  2000,  on  average,  represent  roughly  14  months'  sales.  It  is\nassumed that as the new company gain operational experience, it will be able to reduce this, on\naverage, to 3 months by 2004-2005, and then to 2 months by 2006-2010, and to 1.5 months by\n2011  onward.  It  is  assumed  that  a  provision  for  doubtful  accounts  will  be  maintained  at  5\npercent of the total accounts receivable balance.\n\n\f54\n\nAppendix 7, page 5\n\nIt  is  assumed  that  the  new  distribution  company  will  maintain  a  stock  of  electrical\n29.\nmaterials  of  approximately  24  months  of  distribution  expenses  less  supervision  and  rent\ncharges.\n\nNo specific information on accounts payable was available for the five towns. However,\n30.\nbased  on  actual  figures  for  the  entire  BPDB,  it  is  assumed  that  ending  accounts  payable  will\nreflect  2  months  electricity  purchase  and  5  months  of  other  operating  expenses  less\ndepreciation.\n\n31.\nCapital  expenditures  are  based  on  the  transfer  of  assets  from  BPDB  and  from  the\ninvestments related to the Project. Financing for the planned expenditures will be from domestic\ndebt and equity, bilateral assistance, and supplier credit. The financial projections, assumed that\nno  further  investment  in  capital  assets  will  be  made  after  2006.  A  debt  and  amortization\nschedule  was  prepared  based  on  the  terms  for  these  specific  loans  to  project  annual  interest\nexpenditures, foreign exchange losses, and debt-service obligations.\n\nIt  is  assumed  that  the  new  distribution  company\u2019s  share  capital  due  to  partial  equity\n32.\nfinancing  of  assets  transferred  from  BPDB,  will  be  created  to  assure  an  accurate  initial  equity\nratio of roughly 40-45 percent for the company.\n\nIt is assumed that future surplus cash generated from the operation of the company will\n33.\nbe  invested  in  further  transfer  of  the  remaining  towns  in  the  western  zone  of  Bangladesh.  No\ndividends were considered during the projection period for the company.\n\n3. \n\nRural Electricity Board/Palli Bidyut Samities\n\na. \n\nIncome Statement\n\nThe  projection  is  based  on  a  consolidation  of  the  eight  involved  PBSs.  The  current\n34.\ncustomer database is expected to increase by 10 percent in 2004, 30 percent annually in 2005\nand  2006  and  by  20  percent  in  2007.  The  total  increase  will  be  roughly  410,000-980,000\ncustomers  during  the  implementation  period.  The  tariffs  are  computed,  based  on  current\naverage tariffs depending on the customer category mix for the involved PBSs in the range of\nTk3.08-Tk3.52 per kWh, and will increase with the local inflation rate. Aside from the increase in\nnew  connected  customers  and  in  tariffs,  the  sales  are  conservatively  not  computed  with  any\nexpected increase in average consumption for any of the customer categories.\n\n35.\nIt is assumed that the PBSs will continue to purchase their power supply from BPDB and\npartially from the new west zone distribution company at the current price, which will increase\nwith local inflation as well. The initial purchase tariff is computed to be Tk2.16 per kWh in 2002.\nThe  amount  of  power  purchased  will  be  a  function  of  consumer  demand  and  system  losses.\nCurrent  technical  and  nontechnical  losses  for  the  eight  PBSs  range  from  9.4  percent  to  17.7\npercent.  On  the  average,  these  losses  are  expected  to  gradually  decrease  to  15  percent  in\n2008, which is a marginal change to an already very good performance.\n\n36.\nOperating costs are computed based on the current actual costs for the eight PBSs and\ninclude  operation  supervision,  engineering,  overhead  lines  and  meters,  and  customer\ninstallations. Financial projections are based on actual historical figures from FY1999-2000 and\nare  computed  as  a  weighted  average  cost  per  kWh  purchased  (Tk0.092  per  kWh  in  2002),\nassuming these are fully variable costs. This weighted average cost will increase with domestic\ninflation.\n\n\f55\n\nAppendix 7, page 6\n\n37.\nDistribution  maintenance  costs  are  based  on  the  current  actual  costs  (0.68  percent  on\nfixed  assets  value  in  2000).  For  the  financial  projection,  these  costs  were  computed  to  0.75\npercent of the ending book value of gross assets until the end of the construction period and will\nincrease with domestic inflation from 2007 onward.\n\n38.\nConsumer  accounts  expenditures  comprising  supervision,  meter  reading,  customer\nrecords/collection, uncollectible accounts, and consumer assistance are based on actual costs.\nIt  is  assumed  that  these  average  costs  will  be  based  on  weighted  average  cost  per  customer\n(assuming these are fully variable costs) and that they will increase with domestic inflation. The\naverage cost is computed to be Tk166.00 per customer in 2002.\n\nBased on actual figures, the administrative and general expenditures, including salaries\n39.\nand wages, are assumed to be approximately Tk60 million per annum in 2001 and will increase\nwith domestic inflation.\n\nIt is assumed that all assets will be depreciated on a declining balance basis at 3 percent\n\n40.\nper annum.\n\n41.\nThe  current  debt  position  of  the  eight  PBSs  was  analyzed.  From  available  information,\nan amortization schedule was prepared to project annual interest expenditure including existing\nas  well  as  new  loans.  Interest  expense  for  the  Project  is  computed  on  the  basis  of  ADB\u2019s\nSpecial  Funds  resources  and  the  interest  charges  are  estimated  at  0.75  percent  per  annum\nduring  an  8-year  grace  period  and  at  2.0  percent  per  annum  during  the  remaining  years.  The\ndomestic loan is computed at the same interest rates as the international loan.\n\nGiven their cooperative status, the PBSs are exempt from paying the corporate income\n\n42.\ntax.\n\nb. \n\nBalance Sheet\n\n43.\nAccounts receivable for the eight PBSs, as of June 2000, ranged from 1.3 to 3.1 months.\nIt  is  assumed  that  they  will  be  gradually  reduced,  on  average  from  2.5  months  in  2002  to  2\nmonths  in  2003-2006,  and  to  1.5  months  in  2007  onward.  It  is  assumed  that  the  provision  for\ndoubtful accounts will be maintained at 5 percent of the total accounts receivable balance.\n\nIt is assumed that the PBSs on the average will maintain a stock of electrical materials of\n44.\napproximately 50 months of distribution expenses, less supervision and rent charges. This is a\nvery high and conservative assumption for an efficiently managed operation even if it is based\non the actual situation, and reflects partially the current difficulties in rapidly accessing reliable\nsupply of goods.\n\nUsing  historical  data,  the  accounts  payable  are  computed  as  1  month  of  electricity\n\n45.\npurchases and 3 months of other operating expenditures.\n\n46.\nThe PBSs existing debt position (para. 41) was analyzed and from available information,\nan amortization schedule was prepared to project annual interest expenditure and debt-service\nobligations.  It  is  assumed  that  the  loans  will  have  an  8-year-grace  period  and  a  24-year\nrepayment  period.  For  the  purposes  of  the  financial  projections,  it  is  assumed  that  no  further\ninvestment in capital assets will be made after 2006.\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 7, page 7\n\nThe  PBSs  have  a  cooperative  ownership  structure.  Rather  than  share  capital,  a\n47.\nmember\u2019s  equity  is  derived  from  the  member\u2019s  subscriptions.  The  entire  project  cost  will  be\npassed  on  from  REB  to  the  PBSs  as  a  loan,  denominated  in  taka,  and  with  concessionaire\nterms; therefore, no increase in member equity is projected.\n\nNo  dividends  for  the  PBSs  were  considered  in  the  computations  during  the  projection\n\n48.\nperiod.\n\n\f57\n\nAppendix 8, page 1\n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION\n\nA.\n\nDescription of the Environment\n\n1.\nThe  proposed  230  kilovolt  (kV)  substation  sites  at  Bogra,  Khulna,  Ishwardi,  and\nBaghabari  are  paddy  fields  occupied  by  a  63  households,  in  houses,  ranging  from  permanent\nbrick and cement structures to temporary corrugated sheet and mud structures. All sites except\nthose  at  Khulna  and  Bogra  substations,  get  flooded  during  the  monsoon  and  therefore  do  not\nsupport  permanent  settlements.  At  the  Bogra  site,  there  is  no  settlement  on  the  land  to  be\nacquired.  The  routes  leading  to  the  substations  are  low-lying  land  and  are  flooded  every  year\nduring the rains. During the dry season, the area is cultivated with paddy crops.\n\n2.\nThe  230  kV  transmission  lines  that  will  be  constructed  as  part  of  the  Project  pass\nthrough  typical  rural  Bangladesh  countryside,  for  a  total  length  of  about  450  kilometers  (km).\nWhile most of the proposed routes pass through open agricultural fields, the lines will traverse\nsome  river  used  for  inland  water  navigation,  and  some  clumps  of  trees  beside  some  human\nsettlements.  No  forest  areas  are  involved.  It  is  estimated  that  about  35  households,  will  be\naffected.\n\nB.\n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n\n3.\nPossible impacts include damage to crops, cutting of trees, demolition of buildings, and\ndisplacement of persons. These impacts were assessed as not significant and can be mitigated\nby  (i)  minimizing  such  impact  through  careful  routing  of  the  transmission  line,  and  (ii)  paying\nadequate  compensation.  The  number  of  persons  affected  will  be  reduced  through  a  proper\ndelineation of the sites and their transmission line approaches, as well as by modifying the route\nalignments. Compensation will be paid to all those to be affected.\n\n4.\n\nThe following guidelines for tower spotting will be observed:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\nThe  alignment  will  avoid,  without  exception,  known  wildlife  reserves,  closed  (or\nold  growth)  forests,  archaeological  sites,  religious  structures,  and  educational\ninstitutions.\n\nAs far as practicable, the alignment will avoid orchards and houses (permanent\nor temporary). In particularl, special care will be taken to avoid human settlement\nclusters.  Where  orchards  are  unavoidable,  the  ground  clearance  will  be\nincreased to at least 10 meters.\n\nWhere  road  or  river  crossing  is  unavoidable,  prescribed  vertical  and  horizontal\nclearance requirements will be strictly adhered to.\n\nThe proposed alignment will be submitted to at least the following authorities for\nreview:  Archaeological  Survey,  Wildlife  Conservation  Agency,  Inland  Water\nTransport  Authority,  and  Highways  Department.  If  no  substantive  reply  is\nreceived from these authorities within 30 days, it will be presumed that they have\nno objection.\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 8, page 2\n\n(v)\n\nCompensation  in  terms  of  country  and  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  norms\nwill be paid to owners of all property, including crops, orchard trees, homesteads,\nwater sources, etc. following prescribed procedures.\n\nBased on ADB\u2019s guidelines for land acquisition and resettlement, the following principles\n\n5.\nwere identified as applicable to the Project:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\n(vi)\n\nThe  principal  objective  of  involuntary  settlement  policies  is  to  ensure  that\npopulations affected by the Project should be at least as well off, as they would\nbe  without  the  Project,  if  not  better  off.  Affected  populations  should  be  able  to\nmaintain or preferably, improve their standard of living and quality of life.\n\nPeople  affected  by  the  Project  are  defined  as  those  who,  as  a  consequence  of\nthe Project, stand to lose all or part of physical and nonphysical assets, including\nhomes, homesteads, productive lands, commercial properties, tenancy, income-\nearning  opportunities,  social  and  cultural  activities  and  relationships,  and  other\nlosses  that  may  be  identified  during  resettlement  planning.  A  socioeconomic\nsurvey  to  be  carried  out  as  part  of  the  resettlement  planning  process,  will\nrepresent  the  cutoff  date  for  compensation  eligibility  for  physical  assets  as\nidentified during the survey. Affected populations will be involved in the process\nof  developing  and  implementing  the  resettlement  plans  through  the  process  of\nthe  socioeconomic  survey.  Affected  populations  will  receive  fair  (market-based\nreplacement  cost)  compensation \nincluding  physical  and\nfor  all \nnonphysical  assets.  Compensation  will  include  not  only  immediate  losses,  but\nalso  opportunities  forgone.  Affected  populations  that  stand  to  lose  only  part  of\ntheir  physical  assets  will  not  be  left  with  a  proportion  that  will  be  inadequate  to\nsustain their current standard of living, such a minimum size being identified and\nagreed upon during the resettlement planning process.\n\nlosses, \n\nAll  affected  populations  will  be  eligible  for  compensation  and  mitigative\nmeasures,  irrespective  of  tenurial  status,  social  or  economic  standing,  and  any\nsuch  factors  that  may  discriminate  against  achieving  the  objectives  mentioned\nabove.\n\nInvoluntary  resettlement  will  be  minimized  by  identifying  possible  alternative\nproject designs; and  appropriate social, economic, operational, and engineering\nsolutions  that  have  the  least  impact  on  populations  in  the  project  area.  A\nresettlement plan for the affected populations should identify among other things,\nthose  affected,  all  losses  that  might  be  incurred,  and  appropriate  mitigative\nmeasures.  The  plan  should  include  detailed  implementation  schedules  that  are\nalso  consistent  with  available  and  projected  budgetary  outlays  and  construction\nschedules.\n\nAdequate  budgetary  support  will  be  fully  committed  and  be  made  available  to\ncover the cost of land acquisition within the agreed upon implementation period.\n\nConstruction activities will not commence until the required lands have been fully\nacquired  and  populations  appropriately  relocated  in  accordance  with  the\nforegoing.\n\n\f59\n\nAppendix 8, page 3\n\n(vii)\n\nAppropriate  reporting,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  mechanisms  will  be  identified\nand  set  in  place  as  part  of  the  resettlement  management  system.  The\nresettlement process and the final outcome will be evaluated independent of the\nExecuting Agency.\n\nC.\n\nInstitutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program\n\nSince  the  impact  is  small,  the  environment  monitoring  program  will  be  limited  to  the\n6.\ncompensation to be paid to affected persons. This will be done by the Power Grid Company of\nBangladesh,  which  will  prepare  summary  reports  every  six  months,  to  be  verified  by  ADB\nmissions.\n\nD. \n\nResettlement Plan\n\nA Resettlement Plan, in accordance with ADB Guidelines of Resettlement and the laws\n\n7.\nof Bangladesh has been prepared and approved by the PGCB.\n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 9, page 1\n\nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\n\nA. \n\nScope of Work\n\n1.\nThe work is divided into two parts.

Part C (PBSs) is computed with an income tax rate of\n0 percent per annum.\n\n5.\nFor part B, the cost of Special Funds resources was calculated based on an interest rate\nof 4.0 percent per annum, a local markup of 1.5 percent per annum during the grace period and\nthereafter. For Part C, the cost of Special Funds resources was calculated based on an interest\nof 1.0 percent per annum, and with no markup during the grace period and thereafter with 1.5\npercent and 0.5 percent, respectively.\n\nOn this basis, and using an average outstanding loan balance per annum over the life of\n6.\nthe loan, the cost of total foreign debt in real terms was computed to be 2.17 percent for part A,\n0.07 percent for part B, and negative for part C.\n\nThe  costs  of  the  Government  debt  for  parts  A  and  B  were  calculated  based  on  an\n7.\ninterest  rate  of  5.5  percent  per  annum,  an  income  tax  rate  of  40  percent  per  annum,  and  an\naverage domestic inflation rate of 4.5 percent per annum. On this basis, and using an average\noutstanding loan balance per annum over the life of the loan, the cost of the Government debt in\nreal terms was computed to be 0.11 percent for part A and 0 percent for part B.\n\n8.\nThe cost of the Government debt for part C was calculated based on an interest rate of\n0.75 percent per annum for the first 8 years and 2.0 percent for the remaining years, an average\ndomestic  inflation  rate  of  4.5  percent  per  annum.  On  this  basis,  and  using  an  average\noutstanding loan balance per annum over the life of the loan, the cost of the Government debt,\nin real terms was computed to be even negative.\n\nThe  opportunity  of  equity  in  Bangladesh,  in  real  terms,  was  calculated  on  the  basis  of\n9.\ncurrent long-term savings rates (13 percent) adjusted by adding a risk premium of 3 percent per\nannum  and  taking  into  account  an  average  domestic  inflation  rate  of  4.5  percent  per  annum.\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 12, page 4\n\nThis interest rate is the same as the demanded rate of return for risk investments in the private\nsector.\n\nBased  on  the  above,  the  WACCs  were  estimated  to  be  3.96  percent  for  part  A,\n\n10.\n2.84 percent for part B, and negative for part C.\n\nC. \n\nConclusion\n\nThe  FIRR  is  expected  to  comfortably  exceed  the  WACC  for  each  project  component\n11.\n(both computed on an after-tax basis). Given the overall objectives of the Project, the financial\nperformance is deemed acceptable.\n\n\f69\n\nAppendix 13, page 1\n\nECONOMIC EVALUATION\n\nAn  economic  evaluation  of \n\n1.\ntransmission  and  distribution\ninvestments  was  undertaken.  Details  of  the  Economic  Internal  Rate  of  Return  (EIRR)\ncalculations are in Table A13.1 and the sensitivity analysis are given in Table A13.2.\n\nthe  Project\u2019s \n\n2.\nThe  Project  targets  urban  and  particularly  rural  areas;  therefore,  the  consumer\nsegments  and  their  proportions  differ  for  the  Bangladesh  Power  Development  Board\n(BPDB)  and  Rural  Electricity  Board  (REB)  investment  portions  and  are  calculated\nseparately.  The  major  towns  have  only  three  major  consumer  segments:  domestic,\ncommercial,  and  industrial.  For  the  REB  areas,  there  is  also  a  significantly  large\nagricultural consumer segment for which economic benefits were also calculated.\n\n3.\nCustomers suffer from not only load shedding but also fluctuating voltage levels\nand generally poor quality of supply.  In addition to improving the quality and quantity of\nsupply,  the  Project  will  also  provide  for  new  connections,  particularly  under  the  REB\ninvestment  component  in  predominantly  rural  areas.  The  vast  majority  of  new\nconsumers  will  be  added  in  the  first  three  years  after  construction  is  completed;  after\nthat  the  growth  rate  of  new  connections  will  drop  back  to  the  normal  level  of  about  1\npercent.  Benefits  for  the  new  customers  were  valued  at  their  economic  replacement\ncost,  that  is  the  alternative  economic  costs  of  other  energy  source  such  as  captive\npower  plants  for  industrial  users  or  kerosene  lamps  for  domestic  consumers.  It  is\nexpected that when load shedding is completely eliminated and reliable electricity supply\nis created, there will be increased purchase of more sensitive electrical appliances like\nrefrigerators for domestic consumers or production equipment for industries.\n\n4.\nInduced  consumption  was  valued  by  estimating  the  consumer\u2019s  willingness  to\npay for incremental electricity supply and adding the related consumer surplus benefits\nto  the  tariff-based  revenues.  For  reasons  of  convenience,  frequently,  the  relevant\ndemand  curve  segment  is  treated  as  linear  to  simplify  the  arithmetic  calculations.\nHowever, to reflect the demand price elasticity for the various categories of consumers,\nin this evaluation only a portion of the maximum consumer\u2019s surplus benefits is assumed\nfor  the  valuation  of  induced  sales.  This  is  arithmetically  expressed  by  using  different\ncurvature factors for different consumer categories, all of which are smaller than 0.5.\n\n5.\nAlternative  sources  of  power  used  by  the  four  major  consumer  segments  were\ndetermined  and  their  respective  costs  were  estimated.  The  dominant  sources  of\nalternative power in the domestic sector are kerosene lamps and in the urban areas also\ninverter  batteries.  Private  ownership  of  small  diesel  generators  is  very  low  throughout\nBangladesh  and  is  found  only  among  very  high-income  urban  consumers  and  thus\ncannot  be  considered  for  estimating  the  willingness  to  pay.  A  large  proportion  of  total\nend-consumption  in  the  domestic  sector  is  for  lighting  purposes  and  to  run  small\nappliances  like  TV  sets,  fan,  and  radio.  During  power  cuts  or  in  non-electrified  areas,\nelectricity is substituted almost exclusively for lighting purposes. Therefore, consumption\nin  the  domestic  sector  was  valued  based  on  the  use  of  kerosene  lamps,  using  the\nwillingness-to-pay  method  plus  the  related  consumer  surplus  with  a  curvature  factor  of\n0.3. Consumer surplus was estimated at Tk3.22/kilowatt-hour (kWh) for REB customers\nand at Tk2.82/kWh for BPDB consumers, reflecting the different tariffs levels of the two\ndistribution units.\n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 13, page 2\n\nInverter  batteries  are  the  alternative  energy  source  in  the  commercial  sector\n6.\nsince  it  can  be  used  to  operate  small  appliances  that  are  typically  used  in  small\ncommercial establishments, like fans, TV sets, and radios in addition to lighting purpose.\nSince the project area is generally less economically developed, use of small generators\nfor  commercial  establishments  is  unlikely,  given  the  high  up-front  capital  cost  of\npurchase and installation. The financial cost of using inverter batteries was estimated at\nTk5.9 per kWh. A curvature factor of 0.4 was used in the calculations.\n\nInquiries made with BPDB and REB found that the industry sector in the project\n7.\narea  consists  mainly  of  smaller  industrial  establishments  that  have  not  invested\nsubstantially  in  captive  power.  According  to  the  two  utilities,  the  typical  captive  power\nfacility is a small diesel generator set of approximately 40 kilowatts. Textile mills would\nbe  the  user  of  this  type  of  generator.    The  financial  cost  of  such  a  generator  was\nestimated to be Tk5.5/kWh and as for the commercial segment, a curvature factor of 0.4\nwas used.\n\nFor  the  purposes  of  the  economic  analysis,  the  estimated  capital  costs  of  the\n8.\ntransmission  and  distribution  components  were  broken  down  into  direct  foreign\nexchange  items,  indirect  foreign  exchange,  and  local  goods  and  services.  All  costs\nelements  were  valued  in  border  prices,  using  a  domestic  currency  numeraire,  with  all\ntaxes  and  duties  excluded,  a  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.855  being  applied  to\nnontraded items, and a labor conversion factor of 0.8 being used for unskilled labor and\n1.1 for skilled labor. Operating costs were calculated as a fixed percentage of economic\ninvestment cost, using 1 percent for the transmission component and 5 percent for the\ndistribution investments. Operating costs are building up gradually until the construction\nperiod is completed.\n\n9.\nThe  economic  benefits  of  transmission  and  distribution  facilities  required  to\nevacuate power from new generation projects, such as the proposed independent power\nproducers (IPPs), are difficult to determine independently. Transmission and distribution\nare  integral  parts  of  the  total  power  system  development  plan  and  not  independent\ninvestments. The EIRR on the complete investment required in new generation projects\nplus associated transmission and distribution are normally considered as representative\nof  the  rate  of  return  on  transmission  and  distribution  investments,  as  they  are  typically\nonly a part of the total investment.\n\nTherefore, \n\nthe  economic  evaluations  of \n\ntransmission  and  distribution\n10.\ncomponents include economic send-out costs of power.  The Project aims specifically to\nconstruct  transmission  and  distribution  facilities  needed  to  evacuate  power  from  newly\nproposed IPP projects for which no financial closure has been arrived at yet and thus, no\ntakeoff prices are available. Power input costs are valued at the long-run marginal cost\n(LRMC)  generation  level  for  IPP  plants  that  have  already  reached  financial  closure  at\n$0.375/kWh.\n\nOn  the  basis  of  a  comparison  of  economic  costs  and  benefits  over  a  20-year\n11.\nproject  lifetime,  including  a  five-year  construction  period,  the  EIRR  was  estimated  at\n19.30  percent  with  a  net  present  value  (NPV)  of  Tk6,495  million.    Extensive  sensitivity\ntesting was carried out and found that the Project is robust for all of the tested variables.\n\n12.\nSensitivity  testing  found  a  comfortable  switching  value  for  increases  in  capital\ncosts  of  59  percent,  and  of  24  percent  for  increase  in  energy  input  prices.  Testing  for\n\n\f71\n\nAppendix 13, page 3\n\nchanges  in  curvature  factors  for  the  different  consumer  categories  as  well  as  for\nchanges  of  fuel  input  prices  for  selected  captive  generation  did  not  lead  to  significant\ndeterioration in the EIRR.\n\n\fTable A13.1:  Economic Evaluation of the Bangladesh West Zone Power System Development Project\n\nCapital Cost\n\nOperating
