The  first \nperiodic  financing  request  (PFR)  has  been  classified  as \nenvironment category B. An overall summary initial environmental \nexamination (IEE) and four IEEs have been conducted.  \n \nA  resettlement  framework  and  an  indigenous  peoples' \ndevelopment framework have been prepared for the MFF. The \nfirst PFR is classified as category B for involuntary resettlement \nand as category C for indigenous peoples' development. A draft \nresettlement  plan  has  been  undertaken  for  Gangtok\u2019s  water \nsupply rehabilitation subproject. \n   \nSector Investment  The proposed North Eastern Region Capital Cities Development \nProgram  Investment Program (NERCCDIP) has been designed to improve \nthe  urban  environment  and  promote  reforms  for  sustainable, \nefficient, and responsive urban service delivery in the capital cities \nof five states in the North Eastern Region (NER), namely, Agartala \n(Tripura),  Aizawl  (Mizoram),  Kohima  (Nagaland),  Sikkim \n(Gangtok) and Shillong (Meghalaya). The physical investments \ninvolve improvements in water supply, sanitation and sewerage, \nand  solid  waste  management  infrastructure.  Physical \nimprovements will be coupled with urban governance, finance, \nand service delivery reforms and a capacity-building program to \nsupport the implementation of NERCCDIP and the urban reform \nagenda.  \n   \nMultitranche Financing  The MFF will finance subprojects under NERCCDIP, provided the \nFacility    central Government  and  the  state governments  of  Meghalaya, \nMizoram,  Nagaland,  Sikkim,  and  Tripura  comply  with  the \nassurances  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  and  the \nconstituent subprojects are in line with those assurances and the \ncriteria set out in the framework financing agreement (FFA). \n ", "ii \n  ADB will provide loans to finance projects under the MFF as soon \nas the projects are ready for financing and after a satisfactory \nrelated PFR is submitted. Each loan will constitute a tranche and \nmay carry terms different from the financing terms of previous or \nlater  loans.  The  choice  of  financing  terms  will  depend  on  the \nproject  and  ADB\u2019s  financing  policies  at  the  time  the  loan  is \ndocumented in a legal document. Tranches may be provided in \nsequence or simultaneously, and may overlap.  \n   \nRationale  A core objective of the 11th Five-Year Plan (2007\u20132012) of the \nGovernment  is  reducing  regional  disparities.  Investments  in \ninfrastructure  and  services  in  the  NER,  one  of  India\u2019s \nless-developed regions, have priority. The 10th and 11th plans \nhighlight the vital role of capital cities in NER\u2019s socioeconomic \ntransformation. Given the difficult access to and remoteness of \nNER, the capital cities perform a function of a much higher order \nthan other cities of similar size in India. With the opening up of \ntrade with neighboring countries and the emergence of transport \ncorridors in the region, these cities are expected to play an even \ngreater  strategic  role  in  NER\u2019s  economy  as  commercial  and \nbusiness hubs besides being administrative centers. Investments \nin urban infrastructure and services will be the key to unleashing \nthe potential of these cities to catalyze the growth of NER.  \n \nThe  11th  plan  also  stresses  the  importance  of  improving  the \nquality  of  governance  and  service  delivery  systems,  to  pace \nNER\u2019s development. It advocates a two-pronged approach linking \nfunds  for  capital  investments  with  reforms.  The  plan\u2019s  main \nreference for reforms is the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act of \n1994, which promotes decentralized urban governance. With the \nJawaharlal  Nehru  National  Urban  Renewal  Mission,  the \nGovernment has reaffirmed its commitment to urban development \nthrough investments in a number of cities, subject to the cities\u2019 \ncommitment to reforms for decentralized and sustainable urban \nservice delivery. NERCCDIP, as well as the sector road maps \nfrom which it is derived, is guided by this policy framework. Its aim \nis to contribute to the Government\u2019s goal of bringing the NER up \nto par with developed regions of India. The Program links capital \ninvestments  to  reforms  for  sustainable  impact.  It  targets  the \ncapital cities that will spearhead the development of NER linking \nIndia to the neighboring states.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The expected impact of NERCCDIP is improved environment and \nwell-being  of  urban  residents  in  the  five  capital  cities.  The \nexpected outcome at the end of the program will be sustainable \nand increased access to better urban services in five program \ncities. To this end, NERCCDIP will (i) improve and expand urban \ninfrastructure and services in the cities, including slums; and (ii) \nstrengthen  the  urban  institutional,  management,  and  financing \ncapacity  of  the  local  institutions,  particularly  the  urban  local \nbodies. NERCCDIP will ensure that benefits from investments are ", "iii \nenjoyed by the poor, women, and all other vulnerable groups.  \n   \nCost Estimates  Of the estimated $1.9 billion in long-term investment requirements \nfor the NER capital cities according to the sectoral road maps, \nNERCCDIP is expected to provide $285.7 million equivalent. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \nSource  Total  % \nAsian Development Bank  200.0  70 \nGovernment of India and state   85.7  30 \ngovernments \n   Total  285.7  100 \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nFacility Amount and  A  facility  of  up  to  $200.0  million  from  the  ordinary  capital \nTerms  resources of ADB will be provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)\u2013based lending facility. The Government will \nensure  that  the  state  governments  of  Meghalaya,  Mizoram, \nNagaland, Sikkim, and Tripura use the proceeds of each tranche \nfor the expenditures of NERCCDIP, according to the conditions \nset forth in the FFA and the legal agreements for each tranche. \n \nA loan of $30.0 million has been requested under the first PFR to \ncover part of the cost of project 1. The Government will make the \nloan  proceeds  available  to  the  state  governments  through \ngovernment grants (90%) and government loans (10%).  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  NERCCDIP  resources  will  be  tentatively  available  in  three \ntranches (or more if needed) until 30 June 2016 (the last PFR is \nexpected to be submitted by 31 December 2012).  \n   \nEstimated Program  31 December  2015 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  The  national  executing  agency  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Urban \nDevelopment (MOUD). The state executing agencies (SEAs) will \nbe the Urban Development Department for Tripura and Nagaland, \nthe Urban Development and Poverty Alleviation Department for \nMizoram, the Urban Affairs Department for Meghalaya, and the \nUrban Development and Housing Department for Sikkim. \n   \nImplementation  An  investment  program  coordination  cell  (IPCC)  will  be \nArrangements  established in MOUD. IPCC will be responsible for the overall \nmanagement  of  NERCCDIP  in  the  five  cities.  This  team  of \nadministrative  and  financial,  technical,  and  social  and \nenvironmental  officials  (at  least  three),  under  an  investment \nprogram  manager,  will  (i)  monitor  overall  NERCCDIP  physical \nprogress  and  implementation,  (ii)  review  the  subprojects \nsubmitted  by  the  states  according  to  the  subproject  selection \ncriteria and submit PFRs to the Department of Economic Affairs, \n(iii) consolidate payment and reimbursement requests, (iv) report \n ", "iv \nto ADB on the progress of NERCCDIP implementation and other \nmatters, (v) monitor implementation of the overall reform program \nand compliance with loan covenants, and (vi) provide assistance \nto the states. A national steering committee will monitor the overall \nuse of the MFF. \n  \nA  consolidated  state  investment  program  management  and \nimplementation unit (SIPMIU) will be established in each of the \nfive SEAs. A state steering committee (SSC) and an investment \nprogram empowered committee will also be established in each \nstate. The SIPMIU, to be headed by a state investment program \ndirector,  will  be  responsible  for  managing  and  implementing \nNERCCDIP  in  the  state,  including  monitoring  its  progress; \npreparing and forwarding subprojects for approval to SSC and \nMOUD;  ensuring  compliance  with  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework,  subproject  selection  criteria,  loan  covenants,  and \nurban reform targets; and coordinating with MOUD and other state \nagencies  in  the  selection  of  consultants  and  contractors,  the \napproval  of  the  detailed  designs  of  the  subprojects,  the \npreparation  of  disbursement  requests  and  their  forwarding  to \nMOUD for submission to ADB, the administration of the contracts \nof consultants and contractors, the certification of payments and \nthe  preparation  of  change  orders,  and  the  implementation  of \nawareness programs and environment and resettlement plans.  \n   \nProcurement  All  goods  and  services  under  NERCCDIP  will  be  procured \naccording to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). Civil works contracts estimated at $5.0 million \nor more, and supply contracts valued at $1.0 million or higher, will \nundergo international competitive bidding. Civil works and supply \ncontracts  costing  less  than  those  amounts  will  be  procured \nthrough national competitive bidding. Goods below $100,000 in \nvalue  will  be  procured  through  shopping.  The  feasibility  of \ncommunity contracting will be examined individually for low-cost \nsanitation and other community works not exceeding $100,000 in \nvalue. \n   \nConsulting Services  Consultants will be hired by each of the five SIPMIUs to support \ndesign,  construction  supervision,  and  management,  and \ninstitutional  development  activities.  The  need  for  consulting \nservices is expected to decline gradually during implementation as \nthe  SIPMIUs  and  SEAs  increase  their  capacity,  and  will  be \nreviewed after the first two tranches are completed. \n \nMOUD will also be supported by a program management and \nmonitoring consultant, who will (i) assist program coordination by \nmonitoring  and  reporting  regularly  on  progress,  identifying \nimplementation  bottlenecks,  and  recommending  corrective \nactions; (ii) review the subproject appraisal reports prepared by \nthe SIPMIUs and support the preparation of PFRs for submission; \n(iii)  support  capacity-building  activities;  and  (iv)  draft  an  urban ", "v \nreform action and monitoring plan. \n \nAgencies  or  institutions,  including  established  registered \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  will  also  be  hired  for \nparticipatory  planning,  community  awareness  activities,  and \nsurveys, among others. All consultants and NGOs will be recruited \naccording to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, \nas amended from time to time). \n   \nInvestment Program  NERCCDIP will benefit the estimated 1.2 million people who are \nBenefits and  expected to be living in the five cities by 2015, by improving the \nBeneficiaries  urban environment and thus the health and living conditions and \nproductivity of the residents. The rise in productivity and urban \nefficiency  resulting  from  the  urban  infrastructure  and  service \nimprovements will benefit their economies. As their infrastructure \nand services improve, the cities will be better able to answer the \ngrowing needs of industry and trade resulting from investments in \ntransport and NER connectivity. All NERCCDIP interventions will \nbenefit the poor directly or indirectly. Improvements in citywide \ninfrastructure, e.g., sanitation and sewerage, will have a profound \nimpact on the poor, most of whom live in vulnerable and low-lying \nareas.  Further,  NERCCDIP  will  ensure  sustainable  urban \ndevelopment by supporting urban reforms and capacity building \nfor  better  urban  governance  and  service  delivery.  All  these \nimprovements will reduce the disparities between NER and the \ndeveloped regions of India.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  NERCCDIP\u2019s  potential  risks  include  the  following:  (i)  public \nresistance to the water metering program; (ii) low connectivity to \nthe new sewerage network; (iii) delayed implementation of the \nurban reform agenda by the state governments, and unwillingness \nof  the  public  to  pay  for  the  services;  and  (iv) slow  program \nimplementation  due  to  the  states\u2019  unfamiliarity  with  ADB \nprocedures.  \n \nMeasures incorporated into the program design will address these \npotential risks. Civic awareness programs will stimulate demand \nfor  better  services  and  willingness  to  pay.  Regulations  to  be \nissued  will  require  residents  to  connect  to  the  new  networks. \nNERCCDIP\u2019s strategy of linking investments to reforms will create \nincentives for reforms and ADB\u2019s continued policy dialogue during \nNERCCDIP implementation will provide further reinforcement. \n \nThe risk of slow implementation is being addressed from several \nangles  including  (i)  ongoing  technical  assistance  in  project \nimplementation  and  capacity  development,  (ii)  the  early \nappointment  of  project  management  consultants,  and  (iii)  the \nproposed establishment of an ADB extension office in the NER.  \n \nFinally, to address the risk of destruction to assets due to natural \nhazards, earthquake faults and slip lines have been mapped and \n ", "vi \nvarious  components  have  been  designed  to  protect  against \ndamage. All detailed designs will incorporate further measures, \nsuch as comprehensive geotechnical assessments.  \n  \n   \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF)1 for India for the North Eastern Region (NER) Capital Cities \nDevelopment Investment Program (NERCCDIP). The design and monitoring framework for the \nNERCCDIP is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES   \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  The NER, where the five states of Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, and Tripura \nare located, is one of India\u2019s least-developed regions. It is remote, landlocked, and far from the \nmarkets in the mainland. Only 2% of its territory connect the region to the rest of India through a \nnarrow land corridor. The five states share an international boundary with Bangladesh, Bhutan, \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China, Myanmar, and Nepal. The five states are encumbered by \ndifficult  terrain  and  a  mountainous  periphery.  In  these  predominantly  agricultural  and \ngovernment service economies, there is scant exploitation of natural resources and progress in \nindustry, the private sector and foreign direct investment are negligible, and unemployment is \nhigh. In 2003/04\u20132006/07 economic growth in the NER was 3.4% yearly, compared with the \nnational average of around 7.8%. The region contributes only 0.2% to the national output but \n4.4% of the total population. Social indicators in the NER have nonetheless improved over the \nlast decade. Literacy is nearly 100% in three of the five cities and about two thirds of the \npopulation of all five cities2 has had at least a secondary education. While life expectancy at \nbirth is lower than the national average, the infant mortality rate is better than the national \naverage of 68 per 1,000 live births. \n \n3.  The urbanization rate in NER (15%) is lower than in the rest of India (27.8%). The rapid \ngrowth of urban populations since independence has been driven by high natural growth rates, \naccession to statehood, insurrections in the countryside, and the flow of government funding \ninto NER. Urban development in the five states is dominated by the capital cities, which account \nfor more than 60% of the states\u2019 total urban population. The population in the five capital cities \nranges from a low of 93,000 in Gangtok to a high of about 380,000 in Agartala. These cities \nhave grown annually by up to more than 5% in the past. The growth rates are projected to \ndecline in the future but are still expected to range from 1.8%\u20133% yearly over the next 15 years.  \n \n4.  All five capital cities are in seismic zone V and are therefore highly susceptible to \nearthquakes. All have tropical monsoon climates. The location of all the cities except Agartala, \non top of steep mountain slopes, constrains physical growth, makes development costly, and \ncontributes to vulnerability to landslips. The NER\u2019s poor connectivity with and isolation from the \nrest of India and the countries on its borders severely limits the development of the five cities. \nBut the geographic status of the states and the capital cities is changing as ongoing and \nplanned transport projects link the capital cities to one another, to the rest of India, and to the \nneighboring countries. Improved connectivity, combined with India\u2019s recent policy of opening up \nits borders to trade with neighbors and to a better relationship with the rest of South Asia, as \n                                                \n1  NERCCDIP has been designed as an MFF primarily because of the broad and complex institutional and financial \nreform agenda associated with the Government\u2019s road map, which requires a long-term partnership between ADB \nand India and the North Eastern states, and performance-based approaches. MFF will allow flexibility in investment \ndecisions based on the needs and constraints in each city, progress with the reform agenda, and the readiness of \nindividual subprojects and cities. It will enable long-term engagement to build the capacity of urban local bodies \nand will provide proper incentives for performance improvements, with individual loans linked to reform targets \nstretched over a realistic time frame.  \n2  Agartala (Tripura), Aizawl (Mizoram), Gangtok (Sikkim), Kohima (Nagaland), and Shillong (Meghalaya). ", "2 \nwell as with Southeast and East Asian countries, presents immense opportunities for NER\u2019s \ncapital cities, which could become dynamic economic hubs.  \n \n5.  All the states rank low on the infrastructure index. The five capital cities are held back by \ninadequate urban infrastructure and services from fulfilling the development potential created by \na latent productive labor force and increasing connectivity. From 15% to 25% of the population \nin these cities lives below the poverty line, according to the states\u2019 income-based classification. \nPoverty based on non-income factors (access to basic urban services) is higher, indicating that \nthe lack of basic infrastructure and services not only constrains the economic growth of the \ncities but also contributes in a major way to poverty.  \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n  1.  Inadequate Urban Infrastructure and Services  \n6.  Urban  infrastructure  and  services  (water  supply,  sanitation,  drainage,  solid  waste \nmanagement,  urban  transport,  and  roads)  in  the  five  NER  cities  are  considered  grossly \ninadequate.3 The percentage of the population with access to central piped water supply ranges \nfrom 50% in Shillong to 80% in Gangtok. Service is poor. Agartala has piped water for only a \nfew hours a day; Aizawl, Kohima, and Shillong are supplied with water for only a few hours a \nweek in the dry season. Distribution systems in all the cities are old and inadequate, and \nproduction capacity in Aizawl and Kohima is substantially below demand. Most cities have \n\u201cbunched\u201d service connection systems, where consumers make their own connections to small \nsupply  tanks.  These  individual  connection  pipes,  mostly  laid  along  drains,  cause  system \ninefficiencies, are prone to contamination, and interfere with other services. A critical issue is the \nhigh rate of unaccounted-for water in the cities: officially it ranges from 35% to 50%, but the \nactual figures are higher. Water is unmetered in the cities except Aizawl, and to a limited extent \nKohima, where metering and volumetric charging have recently been introduced.  \n \n7.  There are no centralized piped sewer systems in the cities except Gangtok, and its \nsystem serves only about 12% of the population. About 72% of households in the region have \nseptic tanks or soak pits with wastewater percolating into the soil, and an overflow to the \nnearest drain or stream. Sullage water is often directed to drains. On average, about 95% of the \npopulation of the cities has access to a toilet (or a shared toilet) at home, while 5% uses either a \npublic toilet or an open field. Septic tank emptying services are insufficient in all the cities except \nAizawl, and there are no waste treatment facilities. Public health regulations that control the \ndischarge of sewage are still to be met. Inadequate sanitation causes pollution of the ground, \nstreams, and roadside drains, presenting a severe environmental and health risk. Inadequate \nsanitation is also a major cause of landslips in all the hill cities.  \n  \n8.  On average, only 30%\u201350% of solid waste generated is collected and, depending on the \nState, 3%\u201334% of households have access to house-to-house services. There is little or no \nprovision for the collection and disposal of hazardous wastes; these are generally disposed of \nthrough open dumping and burning. A substantial proportion of households dump their wastes \nin the nearest open space or drain, and many others do the same from time to time. The \nsituation is worse in low-income areas, where, despite the communities\u2019 best efforts, there are \nsimply not enough resources to provide the necessary services, and in the hill towns, where the \nhills are too steep to allow collection vehicles to enter and bins are difficult to use. Equipment \nuse is generally inefficient, and wastes collected, transported, and disposed of are not recorded. \n                                                \n3  LEA International. 2006. TA4348-IND: North Eastern Region Urban Development Project. Final Report. Guwahati.  ", "3 \nAlthough management is not without difficulties, Gangtok and Shillong operate composting \nplants. Other cities have no treatment facilities.  \n  2.  Urban Governance and Management    \n9.  An analysis of urban institutions and finances in the five NER states suggests that \ninadequate urban governance and management systems contribute significantly to poor urban \nplanning, infrastructure, and services in the cities. Dedicated urban local authorities are still at \nan early stage of development in several capital cities. Only Agartala has a fully functioning \nurban local body (ULB) with a service area that encompasses most of the urban built-up area, \nbut its jurisdiction, ward boundaries, and municipal limits still have to be finalized. Shillong has a \nmunicipal board but no elected council, and the board serves only about 30% of the city. \nKohima has a municipality with an elected council, but its effectiveness is circumscribed by legal \nprovisions inconsistent with the concept of a ULB, its pure-conservancy functions, and small \narea of coverage. In Gangtok, no ULB has existed since 1985; the Sikkim Municipal Bill was \npassed in 2007 but is yet to be implemented. The Aizawl Municipal Council was formed in \nJune 2008 and elections to the council are to be held within 12 months, but jurisdiction has yet \nto be defined and functions are still to be transferred.  \n \n10.  Urban governance is further complicated by conflicts between modern legislation and \ntraditional  governance  structures  in  some  cities.  Shillong,  for  example,  comes  under  the \n6th Schedule to the Constitution, which calls for traditional systems of governance for scheduled \ntribes.4 The overlapping jurisdictions of modern and traditional structures affect service delivery. \nMoreover, without fully functioning ULBs, these cities provide many urban services through their \nstates\u2019 departments. But these departments, having limited resources and wide responsibility for \nboth urban and rural areas within the states, cannot provide the dedicated management needed \nto meet the diverse demands of the growing and densely populated cities. Water supply and \nsanitation are generally the responsibility of the state departments of public health engineering \n(PHEDs).  Infrastructure  builders  by  tradition,  PHEDs  are  not  equipped  with  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) skills and resources. They lack proper asset management systems and \ntheir operating costs are often high. Sanitation regulations are also poorly enforced.  \n  3.  Urban Finance   \n11.  Urban infrastructure and services in the five capital cities are mostly financed by the \ncentral Government through the state governments. Only a few small schemes are financed by \nthe private sector. Most funding goes to major capital works; little funding is set aside for the \nrepair and replacement of infrastructure. The states and ULBs lack revenues of their own to \nattend to the O&M of infrastructure and services and to sustain service delivery. \n \n12.  User charges and urban-based taxes are only partially implemented, if at all. Among the \nfive  capital  cities,  only  Agartala  and  Shillong5 levy  property  taxes.6 The  introduction  and \nrationalization of user charges is also a challenge. Water charges are levied in all the cities but \n                                                \n4  In Shillong, the dorbar (traditional assembly or council of elders) system of governance coexists with the state \ngovernment.  \n5  The Shillong Municipal Board has already set up a unit area\u2013based system with a property database backed by a \ngeographic information system. Agartala, on the other hand, is still to migrate to such a system. \n6  In Aizawl a government notification regarding the introduction of property tax has been issued. Kohima has no \nproperty tax, although the Nagaland Municipal Act, 2001, provides for one. In Gangtok, the introduction of property \ntax should follow the formation of a ULB. \n ", "4 \nare far below the operating costs and are, for the most part, not based on consumption.7 They \ncover no more than 10%\u201330% of O&M costs. Aizawl and, to a lesser extent, Kohima have \nintroduced water metering and volumetric charges, not without problems. Aizawl and Kohima \nlevy  no  solid  waste  charges.  Agartala  and  Shillong  obtain  revenues  from  a  solid  waste \nmanagement tax included in the property tax. Gangtok levies small \u201ctoilet charges\u201d monthly and \nsolid waste management fees yearly. Again, revenues are substantially below O&M needs. \nPoor financial management and accounting systems8 are also responsible for the poor services. \nIn these cities the gap between the residents\u2019 desire and willingness to pay for better services \nand the level of services is widening.  \n  4.  External Assistance and Lessons Learned  \n13.  External Assistance. The five NER states have not received any large-scale external \nassistance  for  urban  sector  development.  Only  the  roads  sector  has  had  sizable  external \nassistance, from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). External assistance \nto the urban sector has been confined to pilot small-scale infrastructure schemes and capacity \nbuilding. The Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) recently completed a \nsmall water supply, sewerage, and solid waste management project in Gangtok and Shillong.  \n \n14.  Until recently, ADB assistance to the urban sector in India has been directed toward \nother states. ADB has provided 38 technical assistance (TA) grants totalling $36.75 million to \nIndia\u2019s urban sector since 1993, and has approved $3.61 billion in loans for 14 projects. The \nassistance, mostly for integrated urban infrastructure and services projects, has been aimed at \npoverty reduction through shared growth, social development, and good governance. Recently, \ngiven the need to redress the growing regional disparities in the country, ADB committed to \ndiversify its operations to the northern states, which it identified as priority geographic areas of \nassistance. An advisory TA for the preparation of an urban sector profile of the North Eastern \nstates was followed by a project preparatory TA for the NERCCDIP. In addition, an advisory TA9 \nfor  capacity  building  in  NER  is  being  implemented  to  provide  project  management  and \nimplementation support to agencies and improve their project preparedness. Appendix 2 gives \ndetails of external support to the urban sector in India.  \n \n15.  Lessons. ADB\u2019s experience in the urban sector in India reveals that complex issues in \nurban  development  projects10 (i)  require  greater  coordination  among  concerned  agencies, \nstronger institutional capacity, and the active participation of stakeholders; (ii) delay project \nimplementation,  especially  during  project start-up;  and (iii) compromise  the  sustainability  of \nproject assets. The experience suggests that (i) up-front support for capacity building in project \nmanagement and implementation minimizes delays in project start-up; and (ii) more attention \nmust  be  paid to  ensuring  sustainability  by  building  the  capacity  of  ULBs  and  other  urban \ninstitutions and service providers to plan, manage, and finance urban development. A number of \nNER-specific lessons can also be gleaned from the ongoing World Bank\u2013funded roads project. \nIn  particular,  low  institutional  capacity,  poor  connectivity,  and  difficult  terrain  delay \nimplementation, constrain supply, and raise costs beyond the amounts envisaged at the design \nstage.  These  lessons  indicate  the  need  to  extend  the  period  of  implementation,  including \n                                                \n7  In Agartala and Shillong, revenue functions for water services are vested in the ULB, while capital works and O&M \n(only partly for Shillong) rest with PHED. In other states, all three functions are PHED responsibilities. \n8  Accounts of ULBs in Agartala, Kohima, and Shillong are based on single-entry, cash-based systems. Other \nagencies (PHED, etc.) all keep regular accounts on the same basis. Aizawl, on the other hand, still has to prepare \na state accounting manual. \n9  ADB. 2006.

The design of NERCCDIP takes the foregoing lessons into account. \n  5.  Rationale: North Eastern Region Capital Cities Development Road Map \n16.  As reflected in its policies, the Government of India attaches increasing importance to \nurban development. Under the 10th Five-Year Plan (2002\u20132007) the Government committed to \ninvest more in less-developed states and to build sustainable infrastructure in major urban \nareas.11 The Jawarhalal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) was of particular \nsignificance  in  defining  a  common  framework  for  reform12 and  the  associated  conditional \ninfrastructure investment program.13 The five capital cities covered by NERCCDIP are among \nthe  63  JNNURM  cities.  All  five  NER  state  governments  have  signed  memorandums  of \nagreement with the Ministry of Urban Development (MOUD). The agreed targets and the status \nof their implementation are summarized in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \n17.  The  11th  Five-Year  Plan  (2007\u20132012),  while  focused  on  more  broad-based  and \ninclusive growth, sets to reduce poverty and disparities between regions and communities by \nensuring access to basic physical infrastructure and a comprehensive strategy for better health, \namong  others.14 The  recently  approved  National  Urban  Sanitation  Policy  is  an  immediate \noutcome of this vision. The private sector is identified as a key partner for rapid growth, although \nthe 11th Plan also recognizes that public-private partnerships may not always be possible, \nespecially  in  more  economically  disadvantaged  areas  of  the  country,  and  that  continuous \nsupport from the public sector is required. The strategic role of the capital cities in NER\u2019s \nsocioeconomic transformation is also recognized. Given the difficult terrain and remoteness of \nNER to mainland India, the capital cities perform a function of a much higher order than capital \ncities of similar size in the rest of India. With border trade with neighboring countries opening up \nand emerging transport corridors improving the connectivity of the cities with one another, with \nmainland India, and with neighboring countries, these cities are expected to play an even \ngreater role in the region\u2019s economy as commercial and business hubs in addition to being \nadministrative centers. The timely provision of urban infrastructure and services in the capital \ncities would be a key to harnessing the emerging economic potential of these cities.  \n \n18.  The  Vision.  The  North  Eastern  Region  Capital  Cities  Development  Road  Map \n(Appendix 3)  is  guided  by  the  10th  and  11th  plans,  major  urban  policy  and  legislative \ninstruments, and state-specific policies, targets, and aspirations. \n                                                \n11  The main reference for reform was defined to be the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1994 (74th CAA), \ncreating an enabling framework for ULBs to play a pivotal role in urban service delivery and to be equipped with \nnecessary financial and administrative powers and capacity. Key areas of support were (i) broad-based urban \nsector reforms giving the ULBs autonomy and debt servicing capability so that they could gain access to capital \nmarket funds, (ii) rationalization and improvement of the property tax system, (iii) promotion of public\u2013private \npartnerships in urban sector activities, (iv) studies to develop a disaggregated picture of urban growth, and \n(v) better O&M of municipal assets. \n12  JNNURM reiterates the need for the states to empower ULBs to pursue reforms for the levy of user charges, the \nenhancement  of  property  tax,  the  rationalization  of  establishment  costs,  and  the  improvement  of  financial \nmanagement systems. It also advocates balancing asset creation with asset management, incorporating private \nsector efficiencies into service delivery, and making service providers financially sustainable. \n13  The 10th Plan supported a two-pronged approach whereby funds for capital investments were linked to urban \ngovernance, finance, and service delivery reforms. With this program, the Government reaffirmed its promise of \nsustainable urban development by committing sizable funds for fast-track investments in 63 cities across the \ncountry, subject to the cities\u2019 commitment to a range of reforms. \n14  Preliminary exercises suggest that investment in infrastructure (defined as road, rail, air, and water transport; \npower generation, transmission, and distribution; telecommunication; water supply; irrigation; and storage) will \nneed to increase from 4.6% of GDP to around 8% in the 11th Plan period. Specific targets set forth in the 11th Plan \ninclude (i) the provision of clean drinking water for all by 2009, and (ii) the treatment of all urban wastewater by \n2011\u20132012.  \n ", "6 \n \n19.  The long-term investment requirements (for the next 20 years), assessed as part of the \nroad map, is estimated to exceed $1.9 billion,15 of which $1.1 billion is needed for water supply, \nsewerage and sanitation, and solid waste management. NERCCDIP constitutes over 12% of the \nlonger-term urban infrastructure investment requirements and about 21% of the total required \ninvestment in the three captioned subsectors. It covers priority investments with emphasis on \nupgrading infrastructure and services, improving operational efficiencies, testing new methods \nof  delivery  of  better  services,  and  establishing  the  institutional,  operational,  and  financial \nfoundation for sustainable improvements. Improvements are envisaged to continue after the \ncompletion of NERCCDIP, on the basis of proven approaches and enhanced institutional and \nfinancial  capacity  to  increase  service  coverage  by  2027.  The  states  will  need  to  avail \nthemselves of alternative sources of financing to meet the remaining investment requirements, \nfrom potential sources like JNNURM, the non-lapsable central pool of resources, multilateral \ninstitutions, and the private sector.  \n \n20.  The  road  map,  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  policies,  also  sets  a  vision  for  the \ndevelopment of urban governance, finance, and service delivery frameworks in the capital cities. \nThe  vision  entails  a  number  of  sequenced  municipal  reforms  to  develop  legislative  and \ninstitutional  frameworks  for  ULBs  and  strengthen  the  capacity  of  ULBs  for  effective  and \naccountable urban service delivery. The road map stipulates as well the need for infrastructure \nand service provision to have a commercial and self-sustaining basis and for the required \ninstitutional mechanisms to be put in place. The cities are foreseen to gradually move toward \ndeveloping  water  and  sewerage  agencies  that  are  capable  of  performance-based  service \ndelivery  and  financial  self-sustainability.  The  institutional  reform  measures  are  also \naccompanied with reforms that will create sustainable sources of revenues by introducing and \nrationalizing user charges and urban-based taxes. \n \n21.  NERCCDIP is designed to use the MFF because of the broader and complex agenda for \nthe  development  of  the  NER  capital  cities.  The  road  map  involves  providing  core  urban \ninfrastructure and services in five capital cities with similar geographic and locational attributes \nand growing interconnectedness but with needs and absorptive capacities that vary in degree. \nMFF, while enabling a single development framework, allows investment decisions to be flexible \nand based on the specific needs of each city and the readiness of individual subprojects, and \nnot on a strict definition of needs up-front. The road map also involves a complex agenda of \ninstitutional and financial reforms that necessitates a long-term partnership between ADB and \nIndia  and  its  NER  states,  and  performance-based  approaches.  MFF  allows  long-term \nengagement to build the capacity of urban institutions and ULBs and proper incentives for \nimproved performance, with individual loans linked to reform targets over a realistic period. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome  \n22.  The expected impact of NERCCDIP is improved environment and well-being of urban \nresidents in the five capital cities. The expected outcome at the end of the program will be \nsustainable and increased access to better urban services in five program cities.  To this end, (i) \nurban infrastructure and services in the capital cities, including slums, will be improved and \nexpanded; and (ii) the institutional, managerial, and financial capacity of the urban institutions, \nincluding ULBs, will be strengthened. The benefits from investments will be enjoyed by the poor, \n                                                \n15  This value has been derived from adding the estimate for infrastructure development in each individual city \ndevelopment plan (as required under JNNURM) and updated in value as of October 2008. ", "7 \nwomen, and all other vulnerable groups, and any negative environmental and social impact will \nbe minimized or prevented. \n \nB.  Outputs \n23.  There are two groups of outputs: (i) urban infrastructure and service improvements, \nincluding  the  rehabilitation,  improvement,  and  expansion  of  water  supply,  sewerage  and \nsanitation, and solid waste management facilities (part A); and (ii) program management and \nimplementation assistance, and comprehensive capacity building for institutional and financial \nreforms,  planning,  O&M,  revenue  mobilization,  and  financial  management,  to  increase \nsustainability (part B). The size and type of the urban infrastructure and service improvements \nunder  part  A  may  vary  depending  on  the  specific  needs  and  demands  of  each  city,  as \ndetermined  in  infrastructure  master  planning  exercises,  social  surveys,  and  stakeholder \nconsultations.16 \n \n1.  Part A: Urban Infrastructure and Service Improvement  \n \n24.  Water Supply. Investments in this regard will be aimed at improving the quality of water \nand extending the service duration all year round to at least 12 hours a day throughout the \nsystem and 24 hours a day in most parts of the cities, and completely meeting demand by the \nend of the NERCCDIP. The investments, to be made in Agartala, Aizawl, Gangtok, and Kohima, \nwill  involve  expanding  water  production  capacity  through  source  and  treatment  works  (in \nAgartala);  expanding  and  rehabilitating  distribution  systems,  reservoirs,  and  machinery; \nreplacing \u201cbunched\u201d service connections (in the four hill cities) and old and leaking connections; \ninstalling  bulk  and  consumer  meters;  and  reducing  non-revenue  water  (NRW).  The \ninfrastructure  improvements  will  be  supported  by  awareness  campaigns  to  promote  water \nconservation, demand for water supply improvements, and sustainability and cost recovery \nobjectives.17  \n \n25.  Sewerage and Sanitation. The sewerage and sanitation improvement program will take \na two-pronged approach comprising (i) the construction of central piped sewerage and sewage \ntreatment  systems  and  the  provision  of  service  connections;  and  (ii)  the  improvement  of \nsanitation systems that rely on individual systems, particularly septic tanks and soak pits, until \nsewerage systems can be built. Community latrines will also be provided in low-income areas \nand  low-income  households  will  be  assisted  in  improving  sanitation.  The  sewerage \nimprovements are designed as modestly sized components serving the worst-affected areas of \nall cities but Agartala18 as the first stage of the development of sewerage master plans. The \nimprovements take into account (i) availability of enough wastewater to provide for gravity flows; \n(ii) efficient zoning of each city to minimize the number of treatment plants while still relying on \ngravity flows, and to avoid pumping; (iii) avoidance of sewage overflows due to pumping station \nfailure from power supply shortage; (iv) alignment and avoidance of landslip and earthquake \nrisk;  and  (v) affordability.  The  infrastructure  improvements  will  be  supported  by  awareness \ncampaigns to promote understanding of the need for better sanitation, increase demand for the \nimprovements, and gain broad acceptance of higher service rates to cover the cost of the \n                                                \n16  A comprehensive description of all activities proposed under the NERCCDIP and the first periodic financing \nrequest for each of the cities can be found in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n17  Improvements in water schemes for Shillong are being considered for JNNURM financing. \n18  The government of Tripura has indicated that financial assistance for the construction of a sewerage system in the \nCentral Zone has been allocated from other financiers, such as JNNURM. In the interim, according to data from the \nsocioeconomic surveys, consumers must be more willing to pay for sewerage services. Awareness programs \nunder the MFF will support this imitative.  \n ", "8 \nimprovements. Assistance in implementing sanitation regulations to prevent unsafe discharge of \nsanitary wastes also forms part of the sewerage improvements. \n \n26.  Solid Waste Management. The improvements in solid waste management will increase \nservice coverage to more than 80%. To this end, (i) awareness campaigns will be launched to \npromote understanding of the importance of good sanitation and in-house waste collection, \nsegregation, and recycling; (ii) solid waste collection, transportation, treatment, and disposal will \nbe improved through the provision of solid waste equipment, the construction of transfer stations \nas needed, and the development of sanitary landfill sites and composting plants;19 and (iii)  solid \nwaste operations will be made more efficient through the introduction of improved management \nsystems for the routing and scheduling of vehicles, other machinery, and staff and training \nprograms  to  maximize  the  benefits  from  investments  in  infrastructure  and  equipment.  All \nprogram components are described in detail in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n \n2.  Part B: Capacity Building and Investment Program Management  \n \n27.  Urban Governance and Financing. NERCCDIP will support the state governments and \nULBs in meeting their commitments to the institutional and financial reform agenda in line with \nthe policies of the central and state governments. In particular, it will help (i) further reforms \nassociated  with  the  creation  and  strengthening  of  ULBs,  (ii)  incorporate  efficiencies  and \ncommercial  principles  into  service  delivery  through  the  gradual  introduction  of  sustainable \nservice delivery agencies especially in water supply and sewerage, and (iii) implement financial \nmanagement reforms to promote sustainable sources of financing and the transparent use of \nfinancial resources for service delivery.  \n \n28.  Municipalization. NERCCDIP will assist the states in implementing the 74th CAA by \nsupporting them in (i) conducting civic awareness campaigns and public hearings toward the \ncreation and strengthening of ULBs, (ii) preparing or strengthening municipal legislation20 with a \nview  to  transferring  functions  from  the  state  to  the  ULB,  and  (iii)  conceptualizing  and \nimplementing  organizational  development  measures  and  introducing  operational  systems \nimprovements.21 Efforts will be made to integrate traditional structures into emerging urban \ngovernance frameworks. Such improvements will be complemented by comprehensive human \nresource development programs and training for officials. \n \n29.  Municipal Financial Reform. Improvements will be made in accounting and budgeting \nsystems and practices through the adoption of accrual-base accounting, the use of geographic \ninformation systems in revenue administration, and the computerization of financial systems. \nAssistance  will  also  be  extended  in  the  design,  introduction,  and  implementation  of \nconsumption-based and progressive user charges and improved property taxation to enable the \nrecovery of full O&M costs by the end of the NERCCDIP implementation period.  \n                                                \n19 Improvements will be introduced in all program cities. Composting facilities will be built in all towns but Shillong and \nGangtok, which already have such facilities. \n20  One or more of the following actions may be included: (i) framing rules under the Municipal Act to govern \nday-to-day administration, (ii) issuing an executive order constituting a municipality, (iii) agreeing on general \nprinciples of demarcating municipal boundaries and wards, (iv) amending the Municipality Act according to the 74th \nCAA, (v) issuing government orders and notifications transferring functions listed under the 12th Schedule of the \n74th CAA, (vi) framing the rules for ward delimitation, (vii) holding municipal elections, (viii) agreeing on a proposed \nstaffing and reporting structure and manpower requirements and submitting recommendations on these to the \nState  Finance  Commission,  (ix)  constituting  the  State  Finance  Commission  and  implementing  its \nrecommendations,  and  (x) submitting  recommended  municipal  budget  allocations  to  the  State  Finance \nCommission. \n21  Such as (i) fixing of cadre strength and responsibilities for various levels of officers; (ii) definition of job functions, \nskills,  and  qualification  requirements;  (iii)  short-term  training  for  new  staff  and  officers;  and  (iv)  improving \nrecruitment and transfer policies. ", "9 \n30.  Improved Service Delivery. NERCCDIP will also support the states in (i) improving \noperational and financial efficiency and asset management,22 and (ii) restructuring over the \nshort term the states\u2019 departments into a single ring fenced area with dedicated responsibility for \ncity  water  supply  and  sewerage,  and  for  accounting  and  financial  management.  The \ncapacity-building component will also include an umbrella program of civic awareness and \ncommunity  participation  (in  waste  segregation,  among  other  activities)  to  support  the \nimplementation and positive impact of all the physical improvements under NERCCDIP.23 The \nparticipation of the city residents, including the women, the poor, the slum communities, and \nother vulnerable groups, in program implementation and their equal sharing in its benefits will be \nensured.  \n \n31.  Improved  Capacity  to  Manage  NERCCDIP.  This  component  will  provide  funding \nsupport for costs associated with NERCCDIP management and implementation, including the \nincremental administrative and operating costs of program management units in MOUD and the \nstates, equipment, logistics, and the services of consultants who will assist these units in \nmanaging NERCCDIP and carrying out detailed design and construction supervision. Such \nsupport is considered essential to the implementation of NERCCDIP in view of the proposed \nexecuting  agencies\u2019  lack  of  experience  with  undertakings  of  this  size,  and  implementation \nthrough separate design and construction contracts.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n32.  Planned and Integrated Approach to City Development. The design of NERCCDIP \nbenefits from a planned approach. Long-term investment requirements were identified, and \nNERCCDIP and subprojects designed, on the basis of city growth strategies and infrastructure \nmaster  plans.  NERCCDIP  also  follows  the  principle  of  integrated  provision  of  urban \ninfrastructure and services to harness synergies and realize the full potentials from individual \nsector improvements.  \n \n33.  Reform Orientation: Urban Governance, Finance, and Service Delivery Reforms. In \nsupport of the Government\u2019s urban policy NERCCDIP will combine infrastructure improvements \nwith reforms intended to make service delivery more efficient, sustainable, and equitable. In \nparticular, it will (i) support the establishment and promotion of ULBs in NER, (ii) enhance \nefficient and self-sustainable service delivery through the gradual introduction of dedicated \nservice delivery entities in water supply and sewerage, and (iii) create sustainable revenue \nsources by rationalizing service charges and taxes. The NERCCDIP focus will be on operating \nefficiency, sustainability, and accountability rather than pure commercialization or private sector \nprovision  of  infrastructure.  Until  revenue  levels  are  enough  to  cover  O&M  and  asset \ndepreciation and financing costs, private sector participation (PSP) is envisaged to be limited to \neither (i) short-term service contracts, to reduce non-revenue water, among other objectives; or \n(ii) medium-term management contracts for certain service operations, to improve efficiency. \nThe forms and details of PSP will be worked out through a study under the NERCCDIP. \n \n                                                \n22  In addition to the introduction of appropriate financial management systems, the activities may include, among \nothers, energy and non-revenue water reduction programs, environmental audits, introduction of management \ninformation systems, and quality assurance and quality control. \n23  The  civic  awareness  activities  will  stimulate  demand  for  improved  urban  infrastructure  and  services  by \n(i) disseminating information on the scope and nature of the improvements; (ii) educating the people on the link \nbetween the environment and health, the benefits to be derived from the interventions, and their role in and \nresponsibility for good environmental practices in solid waste and septic management; and (iii) raising awareness \nof the cost implications of improved services. \n ", "10 \n34.  Climate Change Mitigation. In line with the Government\u2019s 11th Plan objectives and \nADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020),24 NERCCDIP will seek to \nidentify  opportunities  for  environmental  improvement  and  climate  change  mitigation.  It  will \ntherefore  promote  improvements  in  urban  sanitation  and  a  reduction  in  fugitive  methane \nemissions by providing treatment systems for sewage and biodegradable waste. Opportunities \nhave been identified and a preliminary assessment of carbon emission reduction has been \nmade to estimate the impact of the proposed composting and wastewater treatment subprojects \nand financing possibilities (Supplementary Appendix C). \n \nD.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n35.  The cost of the entire investment plan for water supply, sewerage and sanitation, and \nsolid waste management in the five capital cities of NER for the next 20 years is estimated at \n$1.1 billion.

Section D14/BP: Multitranche Financing Facility. \nManila), the MFF will extend several loans to finance a range of subprojects under NERCCDIP, subject to the \nsubmission of a related periodic financing request (PFR) by the Government and the execution of the related loan \nand project agreements. ", "11 \nagreement (FFA). A minimum amount of $30 million is proposed for periodic financing requests \n(PFRs). The proposed ADB loans under the MFF will finance civil works, equipment, consulting \nservices,  and  capacity-building  costs.  All  the  provisions  of  the  ordinary  operations  loan \nregulations applicable to London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)\u2013based loans dated 1 July 2001 \nwill apply to each loan, subject to any modifications that may be included in the loan agreement. \nThe Government may choose between eligible currencies and interest rate regimes for each \nloan. The specific terms of each loan will be based on the related PFR, with interest determined \naccording to ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facilities. The Government will make the proceeds of \nthe loan available to MOUD and each state, promptly and on terms and conditions acceptable to \nADB, for the implementation of NERCCDIP. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total  % \nAsian Development Bank  200.0   70.0  \nGovernment of India and state governments  85.7   30.0  \nTotal  285.7   100.0  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n37.

Implementation Arrangements  \n  1.  Investment Program Management  \n38.  The national executing agency (NEA) for NERCCDIP will be MOUD. An investment \nprogram coordination cell (IPCC) will be established in MOUD. The Government will set up a \nnational steering committee (NSC) within 3 months of the effectiveness of the first loan, to \nmonitor  the  use  of  funds  under  MFF  and  the  overall  implementation  performance  of \nNERCCDIP.  NSC  will  be  chaired  by  the  MOUD  secretary  and  will  have  as  members \n ", "12 \nrepresentatives from the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), the Ministry of Development of \nNorth Eastern Region (MDONER), the Planning Commission, and the states. IPCC will be \nresponsible for the overall management of NERCCDIP in the five cities. This team of at least \nthree administrative and financial, technical, and social and environmental officials, headed by \nan investment program manager, will (i) prepare and submit consolidated quarterly reports on \nNERCCDIP implementation progress and other matters to ADB; (ii) review the compliance of \nsubprojects submitted by the states for financing with subproject selection criteria, and submit \nPFRs  to  DEA;  (iii)  consolidate  payment  and  reimbursement  requests;  (iv)  coordinate \npolicy-related activities and ensure that actions highlighted during the quarterly NSC meetings \nare acted on; (v) prepare the overall NERCCDIP implementation plan and consolidated annual \nwork plan; (vi) coordinate training programs and allocations for each of the states; (vii) conduct \nmonitoring and evaluation to ensure compliance with loan covenants and agreed targets; and \n(viii) design and implement NERCCDIP performance management system surveys.  \n \n39.  A state executing agency25 (SEA) in each state will carry out the part of the loan falling \nunder the state government. In each state a state steering committee (SSC) and an investment \nprogram empowered committee (IPEC) will also be formed before the loan takes effect. SSC, \nchaired  by  the  chief  secretary,  will  have  the  secretaries  and  heads  of  the  departments \nconcerned as members. It will meet quarterly, review progress, provide policy guidance, advise \non necessary actions (particularly regarding the scope or cost and urban reform agenda of the \nNERCCDIP), and facilitate interagency coordination. The convening officer for the SSC will be \nthe SEA secretary for NERCCDIP. IPEC will decide on matters related to NERCCDIP that do \nnot  affect  its  scope  or cost,  including financial  and  administrative  approvals,  procurement, \ntenders, purchases, staff recruitment, post creation, consultant recruitment, land acquisition, \nand other similar matters. IPEC will be chaired by the SEA secretary, and will have as members \nrepresentatives from ULBs and the concerned departments. IPEC will meet as often as needed, \nat the request of its members.  \n \n40.  A  consolidated  state  investment  program  management  and  implementation  unit \n(SIPMIU) will be formed in each of the five SEAs.26 The SIPMIU will prepare and forward \nsubprojects for approval to SSC and MOUD and provide state-level support as part of appraisal \nbefore PFR approval. The IPEC and SSC secretary will be the SIPMIU program director.  \n \n41.  Each state investment program director must be a senior civil service officer empowered \nto make decisions. He or she will be assisted by a deputy director, also a senior civil service \nofficer, who will be responsible for overall implementation. The core supporting staff of the \n                                                \n25 The SEAs will be as follows: (i) for Meghalaya, the Urban Affairs Department; (ii) for Mizoram, the Urban \nDevelopment and Poverty Alleviation Department; (iii) for Nagaland, the Urban Development Department; (iv) for \nTripura, the Urban Development Department; and (v) for Sikkim, the Urban Development and Housing Department.  \n26  Each SIPMIU, headed by a state investment program director, will be responsible for overall management and \nimplementation, including (i) recruiting consultants and nongovernment organizations; (ii) carrying out detailed \nsurveys, investigations, and engineering designs for investment activities before starting any tendering process; \n(iii) coordinating with other government agencies and obtaining all required statutory clearances; (iv) conducting all \naspects of procurement in compliance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time); \n(v) ensuring compliance with loan and grant covenants; (vi) administering the contracts of consultants and \ncontractors, certifying payments, and preparing change orders; (vii) submitting disbursement requests to MOUD for \nforwarding to DEA and thence to ADB; (viii) maintaining project documents and submitting reports, including audit \nreports, on time to IPCC and ADB; (ix) collecting data for key indicators; (x) supervising the implementation of \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy activities (including gender-related programs); (xi) obtaining all \nnecessary  clearances;  (xii)  guiding  awareness  campaigns  and  participation  programs;  (xiii)  organizing  and \noperating state program performance monitoring systems; (xiv) reviewing and facilitating the progress of the urban \nreform action plan and compliance with loan covenants; (xv) designing and organizing capacity-building programs; \n(xvi) ensuring compliance with the design and monitoring framework and subproject selection criteria and loan \ncovenants, and targets of reform agenda; and (xvii) monitoring NERCCDIP progress at the state level, through \nbaseline and completion surveys. ", "13 \ninvestment program director and deputy director will include a senior administration officer, a \nsenior accounts officer, technical staff (in charge of various fields of engineering), a public \nrelations officer, and a management information system specialist\u2014all supported by junior staff \n(see Schedule 3 of the FFA for further details on SIPMIU's staffing). For the implementation of \nthe infrastructure components, the SIPMIU will have a number of small engineering cells with \nstaff appointed by the line departments and ULBs, where applicable. The engineering units will \ndesign, contract out, supervise, and administer work in various sectors of NERCCDIP. There \nwill also be units to implement awareness campaigns, consultations with affected persons, \nrehabilitation and resettlement, environmental management, and capacity building and training. \nThe investment program organization chart is in Appendix 5. \n \n42.  Subproject Selection Criteria and Implementation Procedure. All subprojects to be \nincluded under NERCCDIP will meet the selection criteria stated in the FFA. Each PFR will have \nbeen  technically  prepared,  financially  appraised,  and  processed  in  compliance  with  the \napplicable social and safeguard frameworks. The PFR will specify the tranche amount, the \nconversion  instruments,  the  financing  terms,  the  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan,  the \nimplementation arrangements, advance contracting, and the amount and purpose of retroactive \nfinancing.27 \n \n2.  Implementation Schedule for the Investment Program  \n \n43.  NERCCDIP will be implemented in three tranches (or more if necessary) over 7 years \n(2009\u20132015). Tranching will be based on the subproject selection criteria and on the readiness \nof subprojects in terms of land acquisition and safeguard requirements for environment and \nresettlement, technical links between components, and institutional capacity. Tranches will be \nsequenced according to the following principles:  \n \n(i)  Works  pertaining  to  emergency  repairs,  and  infrastructure  and  operational \nefficiency improvements, will be taken up in the first tranche. These include the \nrehabilitation of water supply systems, e.g., reducing leakage, introducing bulk \nand individual metering, raising awareness of water conservation and improved \nsanitation and solid waste practices, and building capacity. Tranche 1 will also \ninclude two subprojects, in water supply and in solid waste management, which \nwill serve as samples for replication in other cities in succeeding tranches. \n \n(ii)  Subprojects involving the expansion of infrastructure and services will be taken \nup in the second and third tranches as they require commitments from the states \n(e.g., regarding the availability of water sources or suitable land with necessary \nsafeguard clearances) and progress toward cost recovery for O&M to sustain \nimprovements. \n \n44.  The NERCCDIP implementation schedule in tranches is presented in Appendix 6 and a \nschedule for each of the cities is in Supplementary Appendix E. While the minimum contract \nperiod is envisaged to be 2 years, contract packages worth over $7.0 million are envisaged to \nbe implemented over 3 years. The implementation schedule for the tranches will therefore be as \nfollows:  (i)  for  tranche  1,  May  2009\u2013October  2015;  (ii)  for  tranche  2,  March  2010\u2013\nDecember 2013; and (iii) for tranche 3, December 2012\u2013December 2015. \n                                                \n27  The Government will submit to ADB, along with the PFR, the summaries of feasibility studies and engineering \ndesigns (as necessary), terms of reference for the engagement of advisers, the results of any advance actions \ntaken, and relevant economic and financial assessments. Each PFR will refer to an attached procurement plan and \nappropriate safeguard documents, including safeguard plans required under the safeguard frameworks prepared \nfor the MFF. Each PFR will confirm that the general understandings under the FFA remain true and will describe \nthe client\u2019s compliance with the undertakings. \n ", "14 \n  3.  Procurement  \n45.  Civil Works and Goods. All procurement activities will be carried out by the SIPMIUs \nfor their respective states. Procurement to be financed by the loans under MFF will conform to \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). International competitive \nbidding will be used for civil works contracts estimated at $5.0 million or more, and for supply \ncontracts valued at $1.0 million or higher. Civil works and supply contracts costing less than \nthose amounts will be procured through national competitive bidding. Equipment worth up to \n$100,000 will be procured through shopping. Before the start of any procurement under national \ncompetitive bidding, ADB and the Government will review the public procurement laws of the \ncentral and state governments to ensure consistency with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. The \nfeasibility  of  community  contracting  will  be  examined for  each  individual  case for  low-cost \nsanitation and other community works not exceeding $100,000 in value. The procurement plan \nfor the first PFR is in Appendix 7, and a preliminary procurement assessment of the SEAs and a \npreliminary procurement plan for the entire financing facility are in Supplementary Appendixes F \nand G.  \n \n46.   Procurement  packages  will  be  sized  (i)  to  suit  the  particular  nature  of  the  works \ninvolved,  (ii)  to  allow  reasonable  competition  in  the  bidding,  and  (iii)  to  optimize  contract \nadministration and management by the SIPMIUs, and enable gradual capacity building. The \nprocurement packages\u2014indicative other than for the first tranche\u2014will be further elaborated \nand updated annually by the SIPMIUs for approval by ADB. On the basis of an assessment of \nthe states\u2019 procurement capacity and experience during the implementation of the first tranche, \nADB will review the contract packages under succeeding tranches. \n \n47.  Advance  Action  and  Retroactive  Financing.  Under  each  MFF  loan,  advance \ncontracting of civil works, equipment and materials, and consultants may be requested, subject \nto eligibility according to the agreed procedures and guidelines indicated above. Except as \notherwise agreed with ADB, expenditures incurred for civil works, equipment and materials, and \nconsulting services that are eligible for advance contracting qualify for retroactive financing of up \nto 20% of the proposed amount of the loan, for eligible expenditures in each category incurred \nbefore  loan  effectiveness  but  no  earlier  than  12  months  before  the  signing  of  the  loan \nagreement.  \n     4.  Consulting Services \n48.  Design,  construction  supervision,  and  management  consultants  (DSMCs)  and \ninstitutional  development  consultants  (IDCs)  will  be  hired  by  each  of  the  five  SIPMIUs, \naccording to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \nEach  state  DSMC  team  will  be  headed  by  urban  development  and municipal  engineering \nspecialists with experience in India and abroad. The team will (i) support the SIPMIUs in \nidentifying, preparing, and appraising subprojects; (ii) ensure compliance with the subproject \nselection criteria, as well as the safeguards and other policy requirements and guidelines of the \ncentral and state governments and ADB; (iii) undertake detailed surveys and investigations, \nprepare detailed engineering designs, technical specifications, and procurement and contract \ndocuments, and supervise construction according to established good practices; (iv) support \ntechnical evaluation during the tender process and supervise the construction of the NERCCDIP \ninvestments;  and  (v)  support  the  SIPMIU  in  program  management,  awareness  and  public \nrelations activities, financial management, monitoring and evaluation, technical capacity building \nprograms, etc. The IDCs will support the SIPMIUs and government agencies (particularly ULBs \nand, where relevant, parastatals) in (i) implementing the institutional, financial, regulatory, and \noperational  reform  agenda;  (ii)  conducting  capacity-building  programs  to  improve  asset ", "15 \nmanagement; and (iii) updating action plans and strategies to meet the reform objectives. \nOutline  terms  of  reference  for  the  consulting  services  in  each  of  the  SIPMIUs  are  in \nSupplementary Appendixes H and I. \n \n49.  The  IPCC  will  be  supported  by  a  team  of  program  management  and  monitoring \nconsultants  (PMMCs),  comprising  urban  management  and  finance  and  management \ninformation  systems  specialists,  and  headed  by  an  urban  development  and  municipal \nengineering expert with extensive experience. The central PMMC team will (i) support the IPCC \nin MOUD in program coordination by monitoring and reporting regularly on progress, identifying \nimplementation  bottlenecks,  and  recommending  corrective  actions;  (ii)  review  subproject \nappraisal  reports  prepared  by  the  SIPMIUs,  and  support  the  IPCC  in  preparing  PFRs  for \nsubmission to DEA; and (iii) support IPCC in capacity building. The consultants will also be \nrequired to assist the IPCC in implementing the urban reform plan and undertaking relevant \nstudies, establishing systems, and preparing strategy and action plans for the solid waste \nmanagement and PSP packages. The services of both nongovernment organizations (NGOs) \nand community-based organizations are also likely to be needed to support civic awareness \nraising, community-level solid waste management, and resettlement monitoring. Outline terms \nof reference for the PMMC services are in Supplementary Appendix J. \n \n50.  It is estimated that a total of 1,985 person-months of national consulting services in \nproject management and in design and construction supervision, and 549 person-months of \nnational expertise in institutional development, will be required over the NERCCDIP period.28 \nThe specific number of consultants deployed at any point in time will depend on the work \nrequirements, but it is estimated that, on average, 5\u20136 consultants will be deployed at the \ncentral IPCC and 10\u201312 consultants in each of the five state DSMCs at any one time. For \nconsulting  contracts  valued  at  $100,000  and  above,  the  selection  will  be  quality-  and \ncost-based.  For  consulting  contracts  below  that  amount,  least-cost  selection  or  individual \nrecruitment will be followed. The need for consulting services is expected to decline gradually as \nSEAs gain more capacity during implementation, and will be reviewed during the MFF midterm \nreview.  \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n51.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  states.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to examine and review, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nInvestment  Program. In  this  regard,  investigation  of government  officials,  if  any,  would  be \nrequested by ADB to be undertaken by the Government. To support these efforts, relevant \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the bidding \ndocuments  for  the  Investment  Program.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection with NERCCDIP shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of the executing agencies and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Investment Program  \n \n52.  To supplement the policy, these following specific measures are included: (i) information \ntechnology  will  be  used  to  increase  transparency,  accountability,  and  efficiency,  through \n(a) public disclosure of NERCCDIP information through government and program websites (to \nbe prepared), and (b) an expedited program of e-governance in the states; (ii) communities will \nparticipate in state steering committee decisions, and the minutes of meetings will be disclosed \n                                                \n28  In  addition,  support  staff  will  be  hired  for  project  management,  design,  and  construction  supervision \n(1,386 person-months), and for services in support of the IDCs (640 person-months). \n ", "16 \nto the public through the program webpage; (iii) independent procurement and performance \naudits, commissioned by MOUD, will be carried out as often as necessary, and at least once \nbefore the NERCCDIP midterm review; (iv) fiduciary issues will be reviewed; and (v) the Right to \nInformation Act 2005 (RTI Act), the Prevention of Corruption Act (1998), and the Service Rules \nand Codes of Conduct of Public Officials will be strictly applied in all the five states, thus \nempowering  departments  to  investigate  the  conduct  of  their  officials,  and  to  investigate \nallegations of corruption, through internal vigilance offices or state equivalents of the Central \nBureau of Investigation, and take legal action if required. \n \n6.  Disbursement \n \n53.  Loans will be disbursed according to ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as \namended from time to time). Immediately after the first loan takes effect, the Government will \nopen and maintain a first-generation imprest account (FGIA) in the account of the controller of \naid accounts and audit of the Reserve Bank of India in Delhi to ensure the timely release of loan \nproceeds and expedite implementation. The FGIA will be denominated in US dollars. Imprest \naccounts will be opened separately for each PFR.29 The advance to be paid into the FGIA will \nbe equivalent to 6 months\u2019 estimated expenditure or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is \nlower.  The  initial  advance  or  replenishment  by  ADB  into  the  FGIA  will  be  converted  into \nequivalent rupees by the controller of aid accounts and audit according to Reserve Bank policy, \nand transferred in rupees to each of the states through the budget. \n \n54.  Concurrently,  second-generation  imprest  accounts  (SGIAs)  may  be  opened  in  a \ncommercial bank by the governments of Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, and Tripura, \nsubject to the commitment by each of these governments and urban departments, as SEAs, to \nadhere to ADB procedures for operating the SGIA. The governments will assure ADB that all \nADB  disbursements  for  imprest  advance  or  replenishment  will  be  passed  on  to  urban \ndevelopment departments for deposit into the commercial-bank SGIAs within 30 calendar days \nof receipt of the advance or replenishment from ADB. The amount to be deposited initially into \neach SGIA account will not exceed the state\u2019s estimated expenditure for the first 6 months of \nprogram implementation or 10% of the loan amount allocated to the state, whichever is lower. \nThe SIPMIUs will warrant that funds in each of the SGIAs will be used only to fund eligible \nexpenditures  according  to  the  terms  of  the  loan  agreements  and  to  meet  the  immediate \nshort-term  disbursement  requirements  of  the  loans.  Both  the  FGIA  and  the  SGIA  will  be \nestablished, managed, and liquidated according to the guidelines in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook. The NERCCDIP funds flowchart is in Appendix 8. The statement of expenditures \n(SOE) procedure will be adopted in reimbursing and liquidating SGIAs for eligible expenditures \nnot exceeding $100,000 per payment.  \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n55.  The IPCC and each of the SIPMIUs will maintain separate project accounts for each \nPFR according to generally accepted accounting principles, for all NERCCDIP expenditures, \nwhether funded out of loan proceeds or other sources. Separate records will be established and \nmaintained for works, goods, and services financed out of loan proceeds.  \n \n56.  The  central  and  state governments  will  cause  their respective  project  accounts,  as \nmaintained by the IPCC and the SIPMIUs, to be audited by independent auditors, whose \nqualifications,  experience,  and  terms  of  reference  must  be  acceptable  to  ADB.  State \ngovernments  will  submit  their  audited  accounts  to  MOUD  for  endorsement  and  further \n                                                \n29  Charges associated with opening and maintaining imprest accounts will be financed by the Government.  ", "17 \nsubmission to ADB within 9 months of the end of the fiscal year.30 This period will be reviewed \nduring the midterm and may be subsequently reduced to 6 months. The annual audit report will \ninclude the audit of the central imprest account, the SGIA, and the SOE procedure, and will \nspecifically include a separate audit opinion on the use of the loan proceeds, the operation of \nthe SGIA, and compliance with SOE procedures. MOUD and the states have been made aware \nof ADB\u2019s policy regarding delayed submission, and ADB\u2019s requirements for satisfactory and \nacceptable audited accounts. \n \n8.  Investment Program Performance Monitoring and Review    \n \n57.  IPCC in MOUD will establish an investment program performance monitoring system \nacceptable to ADB within 3 months of the effectiveness of the first loan under MFF, including \n(i) data  collection  and  reporting  procedures;  (ii)  performance  indicators  relating  to  physical \ninfrastructure, capacity development, and program management support, including those in the \ndesign  and  monitoring  framework  (for  individual  loans  and  the  overall  NERCCDIP);  and \n(iii) corresponding  target  dates,  including  those  for  institutional  and  financial  reforms  and \ncapacity building. The IPCC will help the SIPMIUs set baseline values for each of the indicators \nand conduct annual surveys to update these baseline values. \n \n58.  The IPCC will provide ADB with quarterly progress reports informing ADB of overall MFF \nprogress (subproject and tranche preparation and approval) and the implementation progress of \nongoing  individual  loans.  The  reports  should  consolidate  the  quarterly  reports  prepared \nseparately by the SIPMIUs and provide summary financial accounts of NERCCDIP, including \n(i) a summary financial account for each of the states, (ii) expenditures to date, (iii) a benefit \nmonitoring report, and (iv) a safeguard compliance report. Within 3 months of the physical \ncompletion of each loan, the IPCC will also submit to ADB a completion report covering the \ndetails of project implementation, costs, monitoring and evaluation, safeguard compliance, and \nother information requested by ADB. An ADB program inception mission will be fielded soon \nafter MFF approval, and regular review missions for each loan will be held at least every \n6 months. In addition, an MFF midterm review will be conducted in 2012 for NERCCDIP. \n \nIV.  INVESTMENT PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACT, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Economic Analysis \n59.  NERCCDIP  consists  of  13  clearly  defined  projects  in  the five states,  which  will  be \nfinanced  by  ADB  with  several  sequenced  loans.  All  13  projects  were  appraised  by  ADB \ndue-diligence missions. A \u201cproject economic analysis\u201d for each of the 13 projects was therefore \ndeemed appropriate.31 The economic analysis covered (i) the macroeconomic context, (ii) the \nsector context, (iii) the justification for public intervention, (iv) demand analysis, (v) the project \nrationale, (vi) project alternatives, and (vii) project costs and benefits. The development of basic \nurban infrastructure in NER supports the Government\u2019s economic policies, such as the \u201clook \neast\u201d policy of establishing closer economic relations with the rest of South Asia and with East \n                                                \n30  This exceptional consideration, based on ADB. 2001. Project Administration Instructions. PAI 5.09: Submission of \nAudited Project Accounts and Financial Statements. Manila (revised January 2009, para. 17), is dictated by the \nlarge number of stakeholders involved, the weak capacity of the five SEAs, and the need to introduce both SEAs \nand the NEA to ADB\u2019s requirements.     \n31 Since this is a project loan, the scope of this economic analysis is governed by ADB. 2006.

Project sustainability was assessed by \nestimating the financial internal rate of return in the financial analysis. \n ", "18 \nAsia through the NER, and a number of regional trading agreements since 1992. The economic \nrationale for government intervention is justified, since all the projects support basic public \nservices,  with  monopolistic  conditions,  externality  management,  and  impact  on  income \ndistribution. Targeting less-developed regions like the NER supports the 11th Plan objective of \n\u201cfaster and more inclusive growth,\u201d given the increasing disparities between states, between  \nregions within states, between urban and rural areas, and between various sectors of the \ncommunity, resulting from inequitable share in growth.  \n \n60.  The projects are intended to (i) overcome gaps between service demand and supply, \nand  (ii) reduce  the  cost  associated  with  providing  inadequate  services.  An  emphasis  on \nincreasing efficiency in infrastructure and systems has given rise to least-cost designs for each \nproject. All the projects demonstrate an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) above the \neconomic opportunity cost of capital of about 12%; all are therefore economically viable. The \nsensitivity analysis indicates that the EIRRs are sensitive to a reduction in the realized benefits \nand that the planned coverage of services must be achieved to realize higher economic benefits. \nThe economic analysis is presented in Supplementary Appendix L. \n \nB.  Financial Management Assessment and Financial Analysis \n \n61.  The  financial  management  assessment  revealed  that  the  asset  owners,  after \nconstruction, will not have enough operating income to meet operating expenses. To improve \ntheir financial base, there will be a need for institutional reforms including (i) property tax base \nincrease, reassessment, mapping, and computerization; (ii) a gradual increase in user charges; \nand (iii) improvements in collection efficiency. An indicative financial improvement action plan \nfor achieving these reforms, which the state governments in the NER have approved, is shown \nin the financial analysis (Supplementary Appendix M). It provides specific figures for introducing \nnew user charges, increasing tariffs, widening service coverage, and improving tariff collection \nefficiency. State agencies and ULBs now use cash-basis accounting, which does not provide an \naccurate picture of their assets (including receivables) and liabilities. Further, asset recording, \nphysical  verification,  and  reconciliation  with  records  is  not  kept  current  because  staff  are \noverworked and also lack the necessary skills. To strengthen financial management capacity \nand work efficiency, accountants from relevant state departments and asset owners will be \ntrained  in  budgeting,  financial  information  management  and  reporting,  accrual-based \ndouble-entry accounting, and the use of information technology.  \n \n62.  The financial sustainability of all 13 projects was assessed according to ADB\u2019s financial \nmanagement  and  analysis  procedures. 32  For  revenue-generating  sectors\u2014water  supply, \nsewerage, and solid waste management\u2014incremental revenue and cost due to the subprojects \nwere estimated on a with-project and a without-project basis. To meet the objective of the \nfinancial improvement action plan of achieving full O&M cost recovery within the NERCCDIP \nimplementation period, water supply, sewerage, and solid waste management tariffs must be \nincreased. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) ranges from 3.1% to 14.7% for water \nsupply projects, is negative for all sewerage projects, and ranges from 3.0% to 41.7% for solid \nwaste management projects. Water supply and solid waste management have an estimated \nFIRR above the weighted average cost of capital of 2.88%. Despite the negative FIRR for all \nsewerage projects, revenues will cover O&M expenditures. Sensitivity analysis shows generally \nrobust FIRRs, showing them to be highly sensitive to an increase in revenue. In other words, to \nobtain desirable returns on investment, coverage and revenue must increase. \n                                                \n32 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila.  ", "19 \nC.  Poverty Reduction and Social Development  \n63.  NERCCDIP will have positive impact on the poor. Safe drinking water is a basic need, \nyet it is not easily accessible to significant numbers of poor people in the cities. NERCCDIP will \nreduce the burden of water collection now placed on vulnerable segments of the population, \nparticularly the women. Free water connections and lifeline tariffs will enable the poor to afford \ndrinking water. Improvements in sewage treatment, sanitation, and solid waste management will \nlead to public health improvements, resulting in a reduced burden of disease\u2014treatment costs \nand  productivity  losses\u2014experienced  to  a  higher  degree  by  the  poor.  Low-cost  sanitation \nfacilities will be pilot-tested in poor areas, and waste collection will be undertaken through NGOs \nin slums and poor neighborhoods that are inaccessible to vehicles. Program components will \nalso  create  jobs  for  the  poor.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in \nAppendix 9. \n \n64.  Women\u2019s  issues  were  considered  in  the  program  design.  Stakeholders  involved  in \nwomen  and  gender  affairs,  e.g.,  female  councilors,  self-help  groups,  NGOs,  and  other \ninstitutions, were consulted. Because of women\u2019s primary role in household management and \nwater collection, the lack of basic urban infrastructure and services has greater impact on \nwomen\u2014their health, well-being, and participation in productive activities\u2014than it has on men. \nNERCCDIP will have a major positive impact on women. A gender action plan (Supplementary \nAppendix N) will further mainstream gender issues in subproject design, implementation, and \nmonitoring. \n \nD.  Social and Environmental Safeguards \n \n65.  Social. The Program is designed to minimize land acquisition and resettlement impact. \nRehabilitation subprojects will be carried out within the existing facilities\u2019 premises and will not \ninvolve any land acquisition or resettlement. Subprojects involving the construction of water \nsupply, sanitation, and sewerage systems, and solid waste management improvements are \nproposed on government land wherever possible. The overall impact will be further minimized \nthrough  careful  subproject  siting  and  alignment  during  detailed  design  and  subproject \nimplementation.  To  ensure  compliance  with  the  Government\u2019s  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  and \nrequirements for involuntary resettlement, a resettlement framework was prepared on the basis \nof  national  laws\u2014the  Land  Acquisition  Act  of  1894  (amended  in  1984)  and  the  National \nRehabilitation and Resettlement Policy of 2007\u2014as well as state laws and regulations33 and \nADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995, as amended from time to time). The resettlement \nframework, outlining the objectives, policy principles, and procedures of land acquisition (if \nrequired), compensation, and other assistance measures for affected persons, will guide the \nimplementation of subprojects. The resettlement framework is summarized in Appendix 10 and \npresented in full in Supplementary Appendix O. Resettlement plans based on the resettlement \nframework will be prepared for program subprojects. Subprojects with significant34 impact will \nrequire full resettlement plans, while subprojects with insignificant impact will require short \n                                                \n33  The relevant state laws are: (i) for Agartala: the Tripura Municipal Act of 1994 and the Tripura Land Revenue and \nLand Reform Act of 1960; (ii) for Aizawl: the Mizoram Prevention of Government Land Encroachment Act of 2001 \nand the Mizoram Urban and Regional Development Act of 1990; (iii) for Gangtok, the Sikkim Urban and Regional \nPlanning Development Act of 1998 and the Sikkim Land (Requisition and Acquisition) Act of 1977; (iv) for Kohima, \nthe Nagaland Land (Requisition and Acquisition) Act of 1965, the Nagaland Eviction of Persons in Unauthorized \nOccupation of Public Land Act of 1971, the Nagaland (Ownership and Transfer of Its Land Resource) Act of 1990, \nand the Nagaland Town and Country Planning Act of 1966; and (v) foor Shillong: the Meghalaya Town and Country \nPlanning Act of 1973. \n34 Resettlement is significant when 200 or more people experience major impact. The impact is major when it \nphysically displaces the affected people from housing or causes them to lose 10% or more of their productive, \nincome-generating assets. \n ", "20 \nresettlement  plans.  The  resettlement  plans  will  ensure  that  the  socioeconomic  conditions, \nneeds,  and  priorities  of  vulnerable  groups  are  recognized  and  that  the  process  of  land \nacquisition and resettlement does not disadvantage vulnerable groups.  \n \n66.  In all cities, initial screening for impact on indigenous peoples showed no impact. In the \nurban program areas of Agartala, Aizawl, and Gangtok, where scheduled tribes do not form a \nmajority of the population, the groups are no different from other groups in their social, cultural, \neconomic, and political characteristics. In Kohima and Shillong, where scheduled tribes are \nstrongly attached to natural resources, habitats, and ancestral territories, they compose the \nmainstream or dominant society, and the urban areas are socially, culturally, economically, and \npolitically homogeneous. NERCCDIP will result in environmental and public health benefits for \nthe whole program population. The likelihood that subprojects will affect indigenous peoples is \nsmall;  resettlement  plans  address  the  likely  impact.  Further,  subproject  design  prioritizes \nrehabilitation over new construction of basic social infrastructure, avoiding land acquisition and \nconsequent  resettlement,  and  subproject  siting  in  built-up  areas.  An  indigenous  peoples \ndevelopment framework (IPDF) has been formulated (Supplementary Appendix Q) to ensure \nthat appropriate indigenous peoples development plans or specific actions enable equal sharing \nof NERCCDIP benefits should a future subproject have impact on indigenous peoples. \n \n67.  Environmental Safeguards. NERCCDIP is designed to improve environmental quality \nand  living  conditions  in  urban  areas  through  the  provision  of  basic  urban  services.  Initial \nenvironmental examinations (IEEs) show that net subproject environmental benefits are positive \nand extensive, and include (i) reduced water pollution as a result of investments in sanitation, \nsewage treatment, and municipal solid waste management facilities; (ii) increased availability of \npotable water at appropriate pressure from water supply subprojects; (iii) better public health, \nincluding reduced waterborne and infectious diseases, through improvements in water supply \nand sewage treatment, and municipal solid waste management investments; and (iv) improved \naesthetics from the improvement of sewage treatment and municipal solid waste works. \n \n68.  The potential negative environmental impact is mostly localized and temporary, and \nmostly  related to  dust, noise,  and  disruptions  in  access  due  to  construction  activities  and \nconstruction-related  waste  disposal.  Such  impact  can  largely  be  avoided  through  proper \nsubproject design (particularly in siting), or mitigated through proper mitigation measures and \nenvironmental management (Appendix 11).  \n \n69.  Environmental  subproject  selection  criteria  will  further  ensure  that  any  adverse \nenvironmental impact is not significant or permanent. An environmental assessment and review \nframework  has  been  developed  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  policies,  guidelines,  and \nrequirements  of  the  Government  and  ADB,  and  to  guide  the  implementation  of  future \nsubprojects (Supplementary Appendix R).  \n \nE.  Risks \n \n70.  The main risks identified are: (i) potential public resistance to water metering, (ii) low \nconnectivity for the sewerage component, (iii) lack of state actions to implement the institutional \nand financial reform agenda, (iv) public refusal to pay for the services, and (v) slow program \nimplementation  due  to  the  states\u2019  unfamiliarity  with  ADB  procedures  and  the  difficulties \nassociated with acquiring land for subproject implementation. NERCCDIP will mitigate the risks \nthrough  a  number  of  measures.  Civic  awareness  programs  will  stimulate  demand  for  the \nimproved services and make the public more willing to pay the higher tariffs. Regulations will be \nissued to enforce connection to improved services. The risk of destruction from earthquakes \nand landslips was addressed at the feasibility stage through the mapping of earthquake faults, ", "21 \nslip lines, and landslip hazard areas and the design of the various components to include \nprotection  from  damage.  Other  measures  building  on  the  initial  designs  (such  as  detailed \ngeotechnical surveys) will be incorporated during detailed design. \n \n71.  NERCCDIP assumes (i) a stable political environment and positive economic growth, \nand  (ii)  a  commitment  by  all  institutions  (modern  and  traditional)  to  participate  actively  in \nplanning and development. SIPMIUs will regularly brief ADB on the progress of each package, \nimmediately highlighting any security-related disruption. The following mitigation measures will \nbe implemented: (i) careful and continuous monitoring of security developments; (ii) balanced \nrecruitment of qualified staff from within and outside the states; (iii) complete participatory and \ntransparent implementation, including the disclosure of financial information; (iv) mobilization of \nstrong community support and trust in project staff; and (v) encouragement of local employment, \npossibly through joint ventures. \n \n72.  The  risk  of  slow  program  implementation  is  being  addressed  from  several  angles, \nincluding  (i) the  early  training  of  program  directors  and  other  key  SIPMIU  staff  in  project \nimplementation, (ii) early support through the ongoing project implementation and capacity \ndevelopment TA,35 (iii) the early appointment of project management consultants, and (iv) the \nproposed establishment of an ADB extension office in the NER.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \nA.  Framework Financing Agreement Undertakings\n \n73.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government of India and the governments of \nthe states have given the following assurances, which will be incorporated into the FFA as well \nas the individual loan and project agreements as applicable, subject to any amendment to be \nmutually agreed on by ADB, on the one hand, and the Government of India and the state \ngovernments, on the other. \n \n(i)  The Government of India will ensure that the facility funds are utilized effectively \nand efficiently to implement NERCCDIP and achieve its objectives.  \n(ii)  States will implement the urban institutional, finance, regulatory, and operational \nreform program (Appendix 12) in accordance with the time frame set in the action \nplan. \n(iii)  Empowered  committees  and  SIPMIUs,  headed  and  staffed  by  officers  with \nsuitable qualifications and experience who are acceptable to ADB, will be in \nplace in each state throughout NERCCDIP. \n(iv)  The Government of India and the states will ensure that adequate funds are \nprovided to meet any shortfall in financing for the O&M of assets created under \nNERCCDIP. \n(v)  Prior to any investment in the augmentation of water supply in any of the capital \ncities, the city concerned will have approved a plan for increased investments in \nsewerage and sanitation. \n(vi)  The Government of India and the states will ensure that all land and right-of-way \nrequired  for  NERCCDIP  are  made  available  in  a  timely  manner,  adequate \ncompensation is provided prior to the signing of the relevant civil works contracts, \nand involuntary resettlement is carried out in accordance with the resettlement \nframework and the resettlement plans agreed on by the Government of India and \nADB, the Government\u2019s National Policy on Resettlement and Rehabilitation, and \n                                                \n35  ADB. 2006.

Manila.  \n ", "22 \nADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995),  and  applicable  laws  and \nregulations of the Government of India and the States. A resettlement plan will be \nprepared for each subproject that involves land acquisition or resettlement and \nsubmitted to ADB for review and approval prior to the award of any related civil \nworks contracts.  For  sample  subprojects,  updated  resettlement  plans will  be \nprovided to ADB for review and approval following detailed design and prior to \nthe award of civil works contracts. \n(vii)  The Government of India and the states will ensure that all subproject facilities \nare designed, constructed, operated, and implemented in accordance with the \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  procedures  and  IEEs  for  core \nsubcomponents agreed on by the Government of India and ADB, and with the \nGovernment\u2019s  environmental  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment \nPolicy (2002). Any adverse environmental impact arising from the construction, \noperation,  and  implementation  of  subcomponent  facilities  will  be  minimized \nthrough  environmental  mitigation  and  management  measures,  and  other \nrecommendations  specified  in  the  environmental  assessment  reports  (e.g., \nIEEs). The Government of India will ensure that environmental requirements are \nincorporated in the bidding documents and civil works contracts. Bid documents \nwill be issued after review and clearance of the IEE or the environmental impact \nassessment by ADB and the state environmental impact assessment authority or \nthe Ministry of Environment and Forests. The Government of India will prepare \nand submit annually to ADB an environmental monitoring report that describes \nprogress in the implementation of the environmental management plan and the \nenvironmental assessment and review plan, issues encountered, and measures \nadopted, and compliance with the relevant assurances and loan covenants.  \n(viii)  The Government of India and the states will ensure that subprojects do not \nnegatively impact vulnerable groups, such as indigenous peoples. In the event \nthat indigenous peoples are involved in any of the subprojects, the Government \nand the states will ensure that the subprojects are carried out in accordance with \nthe IPDF agreed on by the Government of India and the states and ADB, with \nADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) and India's and the States' laws and \nregulations. \n(ix)  The Government of India and the states will ensure that all civil works contractors \ncomply with all applicable labor laws, including those on occupational health and \nsafety, equal pay for men and women for work of equal value, and do not employ \nchild labor as defined in national legislation for construction and maintenance \nactivities. \n(x)  The  states  will  take  all  appropriate  and  necessary  measures  to  encourage \nadequate representation of all sections of society in ULBs. \n(xi)  In cities receiving funds from the water and sewerage facility, the state or the \nULB in charge of service delivery will make information on water and affluent \ntesting publicly available. \n(xii)  The Government of India and the states will comply with the gender action plan \nagreed on by the Government and ADB. \n(xiii)  The Government of India and the states will ensure that all subprojects meet, to \nthe satisfaction of ADB, the selection criteria and implementation arrangements \nand procedures specified in the FFA.  \n \nB.  Conditions for First Loan Effectiveness \n \n74.  The following conditions for the effectiveness of the first loan will apply: \n  ", "23 \n(i)  MOUD will establish the investment program coordination cell with one full-time \ninvestment program manager and three key staff. \n(ii)  The Government will establish the national steering committee. \n(iii)  Each  state  will  establish  the  state  investment  program  management  and \nimplementation units comprising the state program director and key staff with \nsuitable qualifications and experience acceptable to ADB.  \n \nC.

The five states share an international boundary with  Bangladesh, Bhutan, \nPRC, Nepal, and Myanmar. They are often hilly, landlocked, and far from mainland markets. \nTheir economies are largely agrarian. Urbanization rates range from 11% to 50%. By 2027, the \nurban population of the states is estimated to be 30% of their total population. Urbanization is \ndominated by the capital cities, which account for over 60% of the total urban population. The \nlargest cities are Agartala (Tripura) and Shillong (Meghalaya), with populations of over 300,000. \nAizawl (Mizoram) has 230,000 people, Kohima (Nagaland) 120,000, and Gangtok (Sikkim) \n90,000. The cities had high annual growth rates in the past (over 5%); future growth rates are \nestimated to range from 1.8% to 3%.  \n \n2.  Water  and  Sanitation  Coverage  and  Service  Levels.  The  development  potential \ncreated by increasing connectivity and a productive labor force in the capital cities is hampered \nby inadequate urban infrastructure and services. Coverage is limited to a reduced number of \nbeneficiaries: the percentage of the population with access to piped water supply ranges from \n50% to 80%.1 All of the cities have a tropical monsoon climate, with rainfall that ranges from \n2,000 mm (Kohima) to 3,500 mm (Gangtok) per year. There are, however, marked differences \nin rainfall during the year, with a rainy season from June to November and a dry season the rest \nof the year, when water shortages are more acute. Non-revenue water (NRW) levels are high \n(ranging in most cities from 40% to 60%), water is supplied for 2\u20134 hours a day, schemes are \noften stretched beyond their design life resulting in operational deficiencies,2 and service does \nnot meet the required standards.3 Where pipe-borne drinking water is not available, water is \ngenerally sourced from private or public streams, dug or tube wells, public tanks, ponds, and \nchannels; however, the quality of extracted water is often compromised and seldom verified. In \naddition to limited access, water supplies are usually insufficient, particularly at the end of the \ndry season. Demand and willingness to pay for water and sanitation are nonetheless reasonably \nhigh.4 \n \n3.  All five capital cities present size and densities where sanitation is a problem. In all \ncities, the dominant mode of sanitation is a septic tank or soak pit for toilet wastes, with \nwastewaters that percolate into the soil and an overflow to the nearest drain or stream, while \nsullage wastes drain directly into the nearest drain or stream. Only Gangtok has a central piped \n                                                \n1  Agartala\u2019s coverage is around 70%, Aizawl\u2019s around 50%, Gangtok\u2019s around 80%, Kohima\u2019s 50% (of which half \ndepends on stand-post supplies), and Shillong\u2019s around 50% (but only about 44% have taps in their dwellings). \n2  Agartala\u2019s production system is reportedly operating at 50% of the total capacity, and Aizawl\u2019s at about 50%. \nGangtok is operating at 40% of its treatment capacity (lower if abstraction levels are considered). In the case of \nKohima, the treatment plant is not operating at present.  \n3  In all instances, water pressures are also below the recommended 7 meters at the consumer outlet. Water quality \nis, in many instances, not monitored often enough (in Kohima, samples are only occasionally taken and sent to \nDimapur for analysis; in Shillong, many of the tests are done off-plant; in Agartala, iron concentrations are \nsometimes above recommended levels) and does not always meet the water quality standards of the Bureau of \nIndian Standards and the World Health Organization (WHO).  \n4  Lack of adequate water supplies has created severe hardship for the population of all five cities and hampered the \ndevelopment of the cities. In Agartala, particularly in older parts of town, distribution pipes are blocked by iron \ndeposits, and supplies are restricted. In Aizawl and Kohima, where production capacity is substantially below \ndemand, and the distribution system pipelines are old and inadequate, water may be available for only a few hours \na week during the dry season. In Kohima, the shortages are so severe that private operators have begun providing \npiped water supplies in competition with the Public Health Engineering Department. Gangtok and Shillong have \nrecently  improved  their  water  production  capacity,  but  neither  city  has  carried  out  the  distribution  system \nimprovements needed to serve the population better. Although some of the traditional dorbars (tribal villages) \nsurrounding Shillong operate their own piped water supply systems, these are now under pressure from population \ngrowth and limited sources. Gangtok is perhaps the most advanced of the five cities in water supply services, \nbecause of its access to a substantially large source of water and the introduction of certain operational and \nmanagement improvements. \n ", "32  Appendix 3 \nsewer system of substantial size, but even there the present system caters to only about 12% of \nthe population.5 In Kohima, a small piped sewerage system providing only basic treatment has \nbeen constructed by the residents of Chota Basti slum community. On average, about 95% of \nthe population in program cities has access to a toilet at home or a shared toilet.6 In Agartala \nand Aizawl, most households have a toilet in their dwelling, whereas in Gangtok, Kohima, and \nShillong a fraction share toilets. About 5% of households have no access to a toilet in the \ndwelling or shared with others, and use either public toilets or defecate in the open. About 19% \nof toilets are pit latrines or dry toilets; therefore, about 24% of the population of the program \ncities use pit latrines, dry toilets, or open fields and streams. About 72% of households have \nseptic tanks or soak pits. On average, about 26% of households have their septic tanks or soak \npits emptied by vacuum trucks, while the rest empty them manually. It is common practice to \ndump the wastes into the nearest stream or drain.7 \n   \n4.  Although the levels vary, it is estimated that only 30%\u201350% of solid waste generated is \ncollected. Despite efforts, service is limited in low-income areas, slums, and inaccessible areas \nincluding  those  with  steep,  hilly  terrain.  Biodegradable  wastes  are  not  segregated  from \nnonbiodegradable wastes; the latter often contain biomedical and industrial hazardous wastes. \nNo  storage  bins  are  provided;  waste  generated  accumulates  at  the  roadside.  Manual \nmulti-handling  of  waste  continues  through  manual  loading  of  waste  into  refuse  vehicles. \nSanitation workers, at high risk to their health, often do not use personal protective gear like \ngloves dust masks. The transport fleet is often insufficient in capacity, vehicles are uncovered \nand old, and parking and garage facilities are not available. None of the cities have compost \nfacilities except for Gangtok and Shillong, and even in these towns compost marketing is a \nproblem. No sanitary landfills are available in any of the five program cities. Crude dumping and \nburning of waste is still common. \n \n5.  Water and Sanitation Sector Governance and Financial Performance. Deficiencies \nin urban systems, management, and finance are responsible for the poor infrastructure and \nservice provision. Urban local bodies (ULBs) are still at an early stage of development. Among \nthe five cities, only Agartala has a fully functioning ULB. Existing and emerging ULBs in Shillong \nand Agartala at this point are mostly in solid waste management, minor roads, drains, and water \nsupply. In Kohima, 12th Schedule functions have only partially been included in the state \nMunicipal Act and transferred to the ULB, whereas in Aizawl and Gangtok, the functions have \nfor the most part been incorporated in the Municipal Acts but are still held by the parastatal \nagencies.8  The  situation  is  further  complicated  by  conflicting  legislation  and  traditional \ngovernance structures with overlapping jurisdictions, resulting in poor service delivery. The \noperation and maintenance of water supply and sanitation (WSS) services is generally the duty \nof  public  health  and  engineering  departments,  but  these  are  traditionally  oriented  to \ninfrastructure building and do not have the capacity to deliver good service. Overly complex \n                                                \n5  The sewerage system in Gangtok suffers from several problems. One of these is lack of connectivity. Connections \nare difficult to make, given the mountainous terrain. Houses above the sewer line are relatively easy to connect, \nwhile those immediately below the sewer line often must connect farther down the hillside. Households are not \nrequired to connect to the sewer system. The main outfall line is badly deteriorated and leaking; the bottom of the \npipe has been eroded by the mix of high velocities, and the joints are of poor quality or damaged. The treatment \nplant is soon to be replaced. \n6  Toilet coverage in 2006 was 98% in Mizoram, 97% in Tripura, 86% in Nagaland, 71% in Meghalaya, and 89% in \nSikkim.  \n7  All the cities in the NER have public health rules that regulate the discharge of human wastes, but.these rules are \nwidely ignored. Although septic tank emptying services are provided by both public and private entities, there are \nno facilities for treatment. In all the program cities, the shallow groundwater table and streams are often polluted by \nwastewater,  which  is  commonly  discharged  into  roadside  drains,  exposing  the  inhabitants  of  the  city  and \ndownstream water users to the health risks that go with poor environmental sanitation. Generally, the problems are \nworse in lower-lying areas, along the rivers, and in slum and squatter communities. Wastewater percolating into the \nsoil causes the landslips that cause problems for all the hill cities, particularly Aizawl, Gangtok, and Kohima. \n8  Gangtok approved its Municipal Act in 2007, and Mizoram, in 2008. It may take some time for all functions to be \nprogressively devolved. ", "Appendix 3        33 \ndesign, high rates of NRW, and high establishment costs have raised operating costs, even as \ntariffs have stayed low. Weak accounting systems do not produce the financial information \nneeded to make sound improvement decisions. \n \n6.  The main problems facing the WSS sector are low self-financing ratios, insufficient tariff \nrecovery, and high production costs. The vast majority of urban infrastructure and services are \nfunded by the Government through the state governments. User charges and urban taxes are \nlimited. Water charges as flat and/or volumetric (Aizawl and Kohima) tariffs are levied in all \ncities, but they are far below the operating costs. No sewerage charge exists, except in Sikkim. \nSolid waste charges are being levied in Gangtok and proposed to be levied in Aizawl and \nKohima while a solid waste tax is levied as part of property tax in Agartala, and service charges \nis in place in Shillong. The gap between the residents\u2019 desire for better services and the current \nlevel of services in the cities is growing. All the cities need to develop a new tariff method to \nmeet their revised cost-recovery objectives, introduce sewerage tariffs and solid waste charges, \nand monitor financial and operating indicators quarterly. In addition to reducing NRW, they need \nto achieve progress in strengthening financial management, reducing power consumption, and \nimproving operating and institutional efficiency. The following areas must be developed: (i) asset \nmanagement, (ii) asset planning, and (iii) public utility management. Private sector involvement \nin service provision is severely limited9 by the lack of regulation, commercially oriented delivery \nsystems, and adequate tariffs. The lack of own-source revenues among the states and ULBs \ncontributes to poor operation and maintenance and the consequent low sustainability of service \ndelivery.  \n \nB.  Road Map \n \n7.  A core objective of the Government\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan (2007\u20132012) is to reduce \npoverty  and  regional  disparities  by  ensuring,  among  other,  access  to  basic  physical \ninfrastructure  and  a  comprehensive  strategy  for  better  health.10  NER,  as  one  of  the \nleast-developed regions, has been prioritized for infrastructure and social service investments. \nThe  11th  Plan  highlights  the  vital  role  of  the  capital  cities  in  NER\u2019s  socioeconomic \ntransformation. Given the difficult terrain and inaccessibility of the region, these cities perform a \nfunction of a much higher order than other cities of similar size in India. With the opening up of \ntrade with neighboring countries and the emergence of transport corridors in the region, these \ncities are expected to play an even greater role in the NER economy as commercial and \nbusiness hubs besides being administrative centers. Investments in urban infrastructure and \nservices will unleash the potential of these cities to catalyze growth in NER. The 11th Plan, as \ndid the 10th Plan before it, also stresses the importance of improving the quality of governance \nand  service  delivery  systems.  The  plans  advocate  a  two-pronged  approach  to  urban \ndevelopment that couples funds for capital investments with reforms.11 With the Jawarharlal \nNehru  National  Urban  Renewal  Mission  (JNNURM),  the  Government  has  reaffirmed  its \ncommitment  to  sustainable  urban  development.  JNNURM  looks  forward  to  fast-tracking \ninvestments in urban infrastructure in a large number of cities, subject to the cities\u2019 commitment \nto a range of reforms in line with the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1994 (CAA). \nJNNURM  also  advocates  balancing  asset  creation  with  asset  management,  incorporating \nprivate sector efficiencies into service delivery, and making ULBs financially sustainable service \nproviders.  \n                                                \n9  Other than a private composting venture in Shillong, no other activities with private sector participation are in place \nin the major urban sectors. \n10  The recently approved National Urban Sanitation Policy is an immediate result of this vision. \n11  The plans\u2019 main reference for reforms is the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1994 (CAA), which promotes \ndecentralized urban governance. The CAA enables the broadening of the role of ULBs from being mere providers \nof civic services to encompassing the wider arena of socioeconomic planning. Further, it acknowledges that \nfunctional delegation can work only if it is accompanied by financial devolution. The CAA stipulates that the states \nshould empower the ULBs to raise revenues and undertake reforms to levy user charges, enhance the property \ntax, rationalize establishment costs, and improve municipal accounting and budgeting. \n ", "34  Appendix 3 \n8.  The Government\u2019s road map and investment program derives its rationale from the \nabove development agenda and policy priorities. Its aim is to pave the way for the Government \nto attain its goal of bringing NER up to par with the developed regions of India. It intends to \naddress the urban infrastructure and service needs that continue to be a critical constraint on \nthe development of the NER cities and on the improvement of living conditions for their rapidly \ngrowing  populations.  The  road  map  and  investment  program  links  capital  investments  to \nreforms for sustainable impact. It targets those capital cities that will spearhead the repositioning \nof NER as a gateway joining India with neighboring states and the rest of South Asia, as well as \nwith Southeast and East Asia. It will provide a unique opportunity to improve environmental \nconditions in all five program cities, address problems of poor hygiene and sanitation, and \nreduce vulnerability within a disaster-prone environment. Moreover, the investment program \nseeks to provide adequate services to all, including the poor, and incorporates in its design the \ntools,  mechanisms,  and  resources  needed  to  ensure  that  the  views  and  aspirations  of \ncommunities within the program cities (often characterized by strong identities) are adequately \nreflected.  \n \n9.  Vision. The road map and investment program underpinning the North Eastern Region \nCapital Cities Development Investment Program (NERCCDIP) is guided by the Government\u2019s \npolicy  framework  and  development  priorities.  The  vision  is  to  \u201cprovid[e]  sustainable  urban \ninfrastructure and services leading to better quality of life for a population of 2.07 million people \nby 2027\u201d and thereby create more efficient and productive cities, strengthen their economy, and \nreduce  poverty.  The  road  map  and  investment  program  follows  these  principles: \n(i) simultaneously  providing  investments  in  the  five  capital  cities  that  will  spearhead  the \nrepositioning of NER as the gateway linking India to the neighboring states and to Southeast \nand East Asia, (ii) providing urban infrastructure and services to realize the full potential benefits \nof  integrated  subsector  development;  and  (iii)  linking  investments  to  reforms  for  urban \ngovernance, finance, and service delivery. NERCCDIP will meet priority investment and reform \nneeds and pave the way for the attainment of the vision for the NER capital cities.  \n \n10.  Long-Term Sector Needs and Proposed Investment Program. The assessment of \nthe  long-term  (20-year)  urban  infrastructure  and  service  improvement  needs  and  the \nprioritization exercise prepared to match the requirements of the five cities over the next 10 \nyears  are  based  on  growth  strategies  and  conceptual  infrastructure  master  plans.  The \ndemographic and physical growth of the cities and its distribution was assessed.12  \n \n11.  NERCCDIP forms part of the medium- to long-term road map for the NER capital cities. \nTo  be  implemented  over  a  7-year  period,  it  places  emphasis  on  increasing  operational \nefficiencies, carrying out pilot initiatives to test methods of service delivery, and establishing the \ninstitutional,  operational,  and  financial  foundations  and  building  capacity  for  further \nimprovements. In the 12 years after that, the systems established would be consolidated around \nthe proven approaches and operations would continue to expand to cover most urban services \nby 2027. The states will need to identify alternative sources of financing to meet the remaining \ninvestment needs. Sources include JNNURM, the Non-lapsable Central Pool of Resources, the \nMinistry of Urban Development and Poverty Alleviation (10% of funding), financial institutions, \nand private sector. \n \n                                                \n12 Conceptual master plans in the form of city development plans (http://jnnurm.nic.in/).were prepared on the basis of \ngrowth  strategies,  existing  master  plans  (where  available),  consultations  with  stakeholders,  socioeconomic \nsurveys, and an analysis of infrastructure deficiencies, demand projections, and institutional absorptive capacity to \ndevelop and sustain infrastructure assets. ", "Appendix 3        35 \nC.  Strategic Context \n \n12.  Urban development has been a key priority of the Government over the last decade. The \n11th FYP recognizes that \u201cIndian cities will be the locus and engine of economic growth over the \nnext 2 decades, and realization of the ambitious goal of 9%\u201310% growth in GDP depends on \nmaking Indian cities much more livable, inclusive, bankable and competitive.\u201d Both the 11th FYP \nand the Asian Development Bank\u2019s strategy stress (i) the existence of intra-urban, intrastate, \nand interstate differences in the level of urban services and the need for balanced development, \nand (ii) the urgency of reducing urban poverty as part of the strategy of promoting inclusive \ngrowth. Environmental protection and environmental sustainability\u2014the need to avoid water \npollution,  improve  wastewater  and  solid  waste  management  and  increase  environmental \nawareness\u2014are also deemed critical to inclusive growth. The 11th FYP remains committed to \nstrengthening  urban  governance  and  management  through  decentralization,  enhancing \naccountability, and establishing regulatory frameworks for service delivery. NERCCDIP, in line \nwith the 11th FYP targets, will set out to provide the urban populations of the capital cities of \nMeghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, and Tripura in the NER with (i) better access to water \nand sanitation, an essential Millennium Development Goal; and (ii) improved environment and \npublic health. \n \nD.  Policy Framework: Urban Institutional, Financial, and Service Delivery Reforms  \n \n13.  In accordance with the Government\u2019s urban policy framework, the road map sets a \nvision for developing urban governance, finance, and service delivery frameworks in the capital \ncities.  The  vision  entails  a  number  of  sequenced  interventions  to  (i)  advance  municipal \ngovernance and management by developing legislative and institutional frameworks for ULBs \nand enhancing their capacity for effective and accountable urban governance and management, \n(ii)  gradually  establish  efficient  and  financially  sustainable  WSS  service  providers,  and \n(iii) create sustainable sources of financing for urban infrastructure and services.  \n \n14.  ULBs and Local Governance. The road map supports the development of new ULBs in \nAizawl and Gangtok. In both instances, reforms will involve enabling recently enacted municipal \nlegislation  and  the  constitution  of  the  ULBs  in  each  of  these  cities.  Pending  elections  a \ndedicated administrative unit will be created and its organizational, staffing, and management \nsystems  will  be  developed.  Then,  from  early  2011,  the  transfer  of  functions  from  state \ngovernment to the ULBs will be fully pursued. \n \n15.  In Shillong, where there is an operating but unelected municipal board, the immediate \nefforts will be directed at transforming it into a statutory municipal body within the existing \nboundaries; the medium-term target will be establishing an urban governance framework for the \nGreater  Shillong  area.  The  process  will  involve  enabling  the  representation  of  traditional \ngovernance  structures  within  the  municipal  system,  amending  municipal  legislation,  and \ndeveloping an organizational structure, improved management systems and tools, and human \nresources for the ULB. In Kohima, where municipal legislation and an elected municipal body \nexist,  reforms  will  accelerate  municipal  capacity  building,  including  the  actual  transfer  of \nfunctions,  assets  and  financial  resources,  and  staff  to  the  municipality,  the  upgrading  of \nadministrative and management systems, and the development of ward and village structures \nand capacity according to the state\u2019s \u201ccommunitization policy.\u201d In addition, the current Municipal \nAct will undergo minor revisions in line with the CAA. In Agartala, which is the most advanced \ncity in terms of ULB reforms, efforts will be directed at providing the Agartala municipality and its \nzones  and  wards  with  adequate  administrative,  management,  and  operating  systems  and \nstaffing. In all the three existing ULBs of Agartala, Kohima, and Shillong, steps will be taken to \nbetter define the roles of the legislative and executive branches; streamline key processes such \nas those for budgeting and for financial and asset inventory and management; amend the \norganizational  structure,  e.g.,  by  creating  new  wings,  units,  or  sections;  and  introduce  a \n ", "36  Appendix 3 \npersonnel  code  of  practice  (office  administration  regulation  rules)  and  performance-based \nmanagement systems.  \n \n16.  Efficient and Sustainable Service Providers. The road map stipulates that cities will \ngradually develop ring-fenced WSS service providers focused on good-quality service delivery \nand financial sustainability. In the short term, existing state departments will be restructured into \ndivisions with dedicated responsibility for city water supply and sewerage, to be eventually \ntransformed  into  financially  viable  WSS  providers.  The  divisions  will  be  provided  with \n(i) double-entry accounting systems that can record assets, liabilities, revenues, and costs; \n(ii) management systems for carrying out in the short term a NRW reduction and metering \nprogram, later to become an asset management program, and performance-based service \ndelivery systems; and (iii) the ability to levy user charges, adjust tariffs, and retain and use funds \nfor gradual cost recovery, as well as to optimize and redistribute staff. In the medium term, \nefforts will be directed at developing well-tailored options for WSS service providers operating in \na client-oriented, cost-effective, and sustainable manner, with their own sources of funds. This \nprocess would involve (i) awareness campaigns; (ii) valuation of assets and financial modeling \nof options; (iii) proposals for the structure, functions, organization, staffing, and financial and \nhuman resource management systems for the preferred option; (iv) stakeholder consultations to \ngenerate consensus on the preferred option; (v) the passage of legislation to implement the \npreferred option; and (vi) the creation of the agency. While a number of options\u2014such as a \npublicly owned agency under the state, a community-owned agency, or an agency owned jointly \nby the state, the ULB, and the community\u2014are available, given the decentralization framework, \nring-fencing  the  WSS  operations  at  ULB  level  would  be  the  most  appropriate  option  to \ncontemplate.  \n \n17.  Appropriate arrangements would be made initially at the state level and eventually at the \nULB level for regulating the WSS service provider and any future concessionaires and for \nadvising on policy development. Due consideration will be given to the rights and roles of water \nrights holders and private and community water suppliers. In the case of Kohima, support would \nbe provided for the development of a sustainable partnership agreement between the state and \nthe water rights holders, involving compensation measures for water withdrawals based on \nmetered water consumption. \n \n18.  Municipal Finance Reforms. Institutional reforms will be accompanied with reforms to \nset in motion a system of sustainable funding. Reforms in this regard will involve the introduction \nand rationalization of user charges through (i) volumetric metering of water supplies, coupled \nwith volumetric water charges; (ii) imposition of a new sewerage service charge as a percentage \nof the water bill; (iii) levy of solid waste service charges based on the level of service provided; \nand (iv) improved collection efficiencies. The charges will be set low for basic consumption and \nincreased according to consumption level, allowing all consumers, even the poor, to afford the \nservices.  \n \n19.  The interventions will also involve reforming the property tax as a major source of local \nrevenue. The property tax will be introduced in those cities where it is not currently levied (i.e., \nAizawl, Gangtok, and Kohima) and enhanced in Agartala and Shillong. It will be set at a level \nthat generates revenues of 1%\u20132% of capital value, and the tax rate will be increased as public \nacceptance  grows.  The  property  tax  reforms  will  involve  improving  tax  administration \n(area-based methods supported by geographic information systems and computerization of \nbilling and other functions), periodically revising property tax assessment, and improving tax \ncollection efficiency. Finally, the reforms will include measures to promote the efficient and \ntransparent use of financial resources: (i) a modern, accrual-based double-entry system of \naccounting will be implemented to enable the regular issuance of financial statements on urban \noperations and the recording of all bills, state grants, fixed assets, and physical inventories; \n(ii) accounting will be computerized; and (iii) an efficient and transparent budget process that ", "Appendix 3        37 \nlinks financial targets to physical targets set as part of city investment programming will be put in \nplace.  \n \n20.  Potential for Private Participation. Under NERCCDIP, the dominant mode of service \ndelivery is government-led (ULBs, state departments, future water and sewerage agencies). \nThis is justified, as NERCCDIP is limited to basic urban infrastructure sectors in which (i) a \nnatural monopoly exists; (ii) the services and benefits are of the nature of public good; and \n(iii) the externality and interdependence of multiple sectors require integrated management. In \nthe short term, private sector participation (PSP) on a major scale is constrained by the lack of \nregulatory frameworks, commercially oriented service delivery systems, and adequate tariff \nstructures and rates that allow the private sector to have satisfactory cost recovery. However, \nthe NERCCDIP reform initiatives creating regulatory frameworks, efficient and financially viable \nservice delivery systems, and enhanced tariffs will gradually create an enabling environment for \nPSP. NERCCDIP will also finance a PSP study to examine specific components with PSP \npotential.13 The study, to be conducted in each city through adequate awareness-raising and \nparticipatory methods, will propose detailed time-bound road maps for realistic PSP in the \nsectors where potential is identified and will survey interest among potential private partners.  \n \nE.  Investment Program \n \n21.  It is estimated that over $1.9 billion will be needed over the next 20 years to meet all the \ninfrastructure requirements of the five cities, and $1.1 billion will be needed to meet essential \nservice delivery functions relating to water supply, sewerage and sanitation, and solid waste \nmanagement.14 Financial assistance from NERCCDIP to cover 26% of the estimated cost of the \noverall program is proposed.  \n \n22.  Impact and Outcome. Both the Government\u2019s investment program and NERCCDIP are \nexpected to improve the quality of life for 1.2 million people and enhance urban productivity in \nthe five capital cities by (i) making urban infrastructure and services more accessible to the city \npopulations, including the poor; and (ii) supporting urban institutional, management, service \ndelivery, and financial reforms to create an environment and capacity for sustainable provision \nof urban infrastructure and services.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nADB's strategies are aligned with India\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan. The Government continues to focus on infrastructure \ninvestment,  social  development,  and  agriculture  and  rural  development  to  make  the  growth  process  more  inclusive. \nNortheastern Region Capital Cities Development Investment Program is consistent with ADB\u2019s strategy and the Government\u2019s \n11th Plan. It will have direct impact on poverty reduction by increasing access to safe drinking water, a basic need. \nImprovements in sewerage and sanitation and in solid waste management will result in public health improvements for the \npoor, who have less access to basic urban services.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention   \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nUsing both primary (socioeconomic survey and community consultations) and secondary data (including reviews of central \nand state government programs on poverty alleviation), poverty analysis with poverty mapping was undertaken during \nprogram preparation. \n \nStatistics from the Planning Commission of India (2001) shows that the Northeast region is home to 3.1 million persons living \nbelow poverty. Official statistics quote poverty to be largely rural with 2.9 million persons in rural areas classified as poor (this \ncorresponds to a poverty headcount of 40%). While the poverty headcount is relatively low in urban areas (8% with 0.16 \nmillion persons classified as poor), due to urban population growth including the increasing rural-to-urban migration, urban \npoverty is an emerging issue. It should also be noted that the urban\u2013rural distinction in the Northeastern Region suffers from \nunclear definitions, and studies show that there are areas classified as rural, which should actually fall under the urban \ncategory. While official estimates show relatively low levels of urban poverty\u2014other definitions suggest urban poverty is likely \nto be underestimated. The socioeconomic survey undertaken in program cities show that 14% to 39% have incomes below $1 \nper capita per day. This is consistent with State estimates of poverty used for determining households who will receive \nassistance which ranges from 16% to 25% in program cities. \n \n2.  Design features  \n \nBasic urban infrastructure and services from the Program will have positive impacts on the poor. Safe drinking water is a \nbasic need which significant numbers of poor people in the Northeastern region do not have easy access to. The burden of \nwater collection on vulnerable segments of the population such as women will be reduced. Improvements in sewage \ntreatment, sanitation, and solid waste management will lead to public health improvements resulting in reductions in burden of \ndiseases\u2014treatment costs and productivity losses\u2014whose impacts are experienced by the poor in higher degrees. Low cost \nsanitation facilities will also be piloted in poor areas. Program components will also generate employment opportunities for the \npoor. \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe North Eastern Region, largely because of geographic isolation, deficient infrastructure, and low investment, has low gross \ndomestic product and few employment opportunities, and remains a highly underdeveloped region in India. Low access to \nbasic urban infrastructure and services in the region, particularly for poor segments of the population, is also detrimental to \npublic health. \n \nPrimary data show that in the program citiesa up to 60% of the poor have no access to water connections. Many depend on \npublic water sources, hand pumps, streams, and rivers for their water supply, and devote time and energy to water collection. \nMost, having very limited access to safe drinking water, apply some form of treatment before consumption. Most of the poor \nare not connected to sewerage systems and many have no access to adequate sanitation: up to two thirds rely on unsanitary \npit latrines. Up to 40% dump solid waste in open spaces or drains, for lack of collection systems. All these factors contribute to \npoor public health. Water-borne diseases such as hepatitis, diarrhea, malaria, and typhoid are common among poor \nhouseholds.  ", "                       Appendix 9      51 \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nExtensive consultations in the form of consultation workshops, meetings, FGDs, and structured interviews have been \nundertaken with the following stakeholders: beneficiary communities and affected households (including poor and other \nvulnerable households and households headed by women or indigenous persons), NGOs and CBOs, elected representatives \n(such as councilors and ministers), traditional organizations, ULBs, administrative departments, state governments, and the \ncentral Government. \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \nX  Information sharing       X  Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nExtensive information dissemination and consultations have been undertaken to ensure stakeholder participation in program \ndesign. During program preparation, it was noted that a key factor in the nonperformance of many poverty reduction programs \nis the lack of participation by the poor. A stakeholder participation framework, which engages key stakeholders in design, \nimplementation, and operation and maintenance, has been formulated for each program city. The gender action plan also \nincludes a gender-responsive participation framework, which identifies the role of women in program design, implementation, \nand operation and maintenance. \nC. Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues \n \nPrimary and secondary data have been analyzed to assess the status of women in program cities. While there are differences \nin the status of women in the different program cities, there are also common trends. In education, although female literacy is \nhigh, it is a few percentage points lower than male literacy. Unemployment is higher among women than among men, and the \ndisparity in unemployment levels increaes with lower incomes. For example, in Agartala, unemployment is 24% among poor \nfemale-headed households but only 10% in poor male-headed households. There is also a high correlation between poverty \nand the gender of the household head. Again, in the case of Agartala, women head 18% of all households but 32% of poor \nhouseholds. While day-to-day household decisions are made by women, all major decisions, such as those related to \nchildren\u2019s education, and the purchase and sale of property, are made by male members of the family.  \n \nWomen\u2019s issues and priorities were identified during program design. Stakeholders concerned with improving the status of \nwomen, including female councilors, self-help groups for women, NGOs involved in gender issues, and institutions involved in \nwomen\u2019s development, were consulted. The lack of basic urban infrastructure and services affects women more than men. \nThe burden of water collection falls on women because of their primary role in managing the household. During program \npreparation, it was noted that water collection takes an average of 4\u20135 hours per day, reducing the time women have to \nengage in productive activities that would increase the household income and improve their position within the household. \nLack of clean water supply also burdens women who handle water more than men. Women are more exposed to diseases \nfrom contaminated water in the process of collecting water, and using water in cooking and washing. A reduction in diseases, \naside from reducing treatment costs and productivity losses, would also reduce the burden of caring for sick household \nmembers, a role often taken on by women in the household. The lack of toilet facilities also has larger impact on women\u2019s \nsense of privacy. NERCCDIP responds to these issues in the design of its subprojects. In addition, it will provide enclosed \nbathing spaces as part of public sanitation subprojects, extend waste collection to unserved areas to reduce unhygienic \nconditions near homes, and involve women in water management. \n \n2.  Key Actions.

A gender action plan has been formulated to maximize program benefits for women through gender \nmainstreaming in the program and a gender-responsive participation framework. Gender mainstreaming will be done in four \nareas: awareness generation, gender sensitization, institutional arrangements, and training and capacity building. The \nparticipation framework identifies the role of women in program design, implementation, and operation and maintenance. \n \n \n ", "52  Appendix 9 \nIII.

Introduction \n1.  The  North  Eastern  Region  Capital  Cities  Development  Investment  Program \n(NERCCDIP) will improve the environment and well-being of urban residents in five capital \ncities1 in the region. It will improve and expand urban infrastructure and services in the cities, \nincluding  the  slums,  and  strengthen  the  management  and  financing  capacity  of  urban \ninstitutions. NERCCDIP will have the following outputs: (i) improved urban infrastructure and \nservices,  including  rehabilitated,  improved,  and  expanded  water  supply,  sewerage  and \nsanitation, and solid waste management facilities; and (ii) capacity building and investment \nprogram management. \n \n2.  NERCCDIP  is  designed  to  minimize  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impact. \nRehabilitation subprojects will be accommodated within the premises of existing facilities and \nwill not involve land acquisition or resettlement. Subprojects involving the construction of water \nsupply, sanitation and sewerage, and solid waste management systems will be carried out on \nvacant government land wherever possible. The overall impact will be further minimized through \ncareful subproject siting and alignment during detailed design and subproject implementation. A \nshort  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  for  the  Gangtok  water  supply  subproject \n(Supplementary Appendix G), the only subproject in tranche 1 with resettlement impact.2  \nB.  Resettlement Framework and Policy \n3.  This  summary  captures  the  salient  points  of  the  resettlement  framework  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  F.  The  resettlement  framework  outlines  the  objectives,  policy \nprinciples, and procedures of land acquisition (if required), compensation, and other assistance \nmeasures for affected persons. The resettlement framework is based on national laws (the Land \nAcquisition Act of 1894, amended in 1984, and the National Rehabilitation and Resettlement \nPolicy of 2007), state laws and regulations,3 and the Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB). These documents are compared and gaps are addressed \nin the resettlement framework.  \n \n4.  With all these in mind, core involuntary resettlement principles have been put together \nfor NERCCDIP: (i) as a policy principle, land acquisition and other involuntary resettlement \nimpact will be minimized as much as possible; (ii) any land acquisition or resettlement will be \ncarried out and compensation provided in order to improve or at least restore the income and \nliving standards of affected persons to their level before the program; (iii) affected people will be \nconsulted on compensation options; (iv) compensation will be paid for acquired assets at market \nor replacement rates; (v) compensation for lost land, housing, and assets and resettlement \nallowances will be paid in full before the contractor takes physical control of the land and any \nconstruction activities begin; (vi) resettlement assistance will be offered to affected persons \n                                                \n1  Agartala, Aizawl, Gangtok, Kohima, and Shillong. \n2  The subproject will have temporary impact from the laying of water supply distribution networks. The transect walks \nshow that disruption is minimal and can be mitigated. \n3  The relevant state laws are: (i) for Agartala: the Tripura Municipal Act of 1994 and the Tripura Land Revenue and \nLand Reform Act of 1960; (ii) for Aizawl: the Mizoram Prevention of Government Land Encroachment Act of 2001 \nand the Mizoram Urban and Regional Development Act of 1990; (iii) for Gangtok: the Sikkim Urban and Regional \nPlanning Development Act of 1998 and the Sikkim Land (Requisition and Acquisition) Act of 1977; (iv) for Kohima: \nthe Nagaland Land (Requisition and Acquisition) Act of 1965, the Nagaland Eviction of Persons in Unauthorized \nOccupation of Public Land Act of 1971, the Nagaland (Ownership) and Transfer of Its Land Resource) Act of 1990, \nand the Nagaland Town and Country Planning Act of 1966; and (v) for Shillong: the Meghalaya Town and Country \nPlanning Act of 1973. \n ", "54  Appendix 10 \nincluding non-titled persons (e.g., informal dwellers or squatters, and encroachers) before the \ncontractor takes physical control of the land and any construction activities begin; (vii) income \nwill  be  restored  and  rehabilitated;  (viii)  appropriate  grievance  redress  mechanisms  will  be \nestablished  to  speed  up  the  resolution  of  disputes;  (ix)  special  attention  will  be  given  to \nvulnerable groups; and (x) women will be involved in resettlement planning, implementation, \nand monitoring. The entitlement matrix for NERCCDIP is in Table A10.1. \n \n5.  Compensation will be paid for loss of land, structures, trees and crops, and other assets, \nat replacement cost. A valuation committee will be formed to determine replacement values. It \nwill comprise the land acquisition officer from the revenue department of the state government, \nthe resettlement officer and social development specialist from the state investment program \nmanagement and implementation unit (SIPMIU), and representatives of affected persons and \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).  Vulnerable  households  will  be  given  additional \nassistance  in  the  form  of  land-for-land  replacement  options,  preferential  consideration  in \nsubproject employment, skills and livelihood training, and income-generating assets. Short-term \nincome  restoration  activities  include  the  provision  of  short-term  allowances  such  as \n(i) subsistence  allowances  (3  months),  and  (ii)  shifting  assistance.  Medium-term  income \nrestoration activities, such as the provision of income-generating assets and longer-term training \nwill also be provided. \nC.  Procedure for Resettlement Plan Preparation \n6.  Resettlement plans for subprojects will be prepared in the following manner. SIPMIUs \nwill undertake socioeconomic surveys for each identified subproject, based on the preliminary \ntechnical design. If the impact is found to be significant,4 full resettlement plans will be prepared \nfor the subproject; if not, short resettlement plans will be prepared. The resettlement plans will \ninclude  measures  to  ensure  that  the  socioeconomic  conditions,  needs,  and  priorities  of \nvulnerable groups are identified and that the process of land acquisition and resettlement does \nnot disadvantage vulnerable groups. Social development specialists familiar with ADB policies \nand  procedures  for  the  preparation  of  subproject  resettlement  plans  will  be  among  the \nconsultants.  The  resettlement  plans  will  comply  with  national  and  state  policies,  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  other  social  safeguard  guidelines,  and  the \nresettlement framework. The resettlement plan for tranche 1 will be used as a model for the \npreparation and implementation of other subproject resettlement plans. Approval of subproject \nresettlement plans by ADB and compensation before displacement will be conditions for the \ncontracting of civil works.  \n \n7.  The Executing Agency, through the investment program coordination cell (IPCC), will \nensure  that  this  resettlement  framework  is  closely  followed  when  a  resettlement  plan  is \nformulated  for  a  subproject.  The  Executing  Agency  will  further  ensure  that  adequate \nresettlement budgets are delivered on time to SIPMIUs, and that NGOs are involved in the \ntimely implementation of the resettlement plans. \nD.  Institutional Arrangements \n8.  The Ministry of Urban Development (MOUD) will be the national EA for NERCCDIP. The \nIPCC, to be established in MOUD, will include a social officer. A national steering committee will \nmonitor fund use and overall implementation performance of NERCCDIP. A state executing \nagency will execute the part of the loan falling under each state government. \n                                                \n4  Resettlement is significant when 200 or more people experience major impact. The impact is major when it \nphysically displaces affected people from housing or causes them to lose 10% or more of their productive, \nincome-generating assets.

Consultation, Disclosure, and Grievance Redress \n10.  The  short  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  in  consultation  with  stakeholders.  Focus \ngroup discussions, meetings, and individual interviews were held with stakeholders, particularly \naffected households, and a survey was conducted to determine the potential impact of land \nacquisition.  Information  was,  and  continues  to  be,  disseminated  to  the  affected  persons. \nLocal-language versions of the resettlement framework and resettlement plans will be placed in                                     \nlibraries. The resettlement framework and resettlement plans will be disclosed on ADB\u2019s website \nand state government websites. Finalized resettlement plans will also be disclosed on ADB\u2019s \nwebsite, state government websites, and SIPMIU websites, and information dissemination and \nconsultation will continue throughout program implementation.Grievances of affected persons \nwill first be brought to the attention of the implementing NGO or the resettlement officer and \nsocial development specialist. Grievances not redressed by either will be brought before the \ngrievance redress committee (GRC) established in each state. Each GRC will comprise the \nstate investment program director, the resettlement officer and social development specialist, \nthe land acquisition officer of the state government, a representative of the implementing NGO, \n ", "60   Appendix 10 \nfemale and male representatives of the affected persons (including vulnerable households), and \nan eminent member of the community. The GRC will meet every month, determine the merit of \neach grievance, and resolve grievances within a month of receiving the complaint, failing which \nthe grievance will be addressed by the IPEC.5 Further grievances will be referred by affected \npersons to appropriate courts of law. All grievances received, including contact details of the \ncomplainant, the date the complaint was received, the nature of the grievance, the agreed \ncorrective actions and the date these were carried out, and the final outcome, will be recorded. \nF.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n11.  Resettlement plan implementation will be closely monitored to provide the Executing \nAgency with an effective basis for assessing resettlement progress and identifying potential \ndifficulties  and  problems.  Internal  monitoring  will  be  undertaken  by  the  SIPMIU.  Internal \nmonitoring  will  involve:  (i)  administrative  monitoring  to  ensure  that  implementation  is  on \nschedule and problems are dealt with on time; (ii) socioeconomic monitoring during and after \nany resettlement impact, using baseline information established through the socioeconomic \nsurvey of affected persons undertaken during subproject preparation; and (iii) overall monitoring \nto assess the status of affected persons. Job charts will be given to the resettlement officer and \nsocial development specialist. The job charts will indicate the targets to be achieved during the \nmonth.  Monthly  progress  reports  of  actual  achievements  against  the  targets  fixed  in  the \nrespective job charts and the reasons for any shortfalls will be prepared and submitted to the \nExecuting Agency. The SIPMIU will be responsible for managing and maintaining databases on \nthe affected, documenting the results of the census of affected persons, and verifying asset and \nsocioeconomic survey data to be used as the baseline for assessing the impact of resettlement \nplan implementation. The Executing Agency will appoint an independent agency to undertake \nexternal monitoring to document: (i) the restoration of income levels; (ii) changes and shifts in \noccupation pattern; (iii) changes in the type of housing of affected persond; (iv) assessment of \naffected  persons\u2019  access  to  amenities,  such  as  water,  electricity,  and  transportation;  and \n(v) performance of the NGO and the SIPMIU in resettlement implementation. The independent \nagency  will  monitor  subprojects twice  a  year  and  submit  reports  directly  to  the  Executing \nAgency, which will submit all external monitoring reports to ADB for review.  \nG.  Resettlement Budget \n12.  Detailed  budget  estimates  for  involuntary  resettlement  will  be  prepared  for  each \nresettlement plan by the SIPMIU and will be included in the overall subproject estimate. The \nbudget will include (i) detailed costs of land acquisition, relocation, and livelihood and income \nrestoration and improvement; (ii) source of funding; (iii) arrangements for approval; and (iv) flow \nof funds and contingency arrangements. All land acquisition funds will be provided by the \nExecuting Agency. Land acquisition, compensation, relocation, and rehabilitation of income and \nlivelihood will be considered an integral component of program costs. \n                                                \n5  The IPECwill be fully empowered by the state government to decide on all matters related to NERCCDIP. These \nmatters will include financial and administrative approvals; approval of procurement, tenders, and purchases; \nappointment of staff; creation of posts; recruitment of consultants; and decisions related to land acquisition. ", "  Appendix 11  61 \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \nA.  Introduction and Description of the Investment Program \n1.  The  North  Eastern  Region  Capital  Cities  Development  Investment  Program \n(NERCCDIP) envisages the achievement of sustainable urban development in the project cities \nof Agartala (in the state of Tripura), Aizawl (Mizoram), Kohima (Nagaland), Gangtok (Sikkim), \nand Shillong (Meghalaya) through investments in urban infrastructure sectors. NERCCDIP will \nsupport the Government of India and the five state governments in their policy of balanced \nregional socioeconomic development and poverty reduction through improvements in urban \ngovernance, management, and infrastructure and service provision. NERCCDIP will support \n(i) water supply; (ii) sewerage and sewage treatment; (iii) municipal solid waste management; \nand (iv) planning and design, institutional and capacity development, and awareness raising.  \nB.  Environmental Impact and Mitigation Measures \n2.  NERCCDIP is designed to improve environmental quality and living conditions in urban \nareas through the provision of basic urban services. Initial environmental examinations (IEEs) \nconducted for NERCCDIP show that net subproject environmental benefits are positive and \nlarge, and include (i) reduced pollution resulting from investments in sewage treatment and \nmunicipal solid waste management; (ii) increased availability of adequate potable water at \nappropriate  pressure  from  water  supply  subprojects;  (iii)  better  public  health,  particularly \nreduction  in  waterborne  and  infectious  diseases, through  investments in  water  supply  and \nsewage treatment, and in municipal solid waste management; and (iv) improved aesthetics from \nthe improvement of sewage treatment and municipal solid waste works. \n \n3.  There  will  be  no  adverse  cumulative  or  sector-level  impact.  The  potential  negative \nsubproject impact during construction and operation will not be significant, and most of it will be \nlocalized and temporary. Environmental subproject selection criteria will further ensure that \nNERCCDIP has no significant adverse impact on the environment.

Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n4.  The national Executing Agency (NEA) for NERCCDIP will be the Ministry of Urban \nDevelopment (MOUD). An investment program coordination cell (IPCC) will be established in \nMOUD. IPCC will be responsible for the overall management of NERCCDIP in the five cities \nand will include social and environmental safeguard specialists, who will monitor NERCCDIP \nimplementation and review and screen the subprojects submitted by the states in accordance \nwith the subproject selection criteria, including the environmental provisions. A national steering ", "  Appendix 11  63 \ncommittee (NSC) will be set up by the Government within 3 months of loan effectiveness to \nmonitor the use of funds under the multitranche financing facility and the overall implementation \nperformance  of  NERCCDIP.  A  project  management  consultant  to  IPCC  will  support  and \ncoordinate the environmental assessment and review. A state executing agency (SEA) in each \nstate will be responsible for executing the part of the loan falling under the state government.  \n \n5.  A  consolidated  state  investment  program  management  and  implementation  unit \n(SIPMIU) headed by a program director will be established in each of the five SEAs. SIPMIU \nwill oversee environment and resettlement planning for NERCCDIP. This task includes the \npreparation of all documentation needed for decision making, contracting, and supervision of \nwork, and the provision of progress monitoring information to the SIPMIU program director. The \nSIPMIU will have a safeguards and social cell staffed with an environment officer, who will \nimplement the environmental safeguard provisions including (i) ensuring that the environmental \ncriteria for subproject selection in the environmental assessment and review framework (EARF, \nalso see Table A11.2) are followed; (ii) ensuring that the mitigation requirements are included in \ncontractor bidding documents; and (iii)  coordinating with various central and state government \nagencies in compliance matters. The SIPMIU will appoint and manage construction contractors \nto  build  elements  of  the  infrastructure;  they  will  be  required  to  submit  environmental \nimplementation plans (EIPs) to SIPMIU for approval.  \n \n6.  SIPMIU  will  be  assisted  by  design,  construction  supervision  and  management \nconsultant, who will design the infrastructure, manage the tendering of contracts, and supervise \nthe construction process. An environment specialist in the DSMC team will be responsible for \naddressing  the  environmental  issues  in  the  program  components  during  design  and \nimplementation.  The  specialist  will  ensure  that  all  mitigation  requirements  are  included  in \ncontractor bidding documents and EIPs, and will supervise the effective implementation of \nenvironmental provisions during construction. In addition, the specialist will assist the SIPMIU in \nthe procurement needs and other project implementation aspects and will have a central role in \nbuilding the environmental management capacity of the SIPMIU, the contractor, and the line \ndepartments through support and training.  \n \n7.  The DSMC team will submit periodic monitoring and implementation reports to SIPMIU, \nwhich will take the necessary follow-up actions. SIPMIU will submit monitoring reports to the \nprogram  director,  who  will  then  forward  these  to  ADB.  SIPMIU  will  also  prepare  annual \nmonitoring reports for IPCC and assist the latter in preparing an annual monitoring report to the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). The annual report will focus on the progress of implementation \nof the environmental management plans, and EARF implementation, issues encountered and \nmeasures adopted, follow-up actions required, if any, and the status of NERCCDIP compliance \nwith subproject selection criteria and relevant loan covenants. IPCC will seek clearance for the \nsubmission and disclosure of the annual environmental monitoring report to ADB. \nD.  Public Consultation and Information Disclosure  \n8.  Stakeholder consultation was an integral part of the environmental assessment process. \nDuring  project  preparation,  consultations  were  undertaken  with  various  stakeholder  groups \nincluding  state  government  representatives,  elected  representatives,  nongovernment \norganizations  and  environmental  groups,  urban  residents,  and  affected  persons.  These \nconsultations  were  conducted  at  various  levels  (project,  state,  and  subproject  levels)  and \nemployed  various  methods  (socioeconomic  survey  of  5,000  households,  formal  meetings, \nindividual interviews, structured discussions, and focus group discussions). Consultations with \n ", "64  Appendix 11 \neach  of  the  five  states  were  held  in  November  2005.  Regular  and  continued  stakeholder \nparticipation at all stages of project design and implementation is envisaged.  \n \n9.  During program preparation, consultations and presentations were made to affected \npersons and the general population in the subproject sites in January and February 2006. The \nconsultations detailed potential impact due to the subprojects, and discussions were held on \nmeasures proposed in the IEEs to address the foreseen impact. The IEEs will be translated into \nthe local language and disclosed through public notices at urban local bodies and SIPMIU \noffices  through  posters  presenting  the  subproject\u2019s  environmental  impact  and  mitigation \nmeasures. These posters will be posted on state government and SIPMIU websites. SIPMIU will \nissue notices 1 month ahead of the start date of subproject implementation to create awareness \nof subproject implementation among the public. Moreover, a grievance redress cell will be set \nup within the SIPMIU to register grievances of the people regarding technical, social, and \nenvironmental aspects. This participatory process will ensure that all views of the people are \nadequately reviewed and suitably incorporated in the design and implementation process. \nE.  Findings, Recommendations, and Conclusion \n10.  IEEs  show  that  sample  subprojects  will  result  in  large  net  environmental  benefits. \nPotential  adverse  environmental  impact  is  largely  temporary  and  localized  and  can  be \naddressed  through  subproject  design  and  mitigation  measures.  No  further  assessment  on \nenvironmental impacts is required for sample subprojects.  \nF.  Environmental Selection Criteria and Environmental Review Procedures \n11.  To  ensure  compliance  with  Government  and  ADB  environmental  criteria  and \nrequirements,  environmental  subproject  selection  criteria  and  an  EARF  to  guide  the \nimplementation of future subprojects have been developed. A summary of the environmental \nsubproject selection criteria is provided in Table A11.2. \n \n12.  The full EARF, based on provisions of the Government\u2019s environmental policies and \nlegislative  provisions  and  the  environmental  assessment  criteria  of  ADB,  is  provided  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  M.  The  EARF  also  details  (i)  the  Government\u2019s  environmental \nassessment  and  review  procedures,  (ii)  responsibilities  and  authorities  involved  in \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review,  (iii)  the  compliance  of  NERCCDIP  with  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental criteria, and (iv) staffing requirements and budgets. \n \nTable A11.2: Summary of Environmental Criteria for Subproject Selection \n \nCriteria \nOverall selection criteria (applicable to all components) \n\u2022  Will avoid resettlement/relocation.

The proposed capacity development program will target two different levels of assistance: \n(i) project implementation; and (ii) a comprehensive capacity-building program to support the \naccomplishment of India\u2019s urban institutional and financial reform agenda, enhance planning and \noperation  and  maintenance,  improve  revenue  mobilization,  and  strengthen  the  financial \nmanagement capabilities of service providers. Capacity development will be undertaken at five \nessential levels or entry points: (i) enabling environment, (ii) sector capacity, (iii) organization or \nentity\u2019s capacity, (iv) individual agency employee capacity, and (v) end user or beneficiary. \n \n2.  Capacity development will require a variety of learning and development methods (formal \ntraining and seminars, study tours, on-the-job work experience, etc.) delivered by two teams of \nexperts in each state. The design, construction supervision, and management consultants will be \nresponsible for strengthening the design, management (including utility management for increased \nefficiency), and administration capabilities of key state and urban local body (ULB) staff (delegated \nto  the  state  investment  program  management  and  implementation  unit  [SIPMIU]),  while  the \ninstitutional  development  consultants  will  focus  on  implementing  essential  sector  reform \nrequirements  pertaining  to  municipal  governance  and  financial  reform  and  improved  service \ndelivery.

The  Government\u2019s  Jawarhalal  Nehru  National  Urban  Renewal  Mission  (JNNURM) \nframework signed between the five program states and Ministry of Urban Development (MOUD) \nclearly establishes the major thrusts of the urban reform program. The North Eastern Region \nCapital Cities Development Investment Program (NERCCDIP) will support the state and ULBs in \nits implementation through the formulation of (i) municipal acts or amendments to existing ones to \nensure compliance with the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1994 (CAA); (ii) government \norders/notification  of  transfer  of  functions  under  the  12th  Schedule  of  the  CAA;  (iii)  ward \ndemarcation and creation of ULB election committees; and (iv) preparation of a comprehensive \nULB staff and reporting structure, initial budgets, recruitment/redeployment and ULB capacity \ndevelopment programs.  \n \n4.  The Program will also assist the Government and its departments and later the ULB in \nachieving  sustainability  and  accountability  in  the  water  and  sewerage  sector  by  separating \nservice delivery from regulation. For this purpose, the consultants will help the Government (i) \ndrafting  applicable  acts  and  rules  and  other  supporting  legal  documents;  (ii)  designing  a \nregulatory body and institutional mechanisms; (iii) preparing operating procedures, training and \ndevelopment  of  regulation,  licenses,  and  rules;  and  (iv)  developing  a  clear  and  binding \nframework for tariff regulation.  \n \nB.
