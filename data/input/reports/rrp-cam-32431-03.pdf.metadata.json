The FSPL takes a cluster approach and consists of \nthree  back-to-back  subprograms.  Each  succeeding  subprogram \nwas \nthe \nto  be  processed  sequentially  upon  completion  of \npreceding subprogram.  \n\nTargeting classification: General intervention \nSector: Finance \nSubsector: Finance sector development \nThemes: Sustainable economic growth and governance \nSubthemes: Promoting economic efficiency and enabling markets,  \nand financial and economic governance \n \nCategory C. The environmental implications were reviewed and no \nsignificant adverse impact was identified. \n \nInvoluntary resettlement: Category C. \nImpact on indigenous people: Category C. \nNo  involuntary  resettlement  or  impact  on  indigenous  people  is \nexpected from program implementation. \n\nincluding  poverty \n\nintermediation  and \n\n \nCambodia\u2019s  financial  sector  is  at  a  rudimentary  stage  with  limited \nfinancial \nlow  public  confidence.  The \nunderdeveloped  financial  system  is  one  of  the  most  significant \nconstraints  faced  by  the  Government  in  achieving  broad-based \nsustainable  economic  growth  and  socioeconomic  development \nobjectives, \nsector \ndevelopment has been hampered by numerous constraints: (i) high \nlaw  and  contract \nrisk \nenforcement  due  to  a  weak  rule  of  law,  (ii)  high  information  costs \nstemming from lack of common accounting and auditing standards \nand other information infrastructure, (iii) high operating costs due to \nthe  absence  of  liquidity  management  mechanisms  and  other \nmarket  infrastructure,  and  (iv)  weak  supervisory  systems  and \ncapacity.   \n\nreduction.  Financial \n\nto  uncertainties \n\nregarding \n\nrelated \n\nThe  FSPL  supports  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  address  these \nconstraints and lay the foundation for financial sector development. \nA  sound,  efficient,  and  integrated  financial  system  is  crucial  for \nachieving broad-based sustainable economic growth and reducing \npoverty by increasing job opportunities, lowering transaction costs \nof  economic  activities,  and  extending  outreach  of  the  formal \nfinancial  sector  to  the  poor  and  rural  areas.  An  efficient  financial \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nObjective and Scope \n\nsystem will promote private sector development as well as foreign \ndirect investment. Further, a robust financial sector will protect the \neconomy  from  unfavorable  exogenous  shocks  that  are  becoming \nmore common in increasingly globalized financial markets.  \n\nProgress  under  subprograms  I  and  II  warrants  the  support  of \nsubprogram III.  \n\nThe  FSPL  aims  to  promote  the  development  of  a  sound,  market-\nbased  financial  system  to  support  resource  mobilization  and \nsustainable  economic  growth  by  establishing  a  foundation  for  the \nbanking and insurance industries as well as financial markets. The \nFSPL focuses on the following activities: \n \n\nEnhance  bank  intermediation  and  public  confidence  by \nestablishing  and  strengthening  banking  supervision, \ndeveloping  key  information  infrastructure  and  safety \nnets,  and  building  capacity  in  both  public  and  private \nsectors by reinforcing capacity-building institutions. \nEstablish legal and regulatory frameworks for insurance \ndevelopment  by  institutionalizing  a  supervisory  system \nand  prudential  regulations,  fostering  private  sector \ndevelopment in the insurance business, and developing \ncompulsory insurance. \nPrepare  the  foundation  for  developing  interbank  and \nmoney  markets  by  building  public-private  sector \npartnerships and establishing a basic legal framework. \nDevelop  financial  market  infrastructure  by  establishing \ncommon  accounting  standards  and  enforcement \nmechanisms,  and  promulgating \nto  underpin \ncommercial activities and financial markets.  \n\nlaws \n\n \nGiven \nsubprogram III includes the following key initiatives: \n\nthe  progress  achieved  under  subprograms \n\nI  and \n\nII, \n\nlaw,  establishing  a  public  registry \n\nEnhance  banking  infrastructure  by  adopting  a  secured \ntransaction \nfor \nsecured \nfinancial \ntransactions,  and  establishing  a \nintelligence  unit  responsible  for  anti-money  laundering \nand  combating  the  financing  of  terrorism.  This  will \npromote  and  maintain  principles  of  transparency  and \naccountability  through  the  attainment  of  international \nstandards  to  minimize  the  money  laundering  risk  by \nimplementing  a  robust  compliance  and  monitoring \nregime.  \nEnact  commercial  laws  and  building  capacity  by  (a) \nadopting \n(b) \nsubmitting an insolvency law to the National Assembly; \n(c) disseminating commercial laws via the Internet, and \nhelping  develop  commercial  law  curriculum  including \n\ncommercial  arbitration \n\nlegislation; \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n\fiii \n\nof \n\n(e) \n\nthe \n\nand \n\nregulator; \n\nthe training of judges, lawyers, and legal staff in the new \ncommercial  laws;  (d)  improving  the  framework  for  the \ninsurance  subsector  by  strengthening  supervision  and \nprudential  regulations  through  adoption  of  necessary \nthe \nprocedures  and  building  overall  capacity  of \nthe \ninsurance \nenhancing \ncompetitiveness \nby \ninsurance  market \nrestructuring  a  public  sector  insurance  company  and \ndivesting its ownership to the private sector.  \nfor \ninterbank  and  money \nPrepare \nfoundation \nthe \nmarkets  by  adopting \nlegislation  on  negotiable \ninstruments  and  payment  transactions,  implementing \nthe  negotiable  instruments  and  payment  transactions \nlaw through appropriate regulations, and training staff.  \nDevelop accounting and auditing practices by assisting \nthe  professional  association  in  training  professional \nmembers to required accreditation levels. \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nA  loan  of  SDR6,763,000  ($10  million)  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources.  The  loan  will  have  a  24-year  term\nincluding a grace period of 8 years, and an interest rate of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter.  \n\nThe  loan  will  be  released  in  one  tranche  upon  fulfillment  of  all \nspecified  tranche  conditions.  Subprogram  III  will  be  implemented \nover 18 months. \n\nfor \n\nIII.  To \n\ncoordinate \n\nsubprogram \n\nThe  National  Bank  of  Cambodia  (NBC)  will  continue  to  be  the \nExecuting  Agency,  and  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance \n(MEF)  and  the  Ministry  of  Commerce  (MOC)  the  implementing \nprogram \nagencies \nimplementation  among  government  ministries  and  agencies \nconcerned,  a  financial  sector  steering  committee  was  formed. \nChaired  by  the  NBC  governor,  the  committee  comprises  senior \nofficers  from  MEF,  MOC,  NBC,  and  other  government  agencies \nconcerned.  The  committee  will  meet  every  quarter  and  on  an  ad-\nhoc  basis  to  review  pending  issues and  propose  concrete actions \nfor their resolution, thus ensuring timely program implementation. A \nsenior  NBC  officer,  appointed  program  director,  will  continue  to \nassist  ADB,  NBC,  MEF,  and  MOC  in  coordinating  day-to-day \nprogram implementation. \n \nThe loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange \ncosts  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and \nprocured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items and \nimports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  In \nthe  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of \naccordance  with \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program \nLoans,  the  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  be  disbursed  to \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms \n \n \n\n \nProgram Period and  \nTranching \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nProcurement \n\n\fiv \n\n \nCounterpart Funds \n\n \nRisks and Safeguards \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\nfor \n\nframework \n\nthe  Program \n\nCambodia  as  the  Borrower.  No  supporting  import  documentation \nwill  be  required,  if  during  each  year  that  loan  proceeds  are \nexpected  to  be  disbursed,  the  value  of  Cambodia\u2019s  total  imports \nminus  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and \nimports  financed  under  other  official  development  assistance  is \nequal  to  or  greater  than  the  amount  of  the  loan  expected  to  be \ndisbursed  during  such  year.  The  Government  will  certify  its \ncompliance  with  this  formula  with  each  withdrawal  request. \nOtherwise, import documentation under existing procedures will be \nrequired. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of loan proceeds \nand verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \nincludes  specific \nThe  policy \ncomponents that bear distinct costs of structural adjustments. The \ncounterpart funds to be generated from loan proceeds will be used \nto finance the structural adjustment costs arising from the FSPL. \n \nThe  principal  risks  associated  with  subprogram  III  relate  to  the \nnumber of bills that require passage by the National Assembly. The \nbills have the active support of the ministries concerned and NBC. \nThese  agencies  have  undertaken  to  explain  the  bills  to  the \nlegislators  and  are  working  closely  with  the  key  legislators  in  the \nconcerned  committees  so  that  they  understand  the  important  role \neach  legislation  will  play.  In  addition  to  the  strong  support  of  the \nsponsoring  government  agencies,  most  of  the  bills  are  at  an \nadvanced  stage  of  consideration  by  the  National  Assembly.  In \nJune 2005 an amendment to the constitution reduced the required \nnumber  of  National  Assembly  members  needed  to  constitute  a \nquorum for the purpose of passing a law\u2014from 87 to 74 members. \nThis should help speed up the passage of laws. \n \nThe  establishment  of  institutions  such  as  the  NBC  financial \nintelligence  unit  and  upgrading  of  the  insurance  regulator  are \nsubject  to  the  availability  of  funding  and  the  commitment  of  the \nofficials  and  agencies  concerned.  Most  of  these  institutional \ndevelopments  will  be  supported  through  budgetary  allocations,  at \nleast in part from counterpart funds under the Program. In addition, \nthese activities will be supported through technical assistance (TA) \nattached to subprogram III or from other development partners. All \nof  these  proposals  have  the  strong  backing  of  the  government \nagencies concerned and are not reliant solely on the support from \nindividual officers. \n \nThe  implementation  results  achieved  under  subprograms  I  and  II \nunderscore the belief that these risks are manageable.  \n \nADB will provide TA ($0.5 million) to support NBC, MEF, and MOC \nin  implementing  the  various  policy  and  institutional  reforms  under \nsubprogram III. The main TA activities include (i) technical support \nto  NBC  in  its  efforts  to  improve  its  on-site  supervision  and \nsurveillance of banks; (ii) technical support to MEF to help with its \n\n\fv \n\nefforts to strengthen the capacity of the insurance regulator and the \nrestructuring  of  the  state-owned  insurance  company  (Caminco); \nand  (iii)  technical  support  to  MOC  in  its  efforts  to  implement \ncommercial laws and associated regulations. \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Kingdom of Cambodia for subprogram III of the Financial Sector Program. The report also \ndescribes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Financial Sector Program Implementation, and \nif  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the \nBoard, will approve the TA. \n \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND \n\n2. \nThe  overall  objective  of  the  FSPL  is  to  promote  the  development  of  a  sound,  market-\nbased  financial  system  to  enhance  resource  mobilization  and  support  sustainable  economic \ngrowth  by  establishing  a  foundation  for  banking  and  insurance,  and  developing  the  financial \nmarket.  The  FSPL  adopted  a  program  cluster  approach  with  three  subprograms  based  on \nADB\u2019s program lending policy. Each succeeding subprogram was to be processed sequentially \nupon completion of the preceding subprogram.  \n \n3. \nThe  ADB  Board  approved  subprogram  I  for  $10  million  on  15  November  2001,  to  be \nreleased in two tranches of $5 million each.1 Both tranches were fully disbursed by the end of \n2002. Subprogram II was approved on 28 November 2002 for $10 million, again to be released \nin  two  tranches  of  $5  million  each  to  continue  the  reform  activities  under  subprogram  I.2 The \nLoan Agreement was signed on 11 December 2002 and subprogram II became effective on 21 \nFebruary 2003. The release of the first tranche was initially scheduled to occur within 6 months \nof loan effectiveness (August 2003) but because of the national election in 2003 and the 1-year \ndelay in forming the new government, it was rescheduled to May 2005. The second tranche was \ninitially scheduled for release within 12 months of loan effectiveness (February 2004) but similar \nto  the  first  tranche,  the  release  date  was  rescheduled  to  May  2005.  The  closing  date  of \nsubprogram II was extended twice from 31 December 2004 to 30 June 2005, and again to 31 \nDecember  2005.  The  latter  extension  was  to  allow  for  internal  processing  of  the  Board \ndocuments.  The  revised  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in  Appendix  1,  Achievements  of \nSubprograms I and II and Proposed Actions for Subprogram III is  in  Appendix  6.  The  summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 2. \n \n4. \nIn  seeking  ADB  Board  approval  of  subprogram  III,  the  lessons  learned  during \nsubprogram II implementation, the status of the agreed policy reform actions, and the readiness \nof the Government to undertake further reform measures were considered. The program cluster \napproach  provides  the  opportunity  to  discuss  and  refine  the  proposed  policy  actions  of \nsucceeding  subprograms  to  reflect  the  Government\u2019s  achievements,  changes  in  the  policy \nenvironment,  and  lessons  learned  from  the  previous  subprogram.  The  program  cluster \napproach  enhances  flexibility  and  allows  more  effective  design  of  reform  measures  in  a \nchanging political, economic, and financial environment. \n \n5. \nthrough the TAs were indispensable for completing policy actions under subprograms I and II. \n\nTo  support  FSPL  implementation,  ADB  provided  three  TAs.3 Technical  inputs  provided \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2001.

Nevertheless, new facilities are being constructed to produce alternative \ncategories  of  garments  to  take  advantage  of  the  recent  announcement  of  possible  safeguard \nmeasures  by  the  United  States  against  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China and  the  internationally \ncompetitive  local  labor  market.  At  the  same  time,  strong  growth  continues  in  tourism  and \nconstruction. The economy is expected to gradually recover from its anticipated slow growth of \n2.3% in 2005 up to close to 5% in 2007.5  \n \n7. \nThe  macroeconomic  environment  has  been  reasonably  well  managed  and  is  stable. \nWhile  the  real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  compound  growth  averaged  4.5%  per  annum \nduring  2000\u20132004,  consumer  price  index  inflation  was  constrained  to  2.6%  per  year  and  the \nexchange rate for the riel has been broadly stable with a depreciation of less than 1% per year \nduring this period. Budgetary performance improved somewhat in 2004.6 Total revenue rose by \n1%  to  11.3%  of  GDP  in  2004,  partly  due  to  one-off  revenue  collected  from  tax  arrears.  The \naccumulation of arrears was under control resulting in an overall budget deficit of 5.1% of GDP \nin 2004 compared with a deficit of 6.6% in 2003. This financial stability is derived from the well-\nmanaged fiscal and prudent monetary policy given the high dollarization of the economy.  \n \n8. \nSince  2002,  much  has  been  achieved  in  developing  governance  infrastructure  and  in \npreparing  for  private  sector  development.  The  Government  has  been  proactive  in  undertaking \nreforms in accounting and auditing practices in the private sector. Cambodia\u2019s accession to the \nWorld  Trade  Organization  in  late  2003  intensified  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  introduce  new \ncommercial \nthe  supervision  of  banks, \nmicrofinance  institutions,  and  insurance  subsectors;  increase  international  trade;  and  reform \nlabor and public finance. \n \n9. \nThe formation of a new government on 15 July 2004 represented a major step forward in \nCambodia\u2019s political development. Notwithstanding the time taken to form the new government, \na  peaceful  process  of  dialogue  ensued,  where  all  outstanding  differences  between  political \nparties  were  apparently  resolved  without  recourse  to  the  violence  that  characterized  previous \nelection  outcomes.  The  commune  elections  of  2002  represented  an  important  step  in  the \ncomprehensive  program  of  political,  administrative,  and  financial  decentralization.  Civil  society \nand nongovernment organizations are participating more in various areas of public concern and \nfreedom of the media is progressing.7 \n \n\nimplementing  regulations;  strengthen \n\nlaws  and \n\n  \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \nInfrastructure in the Financial Sector.

Many  measures  required  extensive  coordination  to  ascertain \nstakeholders'  understanding,  acceptance,  and  adoption.  By  end  June  2005,  the  Government \nhad  complied  with  all  eight  first  tranche  conditions  and  four  of  the  five  second  tranche \nconditions. The one remaining second tranche condition requires the formation of a joint venture \nbetween  the  state-owned  insurance  company  (Caminco)  and  a  private  insurance  company. \nDiscussions  for  a  joint  venture  with  the  nominated  private  sector  company,  Indochine,  broke \ndown  when  Indochine  went  into  liquidation.  The  Government  demonstrated  its  commitment  to \nthis  condition  through  the  following:  (i)  the  Prime  Minister  has  given  his  support  to  the \nprivatization of Caminco; and (ii) a public notice was issued inviting expressions of interest from \nprivate sector companies to invest in Caminco. Two proposals that were not responsive to the \nrequirements  of  the  public  notice  were  received  by  the  closing  date  (30  April  2005).  The \nGovernment\u2019s request for a waiver was supported by ADB management on 19 July 2005. The \nprogress report for subprogram II, including recommendations for approval of the waiver and the \nrelease  of  the  first  and  second  tranches  of  subprogram  II,  were  submitted  to  the  Board  of \nDirectors  for  consideration  on  a  no-objection  basis  on  11  August  2005.  Both  tranches  were \nreleased on 30 August 2005. \n \n \n \nSubprogram II of the FSPL supports the development of banking infrastructure by way of \n11. \nthree first-tranche conditions and one second-tranche condition that requires NBC to (i) adopt a \nuniform  chart  of  bank  accounts  and  disclosure  rules  for  commercial  banks  consistent  with \ninternational  accounting  standards  (IAS);  (ii)  apply  the  uniform  chart  of  bank  accounts  and \ndisclosure rules for the commercial banks consistent with IAS to the Rural Development Bank \nand other specialized banks; (iii) ensure that the Center for Banking Studies (CBS) establishes \na central banking course for NBC professional staff, including a mandatory training program for \nentry-level  professional  staff;  and  (iv)  adopt  a  guideline  for  sharing  credit  information  among \nmembers of the bankers association and, together with the bankers association, establish such \narrangements. \n \n12. \nAs  of  31  March  2005,  and  with  TA  provided  by  ADB,  all  14  commercial  banks  and  3 \nspecialized banks including the Rural Development Bank, had complied with implementation of \nthe chart of accounts and disclosure rules consistent with IAS. NBC also issued a prakas8  on \n29 December 2004 requiring all commercial banks and specialized banks to publish their annual \naudited financial statements beginning 30 June 2005. NBC will continue to monitor compliance \nwith  the  application  of  the  chart  of  accounts  by  all  commercial  banks  and  specialized  banks \nthrough on-site and off-site supervision.  \n \n13. \nOn  2  July  2003,  CBS  introduced  an  associate  degree  program,  an  entry-level  training \nprogram for new NBC staff, and a managerial training program. By the end of 2004, CBS had \ntrained three separate intakes totaling 254 students, of whom 210 were non-NBC staff. In 2005, \nCBS  revised  and  upgraded  these  courses  to  meet  the  challenges  for  developing  the  banking \nsystem. It has a new associate degree program. Following a request from NBC and CBS, ADB \n\n                                                 \n8 Khmer name for regulations and/or instructions issued by the governor of the NBC or a Government minister. \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n3. \n\nDevelopment of Interbank and Money Markets \n\nStrengthening of the Legal and Regulatory Framework  \n\nfielded  a  consultant  for  1  month,  beginning  3  June  2005,  to  strengthen  the  capabilities  of  the \ntrainers and advise CBS on how to achieve financial sustainability in the medium to long term.  \n \nNBC  signed  a  memorandum  of  understanding  with  16  banks9 outlining  guidelines  for \n14. \nestablishing  a  credit  information  sharing  system  on  a  pilot  basis.  The  arrangement  for  credit \ninformation  sharing  is  aimed  at  reducing  uncertainties  surrounding  lending  operations  of \ncommercial and specialized banks, and will enhance financial intermediation. Consultants under \nthe  small  and  medium  enterprises  TA10 are  developing  the  operating  system  plus  a  code  of \nconduct, expected to be adopted later in 2005, to aid system implementation.  \n \n2. \n \n  \n \nRecent  ADB  missions  recognized  the  efforts  made  by  NBC  in  this  area.  The  Prime \n15. \nMinister  submitted  the  draft  law  on  negotiable  instruments  and  payment  transactions  to  the \nNational  Assembly  on  18  January  2005,  thus  fulfilling  the  required  condition.  Discussions  of \nCommittee 2 began in March 2005. Expected to be approved by June 2006, the draft law will \nprovide  the  legal  basis  for  developing  payment  systems,  introducing  new  negotiable \ninstruments, and promoting development of a money market.  \n \n \n \n16. \nSubprogram II supported the development of the legal and regulatory framework by way \nof one first tranche and two second tranche conditions that required (i) adoption of a commercial \nenterprises law; (ii) submission to the National Assembly of a secured transactions law; and (iii) \nadoption  by  MOC  of  a  time-bound  action  plan  to  establish  a  public  registry  for  secured \ntransactions,  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  National  Assembly  ratified  the  draft  law  on  commercial \nenterprises on 17 May 2005 and the Royal Kram promulgating the law was issued on 19 June \n2005. The approved law is the equivalent of a corporation law and provides the legal basis for \nregistered  and  nonregistered  corporations,  their  shareholders,  and  management  to  operate.  It \nincludes  provisions  for  the  preparation  of  corporate  financial  reports,  auditing,  and  the \nprocedures  for  transfer  of  shares.  This  forms  part  of  the  necessary  prerequisites  for  the \nestablishment of a securities and exchange market. \n \n17. \nEarly  in  2005,  MOC  submitted  the  draft  secured  transactions  law  to  the  Council  of \nMinisters,  which  formally  approved  it  on  10  June  2005.  The  draft  legislation  was  submitted  to \nthe National Assembly with a letter signed by the Prime Minister on 13 July 2005. In response to \nthe  tranche  condition  requiring  a  time-bound  action  plan  for  the  establishment  of  a  secured \ntransactions  registry,  on  6  May  2005  MOC  adopted  a  time-bound  action  plan  (acceptable  to \nADB)  and  submitted  a  proposal  with  an  estimated  budget  of  $200,000  to  MEF  to  set  up  the \nregistry. The establishment of the secured transactions registry will facilitate the enforcement of \nfinancial  contracts  and  encourage  private  sector  lending  activities.  ADB  will  arrange  for \nconsultants11 to  help  MOC  and  MEF  with  the  procurement  for  the  registry  system,  including \nresponding to technical questions about specifications and assisting with bid evaluation.  \n \n\n                                                 \n9   The only nonparticipating bank is not undertaking general credit extension to individuals and domestic business in \n\nCambodia. \n\nProgram. Manila.  \n\n10  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Small and Medium Enterprise Development \n\n11  To  be  funded  from  TA  3861-CAM  (ADB.2002.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  Improving \n\nLegal Infrastructure in the Financial Sector. Manila). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5 \n\n4. \n\nDevelopment of the Insurance Subsector12  \n\n \n18. \nBased on the provisions of the insurance law, three interministerial prakas were issued \non  16  October  2002  with  regulations  for  compulsory  insurance  of  liabilities  arising  from \nconstruction work, public transport accidents, and motor vehicle third party policies. These are \nthe  main  insurance  products  available  locally  in  a  sector  comprising  a  state-owned  insurer \n(Caminco) and three private companies (Indochine, Asia Insurance, and Forte). The company, \nIndochine, is now undergoing liquidation. The total premium market (gross) was more than $10 \nmillion in 2004. MEF is presently reviewing model legislation, regulations, and practices in the \nregion  with  a  view  to  promoting  the  expansion  of  the  insurance  products  and  the  level  of \nbusinesses in Cambodia.  \n \nOne  of  the  aims  of  the  Program  is  to  restructure  the  state-owned  company  (Caminco) \n19. \nthrough a joint venture arrangement with a private insurance company. MEF made an important \nstep  toward  restructuring  Caminco  when  it  set  up  a  reinsurance  company,  Cambodia  Re,  in \n2002 and divested the reinsurance function of Caminco. Cambodia Re became a joint venture \nwith  a  consortium  of  five  international  insurance  companies  in  October  2002.  The  consortium \nholds  20%  of  Cambodia  Re\u2019s  shares.  The  Government  envisaged  a  joint  venture  between \nCaminco  and  a  local  private  insurance  firm  (Indochine)  when  subprogram  II  was  being \nprocessed,  but  that  did  not  come  about  as  the  private  firm  became  insolvent  and  entered \nliquidation. The Government13 has continued to strongly support commercialization of Caminco; \nrestructuring will begin under subprogram III.  \n \n20.  With  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  endorsement  of  the  privatization  of  Caminco  in  early  2005, \nMEF issued a public notice inviting expressions of interest from local and international insurance \ncompanies  to  invest  in,  at  most,  49%  of  the  capital  shares  of  Caminco  in  line  with  legislative \nlimitations. Two nonresponsive proposals were received by the closing date of 30 April 2005.14 \nIn  light  of  the  foregoing  steps,  MEF  has  unsuccessfully  made  extensive  efforts  to  find  a  joint \nventure  partner  for  Caminco.  The  ADB  mission  of  May  2005  proposed  that  the  process  be \npursued  as  part  of  the  restructuring  plan  for  Caminco  and  the  upgrading  of  the  insurance \nregulator  under  subprogram  III.  A  short  term  consultant  under  the  TA  for  Improving  Insurance \nSupervision (footnote 3) was fielded in early July 2005 to help finalize Caminco\u2019s restructuring \nplan.  The  appraisal  mission  of  July  2005  reviewed  the  first  draft  of  the  restructuring  plan  and \nrequested a revision to clearly identify objectives, key actions, and target completion dates. \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n12  Two  policy  actions  are  required:  (i)  MEF,  in  consultation  with  related  ministries,  to  adopt  regulations  for  the \ndevelopment  of  compulsory  insurance  (first tranche);  and  (ii)  MEF to  establish  a  joint  venture  between  the  state-\nowned insurance company and a private company (second tranche). \n\n13  The ADB mission of July 2004 discussed and agreed with MEF an action plan that included strict enforcement of \nthe  current  regulatory  framework;  rationalization  of  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  focusing  on  capital, \nauthorization, and accounting disclosure requirements; strengthening the capacity of the insurance regulator; and \nenforcing regulations equitably on all insurance firms. The action plan has the objective of restoring confidence and \nintegrity  in  the  insurance  market.  Successful  implementation  of  the  plan  is  expected  to  complement  any  joint \nventure reform activities that may eventuate for Caminco. Implementation of the plan has been monitored closely, \nbut  not  much  progress  has  been  made,  raising  concerns  about  the  technical  capacity  of  the  Department  of \nFinancial Industry to implement the plan effectively. Technical support for the insurance regulator is included in the \nattached TA for subprogram III. \n\n14  The first proposal was predicated only on majority ownership (or more than 51% of the shares) and was made by a \nlocal  firm  with  no  prior  insurance  experience.  The  second  proposal  was  a  general  letter  from  a  competitor \ninsurance company with no specific proposal to purchase shares. \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n5. \n\nDevelopment of Accounting and Auditing Practices  \n\n \n \n \n21. \nSubprogram  II  supported  the  development  of  accounting  and  auditing  through  two \nconditions in the first tranche and one condition in the second tranche: (i) the National Assembly \nwill adopt a law on corporate accounts, their audit, and the accounting profession; (ii) MEF will \nadopt a subdecree requiring the application of IAS and international standards for auditing (ISA) \nto all companies (including insurance companies) incorporated in Cambodia, and establishing a \nnational accounting council (NAC) to set and interpret standards; and (iii) MEF will establish an \nassociation of  accountants  and  auditors  that  will  (a)  adopt  a  code  of  ethics  that  complies  with \nrequirements  of  the  International  Federation  of  Accountants,  and  (b)  establish  committees  on \neducation and ethics within the association.  \n \n22.  With  the  consistent  efforts  of  MEF,  the  National  Assembly  adopted  the  law  covering \ncorporate  accounts,  their  audit,  and  the  accounting  profession  on  8  July  2002.  NAC  was \nestablished in March 2003 by a subdecree and its members were appointed by the minister of \neconomy  and  finance.  NAC  has  since  adopted  15  accounting  standards  and  10  auditing \nstandards based on international standards. The subdecree on the creation of the Kampuchea \nInstitute of Certified Public Accountants and Auditors (KICPAA) was adopted on 19 March 2003. \nOn 10 February 2005, NAC proposed the establishment of committees on education and ethics \nwithin  KICPAA  to  the  minister  of  economy  and  finance.  Prakas  no.  199  on  the  formation  of  a \ncommission  for  work,  study,  and  research  was issued  on  4  April  2005 and  prakas no.  222  on \nthe formation of a professional ethics commission was issued on 12 April 2005. The subdecree \ncovering  the  code  of  ethics  for  KICPAA  was  approved  by  the  Council  of  Ministers  on  3  June \n2005 and endorsed by the Prime Minister on 17 June 2005. These activities effectively establish \nthe legal and institutional framework to advance accounting and auditing practices in Cambodia.  \n \nB. \n\nImpact on the Financial Sector \n\n23. \nThe  financial  sector  performance  has  made  satisfactory  progress,  albeit  from  a  low \nbase. Financial deepening has improved, reflecting the financial stability and increased financial \nservices promoted through institutional reforms supported under the FSPL. Broad money supply \n(M2) to GDP has risen from 12.8% of GDP in 2000 before the start of the Program to 21.4% of \nGDP in 2004, a major structural improvement. Credit to the private sector has correspondingly \nrisen  from  6.5%  of  GDP  in  2000  to  an  estimated  9.9%  in  2004.  Through  the  relicensing \nprogram, 15  16  banks  (including  4  insolvent  banks)  were  closed,  1  was  downgraded  to  a \nrepresentative office, and the remaining banks were required to strengthen their capital position. \nAll existing banks were well capitalized and relatively liquid at the end of 2004 with an average \ncapital  adequacy  ratio  to  risk  weighted  asset  of  35%  and  a  loan  to  deposit  ratio  of  just  under \n60%.  The  financial  sector  is  now  playing  an  increasingly  important  role  in  intermediating \nsavings,  accelerating  investment  formation,  and  providing  an  increasing  range  of  banking \nservices to the private sector.  \n \n24. \nConfidence  in  the  banking  sector  appears  to  be  growing  as  well  as  appreciation  that \nbanking facilities can be profitably expanded to meet the growing demand for banking services. \nThe  ANZ  (Australia-New  Zealand)  Bank  from  Australia  has  entered  into  a  joint  venture  with  a \ndomestic  consortium16 to  open  a  new  commercial  bank  in  Phnom  Penh  with  two  branches \n                                                 \n15 Supported by a 3-year International Monetary Fund poverty reduction and growth facility completed in 2002. Under \nthis  program,  all  commercial  banks  were  required  to  hold  at  least  $13  million  equivalent  of  capital  or  a  minimum \nsolvency ratio (ratio of capital to the total risk weighted assets) of 20%, subsequently reduced to 15% in 2004. \n\n16  The consortium is the Royal Group. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7 \n\nopened in August 2005 and the main head-office to be opened in early September 2005. The \nVietnam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development opened a representative office in Phnom \nPenh on 11 July 2005. The Association of Cambodian Local Economic Development Agencies \nwas established in January 1993 as a national nongovernment organization for micro and small \nenterprise  credit  and  has  since  expanded  rapidly  throughout  Cambodia.  In  December  2001, \nNBC  granted  the  association  a  full  banking  license  and  by  the  end  of  March  2005,  the \nassociation had 134 offices with 2,285 staff providing full banking services to 126,040 borrowers \nthroughout most of Cambodia.  \n \n25. \nOther  nonbank  financial  services  have  been  slow  to  develop  and  are  currently  in  the \nearly stages of development. For example, the insurance industry has been spurred by the new \nregulations requiring insurance in three mandated areas, including motor vehicles. Nevertheless \nthe  market  was  still  only  estimated  to  be  about  $10  million  of  gross  premium  income  in \n2004.The  market  is  made  up  of  about  50\u201360%  of  motor  vehicle  premium  income  with  marine \nand  casualty  insurance  the  next  largest  class.  The  very  modest  size  of  the  insurance  market \nreflects the fact that most of commercial insurance is placed off-shore, while most Cambodians \nhave traditionally gone without insurance cover. The absence of contract enforcement through \nthe court system has meant that Cambodians have not relied on formal insurance.  \n \n26.  While  the  outreach  of  banking  services  expanded  during  subprogram  II,  very  slow \nprogress has been made in nonbank financial services such as insurance, pension funds, hire-\npurchase,  and  leasing.  As  such  the  scope  for  expansion  through  existing  bank  as  well  as \nnonbank financial services is very large given the relatively small and underdeveloped nature of \nthe  financial  market.  Financial  sector  development  can  increasingly  contribute  to  the  efficient \ntransformation of savings into productive investments, particularly within the private sector.  \n \nC. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n1. \n\nDevelopment of Banking Subsector Infrastructure  \n\nThroughout implementation, steady progress has been made in implementing the overall \n27. \nFinancial Sector Program and complying with the specified policy conditions in line with program \nobjectives.  However,  completing  policy  measures  have  required  significantly  more  time  than \noriginally  envisioned  in  addition  to  the  almost  1-year  delay  in  forming  the  new  National \nAssembly  following  the  2003  general  election.  In  drafting  laws  and  supporting  rules  and \nregulations, such as the draft commercial enterprises and secured transactions laws, technical \ninputs were indispensable. The TAs successfully ensured that best practices were incorporated \nand then consolidated throughout the consultation period to achieve the intended results.  \n \n \n \n28. \nProgress  in  the  development  of  banking  has  been  significant  due  to  strong  NBC \nownership.  ADB  commends  NBC\u2019s  achievements  to  date  and  expects  these  to  be  reinforced \nunder subprogram III, in particular in the area of banking supervision. \n \n \n \n29. \nFostering  a  solid  understanding  of  the  underlying  legal  concepts  and  mechanisms  for \nmodernizing the financial system and ensuring consultation with all stakeholders, including the \nprivate sector, are assessed as having long-term positive impacts on sustainability of program \noutputs.  Given  the  experience  under  subprogram  II,  and  specifically  the  need  for  consensus \nbuilding, additional time is required to fulfill policy measures for tranche releases requiring the \npassage  of  legislation.  The  general  election  of  2003  and  the  subsequent  delay  in  forming  the \n\nStrengthening of the Legal and Regulatory Framework  \n\n2. \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n3. \n\nDevelopment of the Insurance Subsector  \n\nnew  National  Assembly  were  events  beyond  control  that  caused  delays  to  the  passage  of \nseveral laws. At the same time, several layers of committees within the Council of Ministers and \nthe  National  Assembly  were  overlooked  in  the  proposed  timing  for  adoption  of  key  legislation \nduring program processing. \n \n30. \nThe  introduction  of  the  commercial  enterprises  law  will  facilitate  development  of  the \ncorporate sector. The introduction of the draft secured transactions law and adoption of a time-\nbound program for establishing the secured transactions registry will greatly assist companies\u2019 \naccess  to  funding.  The  proposed  negotiable  instruments  law  will  promote  money  market \ninstruments,  such  as  certificates  of  deposits  and  short-term  treasury  bills,  and  improve  the \nmarket  structure  by  introducing  money  brokerage  firms  to  penetrate  the  segmented  banking \nsubsector.  However  for  active  secondary  trading  in  the  money  market  to  take  place,  the \ncommercial orientation of NBC, commercial banks, and the private sector must be significantly \nimproved.  \n \n \n \n31. \nThe  insurance  subsector  is  still  in  its  early  stage  of  development.  The  underlying \nconcepts and business transactions are very new in Cambodia. While the FSPL has had some \nsuccess in transforming insurance agents to fully functional insurance firms to compete with the \nstate-owned insurance company, the outcome has been mixed. Reorienting the Government\u2019s \nrole from sole operator to regulator has not been easy as most staff have had no prior formal \ntraining or experience in insurance. This is a process that will take time with ongoing technical \nguidance. The ADB mission of May 2005 proposed capacity support to help the reform activities \nin this subsector plus needed implementation and TA support under subprogram III. \n \n \n \nUnder  MEF  leadership,  substantial  progress  in  the  development  of  accounting  and \n32. \nauditing  practices  was  achieved.  Major  contributing  factors  include  the  strong  commitment  of \nthe MEF and NAC, which has contributed to establishing appropriate regulatory and institutional \nframeworks. However, buy-in from other parts of the Government, including budgetary support \nfor NAC and KICPAA activities and the training of members to reach appropriate qualifications \nis needed.  \n \n\nDevelopment of Accounting and Auditing Practices \n\n4. \n\nV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SUBPROGRAM III \n\nA. \n\nRevised Policy Actions for Subprogram III  \n\n33. \nProgress  with  reforms  and  the  Government\u2019s  growing  capacity  to  implement  reforms \nindicates the need for continued support under subprogram III. In formulating subprogram III, all \npolicy actions proposed under the FSPL cluster concept of three subprograms were revisited in \ndiscussions  with  the  Government.  That  led  to  certain  policy  actions  being  dropped,  revised  or \nnewly  added,  reflecting  the  Government\u2019s  achievements,  evolving  policy  environment,  and \nlessons learned from subprograms I and II implementation. Relative to the previously proposed \npolicy  matrix  for  subprogram  III,  three  of  the  seven  conditions  have  been  either  dropped  or \ndeferred for reasons stated in paras. 34-35.  \n \nDevelopment  of  a  deposit  insurance  system  has  been  omitted  from  the  proposed \n34. \nrevision  of  the  subprogram  III  policy  matrix  in  view  of  the  direction  of  developments  in \nCambodia's  banking  subsector.  This  change  reflects  the  outcome  of  the  dialogue  with  NBC \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nofficials who would have had the responsibility for implementing the system and managing the \nresulting  moral  hazards  engendered.  Ongoing  support  to  bank  on-site  supervision  is  aimed  at \nreinforcing  the  need  for  bank  management  to  be  more  vigilant  and  take  responsibility  for \noperating results. In the interest of depositors, banks are now required to publish their audited \nannual  financial  reports  with  effect  from  June  2005.  All  banks  are  highly  capitalized,  following \nthe International Monetary Fund (IMF) relicensing program in 2000. Further, the development of \nthe draft securities and exchange law could be deferred to a later program considering the very \nnascent  stage  of  the  securities  market.  The  Council  of  Ministers  is  discussing  a  draft  law  on \nGovernment  securities  to  regulate  the  issuance  and  management  of  Government  securities \nbefore submission to the National Assembly. This will facilitate development of the bond market. \n \n35. \nA  banking  institute  for  private  bank  staff  was  established  in  January  2004  under  the \nadministration  of  the  bankers  association.  ADB  supported  several  short-term  training  courses. \nMekong  Private  Sector  Development  Facility  staff  are  overseeing  the  progress  of  the  institute \nand  guiding  the  bankers  association  on  how  best  to  sustain  training  programs  offered. \nConsidering this development and progress, the originally proposed policy action is not retained \nunder subprogram III. \n \n36. \nThe legal infrastructure to support the growing body of commercial law sponsored under \nthese  subprograms  needs  to  be  further  developed.  The  recognition  of  property  rights  as \nreflected in a strong body of commercial law is one essential component for a well-functioning \nfinancial  sector.  Equally  important  is  a  robust  and  independent  court  system,  supported  by  a \nwell-educated and functioning judiciary and legal profession. An arbitration center for resolving \nminor  commercial  disputes  will  be  established  following  enactment  of  the  law  on  commercial \narbitration. In addition, the capability to enforce those rights that gives the enacted commercial \nlaws  their  meaning  and effect  is  also  required.17 Similarly  an  insolvency law  is  needed  to  help \nenforce contractual and property rights. \n \nIn light of these concerns, the revised subprogram III policy matrix includes measures to \n37. \n(i)  develop  the  legal  infrastructure,  including  substantial  capacity  building  in  legal  education  to \ntrain judges and lawyers in new commercial laws; and (ii) disseminate (by MOC) the commercial \nlaws via the Internet. These measures will involve enhancing the law faculties\u2019 course offerings \nin commercial laws for the education of new lawyers and continuing legal education seminars in \nthe  application  of  these  new  commercial  laws  for  judges,  as  well  as  lawyers  and  other \nstakeholders.     \n \nThe  draft  legislation  covering  anti-money  laundering  and  combating  the  financing  of \n38. \nterrorism, now with the Council of Ministers, will require establishment of a financial intelligence \nunit  (FIU).  Experience  from  other  countries  has  shown  that  the  central  bank  must  gain \nexperience  with  these  operations  prior  to  introducing  the  law.  To  commence  preparatory  work \nfor establishing the FIU, a unit within NBC\u2019s banking supervision department will be established \nfollowing the approval of subprogram III. Staff of this unit will be trained on FIU activities. Once \nthe  law  is  passed  the  Australian  Transaction  Reports  and  Analysis  Centre  and  other \ndevelopment partners will likely be interested in providing implementation support. \n\n                                                 \n17  From Procter, Carlisle. 2005. Financial Sector Assessment Paper: Cambodia 2004. Manila: ADB: \u201cProperty rights \nare  indispensable  for  the  development  of  any  market  economy.  To  confidently  trade  goods  or  services  it  is \nabsolutely essential that agents know that \u2018the person selling it in fact owns it\u2019, and that impacts to such ownership \nwill strictly eventuate according to what contracts defined ex-ante. The stronger and clearer property rights are, the \nmore likely it is that trade of goods and services will take place, and that prices will be efficient. It is no coincidence \nthat an effective judicial system, as well as property rights for it to enforce, is a feature of advanced economies.\u201d \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n39. \nIn the insurance subsector, the Government  will consolidate the work that commenced \nunder  subprograms  I  and  II  to  restructure  and  divest  its  shares  in  the  state-owned  insurance \ncompany (Caminco). This will enable MEF to focus on its regulatory role. The existing insurance \nlaw  needs  to  be  revised  to  allow  share  ownership  beyond  49%  of  the  state-owned  insurance \nand reinsurance companies, and incorporate developments necessary to create new business \nopportunities. This will be addressed through ongoing policy dialogue with MEF. The attached \nTA  for  subprogram  III  includes  consulting  support  to  implement  the  restructuring  plan  for \nCaminco and assist the insurance regulator in performing its functions equitably. \n \n40. \nBased  on  these  suggested  changes,  the  proposed  policy  matrix  for  subprogram  III \nincluding the expected completion dates is provided in Appendix 3. The policy matrix is in line \nwith the FSPL framework contained in the development policy letter of 4 October 2001 and the \nGovernment\u2019s approved financial sector blueprint for 2001\u20132010. IMF is the only multilateral aid \nagency  involved  in  the  financial  sector.  The  ADB  mission  coordinated  closely  with  IMF  during \nsubprogram II implementation and preparation of subprogram III. \n \nB. \n\nProgress with Policy Reform \n\n41. \nSecured  Transactions  Law.  Following  formal  approval  by  the  Council  of  Ministers  on \n10  June  2005,  the  draft  law  was  submitted  to  the  National  Assembly  together  with  a  letter \nsigned  by  the  Prime  Minister  on  13  July  2005.  The  National  Assembly  is  in  recess  until  22 \nAugust 2005. MOC will, in consultation with the chairperson of Committee 9, determine when to \nbegin discussion. The draft law contains 55 articles, subdivided into 5 chapters. \n \n42. \nPublic  Registry  for  Secured  Transactions.  MOC approved a time-bound action plan \nfor  establishing  the  registry  on  6  May  2005.  ADB  will  provide  TA  (footnote  3)  to  help  procure \nhardware and software and establish the online registry. \n \n43. \nFinancial Intelligence Unit. The draft law for anti-money laundering and combating the \nfinancing of terrorism is with the Council of Ministers and several articles have been reviewed in \nJuly  2005.  Under  the  attached  TA  for  subprogram  III,  ADB  will  provide  consulting  support  to \nhelp establish the FIU. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre is planning to \nprovide software support to the FIU and train staff on its application. \n \n44. \nLaw  for  Commercial  Arbitration.  Drafted  in  1995  with  support  from  the  Canadian \nInternational  Development  Agency,  the  law  was  submitted  to  the  National  Assembly  together \nwith  the  Commercial  Enterprises  Law  in  2004.  It  is  now  with  the  Committee  9  of  the  National \nAssembly awaiting discussion. The National Assembly is in recess until 22 August 2005. MOC \nwill,  in  consultation  with  the  chairperson  of  Committee  9,  determine  when  to  commence \ndiscussion. The draft law contains 47 articles, subdivided into 11 chapters. \n \n45. \nInsolvency  Law.  Drafted  in  2002  with  IMF  support  and  submitted  to  the  Council  of \nMinisters in 2003, the draft law has gone through three interministerial debates. Fifteen of the 70 \narticles have been reviewed. Strong collaboration between MOC and the Ministry of Justice is \nrequired to ensure coherence and consistency with the draft civil code. The Ministry of Justice is \nreviewing  the  legal  procedures  and some  of  the  definitional issues.  It  will  take  time to  get  this \nthrough the interministerial level before debate by the Council of Ministers.  \n \n46. \nDissemination  of  Commercial  Laws.  MOC is ready to post all laws adopted to date, \nbut is constrained by the capacity of its website. MOC has requested budget support from MEF. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11 \n\nPrudential  Regulations \n\nMOC is providing official copies of legislation for uploading onto the Internet: www.worldLII.org18 \n(World Legal Information Institute). \n \n47. \nCommercial  Law  Curricula  Based  on  the  New  Commercial  Laws.  Under  the \nattached  TA  for  subprogram  III,  ADB  will  provide  consultant  support  to  help  MOC  work  with \nrelevant  law  institutes  to  develop  and  adopt  commercial  law  curricula  for  training  judges, \nlawyers,  and  legal  and  clerical  staff,  based  on  the  new  commercial  laws.  MOC  is  undertaking \nroadshows in the provinces to raise public awareness of the new commercial laws. \n \n48. \nto  Enhance  Solvency,  Liquidity  and  Corporate \nGovernance.  Under the attached TA for subprogram III, ADB will provide consultant support to \nhelp  MEF  review,  update,  and  implement  appropriate  prudential  regulations  to  enhance \nsolvency,  liquidity,  and  corporate  governance  requirements;  and  support  the  insurance \nregulator. \n \n49. \nRestructure CAMINCO. MEF has approved the restructuring plan for Caminco that was \nsubmitted by the Caminco Board of Directors. Under the attached TA for subprogram III, ADB \nwill provide consultant support to help MEF implement key activities of this plan and divest the \nGovernment\u2019s shares at the earliest opportunity. \n \nLaw  on  Negotiable  Instruments  and  Payment  Transactions.  The  draft  law  was \n50. \nsubmitted to the National Assembly with a letter from the Prime Minister dated 18 January 2005. \nAt the end of May 2005, Committee 2 of the National Assembly had reviewed three chapters. \n \nImplementing  Regulations  for  the  Law  on  Negotiable  Instruments  and  Payment \n51. \nTransactions. NBC will finalize details of an IMF TA to help draft the implementing regulations \nfor  this  law.  Under  the  attached  TA  for  subprogram  III,  ADB  will  provide  support  to  help  NBC \npublicly disseminate information on the new law and its implementing regulations. \n \n52. \nScholarships for Development of Professional KICPAA Members. The Government \nhas  been  providing  70  scholarships  annually  since  2003  to  train  candidates  to  reach  the \nKICPAA  accreditation  level.  MEF  is  expected  to  use  funds  from  the  subprogram  III  loan \nproceeds to ensure this continues. \n \nC. \n\nLoan Amount and Tranching \n\nThe  Government  of  Cambodia  has  requested a  loan  equivalent  to  SDR6,763,000  ($10 \n53. \nmillion) from the Special Funds resources to help finance subprogram III of the Financial Sector \nProgram. The loan will have a 24-year term including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate \nof  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter,  and  such  other \nterms and condition set forth in the draft loan and program agreements. The Government has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under the Special Funds resources \non the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its \nown independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \nThe  loan  will  be  released  in  a  single  tranche  upon  satisfactory  compliance  with  all  tranche \nconditions. The implementation period for subprogram III is proposed to be 18 months from loan \neffectiveness. \n \n\n                                                 \n18   This  webpage  is  part  of  ADB  RETA  5820.  (ADB.  1998.  Regional  Technical  Assistance  for  Development  of  the \n\nInternet for Asian Law. Manila). \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nIf  an  international  bank  requires  credit  enhancement  prior  to  investing  in  the  financial \n54. \nsector, ADB may be in a position to provide the investor with a guarantee, based on the FSPL \nobjectives. Any guarantee proposed to be provided by ADB will be subject to a separate Board \npaper.  \n \nD. \n\nImplementation Arrangement \n\n55. \nImplementation  arrangements  adopted  for  subprograms  I  and  II  have  been  effective. \nAlthough weaknesses in Cambodia's public financial management systems have high costs in \nterms of allocation and operational efficiency and have resulted in high levels of fiduciary risk to \npublic  funds,19 the  Government  is  committed  to  a  program  of  reforms  identified  in  the  ADB-\nWorld Bank Integrated Fiduciary Assessment and Public Expenditure Review of 2003. A World \nBank program to strengthen public financial management and accountability is expected to be \napproved by the end of 2005. Given ongoing efforts to strengthen public financial management, \nand the fact that ADB reserves the right to audit the use of loan funds and to verify the accuracy \nof  the  Borrower's  certification  of  compliance,  the  same  procedures  for  procurement  and \ndisbursement  of  funds  and  the  use  of  counterpart  funds  under  subprograms  I  and  II,  will  be \napplied in subprogram III.  \n \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\n56. \nNBC will continue to be the Executing Agency for subprogram III, while MEF and MOC \nwill  be  the  implementing  agencies.  NBC  will  continue  to  be  responsible  for  overall  program \nimplementation,  including  administration  and  disbursement  of  loan  proceeds,  maintenance  of \naccounts, and preparation of quarterly progress reports. \n \n57. \nTo  coordinate  program  implementation  among  government  ministries  and  agencies \nconcerned, a  financial sector  steering  committee  was  formed  under  subprogram  I.  Chaired  by \nthe  NBC  governor,  the  committee  comprises  senior  officers  from  MEF,  MOC,  NBC,  and  other \ngovernment agencies concerned. Under subprogram III, the committee will meet every quarter \nand on an ad-hoc basis to review pending issues and propose concrete actions to resolve them, \nthus  ensuring  timely  program  implementation.  A  senior  NBC  officer,  appointed  as  program \ndirector  under  subprograms  I  and  II,  will  continue  to  assist  ADB,  NBC,  MEF,  and  MOC,  in \ncoordinating day-to-day program implementation under subprogram III.  \n \n\n2. \n\nMonitoring \n\n58. \nADB,  jointly  with  NBC,  MEF,  and  MOC,  will  continue  to  conduct  quarterly  reviews  to \nassess progress in subprogram III implementation and in particular to confirm compliance with \ntranche conditions. The Government and ADB will continue to engage in active policy dialogue \non  sector  issues,  reforms,  and  other  measures;  and  agree  on  actions  necessary  to  keep \nsubprogram III on course.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\n59. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs  (excluding \nlocal  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding \nineligible items (Appendix 4) and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. In \n\n                                                 \n19   World  Bank.  2005.  Concept  Note  for  Cambodia  Public  Financial  Management  and  Accountability  Project.  \n\nWashington D.C. \n\n\f \n\n13 \n\naccordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and \nRelated Requirements for Program Loans, the proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed \nto  Cambodia  as  the  Borrower.  No  supporting  import  documentation  will  be  required,  if  during \neach  year  that  loan  proceeds  are  expected  to  be  disbursed,  the  value  of  Cambodia\u2019s  total \nimports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports  financed \nunder other official development assistance is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan \nexpected to be disbursed during such year. The Government will certify its compliance with this \nformula  with  each  withdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing \nprocedures will be required. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and verify \nthe accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \n\nVI. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n60. \nThe  attached  TA  will  support  NBC,  MEF,  and  MOC  in  implementing  the  various  policy \nand institutional reforms under subprogram III. The main activities of the TA include (i) technical \nsupport  to  NBC  in  its  efforts  to  improve  its  on-site  supervision  and  surveillance  of  banks,  (ii) \ntechnical  support  to  MEF  to  help  in  its  efforts  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  insurance \nregulator and restructuring of the state-owned insurance company (Caminco), and (iii) technical \nsupport to MOC in its efforts to implement commercial laws and associated regulations. \n \nThe TA is estimated to cost a total of $650,000 equivalent, comprising foreign exchange \n61. \ncosts of $435,000 and local currency costs of $215,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $500,000 \non a grant basis from its TA funding program to finance the entire foreign exchange cost plus \n$65,000  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The  Government  will  finance  the  remaining \n$150,000 equivalent of the local currency costs, which include the provision of counterpart staff, \noffice  space,  administrative  support,  and  other  miscellaneous  services.  ADB  will  engage \nindividual  consultants  to  provide  consulting  services  for  a  total  of  29.5  person-months  (15.5 \nperson-months  of  international  and  14  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  inputs).  The \nconsultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  on  an  individual  basis  (consultants  from  related  fields  of \nexpertise  are  to  be  recruited  through  a  firm)  in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants by Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers and other arrangements satisfactory \nto  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  TA  purpose,  outputs,  methodology, \nimplementation arrangements, terms of reference of consultants, and budget are in Appendix 5. \n \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n62. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n \n\nThe policies adopted and actions taken before the date of the Loan Agreement \nof  subprogram  III  as  described  in  the  Financial  Sector  Program  development \npolicy letter will continue in operation. \n\nThe  Government  will  promptly  adopt  the  policies  and  actions  included  in \nsubprogram III and specified in the Financial Sector Program development policy \nletter, and will ensure that such policies and actions continue in operation. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nB. \n\nConditions for Disbursement \n\n63. \nThe  disbursement  of  the  single  tranche  under  subprogram  III  is  subject  to  compliance \nwith all the specified tranche conditions and satisfactory implementation of the overall Financial \nSector Program, as set out in the policy matrix.  \n \n\nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n64. \nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  6,763,000  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  subprogram  III  of  the \nFinancial  Sector  Program  from  ADB's  Special  Funds  resources  with  an  interest  charge  at  the \nrate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 24 \nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement  presented  to  the \nBoard. \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                                                                President \n\n                                                          \nHaruhiko Kuroda \n\n \n\n \n \n 30  August 2005 \n \n \n\n\f \n                                                                                             \n\n            Appendix 1 \n\n         15 \n\n \nDesign and Monitoring Framework a\u2013Financial Sector Program \n\nMonitoring Mechanisms \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\n \n \n\n \nEconomic reports, official \nstatistics \n \nAsian Development Bank  \n(ADB) review missions \n \n \n \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \n\nGoal \nDevelop a sound, \nmarket-based \nfinancial system to \nsupport resource \nmobilization and \nsustainable \neconomic \nGrowth. \n \n \n \n\nPurpose \n \n1.

The benefits of the FSPL, including broader access to \nfinancial  services  and  a  more  competitive,  diversified  financial  sector  that  reduces  systemic  vulnerabilities,  are \nexpected to become substantive with (i) strengthening of the legal infrastructure and accounting system; (ii) capacity \nbuilding  in  the  banking  supervision  department  of  the  National  Bank  of  Cambodia,  and  commercial  banks;  and  (iii) \ndevelopment  of  the  insurance  subsector.  With  environments  conducive  to  the  development  of  the  financial  sector, \nsupported  by  (i)  effective  legal  and  regulatory  reforms;  (ii)  higher  capabilities  of  the  accounting  profession;  (iii) \nexpansion  of  credit  from  the  banking  subsector  to  support  economic  activities;  and  (iv)  the  concomitant  growth  of \nsubsectors such as insurance and microfinance, a wider cross-section of the population will benefit. Beneficiaries are \nexpected to include the poor and near-poor. A broader and more balanced financial system will have higher resilience \nto external shocks, which have serious implications for the poor. \n \n \nB.
