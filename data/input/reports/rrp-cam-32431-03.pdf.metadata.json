The FSPL takes a cluster approach and consists of \nthree  back-to-back  subprograms.  Each  succeeding  subprogram \nwas  to  be  processed  sequentially  upon  completion  of  the \npreceding subprogram.  \n   \nClassification  Targeting classification: General intervention \nSector: Finance \nSubsector: Finance sector development \nThemes: Sustainable economic growth and governance \nSubthemes: Promoting economic efficiency and enabling markets,  \nand financial and economic governance \n   \nEnvironment  Category C. The environmental implications were reviewed and no \nAssessment  significant adverse impact was identified. \n   \nSocial Sector  Involuntary resettlement: Category C. \nAssessment  Impact on indigenous people: Category C. \nNo  involuntary  resettlement  or  impact  on  indigenous  people  is \nexpected from program implementation. \n   \nThe Program    \nRationale   Cambodia\u2019s financial sector is at a rudimentary stage with limited \nfinancial  intermediation  and  low  public  confidence.  The \nunderdeveloped  financial  system  is  one  of  the  most  significant \nconstraints  faced  by  the  Government  in  achieving  broad-based \nsustainable  economic  growth  and  socioeconomic  development \nobjectives,  including  poverty  reduction.  Financial  sector \ndevelopment has been hampered by numerous constraints: (i) high \nrisk  related  to  uncertainties  regarding  law  and  contract \nenforcement due to a weak rule of law, (ii) high information costs \nstemming from lack of common accounting and auditing standards \nand other information infrastructure, (iii) high operating costs due to \nthe  absence  of  liquidity  management  mechanisms  and  other \nmarket  infrastructure,  and  (iv)  weak  supervisory  systems  and \ncapacity.   \n \nThe  FSPL  supports  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  address  these \nconstraints and lay the foundation for financial sector development. \nA sound, efficient, and integrated financial system is crucial for \nachieving broad-based sustainable economic growth and reducing \npoverty by increasing job opportunities, lowering transaction costs \nof  economic  activities,  and  extending  outreach  of  the  formal \nfinancial sector to the poor and rural areas. An efficient financial ", "ii \nsystem will promote private sector development as well as foreign \ndirect investment. Further, a robust financial sector will protect the \neconomy from unfavorable exogenous shocks that are becoming \nmore common in increasingly globalized financial markets.  \n \nProgress  under  subprograms  I  and  II  warrants  the  support  of \nsubprogram III.  \n \n   \nObjective and Scope  The FSPL aims to promote the development of a sound, market-\nbased  financial  system  to  support  resource  mobilization  and \nsustainable economic growth by establishing a foundation for the \nbanking and insurance industries as well as financial markets. The \nFSPL focuses on the following activities: \n \n(i)  Enhance bank intermediation and public confidence by \nestablishing  and  strengthening  banking  supervision, \ndeveloping  key  information  infrastructure  and  safety \nnets, and building capacity in both public and private \nsectors by reinforcing capacity-building institutions. \n(ii)  Establish legal and regulatory frameworks for insurance \ndevelopment by institutionalizing a supervisory system \nand  prudential  regulations,  fostering  private  sector \ndevelopment in the insurance business, and developing \ncompulsory insurance. \n(iii)  Prepare  the  foundation  for  developing  interbank  and \nmoney  markets  by  building  public-private  sector \npartnerships and establishing a basic legal framework. \n(iv)  Develop financial market infrastructure by establishing \ncommon  accounting  standards  and  enforcement \nmechanisms,  and  promulgating  laws  to  underpin \ncommercial activities and financial markets.  \n \nGiven  the  progress  achieved  under  subprograms  I  and  II, \nsubprogram III includes the following key initiatives: \n \n(i)  Enhance banking infrastructure by adopting a secured \ntransaction  law,  establishing  a  public  registry  for \nsecured  transactions,  and  establishing  a  financial \nintelligence unit responsible for anti-money laundering \nand  combating  the  financing  of  terrorism.  This  will \npromote and maintain principles of transparency and \naccountability  through  the  attainment  of  international \nstandards  to  minimize  the  money  laundering  risk  by \nimplementing  a  robust  compliance  and  monitoring \nregime.  \n(ii)  Enact  commercial  laws  and  building  capacity  by  (a) \nadopting  commercial  arbitration  legislation;  (b) \nsubmitting an insolvency law to the National Assembly; \n(c) disseminating commercial laws via the Internet, and \nhelping  develop  commercial  law  curriculum  including ", "iii \nthe training of judges, lawyers, and legal staff in the new \ncommercial laws; (d) improving the framework for the \ninsurance subsector by strengthening supervision and \nprudential  regulations  through  adoption  of  necessary \nprocedures  and  building  overall  capacity  of  the \ninsurance  regulator;  and  (e)  enhancing  the \ncompetitiveness  of  the  insurance  market  by \nrestructuring  a  public  sector  insurance  company  and \ndivesting its ownership to the private sector.  \n(iii)  Prepare  the  foundation  for  interbank  and  money \nmarkets  by  adopting  legislation  on  negotiable \ninstruments  and  payment  transactions,  implementing \nthe  negotiable  instruments  and  payment  transactions \nlaw through appropriate regulations, and training staff.  \n(iv)  Develop accounting and auditing practices by assisting \nthe  professional  association  in  training  professional \nmembers to required accreditation levels. \n \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of SDR6,763,000 ($10 million) will be provided from ADB\u2019s \n  Special  Funds  resources.  The  loan  will  have  a  24-year  term\n  including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest rate of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter.  \n   \nProgram Period and   The loan will be released in one tranche upon fulfillment of all \nTranching  specified tranche conditions. Subprogram III will be implemented \nover 18 months. \n   \nExecuting Agency  The National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) will continue to be the \nExecuting  Agency,  and  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance \n(MEF)  and  the  Ministry  of  Commerce  (MOC)  the  implementing \nagencies  for  subprogram  III.  To  coordinate  program \nimplementation  among  government  ministries  and  agencies \nconcerned,  a  financial  sector  steering  committee  was  formed. \nChaired by the NBC governor, the committee comprises senior \nofficers from MEF, MOC, NBC, and other government agencies \nconcerned. The committee will meet every quarter and on an ad-\nhoc basis to review pending issues and propose concrete actions \nfor their resolution, thus ensuring timely program implementation. A \nsenior NBC officer, appointed program director, will continue to \nassist  ADB,  NBC,  MEF,  and  MOC  in  coordinating  day-to-day \nprogram implementation. \n   \nProcurement  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange \ncosts (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and \nprocured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items and \nimports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  In \naccordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program \nLoans,  the  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  be  disbursed  to ", "iv \nCambodia as the Borrower. No supporting import documentation \nwill  be  required,  if  during  each  year  that  loan  proceeds  are \nexpected to be disbursed, the value of Cambodia\u2019s total imports \nminus imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, and \nimports  financed  under  other  official  development  assistance  is \nequal to or greater than the amount of the loan expected to be \ndisbursed  during  such  year.  The  Government  will  certify  its \ncompliance  with  this  formula  with  each  withdrawal  request. \nOtherwise, import documentation under existing procedures will be \nrequired. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of loan proceeds \nand verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n   \nCounterpart Funds  The  policy  framework  for  the  Program  includes  specific \ncomponents that bear distinct costs of structural adjustments. The \ncounterpart funds to be generated from loan proceeds will be used \nto finance the structural adjustment costs arising from the FSPL. \n   \nRisks and Safeguards  The principal risks associated with subprogram III relate to the \nnumber of bills that require passage by the National Assembly. The \nbills have the active support of the ministries concerned and NBC. \nThese  agencies  have  undertaken  to  explain  the  bills  to  the \nlegislators and are working closely with the key legislators in the \nconcerned committees so that they understand the important role \neach legislation will play. In addition to the strong support of the \nsponsoring  government  agencies,  most  of  the  bills  are  at  an \nadvanced  stage  of  consideration  by  the  National  Assembly.  In \nJune 2005 an amendment to the constitution reduced the required \nnumber of  National Assembly  members needed to constitute a \nquorum for the purpose of passing a law\u2014from 87 to 74 members. \nThis should help speed up the passage of laws. \n \nThe  establishment  of  institutions  such  as  the  NBC  financial \nintelligence  unit  and  upgrading  of  the  insurance  regulator  are \nsubject to the availability of funding and the commitment of the \nofficials  and  agencies  concerned.  Most  of  these  institutional \ndevelopments will be supported through budgetary allocations, at \nleast in part from counterpart funds under the Program. In addition, \nthese activities will be supported through technical assistance (TA) \nattached to subprogram III or from other development partners. All \nof these proposals have the strong backing of the government \nagencies concerned and are not reliant solely on the support from \nindividual officers. \n \nThe implementation results achieved under subprograms I and II \nunderscore the belief that these risks are manageable.  \n   \nTechnical Assistance  ADB will provide TA ($0.5 million) to support NBC, MEF, and MOC \nin implementing the various policy and institutional reforms under \nsubprogram III. The main TA activities include (i) technical support \nto  NBC  in  its  efforts  to  improve  its  on-site  supervision  and \nsurveillance of banks; (ii) technical support to MEF to help with its ", "v \nefforts to strengthen the capacity of the insurance regulator and the \nrestructuring of the state-owned insurance company (Caminco); \nand  (iii)  technical  support  to  MOC  in  its  efforts  to  implement \ncommercial laws and associated regulations. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Kingdom of Cambodia for subprogram III of the Financial Sector Program. The report also \ndescribes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Financial Sector Program Implementation, and \nif the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, will approve the TA. \n \nII.  BACKGROUND \n2.  The overall objective of the FSPL is to promote the development of a sound, market-\nbased financial system to enhance resource mobilization and support sustainable economic \ngrowth by establishing a foundation for banking and insurance, and developing the financial \nmarket. The FSPL adopted a program cluster approach with three subprograms based on \nADB\u2019s program lending policy. Each succeeding subprogram was to be processed sequentially \nupon completion of the preceding subprogram.  \n \n3.  The ADB Board approved subprogram I for $10 million on 15 November 2001, to be \nreleased in two tranches of $5 million each.1 Both tranches were fully disbursed by the end of \n2002. Subprogram II was approved on 28 November 2002 for $10 million, again to be released \nin two tranches of $5 million each to continue the reform activities under subprogram I.2 The \nLoan Agreement was signed on 11 December 2002 and subprogram II became effective on 21 \nFebruary 2003. The release of the first tranche was initially scheduled to occur within 6 months \nof loan effectiveness (August 2003) but because of the national election in 2003 and the 1-year \ndelay in forming the new government, it was rescheduled to May 2005. The second tranche was \ninitially scheduled for release within 12 months of loan effectiveness (February 2004) but similar \nto  the  first  tranche,  the  release  date  was  rescheduled  to  May  2005.  The  closing  date  of \nsubprogram II was extended twice from 31 December 2004 to 30 June 2005, and again to 31 \nDecember  2005.  The  latter  extension  was  to  allow  for  internal  processing  of  the  Board \ndocuments. The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1, Achievements of \nSubprograms I and II and Proposed Actions for Subprogram III is in Appendix 6. The summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 2. \n \n4.  In  seeking  ADB  Board  approval  of  subprogram  III,  the  lessons  learned  during \nsubprogram II implementation, the status of the agreed policy reform actions, and the readiness \nof the Government to undertake further reform measures were considered. The program cluster \napproach  provides  the  opportunity  to  discuss  and  refine  the  proposed  policy  actions  of \nsucceeding  subprograms  to  reflect  the  Government\u2019s  achievements,  changes  in  the  policy \nenvironment,  and  lessons  learned  from  the  previous  subprogram.  The  program  cluster \napproach  enhances  flexibility  and  allows  more  effective  design  of  reform  measures  in  a \nchanging political, economic, and financial environment. \n \n5.  To support FSPL implementation, ADB provided three TAs.3 Technical inputs provided \nthrough the TAs were indispensable for completing policy actions under subprograms I and II. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001.

A slower growth scenario is expected for Cambodia with the cessation of phase IV \ngarment quotas among World Trade Organization members at the end of 2004.4 In the early \nmonths  of  2005,  about  20,000  jobs  were  lost  in  the  garment  industry  and  export  prices \ndecreased significantly. Nevertheless, new facilities are being constructed to produce alternative \ncategories of garments to take advantage of the recent announcement of possible safeguard \nmeasures by the United States against the People\u2019s Republic of China and the internationally \ncompetitive  local  labor  market.  At  the  same time,  strong  growth  continues  in  tourism  and \nconstruction. The economy is expected to gradually recover from its anticipated slow growth of \n2.3% in 2005 up to close to 5% in 2007.5  \n \n7.  The macroeconomic environment has been reasonably well managed and is stable. \nWhile the real gross domestic product (GDP) compound growth averaged 4.5% per annum \nduring 2000\u20132004, consumer price index inflation was constrained to 2.6% per year and the \nexchange rate for the riel has been broadly stable with a depreciation of less than 1% per year \nduring this period. Budgetary performance improved somewhat in 2004.6 Total revenue rose by \n1% to 11.3% of GDP in 2004, partly due to one-off revenue collected from tax arrears. The \naccumulation of arrears was under control resulting in an overall budget deficit of 5.1% of GDP \nin 2004 compared with a deficit of 6.6% in 2003. This financial stability is derived from the well-\nmanaged fiscal and prudent monetary policy given the high dollarization of the economy.  \n \n8.  Since 2002, much has been achieved in developing governance infrastructure and in \npreparing for private sector development. The Government has been proactive in undertaking \nreforms in accounting and auditing practices in the private sector. Cambodia\u2019s accession to the \nWorld Trade Organization in late 2003 intensified the Government\u2019s efforts to introduce new \ncommercial  laws  and  implementing  regulations;  strengthen  the  supervision  of  banks, \nmicrofinance institutions, and insurance subsectors; increase international trade; and reform \nlabor and public finance. \n \n9.  The formation of a new government on 15 July 2004 represented a major step forward in \nCambodia\u2019s political development. Notwithstanding the time taken to form the new government, \na peaceful process of dialogue ensued, where all outstanding differences between political \nparties were apparently resolved without recourse to the violence that characterized previous \nelection  outcomes.  The  commune  elections  of  2002  represented  an  important  step  in  the \ncomprehensive program of political, administrative, and financial decentralization. Civil society \nand nongovernment organizations are participating more in various areas of public concern and \nfreedom of the media is progressing.7 \n    \n                                                                                                                                                          \nInfrastructure in the Financial Sector.

Review of Implementation Progress for Subprogram II  \n10.  In line with the FSPL objectives, the Government adopted legal, policy, and institutional \nmeasures under subprogram II. Many measures required extensive coordination to ascertain \nstakeholders' understanding, acceptance, and adoption. By end June 2005, the Government \nhad  complied  with  all  eight  first  tranche  conditions  and  four  of  the  five  second  tranche \nconditions. The one remaining second tranche condition requires the formation of a joint venture \nbetween the state-owned insurance company (Caminco) and a private insurance company. \nDiscussions for a joint venture with the nominated private sector company, Indochine, broke \ndown when Indochine went into liquidation. The Government demonstrated its commitment to \nthis  condition  through  the  following:  (i)  the  Prime  Minister  has  given  his  support  to  the \nprivatization of Caminco; and (ii) a public notice was issued inviting expressions of interest from \nprivate sector companies to invest in Caminco. Two proposals that were not responsive to the \nrequirements  of  the  public  notice  were  received  by  the  closing  date  (30  April  2005).  The \nGovernment\u2019s request for a waiver was supported by ADB management on 19 July 2005. The \nprogress report for subprogram II, including recommendations for approval of the waiver and the \nrelease of the first and second tranches of subprogram II, were submitted to the Board of \nDirectors for consideration on a no-objection basis on 11 August 2005. Both tranches were \nreleased on 30 August 2005. \n \n  1.  Development of the Banking Subsector Infrastructure  \n \n11.  Subprogram II of the FSPL supports the development of banking infrastructure by way of \nthree first-tranche conditions and one second-tranche condition that requires NBC to (i) adopt a \nuniform chart of bank accounts and disclosure rules for commercial banks consistent with \ninternational accounting standards (IAS); (ii) apply the uniform chart of bank accounts and \ndisclosure rules for the commercial banks consistent with IAS to the Rural Development Bank \nand other specialized banks; (iii) ensure that the Center for Banking Studies (CBS) establishes \na central banking course for NBC professional staff, including a mandatory training program for \nentry-level professional staff; and (iv) adopt a guideline for sharing credit information among \nmembers of the bankers association and, together with the bankers association, establish such \narrangements. \n \n12.  As of 31 March 2005, and with TA provided by ADB, all 14 commercial banks and 3 \nspecialized banks including the Rural Development Bank, had complied with implementation of \nthe chart of accounts and disclosure rules consistent with IAS. NBC also issued a prakas8  on \n29 December 2004 requiring all commercial banks and specialized banks to publish their annual \naudited financial statements beginning 30 June 2005. NBC will continue to monitor compliance \nwith the application of the chart of accounts by all commercial banks and specialized banks \nthrough on-site and off-site supervision.  \n \n13.  On 2 July 2003, CBS introduced an associate degree program, an entry-level training \nprogram for new NBC staff, and a managerial training program. By the end of 2004, CBS had \ntrained three separate intakes totaling 254 students, of whom 210 were non-NBC staff. In 2005, \nCBS revised and upgraded these courses to meet the challenges for developing the banking \nsystem. It has a new associate degree program. Following a request from NBC and CBS, ADB \n                                                 \n8 Khmer name for regulations and/or instructions issued by the governor of the NBC or a Government minister. ", "4   \nfielded a consultant for 1 month, beginning 3 June 2005, to strengthen the capabilities of the \ntrainers and advise CBS on how to achieve financial sustainability in the medium to long term.  \n \n14.  NBC signed a memorandum of understanding with 16 banks9 outlining guidelines for \nestablishing a credit information sharing system on a pilot basis. The arrangement for credit \ninformation  sharing  is  aimed  at  reducing  uncertainties  surrounding  lending  operations  of \ncommercial and specialized banks, and will enhance financial intermediation. Consultants under \nthe small and medium enterprises TA10 are developing the operating system plus a code of \nconduct, expected to be adopted later in 2005, to aid system implementation.  \n \n  2.  Development of Interbank and Money Markets \n    \n15.  Recent ADB missions recognized the efforts made by NBC in this area. The Prime \nMinister submitted the draft law on negotiable instruments and payment transactions to the \nNational Assembly on 18 January 2005, thus fulfilling the required condition. Discussions of \nCommittee 2 began in March 2005. Expected to be approved by June 2006, the draft law will \nprovide  the  legal  basis  for  developing  payment  systems,  introducing  new  negotiable \ninstruments, and promoting development of a money market.  \n \n  3.  Strengthening of the Legal and Regulatory Framework  \n \n16.  Subprogram II supported the development of the legal and regulatory framework by way \nof one first tranche and two second tranche conditions that required (i) adoption of a commercial \nenterprises law; (ii) submission to the National Assembly of a secured transactions law; and (iii) \nadoption  by  MOC  of  a  time-bound  action  plan  to  establish  a  public  registry  for  secured \ntransactions, acceptable to ADB. The National Assembly ratified the draft law on commercial \nenterprises on 17 May 2005 and the Royal Kram promulgating the law was issued on 19 June \n2005. The approved law is the equivalent of a corporation law and provides the legal basis for \nregistered and nonregistered corporations, their shareholders, and management to operate. It \nincludes  provisions  for  the  preparation  of  corporate  financial  reports,  auditing,  and  the \nprocedures  for  transfer  of  shares.  This  forms  part  of  the  necessary  prerequisites  for  the \nestablishment of a securities and exchange market. \n \n17.  Early in 2005, MOC submitted the draft secured transactions law to the Council of \nMinisters, which formally approved it on 10 June 2005. The draft legislation was submitted to \nthe National Assembly with a letter signed by the Prime Minister on 13 July 2005. In response to \nthe tranche condition requiring a time-bound action plan for the establishment of a secured \ntransactions registry, on 6 May 2005 MOC adopted a time-bound action plan (acceptable to \nADB) and submitted a proposal with an estimated budget of $200,000 to MEF to set up the \nregistry. The establishment of the secured transactions registry will facilitate the enforcement of \nfinancial  contracts  and  encourage  private  sector  lending  activities.  ADB  will  arrange  for \nconsultants11 to help MOC and MEF with the procurement for the registry system, including \nresponding to technical questions about specifications and assisting with bid evaluation.  \n \n                                                 \n9  The only nonparticipating bank is not undertaking general credit extension to individuals and domestic business in \nCambodia. \n10  ADB. 2004.

Based on the provisions of the insurance law, three interministerial prakas were issued \non  16  October  2002  with  regulations  for  compulsory  insurance  of  liabilities  arising  from \nconstruction work, public transport accidents, and motor vehicle third party policies. These are \nthe main insurance products available locally in a sector comprising a state-owned insurer \n(Caminco) and three private companies (Indochine, Asia Insurance, and Forte). The company, \nIndochine, is now undergoing liquidation. The total premium market (gross) was more than $10 \nmillion in 2004. MEF is presently reviewing model legislation, regulations, and practices in the \nregion with a view to promoting the expansion of the insurance products and the level of \nbusinesses in Cambodia.  \n \n19.  One of the aims of the Program is to restructure the state-owned company (Caminco) \nthrough a joint venture arrangement with a private insurance company. MEF made an important \nstep toward restructuring Caminco when it set up a reinsurance company, Cambodia Re, in \n2002 and divested the reinsurance function of Caminco. Cambodia Re became a joint venture \nwith a consortium of five international insurance companies in October 2002. The consortium \nholds 20% of Cambodia Re\u2019s shares. The Government envisaged a joint venture between \nCaminco  and  a  local  private  insurance  firm  (Indochine)  when  subprogram  II  was  being \nprocessed, but that did not come about as the private firm became insolvent and entered \nliquidation. The Government13 has continued to strongly support commercialization of Caminco; \nrestructuring will begin under subprogram III.  \n \n20.  With the Prime Minister\u2019s endorsement of the privatization of Caminco in early 2005, \nMEF issued a public notice inviting expressions of interest from local and international insurance \ncompanies to invest in, at most, 49% of the capital shares of Caminco in line with legislative \nlimitations. Two nonresponsive proposals were received by the closing date of 30 April 2005.14 \nIn light of the foregoing steps, MEF has unsuccessfully made extensive efforts to find a joint \nventure partner for Caminco. The ADB mission of May 2005 proposed that the process be \npursued as part of the restructuring plan for Caminco and the upgrading of the insurance \nregulator under subprogram III. A short term consultant under the TA for Improving Insurance \nSupervision (footnote 3) was fielded in early July 2005 to help finalize Caminco\u2019s restructuring \nplan. The appraisal mission of July 2005 reviewed the first draft of the restructuring plan and \nrequested a revision to clearly identify objectives, key actions, and target completion dates. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n12  Two policy actions are required: (i) MEF, in consultation with related ministries, to adopt regulations for the \ndevelopment of compulsory insurance (first tranche); and (ii) MEF to establish a joint venture between the state-\nowned insurance company and a private company (second tranche). \n13  The ADB mission of July 2004 discussed and agreed with MEF an action plan that included strict enforcement of \nthe current regulatory framework; rationalization of the legal and regulatory framework focusing on capital, \nauthorization, and accounting disclosure requirements; strengthening the capacity of the insurance regulator; and \nenforcing regulations equitably on all insurance firms. The action plan has the objective of restoring confidence and \nintegrity in the insurance market. Successful implementation of the plan is expected to complement any joint \nventure reform activities that may eventuate for Caminco. Implementation of the plan has been monitored closely, \nbut not much progress has been made, raising concerns about the technical capacity of the Department of \nFinancial Industry to implement the plan effectively. Technical support for the insurance regulator is included in the \nattached TA for subprogram III. \n14  The first proposal was predicated only on majority ownership (or more than 51% of the shares) and was made by a \nlocal firm with no prior insurance experience. The second proposal was a general letter from a competitor \ninsurance company with no specific proposal to purchase shares. ", "6   \n \n  5.  Development of Accounting and Auditing Practices  \n \n21.  Subprogram  II  supported  the  development  of  accounting  and  auditing  through  two \nconditions in the first tranche and one condition in the second tranche: (i) the National Assembly \nwill adopt a law on corporate accounts, their audit, and the accounting profession; (ii) MEF will \nadopt a subdecree requiring the application of IAS and international standards for auditing (ISA) \nto all companies (including insurance companies) incorporated in Cambodia, and establishing a \nnational accounting council (NAC) to set and interpret standards; and (iii) MEF will establish an \nassociation of accountants and auditors that will (a) adopt a code of ethics that complies with \nrequirements of the International Federation of Accountants, and (b) establish committees on \neducation and ethics within the association.  \n \n22.  With the consistent efforts of MEF, the National Assembly adopted the law covering \ncorporate  accounts,  their  audit,  and  the  accounting  profession  on  8  July  2002.  NAC  was \nestablished in March 2003 by a subdecree and its members were appointed by the minister of \neconomy  and  finance.  NAC  has  since  adopted  15  accounting  standards  and  10  auditing \nstandards based on international standards. The subdecree on the creation of the Kampuchea \nInstitute of Certified Public Accountants and Auditors (KICPAA) was adopted on 19 March 2003. \nOn 10 February 2005, NAC proposed the establishment of committees on education and ethics \nwithin KICPAA to the minister of economy and finance. Prakas no. 199 on the formation of a \ncommission for work, study, and research was issued on 4 April 2005 and prakas no. 222 on \nthe formation of a professional ethics commission was issued on 12 April 2005. The subdecree \ncovering the code of ethics for KICPAA was approved by the Council of Ministers on 3 June \n2005 and endorsed by the Prime Minister on 17 June 2005. These activities effectively establish \nthe legal and institutional framework to advance accounting and auditing practices in Cambodia.  \n \nB.  Impact on the Financial Sector \n23.  The financial sector performance has made satisfactory progress, albeit from a low \nbase. Financial deepening has improved, reflecting the financial stability and increased financial \nservices promoted through institutional reforms supported under the FSPL. Broad money supply \n(M2) to GDP has risen from 12.8% of GDP in 2000 before the start of the Program to 21.4% of \nGDP in 2004, a major structural improvement. Credit to the private sector has correspondingly \nrisen  from  6.5%  of  GDP  in  2000  to  an  estimated  9.9%  in  2004.  Through  the  relicensing \nprogram,15 16  banks  (including  4  insolvent  banks)  were  closed,  1  was  downgraded  to  a \nrepresentative office, and the remaining banks were required to strengthen their capital position. \nAll existing banks were well capitalized and relatively liquid at the end of 2004 with an average \ncapital adequacy ratio to risk weighted asset of 35% and a loan to deposit ratio of just under \n60%.  The  financial  sector  is  now  playing  an  increasingly  important  role  in  intermediating \nsavings,  accelerating  investment  formation,  and  providing  an  increasing  range  of  banking \nservices to the private sector.  \n \n24.  Confidence in the banking sector appears to be growing as well as appreciation that \nbanking facilities can be profitably expanded to meet the growing demand for banking services. \nThe ANZ (Australia-New Zealand) Bank from Australia has entered into a joint venture with a \ndomestic consortium16 to open a new commercial bank in Phnom Penh with two branches \n                                                 \n15 Supported by a 3-year International Monetary Fund poverty reduction and growth facility completed in 2002. Under \nthis program, all commercial banks were required to hold at least $13 million equivalent of capital or a minimum \nsolvency ratio (ratio of capital to the total risk weighted assets) of 20%, subsequently reduced to 15% in 2004. \n16  The consortium is the Royal Group. ", "    7 \nopened in August 2005 and the main head-office to be opened in early September 2005. The \nVietnam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development opened a representative office in Phnom \nPenh on 11 July 2005. The Association of Cambodian Local Economic Development Agencies \nwas established in January 1993 as a national nongovernment organization for micro and small \nenterprise credit and has since expanded rapidly throughout Cambodia. In December 2001, \nNBC  granted  the  association  a  full  banking  license  and  by  the  end  of  March  2005,  the \nassociation had 134 offices with 2,285 staff providing full banking services to 126,040 borrowers \nthroughout most of Cambodia.  \n \n25.  Other nonbank financial services have been slow to develop and are currently in the \nearly stages of development. For example, the insurance industry has been spurred by the new \nregulations requiring insurance in three mandated areas, including motor vehicles. Nevertheless \nthe  market  was  still  only  estimated  to  be  about  $10  million  of  gross  premium  income  in \n2004.The market is made up of about 50\u201360% of motor vehicle premium income with marine \nand casualty insurance the next largest class. The very modest size of the insurance market \nreflects the fact that most of commercial insurance is placed off-shore, while most Cambodians \nhave traditionally gone without insurance cover. The absence of contract enforcement through \nthe court system has meant that Cambodians have not relied on formal insurance.  \n \n26.  While  the  outreach  of  banking  services  expanded  during  subprogram  II,  very  slow \nprogress has been made in nonbank financial services such as insurance, pension funds, hire-\npurchase, and leasing. As such the scope for expansion through existing bank as well as \nnonbank financial services is very large given the relatively small and underdeveloped nature of \nthe financial market. Financial sector development can increasingly contribute to the efficient \ntransformation of savings into productive investments, particularly within the private sector.  \n \nC.  Lessons Learned \n27.  Throughout implementation, steady progress has been made in implementing the overall \nFinancial Sector Program and complying with the specified policy conditions in line with program \nobjectives. However, completing policy measures have required significantly more time than \noriginally  envisioned  in  addition  to  the  almost  1-year  delay  in  forming  the  new  National \nAssembly  following  the  2003  general  election.  In  drafting  laws  and  supporting  rules  and \nregulations, such as the draft commercial enterprises and secured transactions laws, technical \ninputs were indispensable. The TAs successfully ensured that best practices were incorporated \nand then consolidated throughout the consultation period to achieve the intended results.  \n \n  1.  Development of Banking Subsector Infrastructure  \n \n28.  Progress  in  the  development  of  banking  has  been  significant  due  to  strong  NBC \nownership. ADB commends NBC\u2019s achievements to date and expects these to be reinforced \nunder subprogram III, in particular in the area of banking supervision. \n \n  2.  Strengthening of the Legal and Regulatory Framework  \n \n29.  Fostering a solid understanding of the underlying legal concepts and mechanisms for \nmodernizing the financial system and ensuring consultation with all stakeholders, including the \nprivate sector, are assessed as having long-term positive impacts on sustainability of program \noutputs. Given the experience under subprogram II, and specifically the need for consensus \nbuilding, additional time is required to fulfill policy measures for tranche releases requiring the \npassage of legislation. The general election of 2003 and the subsequent delay in forming the ", "8   \nnew National Assembly were events beyond control that caused delays to the passage of \nseveral laws. At the same time, several layers of committees within the Council of Ministers and \nthe National Assembly were overlooked in the proposed timing for adoption of key legislation \nduring program processing. \n \n30.  The introduction of the commercial enterprises law will facilitate development of the \ncorporate sector. The introduction of the draft secured transactions law and adoption of a time-\nbound program for establishing the secured transactions registry will greatly assist companies\u2019 \naccess  to  funding.  The  proposed  negotiable  instruments  law  will  promote  money  market \ninstruments, such as certificates of deposits and short-term treasury bills, and improve the \nmarket structure by introducing money brokerage firms to penetrate the segmented banking \nsubsector.  However  for  active  secondary  trading  in  the  money  market  to  take  place,  the \ncommercial orientation of NBC, commercial banks, and the private sector must be significantly \nimproved.  \n \n  3.  Development of the Insurance Subsector  \n \n31.  The  insurance  subsector  is  still  in  its  early  stage  of  development.  The  underlying \nconcepts and business transactions are very new in Cambodia. While the FSPL has had some \nsuccess in transforming insurance agents to fully functional insurance firms to compete with the \nstate-owned insurance company, the outcome has been mixed. Reorienting the Government\u2019s \nrole from sole operator to regulator has not been easy as most staff have had no prior formal \ntraining or experience in insurance. This is a process that will take time with ongoing technical \nguidance. The ADB mission of May 2005 proposed capacity support to help the reform activities \nin this subsector plus needed implementation and TA support under subprogram III. \n \n  4.  Development of Accounting and Auditing Practices \n \n32.  Under  MEF  leadership,  substantial  progress  in  the  development  of  accounting  and \nauditing practices was achieved. Major contributing factors include the strong commitment of \nthe MEF and NAC, which has contributed to establishing appropriate regulatory and institutional \nframeworks. However, buy-in from other parts of the Government, including budgetary support \nfor NAC and KICPAA activities and the training of members to reach appropriate qualifications \nis needed.  \n \nV.  THE PROPOSED SUBPROGRAM III \nA.  Revised Policy Actions for Subprogram III  \n33.  Progress with reforms and the Government\u2019s growing capacity to implement reforms \nindicates the need for continued support under subprogram III. In formulating subprogram III, all \npolicy actions proposed under the FSPL cluster concept of three subprograms were revisited in \ndiscussions with the Government. That led to certain policy actions being dropped, revised or \nnewly  added,  reflecting  the  Government\u2019s  achievements,  evolving  policy  environment,  and \nlessons learned from subprograms I and II implementation. Relative to the previously proposed \npolicy matrix for subprogram III, three of the seven conditions have been either dropped or \ndeferred for reasons stated in paras. 34-35.  \n \n34.  Development  of  a  deposit  insurance  system  has  been  omitted  from  the  proposed \nrevision  of  the  subprogram  III  policy  matrix  in  view  of  the  direction  of  developments  in \nCambodia's banking subsector. This change reflects the outcome of the dialogue with NBC ", "    9 \nofficials who would have had the responsibility for implementing the system and managing the \nresulting moral hazards engendered. Ongoing support to bank on-site supervision is aimed at \nreinforcing  the  need  for  bank  management  to  be  more  vigilant  and  take  responsibility  for \noperating results. In the interest of depositors, banks are now required to publish their audited \nannual financial reports with effect from June 2005. All banks are highly capitalized, following \nthe International Monetary Fund (IMF) relicensing program in 2000. Further, the development of \nthe draft securities and exchange law could be deferred to a later program considering the very \nnascent stage of the securities market. The Council of Ministers is discussing a draft law on \nGovernment securities to regulate the issuance and management of Government securities \nbefore submission to the National Assembly. This will facilitate development of the bond market. \n \n35.  A banking institute for private bank staff was established in January 2004 under the \nadministration of the bankers association. ADB supported several short-term training courses. \nMekong Private Sector Development Facility staff are overseeing the progress of the institute \nand  guiding  the  bankers  association  on  how  best  to  sustain  training  programs  offered. \nConsidering this development and progress, the originally proposed policy action is not retained \nunder subprogram III. \n \n36.  The legal infrastructure to support the growing body of commercial law sponsored under \nthese  subprograms  needs  to  be  further  developed.  The  recognition  of  property  rights  as \nreflected in a strong body of commercial law is one essential component for a well-functioning \nfinancial sector. Equally important is a robust and independent court system, supported by a \nwell-educated and functioning judiciary and legal profession. An arbitration center for resolving \nminor commercial disputes will be established following enactment of the law on commercial \narbitration. In addition, the capability to enforce those rights that gives the enacted commercial \nlaws their meaning and effect is also required.17 Similarly an insolvency law is needed to help \nenforce contractual and property rights. \n \n37.  In light of these concerns, the revised subprogram III policy matrix includes measures to \n(i) develop the legal infrastructure, including substantial capacity building in legal education to \ntrain judges and lawyers in new commercial laws; and (ii) disseminate (by MOC) the commercial \nlaws via the Internet. These measures will involve enhancing the law faculties\u2019 course offerings \nin commercial laws for the education of new lawyers and continuing legal education seminars in \nthe  application  of  these  new  commercial  laws  for  judges,  as  well  as  lawyers  and  other \nstakeholders.     \n \n38.  The draft legislation covering anti-money laundering and combating the financing of \nterrorism, now with the Council of Ministers, will require establishment of a financial intelligence \nunit  (FIU).  Experience  from  other  countries  has  shown  that  the  central  bank  must  gain \nexperience with these operations prior to introducing the law. To commence preparatory work \nfor establishing the FIU, a unit within NBC\u2019s banking supervision department will be established \nfollowing the approval of subprogram III. Staff of this unit will be trained on FIU activities. Once \nthe  law  is  passed  the  Australian  Transaction  Reports  and  Analysis  Centre  and  other \ndevelopment partners will likely be interested in providing implementation support. \n                                                 \n17  From Procter, Carlisle. 2005. Financial Sector Assessment Paper: Cambodia 2004. Manila: ADB: \u201cProperty rights \nare indispensable for the development of any market economy. To confidently trade goods or services it is \nabsolutely essential that agents know that \u2018the person selling it in fact owns it\u2019, and that impacts to such ownership \nwill strictly eventuate according to what contracts defined ex-ante. The stronger and clearer property rights are, the \nmore likely it is that trade of goods and services will take place, and that prices will be efficient. It is no coincidence \nthat an effective judicial system, as well as property rights for it to enforce, is a feature of advanced economies.\u201d \n ", "10   \n \n39.  In the insurance subsector, the Government will consolidate the work that commenced \nunder subprograms I and II to restructure and divest its shares in the state-owned insurance \ncompany (Caminco). This will enable MEF to focus on its regulatory role. The existing insurance \nlaw needs to be revised to allow share ownership beyond 49% of the state-owned insurance \nand reinsurance companies, and incorporate developments necessary to create new business \nopportunities. This will be addressed through ongoing policy dialogue with MEF. The attached \nTA  for  subprogram  III  includes  consulting  support  to  implement  the  restructuring  plan  for \nCaminco and assist the insurance regulator in performing its functions equitably. \n \n40.  Based  on  these  suggested  changes,  the  proposed  policy  matrix  for  subprogram  III \nincluding the expected completion dates is provided in Appendix 3. The policy matrix is in line \nwith the FSPL framework contained in the development policy letter of 4 October 2001 and the \nGovernment\u2019s approved financial sector blueprint for 2001\u20132010. IMF is the only multilateral aid \nagency involved in the financial sector. The ADB mission coordinated closely with IMF during \nsubprogram II implementation and preparation of subprogram III. \n \nB.  Progress with Policy Reform \n41.  Secured Transactions Law. Following formal approval by the Council of Ministers on \n10 June 2005, the draft law was submitted to the National Assembly together with a letter \nsigned by the Prime Minister on 13 July 2005. The National Assembly is in recess until 22 \nAugust 2005. MOC will, in consultation with the chairperson of Committee 9, determine when to \nbegin discussion. The draft law contains 55 articles, subdivided into 5 chapters. \n \n42.  Public Registry for Secured Transactions. MOC approved a time-bound action plan \nfor establishing the registry on 6 May 2005. ADB will provide TA (footnote 3) to help procure \nhardware and software and establish the online registry. \n \n43.  Financial Intelligence Unit. The draft law for anti-money laundering and combating the \nfinancing of terrorism is with the Council of Ministers and several articles have been reviewed in \nJuly 2005. Under the attached TA for subprogram III, ADB will provide consulting support to \nhelp establish the FIU. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre is planning to \nprovide software support to the FIU and train staff on its application. \n \n44.  Law  for  Commercial  Arbitration. Drafted in 1995 with support from the Canadian \nInternational Development Agency, the law was submitted to the National Assembly together \nwith the Commercial Enterprises Law in 2004. It is now with the Committee 9 of the National \nAssembly awaiting discussion. The National Assembly is in recess until 22 August 2005. MOC \nwill,  in  consultation  with  the  chairperson  of  Committee  9,  determine  when  to  commence \ndiscussion. The draft law contains 47 articles, subdivided into 11 chapters. \n \n45.  Insolvency Law. Drafted in 2002 with IMF support and submitted to the Council of \nMinisters in 2003, the draft law has gone through three interministerial debates. Fifteen of the 70 \narticles have been reviewed. Strong collaboration between MOC and the Ministry of Justice is \nrequired to ensure coherence and consistency with the draft civil code. The Ministry of Justice is \nreviewing the legal procedures and some of the definitional issues. It will take time to get this \nthrough the interministerial level before debate by the Council of Ministers.  \n \n46.  Dissemination of Commercial Laws. MOC is ready to post all laws adopted to date, \nbut is constrained by the capacity of its website. MOC has requested budget support from MEF. ", "    11 \nMOC is providing official copies of legislation for uploading onto the Internet: www.worldLII.org18 \n(World Legal Information Institute). \n \n47.  Commercial  Law  Curricula  Based  on  the  New  Commercial  Laws.  Under  the \nattached TA for subprogram III, ADB will provide consultant support to help MOC work with \nrelevant  law  institutes  to  develop  and  adopt  commercial  law  curricula  for  training  judges, \nlawyers, and legal and clerical staff, based on the new commercial laws. MOC is undertaking \nroadshows in the provinces to raise public awareness of the new commercial laws. \n \n48.  Prudential  Regulations  to  Enhance  Solvency,  Liquidity  and  Corporate \nGovernance.  Under the attached TA for subprogram III, ADB will provide consultant support to \nhelp  MEF  review,  update,  and  implement  appropriate  prudential  regulations  to  enhance \nsolvency,  liquidity,  and  corporate  governance  requirements;  and  support  the  insurance \nregulator. \n \n49.  Restructure CAMINCO. MEF has approved the restructuring plan for Caminco that was \nsubmitted by the Caminco Board of Directors. Under the attached TA for subprogram III, ADB \nwill provide consultant support to help MEF implement key activities of this plan and divest the \nGovernment\u2019s shares at the earliest opportunity. \n \n50.  Law  on  Negotiable  Instruments  and  Payment  Transactions.  The  draft  law  was \nsubmitted to the National Assembly with a letter from the Prime Minister dated 18 January 2005. \nAt the end of May 2005, Committee 2 of the National Assembly had reviewed three chapters. \n \n51.  Implementing Regulations for the Law on Negotiable Instruments and Payment \nTransactions. NBC will finalize details of an IMF TA to help draft the implementing regulations \nfor this law. Under the attached TA for subprogram III, ADB will provide support to help NBC \npublicly disseminate information on the new law and its implementing regulations. \n \n52.  Scholarships for Development of Professional KICPAA Members. The Government \nhas  been  providing  70  scholarships  annually  since  2003  to  train  candidates  to  reach  the \nKICPAA  accreditation  level.  MEF  is  expected  to  use  funds  from  the  subprogram  III  loan \nproceeds to ensure this continues. \n \nC.  Loan Amount and Tranching \n53.  The Government of Cambodia has requested a loan equivalent to SDR6,763,000 ($10 \nmillion) from the Special Funds resources to help finance subprogram III of the Financial Sector \nProgram. The loan will have a 24-year term including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate \nof 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other \nterms and condition set forth in the draft loan and program agreements. The Government has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under the Special Funds resources \non the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its \nown independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \nThe loan will be released in a single tranche upon satisfactory compliance with all tranche \nconditions. The implementation period for subprogram III is proposed to be 18 months from loan \neffectiveness. \n \n                                                 \n18  This webpage is part of ADB RETA 5820. (ADB. 1998. Regional Technical Assistance for Development of the \nInternet for Asian Law. Manila). ", "12   \n54.  If an international bank requires credit enhancement prior to investing in the financial \nsector, ADB may be in a position to provide the investor with a guarantee, based on the FSPL \nobjectives. Any guarantee proposed to be provided by ADB will be subject to a separate Board \npaper.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangement \n55.  Implementation arrangements adopted for subprograms I and II have been effective. \nAlthough weaknesses in Cambodia's public financial management systems have high costs in \nterms of allocation and operational efficiency and have resulted in high levels of fiduciary risk to \npublic funds,19 the Government is committed to a program of reforms identified in the ADB-\nWorld Bank Integrated Fiduciary Assessment and Public Expenditure Review of 2003. A World \nBank program to strengthen public financial management and accountability is expected to be \napproved by the end of 2005. Given ongoing efforts to strengthen public financial management, \nand the fact that ADB reserves the right to audit the use of loan funds and to verify the accuracy \nof  the  Borrower's  certification  of  compliance,  the  same  procedures  for  procurement  and \ndisbursement of funds and the use of counterpart funds under subprograms I and II, will be \napplied in subprogram III.  \n \n1.  Program Management \n56.  NBC will continue to be the Executing Agency for subprogram III, while MEF and MOC \nwill be the implementing agencies. NBC will continue to be responsible for overall program \nimplementation, including administration and disbursement of loan proceeds, maintenance of \naccounts, and preparation of quarterly progress reports. \n \n57.  To  coordinate  program  implementation  among  government  ministries  and  agencies \nconcerned, a financial sector steering committee was formed under subprogram I. Chaired by \nthe NBC governor, the committee comprises senior officers from MEF, MOC, NBC, and other \ngovernment agencies concerned. Under subprogram III, the committee will meet every quarter \nand on an ad-hoc basis to review pending issues and propose concrete actions to resolve them, \nthus ensuring timely program implementation. A senior NBC officer, appointed as program \ndirector under subprograms I and II, will continue to assist ADB, NBC, MEF, and MOC, in \ncoordinating day-to-day program implementation under subprogram III.  \n \n2.  Monitoring \n58.  ADB, jointly with NBC, MEF, and MOC, will continue to conduct quarterly reviews to \nassess progress in subprogram III implementation and in particular to confirm compliance with \ntranche conditions. The Government and ADB will continue to engage in active policy dialogue \non  sector  issues,  reforms,  and  other  measures;  and  agree  on  actions  necessary  to  keep \nsubprogram III on course.  \n \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement \n59.  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding \nlocal duties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding \nineligible items (Appendix 4) and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. In \n                                                 \n19   World Bank. 2005. Concept Note for Cambodia Public Financial Management and Accountability Project.  \nWashington D.C. ", "    13 \naccordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and \nRelated Requirements for Program Loans, the proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed \nto Cambodia as the Borrower. No supporting import documentation will be required, if during \neach year that loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed, the value of Cambodia\u2019s total \nimports minus imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed \nunder other official development assistance is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan \nexpected to be disbursed during such year.
