The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n\nA. \n\nInvestment Identification and Description \n\n2. \nThe  SCIF  was  recommended  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  by  the  PRC\u2019s \nNational  Development  and  Reform  Commission  in  support  of  their  dual  goals  of  mobilizing \nprivate  sector  finance  to  combat  climate  change  and  developing  the  PRC\u2019s  onshore  private \nequity  fund  market.  The  fund  seeks  to  promote  resource  conservation  and  environmental \nprotection  by  investing  in  companies  and  projects2\n in  sectors  related  to  climate  change  in  the \nPRC, and to provide fund investors with stable, long-term capital gains. The targeted fund size \nwill  be  CNY1,300  million,  with  a  first  closing  of  about  CNY650  million.  The  second  and  final \nclosing will occur 1 year after the first closing.  \n \nThe fund will be established in Tianjin Municipality as a foreign-invested venture capital \n3. \ninvestment  enterprise  (FIVCE).  It  will  be  managed  by  the  Tianjin  New  Cleansource  Fund \nManagement Company (the fund manager, the same legal entity as the sponsor).  \n \nOnshore  private  equity  fund.  The  SCIF  will  be  one  of  the  earliest  onshore  private \n4. \nequity funds exclusively targeting sectors related to climate change in the PRC, and ADB\u2019s first \ninvestment  in  a  CNY  fund.  Onshore  private  equity  funds  provide  the  critical  function  of \nchanneling  domestic  savings  into  productive  investments. Through  its  investment  in  the  SCIF, \nADB will help to introduce international best practices and set high governance and safeguard \nstandards  in  this  nascent  industry.  The  success  of  the  SCIF  will  demonstrate  a  practical \nmodality  for  mobilizing  and  integrating  international  and  domestic  financial  resources  and \nintellectual capital to promote investment in climate change related businesses and projects. \n \nB. \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\n5. \nThe  PRC  is  one  of the  largest  energy  consuming  and greenhouse gas (GHG)  emitting \ncountries  in  the  world.  Its  status  as  such  has  led  to  increasing  concern  about  energy  security \nand  growing  public  demand  for  reducing  energy  costs  and  addressing  climate  change  in  the \ncountry. This in turn has resulted in a convergence of social, political, economic, environmental, \nand  entrepreneurial  forces  that  is  collectively  driving  the  creation  of  vast  opportunities  for \nbusinesses to benefit as early movers in climate change and environmental technologies and to \ncapitalize on the substantial policy support that exists in the PRC for the country to transition to \nlow-carbon  and  climate-resilient  growth.  Equity  investment  is  in  high  demand  to  finance \nsustainable  growth  of  those  companies  focusing  on  improving  energy  efficiency,  developing \nrenewable energy, conserving resources, abating pollution, and reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) \nand other GHG emissions.    \n \n6. \nInvestment  strategy  and  selection  criteria.  The  fund  is  well  positioned  to  take \nadvantage  of  the  investment  opportunities  being  created  in  sectors  related  to  climate  change. \n\n                                                \n1 CNY financing funded from the ADB\u2019s offshore CNY bond proceeds. \n2 Investments in projects will be limited to a maximum of 10% of the fund\u2019s total committed capital. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n \n\nThe  SCIF  will  primarily  invest  in  companies  at  the  expansion  stage  in  energy  efficiency, \nrenewable  energy,  resource  recycling  and  conservation,  and  environment  protection.  The \nSCIF\u2019s portfolio companies are expected to have (i) attained preliminary success in technology \nor  commercial  operations;  (ii)  exhibited  strong  business  fundamentals  and  sustainable  growth \ntrends;  (iii)  committed  to  fully  meet  domestic  environmental  and  social  regulations  and \nrequirements, and to comply with all applicable safeguard and social policies of ADB as well as \nthe  anti-money  laundering  and  know-your-client  requirements;  and  (iv)  agreed  on  a  clear \nbusiness development strategy and exit path with the fund manager. \n \nC. \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\n1. \n\nOwnership \n\n7. \nSCIF has two anchor investors in the first closing, ZTE Energy (ZEN) and Bank of China \nGroup  Investment  Limited  (BOCGI).  ZEN  was  established  in  2007  in  Beijing  with  registered \ncapital  of  CNY1.29  billion.  It  makes  direct  and  controlling  investments  in  projects  designed  to \nthrough  energy  management \nproduce  renewable  energy,  enhance  energy  productivity \ncontracting  services,  and  protect  the  environment.  BOCGI  was  incorporated  in  Hong  Kong, \nChina  in  1984,  and  is  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  the  Bank  of  China.  It  is  a  leading \nprofessional  investment  management  company  and  a  pioneer  private  equity  investor  in  the \ngreater  PRC  region.  During  the  past  26  years,  BOCGI  has  invested  in  numerous  large \ninfrastructure projects in Hong Kong, China; Macau, China; mainland PRC; and overseas.  \n\n2. \n\nManagement \n\nThe  fund  manager  will  be  responsible  for  originating,  structuring,  and  negotiating \n8. \ntransactions;  making  recommendations  to  the  investment  committee  with  regard  to  the \nacquisition  and  disposition  of  portfolio  investments;  monitoring  portfolio  investments;  and \nassisting  in  the  administration  of  capital  calls  and  distributions  to  investors,  and  investor \nreporting.  \n\n \n\n3. \n\nGovernance Structure \n\nCorporate  governance.  The  fund  will  establish  an  advisory  board  consisting  of \n\n9. \nrepresentatives from each significant investors including ADB. \n\n10. \nA dedicated and independent custodian account will be set up with a creditworthy local \nbank to handle cash transactions and asset trusteeship for the SCIF to ensure fund security and \ntransparency.  \n \n11. \nInvestment process. The fund\u2019s investment process will comprise six cascading steps: \n(i)  project  initiation,  (ii)  preliminary  due  diligence,  (iii)  comprehensive  due  diligence  and \nevaluation,  (iv)  investment  decision-making  and  operations,  (v)  value-addition  services  and \nperformance  monitoring,  and  (vi)  divestment.  To  achieve  the  strategic  goals  of  the  SCIF,  the \nfund manager will adopt international best practices to screen, structure, analyze, execute, and \nmonitor the SCIF\u2019s investments. The fund manager will regularly conduct comprehensive sector, \nmarket, and policy analyses to support smooth and effective fund operations. A high priority will \nbe  placed  on  risk  identification  and  mitigation,  and  on  balancing  risks  against  anticipated \nreturns.   \n\n \n12. \nInvestment  committee.  The fund  will  establish  an  investment  committee  consisting of \nfive members. The investment committee will be responsible for updating the SCIF\u2019s investment \nstrategies,  priorities,  policies,  and  its  investment  management  systems,  covering  information \n\n\f3 \n\ncollection  and  analysis,  financial  valuation,  risk  identification  and  control,  and  performance \nmonitoring  and  evaluation.  The  investment  committee  will  review  and  make  decisions  on \ninvestment and divestment proposals in accordance with the SCIF policies and procedures.  \n \nD. \n\nFinancial Performance \n\n(The information in this section is withheld based on exception 9 in paragraph 126 of the PCP.) \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\nA. \n \n13. \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  make  an  equity  investment  of  up  to  CNY162.5  million  in  the \nSCIF, not exceeding 25% of the total commitments to the SCIF and not resulting in ADB being \nthe single largest investor in the SCIF. \n \nB. \n \n(The information in this section is withheld based on exception 9 in paragraph 126 of the PCP.) \n \nC. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nExpected Returns  \n\n(The information in this section is withheld based on exception 9 in paragraph 126 of the PCP.) \n \n\n1. \n\nExit Strategy  \n\n2. \n\nReporting Arrangements   \n  \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nCatalyzing  resource  mobilization \n\n14. \nADB  will  review  all  the  SCIF  reports  on  an  ongoing  basis,  along  with  information  on \nportfolio  valuation  and  performance  of  individual  portfolio  companies.  ADB  will  hold  a  seat  on \nthe SCIF\u2019s advisory board and will be involved in discussions and decisions related to corporate \ngovernance, adjustment of investment strategies, and conflicts of interest.  \n \n15. \nThe SCIF will retain a reputable accounting firm to conduct annual audits of its financial \nstatus  and  provide  investors  with  four  unaudited  quarterly  reports  and  one  audited  annual \nfinancial  report.  The  fund  will  also  submit  an  annual  report  on  its  environmental  and  social \nperformance. \n \nD. \n \n16. \ninvestments.  ADB\u2019s \ninvestment  in  one  of  the  first  onshore  private  equity  funds  targeting  sectors  related  to  climate \nchange will help to increase low-carbon financing in the PRC by demonstrating practical ways to \nachieve  a  decent  risk\u2013return  balance.  The  associated  financing  activities  of  the  portfolio \ncompanies, such as long-term debt borrowing, corporate bond issuing, mergers and acquisition, \ncarbon credit trading, risk insuring and guaranteeing, currency exchanging and hedging, asset \nrestructuring,  and  initial  public  offerings,  will  contribute  to  broaden  and  deepen  the  capital \nmarkets in the region.  \n    \n17. \nthe  design, \nestablishment, and operations of the SCIF will ensure that the SCIF and its portfolio companies \ncomply  with  the  highest  standard  of  governance  and  social  and  environmental  safeguards. \nGood  governance  will  increase  investor  protection  and  inspire  investor  confidence.  High \nsafeguard  standards  will  mitigate  the  risks  of  any  possible  social  and  environmental  damages \n\ninternational  best  practice.

By introducing international best practice \nto the SCIF, ADB\u2019s investment will have wider demonstration effects on the nascent industry of \nonshore private equity in the PRC.3\n  \n\n \nRisks \n\n \n\nE. \n \n.(The information in this section is withheld based on exception 9 in paragraph 126 of the PCP.) \n \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nA. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nImpact \n\n18. \nADB\u2019s investment in and assistance to the proposed climate change private equity fund \ncan  deliver  a  significant  development  impact  as  summarized  in  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework.  Over  the  long  run,  the  ADB  investment  will  help  reduce  GHG  emissions,  mitigate \nclimate change effects, and enhance national energy efficiency, diversity and security through (i) \nmobilizing  and  utilizing  market  instruments  and  mechanisms  to  leverage  more  financial \nresources  and  technical  support  to  expedite  growth  of  companies  concentrating  on  climate \nchange  businesses;  (ii)  facilitating  private  equity  market  development  with  a  focus  on  clean \nenergy  and  environmental  protection  industries;  (iii)  stimulating  financial  and  engineering \ninnovations  to  improve  energy  efficiency,  develop  renewable  energy,  conserve  natural \nresources, and protect the environment; and (iv) generating demonstration effects in both areas \nof  clean  technology  deployment  and  private  equity  fund  operations.  Since  the  poor  are  most \nvulnerable to energy insecurity and the adverse effects of climate change in terms of direct and \ninduced  damages  on  their  productivity,  income  opportunities,  and  health,  this  investment  will \ncontribute in reducing poverty and spurring environmentally friendly socioeconomic growth.   \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\nThe  outcome  of  ADB\u2019s  investment  will  be  mainly  reflected  in  the  increased  flows  of \n19. \nfunding  and  expertise  mobilized  to  support  sustainable  growth  of  companies  and  projects  in \nsectors related to climate change in the PRC. It will help demonstrate that it is viable for private \nequity  funds  to  invest  profitably  in  climate  change  companies  and  projects  that  will  generate \npositive environmental and social externalities while harvesting decent financial returns. Most of \nthe  SCIF\u2019s  portfolio  companies  will  adopt  international  standards  for  financial  reporting  and \ncorporate governance that are necessary for initial public offering in a regional stock market.  \n \n\n3. \n\nOutputs  \n\n20. \nThe key outputs of the proposed ADB investment will be the establishment of the SCIF \nfor the purpose of supporting companies and projects in sectors related to climate change in the \nPRC.  The  governance  structure,  decision  making  procedures,  environmental  and  social \nmanagement  system  (ESMS),  and  risk  management  systems  of  the  SCIF  shall  meet  ADB\u2019s \nrequirements.  The  fund  manager  will  identify,  screen,  and  evaluate  investment  opportunities \nand  provide  ongoing  management  advice  and  value-addition  services  to  the  SCIF\u2019s  portfolio \ncompanies.  \n\n                                                \n3  Value  Added  by  ADB  Assistance  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2)  contains  further          \n\ndiscussion on ADB\u2019s value addition. \n\n\f5 \n\n \nB. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\n21. \nThe  investment  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  fundamental  goals  of  promoting  inclusive \neconomic  growth  in  an  efficient,  equitable,  and  sustainable  manner  and  eliminating  poverty  in \nAsia  and  the  Pacific.  In  Strategy  2020, 4\n ADB  has  designated  energy  and  financial  market \ndevelopment as two core operational sectors; and achieving environmental sustainability as one \nof  three  strategic  priorities,  aiming  at  (i)  mitigating  climate  change  through  facilitating  the \ntransition  of  its  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  toward  low-carbon  economies;  and \n(ii) achieving  regional  energy  security  and  diversity  through  adopting  clean  technologies, \nimproving  energy  efficiency,  and  scaling  up  clean  energy  development.  Recognizing  the \nimportance of the private sector in realizing these objectives, Strategy 2020 has also highlighted \nthe greater roles of the private sector in this endeavor.   \n \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy,5 2008\u20132010 and country operations business plan,6\n22. \n \n2011\u20132013 for the PRC have emphasized balanced and sustainable growth with more efficient \nuses  of  resources  and  more  stringent  protection  of  the  environment.  The  investment  supports \nimplementation  of  the  PRC\u2019s  12th  Five-Year  Plan,  2011\u20132015,  which  highlights  resource \nconservation  and  environmental  protection  and  attaches  top  priority  to  improving  energy \nefficiency,  reducing  pollution  emissions,  and  developing  cleaner  and  renewable  energy,  while \nspecifically requiring that financial assistance from international financial institutions be used for \nresource conservation, environmental protection, and infrastructure development. \n   \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n\nADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy 7 of  2009  reiterates  the  essential  roles  of  the  private  sector  in \n23. \nimproving  access  to  affordable  and  reliable  energy  sources  and  in  securing  energy  market \nefficiency  and  competitiveness  in  the  region.  It  encourages  more  proactive  private  sector \nparticipation  and  public\u2013private  partnership  to  increase  investable  resources  and  to  transfer \ncleaner  technologies  to  the  energy  sector  in  ADB\u2019s  DMCs.  ADB  has  committed  to  double  its \ninvestments in clean energy projects to $2 billion per year by 2013. ADB\u2019s Environment Policy \n(2002)  has  similarly  corroborated  the  needs  for  reinforcing  poverty  alleviation,  mainstreaming \nenvironmental  protection,  and  strengthening  partnerships  with  relevant  stakeholders  including \nprivate sector entities. ADB\u2019s realigned strategic agenda on fighting climate change8\n states that \ntechnology  development  process,  collaborating  with \nADB  will  move  upstream \ngovernments, venture and private equity funds, and other partners to facilitate transferring and \ndeploying  clean  energy  technologies.  The  investment  is  clearly  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  energy, \nenvironment, and climate change policies. \n \n\nthe \n\nin \n\n3. \n\nLessons from Previous Operations \n\n24. \nADB has been working for nearly a decade to promote climate change financing and to \nsupport  private  equity  market  development  in  ADB\u2019s  DMCs.  The  lesson  drawn  from  previous \n\n                                                \n4  ADB.  2008.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n \n\ninvestments  is  that  incubating  funds  takes  time  and  effort.  As  a  result,  ADB  should  focus  on \nselecting  those  fund  managers  that  are  most  likely  to  succeed  in  fundraising  and  investment, \nbut  may  fall  short  without  ADB.  Relatively  few  private  equity  funds  focus  on  climate  change \nbusinesses  in  ADB\u2019s  DMCs,  and  it  is  much  rarer  in  the  case  of  onshore  funds.  When  ADB \nintends  to  develop  a  new  asset  class,  where few  managers  exist  and  ADB  does  not  have  the \nluxury to choose among established managers, it is appropriate for ADB to work with a first-time \nfund  manager.  Nevertheless,  a  great  deal  of  time  and  effort  is  needed  to  ensure  the  proper \nsetup,  successful  fundraising,  and  prudent  investments  of  a  first-time  fund.  ADB\u2019s  consistent \ncommitment and support will be critical to the ultimate success of the new asset class it seeks to \npromote.   \n\n \nAnother  lesson  learned  is  that  it  would  be  useful  to  supplement  strong  legal \n25. \nfunds  meet  ADB\u2019s \nto  ensure \ndocumentation  with  capacity  building \nenvironmental and social safeguard requirements. ADB\u2019s legal documentation makes submitting \na  compliant  ESMS  a  condition  precedent  for  drawdown.  ADB  is  also  implementing  technical \nassistance9\n to  provide  ESMS  training  to  investee  funds  that  have  not  submitted  a  compliant \nESMS  to  ADB.  These  measures  ensure  that  the  investee  funds  have  both  the  incentive  and \ncapacity to meet ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements.  \n \n\ninvestee \n\nthat  all \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nEnvironment and Social Safeguards \n\n \n\n26. \nADB\u2019s  investment  in  the  SCIF  has  been  classified  category  FI  (financial  intermediary) \nunder  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  SCIF  will  be  required  to  establish, \nmaintain,  and  implement  an  appropriate  ESMS  to  ensure  that  the  SCIF\u2019s  investments  are  in \ncompliance with applicable national laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s requirement prescribed in \nthe  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  The  SCIF  will  also  be  required  to  comply  with  the \nimplementation  of  ADB\u2019s  prohibited  investment  activities  list.  ADB  will  coordinate  with  fund \nmanager to ensure that the ESMS is adopted prior to disbursement for the first investment, and \nguide the fund manager in environmental and social safeguards due diligence, monitoring, and \nreporting10\n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n.  \n\n27. \nThe  fund  manager  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to \ndate) and Policy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n(2003).  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to good governance,  accountability,  and  transparency, \nADB  will  require  the  fund  manager  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures \nand  controls  following  international  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing \ncorruption or money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism and covenant with ADB to \nrefrain  from  engaging  in  such  activities.  ADB  will  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation \nincludes  appropriate  anticorruption  provisions  and  remedies  for  ADB  in  the  event  of \nnoncompliance.  The  investment  documentation  between  ADB  and  the  fund  will  further  allow \nADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings.  \n \n\n                                                \n9 ADB.  2010.
