The program\u2019s objective is to assist in implementing public financial management (PFM) \nreforms in three rural development ministries, including support to strengthen the capacity of the \nNational  Audit  Authority  (NAA).  The  program  and  related  project  will  improve  the  overall \ngovernance  framework  and  support  government  efforts  to meet  PFM  benchmarks  essential  to \nallocating  resources  efficiently  and  managing  expenditures  effectively,  transparently,  and \naccountably.   \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nHigh rural poverty. In Cambodia, 85% of the population lives in rural areas, where the \nmain source of livelihood and income is agriculture. About 73.5% of agricultural workers in rural \nareas  are  women.  The  recent  robust  economic  growth  reduced  the  overall  poverty  rate  from \n47.0% in 1997 to 27.5% in 2008. However, the incidence of rural poverty is 35% compared with \n22%  in  urban  areas.  Rural  poor  have  limited  access  to  basic  goods  and  services.  Only  about \n16% of rural households have effective irrigation systems and only about 25% have access to \nimproved water sources.  \n \n4. \nAgriculture is essential to rural development. Employing 70% of the rural population \nand accounting for about one-third of gross domestic product (GDP), agriculture is an important \nsource  of  jobs,  enterprise  formation,  and  poverty  reduction.  However,  the  sector  remains \nvulnerable  to  external  shocks  and  unfavorable  weather  conditions.  The  potential  of  the \nagriculture sector needs to be developed, and investment in sector infrastructure is required to \nimprove  productivity  and  reduce  the  vulnerability  of  rural  populations  to  the  effects  of  climate \nchange.  Cambodia\u2019s  agriculture  is  characterized  by  lower  inputs  in  terms  of  fertilizers, \nmachinery, irrigation, and extension services than its neighboring countries. This reflects the low \nlevel of private and public investment as well as external financing. Despite significant increases \nsince 1993,1 Cambodia\u2019s rice yield remains the lowest in the region. While agriculture accounts \nfor  59%  of  all  employment,  agro-industry  provides  less  than  1%  of  total  employment  and \naccounts  for  only  1.9%  of  GDP.  Cambodia\u2019s  share  of  agriculture  value  added  in  GDP  has \ndeclined since 1993 because of the expansion of the industry and service sectors. The global \neconomic  crisis  is  exacerbating  the  vulnerability  of  Cambodia's  narrow  economic  base,  which \nrelies  heavily  on  the  garment  industry,  tourism  services,  and  construction.2 Climate  change  is \nhaving  a  significant  impact  on  agriculture  and  natural  resources. 3  Improvements  in  water \nproductivity will likely be vital for Cambodia, because rainfall will be more variable and its spatial \ndistribution will be changed. Better water harvesting, storage, and management will be needed. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  The yield was 2.75 tons per hectare in 2008. \n2  These account for 42% of non-agriculture GDP. \n3  R.

International Food Policy Research Institute. \nWashington D. C. (May). \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nRural  development  is  a  government  priority. Growth in rural areas is a key thrust of \n5. \nthe government's development strategy. Much more investment in the sector will be needed to \nraise  agriculture  productivity,  but  line  ministries  are  underfunded  and  institutionally  weak.  The \ngovernment's  sector-related  strategies  and  programs  target  implementing  the  Rectangular \nStrategy  to  promote  rural  development  and  help  achieve  the  Millennium  Development  Goals.4 \nThe  three  line  ministries  that  support  rural  development  in  Cambodia\u2014the  Ministry  of  Rural \nDevelopment  (MRD);  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Forestry  and  Fisheries  (MAFF);  and  the \nMinistry of Water Resources and Meteorology (MOWRAM)\u2014are among the most underfunded. \nThis hinders the delivery of services to the poor. At about 11.5% of GDP, government revenue \nis lower than in other developing countries in Asia (16.0% of GDP). Accurately estimating what \nportion  of  public  resources  goes  to  rural  development  or  the  rural  population  is  very  difficult. \nHowever, about 3.3% of recurrent budget allocations are provided to the three ministries (known \nas the rural development ministries), an increase from 0.5% in the mid-1990s. While the level of \nexpenditure has increased from the 1990s, the resources allocated to this sector continue to be \ninsufficient.  Spending  on  agriculture  by  development  partners  has  also  been  low,  generally \nabout $30 million\u2013$40 million of a total of $500 million\u2013600 million (or 5%\u20137%).  \n \n6. \nUnderfunded  budgets  exacerbate  public  expenditure  inefficiencies.  The  three \nprogram  ministries  use  an  incremental  approach  to  planning  and  budgeting  that  limits  their \nexpenditures to new and predominantly investment projects financed by development partners. \nThey  suffer  from  weak  coordination  mechanisms  within  and  across  ministries,  and  tend  to \noperate within \u201cpolicy silos\". Despite recent initiatives, such as the joint strategic plan for water \nand  agriculture,  policies  overlap  in  many  areas.  Furthermore,  the  2003  and  the  ongoing  2010 \nintegrated  fiduciary  assessment  and  public  expenditure  review,  and  the  2007  governance  risk \nassessments of the MRD and the MOWRAM, stressed the need for substantial improvements in \nthe institutions, processes, and capabilities relating to PFM.  \n \n7. \nPublic  financial  management  and  rural  development.  Reducing  poverty  requires \nappropriate policies and institutions, including the identification of poverty-reducing spending in \nthe  budget.  At  the  same  time,  links  with  PFM\u2014as  a  major  crosscutting  agenda\u2014need  to  be \nstrengthened.  Sustaining  rapid  economic  growth  over  the  long  term  will  require  economic \ndiversification  and  closer  links  between  the  agriculture  and  service  sectors.  These  include  (i) \nreforms in agriculture; (ii) increases in public capital spending; and (iii) PFM reforms. Therefore, \nthe  institutional  framework  supporting  rural  development  requires  sustained  support  in  PFM \nmechanisms.  In  an  effort  to  establish  an  effective  and  efficient  PFM  system,  the  government \ninstituted  the  multistage  Public  Financial  Management  Reform  Program  (PFMRP).  The  initial \nactivities  targeted  strengthening  budget  credibility,  including  budget  comprehensiveness,  and \naggregate  realism,  the  budget  cycle,  cash  management  and  predictability  of  cash  releases \n(platform  1).  Later  platforms  are  intended  to  address  financial  accountability,  policy  based \nbudgeting  and  accountability  for  performance.5 With  a  10-year  planning  and  implementation \nhorizon, the PFMRP is  being supported through a sector-wide approach with financing from a \nnumber  of  development  partners,  primarily  through  a  multi-donor  trust  fund.  In  the  three \nprogram ministries, it will be important to build commensurate capacity by prioritizing the rollout \nof the training program and other measures designed under the PFMRP.  \n\n                                                 \n4  Government of Cambodia, 2008.

ADB's  support  for  the \n8. \nPFMRP in rural development is consistent with the priorities of the country strategy and program \nfor Cambodia and ADB's Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan, which has PFM \nand  procurement  as  central  themes  for  improving  governance. 6  In  addition,  to  maximize \nharmonization  and  government  ownership,  and  to  minimize  transaction  costs,  ADB  and  other \ndevelopment  partners  are  using  a  sector-wide  approach  to  support  PFM.  This  approach  is \ninformed  by  key  lessons  from  implementing  complex  PFM  reforms  in  a  capacity-constrained \nenvironment  that  requires  the  gradual  introduction  of  PFM  changes.  Progress  will  require  long \ntime frames for external assistance given the weak starting points.  \n \n9. \nSynergy  and  close  coordination  are  required  between  crosscutting  public  sector \nmanagement  reform  initiatives,  such  as  the  PFMRP  (financial  management),  decentralization \nand  deconcentration  reforms  (restructuring  of  sub-national  administrations),  and  public \nadministrative  reforms  (personnel  management).  Public  administration  reforms,  including \nattractive  pay  and  other  incentives  for  civil  servants,  have  a  strong  link  with  PFM  that  entails \nprobity and higher-level commitments. These reforms could help Cambodia provide significantly \nbetter,  more  cost-effective  and  more  citizen-responsive  public  services  and  programs.  The \nPFMRDP \nfuture \ndecentralization and deconcentration programs in Cambodia.7 \n \nB. \n\nis  adopting  a  phased  approach,  and  provides \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nthe  groundwork \n\nfor \n\n10. \nThe  impact  of  subprogram  2  will  be  to  strengthened  prioritization  of  resource  use  and \nimproved  governance.  The  outcome  of  subprogram  2  will  be  improved  PFM  subsystems  in \nthree rural development ministries, which will be achieved through a set of program outputs.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nLink  between  subprograms  1  and  2.  The  PFMRDP,  approved  by  the  Board  as  a \n11. \nprogram  cluster  on  4  December  2008,  comprises  two  single-tranche  subprograms  for \nimplementation  from  June  2006  to  December  2010  within  a  well-defined,  medium-term \nframework. 8   Subprogram  1  comprised  (i)  a  grant  of  $6.71  million  and  (ii)  a  grant  of  $4.10 \nmillion to support institutional and capacity development. Subprogram 2 will continue the PFM \nreforms  initiated  under  subprogram  1,  and  has  11  key  reform  actions  to  achieve  three  broad \nobjectives over the  medium term that are intended to strengthen (i) the financial management \nframework  to  increase  accountability,  (ii)  financial  management  in  the  rural  priority  sectors  to \nimprove the delivery of services, and (iii) external audit as a pillar of accountability. Subprogram \n2  also  will  support  the  capacity  development  needs  of  the  program  ministries  in  the  areas  of \nPFM  subsystems,  and  assist  the  NAA  with  implementation  of  key  public  policy  audit  reforms \nunder subprogram 2. The updated matrix reflects the policy actions the government has already \naccomplished  (Appendix  4).  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  with  relevant  updates  is  in \nAppendix 1. The sector assessment (summary) is in Appendix 2. \n\n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2007. Country Strategy and Program: Cambodia, 2005\u20132009. Manila; and ADB. 2010.

Budget comprehensiveness has \nalso improved with the introduction of medium-term budget strategy plans for all line ministries. \nGood expenditure control measures are in place. These measures resulted in aggregate fiscal \ndiscipline that supported the government's fiscal management in 2008 and 2009 in response to \nthe global financial crisis.  \n \n14. \nStage  2  includes  a  full  rollout  of  the  PFMRP  to  all  line  ministries  and  institutions.  The \nMinistry  of  Economy  and  Finance  (MEF)  has  strengthened  efforts  to  finalize  the  ministerial \naction plans to ensure that all line ministries have a clear perspective of targeted outputs. The \nMEF recently established the PFM coordination working group for MRD, MAFF, and MOWRAM. \nThis group provides a platform for continuing dialogue on sector issues, including efficient public \nexpenditure  management.  Following  the  PFMRP  annual  retreat  in  January  2010,  the  MEF \nidentified  key \nto  accelerate \nimplementation of stage 2 of the PFMRP. \n \nSeveral positive developments have strengthened budget execution and reporting.  The \n15. \nDepartment  of  Public  Procurement  supported  the  line  ministries  in  the  preparation  of \nprocurement plans and organized training courses for procurement staff in 2009. Stronger cash \nmanagement, the creation of the Treasury single account, and the use of the banking system for \ntransactions have improved budget execution. The proposed financial management information \nsystem will further strengthen reporting and transaction processing efficiency under the PFMRP.  \n \nChallenges  remain  in  finalizing  the  draft  procurement  law. 11  The  first  draft  of  the \n16. \nframework  for  the  sovereign  procurement  law  of  Cambodia  is  expected  to  be  reviewed  and \nfinalized  in  2010.  When  enacted  into  law,  it  will  merge  the  two  existing  procurement \nsystems\u2014one for state-budget financed procurement, the other for procurement financed by \ndevelopment  partners.  In  the  interim,  the  government  has  updated  the  Implementing  Rules \nand Regulations for Public Procurement, 1998 (IRRPP), which was issued as supplementary \nrules and regulations under the Sub-Decree on Public Procurement, 1995. \n\nfinalizing  a  set  of  activities \n\nimpediments,  and  proposed \n\n                                                 \n9 Government  of  Cambodia.  2007  and  2009.

Average  salaries  have  quadrupled  since  2004  to  almost  $90  per \nmonth in 2010. The Council for Administrative Reforms (CAR) has initiated consultations with a \nwide  range  of  stakeholders  to  finalize  the  National  Public  Administration  Reforms,  2009\u20132013 \nand  to  reform  the  whole  compensation  system  to  achieve  long\u2013term  sustainability  while \nmaintaining  fiscal  prudence.  Several  initiatives  are  being  adopted:  a  labor  market  survey,  an \noperational  review,  a  census  to  map  skills  and  expectations,  introduction  of  new  identification \ncards  to  foster  organizational  efficiency,  and  ensure  that  civil  servants  uphold  the  four  core \nvalues of motivation, loyalty, professionalism, and service orientation. In order to further improve \nthe  quality  of  service  delivery,  a  new  scheme  -Priority  Operating  Costs  (POCs)\u2013has  been \nintroduced to provide a standardized incentive payment for selected civil servants.12  \n \nThe  government  has  continued  to  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity  for  debt \n18. \nmanagement through training and capacity development. A draft public debt sub-decree, which \nwill include provisions for debt and risk management, government on-lending, and government \nguarantees, is under consideration. The government is also finalizing a public debt management \nstrategy, which will help ensure that its borrowing needs are met efficiently.   \n\n \n2. \n\nPillar  2:  Strengthening  Financial  Management  in  Rural  Priority  Sectors  to \nImprove Service Delivery to Rural Population \n\n \n19. \nThe  program  ministries  have  continued  to  demonstrate  strong  ownership  of  the \ngovernment-led PFMRP. The establishment of the PFM reforms working group in MRD, MAFF, \nand MOWRAM has improved the institutional framework. Ministerial action plans for the PFMRP \nhave  been  prepared  and  are  being  implemented.  The  government-wide  capacity  development \nundertaken by the Economic and Finance Institute has improved PFM  capacity through short- \nand  long-term  training,  including  that  provided  under  the  PFMRDP  in  the  rural  development \nministries. In 2009, the institute trained 64 staff from the three rural development ministries. This \nwas  complemented  by  a  comprehensive  PFM  training  plan  with  ADB  support  focusing  on \nbudget  planning,  accounting,  procurement,  and  internal  audit.  In  the  program  ministries,  the \nbudget  formulation  process  has  improved  with  the  adoption  of  strategic  budget  frameworks,  a \nkey tool for preparing their medium-term and annual expenditure plans. The draft 2010 budget \nis  the  first  to  include  allocations  to  the  program  ministries  for  domestically  funded  investment \nexpenditures.  In  previous  years,  these  ministries  had  received  the  bulk  of  the  domestically \nfunded investment after it appeared in the budget as a line item. The MAFF and MRD have also \nbeen involved as pilot ministries in the introduction of program budgets since 2007, which aim to \nimprove the relevance of public spending by aligning resources more closely with policy priority \nareas.  \n \n20. \nBudget  execution,  including  procurement  planning  and  practices,  has  continued  to \nimprove  and  are  within  \u00b15%  of  Budget  Law  allocations,  drawing  on  PEFA  best  practice.  The \nMRD,  MAFF,  and  MOWRAM  have  continued  to  report  to  the  MEF  regular  progress  under \ndeconcentrated  procurement  procedures.  Rural  development  ministries  have  improved  in  their \nuse  of  and  compliance  with  the  government's  standard  operating  procedure,  financial \nmanagement manual, and procurement manual for externally aided projects, as well as in their \n\n                                                 \n12 Priority operating costs (POCs) is an interim scheme defined as the costs of operating inputs necessary to achieve \nagreed outputs or results within the context of development programs, projects or activities. POCs payments are \nnot compensation or salary supplements.  \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nPillar 3: Strengthening External Audit as Pillar of Public Accountability  \n\nadherence  to  the  good  governance  framework.13 Compliance  is  monitored  through  the  annual \njoint country portfolio performance review by the MEF, ADB, and the World Bank. Internal audit \noversight  in  the  program  ministries  has  continued  to  make  progress. A  strategic audit  plan  for \n2010\u20132012 has been prepared, and an internal audit manual is being produced.  \n \n\n  \n3. \n \n21. \nThe NAA established in 2002 following the enactment of the Audit Law, 2000, continues \nto be strengthened. The number of audits performed by NAA has increased from 2 in 2002 to 58 \nin 2008 and 83 in 2009. However, the NAA needs to accelerate capacity development to be in a \nposition  to  extend  audit  coverage  to  2,700  auditable  entities  within  its  jurisdiction.  The  NAA \npublished its first public audit report in 2009. An international audit peer review of the NAA by \nthe  New  Zealand  Office  of  the  Auditor  General  addressed  the  institutional  constraints  and \nestablished a baseline for a road map for long-term capacity development.  \n \nD. \n\nProgram Costs and Financing \n\n22. \nThe  size  of the  program  is  based  on  considerations  of  a  number  of  factors  required  to \nsupport  implementation  of  reforms  supported  by  the  Program. This  was  determined  by  (i)  the \nrelative  importance  of  the  reform  program,  the  weight  of  the  sector  and  the  benefits  from  the \nreform program; (ii) the leverage necessary to counter  resistance from interest groups opposed \nto  transparency  enhancing  reforms    and  (iii)  the  policy  adjustment  costs  incurred  by  the \nGovernment  and  other  stakeholders  in  implementing  and  complying  with  the  reforms  and  (iv) \nthe  need  to  conform  with  the  overall  financing  requirement  from  the  Country  Partnership \nStrategy  period.    ADB  staff  estimate  that  the  long  run  benefits  of  the  reform  program  are \napproximately $180 million - or about 1.5 % of GDP - from savings in the national government \nbudget  from  increased  competition  and  transparency  in  procurement  systems,  savings  from \nimproved  budget  execution  and  internal  control  systems  and  better  public  debt  management, \nand from the second round effects of more efficient delivery of public goods and services.14 The \npolicy  adjustment  cost, arising  from  administrative,  enforcement,  and  compliance  costs,  to  the \ngovernment is estimated to be about $16 million in aggregate over the program implementation \nperiod. This includes (i) administrative cost to implement the PFMRP; (ii) investment cost to set \nup Integrated Financial management Information System; (iii) administrative cost to comply with \nthe  internal  audit  and  procurement  procedures;  and  (iv)  administrative  cost  to  implement  the \npeer-review recommendation of the NAA. To support the government reform initiatives outlined \nin  the  Program,  the  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  an  amount  not  exceeding  the \nequivalent of $10 million and a grant of $10 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help \nfinance subprogram 2. The loan will have a 24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years. \nThe annual interest rate will be 1% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. The program \nfinancing  will  be  subject  to  such  other  terms  and  conditions  substantially  in  accordance  with \nthose set forth in the draft grant and loan agreements. \n \nE. \n \n23. \n\nProgram  oversight  and  management.  Implementation  arrangements  established \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n                                                 \n13 All  ADB-financed  program  and  projects  for  Cambodia  include  a  good  governance  framework.  The  framework \nincludes  fiduciary  risk  mitigation  measures  that  the  government  needs  to  implement  related  to  (i)  procurement \n(identification of procurement hotspots where risks occur, and mitigation measures); (ii) fiduciary management; (iii) \ncomplaint and remedy mechanisms; (iv) code of ethical conduct; and (v) sanctions.  \n\n14  See  para  10-12  of  the  Subsector  Analysis:  The  Public  Financial  Management  Reform  Program  and  Rural \n\nDevelopment Ministries \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nunder  subprogram  1  will  continue.  As  the  executing  agency,  the  MEF  will  be  responsible  for \noverall  implementation  of  pillars  1  and  2  of  subprogram  2,  as  well  as  the  post-program \npartnership framework (PPPF), including program administration, disbursements, maintenance \nof all program records, and reporting to ADB. Key implementing agencies are the MRD, MAFF, \nMOWRAM, and CAR. The PFMRP steering committee, chaired by the MEF secretary of state \nand including the director general or secretary general in charge of finance from all ministries, \nwill  continue  as  the  program  steering  committee  responsible  for  coordinating  program \nimplementation. It will be supported by the Reform Committee Secretariat and the PFM reform \nworking  groups  at  all  program  ministries  for  subprogram  2  implementation.  The  NAA  is  the \nexecuting agency for pillar 3, and will also responsible for relevant action under the PPPF.  \n \n24. \nProcurement  and  disbursement  arrangements.  Implementation  of  Subprogram  2  is \nfrom  January  2009  to  31  December  2010.  The  program  loan  and  grant  will  be  released  in  a \nsingle  tranche  upon  completion  of  all  the  tranche  conditions,  and  following  loan  and  grant \neffectiveness. The closing date of the loan and grant will be 31 April 2011. The government will \nprimarily use the local currency counterpart funds generated by the grant and loan proceeds to \nmeet program expenditures and associated costs of reform. The proceeds of the program loan \nand  grant  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB's  Simplification  of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.15 Before withdrawing \nany  funds,  the  government  will  open  or  nominate  deposit  accounts  with  the  National  Bank  of \nCambodia  to  receive  the  loan  and  grant  proceeds.  The  accounts  will  be  managed,  operated, \nand  liquidated  in  accordance  with  terms  satisfactory  to  ADB.  Subprogram  2  will  provide  for \nretroactive financing for eligible expenditures incurred by the government up to 180 days before \ngrant effectiveness. ADB will retain the right to audit the use of the grant and loan proceeds, and \nto verify the accuracy of the government\u2019s certification for the withdrawal application.  \n \n25. \nPost-program  partnership  framework.  Given  the  strategic  reorientation  in  stage  2  of \nthe  PFMRP  and  the  long-term  nature  of  some  of  the  critical  reforms  such  as  decentralization \nand  deconcentration  and  public  administration  reforms,  the  government  agreed  to  establish  a \nPPPF for 2 years. This will allow continual policy dialogue and engagement during 2011\u20132012. \nIncorporated in the revised policy matrix (Appendix 4), the PPPF focuses on the government's \npriorities.  In  coordination  with  the  program  steering  committee,  ADB  will  carry  out  periodic \nreviews of the implementation progress of the PPPF and assess the impact of the PFMRDP.  \n\n \n\nIII. \n\nGRANT ASSISTANCE FOR CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT \n\n \nIn  response  to  the  government\u2019s  request  to  design  a  second  phase  of  the  existing \n26. \nproject,  a  separate  grant  project  for  capacity  development  has  been  formulated.  Given  the \nvarying  pace  and  unevenness  of  PFM  progress  in  the  program  ministries,  implementation  of \nPFM reforms under the PFMRP will require additional technical inputs and targeted on-the-job \nsupport.  The  knowledge  and  skills  will  ensure  that  the  policy  and  institutional  reforms  will  be \nsustained  beyond  the  PFMRDP  and  that  objectives  under  the  PFMRP  are  achieved.  The \nproposed capacity development project will have four outputs. The first will continue to support \nthe three rural development ministries in PFM subsystems, including internal audit, monitoring, \nand evaluation. The second will support the MEF (Department of Investment and Cooperation) \nin public debt management issues. The third output will support two activities of the CAR within \nthe  scope  of  NPAR  2009\u20132013.  The  fourth  output  will  support  the  NAA  in  strengthening  audit \ncapacity  in  selected  areas.    The  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $5.5  million.  ADB  will  finance  $5 \nmillion from its Special Funds Resources (Asian Development Fund), including applicable taxes, \n\n                                                 \n15  ADB. 1998.

The  program  will  produce  economic  gains  through  efficient \n28. \nresource use. It will have no fiscal impact since its main thrust is to build capacity in the three \nrural development ministries.  \n \nGovernance.  The  design  of  the  PFMRDP  is  anchored  in  the  governance  framework. \n29. \nThe  government  is  committed  to  key  governance  reforms  in  the  PFMRP,  and  good  progress \nhas  been  made.  The  enactment  of  the  Anticorruption  Law  in  March  2010  and  the \nimplementation of broader public administration reforms that incentivize civil service will improve \npublic  sector  governance  and  strengthen  the  accountability  framework.  ADB's  Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the MEF, CAR, NAA, \nMRD,  MAFF,  and  MOWRAM.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures \nare described in paragraph 80 of the PAM (footnote 18). \n \n30. \nPoverty and social impact.  The PFMRDP, a general intervention aimed at supporting \nsustainable  economic  growth,  is  expected  to  have  an  indirect  positive  effect  on  poverty \nreduction. The program will improve the delivery of services in rural areas where the poor are \nconcentrated, and where women comprise the majority of the workforce (73.5% of agricultural \nworkers).

Collectively, the government \nand the development partners agree that this is an interim \nscheme defined as the costs of operating inputs necessary to \nachieve agreed outputs or results within the context of \ndevelopment programs, projects or activities. As such payments \nto cover POC stop when planned outputs/results are met or \ncompleted. POC payments are not compensation or salary \nsupplements. This interim measures will link to the broader public \nadministration reforms, and facilitate the implementation of NPAR \nrelated reforms, including reforms relating to HRM, HRD and \ncompensation.  \n\n \n\n4. The draft public debt sub decree was completed in May 2010 \nwith provisions for debt and risk management, government on-\nlending, and government guarantees. The draft sub-decree was \ndiscussed by the MEF PFM Reform Commission1 on 23 June \n2010. The draft Public Debt Management Subdecree is \nbenchmarked to a standard of international best practices \n(specifically IMF/World Bank), not just minimum requirements. The \nMEF led capacity building workshops on the technical and key \nissues involved in legal framework. The MEF led extensive \nconsultations and revisions with the broad group of PDM \nstakeholders, including representatives from central bank, key \ndepartments, etc.  \n \n5. The Government formulated the draft debt management strategy \nin  May  2010,  and  revised  it  twice  based  on  initial  consultations \nthrough  June.  Broader  consultations  with  external  and  internal \nPDM  stakeholders  are  taking  place  in  July  and  early  August.  The \ndraft strategy is expected to be completed in mid August 2010. The \nPFM Reform Commission (see footnote 1) will review  and discuss \nthe Strategy in meeting in August or September 2010.  \n\n                                                 \n1 The MEF has its own PFM Reform Commission, chaired by the Minister attached to the Prime Minister, Secretary of State, and Chairman of the PFMSC and \ncomprises of secretary general, deputy secretaries general, directors general, and department directors of MEF to coordinate, implement and monitor the PFM \nreform program within the MEF. \n\n\f \n\nObjective \n\n2.

Submission of regular reports is an ongoing activity, and is being \nsupervised by the PFM working groups in each ministry, and the \nmonitoring responsibility is with the Department of Procurement, \nMEF. MAFF and MOWRAM have compiled with this requirement \nsince January 2009. There was initial delay of submission for MRD, \nbut it has been accomplished since May 2010.  \n \n7. ADB has adopted the Government\u2019s Standard Operating \nProcedures (SOPs) SOPs for externally financed projects, the \nassociated Procurement Manual, and the Financial Management \nManual in the administration of ADB financed programs/projects.  \n    \nMAFF, MRD, and MOWRAM have adopted SOP/PM/FMM for \ndonor projects. Specific issues related to the use of the Manuals, \nand the issues of enhancing or further enforcing the implementation \nof SOP/PM/FMM have been discussed in every Quarterly Portfolio \nPerformance Review/Meeting JCCPR for ADB/WB funded projects \nsince 2008. The Government\u2019s objective is to enforce the \nimplementation of SOP/PM/FMM to all externally financed \nprojects/programs in Cambodia. In 2009, training on the use of \nSOP/PM/FMM were provided for project staff of the Eastern Rural \nIrrigation Development Project (2 workshops) and Rural Water and \nSanitation Project (1 workshop). Training and workshops on \nSOP/PM/FMM will be conducted for the rural development \nministries with ADB project support in 2010. \n \nCapacity building in this area to be able to effectively undertake \neffective project implementation is high on ADB agenda. \nCommencing in June 2010, ADB projecta team will organize and \nconduct a series of procurement training sessions, primarily for \nprocurement officials from the three participating rural \ndevelopment ministries. One of the objectives of the on-going \nseries of training sessions will be to deepen the understanding of \nthe concerned officials to apply the SOP/PM/FMM in donor-\nfinanced projects, as well as to ensure compliance for all \nprojects. \n \n\n8. The Government has implemented GGFs for ADB-financed \nprojects. The workshops conducted by the ADB projecta under the \npolicy action will also include material on the GGF.

In  addition, \nimprovements made to the presentation of the 2009 and 2010 budget and more \ndetailed  information  disclosed  on  the  Domestic  Capital  Budget  MEF  did  not \nforesee  the  need  for  exclusive  implementing  instructions  and  focused  on \nspecific  strategy  and  direction  to  further  improve  the  comprehensiveness  and \nintegration of the budget within the scope of the PFSL. \nAll  the  three  RDMs  have  prepared  MAPs,  MAFF  reports  monthly  progress \nagainst MAP, and MRD and MOWRAM quarterly. \nKey  outputs  for  DPP  for  2010  include  plans  to  develop  a  strategy  for  post \nreview  and  a  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  procurement  by  line \nministries.  \nDPP conducted post audit on 16 Ministries and 22 provinces (Progress Report \n2009  on  PFMRP,  prepared  by  the  Secretariat  of  the  PFM  Reform  Steering \nCommittee, 16-17 January 2010). \nWork in progress to develop an electronic procurement Bulletin (e-PPB) and/or \nProcurement Website by end December 2010. \n\nBudget  execution  has  seen  Treasury  Single  Account  strengthening  with  a \nreduction of bank accounts from about 3000 in 2006 to only 6 accounts which \nare  maintained  at  provincial  level.  The  payment  through  banking  system  has \nexpanded  significantly.  26  Ministries  have  used  banking  system  for  salary \npayments  as  of  December  2009.  Customs  and  tax  revenue  collected  through \nthe  banking  system  has  been  more  than  90%  of  the  tax  revenue  collected  in \n2009. Budget holders have been increasingly able to commit expenditure in line \nwith  budgets  and  cash  flow  forecasts.  Pilot  projects  of  commercial  banking \nservice use have been implemented in selected provinces. Quarterly, bi-annual, \nand  annual  performance  report  formats  of  budget  execution  prepared  and \ncirculated to priority line ministries. \nIn  2008,  the  MEF  published  the  first  budget  summary,  setting  out  the  main \nspending  and  revenue  features  of  the  budget  and  the  budget  objectives.  This \nwas  a  major  step  towards  more  fiscal  transparency.  In-year  budget  execution \nreports  are  published  on  the  MEF  website.  Although  they  are  not  updated \nregularly,  their  frequency  is  increasing.  A  year-end  budget  settlement  report  is \nprepared  and  audited  by  the  NAA.

Budget  briefs  were  issued;  and  2006 \nAudit Report was published. \n\nStaff  focused  on  middle-office  (MO)  work  started  in  January  2010,  and  have \nundergone a variety of MO training and work, all on-going. \nThe  implementation  of  DMFAS  has  been  further  improved  through  having \nestablished  more  work  stations  and  upgraded  staff's  capacity.  DMFAS  has \nbeen  used  to  administer  data  of  grant  and  concessional  financing.  Staffs  in \ncharge were sent to attend local and overseas training and workshops on debt \nmanagement,  DMFAS  use  and  analysis  on  risk  management  (Philippines, \nMalaysia,  and  Switzerland).  Workshops  on  debt  management  strategy  and \nDMFAS's  functions  were  conducted  for  officials  of  the  DIC  and  other  relevant \ndepartments. \nPFM  Reform  Secretariat  is  seeking  to  engage  a  Data  Integration  Specialist  to \nsupport  DIC  to  implement  the  new  Chart  of  Account  (COA)  and  Budget \nClassification (BC) with respect to capital investment expenditures.  \n\nThe  Farmer  Water  User  Communities  (FWUC)  sub  decree  has  been  drafted \nand  is  now  with  Council  of  Ministers  for  approval.  Besides,  MOWRAM  have \nproduced  3  other  sub-decrees  which  have  been  submitted  to  the  Council  of \nMinisters  for  approval  and  onward  transmission  to  the  National  Assembly  (i) \nWater  Quality  Control,  (ii)  Water  License  and  (iii)  River  Basin  Management. \nFurthermore a final draft has been made of the Underground Water sub-decree. \n\nThis  is  work  in  progress.  2010  budget  includes  domestically  funded  public \ninvestment programs for the three rural development ministries. In each Ministry \nthere  is  a  sector  strategy.  The  ADB  projecta  team  has  trained  staff  in  all  3 \nministries  linking  sector  strategies  with  budgeting  mechanisms  in  February \n2010;  these  linkages  are  institutionalized  in  MAFF  and  MRD.  The  budget \npreparation  in  MAFF  and  MOWRAM  is  based  on  the  strategic  plan,  with  both \nthe  planning  and  finance  departments  having  formed  a  budget  formulation \ncommittee. MAFF and MRD are using program budgeting to some extent which \nis partially an attempt at costing the sector plan. This aspect will be replicated in \nMOWRAM who at present are still operating in the traditional method of putting \ntogether budgets. For the budget 2009 and 2010 there is a demonstrated shift \ntowards  strategic  allocations  of  budgets  and  MRD  has  experienced  25  % \nbudget increases due to strategic issues in each of the last 3 years.
