The \nGovernment's emergency program seeks to correct deep-rooted \neconomic imbalances and restore the economy to a sustainable \ngrowth  trajectory  over  the  medium  term.  To  achieve  these \nobjectives,  the  Program  will  support  specific  reform  initiatives, \nincluding (i) rationalizing, prioritizing, and aligning public spending \nwith available resources; (ii) broadening the tax base; (iii) reducing \neconomic subsidies; (iv) supporting privatization of state-owned \nenterprises (SOEs); (v) strengthening internal audit functions; and \n(vi) changing the role of the Government in the economy from a \nprovider of all services to an enabler of sustainable and equitable \ngrowth. \n   \nRationale  The tsunami of late 2004 brought to the fore some underlying \nstructural problems in the economy of the Maldives. These include \na narrow and concentrated economic base, an inelastic taxation \nsystem,  continued  subsidization  of  social  services,  a  rapidly \ngrowing  civil  service,  and  the  lack  of  a  clear  strategy  for  the \ndivestment and privatization of SOEs. In addition, human resource \ncapacity  constraints,  especially  at  mid  to  low  level,  including \ngovernment functionaries, have made effective implementation of \ndevelopment assistance projects difficult. \n \nThese  structural  constraints  have  weakened  macroeconomic \nfundamentals and made the economy more vulnerable to external \nshocks, including increases in prices of imported food and refined \noil products. They also have an impact on the main driver of the \neconomy\u2014tourism. The increasing reliance on public spending, \n ", "ii \ntogether with the Government's inability to reduce its role in the \neconomy, has led to a large fiscal deficit (13% of gross domestic \nproduct  [GDP]  in  2008).  To  finance  this  large  deficit,  the \nauthorities have had to resort to monetization of the deficit through \nthe  ways  and  means  advances.  This  has  led  to  additional \npressure  on  inflation,  increases  in  the  real  effective  exchange \nrate,  and  pressure  on  the  currency  peg.  This  process  of \nmonetization is also placing further strain on Maldives Monetary \nAuthority's (MMA's) balance sheet. Large current public spending \nhas  led  to  increasing  demand  for  imports\u2014by  virtue  of  the \nopenness  of  the  economy\u2014and  rapid  growth  of  the  current \naccount deficit (52% of GDP in 2008), a rapid increase in public \ndebt (54% of GDP) and increasing pressure on the international \nreserves position.  \n \nThe Government recognizes the magnitude of the economic crisis \nand has begun reforms to arrest its deteriorating fiscal position. At \nthe same time, it has agreed to take further economic reform \nmeasures under this Asian Development Bank (ADB) Program \nand under the IMF Stand-By Arrangement \n \nThe  Government,  which  inherited  a  legacy  of  unaddressed \nstructural  issues,  realizes  the  costs  of  delaying  corrective \nmeasures. It has seen its net foreign exchange reserves drop to \n$53 million at the end of August 2009, a significant increase in the \nfiscal  deficit,  and  a  contraction  of  economic  growth.  Tourism, \nfisheries, and construction\u2014the three main drivers of economic \ngrowth\u2014have been adversely affected by the global economic \nslowdown and weaknesses in domestic economic management. \nAccordingly, the country is now in recession, with GDP expected \nto contract by nearly 4% in 2009. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  proposed  Program  will  support  recovery  and  sustainable \ngrowth of the economy over the medium term by removing the \ndistortions that have led to the large economic imbalances. By \nsupporting long overdue structural reforms, the Program will move \ntoward  a  more  broad-based  and  sustainable  development \nframework  that  reduces  the  country's  vulnerability  to  external \nshocks and prepares it for scheduled graduation by the United \nNations to middle-income country status on 1 January 2011.  \n \nThe key end-of-program outcomes of the Program will be the \ncreation  of  greater  fiscal  space  in  the  Government  budget  by \ndiversifying the tax base and rationalizing expenditures, improving \ndebt management, and enhancing the privatization of SOEs. The \nissuance of Treasury bills and bonds will deepen the financial \nmarket (given that the Government and the MMA have reached \nan agreement that the deficit will no longer be monetized, but will \nbe financed by open-market operations of the MMA). \n \nSpecific  outcomes  of  the  Program  include  (i)  improved  fiscal ", "iii \ndiscipline and predictability; (ii) enhanced value of the budget as a \npolicy tool; (iii) synchronization of the budget preparation process \nwith  available  resources;  (iv)  diversification  of  the  tax  base; \n(v) expenditure  rationalization;  (vi)  better  monitoring  and \nmanagement of internal and external debt; (vii) a sounder footing \nfor Government finance, avoiding inflationary domestic finance; \n(viii) deeper financial markets through the issuance of Treasury \nbills and bonds, and provision of a market-based instrument for \nliquidity management to MMA; (ix) better project management and \ndevelopment effectiveness; (x) a transparent privatization process \nfor SOEs; and (xi) a stronger internal audit mechanism.   \n   \nFinancing Plan  ADB  will  provide  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR21,912,000  ($35  million  equivalent)  from  ADB's  Special \nFunds resources. The loan will have a term of 24 years, including \na grace period of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter.  \n \nADB  will  also  provide  a  technical  assistance  (TA)  package  of \n$4.5 million in support of the Program. This will consist of (i) TA \ngrant  of  $3.0  million  in  support  of  various  institutional \nstrengthening initiatives, from ADB's Technical Assistance Special \nFund  (TASF-IV),  and  (ii)  a  TA  loan  in  various  currencies \nequivalent to SDR939,000 ($1.5 million equivalent), for supporting \ncapacity  development  and  privatization  initiatives,  from  ADB's \nSpecial  Funds  resources,  which  will  have  a  term  of  32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, and an interest charge of \n1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter.  \n   \nProgram Period and  The Program will be completed by December 2012. The loan will \nTranching  be  released  in  two  tranches\u2014SDR11,269,028  ($18  million \nequivalent)  upon  effectiveness  of  the  loan  and  fulfillment  of \nagreed conditions for the first tranche, and SDR10,642,972 ($17 \nmillion equivalent), which is expected to be disbursed 18 months \nafter  loan  effectiveness  upon  satisfactory  fulfillment  of  agreed \nconditions for the second tranche (or earlier than 18 months if the \nconditions have been met). ADB will monitor the progress of the \nProgram at regular intervals.  \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT)  \n   \nImplementation  A steering committee will be responsible for overall coordination, \nArrangements  implementation,  monitoring,  and  policy  approvals.  It  will  be \nchaired  by  the  state  minister  of  MOFT  and  will  include \nrepresentatives  from  the  President's  Office,  Privatization \nCommittee, MMA, and senior officials from MOFT (including the \nheads  of  Public  Enterprise  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Board, \nInternal Audit Unit, Budget Division, Debt Division, Department of \nInland Revenue, and Department of National Planning). ADB will \nparticipate in the committee as an observer.  \n ", "iv \n   \nProcurement and  Consultants to be financed from the TA loan and grant will be \nDisbursement  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Consultancy \ncontract  packages  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nmethod and consultants qualification selection will be utilized for \nselection of consultants, based on technical proposals, for specific \nsubcomponents. Procurement of any goods or services shall be \ncarried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time).  \n   \nProgram Benefits  The Program is expected to result in higher tax collection and \nbetter expenditure management systems that, combined with the \ndivestment and privatization of SOEs, should lead to a reduction \nin  economic  imbalances,  including  fiscal  and  current  account \ndeficits, and improvements in macroeconomic management. The \nProgram is also expected to lead to better resource management \nfrom  domestic  and  external  sources.  In  particular,  over  the \nmedium term, it is expected that the apex project management \nunit  (PMU)  at  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Treasury  and  two \nthematic project management units (TPMUs) at the Ministry of \nHousing, Transport and Environment, and Ministry of Economic \nDevelopment, respectively, will improve the project performance \nratios,  including  portfolio  performance  indicators,  thereby \nimproving aid effectiveness.  \n \nStrengthening  the  macroeconomic  profile,  improving  alignment \nbetween  development  spending  and  sector  priorities  and \nprograms, introducing new taxes, rationalizing expenditures, and \nprogressing  toward  divestment  and  privatization  of  SOEs  will \nexpand  the  economic  base  and  support  more  broad-based \neconomic growth. The Program will equip government agencies \nwith modern analytical tools to manage the development process, \nfacilitate  an  inflow  of  foreign  direct  investment,  and  smooth \nMaldives' transition to middle-income country status.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  There  are  many  risks  to  the  effective  implementation  of  the \nProgram.  On  the  political  front,  there  have  been  difficulties  in \nobtaining  agreement  on  policy  reforms,  particularly  on  fiscal \nmanagement and, specifically, expenditure cutbacks. These risks \nare mitigated to a significant degree by the strong upfront actions. \nIn contrast to previous reform efforts, the Government has strong \nownership of the Program and the reform agenda at all levels. The \nPresident himself has been a leading champion of the reform \nprocess.  The  Government  has  been  candid  about  the \ncomprehensive  nature  of  the  economic  reforms  it  needs  to \nundertake. This will serve to mitigate the political risks and also \nexpedite legislative approval.  \n \n \n ", "v \n \nRisks to privatization will be mitigated by the provision of a TA to \nthe Government. A Government and IMF program will set forth the \nmacroeconomic and fiscal framework and support complementary \npolicy measures over the medium term.  \n   \nTechnical Assistance  A TA package of $4.5 million will be provided under the Program. \nThis will comprise (i) TA grant of $3.0 million in support of various \ninstitutional  strengthening  initiatives,  and  (ii)  a  TA  loan  of \n$1.5 million in support of capacity development initiatives and the \neventually  income-generating  privatization  initiatives.  The  TA \ngrant  will  be  primarily  used  for  (i)  strengthening  the  MOFT \ncapacity in budget, expenditure, tax, cash management, internal \naudit, and (ii) supporting apex PMU, and the TPMUs in two key \nministries and related capacity development. The TA loan will (i) \nenhance training and capacity building for government officials \nand related stakeholders; and  (ii) enhance capacity to support \nprivatization policies and procedures, the privatization process for \ntargeted  SOEs,  and  develop  the  capacity  of  the  Privatization \nCommittee,  Invest  Maldives,  and  develop  a  public\u2013private \npartnership framework. \n \n \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogram loan for the Economic Recovery Program (the Program); (ii) a proposed technical \nassistance (TA)  loan for Capacity Development for Economic Recovery Project (the Project), \nboth  to  Republic  of  the  Maldives.  The  report  also  describes  proposed  TA  for  Institutional \nStrengthening for Economic Management. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1. \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n2.  Socioeconomic  development.  Generally,  sound  macroeconomic  management \ncombined with favorable external conditions and strong donor support have led to average \nannual  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  of  6.6%  during  1994\u20132004  in  the  Maldives. \nTourism has been the engine of growth and it has driven economic expansion in other sectors, \nincluding construction, transport and communications, and wholesale and retail trade. Strong \nand sustained economic growth has led to a rapid increase in income per capita. The Maldives \nhas gone from being one of the poorest countries in South Asia in the 1970s\u2014with a per capita \nincome of less than $100\u2014to the country with highest per capita income in the region (per \ncapita income of almost $3,000 by the end of 2008). The Maldives will be graduated by the \nUnited Nations to a middle-income country on 1 January 2011. Social indicators have also \nimproved. Primary education is nearly universal. Illiteracy declined from about 18% in the 1970s \nto about 1% in 2001. Infant mortality decreased from more than 100 per thousand in the 1970s \nto 14 per thousand in 2003. Average life expectancy rose from 47 years in 1977 to 71 years in \n2002. While income inequality remains an issue, partly reflecting the characteristics of a small \npopulation scattered across vast distances, this is expected to decline slowly as distant atolls \nare integrated with the formal economy in Mal\u00e9 and its surroundings.   \n \n3.  Small,  open  economy.  The  Maldives  is  a  small,  open  economy  and  is  therefore \nvulnerable to potential shocks, including changes in tourism flows, fluctuations in the prices of \nkey commodities such as food and fuel (both of which are mainly imported), and capital inflows. \nThe country\u2019s revenues and foreign exchange reserves are directly or indirectly tied to the \nperformance of tourism and any changes to tourism arrivals\u2014as in the aftermath of the tsunami \nand after the start of the global economic crisis\u2014can undermine macroeconomic stability. The \neconomy needs to be properly managed so these vulnerabilities can be addressed. In view of \nthe limited role of monetary policy\u2014reflecting a dollarized economy with a fixed exchange rate \nto the dollar and a money market in its infancy\u2014fiscal policy has the potential to play a greater \nrole in driving demand management and economic stabilization measures. \n \n4.  Rising budget imbalance. The December 2004 tsunami wreaked havoc on the lives of \npeople in the Maldives and created a disaster of national proportions. There was widespread \ninfrastructure damage, including shelter, in most of the inhabited atolls, but the capital, Mal\u00e9\u2014\nhome to about half of the country\u2019s population\u2014escaped relatively unscathed. Total damage \nwas estimated at about $470 million, close to 60% of GDP. With generous external assistance, \nalmost all of the tsunami-related damage has been repaired to a higher design standard. \nBeginning with the 2005 and 2006 budgets, the incumbent Government started increasing \nrecurrent expenditures with an eye toward the next elections. These mainly consisted of (i) a \nlarge increase in the size of the civil service, (ii) an increase in public sector wages, and \n(iii) maintenance of power and water subsidies, especially in the politically important capital, \nwhere  power  tariffs  have  remained  unchanged  since  2002.  Cumulatively,  these  recurrent \nexpenditures meant that fiscal expenditure reached 62% of GDP by the end of 2008 (compared \n ", "2 \nwith 36% in 2004). At the same time, unrealistic revenue projections, reflected in successive \nbudget proposals, failed to materialize and, as a result, the fiscal deficit increased from 1.6% of \nGDP in 2004 to 12.6% by the end of 2008. Total public debt increased from 43% of GDP in \n2004  to  54%  by  the  end  of  2008.  Domestic  borrowing  to  finance  the  deficit  drove  debt \naccumulation. External debt to GDP rose from 42.7% in 2004 to 76.9% in 2008. \n \n5.  Deteriorating balance of payments. Given the Maldives' high import dependency, its \nexpansionary fiscal policy has resulted in a deterioration of the balance of payments current \naccount. The deficit increased partly because of an increase in imports to pay for tsunami \nreconstruction but mostly because of (i) strong domestic demand led by new resort construction, \n(ii) large government expenditures, and (iii) soaring food and oil prices from 2007.  \n \n6.  Reliance on external capital inflows. Capital inflows have financed the large balance \nof payments current account deficit. The main items have been the external investment inflow \nfor resort development, greater lending by Mal\u00e9-based branches of two foreign commercial \nbanks (by obtaining funds from their overseas headquarters), and domestic borrowing by the \nGovernment to finance rising expenditures. As the foreign bank liabilities are in the form of \nshort-term borrowing, the short-term external debt had increased to $498 million (40% of GDP) \nby the end of 2008. \n \n7.  Impact of the global crisis. Since the onset of the global economic crisis in September \n2008, foreign banks in Mal\u00e9 have sharply curtailed their lending, which has led to a shortage of \ndollars in the domestic market. Withdrawals from dollar-denominated accounts are paid out in \neither rufiyaa or in a combination of dollars and rufiyaa. The recession in the developed world \nhas also affected tourism. Bed-nights dropped by almost 9% year-on-year during January\u2013\nSeptember 2009. The international liquidity crunch will make it harder for the Maldives to roll \nover its short-term borrowing. This represents a risk for the Maldives\u2019 balance of payments and \nthe currency peg with the US dollar. The Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA) has continued to \nintervene in the foreign exchange market to maintain the peg, which has led to a steady decline \nin  reserves.  Although  a  credit  line  of  $100  million  from  India,  including  \n$50 million of budgetary support, was agreed to in early 2009, it provided only temporary relief \nfrom the pressure on international reserves. Due to the nascent nature of the financial system in \nthe Maldives, the volume of financial inflows on capital account or portfolio investment has been \nlow. Gross international reserves have shown a steady depletion and, on a net basis, were \nsome $53 million at the end of August 2009.   \n  \n8.  Political change. The Maldives now has a new constitution, and a new President who \nwas elected through universal adult suffrage in a free and fair election in October 2008, bringing \nto an end the 30-year-long rule of the previous administration. The new Government is strongly \ncommitted to political and economic reforms and its election manifesto included reducing the \nsize of the Government to a lean and efficient administrative machinery, reducing the state\u2019s \nrole in economic activity by privatizing state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and improving public \ngovernance.  \n \n9.  Inherited  economic  legacy. By the time the new administration assumed office in \nNovember 2008, the economy had deteriorated significantly; from an estimated GDP growth of \n5.8% in 2008, the most recent official projection for 2009 is \u20133.9%. The economy continues to \nbe adversely affected by progressively higher budget and balance of payment deficits, which \nhas  forced  the  authorities  to  resort  to  monetize  the  deficit  through  the  ways  and  means \nadvances (W&MA), i.e., an overdraft facility with the central bank. However, in May 2009, the \nGovernment  obtained  parliamentary  approval  for  a  revised  2009  budget.  The  overriding ", "3 \nobjective is to adjust the budget so it is in line with the policies of new government sworn in \nNovember 2008, and to align expenditure\u201471% of GDP in the original budget\u2014with available \nresources. Under the revised budget, total expenditures are projected to decrease to 67% of \nGDP, and the budget deficit was projected to decline significantly, largely because of the \nproposed privatization of Mal\u00e9 International Airport (MIA).  \n \n10.  The way forward. As noted in the Government's development policy letter (Appendix 4), \nthe neglect of long-standing structural issues by the previous administration and the impact of \nthe expansionary fiscal policy over the past 3 years have resulted in a marked deterioration in \nthe economy. In order to restore macroeconomic stability and return the Maldives to its high-\ngrowth trajectory, the Government has decided to implement a far-reaching economic reform \nprogram. For this purpose, it has sought assistance from Asian Development Bank (ADB) and \nother development partners, including International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank (see \nPara 57).  \n  \nIII.  THE SECTOR  \nA.  Sector Description and Analysis  \n1.  The Challenge \n11.  Since  the  tsunami  in  late  2004,  the  Maldives\u2019  economic  performance  has  rapidly \ndeteriorated.  While  the  tsunami-related  damage  is  being  restored,  the  deterioration  in \nmacroeconomic indicators continues. This reflects the then Government's failure to undertake \nmuch-needed reforms to address longstanding structural issues, including a rapidly expanding \ncivil service and public sector wage increases, unsustainable subsidies on economic services \n(including that of power in Mal\u00e9, the country's most affluent region), and a system of revenue \ngeneration that relies on advance payments of public assets, such as advance lease payments \nfor  tourism  resorts,  and  for  financing  recurrent  expenditures  at  the  detriment  of  future \ngenerations. The Maldives' expenditure to GDP ratio is one of the highest in the region and one \nof the highest of island economies.  \n \n12.  The economic base remains narrow and relies disproportionately on the performance of \ntourism, and to a lesser degree on that of fisheries and construction. There are 39 SOEs, of \nwhich  a  minority  transfer  any  meaningful  dividend  income  to  the  treasury.  The  remainder \nrepresents  a  net  drain  on  the  budget.  As  the  Maldives  is  an  open  economy  and  highly \ndependent  on  imports,  these  structural  constraints  have  weakened  macroeconomic \nfundamentals and rendered the economy much more vulnerable to external shocks, including a \nrise  in  international  food  and  fuel  prices  as  well  as  the  impact  from  the  global  economic \ndownturn. The increasing reliance on large public spending has led to a large fiscal deficit, \nwhich  is  at  the  source  of  the  economic  ills  facing  the  country  and  has  resulted  in  rapid \naccumulation of public debt. The share of current expenditure to total expenditure increased \nfrom 70% to 80%. The authorities have had to monetize the deficit through W&MA. This has \nfueled  inflation,  increased  the  real  effective  exchange  rate,  and  exerted  pressure  on  the \ncurrency peg. Debt monetization is also placing increasing pressure on MMA's balance sheet. \nLarge public spending has increased demand for imports\u2014by virtue of the openness of the \neconomy\u2014and resulted in rapid growth of the current account deficit.

The Government is aware of these increasing fiscal constraints and associated external \nimbalances, and has started reforms to address them. However, it does not have the resources \nto implement many of these measures and has approached its development partners to support \nits economic reform program. \n \n14.  The  Government  has  initiated  measures  to  (i)  curtail  expenditures; (ii)  broaden  the \nrevenue base, (iii) streamline Government functions; (iv) address the issue of SOE circular debt; \n(v) reduce its borrowings from the Central Bank to finance the budget deficit, and (vi) strengthen \nthe institutional framework for privatization and national planning. It has also announced its \nintention of rationalizing the civil service by reducing it by a third, increasing power tariffs in \nMal\u00e9, and also instituting a power tariff formula linking power tariffs to cost of inputs including \ninternational petroleum prices. Details of these measures are in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities  \n1.  Issues \na.  Revised 2009 Budget and the Medium-Term Fiscal Framework \nRemain Ambitious \n15.  Budget deficit. Although the revised 2009 budget aims to compress the fiscal deficit to \n7.4% of GDP, revenues are uncertain\u2014most are projected to come from the privatization of \nMIA,  which  is  not  likely  in  2009,  and  from  the  introduction  of  an  increase  in  the  airport \npassenger service charge (airport tax), business profits tax, and tourism goods and services tax. \nAs of the end of June 2009, the budget deficit was 16% of GDP, and, with the measures \ndescribed in the Program, the year-end budget deficit is projected to be 28%,1 and to decline to \n14% by the end of 2010.  \n \n16.  The credibility and predictability of the budget formulation and implementation process \nneeds to be significantly enhanced. \"Expenditure brakes\" need to be introduced if revenue and \nexpenditure deviate from the projected adjustment path. Given the increasing uncertainty over \nrevenues\u2014aggravated by volatility in the global economy\u2014monthly statements of expenditure \nand receipts and significant deviations (outside seasonal factors) should be closely monitored \nand expenditure brakes quickly triggered across the board.  \n \nb.  Lack of Capacity Could Hinder Revenue and Expenditure Measures  \n17.  Revenue generation. The medium-term tax and expenditure containment measures \nunderpinning the revised 2009 budget may not achieve the fiscal targets within the stipulated \ntimeframe. For proposed revenues to reach their target, significant preparatory work needs to \nbe undertaken and capacities developed to introduce two major taxation initiatives (a business \nprofits tax and a tourism goods and services tax) within a relatively short period. On the \nspending side, fiscal policy remains expansionary, and there needs to be a clear articulation of a \nmechanism to synchronize power tariffs with input costs and reduce the wage bill for the public \nsector. Smaller capital inflows to finance new resort construction and declining tourist arrivals \nbecause of the global economic crisis would affect projected government revenue in 2009. To \n                                                 \n1  Without the Program, the 2009 year-end budget deficit is projected to be 33% of GDP. ", "5 \nstrengthen the Government\u2019s revenue base, the introduction of broad-based taxes is essential. \nHowever, if these are to be successful, the associated capacities need to be developed.  \n \n18.  Expenditure management. Expenditures have risen rapidly in recent years. The growth \nhas been in recurrent expenditures, mostly because of increases in the civil service wage bill, \nand continued subsidization of economic services, including power tariffs in Mal\u00e9.  \n \n19.  Debt management. Debt management is an integral part of sound fiscal management. \nAlthough an External Resource Management Division was set up in the Ministry of Finance and \nTreasury (MOFT) to act as the focal point for debt management, the Government currently does \nnot have an overall strategy to reduce debt to prudent levels over the short to medium term.  \n \n20.  Circular debt. The State Electric Company Limited (STELCO) owes the State Trading \nOrganization (STO) accumulated debt of Rf400 million (some $31 million) as of August 2009 \n(the circular debt). Currently, MOFT is accruing liabilities on behalf of STELCO, and this liability \nis planned to be transferred to MOFT in 2009. As the Government plans the privatization of \nSOEs, MOFT will need to recognize their liabilities and account for them as a part of the \nGovernment's contingent liability.  \n \nc.  Need to Improve Deficit-Financing Mechanisms by Treasury Bills \n \n21.  MOFT does not have a framework for analyzing monthly Treasury cash flow to support \nMMA's liquidity forecasting. As MMA purchases of Treasury bills on its own account have been \ndiscontinued (to decrease the cost of Treasury bill financing) a system of Treasury bill auctions, \nincluding  primary  dealers  and  brokers  to  support  trading  in  the  secondary  market  is \ncontemplated.  \n \nd.  Internal Audit Function Faces Capacity Constraints \n22.  Although  the  Public  Finance  Act  2007  and  its  regulations  have  been  enacted,  the \nregulations do not cover accounting standards. Consolidated financial statements are currently \nnot prepared and are therefore not audited.2 A task force has been set up to analyse the \nInternational Public Sector Accounting Standards to see how draft financial regulations can be \nmade consistent with international standards.  The intention is to begin by implementing cash \naccounting  standards  (which  is  historically  how  governments  have  accounted)  and  then \nprogressively implement accrual accounting standards.3 However, the internal audit team is \nunderstaffed and will need training in and exposure to technology and project management. \nNone of the current staff is capable of assuming the role of an information technology auditor.  \n \ne.  Privatization Lacks Clear Policy and Procedure \n23.  The Maldives lacks a formal privatization policy. A clear policy is critical\u2014particularly in \nthe absence of a privatization act\u2014to explain the Government's objectives and to establish clear \nprinciples for the privatization process, including checks and balances. The policy is particularly \nneeded in view of the difficulties that have been encountered in the privatization of MIA (the first \nflagship privatization attempt by the new Government). \n \n                                                 \n2  IMF. 2009. Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment for the Maldives. Washington, DC. \n3  The accrual method of accounting is the internationally agreed best practice and the method most governments \nare progressively implementing. \n ", "6 \n24.  For efficient and effective privatization, the Government needs to issue regulations to \nimplement  the  comprehensive  SOE  privatization  reform  initiative.  Areas  that  need  to  be \naddressed include (i) the basis for determining which SOEs identified for reforms should be \nretained, restructured, privatized, or closed; (ii) guidelines for financial restructuring detailing the \nprocedure for implementing the financial restructuring plan; and (iii) a redundancy program, \ncovering eligibility criteria and severance compensation.  \n \nf.  Deficiencies in Utilizing External Assistance \n25.  Capacity constraints affect all stages of the economic management process, including \ntimely utilization of external assistance. As a result, all development partners are experiencing \nsignificant delays in the completion of their projects and programs. These increase costs and \ndeprive  the  intended  beneficiaries.  Project  implementation  units  are  usually  severely \nunderstaffed  and  staff  are  often  underqualified.  There  is  no  systematic  review  of  project \nperformance,  and  no  mechanism  in  place  to  reward  good  performers  and  penalize  poor \nperformers. Coordination within Government is weak and it takes an inordinate amount of time \nto resolve normal development problems. As a result, projects are usually 3\u20134 years late. These \ndelays impose a high opportunity cost and undermine the projects' development effectiveness.   \n \n2.  Opportunities \n \n26.  There is an urgent need to realign public spending within a realistic revenue envelope. \nThis is a prerequisite to reducing economic imbalances and restoring a sustainable growth \ntrajectory over the medium term. The Government has initiated reforms to strengthen its fiscal \nposition and, as the country nears middle-income status, the Government plans to reduce its \ndirect role in the economy, and to facilitate a greater role for private sector. To promote the \nreform  initiatives,  the  Government  has  requested  ADB  assistance.  With  net  international \nreserves down to $53 million in early August 2009, a significant contraction in the 2009 growth \nrate and a large financing gap, this is the time to undertake sustainable remedial actions. The \nProgram is consistent with the strategic thrust of the country partnership strategy4 and ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2020,5 represents ADB\u2019s responsiveness to an economic emergency, and reflects \nclose coordination with development partners.  \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM  \n27.  The Program has five major components: (i) strengthening fiscal policy and bolstering \nbudget  formulation  and  implementation;  (ii)  implementing  revenue,  expenditure,  and  debt \nmanagement measures to strengthen fiscal policy; (iii) strengthening mechanisms for financing \nthe budget; (iv) facilitating privatization of SOEs; and (v) strengthening internal audit operations. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n28.  The impact of the Program will be an enhanced recovery and sustainable growth of the \neconomy over the medium term by removing the distortions that have led to the current large \neconomic imbalances. By supporting long overdue structural reforms, the Program will move \ntoward a more broad-based sustainable development framework that reduces the country's \nvulnerability to external shocks and prepares it for scheduled graduation to middle-income \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2007.

", "7 \ncountry status on 1 January 2011. The Program takes into account the remedial actions either \nalready taken by the Government or planned for the coming months. It outlines subsequent \nactions that will need to be undertaken to deepen the reform process and return the economy to \na sustainable growth trajectory. \n \n29.  The medium-term outcomes of the Program include (i) enhancing the realism and value \nof the budget as a policy tool; (ii) improving fiscal discipline and predictability; (iii) moving the \nbudget preparation process from a needs to an availability basis; (iv) ensuring that a results \nframework is used to track overall development performance and measure progress toward \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals; (iv) facilitating timely implementation of \ndevelopment assistance from ADB and other development partners to enhance development \neffectiveness; (v) improving monitoring and management of internal and external debt and \nretain them at sustainable levels; (vi) putting Government finances on a sounder footing and \navoiding inflationary domestic finance; (vii) deepening financial markets by issuing Treasury \nbills, and providing the MMA with a market-based instrument for liquidity management. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n1.  Component  1:  Strengthening  Fiscal  Policy  and  Bolstering  Budget \nFormulation and Implementation \n30.  Strengthening  policy  framework.  The Program seeks to improve the fiscal policy \nframework and budget preparation process to ensure a commitment to fiscal discipline and \nmacroeconomic stability. Sound fiscal discipline is critical to small, open economies such as the \nMaldives, where fiscal prudence and stabilization of inflation are essential to ensure effective \nmacroeconomic management and smooth adjustment to potential external shocks. To establish \nan overall framework for fiscal consolidation, a fiscal responsibility act will be drafted during the \nProgram period. This will stipulate budget deficit targets that cannot be exceeded, and make it a \nlegal requirement for future budgets to be linked to the medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF). \nThe draft act should be submitted for parliamentary approval by June 2011. The MTFF in the \nrevised 2009 budget will be strengthened and will continue to describe a realistic path to fiscal \nconsolidation. The MTFF will develop rolling revenue and expenditure projections over a 3-year \nperiod,  based  on  underlying  assumptions  such  as  GDP  growth,  inflation,  exchange  rates, \ninterest rates, tourism inflows, and external trade. The MTFF will anchor the preparation of the \nbudget and will be updated regularly. Its assumptions and projections will generate a fiscal \nposition and borrowing requirement that are consistent with the Government's overarching fiscal \nand debt strategy.  \n    \n31.  The adoption of MTFF will move away from the current project-based approach to \ndevelopment assistance. While the assistance may be for specific sectors or projects, the \nresources made available will become part of well defined sector strategies supporting overall \ngovernment development policies. Furthermore, there will be an increasing integration between \ndevelopment and recurrent budget taking into account recurring costs (i.e., operations and \nmaintenance) resulting from fixed capital formation. The Government will soon approve a new \nNational Development Strategy (NDS), based on the Government's election manifesto and \nclose stakeholder consultation. It includes a preliminary costing of programs and a results-\nbased monitoring framework. The United Nations Development Programme is assisting the \nGovernment with the NDS.  \n \n ", "8 \n32.  The Program will support various MOFT actions related to the MTFF. First, MOFT will \ndevelop medium-term sector road maps based on NDS goals. These will have clear objectives \nand  policies  and  a  results-based  monitoring  framework  to  measure  how  programs  can \neffectively  meet  sector  objectives.  Second,  MOFT  will  develop  a  budget  programming \nframework to ensure that expenditure on the development budget follows sector objectives, \npolicies, and programs. Third, MOFT will issue budget circulars requiring line ministries to align \nproposed development expenditures closely with sector goals and policies. Fourth, MOFT will \ndevelop project selection criteria for the PSIP budget and ensure recurrent costs are reflected in \nannual  budgets.  Fifth,  MOFT  will  introduce,  on  a  pilot  basis,  principles  of  results-  or \nperformance-based budgeting in three key sectors (transport, health, and education). Sixth, \nMOFT  will  develop  a  monitoring  framework  for  budget  implementation  to  allow  for  \n(i) alignment with the MTFF, (ii) ex-post evaluation of how closely actual development spending \nwas aligned with the budget, and (iii) an assessment of the contribution to sector outcomes. \nFinally, MOFT will migrate and reconcile 2009 revenue and expenditure accounts into public \naccounting system-compatible format, and prepare the 2011 budget based on public accounting \nsystem reporting requirements.  \n \n2.  Component 2: Implementing Revenue, Expenditure, and Debt Management \nMeasures to Strengthen the Fiscal Policy \n33.  Revenue measures. In parallel with the Government's efforts to strengthen fiscal policy \nand budget preparation, it will continue to strengthen the revenue base and to rationalize \nexpenditures, leading to a progressively lower budget deficit. On the revenue side, the Program \nwill  facilitate  the  diversification  of  the  tax  base  and  increase  revenues  through  higher  tax \ncollection. In addition to the business profit tax (BPT) and tax administration bills, the Program \nrequires the MOFT to submit the tourism goods and services tax bill to Parliament by the end of \n2009.  Subsequent  to  Parliamentary  approval  for  enhancing  the  airport  passenger  service \ncharge (airport tax) from the current $12 to $18.5 per ticket, MOFT will issue a circular to \ntransfer the proceeds of the airport tax from Maldives Airport Company Limited to the Treasury. \nWhile these actions are to be completed in 2009, the Program envisages extension of the goods \nand services tax to non-tourism sectors by submission of a bill to Parliament by June 2011.   \n \n34.  The BPT will be more complex than other taxes administered by the Department of \nInland  Revenue  (DIR)  and  will  require  intensive  preparatory  work,  including  registering \ntaxpayers,  undertaking  tax  survey  work,  and  reviewing  audited  statements,  compliance \nassessment, and post-tax audits. As part of the measures to strengthen DIR, the TA grant will \nhelp to build tax administration capacity, including developing a large taxpayer unit focusing on \nthe collection of BPT for the largest 50 companies; approving operations manuals, auditing \nmanuals,  and  taxpayer  guides;  and  collecting  other  information  to  prepare  for  the  actual \ncollection of BPT. As part of the upgrading of the DIR, the Government will strengthen the \nstaffing  of  the  revenue  administration.  Automation  of  the  DIR  will  also  enable  effective \nmanagement of the tax base. A computerized database will help in effective risk assessment \nand in planning an appropriate audit strategy. It will also provide the department with a tool to \ninstitutionalize performance management within the department. ADB has already initiated the \ntransformation of DIR through the preparation of a Roadmap on the modernization of revenue \nadministration (Supplementary Appendix H). \n \n35.  Expenditure measures. In order to align expenditure with revenues, the Government is \nfinalizing  a  human  resource  management  plan,  setting  out  the  principles  and  criteria  for \ndownsizing  the  civil  service  and  constituting  the  framework  for  implementation  of  the \nredundancy program. The first phase of a redundancy program will be implemented by the end ", "9 \nof 2009, resulting in a reduction of at least 2,000 staff in Government and SOEs. The second \nphase will be completed in 2010 with a further reduction of a minimum of 3,000 civil servants \nand followed by another 3,000 by June 2011. Along with the reduction in the civil service, the \nGovernment  plans  to  reduce  and  then  eliminate  power  subsidies  and  linking  power  tariff \nadjustments, on a biannual basis, to cost of inputs. \n  \n36.  Debt management measures. Previous ADB support to strengthen the Government's \ndebt management capacity6 needs to be built upon. The need to develop an effective and \ncomprehensive debt monitoring and management system is underscored by the recent build-up \nof  debt.  As  the  Maldives  moves  toward  middle-income  country  status,  its  debt  will  be \nincreasingly priced on commercial terms and strong debt management practices will result in \nsignificant savings for the Treasury. Various measures under the Program will support debt \nmanagement. The Government will develop and approve a debt strategy, which will allow better \nplanning of its borrowing strategy and introduce regular debt sustainability analysis to monitor \ndebt and manage the associated risks. The debt strategy's objectives will include achieving \nconsistency with the objectives of the MTFF, improving debt management, undertaking the first \ndebt sustainability assessment, and finalizing a framework to monitor external private debt.  \n \n37.  Regarding the contingent liabilities originating from SOE debt, MOFT will prepare a \nstudy that identifies the stock of outstanding liabilities on SOE balance sheets (with a focus on \nSTELCO and STO) by the end of 2009. Further, by end 2009, the Government will issue bonds \nor make other arrangements to retire the outstanding circular debt owed by STELCO to STO. \n \n3.  Component 3: Strengthening the Mechanisms for Financing the Budget \n38.  To reform the mechanisms for efficient financing of fiscal deficit, liquidity forecasting will \nbe strengthened at MOFT. A framework will analyze monthly Treasury cash flow and will be \nused to support liquidity forecasting by the MMA. A progressive reduction of the outstanding \nbalance  on  W&MA  will  be  achieved  and  greater  reliance  will  be  placed  on  open  market \noperations using Treasury bills, including the eventual conversion of outstanding W&MA. MMA \nwill prepare a study on a system of primary dealers and brokers for auctioning Treasury bills \nand subsequent trading in the secondary market. It will also establish a framework to replace \nthe fixed rate tap system with a variable rate Treasury bill auction system to develop competitive \nbidding and trading in Government securities. The W&MA ceiling will not be breached and \npublic sector borrowing will be mobilized in the domestic market, thereby reducing liquidity \ninjections and containing inflationary pressures. By June 2011, MOFT and MMA will revisit the \nmemorandum of understanding dated 30 August 2006 with the objective of further reducing the \nceiling on W&MA. In the medium term, the Program anticipates that Treasury bill and bond \nissuances, and their eventual trading will contribute to deepening of financial markets and \nproviding MMA with a market-based instrument for liquidity management. The development of \ntradable securities at the short end of the market will also serve to enhance the conduct of \nmonetary  policy.  For  this  purpose,  MMA  will  arrange  the  trading  of  Treasury  bills  in  the \nsecondary market, including open market operations. To enhance demand, MMA will include \nTreasury bills as eligible items under its minimum reserve requirements for commercial banks \nand will allow non-institutional investors to participate in the Treasury bills market.  \n \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2003.

Component 4: Facilitating Privatization of State-Owned Enterprises \n39.  The privatization of SOEs forms a core plank of the Government's economic reform \nagenda.  It  has  established  an  independent  Privatization  Committee  to  oversee  the \nimplementation  of  the  privatization  policy.  Invest  Maldives  under  the  Ministry  of  Economic \nDevelopment is the implementation agency for privatization, in close consultation with the Public \nEnterprise Monitoring and Evaluation Board (PEMEB) under MOFT. Invest Maldives has posted \nfollowing SOEs for privatization on the Government website: Maldives National Shipping; Mal\u00e9 \nWater  and  Sewerage;  Maldives  Industrial  Fisheries  (for  joint  venture  partnerships  in  fish \nfreezing,  fish  canning,  and  aquaculture);  Waste  Management;  STELCO;  Maldives  National \nBroadcasting; MIA; Thilafalhu Development in the Greater Mal\u00e9 Region; and Regional Utility \nServices. As a part of the Government's efforts to privatize selected SOEs, a formal privatization \npolicy is being prepared that will establish clear principles underlying the privatization process, \nincluding the necessary checks and balances. \n \n40.  Development partners have been supporting the privatization program. ADB has been \nworking with PEMEB to develop a monitoring framework to assess the performance of SOEs \nand has supported possible reforms to STELCO, building on a new business model. Further \nwork is needed to develop (i) a framework that will categorize SOEs into those to be retained \nand restructured under Government ownership, those to be privatized, and those to be closed; \n(ii) guidelines for financial restructuring, detailing the procedure for implementing a financial \nrestructuring plan for loss-making entities; (iii) a redundancy scheme for employees of SOEs; \n(iv) enforcement of the institutional structure for SOE reforms under the Privatization Committee \n(to address issues that arise from individual SOEs being sponsored by different ministries); and \n(v) guidelines on the privatization process to ensure that the Government shares in those SOEs \nidentified  for  privatization  are  divested  through  a  fair,  transparent,  and  objective  bidding \nprocess. The International Finance Corporation has been hired as a lead manager in the \nprivatization of MIA. \n1.   \n5.  Component 5: Strengthening Internal Audit Operations \n41.  ADB  has  assisted  the  Government's  efforts  to  put  in  place  appropriate  institutional \narrangements, systems, and procedures to discharge internal audit functions, including the \ndevelopment  of  a  strategic  management  plan.  Human  resource  development  and  model \noperating procedures were developed during this first phase. ADB's follow-up assistance will be \ntaking account of the recommendations made by the IMF under its recent public expenditure \nand  financial  accountability  assessment.  The  IMF's  work  on  strengthening  budgetary \nmechanisms  and  debt  management  will  be  synchronized  with  ADB's  support  for  debt \nsustainability assessments. \n \n42.  The approval of the strategic management plan will usher in the start of the Program's \nsecond phase, during which auditing standards and registration requirements will be developed, \ntogether with model reporting requirements. Comprehensive internal audit manuals will also be \ncompleted. Capacity development will be an integral part of this phase. The third phase will \ncomprise the carrying out of risk-based audits in a diligent, consistent, and effective manner and \nin full compliance with the Public Accounting Act of 2007. The internal audit function will roll out \ninto budgetary agencies on a pilot basis.  \n \n ", "11 \nC.  Creation of Apex Program Management Unit \n43.  As noted in ADB's 2007 country partnership strategy (footnote 4), capacity constraints \nseverely affect the optimization of all externally-assisted projects and programs. The practice of \nestablishing  project-specific  PIUs  has  not  worked  well,  as  they  have  never  been  properly \nstaffed. As a result, projects are completed 3\u20134 years late, undermining their development \neffectiveness. Under the Program, ADB and the Government have agreed that an apex project \nmanagement unit (PMU) will be established at the MOFT and two thematic project management \nunits (TPMU) will also be established in the Ministry of Housing, Transport, and Environment; \nand the Ministry of Economic Development. These will not only monitor the implementation of \nADB-assisted projects, but also those of other development partners. The apex PMU will meet \nevery quarter, identify timely remedial measures, and publish the minutes of its meetings on the \nMOFT website. The creation of these PMUs will result in cost efficiencies and allow them to be \nstaffed appropriately. ADB will support the creation of the PMUs as well as their functioning \nduring the program period. The performance assessment of the PMUs will be an integral part of \nthe overall implementation assessment of the Program. It is envisaged that other development \npartners may also contribute to the funding of such PMUs.  \n \nD.  Important Features and Lessons  \n44.  The lessons in processing the Program are twofold: (i) the authorities' failure to address \nstructural issues in a timely manner adds to costs and makes the adjustment path steeper; and \n(ii) institutional weaknesses, manifesting itself in poor macroeconomic management, highlights \nthe need to build the capacity to manage an open, import-dependent economy, and to have \nsystems in place that provide timely signals for the Government. Complacency and undue \nreliance on tourism need to be avoided through long overdue structural reforms (although \nadmittedly these will have to be addressed in an adverse global economic environment). The \nprocess of privatizing selected SOEs needs to be carefully managed to ensure that the process \nis conducted transparently according to well-defined rules.  \n  \n45.  The Program has a high degree of political ownership from the Government, and the \nlegislative assembly (the Majlis). The scale of reform measures approved by the Majlis in 2009 \nsuggests that the economic reform program enjoys bipartisan support. Unlike in the past, the \nGovernment  has  been  very  transparent  about  the  objectives  it  wants  to  achieve  with  the \nProgram and forthcoming about its likely costs. It has listed a menu of reform measures that it \nwill pursue. The Program is being developed in close consultation with the Government and \nother development partners such as IMF and World Bank. In the run-up to the Program, many \njoint missions were fielded, and, given the nature of the support, a holistic approach has been \npursued.  ADB  has  shared  the  policy  matrix  with  the  IMF  and  the  World  Bank  and  has \ncoordinated closely with them in the final design.  \n \n E.  Cost and Financing Plan \n1.  Cost \n46.  Policy reform adjustment costs are estimated at $231 million (Table 1). The bulk of the \ncosts are associated with the implementation of the redundancy program, payment of the \nGovernment's share of the accrued pension liability (after passage of the 2009 Pension Act), \nretirement of existing circular debt owed by SOEs like STELCO, and services related to the \nintroduction of taxes and capacity development.  \n \n ", "12 \nTable 1: Indicative Program Adjustment Costs for the Economic Recovery Program \n($ million) \nOutputs and Areas for Support    Costs \n1.

Financing Plan \n47.  ADB will provide a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR21,912,000 ($35 million \nequivalent) from its Special Funds resources. The program loan will have a 24-year term \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter. ADB will also provide a technical assistance (TA) \npackage of $4.5 million in support of the Program, comprising (i) a TA grant of $3.0 million, from \nADB's TA Special Fund (TASF-IV), in support of various institutional strengthening initiatives; \nand (ii) a TA loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR939,000 ($1.5 million equivalent) from \nADB's Special Funds resources in support of capacity development and privatization initiatives. \nThe TA loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest \ncharge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. ADB \nsupport will cover 15% of the adjustment cost while the Government will cover 36%. The \nremainder will be funded by other development partners (although the nature of the IMF\u2019s \nStand-By  Arrangement  and  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Development  Support  Facility  is  accounted \ndifferently from budget support).   \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan for the Economic Recovery Program \nAmount  Share \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank  35.0  15.0 \nGovernmenta  84.0  36.0 \nOther Development Partnersb  112.0  49.0 \nTotal  231.0  100.0 \na  Includes in-kind contribution of office space, counterpart staff, and administrative support. \nb  The IMF is providing $92.5 million under a Stand-By Arrangement and the World Bank \n$24 million possibly under a Development Support Facility. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. ", "13 \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Program Management \n \n48.  The MOFT will be the Executing Agency (EA) of the Program. A steering committee will \nbe established to ensure effective and timely implementation of the Program by monitoring \nperformance and coordinating efforts across various implementing agencies. It will be chaired \nby the minister of state for finance and will include representatives from the President's Office, \nMOFT, the Privatization Committee, Department of National Planning, PEMEB, and MMA. ADB \nwill  participate  as  an  observer.  In  consultation  with  ADB,  the  Government  will  appoint  a \nsecretary of the committee. The committee will meet at least once every quarter to discuss \nimplementation progress and address any outstanding issues. The secretary will officiate as the \nprogram  director  and  will  be  responsible  for  coordination  efforts  across  the  five  program \ncomponents. Quarterly progress reports will be sent to ADB highlighting the achievements and \npotential problem areas to be addressed by the committee. In addition, the apex PMU at MOFT \nwill be responsible for overseeing Program implementation as part of its broader agenda to \nenhance development effectiveness.  \n \n2.  Program Period and Tranching \n \n49.  The  Program  is  expected  to  be  completed  in  36  months,  from  January  2010  to \nDecember 2012. The loan will be released in two tranches: (i) SDR11,269,028 ($18 million \nequivalent) upon fulfillment of agreed conditions for the first tranche and following effectiveness \nof the loan, and (ii) SDR10,642,972 ($17 million equivalent) upon confirmation of compliance \nwith all agreed conditions for the second tranche release. It is estimated that the second tranche \nwill be disbursed within 18 months of loan effectiveness.  \n \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement  \n \n50.  The Program proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding \nlocal duties and taxes) of imports produced, and procured, in ADB member countries, excluding \nineligible items and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources (Appendix 7). \nThe Government will certify its compliance with this formula with each withdrawal request. \nOtherwise, import documentation under existing procedures will be required. The Program \nproceeds will be disbursed to the Government in accordance with the provisions of ADB's \ndisbursement procedures.   \n \n4.  Counterpart Funds \n \n51.  The local currency generated from the proceeds of the Program will be used to finance \nadjustment costs under the Program.  \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy and Governance Risks \n \n52.  Governance and corruption risks in the Program can be categorized broadly as those \nevident in the broader political economic context, and those that are program-specific. The \nbroader risks include weakening Government commitment to necessary reforms; impending \npolitical changes, creating an environment of policy uncertainty; lack of consensus among \nstakeholders on needed policy reforms and on how far to push the reform envelope; and \nnegative exogenous shocks (both economic and otherwise). Program-specific risks include  \n(i) continued capacity constraints in key economic and financial agencies; (ii) continued inability \n ", "14 \nof the Government to formulate and commit to a suitable fiscal consolidation policy and strategy; \nand (iii) an inability to deepen civil service reforms. For further risk analysis, see Appendix 8 and \nSupplementary Appendix A. \n \n53.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date),  as  well  as  the  Second \nGovernance  and  Anticorruption  Action  Plan,  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \nGovernment and the EA. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, \nand transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any \nallegedly corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Program and the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin the Loan Agreement and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts \nfinanced by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of \nADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the EA and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n54.  The Government will maintain records and accounts for the Program and the Project, in \naccordance with sound accounting principles, and will have such accounts and records audited \nannually by auditors acceptable to ADB. To ensure proper fund management, ADB retains the \nright to audit the use of program and project loan proceeds. The accounts will be managed, \noperated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB. The Government will \nensure that submission of reports, audited accounts, and financial statements are in compliance \nwith ADB\u2019s guidelines. Audited annual accounts by independent auditors acceptable to ADB will \nbe submitted to ADB within 6 months of the reporting period (i.e., within 6 months of the end of \nthe fiscal year). The annual audit for the Project will provide a separate audit opinion on the \nsoundness  of  (i) the  statement  of  expenditure  operations,  and  (ii)  the  imprest  account \noperations. The Government was advised of ADB\u2019s requirement of timely submission of audited \naccounts  and  financial  statements,  and  was  advised  about  suspension  and  acceleration \nsections. \n \n7.  Program Monitoring  \n \n55.  Program  monitoring,  in  the  first  instance,  will  be  done  by  the  steering  committee, \nsupplemented by the apex PMU of MOFT and will be complemented by periodic ADB review \nmissions. These will (i) confirm the fulfillment of policy actions for tranche releases; (ii) confirm \nthe release of adequate funds from the Government for program activities; (iii) monitor the \ncontinued applicability of the assumptions underlying the Program, as well as specific risks and \ntheir mitigating measures; and (iv) advise on actions to maintain effective implementation within \nthe program period. Relevant baseline indicators and targets have been incorporated into the \ndesign and monitoring framework (Appendix 1).  \n \n8.  Program Review \n \n56.  The Government and ADB will review program implementation at least three times a \nyear. The reviews will evaluate the program scope, implementation arrangements, consultations \nwith the MOFT and the program director, progress with the policy reform agenda, and capacity \ndevelopment measures. ADB will also field regular review missions, including a midterm review \nmission and a program completion review mission 3 months after completion. The review \nmissions will assess progress and identify any necessary changes in program and project ", "15 \ndesign, the implementation schedule and/or implementation arrangements, and compliance with \nthe terms of conditions of the loan agreements.  \n \nG.  ADB\u2019s Coordination with Other Development Partners \n57.  ADB\u2019s close coordination with IMF, the World Bank, and other development partners is \ndescribed in Appendix 3, Table A3.2. The Program is being parallel financed by IMF and World \nBank. ADB and IMF staff have been cooperating closely to develop an economic recovery \npackage, and IMF has endorsed the policy matrix of the Program. IMF reached a staff-level \nagreement with the Government in August 2009 for a Stand-By Arrangement of SDR67 million \n(about $88 million). IMF board approval is envisaged in early December 2009. The Stand-By \nArrangement supports stabilization measures based on a macroeconomic and fiscal framework \nand is in line with resources to ensure overall debt sustainability. It will include policy actions to \nimprove the fiscal and balance of payments position and to strengthen the financial sector. \nApart from balance of payments support, IMF is providing assistance for better management of \nTreasury bills system and open market operations, as well as for drafting the fiscal responsibility \nlegislation. World Bank support is expected to cover pension and civil service reforms. In \naddition, the International Finance Corporation is providing advisory support for the privatization \nof  SOEs,  and  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  is  providing  assistance  to  the \nGovernment to transform its political manifesto into a national development plan. \n \nV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n58.  The country partnership strategy recognized that human resource deficiencies are a \nsignificant  binding  constraints  on  the  Government's  economic  management.  Given  that  a \nnumber of new economic measures are to be pursued under the Program, technical support \nneeds to be provided to ensure the Government can implement these initiatives successfully. A \nTA package of $4.5 million is therefore proposed. This will comprise (i) a TA loan of $1.5 million \nfor supporting capacity development and privatization initiatives, and (ii) TA grant of $3.0 million \nfrom ADB's TA Special Fund-IV for institutional strengthening initiatives. Details of the various \npackages under both the TA loan and TA grant are in Appendix 6.  \n \n59.  The primary outcome of the TA package will be significant capacity development in \ngovernment institutions responsible for economic management in general and implementation \nof the Program in particular. A key objective of the TA package is to enable the Government to \ncomply with all policy actions under the Program in a timely manner.  \n \nA.  Technical  Assistance  Loan  (Project  Loan  for  Capacity  Development  for  the \nProgram) \n1.  Impact and Outcome \n \n60.  The impact of the TA loan will be to enhance the Government's capacity to accomplish \nthe  policy  and  institutional  reforms  supported  by  the  Program.  The  outcomes  will  be  \n(i) capacity development of the EA and the implementing agencies by training large numbers of \nofficials  by  consultants  in  conjunction  with  local  training  institutions;  and  (ii)  capacity \ndevelopment  of  the  Privatization  Committee  and  Invest  Maldives  to  expedite  ongoing \nprivatization of SOEs. Advance action on this TA will support targeted tranche reform measures \nunder the Program within the implementation period.7 \n                                                 \n7  The Government has been advised that such advance action does not commit ADB to finance the TA.  \n ", "16 \n2.  Outputs \n \n61.  Deepening overall capacity. One component of the TA loan will be the strengthening of \ncapacity and professional skills of the EA. This will include support for implementing agencies to \nenable them to carry out the policy reforms and actions specified in the Program\u2019s policy matrix. \nTA support will be provided for institutional and human resource capacity building to develop \nskills in management, leadership, facilitation, negotiation, and conflict resolution, as well as \ntraining to implement policy and procedural actions under the Program. To ensure the efficient \ntraining of large numbers of officials, trained consultants will be recruited in conjunction with \nlocal training institutions. \n \n62.  Strengthening privatization framework. Another component of the TA loan will focus \non capacity building of the Privatization Committee and its secretariat, Invest Maldives. This will \ninclude the following activities: (i) preparation of the framework on the basis of which the SOEs \nidentified  for  reforms  will  be  categorized  into those  to  be  retained  and  restructured  under \nGovernment ownership, those to be privatized, and those to be closed; (ii) preparation of \nguidelines  for  financial  restructuring  detailing  the  procedure  for  implementing  a  financial \nrestructuring  plan  for  loss-making  entities;  (iii)  preparation  of  a  redundancy  package  for \nemployees of SOEs, (iv) assisting the Government to enforce the institutional structure for SOE \nreforms under Privatization Committee to address issues that arise from individual SOEs being \nsponsored by different ministries; and (v) preparation of guidelines on the privatization process \nfor ensuring that the Government ownership shares in SOEs identified for privatization are \ndivested through a fair, transparent, and objective bidding process. \n \n63.  The privatization component will assist the Government in conceptualizing, preparing, \nand developing projects that involve private companies on a public\u2013private partnership basis. \nThe TA Project will recommend the optimum project structure to attract competitive bids from \nthe private sector, form the basis of a contract between the private sector and the Government, \nand bring the projects to financial closure. \n \n3.  Cost and Financing \n \n64.  The TA loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR939,000 ($1.5 million equivalent) \nfrom ADB's Special Funds resources will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 \nyears, and an interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter.  The  amount  equivalent  to  $0.3  million  for  in-kind  support  will  be  borne  by  the \nGovernment.  The  detailed  cost  estimates  are  in  Appendix  10  (the  terms  of  reference  for \nconsulting services and other details are in Supplementary Appendix E). \n \nTable 3: Financing Plan for the Technical Assistance Loan \nAmount  Share  \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank  1.50  83 \nGovernment  0.30  17 \nTotal  1.80  100 \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n \n ", "17 \nB.  Technical  Assistance  Grant  (Institutional  Strengthening  for  Economic \nManagement) \n65.  The outputs of the TA grant will be:  \n \n(i)  strengthening administration of new taxes introduced under the Program; \n(ii)  developing capacity of MOFT for implementing new revenue measures, debt \nmanagement, budget formulation, and expenditure rationalization;  \n(iii)  strengthening MOFT\u2019s internal audit unit; and  \n(iv)  providing support for the apex PMU and two TPMUs. \n \n66.  Even with the passage of the proposed new tax bills, significant work needs to be \nundertaken to enforce the legislation, especially the BPT, which will be directly implemented by \nDIR.  The  TA  grant  will  therefore  help  to  build  DIR's  capacity  to  introduce  the  new  taxes \nsmoothly. Other taxation-related activities will include (i) reviewing the reform strategy and \nmanuals previously prepared by ADB,8 (ii) assessing capacity constraints to ensure effective tax \nadministration within DIR, and (iii) recommending organizational restructuring. In addition, the \nTA grant will assist in developing and conducting surveys, workshops, and public awareness \ncampaigns for the taxpayers, and preparing a road map and a list of large taxpayers. Further, \nthe TA grant will assist in developing staff instructions, and providing training on tax audit \ntechniques, reviewing and assessing automation at DIR, and recommending suggestions on \nhardware and software.  \n \n67.  The TA grant includes capacity building of MOFT through (i) a study on SOE outstanding \nliabilities, i.e., circular debt; (ii) a framework for cash flow projections on both revenue and \nexpenditure,  (iii)  support  for  the  debt  management  component  of  the  Program,  and \n(iv) continued capacity building of the Internal Audit Unit of MOFT (which has already begun \nunder ongoing ADB TA9 funded by the Australian Agency for International Development, and (v) \ndeveloping budget programming frameworks, including performance-based budgeting, monthly \nand ex-post evaluation of budget implementation.  \n \n68.  Timely implementation of the portfolios of ADB and other development partners is critical \nto avoid cost overruns, strengthen results orientation, and enhance development effectiveness. \nThe TA grant will support fully staffed apex PMU and functional TPMUs at two ministries, \nincluding  institutionalizing  mechanisms  for  quarterly  portfolio  performance.  Systemic  issues \nbeyond the remit of the TPMUs will be discussed at the apex PMU, and if necessary, raised at \nthe level of Department of National Planning. \n \n     Table  4: Financing Plan for Technical Assistance Grant \n  Total  Share \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \n     \nAsian Development Bank  3.00 83 \nGovernment  0.60 17 \nTotal  3.60 100 \nSource: Asian Development Bank     \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2002.

TA management and implementation period. The MOFT will be the EA of the TA \nloan. The Ministry of Economic Development will be the implementing agency for component 1 \nand the MOFT will be the implementing agency for component 2 (Appendix 6). The TA loan is \nscheduled to commence following the loan effectiveness of the Program, and completed by \nDecember 2012. \n \n70.  Procurement and consulting services. Consultants to be financed will be recruited in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). Consultancy contract packages using the quality- and cost-based selection method and \nconsultants  qualifications  selection  will  be  used  to  recruit  consultants,  based  on  technical \nproposals, for specific subcomponents under the TA. Procurement of any goods or services \nshall be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). Goods such as equipment or training material will be purchased using shopping \nprocedures.  \n \n71.  Disbursements. The TA loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with the Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). The Government will certify \nthat the loan proceeds will be used as agreed in a manner satisfactory to ADB.  \n \n72.  To facilitate implementation, an imprest account will be set up with MMA and will be \nmanaged by MOFT. The imprest account will be denominated in US dollars. The initial advance \nto  be  deposited  to  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  either  6  months  of  estimated \nexpenditures for TA loan to be financed from the imprest account, or 10% of the TA loan \namount, whichever is lower. To expedite funds flow and simplify documentation process, the \nstatement of expenditures procedure will be used by MOFT for reimbursement, liquidation and \nreplenishment  of  the  imprest  account  for  eligible  expenditures  not  exceeding  $50,000  per \nindividual payment. Payments in excess of statement of expenditures ceiling will be liquidated or \nreplenished based on full supporting documentation process.10  \n \n73.  Governance and corruption risks. Governance and corruption risks in the TA loan will \nbe covered as mentioned above under the Program loan implementation (paras. 52\u201353).  \n \n74.  Accounting, auditing, and reporting. The accounting, auditing, and reporting will be \nmaintained as mentioned above under the program loan implementation (para. 54). Further \ndetails are in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \n75.  Monitoring and evaluation. The Government and ADB will periodically review TA loan \nimplementation.  The  reviews  will  include  evaluation  of  project  scope,  implementation \narrangements, consultations with the EA, progress on the policy reform agenda, and progress \non capacity building measures. The Government and ADB will conduct TA loan reviews in \nconjunction with program review as mentioned above under the program loan implementation \n(paras. 55\u201356).  \n \n                                                 \n10 Given that an imprest account is proposed under the TA loan, the bank charges will be financed from the TA loan \nresources, as required by ADB. 2008.

The TA grant will commence following loan effectiveness \nof the Program, and be completed over 3 years.  \n \n77.  Procurement and consulting services. Consultants to be financed from the TA grant \nwill be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). Consultancy contracts packages using quality and cost based \nselection  method  and  consultants'  qualification  selection  will  be  utilized  for  selection  of \nconsultants,  based  on  technical  proposals,  for  specific  subcomponents  under  the  TA. \nProcurement  of  any  goods  or  services  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Goods, e.g., equipment or \ntraining material, will be purchased using Shopping procedures.   \n \n78.  Disbursements.    The  TA  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with \napplicable ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.11 \n \n79.  Monitoring and evaluation. Institutional strengthening through results-based capacity \ndevelopment is a necessary condition for policy ownership and effective management of the \neconomy. The Government and ADB will periodically review TA grant implementation based on \nquarterly reports of the apex PMU and the two TPMUs, as well as consultant reports. The \nreviews will include evaluation of the scope, implementation arrangements, consultations with \nthe EA and TPMUs, progress with the policy reform agenda, and capacity building measures \nand progress.  The Government and ADB will conduct TA grant review in conjunction with the \nprogram review. \n  \n80.  Accounting, auditing, and reporting.  The accounting, auditing and reporting will be \nmaintained as mentioned above under the program loan implementation (para 54). \n  \nVI.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Expected Benefits and Impacts \n81.  The Program will remove the distortions in the economy that have led to significant \neconomic  imbalances  and  will  thereby  support  recovery  and  sustainable  growth  over  the \nmedium  term.  By  undertaking  long  overdue  structural  reforms,  the Program  will  move  the \nMaldives toward a  more broad-based sustainable development framework that reduces its   \nvulnerability to external shocks and prepares it for scheduled graduation to middle-income \ncountry status on 1 January 2011. The key end-of-program outcomes will be greater financial \nflexibility and improved management of the Government budget through a more diversified tax \nbase, more rational expenditure, and better debt management. The Program will support the \nprivatization of SOEs and deepen the financial market through the issuance of Treasury bills \nand bonds. \n \n82.  The Program is expected to increase tax collection, improve expenditure management \nsystems, and support the Government to divest itself of SOEs. These measures should lead to \na reduction in macroeconomic imbalances, and improvements in macroeconomic management. \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook. Manila. \n ", "20 \nOver  the  medium  term,  it  is  expected  that  project  performance  ratios,  including  portfolio \nperformance indicators, will strengthen significantly thereby improving aid effectiveness.  \n \n83.  Strengthening the Maldives' macroeconomic profile, improving the alignment between \ndevelopment spending and sector priorities and programs, introducing new taxes, rationalizing \nexpenditures, and making progress toward the divestment and privatization of SOEs will expand \nthe economic base to support more broad-based economic growth, and equip government \nagencies with modern analytical tools to manage the development process, facilitate the inflow \nof foreign direct investment, and smooth the transition to a middle-income country status.   \n \nB.  Risk Analysis \n84.  By their nature, economic reform programs carry risks, including political risks. In this \ncase, the political risks are mitigated to a significant degree by the strong prior actions that have \nbeen taken. In contrast to previous practice, the Government has strong ownership of the \nProgram  and  the  reform  agenda  at  all  levels.  The  President  himself  has  been  a  leading \nchampion of the reform process. The Government has been candid about the comprehensive \nnature of the economic reforms it needs to undertake. This will help to mitigate the political risks \nand expedite the legislative approval process.  \n \n85.  The budget financing gap remains large and there is a risk that it may deteriorate further, \ngiven the uncertainty of realizing privatization proceeds. However, a Government IMF program \nwill set out the medium-term macroeconomic and fiscal framework and support policy measures \nthat will contribute to the timely implementation of the reforms.   \n  \n86.  There is limited capacity across government, including in the area of procurement. The \nProgram  includes  the  implementation  of  new  taxes,  strengthening  of  internal  audit,  and \ncommencement of the privatization process, all of which require specialized expertise. The \nProgram addresses these constraints by providing capacity building TA as a part of package \nthat will mitigate the risks that arise during the procurement and administrative procedures.  \n \nVII.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n87.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which will be incorporated into the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The  Government  will  promptly  adopt  the  policies  and  take  the  actions  as \nspecified in the development policy letter and the policy matrix, and ensure that \nsuch policies and actions continue in effect during and after the period of the \nProgram; \n \n(ii)  The Government will ensure that the policies adopted and actions taken prior to \nthe Program as described in the development policy letter will continue in effect \nfor the duration of the program period and subsequently;  \n \n(iii)  The  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with  other \nmultilateral  and  bilateral  aid  agencies  that  may  have  implications  for  the \nimplementation of the Program, and will provide ADB with an opportunity to \ncomment on any resulting policy proposals;  ", "21 \n \n(iv)  The Government will use local currency funds generated by the program loan to \nmeet the program expenditures and associated costs of reforms; and ensure that \nnecessary budgetary allocations are provided to meet the recurrent costs under \nthe technical assistance; \n \n(v)  Within 1 month of the effective date of the program loan, the Government will \ncause MOFT to set up a steering committee, designate the minister of state for \nfinance as a chairperson, and appoint a secretary of the steering committee in \nconsultation with ADB as the program director;  \n \n(vi)  Within 2 months of the effective date of the program loan, MOFT will ensure that \nthe first meeting of the steering committee is convened;  \n \n(vii)  The  Government  will  use  its  best  efforts  to  reduce  staff  turnover  in  MOFT \n(Budget,  Economic  Affairs  and  Policy,  External  Resources  Management, \nTreasury and Public Accounts, Finance and Treasury Management, and Public \nEnterprise Monitoring and Evaluation), DIR, MMA, and Invest Maldives;  \n \n(viii)  Within 4 months of the effective date of the program loan, the Government will \ncause MOFT to establish a program performance monitoring system acceptable \nto ADB;  \n \n(ix)  The Government will cause the apex PMU to monitor program progress as part \nof its broader development management process related to implementation of \nexternally assisted projects; and \n \n(x)  The Government will undertake mitigation measures to ensure good governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency  consistent  with  the  findings  of  governance \nassessment carried out by ADB under its Second Governance and Anticorruption \nAction Plan.  \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n \n88.

The Maldives pursued an expansionary fiscal policy after the tsunami in 2004. The \nGovernment included large reconstruction outlays in the budget, but also pushed up current \nspending, both to raise public sector wages and to maintain subsidies in Mal\u00e9\u2014especially for \npower generated by oil-fired generating plants. Total expenditure jumped to about 60% of gross \ndomestic product (GDP) in 2008 from 40% in 2004. Revenue increased with the help of tsunami \nreconstruction grants and import growth, but not enough to cover the expenditure. The fiscal \ndeficit escalated to 13% of GDP in 2008 from below 5% in 2004. \n  \n2.  Structural constraints have weakened macroeconomic fundamentals, resulting in both \ndomestic and external imbalances. The large fiscal deficit exerted significant pressure on the \nbalance of payments. The economy is particularly vulnerable to the global slowdown as tourism \naccounts for more than a quarter of GDP and has significant knock-on effects on aggregate \ndemand in the economy.  \n \n3.  In 2008, the Maldives faced revenue and foreign exchange shortfalls and as a result two \nplanned major infrastructure projects totaling $190 million were not awarded. The Government \nwanted to fill the revenue gap by tendering leases for new resorts on 30 islands, as well as by a \n20% reduction in budgeted expenditure for the last few months of 2008. However, it did not \nproceed with the tenders and instead found alternative revenue from bilateral and commercial \nexternal sources.  \n \n4.  The new government elected in November 2008 revised the 2009 budget in May 2009 to \nreflect its political manifesto. The revised budget is a first attempt to rationalize expenditure \nwithin the constrained resources available and to decrease expenditure. However, it is not \ncertain whether the measures in the revised budget will take effect in 2009. Faced with a \nrevenue shortfall, the Government may need to decrease expenditure further to avoid a large \nfiscal deficit. Export-Import Bank of India will provide a loan facility of $300 million, of which $50 \nmillion will be included to the government budget. This will give temporary financial relief. \n \nTable A2.1: Summary of Government Finance \n(% of GDP) \nItem  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008 \nTotal Revenue and Grants  33.0  33.1  34.8  34.5  48.1  52.5  56.1  48.1 \n Current Revenue  30.0  31.4  33.1  33.5  39.1  44.7  48.1  44.4 \n Capital Revenue  0.2  0.1  0.3  0.2  0.4  0.4  0.3  0.3 \n Grants  2.8  1.6  1.4  0.7  8.6  7.4  7.7  3.5 \nExpenditure and Net Lending  37.7  38.0  38.2  36.0  59.0  59.3  60.8  60.7 \n Current Expenditure  25.8  25.7  26.5  28.1  48.4  47.9  48.6  49.2 \n Capital Expenditure  12.3  12.5  13.6  10.0  11.8  12.4  13.1  12.5 \n Net Lending  (0.3)  (0.2)  (1.8)  (2.0)  (1.2)  (1.0)  (0.9)  (1.1) \nOverall Balance  (4.7)  (4.9)  (3.4)  (1.6)  (10.9)  (6.8)  (4.7)  (12.6) \n Foreign Financing  1.9  4.5  4.7  4.1  2.4  4.5  4.6  3.8 \n Domestic Financing  2.8  0.4  (1.3)  (2.5)  8.4  2.3  0.1  8.8 \nTotal Debt (end of period)  43.5  47.0  46.1  43.1  52.6  50.9  51.7  53.9 \n Foreign  23.9  26.9  29.6  30.5  34.0  32.4  32.7  31.2 \n Domestic  19.5  20.2  16.5  12.6  18.7  18.5  19.0  22.7 \n( ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: Maldives Monetary Authority. \n ", "30  Appendix 2 \nB.  Structure of Revenue and Expenditure \n5.  The Maldives' public finances depend on a narrow revenue base. Tax revenue, which \naccounts for about half of domestic revenue, is concentrated on import duties and tourism tax. \nTourists are subject to an $8 per-person per-night tourism tax. This is collected by the tourist \nresorts and has given resorts an incentive to focus on high-end market. Rent from leasing \nresorts and dividends from state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are the principal sources of nontax \nrevenue. SOEs are engaged in a wide range of economic activities, including utility services \nsuch as water and power, transport, communications, trading, construction, and finance.  \n \nTable A2.2: Current Revenue \n2007    2008 \nItem  Rf million  (%)    Rf million  (%) \nTax Revenue  2,905.1 44.8 3,392.9  47.4 \n Import Duty  2,086.5 32.1 2,459.9  34.4 \n Tourism Tax  547.3 8.4 588.7  8.2 \n Bank Profit Tax  169.0 2.6 240.8  3.4 \n Others  102.3 1.6 103.5  1.4 \nNontax Revenue  3,585.6 55.2 3,766.3  52.6 \n Net Sales of SOEs  788.5 12.1 1,135.4  15.9 \n Resort Lease Rent  1,668.7 25.7 1,513.6  21.1 \n Others  17.4   15.6 \nCurrent Revenue  6,490.7 100.0 7,159.2  100.0 \nSOE = state-owned enterprise. \nNote: 2008 data are based on the revised estimate.

Since  2005,  higher  public sector  wages  and  power  subsidies  in  Mal\u00e9  and  tsunami \nreconstruction outlays pushed up fiscal expenditures.

As fiscal balance has deteriorated since 2005, outstanding public debt increased to over \n50%  of  GDP.  The  recent  increase  was  driven  mainly  by  domestic  debt:  about  60%  of \noutstanding public debt is denominated in foreign currency.  \n \n8.  An  assessment  by  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  concluded  that  the \nsustainability of the public debt depends largely on the strength of adjustment efforts, including \na  significant  fiscal  retrenchment  and  possible  arrangements  with  international  financial \ninstitutions.

Impact on External Sector Imbalances  \n9.  As the economy is driven by the public sector (fiscal expenditure accounts for 67% of \nGDP in 2009), fiscal expansion has a substantial impact on aggregate demand and widens \nexternal imbalances. Imports for reconstruction and new resort development, a general demand \nincrease, and higher international commodity prices in 2008 have increased the trade deficit \nsubstantially. With only moderate growth in tourism receipts, the current account deficit widened \nsharply to 51.7% of GDP in 2008 from 15.8% in 2004. Although there were still large net inflows \ndriven by resources for resort development (other investment), the overall balance of payments \nmoved into deficit (a negative 5.4% of GDP) in 2008. As the global financial crisis deepens and \nthe capital inflow dries up, there will continue to be balance-of-payments risks. \n \nTable A2.3: Summary of Balance of Payments \n(% of GDP) \nItem  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008 \nCurrent Account  (9.8) (5.6) (4.5) (15.8) (36.4) (33.0)  (41.5) (51.7)\n Balance on Goods (net)  (39.5) (33.1) (37.9) (49.4) (65.9) (64.5)  (69.9) (70.7)\n Balance on Services (net)  40.9  (39.3) 45.0  (45.1) 14.6  35.0  36.0  28.2 \n Balance on Income (net)  (6.2) (5.5) (5.5) (4.5) (4.1) (4.5)  (6.4) (5.1)", "32  Appendix 2 \nItem  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008 \n Current Transfers (net)  (5.0) (6.2) (6.1) (6.9) 18.9  0.9  (1.3) (4.1)\nCapital Account  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0 \nFinancial Account  5.6  11.5  7.3  19.7  35.2  31.7  40.0  39.6 \n FDI (net)  2.0  1.9  1.9  1.9  1.3  1.5  1.4  1.2 \n Portfolio Investment (net)  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0 \n Other Investment (net)  3.7  9.6  5.4  17.8  33.9  30.2  40.5  38.4 \nNet Errors and Omissions  (0.8) 0.3  1.0  1.7  (1.1) 6.2  6.9  6.7 \nOverall Balance  (5.0) 6.3  3.8  5.7  (2.3) 4.9  7.3  (5.4)\n( ) = negative, FDI = foreign direct investment, GDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: Maldives Monetary Authority. \n \nE.

The  Government  is  committed  to \ndiversifying revenue away from import duties and has introduced legislation in the parliament for \n(i) levying a tourism goods and services tax (TGST) in lieu of existing fixed bed tax, (ii) business \nprofits tax, and (iii) increasing passenger services charge (airport tax) from $12 to $18.5 per \nticket. Further, in 2011, the Government plans to extend the TGST to non-tourism sectors of the \neconomy. Significant preparatory work needs to be undertaken at an early stage to introduce \nthe new taxes, especially the BPT. There is a concern that the country may not have the \ncapacity to introduce these within a relatively short period of time. \n \n11.  On the spending side, fiscal policy remains expansionary in 2009. It is unclear how fiscal \nconsolidation  will  be  achieved  against  a  backdrop  of  the  rather  ambitious  and  costly \ndevelopment agenda announced by the President. The MTFF needs to show a clear articulation \nof a power tariff adjustment mechanism, synchronized with international oil prices and the \ncomposition of the wage bill for the public sector.  \n \nTable A2.4: Medium-Term Fiscal Framework  \n(% of GDP) \nItem   2008  2009  2010  2011 \nTotal Revenue and Grants  48.1  59.6  51.5  48.5 \n Current Revenue  44.4  33.5  42.6  44.4 \n Capital Revenue  0.3  22.7  7.3  3.3 \n Grants  3.5  3.3  1.6  0.8 \nExpenditure and Net Lending  60.7  67.0  54.6  45.9 \n Current Expenditure  49.2  50.9  43.8  38.7 \n Capital Expenditure  12.5  16.2  10.8  7.4 \n Net Lending  (1.1)  0.0  (0.1)  (0.2) \nOverall Balance  (12.6)  (7.4)  (3.1)  2.6 \n Foreign Financing  3.8  8.9  0.9  (0.5) \n Domestic Financing  8.8  (1.5)  2.2  (2.2) \n( ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: MOFT. 2009.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \n1.  As noted in the country partnership strategy, while absolute poverty has significantly declined for the Maldives as a \nwhole, there are significant variations within the country. A significant percentage of the people living above the international \npoverty threshold may move in and out of poverty. Inequitable economic policies tend to hurt the poor disproportionately. \nFor example, excessive budget deficits that are monetized increase the inflation rate, which hurts the poor. By helping to \nstrengthen economic imbalances, expand the resource base, and return the country to its previous growth trajectory, the \nProgram will reduce the incidence of poverty and the vulnerabilities of a section of society.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                 Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n1. Key Issues  \nIn the Maldives, the main issue relates less to income poverty than to poverty of access and opportunity. With the potential \nfor public sector employment being limited and growth prospects focused on resorts\u2014typically shunned by the Maldivians \non cultural and religious grounds\u2014the key remains to manage the economy in an efficient and equitable manner to ensure \nequal treatment for all private sector participants. Doing so would open up more income opportunities, especially for the \nresidents of the atolls.  \n \nThe Program would enable the Government to restore equitable economic growth, expand the revenue base, align \nexpenditures with available resources, and thus reduce the current large fiscal imbalances. These measures, together with \nprudent management of the country's debt and the divestment of loss-making enterprises, would allow the Government to \neven out opportunities of access and undertake greater investments on health and education that would have a direct \nimpact on the lives of the poor. \n \n2. Design Features. The Program will contribute to poverty reduction. First, at the macro level, revenue enhancement, debt \nmanagement, expenditure rationalization initiatives, and better financial management will address the fiscal imbalance and \nreduce the economy\u2019s vulnerability to external shocks. Reducing the risk of macroeconomic instability will mitigate the \nlikelihood of disorderly adjustment and even financial crisis, which would affect the poor in particular. Second, greater \ntransparency and efficiency in resource allocation, achieved through reform of the budget process and adoption of a \nmedium-term approach to fiscal policy planning, will reduce leaks and free up resources that can be devoted to poverty-\nreducing investments in social infrastructure, including schools, clinics, water treatment plants, and to their operation and \nmaintenance. Third, better integration of the current and capital budget will increase the Government\u2019s capacity to use the \nnational budget more effectively as the principal instrument for translating its development priorities, including the pursuit of \nits national poverty alleviation strategy into concrete expenditure programs. Fourth, the Program will strengthen the project \nimplementation and monitoring capacity within key line ministries, leading to higher disbursement ratios, timely completion \nof projects, better service delivery and enhanced development effectiveness. Fifth, specific revenue augmenting initiatives \nsuch as the introduction of a tourism goods and services tax and business profit tax will increase the resource envelope of \nthe public sector, allowing for more resources to be used to finance poverty relief programs.  \n \nCapacity development initiatives under the TA loan will support the introduction of these reform initiatives, which will extend \nthe benefits of the Program beyond its completion date.   \n \nC. Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \nThe Program lays the ground for a sustainable and equitable economic growth trajectory. Currently, one sector\u2014tourism\u2014\ndrives the economy and the owners of these resources have a disproportionate share of national wealth and political power. \nBy correcting the policy framework, expanding the resource base, facilitating the divestment of loss-making state-owned \nenterprises,  and  aligning  expenditures  with  revenues  the  Program  would  lift  a  heavy  indirect  burden  of  economic \nmismanagement and benign neglect of structural issues affecting the country. \n \nThe Program will protect vulnerable groups from any adverse effects. For example, under the Program, power tariffs in Mal\u00e9 \nwill  increase progressively to reflect the generation and distribution costs. However, this will be \"means-tested\" to minimize \nthe economic burden on the poor since their power consumption will be below the minimum defined consumption. Similarly, \nthe business profits tax will not be applicable to people earning small incomes. It will be a progressive tax which will \nincrease with income. The Government will use some of the revenues to provide a stipend of Rf2,000 a month to people \n ", "Appendix 5  49 \nwho are 58 years of age or more. \n \nThese policy reforms will enable the Government to increase expenditures on health, education, sanitation, water supply, \nand immunization. There is a strong correlation between expenditure on social sectors and the achievement of nonincome \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). As the reforms will help to alleviate structural constraints, and create more \nopportunities in the private sector, the reforms will also help in the achievement of the income MDGs. In summary, the \nopportunity cost of not undertaking the economic reforms far outweighs any transitional costs.  \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nDespite the tsunami and the subsequent economic downturn, there is practically no abject poverty or severe malnutrition in \nthe Maldives. Over 1997\u20132004 in Mal\u00e9, the lower-income classes managed to roughly double their incomes while the upper \nincome classes saw their incomes rise more slowly. A similar pattern can be observed in the atolls, where the lower-income \nclasses increased their incomes by about half while the upper-income classes did so by only about one-third. However, \ndespite progress in poverty reduction, the population continues to exhibit a high degree of vulnerability. There is a great \ndegree of transient income poverty, with individuals moving in and out of poverty. Over the period of three poverty and \nvulnerability surveys, only 7% of the original 44% poor remained so throughout and only two out of three nonpoor in 1997 \nremained so throughout the period to 2004. Taken together, this means that during the period 1997\u20132005 more than half of \nthe island population moved between poverty classes at least once. The poorest households tend to be those in which \nfewer household members are employed and which do not receive remittances from family members working in resorts or in \nMal\u00e9. \n \nThe  Program  aims  to  strengthen  macroeconomic  management  by  reducing  fiscal  imbalances,  curtailing  frivolous \nexpenditures, and diversifying the revenue base. Sustained and equitable growth will strengthen the income and opportunity \nprofile of the group that experiences transient poverty. A stable macroeconomic structure will enable the Government to \nincrease its social sector expenditures, including those on tertiary education.  \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.

Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues. Maldivian women are the most emancipated in South Asia and there is no discrepancy in public and \nprivate employment on account of gender. As noted in the country gender assessment, Maldivian women, because of \nculture and religion, do not opt to work in the resorts, which limits their employment opportunities. However, the Program \naims to strengthen macroeconomic management, which, among other benefits, will improve access to incomes and \nopportunities for women.

Introduction \n \n1.  An assessment of good governance and anticorruption activities was carried out in \nconformity  with  the  recommendations  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Second \nGovernance and Anticorruption Action Plan (GACAP II),1  which specifies that program and or \nproject designs should incorporate the findings of governance, institutional and corruption risk \nassessments, and that project documentation \u201cclearly identifies risk and risk management and \nmitigation measures.\u201d  \n \nB.  General Background \n \n2.  In 2008, the first democratic elections in the Maldives led to a change in government \nafter 30 years. This had been preceded by the finalization of a new constitution, and in late \n2008,  there  was  unanimous  passage  of  the  Maldives  Media  Council  Act  to  create  an \nindependent institution to aid press freedom. \n \n  1.  Public Management \n3.  Institutional changes following the promulgation of the new Constitution have included \nthe  establishment  of  an  Anticorruption  Commission, 2 replacing  the  largely  ineffectual \nAnticorruption Board, and the establishment of a number of commissions, including those on \nelections, judicial service, civil service, and human rights. A Supreme Court has also been \nestablished. There have been some initial difficulties in these new institutions but reforms in \npublic management appear to be on track. Politicization of the bureaucracy remains a risk (e.g., \nin the transfers and appointments of atoll chiefs) and there is a general need to build capacity in \nthe institutions of public management. There has recently been a focus on decentralization, with \nthe country to be divided into regions. According to government plans, a state minister will be \nallocated to the regions. The costs of decentralization have not yet been completely calculated.  \n \n  2.  Privatization and Private Sector \n4.  While  the  government  has  talked  a  lot  about  privatization,  state-owned  enterprises \n(SOEs)  continue  to  play  a  large  part  in  the  economy,  primarily  in  banking,  transport, \ninternational shipping, communications, electricity, fisheries, and water. This has narrowed the \nscope for the private sector. SOEs have been shielding them from private competition and the \nGovernment has provided them with special benefits (such as below-market land rental rates \nand additional financial benefits). However, the new government plans to make substantial \nprogress in privatizing or closing of some SOEs. \n \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2006. Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan. Manila. \n2  In October 2008, the Government set up the country\u2019s first independent Anticorruption Commission to replace the \nAnticorruption Board, although four of five members are former members of the previous Anticorruption Board. In \nthat process, the Anticorruption Commission also became the first independent institution established under the \nnew Constitution, ratified in August 2008. The Anticorruption Commission was established according to the \nAnticorruption Act, 2008. More than 150 cases previously being investigated by the Anticorruption Board have now \nbeen transferred to the Anticorruption Commission. The Anticorruption Board was set up in 1991 but was not very \neffective as it had little independence and there was very little transparency in its work. The Anticorruption \nCommission\u2019s work is now being complemented by independent reports from the auditor general. For example, \nless than 2 days before the first round of polls in September 2008, the auditor general released an audit report on \nthe President's Office revealing Rf47.7 million ($3.7 million) in outstanding loans, which was vehemently opposed \nby the then President. \n ", "Appendix 8  55 \n  3.  Corruption \n5.  The Maldives\u2019 performance in the Transparency International index has been slipping. \nThe Maldives dropped 31 places to 115th in 2008 from 84th in 2007, with a score of 2.8. This is \nin large part due to weak accountability institutions, including the ineffectual Anticorruption \nBoard, which reported to the President directly and whose reports were not made publicly \navailable. Government accounts had not been audited for 27 years until 2008, when the new \nauditor general took an aggressive stand.  \n \n  4.  Public Procurement \n6.  Government procurement is very prone to corruption. The Maldives has a centralized \nprocurement system for all goods and services. The public contracting regime applies to all \nagencies across all sectors. The Tender Board procures all goods and services and runs all \ntenders on behalf of implementing agencies. These guidelines are specified in tender rules and \nregulations and financial manuals. They cover provisions relating to procurement procedures, \nqualification  of  bidders,  organization  of  procurement,  criteria  for  awarding  contracts,  and \ncontract formalities. The Government\u2019s procurement policy is aimed at promoting an open \npurchasing policy and getting value for money for the Government.  \n \n7.  The Tender Board, which is serviced by the Ministry of Finance and Treasury, has a \nhigh-powered membership including the auditor general and attorney general. Implementing \nministries such as the Ministry of Atolls Development (MOAD) and Ministry of Transportation \nand Communication (MTC) play a tightly defined and constrained role and must regularly report \nprogress on projects to the Tender Board. The system appears to be respected by companies \ntendering  for  projects  but  procedural  weaknesses  have  been  identified  that  may  lead  to \ncorruption.  There  is  no  evidence  of  an  evaluation  of  completed  projects  and  greater \ntransparency on tender progress and results is needed.  \n \nC.  Risks, Risk Severity, and Mitigation Measures \n \n8.  This section discusses risks within the context of the Government\u2019s own strategy for \neconomic and financial management. Since the identification, specification, and determination \nof severity of the risks are subject to different interpretations, the assessment has been shared \nwith the Government, and the analysis presented here reflects its views as well. \n \n1.  Underlying Assumptions \n \n9.  The main underlying assumptions that are made here are that (i) there is considerable \nconsensus  on  the  need  for  reforms  to  address  structural  problems  that  have  been  left \nunattended for some time, and that Government will stay the course in political and economic \nreforms; (ii) there is a dire need to set public finances on a sustainable path; and (iii) effective \ninstitution building in key institutions needs to proceed as currently planned.  \n \n2.  Summary Risk Matrix \n \n10.  The governance risk assessment for the Program and a review of the broad governance \ncontext in the Maldives yield the risk matrix in Table A8.1.3 \n \n                                                 \n3 This has been prepared in alignment with the implementation guidelines of GACAP II. \n ", "56  Appendix 8 \nTable A8.1: Summary Risk Matrix \n \nRelatively  Not mitigated over \nRisks  Likely  serious  Program period  Major riska \nPublic Financial Management \nBroader government policies (such as that on \nfunding population consolidation) may  X  X     \nconstrain economic management \nInordinate focus on revenue enhancement \nover expenditure containment and \nX  X  X  X \nGovernment's inability to enhance revenue \nbase through taxation \nInability of Government to deepen civil service \nX  X  X  X \nreforms (to trim the wage bill) \nLack of capacity in relevant government \ninstitutions to undertake public financial \nmanagement reforms, e.g., Macro Economic \nCoordination Committee  may not be able to \nX  X  X  X \nfulfill its functions effectively, or Ministry of \nFinance and Treasury may not being able to \nundertake scenario building and debt \nsustainability analysis \nWeak economic policy analysis and limited \nX  X     \ndata and reporting arrangements \nUnsustainable economic subsidies to state-\nX  X  X  X \nowned enterprises \nProcurement \nLegislative basis for procurement is out of \nX    X   \ndate  \nLow capacity of relevant institutions (such as \nthe Tender Board) to manage the  X  X  X  X \nprocurement process \nAudits of tender processes not rigorously \nX  X     \nfollowed through \nProcurement is not necessarily done as per \nX  X     \nrelevant plans \nCollusion in bidding  X  X  X  X \nAbsence of an administrative body \nindependent of the tendering process to  X  X  X  X \nprovide independent review \nCorruption \nOpportunities to speak out against corruption \nat the local level have improved but could be  X  X  X  X \nfurther strengthened \nCapability constraints in the new \nX  X  X  X \nAnticorruption Commission \nLow capacity in atolls and regional \nadministrations to deal with corruption and  X  X  X  X \ncases of malfeasance \nVestiges of political patronage that lead to \nX  X     \ninstances of misuse of public resources \na  According to the implementation guidelines, a major risk is one that is specified as being likely, relatively serious, and \nnot mitigated over the program period.

The assessment also recommends acquiring information during program \nimplementation on (i) activities undertaken and proposed to manage the governance risks; \n(ii) risks  that  are  seriously  undermining  the  development  and  implementation  of  Program \nreforms; (iii) the status of engagement of all related stakeholders in the Program, and the \nsharing of program information; and (iv) program output indicators that validate improvements in \npolicies, legislation, capacity development, and accountability.  \n ", "Appendix 9     59\nCOST OF ADJUSTMENT \n \n1.  Reducing recurrent expenditures is the key to reducing the macroeconomic imbalance \nand to aligning expenditures with revenues. The Government plans to enhance the revenue \nbase by introducing a number of new taxes. However, it will take time for these to generate \naccumulated revenues, so in the short to medium term, expenditure restraint is the only viable \nway to reduce fiscal imbalance. \n \n2.  Some 70%\u201375% of recurrent expenditure is currently consumed by the public sector \nwage bill. The Government intends to reduce the size of the civil service during 2009\u20132011. \nWhile the benefits of an efficient and leaner civil service will be felt in time, in the short to \nmedium term, the Government needs to have access to resources to finance the redundancy \npackage, retraining the workforce, and helping the redundant workforce to either start their own \nbusinesses, or to seek higher qualifications. Table A9.1 summarizes the major adjustment \ncosts. \n \nTable A9.1: Major Adjustment Costs  \nTotal  \nPolicy Reforms  2009  2010  2011  2009\u20132011 \nRedundancy package  12.5  15.0  12.5  40.0 \nTraining (TVET)  1.7  2.5  2.5  6.7 \nTVET (capital cost)  10.0      10.0 \nSME loans  10.0  15.0  15.0  40.0 \nHigher education   20.0  30.0  30.0  80.0 \nAccrued pension liability of the Government  25.0      25.0. \nInterest cost of converting $40 million circular debt  8.4      8.4 \nInterest cost of converting WMA to a 3-year bond issue  16.3      16.3 \nTotal        226.4 \nSMEs = small and medium-sized enterprises, TVET = technical, vocational, and educational training  \nSources: Asian Development Bank and the Government of the Maldives. \n \nTable A9.2: Civil Service Redundancy and Severance Package \n \nReduction in Civil Service  Severance Pay \n(no. of employees by end  Per Employee  Total Cost \nPolicy Reform  2011)  ($)   ($)  \n       \nCivil service redundancy package  8,000  5,000  40,000,000\nSources: Asian Development Bank and the Government of the Maldives. \n \nTable A9.3: Retraining / Alternative Income  \nReform Area  No. of Beneficiaries  Unit Cost  Total Cost \n($)  ($) \nTechnical and vocational training  5,600  1,200  6,720,000 \nSME loan   800  50,000  40,000,000 \nHigher education  1,600  50,000  80,000,000 \n    Subtotal  8,000    126,720,000 \nSME = small and medium-sized enterprises. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and the Government of the Maldives. \n \n3.  Other adjustment costs include the Government's assumption of the $40 million liability \nowed by State Electric Company Limited (STELCO) to the State Trading Organization (STO). \nHowever, it would be unrealistic to expect all of the major expenditure reforms to be carried out \nupfront, since the resources under the Program and those from the International Monetary Fund \n ", "60   Appendix 9 \n(IMF) will be disbursed in tranches. Further, new revenues will start to generate yields only after \n1\u20132 years. Therefore, the analysis assumes that, during the program period, the Government \nconverts the circular debt into a 3-year bond issue, which is held by STO and that STELCO \nreceives interest on this holding. The interest cost is included in the cost of adjustment. It is \nassumed that after 3 years, with economic recovery on a firm footing and additional revenues \ncoming in, the Government would be able to pay off the loan\u2014as a bullet loan. \n \n4.  With regard to reducing the dependence on ways and means advances to finance the \ndeficit, it is assumed that the outstanding balance of Rf1.6 billion will first be converted into a \nbond issue with commercial interest paid on it. During the program period, there is no net \naddition, and subsequently a new agreement is reached reducing the threshold, and paying off \nthe reduced amount. The Government would continue to pay the commercial rate even if a \nreduced threshold is agreed. \n \nTable A9.4: Indicative Program Adjustment Costs for the Economic Recovery Program \n($ million) \nOutputs and Areas for Support    Costs \n1.

Assistance for strengthening the privatization process  2.0 \n  Total  231.0 \nSMEs = small and medium-sized enterprises, TVET = technical and vocational education training, W&MA = \nways and means advances. \na At an annual coupon rate of 7%p.a.; STO buys these bonds and receives an annual interest payment.  It would \nbe unrealistic to ask the Government of the Maldives to pay-off the entire $40 million up-front in one go, when \nthe Program money is to be received in tranches. The assumption is that by the end of year 3, with revenues \nfrom new sources coming in, the Government can retire the bond issue. But at the very inception of the bond \nissue, STELCO gets cleared of its liability and can be privatized. \nSource: Asian Development Bank and Government of the Maldives estimates. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", " \n \n \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES (TA LOAN AND TA GRANT) \nADB Loan ADB Grant Total\nComponent 1 Component 2 Component 3 Component 4 Component 5\nItem ADB Gov't.
