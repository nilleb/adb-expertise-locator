In  particular, \nthe  government  seeks  to  increase  the  role  of  the  nonbank  finance  sector  and  deepen  the \nfinancial markets in Viet Nam to sustain the financing of productive investment.  Subprogram 2 \ncontinues and deepens the reforms begun under subprogram 1. It will support the development \nof a well-functioning money market and a deeper and more liquid capital market, and improve \nthe capacity of public and private institutions in the finance sector.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  development  problem.  The  government  aspires  to  reach  middle-income  country \nstatus,  with  a  per  capita  income  of  at  least  $3,000  and  significant  improvements  in  human \ndevelopment  and  poverty  reduction  by  2020.  However,  this  goal  is  being  challenged  as \nstructural  factors  impede  higher  economic  growth\u2014the  average  annual  growth  rate  fell  from \n7.8%  during  2004\u20132007  to  5.6%  in  2010\u20132014\u2014  over  the  medium  to  long  term.  In  particular, \nthe  finance  sector  is  shallow  and  does  not  support  the  efficient  intermediation  of  funds  into \nproductive investments. As the figure on the following page shows, Viet Nam\u2019s finance sector is \ndominated  by  bank  credit  much  more  than  those  of  its  regional  peers  Indonesia  and  the \nPhilippines, which is partly explained by state-owned commercial banks\u2019 lending to state-owned \nenterprises  (SOEs).  The  nonbank  finance  sector,  which  represents  an  alternative  source  of \nintermediation of corporate credit needs, remains in a nascent state of development. The money \nmarket  and  government  bond  market,  fundamental  building  blocks  of  a  capital  market,  are \nunderdeveloped.  3 The  corporate  bond  market  and  the  equities  market  are  also  among  the \nsmallest  and  least  developed  in  Southeast  Asia,  suggesting  a  capital  market  that  cannot  fully \nsupport  Viet  Nam\u2019s  longer-term  economic  growth  and  development.  Further,  the  finance \nsector\u2019s  nascent  state  of  development  means  that  policy  levers  necessary  to  maintain \nmacroeconomic stability are also limited generally to administrative measures and fiscal policy. \n \nDevelopment  constraints. The government has recognized these challenges and has \n4. \nidentified  a  set  of  key  problems  that  must  be  overcome  to  ensure  the  financial  sector  can \nprovide  increasing  levels  of  intermediation.  These  key  problems  are:  (i)  a  small  and  illiquid \nmoney  market,  (ii)  heightened  systemic  risk  and  a  shallow  bond  market,  and  (iii)  inadequate \nfinancial infrastructure and capacity.  \n \n5. \nThe  money market  is  small,  exhibits  limited  activity,  and is  defined  by  instruments  with \nvery  short tenors.  Heightened  credit  risk  in the  banking sector  and  a  lack of  transparency  has \n\n                                                \n1  The  programmatic  approach  and  subprogram  1  was  approved  in  2013.  See:  ADB.  2013.  Report  and \nRecommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  for  the  Programmatic  Approach  and  Policy-Based \nLoan (Subprogram 1) to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Financial Sector Deepening Program. Manila. \n\n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  A  well-functioning  money  market  enables  (i)  financial  institutions  to  match  short-term  assets  and  liabilities, \n(ii) security  dealers  to  finance  their  inventories  and  to  maintain  two-way  markets,  (iii)  corporations  to  manage \nworking capital needs, (iv) the central bank to conduct more effective monetary policy, and (v) the market to price \nfinancial instruments based on short-term benchmark rates. \n\n\f2 \n\nalso  fragmented  the  market.  This  situation  has  been  exacerbated  by  a  lack  of  standardized \nagreements, such as repurchase agreements, which serve to reduce risks. While recent reforms \nhave  increased  the  volume  of  interbank  lending,  more  needs  to  be  done  to  build  coordination \nacross  stakeholders,  including  the  government,  to  ensure  that  reliable,  market-driven,  short-\nterm benchmark interest rates are established and maintained.  \n \n\n \nLCY = local currency \nSource: AsianBondsOnline \n\n \n\n \n\n \nThe banking sector is weak. The government recognizes that the banking sector\u2019s high \n6. \nlevels  of  nonperforming loans (NPLs)  and  undercapitalization  serve as a fundamental  drag  on \ncapital market development and limit credit availability. The most recent International Monetary \nFund  Article  4  Consultation,  dated  October  2014,  estimated  aggregate  NPLs  in  the  banking \nindustry  at  just  over  4%  of  total  loans. 4  However,  private  sector  sources  routinely  publish \nestimates that are much higher.5 To date, reform of the banking sector has been constrained by \nits  poor  risk  controls,  weak  identification  of  problem  assets,  an  inability  to  dispose  of  problem \nassets  in  a  robust  and  timely  manner,  and  weaknesses  in  the  regulatory  regime  to  resolve \nproblem banks. \n \n7. \nThe  capital  market  is  shallow  and illiquid.  As  of 31  December  2014, the local  currency \nbond  market  amounted  to  only  22%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP),  well  below  the  overall \naverage  of  57.8%  for  emerging  East  Asia.  The  corporate  bond  market  remains  dormant.  The \ngovernment bond market typically provides a market-determined term structure of interest rates \nalong a variety of maturity points, forming a yield curve. This term structure, or yield curve, is an \nessential  building  block  without  which  a  corporate,  derivative,  and  structured  finance  market \ncould  not  develop.  In  Viet  Nam,  the  government  bond  market  is  concentrated  in  short-term \nmaturities of less than 3 years, and exhibits limited liquidity. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) has \nstrengthened  the  regulatory  environment  and  extended  tenors.  However,  more  needs  to  be \ndone to ensure that primary auctions of government bonds are preannounced and predictable. \nTrading  volume  must  be  increased  by  concentrating  the  government\u2019s  bond  issues  into  a \nbroader  but \ntenors. \ninclude \nFragmentation must be reduced and price transparency must be improved. \n \nParallel  reforms  will  be  necessary  to  ensure  supporting  financial  infrastructure  is \n8. \nconducive  to  market  development.  Upgrades  to  the  government  securities  settlement  system, \nwhich  is  currently  dependent  on  a  commercial  bank,  will  reduce  settlement  risk  and  increase \nmarket  confidence.  The  adoption  of  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  will  improve \n                                                \n4  Figures provided by the State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV). \n5  In 2013, Fitch Ratings estimated system aggregate NPLs at 15% of total loans, with an 80% loss rate that would \n\nlimited  set  of  standardized  maturities  which \n\nlonger-term \n\nreduce system aggregate tier 1 capital to 1% from the 10% reported by the SBV. \n\n\ftransparency,  increase  confidence  and  provide  much-needed  incentives  to  strengthen  risk \nmanagement. In  addition,  a  stronger  commitment to  capacity  development  will  make  sure that \nregulatory surveillance and oversight remain capable as the market matures. \n \nThe  government\u2019s  reform  agenda.  To  restore  higher  economic  growth  and  tackle \n9. \nlonger-term macroeconomic challenges to stability, the government recognizes that it needs to \npursue  reforms  to  allocate  its  high  national  savings\u201431.2%  of  GDP  in  2014\u2014more  efficiently \nand effectively toward productive investment. The recent Financial Sector Assessment Program \nhas  sharpened  the  government\u2019s  resolve  to  increase  financial  stability  as  a  necessary \nprecondition for capital market development.6 Efforts to reduce the large overhang of NPLs and \nto strengthen the banking system have gained momentum. As of the end of 2014, the Viet Nam \nAsset  Management  Company  (VAMC)  had  purchased  D123  trillion  of  NPLs  from  the  banking \nsubsector, although it\u2019s limited powers have resulted in minimal disposals. The government has \naccelerated  the  implementation  of  reforms  under  SEDS  and  initiated  SOE  restructuring  to \nreduce  the  dominance  of  inefficient  state  production  and  to  enhance  economic  growth. Within \nthis  framework,  the  government  remains  committed  to  finance  sector  development  since  it \nrepresents a key aspect of the reform agenda under the SEDS.7 The equity and corporate bond \nmarkets represent essential sources of financing for recapitalizing the banking system, and for \nequitized  SOEs.  Market-sourced \nfunding  also  provides  much-needed  discipline,  which \nencourages  competition,  efficiency,  and  governance.  Finally,  reforms  in  these  areas  will \nstrengthen the economy\u2019s resilience to shocks by mitigating risks posed by an overreliance on \nthe  bank-dominated  finance  sector,  strengthening  the  implementation  of  monetary  policy,  and \nimproving the overall allocation of resources within the economy. \n \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s contribution and lessons learned. In recognition of these \n10. \ninterrelationships,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  continuing  and  strengthening  its \n\u201cwhole of sector approach,\u201d which encompasses SOE reform, finance sector development, and \nan increase in the availability of credit. The second periodic financing request under the State-\nOwned Enterprises  Reform  and Corporate Governance  Facilitation Program  was approved  on \n16  December  2014. 8  This  request  provided  funding  support  to  three  SOEs\u2014Construction \nCorporation  No.  1  Company  Limited,  Song  Da Corporation,  and  Vietnam  National  Textile  and \nGarment  Corporation\u2014to  implement  a  comprehensive  package  of  corporate  and  financial \nreforms.  This  initiative  built  on  an  earlier  ADB  engagement  that  developed  an  enabling \nenvironment,  including  the  creation  of  a  centralized  government  institution  to  formulate, \ncoordinate, and lead the implementation of SOE reform. In addition, ADB has provided support \nto financial inclusion through subprogram 2 of the Microfinance Development Program approved \nby the ADB Board of Directors in December 2014.9  \n \n11. \nBroader finance sector development serves to boost the catalytic role that markets play \nin  economic  development.  ADB  has  provided  various  finance  sector  program  loans  and \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  support  since  1996,  which  helped  Viet  Nam  as  it  transitions  to  a \nmarket-based  financial  system.10 Initial  efforts  introduced  the  basic  concepts  and  systems  for \nbanking,  including  a  legal  framework,  negotiable  instruments,  and  secured  transactions.

Manila. \n10 ADB\u2019s Sector Program and Experience (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nADB  supported  the  introduction  of  competition  to  the  banking  industry  and  initiated  the \ndevelopment  of  the  nonbanking  sector  to  increase  market-based  financial  intermediation.  The \nnext  stage  focused  on  delivering  four  main  outputs:  increasing  market  liquidity  and  lowering \ntransaction  costs,  establishing  a  public  debt  management  office,  strengthening  investor  and \nconsumer  protection,  and  operationalizing  the  country\u2019s  Anti-Money-Laundering  Information \nCenter. These efforts were coordinated with and bolstered by other regional initiatives, such as \nthe Asian Bond Market Development Initiative and the Asian Capital Markets Forum.11 \n \nThese  engagements  provided  useful  lessons  that  were  incorporated  into  the  design  of \n12. \nthe  program.12 First,  finance  sector  development  is  recognized  as  hierarchical  and  requires \ncareful sequencing over a medium- to long-term gestation period. Key foundation reforms must \nbe  successfully  implemented  before  moving  on  to  more  complex  reforms.  Also,  ADB  and  the \ngovernment  now  emphasize  the  achievement  of  mutually  agreed  quantitative  performance \nindicators  and  tangible  results.  To  ensure  that  tangible  results  are  achieved,  ADB  and  the \ngovernment  jointly  identify  and  design  policy  measures  that  directly  contribute  to  the \nachievement of performance indicators. Prior programmatic approaches tended to focus on the \nmere  completion  of  policy  actions  which  were  often  based  on  purely  administrative \naccomplishments.  \n \n13. \nADB\u2019s  value  added  to  program  design  and  implementation.  Key  policy  reforms \nunder  subprogram  1  (footnote  1),  which  was  approved  on  6  December  2013,  include  the \nestablishment of formal coordination between the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) and MOF. This \ncoordination  effort,  e.g.,  the  establishment  of  the  Money  Market  Development Working  Group \n(MMDWG),  produced  the  money  market  development  master  plan  and  regulatory  framework, \nwhich  led to  the  emergence  of a more robust  money  market  under  subprogram  2.  In addition, \nMOF  finalized  the  bond  market  development  road  map,  a  key  pillar  of  the  program; \nstrengthened the legal framework governing the issuance and management of public debt; and \nincreased  the  transparency  of  public  debt  auctions.  Also,  the  government  began,  for  the  first \ntime, to concentrate public debt into select, longer-tenor benchmark securities. MOF established \na road map to adopt the International Financial Reporting Standards and launched an effort to \nestablish a policyholder protection fund, both of which are being completed under subprogram 2. \nFinally,  the  government  initiated  a  sustained  effort  to  introduce  corporate  governance  reforms \nby participation in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Corporate Governance \nscorecard, and established a comprehensive plan for capacity development. \n \n14. \nThe  reforms  implemented  under  subprogram  1  have  produced  tangible  results.  Viet \nNam\u2019s  total  local  currency  bonds  outstanding  grew  43.1%  year-on-year  to  reach  D866  trillion \n($38.0 billion) as of the end of December 2014. In fact, Viet Nam was the fastest-growing local \ncurrency  bond  market  in  emerging  East  Asia  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2014  (quarter-on-quarter \nand year-on-year). Policy reforms  also galvanized the money market, where average quarterly \ninterbank  lending  turnover  increased  from  the  2010  baseline  of  D1.2  trillion  to  D74.4 trillion  in \n2014.  Nonbank  financing  expanded  as  local  currency  bonds  increased  from  16%  of  GDP  in \n2010 to 22% in 2014 (2015 target: 25%)13 while total outstanding government bonds held by the \ncontractual  savings  industry  increased  from  11%  in  2010  to  14%  in  2014  (2015  target:  16%). \nThe  average  maturity  of  the  government  securities  portfolio  was  extended  by  the  continuing \nissuance of longer tenors.14 The stock market exhibits similarly promising trends\u2014its combined \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2010.

Manila. \n13 This target was an indicator for program impact in subprogram 1. \n14 The number of auctions of 10- and 15-year government bonds has more than doubled since 2013; the aggregate \nface amount of 10-year notes rose from D8 billion to D33 billion, and 15-year notes from D4 billion to D15 billion. \n\n\fcapitalization  increased  from  19%  of  GDP  in  2010  to  30%  as  of  2014  (2015  target:  35%). \nOverall market liquidity also improved. Government bond turnover increased from less than 1.0x \nin 2010  to 2.5x  in 2014,  while  the  aggregate  value  traded  across  the  Ha  Noi  Stock  Exchange \n(HNX) and Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange increased from D180 trillion in 2010 to D732 trillion in \n2014 (2015 target: +25%). \n \n15. \nADB has also provided direct support to the completion of reforms under subprogram 2. \nAn ADB-funded resident advisor utilized surveys, research notes, and policy recommendations \nto  develop  the  broad  stakeholder  consensus  necessary  to  drive  development  of  the  money \nmarket.  Building  on  this  consensus,  policy  dialogue  has  led  to  greater  coordination  between \nstakeholders  in  the  money  market,  which  has  further  increased  its  depth  and  activity.  ADB \nhelped  the  government  identify  reforms  to  the  legal  framework,  which  are  needed  to  reduce \noperational risk in the money market, and supported the development of a plan to transfer the \ncash  settlement  leg  of  government  securities  transactions  to  the  SBV.  Responding  to  recent \nrequests, policy advice was provided to VAMC regarding disposal of problem assets, and ADB \nsupported  MOF  in further  refining  and  implementing  the  bond market  development  road map. \nADB  is  supporting  ongoing  efforts  to  adopt  international  standards,  and  in  particular, \nInternational  Financial  Reporting  Standards.  Frequent  consultations  between  major  donors, \nincluding the Government of Canada and the World Bank, provide for consistency of advice and \na comprehensive reform program.15 \n \n16. \nPolicy-based loan and budget support. ADB will continue its programmatic support to \nincrease  the  role  of  the  nonbank  finance  sector  in  financing  productive  investment.  This \napproach  utilizes  policy-based  lending  in  conjunction  with  extensive  policy  dialogue  in \nrecognition of the long-term time horizon required for finance sector development and the need \nto sequence reforms. Subprogram 2 includes three primary outputs: (i) a well-functioning money \nmarket,  (ii)  a  deeper  and  more  liquid  capital  market,  and  (iii)  capacity  of  public  and  private \ninstitutions  in  the  finance  sector  improved.  In  addition,  subprogram  2  contains  significant \nadditional reforms, not originally contemplated in subprogram 1, which build a sound foundation \nto begin reducing systemic risk levels as well as the large stock of NPLs in the banking sector. \nDemonstrating  this  long-term  commitment  to  finance  sector  reforms,  the  government  has  also \nrequested  from  ADB  follow-on  programmatic  support  from  2017  to  2021,  which  will  combine \nfinance sector development with financial inclusion. \n \n17. \nEconomic  impact.  The  program\u2019s  expected  economic  impact  includes  cost  savings \narising  primarily  from  a reduction in the  cost  of  the  government\u2019s debt  thanks to a drop  in the \nrisk  premium.  Compliance  with  international  standards,  including  Basel  II  (para.  25),  will  yield \nfurther benefits. \n \nB. \n \n18. \nThe program is aligned with the SEDS and will increase the role of the nonbank finance \nsector  in  financing  economic  activities  by  deepening  the  financial  markets  in  Viet  Nam.  The \noutcome  remains  the  same\u2014strengthened  investor  confidence.  At  the  inception  of  the \nprogrammatic  approach  in  2013,  the  government  agreed  to  45 indicative  policy  actions  as  a \nbasis for subprogram 2. ADB confirmed that 38 of these indicative actions were accomplished.16  \nAt the request of the government, ADB agreed to sharpen the focus of subprogram 2, and future \nprograms,  by  concentrating  on  key  reforms.  Through  this  process,  33  indicative  actions  were \n                                                \n15 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16  Of  the  balance,  four  were  deferred  to  align  sequencing  and  are  covered  by  the  post  program  partnership \nframework, and three were dropped due to a lack or relevance, or because they were overtaken by other reforms.  \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nOutputs \n\ncombined  into  22  high-impact  policy  actions  and  three  new  policy  actions  were  added  to \nrecognize  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to  strengthen  the  banking  sector  and  thereby  reduce \nsystemic  risks.  Subprogram  2  now  contains  25  reform  actions  (9 triggers  representing \nmandatory high impact reforms and 16 milestones), which the government completed between \nSeptember 2013 and June 2015.17 Four completed actions were dropped from the program as \nno follow up actions would be required, and one was dropped because a lack of data prevents \nadditional reforms.   \n \nC. \n \n20. \nOutput  1:  A  well-functioning  money  market.  The  output  builds  on  accomplishments \nunder subprogram  1 to develop  a money market  by strengthening coordination  and  promoting \ntrading activity. To implement increasing complex reforms, the SBV and MOF now participate in \na formal interministerial coordination group.18 In addition, the SBV has restructured the activities \nand  responsibilities  of  the  MMDWG  to  better  align  the  mandates  of  the  members  and  the \nobjectives  of  the  MMDWG.  The  SBV  encouraged  greater  activity  in  the  short-term  money \nmarket through its liquidity management operations by regularly issuing SBV bills with tenors of \n28  days,  56  days,  91  days,  and  182  days.  This  activity  has  provided  provisional  short-term \nbenchmark  rates  at  30  days,  60  days,  90  days,  and  180  days.  In  addition,  SBV  encouraged \nincreased activity in the money market by strengthening bank prudential liquidity standards, as \nwell  as  expectations  of  risk  management  with  higher  penalties  for  noncompliance. 19  As \nnormalized \nincreased \ntransparency  by  introducing  real-time  trade  monitoring  and  post-trade  reporting  for  foreign \nexchange interbank transactions.20 Domestic interbank rates and volumes are now published on \nthe  SBV\u2019s  website,  subject  to  a  3-day  delay,  and  a  working  group  was  established  to  launch \nreal-time  trade  monitoring  and  reporting  for  domestic  interbank  transactions  modeled  on  the \nReuters platform utilized for the foreign exchange interbank market. \n \nOutput  2:  A  deeper  and  more  liquid  capital  market.  Output  2  builds  on  efforts  to \n21. \ndevelop  a  capital  market  by  introducing  new  measures  to  reduce  systemic  risk,  and  by \ncontinuing  reforms  to  develop  the  bond  market  and  improve  oversight  and  transparency.  In \nparticular, financial stability is a necessary precondition for capital market development (footnote \n5). A formal monitoring group was established to track and ensure the implementation of priority \nrecommendations  arising  from  the  recently  completed  Financial  Sector  Assessment  Program, \nsuch as reducing systemic credit risk and resolving NPLs. To accelerate the resolution of NPLs, \nthe  government  increased  VAMC\u2019s  capital  to  $100  million  equivalent.  Utilizing  recently \nrequested  access  to  development  partners,  including  ADB,  the  government  established  a \nfoundation for NPL resolution by authorizing VAMC to issue its own debt to purchase NPLs at \nmarket  value,  and  strengthened  its  NPL  resolution  powers  to  allow  asset  sales  without  the \nconsent of the borrower or originating bank. In parallel, the SBV increased capital in the banking \nsystem  by  progressively  adopting  the  Basel II  standards  for  large  domestic  banks.  The  SBV \nrequired implementation of the standardized approach by the end of 2015 and targeted adoption \nof the complex internal ratings-based foundation approach by the end of 2018. Concurrently, the \n\nliquidity  operations  resumed \n\nthe  banking \n\nthe  SBV \n\nindustry, \n\nin \n\n                                                \n17 Reconciliation  of  the  original  Subprogram  2  to  the  revised  Subprogram  2  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n18 The wider coordination group will now provide  a venue through which monetary policy can be better coordinated \n\nand short-term benchmarks can be set independently of the SBV\u2019s liquidity operations. \n\n19 These standards were modeled on Basel III. \n20 Participants use a standard trading platform for foreign exchange provided by Thomson Reuters Dealing. \n\n\fSBV  improved  the  identification  of  NPLs,  and  implemented  an  enhanced  problem  bank \nresolution regime backed by the revised bankruptcy law.21 \n \n22.   Continuing  reforms  begun  in  subprogram  1,  the  government  introduced  a  basic \nframework  to  accelerate  development  of  the  bond  market.  To  improve  the  operation  of  the \nprimary and secondary government debt market, MOF identified specific government bonds that \nwill  serve  as  short-term  and  long-term  benchmarks.  Within  this  framework,  MOF  was  able  to \nreduce fragmentation\u2014the total number of government bond issues declined from 270 in 2010 \nto 117 as of the end of 2014\u2014and extend the average maturity of the government debt portfolio \nby  continuing  the  regular  issuance  of  10-  and  15-year  tenors.  The  government  developed  a \nframework  to launch  a primary  dealer system composed  of \u201cbidding members\u201d,  identified their \nbasic rights and obligations, and established an annual review and ranking of the participants. \nTo  increase  transparency  and  price  discovery,  HNX  now  publishes  quarterly  and  annual  debt \nauction schedules on its website, and utilizes indicative prices to build a government bond yield \ncurve.  Complementary  reforms  were  also  enacted  to  strengthen the government\u2019s  supervisory \npowers  and  increase  transparency.  To  deepen  international  links  and  cooperation,  the  State \nSecurities Commission (SSC) became a signatory to the International Organization of Securities \nCommissions\u2019 Annex A. \n \n23. \nOutput  3:  Capacity  of  public  and  private  institutions  in  the  finance  sector \nimproved. Continuing from subprogram 1, the output strengthens financial market infrastructure \nand  institutional  capacity.  MOF  completed  a  draft  Law  on  Accounting  for  presentation  to  the \nNational  Assembly  which  will  progressively  align  the  Vietnamese  Accounting  Standards  with \nInternational Financial Reporting Standards, including the concept of market or \u201cfair\u201d value.22 To \nreduce  systemic  risk  in  the  securities  settlement  process,  MOF\u2014through  SSC,  the  Viet  Nam \nSecurities Depository, and the SBV\u2014established a steering committee and working group that \nwill transfer the cash settlement leg of government bond transactions from a commercial bank to \nthe SBV and develop a limited-purpose central clearing counterparty to support the introduction \nof  derivatives  trading.  In  accordance  with  the  Law  on  Insurance  Business,  MOF  established, \nfunded,  and  staffed  a  policyholder  protection  fund  and  instituted  a  supporting  governance \nframework.  Reforms  to  build  the  public  equity  markets  and  to  increase  trading  volumes  and \nefficiencies  continue.  SSC  completed  an  action  plan for  merging  HNX  and Ho  Chi  Minh  Stock \nExchange.23 MOF,  through  SSC,  published  corporate  governance  rankings  of  publicly  listed \ncompanies  by  group,  using  the  ASEAN  Corporate  Governance  Scorecard,  and  completed  a \ndraft  plan  to  establish  an  institute  of  directors  to  advocate  and  support  reforms  to  corporate \ngovernance.  Finally,  the  government  continued  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  line  institutions \nresponsible  for  finance  sector  development  and  supervision.  On  the  debt  side,  MOF  now \ncompletes  independent  assessments  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  debt  sustainability.  The  SBV  implemented \nits human resource development (training) plan, through which 4,789 participants completed a \nstructured regime of soft skills, general professional skills, and select advanced technical skills. \n \nD. \n \n24.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  equivalent  to  $100,000,000  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Fund to help finance the program. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  of  2%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and \nthereafter, and such other terms and conditions as are set forth in the draft loan agreement. The \n                                                \n21 By 25 April 2014, the SBV has directly acquired two failed commercial banks at a price of D0 per share, effectively \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\nextinguishing shareholder rights. \n\n22 This law is expected to be approved by the General Assembly in late 2015 or early 2016. \n23 The plan has been submitted to MOF and the Prime Minister for review and approval. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nloan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange cost (excluding local taxes and \nduties)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items \nand  imports  listed  in  the  negative  list  attached  to  the  loan  agreement.  The  proceeds  of  the \npolicy-based loan will be disbursed in accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.24  \n \n25.  \nIn  2015,  the  government  will  need  to  borrow  D171  trillion  to  cover  a  budget  deficit \ntargeted at 4.1% of GDP. In 2014, deficit financing was obtained from domestic sources (44%) \nand  external  sources  (56%),  of  which  some  84%  was  accounted  for  by  official  development \nassistance. Assuming a similar distribution, the government will borrow an estimated $3.8 billion \nthrough official development assistance to close the budget gap. The size of the loan primarily \nreflects the government financing needs, the strength of the reform program, and, secondarily, \nthe costs of implementation (para. 25).25 \n \nE. \n \n26. Subprogram 2 covers September 2013\u2013June 2015. The executing agency is the SBV; the \nimplementing  agencies  are  the  MOF,  SSC,  HNX,  and  SBV.  The  MMDWG  acts  as  a \ncoordination mechanism for the implementation of the money market development master plan. \nIn  addition,  subprogram  2  contains  measures  that  serve  to  broaden  coordination  of  capital \nmarket development between the SBV and the MOF, and across other government agencies. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \n27.   A  growing  body  of  empirical  research  produces a remarkably  consistent narrative\u2014the \nservices  provided  by  the  financial  system  exert  a  first-order  impact  on  long-run  economic \ngrowth.26 On a program-specific level, a program impact assessment was prepared to estimate \nthe potential benefits and costs of subprogram 2 using a cost\u2013benefit analysis framework.27 The \nnet benefits are expected to approximate $246 million. The benefits arise from economic gains \narising  primarily  from  an  assumed  20-basis-point  reduction  in the  risk  premium  on  Viet  Nam\u2019s \ngovernment  debt.  The  costs  of  subprogram  2  include  costs  to  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam \nassociated  with  issuing  debt  of  longer  tenors  ($3.2  million)  and  increasing  the  capital  of  the \nVAMC  ($75  million).  Costs  also  accrue  to  the  private  sector,  such  as  those  associated  with \nadopting  Basel  II  requirements  and  other  reporting  and  information  disclosure  requirements \nstemming from the reforms. \n \nB. \n \nThe  government  undertook  and  finalized  the  first  Public  Expenditure  Financial \n28. \nAccountability  assessment  in  July  2013.  It  confirmed  that  the  government  has  a  functioning \npublic financial management (PFM) system capable of efficiently collecting a substantial amount \nof  revenues  as  a  proportion  of  GDP.  Challenges  included  a  lack  of  alignment  between \ninvestment  plans  and  budgets.

Further,  the  government  is  pursuing  a  progressive  agenda  for \nreforms. 28 ADB  has  supported  these  efforts  since  2008  with  initiatives  to  improve  planning, \nstrengthen  PFM,  and  increase  legal  transparency  and  accessibility. 29  For  example,  the \ngovernment  adopted  several  legal  reforms,  including  the  Anti-Corruption  Law.  Under  the \nNational External Debt and Public Debt Strategy, 2011\u20132020, aggregate public debt information \nwas published for the first time.30 The National Assembly recently approved amendments to the \n2002  Budget  Law  to  deepen  the  implementation  of  the  medium-term  expenditure  framework \nand  performance-based  budgeting,  and  to  improve  budget  execution,  monitoring,  and \nimplementation. These revisions, expected to be ratified in 2015 and effective in 2017, will also \nenhance  budget  transparency  and  disclosure.  ADB  is  preparing  small-scale  TA  to  assist  the \ngovernment  in  implementing  components  of  the  new  budget  law.  Tax  management  and \ncustoms  modernization  reforms  are  under  way,  increasing  the  transparency  of  administrative \nprocedures  and  reducing  compliance  costs  for  taxpayers.  The  government\u2019s  SOE  reform \nprogram  also  helps  improve  PFM  through  its  divestment  and  equitization  program,  which  is \nbeing  supported  by  ADB.    ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained to the government and SBV. \n \nC. \n \nViet  Nam  has  achieved  remarkable  progress  in  reducing  poverty  during  1993\u20132008: \n29. \nGDP per capita rose by an average 6.1% annually and poverty fell 2.9 percentage points each \nyear  to  below  10%  by  2010.31 These reductions  are largely  attributable to sustained business-\nled  growth \ntargeted  poverty  reduction \ninterventions.  According  to  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  Viet  Nam  is  likely  to \nachieve  most  of  its  Millennium  Development  Goals  by  2015.  Recent  upgrades  to  Viet  Nam\u2019s \nmonitoring  systems  to  incorporate  current  expenditure  patterns  allow  for  improved  pro-poor \nspending  programs  in  future.  Returning  Viet  Nam  to  high  and  sustained  economic  growth,  a \nprimary  driver  in  poverty  reduction,  will  require  macroeconomic  stability  along  with  structural \nreforms, such as the restructuring of poorly performing SOEs, recapitalization and strengthening \nof the banking industry, and the development of a more efficient capital market. \n \n30.  Within the framework of the SEDS, the government has embarked on an ambitious goal \nof  restructuring  SOEs,  reducing  the  large  overhang  of  NPLs,  and  eliminating  bottlenecks  that \nimpede growth in the capital market. The Sector Road Map for the Strategic Development of the \nVietnamese  Capital  Market,  which is  part  of the SEDS,  serves as a master  plan for  long-term \ncapital market development. The program is aligned with the road map and aims to strengthen \nthe  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  frameworks  and  market  infrastructure  to  sustain  the \nfinancing  of  productive  investment.  The  government  has  requested  from  ADB  a  follow-on \nprogrammatic  approach  that  combines  finance  sector  development  and  financial  inclusion  to \nsupport greater coverage and usage of financial services by the poor.32 \n \n \n\nin  output  and  employment,  complemented  by \n\n                                                \n28 Public Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 ADB. 2008.

It is classified C in all safeguards categories. \n \nE. \n \n32. \nSubprogram 2 is exposed to high levels of broad national and macroeconomic risks, and \nrisks  associated  with  PFM  and  corruption.  High  inflation  and  fiscal  risk  have  their  roots  in \nstructural  issues,  while  structural  reform  itself  poses  high  fiscal  risks.  Risks  arising  from  PFM \ninclude  budget  weaknesses  and  lack  of  an  effective  audit  oversight.  Procurement  has  been \nhampered  by  decentralization,  capacity  constraints,  and  conflicts  of  interest.  Anticorruption \nmechanisms  are  not  yet  fully  effective.  Recent  improvements  in  macroeconomic  performance \nserve  to  mitigate  macroeconomic  risks,  as  detailed  in  a  recent  macroeconomic  and  debt \nsustainability assessment.33 Otherwise, ADB is coordinating with other development partners to \nmitigate  risks  and  is  providing  TA  to  improve  PFM.  ADB  is  also  engaging  the  government \nthrough  anticorruption  dialogue  and  will  evaluate  support  for  the  Construction  Sector \nTransparency  Initiative  to  bolster  anticorruption  efforts.  Overall,  program-specific  risks  are \nmedium and include a possible decline in political will to implement technically difficult reforms, \nprotracted or inadequate efforts to advance SOE reform and bank recapitalization, and a lack of \nfunding for capacity development. However, the government\u2019s explicit resolve to implement key \nreforms recommended in the Financial Sector Assessment Program, as well as the policy goals \nof  the  SEDS,  provide  evidence  of  its  increasing  commitment  to  reform.  Under  an  ongoing \nproject, ADB is supporting the government\u2019s priority efforts to reform SOEs, and to strengthen \nits  problem  bank  and  NPL  resolution  schemes.  Active  donor  support  and  provisional  plans  by \nADB  to  fund  capacity  development  provide  additional  risk  mitigation.
