An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was \nundertaken, and the summary IEE is in Appendix 11. \n \nThe  Project  comprises (i)  improvement  of  367  kilometers (km)  of \nto  Nakha, \nRoute  4  (the  project  road) \nconstruction  of  a  bridge  over  the  Mekong  River  on  the  project \nroad, and improvement of about 100 km of rural access roads in \nthe  project  area;  (ii)  procurement  of  equipment  for  use  in \noperating  and  facilitating  the  border  crossing  at  Kenthao,  now \nunder  construction,  and  for  enforcement  of  axle-load  controls  on \nthe  project \nfor  construction \nsupervision  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  as  well  as  detailed \ndesign for the rural access roads; (iv) maintenance of the national \nroad  network  by  providing \nroad \nmaintenance;  (v) \nfinancing \nconsulting services to continue the ongoing road safety assistance \nrisks  of \nprogram;  and \nHIV/AIDS/sexually \ninfections  (STIs)  and  human \ntrafficking that may develop during the improvement and operation \nof the project road.  \n \nPoor  basic  infrastructure  is  a  major  impediment  to  subregional \neconomic cooperation. Lao PDR is pivotal to the Greater Mekong \nSubregion  (GMS)  transport  corridors  linking  northern  Thailand, \nnorthern  Viet  Nam,  and  the  southern  provinces  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China. Improving routes that connect provinces in Lao \nPDR will enhance subregional connections between northern Lao \nPDR and surrounding countries, as well as economic growth and \npoverty reduction within Lao PDR.  \n \n\n(vi)  a  program \ntransmitted \n\nimprovement  of  road  safety  by \n\n(iii)  consulting  services \n\nfor  periodic \n\nfinancing \n\nreduce \n\nroad; \n\nthe \n\nto \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nLoan/Grant Amount  \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n\n(ii) \n\nthe \n\ncapitals \n\nThe Project will form part of the new Northeastern Corridor in the \nGMS spanning Nanning (in Guangxi, People\u2019s Republic of China)-\nHanoi-Thanh  Hoa-Bangkok,  which  was  identified  in  the  GMS \nTransport Sector Strategy Study (TSSS). The TSSS classified the \nProject  as  high  priority  based  on  its  improvement  of  linkages \nbetween northern Lao PDR and Thailand. The Project will provide \na  sealed  all-weather  road  to  connect  (i)  districts  in  central  and \nsouthern  Xaignabouri  Province, \nof \nLouangphrabang  and  Xaignabouri  provinces,  and  (iii)  the  border \ncrossing  with  Thailand  near  Kenthao with  the  GMS  corridors  that \nconverge  on  Louangphrabang.  These  connections  will  reduce \ntransport  costs  for  international  and  domestic  transport,  e.g.,  for \nagricultural exports from Lao PDR to Thailand.  \n \nThe  Project  will  facilitate  regional  cooperation  and  increased \neconomic  growth  in  the  GMS  by  improving  the  national  highway \nlinking  the  Louangphrabang  area  with  the  Lao  PDR-Thailand \nborder.  Improvement  of  this  road,  much  of  which  currently  has  a \ngravel  and  earth  surface,  and  rural  access  roads  will  facilitate \nincreased  exports  to  Thailand  of  agricultural  goods  produced  in \nto \nthe  project  area  and \nLouangphrabang.  The  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  increased \ntrade and economic growth in the project area and the region. The \noutcome  will  be  more  efficient  transport  on  the  regional  and \nnational road networks. \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $88.5  million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $5.6 million. \n \n\nfrom  Thailand \n\nincreased \n\ntourism \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nOPEC Fund for International \nDevelopment \nGovernment of Australia \nGovernment of the  \nRepublic of Korea  \nGovernment of Lao PDR \n\nTotal \n27.0 \n11.0 \n\n14.5 \n \n22.4 \n13.6 \n88.5 \n\n% \n30.5\n12.4\n\n16.4\n\n25.3\n15.4\n100.0\n\nTotal\n\nLao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \n\n \n \nThe Government has requested a grant of $27.0 million from the \nSpecial  Funds  resources  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nto help finance a portion of the project costs. The Government is \nalso  seeking  loans  from  the  OPEC  Fund  for  International \nDevelopment (OFID) in the amount of $11.0 million equivalent and \nfrom  the  Republic  of  Korea  for  $22.4  million  equivalent,  and  a \ngrant  from  the  Government  of  Australia  in  the  amount  of  $14.5 \nmillion  equivalent.

DOR  has  extensive  experience  in \nimplementing \nprojects.  The  Project \nfunded \nManagement Division of DOR, which is responsible for managing \nall  DOR  projects,  will  carry  out  the  functions  of  a  project \nmanagement  unit.  No  separate  project  management  unit  will  be \nestablished. DOR will appoint a full-time project manager, who will \nbe responsible for the day-to-day management of the Project. The \nproject  manager  will  be  supported  by  a  full-time  deputy  project \nmanager,  who  will  be  appointed  from  the  Xaignabouri  Province \nProvincial Department of Communications, Transport, Posts, and \nthe \nConstruction.

Procurement of civil works under the component funded \nby the Republic of Korea will be subject to Government of Korea \nprocedures. Civil works along the project road have been initially \npackaged  into  five  contracts.  The  civil  works  contracts  along  the \nproject  road  that  will  be  financed  by  ADB,  OFID,  and  the \nGovernment  of  Australia  will  be  procured  using  international \ncompetitive bidding (ICB) with prequalification and will be subject \nto  prior  review.  The  ICB  contracts  will  include  the  detailed \nengineering  design  and  construction  of  the  works.  Smaller  civil \nworks  contracts \nfor  rural  access  roads  and  periodic  road \nmaintenance  subprojects  partly  or  wholly  financed  by  ADB  and \ncosting  up  to  $1  million,  may  follow  national  competitive  bidding \n(NCB) procedures and will be subject to post review. Other supply \ncontracts  that  are  not  expected  to  exceed  $100,000  in  value  will \nbe  procured  through  shopping  or  direct  contracting.  Approval  for \nadvance contracting action for procurement of civil works, goods, \nand  services  has  been  approved.  Relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be included \nin all bidding documents and contracts.  \n \n \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nConsulting Services \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\nactions \n\nspecific \n\nindigenous \n\nFor the ADB-financed or administered components of the Project, \nthe  Government  will  engage  an  international  consulting  firm \nsupported  by  national  consultants  for  construction  supervision; \nquality  assurance;  environmental  supervision  and  management; \nupdating, implementation, and monitoring of the resettlement plan \n(including \nand \npeoples\u2019 \nimplementation  and  monitoring  of  gender  strategy);  HIV/AIDS \nawareness  and  prevention  of  human \ntrafficking  program \ntrafficking  program);  and  project \n(HIV/AIDS  and  human \nperformance monitoring. It is envisaged that 97 person-months of \ninternational  consultants  and  2,376  person-months  of  national \nconsultants  will  be  required.  International  consultants  for  the \nProject will be recruited using the quality and cost-based selection \nmethod  and  a  full  technical  proposal  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from \ntime  to  time).  Under  the  components  funded  by  the  Republic  of \nKorea, a single package of consulting services will be engaged for \ndetailed  design  and  construction  supervision.  An  international \nconsulting  firm  will  be  engaged  through  a  separate  contract  for \nconsulting services for the road safety component using the single \nsource  selection  method  and  a  biodata  technical  proposal.  It  is \nenvisaged that about 9 person-months of international consultants \nand  9  person-months  of  national  consultants  will  be  required. \nConsulting  services  for  the  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking \nprogram will be included in the terms of reference for the project \nimplementation  consultants.  This  will  strengthen  the  institutional \ncapacity  of  the  Provincial  Committee  for  Control  of  AIDS,  District \nCommittees for Control of AIDS, and the Lao Women's Union; and \nimplementation,  and \nassist \nmonitoring of the HIV/AIDS and human trafficking program. \n \nProject  benefits  include  vehicle  operating  cost  (VOC)  savings, \ntime  savings,  diverted  traffic,  saving  from  improved  road  safety, \nand savings from reduced maintenance costs. An estimate of the \nProject\u2019s  economic  viability  was  prepared,  based  on  assessment \nof  the  direct  benefits  and  costs.  The  Project\u2019s  economic  internal \nrate  of  return  (EIRR)  is  estimated  at  16.6%.  The  Project  will \nprovide benefits to a population of about 311,000 people living in \nthe  districts  through  which  the  project  road  passes,  including \nabout  103,000  people  living  in  towns  and  villages  along  the \nalignment.

The  gender  strategy \nincludes  consultation  workshops  for  the  affected  households  to \nincrease  their  understanding  of  resettlement  issues  such  as \nentitlements,  compensation,  and  the  grievance  process.  The \nproject supervision consultants will include specialists to help the \nexecuting  agency  manage  resettlement,  environmental  impacts, \nand  ethnic  minority  specific  activities  and  ensure  that  ADB\u2019s \nsafeguard  policies  are  complied  with.  Upgrading  of  the  road  will \nincrease  the  mobility  of  goods  and  people  along  the  route  and \ncould increase risks of HIV/AIDS and STIs and human trafficking \nin  local  communities,  especially  among  women  and  children. \nThere  is  also  potential  for  increased  road  traffic  accidents.  To \nminimize  the  potential  risks  of  traffic  accidents,  HIV/AIDS  and \nhuman trafficking, the Project includes a road safety program and \nan HIV/AIDS and human trafficking program.  \n \n \n\n \n\n\fviii \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \ngrant  to  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  for  the  Northern  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion (GMS) Transport Network Improvement Project, (ii) proposed administration of a loan \nto  be  provided  by  the  OPEC  Fund  for  International  Development  (OFID),  and  (iii)  proposed \nadministration of a grant to be provided by the Government of Australia for the Project. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n2. \nEnhanced  subregional  economic  cooperation  requires  improved  connections  across \ncountries  and  between  centers  of  economic  activity.  Lao  PDR  is  pivotal  to  the  GMS  transport \ncorridors  linking  northern  Thailand,  northern  Viet  Nam,  and  the  southern  provinces  of  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Improving routes that connect provinces in Lao PDR to each \nother  and  to  borders  will  enhance  subregional  connections  between  northern  Lao  PDR  and \nsurrounding countries. The GMS Transport Sector Strategy Study (TSSS)1 identified the Project \nas a high priority transport project that will link northern Lao PDR with Thailand. The feasibility \nstudy  for  the  Project  was  prepared  through  an  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  technical \nassistance (TA).2 The design and monitoring framework for the Project is in Appendix 1. \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n3. \nTransport in Lao PDR is mostly by road, which carries about 70% of freight and 90% of \npassenger traffic. The main road transport network is fairly well-developed, except in the north \nwhere major gaps remain. The density of the road network is low, at about 0.14 kilometers (km) \nper  square  kilometer  (km2).  The  provincial  capital  of  Xaignabouri,  through  which  Route  4  (the \nproject road) passes, is one of the two provincial capitals (of 17 total) without paved road access \nto the national road network. Only 14% of the road network is paved, including about half of the \nprimary highways. The other roads have gravel or earth surfaces and most are barely passable \nduring the wet season. Traffic on the national and provincial roads is generally light throughout \nthe  country  because  of  population  densities  and  resulting  low  economic  activity.  Road \nmaintenance needs to be improved, and issues of road safety and the integration of social and \nenvironmental  concerns  need  to  be  addressed  further.  Ongoing  transport  policy  initiatives \naddress  the  following:  (i)  sustainability  of  the  transport  network,  (ii)  reduction  of  road  traffic \naccidents, and (iii) improvement of the capacity of road sector agencies to manage social and \nenvironmental impacts. The road subsector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n4. \nRoad  Maintenance.    As  with  most  developing  countries,  Lao  PDR  has  not  provided \nsufficient financing for road maintenance. To address this issue, the Government established a \nRoad  Maintenance  Fund  (RMF)  in  2001  to  provide  sustainable,  domestic  funding  for \nmaintenance  of  the  national  road  network,  and  eventually  all  roads.  At  present,  10%  of  RMF \nrevenues  is  allocated  to  the  local  road  network.  The  RMF  receives  income  from  domestic \nrevenue  sources  as  well  as  from  international  sources  such  as  the  World  Bank,  Swedish \nInternational  Development  Cooperation  Agency  (Sida),  and  ADB.  Domestic  revenue  sources \ninclude  levies  on  gasoline  and  diesel  fuel,  heavy  vehicle  surcharges,  tolls,  and  international \ntransit charges. Financial and capacity building support has been and continues to be given to \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2004.

Technical  Assistance  to  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  for  Preparing  the  Northern  GMS \n\nTransport Network Improvement Project. Manila.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nthe RMF under the ADB-funded Rural Access Roads Project3 and Roads for Rural Development \nProject;4 the  World  Bank-funded  Road  Maintenance  Projects  I  and  II;  and  the  Sida-financed \nLao-Swedish Road Sector Projects I, II, and III. The target is that 90% of funding for the national \nroad  network  will  be  sourced  from  domestic  funds  by  2014.  This  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s \nstrategy  for  the  Lao  PDR  road  sector  (para.  11),  which  addresses  a  number  of  sector  issues. \nThe World Bank program is helping the RMF develop systems to prepare strategic and annual \nmaintenance plans and to implement these plans. During the period encompassing fiscal years \n2005  through  2007,  domestic  sources  have  provided  KN245.6  billion  (62.1%  of  total  road \nmaintenance  financing).  The  World  Bank  has  provided  KN122.2  billion  (30.9%),  and  Sida  has \nprovided  KN27.8  billion  (7.0%).  Although  the  RMF  still  relies  on  international  sources  of \nfinancing, progress has been made in increasing income from domestic sources. RMF income \nfrom domestic sources has increased from KN10.2 billion in fiscal year 2002 to KN110.8 billion \nin fiscal year 2007 (planned). In 2006, the Government increased the fuel levy from KN100 per \nliter to KN200 per liter. Further increases will be needed to meet targets for domestic financing \nof  road  maintenance.  While  the  RMF  has  been  successful  in  improving  road  maintenance, \nadditional improvement is necessary\u2014particularly in the areas of developing road maintenance \nprograms  that  maximize  benefits,  improving  governance,  and  generating  additional  revenue.5 \nRMF  development  is  being  addressed  through changes  in government  regulations  and  policy, \nwith the substantial assistance of international donor agencies led by the World Bank. \n \nRoad Safety. Lao PDR has a poor road safety record. An ADB-financed study found that \n5. \ntraffic  accidents  cost  Lao  PDR  about  $47  million  per  year,  or  roughly  2.7%  of  gross  domestic \nproduct (GDP).6 The Government has recognized the need to improve road safety and reduce \naccidents  by  establishing  a  National  Road  Safety  Committee  chaired  by  the  deputy  prime \nminister  and  including  the  minister  of  communications,  transport,  posts,  and  construction;  the \nminister  for  public  security;  the  vice  ministers  for  public  health,  education  and  information  and \nculture;  and  the  director  general  of  the  Department  of  Transport  (DOT)  in  the  Ministry  of \nCommunications, Transport, Posts, and Construction (MCTPC). The Road Safety Strategy and \nAction Plan (April 2005) has been prepared, and there have been decreases in accident rates \nduring  2004  and  2005.  However,  it  is  expected  that  the  number  of  vehicles  will  increase  and \nroad safety will require more attention. With the level of transit traffic (especially heavily loaded \ntrucks)  increasing  under  the  GMS  agreements,  road  safety  awareness  and  enforcement  must \nbe  increased  to  ensure  that  vehicle  and  truck  drivers  from  other  countries  are  aware  of  traffic \nrules and safety procedures in Lao PDR. The ADB-funded Roads for Rural Development Project \n(footnote  4)  includes  a  component  that  is  currently  assisting  with  the  implementation  of  key \ncomponents of the National Road Safety Strategy.7 Under the ongoing project\u2019s work plan, the \nproject road will be included in its 2008\u20132010 program because it is a national road and a GMS \nroad\u2014both criteria for targeting resources to higher use and the thus higher risk roads. \n \n\n                                                 \n3   ADB.  2000.

In  the  northern  GMS,  sections  of  key  transport  corridors  have \nalready  been  developed  but  significant  gaps  remain.  There  is  a  need  to  improve  the \nconnections between the provincial centers and the northern region of Lao PDR and to improve \nconnections between Lao PDR and neighboring countries within the GMS. The overall objective \nof the ADB-financed GMS TSSS (footnote 1) is to establish a well-built, seamless, multi-modal \nsubregional transport network that will contribute significantly to fully \u201cconnecting\u201d the GMS. The \nstrategic  objectives  include  completing  the  transport  corridors  critical  to  linking  the  subregion \nand  promoting  trade  and  investment;  coordinating  strategies  to  ensure that  transport  corridors \nevolve  into  economic  corridors,  enabling  agricultural  diversification,  industrialization,  and  the \ncreation of employment opportunities; reducing nonphysical barriers to the movement of people, \ngoods,  and  services;  and  accelerating \nthe  required  \u201csoftware\u201d \nthe \narrangements, including expediting implementation of the Cross Border Transit Agreement. \n \n7. \nFuture  development  of  Lao  PDR\u2019s  economy  will  depend  on  expanding  and  upgrading \nconnections with its neighboring GMS countries8 to provide linkages that will enable transport of \nproduce  and  goods  to  local  and  international  markets.  The  Project  will  form  part  of  the  new \nGMS  Northeastern  Corridor  (encompassing  Nanning  in  Guangxi  Province,  PRC;  Hanoi  and \nThanh  Hoa  in  Viet  Nam;  Louangphrabang,  Lao  PDR;  and  Bangkok,  Thailand)  which  was \nidentified in the TSSS. The upgrading of the project road will connect (i) districts in central and \nsouthern Xaignabouri province, (ii) the provincial capitals of Louangphrabang and Xaignabouri \nwith a sealed all-weather road, and (iii) the border crossing with Thailand near Kenthao with the \nGMS  corridors  that  converge  on  Louangphrabang.  These  connections  will  reduce  transport \ncosts from the important agricultural areas in southern Xaignabouri to markets in Thailand. \n \n\nimplementation  of \n\n2. \n\nEconomic Growth and Poverty Reduction \n\n8. \nDespite considerable progress over three decades of independence, Lao PDR remains \none  of  the  poorest  countries  in  the  Asia  and  Pacific  region.  A  small  domestic  market,  the \nsubsistence  orientation  of  a  large  segment  of  the  rural  population,  skill  shortages,  and \nremoteness and isolation are among the key structural factors constraining growth and poverty \nreduction. Geographical isolation is a major cause of poverty in Lao PDR, as large segments of \nthe rural population have little access to markets, employment opportunities, or social services. \nThe Government considers road access to be one of the keys to eradicating poverty, and it is a \nmajor  focus  of  the  National  Growth  and  Poverty  Eradication  Strategy. 9 Substantial  external \nsupport has been devoted over the last 15 years to alleviating these problems by rehabilitating \nand modernizing the nation\u2019s transport infrastructure, but additional assistance is necessary to \nimprove the country\u2019s transport network (para. 3). \n \nThe  project  area  includes  seven  districts 10  of  Louangphrabang  and  Xaignabouri \n9. \nprovinces in northern Lao PDR, which is generally poorer than other regions of the country. The \ntotal  population  in  the  project  area  is  386,000\u2014of  whom  about  311,000  people  live  in  districts \nthrough  which  the  project  road  passes,  and  about  103,000  people  live  in  about  120  villages \n\n                                                 \n8  Cambodia, PRC, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n9  Lao PDR. 2004.

Xaignabouri district is designated by the Government as one of 47 priority \npoverty districts in Lao PDR. Another district (Xieng Hong) in Xaignabouri province, outside the \nproject area, is also one of the priority poverty districts. In addition, three other districts (Khop, \nHongsa, and Nguen) in the two provinces are among 25 districts classified as poor. Agriculture \nremains the key source of income and livelihood for most of the population. The districts in the \nproject area are aggressively addressing poverty eradication through agricultural development, \nwhile providing upgraded health care and access to education. The project area has access to \nThai markets via the project road. Export markets for agricultural goods produced in the project \narea are considerable\u2014e.g., the combined Chinese-Thai import demand for maize is estimated \nat 5\u20136 million tons per year, and the Thai demand for imported cattle at 2 million head per year. \nFarmers  in  the  project  area  are  responding,  and  shifting  from  slash  and  burn  agriculture  to \nintensified commercial production; their yields have increased to the point that they are roughly \ndouble the national average for crops such as maize.  \n\n10. \nPoverty  incidence  in  the  provinces  encompassing  the  project  area  has  declined \nsubstantially,  from  59%  in  1993  to  26%  in  2004  in  Louangphrabang  and  from  30%  in  1993  to \n21% in 2004 in Xaignabouri.11 The reduction of poverty in the project area is due in large part to \nincreased agricultural exports, which are dependent on the project districts\u2019 access to national \nroads,  even  if  they  are  not  all-weather  roads.  Given  the  available  markets  and  demonstrated \nwillingness to adopt new practices and technologies, there is great potential for further poverty \nreduction. The Project will facilitate the continuation and enhancement of the poverty reduction \ntrend. Upgrading the project road to an all-weather road providing year-round access will enable \nlower cost transport services and facilitate greater exports from the project area. The improved \nroad will encourage the development of tourism and other service industries in the project area \nby  providing  suitable  road  conditions  for  tourists  traveling  from  Thailand  to  Louangphrabang, \nwhich will reduce poverty further through job creation and economic diversification. \n\n3. \n\nGovernment and ADB Strategy \n\n11. \nThe  Project  is  fully  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  long-term  strategic  objectives  for  regional \ncooperation in the GMS and for Lao PDR, and with the Government\u2019s strategy. Under the GMS \nProgram, ADB is supporting the completion and expansion of strategic transport corridors (para. \n6). ADB\u2019s strategy for Lao PDR is to assist the Government to manage the road network as a \nvital  development  asset\u2014support  will  be  provided  to  the  Government  to  expand  access  and \nextend  the  economic  life  of  the  main  road  network  by  (i)  rehabilitating  selected  parts  of  the \nnetwork,  (ii)  reforming  sector  regulations  and  supporting  private  sector  investments  along  the \nGMS  road  corridors,  (iii)  assisting  in  securing  sustainable  maintenance  of  the  road  network \nthrough  the  RMF,  (iv)  building  capacity  to  strengthen  road  network  management  skills,  (v) \nsupporting improvement of rural transport infrastructure, and (vi) supporting the implementation \nof the National Road Safety Strategy and Action Plan. \n \n12. \nThe Government\u2019s long-term strategy is \u201cgrowth with equity\u201d to eradicate severe poverty \nand  graduate  from  the  status  of  a  least  developed  country  by  2020.  Reaching  this  ambitious \ngoal will require persistent high economic growth, averaging at least 7% per annum from 2005 \nto  2020.  In  turn,  this  will  require  that  industry  and  services\u2014both  of  which  are  transport-\nintensive\u2014grow  at  average  annual  rates  of  9\u201310%  per  annum.  The  Sixth  Five-Year  National \nSocio-Economic  Development  Plan  (2006\u20132010)  identifies  the  transport  sector  as  critical  to \nachieving  long-term  development  goals  because  transport  is  the  primary  vehicle  to  \u201cfully \n\n                                                 \n11  The  substantial  growth  in  the  tourism  industry  has  led  to  the  greater  decrease  in  poverty  incidence  in \n\nLouangphrabang relative to Xaignabouri. \n\n\f \n\n5\n\n \n\n \n\nintegrate the economy, thereby providing an enabling environment for trade and commerce and \naccess  for all  the  Lao  people  to  basic  services.\u201d 12   The  Government  has  a  multi-year  plan  for \npoverty-focused  transport  sector  development,  which  highlights  the  following  priorities:  (i) \nmaintenance  of  transport  facilities;  (ii)  investment  in  transport  infrastructure,  including  a  road \nsector  development  plan  to  2020  and  detailed  plans  for  air,  inland  water,  and  rail  transport \ninvestments;  (iii)  strengthening  of  the  regulatory  framework  and  capacity  of  ministry  and \nprovincial  or  local  agencies,  including  enforcement  of  a  transport  safety  strategy;  (iv)  private-\npublic  development,  including  contracting  out  transport  services;  and  (v)  transit  and  trade \nfacilitation,  including  improved  management  and  operational  efficiency  within  the  transport \nsector.  Themes  developed  under  the  Government\u2019s  Northern  Region  Development  Strategy \ninclude  connecting  provincial  centers  within  northern  Lao  PDR  and  improving  connections \nbetween the Lao PDR and neighboring GMS countries. \n \n\n4. \n\nLessons  \n\n13. \nThe project design incorporates lessons from ADB\u2019s loan and TA operations in general, \nADB\u2019s road subsector operations in Lao PDR, and other projects and TAs in the GMS. ADB has \nbeen a major financier of the main east-west and north-south economic corridors in Lao PDR, \nboth  of  which  are  based  on  road  links.  ADB-financed  projects  in  the  transport  sector  have \nsuccessfully contributed to providing access and communications, thereby helping to stimulate \nthe economy and reduce isolation. The 2006 country assistance program evaluation (CAPE) for \nLao  PDR13 found  that  ADB\u2019s  assistance  to  the  transport  sector  in  Lao  PDR  was  efficient  and \nhighly relevant, and had likely sustainability prospects and substantial institutional development \nand  other  effects.  The  CAPE  noted  that,  while  most  transport  projects  suffered  from  long \nimplementation  delays,  these  had  been  substantially  reduced  under  the  most  recently \ncompleted  road  improvement  project.  The  CAPE  recommended  that  future  transport  sector \nprojects  in  Lao  PDR  should  continue  to  support  road  maintenance  and  road  safety,  increase \ncommunity  participation,  and  strengthen  MCTPC\u2019s  capacity  and  awareness \nin  socio-\nenvironmental  management.  One  lesson  learned  from  ADB\u2019s  impact  evaluation  study  on  rural \nroads and poverty reduction14 is that the long-term benefits of road projects can be threatened \nby neglecting road maintenance. The Project is addressing the issue of implementation delays \nby  including  a  6-year  implementation  period  and  using  design-construct  contracts  for  the  civil \nworks packages financed in part or whole by ADB. The Project includes specific components to \naddress the road maintenance and road safety issues. Social and environmental concerns will \nbe addressed through the project supervision consultants working closely with MCTPC staff to \nbuild on the experience gained through completed and ongoing road sector TAs and loans. \n \n\n5. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n14. \nADB  has  been  a  major  contributor  to  development  of  the  road  sector  in  Lao  PDR  by \nproviding  12  loans  amounting  to  $336.7  million  and  TA  grants  totaling  about  $15  million \n(Appendix  3).  ADB\u2019s  assistance  to  the  sector  represents  about  35%  of  the  more  than  $750 \nmillion  of  assistance  by  multilateral  and  bilateral  organizations.  Most  of  the  external  financing \nhas been directed to national and provincial roads, as well as to bridges over the Mekong River. \nADB  has  provided  policy  and  planning  support  as  well  as  institutional  strengthening  to  the \n\n                                                 \n12 Government  of  Lao  PDR.

Improvement  of  this  road,  much  of  which  is  currently  gravel  and  earth,  will \nfacilitate  increased  exports  to  Thailand  of  agricultural  goods  produced  in  the  project  area  and \nincreased  tourism  from  Thailand  to  Louangphrabang  and  northern  Lao  PDR  generally.  The \nimpact of the Project will be increased trade and economic growth in the project area and the \nregion. The outcome will be more efficient transport on the regional and national road networks.  \n  \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n16. \n The Project comprises (i) improvement of 367 km of the project road from Xiang Ngeun \n(the  junction  with  National  Route  13  near  Louangphrabang)  to  Nakha  (on  the  border  with \nThailand), construction of a bridge over the Mekong River on the project road and improvement \nof about 100 km of rural access roads in the project area; (ii) procurement of equipment for use \nin  operating  and  facilitating  the  border  crossing  at  Kenthao  (now  under  construction)  and  for \nenforcement  of  axle-load  controls  on  the  project  road;  (iii)  consulting  services  for  construction \nsupervision and monitoring and evaluation as well as detailed design for the rural access roads; \n(iv)  maintenance  of  the  national  road  network  by  financing  periodic  road  maintenance \nsubprojects;  (v)  improvement  of  road  safety  by  financing  consulting  services  to  continue  the \nongoing  road  safety  assistance  program;  and  (vi)  a  program  to  reduce  the  risks  of  HIV/AIDS \nand  human  trafficking  that  may  develop  during  the  rehabilitation  and  operation  of  the  project \nroad.  \n \n17. \nThe project road will be improved to the national road standard with a typical 9 meter (m) \nwide  formation  in  flat  and  rolling  terrain,  7  m  in  mountainous  terrain,  and  10  m  in  urban  and \ndistrict  centers.  The  road  will  be  upgraded  from  its  existing  gravel  and  earth  pavement  to  a \npavement of double bituminous surface treatment with single bituminous surface treatment on \nthe shoulders. The southernmost section, which has less traffic than the remainder of the road, \nwill  be  upgraded  to  a  5.5  m  wide  single  bituminous  surface  treatment  or  double  bituminous \nsurface treatment pavement. Several bridges and culverts will be replaced or repaired under the \nProject,  and  drainage  works  will  be  undertaken.  The  Project  includes  improvement  of  about \n100 km of rural access roads feeding into the project road. These roads will typically be 5.5 m \nwide gravel roads, with single bituminous surface treatment in sections passing through villages \nto reduce the health effects of dust caused by traffic. \n \n\n                                                 \n15  ADB.  2000.

The proposed location is about 500 m downstream of the \nlocation of the existing ferry station. The total length of the approach roads and bridge is about \n1.7 km, including the 475 m bridge. \n \n19. \nThe  Project  will  also  finance  periodic  road  maintenance  subprojects,  to  be  identified \nusing the RMF\u2019s road maintenance management system and approved by ADB, in cooperation \nwith other international institutions providing assistance for road maintenance. \n \nC. \n\nADF IX Grant \n\n20. \nA working paper on Revising the Framework for Asian Development Fund Grants, which \nproposes revisions to the ADF grant framework, was discussed by the Board on 24 July 2007.  \nThe  policy  paper  on  the  revised  framework  will  be  considered  by  the  Board  around  26 \nSeptember 2007. The working paper provided that for countries eligible for grant assistance, the \nlevel of grants in the country program will be based on a country\u2019s debt-distress classification. \nFor  2007,  Lao  PDR  is  classified  as  a  country  with  high  risk  of  debt  distress  and  is  therefore \neligible to receive 100% grant assistance.   \n \nD. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nRural Access Roads \n\n21. \nThe Project will improve about 100 km of rural access roads in the project area to enable \nrural communities to maximize their benefits from the improved national road. Improved access \nto  Route  4  will  facilitate  (i)  transport  of  their  agricultural  produce  to  domestic  and  international \nmarkets,  and  (ii)  access  to  economic  opportunities  and  social  services  available  in  the  larger \ncommunities in the project area. MCTPC has identified about 15 rural access roads for potential \ninclusion  in  the  Project,  but  prioritization  and  selection  of  the  roads  will  only  be  done  during \nproject implementation. The access roads to be included in the Project will be selected on the \nbasis  of  agreed  criteria  including  the  number  of  people  expected  to  benefit,  poverty  level  of \nbeneficiaries, minimal amount of resettlement and environmental impact, and cost.  \n  \n\n2. \n\nRoad Safety Improvement Program \n\n22. \nThe  Project  includes  consulting  services  to  assist  the  DOT  of  MCTPC  in  implementing \nthe  Road  Safety  Strategy  and  Road  Safety  Action  Plan,  including  (i)  providing  training  on  the \nsafety audit policy and guidelines commenced under the ongoing Roads for Rural Development \nProject  (footnote  4)  to  all  provincial  Departments  of  Communications,  Transport,  Posts,  and \nConstruction  (DCTPCs)  and  ensuring  that  all  DCTPCs  have  the  capacity  to  administer  road \nsafety  audits  and  implement  the  results;  (ii)  assisting  DOT  to  coordinate  with  the  relevant \nprovincial DCTPCs in implementing road safety audits on all national roads and provincial roads \nwithin  their  provinces,  including  the  project  road;  (iii)  assisting  in  training  in  inspections  for \nvehicle roadworthiness and safety standards; (iv) arranging international training in road safety \nfor  staff  of  the  National  Road  Safety  Committee  Secretariat;  (v)  coordinating  with  international \nagencies involved in road safety in current and proposed road safety projects; and (vi) ensuring \nappropriate training is carried out in all the road safety initiatives. The terms of reference for the \nroad safety component are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nRoad Maintenance \n\n23. \nThe  Project  will  include  funding  for  periodic  road  maintenance  to  help  address  funding \ndeficits  for  road  maintenance  until  domestic  resources  can  finance  the  RMF  on  a  sustainable \nbasis.  The  financing  will  be  applied  to  periodic  maintenance  of  subprojects  identified  by  the \nRMF\u2019s  road  maintenance  management  system.  ADB  will  approve  contracts  based  on \nevaluations  prepared  using  standard  RMF  procedures,  in  accordance  with  procedures  being \nused  on  the  ongoing  ADB-financed  Roads  for  Rural  Development  Project  (footnote  4)  and  in \ncooperation with the ongoing World Bank-financed Road Maintenance Project (Phase II). \n \n\n4. \n\nHIV/AIDS Awareness and Prevention of Human Trafficking Program \n\nThe  Project  will  include  an  HIV/AIDS  awareness  and  prevention  of  human  trafficking \n24. \nprogram (HIV/AIDS and human trafficking program) in the construction camps, towns, hotspots, \nand rural areas of the project area. The program will be implemented by the Environmental and \nSocial Division of the Department of Roads (DOR), through the Provincial Committee for Control \nof  AIDS,  District  Committee  for  Control  of  AIDS,  and  the  Provincial  Lao  Women\u2019s  Union  as \nimplementing agencies. The program will be implemented throughout the project period. As part \nof  this  program,  the  implementing  agencies\u2019  institutional  capacity  for  effective  planning  and \nimplementation  of  the  program  will  be  strengthened.  National  consultants  will  be  recruited  to \ncarry  out  the  institutional  strengthening  and  to  monitor  the  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking \nprogram in the project districts. The awareness and prevention program includes: (i) advocacy \nactions  on  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking;  (ii)  information  and  education  campaigns  for  all \nethnic  groups  in  their  respective  sociocultural  context;  (iii)  provision  of  HIV/AIDS  and  sexually \ntransmitted infections (STIs) medical packages to clinics and medical centers along the project \nroad; (iv) developing community level contact people for community mobilization and awareness \non  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking,  and  community  monitoring;  (v)  mobilization  of  existing \npoverty  programs  on  agriculture  and  village  development  for  poor  households,  with  special \nfocus on targeting indigenous peoples\u2019 households to minimize their vulnerability and potential \nrisk  for  human  trafficking;  and  (vi)  developing  monitoring  indicators  on  HIV/AIDS  and  human \ntrafficking by gender and ethnicity. A detailed description of and the terms of reference for the \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking program are in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \nE. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n25. \n The  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $88.5  million,  including  taxes  and  duties \nestimated  at  $5.6  million  equivalent  (Table  1).  The  cost  estimates  are  based  on  quantities \nderived  from  preliminary  engineering  designs  and  market  prices  for  goods  and  materials,  and \ninclude  the  costs  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and  environmental  mitigation  and \nmonitoring.16 The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 4.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n16 Environmental  mitigation  and  monitoring  costs  are  estimated  at  about  $800,000  and  are  included  in  the  cost \n\nestimates for civil works and consulting services for construction supervision. \n\n\f \n\n9\n\n \n\n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nB. \nC. \n  \n\nBase Costb \n\n1. \n \n \n \n2. \n3. \n4. \n5. \n6. \n7. \n \n\nCivil Works \na.

The Government is also seeking loans \nfrom OFID in the amount of $11.0 million equivalent and from the Republic of Korea for $22.4 \nmillion equivalent, and a grant from the Government of Australia in the amount of $14.5 million \nequivalent. Cofinancing in the amounts specified above is included in co-financiers\u2019 programs, \nand formal approval is expected by early 2008. In the unlikely event that cofinancing does not \nmaterialize,  the  project  scope  could  be  reduced  and  financing  allocations  of  categories \nrearranged  accordingly,  and  the  Project  would  remain  viable.  The  OFID  and  Government  of \nAustralia financing will be provided as joint cofinancing.  Financing from the Republic of Korea \nwill be provided as parallel cofinancing, will be denominated in won (W), and will have a term of \n30  years  including  a  grace  period  of  10  years.  The  OFID  loan  and  Government  of  Australia \ngrant will be administered by ADB. The Government will provide counterpart financing of $13.6 \nmillion, including $5.6 million in taxes. The financing plan is shown in Table 2.  \n\n \n\n27. \nADB typically seeks approval from its Board of Directors for the administration of grant \nand/or loan funds from co-financiers only when cofinancing commitments are in place. Approval \nfor the proposed loan funding from OFID will be in March 2008 and for grant funding from the \nGovernment of Australia in September 2007. To facilitate project implementation, the Board is \nrequested to approve the administration of the proposed loan in an amount not exceeding the \nequivalent of $11 million from OFID and a grant in the amount not exceeding the equivalent of \n$14.5 million from the Government of Australia, which are expected to be confirmed subsequent \nto  the  date  of  Board  approval.  Approval  from  each  of  the  co-financiers  will  be  reported  to  the \nBoard in accordance with the standard reporting procedures. If either OFID or the Government \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\nof  Australia  does  not  approve  the  loan  and  grant  financing,  the  portions  that  they  are  due  to \nfinance  will  not  be  financed  under  the  Project.  Alternatively,  the  Government  may  make \nalternative arrangements, satisfactory to ADB, to cover the funding shortfall. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\n \n\n \nG. \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nOPEC Fund for International Development \nGovernment of Australia \nGovernment of Republic of Korea \nGovernment of Lao PDRa \n\na  Includes $5.6 million in taxes.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\nTotal \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\nTotal \n27.0 \n11.0 \n14.5 \n22.4 \n13.6 \n\n88.5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n% \n30.5 \n12.4 \n16.4 \n25.3 \n15.4 \n\n100.0 \n\n28.  MCTPC  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  and  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall \ntechnical supervision and execution of the Project. DOR will be the Implementing Agency and \nwill  be  responsible  for  the  direct  supervision  and  execution  of  the  Project.  The  Project \nManagement Division of DOR, which is responsible for managing all DOR projects, will carry out \nthe  functions  of  a  project  management  unit.  No  separate  project  management  unit  will  be \nestablished. DOR will appoint a full-time project manager, who will be responsible for the day-to-\nday  management  of  the  Project.  The  project  manager  will  be  supported  by  a  full-time  deputy \nproject  manager,  who  will  be  appointed  from  the  Xaignabouri  Province  DCTPC.  A  full-time \ndeputy project manager for the components financed by the Republic of Korea will be appointed \nfrom the Louangphrabang Province DCTPC. The project manager and deputy project manager \nwill  (i)  prepare  the  overall  project  implementation  plan;  (ii)  provide  overall  construction \nsupervision;  (iii)  carry  out  a  public  awareness  campaign  on  HIV/AIDS;  (iv)  monitor  and \nsupervise all project management activities; (v) carry out procurement together with the Project \nManagement Division; (vi) organize monitoring and evaluation activities; (vii) prepare necessary \nproject  progress  and  project  completion  reports  to  be  submitted  to  MCTPC  and  ADB;  and \n(viii) ensure  full  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  resettlement,  environment,  and  other  safeguards  and \npolicies.  The  project  manager  and  deputy  project  manager  will  receive  support  from  other \nMCTPC staff and the project implementation and monitoring consultants. The consultants\u2019 team \nleader will be the engineer for the civil works and will provide support to the project manager. \nADB has been working closely with MCTPC and DOR for several years on other road subsector \nprojects.  ADB  believes  that  MCTPC  and  DOR  have,  with  consultant  support,  the  capacity  to \nmanage  the  Project  effectively.  The  financial  management  assessment  of  MCTPC  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix C. The HIV/AIDS and human trafficking program will be implemented \nby  DOR\u2019s  Environmental  and  Social  Division  through  the  Provincial  Committee  for  Control  of \nAIDS,  District  Committees  for  Control  of  AIDS,  and  the  Lao  Women\u2019s  Union.  The  project \nimplementation  and  monitoring  consultants  will  help  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity  of \nthese agencies (para. 31). \n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n29. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  about  6  years,  including  pre-\nconstruction  activities, with  completion  by  the  end  of  2013.  The  implementation  schedule  is in \nAppendix 5. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nThe contract packages financed by the ADB and the Government of Australia grants and \n30. \nOFID  loan  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  Procurement  of  civil  works  under  the  component  funded  by  the \nRepublic  of  Korea  will  be  subject  to  Government  of  Korea  procedures.  Civil  works  along  the \nproject road have been initially packaged into five contracts. The bridge over the Mekong River \nwill  be  combined  with  a  road  package  to  be  funded  by  the  Republic  of  Korea.  The  civil  works \ncontracts that will be financed by ADB, OFID, and the Government of Australia will be procured \nusing  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  with  prequalification  and  will  be  subject  to  prior \nreview. The ICB contracts will include the detailed engineering design, and construction of the \nworks.  Smaller  civil  works  contracts  for  rural  access  roads  and  periodic  road  maintenance \nsubprojects partly or wholly financed by ADB and costing up to $1 million, may follow national \ncompetitive bidding (NCB) procedures and will be subject to post review. Other supply contracts \nthat are not expected to exceed $100,000 in value will be procured through shopping or direct \ncontracting.17 ADB  has  approved  the  Government\u2019s  request  for  advance  contracting  action  for \nprocurement  of  civil  works,  goods,  and  services.  Relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption \npolicy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in all bidding documents and contracts. The \nprocurement plan and details of proposed contract packages for the Project are in Appendix 6. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nsupervision \n\nsupervision; \n\nenvironmental \n\nand  management; \n\nFor  the  ADB-financed  or  administered  components  of  the  Project,  the  Government  will \n31. \nengage  an  international  consulting  firm  supported  by  national  consultants  for  design  review; \nconstruction \nupdating, \nimplementation, and monitoring of the resettlement plan (including indigenous peoples\u2019 specific \nactions,  and  implementation  and  monitoring  of  the  gender  strategy);  HIV/AIDS  and  human \ntrafficking program; and project performance monitoring. It is envisaged that 97 person-months \nof  international  consultants  and  2,376  person-months  of  national  consultants  will  be  required. \nInternational  consultants  for  the  Project  will  be  recruited  using  the  quality  and  cost-based \nselection method and a full technical proposal in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The Government was advised that, for the \nrecruitment of consultants, advance contracting is the normal procedure and that ADB\u2019s support \nof  advance  contracting  does  not  commit  ADB  to  approve  the  grant  project  or  to  finance  the \nrecruitment costs. The advance recruitment will not include signing of contracts. The draft terms \nof reference for the consulting services are in Supplementary Appendix D. Under the Republic \nof  Korea-funded  components,  a  single  package  of  consulting  services  will  be  engaged  for \ndetailed  design  and  construction  supervision.  Tasks  for  consultants  for  the  road  safety \ncomponent  represent  a  natural  continuation  of  services  being  provided  by  international \n\n                                                 \n17 Direct contracting will be used for vehicle weigh scales for purposes of standardization with scales already or being \nprocured under other ADB-funded projects including the Roads for Rural Development Project (footnote 4) and the \nNorthern  Economic  Corridor  Project  (ADB.  2002.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of \nDirectors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  and  Technical  Assistance  Grant  to  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  for  the \nGMS: Northern Economic Corridor Project.

To provide \ncontinuity  in  technical  approach,  this  international  consulting  firm18 will  be  engaged  through  a \nseparate  contract  for  consulting  services  for  the  road  safety  component  (para.  22)  using  the \nsingle  source  selection  method  and  a  biodata  technical  proposal.  It  is  envisaged  that  about  9 \nperson-months of international consultants and 9 person-months of national consultants will be \nrequired. Consulting services for the HIV/AIDS and human trafficking program will be included in \nthe  terms  of  reference  for  the  project  implementation  consultants  and  will  strengthen  the \ninstitutional  capacity  of  the  Provincial  Committee  for  Control  of  AIDS,  District  Committees  for \nControl  of  AIDS,  and  the  Lao  Women\u2019s  Union  and  assist  them  with  effective  planning, \nimplementation, and monitoring of the HIV/AIDS and human trafficking program. \n \n\n \n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n32. \nThe Government was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy and Policy relating to the \nCombating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism.  Consistent  with  its \ncommitment  to  good  governance,  accountability  and  transparency,  ADB  will  require  the \nGovernment  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls  following \ninternational  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging  in  such  activities.  The  legal  documentation  between  ADB  and  the  Government  will \nfurther  allow  ADB  to  investigate  any  violation  or  potential  violation  of  these  undertakings.  In \nparticular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions \nspecifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n33. \nThe  Project  incorporates  several  other  measures,  in  addition  to  the  standard  ADB \nrequirements, to deter corruption and increase transparency. The Project will (i) build the EA\u2019s \ncapacity  to  comply  with  ADB  and  government  procedures  as  outlined  in  the  project \nadministration  manual;  (ii)  establish  a  project  website  to  disclose  information  about  project \nimplementation;  and  (iii)  establish  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  to  ensure  greater \naccountability.  The  project  website  will  provide  updated,  detailed  information  on  project \nimplementation. For example, the website will include procurement-related information such as \nthe list of participating bidders, name of the winning bidder, basic details on bidding procedures \nadopted,  amount  of  contract  awarded,  and  the  list  of  goods/services  procured.  The  grievance \nredress mechanism will be set up to receive and resolve complaints and act upon stakeholders\u2019 \nreports of irregularities on project-related matters, including grievances concerning resettlement. \nThe  EA  will  widely  publicize  the  existence  of  this  mechanism  to  ensure  that  stakeholders  are \naware  that  there  is  a  venue  to  address  concerns  or  grievances  relating  to  fraud,  corruption, \nabuse, and any other aspects of project implementation. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n34. \nAll  disbursements  under  the  ADB  and  the  Government  of  Australia  grants,  and  OFID \nloan  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as \namended from time to time).  An imprest account will be established for the Project at the Bank \nof the Lao PDR. The initial advance to and the ceiling of the imprest account will be based on \nestimated expenditures for the first 6 months to be paid out of the imprest account or 10% of the \ntotal ADB grant amount, whichever is lower. The imprest account will be established, managed, \nreplenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and \n\n                                                 \n18 Swedish National Road Consulting AB (SweRoad). \n\n\f \n\n13\n\n \n\n \n\ndetailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  between  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  statement  of \nexpenditures procedure will be used to reimburse/liquidate eligible expenditures under contracts \nnot exceeding $50,000. Disbursement arrangements for the loan from the Republic of Korea will \nfollow Government of the Republic of Korea procedures. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n35. \n MCTPC  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  Project,  and  have  such  accounts  and \nrelated financial statements audited annually by an external auditor in accordance with auditing \nstandards acceptable to ADB. MCTPC will submit to ADB, within 6 months of the close of the \nfiscal  year,  certified  copies  of  audited  project  accounts  and  financial  statements  and  auditor's \nreports,  all  in  English.  The  audit  of such  financial  statements  will  include  (i)  an  assessment  of \nthe  adequacy  of  accounting  and  internal  control  systems  with  respect  to  project  expenditures \nand other financial transactions, (ii) an assessment of compliance with financial grant covenants \nand ADB requirements for project management, (iii) an opinion on the use of the statement of \nexpenditures procedure, and (iv) an opinion on the use of the imprest account.  \n \n36.  MCTPC  will  report  the  progress  of  project  implementation  by  submitting  quarterly \nprogress reports to ADB and the co-financiers. The form and content of the progress reports will \nbe  agreed  with  ADB  and  the  co-financiers  during  the  project  inception  mission.  MCTPC  will \nmonitor project implementation in accordance with the project implementation schedule, and will \nkeep ADB and the co-financiers informed of any significant deviations from the schedule. The \nquarterly  reports  will  include  summary  information  on  basic  data,  utilization  of  funds, \nachievement of immediate development objectives, compliance with covenants, implementation \nprogress, land acquisition, and resettlement progress, and major issues and problems. Within 3 \nmonths of the Project\u2019s physical completion, MCTPC will submit to ADB and the co-financiers a \nproject  completion  report  which  will  provide  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  project  design,  costs, \ncontractors\u2019 and consultants\u2019 performance, social and economic impact, economic internal rate \nof return (EIRR), and such other details as may be requested by ADB.  \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n37.  A set of indicators for evaluating project performance in relation to its impacts, outcomes, \noutputs,  and  conditions  will  be  agreed  to  by  MCTPC  and  ADB  during  inception  or  before \ncommencement  of  civil  works,  whichever  is  earlier.  The  baseline  data  will  be  collected \nimmediately  afterwards  but  not  later  than  9  months  after  the  effective  date,  and  will  include \namong others (i) economic development and socioeconomic indicators, (ii) transport costs and \ntimes,  (iii)  transport  charges,  (iv)  accident  rates,  (v)  international  and  total  traffic  levels,  (vi) \naffected persons\u2019 incomes, (vii) access to social services, (viii) jobs created in construction and \nmaintenance, (ix) incidence of STIs, and (x) incidence of human trafficking. At the beginning of \nproject implementation, MCTPC will establish baseline and target values for the indicators. The \nindicators  will  be  measured  and  compared  with  the  baseline  at  project  inception,  completion, \nand after 3 years. Where relevant, indicators will be disaggregated by gender and ethnicity. The \nproject implementation consultants will help establish the monitoring and evaluation system, and \ntrain  MCTPC  staff  in  its  use.  The  main  sources  of  data  will  include  (i)  secondary  data  from \ngovernment sources, (ii) a household socioeconomic sample survey, and (iii) participatory rapid \nappraisal.  MCTPC  will  submit  to  ADB  a  report  summarizing  the  key  findings  of  monitoring  at \ninception, completion, and 3 years after physical completion of the Project. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n38. \nADB, the Government, and the co-financiers will conduct regular annual reviews of the \nProject,  and  will  jointly  undertake  a  midterm  review  of  the  Project  in  mid-2010  to  assess  (i) \nimplementation  status,  (ii)  design  and  construction  standards,  (iii)  performance  of  consultants \nand  contractors,  (iv)  project  impacts,  (v)  status  of  compliance  with  the  covenants  stipulated  in \nthe  grant  agreement,  and  (vi)  the  need  for  any  changes  in  the  project  scope  or  schedule  to \nachieve the project impact. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nTraffic Forecast \n\n39. \nTraffic  forecasts  by  vehicle  type  were  prepared  for  the  project  road  sections  for  2007\u2013\n2032 (Appendix 7). The forecasts are based on expected growth in GDP, income elasticities of \ndemand, and analysis of regional trade and tourism patterns. Total traffic is forecast to grow at \nannual  rates  of  about  15.4\u201316.7%  during  2007\u20132017  (the  years  during  and  immediately \nfollowing project implementation), except for the section including the bridge, which has higher \ngrowth.  The  high  growth  rates  during  2007\u20132017  are  due  in  large  part  to  the  development  of \ngenerated  traffic  following  project  completion.  International  traffic,  in  particular,  is  expected  to \ngrow at a high rate during this period as the improved road allows for trucks and other vehicles \nto travel throughout the year. Total traffic is forecast to grow at annual rates of about 6.8\u20138.6% \nduring 2017\u20132032. The projected growth rates are reasonable considering expected economic \ngrowth in the project area and experience in other ADB-financed road projects. Generated traffic \narises  from  increased  shipments  of  agricultural  commodities  and  other  goods,  and  increased \npassenger traffic carrying tourists between Thailand and Louangphrabang. The improved road \nconditions will also generate demand by reducing vehicle operating costs (VOCs). Normal traffic \nis  expected  to  account  for  40\u201360%  of  total  traffic  on  the  project  road.  Generated  traffic \ncomprises  35\u201343%  of  total  traffic.  Diverted  traffic  comprises  a  relatively  small  portion  of  total \ntraffic at 5\u201320%. Motorcycles and small trucks (with fewer than three axles) comprise the largest \nportions of traffic on the project road, reflecting the economic status of residents of the project \narea and the importance to the economy of exports to Thailand. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n40. \nThe  economic  analysis  was  carried  out  for  the  Project  by  comparing  the  with-  and \nwithout-project scenarios (Appendix 8). In the without-project scenario, the road is assumed to \nremain  in  its  present  condition.  The  with-project  scenario  includes  routine  and  periodic \nmaintenance according to international standards. The project preparatory technical assistance \nconsidered various mutually exclusive project alternatives such as different pavement types and \nalignments, and the proposed Project is based on the most cost-effective and least-cost option. \nProject  economic  costs  include  the  resource  costs  of  road  improvement  and  maintenance, \nequipment,  and  consulting  services.  The  primary  economic  benefits  for  the  Project  are  VOC \nsavings,  time  savings,  diverted  traffic,  savings  from  improved  road  safety,  and  savings  from \nreduced  maintenance  costs.  Economic  benefits  were  calculated  using  the  same  methodology \nused  for  costs.  VOC  savings  will  accrue  primarily  from  improvements  in  the  road  surface, \nhorizontal and vertical alignment, and increased average speed. VOC savings for normal traffic \naccount for about 39% of total benefits while benefits from generated traffic account for about \n22%.  Generated  traffic  is  defined  as  new  traffic  induced  from  the  reduction  in  transport  costs \narising from the Project, and includes both international and domestic generated traffic. Benefits \nfor  generated  traffic  are  estimated  at  half  the  value  of  VOC  savings  for  normal  traffic.  The \n\n\f \n\n15\n\n \n\n \n\nProject will result in improved average speeds along the project road, and the travel time for the \nentire  length  of  the  project  road  will  be  reduced  from  about  8  hours  to  about  5  hours.  Time \nsavings  account  for  about  19.5%  of  total  benefits.  Benefits  from  improved  road  safety  and \nreduced  maintenance  costs  comprise  smaller  portions  of  total  benefits.  The  Project  will  also \nhave other benefits, such as improved access to social services. However, these have not been \nquantified because of lack of sufficient data. \n \n41. \nThe  EIRR  for  the  Project  is  16.6%,  and  the  net  present  value  is  $22.3  million,  using  a \n12% discount rate. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the effects of negative changes in \nthe key parameters that determine the benefits and costs of the Project. The EIRRs calculated \nfor  the  individual  sections  of  the  project  road  are  above  12%.  The  sensitivity  analysis  for  the \nProject indicates that capital costs would have to increase by 49% or total benefits decrease by \n32% for the EIRR to reach the level of 12%. Given ADB\u2019s experience with similar projects in Lao \nPDR,  such  changes  are  not  expected  to  occur.  The  sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the  EIRR \nexceeds 12% in all cases. A distribution analysis was carried out. The project benefits accruing \nto  Lao  PDR  are  distributed  among  five  groups:  (i)  users  of  freight  transport,  (ii)  users  of \npassenger transport, (iii) vehicle owners, (iv) labor, and (v) the Government and/or economy of \nLao  PDR.  Users  of  passenger  transport  receive  about  25%  of  total  benefits,  users  of  freight \ntransport  receive  about  19%,  vehicle  owners  receive  about  12%,  and  the  Government  and/or \nthe economy receive about 42%.  \n \nC. \n\nResettlement \n\n42. \n The Project is rated category A, and a full resettlement plan (RP) has been prepared for \nthe  whole  length  of  Route  4  and  the  Mekong  River  bridge.  The  RP  identified  255  project \naffected households.  Of the 43 dwelling units totally affected, only 11 units need to be relocated \nto new plots. Of the 15 totally affected shops, only 1 has to be relocated to a new plot. Impacts \non paddy land along Route 4 are minimal (not more than 7.5% loss of total productive land per \naffected  household),  so  there  will  be  no  significant  impacts  on  the  livelihood  of  affected \nhouseholds. However, for the Mekong River bridge, 12 households will lose more than 10% of \ntheir  productive  land  (paddy  and  teak  plantations).  The  RP  ensures  that  all  those  affected, \nirrespective  of  their  tenure  status,  will  be  able  to  restore  if  not  improve  their  socioeconomic \nconditions  through  the  project  entitlements,  as  shown  in  the  summary  resettlement  plan  and \nframework  (Appendix  9).  Land  acquisition  and  relocation  of  affected  households  cannot \ncommence  until  the  updated  RP  has  been  reviewed  and  approved  by  ADB.  Affected \nhouseholds will not be displaced from affected land until the province allocates alternative land \nfor  them  within  the  same  or  a  neighboring  village  or  compensation  is  paid  that  is  sufficient  to \npurchase  suitable  alternative  land  within  the  same  or  a  neighboring  village.  An  independent \nmonitor  will  be  engaged  prior  to  RP  updating  for  regular  monitoring  and  evaluation.  Particular \nattention  has  been  given  to  the  specific  needs and  concerns  of  indigenous  peoples  and  other \nvulnerable  groups  such  as  the  landless;  poor;  and  households  headed  by  women,  disabled, \nelderly,  or  children  without  means  of  support.  Specific  actions  for  indigenous  peoples  and  a \ngender  strategy  are  included  in  the  RP.  MCTPC  has  identified  15  rural  access  roads  for \npotential  inclusion  in  the  Project,  but  prioritization  and  selection  will  be  done  during  project \nimplementation.  A  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared  to  guide  in  preparation  and \nimplementation of RPs for all rural access roads with land acquisition and resettlement impacts.  \n \nD. \n\nSocial Impact and Gender \n\n43. \nThe Project will provide direct social benefits in addition to the economic benefits which \nwill  expand  economic  opportunities  available  to  the  poor.  The  project  road  passes  through \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\nlargely agricultural areas that are in transition from production for subsistence consumption and \nfor local markets to more export and commercially oriented crops. Rural women in the project \ndistricts  are  engaged  in  both  subsistence  and  commercial  agriculture.  The  upgrading  of  the \nproject road will provide a strategic all-weather link that will facilitate improved access for men \nand  women  to  goods,  markets,  schools,  medical  facilities,  and  other  social  services  for  the \nproject districts. The improved road access will lower the costs for the public sector to provide \nsocial services. The Project will have a positive health impact on people from the approximately \n120 villages located along the road, by improving the very dusty and hazardous road conditions \nin which children walk several kilometers to school during the dry season. Increased access to \ntransport  in  the  project  districts  will  increase  enrollment  of  children  from  rural  areas  to  the \nsecondary  schools  in  towns.  Construction  and  operation  of  the  road  will  provide  significant \nemployment opportunities for poor people. It is estimated that a total of 8,130 person-months of \nwork will be created during project construction, of which 5,420 will be in the unskilled category. \nPoor  men  and  women  will  also  benefit  through  seasonal  employment  from  road  maintenance \nwork.  Increased  tourism  will  generate  additional  demand  for  locally  produced  goods  and \nservices.  Improvement  of  rural  access  roads  will  help  to  extend  the  project  benefits  and \nopportunities  to  rural  communities.  Details  on  the  gender  strategy  and  other  impacts  of  the \nProject are in the summary poverty reduction and social strategy in Appendix 10. \n \n44. \nPotential adverse social and gender impacts from the Project, in addition to the Project\u2019s \nresettlement impacts, include (i) increased traffic safety risks for people living and working along \nthe road caused by higher traffic levels and higher vehicle speeds along the improved road; and \n(ii) increased risks of exposure to HIV/AIDS and human trafficking of women and children during \nconstruction and operation because of the influx of construction workers and increased transit \ntraffic.  The  Project  will  address  these  risks  through  the  road  safety  component  and  HIV/AIDS \nand human trafficking program. \n \nE. \n\nIndigenous Peoples \n\n45. \nIn the project area, 82.3% of the population is classified Lao-Tai (the main ethnic group); \n10.8% Mon-Khmer; 5.8% Hmong-Ewmian; and 0.3% Chinese-Tibetan. The indigenous peoples \ngroups  have  been  relocated  to  the  project  area  since  1970  because  of  war  and  as  part  of \ngovernment  relocation plans.  The groups  now  practice sedentary  agriculture  and rice  farming, \nand have been involved in commercialization of agriculture. Although they retain their traditional \nculture,  religion,  and  social  organization,  they  have  adopted  mainstream  language,  education, \nand  agricultural  practices.  The  literacy  rate  among  the  Mone-Khmer  is  close  to  the  national \naverage but the Hmong-Ewmian have a literacy rate about half that of the national average. The \nvillage  consultation  indicates  that  indigenous  peoples  groups  support  the  road  improvement. \nIndigenous people account for 40% of the 255 households potentially affected by resettlement \n(para. 42). The impact on agricultural land is minor. These groups will benefit from the economic \ndevelopment arising from the Project, including improved access to markets and social services \nand  greater  opportunities  for  their  roadside  small  businesses.  Since  the  Project  will  have  no \ndifferential negative impact on indigenous peoples than on the main ethnic group, an indigenous \npeoples  development  plan  is  not  required.  To  maximize  benefits  to  indigenous  peoples  and \nensure that they are not marginalized by resettlement activities, activities specific to indigenous \npeoples are included in the RP, gender strategy, and HIV/AIDS and human trafficking program. \n \nF. \n\nEnvironmental Assessment \n\nThe  project  classification \n\n46. \ninitial  environmental \nexamination (IEE) of the Project was carried out, reviewed by ADB, and has been approved by \n\nis  environment  category  B.  An \n\n\f \n\n17\n\n \n\n \n\nthe Government which will issue the environmental compliance permit. The summary IEE is in \nAppendix 11. The IEE concludes that the Project will not have any major adverse environmental \nimpacts and only short-term air and water pollution, noise, traffic disturbance, and soil erosion \nimpacts  during  the  construction  period.  The  mitigation  measures  identified  in  the  IEE\u2019s \nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMP)  include  (i)  restoration  of  affected  areas,  e.g.  borrow \npits, after project completion; (ii) avoiding aggravation of soil erosion-prone areas; (iii) controlling \nsewage  discharge  and  other  waste  fluids  from  construction  sites,  and  hazardous  and  toxic \nmaterials  from  bitumen  plants  and  from  construction  equipment;  (iv)  maintaining  proper \ndrainage to avoid stagnation and controlling downstream water pollution; (v) topsoil removal and \nreinstallation  for  revegetation  upon  completion  of  road  improvement  works;  (vi)  minimizing \nnoise,  dust,  emissions,  and  other  pollutants  associated  with  civil  works;  and  (vii)  provision  of \nadequate  road  access  during  construction.  The  Project  will  eliminate  heavy  road  dust \nemissions, thereby reducing safety risks caused by extremely poor road visibility under current \nroad  conditions.  The  road  improvement  will  also  reduce  associated  health  risks  to  roadside \ncommunities. The Project will have overall beneficial environmental impacts and will have minor \nnegative impacts, which will be carefully monitored and adequately mitigated. The EMP covers \nall sections of Route 4 including the bridge over the Mekong River. The EA will be responsible \nfor the EMP implementation and monitoring during pre-construction, construction, and operation \nphases;  and  for  all  project  components,  including  those  financed  by  co-financiers.  The \nconstruction contractors will develop their site-specific environmental management action plans, \nbased  on  the  EMP,  to  minimize  anticipated  impacts  during  construction.  The  EA  will  monitor \ncontractors\u2019 compliance with the provisions of the EMP. Detailed information on environmental \nimpact and mitigation measures is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n The final decision on which rural access roads will be improved under the Project will be \n47. \nmade  during  implementation,  so  the  rural  access  roads  are  not  included  in  the  IEE.  The  EA, \nwith the assistance of the supervision consultant, will conduct the environmental assessment of \nthe  rural  access  roads  proposed  for  inclusion  in  the  Project,  based  on  the  environmental \nassessment and review procedure included in the IEE and in Supplementary Appendix F.19 The \ncost of the environmental assessment for the rural access roads is included in the supervision \nconsultant\u2019s  budget.  Rural  access  roads  for  logging  or  mining\u2014or  those  passing  through \nprotected forests, protected wetlands, or rare habitats\u2014will not be selected. \n \nG. \n\nRisks \n\n48. \nThe  Project  is  formulated  to  minimize  potential  risks  during  and  after  project \nimplementation.  The  traffic  forecast  may  not  materialize,  but  the  Project  remains  viable  even \nwith  substantially  lower  traffic  levels.  There  is  a  risk  that  the  road  may  not  be  properly \nmaintained,  but  this  will  be  addressed  by  the  emphasis  of  ADB  and  other  international \ninstitutions,  and  the  commitment  of  the  Government  to  road  maintenance.  Compensation, \nassistance, and income restoration measures relating to involuntary resettlement might not be \ndelivered  on  time,  thereby  delaying  the  start  of  civil  works.  The  gender  strategy  includes \nconsultation  workshops  for  the  affected  households  to  increase  their  understanding  of \nresettlement  issues  such  as  entitlements,  compensation,  and  the  grievance  process.  The \nproject  supervision  consultants  will  include  specialists  to  help  the  EA  manage  resettlement, \nenvironmental impacts, and ethnic minority specific activities. These resources will also assist in \nensuring that the safeguard policies are complied with. Upgrading of the road will increase the \nmobility of goods and people along the route and could increase risks of HIV/AIDS and human \ntrafficking  in  local  communities,  especially  among  women  and  children.  To  minimize  the \n\n                                                 \n19 In accordance with ADB Operations Manual Section F1/BP. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\npotential risks of increased road traffic accidents, HIV/AIDS, and human trafficking, the Project \nincludes a road safety program and an HIV/AIDS and human trafficking program.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  MCTPC  have  given  the \n\n49. \nfollowing specific assurances, which will be incorporated into the legal documents. \n\n \n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe  Government  will  provide  counterpart  funds  for  project  implementation  on \ntime.  MTCPC  will  make  timely  submission  of  annual  budgetary  appropriation \nrequest  to  the  Committee  for  Planning  and  Investment  and  MOF;  MOF  will \nensure  prompt  disbursement  of  appropriated  funds  during  each  year  of  project \nimplementation. \n\nMCTPC  and  the  relevant  DCTPCs  will  be  responsible  for  the  operation  and \nmaintenance  of  the  project  road  and  the  rural  access  roads  through  proper \ntechnical  supervision  and  adequate  allocation  of  funds.  The  completed  project \nroads will be maintained to a standard consistent with the standard adopted for \nthe Government\u2019s national road network under the RMF.  \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  project  design  includes  road  safety \nmeasures  during  the  construction  period  and  operation  period  following  project \ncompletion.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  MCTPC  implements  the  agreed \nRoad Safety Action Plan. \n\nThe Government will ensure that checkpoints along the Project\u2019s national roads \nto  control  the  overloading  of  vehicles  will  be  fully  operational  by  the  time  civil \nworks  have  been  completed.  The  Government  will  maintain  a  database  on  the \nstatus of load enforcement measures and incidence of vehicle overloading for a \nminimum of 3 years following project completion.  \n\n(v)  Within 6 months of ADB grant effectiveness, MCTPC will create a project website \nto  disclose  information  about  various  matters  on  the  Project.  The  website  will \ninclude  information  on  project  procurement  including  the  list  of  participating \nbidders,  name  of  the  winning  bidder,  basic  details  on  bidding  procedures \nadopted, amount of contract awarded, and the list of goods/services procured. \n\n(vi)  Within  6  months  of  ADB  grant  effectiveness,  MCTPC  will  prepare  a  grievance \nredress  mechanism,  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  establish  a  task  force  at  DOR  to \nreceive and resolve complaints/grievances or act upon reports from stakeholders \non  misuse  of  funds  and  other  irregularities,  including  grievances  caused  by \nresettlement  and  environmental  issues.  The  task  force  will  (i)  make  public  the \nexistence  of  this  grievance  redress  mechanism  through  a  public  awareness \ncampaign;  (ii)  review  and  address  grievances  of  stakeholders  in  relation  to  the \nProject, any of the service providers, or any person responsible for carrying out \nany aspect of the Project; and (iii) proactively and constructively respond to them.  \n\n(vii) \n\nThe  Government  and  MCTPC  will  ensure  that  any  involuntary  resettlement  will \nbe carried out in accordance with the agreed RP and the RF for the rural roads, \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\n \n\n \n\nADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995),  and  the  Government\u2019s  laws  and \nregulations  on  involuntary  resettlement.  In  case  of  differences  between  the \nGovernment\u2019s  laws  and regulations and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary Resettlement  Policy, \nADB\u2019s  policy  will  prevail.  Based  on  the  resettlement  framework,  an  RP  will  be \nprepared  for  each  of  the  proposed  rural  roads  involving  land  acquisition  or \nresettlement  and  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval  prior  to \ncommencement of any civil works for the specific section of the rural roads that \ninvolves  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement.  Land  acquisition  and \nreallocation of affected households will not commence until an updated RP has \nbeen reviewed and approved by ADB. The Government will ensure that voluntary \ndonation  of  land  for  the  Project  will  follow  the  agreed  criteria,  as  set  out  in  the \nRP. The Government and MTCPC will ensure that civil works contractors will not \nbe issued notices to commence for any part of a section of a road involving land \nacquisition  and  resettlement,  unless  the  Government  has  (a)  satisfactorily \ncompleted,  in  accordance  with  the  approved  RP,  compensation  payment  and \nrelocation to new sites; (b) ensured that rehabilitation assistance is in place; and \n(c) ensured that the area required for civil works is free of all encumbrances.  \n\n \n(viii)  The  Project  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  laws  and \nregulations of the Government and ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  specific  measures  on  indigenous  peoples \nstipulated  in  the  RP,  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy,  and \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking program are carried out. \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nThe Government and MCTPC will ensure that all civil works contractors engaged \nunder the Project (i) provide for equal pay to men and women for equal work and \nmake  prompt  payment  of  wages;  (ii)  provide  safe  working  conditions  and  water \nand  sanitation  facilities  for  male  and  female  workers;  (iii)  do  not  violate  any \nprohibitions  against  child  labor  under  the  Government\u2019s  laws  and  international \ntreaty obligations; and (iv) require the contractor to include information on the risk \nof transmission of STIs, including HIV/AIDS, in health and safety programs for all \nconstruction  workers  employed  under  the  Project.  Specific  provisions  to  this \neffect  will  be  included  in  bidding  documents  and  civil  works  contracts,  and \ncompliance will be monitored by MCTPC. \n\nThe  Government  will  implement  and  monitor  the  agreed  HIV/AIDS  and  human \ntrafficking  program  in  the  construction  camps,  towns,  and  rural  areas  of  the \nproject  area.  Training  will  be  provided  to  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity  of \nthe  Environment  and  Social  Division  of  DOR  and  other  agencies  involved  in \nplanning and implementation of the program. \n\nThe Government and MCTPC will ensure that the gender development measures \nprovided in the summary poverty reduction and social strategy are undertaken to \npromote  the  participation  of  women  in  project  activities.  The  Government  and \nMCTPC  will  further  ensure  that  district  resettlement  committees  established \naccording to the RP will include female representatives from the district Women\u2019s \nUnion,  the  village  Women\u2019s  Union,  severely  affected  households,  households \nheaded  by  women,  and  indigenous  peoples  households.  Capacity  building \ntraining programs on resettlement activities will be provided to district and village \nresettlement committee members, including female representatives listed above.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n \n\n(xii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  construction,  operation,  and  implementation  of  the  project  facilities  will  be \ncarried  out  in  accordance  with  the  IEE,  including  the  EMP  the  environmental \nassessment and review procedures agreed between the Government and ADB, \nand  will  comply  with  the  Government\u2019s  environmental  laws  and  regulations  and \nADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002).  If  there  is  any  discrepancy  between  the \nGovernment\u2019s laws and regulations, and ADB\u2019s environment policy, ADB\u2019s policy \nwill  prevail.  The  Government  and  MCTPC  will  implement  the  environmental \nmitigation and management measures, and other recommendations specified in \nIEE\u2019s  EMP  to  minimize  any  adverse  environmental  impacts  arising  from  the \nconstruction, operation, and implementation of project facilities. The Government \nand MCTPC will ensure that the construction contractors develop a site-specific \nenvironmental management action plan based on the EMP. The Government will \nensure that the portions of the Project that are to be funded by other financiers \nwill adopt the provisions of the IEE and EMP. \n\n(xiii)  MCTPC  will  conduct  an  environmental  assessment  of  the  rural  access  roads \nproposed  to  be  financed  under  the  Project.  The  environmental  assessment  will \nbe based on the environmental assessment and review framework prepared for \nthe Project and included in the IEE. MTCPC will ensure that rural access roads \nfor  logging  or  mining  or  rural  access  roads  that  pass  through  protected  forests, \nprotected wetlands, or rare habitats will not be financed under the project. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n I  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles of  Agreement  of \n\n50. \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve  \n\nthe  grant  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $27,000,000  to  the  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic  Republic  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  for  the  Northern \nGreater  Mekong  Subregion  Transport  Network  Improvement  Project,  on  terms \nand conditions substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Grant \nAgreement presented to the Board;  \n\nin the event the OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID) approves loan \nfinancing  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $11,000,000  to  the  Lao  People's \nDemocratic  Republic  for  the  Northern  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Transport \nNetwork  Improvement  Project,  the  administration  by  ADB  of  such  loan  in \naccordance with the proposal set out in paragraph 27 of this report; and \n\nin the event the Government of Australia approves grant financing not exceeding \nthe  equivalent  of  $14,500,000  to  the  Lao  People's  Democratic  Republic  for  the \nNorthern  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Transport  Network  Improvement  Project, \nthe administration by ADB of such grant in accordance with the proposal set out \nin paragraph 27 of this report. \n\n5 September 2007 \n\n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n 21\n\n \n\nDesign \nSummary \nImpact \nTrade in the region and \neconomic growth in the \nproject area increase \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nPerformance \nTargets/Indicators \n\n \n1.

Based on the five-\nyear  development  plans,  the  provinces  prepare  and  submit  annual  implementation  plans  for \ntransport  projects  to  MCTPC,  which  submits  them  to  the  Committee  for  Planning  and \nCooperation of the Prime Minister\u2019s Office for approval. \n \n2. \nThe  Department  of  Roads  (DOR)  within  MCTPC  is  responsible  for  the  administration, \nplanning, construction, and maintenance of national roads. DOR monitors maintenance programs \nfor  national  roads,  and  assists  the  provinces  with  the  implementation  and  monitoring  of  road \nimprovement and maintenance programs of the local road network. Responsibility for execution \nof  all  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  has  been  delegated  to  the  provincial  Departments  of \nCommunications,  Transport,  Posts,  and  Construction  (DCTPCs),  which  also  cover  district  and \ncommunity/access roads. DCTPCs form the provincial arms of MCTPC and are responsible both \nto the central government through MCTPC and to the provincial administrations. DCTPC staff are \nappointed  partly  by  MCTPC  and  partly  by  the  provinces.  Within  the  road  subsector,  the \nresponsibilities  of  DCTPCs  include  the  implementation  of  maintenance  of  national  roads  within \neach province; and full responsibility for construction, improvement, and maintenance of the local \nroad network (provincial, district, and community roads). There are an average of 75 DCTPC staff \nin each province. \n \n3. \nThere  are  168  permanent  staff  assigned  to  DOR\u201432  women  and  47  assigned  to \nexternally financed projects. Of the eight divisions (including local roads) within DOR, the Road \nAdministration Division is the main division dealing with road maintenance, and has responsibility \nfor the certification of payments for disbursement from the Road Maintenance Fund for national \nroad  maintenance.  There  are  16  permanent  staff  in  the  Road  Administration  Division.  The \nPlanning  and  Technical  Division  has  16  staff  and  the  Project  Monitoring  Division  has  17  staff. \nAlthough staff numbers may vary between the divisions according to workload, the total number \nof divisions in DOR is not expected to change.  \n \n\n2. \n\nRoad Network \n\n4. \nTransport in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) is almost exclusively road-\nbased. Roads carry about 70% of freight and 90% of passenger traffic, so they are a key element \nof  the  basic  infrastructure  that  makes  up  the  enabling  environment  to  support  regional  and \ninternational  trade.  The  Mekong  River  and  its  tributaries  provide  river  transportation  (28%  of \nfreight  traffic).  However,  only  1,300  kilometers  (km)  of  the  river,  which  flows  about  1,900  km \nthrough the country, are navigable owing to rapids and falls as well as low water levels during the \ndry  season.  Although  the  value  of  airfreight  is  negligible,  domestic  air  transport  plays  a  crucial \nrole in establishing links between important urban areas and otherwise inaccessible parts of the \ncountry.  There  are  two  international  airports  at  Vientiane  and  Louangphrabang,  with  provincial \nairports for scheduled services at Pakse, Xiangkhouang, Louang-Namtha, Houayxay, Oudomxay, \nSamNua, and Phongsali, as well as other small airports and airfields throughout the country.  \n \n 5. \nThe  public  road  network  in  Lao  PDR  is  divided  into  several  different  classes  of  roads: \n(i) national,  (ii)  provincial,  (iii)  district,  (iv)  urban,  (v)  community  (rural),  and  (vi)  special.  Formal \ndefinitions of each class are given in the Road Law (03/NA/99), 1999. Definitions of national and \nprovincial roads are given in Ministerial Decision 1312, issued in 1997, which formalized the list of \nnational roads.1 \n                                                 \n1   A draft decree is being processed by MCTPC to formalize the classified national roads under the Road Law. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n25 \n\n \nThe country had a road network of about 34,000 km in 2004, comprising national roads \n6. \n(21%), provincial roads (26%), urban roads (5%), and district/community roads (48%). Some 14% \nof  the  total  road  network  is  paved;  the  rest  have  gravel  or  earth  surfaces.  The  rehabilitation  of \nsome roads included in the official national road network is still in the planning stage and many of \nthe  local  roads  are  mere  tracks.  The  spine  of  the  road  system  (route  13)  runs  from  the  border \nwith  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  via  Pak  Mong  in  the  north  to  the  border  with \nCambodia  (Verne  Kham)  in  the  south.  The  critical  east  west  links  connecting  Thailand  and \nwestern  Lao  to  the  border  with  Viet  Nam  in  the  east  are routes  6,  7,  8,  9,  12,  15,  and 18.  The \nrehabilitation  and  improvement  of  these  roads  forming  the  core  arterial  network  have  been \ncompleted; route 3 (linking Thailand via Lao PDR with the PRC) will be completed by 2008.  \n  \n7. \nDespite the many positive advances achieved in the national network, Lao PDR continues \nto lag behind its neighbors in road infrastructure with an estimated national road network of very \nlow density\u2014about 0.03 km/km2. Road contact between Vientiane and the provincial capitals is \nimproving, but two of the 17 provincial capitals remain without sealed all-weather links. About half \nof the national road system is unpaved and much of the local network is impassable during the \nwet season. All-weather access has been/is being provided to 14 of the Government-designated \n47  poorest  districts  under  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-financed  projects\u2014including  Xieng \nKhouang  Road  Improvement;2 Rural  Access  Roads;3 East-West  Corridor;4 Northern  Economic \nCorridor;5 and Roads for Rural Development.6 Access to the districts that do not have year-round \nroad  access  or  are  inaccessible  by  road  at  any  time  is  being  addressed  by  MCTPC  under  an \nongoing  plan  as  part  of  the  National  Growth  and  Poverty  Eradication  Strategy.  Although  it  is \nessential to pay continued attention to national roads, much greater attention needs to be paid to \nthe  local  road  network  as  the  national  network  begins  to  coalesce.  Without  access  to  the  main \nroad  and  transport  system,  the  benefits  derived  from  cross-regional  and  national  links  may  be \nlimited, the potential contribution of the rural sector to sustained growth and national development \nwill not be realized fully, and the poverty of the rural population will not be reduced fully.  \n  \n8. \nThe Integrated Rural Accessibility Planning (IRAP) project has assisted in planning district \nand  local  road  development.  It  was  funded  by  the  Swedish  International  Development \nCooperation Agency (Sida), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and International \nLabour Organization (ILO); and its work has been incorporated in DOR\u2019s Local Roads Division. \nThrough a participatory planning process, IRAP aims to improve the access of rural communities \nvia better siting of basic facilities and services for rural populations; and improving the mobility of \nrural  people  through  convenient  and  low-cost  roads,  tracks,  trails,  footbridges,  and  waterways. \nIRAP  recognizes  that  improving  the  rural  road  network  will  have  a  positive  effect  on  the \naccessibility  of  the  rural  poor  to  high  schools,  dispensaries,  pharmacies  and  hospitals, \ninformation and technology, markets and shops, government services, and employment centers. \nMaintenance  is  a  key  theme  in  the  process,  and  a  labor-based,  equipment-supported  routine \nmaintenance  approach  is  recommended.  IRAP  was  used  as  the  basis  of  feeder  road  selection \nunder  the  Rural  Community  Access  Component  of  the  East-West  Corridor  Project  (footnote  4), \nand  the  Community  Infrastructure  Component  of  the  Northern  Economic  Corridor  Project \n(footnote 5).   \n\n                                                 \n2   ADB.  1997.

The general annual growth rate is about 4%, with the highest growth in motorcycles \n(12.5%  per  annum  over  last  5  years).  There  is  a  generally  low  level  of  traffic  on  national  and \nprovincial  roads  throughout  Lao  PDR.  With  the  exception  of  areas  around  Vientiane  and \nSavannakhet, traffic levels on the national network are below 1,000 average annual daily traffic \n(AADT),  and  below 500  AADT  on  most  sections.  On  provincial  roads, traffic  levels  are  typically \nbelow  100  AADT.  The  vehicle  fleet  for  1985\u20132005  and  current  road  densities  are  shown  in \nTable A2.5.   \n \n\n4. \n\nRoad Sector Revenues and Expenditures \n\n10. \nRoad  expenditures  are  financed  from  general  budgetary  allocations,  foreign  loans  and \ngrants  with  maintenance  funded  through  the  Road  Maintenance  Fund  (RMF). 7  Road  sector \nrevenues consist of sales and import duties on vehicles, spare parts, tires, and automotive fuel \nproducts,  as  well  as  annual  vehicle  license  fees,  vehicle  registration  and  inspection  fees,  and \ndriving license fees. In addition, revenue to the RMF is generated from a fuel levy, heavy vehicle \nsurcharge, tolls, international transit fees, overloading fines, and other road user charges.  \n \n11. \nterms,  both \nfor  construction  and  maintenance.

Other  annual  charges  also  exist,  such  as  temporary  registration \ncharges \nregistration  charges, \nmiscellaneous charges for changing the color of the vehicle and loss of registration documents, \nand one-time fees for issuing drivers\u2019 licenses. All these fees are minor sources of revenue. \n \n\nforeign-registered  vehicles \n\nthe  country, \n\nfirst-time \n\nfor \n\nin \n\n5. \n\nMaintenance \n\n14. \nThe objectives for road maintenance planning and institutional structures are founded in \nthe recognition that funding allocation and service provision are separate functions with distinctly \nseparate objectives. The objective for maintenance planning is to maximize the effectiveness of \nmaintenance  expenditure  by  determining  the  level  of  service  and  maintenance  strategies  that \noptimize  the  benefits  to  the  nation  for  the  available  level  of  funding.  The  objective  for  service \nprovision  is  to  implement  delivery  mechanisms  that  achieve  the  greatest  possible  efficiency  as \nmeasured by quality, performance specifications, and costs. \n \n15. \nA  sustainable  maintenance  regime  includes  (i)  an  institutional  structure  that  takes \nresponsibility  for  funding,  planning,  and  implementing  maintenance,  while  separating  the \ninstitutions  responsible  for  funding  from  those  responsible  for  planning  and  management; \n(ii) consistent  and  adequate  yearly  funding  to  meet  a  level  of  service  (road  conditions)  that \nminimizes  total  transport  costs  for  the  nation;  (iii)  maintenance  planning  (such  as  the  Road \nManagement System implemented under the World Bank supported-Road Maintenance Project \n[RMP])  with  the  road  inventory,  periodically  updated  condition  assessment,  traffic  volumes  and \ncomposition,  vehicle  operating  costs,  unit  costs  of  maintenance  operations  and  regional  cost \nvariations,  and  population  served;  and  (iv) well-designed  maintenance  management  and \nimplementation  delivered \nthrough  competitive  bidding  procedures  with  proper  contract \ndocumentation  and  performance  specifications,  adequate  supervision,  audit  and  quality  control, \nand capable and competitive contractors.  \n  \n16. \nTo  meet  these  conditions,  the  Government  established  an  RMF  in  2001  as  a  way  of \nproviding  a  sustainable  funding  base  for  the  maintenance  of  the  national  road  network  (and \neventually all roads) from domestic sources. The RMF is based on the following principles: \n  \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nFunding. Road user contributions will be allocated to the cost of maintaining the \nnational road network, with 10% of RMF revenues initially allocated to local roads \nand progressively contributing to the full cost of maintaining all roads.  \nIndependence.  An  RMF  board  under  MCTPC,  including  the  private  sector,  will \nsupervise,  direct,  and  make  recommendations  on  matters  related  to  the  overall \nmanagement and financing of road maintenance. \nRevenues.  Revenues  to  be  derived  from  user  charges,  primarily  a  fuel  levy \n(gasoline and diesel fuel), heavy vehicle surcharges, tolls, and international transit \ncharges.  The  fuel  levy  will  be  adjusted  annually,  collected  independently,  and \ndeposited directly into the RMF. \nApplication. Priority will be routine maintenance.  \nAdministration. The RMF will be a separate account operated and managed by \nthe RMF board and will not be part of the Government's general revenue. \nAllocation.  The  allocation  for  network  maintenance  will  be  based  on  need, \nfunctional classification, and economic considerations. \n\n(vii)  Auditing  and  reporting. Accounts subject to annual audits will be carried out by \n\nan independent auditor in compliance with government regulations.  \n\n \nThe  initial  charge  for  the  fuel  levy  was  KN40/liter,  with  gradual  government  approved \n17. \nincreases  with  the  current  level  (end  of  2006)  at  KN200/liter;  and  the  annual  heavy  vehicle \nsurcharge  ranging  from  $25  for  a  gross  vehicle  weight  of  2\u20134  tons  to  $55  for  a  gross  vehicle \nweight  of  more  than  7  tons  for  trucks,  and  $15  for  a  bus  having  12\u201324  seats  to  $40  for  a  bus \nhaving more than 42 seats. In effect, the RMF treats roads in a manner similar to other utilities, \nsuch  as  telecommunications,  electricity,  and  water  supply.  Road  users  pay  an  access  charge \nthrough the annual license fee and then pay according to road use through a levy on fuel, tolls, \noverloading  fines,  etc.  The  level  of  road  user  charges  is  periodically  reviewed  by  the  national \nassembly.  \n \n18. \nAmong the major programs that have addressed road maintenance management are the \n(i) Highway  Improvement  Project  Maintenance  Study,  1993;  (ii)  Five-Year  Maintenance  Plan \n1996/97  to  2000/01,1997;  (iii)  Procedures  for  Developing  a  Rolling  Medium  Term  Plan, \nManagement Information System, 1997; (iv) MCTPC Proposed Routine Maintenance Programme \n1999/2000,  1999;  (v)  Lao-Swedish  Road  Project  (LSRP-I)  \u2013  Economic  Evaluation  of  Periodic \nMaintenance Programme, 1999/2001; (vi) Lao-Swedish Road Sector Project 1997\u20132000, Report \non  the  Development  of  Road  Maintenance  Management  Systems,  1999;  (vii)  Five-Year  Road \nSector  Improvement  and  Maintenance  Plan,  2000\u20132005;  (viii)  MCTPC  10-Year  Maintenance \nProgram;  and  (ix)  RMP,  (2001\u20132004)  and  RMP  2,  (2005\u20132009).  The  World  Bank  RMP \nrepresents a major step forward in developing sustainable mechanisms to manage and finance \nall  national,  provincial,  district,  and  rural  roads.  The  primary  objective  of  the  RMP  is  the \nsustainable preservation of road assets. To achieve that goal, the RMP is developing sustainable \nmechanisms to manage and finance the maintenance of all roads.   \n \n\n6. \n\nFinancial Management \n\n19. \nThe  Department  of  Planning  and  Cooperation  handles  the  accounting  and  financial \nmatters of MCTPC; all transactions pass through DOR, regardless of source. DOR is the largest \noffice  in  MCTPC\u2014it  accounts  for  over  90%  of  MCTPC\u2019s  budget  and  the  majority  of  externally \nfunded  projects  in  MCTPC.  Financial  monitoring  and  accounting  of  projects  is  under  the \nDisbursement  Division  of  DOR.  Financial  and  accounting  systems  in  MCTPC  and  the  DCTPCs \nare  being  improved  continually  to  provide  functional  and  reliable  budget  expenditure  reporting \nand  accountancy.  DOR  has  adopted  the  Financial  Management  System  developed  under \nLSRSP-I  to  meet  the  long-term  objective  of  establishing  a  uniform  financial  and  accounting \nsystem that includes all sources of funding and consolidates DPTPC accounting in MCTPC. The \nsystem\u2014covering fund disbursement and authorization, budgeting and reporting, and accounting \nand  auditing\u2014complies  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and  government  and \nMCTPC  regulations  and  procedures.  The  World  Bank  has  also  accepted  the  system  for \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n29 \n\napplication in its projects. Recommended improvements in the system involve the following: (i) a \nuniform  chart  of  accounts  and  account  structure;  (ii)  accounting  based  on  the  double  entry \nprinciple, and transactions recorded in journal and general ledger; (iii) all transactions recorded in \none program; (iv) organization and setting up of an accounting unit in the Disbursement Division \nof  DOR  with  formal responsibility  for  all  departmental accounting  requirements; (v)  coordination \nand consolidation of DCTPC budgets in MCTPC; (vi) externally funded road projects included in \nDOR  and  DCTPC  accounting  procedures;  and  (vii)  MCTPC  and  each  DCTPC  to  manage  and \noperate  its  own  bank  accounts,  impress  accounts,  and  certify  payments  regarding  externally \nfunded projects without approval by the Ministry of Finance. \n \nThe  initiatives  being  taken  by  MCTPC  are  recognized  as  complementary  to  the  support \n20. \nprovided through an ADB-financed technical assistance project,8 which assisted the Government \nin strengthening accounting systems at the Ministry of Finance and in some of the line ministries. \nThe complementarity of the systems lies in linking project accounting to government accounting \nfor  budgeting,  which  is  driven  by  budget  and  accounting  laws.  Full  compatibility  will  be \nestablished  through  uniform  data  management  systems,  and  it  is  expected  that  the  technical \nassistance  for  accounting  will  adopt  the  same  software  package  as  the  MCTPC  financial \nmanagement system.  \n \n\n7. \n\nAxle Load Control \n\n21. \nThe maximum axle load set by MCTPC is 8.2 tons (Regulation 570/CTPC). In December \n1999,  the  Government  signed  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  Transit \nTraffic Agreement, in which maximum gross vehicle weights were set at about 9.1 ton axle load \nequivalent, with optional lower limits to be declared officially (e.g., during the wet season). Under \nthe  World  Bank-funded  RMP  and  RMP2,  MCTPC  is  implementing  a  Heavy  Transport \nManagement  Program,  whose  main  activities  comprise  review  of existing regulations,  enforcing \nregulations,  providing  equipment  (weigh  scales),  setting  up  41  weigh  stations,  and  training  and \nsupporting a public information campaign. The program is complemented by earlier and ongoing \nADB  project  components  (East-West  Corridor  Project  [footnote  4],  Northern  Economic  Corridor \nProject  [footnote  5],  and  Roads  for  Rural  Development  Project  [footnote  6])  for  the  supply  of \nequipment and establishing weigh stations. \n \n\n8. \n\nRoad Safety \n\nRoad  accident  fatalities  continue  to  rise,  with  a  14%  increase  from  1999  to  2005.  Road \n22. \naccidents increased by 35% in the same period. With the current increase in vehicles, a growing \npopulation, and improved road network, the potential for even greater accident rates is high. The \nrate of fatalities in 2005 was 10 persons per 10,000 vehicles (414 fatalities), which dropped from \n19  persons  per  10,000  vehicles  in  1999  (362  fatalities).  The  rapid  increase  in  the  number  of \nmotorcycles  has  increased  the  number  of  fatalities.  The  current  target  of  the  Department  of \nTransport  is  to  reduce  the  rate  of  fatalities  to  8  persons  per  10,000  vehicles  by  2010  and  5 \npersons per 10,000 vehicles by 2015. A National Road Safety Strategy and Action Plan is being \nimplemented  and  is  built  around  five  elements:  education,  enforcement,  technical  environment, \ncoordination, and research and evaluation. The key issues in the strategy relate to (i) improved \ndriving skills; (ii) use of crash helmets for motorcycle drivers; (iii) improved nighttime visibility for \nmotorcyclists  and  cyclists;  (iv)  reduced  drunk  driving;  (v)  reduced  speeding;  (vi)  traffic \nmanagement,  signing,  and  delineation  of  roads;  and  (vii)  use  of  seat  belts.  The  national  Road \nSafety  Strategy  and  Action  Plan,  which  received  prime  ministerial  approval  in  April  2005, \nenvisages  implementation  through  a  National  Road  Safety  Council  currently  being  established \nunder  MCTPC  and  the  forging  of  a  Road  Safety  Partnership  among  the  Traffic  Police \nDepartment,  Department  of  Transport,  and  Department  of  Education. \nInternational \nnongovernment organizations (such as Handicap International) are supporting efforts to create a \nnetwork to increase awareness of road safety issues and address the trauma of road accidents. \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB. 1999.

Manila. \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n9. \n\nGovernment Objectives and Priorities for the Road Subsector \n\n23. \nThe  Government  has  given  high  priority  to  improvement  of  the  road  transport  system, \nprincipally to facilitate (i) movement of agricultural products from surplus to deficit areas, (ii) flow \nof consumer goods and agricultural inputs to rural areas, (iii) marketing and export of cash crops \nand other produce, and (iv) effective participation in regional and international trade. The targets \nfor physical infrastructure development include (i) completing the national road network, including \nroad  links  with  Cambodia,  PRC,  and  Viet  Nam,  as  well  as  road  and  bridge  links  with  Thailand; \n(ii) improving  the  provincial  road  network;  (iii)  upgrading  transit  routes  to  central  Viet  Nam  to \nfacilitate  Lao  PDR\u2019s  international  trade  through  ports  in  Viet  Nam;  and  (iv)  establishing  a \nsustainable maintenance system to preserve the country\u2019s transport infrastructure. Infrastructure \ndevelopment, particularly roads, is being coordinated closely with regional cooperation initiatives \nbeing  developed  under  the  ADB  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  initiative,  as  the  country  is \ncentrally located among Cambodia, PRC, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam.  \n \n\nTable A2.5: Road Network and Vehicles Data \n \nRoad Densities, 2004 \n\nRoad Length (km)

\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nA. \n\nProcurement and Recruitment Procedures \n\n1. \n\nCivil Works \n\n1. \nFor  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  contracts  administered  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB),  the  procurement  method  to  be  used  will  be  the  single  stage,  one \nenvelope  system,  with  prequalification.  For  this  purpose,  the  Ministry  of  Communications, \nTransport, Posts, and Construction (MCTPC) will submit the invitation for prequalification and all \nrelated  documents  (including  the  proposed  prequalification  factors,  methodology,  and  criteria) \nfor review and approval by ADB before they are issued. The prequalification invitation is to be \nadvertised  in  accordance  with  paras.  2.7\u20132.10  of  the  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). MCTPC will provide ADB with a report on the advertising as part of \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nthe  review  requirements.  After  the  prequalification  applications  have  been  evaluated,  ADB\u2019s \napproval  of  the  evaluation  results,  including  the  recommendation  for  prequalified  and \ndisqualified applicants, must be obtained before they are communicated to the applicants. For \neach  ICB  contract,  a  full  set  of  bid  documents  should  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and \napproval before issuance to prequalified bidders.  \n  \n2. \nFor national competitive bidding (NCB) contracts, documents will be modeled on those \ndeveloped for NCB under previous ADB-funded projects and updated to conform with the latest \nProcurement  Guidelines.  The  single  stage,  two  envelope  model  with  post-qualification  will  be \nused.  The  first  draft  English  language  version  of  the  procurement  documents  should  be \nsubmitted  for  ADB  review  and  approval  regardless  of  the  estimated  contract  amount;  for \nsubsequent contracts, ADB will review the documents post-award. ADB-approved procurement \ndocuments  should  be  used  as  a  model  for  all  succeeding  NCB  contracts  partly  or  wholly \nfinanced by ADB for the Project.  \n \n3. \nFor  all  ADB-administered  contracts,  ADB  will  review  the  bid  evaluation  report  and \nproposal for award of contract on a prior review basis. The Executing Agency (EA) must submit \ncopies  of  the  bid  evaluation  report  in  English  to  ADB  for  approval.  Contracts  funded  by  the \nRepublic of Korea will be procured using Republic of Korea procurement procedures. \n \n\n2. \n\nRecruitment of Consultants  \n\n4. \nFor ADB-administered contracts, the Borrower will use quality and cost-based selection \n(QCBS),  ADB\u2019s  preferred  method.  Full  technical  proposals  will  be  requested  from  short-listed \nfirms.  The  EA  is  required  to  submit  its  short-listing  documents  in  ADB\u2019s  standard  format  for \nADB\u2019s  approval.  Apart  from  making  sure  the  short-list  is  composed  of  qualified  firms  that  are \nreasonably geographically spread, ADB will review the following documents: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nTerms of reference and background information; \nRequest  for  proposal,  including  the  EA\u2019s  budget  for  the  assignment,  selection \nmethod, and type of technical proposals; \nCriteria for evaluating the technical proposals; \nDraft contract; and \nConsultant recruitment activities monitoring (CRAM) frame. \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n \n5. \nThe  process  of  selecting  consultants  will  follow  ADB  guidelines  for  approvals  of \ntechnical, financial, and overall ranking of consultants as well as the draft contract. For Republic \nof Korea-financed contracts, recruitment will follow Republic of Korea procedures. \n \n\n3. \n\nMonitoring the Consultant Recruitment Process \n\n6. \nMCTPC  and  ADB  will  use  CRAM  frames  to  monitor  the  activities  in  recruiting  the \nconsultant  and  to  avoid  delays.  Indicative  CRAM  frames  based  on  forecasted  scheduling  of \nrecruitment for consulting packages have been provided to MCTPC. ADB will send a copy of the \nCRAM frame for the assignment to MCTPC. MCTPC\u2019s Consultant Selection Committee (CSC) \nshort-listing  meeting  will  discuss  and  confirm  the  CRAM  schedule.  When  MCTPC  submits  its \nCSC  meeting  documents  to  ADB  for  approval,  the  CRAM  frame  will  be  included.  When  ADB \napproves  the  EA\u2019s  technical  evaluation  and  financial  evaluation/overall  ranking,  ADB  will  send \nthe  EA  an  updated  CRAM  frame.  The  responsible  MCTPC  staff  will  monitor  the  recruitment \nprocess and reports to the ADB project officer the date when each activity is completed and the \nreason for any delays.   \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n39\n\nA. \n\nExisting Traffic \n\nTRAFFIC FORECAST \n \n\nTraffic Forecast \n\nSeasonally adjusted base year traffic counts were conducted by the consultants during \n1. \nthe  project  preparatory  technical  assistance,  and  used  in  the  traffic  forecast  analysis  and \neconomic  assessments  for  each  section  of  the  project  road.  Average  traffic  volume  on  the \nproject road varies significantly, with present levels ranging from a high of about 2,250 vehicles \nper day near the provincial capital of Xaignabouri to a low of about 130 vehicles per day on a \nremote part of the northern section and on the southernmost section, where the road ends.  \n  \nB. \n \n2. \nForecasts  by  traffic  and  vehicle  type  were  prepared  for  the  project  road  sections  for \n2007\u20132032.  The  forecasts  are  based  on  expected  growth  in  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in \nthe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) and international trade in the region, and on \nincome elasticities of demand. The traffic forecast for representative sections of the project road \nis  summarized  in  Table  A7.1.  Total  traffic  is  forecast  to  grow  at  annual  rates  of  about  15.4\u2013\n16.7% during 2007\u20132017 (the years during and immediately following project implementation), \nexcept  for  the  section  including  the  bridge,  which  has  higher  growth.  These  high  growth  rates \nare  due  in  large  part  to  the  development  of  generated  traffic  following  project  completion. \nInternational  traffic,  in  particular,  is  expected  to  grow  at  a  high  rate  during  this  period  as  the \nimproved road allows for trucks and other vehicles to travel throughout the year. Total traffic is \nforecast  to  grow  at  annual  rates  of  about  6.8\u20138.6%  during  2017\u20132032.  The  projected  growth \nrates are considered reasonable, considering expected economic growth in the project area and \nexperience on other road projects financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Two recent \nevaluations  of  ADB-financed  road  improvement  projects  in  Lao  PDR  found  that  actual  traffic \nlevels  have  exceeded  forecast  levels  by  large  margins.  The  project  completion  report  for  the \nXieng Khouang Road Improvement Project concluded that actual annual growth rates for traffic \nranged from 25% to 36% from 1997 to 2005 compared to annual growth rates of 6\u20139% forecast \nat  appraisal. 1  The  project  performance  evaluation  report \nthe  Champasack  Road \nImprovement  Project 2 found  that  actual  average  daily  traffic  5  years  after  project  completion \nwas three times higher than forecast at appraisal.   \n  \n3. \nGenerated traffic arises from increased shipments of agricultural commodities and other \ngoods and increased bus traffic carrying tourists between Thailand and Louangphrabang. The \nimproved  road  conditions  will  also  generate  demand  through  lower  fares  arising  from  lower \nvehicle operating costs. Normal traffic is expected to account for 40\u201360% of total traffic on the \nproject  road.  Generated  traffic  comprises  35\u201343%  of  total  traffic.  Diverted  traffic  results  from \ntraffic  shifting  to  the  project  road  from  other  roads,  particularly  Route  13  from  Vientiane  to \nnorthern Lao PDR, which passes through mountainous terrain and has steep slopes and sharp \ncurves. Diverted traffic comprises a relatively small portion of total traffic at 5\u201320%. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nfor \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2006.

Traffic  by  vehicle  type  on  representative  locations  of  the  project \nroad  is  shown  in  Table  A7.2.  The  prevalence  of  motorcycles  reflects  the  economic  status  of \npeople  in  the  project  area.  Incomes  have  increased  to  the  point  at  which  motorcycles  are \nreplacing  nonmotorized  vehicles,  but  not  to  the  point  at  which  households  can  afford  cars  or \nother two-axle vehicles. Trucks are more prevalent on section 4 and the southern part of section \n1. In 2017, trucks of all sizes are projected to comprise about 40% of total vehicles on section 4, \nwhich  includes  the  Lao  PDR-Thailand  border  crossing  at  Kenthao.  The  large  proportion  of \ntrucks on this section is due to their use in transporting agricultural and other exports from the \nproject area to Thailand. The prevalence of trucks in the southern part of section 1 is due largely \nto  the  low  level  of  population  in  this  area  and  the  associated  low  levels  of  motorcycles  and \nnonmotorized vehicles.  \n \n\nTable A7.2: Actual and Projected Traffic Volume by Vehicle Type  \n(vehicles per day) \n \nCars \nand \nJeeps\n\nMotorized \nTricycles and\nSmall Tractors\n\nMedium\nand Large\nTrucks\n\nSmall\nTrucks\n\nMotorcycles\n\nBuses\n\nYear\n\nNonmotorized\nVehicles\n\n        \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n      \n\nSection 1 Xiengngeun to M.

In the without-project scenario, the road is assumed to remain in its \npresent  condition.  The  with-project  scenario  includes  routine  and  periodic  maintenance \naccording  to  international  standards.  The  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  considered \nvarious  mutually  exclusive  project  alternatives,  such  as  different  pavement  types  and \nalignments, and the proposed Project is based on the most cost-effective and least-cost option. \nThe economic analysis covers 25 years (2008\u20132032), based on a 6-year implementation period \nwith most work being completed during the first 5 years. All benefits and costs are in constant \n2007 prices. The economic prices are expressed using the world price numeraire. \n \nB. \n\nCosts \n\nProject  economic  costs \n\nthe  resource  costs  of  road \n\nimprovement  and \ninclude \n2. \nmaintenance,  equipment,  and  consulting  services.  Price  contingencies, \ninterest  during \nconstruction,  and  taxes  and  duties  are  excluded.  Costs  were  divided  into  tradable  and  non-\ntradable portions. A standard conversion factor of 0.9 was applied to the non-tradable portion. \nTo take into account local unemployment and underemployment, costs for unskilled labor were \nadjusted by a shadow wage rate factor of 0.9 to arrive at the economic opportunity cost. \n \nC. \n\nBenefits \n\n3. \nThe primary economic benefits for the Project are vehicle operating cost (VOC) savings \nfrom normal, generated, and diverted traffic; time savings; savings from improved road safety; \nand  savings  from  reduced  maintenance  costs.  Economic  benefits  were  calculated  using  the \nsame methodology used for costs. VOC savings will accrue primarily from improvements in the \nroad  surface,  and  horizontal  and  vertical  alignment.  Unit  economic  VOCs  for  nine  types  of \nvehicles were estimated using the Highway Design and Maintenance Standards Model-IV, and \nrepresentative VOCs are shown in Table A8.1. VOC savings for normal traffic account for about \n39%  of  total  benefits  while  benefits  from  generated  traffic  account  for  about  22%.  Generated \ntraffic  is  defined  as  new  traffic  induced  from  the  reduction  in  transport  costs  arising  from  the \nProject,  and  includes  both  international  and  domestic  generated  traffic.  Benefits  for  generated \ntraffic are estimated at half the value of VOC savings for normal traffic. Benefits from diverted \ntraffic arise from the diversion of traffic from other roads in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \n(Lao PDR), particularly Route 13 from Vientiane to northern Lao PDR. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n43\n\n \n\n \n\nTable A8.1: Representative Vehicle Operating Costs by Vehicle Type \n($ per vehicle-km)  \n \n\nWithout Projecta \n\nWith Projectb \n\nVOC Savings \n\n \n0.195 \n0.270 \n0.381 \n0.197 \n0.458 \n0.764 \n\n \n0.170 \n0.211 \n0.299 \n0.169 \n0.339 \n0.568 \n\n \n0.025 \n0.059 \n0.082 \n0.027 \n0.119 \n0.196 \n\n  Item \n  Rolling Terrain \n  Car \n  Bus Medium \n  Bus Heavy \n  Truck Light \n  Truck Medium \n  Truck Heavy \n\nkm = kilometer, VOC = vehicle operating cost. \na Corresponding to an international roughness index of 10. \nb Corresponding to an international roughness index of 2. \nSource: Technical assistance consultants estimates. \n\n \n4. \nTime  savings  account  for  about  19.5%  of  total  benefits,  and  include  savings  in \npassenger and freight time. The Project will result in improved average speeds along the project \nroad, e.g., from 56.1 kilometers per hour (km/hour) to 82.8 km/hour for a car. The travel time for \nthe entire length of the project road will be reduced from about 8.0 hours to 5.0 hours. The value \nof time saved by passengers traveling during work time was calculated at $0.28 per hour, based \non  an  estimate  of  passengers\u2019  average  annual  income.  This  value  was  also  used  for  people \ntraveling during leisure time since no data on people\u2019s willingness to pay for travel time savings \nin Lao PDR was available. The value of time saved for freight is assumed at $1.58/vehicle-hour \nfor light trucks, $7.09/vehicle-hour for medium trucks, $9.45/vehicle-hour for heavy trucks, and \n$0.24/vehicle-hour for motorcycles and motorized tricylces. Benefits from improved road safety \nand  reduced  maintenance  costs  comprise  smaller  portions  of  total  benefits.  Savings  in  road \nmaintenance  costs  are  based  on  the  routine  maintenance  necessary  to  maintain  an \ninternational roughness index of 10, including grading of the current earth surface of the road. \nSavings  from  improved  road  safety  arise  from  the  reduced  number  of  accidents  per  vehicle-\nkilometer  on  the  improved  road,  and  in  the  severity  of  accidents.  The  cost  per  accident  was \nestimated at $1,165, based on government statistics. The Project will also have other benefits, \nsuch as improved access to social services, but these have not been quantified because of the \nlack of sufficient data. \n \nD. \n\nResults of Economic Analysis \n\n5. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated for the Project. The EIRR for \nthe  Project  is  16.6%,  and  the  net  present  value  is  $22.3  million,  using  a  12%  discount  rate \n(Table A8.2).

The \nsensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the  EIRR  exceeds  the  level  of  12%  in  all  cases.  Even  if  there \nwere  no  generated  traffic,  the  EIRR  remains  above  12%.  In  order  to  determine  the  degree  of \nuncertainty of the Project, a risk analysis was carried out. Key variables, e.g., costs and traffic \ngrowth rates, were assigned a random value within defined limits based on assumed probability \ndistribution  functions.  A  Latin  Hypercube  type  random  sampling  was  used,  and  the  simulation \nrun was made with 500 iterations to generate the probability distribution of the EIRR. The results \nshow that the probability that the EIRR will fall below 12% is less than 4% and that the EIRR is \nthus robust. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n45\n\n \n\n \n\nTable A8.3: Sensitivity Analysis \n \nEIRR \n(%) \n16.6 \n16.1 \n15.4 \n15.9 \n13.9 \n14.4 \n13.3 \n15.8 \n\nItem \n \nBase case \n1 year implementation delay \nNormal traffic (20%) \nGenerated traffic (20%) \nTotal benefit (20%) \nCapital costs +20% \nNormal traffic (20%); capital costs +20% \nMaintenance at 50% \n( ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, ENPV = economic net present value. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and technical assistance consultants estimates. \n \n\nENPV \n($ million) \n22.306 \n19.648 \n16.198 \n18.786 \n8.515 \n13.249 \n7.141 \n16.700 \n\nSwitching Value \n(%) \n \n \n73 \n \n32 \n49 \n \n \n\nF. \n\nDistribution Analysis \n\n7. \nDistribution  analysis  was  carried  out  in  order  to  examine  the  Project\u2019s  impact  on \nbeneficiaries,  using  the  same  EIRR  methodology  and  assumptions  for  discount  rate,  price \nnumeraire,  constant  price,  and  standard  conversion  factor  adjustment.

A  resettlement  plan  (RP)  has  been \nprepared for the whole length of Route 4 and the Mekong River. For the rural access roads, the \nMinistry  of  Communications,  Transport,  Posts,  and  Construction  (MCTPC)  has  identified \n15 potential rural access roads, but their prioritization and selection for project financing will only \nbe done during grant implementation. Therefore, a resettlement framework has been prepared \nto  guide  in  preparation  and  implementation  of  RPs  for  all  rural  access  roads  with  land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts.  \n \nB. \n  \nThe Road Law, 1999, sets the right-of-way for  Route 4 at 25 meters (m) either side of \n2. \nthe  centerline.  For  this  Project,  specifically  sections  1\u20134,  a  carriageway  width  of  7.0  m  plus \n1.0 m sealed shoulders is proposed for flat and rolling terrain while a carriageway width of 6.0 m \nplus 0.5 m shoulders is proposed for mountainous terrain. For resettlement planning purposes, \ni.e.,  to  minimize,  if  not  avoid,  resettlement  impacts,  a  corridor  of  impact  of  12  m  has  been \nadopted  wherever  possible.  In  section  5,  where  the  road  will  continue  to  be  primarily  for  local \nuse,  a  corridor  of  impact  of  about  6  m  was  used.  The  project  road  passes  through  about  120 \nvillages.  However,  physical  displacement  from  assets  will  only  be  required  in  36  of  these \nvillages. The RP identified 255 affected households (AHs), of which 232 are along the proposed \nproject road and 23 at the site of the bridge. Of the 232 AHs, 224 are households, while the rest \nare  institutions  (government  bodies)  or  private  organizations.  The  highest  percentage  loss  of \nany  of  the  65  affected  paddy  lands  represents  just  7.5%  of  the  AHs\u2019  total  agricultural  land \nholdings. Minimal impact on AH production and income is expected. Other affected properties \nare residential, fishpond, and some village land (nonproductive barren plot). \n \n3. \nAs to affected main structures (excluding houses where the porch or awning is the only \naffected part of the structure), there are 65 dwelling units (58 are used purely for residence and \n7  are  house-cum-shops)  and  33  shops.  Of  these,  31  of  the  houses  used  solely  for  residence \nand  3  of  the  house-cum-shops  will  be  totally  affected.  However,  only  6  of  the  totally  affected \ndwelling units used solely for residence have to be relocated, either to other land owned by the \nAHs (3 AHs) or to village-allocated land (3 AHs). Of the 3 totally affected house-cum-shops, 1 \nwill be relocated on another plot of the AH; for the 2 others, the shops will be reorganized on the \nunaffected portion of the AHs\u2019 land while the houses will be relocated in other plots of the AHs. \nOf the 33 affected shops, 15 are totally affected. With one exception, the totally affected shops \nwill only have to move back on AHs\u2019 residual land. Other affected structures are 21 rice bins and \n7  small  rice  mills.  Relocation  of  171  electricity  poles  and  restoration  of  38.3  linear  meters  of \nbrick  and  wire  fences  will  also  be  required.  Additionally,  238  trees  of  commercial  value \nbelonging  to  80  AHs  will  be  acquired.  For  the  Mekong  River  bridge,  23  households  will  be \naffected.  About  1.5 hectares  of  productive  and  residential  land,  of  which  teak  plantations \ncomprise 80%, will be acquired. Twelve households will be severely affected because of loss of \n10%  or  more  of  their  productive  land  (paddy  and  teak  plantation).  Five  of  the  nine  relocating \nAHs will have to relocate to new plots. The remaining 4 AHs can rebuild their houses on their \nresidual land. \n  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n47\n\n \n\n \n\nC. \n\nLegal and Policy Framework and Project Entitlements \n\n4. \nThe policy framework and entitlements are developed from the laws of the Government \nof  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR),  principally  the  Constitution,  1991;  Land \nLaw, 2003; and Road Law, 1999; various decrees,1 and the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  guided  by  the  Operations  Manual  on  Involuntary \nResettlement  (OM/F2,  2006).  Provisions  and  principles  adopted  in  the  RP  and  resettlement \nframework  will  supplement  the  provisions  of  relevant  decrees  currently  in  force  in  Lao  PDR \nwherever a gap exists. Key strategies to reconcile the differences are included in the RP. \n \n5. \nProject  entitlements  (Table  A9)  were  designed  to  cover  compensation  and  allowances \nfor  all  losses.  Voluntary  donation  will  only  be  applied  to  very  minor  losses  of  residential  land. \nVoluntary donation of small strips of residential land will be according to the following criteria: (i) \nthe total residential land area of the AH is not less than 300 square meters (m2); (ii) if the total \nresidential land area of the AH is more than 300 m2, the strip of land that can be donated cannot \nbe more than 5% of the total land area; and (iii) there are no houses, structures, or fixed assets \non the affected portion of land.   \n  \n\nTable A9: Project Entitlements \n \n\nEntitlements \n\nType of Losses \n\nProductive land \n(paddy, garden, \nand teak \nplantation) \n \n \n\nResidential land  \n  \n\nEntitled \nPersons \nLegal owner \nor occupant \nidentified \nduring IOL \n(cut-off-date) \nsubject to \nverification \nduring DMS  \n\nLegal owner \nor occupant \nidentified \nduring IOL \n(cut-off-date) \nsubject to \nverification \nduring DMS \n\nFor marginal loss of land, cash compensation at replacement \ncost\u2014equivalent to the current market value of land within the \nvillage, of similar type, category, and productive capacity, and free \nfrom transaction costs (taxes, administration fees).

AHs  may  also  opt  to \nreceive cash compensation to make their own arrangements for relocation. If any shops have to \nrelocate,  they  will  be  assisted  in  finding  viable  sites.  Households  that  are  severely  affected \nthrough  the  loss  of  10%  or  more  productive  assets  will  be  provided  with  replacement  land  or \nassisted in purchasing replacement land. AHs will also be provided with farm inputs to increase \nproductivity  on  remaining  land  and/or  replacement  land.  An  appropriate  livelihood  restoration \nprogram  will  be  designed  and  implemented  during  project  implementation  in  consultation  with \nAHs. AHs will not be displaced until the province allocates land within the same or neighboring \nvillage. \n \nE. \n\nEthnicity and Gender Issues \n\nParticular  attention  has  been  given  to  the  specific  needs  and  concerns  of  indigenous \n7. \npeoples  and  other  vulnerable  groups  such  as  the  landless;  poor;  and  households  headed  by \nwomen, disabled, elderly, or children without means of support. Actions specific to indigenous \npeoples  and  a  gender  strategy  are  included  in  the  RP:  (i)  active  participation  of  women  and \nethnic  minorities  from  consultation  to  monitoring,  (ii)  representation  of  women  and  ethnic \nminorities  in  resettlement  committees,  (iii)  capacity  building  targeting  women  and  ethnic \nminorities,  (iv)  a  gender  specialist  to  be  engaged  under  the  project  supervision  consultants, \n(v) monitoring  indicators  by  gender  and  indigenous  peoples  will  be  developed  for  monitoring, \nand (vi) the independent monitor will include female staff. \n \nF. \n\nParticipation, Grievance Redress, and Disclosure \n\nConsultations, public meetings, and village discussions with AHs and local officials were \n8. \ncarried  out  during  the  resettlement  planning  process.  These  activities  will  continue  during \nupdating  and  implementation,  and  will  follow  the  Project\u2019s  participatory  approach.  Prior  to \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nappraisal,  posters  providing  information  about  the  Project  in  general,  project  schedule, \nentitlements  to  compensation  and  assistance  to  replace  losses,  and  where  to  go  to  get \nadditional information were placed in conspicuous and accessible areas such as village offices, \nshops, and village bulletin boards along the road. The draft RP was disclosed to all AHs through \na  public  information  booklet  in  the  Lao  language  from  11\u201313  June  2007.  The  grievance \nmechanism  has  been  designed  to  ensure  that  the  concerns  and  grievances  of  AHs  are \naddressed  and  resolved  in  a  timely  and  satisfactory  manner.  AHs  will  be  made  fully  aware  of \ntheir rights verbally and in writing during consultation, survey, and at the time of compensation. \nThe  Project  Management  Division  (PMD),  Environment  and  Social  Department  (ESD),  and \nResettlement Committees will be responsible for the disclosure of the RPs to the AHs prior to \nsubmission  to  ADB.  The  draft  RP  has  been  uploaded  onto  ADB\u2019s  resettlement  website.  The \nfinal  RP  and  social  monitoring  reports  on  any  resettlement  will  also  be  uploaded  onto  ADB\u2019s \nwebsite. \n \nG. \n\nImplementation Arrangements, Monitoring, and Resettlement Budget \n\nESD will provide overall guidance and technical support to the resettlement committees. \n9. \nBefore  commencement of any land acquisition activities (i.e., before RP preparation/updating), \nresettlement specialists (1 international and 1 national), national gender and indigenous peoples \nspecialists,  and  3  community  mobilizers  under  the  project  implementation  consultants  will  be \nmobilized to assist in updating the RP and preparing RPs for the rural access roads. They will \nalso  assist  during  implementation  and  monitoring  of  the  approved  RPs.  An  independent \nmonitoring  organization  will  also  be  engaged  and  mobilized  before  commencement  of  land \nacquisition activities.  \n \n10. \nESD  will  submit  resettlement  progress  reports  to  ADB  on  a  quarterly  basis,  including \nfinancial  audit  statements  of  government  and  grant  funds  for  resettlement.  The  independent \nmonitoring organization will submit quarterly reports for the first year and semiannual reports for \na  further  year  on  the  progress  of  implementation,  including  recommendations  regarding  the \nissues  identified.  The  estimated  cost  of  resettlement  for  Route  4  including  the  Mekong  River \nbridge  is  $145,600.  This  includes  compensation  for  land  and  non-land  assets,  allowances  to \nAHs, development of replacement plots for relocating AHs, operational/administration expenses, \nexternal monitoring, and contingencies. The costs may change upon completion of the detailed \nmeasurement  survey.  The  Government  will  provide  counterpart  funds  for  land  acquisition. \nCompensation \nreplacement  plots, \noperational/administration  expenses,  external  monitoring,  and  contingencies  will  be  financed \nunder  the  grant.  The  Government  will  ensure  timely  provision  of  counterpart  funds  for \nresettlement to meet any unforeseen obligations in excess of the resettlement budget estimates \nin  order  to  satisfy  resettlement  requirements  and  objectives.  Rental  of  contractors\u2019  working \nspace  and  bypass  routes,  payment  for  impacts  on  non-land  assets,  and  land  leveling/filling  of \nreplacement land and restoration of the fishpond will be included in the bid documents. \n \nH. \n\nfor  non-land  assets,  allowances,  development  of \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\nPreparation and updating of the RP will be done by contract package following detailed \n11. \ndesign,  including  contracts  financed  by  co-financiers.  All  resettlement  activities  will  be \ncoordinated with the civil works schedule. ADB will not approve construction activities in specific \nsites involving land acquisition and resettlement until all resettlement activities for those specific \nsites  have  been  satisfactorily  completed,  agreed  rehabilitation  assistance  is  in  place,  and  the \nsite is free of all encumbrances.  \n  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n51\n\n \n\n \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n\nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic: \nIn the 2004 National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES), the Government\u2019s development goal is to exit \nthe country\u2019s status as a least developed country by 2020. The goals and strategies of the NGPES have been \nincorporated within the current Sixth Five Year Plan and Millennium Development goals. To meet the goals set for \n2020, rapid economic growth is being promoted to raise income levels. The Government has identified transport \ndevelopment as critical to achieving this development target. The NGPES has stated that the primary goal for \ntransport is to \u201cfully integrate the economy, thereby providing an enabling environment for trade and commerce and \naccess for all Lao People to basic services\u201d.a Poverty reduction is a key focus of the Government\u2019s current and long-\nterm (2020) development plan. Road access is considered one of the keys to eradicating poverty in the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic (Lao PDR) as discussed in the NGPES.  \n \nThe incidence of poverty nationally has reportedly declined from 46% in 1992 to just over 30% in 2005. The Laos \nExpenditure and Consumption Survey 2003 shows that both of the project provinces\u2014Louangphrabang and \nXaignabouri\u2014have consumption and income levels above the national average. Provincial data indicates that \nLouangphrabang\u2019s poverty incidence declined from 58.5% in 1993 to 40.8% in 1998 to 26.1% in 2004. Tourism and \ndiversification and commercialization of agriculture have contributed to progress in poverty reduction in the project \ndistricts.   \n  \nBy improving national and local roads, the Project will provide an enabling condition for poverty reduction through \nimproved access to markets, employment, advanced education, and health facilities. Upgrading of an all-weather road \nwill enhance benefits, enabling lower transport costs, and economic diversion through increased tourism, \ncommercialization of agriculture, and development of other service industries in the project districts. Improved access \nto markets will open up opportunities for expansion of locally produced goods and services. Construction and \noperation of roads will provide significant opportunities for poor people to get employment and income from \nconstruction work. It is estimated that 8,130 person-months of work will be created during project implementation, of \nwhich 5,420 person-months will be unskilled.  \n \n\n \n\nTargeting Classification: General Intervention \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe project area includes seven districts with a population of 311,000. Agriculture is the main source of employment in \nthe project area. The project road passes through largely agricultural areas that are in transition from production for \nsubsistence consumption and for local markets to more export-oriented commercial agriculture (maize, sesame, \npeanuts, mulberry fiber) and teak plantation. In addition to agriculture, other economic activities include small furniture \nfactories, brick factories, saw mills, rice mills, noodle factories, drinking water factories, meat processing factories, ice \nfactories, cross-border trade, small-scale river sand and gravel extraction, etc. \n \nHealth data indicate that infant mortality has fallen because of a donor agency\u2019s village health program, which ended \nin 2005. Coverage of immunization has increased. There are district level hospitals in Xaignabouri and  \nLouangphrabang. Only a few villages have health centers and dispensaries. Access of the rural population to district \nhospitals is limited because of poor road conditions. Interviews with people in the project area indicate that respiratory \nhealth problems are common because of dusty road conditions. Pregnant women from rural communities face severe \nconstraints receiving health services during pregnancy. \n \nLao PDR has a relatively low incidence of HIV/AIDS (about 0.08%). The number of reported cases at the end of 2005 \nwas 1,827 with HIV and 432 with AIDS (60% male and 40% female). The most affected ages are between 20 and \n35 years old. Lao Red Cross had provided HIV/AIDS prevention education programs in each project district, supported \nby the World Health Organization and Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere (CARE). A provincial \nprogram that supports awareness of HIV/AIDS has been introduced in the project districts. Interviews with rural \ncommunities along the road indicate that relevant district staff have been visiting them every 3 months to discuss \nhealth issues.  \n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nGenerally, one primary school serves two or three villages. Secondary schools are limited to the district towns or \nmunicipalities. All schools in 120 villages along the road reported to be understaffed and without essential resources. \nInterviews indicate that students attending secondary schools and living in boarding houses in town cannot visit their \nparents during weekends because of poor road conditions and lack of adequate public transport. Road conditions \ndiscourage many parents from sending their children to the district secondary schools.     \n \nImpact of the Project. It is expected that the upgrading of Route 4 will provide a strategic all-weather link that will \nfacilitate improved access to goods, markets, schools, medical facilities, and other social services for the project \ndistricts. The ability of the public sector to provide these services in a more cost-effective way could be increased \nbecause of improved access to the project road. The improved road condition will reduce dust pollution, which would \nhave a positive health impact on people from 120 villages along the road. Road improvement will play an important \nrole in reducing hazardous conditions for children walking several kilometers to school through very dusty roads. \nIncreased access to transport in the project districts would increase enrollment of children from rural areas in the \nsecondary schools in towns. Organization of local labor for the construction work for Route 4 and construction of the \naccess roads will provide a source of income for men and women laborers from poor households. Engagement of \nlocal labor for road maintenance by the local government will provide seasonal employment for poor communities. \n \nAlthough improved transport facilities will bring positive benefits, the improvement of roads and the border crossing \nare likely to have some negative socioeconomic impacts for people living along the road. Certain vulnerabilities could \nbe exacerbated by the increased accessibility, trade, and traffic. The ensuing economic development has the potential \nto increase inequalities within the communities by excluding some members from gaining these benefits because of \nlack of financial resources, skills, and knowledge. There will be some adverse impacts for people who are directly \naffected by resettlement. Potential socioeconomic impacts are (i) escalating land prices caused by the road \nimprovements, concentration of landownership in the vicinity of the border, and potential displacement of local \nresidents from the area; (ii) increased traffic risks for people living and working along the road caused by large \nvolumes of traffic and higher vehicle speeds along the improved road; (iii) increased risks of exposure to HIV/AIDS \nand trafficking of women and children during construction activities and because of large volumes of transit traffic \nalong the road and border area; (iv) increased flow of illegal drugs and number of drugs users in the project area as \nroad improvements provide more favorable routes for drug dealers; and (iv) increased number of road accidents \ncaused by increased traffic and vehicle speeds.  \n \nThe Project will include an HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention of human trafficking program in the construction \ncamps, towns, and rural areas of the project districts. The awareness and prevention program includes: (i) advocacy \nactions on HIV/AIDS/sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and human trafficking prevention; (ii) information and \neducation campaigns for all ethnic groups in respective sociocultural contexts; (iii) provision of HIV/AIDS and STI \nmedical packages to clinics and medical centers along the road; (iv) developing community level contact persons for \ncommunity mobilization on HIV/AIDS awareness, prevention of human trafficking, and community monitoring; (v) \nmobilization of existing poverty programs on agriculture and village development for poor households, with special \nfocus on targeting indigenous peoples\u2019 households to minimize their vulnerability and potential risk of human \ntrafficking; and (v) developing project performance monitoring indicators on HIV/AIDS/STIs and human trafficking \nprevention by gender and ethnicity.  \n \nThe Project will include monitoring of social benefits, potential negative impacts, and indirect benefits. Disaggregated \nmonitoring indicators by ethnic groups and gender will be used. \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nVarious public consultation and participation activities have been carried out for the Project since mid-2006 and the \nrole of each stakeholder is identified. The Department of Roads (DOR), the project preparation technical assistance \nconsultants, and Asian Development Bank (ADB) missions have had formal and informal consultations with local \ncommunities and government agencies through meetings, household interviews, and workshops. In addition, \nhousehold interviews have been conducted in 120 villages along the alignment, manufacturing enterprises, and with \nvehicle passengers and drivers. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \nDuring implementation of the resettlement plan and the HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention of human trafficking \nprogram, active participation of men, women, all ethnic groups, local leaders, poor households, and vulnerable groups \nwill be ensured. The participatory strategy includes consultation meetings and capacity development \nworkshops/training on resettlement-related activities, awareness raising activities and community mobilization on \nHIV/AIDS awareness and human trafficking prevention, and community monitoring. \n \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n53\n\n \n\n \n\nD.  Gender Development \n\n  \nStrategy to maximize positive impacts on women: \n \nSituation of Women in the Project Area. Women in the project area suffer from gender biases, particularly in rural \nareas and among ethnic minorities. Women and girls are disadvantaged in terms of access to education and other \nsocial services. In the project area, women\u2019s literacy is below that of men. Among the ethnic groups, women from \nHmong indigenous peoples have a significantly lower literacy rate (39%) than men (57%). Women have less access to \nhealth care services in the project area\u2014especially pregnant women who face constraints seeking health care from \ndistrict hospitals during pregnancy because of poor road conditions. In recent years, a village-based primary health \ncare program by nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and a bilateral agency has led to a reduction in child and \nmaternal mortality in Xaignabouri Province. Women in the project districts play a major role in both subsistence and \ncommercial agricultural activities. Despite the reduction of slash and burn agriculture, there is still widespread planting \nof dry rice and crops on slopes in the project area. Women carry a heavy burden in both subsistence and commercial \nagriculture. Women from indigenous peoples groups also play a critical role in collecting non-timber forest products. \nAgricultural extension services and other support mechanisms for many women from indigenous peoples are limited \nbecause they do not speak Lao. Men from indigenous peoples groups mainly have access to agricultural extension \nservices. Women are entitled to inherit land titles but these are often not registered in the name of the woman because \nof (i) lack of knowledge of ownership rights, (ii) cultural reluctance on the part of women, (iii) lower levels of female \nliteracy, or (iv) lack of awareness of the problem on the part of certifying officers. In the project districts, women play a \nleading role in retail trade, vending, guesthouses, and restaurants. Small and medium-sized enterprises are mostly \nowned by women, but poor infrastructure has been a problem for women\u2019s enterprise in terms of capital and access to \nmarkets.  \n \nAlthough Lao PDR has a relatively low incidence of HIV/AIDS, transmission of communicable diseases and HIV/AIDS \nmay increase in the project area because of the influx of construction workers and transit traffic, including cross-border \nmovements along the project road. Human trafficking is a serious issue in Lao PDR. A number of groups\u2014including \nLao Women\u2019s Union, Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare, NGOs and donor agencies\u2014are addressing trafficking \nissues, but data on the impact of the projects are sparse and more anecdotal than statistical. Construction and \noperation of the project road can increase the risk of human trafficking and HIV/AIDS/STIs for women and children. \nThe Project includes an HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention of human trafficking program. The Project will provide a \nstrategic all-weather link that will facilitate improved access to goods, markets, schools, medical facilities, and other \nsocial services by women. Interviews with women indicate that the improved road will provide them with access to \nlocal markets for agricultural products. The income and opportunities for women in roadside vending, food stalls, and \nsmall grocery stores will also be increased. There will be increased opportunities for women laborers in road \nconstruction work and road maintenance. The project districts have provisions for subcontracting local contractors for \nconstruction work, which would provide the opportunity to use local labor. The districts have a regular road \nmaintenance program that is targeted at men and women from poor households. The gender strategy is to help \nwomen from affected households to secure access to compensation resources under the resettlement plan, to \nminimize the potential risk of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking in the communities, and to provide women with income \nopportunities in road construction and maintenance. \n \n\u2022  The district resettlement committees will include representatives from the District Women\u2019s Union, women from \n\naffected households, and representatives from indigenous peoples groups.  \n\n\u2022  At the inception of the Project, a capacity building training program/workshop (as part of consultation) will be \n\ndesigned for district officials and people; and will include information on resettlement activities, compensation, and \ngrievance procedures. The participation of poor women will be ensured in the training, which will also include \nrepresentatives from the Executing Agency and line agencies responsible for resettlement; and representatives from \nthe provincial Women\u2019s Union, Youth Union, and District Women\u2019s Union involved in resettlement committees to \nincrease their understanding of implementing resettlement activities.   \n\n\u2022  The capacity building training/workshop (as part of consultation) on resettlement, compensation, and grievance \n\nprocedures issues will be conducted separately for indigenous peoples\u2019 groups; separate training/consultation will \nbe organized for women from indigenous peoples\u2019 households. \n\n\u2022  Compensation money/resource (in kind or cash) will be provided to both men and women from the affected \n\nhouseholds. It will be ensured that indigenous women and men receive fair compensation. Specific attention will be \ngiven to poor, vulnerable, and women-headed households in paying the compensation on time.   \n\n\u2022  The resettlement plan will encourage joint registration of land rights in the names of husband and wife in instances \n\nwhere land is acquired. \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n\u2022  An HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention of human trafficking campaign, including capacity building, will be \n\nconducted during the construction and post-construction phase by the construction contractors, provincial and \ndistrict committees for the control of AIDS, and Lao Women\u2019s Union with the active involvement of communities, \nrelevant government agencies, and NGOs. The Women\u2019s Union, Youth Union, health workers, female community \nleaders and members, and women from affected households will be involved in monitoring the program at the local \nlevel. The educational materials, workshop, and campaign on the HIV/AIDS and human trafficking prevention \nprogram will be customized for indigenous peoples. \n\n\u2022  All employment for the Project will respect gender equality, including staffing in the project implementation unit and \n\nresettlement committees. \n\n\u2022  Disaggregated monitoring indicators by gender and indigenous peoples will be developed for monitoring of social \n\nbenefits, economic opportunities in the project area, road safety, resettlement activities, and the HIV/AIDS \nawareness and prevention of human trafficking program. \n\n \nHas an output been prepared? \n\u2022  A national gender specialist is included in the consulting services for implementation of the above gender strategy. \nA consultant for the HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention of human trafficking program will coordinate with the \ngender specialist to implement the gender strategy.

The indigenous \npeoples\u2019 groups were relocated to the project area in 1970 \nbecause of war and as part of government relocation \nplans. They now practice sedentary agriculture, rice \nfarming, and have been involved in commercialization of \nagriculture. Although they retain their traditional culture, \nreligion, and social organization, they have also adopted \nmainstream language, education, and agricultural \npractices. The indigenous peoples affected account for \n40% of the total affected households.

An initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)  was  prepared  under  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance 1 (TA)  in  accordance  with  the  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines2 of ADB. The IEE was  prepared by the TA consultants and Ministry of \nCommunications, Transport, Posts, and Construction (MCTPC) and has been approved by the \nScience, Technology and Environment Agency. \n \nB. \n\nDescription of the Project \n\n2. \nThe Project comprises (i) improvement of 367 km of the project road from Xiang Ngeun \n(the  junction  with  National  Route  13  near  Louangphrabang)  to  Nakha  (on  the  border  with \nThailand), construction of a bridge over the Mekong River on the project road and improvement \nof about 100 km of rural access roads in the project area; (ii) procurement of equipment for use \nin operating the border post at Kenthao (now under construction) and for enforcement of axle-\nload  controls  on  the  project  road;  (iii)  consulting  services  for  construction  supervision  and \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  as  well  as  detailed  design  for  the  rural  access  roads;  (iv) \nmaintenance of the national road network by financing periodic road maintenance subprojects; \n(v)  improvement  of  road  safety  by  financing  consulting  services  to  continue  the  ongoing  road \nsafety  assistance  program;  and  (vi)  a  program  to  reduce  the  risks  of  HIV/AIDS  and  human \ntrafficking  that  may  develop  during  the  rehabilitation  and  operation  of  the  project  road.  The \nproject  road  (National  Highway  No.  4)  is  located  in  the  northern  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic \nRepublic  (Lao  PDR),  linking  the  two  northern  provinces  of  Louangphrabang  and  Xaignabouri. \nThe entire length of the project road (367 km) will be improved to a hard surface road (double \nbituminous  surface  treatment,  and  single  bituminous  surface  treatment  in  section  5).  The \nproposed alignment will generally follow the existing alignment, with some minor adjustments to \nprovide  suitable  curves  and  improved  line-of-sight.  Drainage  will  be  improved  with  ditches. \nImprovement  of  the  project  road  will  also  involve  reconstruction  and  maintenance  of  bridges, \nand  construction  of  box  and  pipe  culverts.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of \nabout 6 years, including pre-construction activities.   \n \nThe road has been separated into the following five sections: section 1: junction of Road \n3. \n13 to Pakkhone (59.7 km); section 2: Tha Deua to Nam Pui (80.99 km); section 3: Nam Pui to \nPaklai (99.93 km); section 4: Paklai to Lao PDR-Thailand Border (65.54 km); and section 5: Lao \nPDR-Thailand Border to Nakha (62.32 km). The proposed project road will be class III and V (in \nsection 5) with carriageway width between 4.5 meters (m) (in section 5) and 7.0 m with 1.0 m \nsealed  shoulders  and  formation  widths  of  between  8.5  (in  section  5)  and  12  m.  The  IEE \nboundaries for the road are, in general, 50 m on either side of a road centerline. For ecological \nimpacts determination, it is extended to 1 km on either side of the road centerline. For air and \nnoise impact prediction, it is extended to 50 m on either side of the road. The surface water IEE \nboundaries are 50 m downstream and 25 m upstream of any work site over the water. \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2005.

Dry  season  is  between  November  and \nMarch, and rainy season between April and October. During dry season, the weather cools and \nno rain may fall for several months. In the rainy season, the weather is hot with heavy rainfall. \nThe two project provinces are considered mountainous areas. About 98% of the total land area \nof  Louangphrabang  and  about  70%  of  the  total  land  area  of  Xaignabouri  are  classified \nmountainous. Since the project road is in a rural setting and passes through small villages, and \nthere  is  limited  industrial  development,  existing  air  quality  is  quite  good  with  the  exception  of \ntotal  particulate  matter  along  gravel  roads.  Noise  levels  are  relatively  low.  There  are  no \nsignificant wetland areas or ponds in the project area. \n \n\n2. \n\nEcological Resources \n\n5. \nThere  are  15  protected  areas  located  in  project  districts.  These  include  Nam  Pouy \nNational  Biodiversity  Conservation  Area  (NBCA),  and  14  Provincial  Protected  Areas.  In  the \nvicinity  of  the  project  road,  the  forests  consist  mainly  of  planted  teak,  scrubs,  and  degraded \nsecondary  forests  that  have  been  developed  into  agricultural  land  for  rice,  teak  plantations, \ngardening, and shifting cultivation. Undisturbed secondary forests are found far from the project \nroad.  NBCA  is  not  anticipated  to  be  directly  affected  by  the  Project  since  rehabilitation  of  the \nproject road is limited to the existing alignment, with some minor adjustments, and no additional \nroad segments or new alignments are planned within the NBCA. The distance between the road \nalignment  and  NBCA  at  the  nearest  point  is  approximately  0.6  km.  Thus,  NBCA  including  its \nbuffer zone will not be encroached upon by road widening and alignment adjustment activities. \nThe  14  Provincial  Protected  Areas  are  located  farther  away  and  will  not  be  impacted  by  the \nProject. Presence of rare and endangered species in the project vicinity has not been reported. \n \n\n3. \n\nEconomic Development \n\nWithin the project area, there is a range of small- and medium-scale industrial activities. \n6. \nThese include a number of furniture factories; agro-processing industries, including distilleries; \nmeat  processing  plants;  drinking  water  factories;  and  other  factories  such  as  noodle  factories, \nice  factories,  bakeries,  and  rice  mills.  Service  industries  include  print  shops,  TV/radio  repair, \nwatch repair, and garages. Construction-related industries include sawmills, small brick factories, \na  number  of  small  river-sand  and  gravel  extraction  operations,  and  rock  crushing  enterprises. \nAgriculture is the main source of income for local people. \n \n \nLouangphrabang  city  of  Louangphrabang  Province  is  the  most  important  tourism \n7. \nattraction  in  Lao  PDR,  and  has  been  a  World  Heritage  Site  since  1995.  Xaignabouri  Province \nhas  little  tourism.  In  the  project  area,  a  number  of  tourism  sites\u2014both  open  and  under \ndevelopment\u2014are located near Route 4 and will have an increased number of visitors because \nof the road upgrading. \n  \n\n4. \n\nSocial and Cultural Resources \n\nLand acquisition for the Project will affect the assets of about 290 households along the \n8. \nroad. The losses will include agricultural land, residential land, structures, trees, and crops. The \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nresettlement plan defines these losses and all compensation measures. No historical, cultural, \nor archaeological sites will be affected by the Project. \n \nD. \n\n \nForecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n9. \nThe Project is not anticipated to cause major adverse environmental impacts since it will \nmainly involve rehabilitation of the existing road alignment. The majority of the impacts identified \nwill  be  experienced  during  the  construction  period,  so  they  are  largely  temporary  in  nature. \nPotential  impacts  include  soil  erosion  caused  by  earth  movement,  damage  to  agricultural  land \nas  a  result  of  improper  spoils  disposal,  loss  of  vegetation  and  habitat,  air  and  noise  pollution, \nwater pollution, health and safety risks, and traffic disruption.   \n \nThe mitigation measures identified in the IEE\u2019s environmental management plan (EMP) \n10. \ninclude (i) restoration of affected areas, e.g., borrow pits, after project completion; (ii) avoiding \naggravation of soil erosion-prone areas; (iii) controlling sewage discharge and other waste fluids \nfrom  construction  sites,  and  hazardous  and  toxic  materials  from  bitumen  plants  and  from \nconstruction  equipment;  (iv)  maintaining  proper  drainage  to  avoid  stagnation  and  controlling \ndownstream water pollution; (v) topsoil removal and reinstallation for revegetation on completion \nof  road  improvement  works;  (vi)  minimizing  noise,  dust,  emissions,  and  other  pollutants \nassociated  with  civil  works;  and  (vii)  provision  of  adequate  road  access  during  construction. \nDetailed  information  on  environmental  impact  and  mitigation  measures  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix  E.  The  civil  works  contractors  will  implement  these  mitigation  measures.  The \nsupervision  consultant,  MCTPC  through  its  Environment  and  Social  Division  (ESD),  and \nconcerned  government  environmental  agencies  will  monitor  their  implementation.  The  cost  for \nenvironmental  mitigation  measures  is  estimated  at  $666,100  and  the  cost  for  environmental \nmonitoring and capacity development is about $137,600. \n  \n11. \nThe Nam Pouy NBCA is not anticipated to be directly affected by the Project, since road \nrehabilitation  is  limited  to  the  existing  alignment,  and  no  additional  road  segments  or  new \nalignment is planned within the NBCA. At the nearest point, the distance between the NBCA\u2019s \nbuffer zone and the road alignment is approximately 0.6 km. Thus the NBCA, including its buffer \nzone,  will  not  be  encroached  on  by  road  widening  and  alignment  adjustment  activities. \nNonetheless, enforcement of wildlife regulations prohibiting illegal wildlife trade, especially trade \nin endangered species for the NBCA, will be strengthened under the Project. The strengthening \nwill  be  implemented  by  the  NBCA  management  unit  through  a  checkpoint  operation  on  the \nproject  road,  regular  patrolling,  and  a  wildlife  awareness  campaign  among  local  people.  The \nbudget will be covered by the Project and is included in the environmental mitigation cost. \n \n12. \nPositive  impacts  that  may  be  attributed  to  the  Project  because  of  the  provision  of  a \nsealed all-weather road are (i) elimination of heavy road dust emission, thereby reducing safety \nrisks  caused  by  extremely  poor  road  visibility;  (ii)  reduced  dust-associated  health  risks  to \nroadside  communities;  (iii)  improved  living  conditions;  (iv)  reduced  transport  costs;  and \n(v) increased economic growth in the project area and the region.   \n \nImplementation  of  the  Project,  in  conjunction  with  other  Greater  Mekong  Subregion \n13. \n(GMS) road projects and other development activities in the corridor, may result in the following \ncumulative impacts, over a longer time frame and beyond the project area: (i) an increase in air \npollutants  and  greenhouse  gas  emissions;  (ii)  land  use  changes  caused  by  improved  access \nand economic growth; (iii) increased demand for and potential contamination of water resources; \n(iv) overall aesthetic transformation of the landscape; (v) changes in land values; (vi) improved \nhealth and sanitation conditions of residents because of better access; (vii) increased HIV/AIDS  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n59\n\n \n\n \n\nand  sexually  transmitted  infection-related  public  health  risks;  and  (viii)  poverty  alleviation \nthrough trade promotion. \n \n14. \nPotential interventions for the identified cumulative impacts, which are beyond the scope \nof the IEE for the Project, may be formulated at a strategic and regional level and include: (i) a \nsectoral  and  corridor-wide  cumulative \nimpact  assessment  study;  (ii)  a  set  of  policy \nrecommendations addressing cumulative impacts; (iii) a set of mitigation or response programs \nwith  broader  temporal  and  spatial  dimensions  beyond  the  Project\u2019s  construction  site  and \nduration; and (iv) comprehensive review of development programs in land use, water resources, \nair quality, and public health and safety in response to the impacts to ensure the sustainability of \nthe Project. \n \nThe final decision on which rural access roads will be improved under the Project will be \n15. \nmade  during  implementation,  so  the  rural  access  roads  are  not  included  in  the  IEE.  MCTPC, \nwith the assistance of the supervision consultant, will conduct an environmental assessment of \nthe  candidate  rural  access  roads  based  on  the  environmental  assessment  and  review \nprocedure prepared for the rural access roads, which is in Supplementary Appendix F. The cost \nof  the  environmental  assessment  for  rural  access  roads  is  approximately  $10,000  and  is \nincluded  in  the  supervision  consultant\u2019s  budget.  Rural  access  roads  for  logging  or  mining\u2014or \nthose  passing  through  protected  forests,  protected  wetlands,  or  rare  habitats\u2014will  not  be \nselected. \n \nE. \n\nInstitutional Requirement and Monitoring Program \n\nTo  ensure  that  the  environmental  management  and  monitoring  produces  acceptable \n16. \noutputs, the following parties will fulfill their responsibilities for environmental management and \nmonitoring  as  described  in  the  IEE:  ESD;  Provincial  Science,  Technology  and  Environmental \nOffices;  Staff  in  the  Department  of  Communication,  Transport,  Posts,  and  Construction \nresponsible  for  environmental  and  social  issues;  project  management  unit;  construction \nsupervision consultant; contractor; and NBCA management unit. \n \n17.  MCTPC  will  ensure  that  (i)  the  EMP  provisions  are  incorporated  in  the  project  design \nand  specifications;  (ii)  environmental  clearance  or  approval  is  secured  from  the  Science, \nTechnology and Environment Agency prior to site works; (iii) the bidding documents include the \nEMP (i.e., mitigation and monitoring requirements) for implementation by contractors; (iv) EMP \nimplementation is monitored and results are reported regularly; (v) there is coordination among \nconcerned  parties  to  effectively  implement  the  EMP;  (vi)  additional  mitigation  measures  are \nimplemented  as  necessary;  and  (vii) appropriate  environmental  assessment,  along  with \nformulation  of  mitigation  measures  and  a  monitoring  program,  is  undertaken  should  there  be \nmajor changes in the project alignment, design, and specifications. \n \n18. \nThe contractor will be responsible for implementing the mitigation measures during the \nconstruction  phase.  Compliance  monitoring  will  be  carried  out  by  ESD  through  the  staff \nresponsible for environmental and social issues (to be assisted by the construction supervision \nconsultant)  to  assess  the  contractor\u2019s  compliance  with  the  EMP  provisions.  The  construction \nsupervision consultant will assess if the EMP prepared for the project road is also applicable to \nthe rural access roads and will include additional environmental controls, as necessary. \n \nTo monitor passengers and local people\u2019s compliance with wildlife regulations for NBCA \n19. \nin  the  Project\u2019s  operation  phase,  the  Project  will  support  ongoing  monitoring  of  the  NBCA \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nmanagement unit. This will ensure that the Project will not cause increased pressure on illegal \nwildlife trade, particularly trade in endangered species. \n \nF. \n\nPublic Consultation and Information Disclosure  \n\n20. \nA  number  of  consultation  meetings  were  held  during  the  environmental  assessment \nprocess between June and November of 2006. These meetings included members of relevant \ngovernment  offices  and  affected  people  along  the  project  road.  During  the  study  period, \nthe  NBCA \n59 government  offices  (including  District  Agriculture  and  Forestry  Offices, \nmanagement  unit,  and  District  Offices  of  Culture  and  Information);  and  82  village  chiefs  and \nvillagers  were  involved  in  discussions  related  to  the  proposed  Project.  Village  chiefs  and \nvillagers  were  generally  positive  about  the  proposed  upgrading  of  roads,  welcomed  the \nimprovement  on  some  impassable  sections,  and  would  like  to  see  environmental  regulations \nbetter  enforced  through  the  project  area.  Consultations  were  conducted  publicly  with  names, \ndates,  and  issues  documented;  and  the  records  are  in  the  appendix  of  the  IEE,  which  will  be \nposted  on  the  ADB  website.  The  consultants  informed  the  participants  that  during  the  project \nconstruction phase, copies of the IEE and its EMP and the environmental monitoring program in \nthe Lao language will be available at the District Office of Culture and Information, and copies \nmay  be  requested  by  any  of  the  participants  for  their  use  in  monitoring  progress  and  the \nimplementation of mitigation actions. \n \nG. \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\n21. \nThe  IEE  prepared  for  the  project  road  and  Mekong  River  bridge  crossing  provides  an \nassessment of potential impacts during various project phases. Mitigation measures to address \nsuch  impacts  are  contained  in  the  EMP,  which  can  be  adopted  by  any  co-financier  for  any \nportion  of  the  proposed  Project.  Based  on  findings  of  the  IEE,  the  potential  impacts  from  the \nProject are not considered significant. For various impacts identified during the construction and \noperation  phases,  corresponding  mitigation  measures  have  been  formulated.  Further,  impacts \nthat might occur during the construction phase are considered temporary. The indirect impact to \nthe  NBCA  in  the  operation  phase  is  considered  minor,  and  will  be  addressed  by  the  NBCA \nmanagement unit with support from the Project. Proper implementation of the EMP will ensure \nminimal impacts to the environment.  \n  \nH. \n\nConclusion \n\nResults  of  the  environmental  assessment  show  that,  with  proper  implementation  of  the \n22. \nEMP, the Northern GMS Transport Network Improvement Project will not cause adverse impacts \nto the environment. The IEE conducted for the Project is deemed sufficient and no additional or \nfollow-up environmental study is recommended. \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 29 August 2007) \n", "Currency Unit \n", "kip (KN) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "KN1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "$0.0001 \nKN9,560 \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "AADT \nADB  \nADF  \nAH \nASEAN \nCAPE \nCRAM \nDCPTC \n", "DMS \nDOR \nDOT \nEA  \nEIRR \nEMP \nESD \nGDP \nGMS \nICB \nIEE \nJICA \nLao PDR \nMCTPC \nNBCA \nNCB  \nNDF  \nNGO  \nNGPES \nNPV \nOFID \nPPMS \nPRC \nPSA \nQCBS \nRMF \nRMP  \nRP  \nSida \nSTI  \nTA  \nTSSS \nVOC \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "average annual daily traffic \nAsian Development Bank \nAsian Development Fund \naffected household \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations \ncountry assistance program evaluation \nconsultant recruitment activities monitoring \nprovincial department of communications, transport, posts, and \nconstruction \ndetailed measurement survey \nDepartment of Roads \nDepartment of Transport \nexecuting agency \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental management plan \nEnvironmental and Social Division \ngross domestic product \nGreater Mekong Subregion \ninternational competitive bidding \ninitial environmental examination \nJapan International Cooperation Agency \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \nMinistry of Communications, Transport, Posts, and Construction \nNational Biodiversity Conservation Area \nnational competitive bidding \nNordic Development Fund \nnongovernment organization \nNational Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy \nnet present value \nOPEC Fund for International Development \nproject performance management system \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \npoverty and social assessment \nquality- and cost-based selection \nRoad Maintenance Fund \nRoad Maintenance Project \nresettlement plan \nSwedish International Development Cooperation Agency \nsexually transmitted infection \ntechnical assistance \nTransport Sector Strategy Study \nvehicle operating cost \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies ends on 30 September. \nFY  before  a  calendar  year  denotes  the  year  in  which  the  fiscal  year  ends, \ne.g., FY 2006 ends on 30 September 2006.  \n", "(ii) \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", "Vice President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n", "C.
