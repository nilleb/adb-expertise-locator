The \nproject  will  also  (i)  improve  two  land  ports  at  Benapole  and  Burimari,  and  (ii)  strengthen  the \ncapacity  of  the  road  sector  and  the  land  port  operations.  By  increasing the  road  capacity  of  a \nmajor  international  trade  corridor  and  enhancing  land  port  capacity,  the  project  will  not  only \nboost the national economy but also facilitate subregional cooperation and increase trade.2 The \nproject has been endorsed by the SASEC trade facilitation and transport working group meeting \nheld in Kolkata on 5 March 2012. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  South  Asian  Association  for  Regional  Cooperation  (SAARC)  Summit  in  2010 \nrecognized  the  importance  of  transport  connectivity,  especially  for  landlocked  countries. \nAgreements  between  Bangladesh  and  India  in  2010  for  regional  connectivity  were  a  critical \nstepping stone for opening connectivity, not only between the two countries but also with Bhutan \nand  Nepal,  in  diversifying  international  transport  routes.  This  trend  is  expected  to  enhance \nsubregional markets and opportunities in South Asia, leading to balanced regional growth and \npoverty reduction.  \n \n4. \nBangladesh  has  the  potential  to  become  a  transport  and  transshipment  center  for  the \nsubregion. It borders India and Myanmar and is close to the landlocked countries of Bhutan and \nNepal,  and  Kunming\u2014the  southwestern  hub  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China.  With  the \nBhangabandhu Bridge over River Jamuna (the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge) and the provision \nof access to ports (i.e., Chittagong and Mongla), the Northwest\u2013Dhaka\u2013Chittagong corridor can \nfacilitate  trade  between  Bangladesh  and  the  northeastern  states  of  India,  the  Indian  state  of \nWest  Bengal,  Bhutan,  and  Nepal  and  thereby  have  the  potential  to  attract  more  foreign  and \ndomestic  investment  to  the  country.  Bangladesh  has  major  international  trade  corridors,  as \nidentified in the SAARC Regional Multimodal Transport Study3 and the Asian Highway Network. \nA  study  estimates  that  the  improvement  of  priority  regional  transport  corridors  in  Bangladesh \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.

Prepared  under  ADB.  2004. \nTechnical Assistance for Promoting South Asian Regional Economic Cooperation. Manila (TA 6187-REG). Among \nSAARC  priority  corridors,  Bangladesh  has  six  out  of  10  road  corridors,  two  out  of  five  rail  corridors,  and  two \nprincipal ports (Chittagong and Mongla) for SAARC trade. \n\n\fcould facilitate the movement of about 18 million tons of freight in Bhutan, India, and Nepal.4 A \nstudy shows that the impact of raising South Asia\u2019s trade facilitation performance to international \nlevels would result in large gains, i.e., intra-regional trade within South Asia would increase by \nalmost 60% and trade with the rest of the world would increase by over 30%.5  \n \n5. \nThroughout  South  Asia,  trucks  carry  a  substantial  majority  of  inland  freight.  Road \ntransport is central to the competitiveness of supply chains. An expansion in rail freight is both \ndesirable  and  possible,  but  the  absolute  importance  of  road  transport  is  unlikely  to  diminish, \nespecially  as  the  markets  for  higher  value  and  higher  volume  goods  increase  with  per  capita \nincomes.6 Therefore,  among  these  international  trade  corridors,  the  highest  priority  is  SAARC \nHighway Corridors (SHCs) 4 and 8, which provide Bhutan and Nepal with access to Bangladesh \nports (Chittagong and Mongla), including land ports. For trade between Bangladesh and India, \nBenapole  Land  Port  is  the  priority  to  be  improved  as  it  is  the  busiest  crossing,  providing \ntransshipment services for about 80% of the annual trade between Bangladesh and India. \n \n6. \nThe  road  network  in  Bangladesh  is  very  poor  in  terms  of  capacity  and  conditions,  and \nthe  demand  for  road  transport  is  rapidly  increasing.  Inefficient  implementation  of  road \nmaintenance  has  increased  both  the  number  of  roads  that  are  beyond  maintainable  condition \nand  the  backlog  of  deferred  maintenance.  A  mix  of  motorized  and  nonmotorized  traffic,  and \nencroachment  onto  roads,  results  in  higher  accident  rates.  To  address  these  constraints,  the \ngovernment  has  been  implementing  the  Road  Master  Plan,  2007\u20132026.  The  road  sector \ndevelopment  strategy  under  Bangladesh\u2019s  6th  Five-Year  Plan,  2011\u20132015  highlights  the \nimprovement  of  connectivity  by  upgrading  the  Asian  Highway  Network  to  four  lanes  to  boost \ntrade  and  commerce,  with  emphasis  on  three  arterial  corridors:  Dhaka\u2013Chittagong,  Dhaka\u2013\nNorthwest, and Khulna\u2013Northwest. The road sector strategy in the 6th Five-Year Plan includes \ninstitutional  changes  and  capacity  development  in  maintaining  the  existing  road  network, \naddressing road safety issues, improving land port connectivity, and controlling overload. \n \nADB financed the Road Network Improvement and Maintenance Project II7 and, together \n7. \nwith the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom (DFID) and the World \nBank,  has  suggested  a  reform  agenda  for  road  in  Bangladesh  covering  (i)  a  long-term  and \nintegrated  transport  policy,  (ii)  modernization  of  road  sector  institutions,  (iii)  road  maintenance \nfinancing, and (iv) private sector participation. The national land transport policy (supported by \nDFID)  and  the  road  master  plan  (supported  by  ADB)  have  been  approved  in  2004  and  2009, \nrespectively. The Ministry of Communications and the Roads and Highways Department (RHD) \nhave been restructured for focused operations. RHD, supported by DFID, has computerized its \nfinancial  management  and  asset  management  systems.  The  central  management  system  is \nbeing used in RHD divisions, resulting in expeditious and transparent payment processing, e.g., \nthe backlog of major unpaid contracts has been eliminated. The procurement capacity is being \nstrengthened under the World Bank\u2019s Public Procurement Reform II Project, utilizing the central \nmanagement  system  and  introducing  e-procurement.  Maintenance  financing  has  substantially \nincreased\u2014the  latest  approved  budget  for  FY2013  demonstrated  the  government\u2019s  policy \nemphasis on maintenance and rationalization of development work (i.e., increased by 37% from \nFY2012).  A  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP)  unit  was  established  in  RHD  and  pilot  PPP  road \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB.

Manila. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fprojects  have  been  identified.  The  overall  productivity  of  RHD  has  improved.8 The  project  will \ncontinue  to  support  the  reform  agenda  as  agreed  in  the  institutional  development  action  plan9 \nand the maintenance financing strategy.10 \n \nThe  Bangladesh  Land  Port  Authority  (BLPA)  administers  16  land  ports.  It  is  a  lean \n8. \norganization  and  financially  self-sustained  for  the  current  level  of  operational  efficiency  and \nvolumes,  mainly  by  outsourcing  development  and  operations  to  the  private  sector.  However, \ntaking into account the expected increase in trade among SASEC countries through land ports, \nit is urgently required to improve facilities to realize operational efficiency. \n \n9. \nThe project road is the common section of SHCs 4 and 8, and Asian Highway 2, carrying \nabout 15,000 vehicles per day, excluding two- and three-wheelers, making it the second busiest \nartery  in  Bangladesh  after  the  Dhaka\u2013Chittagong  road.  However,  this  road  section  has \nsubstantial bottlenecks because of limited capacity, pavement deterioration, and mixed traffic of \nslow-moving vehicles, resulting in many traffic accidents in accident-prone areas. Burimari Land \nPort  is  a  northwestern  end  point  of  the  Dhaka\u2013Northwest  corridor,  providing  a  gateway  to \nBhutan  through  India  via  SHC  8.  Benapole  Land  Port  is  the  busiest  land  port  at the  west  end \npoint of the Asian Highway 1 and SHC 1 in Bangladesh. Burimari and Benapole land ports are \ncomplemented by India\u2019s Integrated Customs Posts Program at Changrabandha and Petrapole.  \n \nIn parallel with the project, ADB is preparing (i) a SASEC Road Connectivity Project to \n10. \nimprove  two  priority  subregional  roads  in  India11 and  develop  land  customs  stations;  and  (ii)  a \nSASEC  Trade  Facilitation  Program  to  strengthen  the  soft  side  of  customs  and  cross-border \ntransport.  For  the  Dhaka\u2013Chittagong  corridor,  the  government  will  undertake  capacity \nexpansion  projects,  e.g.,  four-laning,  bridge  expansion  by  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency (JICA), railway doubling by ADB and JICA, and a possible expressway using PPP with \nADB support. ADB provided support to Chittagong Port efficiency improvement.12 ADB\u2019s Dhaka \nUrban  Transport  Project 13  and  other  government  projects  such  as  the  Dhaka  expressway \nproject will also help reduce the bottleneck in Dhaka. The proposed project, therefore, is part of \nthe critical development of physical infrastructure for connectivity in South Asia. \n \n11. \nThe project has been designed in coordination with JICA to ensure development synergy. \nThe  project  takes  into  account  lessons  from  past  projects, 14 mainly  start-up  delays,  delayed \nrelease of the counterpart funds, and limited capacity of contractors.  \n \nB. \n \n12. \nThe  impact  will  be  increased  domestic  and  regional  trade  through  Bangladesh.  The \noutcome  will  be  the  improvement  to  road  connectivity  and  efficiency  of  the  Dhaka\u2013Northwest \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n                                                 \n8  Total  kilometers  completed  under  the  development  and  maintenance  budget  per  engineer  have  increased  from \n\n4.5 km/engineer in 2004 to 7.9 in 2010.  \n\n9  Institutional Development Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n10 Maintenance Financing Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 Kakarvitta\u2013Panitanki\u2013Fulbari\u2013Banglabandha  road  (40  km)  for  Nepal\u2013India\u2013Bangladesh  connectivity  (Asian \nHighway  2  and  SHC  4);  and  (ii)  Phuentsholing\u2013Jaigaon\u2013Hasimara\u2013Changrabandha\u2013Burimari  road  (120  km)  for \nBhutan\u2013India\u2013Bangladesh connectivity (SHC 8). \n\n12 ADB. 2004.

It will enable efficient and \nsafe transport within the country and with India and, through India, with Bhutan and Nepal.  \n \nC. \n \n13. \nRoad  improvement.  The  government  will  upgrade  about  70  km  of  the  Joydeypur\u2013\nChandra\u2013Tangail\u2013Elenga Road, which is part of Asian Highway 2 and SHC 4 and 8, to a four-\nlane  highway  with  safety  features  including  a  separate  lane  for  slow-moving  traffic  and \nconstruction of flyovers at the busiest junctions. Civil works will be financed by ADB jointly with \nOFID  for  about  60  km  and  in  parallel  by  the  Abu  Dhabi  Fund  for  International  Development \n(ADFD) for about 10 km. The project implementation consultant (PIC) will be financed by ADB \nto support implementation of the entire 70 km road works. \n \n14. \nRoads and Highways Department (RHD) institutional development. The project will \nmodernize  RHD  headquarters  and  provide  equipment  and  consulting  services  in  line  with  the \ninstitutional  development  action  plan.  A  technical  assistance  grant  attached  to  the  project  for \ninstitutional development in RHD will be provided to support implementation of the action plan \n(para. 21). The TA consultants will identify the timing and details of equipment and services to \nbe procured under the loan. Equipment to be procured will include weighbridges and laboratory \nequipment. \n \n15. \nLand  port  improvement.  The  project  will  improve  two  land  ports  at  Benapole  and \nBurimari. For Benapole Land Port, which has a larger master plan comprising several modules, \nthe project will focus on those that will cater for the increasing trade volumes: (i) redevelopment \nof  old  sheds  including  road  access  and  drainage;  (ii)  redevelopment  of  the  old  truck  terminal \nyard,  and  (iii) construction  of  shelter  in  the  transshipment  area.  For  Burimari  Land  Port,  the \nproject  will  focus  on  more  effective  reconfiguration  of  traffic  flows,  and  provision  of  covered \nshipment  yards  for  perishable  goods.  The  PIC  will  undertake  detailed  design,  procurement \nassistance, construction supervision, and capacity development for operational efficiency. \n \nD. \n \nThe outputs under the  project and the parallel financing are estimated together to cost \n16. \n$344.7 million (Table 1). The detailed cost estimates by expenditure category and by financier \nare in the project administration manual.15 \n \nThe government has requested a loan (the ADB Loan) in various currencies equivalent \n17. \nto  SDR128,114,000  ($198  million  equivalent)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources16 to  help \nfinance the project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an \ninterest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter,  and \nsuch other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements.17 OFID will \nprovide a loan of $30 million to help finance the project (the OFID Loan). Administered by ADB \non  a  partial  administration  basis,18 the  OFID  loan  will  have  a  20-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod of 5 years, and an annual interest rate of 2.25% (inclusive of a 1.0% service charge). The \nOFID loan will partially finance the works. The government has also requested cofinancing (the \nADFD  Loan)  of  $30  million  from  ADFD,  which  has  provided  firm  commitments  for  parallel \ncofinancing, with its board approval  expected in December  2012. The ADFD Loan will have  a \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\n                                                 \n15 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Inclusive of $40 million equivalent from the subregional pool of the Asian Development Fund. \n17 Loan Agreement; Project Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Partial services by ADB limited to procurement and disbursement supervision. \n\n\f20-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2%. The ADFD Loan will \npartially finance the works and the contingencies. In the event that cofinancing from OFID is not \nsigned within 6 months following the effectiveness of the ADB loan, the government will take all \nnecessary and appropriate steps to make available all counterpart funds required for timely and \neffective  completion  of  the  project  whether  through  budget  allocations  or  other  arrangements \nacceptable  to  ADB.  In  the  absence  of  which,  the  government  and  ADB  will  scale  down  the \nscope of the project and if applicable to adjust the relevant financing arrangement.

The  implementation  period  will  include  pre-construction \nactivities,  the  construction  period,  and  the  initial  1-year  execution  of  the  performance-based \ncontract.  To  engage  quality  consultants  in  a  timely  manner,  ADB  and  the  government  have \nagreed  that  ADB  will  carry  out  consultant  selection  on  behalf  of  the  government.  The \ngovernment will retain its authority for contract negotiation and contract signing. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n21. \nTA  for  the  institutional  strengthening  of  RHD  will  support  some  of  the  government\u2019s \ninstitutional development initiatives set out in the action plan (footnote 9). The TA will have three \nmajor  components:  (i)  maintenance  scheme  for  roads  and  bridges;  (ii)  an  overloading  control \nscheme; and (iii) RHD modernization, covering institutional changes and streamlining business \nprocesses.19 As  part  of  the  capacity  development  for  procurement  processes,  the  TA  will  also \nsupport  a  procurement  review  to  be  undertaken  for  the  project.  The  TA  will  be  financed  on  a \ngrant  basis  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  in  the  amount  of  $1,500,000  and \nadministered by ADB. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical  \n\n \nA. \n \n22. \nThe  road  design  incorporates  recommendations  of  the  road  safety  audit,  including  a \nseparate  slow-moving  vehicular  traffic  lane,  flyovers  at  busy  intersections,  overpasses  and \nqueuing  lanes  at  intersections,  and  other  traffic  measures  for  vulnerable  road  users. \nEngineering  design  measures  minimize  the  land  acquisition  by  using  retaining  walls.  Climate \n\n                                                 \n19 Technical Assistance: Institutional Development of the Roads and Highways Department (accessible from the list \n\nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fEconomic and Financial \n\nresilient  design  standards20 will  be  adopted  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Climate  Proofing \nInvestment  in  the  Transport  Sector:  Road  Infrastructure  Projects.21 A  specific  climate  change \nstudy was carried out to be reflected in the final design (e.g., embankment level, bridge height, \nand  drainage  structures).  Tolling  has  been  discussed  but  not  yet  imposed  because  of  the \nunavailability of alternate roads.22 The possibility of tolling will be further explored during project \nimplementation with support of the TA consultant. \n \nB. \n \n23. \nThe  project  is  expected  to  (i)  facilitate  economic  development  of  northwestern \nBangladesh and subregional trade with Bhutan, India, and Nepal while reducing road accidents; \nand  (ii)  improve  the  transaction  efficiency  at  the  land  ports  to  facilitate  increased  import  and \nexport  trade  and  reduce  damage  to  goods  through  warehousing  facilities.  The  project  is \neconomically viable, with economic internal rates of return of 27.2% for the road and 32.8% for \nthe  land  ports.  Sensitivity  analysis  indicates  the  project\u2019s  economic  viability  would  remain \nsatisfactory even under several adverse scenarios. Incremental recurrent costs associated with \nthe road are estimated at about 5% of the current RHD maintenance budget and less than 1.5% \nof the overall RHD budget on an annual basis, which will be required after project completion on \n2016. The government  has assured that the road network will be maintained and reduced the \nbacklog maintenance in line with the maintenance financing strategy.  \n \n24. \nThe financial analysis in real terms indicates a financial internal rate of return of 5.1% for \nthe  land  port  improvement.  The  project  is  financially  viable  based  on  the  estimated  weighted \naverage  cost  of  capital  of  1.9%.  The  sensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  even  with  adverse \nvariations  in  costs  and  benefits,  the  project  remains  financially  viable.  Improved  port  facilities, \ninvestment  in  subregional  connectivity,  and  changes  in  government  policies  to  facilitate \nsubregional  trade  are  likely  to  achieve  higher  growth  than  the  medium-growth  scenario \nassumed in this analysis and thus have the potential to generate more surplus in the long term. \n \nC. \n \n25. \nInstitutional  and  financial  management.  RHD  has  the  experience  and  sufficient \ncapacity  to  implement  externally  funded  projects.  BLPA  is  new  to  externally  funded  projects. \nThe  consultant  will  support  both  RHD  and  BLPA.  On  financial  management,  RHD  has \nexperience of ADB disbursement procedures while BLPA does not. The project will also provide \nsupport to BLPA for training in ADB procedures and for computerization and training in financial \nmanagement  systems.  One  accountant  will  be  assigned  to  each  project  manager.  All \nrecommendations of ADB as to financial management assessment (such as computerization of \nthe  systems  (including  fixed  asset  register),  strengthening  internal  control  mechanism  and \nexpediting external audit, and monitoring the mechanism of budget and actual expenditure for \nbetter budgeting and control) will be implemented during the project. \n \n26. \nProcurement  and  anticorruption.  Recruitment  of  consultants  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime),  with  ADB  selecting  and  the  executing  agencies  negotiating  and  signing  (para.  20). \nNational procurement regulation has also improved through the Public Procurement Act, 2006 \nand  the  related  Public  Procurement  Rules,  2008  (with  subsequent  amendments).  The  World \nBank also supports capacity development in procurement under the Public Procurement Reform \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                 \n20 Summary of Design Standards (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21  ADB. 2011.

RHD and BLPA will publish on their websites (i) procurement information \nrelating  to  the  project,  including  business  opportunities;  and  (ii)  the  track  record  of  project \nimplementation.  To  enhance  good  governance  in  connection  with  the  ADB  and  OFID  loans, \n(i) design  consultants  under  the  ADB  TA  loan  will  provide  procurement  assistance;23 (ii) RHD \nand BLPA will involve in their procurement processes a procurement advisor to be engaged by \nADB;24 (iii)  ADB  will  monitor  procurement  activities  on  a  regular  basis;  and  (iv)  the  consultant \nunder  the  TA  grant  associated  with  the  project  will  undertake  a  procurement  review  of  the \nproject.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed  with  the  government  and  executing  agencies.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are in the project administration manual (footnote 15). \n \nD. \n \n27. \nThe  project  road  passes  through  two  districts  where  an  estimated  6.9  million  people \nreside. The social and poverty analysis found that project-affected persons were in favor of the \nproject  and  believed  the  road  will  contribute  to  regional  economic  and  social  development  by \nproviding better and uninterrupted transport to and from commercial centers. Immediate benefits \ninclude  employment  generation  in  construction  and  associated  activities.  Long-term  benefits \ninclude  reduced  transport  costs  and  increased  mobility,  increased  scope  for  higher  education, \ndiversification  in  agriculture  for  access  to  wider  markets,  lower  prices  of  farm  and  commercial \ninputs  and  less  spoilage  of  agricultural  produce,  and  improved  access  to  specialized  medical \nservices.  The \nin  Benapole  (49,000  population)  and  Burimari \n(25,000 population).  The  project  will  increase  the  efficiency  of  transshipment  practices  and \npotentially  contribute  to  increased  revenue  of  the  land  ports  and  a  growing  demand  for  local \ncommercial services, leading to an improved economic situation of the surrounding area. \n \nGender. Women will be encouraged to participate in civil works for the road component \n28. \nduring  the  construction  phase.  RHD  will  aim  to  employ  women  for  50%  of  labor  (about \n350 person-years)  for  road  maintenance.  For  the  RHD  building,  the  RHD  Gender  and \nDevelopment  Forum  will  be  involved  in  the  design  to  ensure  a  gender-friendly  working \nenvironment. \n \n29. \nSexually  transmitted  infections  and  human  trafficking.  Bangladesh  is  a  low-\nprevalence country for HIV/AIDS, with the incidence rate estimated to be less than 0.1% among \nthe  general  population.  The  3rd National  Strategic  Plan  for  HIV and AIDS Response  (2011\u2013\n2015) 25  formulated  by  the  National  AIDS/STD  Programme  continues  to  build  on  the \nachievements  of  the  previous  plans.  A  survey  conducted  in  the  project-affected  area  revealed \nthat  96%  of  households  are  aware  of  HIV/AIDS.  RHD  and  BLPA  will  conduct  awareness \nprograms  for  workers  on  the  health  risks  of  sexually  transmitted  diseases  and  the  detrimental \nsocial  and  health  impacts  on  women  and  children  by  disseminating  information  at  worksites. \n\nland  ports  are \n\nlocated \n\n                                                 \n23  ADB.  2010.

Within  the  land  port  compound, \nawareness  posters  will  be  posted  in  areas  frequented  by  truck  drivers  and  day  laborers.  In \nproject-affected communities, awareness programs will be conducted semiannually for men and \nwomen in separate groups to address specific needs from each group. \n  \nE. \n \nEnvironmental impact. Environment-related activities include enhancement of hygienic \n30. \nconditions in the land ports, construction of an environment-friendly office building for RHD, and \nexpansion  of  the  Joydeypur\u2013Chandra\u2013Tangail\u2013Elenga  Road.  All  three  components  fall  under \nenvironment  category  B.  Environmental  impacts  in  the  land  ports  and  RHD  office  building  are \nlargely  positive  and  include  establishment  of  structures  and  mechanisms  for  managing  waste, \ndrainage,  and  occupational  health and  safety. Negative  impacts  related  to  construction  waste; \nair,  noise,  and  water  pollution;  occupational  health  and  safety;  tree  removal;  and  erosion  are \nexpected  for  all  project  components.  However,  these  are  mainly  confined  to  the  construction \nperiod  and  mitigation  measures  have  been  proposed  in  the  environmental  management  plan, \nwhich  will  be  included  in  the  agreement  with  the  contractor.  Initial  environmental  examination \n(IEE) reports have been prepared for each component and are disclosed on the ADB website as \nrequired by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). Local communities were consulted while \npreparing  the  IEE  reports.  Details  of  consultations,  feedback  received,  and  grievance  redress \nmechanisms are included in the IEE reports.  \n \n31.  While  RHD  has  a  social  and  environmental  unit  to  address  safeguard  concerns,  the \nBLPA  does  not  have  such  a  unit.  Safeguard  focal  persons  will  be  appointed  in  BLPA \nheadquarters  and  at  sites.  They  will  be  supported  by  the  PIC\u2019s  environmental  specialist. \nSafeguard  training  workshops  will  be  conducted  during  pre-construction  and  construction,  as \nnecessary.  Capacity  development  for  BLPA  will  also  be  provided  under  the  loan.  Annual \nenvironmental monitoring reports will be submitted by the respective executing agencies to ADB. \n \n32. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  under \nresettlement  category  A.  Two  resettlement  plans  have  been  prepared  based  on  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  and  the  Acquisition  and  Requisition  of  Immovable  Property \nOrdinance  II  of  Bangladesh,  1982.  Affected  communities  were  extensively  consulted  to \nunderstand their views. The impact will be significant, with about 18.9 hectares of land acquired, \nwith commercial tenants experiencing the main impact. The project will affect 2,394 households \n(9,885  persons).  The  resettlement  plans  will  be  updated  based  on  detailed  design  and  will  be \nimplemented  by  an  experienced  nongovernment  organization,  with  the  PIC  providing  external \nmonitoring.  For  the  RHD  institutional  development  component,  11  non-titleholder  households \n(38  persons)  will  be  affected.  RHD  has  over  18  years  of  experience  in  managing  social \nsafeguard risks, including in projects funded by development partners. The land port component \nwill not require land acquisition and resettlement. The project will comply with ADB\u2019s information \ndisclosure requirements. No impact on indigenous people is envisaged.   \n \nF. \n \n33. \nKey  risks  are  delays  in  implementation  (Table  4).  Other  risks  and  mitigating  measures \nare  summarized  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.26 Integrated  benefits  and \nimpacts are expected to outweigh costs. \n                                                 \n26  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan; Operational Risks and Measures (accessible from the list of linked \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2).  \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \nGovernance \nProject \nimplementation \ndelay \n\nSafeguard \ncompliance \n\nInstitutional \ndevelopment \nactions delay \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nProcurement risks are mitigated by several measures as provided in para. 26. \nThe start-up delay has substantially reduced by 2 years, i.e., the design to be completed by 2012. \nRecruitment  of  nongovernment  organizations  for  supporting  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nactivities will be initiated immediately after loan negotiations. Contract packaging was made large \nenough to attract qualified contractors. \nLand  acquisition,  social,  and  environmental  impacts  have  been  minimized  through  engineering \nand  institutional  measures.  Works  contracts  will  be  awarded  only  after  completing  safeguard \nrequirements.  Before  construction,  a  due  diligence  mission  will  be  fielded  to  create  awareness \namong the project authorities about ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements. \nThe  institutional  development  action  plan  has  been  agreed  with  ADB  and  is  built  on  ongoing \ngovernment  efforts.  A  financier\u2019s  committee  is  set  up  with  a  major  development  partner  in  the \nroad  sector  (JICA)  to  monitor  the  progress  closely.  JICA  has  provided  an  in-house  advisor  to \nRHD  to  provide  hands-on  support  in  implementing  the  action  plan,  especially  on  bridge \nmanagement. \n\nJICA = Japan International Cooperation Agency, RHD = Roads and Highways Department. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\n \n34. \nThe government and BLPA have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin  the  project  administration  manual  and  loan  documents.  The  government  and  BLPA  have \nagreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan and project \nagreements. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n35. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove: \n(i) \n\nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR128,114,000  to  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation \nRoad Connectivity Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest \ncharge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per \nannum thereafter; for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and \nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board; and \nthe  administration  by  ADB  of  the  loan  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of \n$30,000,000  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  South  Asia \nSubregional Economic Cooperation Road Connectivity Project, to be provided by \nthe OPEC Fund for International Development. \n\n(ii) \n\n \nBindu N.
