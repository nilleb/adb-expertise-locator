Rural  energy  consumption  alone  is increasing  at  a  rate  of  2.6%  an\nnually.  Pollution \nfrom livestock breeding and agro-industries is one of the most serious environment\nal problems \nin  the  PRC.  Because  of  the  high  concentration  of  organic  materials  in  livestock  and \nagroprocessing  waste,  anaerobic  digestion  is  an  effective  technology  to  mana\nge  such  waste, \nwhile generating substantial quantities of renewable energy to help relieve the \nenergy shortage. \nAfter  the  ratification  of  the  Kyoto  Protocol  in  2002,  the  government  has \nbeen  voluntarily \ncontributing  to  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  reductions,  and  expects  to  convert  10\n%  of  its  energy \nstructure to renewable energy during 2005\u20132010.4 \n \n4. \ne  last  20  years \nbecause  of  growing  demand  for  meat  and  dairy  products.

According  to  the  Ministry  of  Environmental  Protection  (MEP),  tota\naste. The waste \nexceeded 2.7 billion tons in 2006, which was 3.4 times that of industrial solid w\nvolume is expected to increase as the country becomes the world\u2019s top meat and egg producer \nand tries to address the shortage of dairy products. It was projected that livestock waste would \nreach about 5.21 billion tons by 2010, and about 6.76 billion tons by 2020.8 \n \n5. \nIn  addition  to  the  increasing  livestock  waste,  agro-enterprises  su\nch  as  ethanol \nproduction,  vegetable  processing,  and  livestock  slaughter  have  become  impo\nrtant  sources  of \nbiomass  waste  and  pollution  problems.  The  number  of  agro-enterprises  in  the  PRC  has  been\n \ngrowing  r\napidly  in  recent  years,  and  the  trend  is  expected  to  continue  as  urbanization \nprogresses. In 2006, there were over 16,000 agro-enterprises, with an average \noutput of CNY79 \nmillion per enterprise. The amount of agro-industrial waste was estimated to be\n over 51 million \ntons in 2006.9 \n  \n6. \nts \nsince  the  early  1990s  to  (i)  help solve  the  environmental  pollution  problems  of\n  livestock  farms \nand  agro-industries;  (ii)  use  biogas  as  an  alternative  fuel  to  replace  fossil  fue\nl,  improve  rural \nrenewable energy uses, and reduce GHG emissions; and (iii) reuse the sludge\n and slurry from \nthe biogas plants in e\nco-farming  to achieve the goal of a \u201ccircular economy.\u201d As of 2007, it was \nestimated  that  about  1,646  large-scale  and  6,930  medium-scale  biogas  plants  had  been \neters  (m3).  It  is \nconstructed;  and  annual  biogas  production  was  reaching  800 million  cubic  m\nprojected that the large-scale biogas plants will increase to more than 10,000 un\nits by 2020, and \nbiogas  production  is  projected  to  reach  about  14  billion  m3  per  year.

An  ADB \nstudy points out that the PRC\u2019s agriculture sector is the leading nonpoint sour\nce of pollution in \nrural  areas  such  as  Henan  and  Shandong  provinces. 13  The  economic  loss \ncaused  by  rural \nnonpoint source pollution is estimated at about 1% of the GDP. Livestock was\nte also results in \nsignificant emissions of GHGs and increases global warming. In 2006, the Food\n and Agriculture \nOrganization of the United Nations \nestimated that the livestock industry produced more GHGs \nthan  the  transport  sector.  In  the  PRC,  the  2004  National  Communication  on \nClimate  Change \nestimated that the agriculture sector accounted for 17% of total GHG emission\ns, accounting for \n50% of national emissions of methane and 92% of nitrogen oxide emissions. It is thus crucial for \nthe government to manage livestock waste to achieve the goal of GHG reductio\nn as committed \nunder the Kyoto Protocol. \n \n9. \nmethane through anaerobic digestion, which is an alternate energy to \n10,000 pigs could produce about 500 m3 of biogas per day in a biogas plant, wh\nby  300\u2013500  rural  households  for  cooking  and  heating.  The  biogas  could  a\ngenerate electricity to power the livestock farm and neighboring households. S\nfrom the biogas plants can be used as bio-fertilizer to replace chemical fertilizer\nfarms  to  increase  crop  production.  It  is  estimated  that  the  removal  rate \nanaerobic digestion could be as high as 90%.14 \n \n10. \nPerformance  of  the  existing  biogas  plants.  Anaerobic  digestion  is  a  mature \ntechnology  that  has  been  adopted  widely  to  treat  wastewater  of  high  concentration  of  organic \nmaterials from households, livestock farms, and agro-industries. However, mos\nt of the MLBGPs \nin the PRC are not designed and maintained properly. The design and operation of the MLBGPs\n \nneed  specific  knowledge  and  skills  to  make  the  plants\u2019  O&M  successful.

The  application  of  the  sludge  in  farms  would  also  increase  the  c\nontent  of  humus \nmaterials  in  the  soil  and  help  sequestrate  carbon  and  mitigate  climate  chang\ne.  However,  the \ndefinition and standards of eco-farming are inconsistent across the PRC. The\n government will \nneed  to  issue  standards  on  eco-farming  and  establish  a  performance  moni\ntoring  system  to \npromote eco-farming and \u201cgreen\u201d produce, and realize the environmental and economic benefits \nof eco-farming. \n \n13. \nThere are 66 national and 131 provincial poverty counties in the four provinces.

The NDRC sets up targets that by 2020, about 10,000 large-scale biog\nas plants will be \nconstructed  at  large  livestock  farms,  and  about  6,000  biogas  plants  at  in\ndustrial  organic \nm3  and  installed \nwastewater  treatment  plants,  with  an  annual  biogas  yield  of  about  14  billion \ncapacity of about 3 million kilowatts. As th\ne concept of MLBGPs is just emerging in the PRC, the \nknowledge and technology of biogas plant design and operation are evolving. The government \nwill  need  financial  and  technical  support  in  not  only  constructing  the  biogas  p\nlants  but  also  in \nmonitoring  their  O&M  to  meet  performance  standards  and  the  targets  of  re\nnewable  energy \ndevelopment.

Consistent with\n its commitment \nto  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  righ\nt  to  investigate, \ndirectly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  co\nercive  practices \nrelating  to  the  project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019\ns  Anticorruption \nPolicy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for \nthe  project.  In \nparticular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the project shall in\nclude provisions \nspecifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of th\ne executing and \nimplementing  agencies,  the  PIOs,  the  PMO,  all  bio-digester  beneficiaries,  an\nd  all  contractors, \nsuppliers,  consultants  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  proj\nect.  The  project \ndesign  and  implementation  arrangements  provide  for  mitigating  corrupti\non  risks.  Risks \nassociated with project management, including procurement and disbursement,\n will be mitigated \nby (i) engaging consultants to advise and assist in the procurement of goods \nand services; (ii) \nintroducing a dual-signing system in which the civil works contractor awarded \nthe  contract will \nalso sign an anticorruption contract with the employer; and (iii) periodical inspec\ntion by the PMO \nof  the  contractor\u2019s  activities  related  to  f\nund  withdrawals  and  settlements.  In  furtherance  of  the \nprinciples  of  transparency  and  accounta\nbility,  MOA  will  cause  the  PMO  to  set  and  develop  a \nproject website that describes the project to provide the public with information on the project, \nincluding  setting  out  (i)  a  summary  of  the  audited  financial  statements  of  the\n  project;  and  (ii) \ntracking of contract awards following ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines.

The financial management capacity of the c\nwas  assessed  and  found  to  be  acceptable  based  on  the  financial  managem\nquestionnaire.  However,  enterprise  staff  lack  experience  with  ADB-financed \nrequire  training  to  ensure  success.  The  counterpart  contributions  come  from  b\ngrants  and  enterprises.  The  capacity  to  finance  counterpart  contributions  w\nexamining the governments\u2019 fiscal revenues and enterprises\u2019 annual profit leve\nindicated  that  both  governments  and  enterprises  have \ncounterpart  contributions.  For  loan  repayment  capacity,  the  analysis  ind\nenterprises can be expected to generate sufficient income from biogas and/or e\norganic fertilizers, and carbon credits to repay the subloans. Based on a weight\nof capital (WACC) of 5.2%, all core subprojects are financially viable with the \nrates  of  return  (FIRRs)  greater  than  the  WACC.  The  FIRRs  of  these  subpro\n6.0% to 11.3%. If income from the sale of CERs is included, the FIRRs are in\nfrom 8.3% to 16.8% and indicating the value to be derived from the CDM. \n  \n61. \nEconomic  benefits.  In  the  economic  analysis,  the  environmental  benefits  were \nassumed to be reflected by the economic value of the CERs; and these benefits were assumed \nto  be  generated  for  the  full  project  life.  In  addition  to  the  CERs,  the  main  economic  benefits \nincluded  energy  savings  from  the  use  of  biogas,  and  electricity  and  fertilizer  savings  from  the \nuse  of  biogas  slurry  and  organic  fertilizer.  Economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs)  and \neconomic  net  present  values  (ENPVs)  were  estimated  using  a  discount  rate  of  12%.  All  core \nsubprojects have EIRRs in excess of 12% and positive ENPVs. The EIRRs range from 12.2% to \n23.6%.

Among the subprojects, 22 are located in\n62. \n national poverty \ncounties,  accounting  for  14.3%  of  total  subprojects;  and  44  are  in  provincial  p\noverty  counties, \naccounting for 29% of total subprojects. The project will directly benefit farmer\ns, including poor \nhouseholds, in three ways: (i) about 4,900 temporary jobs will be created at biog\nas plants during \nconstruction,  increasing  people\u2019s  incomes  by  CNY4,000  on  average  over  of  3\n\u20134  months;  and \nabout 1,400 new jobs will be generated during biogas plant operation, with pe\nr capita incomes \nof  about  CNY13,000;  (ii)  about  9,000  poor  households  will  use  the  organic  fe\nrtilizers  from  the \nbiogas  plants,  benefiting  from  enhanced  productivity,  savings  on  chemica\nl  fertilizers,  and \nincremental revenues from the sales of organic products; and (iii) about 27,000\n contract farmers \nwill benefit from the sales of livestock to participating enterprises. Each contrac\nt farmer\u2019s annual \nhousehold income will total CNY44,200, which is considerably higher than the \naverage income \nof CNY19,067 in the project area. There are also many indirect benefits. The pr\noject will provide \nclean  energy  to  about  41,000  households  and improve  their  energy  consump\ntion  by  replacing \nstraw, wood, or coal, which will protect the environment. Some enterprises pla\nn to supply low-\npriced  electricity  to  neighboring  villagers.  About  1,500  poor  households  w\nill  benefit  from \nimproved access to cheaper electricity. It is estimated that about 65,200 hous\neholds, including \n4,500 poor households, will benefit from improved environmental and health c\nonditions. There \nare tangible benefits for the poor, such as new employment opportunities and in\ncreased income \nopportunities  through  expanded  contract  farming  and  eco-farming.  Women  w\nill  generally  and \nequally benefit from the project\u2019s positive impacts on livelihoods. A specific ge\nnder impact will \nbe the reduction of time and workload for fuel and firewood co\nllection by women because of the \nincreased  use  of  biogas  in  households.  Women\u2019s  health  condition  will  also  be  improved \nsignificantly due to the improvement of indoor air quality subsequent to the rep\nlacement of fuel \nand firewood by cleaner gas fuel. In addition, the project will give training prio\nrity to women to \nhelp  improve  their  agricultural  skills,  and  generate  job  opportunities  for wome\nn  in  construction \nand  operation  of  biogas  plants  at  agro-enterprises.  The  project  will  also\n  involve  women  in \nraising community awareness of environmental pollution and health issues. \n  \n63. \nHence, no land acquisition and resettlement is required.

While  the  provinces  have  rural  ener\ngy  offices  in  the \nprovinces  and  counties,  the  existing  extension  services  can  provide  only \nlimited  technical \nsupport and services in MLBGP design and operation because of their limited number in rural\n \nareas.

Rapid  analysis  conducted  on  some  smaller  su\nloan  processing  indicated  that  they  are  financially  and  economically  viable.  A\nanalyses is presented below, together with the results. The overall goal of the \nis  to  develop  a  market environment  for  anaerobic  digesters  as  a cost-effective\nlivestock  manure  in  large  and  medium-sized  livestock  farms  as  well  as  the\nenterprises, so as to reduce rural point and nonpoint source pollution problems \ngaps.  The  project  will  also  support  strengthening  of  institutional  capacity \nsustainability  of  medium-  and  large-scale  biogas  plants  (MLBGPs),  promotio\nMLBGPs  for  treatment  of  waste  from  several  farms,  and  integrated  eco-farm\nrecycling  economy  with  increased  biomass  use  and  improvement  of  rural \noverall  benefits  of  the  project  include  (i)  replacement  o\nbiomass energy in rural areas to achieve a low-carbon economy; (ii) reduction \nthe  country\u2019s  economic  growth  on  global  warming  by  collecting  and  usin\ngenerated  from  the  animal  waste  of  livestock  farms,  and  (iii)  improved  sus\nrecycling economy by promotion of eco-farming systems and practices.  \n \n2. \nEach  subproject  is  assumed  to  have  a  life  of  20  years  following  co\nmpletion  of  the \ninvestment,  with  a  major  replacement  of  equipment  during  year  11.  Repla\ncement  of  other \nequipment  with  a  shorter  life  is  included  in  the  operation  and  maintenance \ncosts.  Assuming \nregular  and  major  maintenance  is  undertaken,  this  subproject  life  appears  to\n  be  reasonable. \nBenefits  from  production  of  biogas  and  generation  of  electricity  are  assu\nmed  to  be  fully \nachieved  with  the  full  operation  of  the  biogas  plants,  while  those  from  orga\nnic  fertilizer  and \nbiogas slurry are assumed to build up gradually over 6 years, reflecting the gr\nadual buildup of \nexperience by the beneficiaries. The buildup of economic benefits is assumed t\no progress faster \nthan that of financial benefits. Benefits from reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG)\n emissions have \nbeen assessed in terms of the Clean Development  Mechanism (CDM), with th\neir value based \non  the  estimated  value  of  certified  emission  reductions  (CERs).  For  the  financ\nial  analysis,  the \nvalue of CERs is included for only 10 years. For the economic analysis, this is extended to the \nfull subproject life\u2014reflecting the continued economic value of these environmental benefits. For \nthe economic analysis, economic costs and benefits have been valued at the \nworld price level \nnumeraire. The financial prices of nontraded goods are converted to econom\nic values using a \nstandard  conversion  factor  of  0.93. 2   The  shadow  wage  rate  factor  for  su\nrplus  labor  was \nestimated at 0.90 of the prevailing wage rate, and the shadow wage rate for scar\nce labor was \nestimated  at  1.0.  These  were  adjusted  by  the  standard  conversion  factor  to \nderive  economic \nvalues.  All  traded  inputs  and  outputs  were  valued  at  their  market  prices.  Fina\nncial  investment \n\n \n                                                \n1  The  financial  and  economic  analyses  were  carried  out  for  six  provinces\u2014Heilongjiang,  Henan,  Jiangsu,  Jiangxi, \nShandong, and Shanxi\u2014during project preparation. Shanxi and Jiangsu provinces withdrew from the project after \nthe loan fact-finding mission. The analytical results and conclusions are valid for the project. \n\n2  The standard conversion factor of 0.93 was based on the economic analyses in recent Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  reports  and  recommendations  of  the  President,  e.g.,  (i)  ADB.  2006.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the \nPresident to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Inner Mongolia \nAutonomous Region Environment Improvement Project.

Unlike  biogas,  which \ncurrently  has  no \nmarket price in the People\u2019s Republic of China, electricity is the main form of co\nmmercial energy \ndelivered  by  the  public  power  grid  and  consumed  by  villagers,  livestock  farm\ns,  and  township \nenterprises for many years. Although the price of electricity in rural areas of ea\nch province may \nvary, historical price\ns have remained stable. The electricity price in the core subproject areas in \n2008  ranged  from  CNY0.50  to  CNY0.60  per  kilowatt-hour.  There  is  a  potential  market  for \norganic  fertilizers  to  produce  agricultural  produ\ncts,  such  as  green  and  organic  food.  The  main \nissue with organic fertilizers is farmers\u2019 willingness to pay. According to the subproject feasibility \nstudy  reports  (FSRs),  farmers  in  most  of  the  subproject  areas  currently  purchase  untreated \nmanure from the livestock farms at a price ranging from about CNY5\u2013CNY25 per ton. When the \nsubprojects  are  implemented,  it  is  anticipated  that  farmers  will  be  willing  to  pay  at  least  the \nsame  price  for  solid  organic  fertilizer.  The  situation  for  slurry,  where  there  is  no  history  of \npayment, is less clear.  \n \n\n3.   \n\n                                                \n \n3   ADB. 1997.

The \nresults are summarized in Table A14.1. Excluding income from CERs, all core subprojects are \nassessed as financially viable, having financial internal rates of return (FIRRs) in excess of the \nWACC  of  5.20%.  The  FIRRs  of  these  subprojects  range  from  6.0%  to  11.9%.

The  financial  costs  of  the  subproject  were  converte\nvalues by deducting the cost of taxes and adjusting the foreign exchange cost\nexchange rate factor. All costs incurred prior to loan appraisal are treated as sun\n  \n13. \nEconomic benefits. The economic value of electricity is assumed to be\n the market price \nof electricity as reported to be paid by the beneficiary. Since electricity is also\n proposed to be \nsold to the surrounding community, and this sale will be at a subsidized price, \nthe subsidy has \nbeen removed from the price, with the result that the economic price for electr\nicity is the same \nregardless  of  consumer.  The  economic  price  for  organic  fertilizer  should  idea\nlly  be  estimated \nbased  on  its  economic value  to  the  crops  on  which  it is  applied.  As  such,  it  s\nhould  reflect  the \neconomic  value  of  inputs  saved  as  a  result  of  the  use  of  organic  fertilizer,  r\neported  to  be  a \nsaving  in  the  use  of  chemical  fertilizers  and  pesticides,  together  with  the  ec\nonomic  value  of \nincreased  and  improved  crop  output.  While  there  are  qualitative  statements  about  all  of  the\nse \nbenefits,  there  are  not  sufficient  data  for  adequate  quantification.  Therefore\n,  an  alternative \napproach was adopted in which the economic value was assumed to be equa\nl to the expected \nmarket price at full subproject development after 6 years. A gradual buildup wa\ns assumed over \nthis period. Since CERs are purchased on the international market, they are t\nreated as traded \ngoods  and  the  economic  value  estimated  accordingly.  Moreover,  the  economic  benefit  from \nCERs is assumed to be received for the full subproject life since, even if they cannot be sold, \nthe plant is expected to remain operational and the environmental benefit to continue. Pollution \nlevies are treated as a transfer payment, so they are not included as an economic benefit. \n \n14. \nEconomic  internal  rate  of  return.  The  estimated  economic  internal  rates  of  return \n(EIRRs) of the core subprojects are shown in Table A14.2. For the economic analysis, only the \nEIRRs including CERs were shown since these economic values are considered to be received \nwhether  or  not  the  subproject  receives  financial  payment  for  CERs.  The  economic  analysis \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n59 \n\nindicates  that  all  core  subprojects  included  are  economically  viable,  with  EIRRs  ranging  from \n12.2% to\n \n\n 23.6%.

Th\ny  the  provincial \npoor  in  the  provinces  arise  as  a  direct  result  of  the  project  benefits  accrued  b\ne livestock farms \ngovernments. Since the main direct beneficiaries of the subprojects are the larg\nand agro-industries that are implementing the subprojects, the economic benefits to surrounding \ncommunities in which the poor are located are relatively small. Estimated poverty impact ratios \nof the core subprojects range from 0.00 for Weiwei and Lvyuan to 0.10 for Wantong.   \n \nG. \n\nFinancial Affordability and Sustainability Analysis \n\nFinancial  affordability  analysis  compared  the  enterprise\u2019s  annual  profit  before  tax  with \n17. \nthe  counterpart  contribution  expected  to  be  financed  by  the  enterprise,  excluding  provincial \ngovernment  grants.  To  be  considered  affordable,  enterprises  were  expected  to  be  capable  of \n\n \n\n\f60   Appendix 14 \n \n\ngenerating 50% of the required counterpart funds from 1 year of profits. Based\n on this criterion, \neight of the 10 core subprojects have sufficient capacity to finance the counter\npart contribution. \nThe two that fail to satisfy this criterion are Jinli (48%) and Huimin (27%). Ho\nwever, based on \nthe soundness of these commercial enterprises, it is considered that they will b\ne able to finance \nthe  investm\nent  from  other  sources.  Sustainability  analysis  indicates  that  all  enterprises  will  be \nable to generate sufficient income from biogas and/or electricity and sale of organic fertilizer to \nrepay the loan.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n61 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nCountry and Project Title: \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nPeo\nInte\n\nple\u2019s Republic of Ch\ngrated Renewable Biomass Energy Development Sector Proj\n\nina  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nect \n\nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\necto\nr \nS\nLoan \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n\nEast Asia Department \nAgriculture, Environment, and Natural Resources Division \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA. Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n\nAfter  30  years  of  poverty  alleviation  efforts,  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  has  achieved \nsignificant progress. With an average annual growth rate of 9.7% since the 1970s, the population living \nunder  a  dollar  per  day  has  decreased  by  246  million  between  1990  and  2004.  Yet  poverty  remains, \nincreasingly  concentrated  in  more  vulnerable,  remote,  and  isolated  mountain  areas  in  the  rural  central \nand  western  regions.  This  has  led  the  government  to  prioritize  the  reduction  of  rural\u2013urban,  interior\u2013\ncoastal  income  inequality  and  improvement  of  rural  livelihoods.  Sustaining  growth  is  vital  for  poverty \nreduction,  but  this  will  not  be  possible  without  addressing  environmental  degradation  and  the  strain  on \nnatural resources. Consequently in its 11th Five-Year Plan 2006\u20132010, the government is committed to \nbuilding  a  harmonious  society  and  a  socialist  market  economy \nis  energy-efficient  and \nenvironmentally friendly.a In October 2007, the 17th Congress of the Communist Party of China pledged \nto  continue  and  extend  reforms  along  these  lines,  setting  the  aim  to  eliminate  poverty  by  2020.  The \nNational Poverty Alleviation Program (2001\u20132010) lays out concrete interventions for poverty reduction, \nwhich  include  development  of  environmentally  sustainable  crop  and  animal  production;  increase  in \nagricultural productivity; investments in economic infrastructure, promotion of agricultural industrialization, \nand  promotion  of  economic  cooperatives.  More  technically,  the  decision  on  new  countryside \ndevelopment, promulgated in February 2006, highlights biogas system development in rural areas as an \nimportant element of improved rural livelihoods. The Ministry of Agriculture also issued the Development \nPlan  on  Agricultural  Biomass  Industry  (2007\u20132015)  in  July  2007.  The  plan  calls  for  an  ambitious \ndevelopment of renewable energy from biogas utilizing agricultural waste to improve the environment and \nrural livelihoods.  \n\nthat \n\nFollowing  the  PRC\u2019s  11th  Five-Year  Plan  and  other  national  strategies,  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s \n(ADB)  country  partnership  strategy  for  the  PRC  (2008\u20132010)  emphasizes  inclusive  growth  through \nbalanced  development  and  environmental  sustainability.b  More  focus  will  be  given  to  poorer  provinces \nand promotion of integrated rural development while helping to strengthen environmental management. \nADB will pay greater attention to poverty reduction, management of natural resources and ecosystems, \nincreasing its investment in natural resources management, agriculture, and rural development. \n\nThe  proposed  Integrated  Renewable  Biomass  Energy  Development  Sector  Project  supports  both  the \nPRC\u2019s and ADB\u2019s strategic priorities by contributing to a better environment and rural livelihoods through \nbiogas development, primarily in the central provinces. The project aims to develop a market environment \nfor medium- and large-scale biogas plants as a basis for biomass energy development while ensuring an \nintegrated  approach  for  eco-farming  to  realize  a  sustainable  circular  economy  and  improve  the  rural \nlivelihood  in  participating  provinces,  including  Heilongjiang,  Henan,  Jiangxi,  and  Shandong.  The  overall \nbenefits of the project include (i) replacement of fossil fuel by renewable biomass energy in rural areas to \nachieve a low-carbon economy, (ii) reduction of the adverse impacts of the country\u2019s economic growth on \nglobal warming by collecting and using methane gas emissions generated from animal biomass waste of \nlivestock  farms  and  agroprocessing  plants,  and  (iii) ensured  sustainability  of  the  circular  economy  by \ndeveloping  eco-farming  systems  and  emission  reduction  practices.  The  poverty  and  social  analysis \nshows  that  the  project  will  contribute  to  (i)  an  improved  environment  because  of  replacement  of  fossil \nfuels, (ii) better livelihoods through provision of heat and electricity generated from biogas, (iii) increased \nemployment  opportunities  and  income  generation  activities  from  temporary  job  creation  during  the  bio-\ndigesters\u2019  construction  and  permanent  job  creation  during  operation,  (iv)  increased  farmers\u2019  income \nthrough  greater  demand  for  animal  husbandry  and  crop  plantation  from  expanded  agro-enterprises, \n(v) increased income through promotion of eco-farming, and (vi) improved health and sanitary conditions \nthrough the use of clean energy and appropriate agricultural waste management. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n62  \n \n\nB. Poverty Analysis                            \n1. Key Issues  \n\nTargeting Classification: General \n\nThe  participating  provinces  occupy  an  important  position  in  the  national  economy.  The  gross  domestic \nproduct  (GDP)  of  these  provinces  totaled  CNY8.5  trillion  in  2007,  accounting  for  34%  of  the  national \nGDP. The total grain production equaled 37% of the national total. The economic growth rate was 14.2% \non  average  among  the  participating  provinces,  3.1%  higher  than  the  national  average.  The  annual  per \ncapita  GDP  in  project  areas  in  2007  was  CNY22,410,  which  is  CNY3,476  higher  than  the  national \naverage  of  CNY18,934.  This  does  not  mean,  however,  that  all  six  provinces  are  well  off.  The  project \nareas\u2019 average was higher because of the relatively well-off provinces\u2014Jiangsu and Shandong.  \n\nThe  per  capita  GDPs  of  Heilongjiang,  Henan,  and  Jiangxi  are  all  lower  than  the  national  average.  The \nlowest is in Jiangxi (CNY12,633). Since 2009, the PRC has adopted the new \u201clow-income poverty line\u201d of \nCNY1,067  per  capita  per  year  as  the  general  poverty  line.  According  to  this  new  poverty  line  in  early \n2009,  about  43.2  million  rural  poor  remain  in  the  PRC  accounting  for  4.2%  of  the  rural  population. \nHowever,  each  province  has  set  its  own  poverty  standards.  In  Shandong  and  Jiangsu,  an  income  of \nCNY1,000 per capita per year is poor; under CNY1,500 is considered \u201clow-income.\u201d The absolute poverty \nline  is  set  at  annual  per  capita  income  of  CNY360  in  Henan  and  Jiangxi,  and  CNY800  in  Shandong. \nAccording  to  national  standards  used  in  2008  (CNY683  for  absolute  poverty,  CNY944  for  low-income \npoverty), the project areas account for 1.13 million poor, of which 424,600 are absolute poor and 709,000 \nare low-income people. They account for 3% of the total population in the project areas. \n\nThe  participating  provinces  still  face  persistent  poverty,  more  pronounced  in  Henan  and  Jiangxi.  There \nare 101 national poverty counties and 148 provincial poverty counties in the six provinces. The total poor \npopulation in the project area is 11.3 million, of which 4.2 million live in absolute poverty and 7.1 million \nare categorized low-income families.  \n\nAmong  the  142  subprojects  to  be  financed  by  the  project,  22  are  located  in  national  poverty  counties \naccounting for 14.3% of total subprojects; and 44 are in provincial poverty counties accounting for 29% of \ntotal  subprojects.  Jiangxi  has  the  largest  amount  of  subprojects  in  poverty  counties,  40  in  total, \naccounting for 26% of total subprojects. Among the 11 core subprojects, there are three core subprojects \nlocated in poverty counties\u2014one in Henan national poverty county and two in Jiangxi provincial poverty \ncounties. \n\nThe  socioeconomic  study  shows  that  most  of  the  poverty  in  the  project  areas  was  caused  by  lack  of \nproductive  labor  force  in  the  household  and  illness.  Low  income  was  due  to  lack  of  employment \nopportunities and lack of sufficient knowledge or skills to secure good jobs. \n\n2. Design Features \n\nThe project will benefit farmers in three aspects. First, eco-farming, which is promoted under the project, \nwill  bring  greater  economic  benefits  to  the  poor  by  reducing  the  expenses  on  chemical  fertilizer  and \nincreasing the price of their agricultural products. It is estimated that about 11,000 poor households will \nbenefit from eco-farming, with income increased on average by CNY527 per household. Second, farmers \nwill benefit from more secure access to market, better selling prices in some cases, provision of improved \nseeds, and latest skills through contract farming with agro-enterprises that would expand their production \ncapacity  under  the  project.  Third,  a  fraction  of  poor  households  will  benefit  from  new  employment \nopportunities  created  under  the  project.  It  is  estimated  that  biogas  plant  construction  will  provide  about \n6,000 temporary job opportunities to the poor, increasing their income by a total of CNY4,000 on average \nover  about  3  months.  During  operation,  about  1,700  poor  farmers  will  receive  relatively  stable \nemployment  opportunities  such  as  supplying  agricultural  products  (animal  husbandry)  to  agro-\nenterprises.  Their  annual  income  is  expected  to  rise  to  about  CNY13,000  per  person.  To  expand  the \nbenefit,  the  project  encourages  local  governments,  agro-enterprises,  the  Ministry  of  Labor  and  Social \nSecurity, and the All China Women\u2019s Federation to cooperate and provide unskilled jobs (such as 20%) to \nvulnerable groups such as the poor and women. In addition, the project aims to provide agricultural skills \nand biogas management skills training for the vulnerable. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n63 \n\nThere  are  other  indirect  benefits.  First,  the  project  will  improve  poor  farmers\u2019  energy  situation  and \necological environment. The main source of energy for the poor is coal, wood, and straw. In some poor \nareas,  they  use  trees  for  fuel.  There  are  15  subprojects,  which  plan  to  supply  biogas  to  neighboring \nfarmers. Through these subprojects, it is estimated that about 11,000 poor households will benefit from \nbiogas  energy.  Second,  the  project  will improve  the  poor\u2019s  living environment.  Biogas  projects  promote \nbetter livestock and poultry manure management, which in turn improves the air, water, and soil quality in \nthe vicinity. Further, \nat 5,200 poor households will benefit \nfrom improved environment. \n\nhealth risks will be reduced. It is estimated th\n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA. Findings of Social Analysis  \nA  poverty  and  social  analysis  was  undertaken  in  line  with  ADB  guidelines  to  collect  detailed  social \ninformation  necessary  to  inform  project  design,  identify  poverty  reduction  and  social  development \nimpacts, and mitigate any negative socioeconomic impacts. \nDirect social benefits for the entire rural population, including the poor farmers, are as follows:  \n(i) \n\nCreation  of  new  job  opportunities  for  biogas  plant  construction  and  operation.  It  is \nestimated  that  all  subproject  construction  will  provide  about  6,000  temporary  jobs  (5,251  for \nfarmers), bringing income worth CNY4,000 on average over 3 months. For biogas plant operation \n(including the Clean Development Mechanism), it is estimated that over 1,700 new long-term job \nopportunities will be generated. Jobs include biogas plant maintenance, crop planting and animal \nbreeding, and cleaning. It is expected that these jobs will increase the per capita income to above \nCNY13,000.  \nBenefits  from  eco-farming. It is estimated that the total contribution of all subprojects through \neco-farming will be CNY158 million. This will raise the average income by CNY558 per year per \nhousehold.  \nExpansion  of  agro-enterprises.  Over  33,500  farmers  are  expected  to  benefit  from  sales  of \nlivestock  to  these  agro-enterprises.  Contract  farmers\u2019  annual  household  income  will  total  on \naverage CNY44,200. Even non-contract farmers will have opportunities to sell their livestock to \nand get service from agro-enterprises, and it is estimated that their annual household income will \nincrease up to CNY16,533. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nIn  addition,  the  project  brings  the  following  social  benefits:  First,  the  project  provides  clean  energy  for \nfarmers and improves their energy consumption. It is estimated that about 49,800 farmer households can \nuse biogas to replace straw, wood, or coal; this protects the environment and reduces women\u2019s workload. \nSome  enterprises  plan  to  supply  farmers  with  low-priced  electricity,  which  improves  farmers\u2019  access  to \nenergy. Second, by promoting proper waste management, an estimated 76,930 households will benefit \nfrom improved environment and health.  \n\ne\n\nroject preparation. \n\n.  Provide a summary of the consu tation and participation proc ss during the p\n\nB. Consultation and Participation \nl\n1\nStakeholder meetings and focus group discussions were the primary means of consultation. Participants \nincluded representatives  of  provincial  and  county  governments,  core subprojects  representatives  (agro-\nenterprises),  and  farmers.  Fourteen  meetings  and  nine  focus  group  meetings  with  37  farmers  were \nconducted  to  (i)  introduce  the  project  components,  (ii)  solicit  their  views  of  the  project,  (iii)  understand \nfarmers\u2019 views and expectations for the project, and (iv) identify potential social risks of the project.  \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and \nmonitoring? \n \nPublic consultation and participation, which have been key elements of the project design, will continue \nduring  the  project  implementation,  monitoring,  and  evaluation.  Through  continued  consultation  and \nparticipation,  the  project  aims  to  (i)  meet  the  evolving  needs  and  expectations  of  the  beneficiaries,  (ii) \nincrease  the  awareness  of  the  public  about  the  benefits  of  the  project,  (iii)  encourage  the  active \ninvolvement  of  local  communities  to  maximize  their  support  for  the  project,  and  (iv)  raise  the  social \nacceptance of the project. \n \n\n Collaborative decision making  \n\n Information sharing  \n\n Empowerment  \n\n Consultation  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n64  \n \n\n No  \n\n Yes  \n\nIf  a  C&P  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan \n\n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?  \n \n(including budget, consultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \nMaximizing  the  social  impacts  need  full  cooperation  between  the  agro-enterprises  and  farmers.  It  is \nimportant  to  set  up  a  channel  for  information  sharing  and  communication.  Given  the  close  relationship \nbetween  agro-enterprises  and  farmers  and  no  negative  safeguard  issues  or  any  other  negative  social \nimpacts arising from the project, there is no need to set up a C&P plan. The existing village committee will \nbe  responsible  for  public  participation.  The  project  management  office  will  ensure  that  enterprise \nmanagement agencies closely cooperate with village committees. \n\nC. Gender and Development \n1. Key Issues \nAs  more  men  migrate  to  urban  centers,  it  is  primarily  the  women  who  bear  the  bulk  of  agricultural \nproduction.  Moreover,  women  have  the  primary  responsibility  of  cooking  and  fetching  firewood.  The \nproject aims to tackle these issues by (i) giving training opportunities to women to help them improve their \nagricultural skills, (ii) generating employment opportunities during construction and in operation of biogas \nat agro-enterprises, (iii) increasing income by providing more opportunities of contract farming as agro-\nenterprises expand their capacity, (iv) reducing women\u2019s workload of fetching firewood by replacing it with \nbiogas, and (v) improving the living condition by reducing livestock waste pollution and supplying biogas \nt\no improve ind or air quality. \no\n2.

The  project  will  improve  ecologi\ncal  agriculture,  promote  renewable  energy,  and  address \nthe  overarching  goals  of  poverty  reduction  and  environmental  sustainability.  The  project  is \nc\ncording  to  the  Environment  Policy  (2002)  of  the  Asian \nD elopment Bank (ADB); and sector loan procedures will be applied.
