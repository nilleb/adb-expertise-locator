These  two  elements  reinforce  each  other:  (i)  the  policy-based  actions  supporting  an \nimproved operational context to gain more benefits from health sector investments and (ii) the \nhealth  sector  investments  supporting  the  implementation  of  priority  policies.  Subprogram  1 \nactions have been sustained and are built upon by subprogram 2 actions, and all 15 subprogram \n1  actions  have  been  sustained.  The  program  supports  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nStrategy  2030  operational  priority  of  strengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity,  with \nparticular emphasis on small island developing states.3 \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nHealth sector issues. Despite health being a priority in PNG since independence, and \nthe government spending substantial resources in the sector, improvements in access and quality \nof health services and health outcomes have been slower than in comparator countries. Despite \nsome improvements in life expectancy, PNG continues to have the lowest life expectancy in the \nPacific region; infant and maternal mortality rates are higher than in countries at similar income \nlevels. Utilization of basic health services has declined markedly between 2006 and 2016.4 At the \ninput  level,  medical  supplies  are  often  not  available,  the  health  workforce  is  insufficient  and \nunderperforming,  and  most  health  facilities  are  poorly  maintained.  Chronic  diseases,  including \nstrokes and heart disease, dominate the burden of disease, which also includes poverty-related \nillnesses such as pneumonia and neonatal conditions.5 Development constraints in PNG\u2019s health \nsector  specifically  addressed  under  this  program  are  (i)  complex  subnational  health  system \narchitecture; (ii) incomplete regulatory frameworks; (iii) fragmented fund flow; (iv) weak PFM of \nprovincial  health  authorities  (PHAs), 6  including  lack  of  resources  for  maintenance  of  health \nfacilities;  (v)  weak  pharmaceutical  procurement,  distribution,  and  stock  management  systems; \n\n \n\n1  The design and monitoring framework are in Appendix 1.

PHAs have financial autonomy from the provincial governments and are responsible for hospital and primary \nhealth service delivery under guidance from the PHA board, which includes community and women\u2019s representatives. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fand (vi) insufficient oversight of health sector partners and service providers.7 \n \n4. \nRecent economic performance. The sharp downturn in global commodity prices in 2015 \nand 2016, coinciding with a severe drought that affected the mining and agriculture sectors, led \nto a rapidly worsening macroeconomic situation in PNG. Implementation of the required sharp \nfiscal consolidation (para. 5) further reduced aggregate demand, leading to a severe economic \ncrisis.  While  agricultural  production  and  commodity  prices  partially  recovered  in  2018,  a  large \nearthquake in early 2018 disrupted production and exports by the gas, oil, and mining industries, \ndriving a small contraction (Table 1). External financing, including through subprogram 1, helped \nreduce the foreign exchange backlog and, combined with gradual exchange rate adjustment by \nthe Bank of PNG, supported business activity and growth toward the end of 2018. Together with \nthe  full  restoration  of  gas,  oil,  and  mining  production,  this  contributes  to  an  improved \nmacroeconomic outlook over the medium-term, with growth expected to reach 4.8% in 2019 and \nforecast to remain between 2\u20124% during 2020\u20122023.8 This provides the basis for ongoing gradual \nfiscal  consolidation  while  allowing  for  safeguarding  of  funding  for  essential  health  services,  as \nsupported by the program. \n \n\nItem \nReal GDP growth (% change) \nChange in CPI (% annual average) \n  \nCentral government budget \n  Total revenue \n    Tax revenue \n    Nontax revenue \n    Grants \n  Total expenditure \n    Recurrent \n    Capital \n  Fiscal balance \n    Excluding external grants \n \nPublic debt \n   of which: External debt \n \nNominal GDP ($ billion) \n\nTable 1: Selected Economic and Fiscal Indicators \n(% of GDP, unless otherwise indicated) \n2015 \n10.5 \n6.0 \n \n \n17.7 \n14.7 \n1.7 \n1.3 \n22.2 \n18.9 \n3.3 \n\u20134.5 \n\u20135.8 \n \n29.0 \n6.5 \n \n 22.5  \n\n2016 \n2.0 \n6.7 \n \n \n15.5 \n12.4 \n0.9 \n2.1 \n20.0 \n17.9 \n2.1 \n\u20134.6 \n\u20136.7 \n \n32.4 \n8.1 \n \n 21.6  \n\n2017 \n3.0 \n5.4 \n \n \n15.2 \n12.1 \n1.2 \n1.9 \n17.6 \n15.9 \n1.7 \n\u20132.4 \n\u20134.3 \n \n31.2 \n8.4 \n \n 23.7  \n\n2014 \n12.5 \n5.2 \n \n \n21.0 \n18.1 \n1.4 \n1.5 \n27.3 \n19.5 \n7.8 \n\u20136.3 \n\u20137.9 \n \n27.1 \n6.2 \n \n 23.2  \n\n2018e \n-0.6 \n4.7 \n \n \n17.1 \n12.7 \n2.2 \n2.2 \n19.6 \n17.7 \n1.9 \n\u20132.5 \n\u20134.7 \n \n32.8 \n12.1 \n \n 25.0  \n\n2019p \n4.8 \n4.0 \n \n \n15.8 \n12.5 \n2.2 \n1.1 \n18.5 \n16.1 \n2.4 \n\u20132.7 \n\u20133.7 \n \n31.8 \n14.1 \n \n 26.2  \n\n2020p \n2.1 \n3.8 \n \n \n15.6 \n12.2 \n2.4 \n1.0 \n17.3 \n14.6 \n2.7 \n\u20131.7 \n\u20132.7 \n \n30.8 \n13.8 \n \n 26.9  \n\nCPI = consumer price index, e = estimate, GDP = gross domestic product, p = projection. \nSource: Government of Papua New Guinea and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nFiscal  performance.  Fiscal  consolidation\u2014required  after  an  expansionary  fiscal  policy \n5. \ncoinciding with a downturn in global commodity prices and a related drop in domestic revenues \nled to unsustainable fiscal deficits during 2012\u20122014\u2014continued in 2018. With the help of sharp \nexpenditure cuts since 2014, the government was able to balance out eroding revenue collections \nand reduce the fiscal deficit from 6.3% of GDP in 2014 to 2.5% in 2018 (Table 1). Although the \ndeficit is projected to expand to 2.7% of GDP in 2019, this is mostly because of the reduction in \nexternal grants after elevated inflows in 2018 due to the earthquake response.9 Excluding grants, \nthe deficit is seen to narrow by a full percentage point.  Gradual reductions to the debt-to-GDP \nratio are forecast over the medium term, supported by expenditure prioritization and tax policy \n\n \n\n7  ADB.  2019.

Development \nconstraints in the areas of fiscal policy and national PFM systems that are addressed through the \nprogram are (i) an unsustainable fiscal position that risks leaving basic service delivery unfunded, \n(ii)  gaps  in  PFM  legislation,  (iii)  shortcomings  in  national  budget  documentation  that  hinder \ntransparent resourcing of policy priorities as well as legislative and public scrutiny, and (iv) weak \nnational procurement systems. \n\nPolicy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\nGovernment  strategy.

He directed the budget presentation be moved into full alignment with the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) Government Finance Statistics (2014) manual, thus expediting \nchanges  already  underway  and  being  supported  by  the  program  (para.  12).12 This  will  have \nimplications for budget targets and require an adjustment of the government\u2019s medium term fiscal \nstrategy as 2019 budget execution is assessed and the 2020 budget is developed which will then \nneed to be considered and addressed in Subprogram 3.  \n \nB. \n \n8. \nframework, \nincorporating  the  PNG  Vision  2050,  PNG\u2019s  Development  Strategic  Plan  (2010\u20132030),  and  its \nMedium Term Development Plan 3 (2018\u20132022), outlines PNG\u2019s strong commitment to effective \nleadership, good governance, performance management, and accountability, aiming to provide \nservice  delivery  and  ultimately,  quality  of  life  improvements. 13  These  high-level  plans  are \nimplemented through a number of strategies and reform plans, including (i) the National Health \nPlan  2011\u20122020,  a  medium-term  fiscal  strategy  (MTFS)  that  provides  the  framework  for  the \nannual budget; (ii) the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Road Map 2015\u2012\n2018; and (iii) PFM strategies for the subnational level and the integrated financial management \nsystem  (IFMS),  which  aim  to  strengthen  PFM  and  enhance  service  delivery  in  provinces  and \ndistricts.14 Government agencies\u2019 capacity to implement reforms is severely constrained by weak \nmanagement and technical expertise, a small skills pool, limited financial resources, and an infant \nperformance management  system.  The  government  has  a  mixed  track record  in  implementing \nstrategies  and  achieving  targets  and  there  is  a  risk  that  implementation  will  stall  because  of \nwaning commitment to reform, the complex political economy, limited internal capacities, and a \n\n \n\n10 Reforms focused on revenue, including tax policy and administration, are part of an ongoing World Bank program. \nWorld Bank. 2018.

Given  these  factors,  the  program  will  support  reform  prioritization, \nsequencing, and implementation; alignment of development partner assistance; and incentivize \nreform implementation (in addition to addressing financing needs of basic services). \n \nADB  engagement.  The  program  combines  a  policy-based  operation  and  a  project \n9. \ninvestment  to  support  critical  whole-of-government  and  sector  reforms  with  health  sector \ninvestments. The policy-based loans support fiscal policy, PFM, and health sector reforms while \nthe project loan fill investment gaps to support PNG\u2019s progress toward universal health coverage. \nSubprogram 2 builds on subprogram 1 lessons, which include taking a flexible approach in view \nof emerging technical information and political windows of opportunity, and a stronger emphasis \non development partner collaboration in support of policy actions. The program remains aligned \nwith ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for PNG, 2016\u20132020, supporting its strategic objective of \nconverting the country\u2019s resource wealth into inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic \ngrowth through the operational priorities of primary health and public sector management.15 It will \ncontinue to support the implementation of PNG\u2019s strategic planning framework and related whole-\nof-government and sector reform plans (para. 7), contributing to the National Health Plan\u2019s goal \nof affordable, accessible, equitable, and high-quality health services for all citizens. The targeted \neffect of the reforms is a more sustainable and efficient health care system. As part of the program, \nsubprogram  2  will  continue  implementation  of  critical  whole-of-government  and  health  sector \nreforms at the national and subnational levels, building upon reform progress made under the first \nsubprogram and on ADB\u2019s prior support for the health sector and public sector management.16 \n \n10. \nPolicy  actions.  After  close  consultation  with  the  government  policy  actions  for \nsubprogram 2 and indicative actions for subprogram 3 (Appendix 4: Policy Matrix) were specified, \nwith the aim of maximizing reform impact within given technical and political constraints. ADB and \ndevelopment  partners\u2019  technical  assistance  (TA)  has  facilitated  the  government\u2019s  most  critical \nreform  endeavors.  In  developing  subprogram  2  indicative  actions  (identified  at  the  time  of \nsubprogram  1)  into  final  policy  actions,  attention  was  given  to  increasing  the  strength  and \nspecificity of each action, integrating and streamlining closely interrelated actions, and highlighting \nareas where the government had gone further than initially expected.  \n\n \n11. \nIn reform area 1, an additional, and critical, area of policy engagement has been included \nin subprogram 3 around the improved management of the personal emoluments budget\u2014an area \ncomprising an estimated 31% of budget expenditure in 2019. Reform area 2 saw slower progress \nthan  hoped  in  creation  of  PHAs  (hampered  by  the  fluid  political  environment,  which  delayed \nnecessary  dialogue  at  the  senior  political  level,  and  by  delays  in  start-up  of  the  program \ninvestment component). There was, however, stronger progress in financial management through \nthe  development  of  a  chart  of  accounts  specifically  for  PHAs.

Actions  completed  under \n12. \nsubprogram 2 sought to build a stronger financial management foundation to support improved \nhealth services delivery, and more broadly, delivery of all government services. \n \nThe  government  aligned  the  2019  budget  with  the  MTFS  initially  developed  under \n13. \nsubprogram 1.18 The 2019 budget projects public debt to reduce to 31.7% of GDP in 2019, and \ncontinue on this downward trend in line with the target of 30.0% of GDP by 2022. The domestic \nrevenue-to-GDP ratio is projected at 14.8% in 2019, well above the medium-term minimum target \nof  at  least  14.0%  by  2022.  Ongoing  commitment  to  health  as  a  key  development  enabler  is \nreflected in the Medium-Term Expenditure Strategy of the MTFS and actual expenditure for 2018, \nand  budget  allocations  for  2019  safeguard  essential  health  services  (para.  5).  Women  and \nchildren, as the main recipients of primary health services, will be the predominant beneficiaries \nof  this.  The  government  demonstrated  its  commitment  to  improved  budget  transparency  and \ninternational comparability through further enhancements to the budget document to align it with \nthe Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014 of the IMF, done in parallel with the historical \nformat,  with  a  view  to  shifting  solely  to  the  new  format  in  2020.  More  recently  this  has  been \nfasttracked (para. 7). The improved classification will allow allocating, tracking, and reporting of \nresources against standard functional classifications. The government has introduced descriptive \ninformation about agencies and programs in the new version of the budget to provide members \nof  Parliament  with  greater  clarity  on  appropriations  as  well  as  improve  in-year  reporting  and \nprovide clear budget lines for family, maternal, and child health. \n \n14. \nThe Department of Finance (DOF) further reviewed the Public Finances (Management) \nAct 1995 (as amended in 2016) to ensure alignment with the new procurement and other related \nlegislation,  and  to  reflect  reforms  implemented  from  the  PEFA  Road  Map,  2015\u20122018. \nParliamentary approval of a further amendment to the Public Finances (Management) Act in 2018 \nstrengthened the policy action; in comparison, the indicative action required only completion of \nreview  of  the  act.  The  National  Procurement  Act  2018  (based  on  the  new  procurement  policy \ncompleted under subprogram 1) came into force in April 2019, with subprogram 2 supporting DOF \nendorsement of a 2-year implementation plan for the act. As a first step, DOF launched a new \npublic  procurement  website  to  provide  transparent  information  regarding  tenders  and  awards, \nwhich again strengthens the indicative action identified at the time of subprogram 1 requiring only \nprocurement plan approval. \n \n15. \nIntended action by the Department of Health (DOH) to streamline the legal framework for \nhealth, after subprogram 1 supported the development of a discussion paper, has been removed \nfrom the program. This is a result of the discussion paper\u2019s recognition of the complex nature of \nthis reform. While a critical piece in the government\u2019s health and decentralization reform agenda \nis to realign and simplify the legislative framework for health,  it is expected that the necessary \nbroad-based consultation will take several years to enable drafting instructions to be approved \nand intermediate actions would be heavily process oriented and unsuitable for program inclusion. \n\n17 Summary of Changes from Indicative Actions (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Government of Papua New Guinea. 2018. 2019 National Budget, Volume 1. Port Moresby. \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fThe DOH carried out initial consultations and a summary report was submitted to the minister of \nhealth  in  2019.  The  project  component  of  the  program  will  continue  to  support  and  monitor \nprogress given its long-term impact on the ongoing delivery of health services. The shift of this \naction to being supported by the project investment is balanced by stronger PFM actions (para \n14) so subprogram strength is maintained \n \n16. \nSubprogram  3  will  continue  to  track  the  MTFS  targets  to  ensure  the  government\u2019s \ncontinued transition to a more sustainable fiscal path, while preserving prioritization of funding for \nhealth services. The Department of Treasury (DOT) will introduce reforms to better manage the \nlarge  personal  emolument  expenditures  and  avoid  continued  overspending  in  the  future.  In \naddition, these reforms will allow for better forecasting, reviewing, and reporting expenditure. The \nnew indicative action replaces the reform to streamline the health regulatory framework given the \ncomplications  described  in  para.  14.  The  DOF  will  continue  to  update  financial  manuals  and \ninstructions  and  revise  the  implementation  plan  for  procurement.  A  new  indicative  action  for \nsubprogram  3  reflects  the  publication  of  the  PEFA  assessment,  which  is  expected  to  be \ncompleted by end 2019, and work planned to update the reform road map based on its findings. \n \n17. \nReform  area  2:  Subnational  health  system  management  strengthened.  Actions \ncompleted  under  subprogram  2  sought  to  strengthen  the  institutional  arrangements  and \noperations (including planning and budgeting) in the health sector at the provincial level, as well \nas improve flow of funds to the provincial health sector and the capacity to monitor use of these \nfunds. The investment component of the program will reinforce these actions by placing emphasis \non building the capacity of the PHA boards and staff to manage the sector. \n \nAfter  one  new  PHA  was  created  under  subprogram  1,  the  DOH  continued  establishing \n18. \nPHAs under subprogram 2. While originally aiming to establish all 10 remaining PHAs during the \nsubprogram 2 period, the DOH experienced challenges with capacity and issues with approvals \nas a result of the volatile political environment, and instead established six additional PHAs under \nsubprogram 2, with the remainder to be established in subprogram 3. Each PHA signed a formal \npartnership agreement, appointed an acting chief executive officer and a board, which includes \nat  least  one  woman  (on  three  of  the  boards  there  are  two  or  more  women).  To  support  the \nstrengthening of PHAs, the National Executive Council approved regulations for chief executive \nand  contract  officers for PHAs  and  public  hospitals  that  include (i)  responsibilities  and roles  of \nboards; (ii) merit-based selection and performance requirements; (iii) leave entitlements, including \nmaternity and breastfeeding leave; and (iv) disciplinary procedures. The DOH has approved the \nfirst release of a PHA manual with guidelines relating to human resources, financial management, \nand governance. The program project component will support further development of the manual, \nand under subprogram 3 new modules for gender-responsive budgeting and PFM will be included. \n \n19. \nSubprogram 2 progressed several reform initiatives to strengthen the timely and reliable \nfunding  of  PHAs  as  well  as  build  PFM  capabilities  that  are  crucial  for  the  delivery  of  essential \nhealth services across the local facility network. The 2019 national budget put into effect the direct \ntransfers  to  PHAs  for  provincial  and  district  hospital  funding  and  health  function  grants,  as \ndesigned under subprogram 1. Following the implementation of the IFMS as the sole system for \nbudgeting,  accounting,  and  financial  reporting  of  public  funds  in  all  national  departments  and \nselected  statutory  authorities  under  subprogram  1,  the  DOF  started  the  rollout  of  the  IFMS  to \nPHAs to assist in their financial management. In support of this work, the DOH developed and \nendorsed a chart of accounts under subprogram 2 that will allow for gender-responsive budgeting, \naccounting, and reporting of resources at the facility level. This is a newly added policy action. \n \n20. \nAll existing PHAs have prepared budgets that capture all funding sources and specifically \nshow separate maintenance budgets for the provincial hospital, district hospital, and lower level \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fhealth facilities to ensure that infrastructure is maintained. The 11 PHAs that were established \nbefore 2017 produced 2017 annual reports, which have been published for the first time on the \nDOH website. All annual reports contain at least some sex-disaggregated data. The same PHAs \nfurther produced midyear budget execution reports for 2018, which informed the DOT-led midyear \nhealth sector expenditure review. The DOT referred the resulting review recommendations to the \nsecretary-level  Central  Agencies  Coordinating  Committee,  and  its  decisions,  together  with  a \nstatus update on the previous year\u2019s decisions, were published as nonfinancial instructions in the \n2019 budget book.19 Subprogram 3 will continue to support budgeting, and midyear and annual \nreporting of an increasing number of established PHAs, with document quality improving through \ncapacity  building  delivered  by  the  project  investment  of  the  program.  In  addition,  the  Auditor \nGeneral\u2019s Office will audit at least five PHAs and publish the reports under subprogram 3. \n \nReform  area  3:  Health  service  delivery  components  strengthened.  In  seeking  to \n21. \nstrengthen health service delivery, subprogram 2 focused on improving the efficiency of medical \nsupplies  procurement  and  distribution,  and  enhancing  the  health  partnerships  that  guide  the \ndelivery of more than 50% of PNG\u2019s primary health services. Subprogram 1 supported a review \nof outstanding medicine and medical supply orders, and underpinned a renewed focus from the \nPrime  Minister\u2019s  Office  on  the  inadequacy  of  medicine  procurement  and  distribution.  Under \nsubprogram 2, the chief secretary approved a pharmaceutical reform plan to be implemented by \nthe DOH. The DOT established a technical working group to oversee progress of the plan and \nimplementation started with the development of a set of metrics to monitor the supply chain in \nterms of stockouts, emergency orders, backlogs, and expired stock. DOH initiated the recruitment \nof a medical supply and distribution firm with specialist expertise to assist in further reforms which \nwill be continued under subprogram 3. Sound progress enabled a strengthening of the indicative \npolicy action identified at the time of subprogram 1. \n \n22. \nA  new  policy  action  under  subprogram  2  completed  the  update  of  the  drug  catalogue \nbased  on  the  World  Health  Organization\u2019s  essential  medicines  list  that  was  started  under \nsubprogram 1.20 The updated catalogue has been approved by the DOH, was uploaded into the \nlogistics  management  information  system  (LMIS)  used  in  area  medical  stores  and  provincial \nhospitals, and is now the sole source of stock control and order management.21 To support better \nmedical  supplies  management,  a  second  new  policy  action  to  develop  and  endorse  standard \noperating  procedures  for  order  management  was  introduced.  This  builds  upon  the  substantial \nreduction in backlogs achieved under subprogram 1. The new procedures are expected to lead \nto a reduction in the volume of outdated (defined as older than 12 months) and partial orders to \nbelow 10% of all orders and ensure that less than 5% of all drugs ordered are outside the newly \napproved  drug  catalogue.  The  two  new  policy  actions  replace  two  indicative  actions  originally \nrequiring (i) government budgeting for the LMIS, which continues to be funded by a development \npartner; and (ii) the DOH to develop a strategy for the \u201cpull system\u201d for medical supplies, with the \nproject to support this reform as it is more substantial than originally anticipated (para. 21). \n \n23. \nPartnerships  with  churches,  nongovernment  and  civil  society  organizations,  and  the \nprivate sector (including large resource companies) are important in the delivery of health services \nacross  PNG,  particularly  in  rural  and  remote  areas.  The  DOH  approved  a  framework  for  the \nongoing  monitoring  of  these  partnerships  and  their  memoranda  of  understanding.  The \nimplementation of this framework builds on the foundation work done in subprogram 1 to compile \n\n \n\n19 For  2019,  the  budget  book  requires  DOH  to  implement  a  drug  management  system  with  a  database  for  drug \n\nprocurement, management, and monitoring. This will be acted on as part of subprogram 3, reform area 3. \n\n20 The World Health Organization model lists of essential medicines provide a basis for a country to establish their own \n\ncountry context specific drug list. https://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/. \n\n21 In subprogram 1, the DOH also mandated the use of the tender management module of the LMIS for all medicine \n\nprocurement and payments. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\na list of the partnerships and will enable systematic monitoring and reporting on the status of these \npartnerships. The framework also tracks gender-responsive health services delivered by partners, \nand thereby helps the DOH in tracking these and expanding well-performing partnerships in the \nfuture.  With  specifications  added  to  the  indicative  action  defined  at  the  time  of  subprogram  1, \nsubprogram 3 will continue to implement medical supplies procurement and distribution reforms \nwith assistance from a firm to be contracted under the project component of the program, including \nan independent assessment of the current LMIS for suitability and financial sustainability and the \ndevelopment of a 5-year procurement plan and budget. \n \n24. \nADB value addition. The mutually reinforcing project investment, reform implementation, \nand  urgently  needed  financing  provided  under the  program continue  to maximize  ADB\u2019s  value \naddition. The interdepartmental technical working group set up under the program has proven to \nbe  a  valuable  forum  where  central  and  line  agencies  discuss  and  resolve  coordination  and \nprioritization issues beyond the reform program. Further, ADB\u2019s TA continues to provide support \nto the DOT on macroeconomic and fiscal policy design, strategy development, and budget reform, \nand to the DOH on health PFM, including the design of a suitable chart of accounts for PHAs and \nhealth  partnership  management. 22  The  project  component  of  the  program \nleads  the \npharmaceutical procurement reform assistance. ADB prepared a detailed health sector financing \nanalysis, as part of ADB\u2019s support to fragile situations, and this has informed reform specification \nand  implementation  under  subprogram  2  (footnote  7).  The  prioritization  and  sequencing  of \ngovernment reforms through the program further leverages TA by other development partners. \n \n25. \nDevelopment partner coordination. ADB continues to work closely with the Government \nof  Australia,  the  European  Union,  the  IMF,  and  the  World  Bank  to  support  the  government  in \nstrengthening  its  macroeconomic  policy  and  PFM.  The  IMF  and  the  World  Bank  continue \nassistance  around  domestic  resource  mobilization,  and  monetary  and  fiscal  policy  advice. 23 \nAustralia  provides  support  in  PFM  (including  IFMS  implementation),  health  sector  reform \n(including  health  legal  framework review),  and  decentralization.  The  European  Union  supports \nnational  procurement  reform.  The  PFM  working  group  meets  quarterly,  as  do  the  health \ndevelopment  partners.  The  priorities  set  in  the  program\u2019s  policy  matrix,  through  the  technical \nworking group, are shared with development partners in health and PFM roundtables, allowing \ngreater leveraging of development partner support for the implementation of reform priorities. \n \nC. \n \n26. \nThe impacts of the reform contribute to the country\u2019s overarching development objective: \nto provide affordable, accessible, equitable, and high-quality health services for all citizens. At the \naggregate level, the reforms are expected to continue increasing fiscal sustainability by supporting \nreductions in the fiscal deficit and public debt-to-GDP levels by 2022 in line with annual targets \noutlined in the MTFS, while increasing national budget resources available for the health sector. \nIn addition, national and health-sector-specific reforms are expected to increase funds availability, \nand effectiveness and efficiency of resource use along the service delivery chain. The reforms \nare  expected  to  help  increase  average  annual  health  expenditure  at  the  provincial  level  as  a \nproportion  of  estimated  need  to  at  least  80%  of  estimated  need  for  2023\u20132024,  and  improve \navailability  of  essential  medical  supplies  by  substantially  reducing  stockouts  by  2022\u20122023, \namong  others  (Appendix  1).  This  will  contribute  to  improved  services  that  reduce  major  direct \ncosts of disease, including (i) loss of healthy life expectancy and adult earning power; (ii) costs of \n\nImpacts of the Reform \n\n \n\n22 ADB. 2016.

The  program  impact  assessment \nestimates that a 20% reduction in disability-adjusted life years lost through common conditions \ncould result in economic savings of 2%\u20134% of gross national income, equivalent to about $400 \nmillion\u2013$800 million in 2016 (the latest year for which disease burden data for PNG is available).24 \n \nD. \n \n27. \nThe program considers the government\u2019s financing needs; the availability of alternative \nfinancing, including the estimated financial support from other development partners; and debt \nsustainability.  The  IMF  estimates  that  the  government\u2019s  net  borrowing  requirements  between \n2018 and 2020 total about $2.4 billion.25 The 2019 national budget highlights net financing needs \nequivalent to roughly $550 million, some of which will be covered by ADB financial assistance \n(footnote 18). The government has requested a regular loan of $100 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance subprogram 2. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a \ngrace  period  of  3 years;  an  annual  interest rate determined in  accordance with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \nE. \n \n28. \nThe program is expected to be implemented over 40 months from January 2017 to April \n2020. The implementation period for subprogram 2 is March 2018\u2013September 2019. The DOT \nwill  be  the  executing  agency.  The  DOF  and  the  DOH  will  be  the  implementing  agencies.  The \nproceeds of the policy-based loan will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time).26 \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n29. \nFollowing ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), subprogram 2 is classified category \nC for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. Program activities will be \nconfined  to  policy  and  institutional  reforms.  No  activity  will  result  in  or  lead  to  involuntary \nresettlement, or negatively affect indigenous peoples or the environment. \n \n30. \nGender.  Subprogram  2  is  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming  and  focuses  on \nsupporting  sustainable  financial  and  health  system  management  approaches  that  will  provide \nbetter  quality  health  services  for  all,  particularly women and  children.  Policy  actions  include  (i) \nprioritizing health sector budget allocations, with specific focus on ensuring budget for maternity, \nchild health, reproductive health, and family planning services; (ii) supporting women in decision-\nmaking roles in the health sector through ensuring that at least one (out of nine) of the board of \ndirectors for each PHA is a woman; (iii) introducing new PHA and public hospital regulations that \noutline  merit-based  recruitment  methods  and  gender-responsive  leave  entitlements,  including \nmaternity and breastfeeding leave, to encourage the appointment of more women, particularly in \nsenior positions; (iv) including sex disaggregated data in PHA annual reports, and inclusion of \nspecific budget lines for family, maternal, and child health funding at both national and PHA levels \n\n \n\n24 Program  Impact  Assessment  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2).  Common  conditions \nconsidered  in  the  analysis  are  (i)  tuberculosis;  (ii)  childhood-cluster  infectious  and  parasitic  diseases,  including \nmeasles; (iii) malaria; (iv) maternal conditions; and (v) neonatal conditions. Indirect costs and other high prevalence \nconditions, including noncommunicable diseases benefit equally from improved health system functioning. \n25 International Monetary Fund Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 ADB. 2018.

Other gender actions continue to \nbe progressed through the gender action plan as part of project activities. \n \n31. \nPromoting good governance and strengthening PFM are key priorities of the government, \nbut systems and capacities remain fragile. A 2015 PEFA assessment identified substantial gaps, \nwhich are gradually being addressed through reforms identified and sequenced in the PEFA Road \nMap, 2015\u20132019.27 A new PEFA assessment is expected to be completed by end 2019, based \non which the government will develop an updated PFM reform road map. Despite weaknesses \nand  systemic  fragility,  the  government  is  assessed to  have  the  ability  to implement  its  budget, \nwhich is integral to the program\u2019s success. The program and subprogram 2, complemented by \ndevelopment partner TA, contribute to the gradual reduction of critical fiduciary risks, including \nthrough  procurement  reform,  implementation  of  the  IFMS,  and  support  to  subnational  PFM \nsystems. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 2 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 28 ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and the DOT. \n \n\nTable 2: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nHealth funding flows \n\nProcurement corruption \nand collusion \nLow quality and timeliness \nof accounting, financial \nreporting, and monitoring \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nMitigation Measures \nPolicy actions will improve the flow of health function grants for facility operations and \nminor maintenance, while program actions and project activities will contribute to \nallocative and technical efficiency improvements that will help free up and prioritize \nresources for operation and maintenance. \nThe implementation of the National Procurement Act 2018 will achieve changes \naimed at increasing transparency and accountability. \nThe program strengthens public finance management through establishing standard \nprocesses, building capacity through training programs, and strengthening financial \nmanagement information systems to establish better financial controls and \ncompliance. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITION \n\n \n32. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of subprogram 2 shall conform to \nall  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement as  described  in  detail  in  the  loan \nagreement.
