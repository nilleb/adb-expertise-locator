THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased loan to Papua New Guinea (PNG) for subprogram 2 of the Health Services Sector \nDevelopment Program.1 The program comprises an investment and a policy-based lending \ncomponent using a programmatic approach with three subprograms.2 \n \n2.  The program supports fiscal policy, public financial management (PFM), and health sector \nreforms while providing critical financing during a period of sharp fiscal tightening that will enable \nthe Government of Papua New Guinea to safeguard funding for essential health and other basic \nservices. These two elements reinforce each other: (i) the policy-based actions supporting an \nimproved operational context to gain more benefits from health sector investments and (ii) the \nhealth sector investments supporting the implementation of priority policies.  Subprogram 1 \nactions have been sustained and are built upon by subprogram 2 actions, and all 15 subprogram \n1 actions have been sustained. The program supports the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nStrategy 2030 operational priority of strengthening governance and institutional capacity, with \nparticular emphasis on small island developing states.3 \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Health sector issues. Despite health being a priority in PNG since independence, and \nthe government spending substantial resources in the sector, improvements in access and quality \nof health services and health outcomes have been slower than in comparator countries. Despite \nsome improvements in life expectancy, PNG continues to have the lowest life expectancy in the \nPacific region; infant and maternal mortality rates are higher than in countries at similar income \nlevels. Utilization of basic health services has declined markedly between 2006 and 2016.4 At the \ninput level, medical supplies are often not available, the health workforce is insufficient and \nunderperforming, and most health facilities are poorly maintained. Chronic diseases, including \nstrokes and heart disease, dominate the burden of disease, which also includes poverty-related \nillnesses such as pneumonia and neonatal conditions.5 Development constraints in PNG\u2019s health \nsector specifically addressed under this program are (i) complex subnational health system \narchitecture; (ii) incomplete regulatory frameworks; (iii) fragmented fund flow; (iv) weak PFM of \nprovincial health authorities (PHAs),6 including lack of resources for maintenance of health \nfacilities; (v) weak pharmaceutical procurement, distribution, and stock management systems; \n \n1  The design and monitoring framework are in Appendix 1. The program is in the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n2018. Country Operations Business Plan: Papua New Guinea, 2019\u20132021. Manila. It aligns with ADB. 2019.

PHAs have financial autonomy from the provincial governments and are responsible for hospital and primary \nhealth service delivery under guidance from the PHA board, which includes community and women\u2019s representatives. \n \n ", "2 \nand (vi) insufficient oversight of health sector partners and service providers.7 \n \n4.  Recent economic performance. The sharp downturn in global commodity prices in 2015 \nand 2016, coinciding with a severe drought that affected the mining and agriculture sectors, led \nto a rapidly worsening macroeconomic situation in PNG. Implementation of the required sharp \nfiscal consolidation (para. 5) further reduced aggregate demand, leading to a severe economic \ncrisis. While agricultural production and commodity prices partially recovered in 2018, a large \nearthquake in early 2018 disrupted production and exports by the gas, oil, and mining industries, \ndriving a small contraction (Table 1). External financing, including through subprogram 1, helped \nreduce the foreign exchange backlog and, combined with gradual exchange rate adjustment by \nthe Bank of PNG, supported business activity and growth toward the end of 2018. Together with \nthe  full  restoration  of  gas,  oil,  and  mining  production,  this  contributes  to  an  improved \nmacroeconomic outlook over the medium-term, with growth expected to reach 4.8% in 2019 and \nforecast to remain between 2\u20124% during 2020\u20122023.8 This provides the basis for ongoing gradual \nfiscal consolidation while allowing for safeguarding of funding for essential health services, as \nsupported by the program. \n \nTable 1: Selected Economic and Fiscal Indicators \n(% of GDP, unless otherwise indicated) \nItem  2014  2015  2016  2017  2018e  2019p  2020p \nReal GDP growth (% change)  12.5  10.5  2.0  3.0  -0.6  4.8  2.1 \nChange in CPI (% annual average)  5.2  6.0  6.7  5.4  4.7  4.0  3.8 \n                \nCentral government budget               \n  Total revenue  21.0  17.7  15.5  15.2  17.1  15.8  15.6 \n    Tax revenue  18.1  14.7  12.4  12.1  12.7  12.5  12.2 \n    Nontax revenue  1.4  1.7  0.9  1.2  2.2  2.2  2.4 \n    Grants  1.5  1.3  2.1  1.9  2.2  1.1  1.0 \n  Total expenditure  27.3  22.2  20.0  17.6  19.6  18.5  17.3 \n    Recurrent  19.5  18.9  17.9  15.9  17.7  16.1  14.6 \n    Capital  7.8  3.3  2.1  1.7  1.9  2.4  2.7 \n  Fiscal balance  \u20136.3  \u20134.5  \u20134.6  \u20132.4  \u20132.5  \u20132.7  \u20131.7 \n     Excluding external grants  \u20137.9   \u20135.8   \u20136.7   \u20134.3   \u20134.7   \u20133.7   \u20132.7  \nPublic debt  27.1  29.0  32.4  31.2  32.8  31.8  30.8 \n   of which: External debt  6.2  6.5  8.1  8.4  12.1  14.1  13.8 \n               \nNominal GDP ($ billion)   23.2    22.5    21.6    23.7    25.0    26.2    26.9  \nCPI = consumer price index, e = estimate, GDP = gross domestic product, p = projection. \nSource: Government of Papua New Guinea and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n5.  Fiscal performance. Fiscal consolidation\u2014required after an expansionary fiscal policy \ncoinciding with a downturn in global commodity prices and a related drop in domestic revenues \nled to unsustainable fiscal deficits during 2012\u20122014\u2014continued in 2018. With the help of sharp \nexpenditure cuts since 2014, the government was able to balance out eroding revenue collections \nand reduce the fiscal deficit from 6.3% of GDP in 2014 to 2.5% in 2018 (Table 1). Although the \ndeficit is projected to expand to 2.7% of GDP in 2019, this is mostly because of the reduction in \nexternal grants after elevated inflows in 2018 due to the earthquake response.9 Excluding grants, \nthe deficit is seen to narrow by a full percentage point. Gradual reductions to the debt-to-GDP \nratio are forecast over the medium term, supported by expenditure prioritization and tax policy \n \n7  ADB. 2019.

However, the lack of fiscal space and cash flow shortages continue to threaten the funding \nof essential services and require continued political commitment to prioritize limited resources; \nimprove expenditure control and effectiveness, particularly in the areas of procurement, payroll, \nand subnational PFM systems; and increase performance of the public service. Development \nconstraints in the areas of fiscal policy and national PFM systems that are addressed through the \nprogram are (i) an unsustainable fiscal position that risks leaving basic service delivery unfunded, \n(ii) gaps in PFM legislation, (iii) shortcomings in national budget documentation that hinder \ntransparent resourcing of policy priorities as well as legislative and public scrutiny, and (iv) weak \nnational procurement systems. \n \n7.  In mid 2019 PNG experienced political change, with the current Treasurer being appointed \non 27 August 2019. He directed the budget presentation be moved into full alignment with the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) Government Finance Statistics (2014) manual, thus expediting \nchanges already underway and being supported by the program (para. 12).12 This will have \nimplications for budget targets and require an adjustment of the government\u2019s medium term fiscal \nstrategy as 2019 budget execution is assessed and the 2020 budget is developed which will then \nneed to be considered and addressed in Subprogram 3.  \n \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n8.  Government  strategy.  The  country\u2019s  cascading  strategic  planning  framework, \nincorporating the PNG Vision 2050, PNG\u2019s Development Strategic Plan (2010\u20132030), and its \nMedium Term Development Plan 3 (2018\u20132022), outlines PNG\u2019s strong commitment to effective \nleadership, good governance, performance management, and accountability, aiming to provide \nservice  delivery  and  ultimately,  quality  of  life  improvements.13 These  high-level  plans  are \nimplemented through a number of strategies and reform plans, including (i) the National Health \nPlan 2011\u20122020, a medium-term fiscal strategy (MTFS) that provides the framework for the \nannual budget; (ii) the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Road Map 2015\u2012\n2018; and (iii) PFM strategies for the subnational level and the integrated financial management \nsystem (IFMS), which aim to strengthen PFM and enhance service delivery in provinces and \ndistricts.14 Government agencies\u2019 capacity to implement reforms is severely constrained by weak \nmanagement and technical expertise, a small skills pool, limited financial resources, and an infant \nperformance management system. The government has a mixed track record in implementing \nstrategies and achieving targets and there is a risk that implementation will stall because of \nwaning commitment to reform, the complex political economy, limited internal capacities, and a \n \n10 Reforms focused on revenue, including tax policy and administration, are part of an ongoing World Bank program. \nWorld Bank. 2018.

Given these factors, the program will support reform prioritization, \nsequencing, and implementation; alignment of development partner assistance; and incentivize \nreform implementation (in addition to addressing financing needs of basic services). \n \n9.  ADB  engagement.  The  program  combines  a  policy-based  operation  and  a  project \ninvestment  to  support  critical  whole-of-government  and  sector  reforms  with  health  sector \ninvestments. The policy-based loans support fiscal policy, PFM, and health sector reforms while \nthe project loan fill investment gaps to support PNG\u2019s progress toward universal health coverage. \nSubprogram 2 builds on subprogram 1 lessons, which include taking a flexible approach in view \nof emerging technical information and political windows of opportunity, and a stronger emphasis \non development partner collaboration in support of policy actions. The program remains aligned \nwith ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for PNG, 2016\u20132020, supporting its strategic objective of \nconverting the country\u2019s resource wealth into inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic \ngrowth through the operational priorities of primary health and public sector management.15 It will \ncontinue to support the implementation of PNG\u2019s strategic planning framework and related whole-\nof-government and sector reform plans (para. 7), contributing to the National Health Plan\u2019s goal \nof affordable, accessible, equitable, and high-quality health services for all citizens. The targeted \neffect of the reforms is a more sustainable and efficient health care system. As part of the program, \nsubprogram 2 will continue implementation of critical whole-of-government and health sector \nreforms at the national and subnational levels, building upon reform progress made under the first \nsubprogram and on ADB\u2019s prior support for the health sector and public sector management.16 \n \n10.  Policy  actions.  After  close  consultation  with  the  government  policy  actions  for \nsubprogram 2 and indicative actions for subprogram 3 (Appendix 4: Policy Matrix) were specified, \nwith the aim of maximizing reform impact within given technical and political constraints. ADB and \ndevelopment partners\u2019 technical assistance (TA) has facilitated the government\u2019s most critical \nreform endeavors. In developing subprogram 2 indicative actions (identified at the time of \nsubprogram 1) into final policy actions, attention was given to increasing the strength and \nspecificity of each action, integrating and streamlining closely interrelated actions, and highlighting \nareas where the government had gone further than initially expected.  \n \n11.  In reform area 1, an additional, and critical, area of policy engagement has been included \nin subprogram 3 around the improved management of the personal emoluments budget\u2014an area \ncomprising an estimated 31% of budget expenditure in 2019. Reform area 2 saw slower progress \nthan hoped in creation of PHAs (hampered by the fluid political environment, which delayed \nnecessary  dialogue  at  the  senior  political  level,  and  by  delays  in  start-up  of  the  program \ninvestment component). There was, however, stronger progress in financial management through \nthe development of a chart of accounts specifically for PHAs. The MOF had not foreseen this \nduring subprogram 1\u2014it was identified by diagnostics (footnote 7).

These are areas of severely constrained government capacity for implementation, \ncommon in fragile states, and will benefit from continuous capacity development support through \nthe project investment of the program. All changes are elaborated in the summary of changes \nfrom indicative actions.17 Increased specificity and additional actions have ensured the strength \nof the reform impacts have been, at least, maintained. All 17 of the final reform actions in \nsubprogram 2, which support the three reform areas of the program, have been completed. \n \n12.  Reform area 1: National frameworks and PFM enhanced. Actions completed under \nsubprogram 2 sought to build a stronger financial management foundation to support improved \nhealth services delivery, and more broadly, delivery of all government services. \n \n13.  The  government  aligned  the  2019  budget  with  the  MTFS  initially  developed  under \nsubprogram 1.18 The 2019 budget projects public debt to reduce to 31.7% of GDP in 2019, and \ncontinue on this downward trend in line with the target of 30.0% of GDP by 2022. The domestic \nrevenue-to-GDP ratio is projected at 14.8% in 2019, well above the medium-term minimum target \nof at least 14.0% by 2022. Ongoing commitment to health as a key development enabler is \nreflected in the Medium-Term Expenditure Strategy of the MTFS and actual expenditure for 2018, \nand budget allocations for 2019 safeguard essential health services (para. 5). Women and \nchildren, as the main recipients of primary health services, will be the predominant beneficiaries \nof this. The government demonstrated its commitment to improved budget transparency and \ninternational comparability through further enhancements to the budget document to align it with \nthe Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014 of the IMF, done in parallel with the historical \nformat, with a view to shifting solely to the new format in 2020. More recently this has been \nfasttracked (para. 7). The improved classification will allow allocating, tracking, and reporting of \nresources against standard functional classifications. The government has introduced descriptive \ninformation about agencies and programs in the new version of the budget to provide members \nof Parliament with greater clarity on appropriations as well as improve in-year reporting and \nprovide clear budget lines for family, maternal, and child health. \n \n14.  The Department of Finance (DOF) further reviewed the Public Finances (Management) \nAct 1995 (as amended in 2016) to ensure alignment with the new procurement and other related \nlegislation,  and  to  reflect  reforms  implemented  from  the  PEFA  Road  Map,  2015\u20122018. \nParliamentary approval of a further amendment to the Public Finances (Management) Act in 2018 \nstrengthened the policy action; in comparison, the indicative action required only completion of \nreview of the act. The National Procurement Act 2018 (based on the new procurement policy \ncompleted under subprogram 1) came into force in April 2019, with subprogram 2 supporting DOF \nendorsement of a 2-year implementation plan for the act. As a first step, DOF launched a new \npublic procurement website to provide transparent information regarding tenders and awards, \nwhich again strengthens the indicative action identified at the time of subprogram 1 requiring only \nprocurement plan approval. \n \n15.  Intended action by the Department of Health (DOH) to streamline the legal framework for \nhealth, after subprogram 1 supported the development of a discussion paper, has been removed \nfrom the program. This is a result of the discussion paper\u2019s recognition of the complex nature of \nthis reform. While a critical piece in the government\u2019s health and decentralization reform agenda \nis to realign and simplify the legislative framework for health, it is expected that the necessary \nbroad-based consultation will take several years to enable drafting instructions to be approved \nand intermediate actions would be heavily process oriented and unsuitable for program inclusion. \n \n17 Summary of Changes from Indicative Actions (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Government of Papua New Guinea. 2018. 2019 National Budget, Volume 1. Port Moresby. \n ", "6 \nThe DOH carried out initial consultations and a summary report was submitted to the minister of \nhealth in 2019. The project component of the program will continue to support and monitor \nprogress given its long-term impact on the ongoing delivery of health services. The shift of this \naction to being supported by the project investment is balanced by stronger PFM actions (para \n14) so subprogram strength is maintained \n \n16.  Subprogram  3  will  continue  to  track  the  MTFS  targets  to  ensure the  government\u2019s \ncontinued transition to a more sustainable fiscal path, while preserving prioritization of funding for \nhealth services. The Department of Treasury (DOT) will introduce reforms to better manage the \nlarge personal emolument expenditures and avoid continued overspending in the future. In \naddition, these reforms will allow for better forecasting, reviewing, and reporting expenditure. The \nnew indicative action replaces the reform to streamline the health regulatory framework given the \ncomplications described in para. 14. The DOF will continue to update financial manuals and \ninstructions and revise the implementation plan for procurement. A new indicative action for \nsubprogram  3  reflects  the  publication  of  the  PEFA  assessment,  which  is  expected  to  be \ncompleted by end 2019, and work planned to update the reform road map based on its findings. \n \n17.

Actions \ncompleted  under  subprogram  2  sought  to  strengthen  the  institutional  arrangements  and \noperations (including planning and budgeting) in the health sector at the provincial level, as well \nas improve flow of funds to the provincial health sector and the capacity to monitor use of these \nfunds. The investment component of the program will reinforce these actions by placing emphasis \non building the capacity of the PHA boards and staff to manage the sector. \n \n18.  After one new PHA was created under subprogram 1, the DOH continued establishing \nPHAs under subprogram 2. While originally aiming to establish all 10 remaining PHAs during the \nsubprogram 2 period, the DOH experienced challenges with capacity and issues with approvals \nas a result of the volatile political environment, and instead established six additional PHAs under \nsubprogram 2, with the remainder to be established in subprogram 3. Each PHA signed a formal \npartnership agreement, appointed an acting chief executive officer and a board, which includes \nat least one woman (on three of the boards there are two or more women). To support the \nstrengthening of PHAs, the National Executive Council approved regulations for chief executive \nand contract officers for PHAs and public hospitals that include (i) responsibilities and roles of \nboards; (ii) merit-based selection and performance requirements; (iii) leave entitlements, including \nmaternity and breastfeeding leave; and (iv) disciplinary procedures. The DOH has approved the \nfirst release of a PHA manual with guidelines relating to human resources, financial management, \nand governance. The program project component will support further development of the manual, \nand under subprogram 3 new modules for gender-responsive budgeting and PFM will be included. \n \n19.  Subprogram 2 progressed several reform initiatives to strengthen the timely and reliable \nfunding of PHAs as well as build PFM capabilities that are crucial for the delivery of essential \nhealth services across the local facility network. The 2019 national budget put into effect the direct \ntransfers to PHAs for provincial and district hospital funding and health function grants, as \ndesigned under subprogram 1. Following the implementation of the IFMS as the sole system for \nbudgeting, accounting, and financial reporting of public funds in all national departments and \nselected statutory authorities under subprogram 1, the DOF started the rollout of the IFMS to \nPHAs to assist in their financial management. In support of this work, the DOH developed and \nendorsed a chart of accounts under subprogram 2 that will allow for gender-responsive budgeting, \naccounting, and reporting of resources at the facility level. This is a newly added policy action. \n \n20.  All existing PHAs have prepared budgets that capture all funding sources and specifically \nshow separate maintenance budgets for the provincial hospital, district hospital, and lower level \n ", "7 \nhealth facilities to ensure that infrastructure is maintained. The 11 PHAs that were established \nbefore 2017 produced 2017 annual reports, which have been published for the first time on the \nDOH website. All annual reports contain at least some sex-disaggregated data. The same PHAs \nfurther produced midyear budget execution reports for 2018, which informed the DOT-led midyear \nhealth sector expenditure review. The DOT referred the resulting review recommendations to the \nsecretary-level Central Agencies Coordinating Committee, and its decisions, together with a \nstatus update on the previous year\u2019s decisions, were published as nonfinancial instructions in the \n2019 budget book.19 Subprogram 3 will continue to support budgeting, and midyear and annual \nreporting of an increasing number of established PHAs, with document quality improving through \ncapacity building delivered by the project investment of the program. In addition, the Auditor \nGeneral\u2019s Office will audit at least five PHAs and publish the reports under subprogram 3. \n \n21.  Reform area 3: Health service delivery components strengthened. In seeking to \nstrengthen health service delivery, subprogram 2 focused on improving the efficiency of medical \nsupplies procurement and distribution, and enhancing the health partnerships that guide the \ndelivery of more than 50% of PNG\u2019s primary health services. Subprogram 1 supported a review \nof outstanding medicine and medical supply orders, and underpinned a renewed focus from the \nPrime Minister\u2019s Office on the inadequacy of medicine procurement and distribution. Under \nsubprogram 2, the chief secretary approved a pharmaceutical reform plan to be implemented by \nthe DOH. The DOT established a technical working group to oversee progress of the plan and \nimplementation started with the development of a set of metrics to monitor the supply chain in \nterms of stockouts, emergency orders, backlogs, and expired stock. DOH initiated the recruitment \nof a medical supply and distribution firm with specialist expertise to assist in further reforms which \nwill be continued under subprogram 3. Sound progress enabled a strengthening of the indicative \npolicy action identified at the time of subprogram 1. \n \n22.  A new policy action under subprogram 2 completed the update of the drug catalogue \nbased  on  the  World  Health  Organization\u2019s  essential  medicines  list  that  was  started  under \nsubprogram 1.20 The updated catalogue has been approved by the DOH, was uploaded into the \nlogistics management information system (LMIS) used in area medical stores and provincial \nhospitals, and is now the sole source of stock control and order management.21 To support better \nmedical supplies management, a second new policy action to develop and endorse standard \noperating procedures for order management was introduced. This builds upon the substantial \nreduction in backlogs achieved under subprogram 1. The new procedures are expected to lead \nto a reduction in the volume of outdated (defined as older than 12 months) and partial orders to \nbelow 10% of all orders and ensure that less than 5% of all drugs ordered are outside the newly \napproved drug catalogue. The two new policy actions replace two indicative actions originally \nrequiring (i) government budgeting for the LMIS, which continues to be funded by a development \npartner; and (ii) the DOH to develop a strategy for the \u201cpull system\u201d for medical supplies, with the \nproject to support this reform as it is more substantial than originally anticipated (para. 21). \n \n23.  Partnerships with churches, nongovernment and civil society organizations, and the \nprivate sector (including large resource companies) are important in the delivery of health services \nacross PNG, particularly in rural and remote areas. The DOH approved a framework for the \nongoing  monitoring  of  these  partnerships  and  their  memoranda  of  understanding.  The \nimplementation of this framework builds on the foundation work done in subprogram 1 to compile \n \n19 For 2019, the budget book requires DOH to implement a drug management system with a database for drug \nprocurement, management, and monitoring. This will be acted on as part of subprogram 3, reform area 3. \n20 The World Health Organization model lists of essential medicines provide a basis for a country to establish their own \ncountry context specific drug list. https://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/. \n21 In subprogram 1, the DOH also mandated the use of the tender management module of the LMIS for all medicine \nprocurement and payments. \n ", "8 \na list of the partnerships and will enable systematic monitoring and reporting on the status of these \npartnerships. The framework also tracks gender-responsive health services delivered by partners, \nand thereby helps the DOH in tracking these and expanding well-performing partnerships in the \nfuture. With specifications added to the indicative action defined at the time of subprogram 1, \nsubprogram 3 will continue to implement medical supplies procurement and distribution reforms \nwith assistance from a firm to be contracted under the project component of the program, including \nan independent assessment of the current LMIS for suitability and financial sustainability and the \ndevelopment of a 5-year procurement plan and budget. \n \n24.  ADB value addition. The mutually reinforcing project investment, reform implementation, \nand urgently needed financing provided under the program continue to maximize ADB\u2019s value \naddition. The interdepartmental technical working group set up under the program has proven to \nbe a valuable forum where central and line agencies discuss and resolve coordination and \nprioritization issues beyond the reform program. Further, ADB\u2019s TA continues to provide support \nto the DOT on macroeconomic and fiscal policy design, strategy development, and budget reform, \nand to the DOH on health PFM, including the design of a suitable chart of accounts for PHAs and \nhealth  partnership  management. 22  The  project  component  of  the  program  leads  the \npharmaceutical procurement reform assistance. ADB prepared a detailed health sector financing \nanalysis, as part of ADB\u2019s support to fragile situations, and this has informed reform specification \nand implementation under subprogram 2 (footnote 7). The prioritization and sequencing of \ngovernment reforms through the program further leverages TA by other development partners. \n \n25.  Development partner coordination. ADB continues to work closely with the Government \nof Australia, the European Union, the IMF, and the World Bank to support the government in \nstrengthening  its macroeconomic  policy  and  PFM.  The  IMF  and  the World  Bank  continue \nassistance around domestic resource mobilization, and monetary and fiscal policy advice.23 \nAustralia  provides  support  in  PFM  (including  IFMS  implementation),  health  sector  reform \n(including health legal framework review), and decentralization. The European Union supports \nnational  procurement  reform.  The  PFM  working  group  meets  quarterly,  as  do  the  health \ndevelopment partners. The priorities set in the program\u2019s policy matrix, through the technical \nworking group, are shared with development partners in health and PFM roundtables, allowing \ngreater leveraging of development partner support for the implementation of reform priorities. \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n26.  The impacts of the reform contribute to the country\u2019s overarching development objective: \nto provide affordable, accessible, equitable, and high-quality health services for all citizens. At the \naggregate level, the reforms are expected to continue increasing fiscal sustainability by supporting \nreductions in the fiscal deficit and public debt-to-GDP levels by 2022 in line with annual targets \noutlined in the MTFS, while increasing national budget resources available for the health sector. \nIn addition, national and health-sector-specific reforms are expected to increase funds availability, \nand effectiveness and efficiency of resource use along the service delivery chain. The reforms \nare expected to help increase average annual health expenditure at the provincial level as a \nproportion of estimated need to at least 80% of estimated need for 2023\u20132024, and improve \navailability of essential medical supplies by substantially reducing stockouts by 2022\u20122023, \namong others (Appendix 1). This will contribute to improved services that reduce major direct \ncosts of disease, including (i) loss of healthy life expectancy and adult earning power; (ii) costs of \n \n22 ADB. 2016.

The  program  impact  assessment \nestimates that a 20% reduction in disability-adjusted life years lost through common conditions \ncould result in economic savings of 2%\u20134% of gross national income, equivalent to about $400 \nmillion\u2013$800 million in 2016 (the latest year for which disease burden data for PNG is available).24 \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n27.  The program considers the government\u2019s financing needs; the availability of alternative \nfinancing, including the estimated financial support from other development partners; and debt \nsustainability. The IMF estimates that the government\u2019s net borrowing requirements between \n2018 and 2020 total about $2.4 billion.25 The 2019 national budget highlights net financing needs \nequivalent to roughly $550 million, some of which will be covered by ADB financial assistance \n(footnote 18). The government has requested a regular loan of $100 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance subprogram 2. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a \ngrace period of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n28.  The program is expected to be implemented over 40 months from January 2017 to April \n2020. The implementation period for subprogram 2 is March 2018\u2013September 2019. The DOT \nwill be the executing agency. The DOF and the DOH will be the implementing agencies. The \nproceeds of the policy-based loan will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time).26 \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n29.  Following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), subprogram 2 is classified category \nC for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. Program activities will be \nconfined to  policy  and institutional reforms.  No  activity  will  result  in  or  lead to  involuntary \nresettlement, or negatively affect indigenous peoples or the environment. \n \n30.  Gender. Subprogram 2 is classified effective gender mainstreaming and focuses on \nsupporting sustainable financial and health system management approaches that will provide \nbetter quality health services for all, particularly women and children. Policy actions include (i) \nprioritizing health sector budget allocations, with specific focus on ensuring budget for maternity, \nchild health, reproductive health, and family planning services; (ii) supporting women in decision-\nmaking roles in the health sector through ensuring that at least one (out of nine) of the board of \ndirectors for each PHA is a woman; (iii) introducing new PHA and public hospital regulations that \noutline merit-based recruitment methods and gender-responsive leave entitlements, including \nmaternity and breastfeeding leave, to encourage the appointment of more women, particularly in \nsenior positions; (iv) including sex disaggregated data in PHA annual reports, and inclusion of \nspecific budget lines for family, maternal, and child health funding at both national and PHA levels \n \n24 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). Common conditions \nconsidered in the analysis are (i) tuberculosis; (ii) childhood-cluster infectious and parasitic diseases, including \nmeasles; (iii) malaria; (iv) maternal conditions; and (v) neonatal conditions. Indirect costs and other high prevalence \nconditions, including noncommunicable diseases benefit equally from improved health system functioning. \n25 International Monetary Fund Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 ADB. 2018.

Other gender actions continue to \nbe progressed through the gender action plan as part of project activities. \n \n31.  Promoting good governance and strengthening PFM are key priorities of the government, \nbut systems and capacities remain fragile. A 2015 PEFA assessment identified substantial gaps, \nwhich are gradually being addressed through reforms identified and sequenced in the PEFA Road \nMap, 2015\u20132019.27 A new PEFA assessment is expected to be completed by end 2019, based \non which the government will develop an updated PFM reform road map. Despite weaknesses \nand systemic fragility, the government is assessed to have the ability to implement its budget, \nwhich is integral to the program\u2019s success. The program and subprogram 2, complemented by \ndevelopment partner TA, contribute to the gradual reduction of critical fiduciary risks, including \nthrough procurement reform, implementation of the IFMS, and support to subnational PFM \nsystems. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 2 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.28 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and the DOT. \n \nTable 2: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nHealth funding flows  Policy actions will improve the flow of health function grants for facility operations and \nminor maintenance, while program actions and project activities will contribute to \nallocative and technical efficiency improvements that will help free up and prioritize \nresources for operation and maintenance. \nProcurement corruption  The implementation of the National Procurement Act 2018 will achieve changes \nand collusion  aimed at increasing transparency and accountability. \nLow quality and timeliness  The program strengthens public finance management through establishing standard \nof accounting, financial  processes, building capacity through training programs, and strengthening financial \nreporting, and monitoring  management information systems to establish better financial controls and \ncompliance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITION \n \n32.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of subprogram 2 shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan \nagreement. It is a condition of loan effectiveness that the government has met the policy actions \nfor the release of the tranche for the second subprogram, and those policy actions continue to be \nin effect. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n33.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan of $100,000,000 to Papua New Guinea for subprogram 2 of the Health Services Sector \nDevelopment Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with interest to \nbe determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \n \n27 IMF. 2015.
