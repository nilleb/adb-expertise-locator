THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased loan (PBL) and a precautionary financing option (PFO) loan to the Cook Islands for the \nSupporting Sustainable Economic Recovery Program. \n \n2.  The program will assist the Cook Islands in restoring fiscally-sustainable growth led by the \nprivate sector, which has been adversely affected by the impacts of the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) pandemic. The program supports the government\u2019s ongoing reforms to (i) improve \nfiscal management and sustainability, and (ii) strengthen the enabling environment for the private \nsector. Ten policy actions completed under the program address longer-term development \nconstraints as well as immediate recovery needs. The reforms aim to reopen the economy, better \nmanage the fiscal and cash position, improve tax compliance, promote competition, ease labor \nshortages, and improve business registration are already being implemented (paras. 23\u201334). \n \n3.  While the Cook Islands has taken significant steps towards reopening its borders\u2014initially \nclosed in March 2020 to prevent the entry of COVID-19\u2014the pace of recovery from COVID-19 \nimpacts remain highly uncertain.1 Further shocks from COVID-19 could delay the revival of \ntourism, which is a mainstay of the economy. Any unwinding of the nascent economic recovery \ncould jeopardize outcomes supported by the program, forcing the Cook Islands into a fiscal crisis, \nweakening public sector service provision (including services to the poor), and  escalating \nemigration pressure as in previous crises, with detrimental long-term development impacts. \n \n4.  The government requested $80 million  (NZ$111.08 million) in  cumulative  financing \nthrough a single-tranche, stand-alone PBL and a PFO loan, based on program reforms.2 The PFO \nmodality  permits  deferred disbursements in  case  the  tourism  recovery is  delayed.3  The \ndisbursement of $40 million equivalent under the PBL will meet the development financing needs \nfor fiscal year (FY) 2022 under an expected economic recovery.4 The $40 million equivalent PFO \nloan will be made available for potential future drawdowns if conditions supporting fiscal recovery \ndeteriorate, based on predefined conditions (paras. 44\u201347). The PFO mitigates the vulnerability \nof the Cook Islands should the recovery falter and will have a positive development impact by \nhelping  ensure  the  continuity  of  public  sector  operations,  social  services  to  vulnerable \nhouseholds, and the private sector recovery (para. 40). The PFO is particularly important because \nthe Cook Islands has relatively few options for financing support\u2014it has no access to international \ncredit markets, lacks developed local financial markets for government debt, is not a member of \nthe International Monetary Fund (IMF) nor the World Bank, and does not have a central bank to \nprovide emergency liquidity. A conventional PBL modality was selected over a countercyclical \nsupport facility to sustain the reform momentum and leverage additional reforms, including \nthrough a post-program partnership framework (PPPF); and because the government does not \n \n1  As of 1 November 2021, the Cook Islands only had a single border case of COVID-19, and no deaths. \n2  A single-tranche, stand-alone (instead of a multitranche or programmatic) PBL is proposed as program reforms are \nalready under implementation, prior to consideration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Board of Directors. \n3  The COVID-19 shock has already taken a toll on the Cook Islands, but further adverse impacts cannot be ruled out. \nPer ADB\u2019s Operations Manual, \u201cthe PFO may be exercised when it is highly likely that the impacts of the exogenous \nshock will reach the recipient country but have not fully materialized at the time of ADB\u2019s financing commitment.\u201d \nADB. 2021. Policies and Procedures. Operations Manual. OM D4. Manila, issued on 19 January. \n4  If the recovery proceeds as planned, the government may not need a disbursement under the PFO. No further \ndevelopment financing needs are projected through to FY2025 under the baseline recovery scenario, which assumes \na resumption of quarantine-free travel (QFT) with New Zealand in December 2021, no future disruptions in FY2022 \nof more than 1 month, and no additional grant support from development partners in FY2022.  However, if the \neconomic situation did deteriorate rapidly and necessitate urgent development financing, the preparation and timing \nof a second subprogram or tranche could delay disbursement, with adverse long-term consequences.   \n \n ", "2 \nplan new countercyclical expenditures beyond those previously enacted.5 It will be the first use of \na PFO alongside a conventional PBL. \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n5.  Background. The Cook Islands has a population of 17,580 (in 2020) spread across \n15 remote South Pacific islands and 2 million square kilometers of ocean. It is one of the region\u2019s \nmost tourism-dependent countries\u2014tourism receipts rose from 43.3% of gross domestic product \n(GDP) in FY2012 to 61.4% of GDP in FY2019. This led to rapid development, and basic needs \npoverty fell from 28.4% in 2006 to 8.4% in 2016.6 But growth is hampered by a small population, \nnarrow economic base, high exposure to disaster and climate risks, weak business climate, \ncapacity constraints, and high public administration and infrastructure costs. \n \n6.  Sound  macroeconomic  management.  Before  the  pandemic,  the  Cook  Islands \nimplemented sound economic policies that contributed to an average annual GDP growth of 6.7% \nduring FY2016\u2013FY2019.7 Prudent fiscal management contributed to fiscal surpluses averaging \n4.6% of GDP in this period and helped accumulate cash reserves of $91.0 million (25.8% of \nFY2020 GDP), of which $13.0 million is protected by law to meet debt servicing requirements. \nThe country seldom uses program support to meet development financing needs.8 Under the \nCook Islands Fiscal Framework, the fiscal deficit must not exceed 1.9% of nominal GDP unless \nthere is an economic shock\u2014and the country has adhered to this framework in 19 of the 20 years \nprior to COVID-19.9 Total revenue increased from 36.4% of GDP in FY2016 to 42.3% in FY2019. \nExpenditure was contained, averaging 37.5% of GDP over FY2016\u2013FY2019. Public debt was \n17.1% of GDP in FY2020, down from a peak of 26.4% of GDP in FY2016. \n \n7.  Economic impact of COVID-19. Despite avoiding the entry of COVID-19, the pandemic-\ninduced border closure caused visitor arrivals to collapse and tax collection (71.9% of FY2019 \nrevenue) to decline by an estimated 42.0% in FY2021, threatening a fiscal liquidity crisis.10 GDP \nfell by 5.9% in FY2020 and an estimated 26.0% in FY2021, to almost one-third below the pre-\nCOVID-19 levels. This, along with countercyclical support and increased health expenditures \nwidened the fiscal deficit to $75.3 million (28.5% of GDP) in FY2021, diminishing available \ngovernment cash reserves to $21.2 million (7.1% of GDP) and increasing debt to 41.9% of GDP.11 \n \n5  A countercyclical support facility was not deemed an appropriate modality because the loan proceeds would not \nsupport a new countercyclical expenditure program. The Medium Term Fiscal Strategy (MTFS) (para. 24) commits \nthe government to fiscal consolidation in FY2022\u2013FY2025 if borders are open, and a limited continuation of previous \nsupport measures if borders are closed. Per ADB\u2019s Operations Manual, \u201cthe countercyclical support facility requires \na developing member country to have a countercyclical development expenditure program and to commit to its \nimplementation.\u201d ADB. 2021.

An \u201cexit clause\u201d allows the deficit to exceed 1.9% in case of a disaster (and subsequent state of \nemergency) or a severe economic shock (defined as real economic growth of \u20132% or less). \n10  In the absence of a central bank, there is no independent monetary policy leverage.  \n11 ADB supported the government\u2019s countercyclical response with loans of $10.06 million under the Pacific Disaster \n \n \n ", "3 \n8.  Quarantine-free travel. To promote recovery, the Cook Islands started quarantine-free \ntravel (QFT) with New Zealand tourists on 17 May 2021. It was one of the first Pacific islands to \nestablish QFT.12 It was a coordinated effort with the Government of New Zealand, led on the Cook \nIslands\u2019 side by the Border Easement Taskforce (BET) (para. 29). QFT was suspended on 17 \nAugust 2021 because of COVID-19 cases in New Zealand, confirming the vulnerability of QFT to \nrapid closures. Prior to the suspension, visitor arrivals in July 2021 had reached 66.7% of their \nmonthly pre-pandemic record\u2014which shows that visitor arrivals can quickly recover once QFT \nresumes, even if only open to New Zealand travelers.   \n \n9.  Macroeconomic outlook. Economic growth is expected to rebound to 7.1% in FY2022, \nassuming that QFT with New Zealand restarts by December 2021 and disruptions can be avoided \nfor the rest of FY2022. This scenario also assumes that the FY2022 fiscal deficit will be contained \nat 14.4% of GDP. Tourism arrivals, a key determinant of the recovery, are expected to return to \npre-pandemic levels by FY2024. Fiscal deficits (including grants) are projected to narrow, with a \nnearly balanced budget projected by FY2023.13 As outlined in the revised Medium Term Fiscal \nStrategy (MTFS), which commits to fiscal consolidation in the near term, capital projects will be \nrescheduled if grant financing is not forthcoming (para. 24). The Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nassesses the general direction of macroeconomic policies to be satisfactory and debt to be \nsustainable, although subject to significant downside risks (para. 49).    \n \n10.  Fiscal constraints. The government recognizes the weaknesses in fiscal management \nthat must be overcome to support the transition from immediate recovery to sustainable growth \n(paras. 11\u201314). Limited fiscal space can constrain growth and economic development. While \nCOVID-19 forced the government to deviate from its established fiscal parameters in the short \nterm, it is important to restore a sustainable fiscal position in the medium term.  \n \n11.  Deviation from fiscal rules. The FY2020 MTFS was conceived prior to COVID-19 when \nfiscal responsibility rules were consistently followed.14 The government responded to the COVID-\n19 impacts with increased stimulus expenditures, deviating from its medium-term goals relating \nto fiscal deficits, expenditure ceilings, and debt (para. 6). While allowing for deviations from set \nfiscal rules when faced with a crisis, the FY2020 MTFS does not provide guidance on a return to \nfiscal responsibility rules once those rules have been breached. Since fiscal decision-making is \nfundamentally different after the COVID-19 crisis, the MTFS must be updated to ensure fiscal \nconsolidation and a transition to long-term growth and sustainability. \n \n12.  Management of cash reserves. Without a central bank or access to credit markets, a \ncash liquidity crisis would disrupt essential services, public sector employment (55.8% women), \n \nResilience Program (Phase 2) and $20  million under the COVID-19 Active Response and Economic Support \nProgram. The Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund provided $1 million, and ADB technical assistance (TA) provided \n$0.27 million for essential medical equipment. The Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative helped draft the \nCOVID-19 (Economic Response) Act 2020. ADB undertook a rapid social assessment to evaluate COVID-19 impacts \non vulnerable groups. ADB. Cook Islands: Pacific Disaster Resilience Program (Phase 2); ADB.

During FY2015\u2013FY2019,  annual arrivals from Taipei,China \naveraged 11% of Palau\u2019s total annual arrivals compared with 67% for New Zealand arrivals into the Cook Islands. \n13  Macroeconomic Assessment (Summary) (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14  Government of the Cook Islands. Fiscal Strategy  and  Economic  update:  June  2019.  Rarotonga. The fiscal \nresponsibility rules act as fiscal anchors and include public debt (no more than 35% of GDP), overall fiscal balance \n(cannot exceed a deficit of 1.9% of GDP), expenditure (cannot grow by more than 4% per year), and cash reserves \n(equivalent of 3 months of expenditure to be held in cash at any time). \n \n ", "4 \nand the private sector recovery. Since cash reserves were not a challenge to fiscal management \nbefore COVID-19, present frameworks to manage monthly cash flows are underdeveloped and \ninformal. As cash becomes the key constraint to government budget continuity, it is critical to plan \nmonthly expenditures, source timely external financing, and recognize an impending crisis in \nadvance.15  ADB\u2019s  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economic \nManagement (MFEM) found that poor interagency collaboration presented significant risks in \nplanning for, and responding to, the emerging cash liquidity crisis.16 \n \n13.  Tax compliance issues. After tax reforms from 2011 to 2015, the Cook Islands achieved \na relatively high domestic revenue mobilization rate of 38.7% of GDP by FY2019. However, mixed \ncompliance led to growing arrears, estimated at NZ$43.8 million in December 2020. COVID-19 \nhas brought hardship to many taxpayers, and it is expected that compliance risks and demand \nfor taxpayer support in the face of severe business challenges will increase. Outstanding arrears \n(which have risen since the pandemic) and inadequate voluntary tax compliance constrain the \ncash position in the short term, as well as the longer-term fiscal recovery.  \n \n14.  Credibility of fiscal management. Audit reports are not always produced and disclosed \non time, posing risks to accountability and transparency.17 By November 2020, the Audit Office \nhad completed audits of the financial statements of the government and all public entities until \nFY2019. However, the inability to publish audit reports without Parliament  first tabling and \ndiscussing them meant that 5 years of reports (para. 27) were not available to the public. Also, no \nlegal framework exists to ensure the independence of the Audit Office. Audit officers are liable to \nprosecution when executing their role, potentially impairing their objectivity. \n \n15.  Private sector constraints. The private sector faces several constraints arising from \nremoteness and small size, compounded by the absence of appropriate policy and legislation to \nstrengthen the business environment (paras. 16\u201320). COVID-19 intensified these challenges. \nTraditionally, tourism helped mitigate the effects of small domestic markets and provided private \nsector employment, especially to the 36.7% of the workforce in tourism jobs (60.5% of them \nwomen). While the options for diversification are limited, the private sector will play a key role in \ndevelopment and support the government's fiscal stability through increased tax collections.  \n \n16.  Border management challenges. COVID-19 brought more health and preparedness \nrequirements for crossing international borders. The border closures helped to prevent COVID-\n19 cases domestically, but tourism was severely impacted. As any first step to recovery, cross-\nborder travel with the main tourism market of New Zealand (67.2% of the Cook Islands\u2019 FY2019 \nvisitor arrivals) will be essential. Effective border management, establishment of QFT, and prompt \nresolution of any disruptions to QFT require the setting of policies and procedures with New \nZealand. This is central to maintaining confidence in the Cook Islands as a COVID-19-safe travel \ndestination. Before the BET was formed (para. 29), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Immigration \ndid not have the institutional capacity to assess, implement, and monitor the strict health and \npreparedness requirements to negotiate QFT with New Zealand. \n \n \n15 A government liquidity and debt crisis precipitated the last major economic shock in the Cook Islands in 1996, when \nthe population declined by 5.7% in the 5 years to 2001,  although at that time the main driver was structural \ngovernment spending rather than a cyclical downturn in revenue.

Rarotonga.  \n \n ", "5 \n17.  Labor market frictions. Labor demand outstrips supply with migrant workers (53.3% of \nthem women) accounting for 18% of the estimated overall workforce in 2011, and for almost one-\nthird of all labor in the tourism sector.18 On top of the repatriation of foreign workers during the \npandemic, about 5.0% of the Cook Islands residents left for New Zealand between January and \nApril 2021, exacerbating labor shortages during the recovery. Work permits for migrants have \nhistorically been tied to individual employers who must pay  the travel  costs, a  bond, and \ngovernment fees. Migrant workers ran the risk of having to leave the Cook Islands unless the \noriginal employer gave them formal consent to move to a  new employer. With businesses \nrecovering at different rates, asymmetries have emerged in the local employment market\u2014some \nbusinesses are unable to repatriate idle foreign workers, while others are unable to source labor. \n \n18.  Weak general immigration processes. The process for sourcing work permits is lengthy, \nnon-transparent, and not codified in law. The discretionary powers of the principal immigration \nofficer are broad and not open to review or appeal. Migrant workers do not enjoy the same labor \nstandards as local Cook Islanders, leading to possible abuses from employers who hold permits. \nThis is particularly concerning in light of the high proportion of women migrant workers in the \ntourism industry, where victims of exploitation are often unable to access a dispute resolution \nmechanism because of their vulnerable position and liability to deportation. Modernizing current \npractice and  clarifying these issues is  imperative  to  enable transparent access  to  permit \ncategories, strengthen worker protections, and provide legal and process certainty to all parties. \nThe first steps in this direction are being taken (paras. 30\u201331). \n \n19.  Administrative burden of government registry services. Business registration, annual \nlodgments, and registration of security over movable assets are cumbersome and paper-based. \nRegistering a business requires assistance from lawyers and agents to physically file the right \ndocumentation, which increases the administrative burden and the barriers to participation, \nincluding for women. Moreover, with no central registry, security interests over movable assets\u2014\nsuch as machinery, accounts receivable, or inventory\u2014as collateral for loans are difficult to verify, \nand act as a barrier to lending, particularly for those without fixed assets. In 2017, Parliament \npassed the Companies Act, the Personal Property Securities Act, and the Incorporated Societies \n(Amendment) Act, but their implementation remains incomplete without supporting processes, \nregulations, ability to access company records, or a central registry of movable assets.19 \n \n20.  Insufficient competition in telecommunications. High costs of basic utilities pose \nchallenges to businesses and reduce the competitiveness of tourism. In telecommunications, the \nmonopoly provider is unregulated and provides poor connectivity at a high cost. Retail charges in \nCook Islands are costlier than those of regional peers, but the completion of the Manatua deep-\nsea cable, partly funded by ADB, brings an important opportunity for reform.20 For now, insufficient \nregulation and oversight, and the absence of retail competition still hamper service delivery, \nalthough improvement efforts are underway (para. 34). Competition will benefit consumers and \nbusinesses through lower cost, more choices, and better quality. Lower telecommunications \nprices will also benefit tourism and retail services and improve access (including for women).  \n \n21.  Strategic alignment. The program supports the Cook Islands\u2019 Economic Development \nStrategy 2030, which seeks to address constraints to inclusive and sustainable growth, including \nthrough better macroeconomic and fiscal management, public service delivery, and private sector \n \n18 United Nations Population Fund. 2015.

The government has progressed its longer-term reform agenda \ndespite  capacity  limitations  and  the  diversion  of  resources  to  respond  to  the  severe \nsocioeconomic impacts of COVID-19. Program policy actions address the government\u2019s own \nneeds and priorities, in response to policy challenges intensified by COVID-19.24 The program \ncomprises 10 policy actions, all of which have been completed. \n \n23.  Reform area 1: Fiscal management and sustainability. Restoring fiscal stability is \nessential to support immediate recovery and long-term economic growth and development. This \nreform area comprises four policy actions (paras. 24\u201327), which were designed with ADB support, \nincluding in economic modeling, strategic planning, and cash and fiscal monitoring (para. 37). \n \n24.  Fiscal strategy. The cabinet approved a new MTFS for FY2022\u2013FY2025 in October \n2021, and MFEM commenced implementation. It includes cash, debt, and fiscal targets consistent \nwith preserving social protection payments, providing macroeconomic stability, and supporting \neconomic growth. It aligns the government\u2019s path with the fiscal responsibility rules (footnote 14) \nand has a cash reserve target as the principal fiscal anchor. The new MTFS is consistent with the \nFY2022 budget, which commits the government to maintain public debt below 65% of GDP, limit \ngrowth in operational expenditure ceilings across the forward estimates to 2% a year (or in line \nwith inflation), and safeguard social protection measures for the vulnerable.25 Once the economy \nhas returned to pre-pandemic levels of GDP, expected in FY2024, the MTFS targets will be \nrevised to have public debt as the principal fiscal anchor.26   \n \n25.  Cash management. The cabinet approved a Cash Management Strategy in October \n2021, with adjustment measures if cash reserves fall below a critical limit.27 The strategy is \nanchored on responsible fiscal management, derived from debt and fiscal targets in the MTFS. \nThrough the  Cash  Management Committee  (CMC), MFEM operationalized a  consolidated \nmodeling  framework  for  cash  management,  forecasting,  and  monitoring;  strengthened \n \n21 Government of the Cook Islands. 2021.

Rarotonga. \n26  The revision may occur earlier if the economy has recovered to its pre-COVID-19 level and fiscal surpluses have \nbeen restored. During FY2022\u2013FY2025, ceilings on operational expenditures not related to the economic recovery \nare held constant, with the capital pipeline being the main fiscal tool to adjust to development partner assistance or \nimproved fiscal conditions. \n27  The cash reserves are defined as reaching a critical limit when they fall below NZ$20 million. The Cash Management \nCommittee (CMC) defines this as the lowest level to maintain fiscal stability over a given 2-week period of government \noperations. This is indicated in the Cash Management Strategy as triggering emergency adjustment measures. \n \n ", "7 \ninteragency coordination; and provided timely modeling and information to the minister of finance, \nsecretary of finance, and development partners on the government cash position.28 The improved \nand  CMC-backed framework processes formalized the  collaboration  between government \nagencies and development partners and also informed the revisions to the MTFS. \n \n26.  Tax compliance. In March 2020, the tax comptroller approved and MFEM's Revenue \nManagement Division began to implement the 2020\u20132022 compliance improvement strategy to \nreinforce tax  compliance, intensify the collection of arrears, and accelerate the issuance of \nrefunds. So far, the division has operationalized a compliance risk register, formalized quarterly \nmeetings to monitor performance, and standardized monthly manager reports. Other initiatives it \ncompleted are standard operating procedures for major tax processes (including collection of \narrears), and the formation of an enterprise team that focuses on the largest 40 businesses.  \n \n27.  Audit reporting. Parliament  passed amendments to the Public Expenditure Review \nCommittee and Audit Act in May 2020 to improve the timeliness and transparency of audit \nreporting and protect Audit Office staff from prosecution when performing their official duties. The \namendments allow for the publication of government audit reports 14 days after they have been \nlodged with the Speaker of Parliament regardless of whether the Public Accounts Committee has \nreviewed the reports, or whether the reports are tabled or discussed in Parliament. The Audit \nOffice began the implementation in February 2021, and the audit reports for FY2015\u2013FY2019 \nhave been published on the MFEM website and are available for public scrutiny.  \n \n28.  Reform area 2: Enabling environment for the private sector. The private sector will \ncontinue to be central in the immediate fiscal and economic recovery as well as the longer-term \ndevelopment of the Cook Islands. This reform area has six policy actions (paras. 29\u201334), which \nwere designed with the support of ADB, including policy, technical, and legislative support to the \ngovernment in undertaking reforms to drive private sector growth and competition (para. 37). \n \n29.  Border management. To support tourism recovery and employment, where women \naccount for 60.5% of the workforce, the government established the multi-agency BET in April \n2021 (accountable to the Prime Minister) to oversee comprehensive steps to get the Cook Islands \nready for QFT with New Zealand and address QFT disruptions promptly.29 The steps implemented \nunder BET oversight include setting up a website to communicate COVID-19-related updates, \nlaunching a contact-tracing mobile application, training frontline staff in COVID-19 response \nmeasures (and selected health workers in administering COVID-19 vaccines), and managing the \npublic alert levels for community responses. The BET is responsible for establishing policies and \nprocedures with New Zealand on border management and is central to ensuring that disruptions \nto border and COVID-19 management are resolved quickly. \n \n30.  Flexibility in work permits. From July 2021, the principal immigration officer began \nimplementing flexibility in the procedures for migrant worker permits to allow the workers to \nundertake new or secondary employment beyond their initial permit sponsor without having to \ndepart the country and re-enter. This reduces the frictional costs of hiring new foreign workers, \n \n28 The CMC includes Treasury Management Division of the MFEM  (chair), as well as its Revenue Management \nDivision, Economic Planning Division, and Major Projects Division; the Government of New Zealand; and ADB. For \nADB, the CMC acts as a program steering committee enabling policy dialogue and advisory support.  \n29 The BET makes recommendations to the cabinet on COVID-19 control measures and border management. Members \nare the secretaries of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Immigration (chair), Ministry of Health, MFEM, Cook Islands \nTourism Corporation, Office of the Prime Minister, Public Service Commission, and Crown Law. Actions undertaken \nunder the oversight of the BET target the reopening of borders, and are additional to the measures in the Economic \nResponse Plan supported by ADB. Cook Islands: COVID-19 Active Response and Economic Support Program. \n \n ", "8 \ngives migrant workers more mobility, and helps private businesses meet labor shortages during \nthe recovery from the pandemic. If employers cannot reach an agreement between themselves, \nthe Labour Technical Committee will assist the transfer of work permits through mediation, \nsupport, and, if required, a recommendation to the principal immigration officer on a course of \naction. This will allow workers who find themselves in poor work conditions or in dangerous \nsituations to seek alternative employment without the threat of deportation. The policy change \nalso allows for a universal 6-month waiver on all permit fees to mitigate business costs. \n \n31.  Immigration reform. The cabinet tabled a new immigration bill in Parliament in April 2021 \nto tackle the longer-term challenges around labor shortages and improve transparency by \ncodifying visa categories, selection criteria, and application processes, including a requirement to \njustify rejected applications and a formal appeals process.30 The codified protection measures will \nbenefit migrant workers, about half of whom are women. By eliminating discretionary decision-\nmaking, businesses can engage in a rules-based immigration system. The bill also strengthens \nthe rights of children by changing the definition of a \u201cCook Islander\u201d from a blood connection to a \nfamilial one, enabling children legally adopted by Cook Islanders to also be considered nationals. \nSimilarly, children born overseas to permanent residents would be able to inherit the status by \ndescent, without competing with potential applicants under the permanent resident quota.  \n \n32.  Online registry. The cabinet approved regulations in December 2019 to govern digital \nbusiness and securities registration. The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) implemented the regulations \nby establishing an integrated online platform for the filing of (and access to) company records, \nbusiness names,  business licenses, incorporated associations,  and  for registering security \ninterests over movable assets. This will improve access for entrepreneurs (including women) to \nregistry services without the use of lawyers or other proxies and enable the collection of sex-\ndisaggregated data. The MOJ made online filing compulsory from 2020. The online registry allows \n24-7 interaction between the ministry and users, which especially benefits women, who are often \nprimary caregivers with family responsibilities during office hours. The registry records securities \nin a centralized database so that lenders may determine whether a proposed borrower has \npreviously pledged particular collateral to secure a previous loan. This makes risk assessments \neasier and allows lending services even when businesses lack land to be pledged as collateral. \n \n33.  Competition regulator. Parliament approved the Competition and Regulatory Authority \nAct in December 2019 and the establishment of the Competition and Regulatory Authority (CRA). \nThis addressed the problem of scattered regulatory authority across different departments, \nboards, and appointees by vesting the responsibility for regulating multiple sectors in a single, \nindependent, expert authority accountable to Parliament. The CRA was granted investigative, \nsearch, and enforcement powers as well as separate appropriations starting with the FY2022 \nbudget, which ensures its independence. Its chair was appointed on 31 March 2020. \n \n34.  Telecommunications reform.  Parliament  passed  the  Telecommunications  Act  in \nDecember 2019 to eliminate monopoly protection, allow licensing of new providers, and enable \nthe regulation of wholesale prices. The act is expected to result in the entry of more service \nproviders, including small and innovative niche players, to be regulated by the CRA. This will lead \nto better services and lower prices for businesses and consumers, and tourism will benefit from \nbetter retail service delivery. The act provides for the regulation of interconnection and wholesale \npricing terms to facilitate market competition. The CRA issued four licenses to additional operators \nunder the act to increase competitive pressure, with one licensee starting operations in 2021.  \n \n30  The bill also allows for educational permits, a new category that may support economic diversification since domestic \ninstitutions of higher education follow regional qualification standards, notably including those of New Zealand. \n \n ", "9 \n \n35.  Post-program partnership framework. To ensure the sustainability of policy actions, \nADB developed a PPPF with the government. Under reform area 1, the government will follow \nthe MTFS, and regularly track its monitorable indicators. The government will continue to refine \nthe cash management model. The Revenue Management Division will further boost voluntary \ntaxpayer compliance by implementing an outreach strategy to improve public awareness, and will \nalso enhance service delivery, update the revenue management system, and prepare of a tax \nadministration bill to improve administrative capabilities. The tax administration reforms benefit \nfrom ongoing support from the IMF's Pacific Financial and Technical Assistance Centre. Under \nreform area 2, government expects to improve the private sector environment by expanding the \nonline registry to include process support for the foreign company registration and back-office \nsupport for financial services. Government also committed to the approval and implementation of \nthe Utilities Regulation Policy, which will  expand the CRA\u2019s  role to include the regulatory \nsupervision of utilities such as power, water, and sanitation. \n \n36.  Partner coordination. ADB has coordinated closely with relevant development partners, \nparticularly the Government of New Zealand, and both ADB and New Zealand attend the monthly \nCMC meetings with Cook Islands government officials. They have also shared information on the \napproval timelines for additional support, government financing needs, capacity gaps, and risks \nto recovery. New Zealand disbursed a NZ$30 million ($21.1 million) grant in parallel cofinancing \nto the program in July 2021 to support the economic and fiscal recovery, enacted an agreement \non QFT, and continues to provide close support to COVID-19-related response measures in Cook \nIslands government agencies and the private sector (including the provision and distribution of \nCOVID-19 vaccines).31 The IMF Pacific Financial and Technical Assistance Centre provided \ntechnical support to the Revenue Management Division's tax compliance improvement strategy \nand continues to assist the division on legislative, compliance, and administrative reforms. \n \n37.  ADB\u2019s value addition. The program builds on reforms supported by several earlier ADB \ninterventions. ADB continues to assist MFEM in economic modeling, strategic planning, and cash \nand fiscal monitoring (footnote 16). ADB also trained MFEM officials in strengthening their debt \nsustainability analysis.32 It peer-reviewed the 2021 public expenditure and financial accountability \nassessment (footnote 17) to identify reform priorities, and remains engaged in technical cash \nmanagement discussions through the CMC. In addition to supporting the COVID-19 response \n(footnote 11), ADB provided loan financing for the Manatua deep-sea cable (footnote 20), which \ncatalyzed the telecommunications reform (para. 34). ADB TA was instrumental in providing policy, \ntechnical, and legislative support for the telecommunications reform, establishing the CRA, and \nthe online business registry.33 ADB also prepared a $2 million project from the Japan Fund for \nPoverty Reduction to support the aviation and health sectors.34 \n \n38.  Regional cooperation and integration. The program promotes regional cooperation and \nintegration by supporting QFT, which will enable regional tourism to recover and safeguard the \nlivelihoods of migrant workers. Other Pacific islands are using the New Zealand\u2013Cook Islands \nQFT as a pilot for regional adaptation of QFT arrangements. Improvements in labor mobility for \nmigrants and the codification of immigration practices will assist the incomes of migrant workers, \nensure stronger immigration  management,  and  strengthen labor  protections for migrants. \nTelecommunication reforms and the introduction of competition will enhance the new bandwidth \n \n31  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32  ADB.

Sustainability and lessons. The program considers key lessons from the use of the PFO \nin a countercyclical support facility for Indonesia, namely: (i) the PFO is a valuable instrument \nsupporting effective macroeconomic and fiscal management during periods of market turbulence; \n(ii) it is important to strengthen government\u2019s economic monitoring and surveillance, and facilitate \nthe exchange of views on economic performance between government, ADB, and other partners; \nand (iii) it is vital to promote sustainability and continuity in the government\u2019s reform agenda by \nensuring that priority spending is maintained and financing needs are met.35 The program includes \npolicy actions prioritized by the government, avoids overloading limited capacity, builds on earlier \nand ongoing reforms for sustainability, improves economic monitoring and  surveillance, and \nresponds to uncertain development financing needs.36 The program is also sensitive to lessons \nfrom a previous economic crisis in the Cook Islands in addressing the Cook Islands\u2019 high exposure \nto cash liquidity constraints (caused by relatively limited development partner support options and \nthe absence of a central bank), and the significant emigration risk arising from the access to the \nNew Zealand passport by Cook Islands nationals.37 The program focuses on prior policy actions \nthat will mitigate the contingent financing needs or improve the government's crisis response. \nADB will continue close coordination with partners on providing complementary TA to implement \nreforms, remain engaged in policy discussion through the PPPF, and ensure sustainability. \n \nC.  Expected Outcome of the Reforms \n \n40.  The  program  aligns  with  the  government\u2019s Economic  Development Strategy  2030 \n(para. 21). The outcome will be: fiscally sustainable private-sector-led economic growth in the \nCook Islands restored. Supported by reform area 1, it is expected that the Cook Islands will stay \nbelow its revised debt target, avoid a liquidity crisis, strengthen tax compliance, and improve fiscal \nsustainability for better development outcomes. Reform area 2 will support QFT, enabling a \nrecovery in tourism, related employment, and business income; reduce labor shortages by \nincreasing labor mobility for migrant workers; help improve immigration management; lower \nbusiness compliance costs through the online registry; promote the use of movable capital for \nlending; and improve telecommunication services to support investment and reduce costs.38 \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n41.  Development financing needs. Following the disbursement of New Zealand\u2019s grant in \n2021 (para. 36), the FY2022 fiscal deficit is estimated to be $43.0 million (14.4% of GDP) in the \nbaseline recovery scenario, in which QFT returns to being operational from December 2021 \n(Table 1). Without further external assistance, government cash reserves are estimated to fall \nbelow 1 month of expenditure requirements in December 2021 and  be fully exhausted by \nFebruary 2022. With $40 million in loan financing by December 2021 through the PBL under the \nADB program, cash reserves at the end of FY2022 will be almost 2 months of expenditures\u2014\nslightly below the government cash target of 3 months (set out in the FY2020 MTFS) but meeting \nthe immediate development financing need, as indicated by the fiscal deficit.  \n \n \n35  ADB.

The government has requested two regular loans totaling NZ$111.08 million ($80 million \nequivalent) from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to finance the program\u2014a PBL of NZ$55.54 \nmillion ($40 million equivalent) and a PFO loan of NZ$55.54 million ($40 million equivalent).39 \nEach loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; and an annual interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility. Repayments of the PFO loan will  be based on a  disbursement-linked amortization \nschedule. Both loans will have a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the annuity method, the average \nmaturity of the PBL is 10.39 years and, based on straight-line method, average maturity of the \nPFO loan is 12.25 years; there is no maturity premium payable to ADB for either loan. \n \n43.  Need for precautionary financing. If the current suspension of QFT is prolonged (or \nother factors disrupt QFT in the future), the nascent recovery could unravel quickly. In that case, \nif the border remained closed until February 2022 (or longer), the FY2022 fiscal deficit is estimated \nto widen from $43.0 million in the baseline recovery scenario to $81.4 million (or more) through \ndeclines in revenue and increased need for public support. The program will meet this risk through \nthe PFO, which will support program outcomes by providing additional support if financing needs \nescalate more quickly than the government\u2019s ability to source other financing (para. 4). \n \n44.  Structure of precautionary financing. The PFO loan provides rapid financing if market \nconditions supporting the economic and fiscal recovery deteriorate at short notice, as determined \nby macroeconomic conditions. The timing of the subsequent disbursements depends on the Cook \nIslands\u2019 macroeconomic situation. If the economic recovery is strong enough, the PFO loan may \nnot need to be drawn down. PFO loan conditions must be independently verifiable, timely relative \nto the reference period, reflect the ability of the government to meet immediate cash needs, and \ninclude the continued fulfillment of agreed policy actions. The PFO loan can be drawn down only \non or after 1 April 2022, subject to the drawdown conditions (paras. 45\u201347).40 \n \n \n39  NZ$1.39 = $1.00 (as of 25 October 2021). The government\u2019s Development Policy Letter is in Appendix 3. \n40  Following the initial disbursement under the program, the government is estimated to have sufficient financing until \n1 April 2022, even if borders remain closed. The start of the availability period on 1 April 2022 will also allow a \nminimum assessment period of 3 months to smooth any short-term volatility in visitor arrivals. \n \n ", "12 \n45.  Condition 1: Tourism arrivals. Visitor arrivals are the key driver of economic recovery. \nTourism is a  significant contributor to domestic taxation,  which in turn drives government \nrevenues, which must recover for improved macroeconomic conditions to lead to improved fiscal \nbalances. Tourism data are publicly available  within 2\u20133 weeks of the reference period and \nrepresent a more efficient verification method than determining government revenue, since tax \nreturns take up to 2 months after the reference period to be fully processed and reconciled.  \n \n46.  The government estimates the critical level of tourism to be 130,000 cumulative visitor \narrivals over 12 months (or 10,833 arrivals per month).41 From January 2022, monthly arrivals at \nor above this level will facilitate sufficient government revenues to support planned expenditures \nwithout the need for external support.42 Monthly arrivals are expected to achieve the pace required \nto meet 130,000 arrivals over a 12-month period soon after QFT is restored, and be maintained \nabove this level thereafter.43 However, if the number  of visitor arrivals is below this level, the Cook \nIslands will likely require additional support from development partners or through the PFO loan. \nThe first drawdown condition for the PFO loan is as follows:  \n(i)  If the request for drawdown is submitted between 1 April 2022 and 31 December 2022, \nthen the government needs to show that the average monthly number of visitor arrivals \nfrom 1 January 2022 until the month preceding the request for withdrawal under the \nPFO loan is below the critical figure of 10,833 visitors per month;44 or  \n(ii)  If the request for drawdown is submitted after 1 January 2023, then the government \nneeds to show that the number of cumulative visitor arrivals over the 12-month period \npreceding the submission of a request for withdrawal is less than 130,000 visitors.   \n \n47.  Condition 2:  Continued satisfaction of  policy  actions and  continued sound \nmacroeconomic management. For the PFO loan to be disbursed, the government must (i) show \nthat all  policy actions under the program continue to be complied with, without reversals of \ncompleted actions; (ii) include relevant development partners, including ADB, in the monthly \nmeetings of the CMC; and (iii) demonstrate sound macroeconomic and fiscal management by (a) \nmaintaining public debt below 65% of GDP and limiting growth in operating expenditure ceilings \n(exclusive of expenditure funded by grants) to 2% per year (or the average rate of inflation over \nthe past 2  years, whichever is greater), in line with the revised MTFS; (b) applying measures for \naddressing a liquidity crisis as set out in the Cash Management Strategy; and (c) utilizing all non-\ndebt financing options available to meet government financing needs.45   \n \n41  The figure of 130,000 visitor arrivals is slightly below the arrivals in FY2016, about 75% of the arrivals in calendar \nyear 2019 (just prior to border closure), and about 80% of the annual average for 2016\u20132019. As of 1 September \n2021, cumulative arrivals in the preceding 12 months were 26,783, reflecting the COVID-19 impacts. \n42  At 130,000 cumulative visitor arrivals, annual government tax revenue is estimated at about $75 million. \n43 Monthly visitor arrivals had exceeded the monthly target within 2 months of QFT commencing on 17 May 2021, with \nJuly (12,405) and August on track if QFT had remained in place, based on arrivals until 17 August. The Cook Islands \narrivals accounted for about 29% of outbound New Zealand travelers in July, when QFT was available to both \nAustralia and the Cook Islands and less than 18% of the adult population in New Zealand was fully vaccinated. Given \nthe vaccination rates as of 4 October 2021,  80% of the New Zealand adult population is estimated to be fully \nvaccinated by the end of November 2021, which is expected to further support the growth in QFT visitor arrivals into \nthe Cook Islands in early 2022, since few alternative destinations are currently available.  \n44  For example, in April 2022, the PFO condition would be met if visitor arrivals between 1 January 2022 and 31 March \n2022 averaged below the target figure of 10,833 per month. If QFT reopens in December 2021 and the Cook Islands \ncaptures only 6.0% of outbound New Zealand visitors (based on the 2017\u20132020 first quarter departures adjusted for \nvaccination rates), visitor arrivals will exceed 10,900 a month in the first quarter of 2022.  The Cook Islands accounted \nfor about 4.2% of total outbound New Zealand travelers in 2019, rising to 29.0% during QFT in July 2021.  \n45  The government must certify that all requirements under condition 2 have been met. Operating expenditure ceilings \nexclude any capital spending, social protection payments, and debt servicing costs. Measures  in the Cash \nManagement Strategy  in response to critical cash needs include reprioritization of current programs and/or \n \n \n ", "13 \n \n48.  Availability period of precautionary financing. The PFO loan will be available  for \ndisbursement on or after 1 April 2022 until 31 December 2024. This will allow for the PBL \ndisbursement to be fully utilized prior to the potential use of the PFO loan and provides about 2 \nyears after meeting the target of 130,000 annual visitors for cash reserves to be sustained at the \ntarget level of 3 months, as set out in the MTFS. GDP is also projected to revert to pre-pandemic \nlevels by FY2024. The government may request the PFO loan in a single or multiple drawdowns. \nThe provision for multiple drawdowns under the PFO loan reflects the fact that the total financing \nneed will not be known at the time of the withdrawal application. The PFO drawdown conditions \nwill prevail for all disbursements during the availability period. If the PFO loan is not disbursed or \nnot fully disbursed, any undisbursed balance as of 31 December 2024, shall be cancelled.   \n \n49.  Debt sustainability. ADB assesses public debt to be sustainable in the medium term, \nand the level of debt and debt servicing to remain within the parameters of the revised MTFS \n(para. 24).46 If the program is approved, the $40 million equivalent disbursement in FY2022 under \nthe PBL is projected to increase public debt to 49.6% of GDP in FY2022 before declining to 35.6% \nby FY2024. If the $40 million equivalent PFO loan is also fully disbursed in FY2022, the debt\u2013\nGDP ratio will increase to 62.6% in FY2022 before falling to 46.0% by FY2024.   \n \n50.  Debt servicing is projected to remain manageable if the program is approved. In FY2026, \nafter the 3-year grace period, the initial $40 million equivalent disbursement under the PBL will \nadd $4.2 million to the annual debt service. Debt servicing is estimated to rise from $17.0 million \nin FY2026 to a peak of $22.7 million in FY2030 (equivalent to an estimated 4.6% of GDP or 11.1% \nof total revenue in FY2030) and decline thereafter. If the $40 million equivalent PFO loan is fully \ndrawn, debt servicing is estimated to peak at $26.6 million in FY2030 (equivalent to 5.4% of GDP \nand 13.0% of total revenue) and decline thereafter. However, the disbursement of the PFO loan \nwill reduce the debt headroom that  would have  been otherwise available  for infrastructure \ninvestment and could have implications for future projects financed by development partners. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n51.  MFEM will be the executing agency for the overall program, and will provide semiannual \nmonitoring reports to ADB. The implementing agencies responsible for specific policy actions are \nthe Audit Office, MFEM, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Immigration, MOJ, and CRA. ADB will \nbe a member of the CMC throughout the availability period of the PFO loan, which will facilitate \nthe monitoring of PFO loan conditions. The program implementation period is from 1 December \n2019 to 1 December 2021, with the PFO loan being available for disbursement from 1 April 2022 \nthrough to (and including) 31 December 2024. The proceeds of the loans will be withdrawn \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time).47 \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n52.  Governance. The 2021 public expenditure and financial accountability assessment notes \nthe implementation of several reforms. Significant improvements were achieved in  budget \nclassification and  documentation, central  government operations, fiscal risk reporting, debt \n \nrescheduling of capital projects in consultation with the CMC (which includes ADB). Non-debt financing may include \n(but not be limited to) grants provided from development partners or government revenues recovering more than \nexpected (even if visitor arrivals under condition 1 have not been achieved). \n46  Debt  Sustainability Analysis (accessible from the  list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

However,  challenges  remain  in \nprocurement, public investment management, bank account reconciliation, reporting on budget \nexecution, internal audit, external audit, and legislative scrutiny. Reform area 1 of the program \nserves to improve governance. ADB staff will monitor the implementation of the MTFS and cash \nmanagement policy actions, and ADB TA will provide implementation support to MFEM (para. \n37). Greater  independence of audit  officers and  timeliness of audit  reports will  increase \ntransparency. Reform area 2 supports greater transparency and a  rules-based approach to \nimmigration management, removal of discretionary policy, and the addition of appeal and dispute \nprocesses. The regulation of the telecommunication industry was made more transparent by \nensuring the independence of the CRA with secure funding and direct reporting to Parliament. \n \n53.  Poverty and social. Direct impacts on the poor include better employment outcomes, \nlower costs of starting and running businesses, and improved telecommunication services. \nImproved public financial management will safeguard funding of essential services. It will identify \nprecursors to a liquidity crisis, and contingency financing will minimize disruptions in essential and \nsocial services. The program will indirectly benefit the vulnerable by increasing the government\u2019s \ncapacity to respond to shocks or disruption of social protection (around 6,000 beneficiaries).48 \n \n54.  Gender. The program is classified effective gender mainstreaming. Reforms will support \nwomen\u2019s economic empowerment and increase the protection of vulnerable women, including \nfemale migrant workers. Under reform area 1, policy actions help ensure that public sector \nemployment is maintained, benefiting women (55.8% of total employees), particularly those in \nservice roles (61.8%). The updated MTFS safeguards social welfare payments, and continued \nsupport for families with children, vulnerable women, and caregivers. Under reform area  2, \ninitiatives to reopen borders to international visitors supports tourism workers, 60.5% of whom are \nwomen. Immigration reforms will increase employment mobility and labor protection for migrant \nworkers, about half of whom are women and 60% of whom earn minimum wages. The reforms \ninclude new dispute resolution processes that better protect women and men who find themselves \nin harsh work conditions or dangerous situations\u2014they now can seek alternative employment \nwithout the threat of deportation. The tabled immigration bill strengthens the rights of children by \nenabling children legally adopted by Cook Islanders to be considered nationals, and allowing \nchildren born overseas to permanent residents to inherit the permanent resident status. The \nintegrated online business platform will improve access for women entrepreneurs to registry \nservices by removing the need for lawyers or other proxies, allowing access outside of standard \nbusiness hours, and reducing the time to search for and/or file documents. It will encourage more \nsmall-scale investment using movable property as collateral for loans, which helps women who \nare not landowners, and will allow the collection of sex-disaggregated data.  \n \n55.  Safeguards. Following ADB\u2019s  Safeguard Policy  Statement  (2009), the  program  is \nclassified category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. Program \nactivities will  be confined to policy and institutional reforms. The prior policy actions were \nassessed and are not expected to result in or lead to involuntary resettlement, or negatively affect \nindigenous peoples or the environment. \n \n56.
