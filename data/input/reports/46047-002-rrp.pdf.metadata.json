I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Guangxi  Nanning  Vocational  Education \nDevelopment Project. \n \n2.  The project seeks to improve the quality and relevance of technical and vocational \neducation and training (TVET) for preschool education and health care in two demonstration \nsecondary level TVET schools in Nanning Municipality, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region \n(GZAR).  Quality  improvements  to  be  generated  by  the  project  include  upgrading  campus \nfacilities  and  equipment  to  support  expanded  enrollment,  developing  competency-based \nstandards  and  curricula,  improving  teacher  training,  establishing  training  bases,  and \nstrengthening TVET management.1   \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Rapid urbanization has contributed significantly to economic growth in the PRC and \nimproved living conditions for millions of citizens throughout the country. This success has \ncreated new challenges for local governments to address growing disparities in access to and \ndemand for the delivery of quality basic social services, such as education and health. In \nresponse, the PRC Government\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015 outlines measures to \nestablish \u201ca sound and sustainable basic public service system,\u201d with a focus on improving \npublic education and health services.2 The plan is supported by recent reforms in the education \nand health sectors to provide universal kindergarten access and improve primary health care \nservices in rural and urban areas.  \n \n4.  Urbanization  and  the  ambitious  plans  for  economic  transformation  create  both  a \nchallenge and an opportunity for the education sector, and especially for the TVET subsector. \nStrengthening TVET to create skilled workers in the manufacturing and service sectors is an \nimportant priority of the government. In 2010, the government identified TVET as the key target \nfor  educational  expansion  in  its  National  Medium-  and  Long-term  Education  Reform  and \nDevelopment Plan, 2010\u20132020, which seeks to better align the education system with the goals \nof  inclusive  and  sustainable  growth.  The  areas  of  policy  reform  include  expanding  and \nincreasing  access  and  equity  in  TVET,  modernizing  curriculum  and  teaching  methods, \nstrengthening the role of employers, and TVET school management. \n \n5.  The National Medium- and Long-term Education Reform and Development Plan, 2010\u2013\n2020 underlines the commitment of the government to supporting early childhood development \nthrough  expansion  of  preschool  education  so  that  by  2020,  1-year  preschool  will  be \nuniversalized.3 Promoting early childhood development is an essential base on which to build \nfuture human resources and address root causes of intergenerational poverty and sources of \ninequality. The goals of the Twelfth Five Year Plan, 2011\u20132015 include establishing a basic \nmedical and health system covering urban and rural residents and improving accessibility, \nquality, efficiency of services, and patient satisfaction by 2015. In 2010, there were 178 million \npeople in the PRC over the age of 60 and by 2050 the number is expected to exceed 480 \n                                                \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance. \n2  National People\u2019s Congress. 2011. Twelfth Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development 2011\u2013\n2015. Beijing. \n3  Overall, preschool students in the PRC will increase from 26.58 million in 2009 to 40.00 million by 2020. ", "2 \n \nmillion. There is an urgent need to expand elderly care and health services with well-trained \npersonnel for the emerging job market, which is projected to create more than 5 million new jobs \nin home, community, and institutional elderly care services.  \n \n6.  Nanning  is  the  capital  city  of  GZAR,  one  of  the  12  less-developed  provinces  and \nautonomous regions in the western part of the PRC and a gateway to the Pan-Beibu Gulf and \nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations region. The municipality has a total population of \n7.07  million  (53%  ethnic  minority),  is  mainly  rural,  and  covers  an  area  of  22,112  square \nkilometers. The development of Nanning as a regional hub has led to an annual growth rate of \n15.5%. Industrialization and urbanization have created a rising demand for  social services \nworkers in rural and urban areas.  \n \n7.  Currently, there is a severe shortage of qualified kindergarten teachers and schools and \nmedical personnel. By 2020. GZAR will build, renovate, or expand 6,628 kindergarten schools \nand increase enrollment to 1.33 million, necessitating the employment of an additional 21,000 \nnew teachers.4 In 2011, only 600 preschool teachers graduated from TVET programs in GZAR. \nThe Nanning Municipal Government (NMG) must also build a health system to respond to the \nincreased demand and ensure service quality in rural and urban areas. In 2010, the national \naverage was 7.6 health personnel per 1,000 urban residents, but GZAR has an average of only \n3.6 health personnel per 1,000 residents. Nanning Municipality has an average of 5.35 health \npersonnel per 1,000 urban residents and 0.76 personnel per 1,000 rural residents.5 \n \n8.  TVET is rapidly expanding in GZAR in response to opportunities generated by local and \nregional development. New enrollments increased by more than 200% from 2005\u20132012 and are \nlargely filled by rural and ethnic minority students. There is a need to expand TVET facilities and \nimprove quality of TVET provision to ensure that it is market responsive and socially inclusive.6 \nThe new campus of the Nanning Health School (NHS) will allow the school to consolidate its \ncampuses and be a part of a new \u201ceducational park\u201d where different institutions can share \nresources. It will support the school\u2019s goal of expanding into a college and offering several \nlevels of education. The Nanning No. 4 Vocational and Technical School (NVTS) campus was \nbuilt in the 1960s and has not had any major improvements for over 20 years. The improved \nfacilities will support increased enrollment and the development of a kindergarten training base, \nwhich would be the first in GZAR. \n  \n9.  The Government of the PRC has shown a strong commitment in the reform agenda to \nimproving TVET quality and industry partnerships. But implementing the reforms effectively at \nthe school level has proven to be a challenge. Teachers often lack industry work experience, \nare unable to effectively design curricula, and use outdated teaching and assessment methods. \nStudents learn few soft skills, which are especially important in the service sectors, and have \nlittle opportunity for practical training, making them ill-equipped to enter the job market. Industry \npartnerships are evolving but are not systematic in helping to guide curriculum development. \nMany teachers have little knowledge about national and international good practices, and they \nlack mentoring partnerships for management and staff with leading institutions. To address \nthese challenges for kindergarten teacher training at the NVTS and nurse training at the NHS, \nthe project will complement the national TVET reform agenda by improving the quality of (i) \n                                                \n4  People\u2019s Government of GZAR. 2011. Action Plan for 3-year Preschool Education in Guangxi. Nanning. In 2010, \nGuangxi had a total of 5,349 kindergartens serving 1.18 million students and employing 37,000 kindergarten \nteachers. \n5  Nanning has 23,518 village clinics, of which only 8.7% are public. \n6  The majority of students at both the NHS and NVTS are ethnic minorities, and many rural ethnic minority \ncommunities will benefit from improved service provision. \n ", "3 \n \ncurriculum development and teacher training, (ii) human resource development, (iii) industry\u2013\nschool cooperation, and (iv) national and international partnerships with leading institutions. The \nproject will also establish kindergarten and rural health training bases, and construct facilities \nand provide equipment for the NHS and NVTS. \n \n10.  Strategic fit. The project is the second ADB-financed TVET project in the PRC and will \nplay a demonstration role for the development of social services TVET in the PRC and other \ncountries. It supports ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC,7 Strategy 2020,8 ADB\u2019s \neducation policy, and education and health sector strategies. The project supports the PRC\u2019s \nTwelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015, which prioritizes developing high-quality human resources \nand public sector services, and accelerating educational reform, especially in TVET. \n  \n11.  Special features. The project includes \n(i)  Development of elderly care curriculum for the nursing program. This will \nhelp the NHS be more responsive to demographic shifts and emerging industry \nneeds, and position students for employment in services that are expected to \nexpand significantly. The project will create a bridging mechanism for students in \nthe elderly care certificate program to upgrade their skills and facilitate transfers \nto the nursing program, creating new pathways for career advancement. \n(ii)  Development  of  pilot  training  bases  in  kindergarten  teaching  and  rural \nhealth.  The  project  will  establish  training  bases  for  practical  training  in \nkindergarten teaching and rural health services. The bases will provide inputs to \ncompetency-based curricula (CBC) development and improve TVET quality. \n(iii)  Greening campuses. The project will contribute to the government\u2019s objectives \nof  developing  an  environmentally  sustainable  and  energy-efficient  society  by \ndesigning, constructing, and maintaining campus buildings that reduce energy \nand water use, promoting sustainable practices, such as reducing, reusing, and \nrecycling;  encouraging  selection  of  training  equipment  with  low  energy \nconsumption; and strengthening environmental management systems. \n(iv)  Industry reference groups. The groups will work with the schools in areas such \nas curriculum development to help ensure that TVET is more demand-led. \n \n12.  Incorporation of lessons learned. Lessons from ADB and World Bank TVET projects9 \nwere incorporated in the project design, including (i) involving industries in identifying priority \noccupational  areas,  and  developing  CBC  and  materials;  (ii)  creating  pathways  to  further \neducation by establishing training programs that align with entry requirements for advanced \nprograms; (iii) building a learning culture to capture lessons for future policy and program \ndevelopment through training bases and tracer studies; and (iv) establishing a robust project \nmonitoring and evaluation.   \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The  impact  of  the  proposed  project  will  be  improved  delivery  of  social  services  in \nNanning Municipality. The outcome will be increased TVET quality and training capacity in the \nNHS and NVTS by 2020. \n \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2012.

Equipment specifications \nhave been drawn up that is compatible with the improvements in TVET quality.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n25.  Economic benefits. Conventional economic viability analysis using an economic internal \nrate of return calculation was applied in determining the viability of the NHS (health) component. \nThe monetized value of the benefits compared with the projected economic costs yielded an \neconomic internal rate of return value of 17.6%. Over a 20-year period, NHS graduates, 95% of \nwhom are assumed to find employment, are projected to generate total incremental income \nearnings of about CNY615 million. These students will be better trained and more competent in \ndelivering health services and contributing to improving health outcomes in rural and urban \nareas. Analysis for the NVTS (early childhood education) component utilized a simple cost\u2013\nbenefit analysis, which estimated the net present value of the annual stream of economic benefits \nderived from the proposed investments and yielded satisfactory results as documented in the \neconomic analysis.14 Increasing investment in early child development is one of the most cost-\neffective strategies for breaking intergenerational poverty and improving productivity and social \ncohesion in the long run.15 Other external benefits of both components of the project that will \naccrue are (i) improvements in TVET, which will filter to non-project TVET institutions; (ii) \nimproved  responsiveness  of TVET  to  changing  sector  needs;  and (iii) facilitation  of  public \nservices reform and improvement. The project will directly raise TVET quality for about 5,850 \nTVET students annually, which includes increased capacity of 1,850 students due to improved \nand expanded facilities. Over a 25-year period, a total of 31,028 students will graduate and join \nthe active work force.16 This is expected to improve the delivery of kindergarten and health \nservices in Nanning and GZAR. \n \n26.  Financial sustainability. A financial sustainability analysis was undertaken during project \npreparations based on fiscal impact. This analysis indicates the project cost as a proportion of \nthe NMG\u2019s annual expenditure will be insignificant, ranging from 0.03% in 2013 to 0.34% in \n2014 to 0.07% in 2017. The NMG\u2019s annual commitment to the project as a percentage of the \ntotal education budget is projected to increase from 0.19% in 2013 to 0.33% in 2017. The \nfinancial analysis confirms that the NMG has adequate financial resources and will be able to \nprovide  the  necessary  counterpart  funds  for  the  project  and  to  cover  annual  operations, \nmaintenance costs and debt service requirements.17  \n  \n                                                \n14 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 K.

Governance \n \n27.  Financial management and procurement capacity assessment. The project will be \nADB\u2019s second loan to the NMG, which is successfully managing other projects funded by \nbilateral  and  multilateral  financial  institutions.  The  financial  management  and  procurement \ncapacity  assessments  focused  on  the  XIDC  as  the  principal  implementing  agency,  and \nconcluded that the XIDC has adequate capacity for financial management and procurement in \naccordance with ADB policies and procedural requirements as well as national procurement \nlaws and regulations. The Nanning Finance Bureau has a proven track record in the financial \nmanagement of both ADB and World Bank projects. The PMO and TVET institutions will not \nhave major roles in project financial management and procurement. The project management \noutput includes providing training and advice to the PMO and implementing agencies in ADB \nprocedures,  including  procurement,  disbursement,  project  management,  accounting,  and \nfinancial  reporting  systems.  The  results  of  the  financial  management  assessment  are \nsummarized  in  the  financial  analysis.  Recommended  improvements  in  the  financial \nmanagement assessment have been incorporated into the project design and are documented \nin the PAM. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed  with  the  NMG  and  PMO.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are also described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n28.  Social  analysis  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines.18 Of  Nanning \nMunicipality\u2019s population, 73% is registered in rural areas. Ethnic minorities comprise 53% of the \npopulation, and among the various ethnic groups,19 the Zhuang constitute 51% of the total \npopulation. Poverty is primarily rural (19.5%). Students coming from poor areas comprise 28% \nin preschool, 36% in nursing, and 41% in rural doctor majors. Government policy allows for all \nstudents to be exempt from tuition fees, and there are extra subsidies for supporting students \nwho are poor or from remote areas and/or ethnic minorities. Actions under the social action plan \nin the PAM include (i) development of ethnic minority culture curriculum for the kindergarten \nprogram; (ii) targets to increase enrollment of poor and rural students; (iii) design of a bridging \nmodule in the elderly care program; (iv) community consultations on design and implementation \nof construction; (v) social indicators (e.g., ethnicity, hukou,20 sex, income group) in project \nmonitoring; and (vi) a social and gender expert on the consulting team. Requirements to use \ncore labor standards and provide HIV/AIDS awareness training in the construction contracts will \nmitigate social risks.  \n \n29.  Gender  and  development.  The  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming. Both schools have a majority of female staff and students in the selected \nmajors.21 The project will create employment opportunities for students who are mostly from \npoor and rural areas. Improving the quality of social services TVET will create pathways for \nwomen  to  enter  the  economy  and  participate  in  the  social  and  economic  development  of \nNanning.  Actions  in  the  gender  action  plan22 include  (i)  development  of  gender  sensitive \nmaterials for the CBC, (ii) targets for training female staff, (iii) development of a recruitment \nprogram in rural areas that addresses gender stereotypes in TVET major selection, and (iv) \ntargets for women\u2019s employment in construction activities. \n                                                \n18 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 Other ethnic groups include Yao, Miao, Dong, and Hui. \n20 Hukou is a residency document of a PRC citizen that determines the source and kind of welfare benefits.  \n21 Female composition: NVTS: 55% staff and 98.7% students; NHS: 55% staff, 76% nursing staff, and 98% students. \n22 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n30.  Environment.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment.  An  initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE), 23  including  the  environmental  management  plan,  was \nprepared and disclosed on the ADB website on 15 July 2013. The IEE complies with ADB's \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  IEE  concludes  that  the  project\u2019s  anticipated \nenvironmental  impacts  can  be  mitigated  through  implementation  of  the  environmental \nmanagement plan. During construction, some environmental impacts are anticipated, including \nnoise, fugitive dust, demolition wastes, and risks to community and occupational health and \nsafety. Overall, construction-related impacts are localized, short-term, and can be effectively \nmitigated through the application of good construction practices. During operation, no major \nenvironmental  impacts  are  anticipated,  and  minor  impacts  will  be  addressed  through  the \nimprovement  of  campus-wide  environmental  management  systems.  Environmental \nmanagement  is  supported  by  loan  covenants,  capacity  development,  and  institutional \nstrengthening activities under the project. Environmental complaints or disputes will be handled \nin accordance with the grievance redress mechanism established for the project. The project will \nhelp establish energy-efficient, safe, and green campuses. The consulting services under the \nproject  will  provide  expert  support  to  the  NHS  and  NVTS  in  developing  campus-wide \nenvironmental management systems based on the Draft Campus Greening Policy Framework \ndefined in the IEE. \n \n31.  Resettlement. The involuntary resettlement category is C. The project activities will \nneither  require  land  acquisition  nor  resettlement.  Resettlement  due  diligence  has  been \nundertaken for the new NHS campus, yielding satisfactory results with no outstanding issues. \n \n32.  Indigenous peoples. The indigenous peoples category is B. No project activities will \nadversely affect indigenous people. Ethnic minority students and staff are a majority at both \nTVET schools. Ethnic minority communities using rural health services and kindergartens will \nbenefit from improved services. In accordance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), \nthe project has included measures in the overall project design in lieu of preparing a separate \nindigenous peoples plan.24 An analysis of the issues,25 stemming from consultations with staff, \nstudents,  and  other  stakeholders  (e.g.,  the  Nanning  Ethnic  Minority  Affairs  Bureau),  was \nprepared and recommended actions integrated into the project design. Measures to ensure \nethnic minority inclusion include (i) design of ethnic minority culture curriculum for kindergarten \nmajor; (ii) assessment of issues in elderly care; (iii) improvement of rural student recruitment; \nand (iv) ethnicity indicators in tracer studies. \n \nF.
