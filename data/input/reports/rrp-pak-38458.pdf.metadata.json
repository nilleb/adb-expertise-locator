The  Technical  Assistance  Loan  (TA  Loan) \ndoes not by itself have any environmental impact, but an \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  will  be  an  integral \ncomponent of the subproject preparatory process, which \nis  financed  under  the  TA  Loan.  The  Government  of \nPakistan  will  provide  an  assurance  that  any  subproject \nwill  be  prepared \nthe  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Environment Policy 2002.  \n\nin  accordance  with \n\non \n\nprivate \n\nconstraints \n\nparticipation \n\nThe  TA  Loan  will  constitute  a  key  intervention  for \nstrengthening  and  further  consolidating  the  long-term \ndevelopment  partnership  between  ADB  and  Pakistan  in \nthe  area  of  infrastructure  development,  and  it  indicates \nADB\u2019s  continued  high  level  commitment  to  increase \ninfrastructure  services.  A  second  key \nintervention \nearmarked  in  the  2005  program  is  the  Public  Private \nInfrastructure Financing Facility (PPIF), which will reduce \npolicy \nin \ninfrastructure.  While  the  TA  Loan  will  tackle  some \nimmediate  policy  constraints,  the  PPIF  is  expected  to \nfocus  on  private  participation  in  infrastructure  over  a \nlonger  horizon.  The  TA  Loan  will  (i)  strengthen  the \nenvironment  for,  and  improve  the  sustainability  of, \ninfrastructure  investment;  (ii)  outline  an  infrastructure \ninvestment  program  for  the  short,  medium,  and  long- \nterm;  and \ninvestment  and \ninstitutional  capacity  interventions  for  the  infrastructure \nsectors.  Infrastructure  and  utility  sector  projects  will \npromote  economic  growth  and  reduce  poverty.  The \ninvestments  will  be  technically  feasible,  financially  and \neconomically  viable,  and  compliant  with  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental  and  social  operational  policies  and \nprocedures.  Assistance  will  be  provided  through  (i) \ninvestment \nstrategic \nenvironment  strengthening  measures, \n(iii)  capacity \nbuilding,  and  (iv)    preparation  of  feasibility  studies.  The \ninfrastructure  sectors  covered  under  the  Project  are \npower, transport, and water resources. \n\n(iii)  prepare  specific \n\nframework \n\ndefinition, \n\n(ii) \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nEnvironment Assessment \n\n \nProject Description \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nRationale \n\n \n\nThe Government\u2019s infrastructure strategy is embedded in \nits  Medium-Term  Development  Framework  2005-2010 \n(MTDF).  The  Government  is  pursuing  an  integrated \napproach  to  infrastructure  development  through  broad-\nbased development of a number of infrastructure sectors \nwhile increasing infrastructure services countrywide. The \nstrategy ensures investor-friendly policies. The allocation \nfor  infrastructure  development  has  been  placed  at  54% \nof \ntotal  planned  development \nexpenditures. \n\nthe  Government\u2019s \n\nThe  Government\u2019s  vision  for  economic  growth  and \npoverty  reduction  sets  ambitious  targets,  which  will \nrequire  massive  infrastructure  development.  However, \nthe Government has recently concluded that public funds \nwould  be  able  to  meet  only  about  $1.5  billion  of \nestimated total infrastructure investment requirements of \n$2.5 billion\u2013$3.0 billion annually. The remaining resource \ngap  would  have  to  be  funded  by  the  private  sector, \nmultilateral  financial  institutions,  and  bilateral  agencies. \nTimely development and implementation of infrastructure \nindispensable \ninvestment  projects  are \nto  economic \nInfrastructure \nprogress. \ninstitutions  need  sufficient \ncapacity \nto  carry  out  needs  analysis,  project \ndevelopment  and  preparation,  and  preconstruction \nactivities  on  time  and  efficiently  for  external  and/or \nprivate financing.  \n \nThe pivotal step from the strategy to the implementation \nof  infrastructure  projects  is  to  create  an  environment \nconducive  to  private  investment.  The  Government  is \nadopting investor-friendly policies, but operational, legal, \nand procedural constraints still have to be identified and \nremoved  to  achieve  the  MTDF\u2019s  private  investment \ntargets.  The  TA  Loan  has  devoted  a  component  to \nstrengthening \nfor  private \nthe  enabling  environment \ninvestment  in  infrastructure.  The  PPIF  is  expected  to \nhelp  develop  strategy  and  policy  to  attract  the  private \nsector to infrastructure financing and management. \n \nthe  simultaneous \nThe  Government \ndevelopment of several infrastructure services within the \nsame geographic area, such as transportation, electricity, \nand  water  resources,  resulting  in  sustainable  economic \ngrowth. The multi-sector TA Loan modality supports this \nintegrated  approach  through  its  tri-dimensional  focus, \nstrategic-based  policies  to  improve  the  environment  for \ninvestors,  and  increased  services  through  institutional \ncapacity  building  and  project  implementation.  It  also \nensures  strong  Government  ownership  of  subprojects \nsince the implementing agencies are directly responsible \nfor preparing the follow-on projects.  \n\nfocusing  on \n\nis \n\n\f \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \n\niii\n\nlong-term \n\nto  continue \n\nthe  Government  on \n\nADB\u2019s assistance will build on lessons learned and policy \nthe  overall \ndialogue  with \ninfrastructure  strategy  and  policy.  The  TA  Loan  is  an \nopportunity \ninfrastructure \nthe \npartnership  with  the  Government,  combining  financial \nsupport  with  the  joint  development  of  a  strategic  and \nimplementation \ninfrastructure \ndevelopment, and making the infrastructure sectors more \nconducive to private participation.  \n \nThe  overall  objective  of  the  TA  Loan  is  to  assist  the \nGovernment  define,  plan,  prepare,  and  implement  a \nprogram  for  infrastructure  development  consistent  with \nthe MTDF, and thus reduce poverty.  \n\nfor  overall \n\nframework \n\nfor \n\nThe scope of the TA Loan is to (i) assist the Government \ninfrastructure \ncreate  an  enabling  environment \ninvestments for domestic public and private participation \nas  well  as  bilateral  and  multilateral  agencies,  and  (ii) \nincrease infrastructure services in Pakistan, by improving \ninstitutional  capacities  to  plan,  develop,  and  implement \nimplementing  an \ninfrastructure  projects,  and  by \ninfrastructure \nthe  power, \ninvestment  program \ntransport, and water resource sectors.  \n\nin \n\nin  an \n\nrequires \n\neconomic \n\ndevelopment \n\nThe  TA  Loan  will  help  the  Government  develop  the \nintegrated  manner,  as \ninfrastructure  sectors \nsustainable \na \ncomprehensive  approach  to  transportation,  provision  of \nelectricity,  and  water  resources.  The  TA  Loan  will \ndevelop  and  improve  the  investment  environment  and \ndevelop  an  investment  program.  Focusing  on  improved \ninfrastructure  deliveries,  the  TA  Loan  will  (i)  enable \ninfrastructure institutions to develop and prepare projects \non  time  and  up  to  international  standards  and  best \npractices;  (ii)  ensure  that  subprojects  and  subsequent \ninfrastructure  projects  are  ready  for  implementation;  (iii) \nimprove  capacities  of  infrastructure  agencies  to  meet \nbusiness management and process changes as required \nby  recent  sector  policies,  reforms,  and  regulatory \nagencies;  and  (iv)  assist  in  developing  Public-Private \nPartnership (PPP) modalities in the targeted sectors. The \nTA Loan will enhance infrastructure agencies\u2019 capacity to \ndevelop  a  sector  program  and  project  pipeline  and  to \nimplement  projects.  The  TA  Loan  will  prepare  follow-on \nprojects intended for downstream ADB public and private \nfinancing modalities, as well as for non-ADB financing. \n\nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $33.67  million \nequivalent, comprising a foreign exchange component of \n$18.49  million  (55%  of  the  total  cost)  and  a  local \ncurrency component of $15.18 million equivalent (45%). \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project  \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\nADB will provide a loan of $25 million equivalent to cover \nthe  foreign  exchange  costs,  except  interest  during \nimplementation  ($18.15  million  equivalent)  and  part  of \nlocal  currency  costs  ($6.85  million  equivalent).

The \nTA  Loan  will  also  support  capacity  building  to  improve \nthe impact and sustainability of infrastructure investment.  \n\nThe  ultimate  beneficiaries  are  the  consumers,  who  will \nbenefit  from  increased  infrastructure  facilities,  which  will \nspur  economic  activity.  Investors  will  benefit  from  an \nimproved \nimmediate \ninvestment  environment.  The \nbeneficiaries  of  the  TA  Loan  will  be  the  EA  and  IAs  as \ntheir  project  preparation  capacity  will \nto \ninternational \nimproved \ngovernance and transparency in consultant selection and \nprocurement.  The  medium-term  beneficiaries  are  the \npoor  as  improved  rural  and  urban  infrastructure  will \nreduce  poverty.  The  Government  is  expecting  the  TA \nto  assist \nLoan, \nintegrate the various regions and provinces by improving \ninfrastructure services.  \n\nthrough  subproject \n\nstandards  and \n\nimplementation, \n\nimprove \n\nresult \n\nin \n\nThe  risk  of  delayed  project  implementation  delays  is \nrealistic  and  is  mitigated  by  ensuring  that  the  IMU  and \nIAs  have  the  needed  resources,  especially  during  the \nfirst  24  months  of  implementation.  A  sub-component  of \nthe  enabling  environment  for  infrastructure  investment \ncomponent  is  designed  to  assist  the  IMU  execute  the \nProject, and will allow long-term consultants to work with \nand  for  the  IMU,  assisting  IAs  in  the  daily  challenges  of \ngetting  the  required  information  collected  and  approved. \nAs soon as the TA Loan is operational, a small-scale TA \nwill support its implementation.  \n\nPakistan\u2019s  ability  to  develop  infrastructure  projects  in \ncompliance  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard  policies  and  procedures  needs  improvement. \nEach  subproject  will  ensure  that  safeguard  policies  will \nbe covered by each expert\u2019s detailed terms of reference. \n\nA lack of institutional capacities, a weak project pipeline, \nand failure to incorporate lessons learned are clear risks \nthat  would  hinder  the  TA  Loan\u2019s  implementation  and \nimpacts.  The  IMU  should  have  sufficiently  skilled  and \nexperienced personnel\u2014internally assigned Government \nstaff  members  and  externally  hired  consultants.  During \nthe  early  stages  of  the  TA  Loan,  IMU  personnel  will  be \nexpected  to  assess  the  institutional  capacities  within \neach IA, and provide assistance\u2014solutions and time\u2014to \nensure  that  subproject  implementation  has  no  gaps.

ADB  is  expected  to  add  value  by  introducing  international  best  practices,  building \ninstitutional capacities, supporting policy reforms, catalyzing private activities and investments, \nand  filling  financing  gaps  where  the  private  sector  is  unlikely  to  invest.  ADB  is  seen  by  the \nGovernment and the domestic financial sector as a strategic partner for private participation in \ninfrastructure development. ADB can use a mix of resources from its public and private sector \noperations,  as  well  as  knowledge-based  technical  assistance  for  areas  such  as  public-private \npartnerships (PPPs).  \n \nThis rapid envisioned infrastructure development in Pakistan is a challenge but also an \n3. \nopportunity  to  (i)  enhance  ADB\u2019s  product  attractiveness,  complemented  by  value-added \nknowledge;  (ii)  solidify  a  long-term  infrastructure  partnership  with  Pakistan;  and  (iii)  ensure \nADB\u2019s  medium-  and  long-term  relevance,  especially  in  middle-income  countries  like  Pakistan, \nwhere borrowing is based not only on cost but also on other considerations.  \n \nA consultation mission2 (27 September\u20131 October 2004) and a fact-finding mission3 (25 \n4. \nNovember\u20132 December 2004) visited Pakistan. The TA Loan was developed based on the aide \nmemoire  provided  to  the  Government  on  8  December  2004,  which  covered  an  understanding \nbetween  the  Government  and  ADB  on  the  project  parameters  and  details.  The  TA  Loan  is \nincluded in the 2005\u20132006 country strategy and program update (CSPU) for Pakistan, and the \nProject\u2019s design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB. \n \n5. \nSince the 2004 Pakistan Development Forum, the Government has been developing its \nMedium-Term  Development  Framework  2005--2010  (MTDF),  which  is  the  strategic  basis  for \ninfrastructure  development  for  the  next  5  years.  ADB  commenced  dialogue  with  the \nGovernment following the release of the draft MTDF in March 2005. The MTDF is based on (i) \nthe  2004  PDF,  which  focused  on  sustainable  infrastructure  development;  and  (ii)  a  number  of \nsector presentations made by the ministries and agencies involved in infrastructure activities to \n\nGovernment Infrastructure Strategy \n\n                                                 \n1   Held in Islamabad 17\u201319 March 2004.  \n2   The  consultation  mission  and  the  Government  set  the  perimeters  for  the  fact-finding  stage,  which  was  to  be \n\nundertaken in three phases, as separate fact-finding missions would be conducted for each subsector. \n\n3   The fact-finding mission was completed in three phases, with (i) the transport sector mission visiting Pakistan from \n21 to 28 October 2004, (ii) the  water resource sector mission from 26 October to 5 November 2004, and (iii) the \npower sector mission from 25 November to 2 December 2004.  \n\n\f2 \n\nthe Planning Commission during the second and third quarters of 2004. The poverty reduction \nstrategy  paper  (PRSP)4  emphasizes  economic  growth  by  increasing  delivery  of  infrastructure \nfacilities  and  services,  as  these  would  not  only  promote  economic  growth  but  also  further \nintegrate  the  provinces  and  regions.  Historical  external  financial  assistance  to  infrastructure \nsectors is shown in Appendix 2. \n \n6. \nThe  Government\u2019s  Planning  Commission\u2019s  infrastructure  framework  uses  an  elaborate \nand  integrated  approach.  Optimal  economic  growth  will  not  result  from  developing  only  one \ninfrastructure  sector.  Rather,  several  infrastructure  facilities\u2014in  this  project  defined  as \npower/electricity supply, transportation, and water resources\u2014must be provided. Otherwise, the \nannual economic targets cannot be obtained or poverty reduced. The PRSP clearly establishes \nthe  linkage  between  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  It  includes  creating  economic \nopportunities for the poor, which can only materialize by increasing infrastructure facilities. Basic \ninfrastructure  must  be  increased  to  reduce  rural  and  urban  poverty.  An  important  challenge  is \nlinking  poor  regions  to  rapidly  growing  domestic  and  international  markets  through  adequate \ninfrastructure.  Priority  infrastructure includes  (i) power  generation  to  increase  electricity  supply \nsufficient to cover the industrial, commercial, and rural production facilities and markets; (ii) an \nintegrated  transportation  network  to  connect  poor  regions  and  production  centers  to  domestic \nand  international  markets;  and  (iii)  water  resources  and  a  sound  framework  and  capacity  for \ntheir  development  and  management  to  ensure their  sustainability  for  domestic,  municipal,  and \nindustrial supply and irrigation. \n \n7. \nIn  the  infrastructure  sectors,  the  Government  continues  to  be  burdened  by  inefficient \nstate-owned  entities  (SOIEs),  which  require  federal  and  provincial  technical  and  nontechnical \nsupport.  Non-technical matters are directly linked to the Government\u2019s efforts to institute sector \nreforms and institutional restructuring and hence improve the infrastructure environment through \nincreased transparency at all levels. Of particular interest are the efforts related to price-setting \nmechanisms  and  governance  of  infrastructure  subsectors.  The  Government  is  solving \nsubstantial  legal  and  regulatory  issues,  and  recently  several  independent  regulatory  bodies \nhave been established, such as the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) and \nthe  Oil  and  Gas  Regulatory  Authority  (OGRA).  These  regulators  have  established  transparent \nprocesses  for  licensing  and  tariff  setting,  and  the  real  cost  of  infrastructure  services  has \nsurfaced during discussions at the public hearings on tariff applications. \n \n8. \nThe Government\u2019s overall infrastructure strategic framework is focused on facing these \nchallenges, and it has commenced restructuring SOEs to improve their efficiencies and increase \nthe transparency of decision making and results. Managerial accountability and financial viability \nand sustainability have become part of the results-oriented focus of the Government, and while \nseveral SOEs and implementing agencies (IAs) are well into reform and restructuring, a number \nof  SOEs  need  to  accelerate  their  efforts.  The  Government  has  embarked  on  an  ambitious \nprivatization program. Success was attained in the finance sector, while privatizing infrastructure \nentities has proven more complicated than expected. Despite difficulties, several infrastructure \nentities  have  been  privatized  while  others  are  near  financial  closing.  Private  participation  is \ncrucial to increase investment and operating efficiencies and effectiveness. Another element of \nthe  strategic  framework  is  creating  competition  by  introducing  private  entities  into  the \ninfrastructure sectors, promoting investment, and improving service quality.  \n \n\n                                                 \n4   Government of Pakistan. 2003.

Thus, through the PDD \n9. \nand line ministries, it is prioritizing investment in institutional capacity building in agencies and in \nphysical  infrastructure  projects  in  each  sector.  The  Government  cannot  fund  more  than  about \n$1.5 billion of the required $2.5 billion\u2013$3.0 billion annually. Private domestic and international \ninvestors and multilateral and bilateral agencies will be encouraged to fund a substantial portion.  \n \n10. \nThe  Government  should  build  up  investor  confidence,  focusing  on  investor  protection, \nsector and investor legal and regulatory fairness and consistency, property rights, transparency \nof  sector  policy  frameworks,  strategic  direction,  sector  development,  monetary  stability  and \nexchange regulations, and efficient contract enforcement. Several attempts have been made to \nassess  the  environment  for  private  sector  investments.  These  efforts  have  defined  the  above \nissues,  which  need  to  be  resolved  item  by  item.  Through  market  liberalization  and  various \nstrategic  interventions  presented  in  the  MTDF,  the  Government  is  encouraging  the  entry  of \nprivate developers and financiers and other capital resources to increase infrastructure services.  \n \nC. \n \n \n \n11. \nThe  objective  of  the  Government\u2019s  power  sector  policy  is  to  deliver  more  reliable  and \naffordable  electricity  to  industrial,  commercial,  and  household  customers  nationwide.  Key \nelements to meet this objective are to encourage an increased utilization of hydro power, coal, \nand  natural  gas  to  generate  power;  reducing  technical  and  non-technical  losses  of  the  power \nsector utilities through further implementation of power sector reforms and restructuring, which \nincludes  privatization;  and  supporting  independent  regulation  of  the  power  sector  through \nNEPRA.  \n \n12. \nAttempts to meet its objective. The key issues as translated into operating performance \nof  the  power  sector  resulted  in  the  Government  facing  severe  cash  losses,  which  have  been \ncovered  through  budgetary  support  in  the  form  of  grants  and  subsidies.  In  FY2003,  the  total \nfinancial  losses  of  WAPDA  and  KESC  reached  1%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP),  while \nbudgetary  support  was  1.8%.  Although  power  utilities  have  improved  operationally  and \nfinancially  since  1999,  they  still  face  operational  inefficiencies:  (i)  high  furnace  oil  costs,  (ii) \nunreasonable  levels  of  transmission  and  distribution  losses,  (iii)  high  purchase  costs  of \nelectricity from the independent power producers, and (iv) subsidizing of the agricultural sector \nand of domestic consumers. WAPDA and KESC are thus being restructured. The Government \nhas  approved  KESC\u2019s  privatization,  and  bidding  is  expected  concluded  in  the  first  quarter  of \n2005.  ADB  has  been  an  integral  partner  in  privatizing  KESC  through  a  TA  facility.5  WAPDA\u2019s \nyears-long  restructuring  has  been  slow.  WAPDA\u2019s  power  sector  operations  have  been \nunbundled  into  one  transmission  and  dispatch,  three  generation,  and  eight  distribution \ncompanies. Although the restructuring has been completed legally, unbundling continues to be \nslower than anticipated and should speed up a stronger focus is required to ensure rapid sector \nimprovements.  Of  the  new  companies,  one  generation  and  two  distribution  companies  have \nbeen identified and selected for privatization. Privatization advisers have been contracted and a \nbidding round is expected. A few issues are still outstanding, but the Privatization Commission \nexpects that these transactions will be completed in 2005.  \n  \n13. \nUnder the Government\u2019s power sector strategy, actions are being pursued in all areas of \nthe  sector.  It  is  planning  more  generation  facilities,  and  augmentation  and  expansion  of  the \n\n                                                 \n5 ADB. 2000.

It is pursuing renewable energy to broaden fuel sources, and using privatization and \nPPP  to  increase  investment  funding.  Today,  about  40%  of  the  Pakistan\u2019s  population  requires \naccess  to  electricity,  and  large  investments  are  needed  to  supply  it.  The  industrial  and \ncommercial  annual  consumption  would  increase  by  about  2,000  megawatts  (MW)  annually  in \norder  to  support  the  economic  growth  target  of  about  8%.  The  transmission  and  distribution \nnetworks are in critical need of investment. Mobilizing investment capital from the three primary \nsources\u2014public \nfunding\u2014is  a \nfunds,  multilateral  and  bilateral  resources,  and  private \nGovernment  priority.  However,  the  challenge  of  obtaining  funding  must  be  supported  by \nadequate  institutional  capacity  as  well  as  advanced  project  preparatory  activities  that  meet \ninternational  environmental  safeguard  structure,  financial,  economic,  and  technical  standards. \nThe  power  sector  must  function  in  a  transparent  and  sustainable  manner  to  attract  investors. \nSector details are in Appendix 3. \n  \n \n \nTransport is an important sector of Pakistan\u2019s economy accounting for 10% of GDP and \n14. \nabout  20\u201325%  of  the  annual  Public  Sector  Development  Program.  Though  operational,  the \ntransport  sector  suffers  from  (i)  a  very  high  modal  share  of  roads  compared  to  railways,  (ii) \ndeteriorating infrastructure due to inadequate investment and lack of maintenance, (iii) transfer \nof large road assets from provincial to district governments, (iv) a loss-making railway system, \nand (v) expensive and inefficient ports.  \n \n15. \nRoads  are  the  predominant  mode  of  inland  transport,  carrying  more  than  91%  of \npassenger  traffic  and  96%  of  freight  traffic.  The  average  growth  rate  is  about  4.5%  for \npassenger and 10.5% for freight traffic. The total road network is about 250,000 kilometers (km), \nof  which  about  60%  is  paved.  This  includes  8,600  km  of  national  highways  and  motorways, \nrepresenting the main transport corridors and providing interprovincial linkages and connections \nto neighboring countries; and about 95,000 km of provincial roads providing all-weather access \nto the economic and population centers in the four provinces. The remaining network consists of \nmunicipal  urban  roads  that  are  mostly  paved,  and  largely  unpaved  tertiary  roads  providing \naccess to villages and remote areas. The number of registered motor vehicles is 4.8 million and \ngrowing  at  8%  annually.  Road  transport  services  are  largely  private  and  subject  to  strong \ncompetition.  The  national,  provincial,  and  district  road  networks  require  rehabilitation, \nreconstruction, and upgrading. About half the national highway network and a large proportion \nof the provincial road networks are in poor condition, mainly due to inadequate investment and \nlack  of  maintenance.  The  Government  has  initiated  a  program  to  rehabilitate  priority  highway \nsections with assistance from the World Bank and ADB, in addition to Government resources. \nADB  is  financing  sequenced  interventions  in  each  province  to  rehabilitate  and  improve \nprovincial  highways  and  district  roads.  ADB\u2019s  support  is  evolving  from  a  project-by-project \napproach  into  a  programmatic  approach,  where  assistance  to  all  categories  of  roads  goes  in \nparallel with policy dialogue and the preparation of a plan for sector reform. Loans, which mainly \nfocused  on  provincial  roads,  now  cover  all  categories  of  roads,  including  motorways  (through \nPPPs),  national  highways,  provincial  roads,  and  district  roads  (where  ADB  plays  a  key  role  in  \nthe devolution process). \n \n16. \nOnce  the  leading  transport  mode,  railways  have  been  in  decline  for  many  years.  As  a \nresult, (i) railways now carry less than 5% of freight traffic, (ii) infrastructure, traction, and rolling \nstock  have  deteriorated  due  to  lack  of  sufficient  investment  and  maintenance,  (iii)  Pakistan \nRailways  (PR)  operates  at  a  loss,  and  (iv)  PR  is  a  drain  on  the  Government  budget  of  about \nRs20  billion  (about  $340  million)  per  annum.  Although  PR  has  reduced  staff,  it  still  employs \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\n3. \n\nWater Resources Sector \n\n95,000 people, which is high for traffic levels. The general explanation for this decline is that PR \nhas not been able to adapt to the increasing demand for door-to-door services, competition from \nimproved  road  transport,  and  modern  logistics.  Railways  in  other  countries  have  had  similar \nexperiences. The Government believes that railways could provide the most economical mode \nof  transport  for  a  larger  share  of  traffic.  Average  haul  distances  are  large,  and  rail  is  more \ncompetitive than road as haul distances increase. The Government now wishes to reverse the \ndecline  of  railways  and  realize  their  economic  potential.  It  recognizes  that  this  will  require \nsustained  institutional  and  policy  reforms  together  with  investment  in  rehabilitation  and \nupgrading  of  facilities.  ADB  is  conducting  a  preliminary  assessment  of  the  railway  sector  to \ndevelop a plan to improve it.  \n \n17. \nPakistan  has  two  operational  ports:  Karachi  Port,  run  by  the  Karachi  Port  Trust,  and \nQasim Port, run by the Port Qasim Authority. Both are located in Sindh Province and less than \n70 km apart. The Government is developing a new port at Gwadar in Balochistan Province. The \nport  is  expected  to  be  operational  by  August  2005.  The  Government  in  1990  embarked  on  a \npolicy  of  implementing  the  landlord  concept  for  ports.  The  container  terminal  operations  at \nKarachi  and  Qasim  ports  have  been  privatized.  Customs  operations  have  improved  with \ninitiatives  such  as  computerization  of  operations  and  introduction  of  automated  clearance \nprocedures.  Pakistan  ports  are  still  expensive  and  inefficient  by  international  standards.6  ADB \nhas recently initiated policy and technical discussions with the Government on ADB support for \nthe port sector. Sector details are in Appendix 4. \n \n \n \n18.  Water  resources  management  and  development  are  vital  to  economic  growth  and \npoverty reduction in Pakistan and are inextricably linked to irrigation uses 95% of all developed \nwater  supply  to  support  agriculture  on  46  million  acres  of  land  or  about  82%  of  the  irrigable \narea.7  Development  of  irrigated  agriculture  in  the  Indus  Basin  has  been  a  key  source  of \nagricultural and economic growth, and irrigated land is responsible for about 80% of agricultural \nproduction. Agriculture contributes 25% to GDP, employs over 50% of the rural labor force, and \ndirectly  or  indirectly  provides  60\u201370%  of  exports.  The  Indus  River  has  been  significantly \nengineered  for  irrigation  and,  indirectly,  for  the  distribution  and  drainage  of  water  resources \nthroughout the country. The Indus canal system is the largest contiguous irrigation system in the \nworld. It not only supplies agricultural water but is also an important source of rural, municipal, \nand  industrial  water  supply.8  Water  resources  management  projects  (e.g.,  storage)  have \nirrigation  as  a  primary  component,  and  institutionally,  water  resources  management  and \nirrigation  and  drainage  (and  flood  control)  are  usually  addressed  through  the  same  agencies. \nDevelopment  of  water  resources  infrastructure  has  included  5,042  megawatts  of  installed \nhydropower capacity and 15.7 million acres feet (Mission Acres Feet\u201419.4 billion cubic meters) \nof storage. \n \n19. \nHowever, water resources and irrigated agriculture are facing tremendous challenges. A \nburgeoning  population,  and  a  sharp  rise  in  urban  demand,  will  outstrip  available  supply  in  the \nnext three decades. New irrigation canals are still a priority of some Government agencies. Over \ntwo thirds of surface water resources have already been developed. Groundwater development \n                                                 \n6   Shippers  annually  pay  about  $310  million  extra  charges,  which  are  passed  on  to  the  consumers  (World  Bank. \n\n2002. Pakistan: Transport Sector Assistance Strategy Note. Washington, DC: World Bank). \n\n7   For  the  water  resource  sector  component,  the  TA  Loan  will  address  management  over  the  resource  base  (i.e., \nwater resources management), irrigation and bulk water development and management, and flood management.  \n8   Pakistan\u2019s  drainage  network  expels  up  to  8,000  cusecs  of  saline  agricultural  drainage  water  as  well  as  most \n\nmunicipal and industrial wastewater. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nhas  little  room  for  expansion  and,  in  many  areas,  groundwater  is  in  over-draft  situation,  while \nsoil  and  water  salinity  and  waterlogging  harm  agricultural  production.  Surface  water  and \ngroundwater  are  becoming  increasingly  degraded  and  unfit  for  further  exploitation.  Surface \nwater is vulnerable due to the high variability of Indus River flows and drought, and only about \n12%  of  it  can  be  stored.  Storage  capacity  is  being  eroded  by  sediment  deposition,  which \nreduces water supply and energy production. \n \n20. \nPakistan is at the crossroads in management and development of its water resources: it \nwill face a severe water crisis if it does not solve its problems and lay the foundation to meet its \nneeds. The recent water sector strategy (WSS), which was developed with ADB TA support9 to \nthe  Ministry  of  Water  and  Power  (MOWP),  helped  catalyze  the  realization  within  the \nGovernment  that  institutional  arrangements  and  capacity  for  strategic  planning  and  policy \nanalysis need to be strengthened. The WSS provides a plan for policy and institutional reforms \nand  capacity  development,  in  addition  to  a  medium-term  investment  plan.10  Pakistan  is  also \nadopting  a  draft  national  water  policy,  which  complements  the  WSS\u2019s  recommendations.  The \nimplementation  of  the  WSS  and  NWP  will  require  significant  institutional  and  capacity \ndevelopment.11 \n \n21. \nSince  the  1980s,  infrastructure  investment  in  the  water  resource  sector  has  declined \nfrom the high levels when the Indus Basin was developed, but major increases are anticipated. \nInvestment  is  especially  needed  (i)  in  storage  for  bulk  water  supply,  and  (ii)  in  irrigation \ninfrastructure  because  systems  are  dilapidated  and  agriculture  is  important  to  the  national \neconomy. The medium-term investment plan estimates that as much as $3.4 billion is required \nfor  new  and  ongoing  projects  in  irrigation,  drainage,  and  flood  control,  and  $4.3  billion  for \nadditional  storage  in  ongoing  and  planned  priority  projects  over  a  10-year  planning  horizon. \nHowever, without strong planning and analytical capability to guide this expansion, a significant \nrisk  is  that  investment  outcomes  could  fall  short  of  their  potential.  Most  end  uses  such  as \nirrigation and domestic and municipal water supply are the responsibility of provincial agencies, \nwhich,  therefore,  need  additional  capacity  for  water  resources  planning  and  management  and \npolicy reform. Sector details are in Appendix 5. \n \nD. \n \n22. \nAs  of  December  2004,  Pakistan  had  received  about  $14.3  billion  from  the  major \nproviders of infrastructure loans. ADB provided $5.4 billion or about 38% of the total, and $12.3 \nmillion  in  non-lending  infrastructure  financing.  The  power  sector  obtained  $7.6  billion  (53%), \ntransport  $3.5  billion  (24%),  and  water  resources  sector  $3.3  billion  (23%).  The  ADB  non-\nlending  contribution  by  sector  was  $8.3  million  (67%),  $1.7  million  (14%),  and  $2.3  million \n(19%),  respectively.  The  principal  bilateral  source  has  been  the  Government  of  Japan.  The \nWorld Bank has the largest lending program to the power sector, with ADB the second largest, \nwhile ADB and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) are the largest financiers of \nthe  transport  sector.  In  the  water  resource  sector  the  World  Bank  and  ADB  lending  programs \nare about equal. External assistance suffered as a result of the nuclear testing activities in the \nlate  1990s,  but  recently  bilateral  programs  have  reengaged  in  the  infrastructure  sectors.  A \nsummary table of external assistance to the infrastructure sectors is in Appendix 2, while details \nare in Supplementary Appendix A. \n                                                 \n9  Under ADB. 1998.

It  is  a  revolving  target-oriented \nplan that focuses on immediate, medium, and  long-term actions. It covers (i) contract awards, \n(ii) disbursement and imprest account turnover ratios, (iii) reducing \u201cat risk\u201d projects, (iv) closing \nproject accounts when due, (v) retaining project monitoring unit staff, (vi) establishing revolving \nfunds,  and  (vii)  operationalizing  core  project  management  units.  The  annual  country  portfolio \nreview  exercise,  conducted  by  ADB,  investigates  the  performance  of  executing  agencies  in \nrelation to these key areas, and compares the findings with other South Asian countries, other \nregions  and  the  ADB-wide  benchmarks.  The  institutional  capacity  subprojects  of  the  TA  Loan \nwill address the above areas and include measurable targets.  \n \n24. \nADB  has  prepared  a  number  of  project  completion  reports  (PCRs)  for  infrastructure \nprojects  in  Pakistan.  The  PCRs  of  the  three  sectors  offer  a  number  of  common  lessons:  (i) \nproject  delays  were  caused  by  (a)  lack  of  counterpart  funds,  (b)  incomplete  Government \nrequired  formalities,  or  (c)  change  of  key  personnel;  (ii)  institutions  lacked  the  capacity  to \nimplement  the  project;  and  (iii)  improved  assessment  and  implementation  schedule  of \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguard  related  issues  during  project  development.  The  TA  Loan \nwill address this by improving and increasing the content and standards of project preparation \nby ensuring incorporation of all the above elements in the project preparatory phase. This will be \ndone through institutional capacity building of the implementing agencies of the subprojects and \nthe follow-on projects, and through detailed structure project preparatory procedures as well as \nTerms of References to be followed by the subprojects under the TA Loan.  \n \nF. \n \nThat  ADB  is  a  key  strategic  partner  of  Pakistan  in  the  infrastructure  sectors  was  most \n25. \nrecently reiterated in the 2005\u20132006 CSPU.12 The country strategy recognizes that substantial \ninfrastructure development is required if the Government is to reduce poverty, and it is part of \nADB\u2019s  areas  of  intervention:  (i)  supporting  good  governance;  (ii)  pro-poor  economic  growth \n(infrastructure,  rural  development,  job  creation);  and  (iii)  extensive  social  development \n(education,  health,  water  supply  and  sanitation,  and  social  protection)13.  Infrastructure \ndevelopment,  either  rehabilitation  or  development  of  facilities,  forms  an  integrated  part  of  the \npro-poor economic growth. Individual infrastructure sector plans translate into sustainable pro-\npoor  growth  and  seek  to  reduce  poverty  by  financing  infrastructure  projects  that  would  most \nreduce poverty. The approach allows ADB to draw upon its strong experience and institutional \nknowledge within these infrastructure sectors. Different funding modalities will be utilized, such \nas  the  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  and  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR)  lending \noperations, guarantee facilities, TA, and private operations. \n  \n26. \nThe actual infrastructure financing for 2001\u20132004 shows that ADB provided $837 million \ncompared  with  the  2005\u20132008  preliminary  programmed  infrastructure  lending  level  of  $2.7 \nbillion. ADB\u2019s private sector operations are expected to financially support infrastructure facilities \nthrough possible loan and equity instruments. The ADB program to Pakistan includes innovative \nmodalities  for  infrastructure  development  and  financing  such  as  the  proposed  Public-Private \n\nAsian Development Bank Infrastructure Strategy \n\n                                                 \n12   ADB. 2004.

ADB derived its infrastructure strategy and strategic approach from it and aims to \nsupport pro-poor development and economic growth through infrastructure investment. The TA \nLoan  intends  to  address  how  it should  be  done  and  also  identify  who  would  be  best  suited  to \nimplement  the  activities.  Appendix  6  presents  a  schematic  overview  of  the  infrastructure \ndevelopment framework, which emerged from ADB\u2019s review of the MTDF. \n \nIn  2005\u20132010,  the  Government  is  committing  as  much  as  54%  of  development \n28. \nexpenditure  to  infrastructure.  It  has  recognized  that  it  cannot  fund  more  than  a  third  of  the \nidentified infrastructure investments and needs substantial support from development partners. \nIn  line  with  the  MTDF,  ADB  will  assist  the  Government  obtain  funding  from  the  private  sector \nand multilateral and bilateral institutions by developing an enabling environment for investments. \nThese activities would operationalize the implementation of the MTDF. \n \n29. \nAt  the  sector  level,  the  MTDF  will  be  implemented  through  sustainable  structural  and \noperational institutional capacity building of the IAs, and intensified project preparatory work for \nnew infrastructure projects. In the process, the Government intends to increase its ownership of \ndeveloping infrastructure projects by increasing institutional capacities of Government ministries \nand agencies, where relevant, and by borrowing to develop and promote infrastructure projects, \nmaking  IAs  more  responsible  and  accountable.  Increased  Government  ownership  would \nencourage  ADB  to  think  of  innovative  ways  to  develop  infrastructure  and  obtain  adequate \nfinancing for projects. ADB\u2019s TA resources need to be supplemented to fund the Government\u2019s \nareas of focus as well as ADB\u2019s increasing program. \n  \n30. \nADB  is  adopting  a  multi-product  approach  to  develop  infrastructure,  introducing  mixed \nloans from its ADF and OCR resources, utilizing guarantee instruments, and promoting private \nsector  participation.  Therefore,  infrastructure  institutions  need  to  have  the  capacities  to \nefficiently and effectively carry out project development and preconstruction. Successful project \nimplementation requires timely high-quality preparatory work to comply with ADB requirements \nfor  project  processing  and  to  avoid  delays.  The  TA  Loan,  as  a  readily  accessible  financing \nfacility,  will  allow  infrastructure  institutions  to  efficiently  conduct  project  preparatory  and \npreconstruction activities as well as support capacity development. The Government\u2019s ability to \nmanage  the  increased  infrastructure  focus  will  be  supplemented  by  an  infrastructure \nmanagement unit, which will strengthen the ability to assist implementing agencies with timely \nproject identification, approval, and implementation. \n \n31. \nADB\u2019s assistance will build on lessons learned and policy dialogue with the Government \non the overall infrastructure policy, and input received through donor coordination. The TA Loan \nis  an  opportunity  to  continue  the  long-term  infrastructure  partnership  with  the  Government, \ncombining  financial  support  with  the  joint  development  of  a  strategic  and  implementation \nframework for overall infrastructure development. \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  overall  objective  of  the  TA  Loan  is  to  help  the  Government  define,  plan,  prepare, \n32. \nand  implement  a  program  to  develop  infrastructure  consistent  with  the  MTDF  in  order  to \nincrease the supply of infrastructure services, and thus reduce poverty.  \n \nThe  TA  Loan  will  assist  the  Government  enhance  the  infrastructure  investment \n33. \nenvironment for the private sector and bilateral and multilateral agencies by identifying investor \nbottlenecks, developing a strategy to remove them, defining activities to overcome these major \nobstacles,  and  executing  subprojects  to  remove  constraints  on  investors.  The  TA  Loan  will  (i) \nassist the Government develop its infrastructure sectors in an integrated manner, expanding the \neconomic  foundation  by  providing  electricity,  transportation,  and  water  resources,  (ii)  prepare \ninfrastructure  projects  that  promote  economic  growth  and  reduce  poverty,  and  are  technically \nfeasible,  financially  and  economically  viable,  and  in  accordance  with  environmental  and  social \npolicies  and  procedures,  (iii)  improve  institutional  capacities  within  infrastructure  agencies  and \ninstitutions,  and  (iv)  assist    develop  PPP  modalities.  Following  sector  reforms,  institutional \ncapacity building will enhance agency and ministry functions. These efforts will focus on policy \ndevelopment  and  formulation,  strategic  planning,  efficient  project  preparation,  and  operational \nand financial sustainability.  \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nThe  TA  Loan  will  consist  of  four  components.  One  will  focus  on  strengthening  the \n34. \ninfrastructure investment environment. The others will each cover a major infrastructure sector: \npower,  transport,  and  water  resources.  Under  each  sector  component  the  TA  Loan  will  help \nprepare,  as  appropriate,  (i)  project  feasibility  studies,  (ii)  project  detailed  designs,  (iii)  project \nbidding  documents  and  evaluation,  (iv)  capacity  building  and  development  of  PPP  models  for \nthe  financing,  construction,  and  operation  and  maintenance  of  infrastructure  facilities,  and  (iv) \ninstitutional  capacity  building  and  policy  development.  The  TA  Loan  will  help  enhance  the \ncapacity  of  the  IMU.  The  TA  Loan  will  accommodate  projects  intended  for  downstream  ADB \npublic and private sector financing, as well as for non-ADB-financed projects. The subprojects \ncan  be  divided  into  three  categories\u2014institutional  capacity  building,  project  preparation,  and \npolicy and institutional development. \n \n \n \n35. \nThis  component  will  (i)  assist  the  Government  identify  the  constraints  on  infrastructure \ninvestment,  (ii)  develop  subprojects  and  define  activities  to  remove  identified  conditions  that \nnegatively  affect  the  investment  climate  and  the  sustainability  of  investment  options  in \ninfrastructure sectors, and (iii) execute the subprojects addressing the constraints. The financial \nallocation to this component from the TA Loan is $1.25 million. The diagnostic work related to \ndefining constraints and identifying solutions will be supported by a small-scale TA of $150,000. \nThe Government and ADB have identified a need to improve and supplement the skills of the \nIMU.  This  subcomponent  will  provide  assistance  to  the  IMU  for  (i)  implementing  the \ninfrastructure strategy, (ii) planning and coordinating the infrastructure sectors, (iii) implementing \nproject preparatory activities, and (iv) monitoring activities. \n\nEnabling Environment for Infrastructure Investments \n\n1. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\nPower Sector \n\nTransport Sector \n\n \n \n36. \nSubprojects were identified by the Government through its presentations and interaction \nwith  line  agencies  and  SOEs.  ADB  supports  the  development  of  the  subprojects  as  they  will \nfocus on areas requiring attention and improvement. The financial allocation to the component \nunder  the  TA  Loan  is  $6.75  million,  to  be  distributed  among  the  subprojects,  which  will  cover \neither project preparation or institutional capacity building. \n \nThe power sector subprojects are expected to (i) address shortcomings in and improve \n37. \npower generation, (ii) augment and expand transmission and distribution systems, (iii) build the \ncapacity of the National Transmission and Despatch Company, and (iv) build the capacity of the \neight new distribution companies. A complete list of the power sector subprojects is in Appendix \n3, while the detailed subproject descriptions and outline TORs are in Supplementary Appendix \nB.  The  details  on  all  the  proposed  subprojects  for  the  three  sectors  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix B. \n \n \n \n38. \nThe  primary  tasks  of  the  TA  Loan  are  to  provide  resources  to  assist  the  Government \nprepare  transport  sector  projects,  and  to  build  sustainable  institutional  capacities  of  transport \nsector ministries and agencies. The Government identified, and ADB agreed to, subprojects to \nimprove certain areas of the transport sector. The allocated $11 million will be distributed among \nthe subprojects.  \n \nThe  subprojects  cover  (i)  road  project  preparatory  facilities,  (ii)  railway  project \n39. \npreparatory  facilities14,  (iii)  a  model  concession  and  project  preparatory  facility  for  a  PPP  pilot \nproject  in  national  highways  and  motorways,  (iv)  capacity  building  for  the  National  Highway \nAuthority (NHA), (v) policy development and capacity building for the Ministry of Railway (MOR) \nand PR, and (vi) policy development and capacity building for Ministry of Ports and Shipping. A \nlist of the transport sector subprojects are in Appendix 4. \n \nWater Resources Sector \n \n \n40. \nThe  primary  task  of  the  TA  Loan  is  to  build  capacity  for  water  resources  planning, \ndevelopment,  and  management  within  the  concerned  federal  and  provincial  agencies,  so  that \nover the medium term, they can most effectively start preparing and implementing major dams \nand  other  large  water  infrastructure.  The  TA  Loan  for  the  water  sector  will  support \nimplementation  of  a  TAP  that  is  being  prepared  under  ADB  TA  at  the  request  of  the \nGovernment.15 The TAP builds from the ADB-supported WSS and draft NWP, and reflects the \noutcome  of  significant  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government.  The  TAP  will  strengthen  the \ninstitutional  framework  and  build  new  capacity  for  strategic  planning  and  policy  analysis  to \nbolster  overall  management  of  water  resources.  The  TAP  will  build  professional  capacity  and \nskills  at  the  federal  and  provincial  levels,  but  focus  on  the  new  apex  body  or  policy  cell,  by \nassisting \nfollowing  activities:  recruiting  staff;  designing  and \nimplementing  a  capacity  development  program;  providing  short-  and  long-term  national  and \ninternational  consultants;  providing  funds  to  contract  needed  studies  and  related  activities  to \ncenters of expertise in Pakistan; and providing funds to establish and equip the unit and make it \n\nthe  Government  with \n\nthe \n\n4. \n\n                                                 \n14  Subject to agreement between the Government and ADB on the development of a reform program and a plan. \n15  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Water Sector Irrigation Development. \n\nManila (TA 4435-PAK approved for $300,000 in November 2004). \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\nfully  functional.  The  TAP  will  cover  (i)  developing  water  resource  analytical  and  planning \ncapacity  of  sector  institutions,  (ii)  improving  the  technology  for  and  management  of  decision \nsupport systems, and (iii) strengthening and reforming the institutional and legal arrangements. \nOf the $6 million allocated to the water resources component, $4 million will support the TAP. \n \n41.  \nThe  remaining  $2  million  will  be  used  by  provincial  agencies  to  prepare  proposals  for \nsmall,  quick-gestation  subprojects,  with  an  indicative  amount  of  $500,000  allocated  to  each \nprovince.16 All activities supported through the TA Loan funds at the provincial level, including all \nprojects to be prepared through the feasibility studies, will have to be within the capacity of the \nprovincial  governments  to  implement  and  manage.  During  fact-finding  for  the  water  resources \nsector component of the TA Loan, the provincial governments, represented by departments of \nirrigation and power, planning and development, and finance, identified numerous projects and \nmanagement programs in various stages of preparation that could be supported through the TA \nLoan. Many of the proposed feasibility studies identified in the different provinces were similar in \nscope, and included small storage structures, development of spate irrigation systems, capacity \nbuilding, and groundwater management. \n \n42. \nAs water supply and sanitation are provincial and/or local government subjects, and no \nfederal department and/or ministry deals with them, they were not covered by TA Loan. ADB is \napproaching water supply and sanitation holistically through the basic urban services projects, \nwhich are series of interventions with at least one project for each province in 2003\u20132007. \n \nC. \n\nCost Estimates \n\nThe total project cost is estimated at $33.67 million equivalent, including interest during \n43. \nimplementation. The foreign exchange cost is estimated at $18.49 million, while local currency \ncosts are estimated at $15.18 million. The total cost includes interest during implementation of \n$0.34 million, which will be paid by the Government. The cost estimates are inclusive of taxes \nand  duties  to  be  financed  by  the  Government.  The  amounts  associated  with  taxes  and  duties \nare  immaterial  as  they  only  relate  to  minor  equipment  purchases  under  each  subproject.  The \nconcern of forward recurrent costs related to operation and maintenance is not an issue as none \nof  the  interventions  under  the  project  require  continuous  financing.  However,  it  is  an  issue  for \nthe  follow-on  loans,  and  recurrent  costs  concern  will  be  incorporated  as  part  of  the  TOR  for \neach relevant subproject. \n\n \nTable 1: Project Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n \n\nItem \n\nLocal Currency \n\nEnabling Environment for Infrastructure Investors/ IMU \nPower Sector Component \nTransport Sector Component \nWater Resources Sector Component \nInterest during Implementation \n\nTotal \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nForeign \nExchange \n0.85 \n4.92 \n8.14 \n4.24 \n0.34 \n18.49 \n\n0.80 \n4.08 \n6.54 \n3.76 \n0.00 \n15.18 \n\nTotal \nCosts \n\n1.65 \n9.00 \n14.68 \n8.00 \n0.34 \n33.67 \n\n                                                 \n16  Large  dams  and  major,  federally-executed  water  projects  will  not  be  prepared;  rather,  this  is  expected  to  follow \nupon  the  institutional  and  human  resources  capacity  to  be  developed  under  the  TA  Loan.  Separate  projects  for \nmajor  canal  and  irrigation  rehabilitation  at  the  provincial  level  will  be  prepared  under  ADB  grant-financed  project \npreparatory TAs covering Punjab (2005) and Sindh (2006). Hence, these investments will not be covered under the \nTA Loan. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nD. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n44. \nADB will provide a TA Loan of $25 million equivalent, about 75% of the total project cost, \nto  cover  the  foreign  exchange  costs,  except  for  the  interest  during  implementation,  as  well  as \n44%  of  the  local  currency  costs.  However,  the  split  between  foreign  and  domestic  currencies \nshould  be  seen  as  the  best  possible  indicative  estimate  available,  as  it  may  change  during \nimplementation  because  of  better  knowledge  about  the  use  of  international  and  domestic \nconsultants in each subproject. The Government will finance the remaining $8.67 million (about \n25%),  which  will  cover  local  currency  counterpart  financing  as  well  as  the  $0.34  million  for \ninterest  during  implementation  in  foreign  exchange.  The  Government  financing  is  expected  to \ncover  items  such  as  (i)  remuneration  of  counterpart  staff,  (ii)  local  travel,  (iii)  equipment \n(vehicles, computers, software, etc.), (iv) surveys and data gathering, (v) taxes and duties, and \n(vi)  other  miscellaneous  costs,  of  which  most  will  be  provided  in  kind  and  accordingly  the \navailability of counterpart financing should thus not be an issue.  \n \n45. \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be  responsible  for  repaying  the  TA  Loan.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  financial  position  indicates  sufficient  internally  generated  resources  with  a \ncorresponding balance of payments to support timely repayments of the ADB loan. Should MOF \nneed  to  recover  a  proportional  amount  of  the  loan  repayment  from  each  sector  agency,  the \namounts could be reduced at source. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \n\nItem \n\nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \nTotal \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\n18.15 \n0.34 \n18.49 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n6.85 \n8.33 \n15.18 \n\nTotal \nCosts \n25.00 \n8.67 \n33.67 \n\n46. \nADB will provide a loan of $25 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, \nwith  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  with  an  interest  rate  of  1%  per \nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as will be set forth in the loan and project agreements. \n \nAlthough no cofinancing is envisioned in conjunction with the TA Loan, cofinancing from \n47. \nofficial  (loan  and  grant)  and  commercial  sources  may  be  mobilized  for  the  follow-on  projects, \nwhich will be developed under the TA Loan. Cofinancing from commercial sources may benefit \nfrom ADB\u2019s credit enhancement, including ADB\u2019s guarantee instruments, and will be presented \nin conjunction with the processing of follow-on projects. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management and Coordination \n\n48. \nThe  IMU  will  be  established  within  the  PDD  to  manage  the  increased  activity  resulting \nfrom the Government\u2019s focus on infrastructure. The IMU will be responsible for implementation \nof all components, day-to-day operations of the TA Loan, and coordination with ADB. The IMU \nwill have a director of at least the joint secretary level, and experts with substantial experience in \nvarious  infrastructure  sectors  as  well  as  overall  planning  exposure.  The  IMU  will  steer \ninfrastructure  development  and  coordinate  with  all  involved  Government  ministries  and \n\n\f \n\n13 \n\nfor \n\nIA  will  be  responsible \n\nagencies. It will report to the Secretary of the PDD, and it will discuss, review, and approve the \nprogram on utilizing the TA Loan, including approval of subprojects. The TA Loan will provide \nassistance so the PDD can perform executing agency functions through the IMU. The IMU will \nbe responsible for developing each component\u2019s program, overseeing the implementation, and \nmonitoring the progress of the individual subprojects within the four components. The IMU will \nassist each IA prepare and submit on time Planning Commission Approval Document 1 (PC I) \nand  Planning  Commission  Approval  Document  2  (PC  II)  as  required,  as  well  as  recruit \nconsultants  on  time,  inclusive  of  development  of  requests  for  proposals  and  selection  of \nits  subproject\u2019s  detailed  activities  and \nconsultants.  Each \nimplementation, and will report the  progress to the IMU. The reporting requirements are to be \ndeveloped by the IMU in coordination with the respective IAs and ADB. The TA Loan structure \nand flow chart are in Appendix 7. The EA/IMU will submit the proposed approved subprojects to \nADB for review and approval. The format of the subproject proposal is in Appendix 8. \n \n49. \nEach  IA  will  nominate  a  subproject  director,  acceptable  to  ADB,  to  administer  the \nsubproject. Each subproject director will be responsible for overseeing social, resettlement, and \nenvironmental  issues  as  well  as  engineering,  financial,  and  economic  aspects  required  to \nexecute  the  subproject.  Each  subproject  director  will  have  the  resources  and  facilities  to \nimplement their respective subprojects. \n \nThe TA Loan aims to ensure timely implementation and use of its resources by allowing \n50. \nreallocation  of  funds  between  the  four  components  should  they  be  constrained  by  the  original \nallocation. Any reallocation will be determined by the IMU in close consultation with the sectors \nand ADB. Line ministries will be responsible for handling the federal and provincial aspects of \nthe TA Loan. \n \n\n2. \n\nComponent-specific Implementation Arrangements \n\n \n\na. \n\nEnabling Environment for Infrastructure Investments \n\n51. \nThis  component  will  be  implemented  by  the  IMU.  The  IMU  will  share  the  consultants\u2019 \nfindings  with  a  wide  spectrum  of  stakeholders,  and  enlist  assistance  from  ministries  and \nagencies when the interventions to remove investor constraints have been prepared. ADB has \nmade  arrangements  to  ensure  that  activities  are  well  coordinated  with  the  proposed  Public-\nPrivate Facility for Infrastructure Finance once approved. \n  \n\nb. \n\nPower Sector  \n\n52. \nAs each subproject has been identified, inclusive of its IA (Appendix 3), the focus will be \non implementation. Each IA is responsible for developing the detailed TORs and for presenting \nthem  to  the  IMU  and  ADB  for  approval.  Where  appropriate,  the  IMU  will  seek  input  and \nconcurrence from MOWP before approval and calling for expressions of interest. The IAs will be \nresponsible for short-listing consultants, evaluating proposals, and preparing the documents for \napproval of the selection by IMU and ADB.  \n \n\nc. \n\nTransport Sector  \n\n \n53. \nA Transport Sector Steering Committee (TSSC) will be established to coordinate with all \ninvolved  Government  agencies,  and  will  be  chaired  by  the  Secretary,  PDD,  and  will  meet  at \nleast  semiannually.  Other  members  will  be  representatives  of  the  MOF,  MOC,  MOR,  MOPS, \nMOLG, EAD, NHA, ADB, and all other relevant Government agencies. The TSSC will discuss, \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nreview,  and  approve  the  program  to  use  the  transport  component,  including  approval  of \nsubprojects.  Each  subproject  may  have,  if  required,  several  consulting  contracts  so  that  the \nconsultants\u2019 work program can be efficiently and effectively monitored and adjusted. The IAs will \nbe  responsible  for  monitoring  the  consultants  and  will  provide  logistical  support  to  them  and \nreview their outputs. \n \n54. \nNHA will be the main IA for the roads sub-component, including PPP projects, MOR for \nrailways, and MOPS for ports. The IAs will (i) maintain the quality of work programs, (ii) monitor \nthe  level  of  project  utilization  to  ensure  consistency  with  national  development  objectives,  and \n(iii) supervise the consultants\u2019 work.  \n \n\nd. \n\nWater Resources  \n\nThe MOWP will be the IA for the TAP that will be developed under TA No. 4435-PAK17 \n55. \nto  develop  irrigation  and  will  assist  in  preparation  of  the  detailed  TOR  and  costing  for  the \nactivities  covered  under  the  $4  million  of  the  TA  Loan  allocated  to  the  TAP.  A  TAP  steering \ncommittee  will  oversee  development  and  implementation  of  the  TAP,  provide  policy  guidance, \nand  monitor  and  evaluate  the  TAP\u2019s  impact.  The  TAP  steering  committee  will  meet  at  least \nsemiannually and have representation from MOWP, the PDD, MOF, EAD, and the Indus River \nSystem Authority, among others. \n \n56. \nComponent activities will require approval by the EA and ADB. The provincial agencies \nthat avail themselves of TA Loan funds will be the IAs and responsible for developing proposals \nfor  funding,  the  PC-I  or  PC-II,  detailed  TORs,  recruiting  consultants,  and  monitoring  and \nevaluating  outputs  with  support  from  the  IMU.  Once  the  TA  Loan  is  approved,  provincial \nagencies will formally solicit proposals.  Within 6 months after all proposals have been received, \nthe  agencies  will  select  activities  that  will  use  TA  Loan  funds.  Provisionally,  $500,000  is \nearmarked for each province. \n \n\n3. \n\nSubproject Selection Criteria \n\n \n57. \nAn  objective  of  using  the  TA  Loan  modality  is  to  ensure  increased  Government \nownership of its institutional capacity building and project preparatory program and activities. As \nthe  subprojects  are  implemented,  ADB  is  expected  to  find  increased  capacities  to  address \nsubstantial project preparatory and sector issues. The overall objective of selecting subprojects \nwas to engage the Government authorities in identifying and evaluating candidate subprojects. \nIn  selecting  subprojects,  the  Government  aims  to  adopt  the  PC\u2019s  integrated  approach  to \ninfrastructure development. It will use the following criteria (i) the subproject must be based on a \nsector strategy, master plan, or road map, (ii) it must be in line with ADB\u2019s objectives as stated \nin the current CSP and CSPU, (iii) it must be organizationally and/or technically feasible, (iv) it \nmust  be  financially  and  economically  viable  and  sustainable,  (v)  it  must  be  prepared  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  meet \nthe  Government\u2019s \nenvironmental  requirements;  (vi)  it  must  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  social  policies  and \noperational  procedures  including  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement,  and  a  resettlement \nplan will be prepared under each subproject and measures will be taken in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  People,  if  required  and  (vi)  it  must  be  implemented  during  the \nproject  period.  The  standard  subproject  proposal  form  to  be  used  by  the  IAs  when \npresenting the subproject proposal to the EA is in Appendix 7. \n                                                 \n17  Under  ADB.  2004.Technical  Assistance  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  TA  4435-PAK:  Water  Sector \n\nIrrigation Development.  Manila (TA 4435-PAK, approved for $300,000 in November 2004). \n\n\f \n\n15 \n\n A  number  of  the  identified  subprojects  are  project  preparatory  facilities  for  projects \n58. \nincluded for ADB financing in the 2005\u20132006 CSPU18, and the subprojects are expected to form \nthe  backbone  of  ADB\u2019s  infrastructure  assistance  to  Pakistan  beyond  the  current  planning \nframework. The TA Loan modality is important to ensure the establishment of a healthy lending \nand nonlending program for ADB. It is also a strong link between the Government infrastructure \ndevelopment program and ADB\u2019s CSPU development process. The complementarity is a result \nof  successful  dialogue  between  the  Government  and  ADB  on  ADB\u2019s  operational  program  for \nPakistan. \n \n59. \nThe  power  and  transport  sectors  have  preselected  all  subprojects  as  part  of  the \nprocessing of the TA Loan, identified IAs, and prepared outline TORs. They have also ensured \nthat  the  IMU  has  sector  competence  and  the  resources  to  help  the  IAs  implement  their \nsubprojects. Sector-specific criteria are given below.  \n \nAll  follow-on  projects,  arriving  from  successfully  implemented  subprojects,  selected \n60. \nfor financing by ADB (as part of ADB\u2019s lending operations) must have their feasibility studies \nreviewed  by  the  EA  and  ADB.  To  qualify  for  full-scale  project  processing,  the  follow-on \nproject will be (i) technically feasible; (ii) economically and financially viable and sustainable; \n(iii)  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002);  (iv)  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nPolicy on Involuntary Resettlement; and (v) in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous \nPeople.  \n \n\n4. \n\nImplementation Schedule and Period \n\n \n61. \nThe  TA  Loan  is  expected  to  be  implemented  over  4  years,  from  September  2005  to \nSeptember 2009. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 9. Each subproject will have an \nimplementation schedule independent of but within the TA Loan\u2019s implementation period, to be \nshown in the subproject agreement. \n \n\n5. \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nAll  goods  and  services  under  the  TA  Loan  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \n62. \nGuidelines for Procurement. The IAs will determine the required goods and services, and submit \ntheir  requests  for  ADB  approval.  As  most  subproject  procurements  are  expected  to  be  for \nroutine  office  and  administrative  equipment  of  an  estimated  value  of  less  than  $100,000  and \nmost efficiently acquired off the shelf, direct procurement procedures are recommended. Supply \ncontracts  for  equipment  of  more  than  $500,000  will  follow  international  competitive  bidding, \nwhile contracts of $500,000 or less will follow international shopping procedures. \n \n6. \n \n63. \nThe IAs, in coordination with the IMU, will be responsible for selecting and engaging the \nconsultants,  which  could  be  international  or  domestic  firms  and  individuals,  to  provide  the \nrequired services, including as per the TORs for each subproject, which include (i) development \nof strategy to enhance the enabling environment for infrastructure investments; (ii) preparation \nof  the  subproject  feasibility  studies;  (iii)  preparation  of  the  subproject  detailed  designs;  (iv) \npreparation  of  the  subproject  bidding  documents  and  evaluation;  (v)  institutional  capacity \nbuilding; (vi) development of a public-private modality for financing, constructing, and operating \n                                                 \n18  Project  selection  criteria  for  these  projects  are  also  reflected  in  the  2005\u20132006  CSPU,  as  a  result  of  the  policy \n\ndialogue between ADB and the Government. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nand  maintaining  infrastructure  facilities;  and  (vii)  preparation  of  environmental,  poverty,  and \nsocial assessments and, if required, a resettlement plan, an indigenous people\u2019s development \nplan.  The  process  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  consultants.  ADB  will  review  and \napprove the processing of the consultant recruitments. \n \n64. \nEach  IA  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  the  consultants  for  each  subproject,  in \nconsultation with IMU. Each IA will provide logistical support to the consultants and review their \noutputs.  Consultants,  whether  individuals  or  firms,  may  be  contracted  for  several  subprojects \nwithin one or more sectors as long as they are first-ranked. Each consultant contract is viewed \nas  an  independent  event  and  is  subject  to  evaluation  by  the  IA,  review  and  approval  by  the \nEA/IMU, and agreement by ADB. If the IA and/or IMU evaluate the consultants\u2019 performance as \nunsatisfactory,  the  IMU  reserves  the  right  to  terminate  them  and  recruit  new  ones,  subject  to \nADB's  agreement.  For  the  first  year  of  implementation,  about  100  and  200  person-months  of \ninternational  and  domestic  consulting  services,  respectively,  are  required  for  a  combined \nfeasibility and engineering study, including procurement assistance, for the priority subprojects. \nTentative estimates for the whole TA Loan are approximately 600 and 1,500 person-months of \ninternational and domestic consulting services, respectively. \n \n65. \nThe  consultant  firms  will  be  engaged  using  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nprocedures  or  quality-based  selection  (QBS)  procedures,  whichever  is  best  suited  for  the \nsubproject.  QBS  is  required  where  technical  expertise  is  the  overriding  requirement.  Two  or \nmore QBS contracts could be required in the transport component.  \n \n The  outline  TORs  for  all  subprojects  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix.  These  will  be \n66. \nreviewed and enhanced by the IAs, and additional refinements are expected before issuance of \nthe request-for-proposal documents, which will include the detailed TORs. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangement \n\n \n67. \nTA Loan disbursement will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, \nas amended from time to time, and detailed arrangements between the Government and ADB. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  paid  disbursed  directly  to  the  consultants  based  on  approved \ncontracts  under  the  direct  payment  procedure.  A  signed  withdrawal  application  must  be \nsubmitted by the IMU to ADB together with the consultant\u2019s claim or invoice. The statement of \nexpenditure  procedure  will  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures  for  any  individual \npayment transaction up to $50,000 equivalent. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n Each  IA  will  monitor  and  evaluate  project  performance  in  accordance  with  the  TORs \n68. \nand the project framework. Primary monitoring targets will be agreed on between the IMU and \nIAs per subproject, and these targets will be used by the IAs and reported to the IMU and ADB \nin accordance with the established reporting schedule. \n\n \n9. \n\nReports \n\n \n69. \nThe IMU will monitor project and subproject executions to provide a basis to identify the \nareas for infrastructure development. The IAs will submit quarterly progress reports on project \nimplementation, which the IMU will consolidate. The reports should indicate, among other items, \n(i) progress made against established targets, (ii) problems or issues encountered and remedial \n\n\f \n\n17 \n\nactions  taken  or  proposed  to  resolve  them,  and  (iii)  proposed  project  activities  as  well  as \nprogress  expected  during  the  implementation  period,  including  details on  contract awards  and \ndisbursement projections. \n \nThe  progress  reports  are  expected  to  summarize  sufficient  information  to  enable  the \n70. \nGovernment,  IMU,  IAs,  and  ADB  to  monitor  the  most  recent  progress,  identify  issues,  and \nensure  compliance  with  the  subprojects\u2019  objectives.  Consultants  are  expected  to  prepare \ndetailed  reports  for  the  IAs  and  the  IMU  as  well  as  for  ADB\u2019s  review  missions.  The  progress \nreports  will  contain  an  executive  summary  of  the  detailed  reports,  with  format  and  content \nallowing  ADB  staff  members  to  readily  capture  key  information  for  inputting  into  the  project \nperformance  report.  This  will  serve  as  the  main  tool  for  monitoring  project  implementation \nperformance within ADB. \n \n71. \nEach IA will prepare a completion report for each subproject within 3 months of complete \ndisbursement  of  the  subproject.  The  report  should  contain detailed  information  concerning  the \nsubproject\u2019s  implementation  and  outcome.  It  will  evaluate  how  effectively  the  subproject  has \nassisted the infrastructure developments of the respective sector and its contribution to national \ndevelopment  objectives.  The  TA  Loan  project  completion  report  will  be  provided  by  the  IMU \nwithin 3 months of completed disbursement.  \n\n \n10. \n\nEvaluation of Feasibility Reports and Final Consultant Reports \n\n \n72. \nThe  IMU  and  ADB  will  review  and  comment  on  the  consultants\u2019  draft  final  feasibility \nreports.  ADB  will  be  engaged  throughout  the  progress  of  the  institutional  capacity-building \nsubprojects,  especially  those  that  have  policy  dialogue  and  sector  reform  elements.  As  these \nsubprojects will vary in nature, it will be up to the ADB sector divisions to monitor, evaluate, and \nguide the IAs and ministries, and engage them in policy dialogue. ADB will review and comment \non the consultants\u2019 reports prepared as part of the subprojects.  \n \n\n11. \n\nProject Review and Accounts and Audit \n\n \n73. \nADB will regularly review (i) the TA Loan; (ii) the use of facilities, IAs, and subprojects, to \nprevent significant fund underutilization; (iii) the approval of additional IAs; and (iv) the need for \nfund reallocation, if any. A midterm project review is expected to be undertaken halfway through \nthe TA Loan implementation, to assess implementation, progress, and achievements. \n \nThe  IAs  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  to  identify  financing  resources \n74. \nreceived  and  expenditures  made  on  the  TA  Loan,  including  the  equipment  and  services \nfinanced  out  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  local  funds.  These  TA  Loan  accounts  and  financial \nstatements  as  well  as  the  state-owned  enterprise  procedure  will  be  audited  annually  in \naccordance with sound auditing standards by auditors acceptable to ADB. The Government will \nsubmit annual audited reports and related financial statements to ADB within 6 months after the \nend of each fiscal year. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE   \n\n \n75. \nSince  the  TA  Loan  aims  to  improve  the  enabling  environment  for  investment  in \ninfrastructure,  the  Government  requested  ADB  to  provide  a  small-scale  TA  to  identify  and \ndevelop solutions for immediate obstacles. The small-scale TA will have two elements that will \nbe  implemented  in  succession:  (i)  undertake  a  diagnostic  review  of  the  environment  for \ninvestment  in  infrastructure,  which  will  result  in  a  list  of  investment  constraints;  and  (ii)  design \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\ninterventions  to  remove  these  constraints.  The  interventions  will  be  funded  by  the  enabling \nenvironment component of the TA Loan. Domestic consultants will be hired, providing a total of \n32  person-months,  and  will  have  skills  in  assessing  investment  climate  and  experience  in \nenhancing infrastructure investments. The $150,000 small-scale TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The outline of the small-scale TA is in Appendix 10. \n \n\nV.  \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n \nIncreased  funding  of  infrastructure  projects  will  be  ensured  by  improving  the  enabling \n76. \nenvironment  for  infrastructure  investment,  and  additional  projects  can  be  developed  and \nimplemented after removing investment constraints diagnosed and resolved under the TA Loan. \n \nThe  TA  Loan  will  ensure  that  (i)  institutional  capacities  of  infrastructure  project \n77. \nidentification,  development,  preparatory  activities,  implementation,  and  monitoring  materialize \non time while meeting international standards and best practices; and (ii) infrastructure services \nare  increased  by  enhancing  resources  for  subproject  preparation  and  financing  follow-on \nprojects.  \n \n78. \nThe  TA  Loan  will  support  efficient  development  of  infrastructure  services  and  thereby \ncontribute to national economic development and poverty reduction. It will provide infrastructure \nfacilities required by sector development plans, and benefit rural and urban infrastructure users \nby enabling them to efficiently undertake more economic activities. The TA Loan will bring IAs' \nproject  preparation  capacity  up  to  international  standards  and  improve  governance  and \ntransparency in consultant selection and procurement. \n \n79. \nThe risk of uncoordinated development of infrastructure facilities will be mitigated by the \nPlanning  Commission  and  the  IAs.  The  EA  will  coordinate  an  integrated  approach  to \ninfrastructure development, with several subprojects in the same region and provinces using the \nTA Loan to provide an appropriate level of assistance to avoid overloading provinces, regions, \nIAs, and domestic consultants.  \n \n80. \nClose ADB supervision of implementation will mitigate the risk of its delay. ADB will be \ninvolved with the IMU, which will have authority to decide on the TA Loan utilization. ADB will \nalso guide the EA and IAs in preparing proposals for assistance through the TA Loan. To avoid \ndelays in engaging consultants, the Government has agreed to (i) identify the EA, establish the \nIMU,  and  nominate  the  project  director,  (ii)  nominate  IA  coordinators,  and  (iii)  prepare  several \nsubprojects for immediate financing. Consultant engagement and procurement will follow ADB \nguidelines to ensure transparent and competitive processes. \n \n81. \nThe TA Loan is expected to ensure development of environmentally and socially viable \nlending  and  non-lending  projects.  Follow-on  loans  will  be  prepared  in  compliance  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  environmental  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002). \nBecause of the nature of project preparation, the TA Loan is not expected to have any adverse \nenvironmental  or  social  impacts.  The  summary  poverty  and  social  analysis  report  for  the  TA \nLoan  is  in  Appendix  11.  Environmental  and  social  impacts  relating  to  follow-on  loans  will  be \nexamined and assessed in accordance with the Government\u2019s environment laws and regulation \nand ADB\u2019s environment policy. \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n19 \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n82. \nassurances, which will be incorporated into the legal documents: \n \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe Government will ensure that the TA Loan and all its subprojects and follow-\non projects will be prepared in accordance with (a) the Government\u2019s applicable \nenvironmental laws and regulations; and (b) ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). \n\nThe Government will ensure that for subprojects and follow-on projects entailing \nland acquisition and resettlement, resettlement plans are prepared in accordance \nwith  (a)  the  Government\u2019s  applicable  laws  and  policies,  and  (b)  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  relevant  resettlement  procedures. \nAdequate  measures  to  avoid  or  minimize  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  will \nbe  incorporated  into  subproject  and  follow-on  project  designs.  The  Government \nwill  ensure  that  (a)  measures  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s applicable laws and regulations related to indigenous peoples, and \n(b)  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1999)  and  relevant  procedures  of \nindigenous  peoples  are  incorporated  into  subproject  and  follow-on  project \ndesigns. \n\nThe Government will provide adequate resources and facilities to implement the \nTA Loan and all its subprojects effectively through the EA and IAs.  \n\nEach IA will appoint a competent subproject director, acceptable to ADB, for the \nduration  of  the  subproject,  who  will  have  capacities  to  oversee  social, \nresettlement, environmental, and sector aspects of the relevant subproject.  \n\nThe Government will ensure that the EA and each IA will enter into a Subproject \nAgreement for execution of the relevant subproject. \n\nThe Government will ensure that all draft final feasibility study reports related to \nthe TA Loan will be submitted to ADB for review.  \n\nThe Government will meet the following condition before the loan becomes effective: the \n\n \nConditions for Loan Effectiveness and Disbursement \n\nB. \n \n83. \nIMU will be established by the Government, and its director appointed. \n \n84. \nhas been duly executed, to the satisfaction of ADB. \n\n \n\nNo disbursement shall be made under each subproject unless its Subproject Agreement \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n85. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSpecial Drawing Rights (SDR17,163,000) to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for Infrastructure \nDevelopment from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter;

Pakistan\u2019s  power  sector  consists  primarily  of  two  public \n1. \nsector utilities: the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA), which is a government-\nowned  statutory  body,  and  the  Karachi  Electric  Supply  Company  (KESC),  which  is  a  public \nlimited liability company with predominantly government ownership. In addition to WAPDA and \nKESC, the  sector consists of 21 independent power producers (IPPs), and two nuclear power \ngeneration  companies.  The  total  installed  generation  capacity  is  17,793  megawatts  (MW),  of \nwhich WAPDA\u2019s capacity is 9,781 MW (55%) and KESC\u2019s capacity is 1,756 MW (10%), while \nthe total nuclear capacity is 462 MW (3%). The total generation capacity of the IPPs is 5,693.76 \nMW  (32%).  In  terms  of  fuel  source,  12,285  MW  (69%)  is  thermal  based,  while  5,046  MW  is \nhydel  based  (28%),  and  nuclear  accounts  for  2.3%.    The  total  annual  generation  for  FY2003 \nwas  75,682  gigawatt  hours  (GWh),  which  translates  into  an  annual  compounded  growth  rate \n(ACGR) of 4.0%. \n \n2. \nGovernment Policy.  The objective of the Government\u2019s new infrastructure initiative in \nthe  power  sector  policy  is  to  deliver  more  reliable  and  affordable  electricity  to  the  industrial, \ncommercial, and household customers on a nationwide basis. Infrastructure has become equal \nto  economic  growth,  and  well-guided  economic  growth  should  benefit  the  macroeconomic \nposition of Pakistan as well as the alleviation of poverty. There are several key elements in the \npower  sector  to  meet  this  objective,  and  specifically  government-supported  initiatives  are  (i) \nencourage  an  increased  utilization  of  hydropower,  coal,  and  natural  gas  reserves  for  power \ngeneration,  which  are  fuel  sources  yielding  a  lower  cost  of  production  than  what  is  being \nexperienced today; (ii) reduce technical and nontechnical losses of the power sector utilities; (iii) \ngradually  increase  the  tempo  of  power  sector  reforms  and  restructuring,  inclusive  of \nprivatizations,  and  (iv)  continue  support  of  the  National  Electric  Power  Regulatory  Authority \n(NEPRA)  the  independent  regulator  of  the  power  sector  through  issuance  of  mainly  licenses \nand tariff determinations. \n \n3. \nIn  order  for  the  Government  to  meet  the  policy,  a  number  of  issues  facing  the  power \nsector  such  as  (i)  financial  and  operating  performance  of  the  sector,  (ii)  lack  of  generation \nfacilities,  (iii)  old  and  outdated  dispatch  center,  and  (iv)  transmission  and  distribution  system \naugmentations  and  expansions  need  to  be  addressed.    The  power  sector  deficit,  which  has \nbeen funded through budgetary support in the form of grants and subsidies, cannot continue as \nit encroaches on social sector spending.  For FY2003, the total financial losses of WAPDA and \nKESC reached 1% of gross domestic product (GDP), whereas 1.8% was the budgetary support \nfor the same period.  The power utilities have faced operational inefficiencies during the last 2 \ndecades  in  terms  of  (i)  high  furnace  oil  costs,  (ii)  unreasonable  levels  of  transmission  and \ndistribution  losses,  (iii)  high  purchase  costs  of  electricity  from  the  IPPs,  and  (iv)  ineffective \nsubsidization  of  the  agriculture  sector  as  well  as  domestic  consumers.    To  combat  these \ninefficiencies, restructuring of WAPDA and KESC was initiated from the mid to late 1990s. \n \nGovernment  Power  Sector  Strategy.    The  power  sector  strategy  and  its  detailed \n4. \nactivities are developed to support the establishment of a financially and technically sustainable \nsector, which supports and encourages economic growth through a single buyer market.  The \nactivities  are  substantial  and  require  substantial  resources.    Some  of  the  key  aspects  are  (i) \nensure  independent  regulation  of  the  power  sector;  (ii)  unbundle  WAPDA  and  establish  the  3 \ngencos, 8 discos, and the National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) which is the \nnational transmission company and the executor of the single buyer model of power sector; (iii) \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n25\n\nThe \n\nimmediate \n\ninstitutional  capacity  requirements \n\ncommence  the  privatization  program;  and  (iv)  evaluate  and  optimize  the  fuel  sources  of  the \npower sector to reduce the overall tariff requirement. Other activities are also being pursued but, \nin terms of sector impact, these activities would not be as substantial as the items listed above.  \nThe increase of renewable energy contribution to the national generation pool is one such area, \nwhile  other  areas  are  off-grid  systems,  energy  conservation,  and  cleaner  production \ntechnologies in the industry sector. \n \n5. \nThe  first  action  required  is  to  further  unbundle  WAPDA\u2019s  power  wing,  and  move  the \nunbundling  from  a  legal  separation  to  a  functional  and  operational  separation  of  the  12  new \ncompanies.  This would entail the new companies operating with increased autonomy, and with \ndirectors  of  their  respective  boards  being  independent  of  any  other  company  in  the  power \nsector. The second action would be to complete the privatization of KESC, and the third action \nwould be to enhance the role of the regulator as NEPRA gets more and more mature through \nexperience  and  provision  of  institutional  capacity  building.    Additional  generation  capacity  is \nrequired and this would be by undertaking the first phase of project development in the public \nsector and then seek, through a competitive process, private sector capital, management, and \ntechnical know-how to erect and operate the new projects. \n \n6. \nthe  power  sector \nrestructuring  activities,  and  in  particular  on  ensuring  that  the  new  companies  within  the  power \nsector are able to execute the assigned tasks and responsibilities.  The first priority is to ensure \nthat  NTDC  develops  its  skills  to  handle  both  the  power  transmission  system  and  the  single \nbuyer  function,  as  NTDC  will  be  the  focal  point  between  the  generation  and  distribution \ncompanies.  The TA Loan will further establish NTDC as an independent company.  The second \npriority  is  for  the  new  discos  to  develop  their  respective  skills  in  the  areas  of  (i)  distribution \nsystem  planning,  (ii)  project  identification  and  prioritization  of  project  development,  and  (iii) \nproject  design  and  implementation.    These  functions  used  to  be  the  responsibility  of  WAPDA, \nbut  now  need  to  be  integrated  into  each  of  the  new  discos.    The  TA  Loan  will  address  this \naspect through a subproject. \n \n7. \nKarachi Electric Supply Company (KESC).  As for KESC, the Government established \na  steering  committee  to  develop  a  privatization  strategy  and  plan.    This  took  place  under  the \nADB  program  called  Energy  Sector  Restructuring  Program.1    In  addition,  ADB  undertook  the \ncontracting  of  the  privatization  advisors  for  the  KESC  privatization  through  a  technical \nassistance2.    The  financial  restructuring  process  of  KESC  has  taken  a  bit  longer  than \nanticipated, but the Government and the lenders have been able to work out all major issues for \nthe privatization to take place, and the bidding process is expected to be concluded during the \n1st quarter of 2005.  During the most recent years, the Government has spent about $200 million \nfor funding of the annual cash deficits in KESC.  The budget relief estimated from a partial sale \nof KESC would give the Government substantial resources to pursue the development agenda \nset forth in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. \n \n8. \nWater  and  Power  Development  Authority  (WAPDA).

WAPDA\u2019s \npower  sector  operations  have,  in  principle,  been  unbundled  into  12  companies;  3  generation \ncompanies,  1  national  transmission  and  despatch  company  (NTDC),  and  8  distribution \ncompanies.  Although this restructuring has been completed in legal terms, the implementation \nof  the  unbundling  continues  to  be  slower  than  anticipated  and  required  to  ensure  rapid  sector \nimprovements.    Of  the  new  companies,  one  generation  and  two  distribution  companies  have \nbeen identified and selected for privatization.  Privatization advisors have been contracted and, \nin terms of two of the transactions, the process has proceeded towards a bidding round.  A few \nissues  are  still  outstanding,  but  Privatization  Commission  estimated  that  these  transactions \nwould be completed during the first half of 2005.  The World Bank has been working with the \nGovernment, WAPDA, and the new companies to produce the Financial Recovery Plan (FRP) \nfor  the  WAPDA  group  of  companies.    The  FRP  is  a  medium-term  financial  roadmap  for  the \nperiod  2005\u20132009.  The  World  Bank  has  been  working  on  FRP  for  the  WAPDA  group  of \ncompanies.   \n \n9. \nRegulation.    NEPRA  has  established  its  regulatory  credentials  over  the  last  5  years, \nand continues to emerge as a pillar of the power sector reform effort through diligent execution \nof  the  NEPRA  Act.  ADB  provided  institutional  capacity  support  to  NEPRA  in  2000  and  2001 \nthrough a technical assistance project3.  From a principal point of view, NEPRA is moving the \ntariff-setting  approach  away  from  subsidies  and  towards  full  cost  recovery  of  production  of \nelectricity.  Some of the details in the determinations have been viewed to lean in favor of the \nconsumers  creating  limited  or  negative  cash  values  for  the  power  sector  companies  and \ninvestors  due  to  inherent  inefficiencies  in  the  sector.    NEPRA  continues  to  issue  licenses  to \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution companies, as well as presenting tariff determinations \nfor each distribution company.  Of particular interest is the license issued to NTDC, which calls \nfor NTDC to be the single buyer of electricity in Pakistan as well as being the national dispatcher \nof  electricity  responsible  for  the  transmission  network.    As  part  of  ADB\u2019s  sector  reform  and \nrestructuring  interventions,  it  is  supporting  the  transformation  of  NTDC4  from  a  department \nwithin  WAPDA\u2019s  organization  to  an  independent  company  responsible  for  the  single  buyer \nmarket operations and dispatcher of electricity in Pakistan. The untangling of the high financial \nand technical losses, reduction of the subsidy levels, and meeting the consumers\u2019 expectations \nof  improved  supply  at  minimum  cost  increase  appear  to  be  impossible  tasks.  NEPRA  has \ncontinued to address the issues with determination and sustainability of the power sector as its \nmain  focus.    Further  improvements  in  the  timeliness  of  implementation  of  NEPRA\u2019s \ndeterminations and further strengthening of its capabilities through a World Bank-funded facility \nshould further improve the financial and operational sustainability of the power sector. \n \n10. \nInvestments. Today, there are three major investment concerns facing the power sector \nand  a  number  of  less  dominant  but  still  rather  important  issues.    The  major  issues  are  (i) \ninvestments  to  meet  the  technical  deterioration  of  the  transmission  and  distribution  system  as \nwell as the generation assets that are coming of age, (ii) meeting the expectations and demand \nfrom  about  40%  of  Pakistan\u2019s  population  who  requires  access  to  electricity  supply,  and  (iii) \nmeeting the annual increase of about 2,000 MW in generation capacity, plus related expansion \nof the transmission and distribution network, required to support the economic growth target of \nabout  8%  set  by  the  Government.  It  is  recognized  that  transmission  and  distribution  network \ninvestments in terms of augmentation and expansions have not been adequate over the last 10 \n\n                                                 \n3   ADB.  2000.

There  have  been  limited  funds  provided  by  the \ninternational  lending  agencies  due  to  focus  on  the  reforms  and  restructuring  aspects.    The \nlimited progress related to the introduction of reforms yielded several program loan facilities, but \nno investment loans.  In addition, the testing of nuclear missiles resulted in the postponement of \nfurther  funding  from  major  bilateral  partners.  The  current  mobilization  of  investment  capital \nappears  to  come  from  the  three  primary  sources,  namely,  public  funds,  multilateral/bilateral \nresources,  and  private  sector  funding,  becomes  a  priority  for  the  Government.  However,  the \nchallenge of funding activities must be supported by an adequate level of institutional capacity \nas well as an advanced level of project preparatory activities that meet international standards in \nterms of social and environmental safeguard structures, financial and economic considerations, \nand technical standards. \n \nThe Way Forward. The power sector is progressing in a positive direction with a clear \n11. \nfocus  on  both  technical  and  financial  viability  and  sustainability.    However,  further  regulatory \ntransparencies and improved governance of the sector would substantially improve its financial \nrecovery.  Major investments are required to improve the power sector\u2019s technical performance, \nbut such investment projects take time and resources to be properly developed.  The TA loan \nwill  allow  for  further  reform  and  restructuring  progress  to  evolve  in  the  sector,  while  project \npreparation and institutional capacity building is completed  on a parallel basis.  The timing for \nADB\u2019s  financial  support  in  a  major  way  would  be  according  to  progress  on  the  major  issues \nwithin the sector.   \n \nB. \n \nFollowing the overall parameters above, detailed discussions were held with the Ministry \n12. \nof  Water  and  Power  (MOWP),  WAPDA,  NTDC,  PPIB,  and  the  Planning  Commission,  which \nyielded a list of subprojects proposed to be addressed within the power sector segment of the \nTA  loan.  The  power  sector  allocation  is  $6.75  million  that  has  been  allocated  among  the \nidentified subprojects. The subprojects can be divided into two categories\u2014project preparatory \nand institutional capacity building. \n \n13. \nSupplementary Appendix B. \n \n\nThe power sector subprojects are listed below and the detailed description is provided in \n\nPower Sector Parameters \n\nTable A3.1: Power Sector Subprojects \n\n  Amount ($) \n\nDescription \na.

The  next  task  for  each  subproject  is  to  develop  the  detailed  TORs,  and \ncommence  the  consultant  selection  process  by  ensuring  proper  advertisement  of  the \nopportunities  available,  followed  by  the  establishment  of  the  long  list  of  interested  when  the \nexpression of interest deadline has expired. \n \n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n29\n\n \nA. \n\nSector Assessment \n\nTRANSPORT SECTOR \n\nTransport is an important sector of Pakistan\u2019s economy, accounting for 10% of the gross \n1. \ndomestic  product  and  about  20\u201325%  of  the  annual  public  sector  development  program.  The \nimpact  of  the  sector  on  the  economy  could  have  been  much  greater  if  the  investments  were \nmore  strategically  directed.  The  reduced  impact  was  due  not  to  lack  of  planning,  but  to  the \ninability  of  the  responsible  agencies  to  develop  a  comprehensive  policy  through  coordinated \nefforts. The result is insufficient and imbalanced funding in the sector, outdated legislation and \nregulatory  framework,  nonenforcement  of  existing  regulations,  and  failure  to  attract  foreign \ninvestments. \n \n2. \nThough  operational,  the  transport  sector  in  Pakistan  is  suffering  from  (i)  a  very  high \nmodal share of roads compared with railways, (ii) deteriorating infrastructure due to inadequate \ninvestment and lack of maintenance, (iii) transfer of large road assets from provincial to district \ngovernments, (iv) a loss-incurring railway system, and (v) expensive and inefficient ports. \n \n3. \nThe transport sector is characterized by multiple agencies that fall under the purview of \nvarious ministries, with some agencies responsible for infrastructure, others for operations, and \nothers  for  both.  The  Ministry  of  Communications  is  responsible  for  the  national  highways,  the \nMinistry of Ports and Shipping for seaports and shipping subsectors, the Ministry of Railways for \nthe railway subsector, the Ministry of Defense for the civil aviation subsector, and the provincial \nand  district  governments  for  the  provincial  and  rural  road  subsectors.  Enforcement  of  traffic \nregulations at the provincial level is the responsibility of the provincial police department and the \nMinistry  of  the  Interior.  For  national  highways,  the  National  Highway  and  Motorway  Police, \nunder MOC, is responsible for enforcing highway regulations. The Railway Police performs this \nfunction in the railway subsector. This diversity in agencies promotes an environment in which \ncoordination, intermodal planning, and enforcement are compromised. \n \n4. \nPakistan  requested  ADB  to  reorient  its  focus  from  provincial-level  projects  that  directly \ntarget poverty alleviation to major infrastructure projects that can promote economic growth and \nthus  contribute  to  poverty  reduction.  ADB  can  also  assist  the  Government  in  its  efforts  to \nintroduce international best practices, build institutions, support policy reforms, catalyze private \nsector activities, and fill the gaps where private sector is unlikely to invest. This is a challenge \nbut  also  an  opportunity:  enhancing  our  product  attractiveness,  complemented  by  added-value \nknowledge, is a long-term guarantee to ADB\u2019s relevance, specially in middle-income countries \nlike Pakistan where borrowing is based on cost but also on other types of considerations. \n \n5. \nLending  assistance,  which  was  mainly  focused  on  provincial  roads,  will  now  cover  all \ncategories of roads, including motorways (through PPPs), national highways, provincial roads, \nand  district  roads  (where  ADB  plays  a  key  role  on  the  devolution  process).  On  railways,  an \nagreement on a road map of reforms could trigger ADB\u2019s first ever operations in the sector, by \ncombining deep reforms with infrastructure rehabilitation in this strategic subsector; additionally, \nthe Government has requested to receive technical assistance from ADB for developing sector \nstrategies  for  future  improvement  of  the  railway  sector,  and  strengthening  MOR  and  PR\u2019s \ncapacity at the managerial level. On ports, while financial assistance is not expected in the short \nterm,  ADB  can  assist  the  Government  to  achieve  its  objectives  and  rationalize  its  investment \ndecisions  through  knowledge-based  services,  especially  providing  technical  assistance  to \nprioritize investment plans of the major ports, and capacity building to support the newly created \nMinistry of Ports and Shipping. \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nADB  is  also  seen  by  both  the  Government  and  the  domestic  financial  sector  as  a \n6. \nstrategic  partner  for  private  sector  participation  in  transport  infrastructure  development,  for \nwhich it can use a mix of resources from both the public and private sector windows, as well as \nknowledge-based technical assistance for PPPs. ADB is providing assistance for identifying the \nkey  constraints  to  increased  private  sector  financing,  and  providing  support  for  strenghtening \nthe  institutional,  policy,  and  regulatory  framework  for  developing  private  sector  participation  in \nnational  highway  development  1.  Additionally,  the  Government  has  requested  that  capacity \nbuilding on PPPs be provided for NHA, the Planning Commission, MOF, and other stakeholders  \nThe  ADB-assisted  pilot  project  for  the  development  of  motorway  M4  between  Faisalabad  and \nMultan  (included  in  the  country  lending  program  for  2006)  will  be  a  crucial  landmark  for \ndeveloping private sector participation in the sector. \n\n \n1. \n\nRoads \n\n \n7. \nRoads are the predominant mode of inland transport in Pakistan carrying more than 91% \nof  passenger  traffic  and  96%  of  freight  traffic.  The  average  growth  rate  is  about  4.5%  for \npassenger  traffic  and  10.5%  for  freight  traffic.  The  total  road  network  in  the  country  is \napproximately 250,000 kilometers (km) of which about 60% is paved. This includes 8,600 km of \nnational  highways  and  motorways  representing  the  main  transport  corridors,  and  providing \ninterprovincial  linkages  and  connections  to  neighboring  countries;  and  about  95,000  km  of \nprovincial roads providing all-weather access to the economic and population centers in the four \nprovinces.  The  provincial  roads  are  generally  categorized  as  highways,  and  secondary  and \naccess roads. The remaining network consists of municipal urban roads that are mostly paved, \nand largely unpaved tertiary roads providing access to villages and remote areas. The number \nof  registered  motor  vehicles  is  4.8  million  and  is  growing  at  8%  annually.  Road  transport \nservices are largely in the private sector and are subject to strong competition. \n \n8. \nThe  road  network  requires  rehabilitation,  reconstruction,  and  upgrading  at  national, \nprovincial, and district levels. Based on road conditions assessments, about half of the national \nhighway  network  and  a large  portion  of  the  provincial  road network  are  in  poor  condition.  The \nGovernment  has  initiated  a  program  for  rehabilitation  of  priority  highway  sections  with \nassistance  from  the  World  Bank  and  ADB  in  addition  to  the  Government\u2019s  resources.  For  the \nprovincial  highways  and  district  roads,  ADB  is  financing  sequenced  interventions  in  each \nprovince  for  rehabilitation  and  improvement  of  road  networks.  To  ensure  sustainability,  these \nprojects also support policy and institutional reforms and capacity building of the road agencies. \n \nFor  maintenance,  the  National  Highways  Authority  (NHA)  receives  Government \n9. \nresources that are supplemented by toll revenues. NHA\u2019s road maintenance fund, established in \n2000, is financed through toll revenues to ensure a stable and secure source of operation and \nmaintenance  funding.  Annual  revenues  collected  in  2003  were  over  PRs3.6  billion.  As  toll \nrevenues  are  increasing  every  year,  NHA  has  sufficient  resources  to  maintain  the  national \nhighways (NH) network and other designated parts of the road network. \n \n10. \nThe Government and ADB agree that major investment in the road sector is required to \nsustain  continued  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  Building  an  NH  system  and  an \nintegrated  road  network  are  preconditions  for  achieving  these  targets.  Public  resources  are, \nhowever,  not  sufficient  to  meet  the  financing  requirements  and  the  Government  is  actively \nexploring options for reducing the financing gap through support from multilateral development \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2004.

It  is  recognized  that  the  inclusion  of  the  private  sector  will \nnecessitate institutional reforms and capacity building for the concerned road agencies. \n \n11. \nAs  mentioned  above,  ADB\u2019s  support  in  the  sector  is  evolving  from  a  project-by-project \napproach  into  a  programmatic  approach,  where  assistance  to  all  categories  of  roads  is  in \nparallel  with  policy  dialogue  and  the  preparation  of  a  road  map  for  sector  reform.  A  policy \nframework  comprising  road  user  charges,  road  fund,  axle  load  control,  road  safety, \nenvironmental  and  social  aspects,  and  private  sector  participation  in  road  construction  and \noperation is needed to sustain the overall road network. Institutional improvements and capacity \nbuilding are required so that the road agencies can plan, develop, and manage road assets. \n \n \n \n12. \nHaving once been the leading transport mode in Pakistan, railways have been in decline \nfor many years. As a result (i) railways now carry less than 5% of freight traffic, (ii) infrastructure, \ntraction,  and  rolling  stock  have  deteriorated  due  to  lack  of  sufficient  investment  and \nmaintenance,  (iii)  PR  operates  at  a  loss,  and  (iv)  PR  is  a  drain  on  the  government  budget  at \nabout  Rs20  billion  (about  $340  million)  per  annum.  Although  PR  has  streamlined  staffing \nrequirements,  it  currently  employs  95,000  staff,  which  is  high  in  relation  to  traffic  levels.  The \ngeneral  explanation  of  this  decline  is  that  PR  has  not  been  able  to  adapt  to  the  increasing \ndemand for door-to-door services, emergence of competition from improved road transport, and \nmodern logistics. Railways in other countries have had similar experiences. \n \n13. \nThe Government believes that railways have the potential to provide the most economic \nmode of transport for a larger share of traffic. Average haul distances in Pakistan are large, and \nthe  competitiveness  of  rail  compared  with  road  increases  with  haul  distance.  There  is  also \npotential for railways to contribute to Pakistan becoming a regional transport hub providing port \nconnections for its neighboring countries to the north and west, including Afghanistan and Iran. \nThe Government now wishes to take steps to reverse the decline of railways and realize their \neconomic potential. It recognizes that this will require sustained institutional and policy reforms \ntogether with investment in rehabilitation and upgrading of facilities. \n \nIn 2000, the Railways Board was restructured, an executive committee was established, \n14. \nand  efforts  were  made  to  give  more  responsibility  to  managers  of  the  main  lines  of  business. \nThe  executive  committee  has  been  granted  authority  for  raising  tariffs  without  need  to  seek \nhigher approval. There is scope for tariff rebalancing to enhance commercial performance.2  A \nfinancial  advisory  team  was  hired  to  suggest  measures  for  modernizing  PR's  financial \nmanagement  and  for  valuing  its  assets.  This  work  included  valuation  of  assets  and  liabilities, \npreparation of IAS compliant accounts and audit, and preparation of a business plan including \nfinancial projections for future scenarios. The business-as-usual scenario suggested an annual \ndeficit  of  Rs20  billion.  The  reform  and  investment  scenario  suggested  that,  following \ncorporatization  and  financial  restructuring,  MOR  could  eventually  become  financially  self-\nsufficient.  A  private  sector  marketing  team  was  recruited  to  initiate  commercial  exploitation  of \nPR's  land  assets  (so  far  this  raised  about  Rs1  billion).  PR's  traffic  forecasts  envisage  that \ninvestment  in  asset  renewal  and  improvement  will  attract  a  large  amount  of  additional  traffic, \nincluding a near trebling of freight over the next 7 years. With a view to supporting private sector \nparticipation  in  railways,  an  ordinance  was  approved  in  2002  for  establishing  a  rail  regulatory \nauthority,  although  this  is  not  yet  operational.  The  Minister  of  Finance  announced  in  his  most \n\n                                                 \n2   There is scope for tariff rebalancing to enhance commercial performance. Average revenues per ton km are three \n\ntimes average revenues per passenger km. \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n3. \n\nPorts             \n\nrecent budget speech that the Government has decided to corporatize PR. Drawing on the work \nof the financial advisory team, MOR has prepared a draft corporatization plan for core railway \nactivities,  and  its  manufacturing  units  may  be  converted  into  independent  entities.  The  draft \nRailways Act intending to corporatize PR is currently being discussed. \n \nADB has not previously supported railways in Pakistan. In early 2004, the Government \n15. \nasked ADB to consider including support for railways in its Country Strategy and Program (CSP) \nfor Pakistan. ADB is currently conducting a preliminary assessment of the railways sector and \nidentified  areas  of  technical  assistance  through  the  TA  loan,  with  a  view  to  developing  a \nframework  or  \"roadmap\"  for  future  improvement  of  the  railway  sector.  However,  ADB  would \nwish  to  see  certain  advance  actions  and  commitments  being  met  prior  to  approval  of  any \npossible ADB support for infrastructure rehabilitation. Examples might include (i) establishing a \nreform implementation task force; (ii) approving the draft legislation for corporatization, and then \nenacting  the  legislation  and  operationalizing  the  corporation,  (iii)  preparing  an  overarching \nreform program for railways, and obtaining a high-level government commitment for it; and (iv) \nrecruiting  and  carrying  out  the  proposed  consulting  services  to  develop  and  implement  a  new \nactivity-based accounting system.3 If the assessment is positive, ADB might include support for \nrailways in the CSP and prepare a detailed timetable for formulation of support during 2005 and \n2006. \n \n \n \n16. \nPakistan has two operational ports: Karachi Port which is run by the Karachi Port Trust \n(KPT)  and  Qasim  Port  which  is  run  by  the  Port  Qasim  Authority  (PQA)  .  Both  these  ports  are \nlocated  in  Sindh  Province  of  Pakistan  and  are  less  than  70  km  apart.  In  addition  the \nGovernment  is  currently  developing  a  new  port  i.e.  Gwadar  Port  in  Baluchistan  Province.  It  is \nexpected  that  Gwadar  Port  will  be  operational  by  April  2005.  The  current  declared  depth  of \nKarachi and Qasim Ports are 11.5 meters (m). Gwadar Port currently has a declared depth of \n11.5  m.  In  2003,  the  total  cargo  throughput  at  Karachi  Port  was  26  million  tons  and  for  Port \nQasim  16  million  tons.  The  container  capacity  of  Karachi  Port  is  1.1  million  twenty-foot \nequivalent units (TEUs) and in 2003, it handled 710,000 TEUs. The capacity of Port Qasim is \n500,000 TEUs and in 2003, it handled 420,000 TEUs. Gwadar Port will have three berths in its \ninitial phase and the capacity is expected to be 54,000 TEUs. \n \n17. \nThe Government in 1990 embarked on a policy of implementing the landlord concept for \nports.  The  container  terminal  operations  at  both  Karachi  Port  and  Port  Qasim  have  been \nprivatized.  There  are  two  private  container  operators  at  Karachi  Port  i.e.  Karachi  International \nContainer  Terminal  (KICT)  and  Pakistan  International  Container  Terminal  (PICT)  while  in  Port \nQasim,  there  is  a  single  container  terminal  operator,  Qasim  International  Container  Terminal \n(QICT). The KPT has already invited applications for the leasing out of general cargo berths at \nKarachi Port.  Once the successful bidder is selected, 90% of the terminal operations at Karachi \nPort will be handled by the private sector. The Government is planning to lease out the terminal \noperations at Gwadar Port as well and is currently holding preliminary discussions with potential \nterminal operators. \n \n\n                                                 \n3   Establishment  of  a  modern  activity-based  accounting  system  is  recognized  as  an  essential  requirement  for \nenabling  a  corporatized  railway  to  operate  on  a  commercial  basis,  and  to  provide  a  reliable  method  for \nreestablishing a reliable system of public service obligations. \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n33\n\nPakistan  ports  are  still  expensive  and  inefficient  by  commonly  accepted  international \n18. \nstandards.4 However, the efficiency of ports\u2019 terminal operations has increased tremendously in \nrecent years. Average turnaround of container ships in Karachi Ports was reduced from 7 days \nto 16 hours. Labor force of Karachi Port has been reduced by 5,000 and KPT intends to reduce \nthis further by another 3,000 through attrition. \n \n19. \nCustoms\u2019 House Karachi is responsible for the customs operations at both Karachi and \nQasim  Ports.  Computerization  of  customs  operations  was  introduced  in  1984.  Goods \ndeclaration  documents  can  be  submitted  online  by  importers.  The  Customs  has  also  setup \nservice  centers  equipped  with  computers  for  smaller  companies  and  customs  agents  who  do \nnot  have  their  own  computers  to  submit  goods  declaration  documents  online.  Customs  has \nintroduced  automated  clearance  procedures  (ACP)  for  189  large  and  multinational  companies \nas well as for government-linked companies so that their imports are not inspected at all except \nfor random post-importation audit. The ACP covers approximately 50% of imports. For the rest, \na  risk  profile  system  has  been  put  into  place  to  identify  which  containers  are  selected  for \nphysical  inspection.  From  1  July  2004,  the  Customs  is  open  24  hours  a  day  so  that \nconsigners/consignees are not limited to traditional office hours. So far there has not been much \nresponse  from  the  private  sector  to  this  initiative.  The  Customs  has  also  set  up  11 \nrecommendatory  committees  consisting  of  two  reputable  business  representatives  and  one \ncustoms  officer  on  each  committee  to  make  recommendations  in  cases  of  disputes  between \nimporters  and  the  Customs  on  classification  and  valuation  for  duty  purposes.  This  helps  to \nreduce the time lost in disputes, which would otherwise have to be referred to the Central Board \nof  Revenue  (CBR)  in  Islamabad.  Manifests  are  submitted  by  terminal  operators  directly  to \nCustoms, which inputs them into its computer system.  These manifests are then electronically \nsent to the KPT and PQA. However, because of computer hardware limitations, it is not possible \nto  link  the  KPT  and  customs  computer  systems  online  in  real-time.  Scanners  will  soon  be \ninstalled in both Karachi and Qasim ports to comply with Customs Security Initiative. \n \nADB  has  recently  initiated  policy  and  technical  discussions  with  the  Government  on \n20. \npossible  ADB  support  for  the  port  sector.  The  first  priority  is  a  comprehensive  port  sector \nprioritization plan that will prioritize investment for Karachi Port and Port Qasim considering the \neconomic  viability  and  national  interests.  This  is  because  plans  for  channel  dredging  suggest \nthat both ports are trying to change their role from feeder ports to attracting main line operators. \nIt  is  not  immediately  obvious  that  both  ports  would  simultaneously  be  successful  in  attracting \nmain line operators.  Thus, that investment in channel deepening at both ports is economically \nviable. Once analysis of the demand and potential of both ports is carried out, it would become \nclearer  which  investments  in  the  port  sector  would  be  economically  viable  and  serve  the \nnational interest. \n \n \n \n21. \nThe Government attaches high priority to the development of infrastructure as the prime \nengine  for  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  Strategic  investment  in  infrastructure  is \nnecessary for Pakistan to take advantage of the geopolitical situation in the region and benefit \nfrom regional opportunities for cooperation in trade and commerce. The Government will have \nto address four major challenges: (i) lack of an integrated national transport policy to guide the \ndevelopment of subsector policies, (ii) poor governance, (iii) weak public institutions, and (iv) the \nneed for targeted investment based on sound economic criteria. \n\nDevelopment of a Transport Sector Strategy \n\n4. \n\n                                                 \n4   Shippers  annually  pay  about  $310  million  extra  charges  that  are  passed  on  to  the  consumers.  (Source:  World \n\nBank. 2002. Pakistan: Transport Sector Assistance Strategy Note. Washington, DC: World Bank.) \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nThe  Government  made  several  attempts  in  the  past  to  articulate  a  comprehensive \n22. \ntransport  policy  that  encompasses  all  subsectors.  Under  a  transport  sector  development \ninitiative  (TSDI)  sponsored  by  the  World  Bank,5  major  stakeholder  consultation  involving  the \npublic and private sectors and civil society was undertaken through a series of workshops and \nfocal group discussions to elicit views on a transport development strategy. The findings of TSDI \nwere  shared  with  MOC  to  help  in  formulating  a  national  transport  policy.  The  TSDI \nrecommendations  included  (i)  development  of  an  enabling  policy  framework  that  incorporates \nthe perspectives of the three key stakeholders\u2014the Government both as service provider and \nregulator,  the  private  sector,  and  users;  (ii)  establishment  of  a  national  transport  policy  board; \n(iii)  creation  of  a  unified  Ministry  of  Transport  that  encompasses  all  subsectors;  (iv)  policy \nreforms and incentives to encourage the private sector; (v) development of human resources in \nthe  sector;  and  (vi)  enforcement  of  existing  legislation  on  safety  standards,  environment,  etc. \nThe National Transport Research Center (NTRC) under MOC was assigned the responsibility to \nuse the TSDI findings in developing a comprehensive transport policy. Due to lack of capacity, \nNTRC  was  unable  to  develop  a  draft  policy  document  acceptable  to  the  Government.  The \nquality of the drafts prepared by NTRC failed to meet the Government\u2019s approval. Accordingly, \nthe  Government  requested  ADB\u2019s  assistance  to  help  in  framing  a  national  transport  policy  for \nthe  country.  ADB  is  currently  providing  advisory  assistance  to  the  Government  for  the \npreparation of a national transport policy6 covering road, rail, air, shipping, and ports subsectors. \n \nB. \n \n\nTransport Sector Subprojects \n\n1. \n\nSubproject Selection \n\n \nThe subproject selection for the transport sector component was prepared, together with \n23. \nthe  subproject  selection  of  the  transport  sector  component,  by  the  Planning  Commission  and \nthe relevant line Ministries (MOC, MOR, Ministry of Local Government (MOLG), and MOPS) in \nclose coordination with the relevant subsector agencies, primarily NHA  and PR. It is expected \nthat the preparation of about four road projects will be covered under the TA loan, primarily the \nprojects included in the ADB lending program for 2005\u20132006, and the projects to be initiated in \n2007  and  2008.  The  TA  loan  may  also  cover  the  preparation  of  a  railway  project,  subject  to \nagreement between ADB and the Government on the development of a reform program for the \nsector. Subject to government request, the TA loan may also accommodate non-ADB projects \nthat  are  consistent  with  the  government  development  plan,  economically  viable,  and \nenvironmentally and socially sustainable. \n \n\n2. \n\nSubproject  and  Package  Selection  for  Project  Preparatory  Facility  (Roads \nand Railways)        \n\n \n24. \nThe subproject selection for the transport sector component was prepared together with \nthe  Planning  Commission  and  the  relevant  line  Ministries  (MOC,  MOR,  and  MOPS),  in  close \ncoordination with the relevant subsector agencies, primarily NHA and PR. It is expected that the \npreparation of about four road projects will be covered under the TA loan, primarily the projects \nincluded in the ADB lending program for 2005-2006, and the projects to be initiated in 2007 and \n2008.  The  TA  loan  may  also  cover  the  preparation  of  a  railway  project,  subject  to  agreement \nbetween  ADB  and  the  Government  on  the  development  of  a  reform  program  for  the  sector. \n\n                                                 \n5   From June 1999 to March 2000.

Until  the  1990s, \n1. \nexpansion  of  water  supply  for  irrigation,  first  from  surface  water  until  the  1970s,  then  from \ngroundwater through the mid-1990s, was a key engine of agriculture sector growth. Investment \nin water resources and irrigation infrastructure has declined steadily since the 1980s. Since that \ntime, it has been limited to a few projects and piecemeal rehabilitation that has failed to halt the \nsteady deterioration of the substantial asset base caused by the lack of resources for operations \nand maintenance, and ineffective institutional arrangements and governance. The recent severe \ndrought  that  lasted  from  1999  to  2001  and  reduced  water  supplies  by  up  to  50%  helped \ngalvanize  the  Government\u2019s  focus  on  the  sector  and  on  the  need  for  greatly  increased \ninvestment. \n \n2. \nThe  response  of  the  federal  and  provincial  departments  and  agencies  has  been  (i)  to \npropose  a  huge  portfolio  of  projects  to  develop,  over  the  medium  to  long  run,  new  storage \nreservoirs and canals; and (ii) during the short run, to rehabilitate and line the canal distribution \nsystem, including the vital but aging barrages. In addition, the provinces have identified quick-\ngestation  investments  that  would  benefit  water-deficit  areas,  such  as  small  dams  and  spate \nirrigation  systems.  However,  the  combination  of  rising  water  demand  in  agriculture  and  other \nsectors, high population growth, and persistent rural poverty have brought into sharp focus the \nlong-term  scarcity  and  limits  to  water  resources  development  in  Pakistan,  and  to  the  growing \nrealization that the traditional supply-driven approach may no longer be appropriate to achieve \nthe  needed  high  economic  growth  rates.  Long-term  incremental  needs  for  additional  water \nresources in all sectors, including environmental flows in the lower Indus River, are greater than \nthe available incremental supply of water from all sources regardless of how much new storage \nis built. Hence, in the future, water infrastructure investment will have to be accompanied by a \ngreater and more balanced focus on increased efficiency, demand management, and improved \nproductivity that will require significant institutional and policy reforms. \n \n3. \nIn  March  2004,  the  Government  proposed  a  PRs883  billion  ($14.8  billion)  long-run \nprogram of investment1 in new dams and canals to be implemented over the next 10 years, and \nin  more  immediate  system  improvement  and  drainage.  However,  investment  in  the  water \nresources  sector  in  Pakistan  has  been  and  continues  to  be  problematic.  The  Public  Sector \nDevelopment  Plan  (PSDP\u2014FY  03-04)  for  water  resources  and  agriculture  is  about  PRs15 \nbillion  and  the  carry  forward  to  finance  completion  of  ongoing  and  recently  started  projects  at \nthe end of the FY04 financial year will be about PRs350 billion. The FY 04 PSDP budget was a \n36% increase over the FY 03 PSDP, but at that level of funding over the next 5 years, the total \ninvestment of about PRs72.5 billion would be over PRs270 billion short of the funding needed to \ncomplete the projects being carried forward. Failure to complete projects in the PSDP has been \na  persistent  problem  caused  not  only  by  a  long  period  of  fiscal  stringency,  but  also  by  over-\ncommitment  to  too  many  projects  and  to  long  gestation  projects.  Achieving  much  higher \neconomic  growth  targets  on  the  order  of  8%  or  more  will  require  greater  attention  to  project \ncompletion  during  the  plan  period,  as  well  as  to  quicker-gestation  investments  that  yield  early \nreturns.   \n\n                                                 \n1   This contrasts with a figure of $7.7 billion for investments recommended for the Medium Term Investment Plan \nunder  ADB.  1998.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Water  Resources  Strategy \nStudy. Manila. The Government\u2019s proposal included a number of very large projects that were not recommended \nfor medium-term consideration by the TA and the subsequent Water Sector Strategy (see para. 5). \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n4. \nTo achieve greater development impact from infrastructure investment, there will need to \nbe greater clarity of objectives with a more coherent strategy that addresses the challenges of \nthe  future.  This  will  require  a  more  integrated  approach  and  greater  emphasis  on  introducing \nnew thinking about how inefficient water use could be reduced, in addition to simply looking at \nlarge  storage  projects.  To  help  meet  the  Government\u2019s  macroeconomic  growth  objectives,  an \nanalytical  and  institutional  framework  is  needed  for  setting  investment  priorities  and  reshaping \nthe  water  infrastructure  portfolio.  Achieving  this  will  require  capacity  development  along  with \nrestructuring of the institutional arrangements for water resources management. \n \n5. \nReforms in the Sector. Recognizing the need for change, the Government has initiated \nactions intended to stimulate reform in the water sector. In October 2004, the Ministry of Water \nand  Power  (MOWP)  endorsed  the  draft  National  Water  Policy  (NWP)  that  is  anticipated  for \napproval by the full Cabinet in the second quarter 2005. Moving forward on the new NWP was a \nkey  recommendation  of  the  ADB-supported  Water  Sector  Strategy  (WSS)  study  completed  in \nOctober  2003.2  Both  the  WSS  and  the  draft  NWP  will  require  restructuring  of  institutional \narrangements at the federal level to improve water resources management and sector strategic \nplanning  and  policy  analysis.  Both  the  WSS  and  draft  NWP  call  for  development  of  an  apex \nbody  for  water  resources  management  that  would  require  significant  capacity  development.3 \nThe apex body would carry out expanded and improved strategic planning and policy analysis \nand help forge a consensus on a water sector strategy and master plan. The apex body would \nalso  develop  a  framework  and  common  metrics  for  project  assessment  to  ensure  that \ninfrastructure  investment  achieves  maximum  developmental  impact.  Development  of  the  apex \nbody and the capacity to ensure its effectiveness are key objectives of the Government and are \nnecessary to improve infrastructure investment within the water resources sector.  \n \n6. \nThe Indus River System Authority (IRSA). IRSA was established in 1992 by an act of \nParliament  to  implement  the  1991  Inter-provincial  Water  Accord.  The  Act  established  the  five \nmember IRSA Board with one member from each Province and one appointed by the Federal \nGovernment.  The  statutory  powers  and  duties  of  IRSA  include,  among  others,  (i)  establishing \nthe basis for regulation and distribution of Indus waters among the provinces according to the \nallocations  spelled  out  in  the  Water  Accord,  (ii)  reviewing  and  specifying  reservoir  operation \npatterns,  (iii)  exchanging  data  among  the  provinces,  and  (iv)  issuing  consolidated  operational \ndirectives  to  the  Water  and  Power  Development  Authority  (WAPDA)  for  making  releases  from \nreservoirs. IRSA has the potential to be the regulator that would be necessary to administer a \nsystem  of  secure,  exchangeable  water  rights  under  which  Indus  waters  are  apportioned \nseasonally,  but  neither  the  Government  nor  the  Provinces  has  supported  the  development  of \nthe  required  technical  capacity  within  IRSA,  full  exercise  of  the  power  assigned  to  IRSA  in \ncurrent legislation, or the necessary changes in legislation. IRSA and WAPDA have jointly been \nimplementing a project to install telemetry  monitoring devices at 21 control points in the Indus \nwater distribution system that would enable nearly real time data on flows and gate positions to \nbe  known  everywhere  in  the  system  by  all  stakeholders.  However,  although  the  system  is \ninstalled, there have been long delays in completing calibration and verification, and in working \nout  the  flow  of  data,  creating  the  risk  of  loss  of  confidence  and  opposition  to  its  use.  To  help \nimprove management of the major water resources in Pakistan, it is important to strengthen and \nmodernize IRSA\u2019s capacity to play a stronger role in managing Indus waters. In addition to IRSA \n\n                                                 \n2   Under  ADB.  1998. Technical  Assistance  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Water  Resources  Strategy \n\n3   Alternately,  MOWP  has  suggested  that  a  new  policy  cell  be  established  within  the  Ministry  that  would  serve  a \n\nStudy. Manila.  \n\nsimilar role as the Apex Body. \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n41\n\ncapacity,  overall  data  collection  and  management  capability  and  technical  options  need  to  be \nreviewed,  and  management  information  systems  put  in  place  to  support  effective  decision \nmaking for water management and investment planning. \n \nKey  Issues  in  the  Water  Resources  Sector.  The  ADB-supported  WSS  and  a  more \n7. \nrecent  World  Bank  sector  review4  provide  considerable  analysis  of  the  challenges  and  issues \nPakistan  must  address  in  the  future.  Pakistan  diverts  an  average  of  103.8  million  acre-feet  of \nIndus  River  Basin  flows  (about  72%  of  the  mean  annual  flow)  through  16  barrages  into  37 \ncanals5  to  irrigate  about  36  million  acres.  The  system  has  only  about  12.8  million  acre-feet  of \nstorage, just about 12% of current use. Nevertheless, this storage is crucial because it provides \n89% of the existing hydropower capacity, as well as the capacity for carry over of water from the \nhigh-flow  summer  season  to  the  arid,  low-flow  winter  season,  enabling  a  major  increase  in \nannual cropping intensity. \n \n8. \nThe  Indus  River  Basin  is  a  major,  complex  hydrologic  system  that  must  be  carefully \nmanaged, yet responsibility for managing the infrastructure is divided between the Federal and \nProvincial  Governments.  Water  distribution  to  farmers  and  other  users  has  always  been  a \nprovincial responsibility in Pakistan, while interprovincial water management, including reservoir \noperation, has been a Federal responsibility. Major capital works such as new major dams and \ncanals are normally built by the Federal Government, but operated by the provinces.  They are \nan integral part of the provincial water distribution system. The management challenges at the \nbasin or federal level include the following: \n \n\nManaging water resources in the upper basin, or \u201cmountain tops\u201d, which involves \nbetter  management  of  the  supply  in  terms  of  both  increased  storage,  reservoir \noperations,  and  monitoring  the  upper  basin  hydrology  to  improve  both  the \npredictability of supplies and the management of reservoirs; and \n\nManaging  the  allocation  and  diversion  of  water  from  the  Indus  River  and \nreservoir systems to each of the canal heads and in the lower Indus River below \nKotri  Barrage  to  improve  the  transparency  and  reliability  of  supply,  and  avoid \neconomic losses and environmental damages. \n\n \n9. \nThe Provincial Governments are responsible for managing the water and infrastructure \nfrom the head gates where diversion takes place to the minor canal outlet that provides water to \nthe  farmer-owned  watercourses  and  field  channels.  The  management  challenges  at  this  level \ninclude  (i)  managing  the  performance  of  the  canal  network  and  the  reliability  of  bulk  water \ndeliveries  to  the  distributary  and  minor  canal  commands,  (ii)  monitoring  and  managing \ngroundwater  recharge  and  use,  and  (iii)  managing  drainage  effluents.  Issues  of  equity, \nefficiency and productivity become dominant within the distributary and minor canals, and within \nthe watercourse network below the outlet. \n \n10. \nThe  following  challenges  have  also  been  observed  with  regard  to  water  resources \nmanagement. Irrigation considerations are vital in looking at water resources management since \nirrigation  uses  95%  of  Pakistan's  developed  water  supply.  Water  management  with  regard  to \n\n                                                 \n4   World  Bank.  2004.  Pakistan  Public  Expenditure  Review,  Volume  II,  Accelerating  Development  of  Water \n\nResources and Irrigated Agriculture. World Bank Report No. 25665-PK. Washington, DC: World Bank. \n\n5   Water is also diverted into 12 link canals, which connect the western and eastern rivers in the basin.  These link \ncanals were built as key elements of the Indus Replacement Works agreed as a part of the Indus Basin Treaty \nwith India. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nirrigation  is  also  critical  since  irrigated  agriculture  (i)  contributes  25%  to  Pakistan\u2019s  gross \ndomestic  product,  (ii)  employs  over  50%  of  the  rural  labor  force,  and  (iii)  directly  or  indirectly \nprovides 60\u201370% of exports. Improving agricultural productivity is also vital to poverty reduction. \nThe challenges facing the irrigation sector include the following. \n \n\nThe  surface  water  system  is  seriously  aging.    Some  infrastructure  is  over  100 \nyears  old,  and  deferred  maintenance  has  rendered  the  vital  distribution  system  \nbadly in need of modernization, replacement, and rehabilitation. \n\nSoil  salinity,  sodicity,  and  waterlogging  persists,  with  the  serious  risks  of \nstagnating growth and that production will become unsustainable. \n\n \n(iii)  Water  distribution  is  inefficient,  unreliable,  and  inequitable,  and  operations  and \n\nmaintenance have suffered from low budgets and low cost recovery. \n\nThere  is  low  accountability  for  service,  little  transparency,  and  excessive \ncentralization. \n\nlack  of  participation  and  empowerment  of \n\nThe \ntheir \nunderstanding  of  their  rights  and  involvement  in  effective  water  control,  has \nresulted  in  little  incentive  to  conserve  water,  pay  water  charges,  or  respond  to \npolicy incentives or new technology opportunities that could increase productivity. \n\nincluding \n\nfarmers, \n\nAt the basin and federal levels, the water management challenges are strategic and no \n\n \n11. \nless daunting: \n \n\n(i) \n\nDemand for water is rising as new area is added to canal commands, population \ngrows, rural poverty persists, and farmer\u2019s profits are squeezed. \n\n \n(ii)  Water supply is vulnerable to the high variability of Indus River flow and drought.  \n\nOnly about 12% of supply comes from storage.  \n\nThere  is  little  or  no  additional  groundwater  to  develop,  and  there  is  no \nmechanism in place to manage groundwater. \n\nDepletion of storage capacity by sediment is resulting in slowly diminishing winter \nwater supply and energy production. \n\nBoth surface and groundwater quality is seriously degraded. \n\nPakistan is fast approaching the limits of its surface and groundwater resources, \nand it will be difficult to meet water demands across all sectors in the future. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n \n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\nThe  consensus  on  water  and  its  development  that  existed  in  the  1960s  has \ndeteriorated  into  conflict,  especially  at  the  provincial  level,  and  threatens \nprogress in addressing needs in the sector. \n\n \n12. \nThe Way Forward. If the Government is poised to increase public investment in water \nresources and irrigation by 200\u2013500% over the next 5 years as it has indicated, it must at the \nsame time give equal urgency and meticulous attention to institutional, governance, and policy \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n43\n\nUses of the TA Loan \n\nissues. In doing so, it should address the key institutional and policy issues at both the federal \nand provincial levels. \n \n13. \nAt the federal level, the Government must address the lack of capacity and institutional \nfocus on strategic planning and policy analysis. The Government needs to create a critical mass \nof technical talent and skills to take responsibility for (i) addressing the strategic questions and \nchallenges, including the development of a modern, shared information system; (ii) developing \nnew analytical models and tools such as GIS and remote sensing; (iii) enhancing the knowledge \nbase;  and  (iv)  providing  planning  support  and  assistance  to  the  provinces  that  enable \naccelerated investment in the modernization of their distribution systems. \n \n14. \nAt the provincial level, if more rapid, equitable, and sustained growth is to be achieved, \nthen investments in the modernization, rehabilitation, and expansion of water infrastructure must \ndeliver  more  reliable  water  service  to  villages,  towns,  and  cities,  and  to  farmers,  who  in  turn \nmust be empowered to manage their canals and their water entitlement in ways that encourage \nand  allow  them  to  use  water  most  productively.  To  do  this,  more  accountability  and \ntransparency  have  to  be  introduced  into  the  institutional  arrangements  for  irrigation  water \nmanagement, and farmers have to be brought into the process meaningfully. \n \nB. \n \n15. \nSelection  of  Subprojects.  The  primary  activity  under  the  water  resources  sector \ncomponent is implementation of the TAP, which represents the outcome of the ADB-supported \nWSS,  the  draft  NWP,  and  TA  4435-PAK.  The  Government  requested  the  TA  loan  to  support \nimplementation of the TAP, indicating the commitment to capacity development and reforms. \n \n16. \nFor programs and subprojects submitted for funding by provincial agencies, priority will \nbe  given  to  activities  that  support  institutional  reform  and  improved  water  resources \nmanagement,  as  reflected  in  the  WSS  and  the  ADB  water  sector  roadmap,  such  as \ngroundwater  management,  regulation,  and \nimplementation  plans,  along  with  capacity \ndevelopment.  Activities  at  the  provincial  level  that  can  be  linked  to  the  TAP  will  also  be  given \npriority.  Provincial  governments  also  submitted  requests  to  support  feasibility  studies  for  quick \ngestation  infrastructure  subprojects  such  as  spate  irrigation  systems  and  small  storage \nstructures that supply water to communities currently without adequate access to water. All the \nindicative subprojects were identified as a part of the provincial planning process, involving the \ndepartments  of  irrigation  and  power,  planning  and  development,  and  finance.  Subprojects \nresulting from feasibility studies supported by the TA loan would have to be within the capacity \nof provincial agencies to implement and manage themselves. \n \n17. \nOvercoming  Institutional  Constraints  in  the  Water  Sector.  The  primary  task  of  the \nTA  loan  is  to  build  capacity  and  strengthen  institutions  for  water  resources  planning, \ndevelopment,  and  management  within  the  concerned  federal  and  provincial  agencies.  It  is \nthrough this capacity building that these agencies will, over the medium term,  most effectively \ninitiate the preparation and implementation of major dams and other large water infrastructure. \nThe  TA  loan  will  support  implementation  of  a  technical  assistance  program  (TAP)  that  was \ninitially recommended under the WSS and is now being designed in detail at the request of the \nGovernment under ADB TA.6 The TAP will receive $4 million of the TA loan proceeds.  \n \n\n                                                 \n6   ADB.  2004.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Water  Sector  Irrigation \n\nDevelopment. Manila. \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nTA  4435-PAK  is  supporting  MOWP  to  prepare  the  TAP,  including  its  detailed  resource \n18. \nrequirements, in order to strengthen the institutional and legal framework in the water resources \nsector,  and  build  new  capacity  for  strategic  planning  and  policy  analysis  for  overall  water \nresources management. The TAP will build professional capacity and skills at both the federal \nand  provincial  levels,  and  across  all  stakeholder  agencies,  focusing  in  particular  on  the \nimplementation  of  the  draft  National  Water  Policy  and  providing  assistance  to  implement  it  as \nwell as strengthening new institutional arrangement and a technical secretariat to support it, by \nassisting the Government with the following activities inter alia: (i) recruiting staff and providing \ntraining  for  improved  institutional  arrangements  to  support  the  draft  National  Water  Policy;  (ii) \nproviding  national,  regional,  and  international  training  opportunities;  (iii)  providing  short-  and \nlong-term national and international consultants as required; (iv) providing funds for the unit to \noutsource special studies and related activities enabling it to tap into centers of excellence and \nexpertise in the public and private sectors in Pakistan; and (v) providing funds to establish and \nequip a technical secretariat and its associated data and decision support systems, and to make \nit  fully  functional.  Capacity  development  under  the  TAP  will  also  support  enhancement  of \nPakistan decision support systems for water resources management. This will include review of \nexisting decision support systems such as IRSA\u2019s flow data telemetry system, other hydrological \nand  hydrogeological  monitoring  systems,  as  well  as  metrological  monitoring  capacity. \nRecommendations  to  improve  management  of  and  technically  upgrade  decision  support \nsystems  for  water  resources  management  at  the  federal  and  provincial  levels  will  also  be \naddressed under the TAP. \n   \n19. \nThe  TA  loan  will  support  the  following  activities  inter  alia:  (i)  assisting  the  Government \nwith recruiting staff and providing training for technical support to help implement the draft NWP \nand  WSS  and  to  strengthen  overall  water  resources  management  activities;  (ii)  providing \nnational, regional, and international training opportunities for agencies such as the MOWP, PC, \nand  Ministry  of  the  Environment;  (iii)  providing  short-  and  long-term  national  and  international \nconsultants as required; (iv) providing funds for the unit to outsource special studies and related \nactivities for improved water resources management and investment planning and development \nthrough centers of excellence and expertise in the public and private sectors in Pakistan; and (v) \nproviding  funds  to  establish  and  equip  the  institutional  arrangement  to  support  the  Water \nResources  Council,  draft  NWP,  and  WSS  and  needed  associated  data  and  decision  support \nsystems,  and  to  provided  needed  technical  and  human  resources  to  strengthen  institutions  to \nmake them fully effective. \n \n20. \nPreparation  of  Irrigation  Sector  Subprojects.  Although  they  will  be  a  critical  part  of \nPakistan\u2019s  medium-  and  longer-run  water  resources  development,  large  dams  and  major, \nfederally  executed  water  projects,  as  well  as  large-scale  canal  rehabilitation  programs  at  the \nprovincial  level,  will  not  be  prepared  under  the  TA  loan.7  Rather,  the  TA  loan  will  prepare \nquicker-gestation and relatively small-scale subprojects that can be implemented and managed \nentirely  at  the  provincial  level.  TA  loan  funds  amounting  to  $2  million  will  be  split  among  the \ndifferent provincial agencies, with $500,000 earmarked for each province, to be used for project \npreparation. The following indicative list of projects was provided by the provinces when the TA \nloan was prepared: Balochistan \u2013 (i) spate irrigation development studies; (ii) feasibility studies \nfor small dams; and (iii) development of a groundwater management institutional framework and \nimplementation strategy; Punjab \u2013 (iv) feasibility studies for small dams including an agricultural \ndevelopment  component  and  (v)  possible  transbasin  diversions  or  improved  interlinking  of  the \n\n                                                 \n7   Proposed projects for canal and irrigation rehabilitation at the provincial level will be prepared under ADB grant-\nfinanced project preparatory TAs covering Punjab (2005) and Sindh (2006). Hence, these investments will not be \ncovered under the TA loan. \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n45\n\nframework  and \n\nimplementation  strategy \n\nCosts and Financing Plan \n\nexisting  canal  system;  Sindh  \u2013  (vi)  development  of  a  strategy  and  long-term  plan  to  prioritize \ninvestments as well as identify capacity needs and requirements for institutional reforms in the \nwater sector; (vii) capacity development for farmer organizations to manage irrigation systems; \nand (viii) technical studies for management of groundwater; North-West Frontier Province \u2013 (ix) \nfor  groundwater \ndevelopment  of  a  regulatory \nmanagement; and (x) feasibility studies for spate irrigation and small dams. \n \nC. \n \n21. \nThe total cost of the water sector component has been estimated at $8.00 million, with \nthe  foreign  exchange  costs  and  local  currency  costs  estimated  at  $4.24  million  and  $3.76 \nmillion,  respectively.

The Government of Pakistan (the Government) has undertaken significant \nactivities  to  support  and  promote  infrastructure  investment.  In  March  2005,  the  Planning \nCommission (PC) released its Medium Term Development Framework (MTDF) for public review \nwith  approval  expected  in  June  2005.  The  MTDF  provides  development  objectives  and  a \nstrategic  framework  for  Pakistan  from  2005  to  2010,  and  it  addresses  infrastructure  needs  for \nthose  sectors  to  be  addressed  by  the  ADB  Technical  Assistance  Loan  for  Infrastructure \nDevelopment (the Project); i.e. power, transport; and water resources and irrigation. The MTDF \nwill provide the foundation for the Project through its focus and elaboration on (i) infrastructure \nneeds  for  the  relevant  sectors;  (ii)  legal  and  regulatory  issues;  (iii)  public  private  partnerships; \nand (iv) macroeconomic considerations. \n \nAlthough  the  Government  has  made  substantial  progress  in  defining  needs  and \n2. \ndeveloping  a  plan  for  sector  investments  in  power,  transportation,  and  water  resources,  the \nenabling  environment  for  infrastructure  investments  for  the  private  sector,  multilateral  and \nbilateral  development  agencies  needs  strengthening.  Some  of \nfacing \ninfrastructure investment by nonpublic agencies include investor protection, sector and investor \nlegal  and  regulatory  fairness  and  consistency,  property  rights,  transparency  of  sector  policy \nframeworks,  strategic  direction  and  sector  development,  overly  bureaucratic  regulations  and \nprocedures, monetary stability and exchange regulations, and efficient contract enforcement. To \nhelp  address  these  investment  constraints  faced  by  private  sector  and  external  development \nassistant, \ninfrastructure \ninvestments, for $1 million to help eliminate infrastructure investment constraints and ameliorate \nthe  overall  investment  climate  for  energy,  transport,  and  water  resources  infrastructure. \nHowever, assistance is needed to most effectively develop and implement a program to improve \nthe enabling environment for infrastructure investments. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nObjective. The objective of the small-scale technical assistance (the TA) to support the \nProject is to assist identification and implementation of interventions to strengthen the enabling \nenvironment  for  infrastructure  investment  by  nonpublic  entities.  The  TA  will  have  three \ncomponents: (i) investigation and diagnostic work for constraints to infrastructure investment; (ii) \ndevelopment of subproject using the $1 million in funds from enabling environment component \nto  address  constraints  identified;  and  (iii)  assistance  in  implementation  of  subprojects  and \ndissemination of their results. \n \n4. \nDiagnosis.  The  identification  and  diagnosis  of  constraints  to  investment  will  involve \nreview  of  literature  and  current  government  policies  and  procedures.  This  would  draw  upon \nprevious  work  studies  by  ADB  and  other  foreign  and  domestic  institutions.  Diagnostic  work \nwould also include formal and informal discussions with investment stakeholders to solicit their \nviews. The goal of this TA component is to identify gaps in addressing infrastructure investment \nconstraints  and  develop  a  prioritized  list  of  constraints  to  be  addressed.  The  types  of \ninterventions to be identified would include such activities as policy and legal reforms, improved \naccess to information, sector-specific studies, and capacity development activities. \n \n\nincludes  a  component,  enabling  environment \n\nScope \n\nfor \n\n\fAppendix  10 \n\n53\n\nDevelopment  of  Interventions.  The  specific  interventions  to  be  developed  under  the \n5. \nTA will focus on finding ways to resolve the constraints identified during the diagnostic phase.  \nThe interventions will be prioritized, but most likely several of the interventions will be executed \non  a  parallel  basis.    The  TA  will  develop  TOR  and  implementation  arrangements  for  the \nprioritized list of interventions. The $1 million in funds allocated to the enabling environment for \ninfrastructure  investments  component  will  be  used  to  support  the  interventions.  Wherever \npossible,  cofinancing  opportunities  will  be  sought  with  development  partners  and  other \ninterested  stakeholders  to  leverage  funds.  Interventions  will  be  developed  and  implemented \nuntil the $1 million in funds are exhausted. \n \n6. \nImplementation  of  Interventions.  The  TA  will  also  provide  management  oversight  to \nimplement  the  developed  interventions.  This  will  include  calls  for  expressions  of  interest; \nrecruitment  of  consultants;  project  management;  quality  control  over  outputs;  and  monitoring \nand evaluation. An important aspect of this activity will be the wide dissemination of results and \nsupport  to  ensure  that  intervention  outputs  results  in  a  meaningful  change  to  the  enabling \nenvironment  for  infrastructure  investments.  This  will  include  direct  dialog  with  relevant  federal \nand  provincial  government  ministries  and  agencies,  workshops,  and  distribution  of  position \npapers and publications. \n \nC. \n \n7. \nTwo domestic consultants will be recruited for 16 months each over a period of 2 years \nfor  a  total  of  32  person-months.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  Consultants  will  have  expertise  in  (i)  infrastructure \ninvestments; (ii) institutional reform; (iii) project management; and (iv) with ADB and government \nprocedures for recruitment and contracting of consultants.  \n \n8. \nIn terms of implementation arrangements, the Infrastructure Management Unit (IMU) of \nthe PC, which will be responsible for overall management of the Project, will also be responsible \nfor  the  implementation  of  the  TA.  Staff  from  the  IMU  will  be  assigned  to  and  support  the  TA \nconsultants, and other PC staff will be seconded on an ad hoc basis as needed to assist the TA \nconsultants. \n \n9. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $190,000  equivalent,  comprising  $5,000  in \nforeign  exchange  and  $185,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  ADB  will  finance  $150,000 \nequivalent  on  a  grant  basis  from  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program  to  cover  the  entire  foreign \nexchange and $145,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government will finance the \nremaining local currency cost amounting to $40,000 for (i) office accommodation and utilities; (ii) \ncounterpart staff support; and (iii) workshop facilitation as needed. \n\nExpertise, Implementation Arrangements, Cost Estimates, and Financing Plan \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nItem \n\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($'000) \n \n\nForeign \nExchange \n \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n1.

Yes \n\n \n\n \n\nSector identified as a national priority in \ncountry poverty partnership agreement? Yes \n \n\nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan \nLimited  capacity  and  access  to,  as  well  as  poor  condition/ageing  of,  infrastructure  assets  and \nservices  are  among  the  main  constraints  preventing  poor  people  from  gaining  access  to \neconomic opportunities and good-quality services. An efficient infrastructure network consisting \nof  water  resources,  roads,  and  electricity  will  provide  raw  materials  for  increased  production, \nstronger  linkages  between  remote  and  poor  regions,  and  access  to  more  developed  markets. \nRemoval  of  the  physical  bottlenecks  in  infrastructure  sectors  and  improved  capabilities  within \ninfrastructure  institution  will  improve  the  overall  performance  of  infrastructure  services,  thereby \nalleviating these constraints and reducing poverty. \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\nB. \n \nThe technical assistance Loan (TA Loan) provides only a financing facility for the Government to \nundertake  institutional  capacity  building  within  the  infrastructure  institutions  in  Pakistan  and \nprepare  feasibility  studies  and  detailed  design  for  follow-on  infrastructure  projects.  The  poverty \nanalysis will be conducted by using the TA Loan for the follow-on projects, even if these projects \nare not be financed by ADB. \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\nParticipation Process \n\nC. \n \nStakeholder analysis? Yes. The policy and institutional reform program in the road sector was \ndeveloped on the stakeholder analysis prepared under a technical assistance.1  \n \nParticipation  strategy?  Yes.  The  reform  program  was  developed  through  stakeholder \nparticipation,  including  government  agencies  to  be  reformed,  private  sector,  chamber  of \ncommerce,  civil  society,  contractors  association,  engineers  association,  and  labor  unions. \nSelection of the roads to be improved was based on social requirements, road conditions, and \neconomic importance. Community consultations were carried out to determine selection priority, \nincluding  engineering  solutions  to  exclude  all  resettlement  impacts.  Based  on  technical \nrequirements,  opportunities  for  local  communities  to  work  on  the  civil  works,  particularly \nearthworks, will be incorporated. \n\nD.
