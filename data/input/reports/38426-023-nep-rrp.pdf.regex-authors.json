I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, (ii) a proposed grant, and (iii) proposed administration of a loan to be provided by the \nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Fund for International Development \n(OFID) to Nepal for additional financing of the Decentralized Rural Infrastructure and Livelihood \nProject.1 \n \n2.  The additional financing is for the current project, which is performing well. The focus is \non  improving  rural  transport  connectivity  and  community  infrastructure,  and  uplifting  the \nlivelihood of rural communities in 18 poor and remote hill and mountain districts of Nepal.2  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Nepal is a landlocked country situated between the People\u2019s Republic of China in the \nnorth and India in the south, east, and west. The road networks are the major modes of \ntransportation in the country because of its widespread mountainous terrain and difficult weather \nconditions. Pervasive poverty in the hill and mountain districts is linked to the lack of road \nconnectivity and corresponding high transport costs, which discourage the mobility of people, \nand  movement  of  goods  and  services  within  and  outside  the  regions.  The  majority  of \nsettlements in hilly and mountainous areas are not accessible by motorized vehicles; they are \ncut off from the road network, and thus face constraints of limited access to food supplies, \nhealth and education facilities, and other essential services. In these areas, rural transport is \nlargely based on a trail system of foot trails, mule tracks, and trail bridges. \n \n4.  Since  1985,  the  Government  of  Nepal  has  made  considerable  progress  in  linking \nimportant  geographical  areas  of  Nepal  by  road  infrastructure,  aided  by  suitable  policies, \nlegislative enactments, and guidelines. Nepal\u2019s road network increased by 6.7% a year from \n1995 to 2004, with rural roads growing by 11% a year. Despite this improvement, the rural \ntransport infrastructure in the country remains underdeveloped. Only 17% of the rural population \nhas access to an all-weather road, compared with 60% in India and 37% in Bangladesh. Road \ndensity is only 121 as against 1,838 in Bangladesh and 1,116 in India.3 Road density remains \nvery low in remote districts in the hills and mountain regions. \n  \n5.  In the 18 poor and remote hill and mountain districts4 of Nepal where the overall project \nwill focus, poverty incidence was about 41% in 2004,5 which is significantly higher than the \nnational level of 30%. This difference is inextricably linked to the lack of accessibility for the rural \npopulation in the districts. The more distant the districts are from the center, and the more \nmountainous,  the  less  access  people  have  to  social  services,  markets,  and  ultimately \nopportunities to enhance their economic activities and livelihoods. The scope for developing \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2004.

", "2 \nrural transport infrastructure such as roads, tracks, trail bridges, and ropeways is immense, and \nit requires a major investment in the medium to longer term. Non-transport constraints are also \npart of the broad accessibility\u2013poverty nexus. These include (i) the lack of social and market \nfacilities,  (ii)  the  lack  of  integrated  accessibility  planning,  and  (iii)  low  income  and  cash \navailability. The situation is aggravated by the persistence of strong inequalities between castes \nand ethnic groups. \n \n6.  In Nepal, the road maintenance program\u2014including planning and implementation\u2014is \ndecentralized at the district level, with the involvement of the road users. However, there are \nmany weaknesses in the approach to rural road maintenance: (i) periodic maintenance is given \npreference  over  routine  maintenance,  (ii)  over  50%  of  the  rural  roads  network  is  in  an \nunmaintainable condition, (iii) maintenance supervision is inadequate, (iv) maintenance budgets \n(covering  only  30%  of  needs)  are  inadequate,  and  (v)  maintenance  skills  and  material \nspecifications are poor. \n \n7.  Past and ongoing experiences in the rural roads sector in Nepal6 provide key lessons \nlearned that need to be addressed. These include the following: (i) district administrations lack a \nmaintenance  culture  and  have  limited  funding  to  undertake  road  maintenance; \n(ii) supplementary infrastructure is not aligned and well focused with the project accessibility \ncore objective; (iii) skills training are not always well focused and market-driven; (iv) transport \nservices are unreliable and expensive; (v) more works tend to be allocated to contractors than \nto communities; (vi) subproject planning, appraisal, and works procurement are too slow; (vii) \ndistricts have weak implementation capacity and a skills shortage; (viii) attention is lacking \nregarding the needs of poor and excluded7 groups including women, excluded ethnic groups, \nand victims of the past conflict; and (ix) access of the rural poor to microfinance is lacking. \n \n8.  The project is included in the country partnership strategy for 2010\u20132012 of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), which supports the country\u2019s peace and development aspirations by \npromoting broad-based and inclusive economic growth.8 The overall project will help strengthen \npeace building directly through improved access in remote districts, thereby improving access to \nhealth  and  education,  enhancing  opportunity  for  skills  and  employment  for  income,  and \nestablishing linkages within remote geographic locations.9 This can help in delivering long-\nanticipated public expectations in the form of peace dividends in the post- conflict environment \nin the country. The project is also aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, which advocates rural \ninfrastructure development. 10 \n \n9.  Despite  weaknesses  in  the  approach  to  the  rural  road  sector,  the  current  project, \napproved on 24 September 2004 continues to show good performance and implementation \nprogress has been satisfactory (or better) in regard to achievement of outcome and outputs, and \ncompliance with covenants. The current project design has demonstrated good resilience to the \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2004.

These \ncommunity infrastructures are functioning well and are likely to be sustainable because they are \ndemand-driven,  with  community  participation  in  operation  and  maintenance.  In  the  current \nproject impact zone, between 2007 and 2010, household income rose by 57% against the target \nof 25%, while road freight volume increased by 96% against the target of 100%.11 By 30 April \n2011, 381 kilometers (km) of roads were constructed or rehabilitated (70% of the revised \ntarget); trail bridges with a length of 8,430 meters (m) were completed (against the 7,000 m \ntarget).  The current project has already created more than 5.3 million person-days of jobs \n(more than 70% from poor and excluded groups). \n  \n10.  Progress  has  been  good  in  the  implementation  of  the  gender  design  features  and \ngender action plan. Women have represented 33.17% of the membership of the Village Works \nRoad Coordination Committee against the target of 33%; and 38% of building groups against \nthe  target  of  40%.  The  current  project  risks  have  been  successfully  managed  through \nawareness raising, information dissemination, social mobilization, intensive on-site supervision, \nand capacity building at central and local levels. As of 30 June 2011, the current project\u2019s \noverall physical progress was estimated by ADB\u2019s Nepal Resident Mission at 90% against the \nelapsed loan period of 95%. As of 5 July 2011, the cumulative contract award was $39.44 \nmillion and disbursement was $27.51 million. Considering the withdrawal applications in the \nprocess  and  expenditures  already  incurred  by  districts,  the  current  project  is  expected  to \ncomplete all the remaining works by the loan closing date of 31 October 2011. \n \n11.  The  scaled  up  project  scope  under  additional  financing  will  address  many  lessons \nlearned from implementing past and ongoing rural roads projects, including the current project. \nThese include undertaking an innovative road maintenance program, improving the access of \nthe rural poor to microfinance, strongly promoting the use of building groups, restructuring the \ntargeted skills training, and sharpening the focus on national and district capacity. The current \nproject has established a satisfactory operating modality between central agencies and district \nadministrations, as well as between different stakeholders at central and district levels. The \ncurrent project has prepared and designed a pipeline of additional rural road subprojects for \nimplementation. The provision of additional financing for the current project will build on this \nestablished pipeline of road subprojects to move rapidly toward implementation. There are very \nclear  efficiency gains  to  be  realized  for  scaling  up  the current  project  by  using  additional \nfinancing, especially in terms of being able to implement the subprojects already designed and \nto utilize the structures and staffing developed in the current project, at both the central and \ndistrict levels. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The impact of the overall project will be reduced rural poverty in 18 poor and remote hill \nand mountain districts. The overall project outcome will be widened access to social services \nand economic opportunities. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n13.  The  overall  project  outcome  will  be  achieved  through  the  following  overall  project \noutputs: (i) rural livelihood improved, (ii) capacity and decentralized local governance enhanced, \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2010.

Output 1: Rural Livelihood Improved  \n \n14.  The scaled up project scope will improve community infrastructure in the 18 districts. \nThis will include 90 school buildings and health posts, 36 foot or mule or link trails, 54 water \nsupply  and  irrigation  schemes,  10  micro-hydropower  schemes,  8  rural  market  places,  10 \nropeways, and other community infrastructure. These investments are capped at $120,000, or \n20% of the cost of the road subproject, whichever is lower. Community infrastructure12 will be \nbased on the demand and identified priorities in the impact zones of the road subprojects. The \nbeneficiaries of the community infrastructure are expected to be at least 50% women and \nmembers of excluded groups.  \n \n15.   The scaled up project will organize training that can contribute to a level 1 certification \nby the Nepal Skills Testing Board; and will provide livelihood-related skills training to 3,000 \nbeneficiaries from the project impact zones, of which at least 40% are women and 60% are from \npoor and excluded groups. The social awareness-raising training will be provided to 9,000 \npersons, of whom 80% are women, poor, and from excluded groups. The focus of awareness-\nraising  training  will  be  on  good  nutrition,  health  and  sanitation  concerns  in  poor  rural \npopulations. In nine pilot districts, it will work with existing savings and credit groups, and assist \nbuilding groups willing to form themselves into formal savings and credit cooperatives and \nfacilitate their access to credit from existing institutional suppliers. \n \n2.  Output  2:  Capacity  Building  and  Decentralized  Local  Governance \nEnhanced \n \n16.  The  scaled  up  project  scope  will  improve  district  and  national  capacity  building  to \npromote improved decentralized governance. The thrust will be on establishing the capacity for \nsustainable management of rural road networks, strengthening the decentralized management \nof rural infrastructure, and raising central capacity to support local government bodies. It will \nprovide  a  variety  of  training  to  strengthen  local  rural  road  planning,  construction,  and \nmaintenance management capacity; and sustainable financing. At the national level, it will \nimprove the technical and management capacities of the Department of Local Infrastructure \nDevelopment and Agricultural Roads (DOLIDAR) by providing transport, training, and resources \nto  draw  on  specialized  services  from  the  consultants  and  nongovernment  organizations. \nRegional study tours will be designed and undertaken to enhance the learning experiences. \n \n3.  Output 3: Rural Transport Infrastructure Extended and Maintained \n \n17.  The scaled up project scope will improve 260 km of rural roads in the 18 districts \n(200 km new and 60 km upgrading).13 The design phase of subprojects will consider the impact \nof climate change, which includes avoiding unstable slopes, high-risk soil erosion-prone areas \nand landslide areas, and waterlogged areas near streams; strictly implementing slope stability \nmeasures and robust road drainage systems; graveling the road in high-risk areas; and using \nbetter maintenance approaches. Rural roads of 1,200 km will be maintained in the 18 districts \nand 6,500 m of trail bridges will be constructed.

The scaled up project scope  will provide direct support to road maintenance programs \nin line with the pilot program being supported by development partners toward a sector-wide \napproach for maintenance of rural roads throughout the country. To qualify for the maintenance \ngrant,14 the districts will clearly allocate the road maintenance function to a suitable person such \nas the district maintenance officer in the district technical office, prepare an inventory of all \ndistrict roads, conduct annual road condition surveys, and prepare annual road maintenance \nplans.  Routine  maintenance  will  be  delivered  by  the  length-persons,  creating  jobs  in  the \ndistricts.15 A  system  of  toll  collection  will  be  piloted  in  nine  districts  to  augment  road \nmaintenance funds. \n \n4.  Output 4: Project Management Improved \n \n19.  Technical  support  to  project  implementation  will  be  provided  through  central \nimplementation support consultants and district implementation support consultants in each of \nthe  18  project  districts.  Suitable  vehicles  will  be  provided  to  each  district  project  office to \nimprove  implementation  performance.

A project implementation coordination committee, chaired by the director \ngeneral of DOLIDAR, will be responsible for addressing and resolving implementation issues \nand advising on technical matters. The procurement capacity of DOLIDAR and the districts was \nassessed and was found to be satisfactory. \n \n23.  The  MLD  has  reconstituted  a  joint  project  steering  committee  for  all  development \npartners\u2019 rural  transport  infrastructure  projects,  in  an  integrated  sector-wide  approach. The \nproject steering committee shall meet whenever necessary, but not less than twice a year. The \nimplementing agencies will be the DDC in each of the 18 project districts. Overall project \nimplementation at the district level will be the responsibility of a district project office within the \ndistrict  technical  office  of  each  DDC.  The  central  implementation  support  consultants  will \nprovide  technical  services  to  the  PCU  to  facilitate  the  execution  of  the  project.  District \n ", "7 \nimplementation  support  consultant  teams  will  provide  (i)  technical  inputs  for  planning, \nengineering  design,  construction  supervision,  and  quality  control  of  subprojects  and \nsupplementary  investments;  and  (ii)  social  inputs  for  awareness  raising,  participation, \nmobilization of beneficiaries, and social development. The implementation arrangements are \nsummarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the project administration manual (PAM). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2012\u2013December 2016 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2016 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Project steering committee: Secretary, Ministry of Local Development (chair); \ndirector general, DOLIDAR; deputy director general DOLIDAR; project \ncoordinator, project coordination unit, DOLIDAR; representative, Ministry of \nFinance; representative, district development committees; development \npartners \n(ii)  Executing agency  DOLIDAR \n(iii) Key implementing  District development committees \nagencies \n(iv) Implementation unit  District implementation support consultant teams in each district as required, \ndistrict project officers, and district technical officers  \nProcurement of goods and  Community participation / national  1,700 contracts  $31.8 million \nworks  competitive bidding / shopping / \ninternational competitive bidding \nConsulting services  QCBS (national consultants);a   5,760 person- $3.84 million \nquality\u2013cost ratio (80:20)  months  (10 contracts) \nQCBS (nongovernment  336 person- $0.67 million \norganizations)  months \nQCBS (training)  400 person- $2.14 million \nmonths \nIndividual recruitment  96 person-months  $0.21 million \nRetroactive financing  ADB  may,  subject  to  its  policies  and  procedures,  allow  on  request \nand/or advance  (i) advance  contracting  of  civil  works,  equipment  and  materials,  and \ncontracting  consulting services; and (ii) retroactive financing of eligible expenditures up \nto 20% of the proposed loan and grant,b incurred prior to loan and grant \neffectiveness but not earlier than 12 months before the date of signing of the \nrelated legal agreement. Any approval of advance contracting or retroactive \nfinancing will not constitute a commitment by ADB to finance the project. \nDisbursement  The ADB and OFID loans and ADB grant proceeds will be disbursed in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the \ngovernment and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, DOLIDAR = Department of Local Infrastructure Development and Agricultural \nRoads, OFID = OPEC Fund for International Development, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection. \na  International expertise is not required in the implementation and supervision of the overall project at the district \nlevel.  The  national  consultants  are  working  and  performing  well  in  the  current  project;  they  have  shown \ncompetence and can carry out design and supervision works. \nb  Advance contracting and retroactive financing will be applicable only for eligible expenditures not covered by OFID \nfinancing. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "8 \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n24.  The economic viability of the overall project was assessed through a detailed analysis of \nthree sample subprojects\u2014Bajura, Solukhumbu and Taplejung districts\u2014which are considered \nto be representative of the types of rural infrastructure subprojects to be financed under the \noverall project. The length of the roads ranges from 7.7 km for the Bajura road to 21.8 km for \nthe Taplejung road. All of the roads were assessed to be appropriately designed to represent \nthe least-cost approach to providing improved transportation. Economic benefits were assessed \nboth  in  terms  of  consumer  surplus  through  reduced  costs  for  existing  and  incremental \ntransportation  of  people  and  goods,  and  producer  surplus  in  terms  of  reduced  costs  of \nagricultural production and incremental production.16 The analyses of the sample subprojects \nindicated that the economic internal rate of return is 15.3% for Bajura, 22.0% for Solukhumbu, \nand 22.7% for Taplejung. The sensitivity tests and risk analysis confirm that the subprojects are \nextremely robust. Distribution analyses confirm that the overall project will provide substantial \nbenefits to the poor. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n25.  Project-specific governance risks have been analyzed by carrying out a governance risk \nassessment. A thorough assessment of the financial management and procurement capacities \nof the MLD and DOLIDAR was undertaken, and a set of realistic risk mitigation measures has \nbeen proposed and discussed with the government. Risks associated with project management, \nincluding procurement and disbursement, will be mitigated by (i) providing consulting inputs to \nadvise  and  assist  in  the  procurement  of  goods  and  services;  (ii)  requiring  that  civil  work \ncontracts include a condition that contractors adhere to ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date); (iii) the PCU periodically inspecting the contractor\u2019s fund withdrawals and \nsettlements; and (iv) reporting on project activities and implementation on the website to foster \ntransparency and timely awarding of contracts. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to \nand  discussed  with  the  government  and  DOLIDAR.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM.17 \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n26.  The scaled up project scope will create an additional 4.7 million person-days of jobs, \nfrom road improvement, maintenance, and the development of community infrastructure. About \n900,000\u20131,500,000 people (of which 65% are poor) will directly benefit from the project. The \npoor\u2014estimated  at  about  500,000\u20131,000,000  and mostly from  excluded  castes  and  ethnic \ngroups such as dalits, Janajatis, and indigenous peoples\u2014will be targeted for participation in \nbuilding groups, complementary investment, and access to microfinance, awareness raising, \nand capacity building and focused livelihood enhancement schemes. A Gender Equality and \nSocial Inclusion Action Plan18 has been prepared for the project to address gender inequality \nand social exclusion issues. The Gender Equality and Social Inclusion Action Plan contains \nspecific targets for the participation of, and ensuring project benefits reach, poor rural women, \nand excluded groups in the subproject areas. \n \n                                                \n16 Reduced costs of agricultural inputs and increased prices of outputs arising from reduced transportation costs were \nomitted from the consumer surplus estimates to avoid double counting. \n17 PAM (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Gender Equality and Social Inclusion Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nD.  Safeguards \n \n 27.  Environment. The overall project is category B in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009). The executing agency and implementing agencies prepared initial \nenvironmental  examinations,  including  environmental  management  plans  (EMPs),  for  the \nsample  subprojects.  The  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  was  revised  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The framework sets out the requirements \nfor project screening and classification, subproject selection, information disclosure to, and \nconsultation  with,  the  affected  people,  environmental  assessment,  EMP  development  and \nimplementation, and monitoring and reporting. The initial environmental examinations found the \nplanned subprojects to have only small and localized adverse impacts on the environment, \nwhich can be managed by the mitigation measures proposed in the EMPs. \n \n28.  Resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  overall  project  is  category  B  for \ninvoluntary resettlement and category B for indigenous peoples, in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement.  Most  subprojects  involve  land  acquisition  and  involuntary \nresettlement,  but  the  involuntary  resettlement  impact  is  not  considered  significant.  The \nresettlement framework has been revised and updated in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. The resettlement framework includes a due diligence procedure to ensure \nthose donating land will not be impoverished through donation. Any donation will be confirmed \nthrough a written record, including a no-coercion clause verified by an independent external \nparty.  Land  owners  not  conforming  to  the  donation  eligibility  criteria  will  be  offered \ncompensation at replacement cost and/or assistance so that they maintain the same or better \nincome and livelihood status. All subprojects will be screened early in the project cycle. If a \nsubproject involves any involuntary resettlement impacts, an appropriate resettlement plan will \nbe prepared based on the detailed design, disclosed to those affected persons, and submitted \nfor ADB approval in accordance with the resettlement framework. The indigenous peoples \nplanning  framework  has  also  been  revised  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement,  with  special  assistance  measures  for  indigenous  peoples  and  other  vulnerable \ngroups. Considering the nature and scale of the subprojects, any negative impact on indigenous \npeoples is expected to be limited to a few involuntary resettlements and land acquisition cases. \nIn addition, a gender equality and social inclusion plan contains specific actions favorable to \nindigenous peoples. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n29.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.19 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nCollusion, bid rigging, cartels, and  Introducing  e-bidding  system,  providing  training  to  staff  of \nphysical threats from bidding parties and  procurement  unit  for  efficient  procurement  practice  and \nothers   techniques, and continued coordination with civil society and \nlocal level political parties \n Weak institutional capacity of the  Intensive  training  will  be  provided  to  targeted  district  level \nimplementing agencies   officials to enhance capacity in project implementation.  \n Weak compliance with public financial  Through the executing agency, ADB\u2019s Nepal Resident Mission \nmanagement systems and procedures  will  work  closely  with  the  Office  of  the  Auditor  General  to \naddress audit observations and any necessary remedial action.   \n                                                \n19 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n30.  The government and the MLD/DOLIDAR have assured ADB that implementation of the \nproject shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed  in  detail  in  the  PAM  and  loan  documents.
