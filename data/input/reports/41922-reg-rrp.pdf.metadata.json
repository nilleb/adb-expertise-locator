Global energy demand is higher today than \never before and is increasing every year. The base case developed by the International Energy \nAgency  projects  primary  energy  demand  worldwide  in  2030  to  be  more  than  53%  higher  than \ncurrent demand. More than two thirds of this increase is attributed to developing countries, with \ntheir rapid economic growth and population increase.  \n\nDeveloping  Asia  a  Large  Part  of  Energy  Demand.  Large parts of Asia, in particular, \n3. \nare  in  a  sustained  period  of  fast  economic  growth,  driving  ever-increasing  demand  for  energy \n(integral  to  economic  growth).  New  energy  infrastructure  is  being  installed  at  unprecedented \nrates across the region, and energy use is expected to grow faster in Asia than in the rest of the \nworld  for  the  next  2  decades.  Indeed,  \u201cbusiness  as  usual\u201d  forecasts  anticipate  energy  use  in \nAsia  to  increase  89%  between  2006  and  2030,  at  which  point  Asia  (in  particular,  rapidly \ndeveloping economies like the People\u2019s Republic of China [PRC] and India) will be consuming \n30%  of  the  world\u2019s  energy.  While  energy  demand  will  fall  from  59%  in  2000  to  47%  by  2030 \namong Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, it will rise \nfrom 20% to 27% in developing Asia. \n\nHigher  Greenhouse  Gas  Emissions.  Asian  countries,  as  mentioned  above,  are \n4. \ninstalling new energy supply infrastructure at an unprecedented rate. The International Energy \nAgency estimates that energy supply infrastructure in developing Asia will require a staggering \n$6.3 trillion in investments between now and 2030, $3.7 trillion of that amount for the PRC alone. \nThe energy investments are strongly carbon-intensive, with major energy-consuming countries \nshowing  a  keen  preference  for  coal-fired  power  generation.  More  than  half  of  the  anticipated \ninvestment  of  $6.3  trillion  is  projected  to  be  in  electricity  generation,  primarily  from  coal-fired \nplants.2 This trend toward coal-fired power generation is contributing significantly to the increase \nin greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Asia. The region\u2019s share of GHG emissions worldwide \nincreased  from  less  than  9%  in  1973  to  24%  in  2003,  and  is  projected  to  increase  to  29%  by \n2030. Developing countries will overtake the OECD countries in GHG emissions by 2010, and \nthe  PRC  (which  surpassed  the  US  as  the  world\u2019s  largest  producer  of  GHG  in  2007)  will  be \nresponsible  for  39%  of  the  worldwide  increase  between  2004  and  2030,  according  to  the \nInternational Energy Agency. \n\n                                                 \n1  The  Challenges  and  Opportunities  section,  including  much  of  the  wording,  draws  on  a  recent  report\u2014Carmody, \nJosh, and Duncan Ritchie. 2007. Investing in Clean Energy and Low Carbon Alternatives in Asia. Manila: ADB. The \ndeal team thanks the authors for this excellent report.  \n\n2 The PRC alone is reportedly adding coal-fired generation capacity at the rate of close to 2,000 megawatts per week. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nGlobal  Climate  Change.  Scientific  evidence  points  to  increasing  risks  of  serious, \n5. \nirreversible  impact  from  climate  change  associated  with  the  anticipated  trajectories  of  GHG \nemissions. The Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \nwarns  with  more  than  90%  certainty  that  human  activity  contributes  to  climate  change: \n\u201cWarming  of  the  climate  system  is  unequivocal,  as  is  now  evident  from  observations  of \nincreases in global air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising \nglobal mean sea level.\u201d3   \n\nUrgent  Action  Needed  to  Mitigate  GHG  Emissions  in  Asia.  The  situation  calls  for \n6. \nimmediate action to mitigate global GHG emissions, including early and decisive action to adopt \nsustainable energy development worldwide. Because of developing Asia\u2019s quickly enlarging role \nin  energy  consumption  and  carbon  dioxide  emissions,  without  increased  and  urgent  GHG \nmitigation  in  Asia,  global  GHG  emissions  cannot  be  reduced  to  a  level  that  will  prevent \ndangerous  climate  change.  Indeed,  if  the  trillions  of  dollars  invested  in  new  energy  supply \ninfrastructure in Asia over the next 20 years still go into carbon-intensive supply infrastructure, \nattempts to reduce GHG emissions in more energy-efficient parts of the world, such as Europe, \nare unlikely to make a meaningful dent in total GHG emissions.  Asia must therefore diversify its \nenergy  and  fuel  supply.  A  substantial  proportion  of  the  investment  capital  flowing  into  Asian \nenergy  supply  infrastructure  over  the  next  two  to  three  decades  must  be  dedicated  to  clean \nenergy and low-carbon investment alternatives. \n\n7. \nRecognition  of  Need  for  Urgent  Action  among  ADB\u2019s  Developing  Member \nCountries. Countries across Asia recognize the need for action, and have begun to set targets \nfor reducing their dependence on carbon-intensive forms of energy. The PRC looks forward to \nproducing 10% of its energy from renewable sources by 2010,4 and 16% of primary energy and \n20% of power generation capacity from renewable energy sources by 2020. Energy ministers of \nthe  Association  of  Southeast  Asian Nations  (ASEAN)  have  agreed  on  a  10%  target  for  power \ngeneration from renewable resources by 2010. Renewable energy is foreseen to supply 10% of \nIndia\u2019s  energy  needs  by  2012,5  and  8%  of  Thailand\u2019s  commercial  primary  energy  by  2011.6 \nGovernments are taking action to achieve these targets. In the Philippines, the Government is \noffering  geothermal  blocks  to  developers,  letting  14  mini-hydro  sites,  and  offering  several  gas \nand light natural gas blocks for exploration and development. In Viet Nam, independent power \nproducer contracts are being offered for wind sites throughout the country, while in Indonesia, \ninvestment  in  biofuels  and  geothermal  is  increasing  in  response  to  government  policies  that \npromote their development and use. Countries across the region are also working to make their \ninvestment  climates  friendlier  to  investors  in  clean  energy  projects.  Private  companies  in  the \nforefront of the industry, such as Suzlon Energy in India and Suntech Power in the PRC, have \ncapitalized on the new opportunities.  \n\nNeed for Increased Capital Flows into Asian Clean Energy Investments. The urgent \n8. \nneed to arrest and, if possible, reverse the upward spiral in GHG emissions in the energy sector \n\n                                                 \n3  Specific  effects  in  Asia  include  (i)  more  frequent  and  intense  typhoons  affecting  the  Pacific  as  well  as  East  and \nSouth Asia; (ii) more uncertain water supply in key basins such as the Aral Sea, the Indus River, and the Ganges \nRiver  because  of  the  retreat  of  glaciers  in  the  Himalayas  plus  the  greater  variability  of  rainfall;  and  (iii)  more \ndroughts in many parts of the region. \n\n4  Asia  Pacific  Development.  2006.

In 2006, global investment in clean \nenergy  reached  $100 billion  (45%  higher  than  in  2005),  with  just  over  $70  billion  in  new \ninvestments, and $30 billion in merger and acquisition and buyout transactions. In addition, the \nglobal  carbon  market  grew  to  about  $30  billion  (a  177%  increase  over  2005).  This  market  is \nanticipated to grow rapidly in coming years: the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) \nforesees a $1.9 trillion global market for clean energy financing and a $2 trillion global market \nfor GHG emission trading by 2020. A mandated clean energy target of 20% for Asian nations by \n2020  would  lead  to  almost  $1  trillion  in  clean  energy  investment  in  Asia  by  2030,  of  which \nalmost  $50  billion  would  be  required  yearly  until  2020.7  The  business  opportunities  are  thus \nclear. Up to this point, however, most of the capital invested in the clean energy sector has gone \nto OECD markets; Asia has received only a small fraction of the total.  \n\nB. \n\nCall for Proposals8\n\n9. \nGiven  the  aforementioned  imbalance  between  Asia  and  the  OECD  countries  in  capital \ninvested in clean energy projects, ADB is taking up the challenge of encouraging the growth of \nrisk capital in the Asian clean energy sector by investing equity in several private equity funds, \nwhich will, in turn, invest equity in clean energy projects and companies. Over the last decade, \nprivate  equity  funds  have  proliferated  across  Asia,  particularly  in  bigger  markets  like  the  PRC \nand India. In the last year or two, clean energy funds have emerged as a distinct niche in the \nprivate equity industry; indeed, in 2006, ADB received more than 10 clean energy fund concepts \nand  proposals  from  either  project  developers  or  fund  managers.  Most  of  those  potential  fund \nmanagers,  however,  lacked  the combination  of  strong  private  equity  performance  and  specific \nclean energy expertise needed to receive investment from ADB. For this reason, ADB sought to \nfind truly high-caliber clean energy private equity fund managers in ADB\u2019s developing member \ncountries (DMCs) by issuing a call for proposals (CFP).  \n\nCFP Concept. The CFP, which was issued to the market in July 2007, stated that ADB \n10. \nanticipated financing up to five funds selected through the CFP, and laid out a timetable for the \nselection and approval of these funds. The CFP indicated that ADB would provide a total of up \nto $100 million for investment in the funds, representing less than 25% of the total capital of a \ngiven  fund.9  In  issuing  the  CFP,  ADB  hoped  to  make  both  the  private  equity  sector  and  the \nclean  energy  sector  aware  of  its  commitment  to  increasing  equity  funding  to  clean  energy \ninvestments,  and  to  motivate  these  two  sectors  to  merge  their  expertise  in  order  to  evolve \nbetter-quality fund managers, and catalyze increased equity investment in clean energy projects \nin ADB\u2019s DMCs.  \n\n11. \n\nSector  and  Geographic  Focus.  The  CFP  identified  a  broad  range  of  sectors  within \n\n                                                 \n7  Such targets are not significantly beyond the present agenda in Asia since, as mentioned above in the main text, \nthe  PRC  has  set  a  target  of  producing  16%  of  primary  energy  and  20%  of  power  generation  capacity  from \nrenewable sources by 2020, and ASEAN energy ministers have agreed on a 10% target for power generation from \nrenewable sources by 2010. \n\n8  With financing from the Government of Canada, ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) carried out \na small-scale technical assistance to design a CFP in 2007. See ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance for Establishing \nRenewable Energy, Energy Efficiency, and Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Investment Funds (TA 6384). In the second \nquarter  of 2007, PSOD finalized a  CFP  with general guidelines for investment fund proposals and fund manager \nselection, plus a timeline, aimed at creating more private equity funds for renewable energy, energy efficiency, and \nGHG emission abatement projects. As the CFP process is a new, innovative procedure in ADB, PSOD consulted \nwith relevant departments, particularly the Office of the General Counsel and the Strategy and Policy Department, \nbefore issuing the call. Details on the CFP are available at http://adb.org/Clean-Energy-CFP/proposals.asp. \n\n9  The balance of each fund\u2019s capital is to be raised from other sponsors and private sector investors. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nclean  energy,  including  (i)  renewable  energy, 10  (ii)  energy  efficiency, 11  (iii)  GHG  abatement \nprojects, 12   and  (iv)  other  clean  technology. 13   The  CFP  had  a  liberal  geographic  focus, \nconsidering  funds  with  both  regional  and  country-specific  mandates  within  ADB\u2019s  DMCs.  The \npotential  clean  energy  investments  range  from  those  in  the  very  early  stages  of  development \n(i.e.,  start-up  or  clean  technology\u2013based  investments)  to  those  in  the  late  stages  (i.e., \ncompanies in the project development phase or before the initial public offering [IPO]). Private \nequity funds can invest at any stage of the clean energy project life cycle. An investment at a \nvery  early  (concept)  stage  provides  great  opportunity  for  a  fund  to  benefit  from  the  project\u2019s \npotential upside; at the same time, however, the fund takes on virtually all of the risk inherent in \nfunding venture or concept projects. Investing at a later stage, such as during construction, may \nsomewhat reduce the returns of the project but also mitigates at least some of the risks involved \nin getting the project off the ground. At the other end of the spectrum, a fund can invest in an \nexisting late-stage or pre-IPO company, with a significantly lower risk; the fund, however, thus \nforfeits some of the returns that accrue to investors that are willing to absorb the risk of investing \nearlier  in  the  project  cycle.  The  CFP  did  not  categorically  specify  the  stage  of  the  portfolio \ncompany in which the funds would invest, and indeed sought the diversification of risk that funds \nwith different investment strategies would bring to the portfolio. Above all, ADB was looking for: \n(i)  fund  managers  that  combined  strong  private  equity  performance  with  clean  energy  sector \nexpertise; (ii) solid and creative proposals clearly describing the fund manager\u2019s target market, \ninvestment thesis, and investment  methods; and (iii) fund concepts that were likely to achieve \nADB\u2019s objective of expanding clean energy investment. \n\nFund  and  Fund  Manager  Selection  Criteria. 14   In  assessing  the  proposals,  ADB \n12. \nconsidered  a  range  of  standard  criteria  for  evaluating  private  equity  funds,  as  well  as  criteria \nspecific  to  the  clean  energy  sector,  including:  (i)  the  credibility  and  thoughtfulness  of  the \nproposal and the fund manager\u2019s investment strategy; (ii) the fund manager\u2019s target market(s), \ninvestment  thesis,  and  marketing  and  project  sourcing  strategy;  (iii)  the  track  record  of  the \nprospective  fund  manager  in  making,  reaping  value  from,  and  exiting  from  equity  investments \n(in emerging markets, Asia, clean energy, etc.); (iv) the experience, depth, credibility, and team \ncohesiveness of the fund manager, as well as its competitive positioning relative to other funds; \n(v) the fund manager\u2019s experience as a fiduciary vis-\u00e0-vis fund reporting and administration; and \n(vi)  the  degree  to  which  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  proposed  fund  matched  ADB\u2019s \nrequirements.  \n\nCFP  Selection  Process  and  Timetable.  The  CFP  was  issued  to  the  market  on \n13. \n13 July 2007,  and  proposals  were  received  until  13  September  2007.  The  proposals  were \nevaluated with the help of an external consultant, and short-listed funds were invited to Manila \nfor initial interviews, which took place in October 2007. These half-day interviews were attended \nby  representatives  of  ADB\u2019s  Capital  Markets  and  Financial  Sectors  Division  (PSCM)  of  the \nPrivate  Sector  Operations  Department  (PSOD);  the  Energy,  Transport  and  Water  Division \n(RSID)  of  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department;  the  Office  of  the  General \nCounsel; the Office of Cofinancing Operations; the Economics and Research Department; and \n\n                                                 \n10  I.e.,  wind,  solar  thermal,  solar  photovoltaic,  geothermal,  biomass  (wood,  agricultural  waste,  municipal  waste), \n\nbiofuels (ethanol and biodiesel), biogas, tidal, and small hydro. \n\n11 Power plant optimization, power transmission and distribution system upgrades, cogeneration systems, waste heat \nrecovery power generation, and a range of efficient end-use technologies (e.g., motors, lighting, boilers, controls, \nindustrial process equipment, pumping systems, compressors, heating and air conditioning, and other equipment).  \n\n12 Such as landfill gas, coal mine methane, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, and nitrogen dioxide recovery projects. \n13 Integrated gasification combined cycle and supercritical boiler systems.  \n14 More information in detail is on ADB\u2019s CFP web page: http://adb.org/Clean-Energy-CFP/ \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n\nregional  departments. 15   After  these  interviews,  RSID  and  the  Economics  and  Research \nDepartment gave their evaluation and feedback on each fund from a technical perspective; with \nthese assessments, as well as those of the project team and the consultant, the team selected a \nnumber of funds for full due diligence. Due diligence on the funds took place in November and \nDecember  2007.  Five  funds  presented  truly  compelling  stories  and  met  ADB\u2019s  assessment \ncriteria, and are proposed in this report for investment.      \n\nC. \n\nDevelopment Impact and ADB Value Addition \n\n1. \n\nDevelopment Impact \n\n14. \n\nADB\u2019s investments in the funds will have the following development impact: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe  investments  will  facilitate  significant  development  in  different  subsectors  of \nclean energy (such as small hydro,16 solar, wind, biofuels, biomass, geothermal, \nclean  technology,  and  energy  savings  and  efficiency),  and  thus  reduce  GHG \nemission and mitigate climate change.  \n\nThe  investments  support  the  promotion  of  environmentally  friendly,  sustainable \neconomic growth in ADB\u2019s DMCs.  \n\nThe  CFP  affirmed  the  credibility  and  potential  of  private  equity  in  the  clean \nenergy sector. ADB\u2019s investment in the selected clean energy funds will help to \ndevelop  the  asset  class  and,  by  demonstrating  the  potential  of  private  equity  in \nclean  energy,  will  attract  more  firms  into  the  sustainable  energy  market, \ndeepening the penetration and viability of this specialized asset class.  \n\nThe  investments  will  help  to  develop  a  class  of  fund  managers  and  financial \nprofessionals  in  the  sustainable  energy  sectors  in  the  region.  ADB\u2019s  support  of \nlocal players helps the private equity industry to grow and carry on in the target \nsector in the region.  \n\nThe  money  invested  by  the  funds  is  to  be  used  not  only  for  the  growth  and \nexpansion of portfolio companies but also for greenfield projects, thus developing \nindividual  companies  in  the  private  sector,  creating  jobs,  increasing  local  tax \nrevenue, and contributing to sustainable employment in the region. \n\nThe  funds  will  provide  management  advice  to  companies  in  financial  planning, \nresource \nproject  development,  business  expansion  strategies,  human \ndevelopment, technology, environmental and social issues, and international best \npractices  in  corporate  governance,  thus  raising  the  quality  of  individual \ncompanies.           \n\n2. \n\nValue Added by ADB \n\n15. \nCatalytic Effect. First of all, of the five funds proposed for investment in this report, four \nare  (to  some  degree)  first-time  fund  managers  in  the  clean  energy  sector  in  ADB\u2019s  DMCs. \nADB\u2019s  investment  will  be  extremely  helpful  to  the  funds  in  further  fundraising.  Indeed,  ADB\u2019s \ndemonstrated interest has already catalyzed interest from other investors. Second, with ADB\u2019s \ninvestment, the funds will be eligible for financing from the Asia Pacific Carbon Fund, CEFPF, \n                                                 \n15 All of these ADB departments, as well as the Risk Management Unit, were invited to the initial interviews. Those of \n\ntheir staff who were interested and were available attended.  \n\n16 \u201cSmall hydro\u201d projects are projects that meet the small hydro eligibility criteria of ADB\u2019s CEFPF. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nand the Seed Capital Assistance Facility (SCAF), which will assist the funds in developing their \nunderlying assets. Without ADB\u2019s investment, the funds will not have such access.  \n\nDemonstration  Effect.  Besides  helping  to  launch  the  funds,  ADB  anticipates  that \n16. \nsuccess on the part of these funds will help to demonstrate the credibility of private equity in the \nemerging clean energy sector in its DMCs, and mobilize capital to support other private equity \nfunds  in  the  target  sector.  The  CFP  effort  can  be  replicated  and  expanded  elsewhere  in  the \nregion  in  succeeding  years;  indeed,  ADB  has  had  conversations  with  other  multilateral \ninstitutions  that  plan  to run  their  own  CFPs  in  clean  energy  investment.  Additionally,  ADB  has \nreceived  proposals  from  other  clean  energy  funds  and  clean  energy  financing  companies \ninterested in leveraging ADB\u2019s resources beyond the CFP.  \n\n17.  Management Support and Professionalization. ADB (both PSCM and RSID staff) will \nadd  value  to  the  funds  by  assisting  them  in  gaining  access  to  the  Asia  Pacific  Carbon  Fund, \nCEFPF, and SCAF. ADB will also take a seat on the funds\u2019 advisory boards, and will thus have \na say in fund corporate governance. In the case of somewhat more experienced fund managers, \nADB\u2019s value addition will take the form of helping the fund expand its investment platform and \nfurther  professionalize  (e.g.,  meet  more  rigorous  standards  of  administration,  reporting,  and \ninvestor relations).   \n\nEnvironmental and Social Awareness. Fund managers and other investors appreciate \n18. \nADB\u2019s  strong  attention  to  environmental  and  social  safeguards  and  to  corporate  governance. \nADB\u2019s  involvement  in  environmental,  social,  and  governance  issues  reduces  the  risk  to  the \nfunds\u2019 reputation and creates confidence in locally managed funds.  \n\n3. \n\nDevelopment Outcome \n\nADB  will  measure  the  expected  development  outcome  of  the  proposed  investments  in \n\n19. \naccordance with the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1).  \n\nIII. \n\nTHE FUNDS  \n\nAsia Clean Energy Fund (ACE) / Korea Technology Investment Corporation (KTIC) \n\nA. \nand KPMG Samjong Investment Advisory (KPMG/SIA) \n\n20.             The  ACE  concept  was  developed  by  Kee-Doo  Hong,  vice  chairman  until  recently  of \nKPMG Korea, whose professional career and pursuits in the clean energy sector motivated him \nto  create  a  partnership  between  the  fund\u2019s  two  sponsors,  KTIC  and  KPMG/SIA.  KTIC  is  a \nwell-known  Korean  technology  venture  capital  firm,  and  has  over  two  decades  of  experience \ninvesting in technology-based projects and companies in the Republic of Korea. It has invested \n$1 billion in more than 520 portfolio companies, has $486 million under management, and has \nrun 19 venture capital funds and nine corporate restructuring funds. KPMG Korea is part of the \nglobal KPMG Group, and SIA provides investment and financial advisory services to numerous \nKorean corporate clients and institutional investors for domestic as well as global projects. SIA \nspecializes  in  advising  on  cross-border  transactions  and  corporate  finance  overseas,  and \nmaintains deal sourcing offices in Central Asia, the PRC, India, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Laos, and \nthe rest of Southeast Asia. With a target size of $200 million, ACE will invest in clean technology, \nrenewable energy, and energy efficiency investments throughout Asia.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7\n\nB. \n\nChina Clean Energy Capital (CCEC) / CCEC Partners \n\n21. \nAlthough  it  is  a  first-time  fund,  CCEC  has  spent  substantial  time  positioning  itself  to \nsucceed in the PRC market. It is one of only two local clean energy\u2013focused fund managers in \nthe  domestic  market.  The  CCEC  team  primarily  comprises  multilingual,  multicultural  PRC \nnationals;  the  team  members  have  decades  of  local  and  international  senior  management \nexperience in energy project development, engineering, finance, banking, and operations, with \nsuch  organizations  as Veolia  Environmental  Services,  Veolia  Energy,  China  National  Offshore \nOil  Corporation,  the  Development  Research  Center  of  the  State  Council  of  the  PRC,  CIBC \nWorld Markets, and Viventures. With a target size of $100 million\u2013$150 million, CCEC will invest \nin  renewable  energy  projects/technologies,  energy  savings/energy  efficiency,  and  other  clean \nenergy technologies in the PRC. \n\nC. \n\nChina Environment Fund III (CEF III) / Tsing Capital \n\nindustries  such  as  wastewater \n\n21. \nHaving  raised  its  first  clean  energy  fund  7  years  ago,  Tsing  Capital  was  the  industry \npioneer in the PRC, and is now a dominant clean energy investor in the country. Tsing Capital \nmanages  two  previously  small  clean  energy  funds,  which  have  collectively  invested  in  nine \ncompanies,  across \ntreatment,  energy  efficiency,  solar \nphotovoltaic cells and wafers, and solid waste recycling. Over its 7-year history, Tsing Capital, \nas a leader in clean energy investment in the PRC, has built up an impressive reputation in the \nindustry and an extensive network of contacts in business, central and provincial government, \nthe Ministry of Science, and Tsinghua University. CEF III is run by an experienced team with a \nbackground in technology investment and operations in the PRC and abroad. With a target size \nof $200 million\u2013$250 million, CEF III will invest in a portfolio of companies working to improve \nthe global environment by reducing, reusing, and recycling natural resources in the PRC.  \n\nD. \n\nGEF South Asia Clean Energy Fund (GEF-SA) / Global Environment Fund (GEF) \n\n22. \nGEF-SA  is  sponsored  by  GEF  Management  Corporation  (GEF),  a  globally  recognized \nclean energy investor, and YES Bank, a well-respected and fast-growing local Indian bank. With \n$800  million  under  management,  GEF  has  been  active  in  clean  energy  investing  since  1990, \nand has over 15 years of experience investing in clean energy projects in South Asia. GEF has \nmanaged  six  funds  and  completed  26  private  equity  investments  since  1998.  YES  Bank  has \nextensive industry and government contacts in India and the region, and a strong track record in \nclean  energy  investing,  having  financed  and  advised  clean  energy  transactions  totaling  $3.1 \nbillion  over  the  past  4  years.  The  investment  team  is  made  up  of  individuals  from  both \ninstitutions  with  professional  experience  in  international  and  local  private  equity,  including \nenergy and renewable energy investing. With a target size of $200 million, GEF-SA will invest in \ncompanies and projects that promote the use of efficient, reliable, and cleaner forms of energy \nin South Asia.  \n\nE. \n\nMAP Clean Energy Fund (MAP) / Middle East and Asia Capital Partners (MAP \nCapital) \n\n23.  MAP  Capital  was  established  by  Mumtaz  Khan,  the  former  CEO  of  EMP  Bahrain  and \nmanager  of  te  Islamic  Development  Bank\u2019s  (IDB)  Global  Infrastructure  Fund.  This  fund  has \ncommitted  $684  million  to  11  projects  in  IDB  member  countries,  all  of  which  were  led  by  Mr. \nKhan,  who  thus  has  a  demonstrated  track  record  of  finding  high-caliber  companies,  creating \ndeals,  and  adding  value  to  generate  strong  returns.  To  complement  his  own  experience  in \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nemerging  markets  investing,  Mr.  Khan  has  put  together  a  fund  team  of  international  and  local \nstaff with a deep background in private equity, corporate restructuring, corporate valuation, the \nenergy  sector  (including  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency),  and  engineering.  MAP \nCapital  seeks  to  be  a  platform  for  accelerating  investment  flows  between  Gulf  Cooperation \nCountries looking for large-scale energy projects and Asian countries looking for Middle Eastern \nfunding. With a target size of $400 million, MAP Capital will invest in a portfolio of clean energy \nsector projects across Asia, with a geographic focus on Indonesia and Southeast Asia.  \n\nIV. \n\nINVESTMENT BENEFITS, IMPACT, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nSocial and Environmental Safeguard Policies \n\n24. \nADB\u2019s  investments  in  the  funds  are  classified  as  category  FI  (financial  intermediary) \nunder  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002).  The  fund  manager  of  each  fund  will  be  required  to \nadopt an environmental management system. ADB\u2019s investments in the funds are classified as \ncategory  B/C  under  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  Policy  on  Indigenous \nPeoples (1998). None of the funds\u2019 investments are foreseen to lead to involuntary settlement. \nBut  the  funds  will  adopt  a  resettlement  framework  that  defines  the  policies,  procedures,  roles, \nand  responsibilities  of  the  funds  for  screening  and  managing  any  involuntary  resettlement  by \nportfolio  companies.  Likewise,  no  investments  by  the  funds  are  expected  to  affect  indigenous \npeoples. The funds will not invest in activities falling within ADB\u2019s list of exclusions. \n\nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy, and Policy of Combating Money Laundering and Financing \nof Terrorism \n\n25. \nThe fund managers were advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate)  and  the  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  Policy  (2003). \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire  the  fund  managers  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and \ncontrols  that  conform  to  international  best  practice  standards  to  prevent  corruption  or  money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging  in  such  activities.  The  investment  documentation  between  ADB  and  the  funds  will \nallow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings.  \n\nC. \n\nExposure Limits and Waiver  \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nFollowing the approval of the proposed investments by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors, ADB \n26. \nwill  enter  into  suitable  investment  documentation,  and  ensure  that  such  documentation  and \nother  principal  agreements  relating  to  each  fund  (including  the  management  agreement \nbetween the fund and the fund manager) will be on terms and conditions acceptable to ADB and \nare consistent with all relevant ADB policies. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n27. \nI am satisfied that the proposed equity investments in the funds would comply with the \nArticles  of  Agreement  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove the equity investments of up to $20,000,000 in each of the following funds (with a total \naggregate  investment  of  up  to  $100,000,000):  (i)  Asia  Clean  Energy  Fund,  (ii)  China  Clean \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\nEnergy Capital, (iii) China Environment Fund III, (iv) GEF South Asia Clean Energy Fund, and \n(v)  MAP  Clean  Energy  Fund,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  and  on  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be \nreported to the Board. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nMarch 2008 \n \n\n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n\n\f
