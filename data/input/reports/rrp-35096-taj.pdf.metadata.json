An initial environmental examination was undertaken; \nthe summary is a core appendix. \n \nThe  Project  will  improve  the  reliability  and  the  operation  of  the \nCentral  Asian  power  transmission  system,  enhance  intercountry \npower trading, and establish the foundation for a future wholesale \nregional power market. \n \nRegional  cooperation  among  the  countries  of  Central  Asia  is \nrequired  to  develop  their  economies.  An  adequate  and  reliable \npower  supply  is  essential  to  support  economic  growth.  The \nCentral  Asian  power  system  comprises  interconnected  high-\nvoltage \nlinks  encompassing  southern  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz \nRepublic,  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan,  and  Uzbekistan.  The  main \ntransmission lines link the power systems of the five countries for \nparallel  operation.  The  system  shares  common  operational  and \nservice management, planning, information channels and control, \nand  connects  83  power  plants,  including  29  thermal  and  48 \nhydropower plants, with a total installed capacity of about 25,000 \nmegawatts.  The  unified  dispatch  center  (UDC)  in  Tashkent  is \nresponsible  for  maintaining  the  balanced  and  synchronized \noperation  of  the  power  transmission  and  distribution  systems  of \nthe five countries. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in \n1991,  the  countries  maintained  balanced  and  synchronized \noperation  to  allow  import  and  export  of  electricity  among  them. \nMarket-oriented  issues  increasingly  play  a  major  role  in  power \nsystem  management.  However,  the  regional  technical  operation \nprotocols  are  less  respected  and  funds  for  maintenance  and \nrehabilitation  have  been  limited.  Each country has been focusing \nthan  establishing  a \nmore  on  power  self-sufficiency  rather \ncompetitive  regional  market  that  would  achieve  economically \nefficient patterns of trade. It is, however, increasingly accepted in \nCentral  Asia \nin  exploiting \ncomplementary energy resources on a regional basis. \n \nThe  Project  will  improve  the  operation  and  efficiency  of  the \nregional  power  transmission  system  and  enhance  economic \nregional  power  trade  and  cooperation  among  the  Central  Asian \nrepublics. Under the Project, the focus will be on modernizing the \ntransmission systems of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan and enhancing \nthe  power  trade  relations  between  them.  The  Project  will  be  the \nfirst  stage  of  an  assistance  program  to  promote  regional  energy \ncooperation. The project outputs will be as follows: \n \n \n\nthere  are  mutual  benefits \n\nthat \n\n\fiii \n\n(i)  Rehabilitated 500-kilovolt (kV) substations and switchgear. \nReplace  circuit  breakers  (500  and  220 kV),  current  and  voltage \ntransformers,  protection  and  control  systems,  and  the  direct \ncurrent system.  \n\n(ii) Upgraded dispatch and communications facilities. Upgrade \nfacilities  at  UDC,  national  dispatch  centers  and  area  dispatch \ncenters,  and \nInstall  new  remote \nterminal units in 500 kV substations and in major power plants.  \n\ntelecommunications \n\nlinks. \n\n(iii) New meters.  Install  new  transborder  metering  together  with \nmeter management systems at all dispatch centers. \n\n(iv) Improved \nregulatory \nenvironment.

The  PIU  will  be  supported by project \nimplementation  consultants  financed  under  the  loan.  A  project \nsteering  committee  (PSC)  will  be  established  to  coordinate  the \nProject implementation at the Government level. \n \n\n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n\nfor  Tajikistan  and  31  December  2007 \n\nfor \n\n\fv \n\nforeign  and  50  person-months  of \n\nUzbekenergo will be responsible for supervising and implementing \nthe  Uzbek  component  through  a  PIU  established  for  the  Project. \nThe  PIU  will  be  supported  by  project  implementation  consultants \nfinanced under the loan. A PSC will be established to coordinate \nthe Project implementation at the Government level. \n \nAll  procurement  to  be  financed  under  the  ADB  loans,  including \ncontracts for the design, supply, installation, and commissioning of \nthe project facilities, will be carried out in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines  for  Procurement  through  international  competitive \nbidding. \n \nConsulting  services  will  be  required  for  design  and  construction \nsupervision.  All  consultants  financed  from  the  ADB  loans  will  be \nselected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants. Uzbekistan: 155 person-months of foreign \nand 180 person-months of local consulting services. Tajikistan: 38 \nlocal \nperson-months  of \nconsulting  services.  The \nimplementation  of  a  management \ninformation system in Uzbekenergo will involve 15 person-months \nof  foreign  and  30  person-months  of  local  consulting  services. \nRetroactive  financing  was  approved  for  the  Uzbek  component \nimplementation  consulting  services  expenditures \nfrom  15 \nNovember 2002, up to a ceiling of $500,000.  \n \nThe  primary  beneficiaries  of \nthe  Project  will  be  business \nenterprises  and  the  population  who  will  benefit  from  improved \nquality  of  electricity  services  and  long-term  cost  reductions \nresulting from economic dispatch of power plants and the overall \nefficiency  gains  from  enhanced  power  trade.  Since  effectively  all \nthe  population  of  both  Tajikistan  and  Uzbekistan  have  access  to \nelectricity,  the  project  benefits  will  be  universal.  The  financial \nthe  Tajikistan  and  Uzbekistan \ninternal  rates  of  return \ncomponents  of  the  Project  are  estimated  to  be  7.0%  and  11.3%, \nrespectively. The economic internal rates of return are estimated \nto be 30.0% and 24.2%, respectively. In terms of poverty impact, \nthe net economic benefits accruing to the poor over the life of the \nProject  are  estimated  at  about  $46 million\u2013$17 million \nfor \nTajikistan and $29 million for Uzbekistan. The poverty impact ratio \nis  estimated  at  41%\u201357%  for  Tajikistan  and  35%  for  Uzbekistan. \nHence,  the  Project  can  be  said  to  be  pro-poor  as  a  substantial \nportion of the project benefits will go to the poor. \n \nThe  Project  has  been  formulated  to  minimize  potential  technical \nand  economic  risks.

I  further  summit  for  administration  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  a  loan  for  the  Project  to  be  provided  by  the  OPEC  Fund  for \nInternational Development (OPEC Fund). \n \nThe  Project  was  identified  and  prepared  under  ADB\u2019s  regional  technical  assistance  \n2. \n(RETA)  program.1  Regional  consensus  building  has  been  accomplished  through two regional \nmeetings  held  in  July  2001  and  April  2002.  The  Project  was  included  in  the  regional  project \npipeline and endorsed at the Central Asian Ministerial Conference on Economic Cooperation in \nApril  2002.  Fact-finding  for  the  Project  was  undertaken  from  19  April  to  6  May  2002  and \nappraisal  from  6  August  to  2  September  2002.  The  Project  was  formulated  based  on  the \nfindings  of  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  consultants  and  the  ADB  missions.  A  project \nframework summarizing the Project's goal, purpose, outputs, activities, and inputs is presented \nin  Appendix  1.  The  Project  is  the  first  stage  of  a  regional  assistance  program  to  promote \nregional energy cooperation and will focus on rehabilitating power transmission equipment and \nenhancing the power trade relationship between Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. \n \n\nI. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\ninterconnected  high-voltage \n\nThe  Central  Asian  power  system  comprises \n\nlinks \n3. \nencompassing  southern  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan,  and \nUzbekistan (see map). The main transmission lines link the power systems of the five countries \nfor  parallel  operation.  The  system  shares  common  operational  and  service  management, \nplanning, information channels and control, and connects 83 power plants, including 29 thermal \nand 48 hydropower plants, with a total installed capacity of about 25,000 megawatts (MW). The \nunified  dispatch  center  (UDC)  in  Tashkent  is  responsible  for  maintaining  the  balanced  and \nsynchronized operation of the power transmission and distribution systems of the five countries. \nFollowing  the  dissolution  of  the  Soviet  Union  in  1991,  the  countries  have  maintained \nsynchronized operation, which permits the exchange of electricity among them. Further details \nof the Central Asian power system are provided in Appendix 2. The main operating features are \nsummarized below. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nRegional  electricity  demand  declined  sharply  in  response  to  the  fall  in  industrial \noutput following independence. In 1991, peak demand was 19,754 MW, in 1995 \nit was 16,364 MW. Since 1998, demand has been increasing and in 2001 it was \n16,682 MW. Demand is expected to grow at about 2.5% a year to reach 20,150 \nMW in 2010. \n\nElectricity  production  has  fallen  in  line  with  demand,  from  116.1  terawatt-hour \n(TWh) in 1991 to 91.8 TWh in 2001, or by 21%. \n\nAvailable  generating  capacity  has  declined  by  16%  over  the  same  period  to \nabout 21,000 MW due to lack of adequate maintenance. \n\n(iv) \n\nNo new generating capacity has been commissioned since 1991. \n\n                                                 \n\napproved on 12 December 2000.  \n\n1   RETA  5960:  Regional  Power  Transmission  Modernization  Project  in  Central  Asian  Republics,  for  $900,000, \n\n\f2 \n\n \nB. \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nSystem  reliability  has  declined  as  a  result  of  inadequate  transmission  system \nthe  regional  operating  regime.  Recorded \nmaintenance  and  changes \ntransmission  system  related  outages  were  178  gigawatt-hours  (GWh)  in  1998, \n138 GWh in 1999, and 309 GWh in 2000. \n\nin \n\nPower trade has fallen by 80% from 28.7 TWh in 1990 to 4.6 TWh in 2001. The \ntrade  levels  represented  25%  and  5%  of  generation,  respectively.  Due  to \ncomplementarity  of  energy  resources,  there  is  significant  potential  for  economic \ntrading of power among the countries. With reforms in pricing, and power sector \nrestructuring combined with open trading policies, it is expected that power trade \ncould increase to 12% of power generation by 2011. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nProblem Analysis \n\n4. \nAdequate and reliable power supplies are required for economic development in Central \nAsia.  The  complementarity  of  energy  resources  and  the  existing  high-voltage  regional \ntransmission network means that power trade offers the least-cost economic solution to meeting \nthe  region\u2019s  power  needs.  However,  there  are  substantial  barriers  and  challenges  to  power \ntrade  in  Central  Asia.  The  core  problem  that  the  Project  seeks  to  address  is  the  suboptimal \noperation  of  the  regional  power  system  and  intercountry  power  trade.  The  causal  factors  are \ndescribed below and a problem tree is presented in Appendix 3. \n \n5. \nPolitical  and  Structural  Constraints.  A  prime  obstacle  to  energy  trade  is  that \ngovernments  in  the  region  have  had  self-sufficiency  as  a  policy goal. The effect is that some \nrepublics are generating electricity using high-value fossil fuels rather than importing electricity \nfrom  neighboring  countries  with  surplus  electricity  generated  from  renewable,  lower-cost \nresources.  There  has  also  been  a  tendency  in  some  countries  to  limit  access  to  their \ntransmission lines to countries wishing to trade with third countries. \n \n6. \nThe  energy-water  nexus  also  negatively  impacts  optimal  power  system  operation  and \ntrade.  Water  from  the  two  large  rivers,  Syr  Darya  and  Amu  Darya,  is  used  not  only  for \nhydropower generation in the upriver countries of Tajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic, but also \nfor  irrigation  purposes  in  these  countries  and  in  the  downriver  countries  of  Turkmenistan, \nUzbekistan, and Kazakhstan. The differing times of year for hydropower requirements (mainly in \nwinter)  and  for  irrigation  (mainly  in  summer)  pose  serious  conflicts  for  reservoir  operation,  the \nreplacement  of  winter  hydropower  by  supplies  of  fossil  power  and  fuel,  and  the  exchange \nconditions  between  water  and  energy.  To  cope  with  these  interrelationships  in  regional  trade, \nthe  Central  Asian  governments  have  resorted  to  bilateral  and  multilateral  agreements  that \ndetermine  the  quantities  of  water  and  energy  (coal,  electricity,  and  gas)  that  are  exchanged \nbetween the countries and the values at which they are exchanged. \n \n7. \nPower sector restructuring and reform are key to providing the incentives for trade, since \nindependent  transmission  and  distribution  companies  that  are separate from generation, more \nactively seek to trade power compared to integrated utilities that have a conflict of interest to sell \nand  maximize  their  own  generation.  Apart  from  Kazakhstan,  the  reform  process  of  the  power \nsectors toward a competitive power market system has made only limited progress to date and \nreform efforts vary from one country to another. Ultimately a regulator that could guarantee free \nand  nondiscriminatory  access  of  all  parties  that  meet  certain  technical  and  commercial \nrequirements will also be required to facilitate open trade. \n \n\n\f3 \n\n8. \nManagement  and  Institutional  Problems. The institutional framework for cooperation \nat the regional level requires strengthening. The UDC in Tashkent is responsible for maintaining \nthe  balanced  and  synchronized  operation  of  the  power  transmission  and  distribution  system. \nBecause of its close association with Uzbekenergo, the UDC is considered, fairly or unfairly, by \nother  countries  not  to  be  a  truly  independent  regional  organization.  Moreover,  the  UDC \npresently plays only a minor role in promoting regional cooperation in the power sector. Funding \nof  UDC  operation  is  supposed  to  be  on  an  equal  basis  from  all  the  countries;  however,  a \nnumber of countries are in arrears in their contributions. A power council consisting of the heads \nof each regional power utility is the executive body that overseas the operation of the UDC. \n \n9. \nTransmission  System  Technical  Problems.  System  reliability  is  closely  linked  to  the \nquality  and  adequacy  of  maintenance.  Many  components  of  the  transmission  system  have \nreached  the  end  of  their  economic  life  and  are  technically  obsolete,  and  resources  for \nmaintenance  and  development  of  the  power  system  have  been  limited.  Tariffs  are  below  cost \nrecovery  and  consequently  power  utilities  cannot  operate  and  maintain  the  system  to \ninternational  standards.  Since  even  maintenance  needs  cannot  be  met  there  is  also  no \nprovision for asset replacement and system expansion. The other technical problem is that the \npower system dis patch (or control) at the country and regional levels is suboptimal. The system \nis presently controlled manually at the station level with coordination from the UDC, the national \ndispatch centers (NDCs), and the area dispatch centers (ADCs). Coordination is performed via \na deteriorated telephone network on the basis of fragmented information and without application \nof appropriate supervisory control and data acquisition systems or energy management system \nfunctions. The existing level of automation of network control at the control centers as well as at \nthe substation level does not allow for efficient and optimized dispatch of generated power and \nancillary  services2  including  an  operating  reserve  as  required  to  maintain  frequency  regulation \nand load following in the power system.  \n \n10. \nPricing  Problems.  Pricing  is  the  key  to  providing  incentives  for  trade.  Presently,  a \ndistorted system of energy prices exists. Primary energy sources for thermal power generation \nare frequently and grossly undervalued  (e.g., in Uzbekistan the gas price for power generation \nis one fifth of the export or border price). Also, there is no value attributed to water regulation for \nirrigation.  For  power  trade  to  work  it  is  necessary  for  both  buyer  and  seller  to  receive  an \neconomic advantage. This is possible only in an environment of undistorted prices of electricity \nand  primary  fuels  for  power  generation.  A  further  pricing  issue  is  that  there  is  no  adequate \nmechanism  in  place  for  the  provision  of  and  compensation  for  ancillary services. In short, the \nlarge  hydropower  plants  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  provide  these  services  and  are \nrequired  to  maintain  spinning  reserves  for  regulating  the  interconnected  system  to  the \npredominantly  thermal  generating  systems  of  Uzbekistan,  Turkmenistan,  and  Kazakhstan, \nwithout  being  paid  a  price  for  these  services  that  would  allow  them  to  recover  their  costs. \nHydropower plants are able to quickly increase or decrease output compared to thermal plants, \nwhich allows them to be used to follow changes in demand. Hydropower plants are also able to \nrestart or blackstart the whole power system in the event of a system-wide collapse. Finally, as \npower tariffs are below long-run marginal costs, power utilities cannot create the revenues that \nare required to sustain power system operation, let alone trade. \n \n11. \nPayment Problems.  Currently,  exchange  of  power  is  governed  by  agreements  under \nwhich government officials of the various countries decide in regular meetings on the quantities \nto be imported and exported within a given time period. This exchange of power is often linked \n\n                                                 \n\n2  Ancillary services include spinning reserve (capacity which is instantaneously available if required), system control, \n\nfrequency regulation, black-start capacity, and reactive power. \n\n\f4 \n\nto  the  exchange  of  fossil  fuels  and  water  allocations  for  irrigation.  For  an  electricity  market  to \nwork it will be essential to decouple the electricity trade from water and the trade in fuels. Barter \nand  political  allocation  of  commodities  need  to  be  transformed  into  traded  energy  and  traded \nfeedstocks (such as coal and gas) with separate markets for each. Water allocation must be on \na  fair  and  equitable  basis  and  costs  of  water  storage  and  regulation  must  be  adequately \ncompensated.  Also,  the  financial  framework  does  not  yet  exist  that  would  allow  an  efficient \nsettlement  of  transactions  in  those  cases  where  they  are  not  barter-based and are dollarized. \nThere are problems of currency convertibility and there are no bank guarantees easily available, \nif  at  all,  for  such  transactions.  Nonpayment  across  borders  is  a  common  problem.  Finally, \nenergy trade is technically distorted by the lack of adequate metering of electric energy and load \nat the borders. The present metering installations do not provide the required accuracy for billing \npurposes  nor  the  capability  for  real-time  and  multi-tariff metering that would be necessary for \ntrade. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Rationale \n\n12. \nThe  Central  Asian  power  system  was  designed  as  a  single  integrated  system  out  of \nwhich the national systems have been partitioned following the dissolution of the former Soviet \nUnion.  As  a  result,  some  of  the  national  power  systems  are  divided  and  joined  only  through \nother  countries;  others  have  inadequate  generation  or  water  storage  capacity  for  their  own \nneeds and must import electricity seasonally or over the year; in other countries there is conflict \nbetween the electricity generation by hydropower stations and  the needs of their neighbors for \nwater  for  irrigation.  The  fundamental  rationale  for  cooperation  is  the  energy  resource \ncomplementarity combined with remoteness from world markets that makes it essential for the \nCentral  Asian  countries  to  share  water  and  energy.  Thus,  parallel  operation  of  the  regional \npower system and enhancement of energy trade are indispensable for the partner countries in \naddition  to  the  economic  advantages  that  the  interconnected  operation  provides.  To  facilitate \npower exchange and to  maintain reliable operation, the 500 kV transmission system must be \nupgraded and reliability secured, the dispatch and control systems need to be modernized, and \nmetering  needs  to  be  installed.  Together  with  these  key  investments,  policy,  institutional,  and \npricing reforms need to be implemented at both the domestic and regional levels. \n \nThe  Project  involving  Tajikistan  and  Uzbekistan  is  a  beginning  towards  the  long-term \n13. \ngoal  of  a  wholesale  regional  power  market.  The  other  republics  are  expected  to  join  in \nsubsequent projects and activities. At this stage the other republics have not been included in \nthe  Project  since  Kazakhstan  is  already  undertaking  transmission  rehabilitation  and  control \ninvestments with the assistance of the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction \nand Development (EBRD); Turkmenistan is yet to commence lending operations with ADB; and \nthe Kyrgyz Republic has borrowing constraints. To support expanding the participation of these \ncountries    in  the  regional  cooperation, undertaking further necessary investment requirements \nand making further progress on regional reforms, ADB's regional assistance program includes a \nPhase II project in 2004. In this way the condition of the transmission network and power trading \nin the Central Asian grid can be progressively improved. \n \nTajikistan  and  Uzbekistan  together  represent  about  65%  of  the  generation  capacity  in \n14. \nthe  Central  Asian  grid.  Tajikistan  has  huge  hydropower  export  potential  and  Uzbekistan  is  the \nkey  centrally  located  country  through  which  most  Central  Asian  power  trade  must  flow.  In \naddition,  its  thermal-based  power  system  would  benefit  significantly  from  the  availability  of \nhydropower  energy.  The  focus  of  the  Project  will  be  on  enhancing  the  bilateral  power  trading \nrelationship  between  the  two  countries  while  encouraging  broader  regional  cooperation.  It  is \nexpected  that  Tajikistan  and  Uzbekistan  will  become  the  champions  to  move  the  cooperation \nforward (particularly in terms of the Regional Power Trade Action Plan). \n\n\f5 \n\n \nGovernment  Strategy.  The  Central  Asian  governments  recognize  the  need  to  provide \n15. \nreliable,  efficient,  and  affordable  energy  to  support  economic  development.  To  this  end,  each \ngovernment  has  been  taking  steps  to  reform  its  respective  power  sector  and  improve  cost \nrecovery.  The  governments  also  recognize  the  importance  of  regional  cooperation  to  address \nenergy  and  water  issues  to  the  benefit  of  all  parties.  In  this  regard  they  executed  in  1999  an \nagreement on the parallel operation of the regional electricity grid that forms the basis for trade \nand  cooperation  and  the  ultimate  development  of  a  regional  power  pool.  The  Project  was \nendorsed  at  the  Central  Asian  Ministerial  Conference  on  Economic  Cooperation  in  Manila  in \nApril  2002  as  part  of  the  3-year  regional  program  and  was  reconfirmed  as  top  priority  by \nTajikistan and Uzbekistan representatives at the ADB annual meeting in May 2002. \n \n16. \nADB  Strategy.  ADB\u2019s  regional  program,  which  complements  and  supplements  the \nindividual country programs, has focused on identifying infrastructure needs and improving the \npolicy  environment  for  promoting  cross-border  trade  in  the  areas  of  energy,  trade,  and \ntransportation.  In  the  energy  sector  the  focus  is  on  maximizing  benefits  from  resource \ncomplementarity  by  rationalizing  and  encouraging  regional  energy  trade,  based  on  market \nprinciples, and rehabilitating existing infrastructure. \n \n17. \nExternal  Assistance.  In  Central  Asia,  since  1994  ADB  has  lent  $84 million for power \nrehabilitation projects in Tajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic and an infrastructure program loan \nin Tajikistan. A total of $6.1 million of TA complemented the loan program. Other major funding \nagencies active in the sector include EBRD, World Bank, and the governments of Japan and the \nUnited  States.  A  list  of  funding  agency  activities  is  included  in  Appendix  4.  The  focus  of  all  of \nthem has been on rehabilitation and power sector reform. In 1999, the World Bank and EBRD \nfinanced the Electricity Transmission Rehabilitation Project in Kazakhstan that aims to improve \nthe reliability of the 500 kV transmission system, modernize the dispatch facilities, and support \nthe  establishment  of  a  national  power  pool.  The  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment (USAID) has provided TA and supported a regional electricity working group that \nresulted  in  the  execution  of  the  parallel  operating  agreement  and  a  body  of  work  on  the \ndevelopment  of  a  regional  power  pool.  Over  the  last  couple  of  years  the  focus  has  been  on \nregional cooperation in water resources that are integral to power sector operations. The Project \nwill  build  on  these  initiatives  and  further  encourage  regional  power  trade  and  cooperation. \nEBRD and the OPEC Fund will provide cofinancing and USAID will provide TA for the Project \n \n18. \nLessons  Learned.  ADB  has  modest  experience  in  the  energy  sector  in  Central  Asia. \nThe  proposed  Project  is  the  first  regional  lending  operation  in  the  power  sector,  but  its  design \ndraws  on  ADB's  experience  in  providing  power  rehabilitation  assistance  to  countries  in \ntransition, including the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Mongolia. ADB projects have had front-\nend delays in implementation due to the governments' unfamiliarity with ADB procedures. This \nwas the case with Loan 1817-TAJ: Power Rehabilitation Project. This should not be a problem \nfor the implementation of the proposed Project since Tajikistan has gained experience with ADB \nprocedures and Uzbekistan has had experience with an EBRD project. Also, the implementation \nschedules in each case allow a reasonable period for procurement activities.  \n \n19. \nADB experience has also shown that it takes considerable time and effort to restructure, \ncorporatize,  and  commercialize  utilities,  and  to  achieve  full  cost  recovery,  especially  in  an \neconomy that is undergoing transition. The Tajikistan Government had difficulty in meeting the \nconditionalities  under  Loan  1651-TAJ:  Postconflict  Infrastructure  Program,  and  had  to  obtain \nwaivers for second tranche release. The reform agenda in the Kyrgyz Republic was also difficult \nand took considerable time. The lesson that conditionalities have to be realistic and reasonable \nhas  been  taken  into  account  in  the  project  agreements.  Finally,  the  experience  with  the  first \n\n\f6 \n\nA. \n\nObjectives \n\nregional  project  in  Central  Asia,  Loan  1774/1775  REG:  Almaty-Bishkek  Regional  Road \nRehabilitation, found that regional agreements take time to ratify and this has been factored into \nthe design of the Project.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\n20. \nThe  strategic  objective  of  the  proposed  Project  is  to  efficiently  meet  the  energy \nrequirements  of  the  Central  Asian  counties  to  support  economic  development.  The  specific \nproject  objective  is  to  improve  the  operation  and  efficiency  of  the  regional  power  transmission \nsystem  and  enhance  economic  power  trade  among  the  Central  Asian  republics.  Under  the \nProject, the focus will be on modernizing the interconnected transmission systems of Tajikistan \nand Uzbekistan and enhancing the power trade relations between them.  \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nThe outputs of the Project are as follows (the technical scope is detailed in Appendix 5): \n\n21. \n \n\n(i) \n\nRehabilitated  500 kV  substations  and  switchgear.  Replace  circuit  breakers \n(500  and  220 kV),  current  and  voltage  transformers,  protection  and  control \nsystems, and the direct current system. In Tajikistan, the rehabilitation work will \ncover the Regar 500/220 kV substation. In Uzbekistan, the rehabilitation work will \ncover  the  500/220 kV  substations  of  Tashkent,  Surkhan,  Lochin,  Guzar,  and \nKarakul, and the switchgear at the power stations of Tashkent, Novo Angren and \nSyr Darya.  \n\nUpgraded dispatch and communications facilities.  Upgrade facilities at UDC, \nNDCs, ADCs, and telecommunications links. Install new remote terminal units in \n500 kV  substations  and  in  major  power  plants.  In  Tajikistan,  the  NDC  and  the \nADCs of Hojent and South regions will be upgraded. In Uzbekistan, the NDC and \nthe ADCs of Fergana, Takhitash, and Samarkand will be upgraded.  \n\nInstall  new  meters \n\ntransborder  metering. \n\ntogether  with  meter \nNew \nmanagement  systems  at  all  control  centers.  In  Tajikistan,  the  installation  will \ninvolve  replacement  of  40  energy  meters,  provision  of  12  sets  of  meter  reading \nequipment, and a metering management system in the NDC. In Uzbekistan, the \ninstallation will involve replacement of 220 energy meters, provision of 40 sets of \nmeter reading equipment, and a metering management system in the NDC.  \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nImproved  policy,  institutional,  and  regulatory  environment.  Implement  the \nRegional  Power  Trade  Action  Plan  and  the  bilateral  Power  Trade  Relations \nAgreement with consulting services support. \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nFoundation for a Future Regional Competitive Power Market  \n\n22. \nThe measures to be implemented and the equipment to be installed under the Regional \nPower  Transmission  Modernization  Project  constitute  an  important  prerequisite  for  the \nenhancement  of  regional  trade  and  the  development  of  a  future  regional  competitive  power \nsystem. The steps required to reach the ultimate long-term goal can best be illustrated through \n\n\f7 \n\nthe  comparison  with  a  no  trade  scenario  and  different  stages  of  trade,  ranging  from  pre-\nindependence times to the long-term objective of a regional power pool system.  \n \n23. \nSoviet-Era  Trade  Scenario.  The  Soviet,  pre-independence  situation  represented \ncomplete integration and the level of trade was much higher than at present. The whole region \nwas operated as a single power exchange zone and, even though dispatch was not according \nto  economic  and  market  principles,  it  was  a  rational  system  in  terms  of  energy  resource \nutilization.  \n \nNo Trade Scenario.  Given  that  peak  electricity  usage  is  time  sensitive  and  the  major \n24. \npopulation  centers  of  the  region  are  spread  over  different  time  zones,  economizing  on  peak \ngeneration capacity alone would provide a strong rationale for energy trade. Trading also allows \nsubstantial economizing on reserve capacity. If no trade were to take place, each country would \nhave  to  provide  its  own  reserve  capacity,  the  sum  of  which  is  much  higher  than  the  reserve \ncapacity of an integrated system. While self-sufficiency in the newly independent republics has \nbeen a policy objective, it is now recognized that the no trade option can only be attained at a \nvery high cost and would confer few, if any, benefits on the country adopting the policy.  \n \n25. \nPresent Trade Scenario.  The present power trade situation is characterized by barter \ndeals and technical dispatch. It is not based on economic considerations. The trade in 2001 is \nshown in Appendix 6. Southern Kazakhstan imports power from Turkmenistan (wheeled through \nUzbekistan) and the Kyrgyz Republic and receives power from north Kazakhstan as well. The \nKyrgyz  Republic  imports  power  from  Uzbekistan  and  Tajikistan  and  exports  power  to \nKazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan (at different times of the year). Tajikistan imports power \nfrom  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Turkmenistan,  and  Uzbekistan  and  exports  power  to  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic  and  Uzbekistan.  Turkmenistan  exports  power  mainly  to  Tajikistan  but  also  small \namounts  to  Kazakhstan  and  Uzbekistan.  The  energy  trade  picture  is  further  complicated  by \nexports and imports of gas for power production and by the inclusion of water for irrigation in the \npresent exchange agreements.  \n \n26.  With-Project Trade Scenario.  Enhanced  power  trade  development  is  the  objective  of \nthe  Project.  This  intermediate  stage  can  be  described  as  voluntary  cross-border trade on the \nbasis  of  genuinely  independent  electricity  utilities  that  are  managed  according  to  economic \nprinciples,  with  no  political  interference.  Barter  trade  would  decline  over  the  transition  period. \nThe Project provides three key building blocks: rehabilitation of substations, augmentation of the \ncontrol systems, and enhanced metering. It will allow better optimization of the control systems \nand  monitoring  of  power  flows.  The  other  key  building  blocks  that  are  key  elements  of  the \nRegional  Power  Trade  Action  Plan \ntransmission \nownership,  open  access  transmission,  more  comprehensive  sales  contracts,  transmis sion \npricing,  voluntary  trading,  a  grid  code,  a  metering  code,  ancillary  services  pricing,  and  hard \ncurrency contracts and settlement. The trading envisaged would be a mixture of long- and short-\nterm contracts between the respective utilities on the basis of mutual economic advantage.  \n \n27. \nRegional Wholesale Market Scenario.  Once voluntary economic trade has been well \nestablished and a substantially enhanced level of regional power trade has been achieved, it will \nbe appropriate to move to the establishment of a regional wholesale power trading pool.  In the \nmedium  term,  it  is  anticipated  that  the  power  sector  in  each  country  of  the  region  will  be  fully \nrestructured  to  achieve  independent  and  commercial  operation.  In  addition,  each  country  will \nhave  fully  unbundled  its  electricity  sector  with  independent  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution. Transmission, distribution, and energy companies will be operationally separate but \nmay still have the same owner. Private sector participation will be a feature providing funding, \nmanagement, and expertise. Indicative levels of trade for 2011 are shown in Appendix 6. \n\nlegal/regulatory  compatibility, \n\ninclude \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nRegional Consensus and Power Trade Action Plan \n\n28. \nGovernment  and  utility  representatives  from  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Tajikistan, \nand  Uzbekistan  attended  a  Regional  Power  Transmission  Meeting  on  22\u201323  April  2002  to \n(i) discuss  the  findings  of  TA  5960-RETA;  (ii) consider  the  recommendations  for  pursuing \nenhanced power trade relations among the Central Asian republics; and (iii) reach a consensus \non  the  way  forward.  The  meeting  agreed  on  a  number  of  time-bound  actions  that  would \nenhance  the  present  power  trading  relations  and  establish  the  foundation  for  the  ultimate \nwholesale  regional  power  market.  The  agreed  action  plan  explicitly  addresses  the  problem \nareas  identified  in  paras.  4  to  11  and  is  presented  in  Appendix  7.  It  covers  the  key  areas  of \npolicy  reform  necessary  for  trade,  regional  institutional  arrangements,  technical  investment \nrequirements  and  operating  protocols,  commercial  and  financial  arrangements,  and  individual \ncountry reforms.  The  governments  of  Tajikistan  and  Uzbekistan  have  formally  endorsed  the \naction plan and have committed, as a condition of the loan, to implement the actions within their \ndirect  control  and  to  take  an  active  role  in  the  implementation  of  the  necessary  cooperative \nactions involving other countries.  \n \n29. \nThe governments of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan have further committed, as a condition of \nthe  loan,  to  implement  a  Power  Trade  Relations  Agreement  that  will  enhance  their  bilateral \ntrade relations. The agreement was negotiated in November 2002 and is to be implemented by \n31 December 2003. It involves the following: \n \n\nestablishment  of  a  policy  of  open  access  to  the  transmission  networks  in  each \ncountry; \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\ndevelopment  and  use  of  a  transparent  methodology  for  transmission  tariff \ncalculation including procedures for asset valuation and fair return on capital; \n\nintroduction  of  a  compatible  standard  metering  protocol  that  will  provide  the \nframework for the collection, analysis, and management of power exchanges; \n\ndevelopment  and  use  of  a  pro-forma  contract  to  be  used  for  bilateral  power \ntrading  \n\ndevelopment  and  agreement  on  pricing  arrangements  for  ancillary  services \n(reserve capacity, voltage control, etc.); \n\nresolution  of  all  outstanding  issues  relating  to  the  use,  management,  and \nmaintenance of cross-border transmission facilities; \n\nagreement  on  an  annual  contract  for  power  trade  that  will,  among  other  things, \nconsider the mutually beneficial utilization of and payment for excess hydropower \nenergy; and \n\ninitiation and leadership of a working group with the nonparticipating countries to \ndevelop  the  institutional  framework  for  regional  power  trade  and  support  the \nimplementation of the Regional Power Trade Action Plan. \n\n30. \nCooperation  with  USAID  will  be  important  for  the  implementation  of  the  institutional \naspects  of  the  Project.  USAID  provided  expert  support  in  the  area  of  power  trade  during  the \nprocessing of the Project, and during the negotiation of the Power Trade Relations Agreement. \nA  5-year  program  of  assistance  was  prepared  and  covers  the  institutional  support  required  to \n(i) implement  the  Regional  Power  Trade  Action  Plan  including  support  for  intercountry \ninstitutional and technical working groups to prepare necessary protocols to enhance trade and \nultimately  establish  a  wholesale  power  market,  and  (ii) establish  UDC  as  an  independent \n\n\f9 \n\ncommercial  enterprise.  Under  the  program  USAID  has  committed  initially  to  provide  the \ntechnical  support  for  the  implementation  of  the  Power  Trade  Relations  Agreement  and  to \nundertake  a  needs  assessment  of  UDC  to  incorporate  the  monitoring  and  control  of  water \ndispatch as well as electric power dispatch.3 \n\n3. \n\nTechnical Features \n\n31. \nThe  reliability  of  the  500 kV  network  is  a  prerequisite  to  the  development  of  regional \npower  trade\u2014trade  cannot  effectively  take  place  as  long  as  the  system  does  not  have  an \nacceptable  level  of  reliability.  The  existing  grid  is  old  and  the  reliability  is  very  low  due  to \nfrequent  failures  of  equipment.  The  rehabilitation  of  the  major  substation  equipment  within  the \nmain  power  corridors  will  reduce  the  number  of  forced  outages  and  increase  the  amount  of \ndelivered energy. This will benefit both the national and regional power systems. \n\n32. \nUpgrading  the  NDC  and  ADCs  and  associated  telecommunications  is  essential  to \nensure  safe  and  reliable  operation  of  the  national  systems  and  improve  the  reliability  of  the \ninterconnected transmission system with the aim of enhancing regional electricity  trade. Closer \nsupervision of the national network operation and loading as well as monitoring and initiation of \ncorrective  measures  to  comply  with  steady  state  and  dynamic  stability  will  allow  optimal \nutilization of the grid networks and power plants. This will result in a reduction of transmission \nlosses  and  in  fuel  cost  savings  for  thermal  power  plants.  Planning  software  will  allow  the \nnational utilities to adjust the existing automatic schemes, within the stability limits and will better \nenable prevention of the collapse of the whole system in case of major failure. This will benefit \nboth the national and regional power systems. \n\nAccurate and real-time metering at the borders of the national grid and at the interface \n33. \nwith  large  customers  (connected  to  the  transmission  system)  is  essential  for  measuring  and \nbilling purposes and is essential for any development of trade. Improved metering systems will \nallow the introduction of a market for ancillary services, which will enhance regional cooperation \namong the Central Asian republics. It will further resolve disputes over the payment of electricity \ntransfer and, in the long run, introduce savings through improved energy efficiency. \n\n34. \nThe rehabilitation of UDC is necessary to ultimately achieve the full benefit of the Project \nin terms of optimization of regional network operation and reduction of losses. The upgrade of \nUDC  will  allow  real-time,  overall  control  of  the  regional  network.  This  will  permit  a  better \nutilization  of  the  installed  generation  capacity,  reduction  of  fuel  consumption,  as  well  as \nreduction of transmission losses through improved operation of the regional grid network. \n \n\n4. \n\nSupport for the Reconstruction of Afghanistan \n\n35. \nThe Project will facilitate power exchange between the Central Asian power system and \nAfghanistan.  There  exists  a  60 km  double  circuit  110 kV  transmission  line  linking  Kunduz in \nAfghanistan  to  Tajikistan,  and  a  71 km  double  circuit  220 kV  transmission  line  linking  Khulm \nsubstation in Afghanistan to Surkhan substation in Uzbekistan. Electricity exports stopped in the \n1990s due to payment arrears. Limited exports to Afghanistan have recently resumed. There is \nalso long-term potential to export power across Afghanistan to Pakistan. \n \n\n                                                 \n\n3   Depending on the success of the initial work and provided there is continued government commitment, USAID may \n\nconsider continuing support for the program. \n\n\f10 \n\nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n36. \nThe total project cost is estimated at $175.5 million equivalent. The Tajik component is \nestimated  to  cost  $27.0 million  equivalent  (foreign  exchange  cost  $22.4 million  and  local \ncurrency  cost  $4.6 million  equivalent),  and  the  Uzbek  component  $148.0 million  equivalent \n(foreign  exchange  cost  $137.6 million  and  local  currency  cost  $10.4 million  equivalent).  A \nregional technical assistance component will cost $0.5 million.

The  Government  will  relend  the  proceeds  of  the  ADB  loan  to  Barki \nTajik, denominated in local currency, at ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources interest rate applicable \nto  the  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  with  a  repayment  period  of  25  years,  including  a  grace \nperiod of 5 years. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by the Government. Barki Tajik will \nfinance  the  $4.6 million  equivalent  local  currency  cost  of  the  Tajik  component.  Parallel \ncofinancing  of  $2.4 million  for  transmission  rehabilitation  under  the  Tajik  component  will  be \nprovided by the OPEC Fund and is expected to be approved in December 2002. \n \nFor the Uzbek component, the Borrower will be the Republic of Uzbekistan for an ADB \n39. \nloan  of  $70 million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year term, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  a  front-end fee of \n1.0%, and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements. \nThe Government will relend the proceeds of the ADB loan to Uzbekenergo in the same currency \nand on the same terms and conditions as the ADB loan to the Government.  Uzbekenergo will \nfinance $18.6 million of the foreign cost and all the $10.4 million equivalent local currency cost \nof  the  Uzbek  component.  Cofinancing  of  $49.0 million for transmission rehabilitation under the \nUzbek component will be provided by EBRD and is expected to be approved in April 2003. \n \nADB financing of 47% is higher than the current 40% limit for Uzbekistan as a Group C \n40. \ncountry  under  the  graduation  policy  and  is  justified  on  the  following  grounds:  (i) the Project is \nalmost  entirely  foreign  exchange  cost,  (ii) the  ADB  loan  will  finance  only  one  half  of  the  total \nproject  foreign  exchange  requirement,  and  (iii) Uzbekistan  is  facing  a  shortage  of  foreign \nexchange. \n \n41. \nIn  the  cost  estimates,  both  Tajikistan  and  Uzbekistan  have  agreed  to  allocations  of \nfunding for the upgrading of the UDC. However, the use of the allocated funds will be subject to \nUDC  being  reestablished  within  a  new  institutional  framework  acceptable  to  the  other  Central \nAsian countries, and with the agreed participation of these countries. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n42. \nBarki  Tajik  will  be  the  executing  agency  (EA)  responsible  for  overall  supervision  and \ncoordination of the Tajikistan component of the Project. A project implementation unit (PIU) has \nbeen established under Loan 1817-TAJ: Power Rehabilitation Project and will be expanded to \ncover the Project. The PIU will be responsible for day-to-day implementation, including review of \ntender  documents,  bid  evaluation,  and  supervision  of  installation,  as  well  as  the  necessary \nliaison  among  Barki  Tajik,  contractors,  and  ADB.  The  PIU,  which  will  be  supported  by \nimplementation  consultants  financed  under  the  loan,  will  be  staffed  with  suitably  qualified \npersonnel.  A  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  will  also  be  established  to  provide  guidance  to \nthe Project. The PSC will coordinate activities at the government level  and serve as a forum for \ndiscussions  on  important  issues.  The  PSC  will  be  chaired  by  the  Minister  of  Energy  and  its \nmembers  will  include  representatives  from  the  Ministry  of  Energy,  Barki  Tajik,  and  the  PIU \nManager. The PSC will meet when required, but in any event, at least twice a year.  \n \n\n\f12 \n\n43. \nUzbekenergo will be the EA responsible for overall supervision and coordination of the \nUzbek component of the Project. A PIU has been established. The PIU, which will be supported \nby  implementation  consultants  financed  under  the  loan,  will  be  staffed  with  suitably  qualified \npersonnel.  A  PSC  will  also  be  established  to  provide  guidance  to  the  Project.  The  PSC  will \ncoordinate activities at the government level  and serve as a forum for discussions on important \nissues. The PSC will be chaired by the Head, Energy Department, Cabinet of Ministers, and its \nmembers  will  include  representatives  from  the  Energy  Department,  Uzbekenergo,  Ministry  of \nFinance and Ministry of Macroeconomics, and the PIU Manager. PSC will meet when required, \nbut in any event, at least twice a year.  \n \n44. \nFor the implementation of the UDC component, a special PIU will act as EA and consist \nof  representatives  from  each  of  the  regional  utilities.  It  will  also  act  as  a  standardization \ncoordinator  for  functional  requirements  and  the  data  to  be  acquired  as  well  as  ensuring \ncompatibility  of  interfaces  between  dispatching,  communications,  and  metering  the  systems \ninstalled in the individual countries.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n45. \nIt is envisaged that project implementation will start in 2003 and be completed by June \n2006 for Tajikistan and December 2007 for Uzbekistan. Loan closing will be in December 2006 \nand June 2008, respectively. The project implementation schedules are shown in Appendix 9.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n46. \nProcurement of ADB-financed goods and services under the proposed Project, including \ncontracts for the design, supply, installation, and commissioning of the project facilities, will be \ncarried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for  Procurement  through  international \ncompetitive  bidding  (ICB).  A  list  of  the  proposed  procurement  packages,  the  financer  of the \npackage,  and  their  mode  of  procurement  is  attached  as  Appendix  10.  Barki  Tajik  and \nUzbekenergo have agreed to take steps so that bidders, suppliers, contractors, and consultants \nunder contracts financed through the loan observe the highest standards of transparency during \nthe procurement and execution of such contracts. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n47. \nThe services of internationally recruited consulting firms, to be financed by ADB, will be \nrequired  to  provide  project  management  services  and  assistance  to  Barki  Tajik  and \nUzbekenergo in such matters as detailed design, tendering, supervision of installation, testing, \nand  commissioning  of  equipment  and  training  for  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M).  In  each \ncountry,  consultants  will  support  the  PIU  and  will  be  required  to  transfer  project  management \nskills to PIU staff. Outline terms of reference and cost estimates are presented in Appendix 11. \nFor  the  Uzbek  component  the  services  of  an  internationally-recruited  consulting  firm,  to  be \nfinanced by ADB, will  be required to develop a computerized management information system \nfor  effective  management  of  Uzbekenergo  and  its  subsidiary  companies.  Outline  terms  of \nreference  and  cost  estimates  are  presented  in  Appendix  14.  All  consulting  services  under  the \nProject will be recruited in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, using \nquality  and  cost-based  selection  methods  on  the  basis  of  a  full  technical  proposal.  Other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  will  be  used  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants. \nThere will be four contracts in total: (i) 38 person-months of international and 50 person-months \nof local consulting services will be engaged in Tajikistan for transmission rehabilitation, dispatch \nupgrading,  and  UDC;  (ii) 110  person-months of  international  and  130  person-months of local \nconsulting services will be engaged in Uzbekistan for transmission rehabilitation; (iii) 45 person-\n\n\f13 \n\nmonths  of  international  and  50  person-months  of  local  consulting  services  will  be  engaged  in \nUzbekistan  for  dispatch  upgrading,  including  UDC;  and  (iv)  15  person-months of international \nand 30 person-months of local consulting services will be engaged for the development of the \npower sector management information system in Uzbekistan.  \n \n\n5. \n\nRetroactive Financing \n\n48. \nRetroactive  financing  of  reasonable  expenditures  incurred  after  15  November  2002  for \nconsulting  services  was  approved  for  the  Uzbek  component  up  to  a  maximum  of  $500,000. \nSuch  financing  will  facilitate  Project  implementation  prior  to  the  effectiveness  of  the  ADB  and \nEBRD  loans.  The  Government  was  advised  that  approval  of  retroactive  financing  does  not \ncommit ADB to financing of the Project. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n49. \nAll disbursements under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with the ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook. Direct payment procedures will be utilized for the procurement \nand consulting services contracts. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nThere will be continued monitoring and evaluation of project implementation, with timely \n50. \nreporting.  The  EAs  will  prepare  quarterly  reports  on  progress  of  project  implementation  and \nfurnish ADB and cofinancers with copies of these reports. ADB will review implementation of the \nProject on a regular basis, at least once a year, and will monitor overall performance of the EAs. \nWithin 3 months of project completion, the EAs will furnish ADB with a project completion report \ncovering  details  of  implementation  and  other  information  required  by  ADB.  The  EAs  will \nmaintain  separate  records  and  accounts  for  the  Project  and  will  have  the  accounts  audited \nannually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. Copies of audited project accounts will be \nprovided  to  ADB  within  6  months  of  the  end  of  each  relevant  fiscal  year.  The  EAs  will  also \nprovide ADB with copies of its audited corporate accounts within 6 months of the end of its fiscal \nyear.  The  EAs  will  adopt  international  accounting  standards  for  their  financial  reporting.  ADB \ndisbursements  will  be  suspended  if  delays  of  6  months  in  submis sion  of  audited  financial \nstatements occur. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n51. \nThe  EAs  will  carry  out  all  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  activities  of  the  Project. \nThese will be undertaken in accordance with the relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Benefit Monitoring \nand Evaluation: A Handbook for Bank Staff, Staff of Executing Agencies and Consultants. At the \nbeginning  of  project  implementation,  the  EAs  will  submit  to  ADB  a  report  on  the  benchmark \ninformation, to be followed by annual performance reports during project implementation. Upon \nproject  completion,  a  comprehensive  report  will  be  submitted.  In  addition,  3  years  after \ncompletion, the EAs will finance out of their own funds benefit monitoring and evaluation studies \nto assess the overall benefits of the Project. \n \n52. \nAn  integral  component  of  the  project  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  to  assess  over \ntime  the  poverty  reduction  impacts  of  the  Project.  With  support  from  the  implementation \nconsultants,  benchmark  surveys  will  be  undertaken,  and  various  indicators  will  be  formulated \nand then monitored throughout and following project implementation. Trends in electricity use by \ndomestic  consumers  by  income  level,  changes  in  electrical  appliance  ownership,  rural  versus \n\n\f14 \n\nurban  consumption  patterns,  small  enterprise  electricity  use,  and  other  indicators  will  be \nmonitored. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\nregional  policy, \n\nIn  2004,  ADB  will,  together  with  the  EAs,  carry  out  a  midterm  review  of  the  Project, \n53. \nfocusing  on  all \ntechnical, \nenvironmental, social, economic, financial, and other relevant aspects that may have an impact \non  the  performance  of  the  Project  and  its  continuing  viability.  The  review  will  cover  the \nimplementation  of  the  Regional  Power  Trade  Action  Plan  and  the  Power  Trade  Relations \nAgreement. \n \nG. \n\ninstitutional,  administrative,  organizational, \n\nThe Executing Agencies \n\n54. \nThe EAs for the Project will be Barki Tajik in Tajikistan and Uzbekenergo in Uzbekistan. \nEach country is implementing reforms in its power sector and details of the reforms are included \nin Appendix 12. An overview of the EAs is provided below. \n \n\n1. \n\nBarki Tajik \n\n55. \nBarki  Tajik  is  the  state-owned  utility  responsible  for  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution  of  electricity  in  Tajikistan.  Prior  to  the  country\u2019s  independence,  the  entity  was \nadministratively a government agency. In 1992, it became a state joint stock holding company. \nAlthough it is fully owned by the Government, Barki Tajik enjoys autonomous status according \nto its charter. \n \n56. \nUnder  the  present  institutional  arrangements,  Barki  Tajik  consists  of  a  network  of  10 \nsubsidiary power generation companies, 11 subsidiary distribution companies, and 8 supporting \ncompanies  including  a  research  institute  and  construction  companies  (Appendix  13).  The \nchairperson  of  Barki  Tajik,  who  has  overall  responsibility  for  operations,  reports  directly  to  the \nPrime  Minister,  and  is  appointed  by  the  Government  with  no  fixed  term.  The  chairperson  is \nassisted by the first deputy chairperson (chief engineer),  who manages Barki Tajik\u2019s day-to-day \noperations,  and  six  deputy  chairpersons  who  are  in  charge  of  the  technical  departments, \nsupporting services, and subsidiary power generation and distribution companies. Since 1999, \nthe  Government  has  created  business  units  for  some  of  these  subsidiaries,  with  ownership \nrights  vested  directly  in  the  State  Property  Committee  on  behalf  of  the  Government  but  with \nbusiness management responsibilities assigned to Barki Tajik. \n \n57. \nIn  2000,  Barki  Tajik  was  incorporated  as  a  commercial  entity,  and  a  separation  of \noperations  has  taken  place  along  its  business  unit  lines  for  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution,  but  within  the  same  management  control.  As  agreed  under  Loan  1817-TAJ,  the \nEnergy Law was passed setting up the Ministry of Energy as the policy unit of the Government. \nTariffs  are  regulated  by  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF).  Supported  by  ADB  TA,  Barki  Tajik  is \ninternational  accounting  practices4  and  modernized  consumer \ncurrently \naccounting systems and meter reading systems.5 \n \n\nimplementing \n\n                                                 \n\n4  TA  3601-TAJ:  Introducing  International  Accounting  Standards  at  Barki  Tajik ,  for  $500,000,  approved  on  20 \n\n5  TA  3600-TAJ:  Improving  Barki  Tajik\u2019s  Billing  and  Collection  Systems,  for  $500,000,  approved  on  20  December \n\nDecember 2000. \n\n2000. \n\n\f15 \n\na. \n\nPast Financial Performance \n\n58. \nBarki  Tajik's  past  financial  performance  has  been  improving  but  revenues  are  still  only \nsufficient  to  cover  cash  operating  expenses.  Electricity  sales  remained  almost  unchanged  in \n2001 after a sharp decline of 9.5% in 2000, mostly as a result of lack of hydropower generation \n(dry  summer)  and  declining  growth  in  industrial  demand.  Accounts  receivable  remain  a  major \nproblem  despite  a  40%  reduction  between  1999  and  2001.  At  the  end  of  2001,  they  stood at \n$23.3 million  or  equivalent  to  7.5  months  of  gross  billings,  which  exceeds  the  agreed  target \nunder the previous loan of 6 months by December 2001.  \n \n\nb. \n\nFinancial Projections \n\n59. \nCost recovery has been considered in two ways. Under the project  preparatory TA, the \naverage incremental cost of supply was estimated in economic terms to be 2.5 cents/kilowatt-\nhour  (c/kWh)  on  the  basis  of  rehabilitation  of  existing  assets  and  completion  of  an  unfinished \nhydropower  station  to  meet  new  demand.  By  contrast,  the  financial  projections,  with  assets \nrevalued indicatively, indicate that a reasonable level of financial cost recovery based on a 6% \nreturn would require a tariff level of about 2.2 c/kWh at 2002 prices. Therefore, the target level \nfor tariffs over the medium term should be 2.2\u20132.5 c/kWh. \n \n60. \nThe  current  average  tariff  is  0.95  c/kWh.  Under  Loan  1817-TAJ: Power Rehabilitation \nProject,  by  December  2001  industrial  tariffs  were  to  be  increased  to  1.03  c/kWh  to  achieve \n100% cost recovery; this was achieved in April 2002. Domestic tariffs were to be increased to \n$0.75/kWh to achieve 50% cost recovery by December 2002. This will entail an 83% increase \nover  present  levels  and  the  Government  has  notified  ADB  that  it  will  implement  the  same  by \nend-December 2002. The first 150 kWh block of consumption will, however, maintained at 0.18 \nc/kWh to protect low-income consumers.  \n \nIn  addition  to  the  2002  tariff  adjustments,  the  financial  projections  assume  tariff \n61. \nincreases for 2003 onward to maintain the covenanted 90% operating ratio and to achieve a 6% \nrate of return by 2006. Given the large tariff increases in 2002 and the expected negative impact \non  accounts  receivable,  the  current  loan  covenant  for  accounts  receivable  of  3  months  by \nDecember 2002 is now targeted for achievement by December 2004. Due to lower sales than \npreviously projected, the rate of return covenant of 6% on revalued net fixed assets in service \nwill become applicable a year later, i.e., from 2006. \n \n\n2. \n\nUzbekenergo \n\n62. \nUzbekenergo  is  the  state-owned  joint-stock  company  responsible  for  generation, \ntransmission, and distribution of electricity and heat in Uzbekistan. In 2001, it was created out of \nthe  former  power  ministry.  Under  the  present  institutional  arrangement,  Uzbekenergo consists \nof  a  network  of  subsidiary  power  companies,  including  all  power  stations,  the  distribution  and \ntransmission  network,  and  other  energy-related  companies  (the  organizational  chart  is  in \nAppendix 13).  The  Government\u2019s  reform  program  envisages  that all distribution entities will be \nmade  shareholding  companies  by  2003,  followed  by  generation  entities  by  2005.  The \ntransmission network will remain in government hands for the foreseeable future. Only minority \nshareholdings will be offered to the private sector in the thermal generating companies, with the \nmajority  shareholding  remaining  with  the  Government.  Currently,  each  power  station  is \noperating  as  a  separate  legal  entity.  By  the  end  of  2002,  each  distribution  entity  will  operate \nindependently  and  accounting  separation  for  the  transmission  company  is  expected  to  be \nfinalized.  Under  the  Project,  support  will  be  provided  to  develop  a  computerized  management \ninformation  system  for  effective  management  of  the  38  subsidiary  companies.  The  terms  of \n\n\f16 \n\nreference,  cost,  and  equipment  requirements  are  presented  in  Appendix  14.  Support  is  also \nbeing provided by EBRD in the form of a tariff study and the World Bank is to undertake a study \nto consider future power sector restructuring and reform. \n \n\na. \n\nPast Financial Performance \n\n63. \nUzbekenergo has incurred losses for the last 2 years. Electricity sales grew at an annual \naverage rate of only 2% between 1999 and 2001. Accounts receivable, which are one of the key \nconcerns of Uzbekenergo\u2019s operation, increased from 4.4 months to 5.2 months between 1999 \nand  2001.  In  an  operating  environment  of  high  foreign  cost  expenditures  and  local  currency \nrevenues the large depreciation of the currency has severely impacted Uzbekenergo\u2019s finances. \nDespite tariff increases of 40% between 1999 and 2001, currency depreciation of 70% resulted \nin the tariff falling in dollar terms during the period. In this environment, despite subsidized fuel \nprices at only 20% of economic cost, Uzbekenergo\u2019s finances have worsened. \n \n\nb. \n\nFinancial Projections \n\nUnder the project preparatory TA, the average incremental cost of supply was estimated \n64. \nin  economic  terms  to  be  3.0  c/kWh  on  the  basis  of  rehabilitation  of  existing  assets  to  meet \nincreasing  demand.  This  should  be  the  target  level  for  Uzbekenergo's tariffs over the medium \nterm. This is consistent with the financial projections that show that a tariff level of 3.3 c/kWh (in \n2002  prices)  is  required  for  Uzbekenergo  to  achieve  a  6%  return  on  indicatively  revalued  net \nfixed assets.  \n \n65. \nThe  Government  is  committed  to  increasing  tariffs  to  cost-recovery  levels  over  the \nmedium term even as Uzbekenergo faces further cost side pressure as a result of expected gas \nprice  liberalization.  During  2002,  in  quarterly  steps,  the  tariff  has  been  increased  by  56%  to \nachieve  an  average  tariff  level  of  1.1  c/kWh.  Further  tariff  increases  are  planned  for  2003. \nUzbekenergo  is  expected  to  breakeven  in  2003  and  show  profits  from  2004  onward.  The \nfinancial  analysis  shows  that  with  the  proposed  increases,  the  working  ratio  can  be  gradually \nreduced to 70% by 2006 from 111% in 2002. This means that 30% of the annual revenue will be \navailable  over  and  above  cash  operating  costs  for  investment  and  debt  service.  Uzbekenergo \nhas agreed to achieve a working ratio of at  least 90% in 2003, 85% in 2004, 75% in 2005 and \n70%  in  2004  and  onward.  It  has  also  agreed  to  reduce  accounts  receivable  to  an  acceptable \nlevel of 3 months by 31 December 2004. \n\nIII. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\n \n \n\n66. \nThe  project  benefits  and  impacts  have  been  assessed  along  with  the  potential  risks \nassociated with the Project. The integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the \ncosts.  \n \nA. \n\nFinancial and Economic Benefits \n\n67. \nFrom a least-cost perspective, there is no technical alternative to the rehabilitation of the \nhigh-voltage transmission substations because the further deterioration of substation equipment \nwould increasingly make the transmission system unreliable to deliver electricity from the major \ngenerating plants to regional and domestic customers. The automation of dispatch control and \nmetering  are  also  essential  for  the  optimal  operation  of  the  regional  and  the  domestic  power \nsystems and for economic regional trade. To assess the financial and economic benefits of the \n\n\f17 \n\nProject, a viability analysis was undertaken. The analysis and the assumptions are in Appendix \n15 and the results are summarized below. \n \n68. \nFinancial analysis from the perspective of Barki Tajik and Uzbekenergo has been based \non  a  capital  cost  (base  cost  plus  physical  contingencies)  of  $23.6 million  and  $125.1 million, \nrespectively,  over  the  life  of  the  equipment.  As  a  result  of  the  rehabilitation  of  the  500 kV \nsubstations,  forced  outages  are  expected  to  be  reduced  by  an  estimated  45%,  which  will \nprovide  additional  amounts  of  electricity  to  consumers  and  reduced  interruption  to  economic \nactivities.  The  rehabilitation  works  will  also  reduce  the  high  cost  emergency  and  unscheduled \nmaintenance and serious collateral damages (i.e., in case of exploding old equipment damaging \nadjacent equipment) that is presently experienced.  \n \n69. \nLoad dispatch upgrading will result in optimization of power generation and an improved \ndispatch  regime  that  will  increase  the  output  from  hydropower  stations  and  will lead to lower \nspinning  reserve  requirements.  As  a  consequence,  fuel  and  other  variable  costs  for  thermal \npower  stations  will  be  reduced.  A  1%  reduction  for  fuels  and  a  0.5%  reduction  in  variable \noperating costs are expected. As a result of improved power  system control, it is estimated that \noutages  can  be  further  reduced  by  25%.  More  equal  loading  of  the  entire  system  leads  to \nreduced  losses  in  the  transmission  system.  A  6%  reduction  has  been  assumed.  Finally,  new \nfiber  optic  communications  lines  will  reduce  telephone  costs  and  even  provide  revenues  from \nthe rent of communications links to telephone companies. \n \n70. \nReduced  outages  and  transmission  losses  were  valued  at  the  average  financial \nelectricity tariff projected to increase in real terms in line with the financial projections. On this \nbasis, and after allowance for adequate O&M costs and income tax, the financial internal rate of \nreturn for the Tajikistan and Uzbekistan components of the Project is estimated to be 7.0% and \n11.3%, respectively, which, when compared with an estimated weighted average cost of project \ncapital  of  about  4%,  indicates  that  the  Project  should  be  financially  viable  for  both  the \nparticipating  utilities.  Financial  viability  depends  mainly  on  tariff  reform  and  will  be  able  to \nwithstand variations in capital cost and the level of benefits. \n \n71. \nThe viability of the Project was analyzed from a broader national perspective in terms of \nits  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR).  The  financial  costs  were  adjusted  to  reflect  the \neconomic opportunities forgone and realized on account of the Project. The capital cost for the \nTajikistan  and  Uzbekistan  components  of  $23.2 million  and  $118.7 million, respectively, were \nused. Reduced outages were valued at a conservative value of energy not served of 20.0 c/kWh \nand transmission loss reduction on the basis of willingness to pay (estimated for Tajikistan and \nUzbekistan  to  be  5.0  c/kWh  and  4.5  c/kWh,  respectively).  On  this  basis,  the  EIRRs  for  the \nTajikistan  and  Uzbekistan  components  of  the  Project  are  estimated  to  be  30.0%  and  24.2%, \nrespectively.  \n \n72. \nThe  results  of  a  sensitivity  analysis  show  that  even  with  adverse  changes  in  the  key \nassumptions, the Project remains financially and economically viable. The analysis shows that \nfor Tajikistan and Uzbekistan the benefits (in terms of value or quantity) would have to be 66% \nand  53%  less,  respectively,  or  the  capital  cost  would  have  to  be  147%  and  104%  more, \nrespectively, before the EIRR would fall to the ADB\u2019s minimum cutoff value of 12%. \n \nB. \n\nRegional Benefits of Trade  \n\n73. \nThe  foregoing  viability  analysis  considered  the  Project  benefits  for  Tajikistan  and \nUzbekistan, excluding the benefits of increased trade. Increased power trade facilitated by the \nProject would yield substantial additional benefits. Benefits result from a number of factors that \n\n\f18 \n\ncan  be  grouped  into  two  categories:  (i) reduced  operating  costs  and  (ii) lower  generation \ncapacity and expansion requirements.  \n \n74. \nLower  overall  generation  costs  will  result  from  increased  trade.  This  is  of  particular \nimportance in Central Asian countries where there are huge hydropower resources available in \ncertain  countries  (the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan),  while  other  countries  (Kazakhstan, \nTurkmenistan,  and  Uzbekistan)  have  immense  reserves  of  fossil  fuels.  The  two  complement \neach  other  to  achieve  least-cost  generation.  Also,  by  working  as  one  large  integrated  system, \noperating  costs  can  be  reduced  as  a  consequence  of  reduced  individual  spinning  reserve \nrequirements, the joint provision of and exchange of ancillary services, the possibility to support \nand  better  supply  loads  at  the  periphery  of  an  individual  system,  and  generally  an  increased \nservice  quality  and  reliability  standards  of  power  supply.  The  feasibility  study  consultants \nestimated  that  these  benefits  would  be  in  the  order  of  $25\u201330 million  per  year  by  2011, \nassuming that power would be supplied from the low-cost generation (hydropower) countries to \nthe other countries. \n \n75. \nReduced capacity requirements result, since reserve capacities can be used jointly and \nthus  the  total  installed  reserve  capacity  can  be  lower.  Pooling  of  reserve  capacities  makes  it \npossible  to  reduce  future  expansion  of  power  system  generation  and  reduce  total  capital \nrequired for new power stations. Moreover, for future expansion planning it will also be possible \nto  coordinate  power  system  expansion  planning  and  take  advantage  of  economies  of  scale \nthrough  the  installation  of  large  generation  units  that  would  not  be  viable  in  the  individual \nsystems. Finally, lower capacity requirements can also result from the fact that peak load hours \nslightly  differ  amongst  the  Central  Asian  countries.  It  is  thus  possible  to  improve  the  overall \nsystem load factor and equalize the daily load  curve. The feasibility consultants estimated that \nwith trade, by 2011, 900 MW of additional capacity could be avoided, the fixed cost savings of \nwhich would be about $40 million per year. \n \nBoth Tajikistan and Uzbekistan would enjoy a share of the above benefits. In the short \n76. \nterm the benefits of enhanced trade were estimated on the basis that agreement is reached for \nUzbekistan  to  import  the  surplus  summer  energy  available  from  the  Nurek  power  station  in \nTajikistan, on average 1,000 GWh per year as envisaged in the bilateral Power Trade Relations \nAgreement.  Instead  of  spilling  and  wasting  this  water,  as  at  present,  the  net  economic  benefit \nthat  could  be  shared  by  both  countries  is  estimated  at  $12 million based on 1.2 c/kWh. The \nbenefit  is  calculated  as  avoided  generation  costs  (fuel  and  variable  cost)  to  Uzbekistan  of  1.9 \nc/kWh less transmission cost of 0.5 c/kWh and the negligible Tajik generation cost of 0.2 c/kWh. \nThe  share  of  the  benefit  will  be  based  on  the  price  agreed.  The  upper  bound  price  that \nUzbekistan  could  pay  is  1.65  c/kWh  and  the  lower  bound  price  that  Tajikistan  could  accept  is \n0.45 c/kWh, assuming transmission costs are equally shared. This gives a clear demonstration \nof  the  potential  benefits  of  trade  and  would,  if  included  in  the  foregoing  viability  analysis, \nsignificantly enhance returns. \n \nC. \n\nSocial and Poverty Impact \n\nThe primary beneficiaries of the Project will be business enterprises and the population \n77. \nwho  will  benefit  from  improved  quality  of  electricity  services  and  the  long-term cost reductions \nresulting  from  the  economic  dispatch  of  power  plants  and  the  overall  efficiency  gains  from \nenhanced  power  trade.  Since  effectively  all  the  population  of  both  Tajikistan  and  Uzbekistan \nhave access to electricity, the project benefits will be universal.  \n \n78. \nElectricity supply is a prerequisite for improving the economic situation and quality of life, \nas it is required for agriculture (irrigation and drainage), drinking water supply, health, education, \n\n\f19 \n\nindustry,  and  small-scale  enterprises.  Adequate  and  reliable  power  supply  will  remove  an \nimportant  obstacle  to  investment  and  facilitate  operation  of  private  enterprises.  Agriculture  will \nbenefit  due  to  improved  irrigation  and  drainage.  Direct  and  indirect  health  benefits  include \n(i) improved drainage that will reduce the risks from malaria, and saline water in farmland and \nwater  tables;  (ii) improved  water  supply  through  use  of  electric  pumps;  and  (iii) ability  to  boil \nwater  efficiently  thus  reducing  risks  from  unsafe  water.  Provision  of  lighting  and  heating  in \nschools will improve the education facilities and increase school enrollment. \n \n79. \nIn  terms  of  poverty  impact,  the  difference  between  the  financial  and  economic  net \npresent  values,  and  consequent  gains  and  losses  for  different  stakeholders,  provide  the  basis \nfor  considering  the  impact  of  the  Project  on  the  poor.  For  the  poverty  impact  assessment,  the \nproject beneficiaries are divided into three groups: utility, consumers, and government economy. \nThe net economic benefits of the latter two groups are distributed between poor and nonpoor. \nThe  increased,  more  efficient,  and  reliable  electricity  supply  resulting  from  the  Project  will \nbenefit the poor directly and indirectly. Net economic benefits accruing to the poor over the life \nof  the  Project  are  estimated  at  about  $46 million\u2013$17 million  for  Tajikistan  and  $29 million for \nUzbekistan (Appendix 15). These estimates are conservative as the benefits of trade and some \nindirect  economic  and  social  benefits  are  not  considered.  The  poverty  impact  ratio,  which \nexpresses  the  proportion  of  net  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  accruing  to  the  poor,  is \nestimated  at  41%\u201357%  for  Tajikistan  and  35%  for  Uzbekistan.  Hence,  a  substantial  portion  of \nthe project benefits will go to the poor.  \n \n80. \nUnder the project preparatory TA, a social assessment was carried out and a summary \nof  the  assessment  is  in  Appendix  16.  The  assessment  found  that  the  risk  of  negative \nsocioeconomic impacts is small or nonexistent. The main conclusions are as follows:  \n \n\nIn terms of output-using employment, it is expected that the improved adequacy \nand  reliability  of  electricity  supply  will  support  the  creation  of  new  employment \nopportunities  in  terms  of  higher  productivity  for  all  sectors  of  the  economy. In \nUzbekistan, 6,000 output-using jobs are expected to be created, and in Tajikistan \nthe number is expected to be 2,200. \n\nThere  will  only  be  a  small  direct  input-supplying  employment  impact  since  the \nProject  involves  relatively  few  civil  works  and  the  expertise  required  for  the \ninstallation of the new equipment is unavailable in either country.  \n\nGender inequality was identified in terms of poverty incidence and wage levels. It \nis  expected  that  the  Project\u2019s  poverty  impact  will  be  greater  for  men  than  for \nwomen  since  men  are  expected  to  be  in  a  better  position  to  take  advantage  of \nemployment opportunities as a result of a more reliable power supply.  \n\nAffordability of electricity tariffs is a potential issue that needs to be considered as \nincreases are  implemented  to  cover  the  cost  and  ensure  sustainable  supply  of \nelectricity.  Tajikistan  maintains  a  lifeline  tariff  and  the  EBRD  tariff  study  will \nconsider the tariff levels for each consumer category in Uzbekistan.  \n\nThere  will  be  no  issues  of  resettlement  or  indigenous  peoples  since  the \nrehabilitation and upgrading activities will be undertaken in existing facilities. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\nD. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n81. \nThe  Project  will  have  considerable  environmental  benefits  as  a  result  of  more  optimal \nsystem  operation,  transmission  loss  reduction,  and  substitution  of  thermal  generation  with \nrenewable  hydropower  as  a  result  of  enhanced  power  trading.  It  is  estimated  that  the  energy \nsavings as a result of efficiency improvements alone in 2011 will be 330 GWh and the direct fuel \nsavings 274,000 tons of coal equivalent. \n \n82. \nThe  Project  is  not  expected  to  have  any  major  adverse  impact  on  the  environment.  It \nconsists entirely of rehabilitation of existing structures and facilities. The rehabilitation includes \nreplacing switchgear and transformers at existing substations and retrofitting new components \nto  existing  equipment.  The  Project  has  been  classified  as  Category  B  in  ADB\u2019s  environmental \nclassification system. An initial environmental examination was undertaken according to ADB\u2019s \nguidelines at the feasibility study stage (Appendix 17).  \n \n83. \nThe  adverse  impacts  of  the  Project  will  be  very  small,  and  will  be  limited  to  the \nconstruction period. During the stringing of the new optical ground wire, trucks and equipment \nneed access over the whole route of the transmission line, i.e., over 1,000 km in Uzbekistan and \nabout  300 km  in  Tajikistan.  Special  arrangements  have  to  be  made  in  order  to  minimize  the \nimpacts  on  agriculture,  such  as  seasonal  implementation  schedule,  crops  compensation \nmechanisms,  stringing  under  tension,  etc.  The  following  waste  volumes  are  estimated  to  be \ngenerated:  (i) 26  tons  of  aluminum,  (ii) 601  tons  of  steel,  (iii) 625  tons  of  ceramic  insulators, \n(iv) 94  tons  of  insulation  oil,  and  (v) 125  tons  of  copper.  Additional  chemical  products  such  as \nlead,  acid,  and  electrochemical  condensers  will  be  disposed  from  the  rehabilitation  of  control \nand protection system as well as from the direct current system, especially from the batteries. \nThe ceramic wastes will be disposed in landfills. The insulation oil will be cleaned and filtered, \nand partly reused or sold as fuel oil. Lead, steel, aluminum, and copper will be sold. Acid and \nother  chemical  components  will  be  conditioned  and  sent  to  specialized  laboratories. Adverse \nimpacts  can  be  readily  mitigated  through  good  engineering  and  construction  practices.  No \nnegative impact will persist during the operation phase. The governments and EAs have agreed \nto undertake necessary mitigative measures during optical ground wire stringing and to remove \nand  dispose  of  all  waste  materials  associated  with  the  Project,  in  a  safe  and  environmentally \nresponsible manner. An environmental monitoring program will be prepared and implemented. \n \nE. \n\nProject Risks \n\nThe Project has been formulated to minimize potential technical and economic risks. The \n\n84. \nmain risks are identified and discussed below. \n \n85. \nPolitical  Commitment.  Active  involvement  of  participating  countries  and  continued \ncommitment  to  improve  energy  supply  services,  energy  trade  and  to  resolve  the  energy-water \nnexus will be key to maximizing the benefits of the Project. ADB\u2019s continued engagement with \nthe cooperating countries and active role in regional cooperation as an honest broker will help \nfacilitate improved regional relations for the benefit of all the countries. In the event that regional \ntrade  does  not  achieve  expectations,  the  Project  investments  will  remain  viable,  as  they  have \nbeen shown to be fully justified on the basis of the domestic benefits alone. \n \n86. \nFinancial Sustainability. For the utilities to be able to provide counterpart contributions \nand  meet  ongoing  O&M  costs  requires  financial  viability.  This  implies  that  tariffs  need  to  be \nadjusted to allow the utilities to (i) fully recover operating costs and earn a reasonable return on \ncapital, and (ii) generate sufficient revenue to cover the contribution to the Project and to meet \n\n\f21 \n\ndebt  service  requirements.  In  addition,  the  utilities  have  to  improve  collection  performance. \nFinancial covenants have been agreed to mitigate this risk. \n \n87. \nProject  Delay.  There  is  risk  of  project  delays  due  to  (i) the  nature  of  rehabilitation \nprojects  and  since  they  will  be  implemented  at  several  locations  in  parallel,  and  (ii) lack  of \nexperience  with  ADB  procurement  under  ICB  and  ADB\u2019s  procurement  procedures.  The  risk  of \nproject delays would be actively managed through close monitoring of implementation progress \nby  the  PIU,  which  will  be  assisted  by  experienced  international  consultants,  training in ADB\u2019s \nprocurement and disbursement procedures, and regular ADB review missions. \n \n88. \nCost Overruns. The risk of cost overruns due to (i) uncertainties in the precise scope of \nrehabilitation and upgrading work, and (ii) possible increases in inflation, is modest. The use of \nICB  for  procurement  under  all  contracts  funded  by  the  ADB  will  minimize  the  risk  of  cost \noverruns, as will the use of turnkey contracts. Finally, the physical and price contingencies are \ndesigned to allow for uncertainties in project scope and in inflation. \n \n89. \nInadequate Plant Maintenance. Several measures have been included in the design of \nthe Project to reduce the potential risks of inadequate plant care and maintenance, which has \nbeen  a  problem  in  the  past.  An  on-the-job  training  component  has  been  included  in  each \ncontract  package  to  provide  exposure  to  the  proper  O&M  procedures  for  the  new  and \nrehabilitated  equipment.  International  consultants  will  also  provide  training  and  O&M  support \nduring  implementation  of  the  Project  so  that  the  rehabilitated  and  modernized  facilities  will  be \nmanaged properly after commissioning.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  governments  and  EAs  have  given  the \n\n90. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n91. \n \n\nTrade Enhancement.

The EAs will take all necessary measures including tariff adjustment \n\n92. \nto comply with the following financial covenants:  \n \n\nachieve a working ratio of no more than 90% in 2003, 85% in 2004, 75% in 2005 \nand 70% from 2006 onward for Uzbekenergo;  \n\nachieve a rate of return on net fixed assets in service of at least 6% from 2006 \nonward for Barki Tajik;  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n\f22 \n\n \n93. \n \n\n \n94. \n \n\n(iii)  maintain  accounts  receivable  at  no  more  than  3  months  of  billings  by  31 \n\nDecember 2004 onward for both Barki Tajik and Uzbekenergo; and \n\n(iv)  maintain  net  revenues  at  a  level  that  will  produce  internally  generated  funds \nequal  to  at  least  1.3  times  the  maximum  debt  service requirement  \u2013  this  is  to \napply to both Barki Tajik and Uzbekenergo. \n\nGovernance. The governments will ensure that: \n\nthe EAs will provide adequate funds for independent annual audits, acceptable to \nADB, for project accounts and corporate accounts; and \n\nif  the  EAs  undergo  any  major  reorganization  or  privatization  during  the  term  of \nthe loan, the concerned government, the EA and ADB will review the terms of the \nADB  loan  agreement  with  a  view  to  making  any  amendments  that  may  be \ndeemed necessary. \n\nEnvironment and Safety Measures. The governments will ensure that:  \n\nthe Project is carried out, and all Project facilities are operated and maintained, in \naccordance  with  the  existing  laws,  regulations,  and  standards  of  the  relevant \ngovernment  concerning  environmental  protection  and  ADB's  environmental \nguidelines, \nfor  Selected \nInfrastructure Projects; \n\nin  particular,  ADB's  Environmental  Guidelines \n\neach EA takes all necessary measures to handle and dispose of, in a safe and \nenvironmentally  responsible  manner,  all  discarded  materials  and  all  hazardous \nwaste materials associated with the Project; \n\neither they or the EAs will provide for adequate funds annually for O&M and will \noperate  and  maintain  the  project  facilities  in  accordance  with  all  national safety \nand  O&M  guidelines  and  also  those  identified  by  the  project  implementation \nconsultants, \nrehabilitation,  and \nmaintenance  materials  to  prevent  contamination  of  soil  and  water  with  fuel  and \nlubricants; and \n\nincluding  safe  storage  of  construction, \n\n(iv) \n\nproject activities will not include any land acquisition or resettlement. \n\nBenefit  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  The  EAs  will  carry  out  benefit  monitoring  and \n\n95. \nevaluation of the Project in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines. \n \nB. \n\nConditions of Loan Effectiveness \n\nIn addition to the standard conditions, the following further conditions for effectiveness of \n\n96. \nthe Loan Agreements, have been incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nthe bilateral Power Trade Relations Agreement with the provisions listed  in para. \n29 must have been signed; \n\nsubsidiary  loan  agreements,  satisfactory  to  ADB,  will  have  been  delivered  on \nbehalf  of  the  governments  and  the  respective  EAs,  and  will  be  fully  binding, \nsubject only to the effectiveness of the ADB Loan Agreement;  \n\n(iii) \n\nin  the  case  of  the  Uzbek  component,  the  funds  required  under  the  EBRD  loan \nmust have been obtained; and \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n\f23 \n\n(iv) \n\na  cross  effectivity  provision  is  included  under  both  components,  so  that  for  one \nloan to become effective, the other must as well.  \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n\n97. \nADB and recommend that the Board approve \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nthe  loan  of  $70,000,000  to  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  for  the  Regional Power \nTransmission  Modernization  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary capital resources with \ninterest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; \na term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft \nLoan and Project Agreements presented to the Board; and \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to 15,133,000 Special Drawing Rights  \nto the Republic of Tajikistan for the Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \nwith an interest charge at the rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8 \nyears;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance \nwith  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and Project Agreements presented to the \nBoard; and \n\nthe administration by ADB of the loan in an amount of $2,400,000 to the Republic \nof Tajikistan for the Project to be provided by the OPEC Fund. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n22 November 2002 \n\nTADAO CHINO \nPresident \n\n\f24           Appendix 1 \n\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \n\nPerformance Targets \n\nMonitoring Mechanism \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\nNational statistics \n\nCountry and sector review \nmissions \n\nProject review missions  \n\nPolicy dialogue with \ngovernment agencies \n\nUnified dispatch center and \nnational dispatch centers \nstatistics \n\nStatistics from ministries, \nutilities, energy market \nmanagement organizations, \nand regulatory commissions \nin the individual countries \n\nProject review missions  \n\n\u2022  Quarterly progress reports \nprepared by the consultants \n\nProject review missions  \n\nTaking over certificates \nprepared by the consultant \nfor respective contract \npackages \n\nProject completion report \n\n1.

This transmission system was built up starting in the 1960s up to the dissolution of the \nSoviet  Union  in  1991,  without  any  consideration  of  the  borders  of  the  five  states  and  based \npurely on output maximization. The system consists of 3,770 kilometers (km) of 500 kilovolt (kV) \nlines,  16,200  km  of  220  kV  and  41,820  km  of  110  kV  lines.  The  installed  capacity  of \ntransformers in the substations of 110 kV voltage level and above amounts to more than 62,000 \nmegavolt-amperes (MVA), including 17,170 MVA at 500 kV substations and 22,300 MVA at 220 \nkV substations. \n \n2. \nThe  majority  of  the  transmission  lines  are  single  circuit  lines.  For  reliability  reasons \nvarious 500 kV and 220 kV ring configurations have been formed to avoid interruption of power \nsupply in case of an outage of a single section. There were plans for more 500 kV and 220 kV \nlines to complete further ring schemes but since the dissolution of the Soviet Union none have \nbeen  built.  Although  to  some  extent  the  220  kV  system  can  take  over  load  from  the  500  kV \nsystem  in  the  event  of  its  outage,  there  are  still  various  sections  which  do  not  have  sufficient \ncapacity  to  cope  with  these  situations.  During  such  events,  partial  or  total  black-outs  of  the \nelectrical system have been recorded. The present condition of the electrical equipment in the \nsubstations  in  all  countries,  except  for  Kazakhstan,  requires  rehabilitation  and  substantial \nreplacement  at  all  voltage  levels.  Most  of  the  equipment  has  already  reached  the  end  of  its \ntechnical service life.  \n \n3. \nTotal installed generation capacity amounts to close to 25,000 megawatt (MW), of which \n9,000  MW  is  hydro  power  plants  (37%)  and  around  16,000  MW  thermal  power  plants  (63%). \nThe major hydro power plants are located in Kyrgyz Republic (2,950 MW hydro capacity) and in \nTajikistan  (4,021  MW  hydro  capacity)  whereas  the  major  thermal  power  plants  are  located  in \nUzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. Many of the power plants were constructed as long \nago  as  in  the  1950s  and  1960s,  with  no  major  overhaul  since  then,  and  so  have  reached the \nend of their technical service lives.  \n \nB. \n\nKazakhstan \n\n \n4. \nThe electrical network of Kazakhstan consists of two parts. The northern grid is part of \nthe Russian Federation, and the southern grid is part of the Central Asia Power System. A 500 \nkV single circuit line connects the northern and southern grids, which frequently shows stability \nproblems. The entire system comprises around 23,500 km of 1,150 kV, 500 kV, 330 kV and 220 \nkV  transmission  lines  as  well  as  three  1,150  kV  and  fifteen  500  kV  substations.  Moreover,  it \nincludes  around  440,000  km  of  power  lines  below  the  220  kV  level.  In  South  Kazakhstan,  the \ngrid consists of four 500/220 kV substations and about 1,080 km of 500 kV and 1,300 km of 220 \nkV transmission lines. The southern grid in Kazakhstan has an installed generation capacity of \n2,422 MW, of which 2,058 MW is thermal and 364 MW hydro plants. Total installed generation \ncapacity  in  Kazakhstan  is  around  16,000  MW  (2,057  MW  hydro,  8,100  MW  conventional \nthermal  and  5,622  MW  combined  heat  and  power  (CHP)  plants).  75%  of  the  thermal  power \nplants are coal fired plants, the rest uses oil and gas.  \n \n \n\n\fAppendix 2           27 \n\nC. \n\nKyrgyz Republic \n\n \n5. \nThe electrical network in Kyrgyz Republic is connected by 500 kV and 220 kV lines with \nthe  grids  of  Kazakhstan  and  Uzbekistan. The system in the country includes about 540 km of \n500 kV and 1,250 km of 220 kV transmission lines. Apart from two CHP stations in Bishkek (742 \nMW)  and  Osh  (50  MW),  the  electricity  supply  system  of  Kyrgyz  Republic  depends  on \nhydropower  as  its  primary  energy  source.  Total  installed  generation  capacity  is  about  3,742 \nMW, of which almost 3,100 MW is presently available. \n \nD. \n\nTajikistan \n\n \nThe  HV  transmission  system  in  Tajikistan  consists  of  a  northern  and  a  southern  part \n6. \nwhich are connected only indirectly through the Uzbekistan system. Tajikistan is also connected \nwith  Afghanistan  via  a  110  kV  transmission  line  operated  at  35  kV.  Total  lengths  of  the \ntransmission lines are 300 km and 1,200 km for the 500 kV and 220 kV systems respectively. In  \naddition,  about  2,800  km  of  110  kV  transmission  lines  is  in  operation.  Tajikistan\u2019s  generation \ncapacity  currently  consists  of  4,021  MW  of  hydro  capacity  and  a  300  MW  CHP  plant  in \nDushanbe. The output of the CHP plant is currently severely limited because of fuel shortages. \n \nE. \n\nUzbekistan \n\n \n7. \nThe network of Uzbekistan is the main part of the Central Asia network supply linking the \nsystems  of  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Tajikistan  and  Turkmenistan.  The  HV  transmission \nsystem consists primarily of some 1,700 km of 500 kV and 5,100 km of 220 kV lines. Uzbekistan \nhas a 220 kV transmission connection to Afghanistan. Uzbekistan also represents close to 50% \nof  the  generation  capacity  of  the  joint  Central  Asian  system  (11,600  MW  of  25,000  MW).  It \nincludes 9,873 MW of thermal and 1,705 MW of hydro plants. Of this installed capacity, around \n8,400 MW of thermal power and 1,400 MW of hydropower are actually available for generation. \n \nF. \n\nTurkmenistan \n\n \n8. \nThe electrical network of Turkmenistan is connected with the network of Uzbekistan by \ntwo  transmission  lines,  one  of  500  kV  and  the  other  220  kV.  Turkmenistan  uses  only  thermal \npower plants with an installed capacity of 2,600 MW, of which presently only around 1,500 MW \nis available for operation. \n \n\n\f28           Appendix 3 \n\nEffects\n\nCauses\n\nPROBLEM ANALYSIS\n\nLimited Economic\nDevelopment and\nPoverty Reduction\n\nEnergy Losses &\nHigh Operation Cost\n\nLost Economic\nTrading\nOppurtunities\n\nNegative\nEnvironmental\nImpact\n\nPower Outages &\nUnserved Energy\n\nCore Problem\n\nSuboptimal\nRegional Power\nSystem Operation\n& Trade\n\nPolicy, Legal and\nRegulatory\nConstraints\n\nRegional\nCoordination and\nInstitutional\nProblems\n\nTransmission\nSystem Technical\nProblems\n\nPricing Problems\n\nSelf Sufficiency\n\nLack of Independence\n\nObsolete and Old\n\nNoneconomic\n\nCurrency Exchange\n\nPolicies\n\nof UDC\n\nEquipment\n\nPricing of Fuels\n\nEnergy Water Nexus\n\nFinancial Mgt.\n\nSuboptimal Operation\n\nLow End-User Tariffs\n\nProblems\n\nin Each Country\n\nLack of Enforcement\n\nInappropriate\n\nWater Energy\n\nBarter Trade\n\nof Grid\n\nInadequate\n\nMaintenance\n\nVarying Stages of\n\nHuman Resource\n\nValuing of Ancilliary\n\nInadequate Metering\n\nPayment/\nSettlement\nProblems\n\nProblems\n\nArrears\n\nProblem\n\nServices\n\nCharges\n\nSetting of Wheeling\n\nof Contracts\n\nOperating Regime\n\nSector Restructuring\n\nConstraints\n\nLack of Free Access\n\nto Transmission Lines\n\nLack of Regulatory\n\nEntities\n\nUDC=Unified Dispatch Center\n\n \n\n\fEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE \n\nAppendix 4           29 \n\n \n \n \n\nKazakhstan\n\nKyrgyz Republic\n\nTajikistan\n\nTurkmenistan\n\nRegional\n\nCountry\n\nAsian Development Bank\nProject/TA Name\n\nNo.\n\nExternal Funding Agencies\n\nAmount Approval\n\n($ m)\n\nDate\n\nTA 2262 Almaty Air Quality Study\nTA 2366 Rehabilitation and Environmental Improvement \n\n        \n        \n\n0.10\n0.56\n\nDec-94\nJul-95\n\nof the Almaty No. 1 Heat and Power Station\n\nWorld Bank provided financing for an electricity \ntransmission rehabilitation project with cofinancing \nby EBRD.\n\nTA3674 Energy Sector Study\n\n        \n        \n\n0.25\n0.90\n\nJun-01\n\nTA 2542 Revaluation and Tariff Study for Kyrgyz National \n\n        \n\n0.31\n\nMar-96\n\nEnergy Holding Company (KNEHC)\n\nWorld Bank cofinanced the Power and District \nHeating Rehabilitation Project with ADB.\n\n  \n\nLN 1443 Power and District Heating Rehabilitation\n\nJun-96\n\n        \n      \n      \n\n0.31\n30.00\n30.00\n\nTA 3207 Power Sector Development\n\n        \n\n0.85\n\nJun-99\n\nTA 3600 Improving Barki Tajik's Billing and Collection \n\n        \n\n0.50\n\nDec-00\n\nTA 3601 Introducing International Accounting Standards \n\n        \n\n0.50\n\nDec-00\n\nSystem\n\nat Barki Tajik\n\nIDB and Switzerland provided cofinancing for the \nPower Rehabilitation Project.

Subsequently, an \nenergy  sector  action  plan  was  formulated  with  assistance  from  ADB  and  is  presently  under \nimplementation.  It  provided  for  an  Energy  Law  and  the  establishment  of  a  Ministry  of  Energy. \nThe  Law  on  Energy  Sector  was  passed  in  October  2000,  and  the  Ministry  of  Energy  was \nestablished  in  December  of  the  same  year.  Implementing  regulations  for  the  Energy  Law  are \npresently being prepared. The setting up of an Anti-Monopoly Committee with powers for tariff \nsetting  and  licensing,  is  envisaged.  Tariff  reform  to  achieve  cost  recovery  levels  is  being \nimplemented. Barki Tajik, a state-owned enterprise, is responsible for running the power sector \noperations  and  the  Ministry  of  Energy  is  responsible  for  policy.  Plans  to  unbundle  and \ncommercialize Barki Tajik provide that the 12 regional electricity joint-stock companies are to be \naggregated into two to four enterprises. The current organization makes no distinction between \ntransmission and distribution. There are no plans to privatize existing generation stations, which \nwill remain bundled with transmission. \n \nB. \n \nIn  Uzbekistan,  Decree  No.  UP-2812,  of  22  February,  2001,  creates  a  Uzbekenergo \n2. \nsubsidiary enterprise, UzelectroSet for high-voltage transmission. There are also provisions for \nfuture  unbundling  of  combined  heat  and  power  companies  and  regional  electricity distribution \ncompanies. The Decree also provides for Uzbekenergo  to retain controlling blocks of shares in \nall power generation, transmission, and distribution joint-stock companies that may be set up in \nthe future. Plans for future industry structure call for the gradual corporatization of the thermal \npower  plants  and  regional  distribution  networks.  Up  to  49%  of  the  capital  of  the  corporate \nentities  will  be  offered  to  investors;  75%  of  the  shares  of  enterprises  involved  in  design,  civil \nworks,  and  maintenance  formerly  under  the  Ministry  will  be  sold,  the  assets  and  operating \nresponsibility  of  the  heat-only  plants  will  be  transferred  to  local  governments,  and  the  social \ninfrastructure  facilities  of  Uzbekenergo  to  be  privatized  will  be  listed.  Components  of  the \nelectricity  system  that  will  remain  state  owned  include  all  the  hydropower  plants,  the  energy \nnetwork  communications  system,  the  transmission  grid  (UzelectroSet)  and  UzEnergoSbyt,  an \naffiliated company of Uzbekenergo that will handle commercial transactions between generation \nand  distribution  as  well  as  export  sales  on  a  nonprofit basis.  Implementation  began  on  1  July \n2001  with  the  objective  of  achieving  partial  privatization  by  2005  for  generation  and  2003  for \ndistribution. The aim is to develop a market for electricity along the lines of that in Kazakhstan.  \n \n\nUzbekistan \n\n\f46           Appendix 13 \n\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PROJECTIONS \n\nBarki Tajik \n\nA. \n \n1. \nThe  financial  statements  of  Barki  Tajik  are  presented  in  Table  A13.1  to  A13.3.  Figures  for \n1999\u20132001  are  based  on  actual  operations  while  those  for  2002\u20132010  are  projections  based  on \nnotes and assumptions described below. \n\nPrices, Inflation, and Exchange Rate \n\n2. \nPrices  in  dollar  terms  are  assumed  to  increase  in  accordance  with  international  inflation  at \n2.4% per annum.

Energy sales are estimated to grow at a rate of 1.5% between 2002 and 2007 and at \n\nTariffs. Tariffs are adjusted to meet the covenants of at least 6% rate of return on net fixed \n\n4. \nassets from 2006 onward. Real tariff levels are shown below.   \n\nYear \n\n2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007 \n\n2008  2009  2010 \n\n0.81 \n\n1.00 \n\n1.30 \n\n1.70 \n\n2.22 \n\n2.18 \n\n2.23 \n\n2.29 \n\n2.29 \n\ncents/kWh \n \n\nOperating Expenses and Taxation. Cost of fuel and cost of purchase power is assumed to \n5. \ngrow  with  increased  sales,  adjusted  for  exchange  rates  and  local  inflation. Wages, administration \nexpenses, and other local expenses are also adjusted by inflation. Bad debt is calculated at 10% of \nthe accounts receivable each year starting from 2003 and 5% from 2006 onward, while income tax is \ncalculated as 30% of taxable income.  \n\n6. \n\nFixed assets. The gross fixed assets are indicatively revalued in 2003 at $3.75 billion. \n\n7. \nAccounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, and Cash.  Accounts Receivable and Accounts \nPayable are modelled as 3 months of revenue and 3 months of operating expenses, respectively, by \n2004; minimum cash reserve at 1 month\u2019s operating expenses beginning in 2003. \n\nLong-Term Debt.

The  automation  of  dispatch  control  and  metering  is  also  a \nmandatory  requirement  for  the  optimal  operation  of  the  regional  and  the  domestic  power \nsystems and for economic regional trade. \n \nB. \n\nProject Viability Analysis \n\n2. \nThe  viability  analysis  has  been  undertaken  on  a  conservative  basis  in  terms  of \nimprovements  in  system  reliability  and  optimized  operation.  The  analysis  does  not  include the \nbenefits of power trade. \n \n\n1. \n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return \n\n3. \nThe  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  has  been  estimated  for  the  project \ncomponents  from  the  perspective  of  the  electric  utilities  in  each  country  on  the  basis  of  the \nfollowing assumptions. \n\nTable A15.1: Assumptions \n\n \nAssumption \n\nAverage life \n\nTajikistan \n\nUzbekistan \n\n15 years for dispatch and 25 years \nfor substations  \n\n15 years for dispatch and 25 years \nfor substations  \n\nEstimated total cost (2002 base price \nplus physical contingencies) \n\n$23.6 million \n\nSavings in communication expenses  \n\n$0.17 million/year \n\n0.5% saving. \n\n$125.1 million \n\n$0.50 million/year \n\n0.5% saving. \n\nOperation and maintenance cost \nsavings due to optimal dispatch \n\nFuel cost savings due to optimal \ndispatch and use of thermal and \nhydropower plants and lower \nspinning reserve \n\nTransmission loss reduction due to \noptimal dispatch and more equal \nloading of the entire power system  \n\nImproved transmission system \nreliability: 70 % reduction in forced \noutages (45% due to substation \nrehabilitation and 25% due to \ndispatch upgrading) \n\nCollateral damage from explosions \nsavings due to more reliable \nequipment in substations  \n\nIncome tax. \n\n \n\n1% saving assumed increasing by \n2.5% per year with generation \ngrowth.

Based  on  the  above \nassumptions,  the  FIRR  for  the  Project  for  Tajikistan  and  Uzbekistan  is  estimated  at  7.0%  and \n11.3%,  respectively.  The  Project\u2019s  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  is  difficult  to \nestimate,  given  the  current  variable  economic  conditions  prevailing  in  both  countries  and  the \nlack  of  an  indicative  set  of  interest  rates  and  rates  of  return  at  present.  However,  using  the \nexpected  US  dollar  interest  rate  for  ADB's  LIBOR-based  loans  of  3.9%  as  a  proxy  for  the \nWACC,1 the Project components should be financially viable.  \n \n\n2. \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return \n\n5. \nThe viability of the Project was analyzed from a broader national perspective in terms of \nits economic internal rate of return (EIRR). The financial costs were adjusted to reflect the true \neconomic opportunities forgone and realized on account of the Project. The economic analysis \nwas based on the following additional assumptions:   \n \n\na standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.90 for Tajikistan and 0.70 for Uzbekistan; \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nfuel  cost  savings  due  to  optimal  dispatch  valued  at  gas  border  price  of  $43  per \n1000m3; \n\ntransmission  loss  reduction  valued  on  the  basis  of  estimated  weighted  average \nwillingness  to  pay  for  electricity  of  $0.050  per  kWh  and  $0.045  per  kWh  for \nTajikistan and Uzbekistan, respectively;2 and \nenergy not served savings valued at $0.20 per kWh3; the long run marginal cost \nof generation added. \n\n6. \nThe analysis is presented in Tables A15.2c and A15.3c. From the above assumptions, \nthe  EIRR  for  the  Project  for  Tajikistan  and  Uzbekistan  is  estimated  at  30.0%  and  24.2%, \nrespectively. These figures are higher than the ADB\u2019s generally accepted cutoff point of 12%. \n  \n\n3. \n\nRegional Benefits \n\n7. \nThe  foregoing  viability  analysis  considered  the  project  benefits  for  each  country \nexcluding  the  benefits  of  increased  trade.  The  additional  benefits  of  enhanced  trade  were \nestimated  on  the  basis  that  agreement  is  reached  for  Uzbekistan  to  import  all  the  surplus \nsummer energy available from the Nurek power station in Tajikistan, on average 1,000 GWh per \nyear.  Instead  of  spilling  and  wasting  this  water,  as  is  the  case  at  present,  the  net  economic \nbenefit  that  could  be  shared  by  both  countries  is  $12  million  estimated  at  1.2 cents/kWh. The \nbenefit  is  calculated  as  avoided  generation  costs (fuel and variable cost) to Uzbekistan of 1.9 \ncents/kWh  less  transmission  cost  of  0.5  cents/kWh  and  the  negligible  Tajik  generation  cost  of \n0.2  cents/kWh.  The  share  of  the  benefit  will  be  based  on  the  price  agreed.  If  these  expected \nregional  benefits  are  realized  the  financial  and  economic  viability  of  both  the  Tajik  and  Uzbek \ncomponents of the Project will be substantially enhanced. \n\n \n \n\n                                                 \n1   This interest rate is applicable for the relending to Barki Tajik and Uzbekenergo and would also be a proxy for the \n\nequity cost of capital on an opportunity cost basis (i.e., the saving if the utilities repaid the current debt). \n\n2   Based on (i) an upper bound of $0.13 per kWh for diesel generation and $0.24 per kWh for kerosene lighting; (ii) a \nlower  bound  of  present  average  tariffs,  for  Tajikistan  of  $0.005  per  kWh  and  $0.012  per  kWh  for  residential  and \nindustry,  respectively,  and  for  Uzbekistan  of  $0.01  per  kWh  and  $0.01  per  kWh  for  residential  and  industry, \nrespectively; (iii) present demand for Tajikistan of 35% and 65% for residential and industry, respectively, and for \nUzbekistan of 16% and 84% for residential and industry, respectively; and (iv) a 0.25 curvature correction factor. \n3   The feasibility report quotes a range of $0.40 to $5.0 per kWh of energy not served in other countries; $0.20 per \nkWh was considered reasonable for Central Asia and would roughly equate with the cost of autogeneration based \non a 10% utilization factor. \n\n\f \nTable A15.2 : Tajikistan Component\n\nAppendix 15           55 \n\nItem\n\n2003\n\n2004 2005 2006\n\n2007 2008 2009\n\n2010\n\n2015 2020\n\n2025\n\n2030\n\n.002\n49\n21\n13\n7\n\n.002\n50\n22\n14\n8\n\n.002\n51\n23\n15\n8\n\n.002\n52\n24\n15\n9\n\n.002\n54\n25\n16\n9\n\n.003\n61\n34\n22\n12\n\n.003\n69\n50\n32\n18\n\n47\n47\n\n69\n69\n\n1.0\n\n1.3\n\n1.7\n\n2.2\n\n2.2\n\n2.2\n\n2.3\n\n2.3\n\n2.5\n\n2.5\n\n2.5\n\n2.5\n\nTable  A15.2b : Financial Internal Rate of Return ($million)\n\nItem\n\nNPV\n\n2003\n\n2004 2005 2006\n\n2007 2008 2009\n\n2010\n\n2015 2020\n\n2025\n\n2030\n\n0.17\n0.01\n0.10\n1.09\n0.17\n0.31\n0.50\n\n0.17\n0.01\n0.10\n1.14\n0.18\n0.33\n0.50\n\n0.17\n0.01\n0.10\n1.20\n0.20\n0.35\n0.50\n\n0.17\n0.01\n0.10\n1.23\n0.21\n0.37\n0.50\n\n0.17\n0.01\n0.12\n1.52\n0.30\n0.54\n0.50\n\n0.17\n0.02\n0.13\n1.72\n0.44\n0.80\n0.50\n\n0.17\n\n0.17\n\n1.18\n0.50\n\n1.73\n0.50\n\n2.32\n\n2.34\n\n2.43\n\n2.53\n\n2.59\n\n3.16\n\n3.78\n\n1.85\n\n2.40\n\n0.71\n\n5.20 15.36\n\n0.71\n\n5.20 15.36\n\n0.16\n0.04\n0.29\n0.49\n\n0.16\n0.05\n0.31\n0.52\n\n0.16\n0.05\n0.34\n0.55\n\n0.16\n0.05\n0.36\n0.57\n\n0.16\n0.07\n0.53\n0.75\n\n0.16\n0.10\n0.70\n0.96\n\n0.06\n0.09\n0.16\n0.30\n\n0.06\n0.14\n0.31\n0.50\n\n(5.7)\n\n-0.71 -5.20 -15.36 -0.53\n\n1.85\n\n1.91\n\n1.98\n\n2.02\n\n2.41\n\n2.82\n\n1.54\n\n1.90\n\nTable  A15.2c : Economic Internal Rate of Return ($ million)\n\nItem\n\nNPV\n\n2002 2003\n\n2004 2005 2006\n\n2007 2008 2009\n\n2010\n\n2015 2020\n\n2025\n\n2030\n\nTable A15.2a : Assumptions\n\nFuel Cost Savings\nSystem Loss Reduction\nOutage Reduction\n\nSubstation Rehabilitation\nDispatch Upgrade\n\nBenefit Values\nOutage Cost\nFuel Saving - Economic\nFuel Saving - Financial\nWTP Estimate\nExpected Real Tariff\nVariable Gen.

Poverty Analysis                                                                     Proposed Classification  \nThe Project area covers the countries of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan and out of a total population of 31.2 million, 65% are \nbelow  the  poverty  line  (83%  Tajikistan,  60%  Uzbekistan).  Greater  reliability  of  electricity  supply  at  lower  long-term cost \nwill increase investment and private and public sector productivity. Output using employment generated by the Project is \nestimated to be 8,800 (2,200 Tajikistan, 6,000 Uzbekistan). Improved power supply will improve the economic situation \nand  quality  of  life  of  the  poor,  as  it  is  required  for  agriculture  (irrigation  and  drainage),  drinking  water  supply,  health, \neducation,  industry,  and  small-scale  enterprises.    In  terms  of  poverty  impact the net economic benefits accruing to the \npoor are estimated at about $46 million\u2014$17  million  for  Tajikistan  and  $29  million  for  Uzbekistan.  The  poverty  impact \nratio is estimated at 41%\u201457% for Tajikistan and 35% for Uzbekistan. Hence, a substantial portion of the project benefits \nwill go to the poor. \n \nC.

The summary initial environmental examination (SIEE) has been prepared based on \nthe findings of the feasibility study consultants. \n\nB. \n\nBackground and Description of the Project \n\ninterconnected  high-voltage \n\nThe  Central  Asia  power  system  comprises \n\n2. \nlinks \nencompassing  southern  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan,  and \nUzbekistan. The main transmission lines link the power systems of the five countries for parallel \noperation.  The  system  shares  common  operational  and  service  management,  planning, \ninformation  channels  and  control,  and  connects  83  power  plants,  including  29  thermal  and 48 \nhydropower  plants,  with  a  total  installed  capacity  of  about  25,000  megawatts.  The  unified \ndispatch  center  in  Tashkent  is  responsible  for  maintaining  the  balanced  and  synchronized \noperation of the power transmission and distribution systems of the five countries. Following the \ndissolution  of  the  Soviet  Union  in  1991,  the  countries  maintained  their  balanced  and \nsynchronized  operation  to  allow  import  and  export  of  electricity  among  them.  Market-oriented \nissues  increasingly  play  a  major  role  in  power  system  management.  However,  the  regional \ntechnical  operation  protocols  are  less  respected  and  funds  for  maintenance  and  rehabilitation \nare  scarce.  Each  country  has  been  focusing  more  on  power  self-sufficiency  rather  than \nestablishing a competitive regional market that would achieve economically efficient patterns of \ntrade. \n\n3. \nThe  objective  is  to  improve  the  operation  and  efficiency  of  the  regional  power \ntransmission  system  and  enhance  economic  power  trade  among  the  Central  Asian  republics. \nThe  Project  will  rehabilitate  the  500-kilovolt  (kV)  substations  to  improve  system  reliability, \nupgrade  dispatch  and  communications  facilities  to  optimize  system  operation,  and  install  new \ntransborder  metering  to  better  measure  traded  power.  Under  the  Project  the  focus  will  be  on \nmodernizing the transmission systems of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. \n\n4. \nIn  Tajikistan,  the  components  are:  (i) the  rehabilitation  of  the  high-voltage  Regar \nsubstation, and (ii) the rehabilitation of the national dispatch center including the installation of \nnew communications links between the main substations. In Uzbekistan, the components are: \n(i) the  rehabilitation  of  high  voltage  substations  of  Tashkent,  Tashkent  TPS,  Lochin,  Novo \nAngren,  Karakul,  Syr  Darya,  Guzar  and  Sukhan;  (ii) the  rehabilitation  of  the  national  and  area \ndispatch  centers  including  the  installation  of  new  communications  links  between  the  main \nsubstations; and (iii) the rehabilitation of the unified dispatch center in Tashkent.  \n\nC. \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n5.  \nTajikistan  is  characterized  by  a  strongly  continental  climate  with  hot,  dry  summers  and \ncold  winters,  especially  in  mountainous  areas.  Daily  temperature  fluctuations  are  usually  quite \nlarge.  The  cold  winters  make  heating  a  necessary  for  winter  months  in  the  whole  country. \nApproximately  97%  of  the  country  is  mountainous,  and  almost  half  of  it  peaks  at  altitudes  of \nmore than 3,000 meters above sea level. The few flat areas available are intensively used for \nagriculture,  which  is  carried  out  almost  exclusively  under  irrigation.  For  this  reason,  the \nconsiderable  water  resources  of  the  country,  stemming  from  the  high  mountain  areas,  are \nimportant for power generation as well as for irrigation.  \n\n\fAppendix  17           61 \n\nUzbekistan is characterized by a strongly continental climate with hot, dry summers and \n6.  \ncold  winters,  mostly  flat-to-rolling  sandy  desert  with  dunes;  broad,  flat  intensely  irrigated  river \nvalleys along the course of the Amu Darya, Syr Darya, and Zarafshon; the Fergana Valley in the \neast surrounded by mountainous  Tajikistan  and  Kyrgyzstan;  and  the  shrinking  Aral  Sea in the \nwest. About 40,000 square kilometers (sq km) of  flat areas are intensively used for agriculture, \nwhich is undertaken almost exclusively under irrigation. \n\nD. \n\nEnvironmental Problems due to the Project Location \n\n7. \nThe Project will be conducted at the existing switchyards/substation sites and at dispatch \ncenters.  All  substations  and  switchgears  in  which  rehabilitation  measures  are  foreseen  are  in \nthe ownership of the power utilities in each country, namely Barki Tajik and Uzbekenergo. There \nwill be no new installations and no need for land acquisition. \n\n8. \nIn  Tajikistan  optic  fiber  cables  will  be  installed  on  the  Regar-Novaya-Djangal-Yavan- \nBapazin-Lolazor-Sebiston-Nurek  220 kV  transmission  line,  in  substitution  of  the  existing \nearthwire. The transmission line partly crosses mountainous areas, mainly near Nurek and the \nVarkhsh  valley,  where  crops  and  households  are  scarce.  The  transmission  line  near  Regar \ncrosses a flat area where intensive agriculture is undertaken.  \n\nIn Uzbekistan optic fiber cables will be installed on the Lochin-Uzbekistanskaya-Angren -\n9. \nTashkent  220 kV  transmission  line  and  on  the  Karakul-Navoiy-Syrdarinskaya-Taskent  220 kV \ntransmission lines in substitution of the existing earthwires. A total of 1,107 km of cable have to \nbe installed under the project. The transmission lines partly cross desert areas, where crops and \nhouseholds  are  scarce.  The  transmission  lines  near  the  Fergana  Valley  and  around  Tashkent \ncross  intensive  agriculture  areas.  Some  archeological  sites  are  located  in  the  vicinity  of  the \ntransmission lines, namely near Bukhara and Samarkand. \n\nE. \n\nPotential Environmental Impacts \n\n1. \n\nConstruction \n\nImpacts  during  construction  will  be  limited  apart  from  normal  environmental  impacts \n10. \nassociated  with  construction  activities  such  as  noise,  dust,  and  waste  disposal.  During  the \nstringing  of  the  new  optical  ground  wire,  access  of  trucks,  equipments  have  to  be  allowed  all \nover  the  route  of  the  transmission  line,  i.e.,  over  1,000 km  in  Uzbekistan  and  about  300 km in \nTajikistan.  Special  arrangements  have  to  be  made  in  order  to  minimize  the  impacts  on \nagriculture, such as seasonal implementation schedule, crops compensation mechanisms, and \nstringing  under  tension.  Some  impacts  cannot,  however,  be  fully  avoided  such  as  temporary \naccess roads and trimming. Special care will be taken into consideration at the end of the works \nto mitigate the environmental impacts, such as land slide and land erosion that can appear after \nthese  temporary  works.  The  following  generated  waste  volumes  are  estimated  for  Tajikistan: \n(i) 6  tons  of  aluminum  and  (ii) 130  tons  of  steel.  Estimated  waste  volumes  in  Uzbekistan  are: \n(i) 20 tons of aluminum and (ii) 450 tons of steel. These wastes can be readily sold for recycling. \n\n11. \nFor substation works in Tajikistan, the following waste volumes will likely be generated: \n(i) 25 tons of ceramic insulators, (ii) 4 tons of insulation oil, (iii) 5 tons of copper, and (iv) 1 ton of \nsteel.  In  Uzbekistan  the  waste  volumes  are  expected  to  be:  (i) 600 tons of ceramic insulators, \n(ii) 90 tons of insulation oil, (iii) 120 tons of copper, and (iv) 20 tons of steel. Additional chemical \nproducts  such  as  lead,  acid,  and  electrochemical  condensers  will  be  disposed  from  the \nrehabilitation  of  control  and  protection  system  as  well  as  from  the  direct  current  system, \n\n\f62           Appendix 17 \n\nespecially from the batteries. The ceramic wastes will be disposed of in landfills. The insulation \noil will be cleaned and filtered, and partly reused or sold as fuel oil. Lead will be sold. Acid and \nother chemical components (bakelite, electrochemical condensers) will be properly conditioned \nand sent to specialized laboratories. \n\n2. \n\n Operation \n\n12. \nFrom an operational point of view, there will be no change from the present operation in \nterms of electric or magnetic fields due to the proposed rehabilitation works at the substations \nsites and in their vicinity, as the substations already exist. \n\n13. \nIt will be the same for the transmission lines, as they already exist and the operation of \noptical  ground  wires  for  telecommunications  will  not  present  any  problem  for  the  environment, \nas  this  kind  of  technology  does  not  create  any  kind  of  emissions.  Moreover,  the  optic  ground \nwires  will  reinforce  the  grounding  of  the  tower  and  will  then,  as  a  positive  impact,  reduce  the \nstep voltage during storms and lightning. \n\n14. \nThe new power line carrier at substations will not create any radio interference as long \nas the same frequency band as now is reused. Attention must be paid to this point during the \ndetail design study. The installation of hardware and software in the dispatching will not create \nany adverse impact on the environment. \n\nF. \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nThe  most  important  environmental  mitigation  measure  in  relation  to  the  Project  will  be \n15. \nproper  disposal  of  discarded  material,  especially  transformer  oil  and  lead-acid  batteries. \nContractors and executing agencies (EAs) will be required to filter, sell, or reuse the remaining \ntransformer  oil  as  fuel  oil.  For  other  products,  the  EAs  will  take  appropriate  measures  for  the \nrecycling of the discarded materials. Other material, which cannot be recycled, will be deposited \nin controlled deposit sites. The EAs will, with the help of the consultants, prepare and implement \nan environmental monitoring plan. \n\nDuring  construction  at  any  site,  care  will  have  to  be  taken  to  prevent  contamination  of \n16. \nsoil  and  water  with  fuel  and  lubricants.  Proper  storage  in  plastic  tanks  and  other  preventive \nmeasures will have to be included in the contractor bid document and contract document. The \nEA will assure periodic site monitoring and supervision to ensure compliance. \n\n17. \nDuring the transmission line works, the damage to the crops much be reduced as much \nas  possible.  This  can  be  achieved  through  a  seasonal  implementation  schedule,  i.e.,  during  a \nlow period of agricultural activities, after the harvest. Where it will not be avoidable, the EA will \nset up and implement crops compensation mechanisms.  \n\n18. \nTemporary  access  roads  will  have  to  be  limited  to  a  minimum,  and  special  techniques \nsuch  as  tensioning  stringing  will  be  implemented  to  the  maximum  extent.  This  particular \ntechnique will have to be implemented near any archeological sites and other sensitive areas.  \n\nAt the end of the construction period, the contractor will be asked to remove all wastes \n\n19. \nand to recondition the parts that have deteriorated during the construction phase.  \n\n\fAppendix  17           63 \n\nG. \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\n20. \nThe  Project  will  improve  power  supply  in  the  region  and  will  enhance  the  exchange  of \nenergy. Adverse impacts of the project will be very small, and will be limited to the construction \nperiod.    The  most  important  measures  to  be  taken  consist  of  proper  disposal  of  discarded \nmaterials. Adverse impacts can be easily mitigated through good engineering and construction \npractices.  No  negative  impact  will  persist  during  the  operation  phase.  The  Project  will  not \ninvolve resettlement or land acquisition. Since all identified adverse environmental impacts are \nminor and can be mitigated, a detailed environmental impact assessment is not required for the \nProject.  \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["Currency Unit \nTJS1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 November 2002) \nTajikistan \n\u2013 \n= \n= \n \nUzbekistan \n\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "sum (SUM) \n$0.0012  \nSUM856 \n", "somoni (TJS) \n$0.3390  \nTJS2.95 \n", "Currency Unit \nSUM1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", " \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "ADC \nDMC \nEA \nEIRR \nFIRR \nGDP \nIAS \nLRMC \nMOE \nNDC \nO&M \nPIU \nPSC \nSCF \nTA \nUDC \nUSAID \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "area dispatch center \ndeveloping member country \nexecuting agency \neconomic internal rate of return \nfinancial internal rate of return \ngross domestic product \nInternational Accounting Standards  \nlong-run marginal cost \nMinistry of Energy \nNational dispatch center \noperation and maintenance \nproject implementation unit \nproject steering committee \nstandard conversion factor \ntechnical assistance \nunified dispatch center \nUnited States Agency for International Development \n", "WEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n", "kV \nkW \nMW \nGW \nkWh \nGWh \nTWh \nt \ntoe \nmtoe \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "- \n \n \n(kilovolt) \n- \n \n \n(kilowatt) \n- \n \n \n(megawatt) \n- \n \n(gigawatt) \n \n- \n \n(kilowatt-hour)  \n- \n \n(gigawatt-hour) \n- \n \n(terawatt-hour)  \n- \n(metric ton) \n \n \n(ton of oil equivalent)   \n- \n(million tons of oil equivalent)  - \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "NOTES \n", " \n", "1,000 volts \n1,000 watts \n \n1,000,000 watts \n1,000,000,000 watts \n1,000 watt-hours \n1,000,000 kWh \n1,000,000,000 kWh \n1,000 kilograms \n10,000,000 kilocalories \n1,000,000 toe \n", " \n(i) \n(ii) \n", " \nThe fiscal year (FY) of the governments and their agencies ends on 31 December.  \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", "This Report was prepared by a team consisting of: S.
