An initial environmental examination was undertaken; \nAssessment  the summary is a core appendix. \n   \nProject Description  The Project will improve the reliability and the operation of the \nCentral Asian power transmission system, enhance intercountry \npower trading, and establish the foundation for a future wholesale \nregional power market. \n   \nRationale  Regional  cooperation  among  the  countries  of  Central  Asia  is \nrequired to develop their economies. An adequate and reliable \npower  supply  is  essential  to  support  economic  growth.  The \nCentral  Asian  power  system  comprises  interconnected  high-\nvoltage  links  encompassing  southern  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz \nRepublic,  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan,  and  Uzbekistan.  The  main \ntransmission lines link the power systems of the five countries for \nparallel operation. The system shares common operational and \nservice management, planning, information channels and control, \nand  connects  83  power  plants,  including  29  thermal  and  48 \nhydropower plants, with a total installed capacity of about 25,000 \nmegawatts.  The  unified  dispatch  center  (UDC)  in  Tashkent  is \nresponsible  for  maintaining  the  balanced  and  synchronized \noperation of the power transmission and distribution systems of \nthe five countries. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in \n1991,  the  countries  maintained  balanced  and  synchronized \noperation to allow import and export of electricity among them. \nMarket-oriented issues increasingly play a major role in power \nsystem management. However, the regional technical operation \nprotocols  are  less  respected  and  funds  for  maintenance  and \nrehabilitation have been limited. Each country has been focusing \nmore  on  power  self-sufficiency  rather  than  establishing  a \ncompetitive  regional  market  that  would  achieve  economically \nefficient patterns of trade. It is, however, increasingly accepted in \nCentral  Asia  that  there  are  mutual  benefits  in  exploiting \ncomplementary energy resources on a regional basis. \n   \nObjective, Outputs, and  The  Project  will  improve  the  operation  and  efficiency  of  the \nComponents  regional  power  transmission  system  and  enhance  economic \nregional power trade and cooperation among the Central Asian \nrepublics. Under the Project, the focus will be on modernizing the \ntransmission systems of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan and enhancing \nthe power trade relations between them. The Project will be the \nfirst stage of an assistance program to promote regional energy \ncooperation. The project outputs will be as follows: \n \n ", "iii \n(i) Rehabilitated 500-kilovolt (kV) substations and switchgear. \nReplace circuit breakers (500 and 220 kV), current and voltage \ntransformers,  protection  and  control  systems,  and  the  direct \ncurrent system.  \n(ii) Upgraded dispatch and communications facilities. Upgrade \nfacilities  at  UDC,  national  dispatch  centers  and  area  dispatch \ncenters,  and  telecommunications  links.  Install  new  remote \nterminal units in 500 kV substations and in major power plants.  \n(iii) New meters. Install new transborder metering together with \nmeter management systems at all dispatch centers. \n(iv) Improved  policy,  institutional,  and  regulatory \nenvironment. Implement a Regional Power Trade Action Plan \nand a bilateral Power Trade Relations Agreement. \n   \nCost Estimates  The total project cost is estimated at $175.5 million.

The  implementation  of  a  management \ninformation system in Uzbekenergo will involve 15 person-months \nof  foreign  and  30  person-months  of  local  consulting  services. \nRetroactive financing was approved for the Uzbek component \nimplementation  consulting  services  expenditures  from  15 \nNovember 2002, up to a ceiling of $500,000.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The  primary  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  will  be  business \nBeneficiaries  enterprises and the population who will benefit from improved \nquality  of  electricity  services  and  long-term  cost  reductions \nresulting from economic dispatch of power plants and the overall \nefficiency gains from enhanced power trade. Since effectively all \nthe population of both Tajikistan and Uzbekistan have access to \nelectricity,  the  project  benefits  will  be  universal.  The  financial \ninternal  rates  of  return  for  the  Tajikistan  and  Uzbekistan \ncomponents of the Project are estimated to be 7.0% and 11.3%, \nrespectively. The economic internal rates of return are estimated \nto be 30.0% and 24.2%, respectively. In terms of poverty impact, \nthe net economic benefits accruing to the poor over the life of the \nProject  are  estimated  at  about  $46 million\u2013$17 million  for \nTajikistan and $29 million for Uzbekistan. The poverty impact ratio \nis estimated at 41%\u201357% for Tajikistan and 35% for Uzbekistan. \nHence, the Project can be said to be pro-poor as a substantial \nportion of the project benefits will go to the poor. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The Project has been formulated to minimize potential technical \nand  economic  risks.  The  main  risks  and  assumptions  are \n(i) continued  political  commitment  to  power  sector  reform  and \nregional power trade, (ii) utility financial sustainability, (iii) project \ndelay, (iv) cost overruns, and (v) inadequate plant maintenance \nfollowing commissioning. \n \n ", " \nv\n  ii ", " \n \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan  and  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  for  the  Regional  Power \nTransmission  Modernization  Project.  I  further  summit  for  administration  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  a  loan  for  the  Project  to  be  provided  by  the  OPEC  Fund  for \nInternational Development (OPEC Fund). \n \n2.  The Project was identified and prepared under ADB\u2019s regional technical assistance  \n(RETA) program.1 Regional consensus building has been accomplished through two regional \nmeetings held in July 2001 and April 2002. The Project was included in the regional project \npipeline and endorsed at the Central Asian Ministerial Conference on Economic Cooperation in \nApril 2002. Fact-finding for the Project was undertaken from 19 April to 6 May 2002 and \nappraisal from 6 August to 2 September 2002. The Project was formulated based on the \nfindings  of  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  consultants  and  the  ADB  missions.  A  project \nframework summarizing the Project's goal, purpose, outputs, activities, and inputs is presented \nin Appendix 1. The Project is the first stage of a regional assistance program to promote \nregional energy cooperation and will focus on rehabilitating power transmission equipment and \nenhancing the power trade relationship between Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. \n \nI.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  The  Central  Asian  power  system  comprises  interconnected  high-voltage  links \nencompassing  southern  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan,  and \nUzbekistan (see map). The main transmission lines link the power systems of the five countries \nfor  parallel  operation.  The  system  shares  common  operational  and  service  management, \nplanning, information channels and control, and connects 83 power plants, including 29 thermal \nand 48 hydropower plants, with a total installed capacity of about 25,000 megawatts (MW). The \nunified dispatch center (UDC) in Tashkent is responsible for maintaining the balanced and \nsynchronized operation of the power transmission and distribution systems of the five countries. \nFollowing  the  dissolution  of  the  Soviet  Union  in  1991,  the  countries  have  maintained \nsynchronized operation, which permits the exchange of electricity among them. Further details \nof the Central Asian power system are provided in Appendix 2. The main operating features are \nsummarized below. \n(i)  Regional electricity demand declined sharply in response to the fall in industrial \noutput following independence. In 1991, peak demand was 19,754 MW, in 1995 \nit was 16,364 MW. Since 1998, demand has been increasing and in 2001 it was \n16,682 MW. Demand is expected to grow at about 2.5% a year to reach 20,150 \nMW in 2010. \n(ii)  Electricity production has fallen in line with demand, from 116.1 terawatt-hour \n(TWh) in 1991 to 91.8 TWh in 2001, or by 21%. \n(iii)  Available generating capacity has declined by 16%  over the same period  to \nabout 21,000 MW due to lack of adequate maintenance. \n(iv)  No new generating capacity has been commissioned since 1991. \n                                                 \n1  RETA 5960:  Regional Power Transmission Modernization Project in Central Asian Republics, for $900,000, \napproved on 12 December 2000.  ", "2 \n(v)  System reliability has declined as a result of inadequate transmission system \nmaintenance  and  changes  in  the  regional  operating  regime.  Recorded \ntransmission system related outages were 178 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in 1998, \n138 GWh in 1999, and 309 GWh in 2000. \n(vi)  Power trade has fallen by 80% from 28.7 TWh in 1990 to 4.6 TWh in 2001. The \ntrade  levels  represented  25%  and  5%  of  generation,  respectively.  Due  to \ncomplementarity of energy resources, there is significant potential for economic \ntrading of power among the countries. With reforms in pricing, and power sector \nrestructuring combined with open trading policies, it is expected that power trade \ncould increase to 12% of power generation by 2011. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Problem Analysis \n4.  Adequate and reliable power supplies are required for economic development in Central \nAsia.  The  complementarity  of  energy  resources  and  the  existing  high-voltage  regional \ntransmission network means that power trade offers the least-cost economic solution to meeting \nthe region\u2019s power needs. However, there are substantial barriers and challenges to power \ntrade in Central Asia. The core problem that the Project seeks to address is the suboptimal \noperation of the regional power system and intercountry power trade. The causal factors are \ndescribed below and a problem tree is presented in Appendix 3. \n \n5.  Political  and  Structural  Constraints.  A  prime  obstacle  to  energy  trade  is  that \ngovernments in the region have had self-sufficiency as a policy goal. The effect is that some \nrepublics are generating electricity using high-value fossil fuels rather than importing electricity \nfrom  neighboring  countries  with  surplus  electricity  generated  from  renewable,  lower-cost \nresources.  There  has  also  been  a  tendency  in  some  countries  to  limit  access  to  their \ntransmission lines to countries wishing to trade with third countries. \n \n6.  The energy-water nexus also negatively impacts optimal power system operation and \ntrade.  Water  from  the  two  large  rivers,  Syr  Darya  and  Amu  Darya,  is  used  not  only  for \nhydropower generation in the upriver countries of Tajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic, but also \nfor irrigation purposes in these countries and in the downriver countries of Turkmenistan, \nUzbekistan, and Kazakhstan. The differing times of year for hydropower requirements (mainly in \nwinter) and for irrigation (mainly in summer) pose serious conflicts for reservoir operation, the \nreplacement of winter hydropower by supplies of fossil power and fuel, and the exchange \nconditions between water and energy. To cope with these interrelationships in regional trade, \nthe  Central  Asian  governments  have  resorted  to  bilateral  and  multilateral  agreements  that \ndetermine the quantities of water and energy (coal, electricity, and gas) that are exchanged \nbetween the countries and the values at which they are exchanged. \n \n7.  Power sector restructuring and reform are key to providing the incentives for trade, since \nindependent transmission and distribution companies that are separate from generation, more \nactively seek to trade power compared to integrated utilities that have a conflict of interest to sell \nand maximize their own generation. Apart from Kazakhstan, the reform process of the power \nsectors toward a competitive power market system has made only limited progress to date and \nreform efforts vary from one country to another. Ultimately a regulator that could guarantee free \nand  nondiscriminatory  access  of  all  parties  that  meet  certain  technical  and  commercial \nrequirements will also be required to facilitate open trade. \n ", "3 \n8.  Management and Institutional Problems. The institutional framework for cooperation \nat the regional level requires strengthening. The UDC in Tashkent is responsible for maintaining \nthe balanced and synchronized operation of the power transmission and distribution system. \nBecause of its close association with Uzbekenergo, the UDC is considered, fairly or unfairly, by \nother  countries  not  to  be  a  truly  independent  regional  organization.  Moreover,  the  UDC \npresently plays only a minor role in promoting regional cooperation in the power sector. Funding \nof UDC operation is supposed to be on an equal basis from all the countries; however, a \nnumber of countries are in arrears in their contributions. A power council consisting of the heads \nof each regional power utility is the executive body that overseas the operation of the UDC. \n \n9.  Transmission System Technical Problems. System reliability is closely linked to the \nquality and adequacy of maintenance. Many components of the transmission system have \nreached  the  end  of  their  economic  life  and  are  technically  obsolete,  and  resources  for \nmaintenance and development of the power system have been limited. Tariffs are below cost \nrecovery  and  consequently  power  utilities  cannot  operate  and  maintain  the  system  to \ninternational  standards.  Since  even  maintenance  needs  cannot  be  met  there  is  also  no \nprovision for asset replacement and system expansion. The other technical problem is that the \npower system dispatch (or control) at the country and regional levels is suboptimal. The system \nis presently controlled manually at the station level with coordination from the UDC, the national \ndispatch centers (NDCs), and the area dispatch centers (ADCs). Coordination is performed via \na deteriorated telephone network on the basis of fragmented information and without application \nof appropriate supervisory control and data acquisition systems or energy management system \nfunctions. The existing level of automation of network control at the control centers as well as at \nthe substation level does not allow for efficient and optimized dispatch of generated power and \nancillary services2 including an operating reserve as required to maintain frequency regulation \nand load following in the power system.  \n \n10.  Pricing Problems.  Pricing is the key to providing incentives for trade. Presently, a \ndistorted system of energy prices exists. Primary energy sources for thermal power generation \nare frequently and grossly undervalued (e.g., in Uzbekistan the gas price for power generation \nis one fifth of the export or border price). Also, there is no value attributed to water regulation for \nirrigation. For power trade to work it is necessary for both buyer and seller to receive an \neconomic advantage. This is possible only in an environment of undistorted prices of electricity \nand primary fuels for power generation. A further pricing issue is that there is no adequate \nmechanism in place for the provision of and compensation for ancillary services. In short, the \nlarge hydropower plants in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan provide these services and are \nrequired  to  maintain  spinning  reserves  for  regulating  the  interconnected  system  to  the \npredominantly  thermal  generating  systems  of  Uzbekistan,  Turkmenistan,  and  Kazakhstan, \nwithout being paid a price for these services that would allow them to recover their costs. \nHydropower plants are able to quickly increase or decrease output compared to thermal plants, \nwhich allows them to be used to follow changes in demand. Hydropower plants are also able to \nrestart or blackstart the whole power system in the event of a system-wide collapse. Finally, as \npower tariffs are below long-run marginal costs, power utilities cannot create the revenues that \nare required to sustain power system operation, let alone trade. \n \n11.  Payment Problems. Currently, exchange of power is governed by agreements under \nwhich government officials of the various countries decide in regular meetings on the quantities \nto be imported and exported within a given time period. This exchange of power is often linked \n                                                 \n2  Ancillary services include spinning reserve (capacity which is instantaneously available if required), system control, \nfrequency regulation, black-start capacity, and reactive power. ", "4 \nto the exchange of fossil fuels and water allocations for irrigation. For an electricity market to \nwork it will be essential to decouple the electricity trade from water and the trade in fuels. Barter \nand political allocation of commodities need to be transformed into traded energy and traded \nfeedstocks (such as coal and gas) with separate markets for each. Water allocation must be on \na fair and equitable basis and costs of water storage and regulation must be adequately \ncompensated. Also, the financial framework does not yet exist that would allow an efficient \nsettlement of transactions in those cases where they are not barter-based and are dollarized. \nThere are problems of currency convertibility and there are no bank guarantees easily available, \nif at all, for such transactions. Nonpayment across borders is a common problem. Finally, \nenergy trade is technically distorted by the lack of adequate metering of electric energy and load \nat the borders. The present metering installations do not provide the required accuracy for billing \npurposes nor the capability for real-time and multi-tariff metering that would be necessary for \ntrade. \n \n2.  Project Rationale \n12.  The Central Asian power system was designed as a single integrated system out of \nwhich the national systems have been partitioned following the dissolution of the former Soviet \nUnion. As a result, some of the national power systems are divided and joined only through \nother countries; others have inadequate generation or water storage capacity for their own \nneeds and must import electricity seasonally or over the year; in other countries there is conflict \nbetween the electricity generation by hydropower stations and the needs of their neighbors for \nwater  for  irrigation.  The  fundamental  rationale  for  cooperation  is  the  energy  resource \ncomplementarity combined with remoteness from world markets that makes it essential for the \nCentral Asian countries to share water and energy. Thus, parallel operation of the regional \npower system and enhancement of energy trade are indispensable for the partner countries in \naddition to the economic advantages that the interconnected operation provides. To facilitate \npower exchange and to maintain reliable operation, the 500 kV transmission system must be \nupgraded and reliability secured, the dispatch and control systems need to be modernized, and \nmetering needs to be installed. Together with these key investments, policy, institutional, and \npricing reforms need to be implemented at both the domestic and regional levels. \n \n13.  The Project involving Tajikistan and Uzbekistan is a beginning towards the long-term \ngoal  of  a  wholesale  regional  power  market.  The  other  republics  are  expected to join in \nsubsequent projects and activities. At this stage the other republics have not been included in \nthe Project since Kazakhstan is already undertaking transmission rehabilitation and control \ninvestments with the assistance of the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction \nand Development (EBRD); Turkmenistan is yet to commence lending operations with ADB; and \nthe Kyrgyz Republic has borrowing constraints. To support expanding the participation of these \ncountries  in the regional cooperation, undertaking further necessary investment requirements \nand making further progress on regional reforms, ADB's regional assistance program includes a \nPhase II project in 2004. In this way the condition of the transmission network and power trading \nin the Central Asian grid can be progressively improved. \n \n14.  Tajikistan and Uzbekistan together represent about 65% of the generation capacity in \nthe Central Asian grid. Tajikistan has huge hydropower export potential and Uzbekistan is the \nkey centrally  located country through which most Central Asian power trade must flow. In \naddition,  its  thermal-based power system would benefit significantly from the availability of \nhydropower energy. The focus of the Project will be on enhancing the bilateral power trading \nrelationship between the two countries while encouraging broader regional cooperation. It is \nexpected that Tajikistan and Uzbekistan will become the champions to move the cooperation \nforward (particularly in terms of the Regional Power Trade Action Plan). ", "5 \n \n15.  Government Strategy. The Central Asian governments recognize the need to provide \nreliable, efficient, and affordable energy to support economic development. To this end, each \ngovernment has been taking steps to reform its respective power sector and improve cost \nrecovery. The governments also recognize the importance of regional cooperation to address \nenergy and water issues to the benefit of all parties. In this regard they executed in 1999 an \nagreement on the parallel operation of the regional electricity grid that forms the basis for trade \nand cooperation and the ultimate development of a regional power pool. The Project was \nendorsed at the Central Asian Ministerial Conference on Economic Cooperation in Manila in \nApril 2002 as part of  the 3-year regional program and was reconfirmed as top priority by \nTajikistan and Uzbekistan representatives at the ADB annual meeting in May 2002. \n \n16.  ADB  Strategy.  ADB\u2019s  regional  program,  which  complements  and  supplements  the \nindividual country programs, has focused on identifying infrastructure needs and improving the \npolicy  environment  for  promoting  cross-border  trade  in  the  areas  of  energy,  trade,  and \ntransportation.  In  the  energy  sector  the  focus  is  on  maximizing  benefits  from  resource \ncomplementarity by rationalizing and encouraging regional energy trade, based on market \nprinciples, and rehabilitating existing infrastructure. \n \n17.  External Assistance. In Central Asia, since 1994 ADB has lent $84 million for power \nrehabilitation projects in Tajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic and an infrastructure program loan \nin Tajikistan. A total of $6.1 million of TA complemented the loan program. Other major funding \nagencies active in the sector include EBRD, World Bank, and the governments of Japan and the \nUnited States. A list of funding agency activities is included in Appendix 4. The focus of all of \nthem has been on rehabilitation and power sector reform. In 1999, the World Bank and EBRD \nfinanced the Electricity Transmission Rehabilitation Project in Kazakhstan that aims to improve \nthe reliability of the 500 kV transmission system, modernize the dispatch facilities, and support \nthe  establishment  of  a  national  power  pool.  The  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment (USAID) has provided TA and supported a regional electricity working group that \nresulted in the execution of the parallel operating agreement and a body of work on the \ndevelopment of a regional power pool. Over the last couple of years the focus has been on \nregional cooperation in water resources that are integral to power sector operations. The Project \nwill build on these initiatives and further encourage regional power trade and cooperation. \nEBRD and the OPEC Fund will provide cofinancing and USAID will provide TA for the Project \n \n18.  Lessons Learned. ADB has modest experience in the energy sector in Central Asia. \nThe proposed Project is the first regional lending operation in the power sector, but its design \ndraws  on  ADB's  experience  in  providing  power  rehabilitation  assistance  to  countries  in \ntransition, including the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Mongolia. ADB projects have had front-\nend delays in implementation due to the governments' unfamiliarity with ADB procedures. This \nwas the case with Loan 1817-TAJ: Power Rehabilitation Project. This should not be a problem \nfor the implementation of the proposed Project since Tajikistan has gained experience with ADB \nprocedures and Uzbekistan has had experience with an EBRD project. Also, the implementation \nschedules in each case allow a reasonable period for procurement activities.  \n \n19.  ADB experience has also shown that it takes considerable time and effort to restructure, \ncorporatize, and commercialize utilities, and to achieve full cost recovery, especially in an \neconomy that is undergoing transition. The Tajikistan Government had difficulty in meeting the \nconditionalities under Loan 1651-TAJ: Postconflict Infrastructure Program, and had to obtain \nwaivers for second tranche release. The reform agenda in the Kyrgyz Republic was also difficult \nand took considerable time. The lesson that conditionalities have to be realistic and reasonable \nhas been taken into account in the project agreements. Finally, the experience with the first ", "6 \nregional  project  in  Central  Asia,  Loan  1774/1775  REG:  Almaty-Bishkek  Regional  Road \nRehabilitation, found that regional agreements take time to ratify and this has been factored into \nthe design of the Project.  \n \nII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objectives \n20.  The  strategic  objective  of  the  proposed  Project  is  to  efficiently  meet  the  energy \nrequirements of the Central Asian counties to support economic development. The specific \nproject objective is to improve the operation and efficiency of the regional power transmission \nsystem and enhance economic power trade among the Central Asian republics. Under the \nProject, the focus will be on modernizing the interconnected transmission systems of Tajikistan \nand Uzbekistan and enhancing the power trade relations between them.  \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n21.  The outputs of the Project are as follows (the technical scope is detailed in Appendix 5): \n \n(i)  Rehabilitated 500 kV substations and switchgear. Replace circuit breakers \n(500  and  220 kV),  current  and  voltage  transformers,  protection  and  control \nsystems, and the direct current system. In Tajikistan, the rehabilitation work will \ncover the Regar 500/220 kV substation. In Uzbekistan, the rehabilitation work will \ncover the 500/220 kV substations of Tashkent, Surkhan, Lochin, Guzar, and \nKarakul, and the switchgear at the power stations of Tashkent, Novo Angren and \nSyr Darya.  \n(ii)  Upgraded dispatch and communications facilities. Upgrade facilities at UDC, \nNDCs, ADCs, and telecommunications links. Install new remote terminal units in \n500 kV substations and in major power plants. In Tajikistan, the NDC and the \nADCs of Hojent and South regions will be upgraded. In Uzbekistan, the NDC and \nthe ADCs of Fergana, Takhitash, and Samarkand will be upgraded.  \n(iii)  New  transborder  metering.  Install  new  meters  together  with  meter \nmanagement systems at all control centers. In Tajikistan, the installation will \ninvolve replacement of 40 energy meters, provision of 12 sets of meter reading \nequipment, and a metering management system in the NDC. In Uzbekistan, the \ninstallation will involve replacement of 220 energy meters, provision of 40 sets of \nmeter reading equipment, and a metering management system in the NDC.  \n(iv)  Improved policy, institutional, and regulatory environment. Implement the \nRegional  Power  Trade  Action  Plan  and  the  bilateral  Power Trade Relations \nAgreement with consulting services support. \nC.  Special Features \n1.  Foundation for a Future Regional Competitive Power Market  \n22.  The measures to be implemented and the equipment to be installed under the Regional \nPower  Transmission  Modernization  Project  constitute  an  important  prerequisite  for  the \nenhancement of regional trade and the development of a future regional competitive power \nsystem. The steps required to reach the ultimate long-term goal can best be illustrated through ", "7 \nthe comparison with a no trade scenario and different stages of trade, ranging from pre-\nindependence times to the long-term objective of a regional power pool system.  \n \n23.  Soviet-Era  Trade  Scenario.  The  Soviet,  pre-independence  situation  represented \ncomplete integration and the level of trade was much higher than at present. The whole region \nwas operated as a single power exchange zone and, even though dispatch was not according \nto economic and market principles, it was a rational system in terms of energy resource \nutilization.  \n \n24.  No Trade Scenario. Given that peak electricity usage is time sensitive and the major \npopulation centers of the region are spread over different time zones, economizing on peak \ngeneration capacity alone would provide a strong rationale for energy trade. Trading also allows \nsubstantial economizing on reserve capacity. If no trade were to take place, each country would \nhave to provide its own reserve capacity, the sum of which is much higher than the reserve \ncapacity of an integrated system. While self-sufficiency in the newly independent republics has \nbeen a policy objective, it is now recognized that the no trade option can only be attained at a \nvery high cost and would confer few, if any, benefits on the country adopting the policy.  \n \n25.  Present Trade Scenario. The present power trade situation is characterized by barter \ndeals and technical dispatch. It is not based on economic considerations. The trade in 2001 is \nshown in Appendix 6. Southern Kazakhstan imports power from Turkmenistan (wheeled through \nUzbekistan) and the Kyrgyz Republic and receives power from north Kazakhstan as well. The \nKyrgyz  Republic  imports  power  from  Uzbekistan  and  Tajikistan  and  exports  power  to \nKazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan (at different times of the year). Tajikistan imports power \nfrom the Kyrgyz Republic, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan and exports power to the Kyrgyz \nRepublic  and  Uzbekistan.  Turkmenistan  exports  power  mainly  to  Tajikistan  but  also  small \namounts to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The energy trade picture is further complicated by \nexports and imports of gas for power production and by the inclusion of water for irrigation in the \npresent exchange agreements.  \n \n26.  With-Project Trade Scenario. Enhanced power trade development is the objective of \nthe Project. This intermediate stage can be described as voluntary cross-border trade on the \nbasis of genuinely independent electricity utilities that are managed according to economic \nprinciples, with no political interference. Barter trade would decline over the transition period. \nThe Project provides three key building blocks: rehabilitation of substations, augmentation of the \ncontrol systems, and enhanced metering. It will allow better optimization of the control systems \nand monitoring of power flows. The other key building blocks that are key elements of the \nRegional  Power  Trade  Action  Plan  include  legal/regulatory  compatibility,  transmission \nownership,  open  access  transmission,  more  comprehensive  sales  contracts,  transmission \npricing, voluntary trading, a grid code, a metering code, ancillary services pricing, and hard \ncurrency contracts and settlement. The trading envisaged would be a mixture of long- and short-\nterm contracts between the respective utilities on the basis of mutual economic advantage.  \n \n27.  Regional Wholesale Market Scenario. Once voluntary economic trade has been well \nestablished and a substantially enhanced level of regional power trade has been achieved, it will \nbe appropriate to move to the establishment of a regional wholesale power trading pool. In the \nmedium term, it is anticipated that the power sector in each country of the region will be fully \nrestructured to achieve independent and commercial operation. In addition, each country will \nhave  fully  unbundled  its  electricity  sector  with  independent  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution. Transmission, distribution, and energy companies will be operationally separate but \nmay still have the same owner. Private sector participation will be a feature providing funding, \nmanagement, and expertise. Indicative levels of trade for 2011 are shown in Appendix 6. ", "8 \n \n2.  Regional Consensus and Power Trade Action Plan \n28.  Government and utility representatives from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, \nand Uzbekistan attended a Regional Power Transmission Meeting on 22\u201323 April 2002 to \n(i) discuss  the  findings  of  TA  5960-RETA;  (ii) consider  the  recommendations  for  pursuing \nenhanced power trade relations among the Central Asian republics; and (iii) reach a consensus \non the way forward. The meeting agreed on a number of time-bound actions that would \nenhance the present power trading relations and establish the foundation for the ultimate \nwholesale regional power market. The agreed action plan explicitly addresses the problem \nareas identified in paras. 4 to 11 and is presented in Appendix 7. It covers the key areas of \npolicy reform necessary for trade, regional institutional arrangements, technical investment \nrequirements and operating protocols, commercial and financial arrangements, and individual \ncountry reforms.  The governments of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan have formally endorsed the \naction plan and have committed, as a condition of the loan, to implement the actions within their \ndirect control and to take an active role in the implementation of the necessary cooperative \nactions involving other countries.  \n \n29.  The governments of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan have further committed, as a condition of \nthe loan, to implement a Power Trade Relations Agreement that will enhance their bilateral \ntrade relations. The agreement was negotiated in November 2002 and is to be implemented by \n31 December 2003. It involves the following: \n \n(i)  establishment of a policy of open access to the transmission networks in each \ncountry; \n(ii)  development  and  use  of  a  transparent  methodology  for  transmission  tariff \ncalculation including procedures for asset valuation and fair return on capital; \n(iii)  introduction of a compatible standard metering protocol that will provide the \nframework for the collection, analysis, and management of power exchanges; \n(iv)  development and use of a pro-forma contract to be used for bilateral power \ntrading  \n(v)  development  and  agreement  on  pricing  arrangements  for  ancillary  services \n(reserve capacity, voltage control, etc.); \n(vi)  resolution  of  all  outstanding  issues  relating  to  the  use,  management,  and \nmaintenance of cross-border transmission facilities; \n(vii)  agreement on an annual contract for power trade that will, among other things, \nconsider the mutually beneficial utilization of and payment for excess hydropower \nenergy; and \n(viii)  initiation and leadership of a working group with the nonparticipating countries to \ndevelop the institutional framework for regional power trade and support the \nimplementation of the Regional Power Trade Action Plan. \n30.  Cooperation with USAID will be important for the implementation of the institutional \naspects of the Project. USAID provided expert support in the area of power trade during the \nprocessing of the Project, and during the negotiation of the Power Trade Relations Agreement. \nA 5-year program of assistance was prepared and covers the institutional support required to \n(i) implement  the  Regional  Power  Trade  Action  Plan  including  support  for  intercountry \ninstitutional and technical working groups to prepare necessary protocols to enhance trade and \nultimately  establish  a  wholesale  power  market,  and  (ii) establish  UDC  as  an  independent ", "9 \ncommercial  enterprise.  Under  the  program  USAID  has  committed  initially  to  provide  the \ntechnical support for the implementation of the Power Trade Relations Agreement and to \nundertake a needs assessment of UDC to incorporate the monitoring and control of water \ndispatch as well as electric power dispatch.3 \n3.  Technical Features \n31.  The reliability of the 500 kV network is a prerequisite to the development of regional \npower trade\u2014trade cannot effectively take place as long as the system does not have an \nacceptable level of reliability. The existing grid is old and the reliability is very low due to \nfrequent failures of equipment. The rehabilitation of the major substation equipment within the \nmain power corridors will reduce the number of forced outages and increase the amount of \ndelivered energy. This will benefit both the national and regional power systems. \n32.  Upgrading  the  NDC  and  ADCs  and  associated  telecommunications  is  essential  to \nensure safe and reliable operation of the national systems and improve the reliability of the \ninterconnected transmission system with the aim of enhancing regional electricity trade. Closer \nsupervision of the national network operation and loading as well as monitoring and initiation of \ncorrective  measures  to  comply  with  steady  state  and  dynamic  stability  will  allow  optimal \nutilization of the grid networks and power plants. This will result in a reduction of transmission \nlosses and in fuel cost savings for thermal power plants. Planning software will allow the \nnational utilities to adjust the existing automatic schemes, within the stability limits and will better \nenable prevention of the collapse of the whole system in case of major failure. This will benefit \nboth the national and regional power systems. \n33.  Accurate and real-time metering at the borders of the national grid and at the interface \nwith large customers (connected to the transmission system) is essential for measuring and \nbilling purposes and is essential for any development of trade. Improved metering systems will \nallow the introduction of a market for ancillary services, which will enhance regional cooperation \namong the Central Asian republics. It will further resolve disputes over the payment of electricity \ntransfer and, in the long run, introduce savings through improved energy efficiency. \n34.  The rehabilitation of UDC is necessary to ultimately achieve the full benefit of the Project \nin terms of optimization of regional network operation and reduction of losses. The upgrade of \nUDC will allow real-time, overall control of the regional network. This will permit a better \nutilization  of  the  installed  generation  capacity,  reduction  of  fuel  consumption,  as  well  as \nreduction of transmission losses through improved operation of the regional grid network. \n \n4.  Support for the Reconstruction of Afghanistan \n35.  The Project will facilitate power exchange between the Central Asian power system and \nAfghanistan. There exists a 60 km double circuit 110 kV transmission line linking Kunduz in \nAfghanistan to Tajikistan, and a 71 km double circuit 220 kV transmission line linking Khulm \nsubstation in Afghanistan to Surkhan substation in Uzbekistan. Electricity exports stopped in the \n1990s due to payment arrears. Limited exports to Afghanistan have recently resumed. There is \nalso long-term potential to export power across Afghanistan to Pakistan. \n \n                                                 \n3  Depending on the success of the initial work and provided there is continued government commitment, USAID may \nconsider continuing support for the program.

For the Tajik component, the Borrower will be the Republic of Tajikistan for an ADB loan \nin  various  currencies  equivalent  to  15.133  million  Special  Drawing  Rights  [$20 million \nequivalent] from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with 1% interest during the grace period and \n1.5% during the amortization period and with an amortization period of 32 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years. The Government will relend the proceeds of the ADB loan to Barki \nTajik, denominated in local currency, at ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources interest rate applicable \nto the LIBOR-based lending facility with a repayment period of 25 years, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by the Government. Barki Tajik will \nfinance  the  $4.6 million  equivalent  local  currency  cost  of  the  Tajik  component.  Parallel \ncofinancing of $2.4 million for transmission rehabilitation under the Tajik component will be \nprovided by the OPEC Fund and is expected to be approved in December 2002. \n \n39.  For the Uzbek component, the Borrower will be the Republic of Uzbekistan for an ADB \nloan of $70 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. The loan will have a 25-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of \n1.0%, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \nThe Government will relend the proceeds of the ADB loan to Uzbekenergo in the same currency \nand on the same terms and conditions as the ADB loan to the Government. Uzbekenergo will \nfinance $18.6 million of the foreign cost and all the $10.4 million equivalent local currency cost \nof the Uzbek component. Cofinancing of $49.0 million for transmission rehabilitation under the \nUzbek component will be provided by EBRD and is expected to be approved in April 2003. \n \n40.  ADB financing of 47% is higher than the current 40% limit for Uzbekistan as a Group C \ncountry under the graduation policy and is justified on the following grounds: (i) the Project is \nalmost entirely foreign exchange cost, (ii) the ADB loan will finance only one half of the total \nproject  foreign  exchange  requirement,  and  (iii) Uzbekistan  is  facing  a  shortage  of  foreign \nexchange. \n \n41.  In the cost estimates, both Tajikistan and Uzbekistan have agreed to allocations of \nfunding for the upgrading of the UDC. However, the use of the allocated funds will be subject to \nUDC being reestablished within a new institutional framework acceptable to the other Central \nAsian countries, and with the agreed participation of these countries. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n42.  Barki Tajik will be the executing agency (EA) responsible for overall supervision and \ncoordination of the Tajikistan component of the Project. A project implementation unit (PIU) has \nbeen established under Loan 1817-TAJ: Power Rehabilitation Project and will be expanded to \ncover the Project. The PIU will be responsible for day-to-day implementation, including review of \ntender documents, bid evaluation, and supervision of installation, as well as the necessary \nliaison  among  Barki  Tajik,  contractors,  and  ADB.  The  PIU,  which  will  be  supported  by \nimplementation  consultants  financed  under  the  loan,  will  be  staffed  with  suitably  qualified \npersonnel. A project steering committee (PSC) will also be established to provide guidance to \nthe Project. The PSC will coordinate activities at the government level  and serve as a forum for \ndiscussions on important issues. The PSC will be chaired by the Minister of Energy and its \nmembers will include  representatives from the Ministry of Energy, Barki Tajik, and the PIU \nManager. The PSC will meet when required, but in any event, at least twice a year.  \n ", "12 \n43.  Uzbekenergo will be the EA responsible for overall supervision and coordination of the \nUzbek component of the Project. A PIU has been established. The PIU, which will be supported \nby implementation consultants financed under the loan, will be staffed with suitably qualified \npersonnel. A PSC will also be established to provide guidance to the Project. The PSC will \ncoordinate activities at the government level  and serve as a forum for discussions on important \nissues. The PSC will be chaired by the Head, Energy Department, Cabinet of Ministers, and its \nmembers will include representatives from the Energy Department, Uzbekenergo, Ministry of \nFinance and Ministry of Macroeconomics, and the PIU Manager. PSC will meet when required, \nbut in any event, at least twice a year.  \n \n44.  For the implementation of the UDC component, a special PIU will act as EA and consist \nof representatives from each of the regional utilities. It will also act as a standardization \ncoordinator  for  functional  requirements  and  the  data  to  be  acquired  as  well  as  ensuring \ncompatibility of interfaces between dispatching, communications, and metering the systems \ninstalled in the individual countries.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n45.  It is envisaged that project implementation will start in 2003 and be completed by June \n2006 for Tajikistan and December 2007 for Uzbekistan. Loan closing will be in December 2006 \nand June 2008, respectively. The project implementation schedules are shown in Appendix 9.  \n \n3.  Procurement \n46.  Procurement of ADB-financed goods and services under the proposed Project, including \ncontracts for the design, supply, installation, and commissioning of the project facilities, will be \ncarried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for  Procurement  through  international \ncompetitive bidding (ICB). A list of the proposed procurement packages, the financer of the \npackage,  and  their  mode  of  procurement  is  attached  as  Appendix  10.  Barki  Tajik  and \nUzbekenergo have agreed to take steps so that bidders, suppliers, contractors, and consultants \nunder contracts financed through the loan observe the highest standards of transparency during \nthe procurement and execution of such contracts. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n47.  The services of internationally recruited consulting firms, to be financed by ADB, will be \nrequired  to  provide  project  management  services  and  assistance  to  Barki  Tajik  and \nUzbekenergo in such matters as detailed design, tendering, supervision of installation, testing, \nand commissioning of equipment and training for operation and maintenance (O&M). In each \ncountry, consultants will support the PIU and will be required to transfer project management \nskills to PIU staff. Outline terms of reference and cost estimates are presented in Appendix 11. \nFor the Uzbek component the services of an internationally-recruited consulting firm, to be \nfinanced by ADB, will be required to develop a computerized management information system \nfor  effective  management  of  Uzbekenergo  and  its  subsidiary  companies.  Outline  terms  of \nreference and cost estimates are presented in Appendix 14. All consulting services under the \nProject will be recruited in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, using \nquality and cost-based selection methods on the basis of a full technical proposal. Other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB will be used for the engagement of domestic consultants. \nThere will be four contracts in total: (i) 38 person-months of international and 50 person-months \nof local consulting services will be engaged in Tajikistan for transmission rehabilitation, dispatch \nupgrading, and UDC; (ii) 110 person-months of international and 130 person-months of local \nconsulting services will be engaged in Uzbekistan for transmission rehabilitation; (iii) 45 person-", "13 \nmonths of international and 50 person-months of local consulting services will be engaged in \nUzbekistan for dispatch upgrading, including UDC; and (iv) 15 person-months of international \nand 30 person-months of local consulting services will be engaged for the development of the \npower sector management information system in Uzbekistan.  \n \n5.  Retroactive Financing \n48.  Retroactive financing of reasonable expenditures incurred after 15 November 2002 for \nconsulting services was approved for the Uzbek component up to a maximum of $500,000. \nSuch financing will facilitate Project implementation prior to the effectiveness of the ADB and \nEBRD loans. The Government was advised that approval of retroactive financing does not \ncommit ADB to financing of the Project. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n49.  All disbursements under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with the ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook. Direct payment procedures will be utilized for the procurement \nand consulting services contracts. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n50.  There will be continued monitoring and evaluation of project implementation, with timely \nreporting. The EAs will prepare quarterly reports on progress of project implementation and \nfurnish ADB and cofinancers with copies of these reports. ADB will review implementation of the \nProject on a regular basis, at least once a year, and will monitor overall performance of the EAs. \nWithin 3 months of project completion, the EAs will furnish ADB with a project completion report \ncovering  details  of  implementation  and  other  information  required  by  ADB.  The  EAs  will \nmaintain separate records and accounts for the Project and will have the accounts audited \nannually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. Copies of audited project accounts will be \nprovided to ADB within 6 months of the end of each relevant fiscal year. The EAs will also \nprovide ADB with copies of its audited corporate accounts within 6 months of the end of its fiscal \nyear. The EAs will adopt international accounting standards for their financial reporting. ADB \ndisbursements will be suspended if delays of 6 months in submission of audited financial \nstatements occur. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n51.  The EAs will carry out all benefit monitoring and evaluation activities of the Project. \nThese will be undertaken in accordance with the relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Benefit Monitoring \nand Evaluation: A Handbook for Bank Staff, Staff of Executing Agencies and Consultants. At the \nbeginning of project implementation, the EAs will submit to ADB a report on the benchmark \ninformation, to be followed by annual performance reports during project implementation. Upon \nproject  completion,  a  comprehensive  report  will  be  submitted.  In  addition,  3  years  after \ncompletion, the EAs will finance out of their own funds benefit monitoring and evaluation studies \nto assess the overall benefits of the Project. \n \n52.  An integral component of the project monitoring and evaluation will be to assess over \ntime  the  poverty  reduction  impacts  of  the  Project.  With  support  from  the  implementation \nconsultants, benchmark surveys will be undertaken, and various indicators will be formulated \nand then monitored throughout and following project implementation. Trends in electricity use by \ndomestic consumers by income level, changes in electrical appliance ownership, rural versus ", "14 \nurban  consumption  patterns,  small  enterprise  electricity  use,  and  other  indicators  will  be \nmonitored. \n \n9.  Project Review \n53.  In 2004, ADB will, together with the EAs, carry out a midterm review of the Project, \nfocusing  on  all  regional  policy,  institutional,  administrative,  organizational,  technical, \nenvironmental, social, economic, financial, and other relevant aspects that may have an impact \non  the  performance  of  the  Project  and  its  continuing  viability.  The  review  will  cover  the \nimplementation of the Regional Power Trade Action Plan and the Power Trade Relations \nAgreement. \n \nG.  The Executing Agencies \n54.  The EAs for the Project will be Barki Tajik in Tajikistan and Uzbekenergo in Uzbekistan. \nEach country is implementing reforms in its power sector and details of the reforms are included \nin Appendix 12. An overview of the EAs is provided below. \n \n1.  Barki Tajik \n55.  Barki  Tajik  is  the  state-owned  utility  responsible  for  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution  of  electricity  in  Tajikistan.  Prior  to  the  country\u2019s  independence,  the  entity  was \nadministratively a government agency. In 1992, it became a state joint stock holding company. \nAlthough it is fully owned by the Government, Barki Tajik enjoys autonomous status according \nto its charter. \n \n56.  Under the present institutional arrangements, Barki Tajik consists of a network of 10 \nsubsidiary power generation companies, 11 subsidiary distribution companies, and 8 supporting \ncompanies  including  a  research  institute  and  construction  companies  (Appendix  13). The \nchairperson of Barki Tajik, who has overall responsibility for operations, reports directly to the \nPrime Minister, and is appointed by the Government with no fixed term. The chairperson is \nassisted by the first deputy chairperson (chief engineer), who manages Barki Tajik\u2019s day-to-day \noperations, and six deputy chairpersons who are in charge of the technical departments, \nsupporting services, and subsidiary power generation and distribution companies. Since 1999, \nthe Government has created business units for some of these subsidiaries, with ownership \nrights vested directly in the State Property Committee on behalf of the Government but with \nbusiness management responsibilities assigned to Barki Tajik. \n \n57.  In 2000, Barki Tajik was incorporated  as a commercial entity, and a separation of \noperations has taken place along its business unit lines for generation, transmission, and \ndistribution, but within the same management control. As agreed under Loan 1817-TAJ, the \nEnergy Law was passed setting up the Ministry of Energy as the policy unit of the Government. \nTariffs are regulated by Ministry of Finance (MOF). Supported by ADB TA, Barki Tajik is \ncurrently  implementing  international  accounting  practices4  and  modernized  consumer \naccounting systems and meter reading systems.5 \n \n                                                 \n4  TA 3601-TAJ: Introducing International Accounting  Standards at Barki Tajik, for $500,000, approved on 20 \nDecember 2000. \n5  TA 3600-TAJ: Improving Barki Tajik\u2019s Billing and Collection Systems, for $500,000, approved on 20 December \n2000. ", "15 \na.  Past Financial Performance \n58.  Barki Tajik's past financial performance has been improving but revenues are still only \nsufficient to cover cash operating expenses. Electricity sales remained almost unchanged in \n2001 after a sharp decline of 9.5% in 2000, mostly as a result of lack of hydropower generation \n(dry summer) and declining growth in industrial demand. Accounts receivable remain a major \nproblem despite a 40% reduction between 1999 and 2001. At the end of 2001, they stood at \n$23.3 million or equivalent to 7.5 months of gross billings, which exceeds the agreed target \nunder the previous loan of 6 months by December 2001.  \n \nb.  Financial Projections \n59.  Cost recovery has been considered in two ways. Under the project preparatory TA, the \naverage incremental cost of supply was estimated in economic terms to be 2.5 cents/kilowatt-\nhour (c/kWh) on the basis of rehabilitation of existing assets and completion of an unfinished \nhydropower station to meet new demand. By contrast, the financial projections, with assets \nrevalued indicatively, indicate that a reasonable level of financial cost recovery based on a 6% \nreturn would require a tariff level of about 2.2 c/kWh at 2002 prices. Therefore, the target level \nfor tariffs over the medium term should be 2.2\u20132.5 c/kWh. \n \n60.  The current average tariff is 0.95 c/kWh. Under Loan 1817-TAJ: Power Rehabilitation \nProject, by December 2001 industrial tariffs were to be increased to 1.03 c/kWh to achieve \n100% cost recovery; this was achieved in April 2002. Domestic tariffs were to be increased to \n$0.75/kWh to achieve 50% cost recovery by December 2002. This will entail an 83% increase \nover present levels and the Government has notified ADB that it will implement the same by \nend-December 2002. The first 150 kWh block of consumption will, however, maintained at 0.18 \nc/kWh to protect low-income consumers.  \n \n61.  In  addition  to  the  2002  tariff  adjustments,  the  financial  projections  assume  tariff \nincreases for 2003 onward to maintain the covenanted 90% operating ratio and to achieve a 6% \nrate of return by 2006. Given the large tariff increases in 2002 and the expected negative impact \non accounts receivable, the current loan covenant for accounts receivable of 3 months by \nDecember 2002 is now targeted for achievement by December 2004. Due to lower sales than \npreviously projected, the rate of return covenant of 6% on revalued net fixed assets in service \nwill become applicable a year later, i.e., from 2006. \n \n2.  Uzbekenergo \n62.  Uzbekenergo  is  the  state-owned  joint-stock  company  responsible  for  generation, \ntransmission, and distribution of electricity and heat in Uzbekistan. In 2001, it was created out of \nthe former power ministry. Under the present institutional arrangement, Uzbekenergo consists \nof a network of subsidiary power companies, including all power stations, the distribution and \ntransmission  network,  and  other  energy-related  companies  (the  organizational  chart  is  in \nAppendix 13). The Government\u2019s reform program envisages that all distribution entities will be \nmade  shareholding  companies  by  2003,  followed  by  generation  entities  by  2005.  The \ntransmission network will remain in government hands for the foreseeable future. Only minority \nshareholdings will be offered to the private sector in the thermal generating companies, with the \nmajority  shareholding  remaining  with  the  Government.  Currently,  each  power  station  is \noperating as a separate legal entity. By the end of 2002, each distribution entity will operate \nindependently  and  accounting separation for the transmission company is expected to be \nfinalized. Under the Project, support will be provided to develop a computerized management \ninformation system for effective management of the 38 subsidiary companies. The terms of ", "16 \nreference, cost, and equipment requirements are presented in Appendix 14. Support is also \nbeing provided by EBRD in the form of a tariff study and the World Bank is to undertake a study \nto consider future power sector restructuring and reform. \n \na.  Past Financial Performance \n63.  Uzbekenergo has incurred losses for the last 2 years. Electricity sales grew at an annual \naverage rate of only 2% between 1999 and 2001. Accounts receivable, which are one of the key \nconcerns of Uzbekenergo\u2019s operation, increased from 4.4 months to 5.2 months between 1999 \nand 2001. In an operating environment of high foreign cost expenditures and local currency \nrevenues the large depreciation of the currency has severely impacted Uzbekenergo\u2019s finances. \nDespite tariff increases of 40% between 1999 and 2001, currency depreciation of 70% resulted \nin the tariff falling in dollar terms during the period. In this environment, despite subsidized fuel \nprices at only 20% of economic cost, Uzbekenergo\u2019s finances have worsened. \n \nb.  Financial Projections \n64.  Under the project preparatory TA, the average incremental cost of supply was estimated \nin economic terms to be 3.0 c/kWh on the basis of rehabilitation of existing assets to meet \nincreasing demand. This should be the target level for Uzbekenergo's tariffs over the medium \nterm. This is consistent with the financial projections that show that a tariff level of 3.3 c/kWh (in \n2002 prices) is required for Uzbekenergo to achieve a 6% return on indicatively revalued net \nfixed assets.  \n \n65.  The Government is committed to increasing tariffs to cost-recovery levels over the \nmedium term even as Uzbekenergo faces further cost side pressure as a result of expected gas \nprice liberalization. During 2002, in quarterly steps, the tariff has been increased by 56% to \nachieve an average tariff level of 1.1 c/kWh. Further tariff increases are planned for 2003. \nUzbekenergo is expected to breakeven in 2003 and show profits from 2004 onward. The \nfinancial analysis shows that with the proposed increases, the working ratio can be gradually \nreduced to 70% by 2006 from 111% in 2002. This means that 30% of the annual revenue will be \navailable over and above cash operating costs for investment and debt service. Uzbekenergo \nhas agreed to achieve a working ratio of at least 90% in 2003, 85% in 2004, 75% in 2005 and \n70% in 2004 and onward. It has also agreed to reduce accounts receivable to an acceptable \nlevel of 3 months by 31 December 2004. \n \n \nIII.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n66.  The project benefits and impacts have been assessed along with the potential risks \nassociated with the Project. The integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the \ncosts.  \n \nA.  Financial and Economic Benefits \n67.  From a least-cost perspective, there is no technical alternative to the rehabilitation of the \nhigh-voltage transmission substations because the further deterioration of substation equipment \nwould increasingly make the transmission system unreliable to deliver electricity from the major \ngenerating plants to regional and domestic customers. The automation of dispatch control and \nmetering are also essential for the optimal operation of the regional and the domestic power \nsystems and for economic regional trade. To assess the financial and economic benefits of the ", "17 \nProject, a viability analysis was undertaken. The analysis and the assumptions are in Appendix \n15 and the results are summarized below. \n \n68.  Financial analysis from the perspective of Barki Tajik and Uzbekenergo has been based \non a capital cost (base cost plus physical contingencies) of $23.6 million and $125.1 million, \nrespectively, over the life of the equipment. As a result of the rehabilitation of the 500 kV \nsubstations, forced outages are expected to be reduced by an estimated 45%, which will \nprovide additional amounts of electricity to consumers and reduced interruption to economic \nactivities. The rehabilitation works will also reduce the high cost emergency and unscheduled \nmaintenance and serious collateral damages (i.e., in case of exploding old equipment damaging \nadjacent equipment) that is presently experienced.  \n \n69.  Load dispatch upgrading will result in optimization of power generation and an improved \ndispatch regime that will increase the output from hydropower stations and will lead to lower \nspinning reserve requirements. As a consequence, fuel and other variable costs for thermal \npower stations will be reduced. A 1% reduction for fuels and a 0.5% reduction in variable \noperating costs are expected. As a result of improved power system control, it is estimated that \noutages can be further reduced by 25%. More equal loading of the entire system leads to \nreduced losses in the transmission system. A 6% reduction has been assumed. Finally, new \nfiber optic communications lines will reduce telephone costs and even provide revenues from \nthe rent of communications links to telephone companies. \n \n70.  Reduced  outages  and  transmission  losses  were  valued  at  the  average  financial \nelectricity tariff projected to increase in real terms in line with the financial projections. On this \nbasis, and after allowance for adequate O&M costs and income tax, the financial internal rate of \nreturn for the Tajikistan and Uzbekistan components of the Project is estimated to be 7.0% and \n11.3%, respectively, which, when compared with an estimated weighted average cost of project \ncapital  of  about  4%,  indicates  that  the  Project  should  be  financially  viable  for  both  the \nparticipating utilities. Financial viability depends mainly on tariff reform and will be able to \nwithstand variations in capital cost and the level of benefits. \n \n71.  The viability of the Project was analyzed from a broader national perspective in terms of \nits economic internal rate of return (EIRR). The financial costs were adjusted to reflect the \neconomic opportunities forgone and realized on account of the Project. The capital cost for the \nTajikistan and Uzbekistan components of $23.2 million and $118.7 million, respectively, were \nused. Reduced outages were valued at a conservative value of energy not served of 20.0 c/kWh \nand transmission loss reduction on the basis of willingness to pay (estimated for Tajikistan and \nUzbekistan to be 5.0 c/kWh and 4.5 c/kWh, respectively). On this basis, the EIRRs for the \nTajikistan and Uzbekistan components of the Project are estimated to be 30.0% and 24.2%, \nrespectively.  \n \n72.  The results of a sensitivity analysis show that even with adverse changes in the key \nassumptions, the Project remains financially and economically viable. The analysis shows that \nfor Tajikistan and Uzbekistan the benefits (in terms of value or quantity) would have to be 66% \nand 53% less, respectively, or the capital cost would have to be 147% and 104% more, \nrespectively, before the EIRR would fall to the ADB\u2019s minimum cutoff value of 12%. \n \nB.  Regional Benefits of Trade \n73.  The  foregoing  viability  analysis  considered  the  Project  benefits  for  Tajikistan  and \nUzbekistan, excluding the benefits of increased trade. Increased power trade facilitated by the \nProject would yield substantial additional benefits. Benefits result from a number of factors that ", "18 \ncan  be  grouped  into  two  categories:  (i) reduced  operating  costs  and  (ii) lower generation \ncapacity and expansion requirements.  \n \n74.  Lower overall generation costs will result from increased trade. This is of particular \nimportance in Central Asian countries where there are huge hydropower resources available in \ncertain  countries  (the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan),  while  other  countries  (Kazakhstan, \nTurkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) have immense reserves of fossil fuels. The two complement \neach other to achieve least-cost generation. Also, by working as one large integrated system, \noperating costs can be reduced as a consequence of reduced individual spinning reserve \nrequirements, the joint provision of and exchange of ancillary services, the possibility to support \nand better supply loads at the periphery of an individual system, and generally an increased \nservice  quality  and  reliability  standards  of  power  supply.  The  feasibility  study  consultants \nestimated  that  these  benefits  would  be  in  the  order  of  $25\u201330 million  per  year  by  2011, \nassuming that power would be supplied from the low-cost generation (hydropower) countries to \nthe other countries. \n \n75.  Reduced capacity requirements result, since reserve capacities can be used jointly and \nthus the total installed reserve capacity can be lower. Pooling of reserve capacities makes it \npossible to reduce future expansion of power system generation and reduce total capital \nrequired for new power stations. Moreover, for future expansion planning it will also be possible \nto coordinate power system expansion planning and take advantage of economies of scale \nthrough the installation of large generation units that would not be viable in the individual \nsystems. Finally, lower capacity requirements can also result from the fact that peak load hours \nslightly differ amongst the Central Asian countries. It is thus possible to improve the overall \nsystem load factor and equalize the daily load curve. The feasibility consultants estimated that \nwith trade, by 2011, 900 MW of additional capacity could be avoided, the fixed cost savings of \nwhich would be about $40 million per year. \n \n76.  Both Tajikistan and Uzbekistan would enjoy a share of the above benefits. In the short \nterm the benefits of enhanced trade were estimated on the basis that agreement is reached for \nUzbekistan to import the surplus summer energy available from the Nurek power station in \nTajikistan, on average 1,000 GWh per year as envisaged in the bilateral Power Trade Relations \nAgreement. Instead of spilling and wasting this water, as at present, the net economic benefit \nthat could be shared by both countries is estimated at $12 million based on 1.2 c/kWh. The \nbenefit is calculated as avoided generation costs (fuel and variable cost) to Uzbekistan of 1.9 \nc/kWh less transmission cost of 0.5 c/kWh and the negligible Tajik generation cost of 0.2 c/kWh. \nThe share of the benefit will be based on the price agreed. The upper bound price that \nUzbekistan could pay is 1.65 c/kWh and the lower bound price that Tajikistan could accept is \n0.45 c/kWh, assuming transmission costs are equally shared. This gives a clear demonstration \nof the potential benefits of trade and would, if included in the foregoing viability analysis, \nsignificantly enhance returns. \n \nC.  Social and Poverty Impact \n77.  The primary beneficiaries of the Project will be business enterprises and the population \nwho will benefit from improved quality of electricity services and the long-term cost reductions \nresulting from the economic dispatch of power plants and the overall efficiency gains from \nenhanced power trade. Since effectively all the population of both Tajikistan and Uzbekistan \nhave access to electricity, the project benefits will be universal.  \n \n78.  Electricity supply is a prerequisite for improving the economic situation and quality of life, \nas it is required for agriculture (irrigation and drainage), drinking water supply, health, education, ", "19 \nindustry, and small-scale enterprises. Adequate and reliable power supply will remove an \nimportant obstacle to investment and facilitate operation of private enterprises. Agriculture will \nbenefit due to improved irrigation and drainage. Direct and indirect health benefits include \n(i) improved drainage that will reduce the risks from malaria, and saline water in farmland and \nwater tables; (ii) improved water supply through use of electric pumps; and (iii) ability to boil \nwater efficiently thus reducing risks from unsafe water. Provision of lighting and heating in \nschools will improve the education facilities and increase school enrollment. \n \n79.  In terms of poverty impact, the difference between the financial and economic net \npresent values, and consequent gains and losses for different stakeholders, provide the basis \nfor considering the impact of the Project on the poor. For the poverty impact assessment, the \nproject beneficiaries are divided into three groups: utility, consumers, and government economy. \nThe net economic benefits of the latter two groups are distributed between poor and nonpoor. \nThe increased, more efficient, and reliable electricity supply resulting from the Project will \nbenefit the poor directly and indirectly. Net economic benefits accruing to the poor over the life \nof the Project are estimated at about $46 million\u2013$17 million for Tajikistan and $29 million for \nUzbekistan (Appendix 15). These estimates are conservative as the benefits of trade and some \nindirect economic and social benefits are not considered. The poverty impact ratio, which \nexpresses the proportion of net economic benefits of the Project accruing to the poor, is \nestimated at 41%\u201357% for Tajikistan and 35% for Uzbekistan. Hence, a substantial portion of \nthe project benefits will go to the poor.  \n \n80.  Under the project preparatory TA, a social assessment was carried out and a summary \nof  the  assessment  is  in  Appendix  16.  The  assessment  found  that  the  risk  of  negative \nsocioeconomic impacts is small or nonexistent. The main conclusions are as follows:  \n \n(i)  In terms of output-using employment, it is expected that the improved adequacy \nand reliability of electricity supply will support the creation of new employment \nopportunities in terms of higher productivity for all sectors of the economy. In \nUzbekistan, 6,000 output-using jobs are expected to be created, and in Tajikistan \nthe number is expected to be 2,200. \n \n(ii)  There will only be a small direct input-supplying employment impact since the \nProject involves relatively few civil works and the expertise required for the \ninstallation of the new equipment is unavailable in either country.  \n \n(iii)  Gender inequality was identified in terms of poverty incidence and wage levels. It \nis expected that the Project\u2019s poverty impact will be greater for men than  for \nwomen since men are expected to be in a better position to take advantage of \nemployment opportunities as a result of a more reliable power supply.  \n \n(iv)  Affordability of electricity tariffs is a potential issue that needs to be considered as \nincreases are implemented to cover the cost and ensure sustainable supply of \nelectricity. Tajikistan maintains a lifeline tariff and the EBRD tariff study will \nconsider the tariff levels for each consumer category in Uzbekistan.  \n \n(v)  There  will  be  no  issues  of  resettlement  or  indigenous  peoples  since  the \nrehabilitation and upgrading activities will be undertaken in existing facilities. \n ", "20 \nD.  Environmental Impacts \n81.  The Project will have considerable environmental benefits as a result of more optimal \nsystem operation, transmission loss reduction, and substitution of thermal generation with \nrenewable hydropower as a result of enhanced power trading. It is estimated that the energy \nsavings as a result of efficiency improvements alone in 2011 will be 330 GWh and the direct fuel \nsavings 274,000 tons of coal equivalent. \n \n82.  The Project is not expected to have any major adverse impact on the environment. It \nconsists entirely of rehabilitation of existing structures and facilities. The rehabilitation includes \nreplacing switchgear and transformers at existing substations and retrofitting new components \nto existing equipment. The Project has been classified as Category B in ADB\u2019s environmental \nclassification system. An initial environmental examination was undertaken according to ADB\u2019s \nguidelines at the feasibility study stage (Appendix 17).  \n \n83.  The  adverse  impacts  of  the  Project  will  be  very  small,  and  will  be  limited  to  the \nconstruction period. During the stringing of the new optical ground wire, trucks and equipment \nneed access over the whole route of the transmission line, i.e., over 1,000 km in Uzbekistan and \nabout 300 km in Tajikistan. Special arrangements have to be made in order to minimize the \nimpacts  on  agriculture,  such  as  seasonal  implementation  schedule,  crops  compensation \nmechanisms, stringing under tension, etc. The following waste volumes are estimated to be \ngenerated: (i) 26 tons of aluminum, (ii) 601 tons of steel, (iii) 625 tons of ceramic insulators, \n(iv) 94 tons of insulation oil, and (v) 125 tons of copper. Additional chemical products such as \nlead, acid, and electrochemical condensers will be disposed from the rehabilitation of control \nand protection system as well as from the direct current system, especially from the batteries. \nThe ceramic wastes will be disposed in landfills. The insulation oil will be cleaned and filtered, \nand partly reused or sold as fuel oil. Lead, steel, aluminum, and copper will be sold. Acid and \nother chemical components will be conditioned and sent to specialized laboratories. Adverse \nimpacts can be readily mitigated through good engineering and construction practices. No \nnegative impact will persist during the operation phase. The governments and EAs have agreed \nto undertake necessary mitigative measures during optical ground wire stringing and to remove \nand dispose of all waste materials associated with the Project, in a safe and environmentally \nresponsible manner. An environmental monitoring program will be prepared and implemented. \n \nE.  Project Risks \n84.  The Project has been formulated to minimize potential technical and economic risks. The \nmain risks are identified and discussed below. \n \n85.  Political  Commitment.  Active  involvement  of  participating  countries  and  continued \ncommitment to improve energy supply services, energy trade and to resolve the energy-water \nnexus will be key to maximizing the benefits of the Project. ADB\u2019s continued engagement with \nthe cooperating countries and active role in regional cooperation as an honest broker will help \nfacilitate improved regional relations for the benefit of all the countries. In the event that regional \ntrade does not achieve expectations, the Project investments will remain viable, as they have \nbeen shown to be fully justified on the basis of the domestic benefits alone. \n \n86.  Financial Sustainability. For the utilities to be able to provide counterpart contributions \nand meet ongoing O&M costs requires financial viability. This implies that tariffs need to be \nadjusted to allow the utilities to (i) fully recover operating costs and earn a reasonable return on \ncapital, and (ii) generate sufficient revenue to cover the contribution to the Project and to meet ", "21 \ndebt service requirements. In addition, the utilities have to improve collection performance. \nFinancial covenants have been agreed to mitigate this risk. \n \n87.  Project Delay. There is risk of project delays due to (i) the nature of rehabilitation \nprojects and since they will be implemented at several locations in parallel, and (ii) lack of \nexperience with ADB procurement under ICB and ADB\u2019s procurement procedures. The risk of \nproject delays would be actively managed through close monitoring of implementation progress \nby the PIU, which will be assisted by experienced international consultants, training in ADB\u2019s \nprocurement and disbursement procedures, and regular ADB review missions. \n \n88.  Cost Overruns. The risk of cost overruns due to (i) uncertainties in the precise scope of \nrehabilitation and upgrading work, and (ii) possible increases in inflation, is modest. The use of \nICB for procurement under all contracts funded by the ADB will minimize the risk of cost \noverruns, as will the use of turnkey contracts. Finally, the physical and price contingencies are \ndesigned to allow for uncertainties in project scope and in inflation. \n \n89.  Inadequate Plant Maintenance. Several measures have been included in the design of \nthe Project to reduce the potential risks of inadequate plant care and maintenance, which has \nbeen a problem in the past. An on-the-job training component has been included in each \ncontract  package  to  provide  exposure  to  the  proper  O&M  procedures  for  the  new  and \nrehabilitated equipment. International consultants will also provide training and O&M support \nduring implementation of the Project so that the rehabilitated and modernized facilities will be \nmanaged properly after commissioning.  \n \nIV.

Overview \n \n1.  The high-voltage (HV) transmission networks of South Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, \nTajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan are interconnected and form the Central Asia Power \nSystem. This transmission system was built up starting in the 1960s up to the dissolution of the \nSoviet Union in 1991, without any consideration of the borders of the five states and based \npurely on output maximization. The system consists of 3,770 kilometers (km) of 500 kilovolt (kV) \nlines,  16,200  km  of  220  kV  and  41,820  km  of  110  kV  lines.  The  installed  capacity  of \ntransformers in the substations of 110 kV voltage level and above amounts to more than 62,000 \nmegavolt-amperes (MVA), including 17,170 MVA at 500 kV substations and 22,300 MVA at 220 \nkV substations. \n \n2.  The majority of the transmission lines are single circuit lines. For reliability reasons \nvarious 500 kV and 220 kV ring configurations have been formed to avoid interruption of power \nsupply in case of an outage of a single section. There were plans for more 500 kV and 220 kV \nlines to complete further ring schemes but since the dissolution of the Soviet Union none have \nbeen built. Although to some extent the 220 kV system can take over load from the 500 kV \nsystem in the event of its outage, there are still various sections which do not have sufficient \ncapacity to cope with these situations. During such events, partial or total black-outs of the \nelectrical system have been recorded. The present condition of the electrical equipment in the \nsubstations  in  all  countries,  except  for  Kazakhstan,  requires  rehabilitation  and  substantial \nreplacement at all voltage levels. Most of the equipment has already reached the end of its \ntechnical service life.  \n \n3.  Total installed generation capacity amounts to close to 25,000 megawatt (MW), of which \n9,000 MW is hydro power plants (37%) and around 16,000 MW thermal power plants (63%). \nThe major hydro power plants are located in Kyrgyz Republic (2,950 MW hydro capacity) and in \nTajikistan (4,021 MW hydro capacity) whereas the major thermal power plants are located in \nUzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. Many of the power plants were constructed as long \nago as in the 1950s and 1960s, with no major overhaul since then, and so have reached the \nend of their technical service lives.  \n \nB.  Kazakhstan \n \n4.  The electrical network of Kazakhstan consists of two parts. The northern grid is part of \nthe Russian Federation, and the southern grid is part of the Central Asia Power System. A 500 \nkV single circuit line connects the northern and southern grids, which frequently shows stability \nproblems. The entire system comprises around 23,500 km of 1,150 kV, 500 kV, 330 kV and 220 \nkV transmission lines as well as three 1,150 kV and fifteen 500 kV substations. Moreover, it \nincludes around 440,000 km of power lines below the 220 kV level. In South Kazakhstan, the \ngrid consists of four 500/220 kV substations and about 1,080 km of 500 kV and 1,300 km of 220 \nkV transmission lines. The southern grid in Kazakhstan has an installed generation capacity of \n2,422 MW, of which 2,058 MW is thermal and 364 MW hydro plants. Total installed generation \ncapacity in Kazakhstan is around 16,000 MW (2,057 MW hydro, 8,100 MW conventional \nthermal and 5,622 MW combined heat and power (CHP) plants). 75% of the thermal power \nplants are coal fired plants, the rest uses oil and gas.  \n \n ", "Appendix 2           27 \nC.  Kyrgyz Republic \n \n5.  The electrical network in Kyrgyz Republic is connected by 500 kV and 220 kV lines with \nthe grids of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The system in the country includes about 540 km of \n500 kV and 1,250 km of 220 kV transmission lines. Apart from two CHP stations in Bishkek (742 \nMW)  and  Osh  (50  MW),  the  electricity  supply  system  of  Kyrgyz  Republic  depends  on \nhydropower as its primary energy source. Total installed generation capacity is about 3,742 \nMW, of which almost 3,100 MW is presently available. \n \nD.  Tajikistan \n \n6.  The HV transmission system in Tajikistan consists of a northern and a southern part \nwhich are connected only indirectly through the Uzbekistan system. Tajikistan is also connected \nwith Afghanistan via a 110 kV transmission line operated at 35 kV. Total lengths of the \ntransmission lines are 300 km and 1,200 km for the 500 kV and 220 kV systems respectively. In \naddition, about 2,800 km of 110 kV transmission lines is in operation. Tajikistan\u2019s generation \ncapacity currently consists of 4,021 MW of hydro capacity and a 300 MW CHP plant in \nDushanbe. The output of the CHP plant is currently severely limited because of fuel shortages. \n \nE.  Uzbekistan \n \n7.  The network of Uzbekistan is the main part of the Central Asia network supply linking the \nsystems of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. The HV transmission \nsystem consists primarily of some 1,700 km of 500 kV and 5,100 km of 220 kV lines. Uzbekistan \nhas a 220 kV transmission connection to Afghanistan. Uzbekistan also represents close to 50% \nof the generation capacity of the joint Central Asian system (11,600 MW of 25,000 MW). It \nincludes 9,873 MW of thermal and 1,705 MW of hydro plants. Of this installed capacity, around \n8,400 MW of thermal power and 1,400 MW of hydropower are actually available for generation. \n \nF.  Turkmenistan \n \n8.  The electrical network of Turkmenistan is connected with the network of Uzbekistan by \ntwo transmission lines, one of 500 kV and the other 220 kV. Turkmenistan uses only thermal \npower plants with an installed capacity of 2,600 MW, of which presently only around 1,500 MW \nis available for operation. \n ", "28           Appendix 3 \nPROBLEM ANALYSIS\nLimited Economic\nDevelopment and\nPoverty Reduction\nEffects\nLost Economic Negative\nEnergy Losses & Power Outages &\nTrading Environmental\nHigh Operation Cost Unserved Energy\nOppurtunities Impact\nSuboptimal\nCore Problem Regional Power\nSystem Operation\n& Trade\nCauses\nPolicy, Legal and Regional Transmission Payment/\nRegulatory Coordination and System Technical Pricing Problems Settlement\nConstraints Institutional Problems Problems\nProblems\nSelf Sufficiency Lack of Independence Obsolete and Old Noneconomic Currency Exchange\nPolicies of UDC Equipment Pricing of Fuels Problems\nEnergy Water Nexus Financial Mgt.

Tajikistan \n \n1.  In 1998 the Government of  Tajikistan issued an  energy sector policy statement that \nenvisaged energy sector reform in terms of increasing private sector participation, improving \ncorporate governance of energy enterprises, and allowing cost-based tariffs. Subsequently, an \nenergy sector action plan was formulated with assistance from ADB and is presently under \nimplementation. It provided for an Energy Law and the establishment of a Ministry of Energy. \nThe Law on Energy Sector was passed in October 2000, and the Ministry of Energy  was \nestablished in December of the same year. Implementing regulations for the Energy Law are \npresently being prepared. The setting up of an Anti-Monopoly Committee with powers for tariff \nsetting  and  licensing,  is  envisaged. Tariff reform to achieve cost recovery levels is being \nimplemented. Barki Tajik, a state-owned enterprise, is responsible for running the power sector \noperations  and  the  Ministry  of  Energy  is  responsible  for  policy.  Plans to unbundle and \ncommercialize Barki Tajik provide that the 12 regional electricity joint-stock companies are to be \naggregated into two to four enterprises. The current organization makes no distinction between \ntransmission and distribution. There are no plans to privatize existing generation stations, which \nwill remain bundled with transmission. \n \nB.  Uzbekistan \n \n2.  In Uzbekistan, Decree No. UP-2812, of 22 February, 2001, creates a Uzbekenergo \nsubsidiary enterprise, UzelectroSet for high-voltage transmission. There are also provisions for \nfuture unbundling of combined heat and power companies and regional electricity distribution \ncompanies. The Decree also provides for Uzbekenergo to retain controlling blocks of shares in \nall power generation, transmission, and distribution joint-stock companies that may be set up in \nthe future. Plans for future industry structure call for the gradual corporatization of the thermal \npower plants and regional distribution networks. Up to 49% of the capital of the corporate \nentities will be offered to investors; 75% of the shares of enterprises involved in design, civil \nworks, and maintenance formerly under the Ministry will be sold, the assets and operating \nresponsibility of the  heat-only plants will be transferred to local governments, and the social \ninfrastructure  facilities  of  Uzbekenergo  to  be  privatized  will  be  listed.  Components  of  the \nelectricity system that will remain state owned include all the hydropower plants, the energy \nnetwork communications system, the transmission grid (UzelectroSet) and UzEnergoSbyt, an \naffiliated company of Uzbekenergo that will handle commercial transactions between generation \nand distribution as well as export sales on a nonprofit basis. Implementation began on 1 July \n2001 with the objective of achieving partial privatization by 2005 for generation and  2003 for \ndistribution. The aim is to develop a market for electricity along the lines of that in Kazakhstan.  \n ", "46           Appendix 13 \nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PROJECTIONS \nA.  Barki Tajik \n \n1.

Least-Cost Analysis \n1.  There is no technical alternative to the rehabilitation of the high-voltage transmission \nsubstations because the further deterioration of substation equipment would increasingly make \nthe transmission system unreliable to deliver electricity from the major generating plants to \nregional and domestic customers. The automation of dispatch control and metering is also a \nmandatory  requirement  for  the  optimal  operation  of  the  regional  and  the  domestic  power \nsystems and for economic regional trade. \n \nB.  Project Viability Analysis \n2.  The  viability  analysis  has  been  undertaken  on  a  conservative  basis  in  terms  of \nimprovements in system reliability and optimized operation. The analysis does not include the \nbenefits of power trade. \n \n1.  Financial Internal Rate of Return \n3.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  has  been  estimated  for  the  project \ncomponents from the perspective of the electric utilities in each country on the basis of the \nfollowing assumptions. \nTable A15.1: Assumptions \n \nAssumption  Tajikistan  Uzbekistan \nAverage life  15 years for dispatch and 25 years  15 years for dispatch and 25 years \nfor substations  for substations \nEstimated total cost (2002 base price  $23.6 million  $125.1 million \nplus physical contingencies) \nSavings in communication expenses  $0.17 million/year  $0.50 million/year \nOperation and maintenance cost  0.5% saving.  0.5% saving. \nsavings due to optimal dispatch \nFuel cost savings due to optimal  1% saving assumed increasing by  1% saving assumed increasing by \ndispatch and use of thermal and  2.5% per year with generation  2.5% per year with generation \nhydropower plants and lower  growth.

The  analysis  is  presented  in  Tables  A15.2b  and  A15.3b.  Based  on  the  above \nassumptions, the FIRR for the Project for Tajikistan and Uzbekistan is estimated at 7.0% and \n11.3%, respectively. The Project\u2019s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is difficult to \nestimate, given the current variable economic conditions prevailing in both countries and the \nlack of an indicative set of interest rates and rates of return at present. However, using the \nexpected US dollar interest rate for ADB's LIBOR-based loans of 3.9% as a proxy for the \nWACC,1 the Project components should be financially viable.  \n \n2.  Economic Internal Rate of Return \n5.  The viability of the Project was analyzed from a broader national perspective in terms of \nits economic internal rate of return (EIRR). The financial costs were adjusted to reflect the true \neconomic opportunities forgone and realized on account of the Project. The economic analysis \nwas based on the following additional assumptions:   \n \n(i)  a standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.90 for Tajikistan and 0.70 for Uzbekistan; \n(ii)  fuel cost savings due to optimal dispatch valued at gas border price of $43 per \n1000m3; \n(iii)  transmission loss reduction valued on the basis of estimated weighted average \nwillingness to pay for electricity of $0.050 per kWh and $0.045 per kWh for \nTajikistan and Uzbekistan, respectively;2 and \n(iv)  energy not served savings valued at $0.20 per kWh3; the long run marginal cost \nof generation added. \n6.  The analysis is presented in Tables A15.2c and A15.3c. From the above assumptions, \nthe EIRR for the Project for Tajikistan and Uzbekistan is estimated at 30.0% and 24.2%, \nrespectively. These figures are higher than the ADB\u2019s generally accepted cutoff point of 12%. \n  \n3.  Regional Benefits \n7.  The  foregoing  viability  analysis  considered  the  project  benefits  for  each  country \nexcluding  the  benefits  of  increased  trade. The additional benefits of enhanced trade were \nestimated on the basis that agreement is reached for Uzbekistan to import all the surplus \nsummer energy available from the Nurek power station in Tajikistan, on average 1,000 GWh per \nyear. Instead of spilling and wasting this water, as is the case at present, the net economic \nbenefit that could be shared by both countries is $12 million estimated at 1.2 cents/kWh. The \nbenefit is calculated as avoided generation costs (fuel and variable cost) to Uzbekistan of 1.9 \ncents/kWh less transmission cost of 0.5 cents/kWh and the negligible Tajik generation cost of \n0.2 cents/kWh. The share of the benefit will be based on the price agreed. If these expected \nregional benefits are realized the financial and economic viability of both the Tajik and Uzbek \ncomponents of the Project will be substantially enhanced. \n \n \n                                                 \n1  This interest rate is applicable for the relending to Barki Tajik and Uzbekenergo and would also be a proxy for the \nequity cost of capital on an opportunity cost basis (i.e., the saving if the utilities repaid the current debt). \n2  Based on (i) an upper bound of $0.13 per kWh for diesel generation and $0.24 per kWh for kerosene lighting; (ii) a \nlower bound of present average tariffs, for Tajikistan of $0.005 per kWh and $0.012 per kWh for residential and \nindustry, respectively, and for Uzbekistan of $0.01 per kWh and $0.01 per kWh for residential and industry, \nrespectively; (iii) present demand for Tajikistan of 35% and 65% for residential and industry, respectively, and for \nUzbekistan of 16% and 84% for residential and industry, respectively; and (iv) a 0.25 curvature correction factor. \n3  The feasibility report quotes a range of $0.40 to $5.0 per kWh of energy not served in other countries; $0.20 per \nkWh was considered reasonable for Central Asia and would roughly equate with the cost of autogeneration based \non a 10% utilization factor.

The  Project  covers  Tajikistan  and  Uzbekistan  and  is  classified  as  environmental \ncategory B. The summary initial environmental examination (SIEE) has been prepared based on \nthe findings of the feasibility study consultants. \nB.  Background and Description of the Project \n2.  The  Central  Asia  power  system  comprises  interconnected  high-voltage  links \nencompassing  southern  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan,  and \nUzbekistan. The main transmission lines link the power systems of the five countries for parallel \noperation.  The  system  shares  common  operational  and  service  management,  planning, \ninformation channels and control, and connects 83 power plants, including 29 thermal and 48 \nhydropower plants, with a total installed capacity of about 25,000 megawatts. The unified \ndispatch center in Tashkent is responsible for maintaining the balanced and synchronized \noperation of the power transmission and distribution systems of the five countries. Following the \ndissolution  of  the  Soviet  Union  in  1991,  the  countries  maintained  their  balanced  and \nsynchronized operation to allow import and export of electricity among them. Market-oriented \nissues increasingly play a major role in power system management. However, the regional \ntechnical operation protocols are less respected and funds for maintenance and rehabilitation \nare  scarce.  Each  country  has  been  focusing  more  on  power  self-sufficiency rather than \nestablishing a competitive regional market that would achieve economically efficient patterns of \ntrade. \n3.  The  objective  is  to  improve  the  operation  and  efficiency  of  the  regional  power \ntransmission system and enhance economic power trade among the Central Asian republics. \nThe Project  will rehabilitate the 500-kilovolt (kV) substations to improve system reliability, \nupgrade dispatch and communications facilities to optimize system operation, and install new \ntransborder metering to better measure traded power. Under the Project the focus will be on \nmodernizing the transmission systems of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. \n4.  In  Tajikistan,  the  components  are:  (i) the  rehabilitation  of  the  high-voltage  Regar \nsubstation, and (ii) the rehabilitation of the national dispatch center including the installation of \nnew communications links between the main substations. In Uzbekistan, the components are: \n(i) the rehabilitation of high voltage substations of Tashkent, Tashkent TPS, Lochin, Novo \nAngren, Karakul, Syr Darya, Guzar and Sukhan; (ii) the rehabilitation of the national and area \ndispatch centers including the installation of new communications links between the main \nsubstations; and (iii) the rehabilitation of the unified dispatch center in Tashkent.  \nC.  Description of the Environment \n5.   Tajikistan is characterized by a strongly continental climate with hot, dry summers and \ncold winters, especially in mountainous areas. Daily temperature fluctuations are usually quite \nlarge. The cold winters make heating a necessary for winter months  in the whole country. \nApproximately 97% of the country is mountainous, and almost half of it peaks at altitudes of \nmore than 3,000 meters above sea level. The few flat areas available are intensively used for \nagriculture,  which  is  carried  out  almost  exclusively  under  irrigation.  For  this  reason,  the \nconsiderable water resources of the country, stemming from the high mountain areas, are \nimportant for power generation as well as for irrigation.  ", "Appendix  17           61 \n6.   Uzbekistan is characterized by a strongly continental climate with hot, dry summers and \ncold winters, mostly flat-to-rolling sandy desert with dunes; broad, flat intensely irrigated river \nvalleys along the course of the Amu Darya, Syr Darya, and Zarafshon; the Fergana Valley in the \neast surrounded by mountainous Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan; and the shrinking Aral Sea in the \nwest. About 40,000 square kilometers (sq km) of flat areas are intensively used for agriculture, \nwhich is undertaken almost exclusively under irrigation. \nD.  Environmental Problems due to the Project Location \n7.  The Project will be conducted at the existing switchyards/substation sites and at dispatch \ncenters. All substations and switchgears in which rehabilitation measures are foreseen are in \nthe ownership of the power utilities in each country, namely Barki Tajik and Uzbekenergo. There \nwill be no new installations and no need for land acquisition. \n8.  In Tajikistan optic fiber cables will be installed on the Regar-Novaya-Djangal-Yavan- \nBapazin-Lolazor-Sebiston-Nurek  220 kV  transmission  line,  in  substitution  of  the  existing \nearthwire. The transmission line partly crosses mountainous areas, mainly near Nurek and the \nVarkhsh valley, where crops and households are scarce. The transmission line near Regar \ncrosses a flat area where intensive agriculture is undertaken.  \n9.  In Uzbekistan optic fiber cables will be installed on the Lochin-Uzbekistanskaya-Angren -\nTashkent 220 kV transmission line and on the Karakul-Navoiy-Syrdarinskaya-Taskent 220 kV \ntransmission lines in substitution of the existing earthwires. A total of 1,107 km of cable have to \nbe installed under the project. The transmission lines partly cross desert areas, where crops and \nhouseholds are scarce. The transmission lines near the Fergana Valley and around Tashkent \ncross intensive agriculture areas. Some archeological sites are located in the vicinity of the \ntransmission lines, namely near Bukhara and Samarkand. \nE.  Potential Environmental Impacts \n1.  Construction \n10.  Impacts during construction will be limited apart from normal environmental impacts \nassociated with construction activities such as noise, dust, and waste disposal. During the \nstringing of the new optical ground wire, access of trucks, equipments have to be allowed all \nover the route of the transmission line, i.e., over 1,000 km in Uzbekistan and about 300 km in \nTajikistan.  Special  arrangements  have  to  be  made  in  order  to  minimize  the  impacts  on \nagriculture, such as seasonal implementation schedule, crops compensation mechanisms, and \nstringing under tension. Some impacts cannot, however, be fully avoided such as temporary \naccess roads and trimming. Special care will be taken into consideration at the end of the works \nto mitigate the environmental impacts, such as land slide and land erosion that can appear after \nthese temporary works. The following generated waste volumes are estimated for Tajikistan: \n(i) 6 tons of aluminum and (ii) 130 tons of steel. Estimated waste volumes in Uzbekistan are: \n(i) 20 tons of aluminum and (ii) 450 tons of steel. These wastes can be readily sold for recycling. \n11.  For substation works in Tajikistan, the following waste volumes will likely be generated: \n(i) 25 tons of ceramic insulators, (ii) 4 tons of insulation oil, (iii) 5 tons of copper, and (iv) 1 ton of \nsteel. In Uzbekistan the waste volumes are expected to be: (i) 600 tons of ceramic insulators, \n(ii) 90 tons of insulation oil, (iii) 120 tons of copper, and (iv) 20 tons of steel. Additional chemical \nproducts  such  as  lead,  acid,  and  electrochemical  condensers  will  be  disposed  from  the \nrehabilitation  of  control  and  protection  system  as  well  as  from  the  direct  current  system, ", "62           Appendix 17 \nespecially from the batteries. The ceramic wastes will be disposed of in landfills. The insulation \noil will be cleaned and filtered, and partly reused or sold as fuel oil. Lead will be sold. Acid and \nother chemical components (bakelite, electrochemical condensers) will be properly conditioned \nand sent to specialized laboratories. \n2.   Operation \n12.  From an operational point of view, there will be no change from the present operation in \nterms of electric or magnetic fields due to the proposed rehabilitation works at the substations \nsites and in their vicinity, as the substations already exist. \n13.  It will be the same for the transmission lines, as they already exist and the operation of \noptical ground wires for telecommunications will not present any problem for the environment, \nas this kind of technology does not create any kind of emissions. Moreover, the optic ground \nwires will reinforce the grounding of the tower and will then, as a positive impact, reduce the \nstep voltage during storms and lightning. \n14.  The new power line carrier at substations will not create any radio interference as long \nas the same frequency band as now is reused. Attention must be paid to this point during the \ndetail design study. The installation of hardware and software in the dispatching will not create \nany adverse impact on the environment. \nF.  Mitigation Measures \n15.  The most important environmental mitigation measure in relation to the Project will be \nproper  disposal  of  discarded  material,  especially  transformer  oil  and  lead-acid  batteries. \nContractors and executing agencies (EAs) will be required to filter, sell, or reuse the remaining \ntransformer oil as fuel oil. For other products, the EAs will take appropriate measures for the \nrecycling of the discarded materials. Other material, which cannot be recycled, will be deposited \nin controlled deposit sites. The EAs will, with the help of the consultants, prepare and implement \nan environmental monitoring plan. \n16.  During construction at any site, care will have to be taken to prevent contamination of \nsoil and water with fuel and lubricants. Proper storage in plastic tanks and other preventive \nmeasures will have to be included in the contractor bid document and contract document. The \nEA will assure periodic site monitoring and supervision to ensure compliance. \n17.  During the transmission line works, the damage to the crops much be reduced as much \nas possible. This can be achieved through a seasonal implementation schedule, i.e., during a \nlow period of agricultural activities, after the harvest. Where it will not be avoidable, the EA will \nset up and implement crops compensation mechanisms.  \n18.  Temporary access roads will have to be limited to a minimum, and special techniques \nsuch  as  tensioning  stringing  will  be  implemented  to  the  maximum  extent.  This  particular \ntechnique will have to be implemented near any archeological sites and other sensitive areas.  \n19.  At the end of the construction period, the contractor will be asked to remove all wastes \nand to recondition the parts that have deteriorated during the construction phase.  ", "Appendix  17           63 \nG.  Findings and Recommendations \n20.  The Project will improve power supply in the region and will enhance the exchange of \nenergy. Adverse impacts of the project will be very small, and will be limited to the construction \nperiod.  The most important measures to be taken consist of proper disposal of discarded \nmaterials. Adverse impacts can be easily mitigated through good engineering and construction \npractices. No negative impact will persist during the operation phase. The Project will not \ninvolve resettlement or land acquisition. Since all identified adverse environmental impacts are \nminor and can be mitigated, a detailed environmental impact assessment is not required for the \nProject.
