THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof  up  to  $65  million  to  Mira  Power  Limited  (MPL)  for  the  Gulpur  Hydropower  Project  in \nPakistan.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT  \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  Acute  energy  deficits  have  been  one  of  the  major  constraints  and  bottlenecks  to \neconomic growth in Pakistan. To ensure a sustainable supply of energy, the Government of \nPakistan has launched a number of initiatives for promoting private sector participation in the \ncountry\u2019s infrastructure, with a major focus on the energy sector. As part of these efforts, a \nnumber of energy policies were introduced and have resulted in significant (albeit insufficient) \ninvestment from the private sector. As of FY2013, 11,681 megawatts (MW) or 49.4% of the \ncountry\u2019s installed power capacity was owned and operated by private sector investors.2 The \nproject is one of the earlier hydropower projects identified under the Power Policy (2002) by the \nPrivate Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB)\u2014the national institution entrusted with bringing \nprivate investment into Pakistan\u2019s energy sector. The project\u2019s detailed feasibility study was \napproved by the PPIB in April 2006. \n \n3.  KOSEP approached ADB in early 2012 for financing given (i) ADB\u2019s record in supporting \nthe  country\u2019s first two  hydro  independent  power  producers (IPPs)  in Pakistan\u2014New  Bong \nEscape Hydropower and Patrind Hydropower,3 (ii) the relatively large project debt requirement, \nand (iii) local banks\u2019 current reluctance to provide long-term limited recourse project finance \n(caused by asset\u2013liability mismatch concerns). \n \n2.  Project Design \n4.  The  project  involves  the  construction  and  operation  of  a  102  MW  run-of-river \nhydroelectric power generation facility on the Poonch River, 28 kilometers upstream of the \nMangla reservoir, country\u2019s second largest storage reservoir. The project will be developed \nunder the Power Policy (2002) and will be undertaken on a build\u2013own\u2013operate\u2013transfer basis \nfor 30 years from the commercial operations date. Keeping in view the hydrology data (and \nvariation therein) for Poonch River, the average annual energy generation will be 465 Gwh, and \nelectricity  will  be  evacuated  through  the  existing  Kotli\u2013Dhudial  132-kilovolt  single-circuit \ntransmission line passing over the project site. \n \n3.  The Borrower and Sponsors \n5.  MPL, the borrower, is a special purpose vehicle that has the right to develop the project. \nMPL is owned by KOSEP (76%), Daelim (18%), and Lotte (6%). MPL\u2019s chief executive officer is \ndeputed from KOSEP and is responsible for the day-to-day affairs of MPL under the supervision \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  National Electric Power Regulatory Authority. 2014.

The chief executive officer is supported \nby professionals in project development, engineering, finance, and regulatory affairs. \n \n \nB.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n1.  Impacts \n6.  The successful development of the project will contribute to (i) improved power supply in \nPakistan, (ii) a diversified power generation mix, and (iii) increased investments by the private \nsector in renewable energy projects in Pakistan. The project will help alleviate Pakistan\u2019s severe \npower shortage, which hampers the country\u2019s economic growth and efforts to reduce poverty. \nSuccessful implementation of the project will also foster confidence among potential investors \nand lenders, and promote further private sector investment in renewable energy and power. \n \n2.  Outcome  \n7.  The  outcome  of  the  project  will  be  increased  supply  of  cleaner  hydropower  from \nindigenous  energy  sources.  The  project  will  generate  an  additional  465  gigawatt-hours  of \nelectricity annually by using indigenous water resources, and the tariff for electricity supplied by \nthe project will be lower than that for plants that use imported fuel and other renewable energy \nsources such as wind and solar energy. The project will also avoid greenhouse gas emissions \nof about 253,797 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year.  \n \n3.   Outputs \n8.  The outputs of the project will be the net additional installed power generation capacity \nof 102 MW, which is equivalent to about 1.8% of the power shortfall in the country.  \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n9.  The project is consistent with the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 with its focus on \ninclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, private sector development and \noperations, environment and climate change, and infrastructure development.4 ADB\u2019s support \nfor the project is in line with the country partnership strategy for Pakistan, 2009\u20132013, which \nemphasizes  energy  sector  development,  private  sector  participation  in  infrastructure \ndevelopment, and expansion of ADB\u2019s private sector operations in the energy sector.5 The \nproject is a logical outcome of ADB\u2019s development and reform efforts in Pakistan\u2019s energy \nsector, which have been designed to promote a well-regulated, market-oriented power industry, \nparticularly  when  the  country  faces  challenges  in  attracting  commercial  financing.  Energy \ninfrastructure has featured prominently in ADB\u2019s private sector operations in Pakistan. \n \n2.  Consistency with Sector Strategy \n10.  The project is in line with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, particularly with one of its three pillars\u2014\nmaximizing  access  to energy  for  all.6 The  project  will  add  power  generation  capacity  and \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2014.

Energy Policy. Manila. \n ", "3 \n \nincrease the reliability of electricity supplies in a country facing a severe power shortage. The \nelectricity tariff for the project will be significantly lower than the average price of power in the \ncountry, and will not be affected by the volatility of the international fuel market, which impacts \nmuch of the existing thermal power generation capacity in the country. The project will promote \nthe use of indigenous and renewable resources, and will contribute to the country\u2019s energy \nsecurity. The project will help ADB meet its commitment to undertake clean energy investments \nof at least $2 billion per year. \n \n3.  Lessons from Previous Operations \n11.  ADB has taken the lead in supporting the government\u2019s initiatives to attract private \ncapital into the energy (especially renewable energy) sector; and has been instrumental in \npioneering many transactions, keeping in view local banks\u2019 long-term lending constraints and \ntheir reluctance to finance renewable energy initiatives. ADB financed the first  two private \nhydropower projects in Pakistan: the 84 MW New Bong Escape and the 147 MW Patrind \nhydropower projects (footnote 3). ADB also financed Pakistan\u2019s first three private wind power \nprojects: Zorlu Enerji (56 MW) and Foundation Wind Energy I (50 MW) and II (50 MW). 7 ADB\u2019s \nparticipation in these projects not only provided much-needed long-term debt (which is crucial \nfor infrastructure development), but also acted as a catalyst to raise foreign and local financing. \nThe project also fully compliments ADB sovereign operation\u2019s support for energy sector reforms \nthat target fuel mix diversification in the power sector through renewable energy resources.8 \n \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan \n12.  The project is estimated to cost $367.4 million, including contingencies.

THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n13.  ADB\u2019s proposed assistance comprises a direct loan of up to $65 million from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources.  \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance  \n14.  ADB  funding  is  needed  for  this  critical  energy  asset  as  long-term  limited  recourse \nfinancing is not readily available in Pakistan\u2019s market. International commercial banks are not \nactive in Pakistan (infact most have left the market altogether; others are scaling down their \npresence) and local banks have severe lending constraints. ADB has a strong presence through \nits public and private sector operations in the country; International Monetary Fund regularly \nconsults with ADB on country\u2019s energy related reforms. As the project involves multiple layers of \ngovernment  entities,  ADB\u2019s  presence  helps  reassure  the  international  sponsors  that  the \ngovernment entities will continue to support the project  in the long term. Lastly, ADB has \ninvested considerable resources in the project to ensure compliance with high environment and \nsocial safeguard standards and to mitigate climate-related risks, which are described in detail in \nparas 16-20.  \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions   \n15.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified \ncategory A for environment and involuntary resettlement, and category C for indigenous peoples. \nThe potential environmental and social impacts of the project have been identified; and effective \nmeasures  to  avoid,  minimize,  mitigate,  and  compensate  for  the  adverse  impacts  are \nincorporated in the safeguard reports and plans. The institutional capacity and commitment of \nMPL to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental risks are deemed adequate. \n \n16.  Environment. The current dam site was selected to minimize environmental and social \nadverse impacts on the area. A 66-meter high concrete gravity dam will be constructed to divert \nwater from 700 meters of the river section, which will create a 292-hectare reservoir. The \n ", "5 \n \nconstruction will take 55 months to complete and will excavate 1 million cubic meters of soil and \nrock to meet the requirement of rock-fill at cofferdams and stone pitching. However, the bulk of \nthe excavated material will be deposited in the spoil tip area at the project site. The project is \nlocated in a critical habitat of two endangered fish species of conservation importance in the \naffected rivers: Mahseer Tor putitora and Glyptothorax kashmirensis Catfish. Both species are \nlisted as endangered and critically endangered in the International Union for Conservation of \nNature Red List. The local fisheries and wildlife department will formalize its commitment to \nestablish the national park management plan (NPMP) by signing a cooperation agreement with \nMPL to provide technical and financial support. The plan includes zoning for river sections \nthrough  consultations  with  local  communities  and  stakeholders  to  provide  solutions  that \ncombine environmental protection and economic development to ensure the sustainability of the \ncritical habitat. It is highly likely that the NPMP would not be developed without MPL\u2019s support \nbecause of the financial constraints of local authorities. \n \n17.  One of the key components of the NPMP is the biodiversity action plan (BAP), which has \nbeen developed to meet ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements for projects in critical habitat. The BAP \nwill ensure that Mahseer species living in upstream of the dam are able to migrate to breed at \nspawning grounds in upstream tributaries. Commercial hatcheries will seed fish downstream of \nthe dam, as migration will not be possible from downstream. The Catfish will continue to spawn \nacross the river. Therefore, there will not be measurable adverse impacts on the river\u2019s high \nbiodiversity value if present aquatic environmental conditions are preserved outside the project \nfootprint. The BAP will avoid further reduction in population of these two species and will \naddress any residual adverse environmental impact associated with the project. Moreover, \nNPMP will regulate future infrastructure development activities in the Poonch River through \nzoning  to  ensure  environmental  sustainability  of  the  critical  habitat.  Climate  change  risk \nassessment recommends continuous river flow measurement to ensure safe dam operations, \nas well as periodical monitoring of precipitation within the catchment area. \n \n18.  Social safeguards. The project will affect 277 households, of which 166 households \n(including  four  households  requiring  physical  relocation)  will  lose  10%  or  more  of  their \nproductive assets and the remaining 111 households will lose less than 10% of their assets. A \nland acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) was prepared to address these impacts. Key \nmeasures include payment of cash compensation based on negotiated rates (which are higher \nthan  the  prevailing  market  value)  plus  a  15%  compulsory  acquisition  surcharge,  and \nimplementation  of  livelihood  programs  in  consultation  with  affected  people.  Information \ndisclosure and consultations with affected people were conducted in accordance with ADB \nrequirements. People affected by land acquisition have also been notified in accordance with \nthe Land Acquisition Act, 1897, and Land Acquisition Rules (1994). Key information from the \nLARP such as eligibility, entitlements, and the schedule of LARP implementation was disclosed \nduring  consultations  in  April  2014.  External  monitoring  arrangements  and  grievance \nmechanisms are in place. No official census has been carried out to ascertain the ethnicity of \npeople in Kotli district but estimates suggest that major tribes in the project area are Awan, Syed, \nGujar, Jat, Rajput, and Sudhan. These tribes do not meet the criteria set in the Safeguard Policy \nStatement to be considered as indigenous peoples and no impact on them by the project is \nexpected. \n \n19.  Other social dimensions. MPL will comply with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy10 and \nreport regularly to ADB on its compliance (including contractors) with national labor laws and \nadherence to internationally recognized core labor standards.   MPL will implement the gender \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2003. Social Protection. Manila (adopted in 2001). \n ", "6 \n     \nmeasures to ensure women from affected households have access to project benefits, including \nregular consultation and training of women and engagement of a female community welfare \nofficer. Specific activities and targets for women from the larger community will be set once \nMPL\u2019s corporate social responsibility program is designed. In the absence of such targets, the \nproject is classified as having no gender elements. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n20.  MPL and the sponsors were advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international \npractice relating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism.11 \nADB will ensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting \ncorruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event \nof noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n21.  The proposed loan is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and single-\nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n22.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank, no funding \nwill be disbursed until ADB is satisfied that the principles enumerated under Article 14 have \nbeen  met.  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  finance  documentation,  in  form  and  substance \nsatisfactory  to  ADB,  following  approval  of  the  proposed  assistance  by  the  ADB  Board  of \nDirectors.12 \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n23.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of up to \n$65,000,000 to Mira Power Limited for the Gulpur Hydropower Project in Pakistan from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources, with such terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \nApril 2015 \n \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2003.
