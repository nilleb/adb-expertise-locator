The  project  will  reduce  the  cost  of  power  supply \ngeneration by replacing diesel power with hydropower, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It \nis  estimated  that,  following  the  project,  hydropower  will  generate  68%  of  Honiara\u2019s  electricity. \nTransaction technical assistance was used in project preparation.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nSolomon  Islands  has  the  fourth-largest  economy  among  ADB\u2019s  15  Pacific  developing \nmember countries, with a gross domestic product of just over $1 billion in 2016. However, annual \nper capita income is less than $1,800. Having withstood the impacts of the global financial and \neconomic crises, the economy grew by an average of 6.6% in 2008\u20132011, driven by expansions \nin logging output and mineral extraction. Growth has since dropped to an average of just 2.6%, \nand is expected to remain low in the near term. The country\u2019s longer term prospects depend on \nthe  development  of  more  sustainable  drivers  of  growth,  including  tourism  and  commercial \nservices. This will need to be underpinned by a stable and reliable energy supply. \n \nHigh tariffs from over-reliance on diesel power generation. Grid-connected electricity \n4. \nin Solomon Islands is generated and supplied by Solomon Power, a state-owned electricity utility \ncompany. Solomon Power provides electricity to the capital Honiara and eight isolated provincial \ncenters on separate islands.3 Solomon Islands has a total population of 616,000, more than 10% \nof whom live in Honiara.4 Honiara has an installed electricity generation capacity of 34 megawatts \n(MW). Peak load on the Honiara grid is growing, having increased from 9.3 MW in 2003 to 15.8 \nMW in 2018. Solomon Power\u2019s electricity supply relies almost entirely on diesel generation. The \ncost to Solomon Power of generating power from diesel decreased from $0.36 per kilowatt-hour \n(kWh) in 2014 to $0.26/kWh in 2018, mainly due to a decline in diesel prices. Similarly, retail tariffs \npaid by the consumer fell from $0.93/kWh in 2014 to $0.65/kWh in 2016, due in part to declining \ndiesel  prices  and  tariff  reform.5 The  high  cost  of  electricity  generation  is  negatively  impacting \neconomic growth, particularly in the commercial and tourism sectors. \n \n5. \nLow  access.  Electricity  access  in  Solomon  Islands  is  low.  Approximately  9%  of  the \ncountry\u2019s  population  have  access  to  grid-connected  electricity,  and  another  2%  rely  on  self-\ngenerated power. The access rate is 64% in urban Honiara, and 3% in rural areas. About one-\nthird of all households have small solar home systems. To improve access rates, Solomon Power \nis (i) extending the grid within Honiara, with financing support from the World Bank;6 (ii) converting \n\n                                                \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 ADB. 2016. Technical Assistance to Solomon Islands for Tina River Hydropower Project. Manila (TA 9305-SOL).  \n3 The current tariff setting mechanism allows Solomon Power to operate at full cost recovery without subsidies.  \n4 Government  of  Solomon  Islands,  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Treasury.  2015.  Solomon  Islands  2012/13  Household \n\nIncome and Expenditure Survey National Analytical Report. Volume 1. Honiara. \n\n5 In 2016, the World Bank funded the development of a new tariff regulation that came into effect in January 2017.  \n6 Solomon Islands Sustainable Energy Project. The increased power supply from the Tina River Hydropower Plant will \n\nexpand residential access to the Honiara grid in the medium term.  \n\n \n\n\fprovincial grids to renewable energy with support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB);7 and \n(iii) establishing renewable energy mini-grids in larger villages, partially supported by the World \nBank and Government of New Zealand. \n \nLeast-cost  development  and  tariff  reduction.  Solomon  Power\u2019s  least-cost  power \n6. \nexpansion plan recommends the construction of the Tina River Hydropower Plant supported by \nthe  expansion  of  solar  power  generation. 8  This  will  drive  tariffs  down  by  replacing  diesel \ngeneration  with  least-cost  renewable  energy.  Tariff  reductions  will  boost  Honiara\u2019s  economic \ndevelopment and lower power costs for households. The plan estimates that, with the construction \nof  the  plant,  retail  tariffs  paid  by  consumers  will  decline  to  $0.33/kWh  by  2023,  compared  to \n$0.51/kWh without the project. The plant will also provide suitable baseload power to facilitate the \nincreased penetration of intermittent solar power in the Honiara grid. With the commissioning of \nthe plant and proposed solar investments, the extent of renewable energy integration is expected \nto grow from 1% in 2016 to 85% in 2022 (68% from the plant and 17% from solar). The reduced \nuse of diesel will significantly reduce Solomon Islands\u2019 greenhouse gas emissions.   \n \nPublic\u2013private  partnership.  The  project  has  been  developed  under  a  public\u2013private \n7. \npartnership.9 A special project company (SPC) will be established to design, build, own, operate, \nand manage the plant. The SPC will undertake the construction of the hydropower facility through \na build\u2013operate\u2013own\u2013transfer scheme, and it will be capitalized with equity investment from the \nconsortium  of  the  Korea  Water  Resources  Corporation  (K-Water)  and  Hyundai  Engineering \nCorporation Limited (HEC). The SPC will enter into a 34-year power purchase agreement (PPA) \nwith state-owned Solomon Power, which will purchase power on a net availability basis under a \n34-year  implementation  agreement  with  the  government.  Through  the  government  guarantee \nagreement (GGA), the government will guarantee Solomon Power\u2019s payment obligations to the \nSPC. To maintain the project\u2019s financial viability and lower the tariff, the government is securing \nconcessional financing from multilateral and bilateral development partners that will be onlent to \nthe SPC.10  \n \n8. \nProject readiness. The project\u2019s technical design is complete and has been reviewed by \nan  independent  panel  of  technical  experts.  Extensive  topographic,  geotechnical,  geological, \nenvironmental, social, and hydrological site surveys have been undertaken. The land required for \nthe project was under customary ownership, and the clear land title has been secured following \nconsiderable consultation and negotiation. The PPA was signed on 6 December 2018 and will \nbecome  effective  once  conditions  precedent  are  met.11 Financial  close  is  currently  targeting  5 \nDecember 2019. \n \n9. \nAlignment with  development  plans.  The  project  supports  the  operational  priorities  of \nADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  by  (i)  addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities;  (ii)  \naccelerating progress in gender equality; and (iii) tackling climate change, building climate and \ndisaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability.12\n It will contribute to Sustainable \n                                                \n7 ADB. 2016.

Funding  from  Abu  Dhabi \nDevelopment Fund, ADB, Export-Import Bank of Korea and World Bank (including administered \nfunds) will be provided directly to the government as parallel financing.17 ADB will not administer \nany  cofinancing.  The  government  will  finance  the  remainder  of  the  total  project  cost  ($17.07 \nmillion), for the construction of transmission lines. K-Water and HEC will provide equity of $10.80 \nmillion, and will enter into the GGA, whereby the government will guarantee payment obligations \nunder the PPA between the SPC and Solomon Power.18 \n \n14. \nConcessional  loan financing from  various sources will  be  onlent  to the SPC,  through  a \nsubsidiary  lending  agreement,  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  provided  by  the  various \nfinanciers to the government, with a 0.1% add-on to the onlending rate.

ADB has agreed with this approach.   \n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fImplementation Arrangements \n\nE. \n \n15. \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  and Treasury  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  the  Ministry  of \nMines,  Energy,  and  Rural  Electrification  will  be  the  implementing  agency 19.  The  Tina  River \nHydropower Project Office (TRHPO) has been established under the Ministry of Mines, Energy, \nand Rural Electrification since 2010. The TRHPO will act as the project management unit. Funding \nsupport for the TRHPO has been provided to date through the Government of Australia and World \nBank, who have allocated a further $7 million grant to support it.20 ADB has reviewed the proposed \nsupport and considers it adequate to supervise and monitor project implementation. No additional \nADB support for the TRHPO is proposed at this stage. A project steering committee has been \nestablished  to  review  project  progress,  coordinate  inter-ministerial  activities,  and  guide  the \nTRHPO.  Co-financiers  will  develop  a  memorandum  of  understanding  setting  out  coordination \nrequirements. A coordination mechanism will be established for reporting and sharing information \nbetween the government and development partner financiers. The implementation arrangements \nare summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM.21 ADB will be jointly financing the \nEPC  contract  with  cofinancing  sources.  As  a  result,  universal  procurement  will  apply  to  the \ncontract.22 \n \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects  \nImplementation period \nEstimated loan closing date \nManagement \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n\nArrangements \nDecember 2019\u2013June 2025 \n31 December 2025 \n\nTina River Hydropower Steering Committee (chair)  \nMOFT, MMERE, MID, and MECDM (members) \nMOFT \n\n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  MMERE \n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nDisbursement \n\nTRHPO and SPC \nThe loan and grant proceeds will be disbursed following ADB's \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to \ntime) and detailed arrangements agreed between the Government \nof Solomon Islands and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank; MMERE = Ministry of Mines, Energy, and Rural Electrification; MOFT = Ministry \nof Finance and Treasury; SPC = Special Purpose Company; TRHPO = Tina River Hydropower Project Office. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n16. \nImplementation agreement and power purchase agreement. The SPC will enter into \nan  implementation  agreement  with  the government specifying  the rights and obligations of  the \nparties.  The  SPC  has  entered  into  a  PPA  with  Solomon  Power  covering  a  34-year  period \n(including a 5-year construction period). At the end of the implementation agreement and PPA (in \n\n                                                \n19 ADB  Office  of  Public  Private  Partnerships  is  providing  capacity  support  to  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Treasury  to \n\nmanage co-financier fund flows and finalize conditions precedent.  \n\n20 Support  will  include  consultants  to  (i)  monitor  overall  project  implementation;  (ii)  provide  capacity  building  and \nawareness training for various stakeholders; (iii) monitor environmental and social safeguards, and implement plans, \nincluding environmental and social impact assessments and land acquisition and livelihood restoration plans, as well \nas independent safeguard monitoring agents; (iv) monitor the implementation of the gender action plan; (v) maintain \na dam safety advisory panel; and (vi) help communities utilize project benefits for community development. The $7 \nmillion grant is part of the Government of Australia\u2019s overall commitment of $11.7 million that will be administered by \nthe World Bank.  \n\n21  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 ADB.  2013.

Manila. \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f2054), the project ownership will be transferred to the government. The PPA includes provisions \nfor  the  transfer  of  the  plant  in  a  specified  condition  at  the  PPA\u2019s  conclusion  and  for  capacity \nbuilding to enable the government to take over management effectively.23 The PPA tariff is based \non  plant  availability,  regardless  of  water  availability,  meaning  that  Solomon  Power  takes  the \nhydrology risk.    \n \n17. \nEngineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) and operation and maintenance \n(O&M) contracts. The SPC will engage an EPC contractor (expected to be  HEC) to construct \nthe Tina River Hydropower Plant and access road under an EPC contract.24 SPC will engage an \nowners engineer to supervise the EPC contract,25 and the SPC will engage a contractor (expected \nto  be  K-Water)  to  operate  and  maintain  the  plant  and  access  road.  Solomon  Power  will  be \nresponsible for procuring contractors  to construct the transmission line. Drafts of the EPC and \nO&M contracts have been negotiated, but have yet to be finalized.  \n \n18. \nLand lease agreement. The land for the plant has been acquired, and the land title is \nnow  with  the  lands  commissioner  on  behalf  of  the  government.  The  government  is  currently \nestablishing the Tina Core Land Company and will allocate 50% of the company\u2019s shares to the \noriginal landowners. The SPC will then enter into a land lease agreement with the company.26  \n \n19. \nSelection of the concessionaire. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) acted as \ntransaction advisor and helped the government select the concessionaire. ADB\u2019s involvement in \nthe project was requested following the completion of the concessionaire selection. The World \nBank conducted a procurement due diligence and endorsed the concessionaire selection; and \nthe World Bank Board of Directors approved project financing in June 2017. To accommodate \nthe government\u2019s request to finance the project in part, ADB conducted a detailed post-review of \nthe concessionaire selection to ensure that procurement was undertaken in a manner consistent \nwith  the  core  procurement  principles  of  economy,  efficiency,  transparency,  and  fairness  as \noutlined  in  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  review \nconfirmed  that  this  was  the  case.  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  for  a  build\u2013operate\u2013own\u2013\ntransfer  project  stipulate  that  the  concessionaire  should  be  selected  in  a  transparent  manner, \npreferably  through  competitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Eligible  bidders  were \nprovided with the same information and equal opportunity to compete in the bidding. There was \nadequate transparency in the multi-stage selection process, which commenced with a request for \nexpressions of interest in 2011 and was republished in 2014, followed by a prequalification phase \nin 2014 during which two submissions were received. Following the withdrawal of one consortium, \nthe government proceeded to develop the project on a single bidder process based on a modified \nrequest for proposal. The selected concessionaire is a joint venture comprising two firms from \nADB member countries, and the arrangement does not place any restriction on the origin of goods \nto be supplied under the EPC contract. Neither the joint venture nor the firms constituting it are \nsubject to ADB sanctions. The government and World Bank confirmed that no representation or \ncomplaint was received about the concessionaire selection.  \n \n\n                                                \n23 The PPA was prepared with inputs from the IFC\u2019s technical and legal advisors and was signed on 5 December 2018, \nwith  PPA  close  scheduled  within  12  months  of  signing.  The  execution  of  implementation  agreement,  land  lease \nagreement, EPC contract, and GGA are conditions precedent to closing under the PPA. \n\n24 The EPC contract will be a fixed price contract, with the EPC contractor taking construction-related geological risk.  \n25 The owners engineer will verify construction progress to support withdrawal applications to ADB against milestone \n\n26 The government will not commence the establishment of the Tina Core Land Company until all landowners have \n\npayments in the EPC contract.  \n\naccepted the negotiated payment.  \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nA. \n \nThe  technical  design  of  the  proposed  hydropower  plant  has  been  reviewed  and  is \n20. \nconsidered technically viable27. Alternative sites for the plant within the catchment were assessed \nand  the  current  site  is  considered  optimal.  The  TRHPO  prepared  the  feasibility  study  with \ntechnical  support  from  the  World  Bank  and  Government  of  Australia.  Based  on  the  feasibility \nstudy, K-Water submitted a proposed design that was reviewed by the World Bank dam safety \nadvisory panel and modified based on their comments. The advisory panel will continue to provide \nguidance  during  detailed  design,  construction,  reservoir  filling,  and  operation  of  the  plant.  IFC \ntechnical advisors supported the preparation of the minimum functional specifications (contained \nin the PPA) which ensure the plant will be constructed to international standards. The PPA also \ncontains O&M requirements, including plant condition requirements during the transfer of the plant \nto the government. \n \nB. \n \n21. \nEconomic. The project is economically feasible with an economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR) estimated at 9.3%, slightly above the economic opportunity cost of capital (EOCC) of 9%. \nA  sensitivity  analysis  was  conducted  to  test  the  robustness  of  the  project\u2019s  economic  viability \nagainst (i) a 20% increase in capital costs, (ii) a 20% increase in O&M costs, (iii) a 20% decline \nin diesel prices, and (iv) a 1-year delay in operation. The project\u2019s EIRR falls below the minimum \nrequired  EIRR  of  9%  in  3  of  the  4  scenarios  considered.  The  largest  potential  reduction  in \neconomic viability occurs in a scenario with a substantial capital cost overrun. A 20% increase in \ncapital costs reduces the Project\u2019s EIRR to 7.8%. The switching value confirms that any capital \ncost overrun over 3.8% would cause the Project\u2019s EIRR to fall below the EOCC. Further, a one-\nyear delay in realizing Project benefits also reduces the EIRR to 8.8%. The results show that the \nproject\u2019s  economic  viability  may  be  sensitive  to  adverse  shocks.  However,  the  project  is \nconsidered economically viable given that risks are mitigated by robust project preparation and \nthe conservative estimation of benefits, and substantial economic benefits remain unquantified.  \n \nFinancial. The project\u2019s financial viability was examined by comparing incremental costs \n22. \nand benefits in the with- and without-project scenarios. The real weighted average cost of capital \n(WACC)  for  the  SPC  is  2.06%.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  based  on  the  expected \ncashflows is 4.71%, which exceeds the WACC. Financially, the project is viable. The sensitivity \nanalysis reveals that the financial internal rate of return remains above the WACC under such \nadverse scenarios as a 10% increase in operating costs, 10% increase in investment cost and 2-\nyear implementation delay.  \n \nC. \n \n23. \nFinancial management. A financial management assessment has not been completed \non the SPC as it has yet to be fully established. Financial management systems will be established \nand operated by K-Water. A desk review of K-Water and HEC indicated that K-Water is a large \nprogressive company with operations in several countries in partnership with various development \npartners, and that HEC has a robust corporate structure and solid financial performance. K-Water \nand  HEC  both  have  advanced  financial  management  systems.  Project  development  under  a \n                                                \n27 The hydropower plant will include (i) a 72-meter (from foundation) roller compacted concrete dam, (ii) a 3.3-kilometer \nheadrace tunnel (3.3 meters in diameter), (iii) a surge shaft and steel penstock (3 meters in diameter), and (iv) a \npowerhouse with three 5 MW Francis turbines. \n\nGovernance \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\npublic\u2013private  partnership  model  is  a  sustainable  model  due  to  the  lack  of  capacity  within \nSolomon Islands to own and operate the hydropower plant.  \n \n24. \nAnticorruption measures. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n \n25. \nThe project design includes pro-poor and poverty reduction measures, such as engaging \nlow-income  households  (including  landowners)  for  construction  works.  The  project  will  place \ndownward pressure on electricity tariffs which will improve affordability of electricity and reduce \nhousehold expenditure on electricity. The project will comply with applicable national labor laws \nand  core  labor  standards,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  equal  work  for  equal  pay  regardless  of \ngender,  race,  or  ethnicity,  and  excluding  child  labor.  The  TRHPO  will  implement  the  poverty \nreduction measures.  \n \n26. \nThe project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. A gender action plan has \nbeen  developed  based  on  a  gender  analysis  and  community  consultations.  The  plan  includes \nspecific  measures  related  to  the  construction  of  the  hydropower  plant  and  ensuring  long  term \ncompensation  benefits  are  directed  to  women.  Measures  include  (i)  women\u2019s  engagement  in \nconsultation  activities,  (ii) gender  awareness  training for  target groups, (iii)  increased  women\u2019s \nparticipation in project-related contracts, (iv) ensuring compensation is payed directly to women\u2019s \nbank accounts, and (v) community development activities from ongoing lease payments which \nbenefit women.  \n \nE. \n \nEnvironment. The project has been classified as category A for the environment following \n27. \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).28 An environment and social impact assessment has \nbeen prepared and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. Aquatic and terrestrial flora and fauna and habitat \nsurveys  and  impact  assessments  were  conducted,  and  project-affected  communities  were \nconsulted  extensively.  The  main  potential  environmental  impacts  during  construction  are \nincreased sedimentation, the inundation of 30.5 hectares (ha) of the reservoir, the removal of 115 \nha of modified and natural habitat, and minor impacts on fauna. The main potential impacts during \noperation are induced impacts on terrestrial flora and fauna from increased human access to the \nupper catchment, and impacts on aquatic fauna due to reduced water flow in the bypassed river \nsection. The SPC will prepare and implement a biodiversity management plan targeting no net \nloss  of  biodiversity  for  identified  species,  including  an  offset  program  to  rehabilitate  modified \nhabitat. The  project  design  includes an  environmental flow  of  1  cubic  meter  per  second  in the \nbypassed river section. The SPC will update the environmental and social impact assessment, \nenvironmental  and  social  management  plan,  and  other  management  plans  as  required  in  the \nenvironmental and social impact assessment. The TRHPO will monitor and supervise compliance \nwith the approved environmental and social management plan  during construction.29 A climate \nchange  risk  evaluation  was  conducted  and  the  findings  considered  in  the  project  design. \nAdaptation measures include an increase in the spillway size to address anticipated increase flood severity, \nand improved catchment monitoring to predict flooding. \n \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n28 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n29 The TRHPO will have dedicated international and national environment staff to support monitoring and reporting.  \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fInvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The project is classified as category \n28. \nA  for  resettlement  and  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples  following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement.  The  government  has  acquired  428.8  ha  of  customary  land  for  key  project \ninfrastructure. The project will have an economic impact on tribal landowner groups and users \nmainly due to a lack of access to commercial timber and non-timber resources, although there \nwill be no physical displacement. ADB confirmed that the land acquisition processes for the core \nland meet the safeguard policy requirements of the government and ADB. The benefits package \nincludes royalties and the establishment of a benefit-sharing mechanism. Approximately 32.6 ha \nof private land has yet to be acquired for a power transmission corridor. A land acquisition and \nlivelihoods restoration plan will provide compensation and benefits to affected persons, and the \nplan has been disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. Although the Policy on Indigenous Peoples has not \nbeen triggered, all necessary measures to minimize adverse impacts on tribal communities are \nconsistent  with  ADB  requirements.  The  SPC  will  implement  a  community  development  plan, \noverseen by TRHPO and supported by safeguard specialists.  \n \nF. \n \n29.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and management plan.30  \n \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Management Plan \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nSolomon Power will develop a cash reserve \nmechanism by accumulating savings during wet \nperiods to cover additional costs and level out \ntariffs during dry periods. \nSurveys will be updated during site clearance and \ngrouting undertaken as required.  \n\nHydrological risk. As the PPA is established on a net \navailable capacity basis, the hydrology risk lies with Solomon \nPower. During drought periods, Solomon Power will pass \nadditional costs to consumers through higher tariffs.   \nGeological Risk. Geological survey indicated that there may \nbe karstic formations in the catchment which may impact \nreservoir storage.  \nClimate change risk. Climate change modeling indicates a \n25%\u201330% increase in the intensity of peak storm events.   \nDiesel prices experience a significant sustained fall. \nProject benefits are calculated using diesel price projections. \nA sustained low diesel price will reduce project benefits.  \nFinalization of negotiations on project documents. \nNegotiations are advanced on remaining project documents. \nIf these negotiations are extended, this will create delay risks \nand project financing implications.  \nIPP engagement risk. K-Water have a relatively low equity \ninvestment.  \nADB = Asian Development Bank; EPC = engineering, procurement and construction; GGA = government guarantee \nagreement; PPA = power purchase agreement; SPC = special project company.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nThe targeted date for the signing of the EPC \ncontract, implementation agreement, operation \nand maintenance contract, and government \nguarantee agreement is November 2019.  \nK-Water equity has been partially front-loaded.  \n\nThe dam design incorporates the projected \nincrease in peak storm events. \nThe projections are considered reasonable. Diesel \nprices will be monitored. \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS  \n\n30. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM \nand loan documents.
