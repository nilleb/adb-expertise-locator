The  proposed  reforms  will  also  facilitate \nexport diversification. \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nA. \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n3. \nFrom  fiscal  year  (FY)  2017  to  FY2019,  Pakistan  faced  severe  macroeconomic \nmanagement challenges because of (i) a rapidly expanding fiscal deficit; (ii) a large balance-of-\npayments gap and critically low foreign exchange reserves caused by eroding competitiveness, \nan  overvalued  exchange  rate,  and  lack  of  export  diversification;  and  (iii)  growing  losses  from \nseveral major  state-owned  enterprises,  including  burgeoning  energy sector  debt  resulting from \nuntargeted  and  unfunded  subsidies  and  operational  inefficiencies.  Pakistan\u2019s  export  growth \naveraged more than 10% annually from FY2004 to FY2011, peaking at $25.4 billion in FY2011 \nbefore flattening during FY2011\u2013FY2015. Exports fell to $22.0 billion in FY2016 and FY2017 (as \nreflected in almost all major export groups and most destinations), recovered to $24.8 billion in \nFY2018, and declined again to $22.5 billion in FY2020. The rise-and-fall pattern during FY2004\u2013\nFY2020 reveals the underperformance of the country\u2019s export industry and a long-term decline of \nits export competitiveness. The export performance lags that of South Asian and Southeast Asian \ncomparator countries, some of which are relatively new entrants in key export markets, such as \nBangladesh, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam. Pakistan\u2019s ratio of exports to gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) of 10.1% in 2019 was by far the lowest among its competitor countries, and lower \nthan the regional average (South Asia) of 17.6%. \n \n4. \nThe  current  government,  which took  office  in August  2018,  prepared  a  comprehensive \neconomic recovery program to address the issues related to poor macroeconomic management \nand  approached  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  for  assistance.  On  3  July  2019,  the \nexecutive  board  of  the  IMF  approved  a  39-month  extended  arrangement  under  the  IMF\u2019s \nExtended Fund Facility (EFF) for Pakistan.2 The Asian Development Bank (ADB) participated in \ndeveloping  the  economic  recovery  program  and  provided  PBLs  to  support  comprehensive \nreforms  to  improve  macroeconomic  management,  including  export  competitiveness. 3  These \nreform initiatives led to considerable improvements in Pakistan\u2019s macroeconomic management \n\n \n\n1  The  programmatic  approach  and  subprogram  1  were  approved  on  7  August  2020.

A  major  channel  of  impact  is  manufacturing \nproduction,  which  has  affected  the  economy  because  of  three main  reasons:  (i)  demand from \nhigh-income countries for manufacturing goods and raw materials is decreasing; (ii) value chains \nare being disrupted by delays in the delivery of necessary components and supplies from more \ntechnologically advanced countries; and (iii) other factors, including policies (e.g., restrictions on \nthe movement of goods and people). The inability of employees to reach their workplaces and \nfinancial constraints are affecting the normal production process. The pandemic is also affecting \nPakistan\u2019s economy through other important channels such as lower tourism and business travel. \n \n6. \nIn the trade  areas,  under subprogram  1, the Government  of Pakistan  achieved  several \nreforms. Tariffs and ad hoc duties on a large number of raw materials and the intermediate goods \nwere  either  reduced  or  abolished  (Figure  1).  Several  steps  were  taken  to  (i)  introduce  e-\nCommerce; (ii) operationalize PSW, and the EXIMBP; and (iii) strengthen the export certification \nprocess. However, exports also lost their growth momentum because of the pandemic (Table 2).4 \nThe  low  resilience  of Pakistan\u2019s  export  industry  to  unanticipated shocks  is  also  reflected in  its \ninability to diversify its export range.5 Exports are concentrated on less-sophisticated and lower \n\n \n\n4  The sharp downturn in international trade has also adversely affected South Asian countries as export orders have \nbeen canceled or suspended for major labor-intensive products such as garments, leather footwear, handicrafts, and \nshrimp from South Asian countries, causing widespread output and job losses.

However,  health supplies, \nparticularly from the People\u2019s Republic of China, registered good export growth. This is also corroborated in ADB. \n2020. Asian Development Outlook 2020 Update: Wellness in Worrying Times. Manila. Regarding exports of leather \nproducts, the implementation of regulations related to the testing of products across different countries has become \nmore  stringent, and  buyers  are  asking  exporters  to  get their  products  tested  from approved  labs.  The  decline  in \nPakistan\u2019s leather industry during the first 8 months of FY2020 was because of issues faced by exporters in getting \ntheir products tested by local labs. In addition, buyers have become concerned about the environmental issues and \nare specific about certain chemicals that are used in leather products. Few of the chemicals have been banned and \nthe exporters have to replace them with more expensive chemicals that  have deteriorated the competitiveness of \nPakistan\u2019s leather products. \n\n5  A lack of economic and trade diversification is often associated with increased vulnerability to external shocks that \ncan  undermine  prospects  for  stable  growth  in  the  long  run.

This is evident from the dominance \nof  agricultural  products,  textiles,  and  leather  goods  in  the  share  of  total  exports.  Textiles \ncomprised 56.23% of Pakistan\u2019s goods\u2019 exports during FY2015\u2013FY2020; their export value grew \nby  an  annual  average  of  7.10%  during  FY2004\u2013FY2011  but  dropped  by  an  annual  average  of \n0.25% during FY2011\u2013FY2019. Pakistan is losing its export competitiveness because of the high \nconcentration on goods with low sophistication, and because the share of high-tech products in \nits  total  exports  is  less  than  2%.  More  complex  product  categories\u2014e.g.,  chemicals, \npharmaceuticals,  plastics,  machinery,  gems,  jewelry,  and  appliances\u2014have  small  shares  of \noverall exports (0.03%\u20132.20%) and had low or negative export growth during FY2011\u2013FY2020. \n \n\nItem \n\nTotal exports \nFood items \nTextiles \nLeather products \n\nTable 2: Impact of COVID-19 on Export Growth \n(%) \nJuly 2019\u2013May \n2020 \n(6.9) \n(5.0) \n(6.1) \n(9.3) \n\nJuly 2019\u2013February \n2020 \n3.6 \n5.5 \n5.3 \n(3.4) \n\nJuly 2019\u2013June \n2020 \n(7.2) \n(2.0) \n(6.0) \n(4.7) \n\nJuly\u2013Sept. 2020 \n\n(10.7) \n(17.8) \n2.9 \n6.2 \n\n( ) = negative, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease. \nNote: Export figures are valued in United States dollars.  \nSource: State Bank of Pakistan.

Poor  growth  in  exports  during the  first  quarter  of  FY2021  was  primarily  driven  by  food \nexports, especially wheat, due to the adverse impact of the locust invasion.

The MOF  has \nstopped  taking  loans  from  the  State  Bank  of  Pakistan  (SBP)  to  finance  its  deficit.  The  SBP \ncontinues  its  data-driven  monetary  policy  responses  to  support  recovery  in  growth  and \nemployment while keeping inflation expectations low. The policy rate was reduced by 100 basis \npoints on 25 June (from 8% to 7%), part of a cumulative reduction of 625 basis points from mid-\nMarch 2020 to June 2020. The EFF program, initiated in 2019, was disrupted by the COVID-19 \npandemic.  The IMF  provided  an  additional  $1.4  billion  under  its  Rapid  Financing  Instrument  in \nApril  2020  to  ensure  that  the  EFF  program  targets  are  not  compromised  or  derailed.  The \ngovernment and the IMF have resumed technical discussions on completing selected structural \nbenchmarks. While substantial progress has been made on a wide range of benchmarks, more \nwork needs to be done in two areas: energy and tax reforms. Once the agreement is reached, \npending reviews will be combined to assess the compliance status of the structural benchmarks \nand continuous performance criteria; and recommend disbursement of the pre-identified program \ntranches. \n \n9. \nThe  programmatic  approach  and  the  role  of  subprogram  2.  Subprogram  2  is \nembedded in a programmatic approach (combining two subprograms) to facilitate implementation \nof key reforms in a sequential manner, which will strengthen the export sector\u2019s competitiveness \nand \nfor  successful  trade \ndiversification  and  improved  competitiveness  that  are  expected  to  improve  resilience  to \nunanticipated shocks: (i) provision of an appropriate incentive structure through rationalization of \ninput  costs,  (ii)  investments  and  policy  reforms  targeted  at  strengthening  key  trade-related \ninstitutions  and  reducing  trade  costs,  and  (iii)  government interventions  directed  at  institutional \nfailures. 9  Effective  policies  to  support  improved  trade  competitiveness  and  reallocation  of \nresources toward product diversification should therefore address the major constraining factors, \nwhich encompass (i) a distorted incentive structure because of high input costs, (ii) low investment \nin  research  and  development,  (iii)  weak  trade  facilitation  institutions,  and  (iv)  high  financial \nintermediation  costs  for  entrepreneurs  (especially  new  entrepreneurs).  The  reforms  proposed \nunder this programmatic approach (combining both subprograms 1 and 2) encompass all these \nareas.  Moreover,  reforms  were  designed  in  a  phased  manner  for  implementation  over  two \nsubprograms.  Implementation  of  some  critical  reforms  will  continue  with  ADB\u2019s  technical \nassistance (TA) support under the post-program partnership framework (P3F). These reforms are \nbroadly categorized into two groups (paras. 10\u201312). \n \n10. \nHigh raw material costs had an adverse impact on exports. High tariffs and duties on \nthe import of raw materials including synthetic products and man-made fibers continue to restrict \nPakistani manufacturers from  producing  high value-added  products  including  synthetic textiles \n(including  finished  garments)  and  products  to  meet  trends  in  global  demand.  This  constrains \npotential export value growth and results in underperformance of textile exports. Instead, Pakistan \nis competing with lower-income countries exporting low-tech products at more competitive wage \nrates.10 \n \n11. \nPoor  institutional  capacities  eroded Pakistan\u2019s  export potential.

Complex and cumbersome official \nprocedures, including customs procedures for exporters and importers, also create high costs of \ndoing  business.  This  emphasizes  the  need  to  streamline  border  control  and  documentary \nprocedures, and operationalize the single window system for exporters and importers. \n \n12. \nThe  institutions  and  bodies  established  to  provide  essential  trade-related  services  to \nexporters have inherent weaknesses, leading to high transaction costs. Institutions responsible \nfor metrology and product testing, certification services for export product quality, accreditation \nservices for testing bodies, intellectual property rights enforcement, and establishment of special \neconomic  zones  play  a  critical  role  in  trade  facilitation  and  competitiveness.  However,  these \ninstitutions lack capacity and are not efficient. Consequently, corporations and small businesses \nsuffer from  a lack  of  quality services  to  comply  with  changes  in  world trade  rules  embodied in \ntechnical  barriers  to  trade  and  sanitary  and  phytosanitary  measures  of  the  World  Trade \nOrganization.  For  example,  exports  of  many  agricultural  commodities  suffer  because  of  poor \ntesting and certification facilities. In addition, limited access to trade finance places many small \nand  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  and  other  exporters  at  a  disadvantage  to  international \ncompetitors that can access financial support from their country\u2019s national export credit agency, \nincluding  credit  enhancements,  lower  cost  of  financing,  and  insurance  for  extended  payment \nterms. This bottleneck has imposed serious challenges to exporters, especially after the financial \ncrisis  in  2008\u20132009.  This  can  be  improved  through  full  operationalization  of  the  EXIMBP. 11 \nFinancing constraints are more serious for women entrepreneurs. The lack of financial capacity \nwas reported to be the major bottleneck for women entrepreneurs in surveys conducted during \n2015 and 2016.12 \n \nB. \n\nPolicy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\n13. \nThe vision of the government\u2019s Strategic Trade Policy Framework (STPF), 2020\u20132025 is \nfor  Pakistan  to  become  a  dynamic  and  efficient  domestic  market  and  a  globally  competitive \nexport-driven economy.13 To achieve sustainable rapid export growth, a comprehensive strategy \nhas been devised to (i) optimize the growth of existing export sectors in the short term, (ii) diversify \ninto new export sectors to be identified through stakeholder engagement in the medium term, and \n(iii)  identify  the  innovation-driven  export  sectors  for  support  interventions  in  the  long  term. \nPakistan Vision 2025 also articulates the government\u2019s aim to encourage trade, increase exports \nand improve the competitiveness of domestic industries in Pakistan to aid recovery of the current \naccount deficit, and promote macroeconomic stability and sustained high growth.14 The objectives \nof the STPF are to (i) make exports an effective driver for economic growth, (ii) reduce the relative \ndisincentive for exporting industries by removing structural anomalies, and (iii) improve the trade \n\n \n\n11 The World Bank commissioned a firm and bank survey on trade and trade finance developments in  14 developing \ncountries across five regions during the first quarter of 2009. The survey included 425 firms and 78 banks, and its \nfindings confirmed that the global financial crisis constrained trade finance for exporters and importers in developing \ncountries. The impact varied by firm size, sector activity, and countries\u2019 integration in the global economy.

The \nmain goals of the STPF are to (i) attain an exports volume of $45 billion by FY2025;15 (ii) improve \ncompetitiveness  and  efficiency  of  the  industry sector,  especially the  export sector,  by  ensuring \nlow tariffs on raw materials; (iii) promote young entrepreneurs for export diversification;16 and (iv) \npromote sustainable, socially compliant, inclusive, and gender-sensitive export development. \n \n14. \nThe  program  facilitates  identification  and  implementation  of key  reforms  to  address  the \ndevelopment challenges, as explained above, and  to improve Pakistan\u2019s export performance.17 \nThe proposed reforms are logically sequenced, and grouped in two areas under the programmatic \napproach: \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nTax  and  tariff  rationalization.  The  principal  objective  of  this  reform  area  is  to \npromote a business environment enabling export competitiveness and facilitating \nprivate  sector  investment.  Price  competitiveness  will  be  enhanced  through \nabolition or reduction of several regulatory and customs duties on raw materials \nand intermediate inputs. Under subprogram 1, the government (a) submitted the \ndraft National Tariff Policy to the federal cabinet for approval; (b) rationalized the \ntariff rates into a maximum of four slabs, with a peak rate of 20%; (c) abolished or \nreduced customs and regulatory duties on several raw materials and intermediate \ninputs; and (d) reduced the corporate income tax rate from 30% to 29% for FY2019 \nto  facilitate  corporate  investment  and  trade.  These  reforms  will  continue  with \nfollow-up  policy  actions  proposed  for  subprogram  2  and  the  P3F.  Under \nsubprogram 2, the government (a) approved the National Tariff Policy in November \n2019,  (b)  rationalized  further  customs  duties  for  several  raw  material  and \nintermediate  inputs,  and  (c)  removed  the  electricity  surcharge  of  PRs3.35  per \nkilowatt-hour on industrial consumers. \nInstitutional  strengthening.  Rationalization  of  taxes,  customs  and  regulatory \nduties,  and  tariffs  alone  cannot  improve Pakistan\u2019s exports  unless  the  legal  and \ninstitutional structures  relevant to  trade  are  strengthened.  Four  important  reform \nareas  are  targeted  under  the  program:  (a)  introducing  e-Commerce,  (b) \noperationalizing the PSW, (c) operationalizing the EXIMBP, and (d) strengthening \nthe system of certification and accreditation. Under subprogram 1, the government \n(a)  prepared  the  draft  e-Commerce  Policy  Framework;  (b)  approved  the \noperational rules for appointments, promotions, and transfers of employees of the \nPakistan  National Accreditation  Council  (PNAC)  (which  published  on the PNAC \nwebsite  long-term  plans,  policies,  and  schemes  in  line  with  international  best \npractices,  including  certification  for  export  of  gems  and  jewelry);  (c)  notified  the \nhigh-level steering committee  for  PSW, the  project management  office,  and  five \nworking groups to promote export facilitation; (d) approved the PSW blueprint and \nimplementation plan to operationalize the PSW; (e) prepared the draft PSW Act, \nwhich  articulates  the  business  processes  of  the  PSW  in  accordance  with \ninternational legal standards and best practices, for stakeholder consultations; (f) \napproved  specific  amendments  to the  Refinance  and  Credit  Guarantee Scheme \nfor Women Entrepreneurs in Underserved Areas to  expand its applicability to all \n\n \n\n15 A more modest and feasible target is in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n16 The  government\u2019s  targeted  programs  for  young  entrepreneurs  include  the  Kamyab  Jawan  Program  and  the \nRefinance  and  Credit  Guarantee  Scheme  for  Women  Entrepreneurs.  The  EXIMBP  will  also  support  young \nentrepreneurs. \n\n17 Effective collaboration between development partners and donors is essential to address infrastructure constraints \nthat raise trade and logistics costs. Efficient reallocation of resources across  sectors and productive uses of these \nresources depend upon an appropriate incentive structure and access to finance, among other factors. These two \nfactors are critical to promote export diversification and provide encouragement to young entrepreneurs. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nto  allow  working  capital  financing \n\nfor  women \ndistricts  of  Pakistan  and \nentrepreneurs to improve their access to finance; and (g) initiated the process of \nrecruitment  of  a  full-time  professional  chief  executive  officer  for  the  EXIMBP. \nThese reforms will continue with policy actions proposed for subprogram 2. The \nimplementation  will  also  continue  and  be  monitored  under  the  P3F.  Under \nsubprogram  2,  the  government  (a)  approved  the  e-commerce  implementation \nstrategy; 18  (b)  recommended  the  amendments  in  the  PNAC  Act,  2017  to \nreconstitute the  board of  directors  of the PNAC to  (1) include professionals  with \nsector expertise and scientific knowledge, (2) restrict the ex officio board members \nto  one-third  of  the  total  board  members,  (3)  ensure  at  least  one  female  board \nmember,  and  (4) fix the term for  each member to  3  years  (other  than  ex officio \nmembers); (c) ensured the approval of the short-term and long-term plans, policies, \nand schemes of the PNAC;19 (d) submitted the draft PSW Act to the Parliament for \napproval;  (e)  operationalized  Pakistan  Single  Window  Company  through  the \nfollowing  critical  steps:  (1)  issuance  of  a  certificate  of  incorporation  by  the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, (2) notification by the Federal \nBoard of Revenue on the transfer of the PSW\u2019s share of the goods declaration fee \nto the PSW, (3) notification by the competent authority to appoint the PSW\u2019s board \nof  directors,  (4)  approval  of  the  board  of  directors  for  appointment  of  core \nmanagement staff, (5) budget allocation for PSW in the Public Sector Development \nProgram  for  FY2021  after  approval  of  the  PSW  project  plan  by  the  executive \ncommittee  of  the  National Economic  Council,  and  (6)  approval  of  technical  and \nbusiness  requirement  specification  documentation  for  PSW  core  services;  (f) \napproved  an  integrated  risk  management  system  (IRMS)  for  six  government \nagencies;20 (g) amended the Refinance and Credit Guarantee Scheme for Women \nEntrepreneurs to  increase the credit limit  from PRs1.5  million  to  PRs5.0 million; \nand  (h)  approved  the  business  and  finance  plans  of the  EXIMBP  and  published \nthe draft EXIMBP Act on the Finance Division website. \n\n \n15. \nRevisions  in  subprogram  2  policy  actions.  There  are  two  types  of  revisions  in  the \nsubprogram  2  policy  matrix  from  the  indicative  policy  matrix  proposed  during  approval  of \nsubprogram 1:21 \n(i) \n\nA number of actions were strengthened further, better targeted, and streamlined \nfor effective and speedy implementation of the relevant reforms.  For example, in \nthe case of strengthening, additional raw materials were brought under the tariff \nrationalization plan to provide more relief to exporters. Similarly, the policy actions \nrelated to the operationalization of the PSW were strengthened and better targeted \n\n \n\n18 The implementation plan emphasizes (i) developing an e-commerce portal to support single window operations, (ii) \nimproving  regulations  governing e-commerce,  (iii)  facilitating cross-border  trade,  (iv)  easing  processes  governing \nremittances flow, (v) ensuring consumer protection and improving confidence, (vi) harmonizing the taxation structure, \nand (vii) integrating logistics in the e-commerce value chain. \n\n19 The PNAC\u2019s short-term plan envisages widening the PNAC\u2019s scope of recognition to include additional certifications, \nincluding  those  governing  medical  laboratories,  gems  and  jewelry,  food  safety  systems,  and  information \nmanagement. Under its long-term plan, the PNAC will strengthen its human resource and strategic locations across \nPakistan to (i) improve continuous surveillance as required under the International Organization for Standardization \n17011 standard (requirements for accreditation bodies accrediting conformity assessment bodies) and (ii) increase \nthe number of conformity assessment bodies to 350 by 2025. \n\n20 The six agencies selected for the IRMS are the ones that have the mandate to hold cargo at ports, and thus can put \nclearance  on  hold,  leading  to  port  congestion.  Most  of  the  other  agencies  rely  on  post-clearance  audits  or \ninterventions off the port. These six agencies have been selected for the IRMS because of the number of transactions \nthey process for the first phase of the PSW. The time release studies also suggested prioritizing these agencies over \nothers for the PSW. \n\n21 Revisions in the Policy Matrix (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f9 \n\n(ii) \n\nby selecting relevant actions needed for its speedy operationalization. Given that \ne-commerce involves crosscutting issues\u2014across departments as well as across \nfederal  and  provincial  governments\u2014a  single  piece  of  legislation  is  difficult \nbecause it might prompt the need for repeated amendments to make it consistent \nwith various provisions under the provincial acts and changing guidelines and rules \nfor  e-commerce.  Many  countries  with  a  federal  system  of  government  have \nacknowledged this problem.22 Therefore, this action was streamlined by preparing \nan  implementation  strategy,  which  was  approved  by  the  National  e-Commerce \nCouncil. The draft EXIMBP Act was uploaded to the MOF website. \nActions related to further rationalization of the corporate tax rate and abolition of \nthe requirement to certify nonavailability of locally produced capital goods to make \nuse of duty-free imports were deferred to the P3F because of (a) the need to revive \neconomic activities subdued because of COVID-19 and (b) the losses of federal \nrevenue during FY2020 attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. The P3F has been \ndesigned to ensure continuity of reforms. ADB\u2019s ongoing TA support will continue \nto  facilitate  implementation  of  some  important  initiatives  (e.g.,  the  e-commerce \nportal,  the  PSW,  and  capacity  development  in  the  PNAC).  Monitoring  of  the \ncontinuity  of  reforms  (and  avoidance  of  slippages)  as  well  as  TA  activities \nnecessitated the inclusion of the P3F in the design of the programmatic approach. \nThe P3F will also help ADB design future programs in these areas. \n\n \n16. \nSequencing of reforms will remain critical during subprograms 1 and 2 and the P3F. For \nexample,  operationalization  of  the  PSW  and  setting  up  of  the  EXIMBP  will  require  a  gradual \napproach.  Therefore,  a  programmatic  approach  supported  by  the  P3F  is  suitable  for \nchronologically sequencing the  reforms in  a multiyear framework. It  also enables  alignment  of \npolicy actions with unavoidable realities and exogenous shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \n17. \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 prioritizes strengthening governance and institutional capacity. The \nprogram  will  not  only  facilitate  continued  reforms  in  this  direction  but  will  also  contribute  to \noperational priority 2 of Strategy 2030 (accelerating progress in gender equality).23 The program \nis included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Pakistan, 2020\u20132022. The program is \nalso  aligned  with ADB\u2019s country  partnership strategy for  Pakistan,  2021\u20132025  (currently  under \npreparation),  which  emphasizes  the  government\u2019s  objective  of  higher,  inclusive,  and  sustained \ngrowth.   \n \n18. \nADB\u2019s value addition stems from its long experience in designing and implementing PBLs \nin  its  developing  member  countries,  including  Pakistan.24 These  loans  have  covered  several \nareas of economic management, including revenue mobilization and expenditure rationalization. \nADB has also supported reforms in state-owned enterprises and the energy sector in Pakistan. \n\n \n\n22 Government of India, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade. 2019.

The \nprogrammatic approach, including subprogram 2, draws on lessons from these loans. Some of \nthe important prerequisites for a successful policy-based reform program are strong government \ncommitment,  adequate  support  from  all  stakeholders,  public  awareness  campaigns  to  inform \nstakeholders, and strengthening of social safety nets for constituency building for reforms.25 ADB \nis well placed to carry out effective dialogue with the government on sensitive reforms. \n \n19. \nADB\u2019s  value  addition  can  be  categorized  under  three  broad  groups:  (i)  facilitating \nidentification  and  sequencing  of  (a)  key  reforms,  both  with  immediate  impact  (tariff  and  tax \nrationalization) and medium-term impact (institutional strengthening), and (b) international good \npractices  in  several  areas  of  economic  management;  (ii)  providing  operational  support  to \nimplement complex reforms (such as setting up of the EXIMBP, PSW, e-commerce portal, etc.) \nwith  the  help  of  the  transaction  TA;  and  (iii)  coordinating  with  other  development  partners, \nespecially the IMF and the World Bank, to provide a unified reform package to the government. \nADB\u2019s stand-alone transaction TA for Preparing the Trade and Competitiveness Program totaling \n$750,000 from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance  Special Fund  (TASF-other sources)  was  approved \non  5  September  2018 to support the  effective  preparation  and  implementation  of  the  program, \nincluding  technical  support  and  capacity  building;  supplementary  financing  of  $300,000  was \nprovided later.26 \n \nDevelopment  partner  and  donor  coordination.  The  ADB  program  team  has  been \n20. \nclosely coordinating with other development partners and donors in Pakistan as part of the Group \nof  Five  (G5),27 as  well  as through  other forums  and meetings,  to  identify key structural  reform \nareas.  ADB  is  coordinating  its  efforts  to  improve  trade  and  competitiveness  with  other \ndevelopment partners based on a common set of reforms that are important to accelerate and \nsustain  medium-term  growth.  The scope  and  coverage  of subprogram  2 have  been  discussed \nwith  the  G5  donors  and  development  partners.  The  program  complements  IMF-led  reform \ninitiatives by helping to improve competitiveness, which will help build robust foreign exchange \nreserves. Therefore, regular consultations with the IMF continue, especially in the context of EFF \nimplementation. ADB\u2019s support for the PSW draws from the initial plan prepared with support from \nthe United States Agency for International Development. \n \nC. \n\nImpacts of the Reform \n\n21. \nPakistan\u2019s overarching development objective is to enhance economic benefits from trade. \nThus, improving export competitiveness will remain an important pillar. The effects of the reform \nwill  be  the  following:  competitiveness  improved,  and  exports  increased. The  program  will  help \nachieve the government\u2019s development objectives through the proposed reforms, which will help \nstrengthen  Pakistan\u2019s  trade  competitiveness.  These  reforms  will  primarily  (i)  help  Pakistan\u2019s \nexport items to become more price competitive in international markets, and (ii) make Pakistan\u2019s \ntrade infrastructure and institutions conducive for higher exports and diversification of exportable \ngoods. \n \n\n \n\n25 Independent Evaluation Department. 2018.

Revenue losses from tax and tariff rationalization and operationalization of the PSW \nand EXIMBP will lead to additional fiscal stress. The amount of fiscal stress is estimated to be $2 \nbillion  over  a  3-year  period  (FY2019\u2013FY2021).  The  government  is  in  the  midst  of  a \ncomprehensive fiscal consolidation exercise encompassing the following: (i) reducing the debt-\nto-GDP  ratio  to set  it  on  a  firm  downward  trajectory,  (ii)  maintaining  a sustainable  fiscal  deficit \nwhile  safeguarding  macroeconomic  stability,  and  (iii)  setting  the  stage  for  sustainable  and \ninclusive growth by enhancing expenditure on social and economic infrastructure. The COVID-19 \npandemic  and  the  government\u2019s  resulting  stimulus  package  further  burdened  the  public \nexchequer. The consolidated fiscal deficit (including grants)-to-GDP ratio is expected to remain \nhigh during FY2021. As a result, the government will face two challenges: \n\nIt  will  need  to  create fiscal  headroom,  despite  additional  expenditure  to mitigate \nthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, to incur additional development finances \non targeted reforms proposed under the program. This is a clear illustration of a \nhard  budget  constraint  and  its  impact  on  development  financing,  given  the \ndownward  rigidity  in  nondiscretionary  items  of  recurrent  expenditure  (salary, \npensions, and interest). \nStrong  expenditure  rationalization  and  revenue  mobilization  efforts  will  need  to \ncontinue to create room for additional reform-related expenditure, to the extent it \nis  reflected  in  the  federal  budget.  The  projected  fiscal  deficit  in  FY2021  and  its \nfinancing are summarized in Table 4.

The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years; an interest rate of 2% per year during the grace period and thereafter; and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.  \n \n24. \nDebt  sustainability.  The  debt  sustainability  analysis  carried  out  in  May  2020  for  the \nCOVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support Program included the subprogram 2 loan \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\namount.28   The debt-to-GDP ratio (excluding guarantees) is expected to decline from 87.2% in \nFY2020 to 73.4% by FY2024.29  The debt stock is estimated to be almost 91% of GDP (including \nguarantee) in FY2020. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n25. \nThe  MOF  will  be  the  executing  agency  of  the  program.  The  MOF,  Federal  Board  of \nRevenue,  Ministry  of  Commerce, PNAC,  and EXIMBP  will  be  the  implementing  agencies. The \nproceeds of the PBL will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2017, as amended from time to time). The programmatic approach will be implemented over 36 \nmonths  (1  January  2018\u201331  December  2020).  Implementation  of  subprogram  2  will cover  the \nperiod  from  June  2019  to  December  2020,  and  the  P3F  is  expected  to  be  implemented  from \nJanuary to December 2021. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n26. \nSeveral outputs of the program have technical components at their core. Setting up of the \nEXIMBP,  to  be  supported  under  the  program,  will  require  strong  financial  and  project \nmanagement and selection skills. Similarly, operationalizing the PSW will require sound technical \nknowledge.  Capacity  building  support  under  the  program  will  assist  the  relevant  government \ndepartments to better manage these technical operations. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic \n\n27. \nThe impacts of the program on the economy were analyzed, and  the results demonstrate \nimportant benefits attributable to the programmatic approach (combining two subprograms). The \nkey direct and indirect benefits considered are classified into four groups: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nGiven  the  low  but  statistically  significant  price  elasticity  of  export  demand, \nPakistan\u2019s  export  competitiveness  will  be  improved  by  rationalization  of  tariffs, \nregulatory duties, and commodity taxes.30 This will also facilitate higher growth by \ncreating demand for necessary domestically manufactured raw materials. \nHigher foreign exchange reserves will allow domestic output to increase, permitting \na resulting increase in imports. \nSeveral reforms related to trade facilitation, including improved access to finance, \nwill ease supply-side constraints, which will lead to trade diversification catering to \nthe group with higher income elasticity of demand.31 \nHigher private investment because of a reduction in the corporate tax rate and tariff \nrationalization. In turn, improved private investment in Pakistan will lead to higher  \ngrowth, trade diversification, and more employment opportunities. \n\n \n\n28 ADB.  2020.

ADB Economics Working Paper Series. No. 160. Manila: ADB. \n\n\f13 \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nA  governance  risk  assessment  was  recently  prepared  by  ADB  staff.32 This assessment \n28. \nincluded a review of areas of possible risk and vulnerability in public financial management. The \ninternal audit functions of the government will require improvements. External audits, performed \nby  the  constitutionally  independent  office  of  the  Auditor  General  of  Pakistan,  continue  to  face \ndelays in the execution of audits and the settlement of audit observations. The assessment found \nsome  risks  that  are  relevant  for  subprogram  2.  They  include  risks  related  to  institutional \ndimensions of the proposed reforms (e.g., weak capacity in the relevant institutions and lack of \ncoordination between different agencies). Moreover, key reforms may not be implemented in a \ntimely manner because of budget credibility and hard budget constraints of the government. While \nno major risks of mismanagement of resources at the implementing level have been discerned, \nissues identified in institutional capacity and financial sustainability, especially for the PSW and \nEXIMBP,  were  targeted  for  capacity  development  under  the  transaction  TA  (footnote  26)  and \npolicy changes under the program. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n29. \nThe  poverty  reduction  and  social  impacts  of  the  program  are  positive.  The  support  for \nimproved growth through higher exports will have significant impact on employment opportunities. \nThis issue has gained more prominence  during the COVID-19 pandemic, as a large number of \nvulnerable workers have lost their jobs, and the poverty ratio is expected to rise alarmingly.33 The \nprogram has proposed targeted gender-related actions. Improved access to finance for women \nentrepreneurs and facilitation of certification of  jewelry will have a significant impact on women \nexporters. Research shows that women entrepreneurs lack access to basic banking services.34 \nMoreover,  this  problem  is  exacerbated  when  women  entrepreneurs  apply  for trade  finance  for \nexports.  Businesses  owned  by  women  tend  to  be  smaller  and  less  formal,  women \ndisproportionately have lower access to collateral, and women are often overlooked as a viable \nbusiness segment by the financial service providers. Subprogram 2 will address this issue and \nfacilitate  further  amendment  to  one  of  the  existing  bank  finance  schemes  for  women \nentrepreneurs.35 The  Refinance  and  Credit  Guarantee  Scheme  for  Women  Entrepreneurs  has \nalready  been  amended  to  cover  all  the  districts  in  Pakistan  under  subprogram  1.  The  new \namendment will increase loan size significantly to cover working capital as well as new investment \nrequirements. 36  One  major  problem  is  that  the  scheme  is  not  known  to  many  women \nentrepreneurs. This is true in not only far-flung rural areas, but also urban centers. The transaction \nTA  will  help  implement  this  scheme  through  public  awareness  campaigns  through  prominent \nEnglish newspaper.37 The program will also facilitate representation of female board members in \n\n \n\n32 ADB. 2020.

This paper reiterates the fact (based on surveys) that finance \nis the primary barrier to trade for women entrepreneurs. \n\n36 The details of the scheme are as follows: (i) financing is available to women entrepreneurs across the country for a \nperiod of up to 5 years, including a maximum grace period of up to 6 months; (ii) the maximum financing limit under \nthe scheme will be PRs5,000,000; and (iii) financing under the scheme is being provided for  the setting up of new \nbusiness enterprises or for the expansion of existing ones. \n\n37 Alternative mechanisms will be developed to improve access to finance based on the results of the surveys under \n\nthe COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support Program. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nthe PNAC. Finally, improved trade facilitation services, including e-commerce facilities, will help \nwomen exporters. Subprogram 2 is categorized some gender elements. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n30. \nThe policy actions supported by the program are not expected to have adverse  impacts \non  the  environment  and  indigenous  peoples,  nor  lead  to  involuntary  resettlement.  Given  the \nnature of the program, all three safeguard categories (environment, involuntary resettlement, and \nindigenous peoples) are categorized C under the PBL. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.38 \n \n\nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nGovernment funds are not available for critical \nreforms, causing delays in the implementation of \nkey reforms, such as the Pakistan Single Window \nand operationalization of the Export\u2013Import Bank \nof Pakistan. \nDelays in implementation of the key structural \nbenchmarks under the EFF program may also \ncause delays in the implementation of the reforms \nunder the program. \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nAdditional program monitoring under the P3F will facilitate \ngreater policy dialogue to avoid risks of slippages under the \nprogram. ADB will collaborate with other donors and \ndevelopment partners to ensure aid effectiveness and \nprovide adequate capacity development support. \nADB will collaborate with other donors and development \npartners to highlight the importance of structural \nbenchmarks, proposed under the EFF, in fostering improved \nmacroeconomic management.
