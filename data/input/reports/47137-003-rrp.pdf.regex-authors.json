THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Health Sector Governance Program, (ii) a proposed policy-\nbased loan to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for subprogram 1 of the Health \nSector Governance Program, and (iii) a proposed technical assistance (TA) loan to the Lao \nPDR for subprogram 1 of the Health Sector Governance Program.1 \n \n2.  The  proposed  programmatic  approach  will  support  the  government\u2019s  Health  Sector \nReform Strategy (HSRS), which aims to (i) improve access to basic health care and financial \nprotection by 2020; and (ii) achieve universal health coverage (UHC) by 2025, through more \nefficient use of public resources and expanded health financing.2 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Development  problems.  The  Lao  PDR  has  made  notable  achievements  in  health \noutcomes since the 1990s. However, significant challenges remain to meet key Millennium \nDevelopment Goal (MDG) targets. The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) decreased from 405 \nmaternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 1995 to an MMR of 357, still well short of the MDG \nMMR target of 260. The infant mortality rate has fallen to 68 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2012 \ncompared with the MDG target of 45 deaths per 1,000 live births. The child mortality rate (under \n5 years) was 79 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2012, while the MDG target is 70. Only 37% of \npregnant mothers have adequate anti-natal care (four visits to a health practitioner prior to \nbirth). Further, only 41.5% of mothers have a skilled birth attendant at birth, and 37.5% have an \ninstitution-based delivery.3 \n \n4.  Lao PDR\u2019s challenge in achieving its MDG targets in health arises because utilization of \nhealth services in the Lao PDR is relatively low; ambulatory care visits per capita per year have \nbeen below 1 in most areas of the country. Poor utilization of health services is due in part to the \npoor quality of health facilities, lack of staff, and low operational budget for outreach services. \nHigh  user  fees,  including  the  cost  of  pharmaceuticals,  constitute  another  major  barrier \npreventing the poor, mothers and children from accessing health services. Fiscal year (FY) \n2012 national health accounts (NHAs) report that out-of-pocket expenses constitute 44.5% of \ntotal health expenditures, amounting to $35.5 per capita.4 \n \n5.  Binding constraints. The key binding constraints to improving utilization and quality of \nhealth  services  relate  to  insufficient funding  of  healthcare facilities,  which  in  turn  impedes \naccess to healthcare facilities by the poor; weak public financial management in the healthcare \nsector (budget planning, execution, and reporting); and weak human resources in the sector.  \nFor example, while the number of health workers increased significantly in 2013\u20132014, but \nprimary health care facilities often lack health staff. In 2013, 33% of health centers had a \ncommunity midwife (compared with a target of 100%), and 90% of health centers had less than \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The World Health Organization (WHO) defines UHC as \u201censuring that all people can use the promotive, preventive, \ncurative, rehabilitative, and palliative health services they need, of sufficient quality to be effective, while also \nensuring that the use of these services does not expose the user to financial hardship.\u201d WHO.

", "2 \nfour health workers (the target is at least five). Provincial health offices (PHOs) lack information \non staff skills, health workforce development, and deployment plans. There is no functioning \nregulatory system for licensing and registration of health professionals. Private sector health \ncare providers are concentrated in Vientiane and other major cities, and provide health services \nfor the higher-income segment of the population. The regulation of the private health providers \nneeds to  be  strengthened.  Furthermore,  while  the  planning  and  budgeting  capacity  of  the \nMinistry of Health (MOH) has improved, the linkage between health service performance and \nbudget allocation remains weak. Financial management systems do not capture the revenues \ngenerated by the sale of medicines and fees for services, which constitute about 50% of total \nrevenues in health facilities (footnote 4). The development budget, including all budgets from \naid-financed projects, is not disaggregated, and there is no institutionalized system of NHAs.5 \n \n6.  Government\u2019s sector strategy. Since 2000, the government has introduced policies \nand strategies to guide health sector reforms aimed at achieving the MDGs, improving health \nfinancing and systems, setting standards, and strengthening health sector coordination. The \ngovernment\u2019s  Seventh  National  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan,  2011\u20132015  reflects  its \ncommitment  to  improve  human  development  outcomes.  To  address  key  health  sector \nconstraints,  in  2013  the  National  Assembly  approved  the  HSRS,  which  aims  to  provide \naffordable, reliable, and accessible health services for all. A key objective of the HSRS is to \nimprove (i) social protection for the poor, mothers, and children; and (ii) health service delivery. \nHSRS  has  identified  a  range  of  key  governance,  public  sector  management,  and  health \nprogram reforms to improve the performance and coverage of the health sector. It includes five \npriority areas: (i) health human resources development; (ii) health financing; (iii) organization \nand management; (iv) service delivery, with an emphasis on maternal and child care; and (v) \ninformation, monitoring, and evaluation. The objectives for 2025 UHC include (i) skilled health \nworkers deployed in all health facilities according to needs, (ii) out of pocket expenses amount \nto less than 40% of total health expenditures, (iii) performance-based funding mechanisms are \nintroduced, and (iv) health care quality assurance is introduced in all health facilities. \n \n7.  The  National  Assembly  has  committed  to  a  target  of  9%  of  general  government \nexpenditure  for  health.  Expenditure  for  health  increased  to  7.5%  of  total  government \nexpenditure  in  FY2013,  from  3%  in  FY2012;  subsequently,  the  budget  has  fallen  to  an \nestimated 7% in FY2015. Critically, non-salary recurrent budgets at the provincial level have \ngrown substantially (by a factor of 5\u20136) since FY2011. However, the system remains generally \nunderfunded.  External  development  assistance  accounted  for  35%  of  the  total  health \nexpenditures in FY2014. \n \n8.  To make health services accessible to the poor, the government has introduced Health \nEquity Fund (HEF) schemes across the country.6 HEF is a social protection scheme, targeting \nthe poor as identified by village and district authorities. In 2014, the HEF schemes covered \n46,870 poor families, or about 45% of all poor households.7 The government uses the revenues \ngenerated  by  major  hydroelectric  investments to finance the  social  protection  schemes,  in \nconjunction with development partners. The government has also implemented a free maternal, \nneonatal, and child health care (MNCH) scheme, financed by a combination of government \nrevenues and external assistance. However, the implementation, financial management, and \n                                                \n5  NHAs describe the sources, uses, and channels for both public and private funds used in the health sector and are \nessential to optimize allocation and mobilization of health sector resources. \n6  The HEF, established in 2007, provides free public health care services for the poor by removing major barriers to \nhealth facility and/or health service access, such as transportation, the cost of pharmaceuticals, and other health \ncare costs paid by those seeking care. \n7  Ministry of Health. 2014. Summary Report on Implementation of Health Activities. Vientiane. \n ", "3 \nmonitoring  mechanisms  for  these  schemes  differ,  depending  on  the  funding  source.  The \ngovernment has established common rules, procedures, and management systems for the \nschemes  to  harmonize  their  implementation.  It  has  created  the  National  Health  Insurance \nBureau, which manages and coordinates the existing health insurance programs, HEF, and free \nMNCH. The government will progressively increase the number of beneficiaries of social health \nprotection schemes and health insurance programs, which is the first step in moving towards \nproviding health insurance to 80% of the population, one of the targets of the HSRS. \n \n9.  Asian Development Bank value added in health sector. The midterm review of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) Strategy 2020 recommends expanding operations in the health \nsector to 3%\u20135% of ADB\u2019s annual approvals.8 ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132016, \nfor the Lao PDR includes support to public financial management in the health sector.9 The \nprogram is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2015\u20132017 for the Lao PDR, \nand is aligned with the operational plan for health, 2015\u20132020.10 ADB has supported health \nsystem development through several TA projects and programs focusing on governance and \npublic  financial  management.11 Previous  ADB  health  projects  and  programs  focused  on \ninfrastructure and staff capacity development in selected provinces, and helped to improve the \nhealth  facility  network  and  access  to  health  services  in  these  areas.  Those  interventions \ncontributed to (i) establishing health service standards, (ii) provincial planning and budgeting, \n(iii) increasing the recurrent budget, (iv) human resource development, (v) MNCH policies, and \n(vi) financial management; ADB also has supported the HSRS through policy advisory TA that \nhelped MOH develop a draft plan to implement health sector reforms.12 \n \n10.  Lessons.  Lessons  from  ADB  engagement  show  the  need  for  the  government  and \ndevelopment partners to develop and jointly finance national programs that focus on key health \nsystem constraints, rather than focusing on stand-alone projects. The design of the program will \nbuild on this previous work, informed by considerations of (i) alignment with government public \nsector  management  and  health  system  reform  priorities,  and  (ii)  support  to  sustain  ADB \nengagement on public sector management. \n \n11.  Development partner coordination. Major development partners in the health sector \nare the Global Fund for Malaria, AIDS, and Tuberculosis, the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency,  the  Luxembourg  Development  Agency,  the  World  Bank,  and  the  World  Health \nOrganization. The World Bank will support the HSRS through its Health, Governance, and \nNutrition Development Program, a $13.2 million credit and $13.2 million grant in the form of \nparallel collaborative cofinancing, not administered by ADB.13 It will coordinate with the program \nand  will  focus  on  health  service  delivery,  including  (i)  strengthening  the  district  health \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2014.

Key features of Health Sector Governance Program. The program is part of ADB\u2019s \nconsolidated support to the Lao PDR to help overcome major developmental challenges in the \nhealth sector and to lift health performance indicators as specified by the key MDGs targets. \nThe use of a programmatic approach with a policy-based loan providing budget support and a \nTA loan for capacity development included in subprogram 1 leverages a longer term policy \nreform program in the health sector at the national and subnational levels. The programmatic \napproach comprises two subprograms that facilitate a concerted policy dialogue on the basis of \nan agreed policy matrix related to key health governance reforms and sector priorities. It will \nprovide more effective and flexible ways to translate complex structural reform objectives into \nimplementable  policy  actions.  The  program  will  improve  the  targeting  accuracy  and  the \ncoverage  of  poor  families  benefitting  from  the  HEF  scheme,  increase  the  number  of \nbeneficiaries of the free MNCH scheme, and improve the financial management of the schemes \nto ensure value for money. The program focuses on chronologically sequenced reforms in line \nwith the HSRS implementation plan, which includes reforms to improve health-related human \nresource  management  and  overall  public  financial  management  of  the  health  sector.  The \nprogram  achieves  important  socio-economic  impacts. The first  is  the  improvement  in  poor \nfamilies access to healthcare through increased HEF scheme coverage. Second, improvement \nin public financial management will lead to gains from allocative efficiency. Third, improvement \nin human resources management will lead to better quality of health services. This should \ndirectly contribute to improve health outcomes. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The impact will be UHC achieved by 2025. The outcome will be improved delivery of \nhealth services, particularly for the poor, women, and children. Subprogram 1 contains 15 policy \nactions of which eight are triggers, all of which have been accomplished. Subprogram 2 will \ncontinue and deepen reforms and contain 17 policy actions of which 11 are triggers, to be \ncompleted by July 2018. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n14.  Output  1:  Health  sector  reform  process  improved.  Under  subprogram  1,  the \ngovernment has established the National Commission on Health Sector Reform chaired by the \nvice-prime minister. The commission will oversee reform progress and remove or resolve any \nimpediments to sustained implementation of reforms. The MOH has prepared a draft road map \nfor  HSRS  implementation  that  details  the  key  governance  and  public  sector  management \nreforms  required  to  strengthen  health  human  resource  and  health  system  financial \nmanagement. The draft road map also sets out the TA and capacity development needed to \ndesign and implement the health reforms. \n \n15.  Under subprogram 2, the government  will ensure that the National Commission on \nHealth  Sector  Reform  is  fully  resourced  and  continues  to  oversee  and  monitor  HSRS \nimplementation.  The  commission  will  approve  and  subsequently  monitor  annual  HSRS \nimplementation plans. The commission will approve the draft reform road map for strengthening \nhealth  human  resources  and  health  system  financial  management  and  establish  reform \nmonitoring mechanisms for 2015\u20132025. \n                                                \n14 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \n16.  Output 2: Implementation of the Health Equity Fund and free maternal, neonatal, \nand  child  health  care  schemes  improved.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  government  has \nexpanded the number of beneficiaries of HEF and free MNCH. By 2014, the HEF scheme \ncovers 43% of poor families. The free MNCH scheme had been initiated in 88 districts for \nmaternal care (out of a total of 146 districts). The MOH has harmonized the implementation \nguidelines for these social protection schemes. The National Health Insurance Bureau (under \nthe MOH Department of Finance) will administer, coordinate, and develop the existing insurance \nprogram and social health protection schemes. \n \n17.  Under subprogram 2, the government will further implement these critical service delivery \nreforms and ensure their sustainability. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will mobilize additional \nresources (government and official development assistance) to expand provision of free MNCH \nand HEF across the country. The target is that free MNCH services and HEF will be implemented \nin at least 131 districts by June 2018; by June 2019, HEF will cover 80% of poor families. The \nMOH will also undertake an impact assessment of the coverage, benefits, utilization, financial \nmanagement, and provider-payment mechanism of the two social protection schemes after 2 \nyears of program operation. The MOH will revise their implementation guidelines by July 2018 as \nappropriate. \n \n18.  Output 3: Human resource management capacity strengthened. Under subprogram \n1,  in  2014  the  government  increased  the  health  workforce  by  4,000  staff.  The  MOH  has \nimplemented a computerized provincial health personnel information system for better human \nresources management and planning. In recognition of the need for improved regulation of the \nhealth work force, the MOH has developed a competency framework for medical professions. \n \n19.  Under subprogram 2, the government will (i) improve the accuracy and enhance the \ncapacity of the personnel information system with respect to information on training, gender, and \nethnicity; and (ii) strengthen the capacity of the PHOs to use the information for management \ndecision making. Each PHO will formulate and implement provincial workforce development \nplans designed to guide the training and deployment of staff in remote and hard-to-reach areas. \nIn addition, the government, through the MOH, will issue appropriate decree(s) defining (i) a \nlicensing  and  registration  process  for  health  professionals,  including  private  sector  health \nproviders; and (ii) requirements for maintaining registration and accreditation. \n \n20.  Output  4:  Health  sector  financial  management  system  strengthened.  Under \nsubprogram 1, the MOH has developed staff capacity to adopt multiyear budgeting and a \nmultiyear budget framework in preparation for implementation across the health sector. The \nMOH has issued implementation guidelines for Prime Minister Decree 349 that regulates use \nand accounting of health facility user fees. To improve information on mobilization and allocation \nof financial resources to the health sector, the MOH has produced and published NHAs for \nFY2011 and FY2012. To ensure timely and adequate allocation of funds to the PHOs and MOH \ndepartments, the MOF and the MOH are establishing a mechanism for adequate allocation and \ntimely funding of free MNCH and HEF schemes, and of health service delivery. \n \n21.  For subprogram 2, the government, through the MOH, will adopt a system to monitor the \nsource and application of funds at the health facility level; implementation will initially focus on \ndistrict  and  provincial  hospitals.  The  MOH  will  also  establish  a  budget  expenditure  and \ndisbursement  monitoring  system  to  document  annual  and  quarterly  expenditures  and \ndisbursement of provincial and central-level health department budgets. To improve decision \nmaking and transparency, the MOH will establish a new system for budgeting and monitoring \ndevelopment budget expenditures, including for all aid-financed projects. The MOH will also \n ", "6 \ninstitutionalize the production, publication, and distribution of NHAs for FY2013 and FY2014. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n22.  To  support  its  reform  initiatives,  the  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR12,204,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance \nsubprogram 1. The loan will have a 24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an \ninterest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and \nsuch other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.  \n \n23.  The loan amount for subprogram 1 takes into account the Lao PDR\u2019s increased fiscal \nspace constraints and financing needs for development expenditure programs.15  The size of \nthe loan is based on the costs incurred by the government in  implementing reforms. The \ngovernment will use the local currency counterpart funds generated from this policy-based loan \nto support full implementation of the policy actions contained in the policy matrix and to ensure \nsustainability of the health reforms, with a focus on public financing for HEF and free MNCH \nschemes, health human resource management, and financial management improvements.16 \nPara. 28 summarizes expected costs and benefits of the reforms, and the program impact \nassessment provides details. 17 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n24.  The executing agency for the program will be the MOH, Department of Planning and \nInternational  Cooperation,  which  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall  coordination  and \ndisbursement  of  resources  under  the  programmatic  approach.  The  MOH  departments  of \nFinance, Training and Research, and Personnel, and the 18 provincial health departments will \nbe the implementing agencies. As the executing agency, the MOH will be responsible for the \noverall implementation of subprogram 1 including disbursements, maintenance of all program \nrecords,  and  communicating  with  ADB  on  behalf  of  the  government.  The  MOH  steering \ncommittee, chaired by the minister of health and comprising vice ministers and representatives \nof MOH departments including the cabinet (which is responsible for oversight of health sector \nreform implementation) will provide overall guidance on program implementation. \n \n25.  Tranches,  disbursement,  and  counterpart  funds.  The  policy-based  loan  for \nsubprogram 1 will be provided in a single tranche and the proceeds may be withdrawn upon \nloan  effectiveness.  The  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nsimplified disbursement procedures for policy-based loans.18 The loan proceeds will be used to \nfinance the foreign exchange cost of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, \nexcluding items included in a list of ineligible items, and imports financed by other bilateral and \nmultilateral sources.19 The implementation period of subprogram 1 is August 2013\u2013July 2015. \nThe loan closing date is 31 March 2016.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \n \n26.  The  government  has  requested  a  TA  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR4,307,000  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund)  to  be \nimplemented over 3 years to support the initial design and implementation of the reforms \nidentified under subprogram 2.20 The TA is estimated to cost $6.25 million, of which ADB will \nfinance $6 million equivalent for consulting services, goods, including applicable taxes, duties, \nand bank charges, as well as project management support expenses. The TA loan will have a \n32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft TA loan agreement. The government will provide $0.25 million equivalent through in-\nkind contributions (counterpart staff and various facilities).

The TA loan will support the program outputs. Under output 1, the TA loan will assist the \ncabinet to plan and to monitor the progress and effectiveness of the health sector reform. Under \noutput 2, the TA loan will support the MOH and the PHOs to implement, monitor, and evaluate \nthe HEF and free MNCH schemes.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n28.  Subprogram  1  will  generate  economic  gains  through  successful  implementation  of \nmedium-term  policy  actions,  as  described  in  the  Summary  Program  Impact  Assessment \n(footnote 17). There should be significant gains through improved allocative efficiency, and \nincreased government budget allocations to health that are expected to provide higher rates of \nsocioeconomic return than most other potential uses of budgetary resources. The potential \nbenefits include (i) removal of financial barriers to health service access as a consequence of \nnational implementation of the HEF and MNCH schemes; and (ii) improved quality of services \nresulting from (a) better distribution of key staff through the health system; and (b) an improved \nnonsalary budget, which will enable improved outreach and better-quality facilities to support the \nhealth services provided. The policy costs to the government are conservatively estimated as a \nlump sum of $141 million. The costs of the reforms estimated are primarily (i) the short to \nmedium-term costs to the government of administering and enforcing reforms ($12 million); and \n(ii) the direct fiscal costs of selected reforms, including the costs of service delivery reforms \nimplementation, in concert with governance and public sector management reforms designed to \nensure improved service delivery ($129 million).22 \n                                                \n21 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Including the expansion of the workforce by 4,000 ($60 million), additional administrative staff in the provinces ($3 \nmillion), implementation of free MNCH and HEF schemes ($33 million), and sustained, improved service quality \n($33 million). \n ", "9 \nB.  Governance \n \n29.  The overall assessment of fiduciary risk, including for the health sector in the Lao PDR, \nhas been assessed as high to medium, due mainly to (i) insufficient control over revenue \ncollected and expenditures undertaken by provincial governments; (ii) inadequate resources \nand  capacity  of  state  audit  organizations,  which  undermines  the  independence  and \neffectiveness  of  oversight  institutions;  (iii)  a  weak  procurement  framework,  and  lack  of \nregulations  for  implementation;  (iv)  corruption  (the  United  Nations  Convention  Against \nCorruption is insufficient as a deterrent); and (v) lack of effectiveness of the Inspection Authority. \nTo  address  these  risks,  the  government  has  (i)  set  out  the  law,  implementing  decree, \nframework,  and  timetable  for  improving  budgetary  management;  (ii)  strengthened  the \nindependence and capacity of the state audit organization; (iii) issued a new procurement \ndecree and implementing rules and regulations, a standard procurement manual, and standard \nbidding documents; and (iv) adopted the Law on Anti-Corruption, Law on State Inspection, and \nLaw on Complaints and State Audit. The TA loan will provide support for the introduction and \ndevelopment of results-based planning, budgeting, financial management systems, reporting, \nand verification as part of health sector reform at national and subnational levels. \n \n30.  The  ADB  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with the government and the MOH, who are familiar with it. The government Anti-\nCorruption  Unit  has made  some  progress  but faces  challenges  with  regard  to  operational \neffectiveness, carrying out anticorruption activities, and implementing the Anti-Corruption Law \nsystematically.  The program will support specific human resource and planning, budgeting, and \nexpenditure-monitoring reforms that will improve information and the transparency of finance \nand human resource allocations within the health sector. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 21). \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n31.  The reforms supported by the program are expected to lower the incidence of poverty, \nparticularly among women and children, by expanding the provision of free health services for \nthe poor and free MNCH services. In addition, financial and human resource management \nreforms will increase deployment of health staff to remote areas with the greatest needs in \nsupport of quality service delivery. The program will support gender and equity policies to (i) \nensure access by poor women to the HEF, and (ii) promote recruitment and retention of female \nand ethnic group staff in remote and disadvantaged rural areas. It is classified as gender equity. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n32.  The program is expected to have no environmental impact and will not include new land \nacquisition. Therefore, it is classified category C for environment and involuntary resettlement \nsafeguards. A resettlement framework has been prepared to screen program activities that \nwould  cause  involuntary  resettlement  impacts,  including  temporary  land  acquisition  and/or \neconomic  displacement  of  people.  Similarly,  an  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework includes a checklist to exclude activities with negative environment impacts. The \nprogram includes positive impacts on ethnic groups and is classified category B for indigenous \npeoples. An indigenous peoples planning framework ensures that (i) ethnic peoples\u2019 needs will \nbe analyzed, and (ii) ethnic peoples will fully participate in the project and have equal access to \nits benefits. A matrix of the potential impacts of each policy action on indigenous people, \ntogether with appropriate mitigation measures, has been prepared. \n \n ", "10 \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n33.  The risk for subprogram 1 is assessed as medium. Major risks include macroeconomic \nimbalances, poor public financial management and accountability mechanisms, limited capacity \nfor public procurement, and corruption. Responsibilities of MOH departments and the PHOs are \noverlapping and MOH has limited capacity to implement the reforms at all levels. The capacity \nwithin the MOF and sector ministries to prepare budgets is not yet fully developed, and the \nbudget\u2013policy linkage is weak. The MOH, and the government more generally, have shown \nsignificant commitment to health sector reform through the development of the HSRS and the \nprogram. An ADB-funded project supports the MOF and other line ministries in budget planning \nand in improving the intergovernmental fiscal transfer systems. The program will strengthen key \npublic  finance  management  systems  within  MOH,  including  planning  and  budgeting.  The \nintegrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs of the program. Major risks \nand mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management \nplan.23  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n34.  The government and the MOH have assured ADB that implementation of the program \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and the loan agreements. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n35.
