THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \ngrant; (ii) the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the European Union (EU);1 \nand  (iii)  the  proposed  administration  of  a  grant  to  be  provided  by  the  Second  Danish \nCooperation  Fund  for  Renewable  Energy  and  Energy  Efficiency  for  Rural  Areas \n(SDCFREEERA),2 all to the Kingdom of Tonga for the additional financing of the Outer Island \nRenewable Energy Project.3 \n \n2.  The proposed additional financing will support the scaling up of the current project by (i) \nupgrading the existing power distribution grid in the islands of Vava\u2019u and 'Eua, which will result \nin additional savings of about 0.12 million liters of diesel per year; and (ii) expanding the project \nmanagement support services, including assistance for procurement of solar power generation \nassets and power distribution networks. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Tonga is a kingdom of 177 islands divided into five island groups\u2014'Eua, Ha'apai, Niuas, \nTongatapu and Vava'u. Its 103,000 people inhabit about 36 of these islands. The peak demand \nof the four Tonga Power Limited (TPL)4 grids in 2014 was about 9.7 megawatts, and yearly \ndemand totaled about 55 gigawatt-hours. An estimated 13 million liters of diesel was consumed \nto generate this electricity at a cost that was equivalent to about 10% of the year\u2019s total gross \ndomestic product and about 15% of the value of total 2014 imports. Peak demand is expected \nto increase to 17.2 megawatts by 2020. Petroleum dependency makes Tonga highly vulnerable \nto oil price shocks, which affect the affordability of food, goods, electricity, and transport. \n \n4.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the current Outer Island Renewable \nEnergy Project on 27 June 2013 to reduce Tonga\u2019s dependence on imported fossil fuel for \npower generation and give consumers greater access at a reduced cost to electricity generated \nby solar power. The original project plans were to (i) construct and install solar power systems \nwith a total capacity of 1.25 megawatt-peak (MWp) on nine of Tonga\u2019s outer islands, (ii) provide \noperation and maintenance (O&M) trainings including a program manual for O&M of solar \ngeneration and distribution systems to the implementing agencies for up to 5 years after plant \ncommissioning, and (iii) help the implementing agencies implement the project efficiently by \nrecruiting the project management consultant (PMC).  \n \n5.  Due to the recent changes of the technical environment of a few subproject areas, minor \nchanges in the current project were approved in June 2015. These are expected to increase the \ntotal  capacity  of  the  current  project  to  about  1.32  MWp  and  optimize  each  project  cost \ncomponent. The changes took into consideration (i) the latest solar photovoltaic module cost \ntrends, (ii) an increase of the estimated potential consumers on islands of Ha\u2019afeva and \u2018Uiha, \n                                                \n1  Through the European Commission. \n2  The concurrence from the Government of Denmark was received in the first quarter of 2013. \n3  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. ADB. 2013. Report and Recommendation of the President \nto the Board of Directors: Proposed Grant and Administration of Grant for to the Kingdom of Tonga for the Outer \nIsland Renewable Energy Project. Manila. \n4  TPL is a vertically integrated government-owned public enterprise under the oversight of the Ministry of Public \nEnterprises and the government\u2019s cabinet. ", "2 \n \n(iii) the  lack of a proper grid network on Niuatoputapu, and (iv) a mismatch between the current \npeak demand and the proposed solar power generation on Vava\u2019u. \n \n6.  The current project has encountered implementation delays for a variety of reasons, \nincluding damage caused by the most powerful storm ever recorded in Tonga.5 Following the \ndevastation caused when Cyclone Ian passed directly over the northeast islands of Ha\u2019apai in \nJanuary 2014, the government requested a temporary suspension of project activities so that it \ncould focus on emergency assistance needed  to reconstruct and strengthen the electricity \nnetwork and school facilities on the island group.6  \n \n7.  After ADB approved the Cyclone Ian Recovery Project in May 2014, activities on the \ncurrent Outer Island Renewable Energy Project resumed. The grants were declared effective in \nJune 2014. The PMC was mobilized in June 2014 and recommended in the January 2015 \nthrough the inception report that the original single large turnkey contract be split into two \nsmaller turnkey contracts that would better suit existing market conditions.7 One of these\u2014the \nturnkey package for the grid-connected solar photovoltaic plants\u2014was advertised on 22 May \n2015 as planned, and the fourth quarter of 2015 was set as the target for contract award. \n \n8.  Despite the delays, the progress made on project implementation since effectiveness \nhas been satisfactory overall. The project currently faces no major risks to a successful delivery \nof its expected outputs or to keeping to its revised implementation schedule. As of July 2015, \nthe project was classified as performing well.8 Project performance and associated issues are \ndescribed in more detail in the summary of project performance.9 \n \n9.  To maximize the distribution of electricity from the solar power systems to be installed \nunder the current project, the government has asked ADB for a grant of $1.44 million from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources10 to help it upgrade the existing power distribution grids of \u2018Eua \nand Vava\u2019u. To expand the scale of the current project and deliver greater benefits by reducing \npower distribution losses, the EU has agreed to provide a grant not exceeding \u20ac3.00 million \n                                                \n5  Cyclone Ian was a category 5 system, with winds of more than 200 kilometers per hour and gusts of about 300 \nkilometers per hour. About 5,000 people were directly affected\u201466% of Ha\u2019apai\u2019s population. According to TPL, \nthe cyclone damaged 90% of the Ha\u2019apai power network\u2019s distribution lines, 40% of the high-voltage poles, 70% of \nthe low-voltage poles, 65% of the transformers, 90% of the transformer structures, one of the two generators, and \n95% of the streetlights. \n6  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2014. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: \nProposed Grant and Administration of Grant for to the Kingdom of Tonga Cyclone Ian Recovery Project. Manila. \nOverall progress of rehabilitating the electricity network on Ha\u2019apai has been satisfactory. \n7  The original single turnkey package was divided into two separate turnkey packages: one for the grid-connected \nsolar photovoltaic plants and one for both mini and off-grid solar systems. This allowed TPL to begin the design \nwork and tendering process for the on-grid system while a more sustainable O&M mechanism for the mini and off-\ngrid systems was still being developed. The draft O&M report for the mini and off-grid systems was submitted by \nthe Government of Australia to the Government of Tonga on 22 June 2015. \n8  The current project was rated on track in quarters 3 and 4 2014 under ADB\u2019s project performance rating system \n(PPR) after effectiveness in June of that year. However, the rating was changed to potential problem in Q1 2015, \nand to actual problem in Q2 2015. Primarily, this was because the division of the single turnkey contract into two \nsmaller turnkey contracts had not been reflected in the current projected timelines for contract awards and \ndisbursements in the PPR. As of July 2015, the current project was classified as on track by the PPR. \n9  Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n10 A country's eligibility for Asian Development Fund (Special Fund resources) grants under ADB\u2019s  revised grant \nframework is determined by its risk of debt distress. The latest debt sustainability analysis in 2014 determined that \nTonga had a high risk of debt distress and was therefore eligible to receive 100% of its Asian Development Fund \nallocation as grants. ", "    3 \n \n($3.57 million), 11 and the SDCFREEERA has approved a grant of $750,000. Both grants will be \nfully administered by ADB as part of overall project administration. \n \n10.  TPL is solely responsible for providing grid-connected electricity services in Tonga. It \nhas concessions to operate four independent grids\u2014the largest, which is on the main island of \nTongatapu, and three smaller grids on the main islands of the \u2018Eua, Ha\u2019apai, and Vava`u island \ngroups. TPL generates, distributes, and retails electricity, and provides O&M services.  \n \n11.  The power distribution system is the part of the electricity supply chain and requires \nconsiderable investment and O&M efforts. Power distribution assets typically represent 20%\u2013\n30% of the required power system investments in electricity industries worldwide, but this figure \nrises to about 42% for TPL. The standard losses in rural power distribution networks are \ngenerally about 5%, and yet the rate is more than twice as high in Tonga (around 13%). Greater \nlosses mean that more fuel is consumed in power generation, which makes improving the \nefficiency  of  the  country\u2019s  power  system  a  matter  of  interest  for  both  TPL  and  Tonga\u2019s \nconsumers. \n \n12.  The additional financing for the Outer Island Renewable Energy Project will allow Tonga \nto reduce power distribution losses and fuel consumption while delivering the same amount of \nelectricity to consumers. This will be achieved by rehabilitating grid assets\u2014i.e., cables, poles, \ndistribution transformers, and switchgears. It will result in additional savings of about 0.12 million \nliters of diesel per year.  \n \n13.  The current project meets all the eligibility criteria for additional financing. The overall \nproject will remain technically, financially, and economically viable with the additional financing \ncomponent. The safeguards categorization of the overall project will also remain unchanged. \nThe additional financing component will enhance the current project\u2019s original design and add \neffective support for its development of the solar photovoltaic plants\u2014one of the government\u2019s \nkey priorities. The additional financing component will enhance the outcome and impact of the \nproject, as well as ADB\u2019s contribution to power sector development in Tonga. \n \n14.  The additional financing is in line with the objectives of ADB\u2019s 2009 Energy Policy to \npromote energy efficiency and renewable energy; provide access to energy for all; and support \nreform, capacity building, and improved governance in the energy sector.12 It is included in \nADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Tonga for 2015\u20132017,13 which makes energy a \npriority area of support. A primary goal of the plan is to reduce the country\u2019s dependence on \nimported fossil fuels through energy efficiency and conservation operations, including support \nfor power generation from renewable energy sources. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n15.  The impact and outcome of the overall project will remain unchanged with the additional \nfinancing. The intended impact will remain the reduction of Tonga\u2019s dependence on imported \nfossil fuel for power generation. The outcome of the overall project will be the optimization of on-\n                                                \n11 A contribution agreement between ADB and the EU was concluded on 24 December 2014. The grants from the EU \nwill be denominated in US dollars pursuant to ADB\u2019s standard accounting practices (at the exchange rate as of 7 \nJanuary 2015). The dollar equivalent amounts may be adjusted for currency fluctuations to match the grant \namounts received by ADB. \n12 ADB. 2009. Energy Policy. Manila. \n13 ADB. 2014.

The intended output 1 under the current project is the construction and installation of \nsolar  power systems  with  a total  capacity  of  1.32  MWp on  nine  outer  islands.  Under  the \nadditional financing, output 1 of the overall project will expand to include rehabilitation by TPL of \nthe existing grid network near the solar power generation systems on the islands of 'Eua and \nVava\u2019u by replacing cables, poles, distribution transformers, switchgears, and other equipment.  \nThe  original  second  output\u2014O&M  knowledge  transferred  through  training\u2014as  well  as  the \nthird\u2014efficient management and implement of the project\u2014will remain unchanged with the \nadditional financing.  \n \nD.

ADB  and  the \nimplementing  agency  quantified  the  equipment  necessary  for  the  network  refurbishment, \nassessed the grid condition, and calculated the potential reduction in grid power losses. The ", "    7 \n \nequipment will incorporate adequate climate-proofing measures to increase resilience to climate \nand disaster risks throughout the project life cycle. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n22.  The proposed power distribution network to be funded by the additional financing is \nconsidered financially viable because the estimated financial internal rate of return of (4.45%) is \ngreater than the weighted average cost of capital (3.46%). The additional financing is also \nconsidered economically viable, since the estimated economic internal rate of return (12.07%) is \ngreater than the economic discount rate of 12.00%. The financial internal rate of return for the \noverall project with the additional financing is estimated at 7.02%,19 and the estimated economic \ninternal rate of return is 14.13%. The overall project remained financially and economically \nfeasible under several adverse scenarios during sensitivity testing.  \n \nC.  Governance \n23.  Financial  management.  To  facilitate  cash  flow  during  project  implementation,  the \nMFNP,  as  the  executing  agency,  will  approve  withdrawal  applications  from  the  project \nmanagement unit and submit them to ADB for direct payment for all project goods, works, and \nconsultancy services. A public financial management performance assessment concluded that \nTonga\u2019s public financial management system is based on a solid legal and regulatory framework \nand underpinned by a set of well-established expenditure control procedures that cover wages \nand salaries, nonsalary items, and procurement.20 \n \n24.  Procurement. The PMC has assisted the implementing agencies in procuring all project \ngoods, works, and services under the current project.21 Procurement of goods, works, and \nrelated services under the additional financing project will be carried out by TPL, in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). In addition to the \nnational  competitive  bidding  and  shopping  methods,  direct  contracting  and  force  account \nmethods will be used for some packages to be funded by the additional financing. The use of \nboth methods has been justified based on ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines.22 \n \n25.  Advance  contracting  for  some  packages  using  national  competitive  bidding  and \nshopping methods will be undertaken in conformity with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. The \nexecuting agency and implementing agencies have been advised that approval of advance \ncontracting does not commit ADB to finance the project. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and the MFNP. The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n   \n                                                \n19 The weighted average cost of capital for the overall project was calculated to be 3.68%. \n20 Government of Tonga. 2010. Public Financial Management Performance Report. Nuku\u2019alofa. \n21 The existing PMC contract will be extended and funded by the additional financing. \n22 The guidelines state in paras. 3.6\u20133.8 that for direct contracting, (i) no better offer is likely to be received, and that \nthe price to be paid is not more than the original price; and (ii) standardization of equipment or spare parts, to be \ncompatible  with  existing  equipment,  may  justify  additional  purchases  from  the  original  supplier.  Under  the \nguidelines, the use of force account can be justified when (i) quantities of work involved cannot be defined in \nadvance; (ii) works are small and scattered or in remote locations and qualified construction firms are unlikely to bid \non them at reasonable prices;(iii) work is required to be carried out without disrupting ongoing operations; and (iv) \nthe risks of unavoidable work interruption are better borne by the recipient or implementing agency than by a \ncontractor. ", "8 \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n26.  The current project is expected to have a positive social impact by helping to ease air \npollution. By reducing the use of diesel fuel for power generation, it will avoid what would have \nbeen a significant amount of damaging emissions each year. The additional financing will help \nthe current project achieve the targeted social benefits by reducing high losses during power \ndistribution, which in turn will lower the diesel fuel consumed by generation while delivering the \nsame end amount of electricity to consumers. The overall project is expected to offer new \nemployment and income opportunities for local unskilled and semiskilled workers in the project \nareas and to support education by making it possible for local students to study by electric light \nat night. \n \n27.  The current project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. The majority of its \noutputs have specific gender design features to ensure that women participate in the project \nand have access to project benefits. The overall project will actively promote the involvement of \nwomen in all its employment and training opportunities.23 Under ADB\u2019s Cyclone Ian Recovery \nProject, TPL has established a track record of successfully employing new female trainee line \npersons who have received intensive instruction in field work. This has been done to achieve a \ngreater balance in gender representation on the project\u2019s installation work force. TPL plans to \nbring its six women and two men trainees currently working on Ha\u2019apai under the Cyclone Ian \nRecovery Project to the sites where the project work to be funded by the additional financing is \nto be carried out. This may create opportunities for long-term employment for these trainees. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n28.  Environment. The two areas to be affected by activities under the additional financing \nare classified as category B for environment. Initial environmental examinations were prepared \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). No significant environmental \nimpacts will result from the implementation of the overall project. \n \n29.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The additional financing project is \nclassified as category C for both involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The activities \nunder the additional financing component will use the right-of-way on a government reserve \noccupied by the existing power distribution network owned by TPL and community electric \ncooperatives. It is therefore not expected to involve land acquisition or displacement of people \nor physical structures. No third party or persons will be adversely affected. No distinct and \nvulnerable  indigenous  peoples  as  defined  under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  are \nexpected to be affected by the overall project. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n30.  No significant issues are expected to arise in implementing the overall project. Key risks \nand mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management \nplan.24 \n   \n                                                \n23 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "    9 \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n31.  The government, the MFNP, and TPL have assured ADB that implementation of the \nadditional financing shall conform to all applicable ADB policies and procedures, including those \nconcerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the PAM and the grant and project agreements. \n \n32.  The government, the MFNP, and TPL have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for \nthe project, which are set forth in the grant and project agreements. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n33.
