Its 103,000 people inhabit about 36 of these islands. The peak demand \nof  the  four  Tonga  Power  Limited  (TPL)4 grids  in  2014  was  about  9.7  megawatts,  and  yearly \ndemand totaled about 55 gigawatt-hours. An estimated 13 million liters of diesel was consumed \nto generate this electricity at a cost that was equivalent to about 10% of the year\u2019s total gross \ndomestic product and about 15% of the value of total 2014 imports. Peak demand is expected \nto increase to 17.2 megawatts by 2020. Petroleum dependency makes Tonga highly vulnerable \nto oil price shocks, which affect the affordability of food, goods, electricity, and transport. \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  the  current  Outer  Island  Renewable \n4. \nEnergy  Project  on  27  June  2013  to  reduce  Tonga\u2019s  dependence  on  imported  fossil  fuel  for \npower generation and give consumers greater access at a reduced cost to electricity generated \nby solar power. The original project plans were to (i) construct and install solar power systems \nwith a total capacity of 1.25 megawatt-peak (MWp) on nine of Tonga\u2019s outer islands, (ii) provide \noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  trainings  including  a  program  manual  for  O&M  of  solar \ngeneration  and  distribution  systems  to the  implementing agencies  for  up to  5  years  after  plant \ncommissioning,  and  (iii)  help  the  implementing  agencies  implement  the  project  efficiently  by \nrecruiting the project management consultant (PMC).  \n \n5. \nDue to the recent changes of the technical environment of a few subproject areas, minor \nchanges in the current project were approved in June 2015. These are expected to increase the \ntotal  capacity  of  the  current  project  to  about  1.32  MWp  and  optimize  each  project  cost \ncomponent.  The  changes  took  into  consideration  (i)  the  latest  solar  photovoltaic  module  cost \ntrends, (ii) an increase of the estimated potential consumers on islands of Ha\u2019afeva and \u2018Uiha, \n\n                                                \n1  Through the European Commission. \n2  The concurrence from the Government of Denmark was received in the first quarter of 2013. \n3  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. ADB. 2013. Report and Recommendation of the President \nto the Board of Directors: Proposed Grant and Administration of Grant for to the Kingdom of Tonga for the Outer \nIsland Renewable Energy Project. Manila. \n\n4  TPL  is  a  vertically  integrated  government-owned  public  enterprise  under  the  oversight  of  the  Ministry  of  Public \n\nEnterprises and the government\u2019s cabinet. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n(iii) the  lack of a proper grid network on Niuatoputapu, and (iv) a mismatch between the current \npeak demand and the proposed solar power generation on Vava\u2019u. \n \n6. \nThe  current  project  has  encountered  implementation  delays  for  a  variety  of  reasons, \nincluding  damage  caused  by  the  most  powerful  storm  ever  recorded  in  Tonga.5 Following  the \ndevastation caused when Cyclone Ian passed directly over the northeast islands of Ha\u2019apai in \nJanuary 2014, the government requested a temporary suspension of project activities so that it \ncould  focus  on  emergency  assistance  needed  to  reconstruct  and  strengthen  the  electricity \nnetwork and school facilities on the island group.6  \n \n7. \nAfter  ADB  approved  the  Cyclone  Ian  Recovery  Project  in  May  2014,  activities  on  the \ncurrent Outer Island Renewable Energy Project resumed. The grants were declared effective in \nJune  2014.  The  PMC  was  mobilized  in  June  2014  and  recommended  in  the  January  2015 \nthrough  the  inception  report  that  the  original  single  large  turnkey  contract  be  split  into  two \nsmaller  turnkey  contracts  that  would better  suit existing  market conditions.7 One  of  these\u2014the \nturnkey  package  for  the  grid-connected  solar  photovoltaic  plants\u2014was  advertised  on  22  May \n2015 as planned, and the fourth quarter of 2015 was set as the target for contract award. \n \n8. \nDespite  the  delays,  the  progress  made  on  project  implementation  since  effectiveness \nhas been satisfactory overall. The project currently faces no major risks to a successful delivery \nof  its  expected  outputs  or  to  keeping  to  its  revised  implementation  schedule.  As  of  July  2015, \nthe  project  was  classified  as  performing  well.8 Project  performance  and  associated  issues  are \ndescribed in more detail in the summary of project performance.9 \n \nTo  maximize  the  distribution  of  electricity  from  the  solar  power  systems  to  be  installed \n9. \nunder  the  current  project,  the  government  has  asked  ADB  for  a  grant  of  $1.44  million  from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources10 to help it upgrade the existing power distribution grids of \u2018Eua \nand Vava\u2019u. To expand the scale of the current project and deliver greater benefits by reducing \npower  distribution  losses,  the  EU  has  agreed  to  provide  a  grant  not  exceeding  \u20ac3.00  million \n\n                                                \n5  Cyclone  Ian  was  a  category  5  system,  with  winds  of more  than  200 kilometers  per  hour and  gusts  of  about 300 \nkilometers  per  hour.  About  5,000  people  were  directly  affected\u201466%  of  Ha\u2019apai\u2019s  population.  According  to  TPL, \nthe cyclone damaged 90% of the Ha\u2019apai power network\u2019s distribution lines, 40% of the high-voltage poles, 70% of \nthe low-voltage poles, 65% of the transformers, 90% of the transformer structures, one of the two generators, and \n95% of the streetlights. \n\n6  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2014.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors: \nProposed Grant and Administration of Grant for to the Kingdom of Tonga Cyclone Ian Recovery Project. Manila. \nOverall progress of rehabilitating the electricity network on Ha\u2019apai has been satisfactory. \n\n7  The original single turnkey package  was divided  into two separate turnkey packages: one for the grid-connected \nsolar  photovoltaic  plants  and one  for  both mini  and off-grid  solar systems.  This  allowed TPL  to  begin the design \nwork and tendering process for the on-grid system while a more sustainable O&M mechanism for the mini and off-\ngrid systems was still being developed. The draft O&M report for the mini and off-grid systems was submitted by \nthe Government of Australia to the Government of Tonga on 22 June 2015. \n\n8  The current project  was rated  on track  in quarters 3 and 4 2014 under ADB\u2019s project performance rating system \n(PPR) after effectiveness in June of that year. However, the rating was changed to potential problem in Q1 2015, \nand to actual problem in Q2 2015. Primarily, this was because the division of the single turnkey contract into two \nsmaller  turnkey  contracts  had  not  been  reflected  in  the  current  projected  timelines  for  contract  awards  and \ndisbursements in the PPR. As of July 2015, the current project was classified as on track by the PPR. \n\n9  Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n10 A  country's  eligibility  for  Asian  Development  Fund  (Special  Fund  resources)  grants  under  ADB\u2019s    revised  grant \nframework is determined by its risk of debt distress. The latest debt sustainability analysis in 2014 determined that \nTonga had a high risk of debt distress and was therefore eligible to receive  100% of its Asian Development Fund \nallocation as grants. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n3 \n\n($3.57 million), 11 and the SDCFREEERA has approved a grant of $750,000. Both grants will be \nfully administered by ADB as part of overall project administration. \n \n10. \nTPL  is  solely  responsible  for  providing  grid-connected  electricity  services  in  Tonga.  It \nhas concessions to operate four independent grids\u2014the largest, which is on the main island of \nTongatapu, and three smaller grids on the main islands of the \u2018Eua, Ha\u2019apai, and Vava`u island \ngroups. TPL generates, distributes, and retails electricity, and provides O&M services.  \n \nThe  power  distribution  system  is  the  part  of  the  electricity  supply  chain  and  requires \n11. \nconsiderable  investment  and  O&M  efforts.  Power  distribution  assets  typically  represent  20%\u2013\n30% of the required power system investments in electricity industries worldwide, but this figure \nrises  to  about  42%  for  TPL.  The  standard  losses  in  rural  power  distribution  networks  are \ngenerally about 5%, and yet the rate is more than twice as high in Tonga (around 13%). Greater \nlosses  mean  that  more  fuel  is  consumed  in  power  generation,  which  makes  improving  the \nefficiency  of  the  country\u2019s  power  system  a  matter  of  interest  for  both  TPL  and  Tonga\u2019s \nconsumers. \n \n12. \nThe additional financing for the Outer Island Renewable Energy Project will allow Tonga \nto reduce power distribution losses and fuel consumption while delivering the same amount  of \nelectricity to consumers. This will be achieved by rehabilitating grid assets\u2014i.e., cables, poles, \ndistribution transformers, and switchgears. It will result in additional savings of about 0.12 million \nliters of diesel per year.  \n \n13. \nThe  current  project  meets  all  the  eligibility  criteria  for  additional  financing.  The  overall \nproject will remain technically, financially, and economically viable with the additional financing \ncomponent.  The  safeguards  categorization  of  the  overall  project  will  also  remain  unchanged. \nThe  additional  financing  component  will  enhance  the  current  project\u2019s  original  design  and  add \neffective support for its development of the solar photovoltaic plants\u2014one of the government\u2019s \nkey priorities. The additional financing component will enhance the  outcome and impact of the \nproject, as well as ADB\u2019s contribution to power sector development in Tonga. \n \n14. \nThe  additional  financing  is  in  line  with  the  objectives  of  ADB\u2019s  2009  Energy  Policy  to \npromote energy efficiency and renewable energy; provide access to energy for all; and support \nreform,  capacity  building,  and  improved  governance  in  the  energy  sector.12 It  is  included  in \nADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan  for  Tonga  for  2015\u20132017,13 which  makes  energy  a \npriority  area  of  support.  A  primary  goal  of  the  plan  is  to  reduce  the  country\u2019s  dependence  on \nimported  fossil  fuels  through  energy  efficiency  and  conservation  operations,  including  support \nfor power generation from renewable energy sources. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n15. \nThe impact and outcome of the overall project will remain unchanged with the additional \nfinancing.  The  intended  impact  will  remain  the  reduction  of  Tonga\u2019s  dependence  on  imported \nfossil fuel for power generation. The outcome of the overall project will be the optimization of on-\n\n                                                \n11 A contribution agreement between ADB and the EU was concluded on 24 December 2014. The grants from the EU \nwill be denominated in US dollars pursuant to ADB\u2019s standard accounting practices  (at the exchange rate as of 7 \nJanuary  2015).

The selection of equipment \nhas been carefully analyzed based on best engineering practices. The equipment is specifically \nconceived  for  hard  marine  environments  and  remote  island  conditions.  ADB  and  the \nimplementing  agency  quantified  the  equipment  necessary  for  the  network  refurbishment, \nassessed  the  grid  condition,  and  calculated  the  potential  reduction  in  grid  power  losses.  The \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n7 \n\nequipment will incorporate adequate climate-proofing measures to increase resilience to climate \nand disaster risks throughout the project life cycle. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n22. \nThe  proposed  power  distribution  network  to  be  funded  by  the  additional  financing  is \nconsidered financially viable because the estimated financial internal rate of return of (4.45%) is \ngreater  than  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (3.46%).  The  additional  financing  is  also \nconsidered economically viable, since the estimated economic internal rate of return (12.07%) is \ngreater than the economic discount rate of 12.00%. The financial internal rate of return for the \noverall project with the additional financing is estimated at 7.02%,19 and the estimated economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  is  14.13%.  The  overall  project  remained  financially  and  economically \nfeasible under several adverse scenarios during sensitivity testing.  \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n23. \nFinancial  management.  To  facilitate  cash  flow  during  project  implementation,  the \nMFNP,  as  the  executing  agency,  will  approve  withdrawal  applications  from  the  project \nmanagement unit and submit them to ADB for direct payment for all project goods, works, and \nconsultancy  services.  A public financial  management  performance  assessment  concluded that \nTonga\u2019s public financial management system is based on a solid legal and regulatory framework \nand underpinned by a set of well-established expenditure control procedures that cover wages \nand salaries, nonsalary items, and procurement.20 \n \nProcurement. The PMC has assisted the implementing agencies in procuring all project \n24. \ngoods,  works,  and  services  under  the  current  project. 21 Procurement  of  goods,  works,  and \nrelated services under the additional financing project will be carried out by TPL, in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  In  addition  to  the \nnational  competitive  bidding  and  shopping  methods,  direct  contracting  and  force  account \nmethods  will  be  used for  some packages  to  be funded by  the  additional financing.  The  use  of \nboth methods has been justified based on ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines.22 \n \nAdvance  contracting  for  some  packages  using  national  competitive  bidding  and \n25. \nshopping  methods  will  be  undertaken  in  conformity  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  The \nexecuting  agency  and  implementing  agencies  have  been  advised  that  approval  of  advance \ncontracting does not commit ADB to finance the project. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  the  MFNP.  The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \n\n \n\n                                                \n19 The weighted average cost of capital for the overall project was calculated to be 3.68%. \n20 Government of Tonga. 2010. Public Financial Management Performance Report. Nuku\u2019alofa. \n21 The existing PMC contract will be extended and funded by the additional financing. \n22 The guidelines state in paras. 3.6\u20133.8 that for direct contracting, (i) no better offer is likely to be received, and that \nthe price to be paid is not more than the original price; and (ii) standardization of equipment or spare parts, to be \ncompatible  with  existing  equipment,  may  justify  additional  purchases  from  the  original  supplier.  Under  the \nguidelines,  the  use  of  force  account  can  be  justified  when  (i)  quantities  of  work  involved  cannot  be  defined  in \nadvance; (ii) works are small and scattered or in remote locations and qualified construction firms are unlikely to bid \non them at reasonable prices;(iii) work is required to be carried out without disrupting ongoing operations;  and (iv) \nthe  risks  of  unavoidable  work  interruption  are  better  borne  by  the  recipient  or  implementing  agency  than  by  a \ncontractor. \n\n\f8 \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n \n\n26. \nThe  current  project  is  expected  to  have  a  positive  social  impact  by  helping  to  ease  air \npollution. By reducing the use of diesel fuel for power generation, it will avoid what would have \nbeen a significant amount of damaging emissions each year. The additional financing will help \nthe  current  project  achieve  the  targeted  social  benefits  by  reducing  high  losses  during  power \ndistribution, which in turn will lower the diesel fuel consumed by generation while delivering the \nsame  end  amount  of  electricity  to  consumers.  The  overall  project  is  expected  to  offer  new \nemployment and income opportunities for local unskilled and semiskilled workers in the project \nareas and to support education by making it possible for local students to study by electric light \nat night. \n \nThe  current  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  majority  of  its \n27. \noutputs  have  specific  gender  design  features  to  ensure  that  women  participate  in  the  project \nand have access to project benefits. The overall project will actively promote the involvement of \nwomen  in  all  its  employment  and  training  opportunities.23 Under  ADB\u2019s  Cyclone  Ian  Recovery \nProject, TPL  has  established  a  track  record  of  successfully  employing  new  female trainee  line \npersons who have received intensive instruction in field work. This has been done to achieve a \ngreater  balance  in  gender  representation  on  the  project\u2019s  installation  work  force.  TPL  plans  to \nbring its six women and two men trainees currently working on  Ha\u2019apai under the Cyclone Ian \nRecovery Project to the sites where the project work to be funded by the additional financing is \nto be carried out. This may create opportunities for long-term employment for these trainees. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n28. \nEnvironment. The  two areas to  be  affected by activities  under  the  additional financing \nare classified as category B for environment. Initial environmental examinations were prepared \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  No  significant  environmental \nimpacts will result from the implementation of the overall project. \n \n29. \nInvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The additional financing project is \nclassified as category C for both involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The activities \nunder  the  additional  financing  component  will  use  the  right-of-way  on  a  government  reserve \noccupied  by  the  existing  power  distribution  network  owned  by  TPL  and  community  electric \ncooperatives. It is therefore not expected to involve land acquisition or displacement of people \nor  physical  structures.  No  third  party  or  persons  will  be  adversely  affected.  No  distinct  and \nvulnerable  indigenous  peoples  as  defined  under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  are \nexpected to be affected by the overall project. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n30. \nNo significant issues are expected to arise in implementing the overall project.
