The  project  will  finance  urban  environment  improvement \ninfrastructure through 11 subprojects.6 These will cover (i) solid waste management (SWM) for \nimproved  environmental  quality;  (ii)  urban  road  upgrading  for  improved  connectivity  and \nevacuation  during  disasters;  and  (iii)  completion  of  flood  dikes,  drainage  channels,  and \nregulating  basins  for  flood  protection.  The  project  optimizes  development  impact  by  adding  to \nthe flood protection and drainage infrastructure initiated through a previous Asian Development \nBank (ADB) project for Ha Tinh and Tam Ky.7 Project management skills and mechanisms will \nbe  improved  for  integrated  urban  development,  environment  planning,  and  climate  change \nadaptation.  Interventions  for  women,  disadvantaged  groups,  and  community  awareness  have \nbeen integrated into the project design.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nCore urban growth issues. Viet Nam\u2019s population and economy are rapidly urbanizing \nwith a structural shift from agriculture to industry and services, which account for nearly 80% of \nthe economy since 2005.8 These sectors are key contributors to urban expansion and the rural \nto  urban  transition.  Although  urban  poverty  is  significantly  reduced,  inequality  in  income  and \naccess  to  basic  services  remain.  Natural  disasters  and  climate-induced  impacts  add  to  the \nassociated  social,  economic,  and  environment  costs  of  rapid  urbanization,  especially  in  the \nsecondary  cities  with  limited  capacity  to  address  consequences  of  rapid  urbanization.9 This  is \nrecognized  in  the  Framework  Master  Plan  for  Urban  Development  in  Viet  Nam  to  2025  and \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2011. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Preparing \n\nthe Secondary Cities Development Project. Manila (TA 7856-VIE). \n\n3   Buon Ma  Thuot is strategic for transport connectivity in the central highlands.  It is class I, with population (about \n\n311,965) growing at 3.17% per year. \n\n4   Ha Tinh in the north\u2013central region has a population of 94,022 with expected annual growth of 8%.  It is currently \nclass  III,  to  be  upgraded  to  class  II  by  2015.    It  is  prone  to  flooding  because  of  its  flat  terrain  and  surrounding \nnatural river courses, with limited drainage capacity of streams and ponds. \n\n5   Tam Ky has a population of about 109,000, projected to increase to 150,000 by 2015 with annual growth of 1.15%. \nCurrently class III to be upgraded to a class II city by 2015, it is affected by an average of five typhoons each year. \nIt has high annual precipitation with average annual rainfall of 3,448 millimeters. \n\n6   Key criteria is to improve climate resilience, environmental quality, and climate change adaptation by communities. \n7   ADB. 2013.

Socio-Economic  Development  Strategy, \n\n2011\u20132020. Ha Noi (January). \n\n9   According  to  the  National  Climate  Change  Strategy  (approved  through  Decision  No.2139/QD-TTg,  dated \n5 December  2011),  since  1963,  Viet  Nam  has  experienced  an  average  temperature  rise  of  0.5oC\u20130.7oC;  a  sea \nlevel rise of 20 centimeters; and worsening floods, storms, and droughts.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nVision  to  2050.10 The  master  plan  aims  to  achieve  balanced  and  strategic  growth  through  a \nnational system of capably managed urban centers, envisaging secondary and tertiary cities as \ndevelopment hubs within the provincial context.  Developing provincial capital cities as pilots in \ndifferent  geographic  regions  will  boost  the  local  economy,  balance  regional  development, \nstrengthen rural\u2013urban links, and address overcrowding in primary urban centers.   \n \n4. \nImproved  climate  resilience  of  infrastructure.  The  challenge  for  Viet  Nam  is  to \nmaintain its long-term development prospects by minimizing risks associated with urbanization. \nAdapting  critical  infrastructure  by  building  climate  resilience  in  coastal  and  low-lying  areas  will \nsafeguard  vulnerable  populations  and  productive  sectors  of  the  economy,  including  its  natural \nresources.11 The  project responds to  stakeholder priorities for  improving  climate  resilience  and \nenvironmental quality by (i) upgrading road links for connectivity within the urban areas and as \nconduits for  evacuation during  storms  and  typhoons;  (ii)  completing and upgrading flood  dikes \nand  regulating  basins  for  improved  drainage  and  storm  water  management;  and  (iii)  providing \nan  integrated  SWM  road  map  in  Buon  Ma  Thuot  for  an  improved  urban  environment.  The \nsubprojects  will  provide  employment  potential,  including  among  the  urban  poor  and  other \nvulnerable groups. The project will enable the cities to transition into regional economic centers \nwith improved resilience and liveability. \n \n5. \nSupport  related  policies  and  strategies. The project will catalyze the implementation \nof  Viet Nam\u2019s  overarching  policies  contained  in  the  Socio-Economic  Development  Strategy, \n2011\u20132020  and  the  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan,  2011\u20132015. 12 The  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment  Plan,  2011\u20132015  emphasizes  the  need  to  (i)  use  natural  resources  efficiently, \n(ii) enhance environmental protection, (iii) prevent and limit adverse impacts of natural disasters, \nand (iv) respond effectively to climate change. The selected subprojects are enabled by sector \npolicies,  including the  Viet  Nam  National Green Growth Strategy  and the  National  Action  Plan \non  Climate  Change;  and  key  sector  orientation  plans  related  to  land  drainage  and  flood \nprotection,  SWM,  and  roads  infrastructure.13 The  subprojects  comply  with  each  city\u2019s  master \nplan  and  are  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  and  sector  priorities;  urban  operational  plan,  2012\u2013\n2020;  and \nthe  Viet  Nam  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132015,  which  promotes \ncomprehensive  socioeconomic  development  in  urban  areas,  fostering  balanced  growth  and \nsocial  stability. 14  ADB\u2019s  urban  sector  assessment,  strategy,  and  road  map  for  Viet  Nam \ninclusion,  and  stakeholder \nidentifies  other  ADB  priorities  on  climate  change,  social \n\n                                                \n10  Government  of  Viet  Nam,  Ministry  of  Construction.  2009.

The  provincial  people\u2019s  committee  (PPC)  of  Quang  Nam,  Dak  Lak,  and  Ha  Tinh \nprovinces will be the executing agencies. The Quang Nam PPC, as lead executing agency, will \ncoordinate  and  liaise  with  national  line  agencies  and  ADB  during  project  implementation.  The \nlead  executing  agency  will  consult  the  Dak  Lak  and  Ha Tinh  PPCs  for  all  decisions  related  to \nprocurement  of  international  consultants  for  project  management  and  implementation  support. \nThe  city  people\u2019s  committees  (CPCs)  of  Buon  Ma  Thuot,  Ha  Tinh,  and  Tam  Ky,  which  is  the \nProjects  Construction  Investment  Management  Authority  Quang  Nam  (PCI.QNa),  are  the \nimplementing agencies or project owners. The PMUs of Tam Ky (PCI.QNa), Ha Tinh, Buon Ma \nThuot,  and  the  Dak  Lak  Urban  Environmental  Company  (DAKURENCO)  are  the  project \nimplementation  units.  Each  PMU  will  include  multidisciplinary  skills  and  implement  its \nsubprojects.22 The PCI.QNa is nominated as the coordinating PMU in consensus with the other \nPMU  directors,  executing  agencies,  and  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment.  It  will  liaise \nwith the other PMUs to harmonize project implementation. The PMUs for Ha Tinh and Tam Ky \n(PCI.QNa)  have  experience  implementing  previous ADB  projects (footnote  17).  Each  PPC  will \nprovide  oversight  and  decisions  on  the  appointment  of  national  consultants  for  its  PMU.  This \n\n                                                \n20 The  ADB  loan  will  finance  (i)  taxes  and  duties  of  Tam  Ky  as  requested,  as  these  are  within  reasonable  country \nthresholds,  do  not  represent  an  excessive  share  of  the  project  investment,  and  apply  only  to  ADB-financed \nexpenditures that are material and relevant to the project\u2019s success; and (ii) incremental administration (excluding \nsalaries), bank charges, transportation, and insurance costs to facilitate project implementation.  \n\n21  Government  of  Viet  Nam.  2006.

The  need  to  raise  design  standards  for  flood  protection  and  land  drainage \nwas confirmed during feasibility studies.24 Subproject designs in Tam Ky and Ha Tinh for flood \nprotection  and  land  drainage  will  complete,  extend,  and  upgrade  the  dike  and  drainage \nchannels  that  commenced  as  part  of  the  Central  Region  Urban  Environmental  Improvement \nProject  for  Viet  Nam. 25  Provincial  and  district  authorities  have  the  capacity  and  skill  for \nundertaking all types of civil works, O&M, and construction management.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial  \n\n16. \nEconomic  analysis  was  done  for  all  subprojects  with  computation  of  economic  internal \nrate  of  return,  net  present  value,  and  benefit\u2013cost  ratio.  The  base  case  results  indicate  all \ncomponents  are  economically  viable  with  an  estimated  economic  internal  rate  of  return \nexceeding  the  assumed  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of  12%.  Results  ranged  from \n13.5% to 18.3% for urban roads, 15.2% to 17.5% for flood control and drainage, and 18.1% for \nlandfill. All subprojects were also viable under adverse scenarios wherein costs were higher or \nbenefits lower by 10% than the base case.26 \n \n17. \nA  financial  management  assessment  confirmed  that  all  implementing  agencies  have \nsound accounting and financial management capacity. The PMUs have experience in managing \nlarge  ODA-funded  projects  except  for  the  PMU  of  Buon  Ma  Thuot,  which  will  require  support \nthrough  the  capacity  development  component.  Based  on  existing  policy,  project  assets  are \nturned  over  to  the  provincial  urban  environmental  companies  (URENCOs),  which  will  operate \nand  maintain  the  assets.27 The  financial  soundness  of  the  URENCOs  was  established.  28 A \nfinancial  sustainability  analysis  was  conducted  for  all  subprojects  by  city  to  confirm  the \navailability of sufficient counterpart funds. Ha Tinh and Buon Ma Thuot have sufficient funds to \ncover  the  ongoing  O&M  costs  of  all  its  nonrevenue  subprojects.  Increased  funds  to  support \nO&M  responsibilities  for  the  Quang  Nam  URENCO  are  ensured  through  loan  agreement \nassurances.  For  the  SWM  subproject  in  Buon  Ma  Thuot,  the  financial  analysis  confirmed  that \nthe proposed solid waste collection tariffs will be sufficient to cover the O&M cost DAKURENCO \nwill incur.29  \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n18. \nThe  PPCs  of  Dak  Lak,  Ha  Tinh,  and  Quang  Nam  will  adhere  to  the  transparency  and \naccountability elements of good governance for financial management and fund disbursements. \nThrough  their  direct  participation  in  undertaking  procurement  procedures  of  the  ongoing  and \nproposed  ADB-financed  project,  the  PPCs  and  PMUs  will  develop  institutional  capacity  for \ninternational  and  national  competitive  bidding  for  civil  works.  They  will  be  supported  by  the \nproposed capacity development component on financial management, fund disbursement, and \nprocurement procedures of ADB and the government.  \n \n\n                                                \n24  Climate change factors changed from a 1:5 years to a 1:40 years storm event as a minimum standard to comply \nwith  targets  and  standards  set  by  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  and  the  Ministry  of  Natural \nResources and Environment. \n\n25  ADB.  2003.

Manila. \n\n26  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27  The  Ministry  of  Construction  decisions  cover  guidelines  for  O&M  rates  for  sanitary  landfill,  drainage,  flood \nprotection,  regulating  basins,  and  environmental  improvement.  The  Ministry  of  Transportation  covers  O&M  for \nroads. \n\n28  No debt service assumption was reflected in the projections. \n29  Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n19. \nwith the government and the PPCs of Dak Lak, Ha Tinh, and Quang Nam. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n20. \nThe project is categorized as general intervention benefitting the total populations of the \nthree  cities  including  the  poor,  women,  ethnic,  and  vulnerable  groups.  Interventions  to reduce \npoverty  and  promote  inclusive  development  will  directly  benefit  affected  groups.  The  social \nimpacts  will  be  positive,  contributing  to  better  living  conditions,  welfare,  and  health  of  the \nbeneficiaries.  A  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  includes measures  to  address \nsocial impacts and enhance distribution of project benefits.30  \n \n21. \nConstruction  of  the  flood  management  and  drainage  system  will  protect  the \nbeneficiaries, especially the poor and vulnerable households, from possible losses in assets, \nincome, and livelihood, and resultant health risks from floods and stagnant storm water. The \nengineered  landfill  and  community  awareness  campaign  will  improve  the  SWM  practice,  to \nincrease  the  number  of  households  with  access  to  proper  waste  collection  and  disposal,  in \nturn  improving  health  and  sanitation  conditions.  Road  development  will  improve  connectivity \nand help in evacuation during floods. Subprojects will create employment opportunities, during \nconstruction and O&M, for local people, especially the poor and vulnerable groups.   \n \n22. \nThe project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming, and a gender action plan \nhas  been  prepared.  The  gender  action  plan  ensures  (i)  50%  female  participation  in  decision \nmaking related to planning and design of local urban infrastructure investments; (ii) 35% female \nparticipation in construction supervision boards; (iii) DAKURENCO employing 25% female staff \nin the  new  SWM facility;  (iv)  50% female  trainees in  training  related to  SWM, flood  protection, \ndisaster  risk  reduction  and  management,  and  road  safety;  (v)  30%  target  for  training  of  PMU \nfemale  staff  on  urban  planning,  environmental  management,  and  financial  management  and \nprocurement;  (vi)  1,100  women  from  subproject  areas  are  provided  vocational  training  and \ncredit  for  income  generation;  and  (vii)  inclusion  of  sex-disaggregated  data  in  the  project \nperformance  management  system,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  indicators,  and  regular  project \nreporting.31 \n  \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n23. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  Initial  environmental  examinations  pertaining  to  the \nsubprojects were conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and \ngovernment  regulations. 32 The  subprojects  will  improve  environment  quality  in  urban  areas \nthrough  improved  SWM,  drainage,  storm  water  management,  and  area  regeneration;  and  will \nnot cause any irreversible environment impacts. Mitigation measures for identified impacts are \nincluded in the environmental management plan (EMP). Initial costs for implementing the EMPs \nare integrated in the project cost. The EMPs will be updated and finalized at the detailed design \nstage.33 Final  EMPs  will  be  cleared  by  ADB  and  form  part  of  the  contract  bidding  documents. \nEnvironmental  considerations  during  design  and  allocation  of  sufficient  O&M  budget  will  help \nmitigate adverse impacts during operation. Environmental monitoring during implementation will \nbe  ensured.

The  total  estimated  cost \n\nwill  be  obtained  before  contract  award.  The  PMU\u2019s  environment  officer  will  monitor  the \nimplementation of EMPs, and any critical environment matter will be resolved by the provincial \nproject steering committee.    \n \nInvoluntary resettlement (category A). Resettlement plans were prepared for each city \n24. \nfor  the  subprojects  to  address  resettlement  impacts  associated  with  the  land  acquisition  in \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. A total area of 118.24 hectares (ha) will be \nacquired (comprising 23.6 ha in Tam Ky, 31.5 ha in Ha Tinh, and 63.14 ha in Buon Ma Thuot). A \ntotal of 2,417 households (10,737 affected persons) will be affected in the three project cities. A \ntotal of 452 households (2,104 affected persons) will have significant impacts, with loss of more \nthan  10%  of  their  productive  land,  while  116  households  (533  affected  persons)  will  require \nrelocation.  All  other \nis \n$22.21 million,  including  base  costs,  allowances,  and  management  fee.  A  project  information \nbooklet  was  distributed  to  affected  persons  in  February  2013,  to  be  updated  and  distributed \nduring the detailed measurement survey. A designated social development officer in each PMU \nwill ensure that resettlement plans are implemented.34 \n \n25. \nIndigenous peoples (category C). No ethnic minority household is affected in Tam Ky \nand  Ha  Tinh  subprojects.  In  Buon  Ma  Thuot,  16.4%  of  the  population  belongs  to  an  ethnic \nminority  group  (mainly  Ede)  and  42  households  (223  affected  persons)  of  that  group  will  be \naffected  by  loss  of  agricultural  land  (18  households  affected  by  urban  roads  components  and \n24 households  affected  by  the  landfill  site  in  rural  areas).  The  Ede  have  lived  in  this  ancient \ncommunity for several generations. In the landfill site, the Ede households live in two separate \nhamlets. However, the surveys assessed that they are well integrated with the Kinh majority. All \n42 households own their agricultural land or are considered legal. The 42 households have the \nsame  source  and  level  of  income  as  Kinh  and  do  not  require  any  relocation.  The  mitigation \nmeasures  for  land  acquisition-related  impacts,  including  income restoration  for  the  42 affected \nhouseholds,  are  included  in  the  Buon  Ma  Thuot  resettlement  plan.  Hence,  a  separate \nindigenous peoples plan was not required.  \n \n26. \nConsultations and disclosure. Resettlement and environment documents, prepared in \nconsultation with stakeholders and local communities, are in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  and  Vietnamese  laws.  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  disclosure  policy,  the \ndocuments have been posted on the ADB website. A grievance redress mechanism agreed with \nthe  executing  agencies  will  facilitate  resolution  of  complaints  on  project  performance.  The \nupdated resettlement plans and EMPs will be disclosed after ADB clears detailed design prior to \ncontract award.  \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe  integrated  benefits and impacts  of  the  project  are expected to  outweigh the  costs.   \n\n27. \nKey risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail in the risk \nassessment and risk management plan.35  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                \n34 Resettlement Plans (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nTable 5: Summary of Key Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nInfrastructure  built  through  the  project  is  damaged  by \ntyphoons and flooding. \n\nTechnical  and  administrative  capacities  of  project  staff \nare  inadequate  for  project  management  and  continued \noperation  and  maintenance.
