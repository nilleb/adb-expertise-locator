Its development and implementation will be covered by a 5-\nyear automatically renewable power purchase agreement between \nthe  Electricity  Generating  Authority  of  Thailand  (EGAT)  and  NED \nunder the Small Power Producers Program. EGAT will purchase all \nthe energy output of the plant up to 55 MW, the upper limit set in the \npower  purchase  agreement.  The  solar  project  will  use  innovative \nthin-film photovoltaic technology and is expected to be one of the \nlargest solar photovoltaic projects in the world. It is also working with \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) to prefinance certified emission \nreductions under ADB\u2019s Carbon Market Initiative.  \n   \nImplementation  The project will use thin-film photovoltaic technology produced by \nArrangements  Sharp,  and  will  be  implemented  by  Sharp  and  the  Italian-Thai \nDevelopment  Public  Company  under  a  fixed-price,  date-certain \nengineering,  procurement,  and  construction  contract  with \nperformance  guarantees  for  on-time  completion  and  a  25-year \nperformance warranty for the photovoltaic module. Among the world\u2019s \nlargest  suppliers  of  solar  cells,  Sharp  holds  about  20%  of  the \nworldwide market for solar power. The company is rated A/stable by \nStandard & Poor\u2019s and A2/stable by Moody\u2019s. \n   \nProposed ADB  The proposed loan will be for up to the lower of $70 million equivalent \nAssistance  in baht (or dollars if for any reason Baht is not available) and 25% of \nproject  costs.  In  the  event  that  ADB  cannot  effectively  fund  baht \nloans, or NED elects to arrange financing under an ADB partial credit \nguarantee, the proposed direct loan may be replaced by a partial \ncredit guarantee issued by ADB to eligible lenders up to the lower of \n$70 million equivalent in baht and 25% of project costs.  The grant \ncomponent of investments, amounting to $2 million, will be financed \non a grant basis by the Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy \n ", "ii \nFinancing Partnership Facility, comprising three clean energy funds \nwhose aim is to help improve energy security in DMC's and decrease \nthe rate of climate change. The grant funds will be administered by \nADB and cover a portion of the contingency financing in the event \nthat the project has to draw down contingency funds. The grant funds \nfor contingency financing significantly reduce the risk of introducing \nPV technology on a large scale. \n   \nImpact, Outcome  The project\u2019s development impact will result from the demonstration \nand Benefits  effect  of  the  feasibility  and  sustainability  of  a  large-scale  private \nsector solar farm, a model that can be replicated by other private \nsector investors in Thailand and other developing member countries. \nOf all renewable energy sources in Thailand, solar energy has the \nmost potential, possibly offering more than 50,000 MW of installed \ncapacity. The project will be the first to demonstrate this unrealized \npotential.  The  project  and  its  anticipated  replication  will  diversify \nThailand\u2019s energy mix by adding renewable energy capacity, helping \nthe  country  to  meet  its  target  of  obtaining  20.4%  of  its  primary \ncommercial energy from renewable energy by 2022.  \n   \nSponsors  The project is sponsored by the China Light and Power (CLP) Group, \nMitsubishi, and the Electricity Generating Public Company. The CLP \nGroup is a leading power utility in Asia with more than 30 power \ngeneration assets and distribution businesses throughout the Asia \nand Pacific region. The group is rated A\u2212/stable by Standard & Poor\u2019s \nand A2/stable by Moody\u2019s. Mitsubishi, Japan\u2019s largest general trading \ncompany, has managed businesses in a wide range of industries \nincluding energy, metals, machinery, chemicals, food, and general \nmerchandise. Mitsubishi is rated A+/stable by Standard & Poor\u2019s and \nA1/stable by Moody\u2019s. The Electricity Generating Public Company is \nThailand\u2019s first and largest independent power producer. \n   \nNonsovereign  The final rating reflects the guaranteed offtake arrangements with a \nOperations Rating  strong government utility (EGAT), the leading technology and long-\nand Rationale  term warranties from Sharp, a pioneer in the solar industry, and the \nlocal and international power sector expertise of the sponsors (CLP, \nMitsubishi and Electricity Generating Public Company), offset by the \nlonger tenor of ADB's facility, exposure to movements in wholesale \nelectricity market rates post-adder and the greenfield nature of the \nProject, which has no track record of operations.  A higher rating may \nbe warranted once a stable level of operations has been achieved.      \n   \nJustification and  The justification for ADB\u2019s assistance for the project is based on the \nADB Value-Added  value that ADB can add to the project and its development impact \nand demonstration effects. The project merits ADB\u2019s support because \n(i) ADB\u2019s assistance is consistent with its country partnership strategy \nfor Thailand 2007\u20132011 and country operations business plan, both \nof which are built on infrastructure development and environmentally \nsustainable  development  as  core  strategic  areas  of  partnership; \n(ii) the project supports the government\u2019s strategy of diversifying its \nenergy mix and securing its supply from domestic resources; (iii) the \n ", "iii \nproject will help the government meet its target of using energy from \nrenewable sources to fill 20.4% of the country\u2019s primary commercial \nenergy  needs  by  2022;  (iv) the  project  will  demonstrate  the \ncommercial viability of large-scale private sector solar farms, a model \nthat other private sector investors can then replicate in Thailand and \nelsewhere in the region; (vi) ADB assistance will play a crucial role in \nhelping the project to obtain appropriate long-term financing, which is \na necessary condition for the viability of a solar project; and (vii) \nwithout  the  availability  of  ADB's  loan  or  guarantee,    pre-financed \nCERs from the Future Carbon Fund and the proposed GCI, it is \nunlikely that the Project would meet the Sponsors' minimum hurdle \nrates to implement the project.  \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) either a \nproposed loan for the Solar Power Project up to the lesser of $70,000,000 equivalent in baht (or \ndollars if for any reason baht is not available) and 25% of project costs, from the ordinary capital \nresources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) without government guarantee, or a partial \ncredit  guarantee  issued  by  ADB  to  eligible  lenders  to  the  Natural  Energy  Development \nCompany  (NED),  and  (ii)  the  proposed  administration  by  ADB  of  a  grant  component  of \ninvestment not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 to the Natural Energy Development \nCompany to be financed on a grant basis provided by the Clean Energy Fund under the Clean \nEnergy Financing Partnership Facility1  to cover a portion of the contingency funding for the \nSolar Power Project. If approved, the project will constitute ADB\u2019s third private sector investment \nin Thailand.  \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \nA.  Project Identification and Selection \n2.  To implement ADB\u2019s Strategy 20202 and the Thailand country strategy by supporting \nclean energy projects, ADB worked with Thailand's Ministry of Finance to organize a seminar on \nthe  financing  of  clean  energy  projects.  The  seminar  was  held  in  Bangkok  and  generated \nconsiderable interest among clean energy project sponsors and financial institutions. After the \nseminar, ADB identified the proposed project as one of the best in environmental sustainability, \nfinancial and technical feasibility, potential for carbon emission reduction, and demonstration \nimpact.  \n \n3.  Solar energy is an abundant resource throughout Thailand and can represent a potential \nof more than 50,000 megawatts (MW) in installed power capacity, 3 according to measurements \nof average solar irradiation over the last 20 years.4 The project will pioneer in demonstrating the \ncommercial viability of large-scale private sector solar farms, a model that other private sector \ninvestors can then replicate in Thailand and elsewhere in the region. The photovoltaic power \nplant to be built under the project is expected to be one of the largest in the world.  \n \n4.  This project and its potential demonstrational impact will benefit from a confluence of \nunique factors. The sound track record of China Light and Power (CLP), Mitsubishi, and the \nElectricity Generating Public Company (EGCO) (the project sponsors); the commitment of the \nGovernment of Thailand to clean energy through a supportive feed-in tariff; regulatory stability; \nand achievements of the solar industry worldwide\u2014all these will mitigate the challenges that often \ngo with large-scale solar projects. Moreover, ADB\u2019s combination of financial products will bolster \nthe viability of the project. Without prefinanced certified emission reductions (CERs) from ADB\u2019s \nFuture Carbon Fund (FCF), ADB\u2019s long-term financing and the CEFPF\u2019s GCI, the project is \nunlikely to meet the sponsors' minimum hurdle rates for implementation. The innovative structure \nof the grant component of investment (GCI) will significantly reduce the risk of introducing thin-film \nphotovoltaic technology on a large scale by increasing the confidence of private sector investors \n                                                 \n1 Contributors: the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain and Sweden \n2 ADB. 2008.

ADB\u2019s long-term local currency \nloan (or PCG) will give NED the tenor it needs to fund a power generation plant with high \ninvestment costs up front but no ongoing fuel costs. ADB\u2019s presence will also encourage local \ncommercial banks with less experience in clean energy projects to commit to the project.  \nB.  Sector Overview \n5.  Thailand  is  a  large  consumer  of  electricity.  As  of  June  2009,  its  installed  power \ngeneration capacity was 28,482 MW, 70% of this from natural gas and 21% from coal and \nlignite. Its recent energy policy has stressed the importance of diversifying and securing sources \nof fuel for power generation. Overreliance on natural gas, coupled with exposure to oil price \nvolatility, has magnified the country\u2019s political and economic risk. The country continues to \ndepend on imports as domestic demand for commercial primary energy outpaces the discovery \nof indigenous oil and gas.  \n \n6.  Energy consumption in Thailand is growing much faster than the gross domestic product, \nreflecting the increasing share of energy investment. Energy consumption is responsible for \nmore than 50% of the country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions.5 If unchecked, the rapid growth in \nenergy consumption will increase carbon intensity in the economy. In the second revision of \nThailand\u2019s  Power  Development  Plan  20076,  published  in  2009,  the  Electricity  Generating \nAuthority of Thailand (EGAT) projected a 4.9% average growth in net electricity generation \ndemand and a 5.4% annual average increase in peak demand between 2008 and 2021. The \nenergy technology choices Thailand makes now will therefore have important implications for \nclimate change in the region in the long term.  \n \n7.  Fortunately,  Thailand  has  abundant  renewable  energy  sources\u2014biomass,  biogas, \nmini-hydro, solar, and wind. Using these domestic sources of renewable energy can boost \nThailand\u2019s energy security, save foreign exchange, and protect the country from global price \nfluctuations. As part of the strategy of diversifying the energy mix and promoting renewable \nenergy, the government has prepared an Alternative Energy Development Plan7 (2008\u20132022) \nand set a target of 20.4% for primary commercial energy from renewable energy sources by \n2022. This implies a renewable energy capacity of 5,608 MW by 2022, a significant increase \nfrom the present 1,750 MW. 8  \n \n8.   To  complement  its  renewable  energy  strategy  the  Ministry  of  Energy  is  advocating \ndecentralized power generation mainly by supporting the country\u2019s Small Power Producer (SPP) \nand Very Small Power Producer (VSPP) programs. The SPP program allows private developers \nto  build,  own,  and  operate  10\u201390 MW  power  projects  and  enter  into  power  purchase \nagreements (PPAs) with EGAT. Under the VSPP program, on the other hand, producers of up \nto 10 MW may sell power to the Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) and the Provincial \nElectricity Authority (PEA). The country\u2019s 118 VSPPs contribute less than 1% to total power \ngeneration, but the 60 SPPs account for 10%.9 Renewable energy SPPs and VSPPs can get \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2009.

Solar energy projects \nreceive a fixed adder subsidy of B8 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for 10 years from the start of \ncommercial operations.  \n \n9.  Over  the  past  2  decades,  solar  power  has  become  more  and  more  economically \nattractive. Grid-connected solar photovoltaic generation systems are the fastest growing in the \nworld: cumulative installed capacity grew by 50% yearly in 2006 and 2007 to 7.8 GW by the end \nof 2007.10 According to the Annual Energy Outlook 2009,11 the capacity costs of new plants \nusing solar photovoltaics will be 37% lower by 2030 than the 2009 costs. At the same time, \nelectricity from conventional sources will cost more to generate; thus, electricity prices will go up \nin places like Thailand that have large numbers of gas-fired power plants. By 2030, cheaper \nsolar energy and higher-cost conventional power generation are expected to approach grid \nparity. With these trends converging, global installed solar capacity in 2020 could be 20\u201340 \ntimes what it is today. \n \n10.  The project will be the first to demonstrate the capacity of large-scale solar projects to \nmeet power needs in Thailand. After a large-scale private sector solar farm is shown to be \nfeasible, other private sector investors can replicate the model in Thailand and other developing \nmember countries (DMCs). Small-scale solar power has been around for many years, mainly \nproviding energy to communities with no access to the national power grid. There are 32 \ngrid-connected solar rooftop projects with a generating capacity of 0.14 MW, and many small \noff-grid solar VSPP projects producing a total of 32 MW. In addition, a few small solar farms, \nsponsored by EGAT and the private sector, have a generating capacity of less than 2.2 MW.12 \nThailand\u2019s Alternative Energy Policy projects solar power to grow from 34 MW to 500 MW by \n2022 (footnote 6). \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n1.  Consistency with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 \n11.  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020  supports  environmentally  sustainable,  private  sector\u2013assisted \ndevelopment in meeting the growing energy demand in the region, even as it capitalizes on \nADB\u2019s operating strengths in infrastructure development and finance, among other areas. The \nstrategy seeks the expansion of environmentally friendly technologies, specifically for clean and \nefficient energy generation and use, and a larger role for the private sector in infrastructure \nfinancing through public\u2013private partnerships. \n2.  Consistency with Country Strategy \n12.  The main constraints on sustainable economic growth are the central concerns of ADB\u2019s \npartnership with Thailand. The country partnership strategy for Thailand 2007\u2013201113 is directed \nat three core strategic areas\u2014infrastructure, environmental sustainability, and capital markets. \nThe  government\u2019s  Alternative  Energy  Development  Plan,  approved  by  the  Cabinet  on \n28 January 2009, notes the immense potential of Thailand\u2019s solar energy and the savings on \nenergy imports that can be made through its use, with private sector investment. \n                                                 \n10 Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century (REN21). 2008.

ADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy 14  gives  emphasis  to  investments  in  energy  efficiency  and \nrenewable energy projects, and in wider access to energy. In 2013, ADB will raise its clean \nenergy investment target to $2 billion a year from the present $1 billion, in a bid to speed up \nlow-carbon  growth  and  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  the  region.  The  policy  also \nunderscores ADB\u2019s continued financial and technical support for projects that qualify for carbon \ncredits under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol. The proposed \nproject is expected to benefit from the prefinancing of CERs by ADB's Carbon Market Initiative \n(CMI). The CMI team has been working on the CDM component with the project sponsors, in \nparallel with the ADB loan discussions. \nIII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Description \n  1.   The Borrower and the Sponsors   \n14.  The project is sponsored by a unique partnership that combines regional leadership, \noperating and technical expertise, and strong local presence. The borrower, NED, is a joint \nventure in which the sponsors\u2014CLP Thailand Renewables (a wholly owned subsidiary of CLP \nHoldings), Diamond Generating Asia (a wholly owned subsidiary of Mitsubishi), and EGCO\u2014\neach hold a 33.33% share. NED, headquartered in Bangkok, has the primary aim of developing, \nowning, managing, and operating renewable energy projects in the region.15  \n \n15.  CLP Thailand Renewables, established as an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of CLP \nHoldings Limited (CLP), will hold a 33.3% stake in NED. CLP is one of the leading power utilities \nin Asia with more than 30 power generation assets and distribution businesses throughout the \nAsia and Pacific region. CLP has equity in about 6,400 MW of generating assets in Australia, \nIndia, Thailand, and Taipei,China. In Hong Kong, China, CLP operates a vertically integrated \nelectricity  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  business  with  an  installed  capacity  of \n6,908 MW and a transmission capacity of 12,000 kilometers (km). It supplies electricity to about \n80% of the population of Hong Kong, China. CLP is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. \nCLP  has  a  strong  commitment  to  renewable  energy.  The  group,  in  2004,  set  a  target  of \ngenerating 5% of its output from renewable sources by 2010 and met the target 3 years ahead \nof time. It has also expanded into solar energy through its Australian subsidiary, TRUenergy, \nwhich is developing a solar power station in Melbourne.  \n \n16.  CLP is rated A\u2212/stable/A\u22122 by Standard & Poor\u2019s and A2/stable by Moody\u2019s. This rating \nreflects the group\u2019s strong liquidity, favorable regulatory environment, good liability management, \nand  significant  financial  flexibility.  CLP  plans  to  increase  its  financial  leverage,  but  it  has \nmaintained good access to the capital markets despite tightening global financial markets. \nCLP\u2019s market capitalization is about HK$126.6 billion ($16.3 billion) and the group revenue in \n2008 was about HK$54.3 billion ($7.0 billion) and net income HK$10.4 billion ($1.3 billion). \n \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2009.

Manila.  \n15 NED has given its assurance that if it develops and owns other renewable energy projects, there will be no \ncommingling of costs, revenues, accounts, properties, or assets with the project (excluding in respect of any \ncommon facilities) and there will be no cross-default among the facilities for different projects. Any encumbrance \nover common facilities used by the project and other projects will be subject to lenders agreeing to customary \nnon-disturbance agreements.  \n ", "5 \n17.  The second sponsor, Mitsubishi, is Japan\u2019s largest general trading company and has \nmanaged  businesses  in  a  wide  range  of  industries,  including  energy,  metals,  machinery, \nchemicals,  food,  and  general  merchandise.  Mitsubishi  brings  an  expansive  network  to  the \npartnership, as it has more than 45 years of experience operating in Thailand, with nearly \n100 joint-venture investment companies in the country. Mitsubishi has developed, sponsored, \nand invested in numerous power projects in the Australia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Southeast Asia, \nthe United Kingdom, and the United States with gross capacity of about 11,500 MW. Through \nOneEnergy Limited, a 50:50 joint venture of Mitsubishi and CLP, Mitsubishi has equity interests \nin Taipei,China\u2019s Ho Ping Coal-Fired Power Station, with capacity of 1,320 MW, and various \npower plants in Thailand through the investment in EGCO, in which OneEnergy has a 22.4% \nstake. In 2009, Mitsubishi signed an agreement with Acciona to acquire a 34% equity interest in \nAmper Central Solar S.A., which developed and operates one of the world\u2019s largest solar \nphotovoltaic projects (45.8 MW) in Amareleja, Portugal. \n \n18.  Mitsubishi is rated A+/stable/A\u22121 by Standard & Poor\u2019s and A1/stable by Moody\u2019s. It \nrepresents diverse and profitable business segments with particular strength in the energy and \nmetal resources divisions. The rating reflects its strong and sustainable franchise, improved \nfinancial fundamentals over the past several years, including sharp increase in earnings and \ndeleveraging,  strong  funding  ability  and  good  management  team,  and  the  challenge  of \nsignificant concentration in the current deteriorating domestic and global business environment. \nFor the year that ended on 31 March 2009, Mitsubishi Corporation recorded total revenues of \n\u00a56,146.4 billion  ($62.1 billion)  and  posted  a  consolidated  net  income  of  \u00a5369.9 billion \n($3.7 billion). \n \n19.  The  third  sponsor,  EGCO,  is  Thailand\u2019s  first  independent  power  producer.  It  was \nincorporated in 1992 and was listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand in 1995. EGCO\u2019s major \nshareholders are EGAT (25.4%) and OneEnergy Thailand (22.4%). EGCO has investments in \npower generation and supply, as well as comprehensive energy services providing operation, \nmaintenance, engineering, and construction services to power plants and other industries in \nThailand and overseas. EGCO has a total power generating capacity of 3,836 MW from a total \nof  13  power  plants.  The  company  focuses  its  investments  in  power  generation,  both \ndomestically  and  abroad,  specifically  within  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations \ncountries.  The  company  has  investments  and  subsidiaries  in  four  main  businesses: \n(i) independent power producers (IPPs, 3,507 MW); (ii) small power producers (SPPs, 302 MW); \n(iii) overseas power producers (27 MW); and (iv) other related businesses.  \n \n20.  EGCO  is  regarded  as  a  company  with  high  corporate  governance  standards  and \ntechnical expertise. Through its experience in managing a large portfolio of IPPs and SPPs in \nThailand, EGCO will contribute not only technical expertise but also understanding of the SPP \nProgram and renewable energy policies in Thailand.  \n   2.  Project Design \n21.  The project entails the construction of a 55 MWp solar generation plant in the Lopburi \nprovince of Central Thailand. The development and implementation of the SPP will be covered \nby a 5-year, automatically renewable PPA between EGAT and NED under the SPP Program. \nEGAT will purchase all energy output of the plant up to 55 MW, the maximum defined in the \nPPA. The project will use innovative thin-film photovoltaic technology and is expected to be one \nof the largest solar photovoltaic projects in the world. In addition, the project is working with ADB \nfor the prefinancing of CERs under ADB\u2019s CMI.  \n ", "6 \n  3.  Project Output and Outcome \n22.  The project\u2019s output will be Thailand\u2019s first large, utility-scale solar power generating \nfacility  (55 MWp).  Through  its  development,  construction,  and  operation,  its  personnel  will \nacquire the skills to facilitate the spread of solar power projects in the region.  \n \n23.  The project\u2019s outcome will be the demonstration of the profitability and sustainability of a \nlarge-scale solar power farm. The amount of carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions reduced is one of \n2\nthe indicators, in addition to the usual financial and operations indicators.  \n \nB.  Development Impact \n1.  Contribution to Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction \n24.  The  project\u2019s  impact  will  result  from  the  demonstration  effect  of  the  feasibility  and \nsustainability of a large-scale private sector solar farm, a model that can be replicated by other \nprivate sector investors in Thailand and other DMCs. Through the project itself, as well as \nthrough  the  anticipated  replication,  Thailand\u2019s  energy  mix  will  be  diversified  by  adding \nrenewable energy capacity, thereby helping the country to meet its target of 20.4% of primary \ncommercial energy coming from renewable energy by 2022.  \n2.  Private Sector Development \n25.  Solar energy holds the most potential of all renewable energy sources in Thailand, \npossibly offering more than 50,000 MW of installed capacity (footnote 6). The project will be the \nfirst to demonstrate this unrealized potential for large-scale solar projects to meet power needs \nin the region. The project will establish the commercial viability of large-scale solar farms \nconnected to the grid and set off the necessary growth in the sector by advancing a model that \ncan be replicated by other private sector investors throughout the region.  \n  3.  Economic Sustainability \n26.  The quantifiable economic benefits from the project include the value of power as an \ninput  to  economic  activity,  the  premium  for  solar  power  as  a  stable  source,  and  the \nenvironmental advantage of clean energy. The economic costs include the cost of evacuating \nthe power to the grid. The calculated economic internal rate of return is 12%, higher than the \nsocial discount rate of 10%.16  \n \nC.  Environment and Social Dimensions \n27.  The project has been classified as category B for environment because it is unlikely to \ncreate any significant environmental impact during construction and operation. Although the \nMinistry of Natural Resources and Environment does not require an environmental impact \nassessment for solar power projects, NED commissioned a comprehensive environmental and \nsocial assessment for the project to ensure that the project will be environmentally sound and \nacceptable to the local communities. The environmental and social assessment was completed \nin early December 2009 and its major findings and conclusions are presented in a summary \ninitial environmental examination in Appendix 1. The project location is not within or near any \n                                                 \n16 According to the Good Practice Standards for Private Sector Investment Operations of the Evaluation Cooperation \nGroup (GPS-PIO), a project is satisfactory if its economic internal rate of return is 10% or higher. \n ", "7 \necologically or culturally sensitive area, and the 15 km transmission line will be within the \nexisting right-of-way along the roads. \n \n28.  During  construction,  the  project  will  create  only  minor  and  transient  environmental \ndisturbances such as dust and noise from project site leveling, transportation of materials and \nequipment, assembly of photovoltaic panel supports, construction of a small control building, \nlaying of cables, and installation of inverters and other electrical equipment. At its peak the \nconstruction will require not more than 500 transported workers, most of whom would be hired \nfrom local communities. Domestic wastes from the construction workers will be adequately \nmanaged on-site. The construction will create only a small incremental increase in traffic due to \nthe transportation of materials, which will be managed to ensure public safety. Fugitive dust at \nthe project site will be minimized through frequent water spraying. During operation, the solar \npower plant will not have emissions apart from domestic wastewater from about 40 operating \npersonnel. \n  \n29.  The project is classified as category C for involuntary resettlement. Land required for the \nproject is not occupied and prices have been negotiated with individual landowners on a willing \nbuyer\u2013willing seller basis. The purchase price is based on prevailing market prices, which are \nabove the Department of Land\u2019s appraised prices for land transaction tax purposes. The plant \nwill  be  connected  to  the  existing  Chai  Ba  Dan  2  Substation,  through  a  15 km,  115 kV \ntransmission  line,  which  will  be  built  using  the  right-of-way  of  an  existing  22 kV  line.  No \nindigenous peoples live within or close to the project site; therefore, the project is classified as \ncategory C for indigenous peoples.17 \n \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Power Purchase Agreement \n30.  NED\u2019s net generating capacity is 55 MWp (73 MWp gross capacity), to be sold to EGAT \nunder the SPP program. Under the PPA with EGAT, EGAT has committed itself to buy all \ngenerated electricity from the project up to 55 MW at the regulated PEA wholesale rate18 plus \nan adder incentive for solar projects. The adder incentive (feed-in tariff) of B8 per kWh will apply \nfor 10 years from start of commercial operations. The PPA will contract the parties for an initial \nperiod of 5 years, with continual automatic extensions, unless the NED terminates the PPA or \neither party terminates following a breach of the PPA which is not cured. This PPA is EGAT\u2019s \nstandard  PPA  for  all  similar  SPPs,  and  the  risk  of  nonrenewal  or  renegotiation  may  be \nconsidered minimal since EGAT is obligated to renew the PPA without amendment, unless NED \nis in breach of the PPA. Details of the interconnection, metering, and payment arrangements \nare covered in the PPA.  \n \n31.  EGAT  was  established  in  1969  as  a  state  enterprise  by  the  Electricity  Generating \nAuthority of Thailand Act, B. E. 2511 (1968). EGAT is the country\u2019s largest electricity generator, \nthe  single  wholesale  purchaser  of  electricity,  the  system  operator  and  dispatcher  of  the \ncountry\u2019s system-wide electricity generation, the owner and operator of Thailand\u2019s wholesale \ntransmission network, and the sole supplier of electricity to Thailand\u2019s two electricity distribution \nauthorities, MEA, and PEA. As of 2009, the total installed capacity was 28,482 MW, comprising \n13,615 MW (48%) from EGAT\u2019s power plants, 14,224 MW (50%) from domestic private power \nproducers (IPPs and SPPs), and 640 MW (2%) purchased from neighboring countries. Under \n                                                 \n17 In Thailand, the majority of indigenous peoples are hill tribes in the northern region. \n18 The current wholesale tariff is B3.84 for peak generation and B2.03 for off-peak generation. \n ", "8 \nthe Renewable Portfolio Standard, EGAT must produce or purchase 5% of its new generating \ncapacity in 2008\u20132010 from renewable sources. To meet this obligation EGAT must produce or \npurchase 140.7 MW of renewable energy, from sources such as private power producers under \nthe  SPP  Program,  including  this  project.  EGAT\u2019s  transmission  network  comprises \n30,219 circuit-kilometer lines and 209 high-voltage substations. EGAT has maintained a high \nstandard of system reliability.  \n \n32.  EGAT is rated BBB+/negative19 for foreign currency obligations and BBB+/negative for \nlocal currency obligations by Standard & Poor\u2019s. EGAT has never defaulted on any of its debt \nobligations and is considered one of the strongest off-takers in ADB\u2019s DMCs. EGAT receives \nsovereign support from the Government of Thailand and this support is expected to continue \nbecause of (i) the dominant and important service EGAT provides to the electricity sector, and \nto a large extent to the Thai economy as a whole; (ii) the legislative requirement that obligates \nthe  government  to  cover  any  deficiencies  in  its  cash  flows;20 (iii) the  current  government \nguarantees for its debt obligations;21 and (iv) the government\u2019s financial interest in the wholly \nowned state utility. For these reasons, EGAT\u2019s credit ratings are likely to remain linked to the \nsovereign ratings of the Government of Thailand. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n2.  Selected Photovoltaic Technology  \n33.  A solar cell is an electronic device which directly converts the sunlight into electricity \nthrough the \"photoelectric effect\" thus the solar cell produces both current and voltage to \ngenerate  electric  power.  This  process  requires  a  special  material,  a  photosensitive \nsemiconductor enriched with other complementary elements, in which the absorption of light \nraises their electrons to a higher energy state. These electrons move from the solar cell into an \nexternal electrical circuit, dissipate their energy there, return unloaded to the cell and begin the \nprocess over again. The silicon material used for solar cells can be single-crystalline, multi-\ncrystalline, poly-crystalline or amorphous.  The two main categories of technology are defined \nby the choice of the semiconductor\u2014either crystalline silicon in wafer form or thin films of other \nmaterials. \n \n(i)  Monocrystalline  silicon.  This  is  the  most  efficient  technology  to  date.  The \nphotovoltaic cell is made from single crystals of silicon. Research cells have \nreached nearly 28% efficiency; commercial modules of single-crystal cells, more \nthan 18%. \n \n(ii)  Multi-crystalline silicon. Multi-crystalline silicon is manufactured more cheaply \nthan monocrystalline silicon, with the cells being cut from an ingot of melted and \nrecrystallized silicon. These cells are less efficient than single-crystal silicon cells. \nResearch  cells  approach  24%  efficiency,  and  commercial  modules,  16% \nefficiency. \n \n(iii)  Thin  film.  Various  materials,  such  as  amorphous  silicon,  cadmium  telluride \n(CdTe),  and  copper  indium  diselenide  (CIS),  are  used  to  make  thin-film \n                                                 \n19 S&P revised its outlook to negative on 2 December 2008 after taking similar action on the sovereign credit ratings \nfor Thailand, which is rated BBB+/negative.  \n20 EGAT Act contemplates that budget support may be available if EGAT cannot obtain funds from other sources.  \n21 Sovereign guarantees cover all of EGAT\u2019s foreign debt and about half of its domestic debt.  \n ", "9 \nphotovoltaic cells. These are technologies with lower efficiencies than those for \ncrystalline silicon photovoltaic cells but have cheaper material costs.  \n \n34.  The sponsors have selected thin-film photovoltaic technology after in-depth analysis of \nlocal conditions, on-site measurements, and competitive bidding. Amorphous silicon thin-film \nsolar cells will be used in the project. Thin-film technology was selected for the following \nreasons.  Thin-film  solar  cells  are  relatively  lower  in  production  cost  than  other  types  of \nphotovoltaic  cells.  Moreover,  thin-film  photovoltaic  cells  are  better  at  absorbing  sunlight \napproaching  the  cell  from  different  directions  and  at  maintaining  efficiency  under  different \nirradiations.  Therefore,  thin-film  photovoltaic  technology  better  suits  Thailand\u2019s  climatic \nenvironment  (irradiation  profile)  because  it  does  not  require  near-perfect  solar  conditions. \nClouds and overcast conditions at times create diffuse light, which cannot be concentrated but \nstill produces energy on thin-film photovoltaic panels. Besides irradiation, thin-film solar cells \noffer better relative performance in climates with higher average temperatures. In general, solar \ncells become less able to convert the solar energy into electrical power (conversion efficiency) \nas the temperature increases. Thin-film solar cells, however, decrease in conversion efficiency \nmore slowly than other solar cells.  \n \n35.  The  market  for  thin-film  solar  cells  has  been  growing  rapidly.  In  recent  years, \nmanufacturers of thin-film solar cells have brought production costs down and tried to achieve \ncompetitive strengths through more advanced thin-film technology. This is evidenced by the \nrapid growth in market share of thin-film solar cells in the United States, to 44% in 2006 from \nless  than  10%  in  2003.  The  European  Photovoltaic  Industry  Association  expects  annual \nproduction capacity for thin-film technology to double to more than 4 GW by 2010. Overall, solar \nphotovoltaic  installations  reached  a  record  high  of  15  GW  in  2008.  Europe\u2019s  installed \nphotovoltaic  capacity  of  9 GW  is  65%  of  this  total,  Japan\u2019s  2.1 GW  is  15%,  and  the \nUnited States\u2019 1.2 GW is 8%. \n3.  Engineering, Procurement, and Construction \n36.  After  competitive  bidding,  the  sponsors  have  selected  Sharp  Corporation  and  the \nItalian-Thai  Development  Public  Company  (ITD)  as  the  engineering,  procurement,  and \nconstruction (EPC) contractors. They will use thin-film photovoltaic cells produced by Sharp.22 \nSharp will provide the key items of equipment (including the solar panels), and ITD will provide \nall onshore construction and engineering services. Sharp and ITD are jointly and severally liable \nunder the supply and construction arrangements. The project will be implemented under a \nfixed-price, date-certain EPC contract, which will include adequate performance guarantees for \non-time completion and a 25-year performance warranty for the photovoltaic modules.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n                                                 \n22 The EPC contracting process is almost complete, but the final EPC contract has not yet been signed. To make \nroom for negotiation and optimize the final terms of the EPC contract, the sponsors are negotiating in parallel other \nproposals for alternative technologies including crystalline photovoltaic technology. In the unlikely event that the \nsponsors change the EPC arrangement after the report and recommendation of the President is circulated to the \nBoard or after it is approved, the project will be resubmitted to ADB\u2019s Investment Committee before the loan \nagreement is signed.  \n ", "10 \nFigure 1: Worldwide Solar Cell Production Volume by \nCompany\nn \no\ncti W)700\ndu M600\nPro me (450000\nc  u 300\nai ol\nolt V 120000\nv\no 0\nt\no\nPh Q.

It has more than 50 years of experience in the \nconstruction industry and has a strong track record in construction projects for both private \nclients and government authorities. Its major projects include structural works for the Gheco \nOne power plant, the North Bangkok power plant, the Bangkok Metropolitan Rapid Transit, His \nMajesty the King\u2019s 80th Birthday Anniversary Stadium, the Bangkok Skytrain,  the passenger \nterminal  and  concourse  of  Bangkok\u2019s  Suvarnabhumi  Airport,  and  the  Nam  Theun  2 \nHydroelectric Dam in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. Italthai Engineering, a related \ncompany,  specializes  in  utility  engineering  contracting  and  has  completed  a  number  of \nengineering projects for EGAT, PEA, and MEA. ITD is rated BBB+ (negative) by TRIS. The \nrating  reflects  ITD\u2019s  dominant  position  as  the  largest  construction  contractor  and  its  high \nfinancial leverage. ITD\u2019s key financials on a consolidated basis from 2005 to 2008 are provided \nin Table 1.  \n \n38.  Operation  and  maintenance. The operation and maintenance requirement of solar \nfarms is minimal and is not expected to present major technical challenges, unlike the operation \nand maintenance of conventional power projects. For grid-connected photovoltaic systems, the \nelectrical  inverter  used  to  produce  alternating  current  from  direct  current  needs  some \nmaintenance  support,23 but  the  photovoltaic  solar  panels  are  designed  to  operate  without \nmaintenance except for cleaning. An experienced and reputable operation and maintenance \ncontractor will be appointed after competitive bidding. In addition, specialists from the solar cell \ntechnology vendor (Sharp) will train the staff to ensure the smooth operation of the plant.   \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n23 Especially in tropical areas, where the electrical earthing system will have an important protective role (during \ntropical thunderstorms).  \n ", "11 \nTable 1: Consolidated Financial Performance \nof Italian-Thai Development Public Company \n(B million) \nYear Ended 31 \nDecember  2005  2006  2007  2008  3Q/2009 \nTotal revenue  37,985 39,817 45,623 42,855 29,343 \nGross profit  2,427 1,341 3,241 655 1,531 \nNet profit  1,262 (2,146) 1,074 (2,678)  44 \nTotal assets  42,412 50,653 52,987 57,230 54,766 \nTotal liabilities  25,240 35,671 36,170 44,535 41,420 \nTotal equity  17,171 14,982 16,817 12,695 13,346 \n( ) = negative. \nSources: Annual reports of Italian-Thai Development Public Company. \n \n39.

A 115 kV line \nconnecting to this substation, using the right-of-way of an existing 22 kV line, will be built. PEA \nis expected to be appointed to build the transmission line and the electrical connection to \nEGAT\u2019s  network  system,  including  a  termination  bay,  revenue  metering  devices,  and \nteleprotection devices. The interconnection costs will be borne by the project. \n4.  Anticorruption Policy and Policy Combating Money Laundering and the \nFinancing of Terrorism \n40.  NED was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and policy \nrelating  to  the  Combating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  (2003). \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire NED to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following \ninternational  best-practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities. The loan documentation between ADB and NED will further allow \nADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \n41.  The project sponsors have expressed their interest in working actively with ADB on an \nintegrated basis, including debt financing through ADB, a GCI from the Clean Energy Financing \nPartnership  Facility,  and  possible  carbon  credit\u2013based  cofinancing  through  ADB\u2019s  Future \nCarbon  Fund.  The  project  will  therefore  allow  ADB  and  the  Clean  Energy  Program  to \ndemonstrate the range and depth of products that ADB can provide for renewable energy \nprojects in the DMCs. \nA.  The Assistance \n1.   Loan or Guarantee \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n ", "12 \n \n42.  The proposed ADB facility of up to $70 million equivalent in baht or 25% of total project \ncosts,  whichever  is  lower,  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  without \ngovernment guarantee. Interest during the grace period may be capitalized. The loan may be \ndisbursed in baht or in dollars if for any reason baht is not available. \n \n2.  Grant Component of Investment \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n43.  While there are no fuel costs during the operating phase, solar technology requires very \nhigh  investment  costs  up front.  These  comparatively  high  costs  make  the  technology  less \neconomically  attractive  to  private  sector  investors  aiming  for  larger-scale  solar  operations, \nbecause they entail significant risks. Power projects need contingency funds to cover risks that \nare directly related to total project capital expenditure. For solar power projects, the contingency \nfunds per MW of installed generation capacity are large because of their very high capital \nexpenditures. Moreover, this will be a first-mover project: it will be one of the largest photovoltaic \npower  plants  in  the  world  and  will  use  highly  complex,  innovative  thin  film  photovoltaic \ntechnology. The project will therefore bear additional risks, which will also have to be covered by \ncontingency funds to provide comfort to private sector investors and lenders. A conventional \ngas-fired power plant in Thailand requires contingency funds of only $15,000\u2013$20,000 per MW \nof installed capacity, versus $200,000 for the project. These contingency funds have to be \nfinanced and will involve financing costs in the case that they have to be drawn down, resulting \nin incremental risks to the Project's debt service capability and therefore constitute a barrier to \nthe financing and implementation of the Project.  \n \n44.  The proposed GCI from the Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing \nPartnership Facility (footnote 1), amounting to $2 million would support the implementation of \nthe project, which will be the first to demonstrate the capacity of a large-scale solar project to \nmeet  the  power  needs  in  Thailand,  and  to  prove  the  feasibility  of  thin-film  photovoltaic \ntechnology for utility-scale power generation. Specifically, the CEFPF funds would cover a \nportion of the contingency in the event that the project has to draw down additional funds for \nproject costs, which represents a key risk associated with solar power projects and a barrier to \ntheir funding and implementation, as mentioned above. The CEFPF funds may be applied \ndirectly  by  NED  to  cover  additional  project  costs  being  ADB  member  country  goods  and \nservices for up to $2 million.  ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to tie) will apply to \nthe GCI funds. The CEFPF funds may help to overcome the gap and significantly reduce an \ninherent risk of introducing new thin-film photovoltaic technology on a large scale. However, if \nthe project can be implemented successfully without drawing down the contingency funds, the \nCEFPF funds will not be used and can be allocated to another project.  \n \n45.  This innovative structure may ease the critical constraint on solar power investment by \nincreasing the confidence of private sector investors in the sustainability of the new technology, \nwhile pursuing private sector efficiency and commercial independence without subsidy in the \noriginal implementation plan.  \n \n3.  Clean Development Mechanism  \n \n46.  The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), established under the Kyoto Protocol and \nmanaged  by  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change,  will  provide \n ", "13 \nadditional financing for the development of renewable energy projects. The proposed project is \nlikely to be eligible for carbon financing. \n \n47.  ADB has taken several initiatives to bring climate change considerations into its funding \nmainstream. The current CDM support program of ADB is administered through the CMI, and \nmanaged  by  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department.  The  CMI  has  four \ncomponents: (i) up-front carbon financing through the Asia Pacific Carbon Fund (APCF) for \npre-2012 carbon credits, (ii) up-front carbon financing through FCF for post-2012 carbon credits, \n(iii) CDM-related technical support through the technical support facility, and (iv) marketing \nsupport for residual carbon credits through the credit marketing facility. \n \n48.  The APCF is a fund established and managed by ADB that cofinances CDM projects in \nthe DMCs by securing a portion of the expected future CERs from CDM-eligible projects (those \ngenerated up to 31 December 2012) in exchange for up-front financing. The FCF can similarly \nprovide up-front financing by purchasing a portion of the first credits that will be generated from \n1 January 2013 to 31 December 2020. The technical support facility provides comprehensive \ntechnical support to project sponsors in developing CDM-eligible projects, thus contributing to a \ncontinuous pipeline of \u201cviable\u201d clean energy projects that may be considered for ADB financing \nand up-front funding from the APCF or the FCF. The credit marketing facility provides marketing \nsupport  to  project  sponsors  in  obtaining  optimal  prices  and  sale  terms  from  third-party \npurchasers of residual CERs not purchased by the APCF or the FCF. \n \n49.  The  estimates  of  CER  potential  are  based  on  the  available  CDM  methodology, \nACM0002. Emission reductions under the proposed project, up to 2012 based on a 10 year \ncrediting period starting on the date of commissioning of the full plant,24 are estimated at \n33,300 tons of CO  equivalent (tCO e). At a reasonably conservative payment-on-delivery price \n2 2\nof $15 per tCO e, this could mean revenues of about $0.50 million for the project up to 2012. \n2\nADB\u2019s Asia Pacific Carbon Fund could purchase up to 50% of CERs up front. \n \n50.  After  2012,  emission  reductions  are  estimated  at  400,000  tCO e  up  to  2020  and \n2\n66,700 tCO e  after  2020  (based  on  a  10  year  crediting  period  starting  on  the  date  of \n2\ncommissioning  of  the  full  plant).  These  may  amount  to  some  $4.8  million  (assuming  a \nreasonably conservative payment-on-delivery price of $12 per tCO e up to 2020 and of $0 \n2\nbeyond 2020). ADB\u2019s Future Carbon Fund may consider purchasing a share of up to 50% of the \nexpected post-2012 CERs up to and including 2020, and pay in advance against delivery of the \nfirst CERs. The terms and conditions for such a potential carbon transaction must be approved \nby the FCF board of directors. \n \n                                                 \n24 Construction of the plant will be implemented phase by phase with 1 month gap from phase 1 to phase 7.

Compliance with Investment Limitations \n51.  The proposed transaction, once approved and signed, will increase ADB's projected \nnonsovereign exposure by the end of 2010 to $4.2 billion. Additionally, the proposed transaction \nwill increase nonsovereign exposure to the Kingdom of Thailand to $0.2 billion or 3.5% of total \nnonsovereign  exposure  and  will  increase  nonsovereign  exposure  in  the  Renewal  Energy \nGeneration subsector to $0.3 billion or 6.2% of total nonsovereign exposure. The proposed \nfinancing is within ADB\u2019s approved medium-term, country, industry, single obligor and group \nexposure limits for nonsovereign operations. ADB will ensure that the proposed financing up to \na maximum of $70 million will not exceed 25% of total project cost limit at any given point in time. \nB.  Justification for ADB Assistance \n52.  The project merits ADB\u2019s support for the following reasons: \n  \n(i)  The project supports the government\u2019s strategy of promoting renewable energy to help \nmeet the government\u2019s target for 20.4% of primary commercial energy to come from \nrenewable energy sources by 2022.  \n \n(ii)  ADB assistance will play a crucial role in helping the project to obtain financial close and \nappropriate long-term financing, which is a necessary condition for the viability of a solar \nproject. Due to the recent credit crunch, bank liquidity is limited, and local banks can \nrarely provide loans for more than 10-12 years. However, tenors required for solar power \ngeneration projects are significantly longer. ADB's long-term local currency loan or, in the \nalternative, guarantee give NED the tenors it needs in order to fund a power generation \nplant that has high upfront investment costs, but no ongoing fuel cost. Without the \navailability of ADB's long-term loans, the proposed prefinanced CERs from FCF and the \n ", "15 \nproposed CGI, it is unlikely that the project would meet the Sponsors' minimum hurdle \nrates to implement the project. \n \n(iii)  ADB's facility (or PCG if required) encourages the commitment of local commercial banks, \nwhich have less experience in clean energy projects. Therefore ADB's participation in the \ndebt financing will help facilitating local and/or international bank participation.  \n \n(iv)  The project will pioneer in demonstrating the commercial viability of large-scale private \nsector solar farms, a model that other private sector investors can then replicate elsewhere \nin the region. The proposed project will be the first large-scale power generation project \ntapping into Thailand\u2019s abundant solar resource, which has more than 50,000 MW of \npotential power generation capacity. \n \n(v)  The project supports the government energy strategy to diversify its energy mix and \nincrease security of supply from national resources. Thailand currently relies heavily on \nnatural gas and lignite to a lesser extent as its major sources of fuel for power generation. \n \n(vi)  ADB assistance for the project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Country Partnership Strategy for \nThailand 2007\u20132011 (footnote 13) and Country Operations Business Plan,25 where the \nthree core strategic areas of partnership are infrastructure development, environmentally \nsustainable development and capital markets development.  \nC.  Assurances \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n \n53.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \nCharter),26 the  government  has  been  requested  to  confirm  that  it  has  no  objection  to  the \nproposed assistance to NED. No funding will be disbursed and no guarantee will become \neffective  until  ADB  receives  such  confirmation.

Introduction \n1.  The Natural Energy Development Company (NED) has initiated a solar power plant \nproject to be located on about 176 hectares of land (about 1,100 rais1) about 200 kilometers (km) \nnorth of Bangkok in Wang Plerng Subdistrict, Khok Samrong District, Lopburi Province. The \nproject is designed to have a gross generation capacity of 73 megawatts (MWp) of direct current. \nThe alternating current output will be about 57.9 MW, of which about 2.9 MW will be consumed \ninternally and the remaining 55 MW will be sold to the Electricity Generating Authority  of \nThailand (EGAT) through a 115 kilovolt (kV) transmission line to a Provincial Electricity Authority \n(PEA) substation about 15 km away. The project construction is expected to begin in the second \nquarter of 2010 and will take about 24 months to complete.  \n \n2.  The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment does not require an environmental \nimpact  assessment  for  solar  power  projects.  Nevertheless,  NED  commissioned  a  local \nconsulting firm2 to undertake an environmental and social assessment (ESA) of the project to \nensure that the project will be absolutely environmentally sound and acceptable to the local \ncommunities.  The  ESA  was  conducted  from  August  2009  to  early  December  2009.  This \nsummary  initial  environmental  examination  (SIEE)  document  summarizes  the  findings  and \nconclusions of the ESA. The SIEE was prepared for the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in full \ncompliance  with  its  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  for  category  B3 projects  and  the \ngovernment\u2019s environmental policy, guidelines, and requirements, as well as the World Bank \nGroup\u2019s Environmental, Health, and Safety Guidelines (EHS guidelines). \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n  1.  Project Scope and Layout \n3.  The  project  will  involve  minor  civil  works,  the  installation  of  about  542,000  solar \nphotovoltaic panels and associated power equipment, and the construction of a control building. \nTable A1.1 presents the salient features of the project; Table A1.2, land use by the project \nfacilities; Figure A1.1, a flow diagram of solar power generation; and Figure A1.2, the layout of \nthe project facilities. \n \n                                                 \n1 The rai is a Thai measure for land area.

Construction \n4.  The project will involve site preparation (with minimum disturbance to existing land \nforms), the construction of small solar panel foundations, the installation of solar panels, the \nconstruction  of  one  control  building,  the  construction  of  one  22 kV/115 kV  substation,  the \nconstruction of inspection roads and drainage systems, the laying of electrical cables, the \ninstallation of control systems, and the construction of a 115 kV transmission line on the corridor \nof an existing 22 kV transmission line. These construction works are minor and will take place \nover the vast project site.

Description of the Environment \n1.  Project Location \n5.  The project site covers 1,100 rais (about 176 hectares) of privately owned agricultural \nland, located next to Rural Road No. 3014 and surrounded by agricultural land. The project site \nhas no irrigation system and is used mainly for planting cash crops, particularly cassava and \nmaize, and also eucalyptus trees. Some parts are unattended land covered by grasses, bushes, \nand shrubs.  \n2.  Physical Environment \n6.  The project site has a humid tropical climate with annual average temperatures ranging \nfrom 23.6\u00b0C to 33.7\u00b0C, average annual rainfall of 1,123.8 millimeters, and annual average \nrelative humidity of 71%. Soil in the project site is of low to medium fertility. The project site is in \na low-seismic-risk region. \n \n7.  Surface water at the project site is drained by two small, unnamed natural watercourses. \nOne watercourse traverses the western part of the project site in a south\u2013north direction, and \ndrains water into a natural canal. Another watercourse traverses the eastern part of the project \nsite in a south\u2013north direction, and drains water into another canal.  \n \n8.  The project site still has good environmental quality as it has no nearby industries or \nurban communities. The two watercourses in the project site are still virtually unpolluted, as \nindicated by the low levels of biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, and oil and \ngrease. The dust level in the ambient air, measured as total suspended particulates (TSP), is \nstill lower than the national standard of 0.33 mg/Nm3 (24-hour average). Ambient noise levels in \nthe three nearest communities are below the national standards 24-hour not exceeding 70 dBA \nper 24 hours, and maximum not exceeding 115 dBA. \n3.  Biological Environment \n9.  The project site is not located in or near a sensitive ecosystem. An ecological survey of \nthe project site confirmed the absence of unique or ecologically significant flora and fauna. The \nnearest wildlife sanctuary, Sublanka, is about 60 km away. \n ", "Appendix 1  21 \n4.  Socioeconomic Environment \n10.  The project site has no communities. Two subdistricts, Wang Plerng and Khao Laem, \nare within a 5 km radius of the project site. Wang Plerng has 13 villages with a total population \nof 7,536 living in 1,963 households (April 2009 records). Khao Laem has 8 villages with a total \npopulation  of  3,298  living  in  940  households  (April  2009  records).  Barn  Chonmuang  in \nWang  Plerng Subdistrict, about 650 meters away, is the community nearest to the project site. \nThere are no indigenous peoples living within or close to the project site. About 90% of the \nhouseholds rely on agriculture as their main source of income.  \n  5.  Historical and Cultural Value \n11.  The project site and the surrounding areas have no important historical or cultural sites. \nThere are no records of archeological findings. \nD.  Environmental Impact and Mitigation Measures \n1.  Impact during Construction \n12.  The project will involve only minor civil, mechanical, and electrical works taking place at \nmany locations within a vast project site. The site preparation will involve only minor leveling, \nand thus will not significantly change the drainage pattern. The transportation of construction \nmaterials and project equipment will require about 15 truck trips per day during the working \nperiod  of  8  hours.  Considering  the  nature  and  scope  of  the  construction  works  and  the \necological  insensitivity  of  the  project  site,  it  is  certain  that  only  minor  and  manageable \nenvironmental disturbances will be created during construction, with minimum impact on nearby \ncommunities and the natural environment. Environmental disturbances during construction will \nbe small and transient, such as dust, noise, incremental traffic loads on the roads, and gaseous \nemissions created by trucks and heavy construction equipment. Estimates of the incremental \nincreases in ambient dust and noise levels during construction were made and were found to be \nmarginal. The ambient dust level will increase by 23.51 micrograms per cubic meter and noise \nby 0.7 dBA at the nearest community. \n \n13.  As the 15 km, 115 kV transmission line will be constructed within the corridor of an \nexisting 22 kV transmission line of PEA, there will be no need for any land acquisition or \nclearance. The transmission line will therefore create minimum transient environmental and \nsocial impact. \n \n14.  The construction will require not more than 500 workers, who will reside outside the \nproject site. No groundwater will be tapped at the project site as the project site has low \ngroundwater potential. The water required for construction (concrete mixing) and consumption \nwill be brought in from outside sources. Domestic wastewater generated by the construction \nworkers would not be more than 20 cubic meters per day  and will be treated either in a small \ncentralized package treatment plant or by individual septic tanks, one for each toilet. \n \n15.  The nature of the construction works indicates that no toxic or hazardous materials will \nbe used, apart from fuel oils for vehicles, which will be properly stored. Construction wastes will \nbe sorted out by the contractors for recycling. The residual wastes will be properly handled by \nthe relevant municipal units for waste disposal. \n ", "22  Appendix 1 \n2.  Impact during Operations \n16.  Unlike thermal power plants, the operation of the project solar power plant will have \nnegligible environmental impact on the site during operation. There will be no waste products, \nno requirements for cooling, no moving parts, no noise, and no impact on flora and fauna. The \nlargest impact could be visual. However, as the project site and the surrounding areas have no \nnatural  beauty,  visual  impairment  would  not  be  a  problem.  With  an  old  design  of  solar \nphotovoltaic arrays, reflected sunlight may cause problems if the system is close to a road and \nis facing in a direction in which the reflected sunlight may cause problems. This problem will not \noccur in this project as its solar photovoltaic panels are of new design, which can absorb \nsunlight and eliminate sunlight reflections.  \n \n17.  The project will use transformers of forced-oil and forced-air-cool designs, which do not \nuse polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB). Therefore, there will be no PCB disposal problem.  \n \n18.  Only about 40 staff will operate the project facilities. Domestic wastes generated by this \nsmall number of people could be readily handled by conventional practices. \nE.  Social Impact \n19.  The project has no resettlement or indigenous peoples (IPs) issues. In August 2009, the \nproject entered into a land purchase option agreement4 with all 11 landowners to purchase the \nland on a willing-buyer-willing-seller basis, valid for 8 months with a 4-month extension period. \nThe landowners will be allowed to harvest their crops before the project starts construction, in \nline with the requirements of the ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) for negotiated \nsettlement. Only one owner lives on his land and will be allowed to stay on and be employed by \nthe project. Therefore, there will be no relocation issue. The project site has no people identified \nas IPs. The project is therefore expected to be classified as category C for both involuntary \nresettlement and IPs. \nF.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Management Plan \n20.  As  the  project  is  virtually  environmentally  benign,  the  institutional  requirements  for \nenvironmental management during construction and operation will be minimal. Nevertheless, \nthe project plans to apply for environmental accreditation through ISO14000.  \n \n21.  During construction, the contractors will be contractually mandated to minimize transient \nenvironmental disturbances, using known conventional methods such as water spraying to \nminimize dust, the imposition of speed limits on vehicles in the project site, the provision of an \nadequate number of bathrooms and toilets for construction workers, the proper management of \ndomestic wastes (particularly the disposal of food wastes), and the imposition of sanitation and \nwork  safety  rules  and  regulations.  The  project  manager  of  NED  will  closely  monitor  the \ncontractors\u2019 compliance with the environmental and safety clauses of the contracts. TSP levels \nin the ambient air and noise levels in the nearest communities will be occasionally monitored \nduring construction. \n \n                                                 \n4 Thus, the sponsors have reached an agreement with the farmers that the project may buy the land at a certain price \nif the project is implemented.  \n ", "Appendix 1  23 \n22.  During the project operation, environmental management will mostly involve domestic \nwastes created by about 40 staff. This matter can be readily handled. \nG.  Public Consultation and Disclosures \n23.  During the conduct of the ESA, two public consultation meetings were held at the two \nsubdistricts. In addition, a field survey was also carried out to collect basic socioeconomic \ninformation at the household level and solicit views on the project. Information from the public \nconsultation meetings and the field surveys is summarized in Table A1.3. \n \nTable A1.3: Public Consultation Meetings and Field Surveys \nSubdistrict  Date  Number of Participants \nWang Plerng  31 August 09  71 \n  2 October 09  65 \nKhao Laem  16 September 09  114 \n  21 October 09  188 \nField  Surveys  (the  two  26\u201330 September 09  66 community leaders and \nsubdistricts)  local government officials \n    347 persons \n       Source: Natural Energy Development Company  \n \n24.  As  the  project  will  have  no  significant  environmental  and  social  impact,  the  local \ncommunities  and  community  leaders  did  not  oppose  the  project.  They,  however,  sought \nassistance in community development and support for community cultural events.  \nH.  Findings and Recommendations \n25.  The ESA findings establish that the project site is a relatively infertile agricultural land, is \nnot located in a sensitive ecosystem, and has no historical or cultural value. This nature of the \nproject site, coupled with the clean nature of solar power generation, confirms that the project \nwill not cause any significant, lasting environmental and social impact. Only minor and transient \nenvironmental disturbances will be generated in the project site during construction, and will be \nminimized through established control measures to be implemented by the contractors. It is \ntherefore recommended that the project be considered environmentally and socially feasible, \nand that the IEE be considered adequate to justify environmental and social clearance of the \nproject. There is no need for further analysis, and the environmental and social assessment of \nthe project is considered complete. \nI.  Conclusions \n26.  It is concluded that the project has no further environmental and social issues to follow \nup, and will fully comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  \n \n "], "metadata": {"Author": "Asian Development Bank", "CreationDate": "D:20100827144536+08'00'", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "ModDate": "D:20100830115435+08'00'", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0 (Windows)", "Title": "Report and Recommendation of the President: Thailand, Proposed Loan and Administration of Grant for Solar Power Project"}, "author_page": " \nPRC  \u2013  People\u2019s Republic of China \nPSOD  \u2013  Private Sector Operations Department \nRPS  \u2013  Renewable Portfolio Standard \nSPP  \u2013  small power producer \nVSPP  \u2013  very small power producer \n \n \nWEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n  GWh  \u2013  gigawatt-hour \n  km  \u2013  kilometer \n  kV  \u2013  kilovolt \n  kWh  \u2013  kilowatt-hour \n  MWp  \u2013  megawatt peak \nNOTES \n(i)  The borrower\u2019s fiscal year (FY) ends on 31 December.  \n(ii)  In this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars.  \n \n \nVice-President  X.
