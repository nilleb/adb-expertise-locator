It  will  have  four  main  components:  (i)  a  regulatory  framework \nand  fully  operational  quality  and  safety  system  for  agro-products;  (ii) \ninfrastructure  and  facilities  for  safe,  quality  agro-products;  (iii)  improved \nsafety and reduced health hazards from livestock waste through support for \ndevelopment  of  biogas  plants  by  small  livestock  farmers;  and  (iv)  project \nmanagement  support  for  effective  and  timely  implementation  of  project \ninterventions.    The  Project  will  cover  16  provinces  in  Viet  Nam  that  have \nsignificant fruit, vegetable, and tea production.     \n \nConsumers  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s  major  population  centers  require  that  certain \nquality and safety standards be met in the fruit, vegetable and tea products \nthey  consume,  but  poor  regulatory  management,  unsafe  production \nenvironments,  and  excessive  levels  of  agro-chemicals  and  fertilizers, \nincluding  application  of  pesticides  by  Viet  Nam\u2019s  farmers,  are  major \nhindrances  to  achieving  the  required  standards.  This  will  affect  the  long-\nterm  growth  prospects  of  these  crops  in  a  competitive  production  and \ntrading  regime.  Viet  Nam  has  one  of  the  highest  input  use  rates  among \ncountries  in  the  Asia  and  Pacific  region.  In  the  absence  of  management \nand  regulations,  these  high  input  levels  are  affecting  product  quality  and \nsafety. In addition, unsafe disposal of livestock waste in densely populated \nareas has contaminated soils and the water used for agricultural products. \nlivestock  waste  disposal  and  promotion  of \nConsequently, \ntechnologies \nis  a \nprerequisite to enhancement of the quality and safety of agro-products.  \n\ntreatment  and  management \n\nfor  effective  waste \n\nimproved \n\n\f \n\n \n\nImpact and \nOutcome \n\n \nProject \nInvestment Plan  \n\nto \n\nimprove \n\nThese  issues  are  not  being  effectively  addressed  due  to  the  lack  of  a \ndomestic  \u201csafe  food\u201d  supply  framework  and/or  strategy,  and  will  have \ncontinuing  negative  impacts  on  the  environment  and  public  health  if  not \naddressed.  Increasing  integration  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  agricultural  production, \nprocessing  and  marketing  with  international  markets  makes  it  critical  that \nimprovements in product quality and food safety be made, if Viet Nam is to \nmaintain  and/or  increase  its  international  market  share.  Improving  global \ncompetitiveness  will  require  strengthening  of  the  capacity  of  concerned \ninstitutions at all levels of government to address the following issues, all of \nwhich constrain further growth in the agriculture sector: (i) numerous small \nand  fragmented  agricultural  production  units,  (ii)  low  product  quality  and \nsafety,  (iii)  inefficient  marketing,  and  (iv)  weak  bargaining  power.  These \ncause  inefficiencies  in  product  marketing  and  input  procurement,  and \nincrease  the  costs  to  the  Government  and  the  private  sector  of  providing \nagricultural support services.  \n \nThe  Government  acknowledges  the  urgent  need  to  improve  agricultural \nproduction and marketing quality and food safety to a level comparable with \nneighboring countries and trade competitors. The Government is gradually \nintroducing  measures \nthe  performance  of  state-owned \nenterprises under the State-Owned Enterprise Law, but constrained access \nto  financial  and  other  resources  remains  a  serious  obstacle  to  the \npromotion of viable private business opportunities in Viet Nam.  \n \nThe  proposed  Project  is  consistent  with  the  ideals  of  the  Government\u2019s \nstrategies  and  policies, \nthe  Government\u2019s  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment  Plan  (SEDP)  2006\u20132010,  which  seeks  to  achieve  middle-\nincome  status  for  Viet  Nam  by  2010  through  improvements  in  the  quality \nand safety of agricultural and processed products that meet domestic and \ninternational requirements. \n \n \nThe expected impact is sustainable and equitable growth of the agriculture \nsector  through  increased  livelihood  opportunities  and  improved  human \nhealth. The Project is expected to increase the agriculture sector\u2019s annual \naggregate  value-added  by  about  3.0%\u20133.2%  during  2016\u20132020,  and \nincrease agricultural exports by 12.3%\u201314.3% over the same period, in line \nwith the Government's 5-year socio-economic development plan. It is also \nexpected to contribute to a reduction in the poverty incidence in the project \narea from 19% to 10% over the same period.  \n \nThe  expected  outcome  is  quality  and  safety  improvements  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s \nagricultural  outputs,  which \ninternational \nrequirements. \n \n \nThe Project investment cost is estimated at $110.39 million, including taxes \nand duties of $8.67 million.  \n \n\nthereby  meet  domestic  and \n\nincluding \n\n\fFinancing Plan \n\nIt  is  proposed  that  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provide  a  loan  of  \n$95.0  million  (equivalent  of  62.4  million  special  drawing  rights)  from  its \nSpecial  Funds  resources  to  cover  86.06%  of  the  total  project  costs.  The \nGovernment will contribute $6.22 million, accounting for 5.64% of the total \nproject  costs,  of  which  $3.98  million  is  contributed  by  way  of  taxes  and \nduties.  The provincial  people\u2019s  committees  in  the  16  project  provinces  will \ncontribute  $6.47  million,  accounting  for  5.86%  of  the  total  project  cost, \nincluding $4.69 million in taxes and duties. Partner financial intermediaries \nwill contribute $1.35 million, accounting for 1.22% of the total project cost, \nto finance biogas loans to households. Beneficiaries of biogas development \ncomponent  will  contribute  $1.35  million  in  local  materials  and/or  labor, \naccounting  for  1.22%  of  the  total  project  costs.  The  ADB  loan  will  have  a \nmaturity of 32 years with a grace period of 8 years, and an interest rate of \n1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  thereafter.  The \nGovernment  will  bear  the  foreign  exchange  risk.

A  central  project \nmanagement  unit  (CPMU)  will  be  established  in  the  Agricultural  Projects \nManagement  Board \nfor  overall  project  coordination  and \nmanagement.  A  total  of  16  provincial  project  management  units  will  be \nthe  provincial  departments  of  agriculture  and  rural \nestablished \ndevelopment  (DARDs)  for  local  project  management.  The  Department  of \nCrop  Production  (DCP)  will  establish  an  institutional  project  management \nunit  (IPMU)  to  implement  activities  related  to  institutional  and  regulatory \ndevelopments  on  quality  and  safety.  The  Department  of  Livestock \nProduction (DLP) will establish a biogas project management unit (BPMU) \nto implement a biogas development  program. A  credit line provided under \nthe  Project  will  be  administered  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  and \nutilized  by  partner  financial  intermediaries  to  finance  eligible  household \nbiogas  investments,  which  will  be  carried  out  at  the  local  level  by  its \nprovincial  branches.  The  Project  will  open  one  first-generation  imprest \naccount to be operated by CPMU and one first-generation imprest account \nto  be  operated  by  the  MOF  to  finance  the  biogas  credit  lines  to  partner \nfinancial  intermediaries.  A  total  of  20  second-generation  imprest  accounts \nwill  be  established,  one  for  each  of  the  16  provincial  project  management \nunits,  one  for  the  IPMU,  one  for  the  BPMU,  and  one  for  each  of  the  two \npartner  financial  intermediaries.  MARD  and  all  agencies  proposed  as \nimplementing agencies have adequate financial and management capacity \nand experience to implement the Project. These agencies are government \nbudget-spending  units,  with  staff  capable  of  using  standard  government \naccounting  and  financial  management  systems.  APMB,  DCP,  DLP,  and \nDARDs have implemented significant donor funded projects, including ADB \nprojects. \n \nProcurement  will  mainly  be  undertaken  by  the  CPMU.  Goods,  works,  and \nservices  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n\n \nThe Project will require a total of 208 person-months of consultant services, \nincluding  60  person-months  of  international  and  148  person-months  of \nnational  consultant  services  in  the  fields  of  (i)  management  of  agricultural \nproduct  quality  and  safety  systems;  (ii)  policy,  regulations  and  institutional \ndevelopment;  (iii)  monitoring  and  evaluation;  (iv)  applied  research  and \ndevelopment for agricultural product quality and safety; (v) risk analysis; (vi) \ncommunication  and  training  programs;  (vii)  social  development;  (viii) \n(x)  biogas \nenvironmental  assessment; \ntechnology;  and  (xi)  rural  infrastructure.  The  international  specialist  in \nagricultural  product  quality  and  safety  management  will  act  as  the  team \nleader. The consultants will be recruited through a firm following the quality- \nand  cost-based  selection  (QCBS)  process,  with  a  90:10  quality-cost  ratio \ndue to the specialized nature of the Project, and in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime). \n \n \n \n\nfinancial  management; \n\n(ix) \n\n\fProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \n\ntolerant  seed  varieties, \n\nThe Project is designed to support the Government\u2019s efforts to implement a \ncomprehensive  legal  and  regulatory  framework  related  to  food  safety  and \nquality  including  the  Law  on  Product  Standards,  Labels,  and  Inspection, \nOrdinance  on  Food  Hygiene  and  Safety,  and  the  national  action  plan  for \nfood safety. The project area covers about 3.9 million ha of agricultural land \nwith  about  3.6  million  rural  households  (or  an  equivalent  of  18  million \npeople)  in  16  provinces,  where  the  rural  poverty  incidence  is  estimated  at \n25.9%  compared  to  the  national  average  of  22.0%  (2005  data).  Main \nbenefits attributable to the Project will include:  \n(i) incremental benefits from increased crop yields and productivity through \nadoption  of  high-yield  and \nintegrated  pest \nmanagement,  and  good  agricultural  practices.  An  estimated  6.5  million \nfarmers  will  directly  benefit  from  the  project  interventions.  The  Project  is \nalso expected to generate employment for about 1.4 million people involved \nin the post-production food chain for tea, fruits, and vegetables. As a result, \nthe  Project  will  make  significant  contributions  to  rural  poverty  reduction  in \nand outside the Project provinces;  \n(ii)  health  cost  savings  realized  through  safe  agricultural  products  (tea, \nfruits,  and  vegetables)  and  improved  livestock  waste  management.  It  is \nexpected  that  significant  reduction  in  the  occurrence  of  food-  and \nwaterborne diseases will directly improve human health in the project area, \nincreasing labor productivity and reducing treatment and hospital costs;  \n(iii) cost savings from substitution of firewood, kerosene, coal, and liquefied \npetroleum gas for cooking and lighting. The Project will contribute to energy \nsavings  among  rural  households  as  biogas  produced  by  the  digesters  will \nserve as an alternative energy source for cooking and lighting. An estimate \nof 40,000 households will benefit from this alternative energy source;  \n(iv) use of bio-slurry, an organic fertilizer that is safer than artificially treated \nmanure.  Farmers  are  currently  using  artificially  treated  manure  that  is \nconsidered unsafe for water, air, and soil. Although no empirical evidence is \navailable  on  the  incremental  impact  of  bio-slurry  versus  manure  on  crop \nyields  in  Viet  Nam,  elsewhere  bio-slurry  has  been  claimed  to  be  a  better \nfertilizer than artificially treated manure; and  \n(v)  reduced  levels  of  water,  air,  and  soil  pollution  as  a  result  of  biogas \ndigester installation and operations, because of improved management and \ntreatment  of  domestic  and  livestock  wastes.  It  is  estimated  that  the \nproposed  biogas  development  operation  will  reduce  carbon  dioxide \nemissions by an equivalent of about 40,000\u201360,000 tons per annum. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fRisks and \nMitigations \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\nto  compete  with \n\nRisks that may hinder the expansion of opportunities to supply safe, quality \nfruit, vegetable and tea products to the domestic and export markets are: (i) \nproducers  of  agro-products  (i.e.,  vegetables,  fruits,  and  tea)  may  not  be \nfully convinced of the need to comply with national and international quality \nstandards;  (ii)  food  safety  scares  related  to  Vietnamese  agro-products  in \nmajor domestic and export markets will affect demand; and (iii) promotional \nstrategies  may  be  unable  to  build  consumer  trust  and  confidence  and \nincrease  awareness  and \nrecognition  of  safe  agro-product  brands, \nparticularly  regarding  their  certification  schemes  and  logos,  because  of \nfrequent  past  food  safety  scares.  These  risks  would  render  Vietnamese \nagro-products  unable \nforeign-produced  agricultural \nproducts in the domestic and international markets. The Project is designed \nto  reduce  these  risks  by  building  institutional  capacity  for  effective \nregulation and enforcement of food quality and safety standards. It will also \nstrengthen the capacity of agricultural production and marketing units along \nthe  supply  chain,  backed  by  certification,  promotion  and  an  intensive \ninformation,  education,  and  communication  campaign.  The  approach  will \nfollow  internationally  recognized  hazard  analysis  critical  control  point \nprinciples to assure buyers that all commercial units involved in producing \nand handling safe, quality products are independently monitored and have \nan established record of supplying products that meet stringent food safety \nstandards.  The  Project  will  assist  the  Government  in  the  continued \ndevelopment and review of standards to meet requirements of international \nmarkets and the World Trade Organization. \n \nSuccessful  reduction  of  risks  to  agro-product  safety  and  health  quality \nthrough  biogas  development  will  require  strong  project  management \ncapacity  and  coordination  at  the  provincial  level  between  the  DARDs  and \nfinancial  intermediaries.  There  is  also  a  risk  that  the  Biogas  Development \nProgram  may  be  delayed  and  may  not  attain  the  target  of  40,000 \nhouseholds due to (i) an inadequate supply of trained masons to construct \nthe biogas digesters, resulting from a lack of interest in participating in the \nlivestock \nbiogas  development  program;  and  (ii) \nproducers  to  avail  themselves  of  credit,  due  to  non-acceptance  of  the \nbiogas  technology.  To  mitigate  these  risks,  the  Project  will  disseminate \ninformation  on  the  Biogas  Development  Program  and  provide  training  on \nmasonry,  both  at  the  central  and  provincial  government  levels.  Enhanced \nassistance  from  both  the  Government  and  the  Netherlands  Development \nOrganization in Viet Nam will support training for masons and households \nand dissemination of information on biogas technology. Support will also be \nprovided on the proper use and maintenance of biogas digesters. In order \nto  ensure  that  financial  assistance  is  accessible  to  small  livestock \nproduction  units,  the  Department  of  Livestock  Production  and  provincial \nDARDs will work with partner financial intermediaries to extend microcredit \nsupport.  \n \n \n \n \n\nfailure  by \n\ntargeted \n\n\fTechnical \nAssistance \n\nfield \n\nlivestock \n\nfarms,  based  on \n\nlarge-scale  commercial \n\nAssociated technical assistance (TA) will be provided to strengthen project \nmanagement and develop strategies and options for expanding the biogas \nprogram  in  Viet  Nam.  Part  1  of  the  TA  will  provide  startup  support  for  the \nProject,  including  oversight  and  capacity  building.  The  oversight  function \nwill  provide  advisory  support  to  the  Government  on  how  to  effectively \nimplement  and  monitor  project  activities  on  the  quality  and  safety  of \nagricultural products and biogas development. Part 2 will provide a design \nfor  an  investment  to  expand  biogas  development,  involving:  (i)  technical \ndesign of biogas plants of varying sizes for farm households and medium- \nto \ntesting, \ndemonstration,  and  applied  research  activities;  (ii)  determination  of  credit \nfinancing options for different socioeconomic groups; (iii) determination of a \ngeographical  expansion  plan  and  strategy;  (iv)  design  of  a  practical \ninstitutional  and  management  structure  expansion  of  the  biogas  program; \nand  (v)  development  of  clean  development  mechanism  projects.  The \nestimated  cost  of  the  TA  is  $1.8  million,  of  which  $1.5  million  will  be \nfinanced under the Project, through an ADB grant, while $0.3 million will be \nfinanced by the Government to cover incremental administrative expenses, \noffice  space,  local  travel,  and  per  diem  for  counterpart  staff.  The  TA  will \nrequire  103  person-months  of  consultant  services,  comprising  46  person-\nmonths  of  international  consultant  and  57  person-months  of  national \nconsultant services. All consultants will be recruited by ADB in accordance \nwith  the  ADB  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended \nfrom time to time). Individual consultants will be recruited for part 1, while a \nfirm will be recruited, using the quality- and cost-based selection procedure, \nfor part 2.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fo\n103  00\u2019E\n\no\n108  00\u2019E\n\nHa Giang Cao Bang\n7\n\n9\n\n10\n6\nBac Kan\n\nTrang Dinh\n\nPEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC\nOF  CHINA\n\nLao Cai\n\nLai Chau\n\n4\n\n1\n\n2\n\nDien Bien\nPhu\n\n3\n\n8\nYen Bai\n\nTuyen Quang\n11\n\nThai Nguyen\n\n16\n\nLang Son\n\nSon La\n\nPhu Tho\n\n12\n\nVinh Yen\n\nViet Tri\n5\n\nHoa Binh\n\n14\n\n15\n\nHA NOI\n13\n\n22\n\nHung Yen\n23\nPhu Ly\n24\n\n26\n\n18\nBac Giang\n\n17\n\nMong Cai\n\nCam Pha\n\nHa Long\n\nHai Phong\n\n20\n\n19\nHai\nDuong\n21\nThai Binh\n\n25\nNinh Binh\n\nThanh Hoa\n\n20  00\u2019No\n\nLAO PEOPLE'S\nDEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC\n\nGulf   of   Tonkin\n\n20  00\u2019No\n\nThai Hoa\n27\n\nDien Chau\n\nVinh\n\nHa Tinh\n\n28\n\nSOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF\nVIET NAM\nQUALITY AND SAFETY ENHANCEMENT OF\nAGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS AND\nBIOGAS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT\n\nDong Hoi\n\n29\n\nDong Ha\n\n30\n\nHue\n\n31\n\nProject Province\n\nNational Capital\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nNational Road\n\nOther Road\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\nDa Nang\n\nHoi An\n\n32\n\n33\n\nTam Ky\n\n34\n\nQuang Ngai\n\n35\nKon Tum\n\nBong Son\n\n37\n\nPleiku\n\n36\n\nQuy Nhon\n\n38\n\nTuy Hoa\n\n39\n\nBuon Ma\nThuot\n\n40\n\nDak Song\n\nNinh Hoa\n\nGia Nghia\n\nDa Lat\n\nCAMBODIA\n\n44\nDong Xoai\n\n42\n\nDi Linh\n\nAn Loc\n\n45\n\nTay Ninh\n\n46\nThu Dau Mot\n\n51\nTan An\n\nBien Hoa\n\n47\n\n49\n\n48\n\nLien Huong\n\nPhan Thiet\n\n41\nNha Trang\n\nCam Ranh\n\n43\n\nPhan Rang-\nThap Cham\n\nGulf   of   Thailand\n\nN\n\nPhu Quoc Island\n\nRach Gia\n\nChau Doc\n\nCao Lanh\n53\n\nVinh Long\n\n54\nLong\nXuyen\n\n57\n\nCan Tho\n\n58\n\nHo Chi Minh City\n50\nMy Tho\n\nDat Do\nVung Tau\n\nBen Tre\n\n52\n\n59\n\nHa Tien\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n200\n\nKilometers\n\nVi Thanh\n55\n\n56\n\n61\n\n62\n\nCa Mau\n\nBac Lieu\n\n60\n\nTra Vinh\n\nSoc Trang\n\n63\n\no\n103  00\u2019E\n\no\n108  00\u2019E\n\nPROVINCES\n\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n10.\n11.\n12.\n13.\n14.\n15.\n16.\n17.\n18.\n19.\n20.\n21.\n22.\n23.\n24.\n25.\n26.\n27.\n28.\n29.\n30.\n31.\n32.\n33.\n34.\n35.\n36.\n37.\n38.\n39.\n40.\n41.\n42.\n43.\n44.\n45.\n46.\n47.\n48.\n49.\n50.\n51.\n52.\n53.\n54.\n55.\n56.\n57.\n58.\n59.\n60.\n61.\n62.\n63.\n\nLai Chau\nDien Bien\nSon La\nLao Cai\nPhu Tho\nTuyen Quang\nHa Giang\nYen Bai\nCao Bang\nBac Kan\nThai Nguyen\nVinh Phuc\nHa Noi\nBac Ninh\nHung Yen\nLang Son\nQuang Ninh\nBac Giang\nHai Duong\nHai Phong\nThai Binh\nHoa Binh\nHa Nam\nNinh Binh\nNam Dinh\nThanh Hoa\nNghe An\nHa Tinh\nQuang Binh\nQuang Tri\nThua Thien Hue\nDa Nang\nQuang Nam\nQuang Ngai\nKon Tum\nGia Lai\nBinh Dinh\nPhu Yen\nDak Lak\nDak Nong\nKhanh Hoa\nLam Dong\nNinh Thuan\nBinh Phuoc\nTay Ninh\nBinh Duong\nDong Nai\nBinh Thuan\nBa Ria - Vung Tau\nHo Chi Minh\nLong An\nTien Giang\nDong Thap\nAn Giang\nKien Giang\nHau Giang\nCan Tho\nVinh Long\nBen Tre\nTra Vinh\nSoc Trang\nBac Lieu\nCa Mau\n\n08-4479 EG\n\n12  00\u2019No\n\n12  00\u2019No\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Quality  and  Safety  Enhancement  of  Agricultural \nProducts and Biogas Development Project (the Project). The report also describes the proposed \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  Strengthening  Project  Management  and  Developing  Strategies \nand  Options  for  Biogas  Development  Program  Expansion  in  Viet  Nam,  and  if  the  Board \napproves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  will \napprove  the  TA.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  and  problem  tree  analysis  are  in \nAppendixes 1 and 2, respectively. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n \nA. \n \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nMacroeconomic  Performance.  Fueled  by  surging  private  investment  and  strong \n2. \ndomestic  demand,  Viet  Nam\u2019s  recent  economic  performance  has  been  among  the  best \nrecorded  by  Asian  Development  Bank  developing  member  countries.  The  growth  rate  in  the \ngross domestic product (GDP) averaged 7.7% per year over 2003\u20132008. This was equivalent to \nan  annual  increase  in  GDP  per  capita  of  about  13%  (from  $490  to  $1,053)  during  the  same \nperiod.1 The country\u2019s economic structure was also transformed, with industry, construction and \nservices  displaying  rapid  growth,  while  the  share  of  the  economy  represented  by  traditional \nagro-forestry and capture fisheries declined. Viet Nam has achieved greater competitiveness in \nkey  sectors,  and  expanded  its  exports  significantly.  The  private  sector's  contribution  to \neconomic activity is increasingly apparent, improving the prospects for further reforms toward a \nmarket-based economy.  \n\n3. \nReduced  Poverty.  Continued  and  sustained  economic  growth  helped  reduce  the \ncountry's  poverty  rate  from  58%  in  1993  to  19.5%  in  2004  (measured  in  terms  of  the  national \npoverty standard). However, the incidence of poverty among ethnic minorities generally remains \nhigh.  Various  social  indicators,  such  as  education  levels  and  infant  mortality,  have  also \nimproved,  as  reflected  in  an  increase  in  the  country's  ranking  in  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment Program human development index.   \n\n4. \nChanging  Food  Demand  Patterns  and  Quality  and  Safety  Concerns.  Accelerated \neconomic  growth  has  resulted  in  improved  socioeconomic  welfare,  rapid  urban  development, \nand greater demand for food products with assured quality and safety. Urbanization has led to a \nrapidly growing \u201csupermarket\u201d subsector2 that sources high-quality agricultural products free of \nsafety hazards. Incidences of food poisoning from microbiological contamination and excessive \npesticide residues in vegetables, fruits, and tea (estimated to account for 30% of the total cases \nof  biological  [e.g.,  E.  Coli]  and  chemical  poisonings)3  have  raised  awareness  among \nVietnamese  consumers,  who  are  demanding  that  safer,  higher  quality  agricultural products  be \ndelivered  through  the  food  supply  chain.  This  has  resulted  in  opportunities  for  profitable  \u201csafe \nfood\u201d enterprises for both domestic and international markets, and the Government\u2019s realization \nof  the  need  for  a  strong  institutional  and  regulatory  framework  for  agricultural  product  quality \nand safety to enhance the country\u2019s competitiveness in the world market.  \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2009.

Report  on  the  TA  for  Making  Markets  Work  Better  for  the \nPoor.  Centre   de Cooperation  Internationale  en  Recherche Agronomique pour  le  Development (CIRAD)/ADB. \nHa Noi.  \n\n3  VN  News.  8  April  2008.  A  cholera  outbreak  in  northern  Viet  Nam  was  directly  traced  to  unsafe  vegetables, \n\naccording to the Ministry of Health in Ha Noi. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nRole  of  Agricultural  Growth.  The  agriculture  sector  grew  steadily  at  4%  per  annum \n5. \nduring  2001\u20132007,  and  contributed  20.4%  to  national  GDP  in  2006,  despite  generally  weak \ninternational  commodity  prices.4  Crops  constitute  about  59%  of  total  agricultural  production \nvalue,  followed  by  fish  (19%),  livestock  (17%),  and  forestry  (5%).5  The  country  maintained  its \nlead in export of rice, coffee and fish, while exhibiting strong growth rates in the production of \nvegetables (6.2%), fruits (3.5%), and tea (11.8%), which contributed significantly to the growth \nin  the  country\u2019s  agricultural  exports.6  Amongst  the  Southeast  Asian  countries  Viet  Nam  ranks \nfirst  in  tea  production,  second  in  vegetables  production,  and  third  in  fruit  production,  led  by \ngrowing small-scale and commercial agro-enterprises. The livestock subsector, which accounts \nfor  about  17%  of  total  agriculture  sector  value,  has  grown  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  14% \nover  2001\u20132006,7  mainly  because  of  swine  production,  which  comprises  about  80%  of  total \nlivestock  production.8  Most  livestock  production  takes  place  in  integrated  crop,  livestock,  and \nfishpond systems, with some 40% of households practicing both livestock and vegetables.9 \n \n6. \nAgricultural  growth  in  the  past  decade,  particularly  in  the  crop  subsector,  has  resulted \nfrom:  (i)  market-oriented  economic  policies  that  supported progressive decontrol  of  prices  and \nmarket  functions,  and  established  liberalized  land-use  rights  with  increased  household \nparticipation in production and marketing; (ii) increased public investment in irrigation and farm-\nto-market infrastructure; and (iii) intensive use of inputs such as land, labor and agro-chemicals. \nThe policy shift away from rice monoculture has led to increased production and export of other \ncrops,  including  fresh  and  processed  vegetables,  fruits,  and  tea,  and  the  trend  is  expected  to \ncontinue with increased integration of the country\u2019s economy in the world markets through the \nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) and regional free trade agreements. Poor agro-product quality \nand  safety  are  key  obstacles  to  tapping  expanding  domestic  and  international  markets  for \nin  capacity  development, \nvegetables, \ninfrastructure and training support for farmers, processors and agribusiness enterprises. \n \n7. \nThe  Government  recognizes  that  continued  agricultural  growth  depends  on  both  (i) \ndiversified  farming  systems  appropriate  for  varied  agro-ecological  conditions;  and  (ii)  more \nlocally  driven  improvements  in  competitiveness,  quality  and  safety,  and  addition  of  value  to \nagro-products.  The  Government  has  aimed  to  (i)  promote  production  and  processing  of  high-\nvalue  products;  (ii)  improve  agricultural  research,  extension,  and  market  information  services; \n(iii) intensify efforts to ensure better product quality and food safety based on sound agricultural \npractices;  and  (iv)  promote  competitive  business  and  agro-based  products.  The  proposed \nProject  is  consistent  with  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  reduce  poverty,  promote  livelihoods  and \nimprove  living  conditions  through  interventions  that  will  enhance  the  quality  and  safety  of \nagricultural  products  and  generate  multiple  environmental,  economic,  and  social  benefits \nthrough biogas development.

Manila. \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nresponsible  for  policy  formulation,  management,  monitoring,  inspection,  communication, \naccreditation, and development of standards for food safety (Appendix 3). Existing quality and \nsafety  standards  for  agricultural  products,  especially  fruits  and  vegetables,  do  not  meet \ninternationally recognized standards,10 and pose significant risks to consumers. The absence of \na  well-developed  system  of  quality  and  safety  certification  for  agro-products,  continued \nagricultural production in unsafe or unsuited areas,11 and other similar practices further limit the \nquality and safety of the food products supplied to domestic and international markets. Farmers, \nprimary  processors,  and  traders  are  unaware  of  food  safety  hazards  as  well  as  techniques  to \naddress  consumer  concerns  regarding  food  safety.  The  small  size  of  farms  and  fragmented \nlandholdings constrain economies of scale in safe production practices, as well as investment in \nagri-business  and  postharvest  facilities  to  make  safe  food  part  of  the  market  chain.  Increased \ngovernment  efforts  to  promote  commercial  values  in  the  agricultural  product  supply  chain \n(particularly  for  vegetables,  fruits,  and  tea)    require  more  than  simply  an  overall  strategy  to \nenhance  competitiveness  by  improving  access  by  farmers,  primary  processors,  and  traders  to \nimproved production and postharvest technologies and more efficient marketing. Higher quality \nand  safety  standards  for  agricultural  products  are  also  needed,  and  can  be  developed  by \nproviding  services  and  access  to  financial  assistance  to  small  and  medium-scale  enterprises, \nand through the creation of safe agricultural zones (SAZs).12  \n \n9. \nRapid  development  of  urban  areas  has  altered  the  structure  of  agricultural  production \nfrom monoculture to diversified farming, and resulted in competition for differing land uses. Peri-\nurban vegetable production near major cities or heavily populated and industrialized areas13 has \nraised  concerns  regarding  the  need  for  development  of  SAZs  that  are  free  from  excessive \nmicrobiological,  chemical,  and  heavy  metal  pollution  and  contamination.  Creation  of  SAZs  will \nremove  obstacles  to  the  production  and  distribution  of  safe,  high  quality  agricultural  products \n(including vegetable, fruit, and tea products). Demand for these products is rising rapidly, driven \nby increasing incomes and development of high-value domestic and foreign urban markets. \n \nReducing Food Safety Risks from Agro-chemicals and Animal Wastes. High levels \n10. \nof agro-chemical residues in vegetables, fruits, and tea have been recognized as a major threat \nto food safety,14 and 75% of fruits (oranges, grapes, and mangos) and 15%\u201330% of beans and \nleafy  vegetables  have  excessive  pesticide  levels.15  Viet  Nam  has  one  of  the  highest  chemical \ninput use rates among countries in Asia and the Pacific.16 Untreated disposal of livestock waste \nin  densely  populated  areas  has  contaminated  soils  and  water,  resulting  in  substandard \nagricultural products, in terms of safety and quality. Each year an estimated 73 million tons of \nlivestock  waste  are  disposed  of  improperly  into  ponds,  channels,  and  sewers,  or  left  in  fields, \neventually  polluting  the  surrounding  areas.  Wastewater  samples  taken  from  livestock  farms \nindicated that about 90% do not meet the applicable industrial wastewater discharge standards, \n\n                                                 \n10 Ministry of Trade and European Union. 2005.

Ha Noi. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nespecially  with  regard  to  biological  oxygen  demand  and  chemical  oxygen  demand  levels.17 \nMoreover,  an  estimated  17.52  million  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  are  emitted  if  the  waste \nremains  untreated.18  Therefore,  poor  management  of  livestock  waste  disposal  can  undermine \nthe efforts to enhance the quality and safety of agro-products, and pose high environmental and \nhealth  risks.  Use  of  improved  technologies  such  as  bio-digesters  can  control  environmental \npollution, thereby reducing risks associated with the use of agricultural products. Bio-digesters \ncan  also  provide  an  alternative  source  of  household  energy,  and  serve  as  a  safe  and \neconomical  source  of  organic  manure  for  crop  production.  By  better  managing  agro-chemical \nuse and integrating animal waste management, safety risks associated with the on-farm use of \nagricultural products can be reduced. \n \n11.  Market-Driven  Food  Safety  Standards.  Establishment  of  a  \u201csafe  food\u201d  supply \nframework  and/or  strategy  is  a  prerequisite  to  the  creation  of  a  role  for  the  private  sector  and \nmarket forces in ensuring higher and stricter quality and safety standards for food, as demanded \nby  conscious  consumers  in  both  domestic  and  international  markets.  Likewise,  support  has  to \nbe  provided  to  build  capacity  for  and  improve  the  efficiency  of  production,  product  assembly, \nand marketing and distribution by numerous small and fragmented agricultural production units, \nin order to be competitive while meeting the demand for product quality and safety standards.  \n \n\n2. \n\nGovernment Objective and Strategy \n \n\n12. \nStrengthening  of  the  Regulatory  Framework.  Accession  to  the  WTO  in  2006 \naccelerated  implementation  of  the  country\u2019s  action  programs  that  will  streamline  the  over  200 \nfood  safety  regulations  that  have  already  been  decreed.  Establishment  of  a  comprehensive \nregulatory  framework  is  high  priority  under  the  action  plan  for  food  safety,  2008\u20132012,  which \nincludes  (i)  establishment  of  a  lead  agency  for  food  safety;  (ii)  planning  of  SAZs;  (iii) \nstrengthening  of  certification,  inspection,  and  monitoring;  and  (iv)  improving  food  quality  and \nsafety  services  (Supplementary  Appendix  B).19  The  Government  initially  aims  to  ensure  that \n50%  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  standards  conform  with  international  food  quality  and  safety  standards.  In \naddition, the capacity of accreditation organizations such as the Department of Crop Production \n(DCP) and the provincial departments of agriculture and rural development offices (DARDs) will \nneed to be strengthened, as staff lack sufficient background on food safety, accreditation, and \ncertification.  The  Government\u2019s  monitoring  and  inspection  systems  will  need  to  be  improved \nalong  with  the  capacity  of  the  monitoring  and  inspection  staff.  Laboratory  facilities  and  staff \ncapacity  will  need  to  be  upgraded  to  extend  support  at  the  regional  and  local  levels. \nCoordination between MARD and the Ministry of Health (MOH) in quality and safety inspection \nactivities, which is currently limited, will likewise need to be strengthened. \n \n13. \nGood  Agricultural  Practices.  Government  agencies  are  promoting  good  agricultural \npractices (GAP) among producers, processors, and traders through Viet Nam good agricultural \npractices  (VIETGAP)  and  Global  Good  Agricultural  Practices  (GLOBALGAP).20  However,  the \nachievement  of  GAP  targets  is  impeded  by:  (i)  a  lack  of  understanding  of  food  safety  among \nprimary producers, processors, distributors, consumers, and public servants; (ii) weak linkages \n\n                                                 \n17  Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. 2008.

A  major  element  of  the  Government\u2019s  food \nagriculture  strategy  is  to  safeguard  agricultural  land  from  excessive  microbiological,  chemical, \nand  heavy  metal  pollution  and  contamination  and  ensure  the  production  and  distribution  of \nagricultural products that are safe and of high quality.  Creation of SAZs will ensure that: (i) farm \nagro-production  practices  avoid  food  safety  risks,  (ii)  production  activities  are  organized  and \nefficiently  linked  with  processing  and  marketing,  (iii)  investments  in  processing  and  marketing \ninfrastructure result in greater efficiency, and (iv) the climate encourages greater investments by \nfarmers and agribusiness.21 \n \n15. \nImproving  Livestock  Waste  Management  to  Reduce  Agro-Product  Safety  and \nHealth Hazards. The Government initiated its national biogas program in 2003.22  The program \nhas the potential to both (i) address the adverse impacts of traditional livestock waste disposal \nmethods  on  the  physical  environment  (particularly,  water,  soil,  and  air)  and,  consequently,  on \nthe  quality  and  safety  of  agricultural  products;  and  (ii)  develop  alternative  and  clean  energy \nsources. The program was envisioned to mitigate and avert further environmental pollution, and \nhas  achieved  nationwide  success  mainly  due  to:  (i)  a  well-established  legal  framework  for \nprogram  implementation  and  cooperation  among  relevant  government  agencies,  participating \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  private  organizations;  (ii)  availability  of  appropriate \nbiogas technology for small-scale livestock producers; and (iii) extensive training and promotion. \nA total of 45,000 biogas plants have been constructed in 30 provinces during 2003\u20132007; as a \nresult  of  increasing  demand  for  biogas  technology  among  small  farm  households,  a  second \nphase is being implemented (through 2011). Given the wider prospects for biogas, it is crucial \nthat  further  investments  in  demonstration  and  applied  research  for  the  design  and  viability  of \nvarious sizes of biogas plants be made, particularly for plants of medium to large size. \n \n16. \nBroadening the Framework for Food Security. An integrated approach to production, \ntrade and marketing that also ensures access by consumers to sufficient and safe food will help \nsupport  economic  growth  and  rural  livelihood  development.  The  Government  is  committed  to \ndevelop  a  functioning  regulatory  framework  that  involves  partnership  among  producers, \nprocessors and traders as well as coordination and communication among relevant government \nregulatory and monitoring and coordinating agencies, such as MARD, MOH, Ministry of Trade \nand Commerce, and Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources. The approach requires a \nstrong  synergy  between  interventions  that  address  the  institutional  management,  regulatory \ncapacity, infrastructure, and training needs of public and private sector stakeholders for quality \nand  safety  enhancement  of  agricultural  products  with  those  that  would  (i)  create  safer \nproduction  and  processing  zones  for  specific  commodities  or  commodity  groups;  and  (ii) \nimprove  the  biophysical  environment  in  which  agricultural  products  are  produced,  processed, \nand  traded.  Creation  of  SAZs  and  improved  management  of  fertilizer  and  pesticide  use\u2014\n\n                                                 \n21  A description of the SAZs is presented in Supplementary Appendix D. \n22  The  Biogas  Program  for  the  Animal  Husbandry  Sector  in  Viet  Nam,  supported  by  the  Government  of  the \nNetherlands\u2019  official  development  assistance,  is  being  implemented  by  the  MARD  Livestock  Production \nDepartment, with technical support from the Netherlands Development Organization in Viet Nam (SNV).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n3. \n\nLegal and Institutional Framework for Quality and Safety Enhancement  \n\nthrough  measures  such  as  integrated  pest  management  (IPM)  and  pricing  policies  for \nagrochemicals\u2014can  eliminate  the  risk  of  microbiological,  chemical  and  heavy  metal  pollution \nand contamination in food products. Likewise, introduction of technologies such as biogas can \nreduce environmental pollution and food safety risks while also providing a safe and economic \nsubstitute  and/or  complement  to  chemical  fertilizers,  and  an  alternative  energy  source  for \ncooking and generating electricity for lighting, thereby contributing to broader benefits, including \nincreased agricultural productivity, reduced health risks for women, and enhanced food security. \n \n \n \n17. \nThe  Government  acknowledges  the  urgent  need  to  improve  quality  and  food  safety  in \nagricultural production and marketing to levels comparable with neighboring countries and trade \ncompetitors. In recent years there have been numerous regulatory efforts in Viet Nam related to \nfood  safety  and  quality,  in  the  form  of  ordinances,  laws,  standards,  and  action  plans,  which  \nculminated in the Government\u2019s directive proclaiming 2008 as the year of quality and safety of \nagricultural  products.  On  28  January  2008,  MARD  established  the  National  Agro-forestry  and \nFisheries  Quality  Assurance  Department  (NAFIQAD).  NAFIQAD  was  given  wide  responsibility \nfor  formulation  and  implementation  of  regulations,  and  will  be  guided  by  the  newly  developed \nfood  safety  and  agricultural  health  action  plan.23  There  is  also  strong  commitment  from  the \nprovincial  DARDs  to  strengthen  their  capacity  to  implement  quality  and  safety  improvement \nprojects, in partnership with the private sector.24  \n \n18. \nfor  sustainable  development  and \nenvironmental protection that support these regulatory efforts and reform initiatives, including (i) \nthe  Sustainable  Development  Strategy  (Viet  Nam  Agenda  21)  for  harmonization  of  economic, \nsocial, and environmental development, which is a general framework to shift Viet Nam towards \na sustainable development path; and (ii) the national strategy for environment protection (2010\u2013\n2020),  which  aims  to  halt  the  spread  of  pollution,  restore  degraded  areas,  improve  overall \nenvironmental quality, and ensure achievement of sustainable national development. These are \ncomplemented  by  the  renewable  energy  action  plan  of  the  Ministry  of  Industry  which  has  a \nfocus that includes the development of renewable energy sources, with priority given to biogas \ndevelopment  as  an  efficient  energy  source  for  rural  and  mountainous  areas.  The  Project  is \nconsistent with the ideals of these strategies and policies. It is also in line with the SEDP 2006\u2013\n2010, which is intended to guide Viet Nam to middle-income nation status by late 2010 through \nimproved  quality  and  safety  of  agricultural  and  processed  products  that  meet  domestic  and \ninternational requirements. \n \nThe Government has identified 16 provinces25 that constitute major vegetable, fruit, and \n19. \ntea  production  areas  (Map)  as  the  main  targets  for  enhancing  the  quality  and  safety  of \nagricultural  products.26  A  large  number  of  small  farm  households  in  these  areas  also  raise \nlivestock  for  a  living  and  are  in  dire  need  of  appropriate  livestock  waste  management  and \ndisposal facilities. The poorly managed disposal of livestock waste is a major cause of pollution \nof both water and the production environment, and affects the safety of vegetable products, with \n\nThe  Government  has  developed  strategies \n\n                                                 \n23  See also the Prime Minister\u2019s directive on the implementation of urgent methods to assure food hygiene and safety \n\nNo. 06/2007/CT-TTg, dated 28 March 2007. \n\n24  The  Government  is  now  gradually  introducing  measures  to  improve  the  performance  of  state-owned  enterprises \n\nunder the state-owned enterprises law to further liberalize markets for improved private sector participation. \n\n25  The selected provinces are (i) Bac Giang, (ii) Ben Tre, (iii) Binh Thuan, (iv) Da Nang, (v) Ha Noi, including Ha Tay, \n(vi) Hai Duong, (vii) Hai Phong,  (viii) Ho Chi Minh City, (ix) Lam Dong, (x) Ninh Thuan, (xi) Phu Tho, (xii) Son La, \n(xiii) Thai Nguyen, (xiv) Tien Giang, (xv) Vinh Phuc, and (xvi) Yen Bai. \n\n26  ADB  2007.

There is strong demand for \nbiogas  technology  among  farm  households  in  these  provinces.  A  detailed  description  of  the \nproject area and criteria for the selection of provinces covered under the Project are presented \nin Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n \n \n20. \nThe  key  challenges  to  be  addressed  in  Viet  Nam  are  identified  by  ADB\u2019s  country \nstrategy  and  program  (2007\u20132010)27  as  (i)  development  and  strengthening  of  institutional \ncapacity,  (ii)  promotion  of  socially  equitable  and  balanced  development,  and  (iii)  sustainable \nenvironmental  management.  Promotion  of sustainable  rural  livelihoods  and  control  of  pollution \nemanating from farming activities are among the high priority areas for support. The Project is \nconsistent  with  this  strategy  and  will  contribute  to  poverty  alleviation  and  environmental \nmanagement objectives in Viet Nam. It is also consistent with ADB\u2019s mission and vision being \npursued  under  its  long-term  strategy  framework  2008\u20132020  (Strategy  2020)  which focuses  on \ninclusive  growth  and  environmentally  sustainable  development  while  remaining  dedicated  to \npoverty reduction.28 \n \n21. \nADB\u2019s agriculture sector strategy in Viet Nam has been to improve agriculture growth to \nreduce  poverty.  A  combination  of  program  and  project  financing  have  supported  (i)  reform  of \nsector  institutions  and  administration;  and  (ii)  strengthening  of  (a)  research  and  extension \ninfrastructure,  (b)  human  resources  capacity  and  service  delivery  mechanisms  for  improved \nproductivity,  and  (c)  rural  roads  and  transport  infrastructure  to  provide  increased  linkages  to \nmarkets.  Increases  in  farm  income  and  in  the  value  of  agricultural  production  were  targeted \nthrough  tea  and  fruit  development,29  while  the  agriculture  sector  development  program30 \npursued policy and institutional reforms to develop an environment conducive to market-based \nagricultural  and  agro-industry  development.

International  private  investments,  accompanied  by  technical \nsupport,  also  enabled  a  small  but  growing  number  of  SME  production  and  processing \nenterprises  to  achieve  international  standards  certification  required  by  the  investors\u2019  export \nmarkets. A list of relevant externally assisted projects is in Appendix 4. \n \n \n \n23. \nLessons  from  previous  projects  indicate  that  the  participation  of  key  stakeholders  in \nproject  design  and  implementation,  in  subproject  selection,  and  in  the  identification  of \ninterventions are key success factors. Projects that seek to improve agricultural production and \nmarketing  performance  require  strong  linkages  between  research  and  extension,  and  client \ndemand and participation. The participatory and client-driven approach strengthens stakeholder \nownership  of  the  project,  and  helps  ensure  that  the  needs  of  the  private  sector  (including \nfarmers)  regarding  improvements  in  agricultural  production  and  marketing  techniques  are \nproperly addressed. Other lessons indicate that (i) strengthening of current commercial capacity \nand  market  linkages  is  essential  to  improving  efficiency  along  the  agricultural  product  value \nchain; (ii) quality is primarily set by markets and consumers, and high quality standards ensure \ncompetitiveness  and  profitability;  (iii)  consumer  confidence  in  food  safety  relies  on  the  quality \nand  safety  measures  established  within  each  link  of  the  production-marketing  chain;  (iv)  it \nrequires  2\u20133  years  to  develop  the  capacity  to  commercially  produce  certified  safe  and  quality \nagro-products; and (v) a pilot approach involving \u201clead\u201d or \u201cinnovative\u201d farmers and the private \nsector reduces management risk and allows prospective investors and other farmers to assess \nthe potential for new investments and learn from firsthand experiences. \n\nLessons  \n\n6. \n\n                                                 \n34  A  similar  experience  can  be  found  in  ADB.  2002.

During 2016\u20132020, the \nProject  is  expected  to  contribute  to  increase  the  agricultural  sector\u2019s  annual  aggregate  value-\nadded  by  about  3.0%\u20133.2%,  and  agricultural  exports  by  12.3%\u201314.3%, \nline  with \nGovernment\u2019s SEDP 2006\u20132010.  \n \n25. \nThe  expected  outcome  is  quality  and  safety  improvements  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s  agricultural \noutputs,  which  thereby  meet  domestic  and  international  requirements.  To  attain  this  outcome, \nthe Project will (i) create effective regulatory institutions for state management of agro-product \nsafety  and  quality  systems  to  meet  domestic  and  export  requirements;  (ii)  accelerate  the \ndevelopment of agro-production, processing, and marketing to ensure the safety and quality of \nvegetable, fruit, and tea products for domestic consumption and export; and (iii) support biogas \ndevelopment to supply clean energy to households and reduce agro-product safety and health \nhazards from livestock waste in the 16 project provinces.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs  \n\nin \n\n1. \n\nImproved  Regulatory  Framework  and  Fully  Operational  Quality  and  Safety \nSystem for Agro-Products  \n\n26. \nIt  will  improve  the  institutional  management  and  regulatory  framework,  particularly  at \nMARD,36  so  that  safe  agricultural  products  are  produced,  processed,  and  distributed.  It  will \nsupport (i) improvement of the regulatory framework and coordination for state management of \nquality  and  safety;  (ii)  quality  and  safety-related  capacity  development  of  state  agencies  and \ncertification bodies; (iii) establishment of a crop food safety management system (CFSMS) for \nfood safety coordination, monitoring, and management from the central to the commune level.  \n \n27. \nImprovement of Regulatory Framework and Coordination for State Management.  A \ndetailed review will be undertaken of existing decrees, policies, and strategies for ensuring agro-\nproduct safety and quality in Viet Nam.37 It will assess whether regulations are consistent with \npolicies  and  strategies, and  identify  requirements  for  further  regulations.  The  review  will  serve \nas  the  basis  for  formulating  new  regulations,  policies,  and  strategies  for  improving  the  safety \nand  quality  of  fruits,  vegetables,  and  tea,  and  will  recommend  strategies  for:  (i)  strengthening \ncoordination  among  MARD  agencies  and  cooperation  between  MARD  and  other  relevant \nministries and departments for food safety; (ii) identifying lead agencies for different aspects of \nfood  safety,  and  establishing  a  multi-level  food  safety  system;  (iii)  establishing  monitoring, \ninformation, and communication systems; (iv) developing SAZs; and (v) developing standards, \naccreditation and certification procedures, and certification incentive policies.  \n \n28. \nStrengthening Capacity of State Agencies and Certification Bodies. The Project will: \n(i)  facilitate  the  development  of  policies  and  regulations  on  food  safety  and  quality;  (ii) \nstrengthen the capacity of the lead agencies within MARD (namely DCP and NAFIQAD) in food \nsafety  coordination  and  monitoring  and  certification  for  agro-product  quality  and  safety;  (iii) \n\n                                                 \n36  An assessment of the Government\u2019s institutional capacity for food quality and safety regulation and certification is \n\nin Supplementary Appendix B. \n\n37 Over  200  food  safety  regulations  will  be  reviewed,  consolidated,  and  harmonized  to  facilitate  certification, \nenforcement, inspection, and monitoring by agencies concerned, and to allow producers, processors, and traders \nto easily conform with these regulations and with international food quality and safety standards. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nsupport  the  design  and  establishment  of  a  provincial  food  safety  index  and  an  agro-product \nsafety  information  and  communication  system;  (iv)  improve  the  skills  and  knowledge  of  food \nsafety  specialists  at  MARD  (about  134  staff)  and  DARD  (about  144  staff  in  16  project \nprovinces), who will in turn train district and commune food safety facilitators; (v) further develop \nVIETGAP and other standards for agro-product safety and quality, including improvement of the \ninspection system;  (vi)  improve  planning  and management  capacity  of  SAZs;  (vii)  improve  the \ncapacity of food safety facilitators to demonstrate and disseminate good agricultural practices; \nand (viii) improve the capacity of laboratories to perform tests and risk analysis. In addition, staff \nfrom up to 100 potential certification organizations and 20 laboratories will be trained. \n \n29. \n Establishment  of  a  Crop  Food  Safety  Management  System.  The  creation  of  the \nCFSMS38  will  include:  (i)  establishment  of  a  standing  committee  on  food  safety  at  MARD, \nheaded  by  a  MARD  vice  minister;  (ii)  establishment  of  a  food  safety  monitoring  unit  within \nNAFIQAD; (iii) establishment of a crop food safety management unit within DCP responsible for \nformulation  of  policies,  development  of  standards,  accreditation  of  certification  bodies,  and \ncommunication of information on crop food safety; and (iv) identification of staff for specialized \npositions at the central, provincial, district, and commune levels responsible for (a) management \nof the food safety system, (b) facilitation of safe food production, and (c) internal control system \n(ICS)  of  certified  producers.  The  proposed  system  is  consistent  with  existing  regulations  that \ngive  a  mandate  to  DCP  in  crop  food  safety  and  to  NAFIQAD  in  overall  food  safety  and \nmonitoring.  Designated  food  safety  specialists  at  MARD  and  the  DARDs,  and  district  and \ncommune food safety facilitators will assist in piloting of CFSMS in the 16 project provinces.    \n \n \n \n30. \nThis  component  will  support:  (i)  implementation  of  SAZ  plans  and  development  of \nsupport infrastructure in SAZs; (ii) certification of agro-products; (iii) strengthening of provincial \ncapacity for agro-food safety monitoring and assessment, including training for farmers, primary \nprocessors,  and  traders  on  GAPs,  hazard  analysis  critical  control  point  (HACCP),  and  other \nfarm  food  safety  standards-based  practices;  (iv)  replacement  of  pest-  and  disease-prone \nvarieties with tolerant varieties; and (v) provision of support services to project provinces. The \nfirst four subcomponents will be mainly implemented by DARD in each of the 16 provinces. The \nfifth subcomponent will operate at central and regional levels, but will benefit all 16 provinces.  \n \n31. \nImplementation  of  Safe  Agricultural  Zones  Plan  and  Development  of  Support \nInfrastructure.39  The  Project  will  support  development  of  SAZs  through  (i)  analysis  of  soil  and \nwater parameters, and assessment of conditions for production and preliminary processing; and (ii) \nmapping and registration of safe production zones under provincial land planning zone schemes. In \neach of the 16 provinces three model sites will be established to demonstrate safe production, \nprimary processing and/or packing, and trading. Project will also support (i) development of risk \nassessment  procedures,  legal  registration  of  plans,  and  consultation  among  land  owners  and \nstakeholders; and (ii) design and construction of basic public infrastructure in the SAZs, such as \ninternal access roads and safe water irrigation systems, safe water wells for washing vegetable \nproducts, waste management facilities, and support infrastructure for postharvest, packing, and \ngrading.  To  maintain  the  agro-product  safety  along  the  marketing  chain,  the  Project  will  (i) \nestablish  and/or  rehabilitate  wholesale  market  facilities,  and  (ii)  upgrade  markets  and  group \nfarm shops where facilities for improved hygiene and storage management as well as facilities \nfor safe water and waste management will be installed. \n\nInfrastructure and Facilities for Quality and Safe Agro-Products  \n\n2. \n\n                                                 \n38  See Supplementary Appendix C on the crop food safety management system. \n39  A description of the SAZs is presented in Supplementary Appendix D. \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\nStrengthening  Provincial  Capacity \n\nCertification  of  Agro-Products.  The  Project  will  provide  support  for:  (i)  certification  of \n32. \nproduction,  primary  processing,  and \ntrading  entities  seeking  certification  with  VIETGAP, \nInternational  Federation  of  Organic  Agriculture  Movements  recommended  organic  standards,  and \nother standards (e.g., GLOBALGAP and HACCP); (ii) production and marketing entities with respect \nto  the  cost  of  (a)  processing  certification  applications,  (b)  testing  and  initial  inspection,  (c) \ninformation, (d) developing linkages along the certified market chain, and (e) development of a logo \nfor  licensing;  and  (iii)    equipment  and  logistics,  and  strengthening  staff  capacity  in  relevant \nprovincial agencies for monitoring and assessment of agro-production safety and quality.  \n \n33. \nfor  Agro-Food  Safety  Monitoring  and \nAssessment  and  Training  to  Farmers,  Primary  Processors,  and  Traders.  The  Project  will \nbuild capacity of certification bodies in (i) training and advising production and marketing entities \nseeking certification for food safety, VIETGAP, organic, and other standards; and (ii) facilitating \nprocessing of certification applications, testing, and initial required inspections. About 50 staff in \neach  province  will  be  trained  in  GAP  and  food  safety  system  monitoring,  assessment,  and \ncertification while about 500 production, processing, and marketing enterprises will be certified \nduring project implementation. Support will also be provided for (i) training farmers, postharvest \nprocessors  and  enterprises  in  VIETGAP;  (ii)  setting  up  an  agro-products  safety  management \nsystem; and (iii) improvement of provincial and district extension facilities for food quality and safety. \n \nReplacement  of  Poor  Quality  and  Pest-  and  Disease-Prone  Varieties  with  Better \n34. \nVarieties to Improve Quality and Safety of Agro-Products. The Project will support farmers in \nreplacing  some  fruit  and  tea  varieties  that  are  highly  vulnerable  to  disease  infection,  thereby \nreducing  the  dependence  of  farmers  on  agro-chemicals  and  improving  the  quality  and  safety  of \nagro-products. This is particularly important in lowland tea areas and for certain fruits, such as \nlychee, that have a short and intensive harvest season. About 20 pest and disease-tolerant fruit \nand  tea  varieties  will  be  developed  during  project  implementation  to  replace  susceptible \nvarieties currently being grown by farmers. The new varieties are expected to be cultivated in at \nleast 35% of the area targeted by provinces for variety replacement. \n \n35. \nProvision of Laboratory Services to Project Provinces. The capacity of laboratories in \nViet  Nam  will  be  assessed  with  regard  to  their  operational  efficiency,  the  presence/absence  of \nfinancial  management  systems,  and  personnel/logistical  requirements  (i.e., \noperating  and \nincremental staff, equipment, and related facilities), to determine investment requirements and the \ncost  of  upgrading  regional  laboratories.  The  Project  will  support  the  upgrading  of  three  regional \nlaboratories in Da Nang, Ha Noi, and Ho Chi Minh City by providing these facilities with appropriate \ntesting equipment and sufficient qualified staff to meet the demand from monitoring and certification \nagencies  for  inspection,  analysis,  and  assessment  of  agricultural  products.  The  Project  will  also \nsupport the contract services of applied research and development institutions for the (i) creation of \nnew varieties; (ii) monitoring and evaluation; (iii)  design and transfer of standardized demonstration \nmodels  in  safe  production,  post  harvest,  and  primary  processing;  (iv)  marketing  of  safe  products; \nand (v) information system and database development. \n\n \n3.  \n\nBiogas Development for Clean Energy, Improved Agro-Product Safety and \nReduced Health Hazards from Livestock Waste  \n\n \n36. \nThis  component  will  support:  (i)  biogas  infrastructure  investment,  (ii)  a  credit  facility  for \nbiogas, and (iii) demonstration and applied biogas research services.40 The component will be \nlinked  to  the  design  of  a  future  investment  project  to  expand  the  national  biogas  program \nthrough associated TA (para. 59). \n                                                 \n40  The description of support to the biogas development component, including unit cost of small biogas digesters and \n\ncriteria for selecting targeted households, is presented in Supplementary Appendix E. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nthe  poor,  women,  and  other  disadvantaged  groups.  Potential \n\n37.  Biogas  Infrastructure  Investment.  The  Project  will  provide:  (i)  direct  financial \nassistance for the construction of 20,000 household biogas units of various sizes to ensure safe \nand effective construction of biogas plants;41 (ii) support for biogas infrastructure development;42 \nand  (iii)  support  for  planning  and  integration  of  livestock  within  the  SAZs.  The  Project  will \nfacilitate construction of about 40,000 household biogas digesters in 16 provinces.43 \n \n38.  Credit  for  Biogas.  The  Project  will  provide  a  credit  line  that  will  be  managed  by  a \nnumber of partner financial intermediaries active in the rural and agriculture sector in Viet Nam \nto  facilitate  easier  access  to  credit  among  potential  biogas  farm  households,  with  particular \nemphasis  on \nfinancial \nintermediaries  identified  by  MARD  include  the  Viet  Nam  Bank  for  Agriculture  and  Rural \nDevelopment  (VBARD),  Central  Credit  Fund  (CCF)  and  its  subordinate  People\u2019s Credit  Funds \n(PCFs), and Viet Nam Bank for Social Policies (VBSP).44 Based on assessment of the financial \nmanagement capacity and previous experience  in ADB-funded projects, VBARD and the CCF \nand  PCFs  are  good  candidates  to  be  included  as  business  partners  for  delivering  credit  to \nbiogas households at the start of the Project. The participation of VBSP should be subject to the \nconduct of due diligence on its financial management.  \n \n39.  Demonstration  and  Applied  Research  Services. \nthis \nsubcomponent  will  provide  support  for  (i)  improving  the  design  of  existing  household  biogas \nplants,  (ii)  transfer  of  technology  regarding  biogas  and  digested  slurry,  and  (iii)  research  and \ntransfer of technology for medium- and large-scale biogas plants. Research findings will serve \nas  the  basis  for  expansion  of  biogas  development  activities  to  a  larger  number  of  small  farm \nhouseholds and medium-sized and large enterprises in other provinces. \n \n \n \n40. \nThe Project\u2019s three components will place significant management demands on the key \nimplementing  agencies  (IAs)  of  MARD\u2014namely  APMB,  which  will  host  the  central  project \nmanagement unit (CPMU); DCP, where the institution project management unit (IPMU) will be \nestablished; and DLP, where the biogas project management unit (BPMU) will be established\u2014 \nas  well  as  the  16  provincial  DARDs,  where  the  provincial  project  management  units  (PPMUs) \nwill  be  established.  Project  management  support  offices  (with  logistical  facilities  and  technical \nstaff) will be established at APMB, DCP, DLP, and 16 provincial DARDs. In addition, a team of \nconsultants will render management support and technical advice to CPMU, IPMU, BPMU, and \nPPMUs, and to provide supervision and capacity-building assistance with respect to quality and \nsafety enhancement of agro-products and biogas development in the project area.  \n \nC. \n\nProject Management Support  \n\nInvestments  under \n\nSpecial Features \n\n4. \n\n \n\n41. \nThe  Project  will  apply  an  integrated  approach  to  enhancing  the  quality  and  safety  of \nagricultural  products.  In  addition  to  strengthening  the  institutional  and  regulatory  capacity  of \ngovernment  agencies,  and  the  capacity  of  agricultural  producers,  primary  processors  and \ntraders in applying GAPs and creating SAZs, the Project will also support biogas development \n\n                                                 \n41  Another  20,000  households  will  be  provided  financial  assistance  by  the  ongoing  MARD-SNV  Project:  Support \n\nProject to the Biogas Program for the Agricultural Sector in Some Provinces in Viet Nam.  \n\n42 Includes promotion among stakeholders and farmers, training of technicians, quality supervision, and monitoring. \n43  Although the Project will provide direct financial support to only 20,000 biogas digesters, a credit line will be made \navailable  to  all  40,000  households  (i.e.,  20,000  biogas  digesters  targeted  under  the  Project  and  20,000  biogas \ndigesters targeted under the SNV project). \n\n44  The  Central  Credit  Fund  (CCF)  and  its  subordinate  People's  Credit  Funds  (PCFs),  Viet  Nam  Bank  for  Social \nPolicies and VBARD have submitted expressions of interest to participate in the Project. VBARD and CCF and its \nsubordinate PCFs have participated in the previous ADB-funded Tea and Fruits Development Project.  \n\n\f \n\n13 \n\nin  project  areas  that  will  control  environmental  pollution  and  thereby  reduce  food  quality  and \nsafety-related  risks,  while  making  energy  and  fertilizer  options  available  to  rural  households. \nThe  strong  complementarity  and  synergy  between  the  interventions  will  enable  the  Project  to \nhave a broader and more significant impact on livelihoods, productivity, and health (particularly \nof women and consumers) than would otherwise be possible.  \n \n42. \nClean  development  mechanism  (CDM)  projects  will  be  developed  for  the  biogas \ncomponent  to  generate  additional  carbon-derived  revenue.  The  Government  may  use  this \nrevenue to recover initial financial support provided to biogas farmers, or to provide additional \nsubsidies  to  biogas  households.  It  is  estimated  that  the  biogas  component  will  reduce  CO2 \nemissions  by  the  equivalent  of  about  40,000\u201360,000  tons  of  CO2  per  year,  once  all  40,000 \nbiogas  digesters  are  installed.  The  total  carbon-derived  revenue  is  estimated  at  $200,000\u2013\n$300,000  per  year  for  10  years,  assuming  a  carbon  price  of  $10  per  ton  of  CO2  for  credits \ngenerated  until  2012,  and  $5  per  ton  thereafter.  MARD  is  working  with  ADB  and  the \nNetherlands Development Organization in Viet Nam (SNV) on necessary CDM documentation \nand  institutional  setup  for  the  CDM  project.  The  Project  may  also  benefit  from  ADB's  carbon \nfund(s)  for  upfront  cofinancing  for  future  carbon  credits.  The  possibility  of  developing  a \nprogrammatic  CDM  project  for  the  national  biogas  program  will  also  be  explored;  this  would \nallow subsequent biogas projects to be added once the CDM program is registered. The CDM \nassessment is presented in Supplementary Appendix G.  \n \nD. \n \n43. \n$8.67 million (Table 1).

The Government will contribute $6.22 million (5.64% of the total Project costs), including \n$3.98  million  by  way  of  taxes  and  duties.  The  provincial  people\u2019s  committees  of  16  project \nprovinces will contribute $6.47 million (5.86% of the total project costs), including $4.69 million \nin  taxes  and  duties.  Partner  financial  intermediaries  will  contribute  $1.35  million  (1.22%  of  the \ntotal  project  cost)  to  finance  biogas  loans  to  households.  Beneficiaries  of  the  biogas \ndevelopment component will contribute $1.35 million in local materials and/or labor, accounting \nfor 1.22% of the total project costs. The ADB loan will have a maturity of 32 years with a grace \nperiod  of  8  years,  and  an  interest  rate  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period,  and  1.5% \nthereafter. The Government will bear the foreign exchange risk. Interest charges on the loan are \nto be capitalized. The summary financing plan is in Table 2 and details are in Appendix 5. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\n \n\nSource \n\nAsian Development Bank \nCentral Government  \nProvincial People\u2019s Committees \nPartner Financial Institutions \nBeneficiaries (Biogas Development) \n\n \n\nTotal \n\n \n\nTotal  \n\n95.00 \n6.22 \n6.47 \n1.35 \n1.35 \n110.39 \n\nPercent \n\n86.06 \n5.64 \n5.86 \n1.22 \n1.22 \n\n100.00 \n\n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n\n \n \n45. \nIt  is  proposed  that  the  ADB  loan  proceeds  be  utilized  by  the  Government  to  finance \nproject  activities  using  two  mechanisms:  (i)  extension  of  a  central  budget  grant  to  finance \nactivities related to quality and safety enhancement and the development of the biogas sector, \nand  (ii)  extension  of  loans  to  households  via  partner  financial  intermediaries  (FIs)  to  finance \nconstruction  of  biogas  digesters.  The  central  budget  grant  will  finance  activities  related  to \ninstitutional  and  regulatory  development  (component  1),  development  of  production  and \nconsumption  of  safe  and  quality  agro-products  (component  2),  and  project  management \n(component  4).  For  biogas  development  (component  3),  the  central  budget  grant  will  support \nbiogas  infrastructure,  and  applied  biogas  demonstrations,  and  services.  Support  for  biogas \ninfrastructure  includes  a  financial  assistance  of  at  least  D1.0  million  for  eligible  project \nhouseholds to be disbursed after biodigesters are constructed, put in operation, and certified as \nmeeting the agreed technical standards. The financial assistance will be provided to households \nidentified  and  enlisted  by  the  Project  regardless  of  whether  such  households  finance  the \nconstruction of the biogas digester by partner FIs or from the households\u2019 own sources.  \n \n46. \nFor household loans to construct biogas digesters, MOF will enter into subsidiary loan \nagreements  with  partner  financial  intermediaries  that  will  in  turn  extend  subloans  to  eligible \nhousehold beneficiaries for construction of biogas digesters. The subsidiary loan from MOF to \npartner  financial  intermediaries  will  be  denominated  in  dong  and  have  a  maturity  of  20  years \nwith  a  grace  period  of  6  years.  Terms  and  conditions  of  the  subsidiary  loans  from  MOF  to \npartner financial intermediaries will be decided by the Government and agreed by ADB. Lending \ninterest rates of the Government\u2019s development assistance fund are expected to be used as a \nreference interest rate for subsidiary loans unless otherwise agreed between ADB and MOF.45  \n                                                 \n45  The  current  normal  rate  of  interest  applicable  to  funds  from  the  Government\u2019s  development  assistance  is  about \n12%. MARD has proposed to MOF that a preferential interest rate be applied to the credit line to be provided for \n\n\f \n\n15 \n\nPartner  financial  intermediaries  will  utilize  the  subsidiary  loan  proceeds  for  lending  to \n47. \neligible household beneficiaries under the Project for construction of biogas digesters. Loans to \nhouseholds  will  carry  terms  and  conditions  as  currently  being  applied  by  partner  financial \nintermediaries  (which  may  be  amended  from  time  to  time).  Interest  rates  for  subloans  to \nhouseholds  will  be  determined  based  on  relending  rates  from  MOF  to  partner  financial \nintermediaries  plus  a  margin  agreed  between  MOF  and  partner  financial  intermediaries.  The \nactual lending interest rates to households will be agreed upon in subsidiary loan agreements \nbetween MOF and partner financial intermediaries, and ensure that households have access to \naffordable  financing  for  biogas  digester  construction.  Households  in  the  project  provinces  that \nare currently supported and recommended by the SNV-funded biogas development project are \nalso eligible for loans from partner financial intermediaries, if these households have demand for \nsuch  loans.  Technical  and  environmental  criteria  related  to  biogas  will  be  added  to  partner \nfinancial  intermediaries\u2019  standard  loan  eligibility  criteria  to  ensure  loans  reach  the  Project\u2019s \ntargeted  clientele.  For  each  biogas  loan  amount,  ADB  will  finance  81.8%,  partner  financial \nintermediaries  will  finance  9.1%,  and  households  will  contribute  9.1%  in  labor.  However, \ndisbursement of funds for the biogas investment credit facility will be subject to (i) entry by the \nfinancial intermediaries into a project agreement with ADB, and (ii) entry by the Government into \na  subsidiary  loan  agreement  with  the  financial  intermediary(ies)  concerned,  with  terms  and \nconditions satisfactory to ADB. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \n48.  MARD  will  be  the  project  executing  agency  (EA).  A  CPMU  will  be  established  in  the \nAgricultural  Projects  Management  Board  (APMB) \nfor  overall  project  coordination  and \nmanagement.  A  total  of  16  PPMUs  will  be  established  in  the  DARDs  for  local  project \nmanagement. The Department of Crop Production (DCP)  will establish an IPMU to  implement \nactivities related to institutional and regulatory development on quality and safety. The DLP will \nestablish a BPMU to implement the biogas development program. A credit line provided under \nthe  Project  will  be  administered  by  the  MOF  and  utilized  by  partner  financial  intermediaries  to \nfinance eligible household biogas investments, which will be carried out at the local level by its \nprovincial  branches.  The  Project  will  open  one  first-generation  imprest  account  (FGIA)  to  be \noperated by CPMU and a FGIA to be operated by the MOF to finance the biogas credit lines to \npartner financial intermediaries. A total of 20 second-generation imprest accounts (SGIAs) will \nbe established, one for each of the 16 PPMUs, one for the IPMU, one for the BPMU, and one \nfor  each  of  the  two  partner  financial  intermediaries.  MARD  and  all  agencies  proposed  as  IAs \nhave  adequate  financial  and  management  capacity  and  experience  to  implement  the  Project. \nThese are government budget-spending units, with staff capable of using standard government \naccounting  and  financial  management  systems.  The  APMB,  DCP,  DLP,  and  DARDs  have \nincluding  ADB  projects.  The  Project\u2019s \nimplemented  significant  donor-funded  projects, \norganizational chart is presented in Appendix 6.46    \n \n \n \n49. \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 7.  \n \n\nThe Project will be implemented over 6 years from July 2009 to June 2015. The Project \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n2. \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \nconstruction  of  biogas  digesters  under  the  Project,  considering  the  contribution  of  the  biogas  plants  in  improving \nwater quality and environmental hygiene as part of the water and environmental hygiene program of MARD. \n\n46  The  detailed  organizational  structure  for  CPMU,  DCP/IPMU,  DLP/BPMU,  and  PPMUs,  and  broad  terms  of \n\nreference for their respective staff are in the Supplementary Appendix H. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n50. \nA procurement plan is outlined in Appendix 8 with indicative procurement and recruitment \ncontracts.  No  international  procurement  is  envisaged  under  the  Project.  Prior  and  post  review \nthresholds were discussed and agreed with the EA and are included in the plan. Procurement \nwill mainly be undertaken by the CPMU.  Goods, works, and services financed by ADB will be \nprocured  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime). Packages for works valued at less than $2.0 million or equivalent but more than $100,000 \nor equivalent, and packages for goods valued at less than $1.0 million or equivalent but more \nthan  $100,000  or  equivalent,  will  be  procured  using  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB) \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  For  goods  and  works  packages  valued  below  $100,000  or \nequivalent,  shopping  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  will  be  used.  Plant  and  seed  varieties \nrequired  for  the  Project  to  replace  pest-  and  disease-susceptible  varieties  will  be  purchased \ndirectly  from  a  list  of  prequalified  and  approved  government-owned  research  institutes  (in \nabsence  of  a  market,  commercial  seeds  are  available  primarily  from  government  institutes). \nDirect contracting will be used to procure seed varieties required for the Project.  \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n51. \nThe Project will require a total of 208 person-months of consultant services, including 60 \nperson-months  of  international  and  148  person-months  of  national  consultant  services  in  the \nfields  of  (i)  management  of  agricultural  product  quality  and  safety  systems;  (ii)  policy, \nregulations  and  institutional  development;  (iii)  monitoring  and  evaluation;  (iv)  applied  research \nand development for agricultural product quality and safety; (v) risk analysis; (vi) communication \nand  training  programs;  (vii)  social  development;  (viii)  environmental  assessment;  (ix)  financial \nmanagement; (x) biogas technology; and (xi) rural infrastructure.47 The international specialist in \nagricultural product quality and safety management will act as the team leader.The consultants \nwill be recruited through a firm following the quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) process, \nwith a 90:10 quality-cost ratio due to the specialized nature of the Project, and  in accordance \nwith ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n52. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed  with  MARD  and  APMB.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of MARD, APMB, CPMU, IMPU, BPMU, PPMUs, \nall contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \nThe project design and implementation arrangements provide for mitigation of corruption risks. \nRisks  associated  with  project  management,  including  procurement  and  disbursement,  will  be \nmitigated  by  (i)  engaging  an  international  consultant  and  a  national  consultant  to  advise  and \nassist in the procurement of goods and services, and the engagement of other consultants; (ii) \nintroducing a dual signing system in which the civil works contractor awarded the contract will \nalso sign an anticorruption contract with the employer; and (iii) periodic inspection by the CPMU \nof the contractor\u2019s activities relating to fund withdrawals and settlements. \n\n \n5. \n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n47 Detailed consultant terms of reference are in Supplementary Appendix I. \n\n\f \n\n17 \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n53. \nTo  ensure  effective  project  implementation  and  timely  loan  disbursement,  the \nGovernment  will  establish  two  or  more  FGIAs  at  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB \nimmediately after loan effectiveness for the exclusive use of ADB loan proceeds. One FGIA will \nbe administered by the MARD (CPMU) to finance project activities and the other FGIA will be \noperated  by  the  MFIs  to  finance  the  biogas  credit  lines.  The  maximum  ceiling  for  the  CPMU \nFGIA will be 6 months of estimated expenditures to be funded from the CPMU FGIA, or $8.29 \nmillion  (10%  of  $82.85  million),  whichever  is  lower.  The  maximum  ceiling  for  the  FGIA  for  the \nbiogas  credit  line  will  be  6  months  of  estimated  expenditures  to  be  funded  from  the  FGIA,  or \n$1.215  million  (10%  of the  credit line  of  $12.15  million),  whichever  is lower.  Funds  will  flow  to \nthe  various  IAs  (DCP-IPMU,  DLP-BPMU,  PPMUs,  and  partner  financial  intermediaries)  to \nfinance  the  activities  they  are  individually  responsible  for.  The  DCP-IPMU,  DLP-BPMU,  and \neach of the 16 PPMUs will establish an SGIA at the provincial treasury of the respective project \nprovince  to  ensure  proper  management  of  the  provincial  accounts  to  finance  eligible  activities \nrelated to quality and safety. Loan proceeds will be made available from the FGIA to the SGIAs. \nThe maximum ceiling of each SGIA will be equivalent to 6 months estimated expenditures to be \nfunded  from  the  SGIA,  or  $300,000,  whichever  is  lower.  The  SGIAs  are  required  for  locally \npurchased equipment and materials, contractual services, and small-scale training activities at \ngeographically  dispersed  locations  in  the  16  project  provinces,  and  will  be  managed  by  the \nIPMU,  BPMU,  and  PPMUs,  which  will  prepare  liquidation  and  replenishment  requests  for  the \nSGIAs.  These  will  be  submitted  to  the  CPMU,  which  will  consolidate  the  requests  and  send \nthem  to  MOF.  Disbursements  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n54. \nFor the biogas credit line, two SGIAs will be opened and managed by the head offices of \neach of the two partner financial intermediaries. The maximum ceiling will be the lower of (i) 6 \nmonths  of  estimated  biogas  loan  disbursements  funded  through  the  SGIA;  or  (ii)  10%  of  the \ncredit  line  amount  in  accordance  with  the  subsidiary  loan  agreement  between  MOF  and  the \nfinancial  intermediary.  Partner  financial  intermediaries  will  utilize  their  own  internal  systems  to \ntransfer  the  subsidiary  loan  proceeds  to  their  local  branches  in  the  16  project  provinces  to \nextend  biogas  loans.  The  subsidiary  loan  proceeds  will  be  exclusively  for  financing  the \nconstruction  of  biogas  digesters.  The  biogas  loan  portfolio  will  be  accounted  for  and  reported \nseparately. Partner financial intermediaries will submit requests for ADB financing through MOF, \nusing the list of biogas loans actually extended, and based on the needs of the Project.   \n \nAll the imprest accounts, including the SGIAs, will be established, managed, replenished, \n55. \nand  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended \nfrom  time  to  time)  and  the  financial  regulations  of  the  Government.  The  accounts  will  be \nliquidated  and  replenished  according  to  ADB's  statement  of  expenditures  (SOE)  procedures, \nbased on withdrawal applications submitted to ADB from time to time. Each individual payment \nreimbursed or liquidated using the SOE procedures will not exceed $100,000 equivalent. \n \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n7. \n \n\n \n\n56.  CPMU, DCP-IPMU, DLP-BPMU, PPMUs, and partner financial intermediaries involved in \nproject implementation will maintain records and accounts that identify goods and services from \nloan  proceeds,  financing  resources  received,  expenditures  incurred,  and  use  of  local  funds. \nThese  accounts  will  be  established  and  maintained  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting \nprinciples  and  internationally  accepted  accounting  standards.  The  CPMU  will  review  and \nconsolidate the accounts and have them audited annually in accordance with sound accounting \npractices by the sovereign audit agency of the Government or other auditors acceptable to ADB. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nThe  audit  report  will include  a  statement  verifying  whether or  not  the  funds  disbursed  by  ADB \nwere used for the purposes for which they were provided, as well as the auditor\u2019s opinion on the \nuse of the imprest accounts (including the SGIAs) and SOE procedures. Copies of the audited \naccounts  and  auditor\u2019s  report  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  within  6  months  after  the  end  of  each \nfinancial year. The CPMU will prepare consolidated quarterly reports indicating progress made, \nproblems  encountered  during  the  period,  steps  taken  or  proposed  to  remedy  the  problems, \nproposed program of activities, and progress expected for the next quarter. Within 3 months of \nphysical  completion  of  the  Project,  the  CPMU  will  submit  to  ADB  a  completion  report  that \ndescribes achievements in relation to the Project\u2019s expected impact, outcome, and outputs.  \n \n\n8. \n \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n57.  CPMU will establish and maintain a project performance management system designed \nto  permit  adequate  flexibility  to  adopt  remedial  action  regarding  project  design,  schedules, \nactivities,  and  development  impacts.  The  system  will  adopt  gender  disaggregated  indicators, \nincluding  those  specified  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework,  regarding:  (i)  physical \nprogress of the implementation of specified component and/or subcomponent activities; (ii) the \nnumber and area of SAZs, with soil and water monitoring data; (iii) the safe agricultural product \nmodel areas established, their area, and number of farmers involved; (iv) the quantity and value \nof agro-products produced that are certified as safe; (v) the volume of agro-products traded in \nwholesale  markets  and  supermarkets  that  are  certified  as  safe;  (vi)  the  number  and  type  of \nlaboratory  tests  completed  on  agro-product  quality  and  safety;  (vii)  changes  in  farm  incomes \nand poverty incidence; and (viii) social development. The CPMU will confirm achievable targets, \nfirm up monitoring and recording arrangements, and establish systems and procedures no later \nthan 6 months after project inception. Baseline and progress data will be reported by the IPMU, \nBPMU, and PPMUs to  the CPMU  at the requisite time intervals, including annual reporting on \nthe environmental management plan. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n58. \nADB  will  conduct  regular  (at  least  twice  per  year)  reviews  throughout  project \nimplementation  to  assess  implementation  performance  and  achievement  of  project  outcomes \nand  objectives,  examine  financial  progress,  and  identify  issues  and  constraints  affecting  the \nProject and work out time-bound action plans for their resolution. ADB and the Government will \nundertake a midterm review to assess implementation status and take measures (which could \ninclude  modification  of  scope  and  implementation  arrangements  and  reallocation  of  loan \nproceeds) as appropriate. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \nAssociated TA will be provided to strengthen project management and develop strategies \n59. \nand  options  for  expanding  Viet  Nam\u2019s  biogas  program.  Part  1  of  the  TA  will  provide  startup \nsupport  for  the  Project,  including  oversight  and  capacity  building.  The  oversight  function  will \nprovide advisory support to the Government on how to effectively implement and monitor project \nactivities related to the quality and safety of agricultural products and biogas development. Part \n2 will provide a design for an investment to expand biogas development involving: (i) technical \ndesign  of  biogas  plants  of  varying  sizes  for  farm  households  and  medium-  to  large-scale \ncommercial  livestock  farms,  based  on  field  testing,  demonstration,  and  applied  research \nactivities  (para.  39);  (ii)  determination  of  credit  financing  options  for  different  socioeconomic \ngroups;  (iii)  determination  of  a  geographical  expansion  plan  and  strategy;  (iv)  design  of  a \npractical  institutional  and  management  structure  for  expanded  biogas  development;  and  (v) \ndevelopment  of  CDM  projects.  The  estimated  cost  of  the  TA  is  about  $1.8  million,  of  which \n\n\f \n\n19 \n\nabout  $1.5  million  will  be  financed  under  the  Project  through  an  ADB  grant,  with  $0.3  million \nfinanced  by  the  Government  in  the  form  of  incremental  administrative  expenses,  office  space, \nlocal  travel,  and  per  diem  for  counterpart  staff.  The  TA  will  require  103  person-months  of \nconsultant  services,  comprising  46  person-months  of  international  consultant  and  57  person-\nmonths of national consultant services. All consultants will be recruited by ADB in accordance \nwith ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Individual consultants will be recruited for part \n1,  while  a  firm  will  be  recruited,  using  the  QCBS  procedure,  for  part  2.  In  view  of  the  highly \nspecialized nature of the consultant inputs a 90:10 quality-cost ratio will be used in consultant \nselection. Details of the proposed TA are presented in Appendix 9.  \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits and Impacts  \n\n \nA. \n \n60. \nProject  Benefits  and  Impact  on  Policy/Strategy  Implementation.  The  Project  is \ndesigned to support the Government\u2019s effort to implement a comprehensive legal and regulatory \nframework related to food safety and quality, including a law on product standards, labels, and \ninspection, ordinance on food hygiene and safety, and the national action plan for food safety. It \nwill also facilitate the implementation of the national strategy for environment protection (2001\u2013\n2020)  which  (i)  aims  to  halt  the  spread  of  pollution,  restore  degraded  areas,  improve  overall \nenvironmental  quality,  and  ensure  achievement  of  sustainable  national  development;  and  (ii) \nrecognizes  and  guarantees  that  all  citizens  are  entitled  to  live  in  an  environment  where  the \nquality of the air, land, and water meets standards stipulated by the State. Moreover, the Project \nwill assist the implementation of the national energy policy, which focuses on renewable energy \ndevelopment as a substitute for firewood in line with the forest protection strategy. The Project \nwill  provide  timely  support  to  the  implementation  of  these  policies  and  strategies  along  with \ncreation of SAZs and biogas development. These will help realize the main objective of SEDP  \n2006\u20132010 to attain middle-income nation status by late 2010.48 \n \n61. \nSocioeconomic  impacts.  The  project  area  covers  about  3.9  million  ha  of  agricultural \nland,  with  about  3.6  million  rural  households  (or  an  equivalent  of  18  million  people)  in  16 \nprovinces,  where  the  rural  poverty  incidence  is  estimated  at  25.9%  compared  to  the  national \naverage of 22.0% (2005 data). 49 Main benefits attributable to the Project will include:  \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nincremental benefits from increased crop yields and productivity through adoption \nof high yield and tolerant seed varieties, IPM, and GAPs. An estimated 6.5 million \nfarmers  will  directly  benefit  from  the  project  interventions.  The  Project  is  also \nexpected  to  generate  employment  for  about  1.4  million  people  involved  in  the \npost-production food chain for tea, fruits and vegetables. As a result, the Project \nwill make significant contributions to rural poverty reduction within and outside of \nthe project provinces;50 \nhealth  cost  savings  realized  through  safe  agricultural  products  (tea,  fruits,  and \nvegetables)  and  improved  livestock  waste  management.  It  is  expected  that  a \nsignificant  reduction  in  the  occurrence  of  food-  and  waterborne  diseases  will \nimprove human health in the project area, resulting in increased labor productivity \n\n                                                 \n48 Detailed policy and economic justifications are in Appendix 10. \n49 The Project\u2019s poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 11. \n50 The  average  poverty  incidence  In  project  provinces  was  estimated  to  be  25.9%.  The  project  interventions  will \ncontribute significantly to reduction of the national poverty incidence (expected to reach about 15.0% by 2010). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nand  reduced  treatment  and  hospital  costs.51    Likewise,  replacement  of  charcoal \nand firewood by biogas for cooking will have direct health benefits to women;  \ncost  savings  from  substitution  of  biogas-derived  energy  for  firewood,  kerosene, \ncoal,  and  liquefied  petroleum  gas  (LPG)  used  for  cooking  and  lighting.  The \nProject  will  contribute  to  energy  savings  among  rural  households  as  biogas \nproduced by the digesters will serve as an alternative energy source for cooking \nand  lighting.  An  estimated  40,000  households  will  benefit  from  this  alternative \nenergy source;  \navailability  of  bio-slurry  as  a  safer  organic  fertilizer  than  untreated  manure.52 \nWhile farmers are currently using manure for their crops, the untreated manure is \nconsidered  unsafe  for  water,  air,  and  soil.  Although  no  empirical  evidence  is \navailable  on  the  incremental  impact  on  crop  yields  in  Viet  Nam  of  bio-slurry \nversus manure that is otherwise treated, elsewhere bio-slurry has been claimed \nto be a better fertilizer than artificially treated manure;53 and \nreduced water, air, and soil pollution as a result of biogas digester installation and \noperation,  because  domestic  and  livestock  wastes  will  be  better  managed  and \ntreated.  It  is  estimated  that  the  proposed  biogas  development  will  reduce  CO2 \nemissions by an equivalent of about 40,000\u201360,000 tons of CO2 per annum.  \n\n \n62. \nA  number  of  other  benefits  will  be  attributable  to  the  Project.  First,  the  combination  of \nfood safety and biogas-related activities will create better-paid employment opportunities in local \nareas  and  reduce  outmigration.  Second,  improvement  in  management  of  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  activities  will  reduce  the  annual  O&M  costs  paid  by  governments  and/or \nfarmers.  Third,  in  addition  to  adopting  IPM  and  GAPs,  participating  farmers  will  exchange \nexperience  and  skills  related  to  food  safety,  including  production  efficiency  and  productivity. \nFourth, women, as a major source of on-farm labor, will be exposed to new farming practices, \nknowledge and skills, which will improve their social and economic status. Women comprise half \nof  all  workers  in  the  agriculture  sector,  and  contribute  more  hours  of  labor  to  cultivation,  and \nprocessing  and  marketing  of  agricultural  produce  than  men.  Replacement  of  charcoal  and \nfirewood with biogas for cooking will reduce health risks for women by providing a clean kitchen \nenvironment.  Finally,  project  interventions\u2014such  as  establishment  of  SAZs  and  training  of \nfarmers  regarding  GAPs  and  other  farm  food  safety  standards-based practices\u2014will  positively \nimpact ethnic minorities in the project area.54 The Project\u2019s gender action plan ensures women \nwill  be  equitably  benefited  from  the  Project  (Appendix  12).  Detailed  analyses  are  in  Appendix \n10. \n \nProject interventions, including the establishment of SAZs, will not alter the current land \n63. \nholding  structure,  and  are  not  expected  to  entail  involuntary  resettlement.  Infrastructure  within \nSAZs will only be constructed on public land or where communities agree to donate their land in \nexchange  for  benefits.  The  Project\u2019s  social  development  specialist  will  undertake  a  social \nassessment at each model site in consultation with landowners and stakeholders. A summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is presented in Appendix 11. \n \n64. \nEnvironmental  Impact.  The  Project  is  designed  to  contribute  to  safer,  better  quality \nagricultural  outputs  and  reduce  health  hazards  from  livestock  wastes.  The  Project  has  been \n\n                                                 \n51  According  to  Viet  Nam  Food  Administration,  poisoning  from  microbiological  contamination  and  excessive \npesticides in fruits, tea, and vegetable products accounted for about 30% of all food poisoning cases (Tran Dang. \n2008, presentation to food safety working group meeting, 28 March 2008, Viet Nam Food Administration. Ha Noi). \n52 In traditional practice, domestic and livestock waste is collected, piled up and covered with pond mud for about a \n\nmonth before being applied to crops as \u201corganic fertilizer\u201d.  \n\n53 Information was derived from the SNV report on biogas operation. \n54 The Project is classified as category B for indigenous peoples. \n\n\f \n\n21 \n\nclassified  as  environmental  category  B  (non-sensitive)  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment \nPolicy (2002). An initial environmental examination (IEE) was carried out to assess the overall \nproject impacts, and revealed no significant adverse environmental impacts. Potential adverse \nimpacts associated with construction or improvement of existing small-scale infrastructure in the \nestablished  SAZs  are  temporary,  minor,  and  localized  in  extent  and  can  be  mitigated  to \nacceptable levels. The environmental assessment and review framework (EARF) will guide the \nenvironmental assessment, with institutional responsibilities for the subprojects to be identified \nduring  implementation.  Relevant  environmental  reports,  including  a  summary  IEE,  IEE,  and \nEARF, are presented in Supplementary Appendix J. \n \nB. \n\nRisks \n\n65.  Risks that may hinder realization of the expansion of opportunities to supply safe, quality \nfruit, vegetable and tea products to the domestic and export markets are: (i) producers of agro-\nproducts (i.e., vegetables, fruits, and tea) may not be fully convinced of the need to comply with \nnational  and  international  quality  standards;  and  (ii)  promotional  strategies  may  be  unable  to \nbuild  consumer  trust  and  confidence  and  increase  awareness  and  recognition  of  safe  agro-\nproduct brands, particularly regarding their certification schemes and logos, because of frequent \npast food safety scares. These risks would render Vietnamese agro-products unable to compete \nwith  foreign-produced  agricultural  products  in  the  domestic  and  international  markets.  The \nProject is designed to reduce these risks by building institutional capacity for effective regulation \nand enforcement of standards, and by strengthening the capacity of agricultural production and \nmarketing  units  along  the  supply  chain,  backed  by  certification,  promotion,  and  an  intensive \ninformation,  education,  and  communication  campaign.  The  approach  will \nthe \ninternationally  recognized  principles  of  HACCP  to  assure  buyers  that  all  parties  involved  in \nproducing  and  handling  safe  quality  products  are  independently  monitored,  and  that  products \nmeet  stringent  food  safety  standards.  The  Project  will  assist  the  Government  in  the  continued \ndevelopment and review of standards to meet international market requirements. \n \n66. \nSuccessful  reduction  of  risks  to  agro-product  safety  and  health  quality  through  biogas \ndevelopment will require strong project management capacity and coordination at the provincial \nlevel  between  the  DARDs  and  financial  intermediaries.  There  is  also  a  risk  that  the  Biogas \nDevelopment Program may be delayed and may not attain the target of 40,000 households due \nto (i) an inadequate supply of trained masons to construct the biogas digesters, resulting from a \nlack  of  interest  in  participating  in  the  biogas  development  program;  and  (ii)  failure  by  targeted \nlivestock  producers  to  avail  themselves  of  credit,  due  to  non-acceptance  of  the  biogas \ntechnology.  To  mitigate  these  risks,  the  Project  will  disseminate  information  on  the  Biogas \nDevelopment Program as well as provide training on masonry. Enhanced support from both the \nGovernment  and  SNV  will  provide  training  for  masons  and  households  and  dissemination  of \ninformation  on  biogas  technology.  In  order  to  ensure  that  financial  assistance  is  accessible  to \nsmall livestock production units, the Department of Livestock Production and provincial DARDs \nwill work with partner financial intermediaries to extend microcredit support.  \n \nC. \n\nSustainability \n\nfollow \n\nThe  institutional  backbone  of  the  Project  will  be  formed  through  establishment  of  a \n67. \nstanding committee on food safety for overall coordination of food safety issues, a food safety \nmonitoring unit at NAFIQAD, a crop food safety management unit at DCP, and subunits for food \nsafety at DARDs. These will not significantly increase staff numbers or other incremental costs. \nThe  Government  has  assured  ADB  of  adequate  counterpart  funds  for  project  implementation \nand for O&M of the food safety system, equipment and facilities established and procured under \nthe  Project.  Ongoing  ADB-funded  projects  will  enhance  the  Project\u2019s  sustainability  (these \ninclude  the  Agriculture  Science  and  Technology  Project),  and  cover:  (i)  client-oriented \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nagricultural  research  and  capacity  strengthening;  (ii)  grassroots  agricultural  extension \nimprovement; and (iii) rural-based technical and vocational training. The Government\u2019s Biogas \nProgram aims to enhance technical and promotional capacity for biogas usage in Viet Nam. The \nGovernment  has  assured  ADB  that  the  Netherlands-funded  project  TA  for  biogas  will  be \nexpanded in all 16 project provinces. The proposed associated TA for project management and \ndeveloping  strategies  and  options  for  expanding  the  biogas  development  component  into  a \nnational biogas program will further enhance project sustainability.  \n\n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n\nA.   \n\n \n68. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nThe Government will ensure that:  \n\nInformation, education, and communication activities are carried out in all project \nprovinces  to  promote  the  replication  of  safe  agriculture  production  models  and \nbiogas technology application and utilization. \nConsistent with the decision related to the national action plan for food safety and \nits  implementation  directive,55  and  the  decree  on  food  safety  management,56 \nunits for food safety monitoring, information, and communication will be piloted at \nNAFIQAD; food safety units will be piloted at DCP; and subunits for food safety \nwill be piloted at the project province DARDs. \nProvisions  for  staff  at  the  central,  provincial,  district,  and  commune  level  in  the \nproject  provinces  will  be  made  to  facilitate  the  implementation  of  food  safety \nregulations and policies by reassigning or adding responsibilities to existing staff, \nor identifying new staff to carry out the tasks of food safety specialists and food \nsafety facilitators. \nProvincial governments complete the identification, designation, and registration \nof  SAZ  plans  prior  to  undertaking  any  physical  construction  activities  under  the \nProject; \nThe SNV Support Project to the Biogas Program will be expanded further to the \nremaining six project provinces i.e., Ben Tre, Binh Thuan, Da Nang, Ho Chi Minh,  \nLam  Dong,  and  Ninh  Thuan.  If  funding  from  SNV  is  not  be  forthcoming  (as \nagreed  upon  between  SNV,  the  Government,  and  ADB),  the  Government  will \nfund expansion of the biogas program to the six project provinces. \nPartner financial intermediaries will onlend loan proceeds to household borrowers \nin strict accordance with the criteria agreed upon by the Government  and ADB. \nSubloans to households will comply with terms and conditions, including interest \nrates being applied by partner financial intermediaries, as may be amended from \ntime to time. Technical and environmental criteria related to biogas will be added \nto  partner  financial  intermediaries\u2019  standard  loan  eligibility  criteria  to  ensure  the \nProject\u2019s targeted clientele is reached. For each household loan, ADB will finance \n81.8%, partner financial intermediaries will finance 9.1%, and the household will \nfinance 9.1%57 of the total cost of a biogas digester.  \nProject activities will not cause significant environmental problems. Any potential \nadverse  environmental  impacts  will  be  managed  through  screening  of  final \n\n                                                 \n55 Prime  Minister\u2019s  Decision  on  the  approval  of  national  action  plan  on  the  assurance  of  food  safety  to  2010  No. \n43/2006/QD-TTg,  dated  20  February  2006;  and  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Directive  on  the  implementation  of  urgent \nmethods to assure food hygiene and safety No 06/2007/CT-TTg, dated 28 March 2007. \n\n56 Government Decree No. 79/2008/N\u0110-CP on the system of food safety management, inspection and testing, dated \n\n18 July 2008. \n\n57  Households provide a contribution equal in value to this percentage in the form of local materials and/or labor.  \n\n\f \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n23 \n\nincorporation  of  appropriate  mitigation  measures  and \ninvestment  plans, \nenvironmental  monitoring  during  implementation.  The  Government  will  ensure \nthat  its  laws  and  regulations  governing  environmental  impact  assessments,  as \nwell as ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) are followed. If there is any discrepancy \nbetween the recipient\u2019s laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy, then \nADB\u2019s  policy  requirements  will  apply.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  MARD, \nfollowing  relevant  government  internal  processes,  carries  out  environmental \nassessments  prior  to  commencement  of  civil  works.  MARD  will  ensure  that  the \nassessments  (a)  meet  EARF  requirements,  and  (b)  include  details  of  local \nconsultations.  MARD  will  ensure  that  environmental  assessments  are  made \navailable at the PPMU office of each subproject province in a local language for \nthe public and other interested parties before the relevant subproject starts. \nProject  interventions  will  have  no  resettlement  impact.  Construction  of  new \nfacilities  will  be  carried  out  on  existing  sites  on  public  land,  free  from  all \nencumbrances,  habitation,  dispute  or  controversy,  and  proposals  for  civil  works \nwill include confirmation that no land acquisition or resettlement will be required \nunder  the  Project.  In  the  event  of  unforeseen  land  acquisition  or  involuntary \nresettlement,  the  Government  will  immediately  inform  ADB  and  prepare  the \nnecessary  planning  documents \nInvoluntary \nResettlement Policy (1995). \n\nin  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s \n\n  Project  activities  will  be  implemented  in  line  with  the  proposed  gender  action \nplan.

2001\u20132006,  Viet  Nam\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  grew  at  an  average  of \n1. \n7.8% per year. In per capita terms, this was equivalent to about 6.7% per year, implying a rise in \nGDP per capita from $415 to $725 over the same period. The country\u2019s agriculture sector also \ngrew steadily at an annual growth rate of 4%,  despite generally weak international commodity \nprices, especially over the last 3 years, and contributed about 20.4% to national GDP in 2006. \nCrops constitute about 59% of the total agriculture sector production value, followed by fisheries \n(19%), livestock (17%), and forestry (5%). Among major crops, the average annual production \ngrowth rates of vegetables (6.2%), fruits (3.5%), and tea (11.8%) were robust, and contributed \nsignificantly to the growth in the country\u2019s agricultural product exports. Among Southeast Asian \ncountries,  Viet  Nam  has  emerged  as  the  largest  tea  producer,  second  in  the  production  of \nvegetables,  and  third  in  fruit  production,  due  mainly  to  growth  and  expansion  of  commercial \nfarms and small-scale agro-enterprises. The development of the livestock industry has likewise \nbeen vigorous in past years, both in quantity and size. Despite growth in the crop and livestock \nsubsectors, however, the poverty incidence remains higher in rural than in urban areas,1 and the \nlevel of private sector investment remains low. \n\nAgriculture sector growth over the past decade, particularly in crops, can be attributed to \n2. \na combination of: (i) the Government\u2019s market-oriented economic policy, which was launched in \n1986  and  led  to  progressive  decontrol  of  prices  and  market  functions,  recognition  of  farm \nhouseholds  as  the  key  unit  of  production  and  marketing,  and  liberalized  land-use  rights;  (ii) \nincreased public investment in irrigation systems; and (iii) increased use of land, labor and agro-\nchemicals and fertilizers, particularly in rice production. Continued heavy reliance on increased \npublic spending on irrigation systems, however, will not be able to sustain agricultural growth in \nlight of the diminishing marginal returns from new irrigation investments and the substantial cost \nof  operating  and  maintaining  these  systems.  Moreover,  further  increases  in  agricultural \nproduction,  especially  rice,  are  now  being  constrained  by  increasing  input  prices,  declining \nrevenues from rice exports due to weak international prices, limits to productivity of agricultural \ninputs and financial capacity of farmers, and limits on further expansion of the rural labor force \nand land for agricultural cultivation.  \n \n3. \nAgriculture provides employment for about 57% of the country\u2019s workforce, mainly from \nrural  areas,  where  about  73%  of  the  population  resides  and  where  most  of  the  poor  (about \n70%)2  are  located.3  An  alternative  strategy  for  sustainable  agricultural  growth  is  needed  to \nsupport  the  country\u2019s  economic  growth  and  attainment  of  its  poverty  reduction  targets.  This \nstrategy  will  require  the  development  of:  (i)  diversified  farming  systems  that  are  adaptable  to \nvaried agro-ecological conditions; and (ii) more locally driven, productivity-based improvements \nin  quality  and  safety  for  increased  value  and  competitiveness  of  agricultural  products, \nparticularly high-value  crops.  There  is  growing interest  in supporting  commercial  production  of \nannual and perennial crops (e.g., vegetables, fruits, and tea) that have exhibited rapid growth, \nwith improved access to domestic and international markets. This is reflected by the expansion \nof areas under these crops, while areas under food grain cultivation have declined significantly \n\n                                                 \n1  For example, in rural Son La, the poverty incidence is 46%, while in Ho Chi MInh City, the poverty incidence is 4%. \n\nSource: Vietnam General Statistics Office. 2007.Statistical Yearbook of Vietnam 2006.

However, many \nimportant issues relating to agricultural diversification and food quality and safety still need to be \naddressed  by  the  Government  to  enable  agricultural  producers/traders  to  effectively  tap \ndomestic markets and compete globally. \n \n4. \nKey constraints to further increases in agricultural production and improvements in the \nefficiency  of  agricultural  product  marketing  include  low  product  quality,  poor  marketing,  weak \nbargaining  power,  and  unsafe  production  zones.5  These  constraints  are  compounded  by  the \nlack of knowledge on the part of farmers, primary processors, and traders regarding food safety \nhazards and techniques to address them. The competitiveness of the agriculture sector is also \nadversely  affected  by  small  farm  sizes  and  fragmented  landholdings,  which  constrain \neconomies  of  scale,  the  development  of  stronger  business  models,  and  the  provision  of \npostharvest  facilities.  In  light  of  these  constraints,  efforts  to  enhance  sector  competitiveness \nshould  be  based  on  an  overall  strategy  for  improving  access  by  major  players  to  advanced \nproduction  and  postharvest  technology  and  more  efficient  marketing.  These  efforts  must  be \ncomplemented  by  the  establishment  of  higher/stricter  quality  and  safety  standards  for \nagricultural products, and provision of services to facilitate access to financial assistance for the \ndevelopment of small and medium-scale enterprises, as well as the creation of safe agricultural \nzones6 to protect productive land from competing land development demands. \n \n5. \nThe trend away from food crop monoculture and toward crop diversification is expected \nto  continue  as  the  country\u2019s  economy  increasingly  integrates  with  the  world  market  through \nmembership in the World Trade Organization (WTO) and regional free trade agreements among \nSoutheast  Asian  countries.  An  immediate  challenge  facing  Viet  Nam  is  meeting  WTO \ncommitments related to the Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement.7 Viet Nam agreed to \nfully  comply  with  the  SPS  Agreement  immediately  upon  its  accession  to  the  WTO.8  The  SPS \nagreement  requires  that  Viet  Nam  notify  WTO  members  of  changes  to  Vietnam's  SPS \nmeasures  and  of  proposed  changes  that  are  not  consistent  with  an  agreed  international \nstandard,  so  that  countries  that  will  be  potentially  affected  by  the  proposed  measure  can  be \nconsulted during the drafting process. Viet Nam will need to strengthen the capacity of its newly \nestablished SPS notification authority and inquiry point to enable it to answer questions related \nto SPS measures. \n\n                                                 \n4  For example, the area devoted to vegetables doubled from about 300,000 hectares (ha) in 1994 to about 605,000 \nha in 2004. The growth in production of vegetable soybeans (10.5%) and pomelo (15.5%) was also notable. Total \narea under food grain production in 2000 was about 8.4 million ha, declining to about 8.3 million ha in 2007. \n\n5  These are agricultural production areas assessed as having high levels of pollution and contamination as well as \n\ninadequate safe water and market access infrastructure.   \n\n6  These  are  agricultural  lands  that  are  safeguarded  from  excessive  microbiological,  chemical,  and  heavy  metal \n\npollution and contamination. \n\n7  SPS measures include \u201cany  measure: to protect human  or animal  life or health from risks arising from additives, \ncontaminants, toxins or disease-causing organisms in food, beverages or foodstuffs; to protect human life or health \nfrom risks arising from diseases carried by animals, plants or products thereof, or from the entry, establishment or \nspread of pests; to protect animal or plant life or health from risks arising from the entry, establishment or spread of \npests, diseases, disease-carrying organism or disease causing organisms.\u201d (Source: Vergano, P. 2003, Vietnam's \nImplementation of the Transparency Provisions under TBT and SPS Agreement, EU, MUTRAP).

Ha Noi. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3    31 \n\nExporters and other businesses also need to be made more aware of the importance of \n6.  \nimplementing Codex Alimentarius9\n and WTO directives, as well as the need to certify that other \nstandards set by individual trading partners have been met. Mechanisms to trace suppliers need \nto  be  strengthened,  so  non-compliant  sources  can  be  determined  and  action  taken  against \nthese suppliers. Greater capacity will be needed to ensure that domestically produced products \nmeet international standards.10 The capacity of MARD staff to deal with these trade policy and \nenforcement issues requires strengthening.  \n \nAs  Viet  Nam  becomes  progressively  integrated  into  international  markets,  future \n7. \nagriculture sector growth will depend heavily on improved postproduction activities (i.e., grading, \nprocessing,  and  marketing)  and  measures  to  meet  more  stringent  market  requirements  for \nquality  and  safety.  Agro-industries  will  play  a  vital  role  in  the  development  of  export  markets, \nleading  to  further  product  development  and  expansion  of  other  sectors.  However,  these  agro-\nindustries will increasingly rely on farmers for a reliable and secure supply of raw materials of \nconsistent quality and safety, and will need to provide attractive terms and support services for \nthese  supplier  farmers.  In  addition,  the  Government  needs  to  sustain  efforts  to  improve  the \nperformance  of  state-owned  enterprises  under  the  State-Owned  Enterprises  Law,  and  further \nliberalize markets in order to promote viable private business opportunities in Viet Nam. \n \n8. \nAnother important aspect of the agricultural economy is the rapid growth in the livestock \nsubsector,  which  accounts  for  about  17%  of  the  total  agricultural  production  value,  and  has \ngrown  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  14%  during  2001\u20132006,11  mainly  as  a  result  of  swine \nproduction, which comprises about 80% of total livestock production.12 Most of this production \ntakes  place  within  an  integrated  crop,  livestock,  and  fish  pond  system,  and  up  to  40%  of \nhouseholds  grow  both  livestock  and  vegetables.13  The  rapid  recent  growth  in  the  livestock \npopulation has increased concerns regarding the adverse impacts of traditional livestock waste \ndisposal  methods,  particularly  on  environmental  quality,  including  water,  soil,  and  air,  and  the \nsubsequent impacts on the quality and safety of agricultural crops and other agro-products. To \naddress  this  concern  and  to  develop  alternative  and  clean  energy  sources  the  Government, \nthrough  a  grant  provided  by  the  Government  of  the  Netherlands,14  initiated  its  national  biogas \nprogram  in  2003  to  contain  and  improve  the  management  of  livestock  waste  disposal  in \nselected  provinces.  The  program  was  designed  to  mitigate  and  avert  further  environmental \npollution  in  major  livestock  production  areas,  and  thereby  ensure  the  quality  and  safety  of \nagricultural food products such as fruits and vegetables. It also aimed to improve the health of \nthe affected population. The program has attained nationwide success, mainly as a result of: (i) \na well-established legal framework for program implementation and cooperation among relevant \ngovernment  agencies,  participating  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  private \norganizations; (ii) application of appropriate technology that small farm investors can afford; and \n\n                                                 \n9  Viet Nam had adopted about 60% of CODEX standards relating to food and foodstuffs as of 2005, and planned to \nadopt  all  remaining  ones  (Source:  Ministry  of  Trade/European  Union.  2005.

A  total  of  45,000  biogas  plants  have  been  constructed \nunder the program in 30 provinces during 2003\u20132007. Increasing demand for biogas technology \namong  small  farm  households  has resulted  in  implementation  of  a  second  phase  (until  2011). \nDespite the growing demand for biogas technology among farmers, research and development \nin  the  design  and  financial  viability  of  various  sizes  of  biogas  plants,  particularly  medium  and \nlarge biogas plants, is still needed. \n \n9. \nThe  Government  recognizes  that  continued  agricultural  growth  will  require  both \ndiversified  farming  systems  (i.e.,  crop  and  livestock  farming  systems)  appropriate  for  varied \nagro-ecological  conditions  and  more  locally  driven  improvements  in  competitiveness,  quality \nand  safety,  and  the  value  of  agro-products.  Consequently,  the  Government  has  aimed  to  (i) \npromote  production  and  processing  of  high-value  products;  (ii)  improve  agricultural  research, \nextension, and market-information services; (iii) intensify efforts to ensure better product quality \nand  food  safety  based  on  sound  agricultural  practices;  and  (iv)  promote  competitive  business \nand  agro-based  products.  The  proposed  Project  is  consistent  with  Government\u2019s  efforts  to \naddress  these  concerns  and  issues  and  is  envisioned  to  contribute  significantly  to  its  strategy \nfor improving the quality and safety of agricultural products.  \n \nB. \n \nCurrent achievements in production growth are unfortunately being undermined by high \n10. \nenvironmental  and  health  risks  resulting  from  excessive  fertilizer  use  (on  average  about  220 \nkilograms/ha)15 by Viet Nam\u2019s farmers, which is one of the highest input rates in Asia and the \nPacific. Crop yields have not increased in recent years despite substantial increases in fertilizer \nand agro-chemical usage, which has in turn been found to increase environmental  and health \nrisks.16  Moreover,  the  lack  of  appropriate  production  management,  particularly  with  regard  to \ndisposal of livestock waste in densely populated areas, has contaminated water, land, and air, \nand  greater  effort  must  be  expended  to  contain  and  improve  livestock  waste  disposal,  and  to \npromote  effective  waste  treatment/management  technology.  An  estimated  73  million  tons  of \nlivestock waste are improperly disposed of annually into ponds, channels, sewers, etc., or left in \nfields,  which  eventually  pollutes  the  surrounding  areas.  About  90%  of  wastewater  samples \ntaken from livestock farms did not meet applicable standards (TCVN5945-1995), especially with \nregard  to  biological  oxygen  demand  and  chemical  oxygen  demand  levels.17    Moreover,  if  left \nuntreated, the waste is estimated to emit some 17.52 million tons of CO2 .18  \n \n11. \nAs  a  consequence,  these  biological  contaminants  have  created  serious  environmental \nproblems  that  have  adversely  affected  the  health  of  the  affected  communities.  Frequent \nincidents  of  environmental  damage  and  poisoning  from  agro-chemicals  and  biological \ncontaminants have made consumers more conscious of the need for higher/stricter quality and \nsafety standards for marketed agricultural products. Although a growing number of processors \nand  exporters  have  modern  value  chains  and  established  quality  and  safety  certification \nsystems that meet export market requirements,19 and are certified and audited by international \n\n                                                 \n15  FAO. 2007.

These \u201cfree producers\u201d not only bring average prices \nand  quality  down,  but  inevitably  add  to  the  contamination  risk  faced  by  exporters,  processors, \nand  consumers,  and  contribute  to  negative  environmental  and  public  health  impacts.  These \nissues  will  not  be  effectively  addressed  in  the  absence  of  a  domestic  \u201csafe  food\u201d  supply \nframework/strategy;  if  left  unchecked,  they  will  continue  to  negatively  impact  the  environment \nand public health.  \n \n12.    The need for improvements in product quality and food safety has also become a critical \nissue in the context of improving Viet Nam\u2019s global competitiveness, which will necessitate the \nelimination of inefficiencies in product marketing and procurement of input supplies, and in other \nfactors that contribute to the increased cost (to Government and the private sector) of providing \nagricultural  support  services.  Moreover,  the  lack  of  appropriate  production  management, \nparticularly with regard to disposal of livestock waste in densely populated areas, has resulted in \nserious  environmental  problems  (through  water,  land,  and  air  pollution),  with  consequential \nadverse impacts on the health of the affected communities. \n \nC. \n \n13. \nThe  Government\u2019s  policy  focus  must  shift  from  increasing  production  volume  to \npromoting higher product value and income, if Viet Nam\u2019s farmers, processors, and traders are \nto  be  able  to  effectively  tap  domestic  and  remain  competitive  in  international  markets.  In  this \ncontext,  rapid  improvement  of  quality  and  safety  of  agricultural  products  (particularly  for \nvegetables, fruits, and tea) is required to address the needs of client farmers and enterprises in \norder  to  benefit  from  (i)  improved  product  quality,  (ii)  better  skills  to  deal  with  complex  supply \nchains  and  sophisticated  markets,  (iii)  efficient  processing  and  postharvest  operations  and \ninnovative marketing skills, and (iv) improved collaboration between private and public sectors. \nThe Government decreed 2008 as the year of quality and safety for agricultural products, and \nthe  National  Agro-forestry  and  Fisheries  Quality  Assurance  Department \nestablished \n(NAFIQAD),20 with wide responsibility for formulating and implementing regulations. In addition, \na  food  safety  and  agricultural  health  action  plan  has  been  developed,  and  the  provincial \ndepartments  of  agriculture  and  rural  development  (DARDs)  are  strongly  committed  to \nstrengthening their capacity to implement the quality and safety improvement projects. \n \n14. \nThe  attainment  of  targets  set  under  the  Government\u2019s  new  policies  and  strategies \nrelating  to  food  safety  and  good  agricultural  practices\u2014Vietnam  good  agricultural  practices \n(VIETGAP)  is  a  new  concept  being  promoted  by  Government  agencies  among  producers, \nprocessors, and traders\u2014will be constrained by several issues: (i) farmers, government officials, \nconsumers, and the general public have limited understanding of and training in food safety; (ii) \nthere is a shortage of research scientists working on food safety, resulting in limited information \nto  extension  staff  on  VIETGAP  and  Global  Good  Agricultural  Practices \navailable \n(GLOBALGAP);21  (iii)  linkages  between  research,  Department  of  Plant  Protection  (DPP), \nextension services, and farmers are weak; (iv) the operating budget provided to extension and \nplant  protection  staff  for  the  conduct  of  monitoring,  supervision,  and  field  demonstrations \nrelating  to  vegetables,  fruits,  and  tea  is  insufficient;  (v)  production  units  are  small  and \nfragmented,  and  farmers  operate  individually,  with  little  incentive  to  adopt  VIETGAP;  (vi)  a \n\n                                                 \n20  MARD Decision no. 29/2008/QD-BTS, 28 Feb. 2008. \n21  Standards  for  good  agricultural  practices  (GAPs),  drafted  for  vegetables,  tea  and  fruits  in  early  2008,  provide  a \nbasic safe production compliance code for farmers and therefore meet exporter/processor basic requirements for \nHACCP or other international safety and quality standards. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\nregulatory  framework  to  facilitate  domestic  adoption  of  and  compliance  with  international  food \nsafety  standards  does  not  exist,  and  no  agency  has  a  clear  mandate  for  public  sector  crop \ninspection  and  certification;  (vii)  existing  laboratories  have  limited  capacity  to  undertake  plant \ntissue  testing,  due  to  a  shortage  of  qualified  staff  and  operating  funds;  and  (viii)  the  laws  and \nregulations  provide  limited  ability  to  enforce  penalties  imposed  on  violators,  and  penalties  are \noften  not  enforced  in  any  case.  These  have  discouraged  consumers  from  paying  premium \nprices for safe, high quality food due to a lack of assurance regarding food quality, and limited \nawareness of safety or the availability of cheaper alternatives. \n \n15. \nThe Government has laid out strategies for sustainable development and environmental \nprotection,  in  support  of  its  regulatory  efforts  and  reform  initiatives.  For  example,  the \nSustainable  Development  Strategy  (Viet  Nam  Agenda  21)  for  harmonization  of  economic, \nsocial,  and  environmental  development  is  a  general  activity  framework  designed  to  shift  Viet \nNam  towards  a  sustainable  development  path.  It  considers  environmental  protection  and \nimprovement  as  crucial  elements  in  the  development  process.  The  national  strategy  for \nenvironment  protection  (2010\u20132020)  aims  to  halt  the  spread  of  pollution,  restore  degraded \nareas,  improve  overall  environmental  quality,  and  ensure  achievement  of  sustainable  national \ndevelopment.  It  also  recognizes  and  guarantees  that  all  citizens  are  entitled  to  live  in  an \nenvironment where air, land, and water quality meet state standards. The national energy policy \nfocuses on the development of renewable energy that may substitute for firewood, in line with \nthe  Government\u2019s  forest  protection  policy  and  strategy.  This  policy  is  complemented  by  the \nrenewable  energy  action  plan  of  the  Ministry  of  Industry  which  has  a  focus  that  includes  the \ndevelopment  of  renewable  energy  sources,  with  priority  given  to  biogas  development  as  an \nefficient  energy  source  for  rural  and  mountainous  areas.  The  Project  is  consistent  with  the \nideals of these strategies and policies. It is also in line with the Government\u2019s Socio-Economic \nDevelopment Plan (SEDP) 2006\u20132010, which is intended to guide Viet Nam to middle-income \nnation status by late 2010. \n \nA  number  of  regulations  specify  the  functions  and  responsibilities  of  various  MARD \n16. \ndepartments related to policy formulation, management, monitoring, inspection, communication, \naccreditation,  and  development  of  standards  related  to  food  safety.  However,  the  existing \nregulations provide insufficient clarity on three key institutional issues, namely (i) who will take \nthe  lead  in  coordinating  the  efforts  of  various  departments,  (ii)  who  will  take  the  lead  in \nmonitoring, and (iii) how the food safety management system will be managed. \n\n17. \nInternal  and  External  Coordination.  Internally,  various  MARD  departments  are \nmandated with monitoring (e.g., the Department of Crop Production [DCP] and NAFIQAD) and \nall  departments  are  mandated  with  communication  and  policy  formulation.  It  is  unclear, \nhowever,  which  department  will  take  the  lead  in  coordination  and  how  various  efforts  will  be \nharmonized.  Externally,  MARD  needs  to  coordinate  its  activities  on  food  safety  with  other  key \nministries,  most  notably  the  Ministry  of  Health,  the  Ministry  of  Science  and  Technology,  the \nMinistry  of  Industry  and  Trade,  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment,  and  various  key \norganizations such as the Viet Nam Food Administration and the Directorate for Standards and \nQuality. For example, the development of national food standards is managed by Directorate for \nStandards  and  Quality,  but  requires  considerable  input  from  MARD.  MARD  currently  lacks  a \nbody to coordinate with external agencies. \n\n18.  Monitoring.  Existing  regulations  indicate  monitoring  is  the  responsibility  of  all  MARD \ndepartments. NAFIQAD is mandated with supervising specialized monitoring activities by other \ndepartments, but no actual monitoring system\u2014with specific resources, budgets, and tools\u2014is \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3    35 \n\nin place that is capable of producing regular reports on various aspects of food safety to allow \nprogress assessments and measure achievement of food safety policy objectives.  \n\n19.  Management.  Development  of  an  effective  food  safety  management  system  requires \nestablishment of operational structures. Currently, no food safety units exist, either at the central \n(MARD) or provincial (DARD) levels. Staff engaged in food safety are usually involved in other \nactivities  and  not  fully  specialized  in  food  safety.  At  MARD,  for  example,  standards  and \npractices for safe production of fruits, vegetables, and tea have been established and a body of \nrelated  regulations  has  been  developed.  However,  there  are  only  three  part-time  staff  at  DCP \ninvolved in these activities, while the department itself is charged with numerous functions and \nresponsibilities including policy formulation, accreditation of certification bodies, monitoring and \ninspection, communication, promotion of safe agricultural zones, and training.  \n\nRegulatory Issues \n\nD. \n \n20. \nIn  view  of  these  problems  and  issues,  the  need  to  strengthen  the  country\u2019s  regulatory \nframework and institutional capacity to enforce regulations for food quality and safety has been \ngiven  the  highest  priority  by  the  Government.  Its  accession  to  the  WTO  in  November  2006 \naccelerated implementation of the Government\u2019s action programs for streamlining over 200 food \nsafety  regulations,  which  need  to  be  reviewed,  consolidated,  and  harmonized  to  avoid \nconfusion.  Considerable  work  still  needs  to  be  done  to  establish  a  comprehensive  regulatory \nframework,  most  of  which  is  expected  to  be  carried  out  under  the  action  plan  for  food  safety, \n2008\u20132012.  The  Government  also  aims  to  harmonize  50%  of  all  standards  in  Viet  Nam  to \nconform  to  international  food  quality  and  safety  standards.  In  this  regard,  the  capacity  of \naccreditation  organizations  (such  as  DCP  and  the  DARDs)  will  need  to  be  strengthened,  as \nmost  of  the  staff  involved  in  accreditation  lack  an  adequate  background  on  food  safety  and \naccreditation  and  certification.  There  is  likewise  limited  coordination  between  MARD  and  the \nMinistry  of  Health  in  quality  and  safety  inspection  activities.  The  monitoring  and  inspection \nprocedures  and  system  need  to  be  streamlined,  and  staff  capacity  to  carry  out  this  task \nstrengthened,  together  with  the  laboratory  system,  which  is  needed  to  provide  support  at  the \nregional and local levels.   \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n3\n6\n \n \n \n \n \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n4\n \n\ni\n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE \n \n\nProject Title\nAgriculture Science and Technology\n\nDuration\n2007\u20132012\n\nSource\nADB\n\nAgricultural Sector Development Program\n\n2002\u20132007\n\nADB\n\nTea and Fruit Development Project\n\n2000\u20132006\n\nADB\n\nLivestock Competitiveness and Food Safety \n    Project\n\nPipeline for\n2008\n\nAgricultural Competitiveness Project\n\nPipeline for\n2009\n\nWB\n\nWB\n\nFood and Agricultural Products Quality Projecta\n\n2005\u20132010\n\nCIDA\n\nObjectives\n\nImprove and modernize the Agriculture \nScience and Technology system and\ninstitutions  as well as the capacity of their\nstaff, reserachers, and other stakeholders.\nSupport policy and institutional reforms to\ndevelop an environment for market-based\nagricultural and agro-industry development.\nIncrease farm income and raise the value of\nagricultural production through tea and fruit \ndevelopment.\nStrengthen capacity of public and private sector\ninstitutions to provide support services and \ninfrastructure to small and medium farms.\nImprove the competitiveness, entrepreneurship,\nand organization of farmers in the central\nregion of Viet Nam.\nFood safety, farm product value, and trade \ndevelopment (SPS export requirements and\nquality standards).\n\nand Rural Development and improvement of\nquality and safety in fisheries products.\n\nAmount\nGrant/Loan ($ million)\n\nLoan\n\n30.0\n\nLoan\n\n90.0\n\nLoan\n\n40.2\n\nLoan\n\n75.0\n\nLoan\n\n55.0\n\nGrant\n\n16.0\n\nAgriculture Sector Programme\n\n2000\u20132007\n\nDANIDA Capacity-building at the Ministry of Agriculture\n\nGrant\n\n46.5\n\nSupport Collaboration for Agriculture and\n    Rural Development\n\nMaking Markets Work Better for the Poor\n\n2003\u20132007\n\nMarket Linkages and Capacity in Agriculture; \n   and Sustainable Peri-Urban Agriculture\n\n2003\u20132007\n\nSector Program Support Capacity Building \n   Program\n\n2006\u20132008\n\nPhytosanitary Capacity Building Project II\n\nMulti-lateral Trade Assistance Policy Program II\n\n2004\u20132008\n\n2004\u20132010\n\nAusAID Increase productivity and competitiveness of\n\nGrant\n\n15.0\n\nagriculture and rural enterprises through support\nfor agricultural research and development.\nEnhance understanding of links between growth\nand poverty and the dynamics of markets and\n\nADB\nDFID\n\nAusAID institutions.\n\nIFAD\n\nPromotion of public-private dialogue to maintain\nCIRAD poor-friendly fruit and vegetable street vending;\nAVRDC safe vegetable production pilots.\nAusAID Building capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture and\n\nRural Development enquire point for sector\nprogram support.\n2005\u20132008 WHO/FAO Improve government capacity for pest risk \n\nNZAID\nEU\n\nanalysis and export certification.\nAssistance to the Ministry of Trade to strengthen\nintegration into the global trading system.\nSupport for program development and construction \nof household biogas units.\nSupport for program development and construction \nof household biogas units.\n\nGrant\n\n2.9\n\nGrant\n\n3.0\n\nGrant\n\n0.5\n\nGrant\n\nGrant\n\nGrant\n\nGrant\n\n0.5\n\n0.8\n\n2.5\n\n4.8\n\nSupport for Biogas Program Phase I\n\n2003\u20132006\n\nDGIS\n\nSupport for Biogas Program Phase II\n\n2007\u20132010\n\nDGIS\n\nADB   =   Asian  Development   Bank,  WB  =  World  Bank,  CIDA  =  Canadian   International   Development  Agency,  DANIDA = Danish  International\nDevelopment   Agency,   AusAID  =   Australian   Agency  for  International  Development,  DFID =  Department  for  International Development, IFAD =\nInternational    Fund     for    Agricultural    Development,    CIRAD  =  Centre   de  Cooperation   Internationale    en   Recherche  Agronomique   pour   le\nDevelopment,   WHO  =   World   Health   Organization,  FAO = Food   and   Agriculture  Organization,  NZAID =  New  Zealand Agency for International\n Development, EU = European Union, DGIS = Netherlands General International Cooperation.\na Project implementation will be carried out in close collaboration with this project to avoid overlaps.\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\n\f \n\n \n\n        \n\n \n\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \n \nTable A5.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category \n \n\nItem\n\n A.

The expected outcome is integration of livestock waste management with clean energy \nproduction and increased agro-product safety and reduced health hazards. The main output of \nthe TA will be the design of the investment program for expansion of biogas development in Viet \nNam  that  responds  to  clients'  needs  and  fulfills  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  requirements \nand safeguard policies.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  TA  will  comprise  two  parts.  Part  1  will  provide  startup  support  for  the  Project, \nincluding oversight and capacity building. The oversight function will provide advisory support to \nthe Government on how to effectively implement and monitor project activities on the quality and \nsafety  of  agricultural  products  and  biogas  development.  Part  2  will  provide  a  design  for  an \ninvestment  to  expand  biogas  development,  involving:  (i)  technical  design  of  different  sizes  of \nbiogas  plants  for  farm  households  and  medium-  to  large-scale  commercial  livestock  farms \nbased on field testing, demonstration, and applied research activities; (ii) determination of credit \nfinancing  options  for  different  socioeconomic  groups;  (iii)  determination  of  a  geographical \nexpansion  plan  and  strategy;  (iv)  design  of  a  practical  institutional  and  management  structure \nfor expansion; and (v) development of clean development mechanism (CDM) projects.  \n \nC. \n \n3. \nIt  is  estimated  that  the  consulting  services  for  advisory  support  and  capacity \ndevelopment  and  project  management  will  cost  $1.8  million,  of  which  the  associated  TA  will \nfinance  $1.5  million,  to  be  funded  by  the  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund,  and  the \nGovernment  will  provide  $300,000  as  part  of  the  TA  to  cover  incremental  administrative \nexpenses,  office  space,  local  travel  and  per  diem  for  counterpart  staff.  Cost  estimates  and \nfinancing plan are provided in Table A9.1. \n \nD. \n \n4. \nThe  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  will  be  the  TA  executing  agency \n(EA). The TA will be implemented over a period of 18 months from January 2009 to June 2010. \nThe TA will require 103 person-months of consultant services, comprising 46 person-months of \ninternational  consultant  and  57  person-months  of  national  consultant  services.  All  consultants \nwill  be  recruited  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Individual consultants will be recruited for part 1: start-up \n(6 person-months of international and 20 person-months of national consultant services), while \na firm will be recruited, using the quality- and cost-based selection procedure, for part 2: design \n(40  person-months  of  international  and  37  person-months  of  national  consultant  services).

The \nagriculture sector development advisor will provide advisory support to the government and the \nTA  team  on:  (i)  developing  a  monitoring  system  for  agricultural  product  safety  and  quality,  (ii) \nestablishing an institutional and organizational structure for effective implementation of the loan \nproject,  and  (iii)  help  develop  a  strategy  to  promote  biogas  in  livestock  farms  to  increase  the \nquality and safety of agricultural products. \n\n\fAppendix 10      53 \n\n  \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSES \n\nIntroduction \n\n \nA. \n \nThe Project has four components: (i) development of the country\u2019s regulatory framework \n1. \nand  strengthening  of  institutional  capacity  relating  to  food  safety;  (ii)  enhancement  of  the \nproduction  and  consumption  of  safe,  quality  agro-products  and  establishment  of  supporting \ninfrastructure  and  facilities;  (iii)  development  of  biogas  plants  among  small  livestock  farms  to \nreduce  livestock  waste hazards  in agricultural areas  and  improve  public  health,  environmental \nquality  and  livelihoods  through  waste  digestion  and  production  of  biogas  energy;  and  (iv) \ncapacity  building  of  the  central  project  management  unit  and  provincial  project  management \nunits in project management and replication of project impacts.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  project  area  covers  16  provinces  that  are  considered  major  centers  of  vegetable, \nfruit, and tea production in Viet Nam, including Ha Noi in the north, Da Nang in the center, and \nHo Chi Minh City in the south. It covers about 3.9 million hectares (ha) of agricultural land with \nabout 3.6 million rural households (or an equivalent of 18 million people) in these provinces. A \nlarge  number  of  small  farm  households  in  these  areas  raise  livestock  for  a  living  and  are  in \nurgent  need  of  appropriate  livestock  waste  management  and  disposal  facilities.  The  poorly \nmanaged  disposal  of  livestock  waste  has  created  serious  environmental  problems  that  have \nadversely impacted community health. \n \n3. \n \n\nThe Project is expected to yield major benefits, including:  \n\nOverall Project Benefits \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nincremental benefits from increased crop yields and productivity through adoption \nof high yield and tolerant seed varieties, integrated pest management (IPM), and \ngood agricultural practices (GAPs). An estimated 6.5 million farmers will directly \nbenefit  from  the  project  interventions.  The  Project  is  also  expected  to  generate \nemployment  for  about  1.4  million  people  involved  in  the  post-production  food \nchain for tea, fruits and vegetables. As a result, the Project will make significant \ncontributions to rural poverty reduction in and outside the project provinces;1 \nsavings in health costs realized through safe agricultural products (tea, fruits, and \nvegetables)  and  improved  livestock  waste  management.  It  is  expected  that  a \nsignificant  reduction  in  the  occurrence  of  food-  and  waterborne  diseases  will \ndirectly  improve  human  health  in  the  project  area,  resulting  in  increased  labor \nproductivity and reduced treatment and hospital costs;  \ncost  savings  from  substitution  of  biogas-derived  energy  for  firewood,  kerosene, \ncoal,  and  liquefied  petroleum  gas  (LPG)  used  for  cooking  and  lighting.  The \nProject  will  contribute  to  energy  savings  among  rural  households  as  biogas \nproduced by the digesters will serve as an alternative energy source for cooking \nand  lighting.  An  estimated  40,000  households  will  benefit  from  this  alternative \nenergy source.  \nthe availability of bio-slurry, as a safer organic fertilizer than untreated manure.2 \nWhile farmers are currently using manure for their crops, the untreated manure, \n\n                                                 \n1  The  average  poverty  incidence  in  the  project  provinces  was  estimated  to  be  25.9%.  The  project  interventions \ncontribute significantly to reduction of the national poverty incidence (expected to reach about 15.0% by 2010). \n2  In traditional practice, domestic and livestock waste is collected and piled up. Pond mud is used to cover the pile for \n\na month or so before it is used for crops as \u201corganic fertilizer\u201d.  \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n\nwhen used as an \u201corganic fertilizer\u201d, is considered unsafe for water, air, and soil. \nAlthough  no  empirical  evidence  is  available  on  the  incremental  impact  on  crop \nyields  in  Viet  Nam  of  bio-slurry  versus  manure  that  is  otherwise  treated, \nelsewhere  bio-slurry  has  been  claimed  to  be  a  better  fertilizer  than  untreated \nmanure;3 and  \nreduced water, air, and soil pollution as a result of biogas digester installation and \noperations, because  domestic  and  livestock  wastes  will  be better  managed  and \ntreated.  It  is  estimated  that  the  proposed  biogas  development  operation  will \nreduce CO2 emissions by an equivalent of about 40,000\u201360,000 tons of CO2 per \nannum.  \n\n(v) \n\n \nC. \n \n\nEconomic Analyses \n\n1.  \n\nMethodology and Assumptions \n\n \n4. \nThe proposed Project will adopt the sector financing modality, where the entire scope of \nproject  activities  is  not  known  at  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  stage. \nTherefore,  the  economic  analysis  is  conducted  to  evaluate  the  viability  of  the  three  sample \nsubprojects  selected  for  feasibility  studies  rather  than  for  the  whole  Project.  These  sample \nsubprojects include: (i) high-yield tea subproject in Lien Son district town of Yen Bai province; \n(ii) lychee fruits subproject in Hong Giang commune, in Luc Ngan district of Bac Giang province; \nand  (iii)  vegetable  (tomatoes)  subproject  in  Van  Hoi  commune,  in  Tam  Duong  district  of  Vinh \nPhuc  province.  The  economic  analysis  of  these  sample  subprojects  serves  both  as  a \nrepresentative  evaluation  of  the  economic  viability  of  the  whole  project,  and  more  importantly, \nas a set of benchmarking criteria for the selection of subprojects eligible for Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  financing, as  far  as  economic  aspects  are  concerned.  It should  be  noted  that  the \nanalysis placed greater emphasis on the latter objective, because only by selecting appropriate \nsubprojects  will  the  Project  as  a  whole  be  economically  viable.  Development  of  biogas \noperations was incorporated into the overall Project to enhance improvements in the quality and \nsafety of agricultural products. In spite of the Project\u2019s integrated nature, the financing of costs \nand  benefit  realization  of  the  biogas  operation  is  fairly  independent  of  the  other  project \ncomponents.  The  analysis  of  the  economic  viability  of  the  biogas  development  is  therefore \nconducted separately.    \n \n5. \nThe economic analyses were consistent with relevant ADB guidelines, handbooks, and \ntechnical  notes.4  The  Project  has  an  implementation  period  of  6  years  (2009\u20132015)  and  the \neconomic  life  of  the  project  interventions  has  been  assumed  to  be  20  years.  For  the  present \nanalysis,  the  prevailing  interbank  exchange  rate  of  D16,000  =  $1  has  been  used.5  A  discount \nrate of 12% has been used to estimate the net present value (NPV), and serves as a cutoff point \nfor the economic internal rate of return (EIRR).  \n \n6. \nThe  economic  analysis  determined  incremental  benefits  attributable  to  the  project \ninterventions.  While  a  number  of  benefit  streams  are  observed,  the  analysis  includes  only \nreadily quantifiable benefits attributable to the project interventions.

Financial  farm-gate  prices  are  based  on  findings \nand  information  collected  during  field  trips  by  the  PPTA  consultant  team  and  ADB  fact-finding \nmissions  during  August\u2013September  2008  as  well  as  information  made  available  by  national \nproduction  associations  (such  as  tea,  fruit,  and  vegetable  associations).  The  analyses  use  a \nworld  price  numeraire  where  economic  prices  for  traded  crop  inputs  and  outputs  have  been \nbased on the World Bank commodity price projections. Labor costs have been shadow-priced at \n0.85 of the wage rates, while other inputs have been adjusted by the standard conversion factor \nof  0.90  as  applicable  to  Viet  Nam.  The  economic  viability  of  the  Project  is  evaluated  against \nstandard  benchmarks,  i.e.,  EIRR  >12%,  benefit-cost  ratio  (BCR)  >1.0,  and  economic  net \npresent value (ENPV) > 0. \n \n7. \nThe  economic  analyses  of  the  three  production  subprojects  are  presented  together, \nfollowed  by  the  biogas  development  operation.  Detailed  assumptions,  financial  and  economic \nfarm  budgets,  economic  price  derivations,  project  capital  and  operating  costs  profiles,  and \nbenefit\u2013cost  and  sensitivity  analyses  are  presented  in  Supplementary  Appendix  K  and  four \nExcel-based models. \n \n\n2.  \n\nTea, Lychee Fruits, and Vegetable Subprojects \n\n \n\na.  \n\nSubprojects Description \n\n \n8. \nThe three sample production subprojects include a: (i) high-yield tea subproject in Lien \nSon District Town of Yen Bai Province; (ii) lychee fruits subproject in Hong Giang commune, in \nLuc  Ngan  District  of  Bac  Giang  Province;  and  (iii)  a  vegetable  (tomato)  subproject  in  Van  Hoi \nCommune,  in  Tam  Duong  District  of  Vinh  Phuc  Province.  These  subprojects  were  selected \nbecause  they  are  representative  of  the  Project\u2019s  proposed  interventions  in  tea,  fruit,  and \nvegetable production in 16 provinces, and can be replicated in the other provinces. The Project \naims to help improve crop yields, productivity, and the market value of existing production types \nby (i) enhancing required infrastructure such as irrigation and clean water supplies; (ii) replacing \nseed  varieties  susceptible  to  pests  and  diseases  with  more  tolerant  seed  varieties;  and  (iii) \nadopting IPM and GAPs, technical extension support, and other supports.

While  a  number  of  benefit  streams  are  expected  from  the \nsubproject  interventions,  the  economic  analyses  include  only  those  that  can  be  readily \nquantified.  In  case  of  the  three  subprojects,  the  benefit  streams  include  only  incremental \nbenefits from increased crop yields and productivity through adoption of high yield and tolerant \nseed  varieties,  IPM,  and  GAPs.  For  the  high-yield  tea  subproject,  incremental  benefits  are \nderived from two outputs: (i) green leaves and buds for export processing, and (ii) green leaves \nfor grade 2 product processing for domestic consumption. The lychee subproject\u2019s incremental \nbenefits are estimated from lychee fruits grown for export to Asian and European markets (30%) \nand  lychee  fruits  for  domestic  market  consumption  (70%).  For  the  vegetable  (tomato) \nsubproject,  grade  1  and  2  tomatoes  for  supermarkets  and  grade  3  and  others  for  city-center \npublic  markets  are  also  estimated  separately  for  benefit  calculation  purposes.  Detailed \nestimations  of  costs  and  benefits  of  the  three  subprojects  are  presented  in  Supplementary \nAppendix K. \n \n11. \nUnquantified Benefits. In addition to the quantifiable benefits mentioned earlier, there \nare  a  number  of  benefits  that  cannot  be  readily  quantified.  First,  although  progress  has  been \nmade  in  recent  years,  poverty  remains  a  critical  problem  in  the  project  provinces.  The  Project \nwill  contribute  significantly  to  easing  the  poverty  of  labor  wage  earners  by  increasing  the \nemployment availability and wages in local areas. This will reduce the social and financial costs \notherwise  incurred  by  family  members  who  are  forced  to  migrate  to  other  provinces  to  earn  a \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10    57 \n\n        \n\nliving. While the benefits from poverty reduction can be quantified, these may be overestimated \nbecause they may also accrue to factors other than the project interventions.  \n \n12. \nSecond, although not readily quantifiable, health benefits are expected to be significant, \nbecause the project interventions will contribute to reduced cases of food poisoning caused by \nvegetables,  tea,  and  fruits.6  These  benefits  can  be  divided  into  two  categories,  resource  cost \nsavings (i.e., a reduction in out-of-pocket expenses for health care), and productivity gains (i.e., \na  reduction  in  time  lost  to  illness  that  would  have  otherwise  have  been  utilized  in  income \ngenerating  activities).  Improvement  of  community  health  in  the  project  area  will  significantly \nreduce the number of labor days lost due to illness (directly or through caretaking of relatives). \n \n13. \nThird,  the  Project  will  help  build  capacity  for  local  stakeholders,  including  provincial \nmanagement  agencies  responsible  for  quality  and  safety,  district  people\u2019s  committees, \ncommune people\u2019s committees, and other public utility entities. Benefits will mainly come from \nproject  technical  assistance  in  planning,  management,  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of \nsafe  agricultural  zones,  and  certification  of  marketable  products  as  well  as  entities  along  the \nfarm-to-market system. Improved planning and zoning will be essential to efficiency increases. If \ninvestment is not planned in an appropriate manner before implementation, waste may be very \nhigh. Improvement in management of O&M activities will also save annual O&M costs, whether \nthey are borne by the Government or by farmers. \n \n14. \nFourth, in addition to pecuniary benefits, adopting IPM and GAPs will create a practical \nforum for farmers to exchange experiences, skills and techniques and assist them in adopting \nnew, more efficient farming techniques. Such a forum will further promote production efficiency \nand productivity. Women, as a major source of on-farm labor, will be exposed to new farming \npractices and their roles and positions in society will be strengthened through the acquisition of \nknowledge and skills. In addition, the Project will contribute to increased awareness and change \nthe  mindsets  of  farmers  regarding  the  adoption  of  cleaner  production  practices,  waste \nmanagement, and environmental protection. \n  \n\nSummary Economic Indicators \n\nc.  \n \n\nThe  EIRRs  were  calculated  for  the  three  sample  subprojects  to  determine  their \n15. \neconomic  viability  and  serve  as  benchmarks \nfor  subproject  selection  during  project \nimplementation.  The  results  of  the  economic  analysis  for  the  three  sample  subprojects  are \nsummarized  in  Table  A10.3.  Base-case  EIRRs  range  between  24.8%  and  28.9%,  while \neconomic net present values (ENPVs) are in the range of $163,000 and $206,000, and benefit\u2013\ncost ratios (BCRs) are estimated to be 1.1\u20131.8. These indicators suggest that the three sample \nsubprojects examined are economically viable, with base-case EIRRs well above the 12% cutoff \nrate.  As  indicated  above  (para.  4),  the  economic  analysis  of  the  three  sample  subprojects  will \nserve as a representative evaluation of the whole Project. Therefore, the Project is considered \neconomically viable, because the EIRRs exceed the economic opportunity cost of capital for the \nquantified  benefits.  In  addition,  there  are  other  social,  environmental,  and  capacity-building \nbenefits  that  have  not  been  quantified  due  to  measurement  difficulties  and/or  lack  of  data. \nTherefore, the analyses can be regarded as a conservative estimate of the overall benefits. \n \n16. \nSensitivity tests were undertaken to test the robustness of the analyses and examine the \nconsequences  of  changes  in  variables,  including  an  increase  in  capital  and  recurrent  costs, \n                                                 \n6  According to Dr. Tran Dang of Viet Nam Food Administration in his presentation to the food safety working group \non  28  March  2008,  poisoning  from  microbiological  contamination  and  excessive  pesticides  in  fruits,  tea,  and \nvegetable products accounts for about 30% of all food poisoning cases. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n\nimplementation  delay,  and  potential  output-related  risks,  including  the  probability  that  (i) \nproducers  may  not  be  fully  convinced  of  the  need  to  comply  with  national  and  international \nquality standards, and (ii) incidences of food safety scares related to Vietnamese agro-products \nin major domestic and export markets may dampen the confidence of consumers.  \n \n\nTable A10.3: Summary Economic Indicators for \nThree Production Subprojects \n \n\nUnit: $\n\nTea  --- Cases\n\n0.

The \nsensitivity  tests  indicate  that  the  subprojects  are  highly  sensitive  to  reduced  benefits  due  to \nlower market demand and delays in project implementation (and hence realization of benefits). \nThe sensitivity analysis results for the three sample subprojects are outlined in Table A10.3. \n \n\n3.  \n\nBiogas Development Operation \n\n \n\na.  \n\nBiogas Development Operation Description \n\n \n18. \nThe  biogas  development  operation  aims  to  reduce  hazards  associated  with  livestock \nwaste  in  agricultural  areas,  thereby  reducing  negative  environmental  impacts  (i.e.,  pollution  of \nwater,  soil,  and  air)  affecting  the  quality  and  safety  of  agricultural  products  as  well  as  public \nhealth  in  the  project  area.  The  proposed  operation  will  support  the  construction  of  biogas \ninfrastructure, a credit facility for household construction of biogas digesters, and strengthening \nof  applied  biogas  research  services.  The  Project  will  finance  the  construction  of  about  40,000 \nhousehold  biogas  digesters  in  16  project  provinces  through  subloans  from  partner  financial \nintermediaries. Households with demand for biogas credit will be screened and selected by the \nfinancial intermediaries on terms and conditions agreed between the Government and ADB. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10    59 \n\n        \n\nb.  \n\nBenefits of Biogas Operation \n\n \n19. \nQuantified Benefits. The biogas operation has numerous benefits including energy cost \nsavings, production of bio-slurry (a safe organic fertilizer), and reduced environmental pollution \nlevels in water, air, and soil. However, only the cost savings from the substitution of biogas for \nfirewood, kerosene, coal, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking and lighting are used to \nestimate the incremental benefits of the biogas operation. The Project will contribute to energy \nsavings  among  rural  households  because  the  biogas  from  the  digesters  will  serve  as  an \nalternative energy source for cooking and lighting. Detailed estimates of the costs and benefits \n(financial and economic) of the biogas operation are presented in Supplementary Appendix K. \n \n20. \nUnquantified Benefits. There are benefits that are not readily quantifiable. First, though \nno  empirical,  on-field  evidence  has  been  collected  regarding  the  incremental  impact  on  crop \nyields in Viet Nam of bio-slurry versus untreated manure, bio-slurry is considered to be a safer \norganic fertilizer than untreated manure. While farmers currently use manure for their crops, it is \nconsidered unsafe for water, air, and soil. Second, levels of water, air, and soil pollution will be \nreduced  through  the  installation  and  operation  of  biogas  digesters.  The  proposed  biogas \ndevelopment operation will reduce CO2 emissions by an equivalent of about 40,000\u201360,000 tons \nof CO2 per annum.  \n \n\nc.  \n\nSummary Economic Indicators \n\n \n21. \nThe EIRR was estimated for the biogas development operation together with a schedule \nof  sensitivity  analyses,  as  summarized  in  Table  A10.4.  The  base-case  EIRR  is  estimated  at \n26.5% while the ENPV is D273 billion (equivalent to $17 million), and the BCR is estimated at \n1.6. These indicators suggest that, other things being equal, the biogas development operation \nis  economically  viable,  since  EIRRs  in  base  cases  are  well  above  the  cut-off  rate  of  12%. \nTherefore, the biogas development operation is considered economically viable since the EIRRs \nexceed  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  for  the  benefits  that  have  been  quantified. \nSensitivity  tests  were  undertaken  to  test  the  robustness  of  the  analyses  and  examine  the \nconsequences of changes in various variables, including increased capital and recurrent costs, \nand a delay in biogas digester construction. The tests indicate that the biogas operation is highly \nsensitive  to  delays  in  household  construction  of  biogas  digesters  and  hence  realization  of \nbenefits. The results of the sensitivity analysis for the biogas operation are summarized in Table \nA10.4. \n \n\nTable A10.4: Summary Economic Indicators for Biogas Development Operation \n \n\nBiogas Development --- Cases\n\nEIRR SI (ENPV)\n\nSV(ENPV)\n\n0.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nThe agriculture sector continues to play an important economic role in achieving sustainable and equitable growth and in the \nalleviation  of  rural  poverty.  In  Viet  Nam,  the  agriculture  sector  accounts  for  about  21%  of  the  country\u2019s  gross  domestic \nproduct, and employs about 57% of the labor force, although these shares are expected to decrease due to relatively more \nrapid growth in the industry and service sectors. Viet Nam\u2019s Socio-Economic Development Plan 2006\u20132010 presents 15 tasks \nto  sustain  the  rapid  pace  of  economic  development  and  large  reductions  in  poverty.  One  task  is  to  modernize  agriculture, \nincluding improving product quality to attain more comprehensive rural development, through the review and development of \nstandards  for  product  quality  to  protect  consumers,  guarantee  the  prestige  of  Vietnamese  farm  products,  and  focus \ninvestment  in  irrigation,  transport,  clean  water  and  adoption  of  improved  varieties.  Other  tasks  include  enhancing  the \ndevelopment  of  disadvantaged  regions  and  areas  with  ethnic  minorities,  implementing  disease  prevention  programs, \npromoting  special  policies  in  support  of  production,  harmonizing  development  with  environmental  protection,  and  creating \nconditions favorable to women in from economic perspective.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \nKey Issues  \nThe  project  will  be  implemented  in  16  provinces.  It  covers  a  complete  supply-and-demand  chain:  the  provinces  are  mainly \nagricultural producers,  while the three cities (Ha Noi, Ho Chi Minh and Da Nang) are the country\u2019s biggest consumers. The \naverage poverty rate in the 14 provinces was 17.5% in 2006, above the national rate of 16.0%. The poverty rate in Son La \nwas highest (39%). It is among the six project provinces with ethnic minority groups. \n  \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  a  \u201cgeneral  intervention\u201d  as  it  is  intended  to  contribute  to  the  county\u2019s  sustainable,  pro-poor \nagricultural  growth  by  increasing  the  competitiveness  of  agriculture  and  agro-based  products.  However,  the  overall  poverty \nreduction impact of the Project is considered positive, given the large proportion of the poor engaged in the agriculture sector. \nIncomes associated with crop growing are projected to increase as a result of higher product value, improved crop varieties, \nbetter  infrastructure  support,  reduced  need  for  chemical  fertilizers  and  increased  post-harvest  employment  opportunities. \nThose  agriculturalists  engaged  in  livestock  raising  will  have  reduced  cooking  fuel  expenses  and  save  time  spent  collecting \nfirewood  and  disposing  of  animal  waste.  As  consumers,  beneficiaries  will  benefit  from  safer  food  and  lower  disease  risks, \nwhich translate to reduced medical care and lost productive time.   \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nKey Issues.  \n1.  Lack of capital. Lack of capital for investment is often cited as an obstacle that has contributed to the difficulty faced by \nfarmers  in  buying  high  quality  agro-inputs,  including  seeds,  fertilizers  and  pesticides,  which  are  essential  for  safe \nagricultural production. In addition, safe production requires additional investments in infrastructure, such as provision of \na  clean  water  source  and  greenhouses.  The  Project,  through  its  interventions  to  provide  supporting  infrastructure  in \nSAZs, will ensure that such food quality and safety-related facilities are installed in the selected provinces. \n\n2.  Low  quality  pesticides.  Farmers  in  Ha  Tay  reported  that  they  fall  victim  during  each  crop  season  to  low  quality  or \ncounterfeit  pesticides.  After  spraying  pesticides  with  little  or  no  effect,  farmers  frequently  buy  other  types  of  pesticides \nand spray again. Such a process not only result in high levels of residual chemicals on foliage and/or fruits, it reduces the \ntime  period  between  the  final  application  and  harvesting.  To  enable  farmers  to  comply  with  Viet  Nam  good  agricultural \npractices, criteria for guaranteeing good-quality pesticides and other agro-inputs will be established. \n\n3.  Lack  of  knowledge  of  and  incentives  to  follow  safe  production  processes  and  marketing.  Many  farmers  are \nfamiliar with IPM techniques, but lack understanding of the entire safe production process. Many believe that the use of \npesticides  is  the  sole  source  of  food  contamination.  Lack  of  knowledge  and  experience  regarding  safe  marketing  is \nanother constraint that needs to be addressed. Moreover, there is a common perception that safe production will require \nadditional investments and/or expenses, such as additional investment in infrastructure, labor, and time required for each \ncrop season. Therefore, farmers believe that the extra cost involved in producing safe food cannot be recovered, as they \nhave  to  sell  products  at  prices  not  significantly  different  from  those  of  unsafe  products.  There  is  also  a  belief  that  safe \nagricultural products (especially vegetables) usually appear less attractive than do unsafe products. The project training \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11    61 \n\n        \n\nprogram will take into account and address their perceptions. \n\n4.  Need  to  coordinate  among  farmers.  Farm  households  are  presently  estimated  to  have  0.3\u20130.5  hectares  of  land, \ncomposed of an average of seven different plots of land scattered in different places. This situation has resulted in poor \nwork  rate  efficiency  and  made  it  impossible  to  improve  economies  of  scale.  The  Project  will  promote  consolidation  of \nsmall  agricultural  plots,  which  will  require  organization  and  coordination  to  strengthen  cooperation  among  farmers  with \nsmall fragmented landholdings. The Government has a scheme to waive transfer fees for farm property aggregation, and \nthe Project will ensure such an incentive scheme will be implemented in the project area. Support will also be provided for \nintra-community consultation and negotiation between farmers to ensure optimal social outcomes.  \n\n5.  Greater number of women involved in agricultural activities. Numerous studies in Viet Nam indicate that agricultural \nwork is undertaken primarily by  women. The Project  will help female farmers avoid production hazards associated  with \nexcessive  use  of  pesticides  and  chemicals,  and  provide  them  with  technical  assistance  to  improve  productivity  and \nsubsequently farm incomes. Project activities will also target women farm workers through extension, training and other \ntypes of technical support. \n\n6.  Ethnic minorities in the Project area: Ethnic minorities are present in all provinces and centrally run cities covered by \nthe Project. They constitute an average of 16% of rural households in those provinces. Provinces  with relatively higher \nproportions of ethnic minority groups are: Lam Dong (28%), Son La (88%), Thai Nguyen (29%), and Yen Bai (58%). In \nthe six consultation meetings conducted among various minority groups, there  was a unanimous expression of support \nfor the Project. It was pointed out that the Project will resolve such issues as the high dependence on chemical fertilizers, \ninability to demand higher prices for agricultural products, and the inconvenience of using fuel wood for cooking.  A large \nnumber  of  households  tend  to  be  involved  mainly  in  subsistence  production,  with  limited  market  interaction.  Their \nunfamiliarity  with  the  market  and  limited  need  for  it  may  reduce  the  attraction  of  higher  production  and  income  as \nincentives to adopt new methods and technology. Project-related training will take this into account.     \n\n  \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during project preparation. \nEleven consultation meetings were held, attended by a total of 81 people, or an average of 7 or 8 people per meeting. About \n41% of the participants were women. Five of these meetings were conducted among ethnic minorities. One meeting was \nconducted among women.   \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n   Consultation      Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n\n  Yes    \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \n \nA  C&P  plan  will  be  prepared  with  technical  assistance  at  the  beginning  of  project  implementation.  The  social  development \nspecialist  (3  person-months)  will  lead  consultation  and  participatory  activities  in  the  planning  of  subprojects,  among  other \ntasks. The C&P plan will ensure that:      \n1.  beneficiaries, including ethnic minorities and women, are represented in decision-making bodies; \n2.  information dissemination activities will be conducted among stakeholders for each subproject, detailing the benefits and \n\n No  \n\nschedule of implementation, and highlighting potential positive and adverse effects and impacts;  \n3.  consultations will be carried out in the design, implementation and monitoring of the subprojects;  \n4.  project personnel and contractors will receive orientation regarding participatory activities, gender awareness and ethnic \n\nminorities; and  \n\n5.  women and ethnic minorities will form part of the groups who will undertake surveys and impact evaluations.  Beneficiaries \nwill be consulted during project monitoring to validate data and express their views and suggestions \nimplementation-\nrelated issues.       \nC.   Gender and Development \n\non \n\n1.  Key Issues.  \nViet Nam has a long tradition of promoting gender equality, and one of the highest economic participation rates of women in \nthe world (83%). Women are intended to be the main beneficiaries of the Project. About half of all workers in the agriculture \nsector  are  women;  compared  with  men,  women  contribute  more  hours  of  labor  to  cultivation,  agricultural  processing  and \nmarketing of agricultural produce. Women will be targeted and included in the introduction of new technologies and in training.  \nTasks that fall largely within the domain of women include tending pigs, cleaning toilets, gathering firewood and cooking. Their \nparticipation  in  household  decisions  on  adoption  of  biogas  digesters  is  vital,  as  they  are  most  affected.  There  are  limited \nagricultural  land  use  rights  certificates  issued  to  women,  although  the  number  of  certificates  issued  to  both  spouses  is \nincreasing. Women who lack these certificates face difficulties in accessing credit from formal sources, which may be needed \nif farm and livestock operations have to be expanded to maximize benefits from project inputs.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\n2.

Women account for nearly 50% of \nthe  total  agricultural  workforce  and  for  a  large  share  of  the  total  annual  new  jobs  created  in \nagriculture. Findings from the project-specific social and gender analyses carried out during the \nProject\u2019s preparatory stage indicate that women in the project area share a number of tasks with \nmen  in  farming,  livestock  raising  and  waste  management.  However,  selling  of  agricultural \nproduce  is  done  exclusively  by  women  and  routine  maintenance  and  harvesting  are  done \nprimarily by women. Physically demanding tasks such as plowing fields and hazardous tasks\u2014\nsuch as pesticide application\u2014are done by men. \n \nfewer \n2. \nopportunities to access technology, credit and training. Only 25% of the participants in livestock \nextension training courses and 10% of the participants in cultivation extension training courses \nare women. Women have fewer rights in family decision making and are paid less than men for \nthe  same  work.  The  2002  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy  (CPRGA) \nrecognizes connections between gender inequality and poverty, and highlighted gender equality \nand advancement of women among its sub-strategies for poverty reduction.  \n \nFollowing  the  National  Strategy  for  Advancement  of  Women  in  Viet  Nam  to  the  year \n3. \n2010, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD), the executing agency of the \nProject, developed the Gender Strategy in Agriculture and Rural Development to the Year 2010 \nin  2003.  The  objectives  include,  that  by  2010,  women  account  for  50%  of  all  participants  of \ntechnical  training,  50%  of  working  people  in  rural  areas  will  receive  gender  awareness \ninformation, and the representation of women is increased to 30% in management boards and \nagriculture and rural development projects.  \n \nThis gender action plan has been prepared to ensure gender equality in the distribution \n4. \nof  project  benefits  and  to  enable  active  engagement  by  women  in  subproject  and/or \nsubcomponent design and implementation. Gender responsive interventions will be selected to \nrespond to the specific needs of women in the project area. The implementation arrangements \nand  estimated  costs  of  the  gender  action  plan  have  been  incorporated  into  the  overall  project \ndesign  and  costing.  The  gender  action  plan  implementation  schedule  will  be  in  line  with  the \noverall implementation of the project.  The key principles underlining the gender action plan are:   \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nactive  involvement  of  women,  particularly  poor  women,  female  heads  of

community facilitators;  \npromotion of the hiring of women and equal pay for men and women for work of \nequal value;  \nestablishment  of  sex-disaggregated \nindicators  and  collection  of  sex-\ndisaggregated  data  for  the  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation \nsystem; \nawareness  training  for  men  on  women\u2019s  rights  and  the  importance  of  gender \nequality; and \nencouragement of women\u2019s participation in training activities.                    \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n  \n\n               \n\nActivity \n\n6\n4\n \n\ni\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n2\n
