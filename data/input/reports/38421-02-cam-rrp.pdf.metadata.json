The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1.  \n \nPED-SP2  will  support  the  government\u2019s  key  reform  priorities  aimed  at  diversifying  the \n2. \nsources  of  economic  growth,  supported  by  increased  contribution  of  the  private  sector.  The \nreform  priorities  include  efforts  to  enhance  governance  in  the  business  climate  by  promoting \ncompetition  policy  and  regulatory  efficiency.  PED-SP2  also  aims  to  increase  private  sector \ncompetitiveness \nfacilitation  measures.  The \nDevelopment Policy Letter is in Appendix 3 and the Policy Matrix is in Appendix 4. \n \n\ninnovation  and  enhanced \n\nthrough \n\ntrade \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nReforms to the business climate implemented under the National Strategic Development \nPlan 2006\u20132010 (NSDP) and sector strategies have helped Cambodia move up 15 places in the \nWorld Bank Group\u2019s Doing Business global rankings since 2006.1 Despite this progress, much \nneeds  to  be  done  to  attract  investment  and  generate  better  jobs  for  a  rapidly  expanding  labor \nforce. As Cambodia\u2019s economy advances, new policy and structural challenges for the private \nsector need to be addressed. These include emerging competition policy issues in key sectors, \nthe  high  business  compliance  costs  of  regulations  (estimated  at  3%-5%  of  gross  domestic \nproduct),  low  levels  of  innovative  activity  in  the  private  sector,  and  the  relatively  high  cost  in \ntrade facilitation. Food safety is poor in Cambodia and this is a barrier to private sector growth \nand international trade in processed food products, which has huge growth potential. It is also a \nmajor  risk  to  the  human  population  and  lowers  productivity.  With  over  60,000  enterprises \nengaged in the food sector, reforming sanitary and phytosanitary standards (SPS) management \nsystems is a critical part of the government\u2019s economic diversification strategy.2  \n \n4. \nThe  PED  cluster  approved  by  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  in  December  2008  comprises  three  subprograms  from  2008  to  2012. 3  Under \nsubprogram 1 (PED-SP1), financed by ADB ($19 million) in 2008, the government implemented \na  series  of  investment  and  trade  facilitation  measures  that  laid  the  foundations  for  a  more \ncompetitive and diversified economy in the longer term. It also included the first SPS capacity \ndevelopment  project  (SPS-1  project)  financed  by  ADB  ($2  million).  The  current  phase,  PED-\nSP2, builds on progress made under PED-SP1  for investment climate, trade policy, and trade \nfacilitation.  It  also  responds  to  new  policy  challenges  arising  from  the  impact  of  the  global \nfinancial crisis such as the need for competition policy, regulatory efficiency, and innovation to \npromote  private  sector  competitiveness.  These  reforms  are  designed  to  promote  economic \ndiversification  by  (i)  enhancing  competition  in  domestic  markets  and  lower  cost  regulation, \n(ii) strengthening  investor  confidence  in  the  regulatory  environment  and  promoting  market-\nbased  innovation,  and  (iii)  strengthening  trade  facilitation  measures  along  the  entire  supply \n\n                                                 \n1  Kingdom of Cambodia. 2006.

ADB technical assistance has been targeted to support the government accomplish the \npolicy triggers under PED-SP2.4 The final phase, PED-SP3, is expected to be completed at the \nend of 2012. PED-SP3 includes 10 policy triggers building on progress made under PED-SP2. \n \nPED-SP2  has  several  features  that  draw  on  best  international  practice  for  a \n5. \ncomprehensive trade and investment program. These include (i) supply-side incentives through \nimproving  trade  policy  and  taxation  related  to  international  norms,  (ii)  capacity  development \nassistance  to  address  constraints  of  SPS  service  providers  to  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs), (iii) addressing SMEs\u2019 demand-side issues through a pilot SPS technology \nmatching grants component, (iv) addressing issues of sustainability of reforms by establishing a \npermanent government body to oversee regulatory reforms, and (v) assisting Cambodia\u2019s global \nand  regional  integration  efforts  via  support  for  Cambodia\u2019s  World  Trade  Organization\u2019s  trade \npolicy review (TPR) and its participation in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \nregional trade agreements and ASEAN commitments to develop competition policy and law.  \n \nB. \n \nThe impact of the PED cluster is an expanded and diversified private sector. By the end \n6. \nof  2015,  the  PED  cluster  is  expected  to  have  increased  the  share  of  nontraditional  sectors  in \nGDP and increased the share of non-garment exports in total exports of goods. The outcome of \nthe  PED  cluster  will  be  an  improved  business  environment  where  the  private  sector  operates \nefficiently and effectively. This will be reflected in an increased number of registered enterprises \nand increased growth in private investment.   \n \nC. \n \n7. \nPED-SP2  supports  the  government\u2019s  efforts  in  three  core  reform  areas:  (i) improving \ncompetition  policy  and  regulatory  efficiency,  (ii)  strengthening  the  investment  climate  and \ninnovation, and (iii) enhancing trade policy and facilitation. All 20 policy measures required for \nPED-SP2 were carried out by the end of August 2010.5 \n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nOutput 1: Competition Policy and Regulatory Efficiency \n\n \n8. \nPED-SP2 supports the government\u2019s agenda to improve the regulatory environment for \nbusinesses.  The  objective  is  to  promote  greater  competition  in  domestic  markets  and  lower \nregulatory compliance costs faced by businesses. Critical reform areas include institutionalizing \ngood  practices  in  regulation  and  regulatory  impact  assessments  (RIAs). 6  The  following \nmeasures  toward  achieving  these  objectives  were  completed  before  Board  consideration  of \nPED-SP2. \n \n9. \nInstitutionalizing  good  practice  in  regulation  making.  A  major  reform  is  the \ngovernment\u2019s  program  to  institutionalize  good  regulatory  practices  in  the  national  government. \nTo  this  end  the  government  carried  out  the  following  steps  (i) upgraded  the  Economic,  Social \nand  Cultural  Council  (ECOSOCC)  at  the  Office  of  the  Council  of  Ministers  (OCM)  with  higher \nlevel policy status, increased personnel, and a broader policy mandate, including RIAs;7 and (ii) \n                                                 \n4   ADB.  2008.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  Enhancing  Private  Sector  Competitiveness. \n\nManila \n\n5  Policy Matrix (Appendix 4) and Assessment of Subprogram 2 Policy Triggers (Appendix 2). \n6   An  RIA  is  both  a  process  and  record  of  the  steps  carried  out  by  the  regulator  in  preparing  new  legislation  or \nregulations. The regulator will provide a regulatory impact statement on major proposals. The statement will assess \nthe impact of the proposal on the business community and record stakeholder consultations.   \n\n7  ECOSOCC is one of the councils in the OCM. Its key function is to review all proposed legislation and sub-decrees \nprior  to  submission  to  cabinet  for  consideration.  It  also  provides  economic  advice  to  the  OCM.  See  ADB. \n(forthcoming). Cambodia: Options for Institutionalizing Regulatory Impact Assessments. Manila.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n \n\nthe government (OCM) produced and endorsed a strategy to institutionalize RIAs in the national \ngovernment,  including  preparation  for  and  establishment  of  the  Office  of  Regulatory  Impact \nAssessment (ORIA) at ECOSOCC, which will oversee the RIA reforms. The OCM legal decision \nto  establish  the  ORIA  has  been  issued.  The  ORIA  will  be  a  permanent  government  body, \nmodeled  on  institutional  approaches  used  in  other  countries  such  as  the  Australian  Office  of \nBest  Practice  Regulation  and  the  United  Kingdom\u2019s  Office  of  Better  Regulatory  Practice.  The \nORIA  will  comprise  18 professional  staff  qualified  in  economics,  accounting,  business \nadministration, and public administration. Recent graduates will fill a proportion of the positions. \nWith  ADB  technical  assistance  the  government  undertook  activities  to  build  RIA  practice  and \nraise  awareness  of  its  benefits  in  government:  (i)  the  Ministry  for  Industry,  Mines  and  Energy \n(MIME) implemented the first pilot RIA action plan starting with the Department of Industry; (ii) \nthe Ministry of Environment (MOE) prepared and endorsed its RIA action plan and initiated an \nRIA  reviewing  the  cost  of  business  compliance  with  a  sub-decree;  and  (iii)  the  government  in \ncollaboration  with  ADB  and  other  development  partners  undertook  several  RIA  awareness \nraising  activities  including  workshops,  a  senior  executive  retreat,  an  exposure  visit  to  the \nAustralian  federal  and  state  government  offices  of  best  practice  regulation,  and  a  red  tape \nsurvey of enterprises.8 \n \n10. \nCompetition  law.  The  Ministry  of  Commerce  (MOC)  established  a  working  group  on \ncompetition  policy  responsible  for  raising  awareness  of  its  benefits  and  drafting  a  competition \nlaw under PED-SP3. ADB technical assistance will support the MOC to draft the competition law \nbased on best regional practices, including the establishment of an administratively autonomous \ncompetition  council.  This  is  in  line  with  ASEAN  member  states\u2019  commitments  to  introduce \ncompetition policy and law by 2015.  \n \n\n2. \n\nOutput 2: Investment Climate \n\n \n11. \nPED-SP2  supports  the  government\u2019s  goals  of  improving  the  investment  climate  by \nenhancing the investment incentives, investor protection, and promoting innovation and access \nto  technology.  Measures  accomplished  before  Board  consideration  of  PED-SP2  include  the \nfollowing:  (i) the  government  (General  Department  of  Tax  at  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and \nFinance [MEF]) started to build capacity for preparing for discussions on double tax agreements \nwith major trading partners\u2014including preparing a draft double tax agreement (DTA) model as \nthe  basis  for  future  DTA  negotiations  since  the  government  is  expected  to  begin  discussions \nwith a regional trading partner for a DTA in 2011; (ii) Cambodia strengthened investor protection \nthrough investment chapters of regional agreements, including the agreement establishing the \nASEAN\u2013Australia\u2013New Zealand free trade area (February 2009), ASEAN\u2013People\u2019s Republic of \nChina  free  trade  area  (August  2009),  and  ASEAN\u2013Republic  of  Korea  free  trade  area  (June \n2009);  (iii)  the  government  recognizes  that  Cambodia\u2019s  low  rankings  in  global  surveys  of \ntechnology adoption and innovation are a constraint to enhancing competitiveness\u2014to address \nthis,  the  MIME  established  a  taskforce  on  national  technology  policy  and  produced  a  draft \nstrategic policy framework for technology and innovation for the SMEs sector.   \n \n\n3. \n\nOutput 3: Trade Policy and Facilitation \n\n \nPED-SP2  supports  the  government\u2019s  goals  of  continuing  trade  policy  reforms  to  lower \n12. \nthe cost of doing business for the private sector, and implementing measures to improve trade \nfacilitation  (customs  and  SPS)  for  enhanced  competitiveness.  The  following  measures  were \naccomplished before Board consideration of PED-SP2.  \n \n\n                                                 \n8 Development Coordination (Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f 4 \n\nContinuing  trade  policy  reforms.  The  MOC  produced  a  draft  bill  on  trade  remedies \n13. \nconsistent  with  best  international  practice  and  an  economy-wide  perspective.  It  is  expected  to \nbe submitted to the National Assembly in 2011. With ADB technical assistance, the government \nstarted preparations for its first TPR under the World Trade Organization (WTO) process. The \nTPR  will  provide  a  review  of  Cambodia\u2019s  trade  and  investment  policies,  and  this  will  help  the \ngovernment  prioritize  policy  reforms.  Substantial  progress  has  been  made  and  the  TPR  is \nscheduled  to  be  completed  in  November  2011.  The  Department  of  Notification  and  Legal \nCompliance  (WTO  department)  at  the  MOC  strengthened  its  notification  systems  within  the \ndepartment as the WTO focal point, Camcontrol as the inquiry point for SPS, and the MIME for \ntechnical barriers to trade. The WTO department started submitting notifications to the WTO in \n2009.  This  enhances  transparency  in  the  trade  policy  regime  related  to  technical  barriers  to \ntrade. \n \n14. \nCustoms  reforms.  The  government  has  made  substantial  progress  in  implementing \ncustoms  reforms  since  2008,  critical  to  improving  trade  facilitation  at  the  border.  Under  PED-\nSP2,  two  priority  measures  were  taken  to  improve  customs  facilitation:  (i)  the  General \nDepartment of Customs and Excise implemented and operationalized an automated system for \ncustoms  data  (ASYCUDA)  at  three  major  ports;  as  part  of  the  customs  system  expansion \nproject,  the  General  Department  of  Customs  and  Excise  undertook  a  needs  assessment  for \nnational rollout of ASYCUDA, expected to commence in 2011; and (ii) the General Department \nof  Customs  and  Excise  made  substantial  progress  in  implementing  customs  transaction \nvaluation (CTV) in line with WTO commitments, including establishing the transaction valuation \nresearch  unit  responsible  for  overseeing  CTV  implementation,  and  a  private  sector  forum  to \nmonitor CTV implementation and provide inputs to implementation of CTV.   \n \n15. \nImprovement  of  sanitary  and  phytosanitary  standard  management  systems.  The \ngovernment  undertook  measures  to  strengthen  the  institutional  and  regulatory  framework  for \neffective SPS (food safety) management systems. First, it produced draft interministerial prakas  \n(regulation)  delineating  the  legal  and  enforcement  responsibilities  of  various  ministries  (MOC, \nMIME,  the  Ministry  of  Health,  and  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Forestry  and  Fisheries).  The \nprakas is  expected to be issued in the fourth quarter of 2010 and will lay the foundations for an \neffective  SPS  regulatory  and  enforcement  coordination  mechanism  to  address  agency \nduplication in the SPS field. Second, the MIME developed, endorsed, and started implementing \nan action plan to commercialize the Industrial Laboratory Center of Cambodia (ILCC) by 2013. \nThe  plan  covers  corporate  governance,  strengthening  the  technical  capacity  of  staff,  and \nmeasures  for  International  Organization  for  Standardization  (ISO)  accreditation  for  major  food \nsafety tests.9 Third, satisfactory progress has been made in developing the Institute Standards \nCambodia  Conformity  and  Assessment  Board  for  management  and  process  standards.  It  is \nintended to have the ISC accredited as a Conformity and Assessment Board in early 2011. This \nwill allow it to certify internationally recognized standards. \n \nD. \n \n16. \nTo support its reform initiatives, the government has requested a loan of SDR6,565,000 \n($10  million  equivalent)  and  an  Asian  Development  Fund  grant  of  $9 million  to  help  finance \nPED-SP2.  The  $10  million  loan  equivalent  will  have  24-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of \n8 years,  an  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft financing agreement. The \n                                                 \n9  With assistance from ADB and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, the ILCC will be ISO17025 \naccredited with the National Association of Testing Authorities Australia for six microbiology tests expected in the \nfourth quarter of 2010. This means the ILCC\u2019s certified tests will be internationally accepted. The ILLC will be the \nfirst Cambodian laboratory to be ISO17025 accredited.  \n\nProgram Costs and Financing \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\n \n\ngovernment  will  meet  the  remaining  resource  requirement.  The  proceeds  of  the  program  loan \nwill  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement \nProcedures  and  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans. 10 PED-SP2  will  provide  for  the \nretroactive  financing  for  eligible  expenditures  incurred  up  to  180  days  prior  to  loan  and  grant \neffectiveness.  ADB  will retain  the  right  to  audit the  use  of the  loan  and  grant  proceeds  and  to \nverify the accuracy of the withdrawal application certification. \n \n17. \nThe size of the PED-SP2 loan is based on consideration of a number of factors required \nto  support  implementation  of  program  reforms.  The  key  considerations  include:  (i)  the  relative \nimportance of the sector to the economy, the weight and benefits of the reform program, and the \nleverage necessary to counter resistance from interest groups; (ii) the policy adjustment costs \nincurred by the government and stakeholders in implementing and complying with reforms; and \n(iii)  the  need  to  conform  to  the  overall  financing  requirement  from  the  country  partnership \nstrategy  period. 11 ADB  staff  estimates  that  the  long-run  benefits  of  the  reform  program  are \napproximately  2.9%  of  GDP  or  over  $300.5  million  (in  2009  prices).  These  economic  benefits \ninclude increased output and investment from a reduction in business costs of compliance with \nlicensing, lower trade facilitation costs, and increased productivity due to lower incidence of food \nand water related diseases and premature mortality in the human population. The reforms have \nimportant  distributive  effects.  It  will  increase  employment  and  wages,  with  positively  impacting \nfemale employment, simulated to rise by 4.7% from these reforms. The policy adjustment costs \nto  the  government  and  private  sector  are  conservatively  estimated  as  a  discounted  present \nvalue lump sum of $31.5 million (or $19.5 million without the present value lump sum).12 These \nadjustment costs include the administrative, enforcement and fiscal costs to the government in \nimplementing and enforcing the reforms (estimated at $26.0 million or alternatively $14 million \nwithout present value lump sum estimates)\u2014such as the investment cost to set up the ORIA at \nOCM  including  new  staff  and  operating  costs,  investment  costs  to  set  up  RIA  units  at  line \nministries, the rollout of the ASYCUDA to three customs posts during PED-SP2, the investment \ncosts in implementing the action plan to commercialize the ILCC, restructuring costs at the ISC \nto be accredited as a conformity and assessment body, and costs involved in drafting legislation \nand the TPR process. The policy adjustment costs also include the increased business costs of \ncompliance with the SPS reforms related to mandatory SPS-sensitive standards (conservatively \nestimated at $5.5 million).13 \n \nE. \n \n18. \nThe  MOC  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  PED-SP2.  It  will  be  responsible  for  the \noverall  implementation  of  PED-SP2,  including  carrying  out  all  policy  actions,  program \nadministration, and maintenance of program records. The implementation arrangements under \nPED-SP1  will  continue  under  PED-SP2.  The  MOC  will  use  the  Private  Sector  Development \nSub-Steering  Committee,  chaired  by  the  minister  of  commerce  and  comprising  senior  officials \nfrom  the  MEF  and  MIME.  The  steering  committee  is  responsible  for  coordinating  the \nimplementation and sustaining policy actions, with MOC and relevant line agencies involved in \nsupporting  the  program  (MIME,  MOE,  and  ECOSOCC).  The  steering  committee  will  meet \nquarterly  to  monitor  progress  and  oversee  implementation  of  the  program.  The  MOC  will  be \nresponsible for day-to-day program implementation activities, and will report on implementation \nprogress. The MOC will also establish a program implementation unit (PIU), and assign a PIU \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n                                                 \n10  ADB. 1998.

The  CREST  project  will  be  funded  under  a \ngrant  of  $5.0 million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources.  The  project  duration  will  be  2011\u2013\n2014 (about 3 years). The CREST project will comprise two subprojects. The first subproject will \nbe  the  RIA  subproject,  which  will  focus  on  capacity  development  to  institutionalize  RIA  in \ngovernment, including establishing the ORIA, supporting line ministries to implement RIA action \nplans,  and  developing  a  community  of  practitioners  in  RIA  and  regulatory  reform.  The  project \nadministration  manual  (PAM)  for  the  RIA  subproject  contains  details  of  the  implementation \narrangements, accounting and reporting, and other operational issues.14  \n\n \n\n20. \nThe second subproject is the SPS-2 subproject (the second phase of the SPS-1 project \nunder PED-SP1), which will focus on enhancing the effectiveness of supply side provisioning of \nSPS services to the private sector and the demand side for SPS services and technologies. A \nspecial feature of the SPS-2 subproject is a matching grants component to assist SMEs access \ntechnology and upgrade product and process quality. The PAM for the SPS-2 contains details of \nthe implementation arrangements, accounting and reporting, and other operational issues.15   \n \n21. \nThe project is estimated to cost $5,430,000, of which $5,000,000 will be grant financed \nunder  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources.

This \nassessment  was  based  on  the  sector  work  of  ADB\u2019s  public  financial  management  for  rural \ndevelopment  program  cluster,  as  well  as  the  Integrated  Fiduciary  Assessment  and  Public \nExpenditure Review for 2003 and the Country Procurement Assessment for 2004, both led by \nWorld Bank.17 These assessments identified core areas to address with development partners\u2019 \nsupport. The Integrated Fiduciary Assessment and Public Expenditure Review determined that \nthe fiduciary risk in the use and management of public funds was high. As a consequence, the \ngovernment  developed  and  began  implementing  a  medium-term  public  financial  management \nreform  program  from  2004  to  2015,  supported  by  development  partners.  This  program \n\n                                                 \n17 ADB.  2008.

ADB, the  World Bank, and other development \npartners are working closely with the government to implement improved public sector financial \nmanagement  systems.  A  good  governance  framework  for  the  CREST  project  has  been \ndeveloped and agreed with the executing agencies (footnotes 13 and 14).  \n \n27. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith government. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described \nin the PAMs.  \n \nB. \n \nReforms  under  the  PED-SP2  could  reduce  poverty  by  2.0  percentage  points.18   PED-\n28. \nSP2  will  contribute  to  a  sustainable  reduction  in  poverty  through  three  channels.  The  first \nchannel  is  through  higher,  broad-based  and  sustainable  economic  growth.  By  reducing  the \nbusiness compliance costs with the business licensing system, lowering trade facilitation costs, \nimproving taxation and investor guarantees in line with international norms, private and foreign \ninvestment  will  increase  across  a  broad  range  of  sectors  thereby  supporting  higher  economic \ngrowth. The improvement is SPS management systems will aid government\u2019s efforts to develop \nbackward linkages with the agriculture sector. The second channel is through the labor market \nwith  increased  real  wages  and  hiring  activity  across  most  sectors  from  increased  investment. \nThe lower risk of food and water borne diseases in the human population will raise productivity \nand  improve  household  incomes.  The  third  channel  is  through  lower  prices  of  goods  and \nservices. By improving transparency in trade policy, increased integration within the region and \nthe rest of the world through trade policy and regulatory reforms, and implementing competition \npolicy, domestic prices will fall through greater competition in the economy. PED-SP2 will have \na positive impact on achieving the goal of gender equality through gender mainstreaming in the \nregulatory review process and equitable access of female entrepreneurs to the matching grants \noutput under the SPS-2 subproject.19 \n \nC. \n \nPED-SP2  does  not  trigger  the  safeguard  policies  and  is  categorized  C  for  the \n29. \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. The following are agreed upon, \nand  will  be  incorporated  into  the  legal  agreement.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nprogram. The government agreed to cooperate, and shall cause any and all government offices, \norganizations,  and  entities  involved  in  implementing  the  program  to  cooperate  fully  with  any \nsuch  investigation  and  to  extend  all  necessary  assistance,  including  providing  access  to  all \nrelevant books and records, as may be necessary, for the satisfactory completion of any such \ninvestigation. \n \nD. \n \n30. \nThe  assumptions  underlying  PED-SP2  include  the  following:  (i)  external  economic \nenvironment continues to improve to support domestic macroeconomic stability and growth, and \n(ii) the government will stay on course with key business regulatory reform measures. However, \nthere are three main risks to PED-SP2 (Table 4). \n                                                 \n18 Summary Program Impact Assessment (Appendix 2). \n19 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (Appendix 2). \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nSafeguards \n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nMacroeconomic instability \n\nThe capacity of agencies to \nimplement reforms may be \nconstrained by resources \nand other emerging priorities. \nResistance to some of the \nreforms from vested \ninterests, especially in \ninstitutionalizing RIA in \ngovernment \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe government is undertaking measures to consolidate fiscal policy. It plans an overall \nbudget deficit of 5.3% of GDP in 2010 down from 6.3% in 2009, and a current budget \nsurplus of 1.3% in 2010, up from 0.1% in 2009. The budget deficits will return to longer-\nterm levels by 2013.  \nThe program reduces this risk by focusing on the policy triggers that constitute high-\npriority, high-impact policy reforms supported by substantial capacity development \nassistance in the core areas of the program such as competition policy, regulatory \nreform, and SPS. \nThe program focuses on efforts to support the government\u2019s own initiatives and reforms \nin areas where there is strong political will and commitment. The RIA reforms have \nstrong political commitment at the Office of the Council of Ministers and support from \nkey regulatory agencies (MOC, MIME, and MOE). Similarly, the SPS reforms have \nstrong political commitment supported through the private sector development forum. \nBoth reforms are supported with capacity development projects that are linked to \nperformance milestones and triggers.  \n\nGDP = gross domestic product; MIME = Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy; MOC = Ministry of Commerce; MOE = \nMinistry of Environment; RIA = regulatory impact assessment; SPS = sanitary and phytosanitary standard. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \nThe  government  has  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  PED-SP2  and  the  CREST \n31. \nproject  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the financing agreement and the PAM. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  and  grants  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \n\n \n32. \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR6,565,000  to  the  Kingdom  of \nCambodia for subprogram 2 of the Promoting Economic Diversification Program \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% \nper annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, a term of 24 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  financing \nagreement presented to the Board; \nthe  grant  not  exceeding  $9,000,000 \nfor \nsubprogram 2, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, on terms and conditions as \nare  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  financing \nagreement presented to the Board; and \nthe  grant  not  exceeding  $5,000,000  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  capacity \ndevelopment  to  support  the  Promoting  Economic  Diversification  Program  from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, on terms and conditions that are substantially in \naccordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  grant  agreement  presented  to  the \nBoard.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\nthe  Kingdom  of  Cambodia, \n\nto \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6 September 2010 \n\n\f \n\nDesign \nSummary \nImpact  \nExpanded and \ndiversified private \nsector \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n\nPerformance Targets and/or \nIndicators \n\nUpdate on Status of \nPerformance Targets \n\n \nBy 2015: \n\n(i) Increased share of \nnontraditional sectors in non-\nagriculture GDP (baseline 2007 \n= 59% of non-agriculture GDP) \n(ii) Increased non-garment \nexports (processed foods and \nbeverages, handicrafts, etc.) by \n5%\u201310% per year (baseline \n2007)  \n\nOutcome \nImproved business \nenvironment where \nthe private sector \noperates efficiently \nand effectively \n\nBy the end of 2012: \n\n(i) 15% increase in the number \nof registered enterprises \n(baseline 2007 = 16,450)  \n(ii) Increase in investment to \nGDP (baseline 2006 = 16.9%) \n\nOutputs \n1.
