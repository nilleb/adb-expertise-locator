I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste for the Road Network Upgrading Sector Project.1 \n \n2.  The proposed project will (i) upgrade and climate-proof about 117 kilometers (km) of \nprincipal national roads, (ii) expand the road maintenance program of the Ministry of Public \nWorks (MPW), and (iii) prepare detailed designs and environmental and social due diligence for \nupgrading 169 km of principal national roads through future projects. The project is in line with \nthe ongoing efforts of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other development partners to \nsupport the progressive upgrading of the entire national road network.2   \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  From 1975 to 1999, a struggle for independence in Timor-Leste led to a prolonged \nviolent conflict. Timor-Leste gained independence in 2002 after a brief period under United \nNations administration. However, it had suffered massive losses of livelihoods, social capital, \nand basic social services. Public infrastructure had been destroyed or become dilapidated. \nInternational assistance was provided to start building government institutional capacity and \nstate authority from scratch. However, from 2006 to 2008, internal factionalism resulted in the \ntemporary displacement of nearly a quarter of the population, which disrupted recovery efforts. \nInternational  support  for  maintaining  law  and  order  was  again  required  until  2012.  While \nconsiderable progress has been made, Timor-Leste remains fragile and its institutions remain \nweak in many respects. ADB\u2019s institutional approach to achieving development effectiveness in \na fragile and conflict-affected situation (FCAS) is relevant to the design of the project.3 \n \n4.  Since 2005, Timor-Leste's economy has derived most of its income from offshore oil and \ngas. Its sovereign wealth fund had accumulated more than $13 billion by March 2013.4  With \nwithdrawals  from  the  fund  prudently  managed,  it  is  well  placed  financially  to  invest  in \ndevelopment. Government spending has generated strong economic momentum with gross \ndomestic product (excluding the petroleum sector and United Nations contribution) growing at \nan average annual rate of 11.7% between 2008 and 2012. The economy is forecast to grow \n9.5% in 2013 and 10% in 2014, driven by continuing government spending.5 The effect of \ngovernment spending on stimulating business opportunities and investment are expected to \nunderpin long-term prospects for private sector development and future economic growth.  \n \n5.  In 2011, the government published its Strategic Development Plan (SDP), 2011\u20132030, \nwhich aims to sustain economic growth and fast-track economic development to achieve a \nmodern and diversified economy with high-quality infrastructure. The SDP envisages three \npillars for development: social capital development, infrastructure development, and economic \ndevelopment. Public investment (including roads) over the first 5 years of the SDP is intended to \ncreate the conditions to attract private investment and ensure an economy led by the private \nsector by 2030. An efficient and safe transport system is essential to achieving the three \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance: ADB. 2012.

Alignment with country strategies is an important element of engagement in an FCAS. \nAdditionally, engagement in an FCAS should promote inclusive growth. Economic expansion in \nDili is encouraging rural\u2013urban migration, but high youth unemployment and high demands on \nbasic services in the city are emerging issues. Diversification of economic activity beyond Dili is \nneeded to help stem these pressures and spread the benefits of petroleum wealth more widely. \nAn efficient transport network is central to economic diversification and national integration. \n \n7.  The poor condition of the roads results in high costs and unreliable services. The core \nnetwork comprises 1,426 km of national roads and 869 km of district roads. About 3,000 km of \nrural roads provide access to villages and more remote areas. Only about 8% of the core road \nnetwork is assessed to be in fair condition and about 70% in very poor condition,6 which is \nconstraining the country\u2019s efforts to emerge from fragility. Support is essential to bring about \n\u201cquick wins\u201d and transformational changes to the road network to underpin economic progress \nand social stability.  \n \n8.  The  MPW,  with  ADB  assistance,  has  developed  the  Medium-Term  Road  Network \nDevelopment  Program,  the  implementation  of  which  started  in  2010.  The  Road  Network \nDevelopment Sector Project, the Road Network Upgrading Project, and projects supported by \nthe Japan International Cooperation Agency and the World Bank are being implemented and \nwill upgrade about 356 km of road.7 These projects supported by Timor-Leste\u2019s development \npartners are closely coordinated and are piloting performance-based road maintenance by \nincluding 2-year post construction maintenance in the construction contracts. Performance-\nbased  maintenance  will  help  alleviate  capacity  shortages  that  constrain  effective  road \nmaintenance. Local contractors now have the capacity for such maintenance, but they do not \nhave the capacity for major upgrading work. International contractors will be needed in the short \nand medium term.8   \n \n9.  Road safety is a related and emerging issue. Inadequate enforcement of regulations, \nlack of road safety awareness, and poor road conditions contribute to high accident rates. In \n2012, 76 people died on Timor-Leste\u2019s roads, according to traffic police data. However, the \nWorld Health Organization\u2019s 2013 Global Status Report on Road Safety suggests significant \nunderreporting of fatalities and gives a likely point estimate of 190 deaths\u2014or 19.5 per 100,000 \npopulation.9 The vehicle fleet is expanding rapidly, especially motorcycles, with a  threefold \nincrease in motorcycles between 2005 and 2009.  \n \n10.  The MPW is responsible for planning, developing, and maintaining roads. In many FCAS, \nhuman capacity shortages are a major constraint. The MPW\u2019s Directorate of Roads, Bridges, \nand Flood Control (DRBFC) has only 12 engineers, severely limiting its capacity to manage the \nroad infrastructure. More professional staff, particularly new graduates, are required to make \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2008.

ADB supports the preparation of a medium-term capacity \ndevelopment  framework  for  the  MPW.10  Ongoing  technical  assistance  (TA)  supports \nscholarships and a technical upgrading program.11 Twinning arrangements with public works \nand highways departments in Indonesia and the Philippines are being developed. A project \nmanagement unit (PMU) will continue to be essential for the management of projects financed \nby development partners. In line with FCAS principles, the PMU will be gradually integrated with \nthe line ministry.  \n \n11.  Since 1999, ADB has been the lead development agency in the road sector. It has \nprovided six TA projects, three project grants, one sector grant, and two loans for the road \nsector. The  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS),  2011\u20132015 12  continues  ADB\u2019s  strategic \ndirections  by  concentrating  on  infrastructure  development  and  management.  ADB  plans  to \nprovide complementary assistance in the core specializations of finance, regional cooperation \nand integration, and education. ADB will also support the private sector as a key driver of \nchange to help make the transition from an economy led by the public sector.13 ADB support for \ninfrastructure, financial services,  and  skills  training  will  help  meet  the  needs  of  a growing \neconomy. An emphasis on the provision of services outside the capital will support growth of the \nrural economy. Poverty will be reduced, particularly in rural areas, by connecting the poor to \nmarkets and expanding the availability of basic public services.  \n \n12.  The emphasis in the CPS on infrastructure reflects its importance to the achievement of \nthe government\u2019s development priorities for 2011\u20132017, as well as ADB\u2019s established presence \nand comparative strength in infrastructure. ADB will help coordinate capacity development and \ninvestment programming across infrastructure sectors (particularly road transport, and water \nand sanitation), and help mobilize financial resources for infrastructure investment. \n \n13.  The Road Network Upgrading Sector Project will upgrade priority sections of the national \nroad network. The project will finance the upgrading of the trans-island road from Manatuto to \nNatarbora,  which  will  greatly  improve  national  connectivity  and  directly  support  the \ngovernment\u2019s petroleum and gas developments on the south coast.14 The project will also \nfinance the preparation of other high-priority road links. \n \n14.  The  project  seeks  to  increase  the  scale  of  ADB\u2019s  support  by  leveraging  the \ngovernment\u2019s financial capacity for investment in infrastructure, as effective programs in FCAS \noften have fewer but larger projects consistent with priority public investment programs (footnote \n3). Other lessons from ADB\u2019s previous projects are incorporated in the project design. These \ninclude (i) paying sufficient attention to climate resilience in project design, (ii) using sector \napproaches to allow the government to progressively expand its leadership in the road sector, \n(iii) paying  attention  to  institutional  capacity  and  long-term  road  maintenance  strategies  to \nachieve sustainability, and (iv) encouraging community participation in roadwork to extend the \nbenefits of national road development to roadside communities.15 \n \n                                                \n10  ADB. 2007.

The impact of the project will be increased and more efficient movement of people and \ngoods. The outcome will be a more reliable and safer road network provided by the MPW. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n16.  Five outputs will contribute to the project outcome and impact: \n \n(i)  Upgrade and climate-proof national roads. About 117 km of roads will be \nupgraded to a climate-resilient standard including priority roads of 81 km from \nManatuto to Natarbora. \n(ii)  Prepare detailed designs for future priority road links. Detailed engineering \ndesign and social and environmental due diligence will be prepared for about 169 \nkm of national roads.  \n(iii)  Expand performance-based road maintenance. The civil works contractors \nwill maintain the upgraded road sections for 2 years after physical completion. \nLocal contractors will be trained in performance maintenance, and performance-\nbased contracts will be used for future maintenance. \n(iv)  Generate awareness of road safety and transport-related social issues. A \ncommunity-based  road  safety  awareness  program,  including  education  for \nschools,  drivers,  road  users,  communities,  and  HIV/AIDS  prevention  will  be \ncarried out. A multiyear national road safety action plan will be initiated. \n(v)  Provide  project  management  support.  The  project  includes  management \nsupport for the implementing agency through strengthening its PMU. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n17.  The project is estimated to cost $123.25 million including taxes and duties, and financing \ncharges during implementation.

Interest during construction for ADB ordinary capital resources (OCR) \nloans has been computed at the 5-year forward London interbank offered rate plus a spread of 0.4% and a \nmaturity premium of 0.1%, and at 2% per year for ADB Asian Development Fund loans. Commitment charges for \nthe ADB OCR loan are 0.15% per year to be charged on the undisbursed OCR loan amount.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "5 \n18.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $40  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year \n(the interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in the loan), and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreements.16 The ordinary capital resources \nloan from ADB will finance civil works, consultants\u2019 services, taxes and duties, late payment \ncharges imposed by suppliers and contractors, bank charges, local transport and insurance \ncharges, and interest during construction.17  \n \n19.  The government has also requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR \n6,672,000 ($10 million) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the project. The \nloan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2.0% per \nannum during the grace period and thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe  draft  loan  agreement.  The  Asian  Development  Fund  loan  will  finance  equipment, \nconsultants\u2019  services,  taxes  and  duties,  late  payment  charges  imposed  by  suppliers  and \ncontractors,  bank  charges,  local  transport  and  insurance  charges,  and  interest  during \nconstruction. \n \n20.  The government will contribute $73.25 million toward the cost of civil works, taxes and \nduties, and resettlement costs from its Infrastructure Fund (derived from the sovereign wealth \nfund). The government\u2019s willingness to share a large percentage of the costs demonstrates the \npriority it places on the project and road development. \n \n21.  The financing plan is in Table 2. The government has assured ADB that it will meet any \nfinancing shortfall to ensure project outputs are fully implemented. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of \nSource  ($ million)    Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank (ADF)  10.00    8.11 \nAsian Development Bank (OCR)  40.00    32.46 \nGovernment  73.25    59.43 \n  Total    123.25    100.00 \nADF = Asian Development Fund, OCR = ordinary capital resources. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  An existing PMU within the MPW manages externally supported major road upgrading \nprojects. While each development partner maintains separate responsibility for its respective \nprojects,  close  collaboration  reduces  project  management  costs  by  facilitating  the  use  of \nstandardized  approaches,  as  well  as  safeguards  assessments  and  monitoring.  The  basic \nfunctions of the PMU are financed by ongoing projects. The project will create an environmental \nand social unit within the PMU by providing international and national environmental specialists, \nresettlement specialists, and a social and gender development specialist. \n                                                \n16 The government has opted for a straight-line repayment option; the average loan maturity is 15.25 years and the \nmaturity premium payable to ADB is 0.1% per annum. \n17 Financing of late payment charges and bank charges will avoid potential administrative delays. The amount of \ntaxes and duties (i) is within the reasonable threshold identified during the CPS preparation, (ii) does not represent \nan excessive share of the project investment plan, and (iii) will only be financed for ADB-financed expenditures. \nFinancing of taxes and duties is material and relevant to the success of the project. \n ", "6 \n23.  The PMU will undertake the day-to-day project management, and assist the National \nProcurement  Commission  with  the  preparation  of  bidding  documents  for  civil  works  and \nconsultants services. To align the project with government systems, the National Procurement \nCommission will also procure civil works and consultants\u2019 services contracts using quality- and \ncost-based selection. The Ministry of Transport and Communications will be the implementing \nagency for a National Road Safety Action Plan and for the public transport policy review. It will \nbe the focal point for coordination among stakeholders.  \n \n24.  Additional financing may be considered in the future if the project performs well. The \noriginal loans will be used to prepare designs and undertake safeguards due diligence for an \nadditional 169 km of national roads. The feasibility assessment and design of the Manatuto to \nNatarbora subproject has been completed and procurement of civil works and consultants \nservices is being undertaken in advance.  \n \n25.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n26.  Upgrading will include strengthening and widening from a width of generally less than \n4.5  meters  to  6  meters.  Climate  resilience  will  be  emphasized  in  subproject  engineering \ndesigns. Vulnerability to damage from severe rainfall, sea level rise, and other potential effects \nof climate change will be reduced through engineering countermeasures, including ensuring \nsuitably  sized  drainage  structures,  raising  road  levels  in  flood-prone  areas,  and  using \nbioengineering to promote slope stability. \n   \nB.  Economic and Financial \n27.  Timor-Leste still exhibits many of the characteristics of an FCAS. Consequently, rates of \nreturn on investments are likely to be lower and associated risks higher as the country seeks to \nreintegrate socially and economically, while ensuring that the benefits of stability and economic \ngrowth are inclusive. In accordance with ADB\u2019s approach to engaging with weakly performing \ncountries, economic internal rates of return in Timor-Leste should not be expected to be the \nsame as in other developing member countries (footnote 3). \n \n28.  The core subproject\u2014the Manatuto to Natarbora road\u2014links the north coast road to \nlarge-scale development planned to support the oil and gas industries on the south coast. \nBecause the condition of the existing road is poor, all forms of development are suppressed. By \nconsidering only the demand generated by those south coast developments for which there is a \nhigh level of certainty, a conservative approach to estimation of future traffic has been taken. \nOther  nonquantifiable  benefits,  such  as  road  safety,  and  improved  access  to  health  and \neducation, have not been included. The economic assessment also does not take into account \nbenefits such as political stability and national integration, which are potentially significant. \nBecause of the mountainous terrain, the cost of constructing the road to a standard sufficient to \ncatalyze the development as envisaged is relatively high.19 The economic internal rate of return \nof the preferred option has been calculated to be 10.2%.   \n \n29.  Upgrading of the road while incorporating climate resilience measures will substantially \nreduce future operation and maintenance costs. Maintaining the unimproved road to a basic \nserviceable standard is estimated to cost $1.25 million a year, nearly four times the $0.32 million \nfor  upgraded  the  road.  Current  budget  allocations  for  maintenance,  which  include  for \nemergencies,  are  sufficient.  Needs  will  reduce  as  roads  are  upgraded  and  maintenance \npractices improve.   \n \nC.  Governance \n30.  The public financial management system is heavily centralized with numerous controls \nthat  have  resulted  in  bottlenecks  that  slow  payment  processes  and  weaken  budget \nimplementation. Decentralization of noncore financial management functions from the Ministry \nof  Finance  to  line  ministries  has  been  promoted,  as  capacity  within  these  agencies  has \nincreased. However, the system for payments continues to involve a number of agencies in \nreviewing the payment certificates provided by the PMU and MPW. \n \n31.  The Procurement Commission was established in 2011. With the assistance of the PMU, \nthe commission satisfactorily administered bidding processes in 2012 for ADB-financed projects \n                                                \n19 To accommodate container traffic, a minimum 6 meter carriageway with 1 meter shoulders is needed. \n ", "8 \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines. However, the transparency and efficiency of procurement \nstill needs improvement, and a balance between risk and accountability for projects without \ndevelopment partner oversight has not yet been achieved. \n \n32.  The executing agency, Conselho de Administracao do Fundo Infraestrutura (CAFI),  was \nestablished in 2011 to oversee the use of the Infrastructure Fund.20 The Civil Service Act (2004) \nprovides standards, principles, definitions, and guidelines for civil service administration; a code \nof ethics for civil servants; and an administrative disciplinary mechanism. A law creating the new \nAnti-Corruption Commission became effective in 2009, and the first anticorruption commissioner \nwas appointed in 2010. However, the independence of this commission needs to be assured \nand it needs to be resourced effectively. \n \n33.  To  mitigate  the  risks,  the  MPW  has  implemented  a  number  of  ADB-supported \ninfrastructure projects through the PMUs. A PMU was created within the MPW to administer the \nRoad Network Development Sector Project and was expanded for the Road Network Upgrading \nProject. It will be strengthened to administer this project. The PMU has a financial administrator \nwho  has  considerable  experience  with  ADB-financed  projects.  Based  on  previous  project \nimplementation experience, the PMU has sufficient capacity to manage the project. \n \n34.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  the \ngovernment  and  the  CAFI.  Specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the project administration manual (footnote 18). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n35.  The primary beneficiaries of the project are (i) road users, including vehicle drivers, \npassengers, and/or nonmotorized transport users; (ii) households in communities that sell cash \ncrops and other agricultural produce; (iii) providers of passenger and goods transport services \nand commercial truck drivers; and (iv) small businesses and traders, including vendors at local \nmarkets, trade store owners, coffee and other produce buyers, and small- and medium-sized \nenterprises in the district capitals and towns. Key social service providers, such as those in the \neducation and health sectors, will also benefit from road upgrading. \n \n36.  Women  have  been  generally  excluded  from  infrastructure-related jobs  and  decision \nmaking related to infrastructure development. The project aims to redress this. Classified as \n\u201ceffective gender mainstreaming,\u201d the project is designed to support women\u2019s empowerment by \nconsidering  their  views  and  requirements  in  the  design  of  the  subprojects.  Women\u2019s \ninvolvement in all jobs under the project will be promoted.21 The project will (i) incorporate \nwomen\u2019s views in the project design; (ii) raise awareness of gender and transport security, and \nHIV/AIDS; (iii) have a quota for women in the construction work, favoring unemployed widows, \nfemale heads of households, and other vulnerable groups; and (iv) have a quota for women\u2019s \ninvolvement in bioengineering and maintenance works. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n37.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The project has been classified as \ncategory B for resettlement and category C for indigenous peoples. The improvement of roads \nis expected to be mostly within the existing road corridor, but will require some resettlement \n                                                \n20 The Infrastructure Fund is derived from the petroleum revenue-financed sovereign wealth fund and used for \nfinancing infrastructure development. \n21 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \ninvolving small areas of land, some houses and shops, and roadside stalls and kiosks. A \nresettlement framework has been prepared, providing guidelines on screening, assessment, \nand the preparation of resettlement plans for road subprojects. A draft resettlement plan has \nbeen prepared for the core subproject. This has been disclosed, along with the resettlement \nframework on the government and ADB websites. Resettlement plans for other subprojects will \nbe  prepared  during  implementation  following  the  resettlement  framework.  The  MPW  will \nendorse and publicly disclose the resettlement framework and draft resettlement plan, and \ndisseminate relevant information in local languages in subproject areas. \n \n38.   The MPW will finalize the resettlement plan for each subproject after the detailed design \nis prepared, and ensure that affected persons receive compensation following the resettlement \nframework. The MPW will (i) appoint a focal person for land issues; (ii) set up an environmental \nand social unit within PMU, including social safeguard specialists; (iii) coordinate with the \nDepartment of Land, Property and Cadastral Services and other relevant agencies; and (iv) set \nup  national  and  district  committees  to  implement  resettlement  activities.  The  project  will \nstrengthen  the  MPW\u2019s  social  safeguard  capacity  by  providing  resettlement  specialists  (30 \nperson-months) and by conducting training.   \n \n39.  Environment.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  the  environment.  An \nenvironmental assessment and review framework (EARF) has been prepared to ensure that the \nproject will comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and Timor-Leste laws. An \ninitial environmental examination (IEE) has been prepared for the core subproject based on the \ndetailed design. This has been publicly disclosed, along with the EARF on the government and \nADB websites. IEEs of five candidate subprojects have also been undertaken, and these will be \nupdated based on the detailed design. The environmental impacts of road upgrading works \nduring construction and operation have been assessed, and can be mitigated to acceptable \nlevels.  \n \n40.  The Environmental Management Plan (EMP) from the updated IEE for each subproject \nwill  be  incorporated  in  civil  works  contracts.  The  EMP  will  guide  the  PMU,  supervision \nconsultants,  and  contractors  in  managing,  monitoring,  and  reporting  environmental  impact \nmitigations and compliance. Civil works will not start until (i) the contractor has received training \non environmental management and has submitted the site-specific EMP; (ii) the site-specific \nEMP has been reviewed and cleared by the PMU and supervision consultant; and (iii) an \nenvironment license has been obtained from the National Directorate for Environment. During \nimplementation,  the  environmental  management  capacity  of  the  DRBFC  and  PMU  will  be \nstrengthened through environment specialists who will provide training.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n41.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.22 The  risks  can  be  managed  and  are \nmitigated by the design of the project. The intended benefits and impacts are expected to \noutweigh the costs.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n22 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLand acquisition delays the  Resettlement plans will be finalized and compensation will be paid before \nstart of civil works.  civil works begin.
