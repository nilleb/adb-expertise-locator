The report  also  describes the  proposed  administration  of  technical \nassistance (TA) to be provided by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for the Strengthening \nSocial  Resilience  Program,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the TA. \n \n2. \nThe proposed program aims to support the Government of Bangladesh in strengthening \nthe social resilience of its people. The programmatic approach, consisting of two subprograms, is \nproposed to design and support sequenced policy packages and to enhance the inclusiveness \nand responsiveness of social development in Bangladesh.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nBangladesh  has  made  remarkable  progress  in  reducing  poverty  over  the  past  two \ndecades. The poverty incidence declined from 48.9% in 2000 to 20.5% in 2019.2 However, while \nmany  people  were  lifted  from  extreme  poverty,  a  considerable  number  continue  to  live  at  a \nsubsistence level barely sustained by day work. These are the people who are highly vulnerable \nto shocks such as major illnesses and external events, including disasters triggered by natural \nhazards. The 2016 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) indicated that in addition \nto those living below the poverty line, 18.6%3 of the population remained vulnerable.4 \n \n4. \nThe  nature  of  poverty  and  vulnerability  gradually  changed  as  the  country  underwent \nurbanization and demographic transformation. The share of the urban population doubled from \n20% in 1990 to close to 40% by 2019. Poverty declined in both urban and rural areas, but the \ndecline was greater in rural areas. The number of rural poor fell from 52 million in 1995 to less \nthan 38 million by 2016, while the number of urban poor was kept constant at about 12 million.5 \nFurther,  demographic  changes  are  creating  a  new  type  of  vulnerability.  The  share  of  elderly \npeople (aged 60 and over) is estimated to be increasing from 7.1% in 2015 to 9.6% by 2025, and \nto  reach  22.0%  by  2050  (footnote  3).  This  has  implications  for  the  country's  social  protection \nneeds since it does not have a comprehensive pension system in place. The 2016 HIES showed \nthat almost 50% of the elderly were poor or vulnerable.  \n \n5. \nThe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic significantly affected the socioeconomic \nsituation of Bangladesh. The growth rate of its gross domestic product (GDP) decreased by 3% \nin 2020, from a pre-COVID-19 estimate of 8.2%. The economy took a particularly sharp turn in \nApril\u2013May 2020 when international trade and remittances declined substantially. Unemployment \n\n \n\n1  The policy design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government of Bangladesh, Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. 2019. Bangladesh Statistics 2019. Dhaka. \n3  Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission, General Economics Division. 2020.  Midterm Progress Review \n\non the National Social Security Strategy. Dhaka. \n\n4  Bangladesh defines vulnerable people as those having incomes above the national poverty line but below a level of \n\n25% more, i.e., below 1.25 times the national poverty line. \n\n5  While the urban poverty rate declined in relative terms because of the increase  in the total urban population, the \n\nabsolute number of urban poor remained fairly constant. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nsurged to 22.4% during April\u2013July 2020, from 2.1% in March 2020.6 Among those hit hardest by \nthe pandemic are poor people who faced further impoverishment, and many vulnerable people \nwho fell back into poverty. \n \nTo mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the government introduced stimulus \n6. \npackages  in  March  2020,  such  as  financial  support  for  health  workers  and  for  employment \ngeneration. Macroeconomic policies, including monetary and exchange rate interventions, were \neffective in ensuring external balance and price stability, and helped respond rapidly and flexibly \nto the internal and external impacts of COVID-19. International trade and remittances have been \nrecovering  since  late  2020.  The  unemployment  rate  decreased  to  3.8%  in  September  2020 \n(footnote 6). The fiscal deficit is at a manageable level. Both the external debt ratio and the public \ndebt ratio are stable in the medium term. Debt policy and management also remain strong and \nprudent, which keeps Bangladesh at low risks of debt distress.7 The International Monetary Fund \n(IMF) provided an assessment letter.8 According to it, Bangladesh\u2019s economy is recovering due \nto the implementation of the stimulus packages and an expansionary fiscal policy, and it properly \neased its monetary policy to mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19 pandemic. However, the \nuncertainty of a prolonged COVID-19 pandemic remains. Since late March 2021, Bangladesh is \nexperiencing a second wave of the pandemic, and the government had to impose a lockdown to \ncontrol  it,  which  is  expected  to  slow  down  the  economic  recovery  and  further  threatens  the \nlivelihoods of poor and vulnerable people. \n \n7. \nContinued social protection support is critical to cushioning the effects of the pandemic. \nThe government intends to leverage the COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity to strengthen its \nsocial  protection  programs  as  an  essential  means  of  building  the  resilience  of  the  poor; 9 \nsupporting inclusive recovery; and working toward faster, sustainable, and resilient development. \n \n8. \nIn 2015, the government formulated the National Social Security Strategy (NSSS) with a \nmedium-to-long-term  framework  for  social  protection  development.10 The  NSSS  presents  the \nlong-term vision of building an inclusive social protection system that helps prevent poverty and \ninequality and contributes to broader human development. It seeks to streamline and strengthen \nthe  existing  social  protection  programs  with  a  view  to  achieving  better  results  from  the  money \nspent. It defines the medium-term reform targets: (i) improving the coverage of social protection, \n(ii) developing a national social insurance scheme (NSIS), (iii) harmonizing the social protection \nprograms,  (iv) improving  financial  inclusion  by  promoting  the  government  to  person  (G2P) \npayment  system,  (v)  strengthening  the  grievance  redress  mechanisms,  and  (vi)  developing  a \nresults-based  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  system.  The  Eighth  Five-Year  Plan  for  2020\u2013\n2025 (8th plan) stresses the importance of a wider and more inclusive social protection system \nfor an inclusive recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The 8th plan suggests accelerating the \nsocial protection reforms defined in the NSSS. \n \nDevelopment  constraints.  The  NSSS  points  to  critical  shortcomings  in  the  social \n9. \nprotection system: (i) fragmentation with too many programs and targeting errors, (ii) inadequate \n\n \n\n6  Government of Bangladesh, Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. 2020.

Dhaka. \n\n \n\n\fcoverage  and  benefits,  and  (iii)  narrow  scope  of  social  protection. 11  It  also  highlights  the \nincreasing importance of achieving financial inclusion of disadvantaged people through advanced \nfinancial  and  digital  technologies.  It  further  suggests  a  conceptual  change  from  the  current \nfragmented approach to a life cycle approach that tackles causes of poverty at different stages of \nlife. For example, the life cycle approach considers maternal support to reduce the economic risks \nassociated with pregnancy and early childhood, and support for the elderly to mitigate the risks \nassociated with old age and disability. The current social protection scope in Bangladesh is too \nlimited to meet the varying social needs arising in a life cycle. \n \n10. \nFragmentation with too many programs. Bangladesh\u2019s social protection initiatives were \ndeveloped ad hoc, which led to the creation of too many programs and a fragmented system. The \nearly efforts focused mainly on post-disaster relief to support the affected people. Food security \nprograms were also initiated early on, focusing on the extreme poor in rural areas and on seasonal \npoverty during lean agricultural periods. Various social protection programs were established to \nmeet  specific  needs.  More  than  100  programs  involving  multiple  implementation  ministries \neventually emerged, often leading to duplications and inefficient service delivery, and reducing \nthe  impact  of  social  protection.  The  largest  20  programs  receive  about  70%  of the total  social \nprotection budget, while the smallest 50 programs receive less than 2%. The midterm review of \nthe NSSS suggested to consolidate programs to avoid duplications, extend beneficiary coverage, \nand achieve efficiency. The NSSS envisages such a program consolidation at the ministerial level, \nbut this  has  not  happened.  The  government first  needs to  prepare the  policy  base to facilitate \nministerial actions. \n \n11. \nFurther, the programs lack integrated administrative processes as they are managed by \nvarious  ministries,  such  as  the  Ministry  of  Social  Welfare  (MSW),  the  Ministry  of  Women  and \nChildren Affairs, and the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief. The program administration \nis  not  fully  digitalized,  making  it  hard  to  collect  comprehensive  data  and  information  on  social \nprotection beneficiaries, and to implement effective M&E. In addition, social protection programs \nin  Bangladesh  have  high  targeting  errors\u2014both  exclusion  errors  (i.e.,  when  people  are  not \ncovered by social protection despite being eligible) and inclusion errors (i.e., when non-eligible \npeople are covered) (footnote 3). The NSSS stresses the importance of establishing an integrated \nregistry of social protection beneficiaries with a functional management information system (MIS), \nwhich  will  improve  registration  transparency,  reduce  duplication,  increase  the  efficiency  of \nprograms,  and  maximize  the  overall  benefits  of  social  protection.  It  will  also  make  M&E  more \neffective.  \n \nInadequate  coverage.  Despite  the  large  number  of  social  protection  programs,  the \n12. \nbudgetary allocation for social protection has been low in Bangladesh\u20141.0%\u20131.5% of GDP. This \nmeans that many programs do not have enough resources to make a substantial impact on their \ntarget groups or are not able to cover all the eligible people. This is true even for key programs \nsuch as the old age allowance or the allowance for widowed, deserted, and destitute women.12 \nFor example, about 380 of 492 upazilas (administrative units at the subdistrict level) cover only \n60%\u201370%  of  the  eligible  elderly  or  the  eligible  women  under  those  programs.  As  the  8th  plan \nhighlights,  the  COVID-19  pandemic  has  exposed  the  substantial  social  vulnerabilities  and  the \nneed for scaling up the government's spending on social protection. The plan suggests increasing \ngovernment expenditure on social protection from 1.2% of GDP in fiscal year (FY) 2019 to 2.0% \nof GDP by FY2025. \n\n11 Sector Assessment (Summary): Multisector (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n12 The old age allowance program provides poor elderly people with a reliable source of income. The allowance program \n\nfor widowed, deserted, and destitute women provides cash transfers to eligible women. \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fFinancial exclusion. The government recognizes the potential of financial inclusion for \n13. \ndisadvantaged  people  to  increase  their  income-generating  opportunities  and  strengthen  their \nsocial  resilience.  The  Seventh  Five-Year  Plan  for  2016\u20132020  suggested  promoting  financial \ninclusiveness by developing and enhancing the G2P payment system (digital payment of social \nprotection benefits).13 The NSSS also highlights the issue of financial inclusion and the potential \nof G2P to enhance financial inclusion of social protection beneficiaries. The 8th plan reinforces \nthis  policy  direction  (footnote  9).  However,  Bangladesh  has  not  yet  developed  an  enabling \nenvironment for it. Nearly 50% of the population is still unbanked.14 A main stumbling block are \nthe  documentation  and  identification  requirements  for  opening  a  bank  account.  To  improve \naccess to financial services, the government aims to enhance the use of mobile financial services \n(MFS), which are becoming popular even among disadvantaged people, including women and \nmicrobusiness operators. However, MFS transactions are not interoperable across all the banks \nand all MFS providers, which hinders their wider use. Further, current MFS in Bangladesh do not \nmatch the needs of poor households. Poor households need financial products that allow small-\nvalue  day-to-day  transactions,  yet  the  acceptance  of  digital  payments  is  still  limited  among \nretailers and merchants. Moreover, disadvantaged people tend to be  hesitant about accessing \nfinancial and digital services because of their limited financial and digital literacy. The regulatory \nauthority needs to lower the barriers for disadvantaged people and ease their access to financial \nservices.  It  also  needs  to  establish  incentives  for  financial  institutions  and  MFS  providers  to \nimprove the availability of their services, and for retailers to accept digital payments more broadly. \n \n14. \nLimited  scope  to  meet  life  cycle  social  and  health  needs.  Social  protection  in \nBangladesh focuses on poverty relief in rural areas. Urbanization creates a gap between social \nneeds and available protection because the system does not meet the diversified social needs. \nFor  example,  social  protection  provides  a  safety  net  for  seasonal  unemployment  during  lean \nagricultural  periods,  but  it  has  no  scheme  to  help  mitigate  the  impacts  of  employment  loss  or \nsickness on many urban workers. Individuals face different risks across the life cycle, from birth \nto  old  age.  The  poverty  rates  in  households  with  children  aged  0\u20134  years  are  higher  than  the \nnational  poverty  rates,  which  indicates  the  economic  challenges  caused  by  having  children, \nparticularly if mothers are unable to work (footnote 10). The working-age population faces other \nrisks, such as risks relating to job security. The elderly people face the economic risks associated \nwith aging, such as loss of income and health care costs. Further, economic risks associated with \nhealth and injury incidents can occur at any stage of life. Bangladesh's social protection system \nneeds to be upgraded in line with the economic and demographic developments, and not only to \nmitigate extreme poverty but also to respond to the diversified social and health needs at different \nlife stages. \n \n15. \nFor the first time in the social protection of Bangladesh, the NSSS presented the concept \nof risk pooling by proposing to establish an insurance scheme, such as unemployment insurance \nand  occupational  injury  insurance.  The  NSSS  recognizes  the  initiation  of  the  NSIS  as  a major \nprogrammatic reform. Further, the NSSS stresses that health-related shocks could be devastating \nfor poor and vulnerable people. The need for health care services is  high in rapidly urbanizing \nareas, but the availability of quality and affordable health services remains limited for many urban \npeople.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  underscored  the  need  to  tackle  the  weaknesses  and \nstrengthen health response and preparedness for unanticipated health crises. \n \n\n13 Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission, General Economics Division. 2015. The Seventh Five Year Plan: \n\nFY2016\u2013FY2020. Dhaka. \n\n14 World Bank. 2018. The Global Findex Database 2017. Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fPolicy Reform, ADB\u2019s Value Addition, and Sustainability \n\nAlignment  with  Strategy  2030.  The  program  is  aligned  with  the  country  partnership \n16. \nstrategy,  2016\u20132020  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  Bangladesh,  which  prioritizes \ninvestments in human capital through social programs and improved rural livelihoods;15 and with \nthe operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, particularly 1\u2014addressing remaining poverty \nand  reducing  inequalities,  2\u2014accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality,  and  6\u2014strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity.16 The program will (i) have direct positive impacts on poor, \nvulnerable  women  and  men  by  improving  the  coverage  of  key  social  protection  programs, \n(ii) contribute to gender equality by ensuring the consideration of gender-specific needs in urban \nhealth planning, and (iii) strengthen the institutional capacity for social protection by reforming the \nadministration and management of social protection programs. \n \nB. \n \n17. \nProposed policy reforms. The program provides holistic support to the institutional and \npolicy reforms that will improve the inclusiveness and responsiveness of social development. It \ndefines three reform areas to tackle the cross-sector issues of social development: (i) reform the \nsocial protection system by improving its coverage and efficiency, (ii) ease the policy constraints \non  financial  inclusion,  and  (iii)  transform  social  protection  by  broadening  its  scope.  The  policy \nactions  are  sequenced  to  allow  the  optimal  phasing  of  reforms.  Subprogram  1  supports  the \nestablishment of the national policy frameworks and the removal of technical and administrative \nconstraints that make the social protection system inefficient. Building on this, subprogram 2 will \nfocus on improving the administrative efficiency of the system and on strengthening its response \nto the diversified social and health needs of the people in Bangladesh. \n \nReform area 1: Coverage and efficiency of social protection improved. This reform \n18. \narea focuses on improving the coverage and administration of key social protection programs. To \nreduce  fragmentation,  it will  support  harmonization  of the  social  protection  system through the \nprogram  consolidation.  To  make  their  management  more  efficient,  the  reforms  will  support  to \nstandardize and integrate the administrative processes across programs. \n \n19. \nFor subprogram 1, the government approved an increase in the coverage of the old age \nallowance, and of the allowance for widowed, deserted, and destitute women, to attain the full \ncoverage of eligible people in 150 upazilas.17 These upazilas were selected based on the Poverty \nMaps  of  Bangladesh  and  represent  the  poverty-stricken  areas. 18 In  addition,  the  Ministry  of \nFinance  (MOF)  operationalized  an  MIS  for  administration  of  the  social  protection  budget \nmanagement  over  various  programs  by  implementing  the  automatic  data  transfer  from  MIS \ndatabases of relevant line ministries to the MOF\u2019s MIS; this will help standardize and digitalize \nthe administration of social protection program management and improve the efficiency of service \ndelivery. The programs that have similar features and purposes will be consolidated. To make \nsure that the consolidated schemes and processes are carefully designed and the provision of \nbenefits to eligible people is not interrupted, the government targeted key ministries and issued a \ndirective on the program consolidation to be undertaken by those ministries in subprogram 2. It \ninstructs these ministries to prepare and approve the necessary policies and instruments, such \n\n \n\n15 ADB. 2016. Country Partnership Strategy: Bangladesh, 2016\u20132020. Manila.

To  reform \nprogram  administration,  the  government  will  set  up  an  integrated  registry  of  social  protection \nbeneficiaries, which will enable it to manage various programs with an integrated entry point for \nthe beneficiaries. The integrated system will not affect targeting or the selection of beneficiaries. \nIt will bring beneficiaries under an integrated system, which will improve the processes of benefit \npayments  and  administrative management.  As  part  of  its  ongoing  efforts  to  improve  the  social \nprotection  coverage,  the  government  will  approve  an  increase  in  the  coverage  of  benefits  for \nvulnerable and poor people, such as poor mothers; and boost the volume of an open market sale \nprogram that sells subsidized food to the urban poor. \n \n21. \nReform  area  2:  Financial  inclusion  of  disadvantaged  people  improved.  Financial \ninclusion is increasingly important for overall social inclusiveness, along with the development of \nadvanced digital and financial technology. This reform area thus focuses on creating the enabling \nenvironment  for  broader  financial  inclusion  by  (i)  establishing  a  national  policy  and  strategy, \n(ii) removing policy constraints that undermine access to and availability of financial services, and \n(iii) improving policy conditions to make financial services affordable. \n \n22. \nFor subprogram 1, MOF approved the National Financial Inclusion Strategy\u2013Bangladesh \n(NFIS-B) for submission to the cabinet. The NFIS-B outlines the vision, road map, coordination \nmechanism, and M&E framework for financial inclusion in Bangladesh. As highlighted in the NFIS-\nB, the government promotes the use of MFS as a key tool to enhance the financial inclusion of \ndisadvantaged people. To encourage wider uptake of MFS, Bangladesh Bank adopted a system \nof interoperable transactions across all banks and MFS providers, which eases MFS transactions \nbetween operators and improves the availability of MFS for personal users. To further improve \naccess  to  financial  services,  Bangladesh  Bank  simplified  the  identification  and  documentation \nrequirements for opening a bank account.20 \n \nThe implementation of the NFIS-B involves multiple stakeholders in both the public and \n23. \nprivate sectors. To ensure effective coordination, under subprogram 2, a national NFIS-B council \nwill  be  established  at ministerial  level.  The  council  will  be  chaired  by the  finance minister,  and \nprovide  the  vision,  strategic  direction,  guidance,  and  oversight  for  the  implementation  of  the \nfinancial  inclusion  agenda.  To  broaden  the  acceptance  of  digital  payments  by  retailers, \nBangladesh Bank will issue a pricing guideline on digital payments, which will standardize and \nreduce  the  cost  for  retailers  that  accept  digital  payments.  MOF  will  improve  its  policy  on \nstandardizing MFS commission fees to boost access to MFS by social protection beneficiaries.21 \n \n24. \nReform area 3: Response to life cycle social and health needs strengthened. This \nreform  area  focuses  on  broadening  the  scope  of  protection  from  mere  poverty  relief  to  more \ndiversified responses to social and health needs. Building on the experience from the COVID-19 \n\nconsolidation. \n\n \n\n19 The  procedures  for  notifying  beneficiaries  of  the  consolidation  aspects  will  be  built  into  the  policies  on  program \n\n20 The government also introduced an electronic know-your-customer procedure to improve the accessibility of financial \n\nservices and ensure the necessary customer due diligence. \n\n21 Bangladesh  is increasingly using the G2P electronic payment  system for social protection programs, since about \n2016. For example, under the cash-transfer programs managed by the Ministry of Social Welfare, Tk6.86 billion was \ndelivered digitally as of June 2020. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fpandemic,  the  government  is  strengthening  the  health  system's  preparedness  for  infectious \ndiseases  and  improving  the  health  response  to  urban  populations.  This  reform  area  further \nsupports  the  development  of  a  social  insurance  system  based  on  the  NSIS  framework.  The \ngovernment has prepared a technical study for the NSIS framework which includes an analysis \nof different types of social insurances, such as unemployment insurance and occupational injury \ninsurance. A social insurance scheme will be initially developed based on priority and feasibility, \nwhile several types of social insurance may be covered under the NSIS framework. \n \nUnder  subprogram  1,  the  government  issued  the  directive  on  the  cross-ministerial \n25. \ncoordination  of  preliminary  actions  to  prepare  for  the  selection  and  development  of  a  social \ninsurance scheme based on the NSIS framework. As a key prior action, the directive informs the \nauthority  and  responsibility  of  the  MOF  for  the  cross-ministerial  coordination  and  key \nadministrative  actions  to  be  conducted  before  selecting  a  type  of  social  insurance  and  its \ninsurance  scheme.  The  Ministry  of  Health  and  Family  Welfare  (MOHFW)  approved  the  policy \nguideline on public health and medical research to strengthen the preparedness of the national \nhealth system. This ensures the proper coordination of research into and response to infectious \ndiseases, including epidemics and pandemics, with corresponding budget allocations. This policy \nis  to  improve  the  evidence-based  policy  development  for  strengthening  health  response  and \npreparedness. The MOHFW also approved the National Urban Health Strategy (NUHS), which \nprovides  a  framework  to  strengthen  urban  health  care  services  in  line  with  the  growing  health \nneeds of urban populations.  \n \n26. \nUnder subprogram 2, the government will define a type of social insurance and its scheme \nto be developed as an initial national social insurance scheme, in Bangladesh. The government \nwill also approve the new action plan of the NSSS (2021\u20132026), which includes a national reform \nplan,  and  a  framework  of  reform  activities  to  be  accomplished  by  line  ministries.  Under \nsubprogram 2, the government will also approve the new action plan of the NSSS (2021\u20132026), \nwhich includes a framework of reform activities to be accomplished by line ministries. To improve \nthe response to urban health needs, the Urban Health Coordination Committee will be reformed \nby  redefining  its  authority,  responsibility,  and  coordination  mechanism  for  overseeing  and \nsupervising the cross-ministerial coordination efforts in accordance with the approved NUHS. The \nMOHFW will also implement a program to improve the capacity of the government\u2019s urban health \nfacilities, such as urban dispensaries,22 and provision of services. \n \n27. \nPost-program  partnership  framework.  The  post-program  partnership  framework \n(PPPF) has been formulated to further strengthen the sustainability of the reforms initiated under \nthe  program.  The  PPPF  will  particularly  focus  on  evaluating  improvements  concerning  the \nfragmentation of social protection programs, the level of financial inclusion, and the progress of \nsocial  insurance  development; this  will  help  the  government  achieve  the desired  medium-term \nreform  impacts.  ADB  will  continue  close  policy  dialogue  with  the  government  and  supports  its \nreform efforts under the PPPF. With regard to reform area 1, the PPPF will focus on the progress \nmade in (i) consolidating the social protection programs, (ii) improving the administration of the \nprograms with MISs, and (iii) increasing the coverage of social protection. As regards reform area \n2,  the  PPPF  will  evaluate  the  improvements  made  in  the  availability  and  usability  of  MFS, \ndisaggregated by sex, and urban and rural population. As regards reform area 3, it will monitor \nthe  preparation  and  launch  of  a  pilot  national  social  insurance  scheme.  Activities  under  the \nattached TA will be aligned with the PPPF. \n \n\n22 An urban dispensary is a type of urban health service provide in Bangladesh.  \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fADB\u2019s  value  addition  and  lessons.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  in  2020  required \n28. \nimmediate  action  to  meet  urgent  health,  social,  and  financial  needs.  Aligned  with  the  stimulus \npolicy of the Government of Bangladesh and as an integral part of the National Preparedness and \nResponse  Plan,  ADB  provided  immediate  financial  support  to  help  mitigate  the  impacts  of  the \npandemic  with  a  focus  on  social  safety  nets  and  job  security. 23 ADB  also  supported  urgent \nlogistical and systemic needs arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.24 In addition, ADB continued \nits  assistance  to  better urban health  outcomes  in  Bangladesh  by focusing  on  the  accessibility, \nquality, and use of urban primary health care services.25 \n \n29. \nADB\u2019s experiences confirm the importance of strong and high-level government ownership \nand commitment to tackling the cross-sector and cross-ministerial issues of social development. \nThe coordination of multiple stakeholders and a clear delineation of roles and responsibilities are \ncrucial to improving social and health responses sustainably.26 It is also important to strengthen \npublic  awareness  and  knowledge  of  available  services  and  how  to  access  them,  to  attain  the \nreform impacts. Moreover, the reform process needs to be reasonably flexible to accommodate \na longer-term horizon of social and health development, which makes a programmatic approach \na suitable tool to support the government\u2019s medium- and long-term efforts.27 \n \n30. \nBuilding on its assistance to an inclusive recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and the \nongoing  engagement  in  the  country\u2019s  health  sector,  ADB  engaged  in  a  comprehensive  policy \ndialogue with the government on social protection. This resulted in key contributions to the design \nof  the  government-owned  policy  packages,  such  as  (i)  recognizing  the  potential  of  digital  and \nfinancial technologies to reduce financial exclusion and further enhance inclusive development, \n(ii) taking a life cycle approach to meeting the diversified social needs, and (iii) acknowledging the \nnecessity of health response and preparedness as a requisite for social resilience. ADB will further \nstrengthen  its  support  by  providing  attached  TA  (paras.  38\u201339)  on  (i) evidence-based  M&E  of \nreforms,  (ii) market  analysis  of  MFS  usability, (iii)  harmonization  of  social  protection  programs, \nand (iv) development of a national social insurance scheme. \n \n31. \nDevelopment coordination. Major development partners supporting social protection in \nBangladesh  are  the  United  Kingdom's  Foreign,  Commonwealth  and  Development  Office;  the \nUnited  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP);  the  World  Bank;  and  the  Government  of \nAustralia's  Department  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  Trade.  UNDP  helped  the  General  Economics \nDivision of the Planning Commission to formulate the NSSS; and through a TA program (Social \nSecurity Policy Support Program), Australia, the United Kingdom, and UNDP assisted the General \nEconomics  Division  in  rolling  out  the  activities  under  the  NSSS.  The World  Bank  supports the \ninstitutional strengthening of ministries and the G2P payment system, and also finances part of \nthe  costs  of  major  social  protection  schemes,  such  as  a  cash  transfer  program,  and  the \n\n \n\n23 ADB.  2020.

ADB closely coordinates with development partners in supporting the government to \nmeet its development needs and is also in close and regular contact with the IMF. The program \ncomplements the efforts of development partners by focusing on medium-term institutional and \npolicy reforms to better manage cross-sectoral issues of social development, while at the same \ntime responding to financial needs. \n \n32. \nSome  key  areas  for  further  coordination  with  development  partners  will  be  the  digital \npayment of social protection benefits, and the digital and financial literacy of poor and vulnerable \npeople. Also, developing the NSIS is a core longer-term agenda. ADB will keep communicating \nand  coordinating  with  major  development  partners  to  help  attain  the  objectives  of  social \ndevelopment in Bangladesh. \n \nC. \n \n33. \nBangladesh\u2019s overarching development objective is to strengthen the social resilience of \nits  people.  Aligned  with  that  objective,  the  reforms'  outcome  will  be  inclusiveness  and \nresponsiveness  of  social  development  improved.  Inclusiveness  will  be  supported  with  policy \nactions under reform area 1, i.e., by expanding the coverage of social protection beneficiaries in \n150 poverty-stricken upazilas, with a particular focus on poor women and elderly people. Policy \nactions under reform area 2 will also improve the enabling environment for financial inclusion and \nease  access  to  financial  services  for  the  disadvantaged  population.  Better  efficiency  will  be \nachieved by streamlining and consolidating the social protection programs, and by standardizing \nand  integrating  the  administration  of  the  social  protection  system.  Responsiveness  will  be \nimproved by strengthening the country's preparedness for infectious diseases and its response \nto health needs of urban populations. Responsiveness will be further strengthened by broadening \nthe scope of social protection, particularly by establishing the NSIS. \n \nD. \n \n34. \nThe  Bangladesh  economy  is  recovering  from  the  negative  impacts  of  the  COVID-19 \npandemic  by  the  introduction  of  stimulus  packages  totaling  $15.1  billion  as  of  May  2021.  The \nCOVID-19 pandemic widened the fiscal deficit. ADB estimates that the annual fiscal deficit will \nreach $22.3 billion in FY2021 and $23.9 billion in FY2022.29 Both domestic and external sources \nare used to finance the budget deficits. Domestic source is the major source to fill the deficits. \nThe government targets to finance about 68% of deficits in FY2021 and 63% in FY2022. External \nsources  are  expected  to  fill  about  $7.1  billion  in  FY2021  and  $8.8  billion  in  FY2022.  The \ngovernment  has  received  budget support totaling  $1  billion  from  ADB,  the  Asian Infrastructure \nInvestment  Bank,  and  the  World  Bank  in  FY2020.  Balance-of-payment  support  totaling  $732 \nmillion has received from the IMF. \n \nTo  finance  economic  and  social  development  needs  in  face  of  widening  fiscal  deficit, \n35. \nadditional development financing is required.

The government requested $500 million \nin  financial  assistance  in  the  form  of  a  programmatic  approach,  comprising  two  subprograms \nworth $250 million each, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. \n \nTo help finance subprogram 1, the government requested a regular loan of $250 million \n36. \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period \nof 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year;  and  such  other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the straight-line method, the \naverage maturity is 9.25 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. \n \nE. \n \n37. \nThe Finance Division of MOF is the executing agency. The implementing agencies are the \nCabinet  Division,  MOHFW,  MSW,  and  Bangladesh  Bank.  To  further  strengthen  the  cross-\nministerial coordination of the program's implementation, a steering committee was set up, led by \nthe senior secretary of MOF's Finance Division and comprising representatives from the Cabinet \nDivision, MOF's Financial Institutions Division, MSW, Health Services Division, Medical Education \nand Family Welfare Division, Local Government Division, Bangladesh Bank, Directorate General \nof Health Services, Department of Social Services, Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief, \nand Ministry of Women and Child Affairs. The implementation period will be from July 2020 to \nJune  2021  for  subprogram  1,  and  from  July  2021  to  June  2022  for  subprogram  2. 30  Each \nsubprogram has a single tranche for disbursement. The proceeds of the policy-based loan will be \nwithdrawn following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n\nIII. \n\nATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n38. \nA  TA  attached  to  the  program  will  support  its  implementation,  technical  analyses,  and \ncapacity development for key ministries.31 ADB will administer the TA. MOF will be the executing \nagency.  The  Cabinet  Division,  Bangladesh  Bank,  and  the  MOHFW  will  be  the  implementing \nagencies. The TA will help (i) carry out the evidence-based M&E of the reforms supported by the \nprogram;  (ii) strengthen  the  capacity  for  developing  policies  that  ensure  sustainable  social \ninclusiveness  and  responsiveness,  and  (iii) improve  people's  awareness  of  inclusive  and \nresponsive social protection. \n \n39. \nThe TA is estimated to cost $1,258,000, of which $1,200,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction. The government will provide counterpart support \nin the form of counterpart staff, assistance in arranging meetings with related agencies, and other \nin-kind contributions. TA funds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from time to time). All consultants shall be recruited \nin  accordance  with  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and \nassociated staff instructions. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n40. \nSafeguards. The due diligence identified no environmental, involuntary resettlement, and \nindigenous people impacts as defined by the safeguards assessment matrix of ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (2009).  The  policy  actions  were  assessed  and  will  not  lead  to  adverse \n\n30 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fenvironmental and social impacts. The program will support policy actions that will improve the \ninclusiveness  and  responsiveness  of  social  development  in  Bangladesh. Thus,  the  program  is \ncategorized  C  for  environmental,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  people  safeguards. \nInvestment activities prohibited under the Safeguard Policy Statement will be excluded. \n \n41. \nEconomic. The reforms supported by the program will be instrumental in achieving the \ncountry's inclusive recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, and continue the efforts made toward \nsustainable  development.  The  reforms  will  improve  the  efficiency  and  coverage  of  social \nprotection,  and  lower  the  risks  faced  by  the  poor  and  vulnerable.  The  transmission  channels \ninclude  addressing  administrative  inefficiencies,  promoting  a  more  responsive  distribution  of \navailable  financial  and  health-related  benefits,  and  strengthening  the  financial  inclusion  of  the \npoor  and  disadvantaged.  International  evidence  suggests  potentially  significant  benefits  from \nproductivity and efficiency savings, avoidable costs, and poverty reduction. Further, reinvesting \nthe  savings  from  reduced  administration  costs  in  social  protection  and  health  preparedness \nsystems will lead to greater financial sustainability, coordination, and efficiency, which in turn will \nmitigate the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and help avoid future economic and social \nlosses. \n \n42. \nPoverty. Although Bangladesh substantially reduced its poverty incidence from 48.9% in \n2000 to 20.5% in 2019, it still has a significant number of vulnerable groups. Vulnerable groups \nare generally defined as those experiencing situational disadvantage, at risk of falling below the \npoverty line in the face of adverse shocks and circumstances that reduce their income-earning \nand  livelihood  prospects.  Bangladesh  defines  vulnerable  groups  as  those  who  live  above  the \nnational  poverty  line  but  below  an  income  level  of  1.25  times  the  national  poverty  line.  These \ngroups are estimated to account for 40% of the population, including poor and vulnerable people, \nbased on the 2016 HIES. The program will help improve the coverage and efficiency of social \nprotection, with a positive impact on the poor and vulnerable, including elderly people and widows. \nIt will broaden access to financial services for the poor and vulnerable through wider use of MFS. \nIt  will  also  improve  urban  health  care  services  and  thus  provide  more  support  to  poor  and \nvulnerable urban residents. \n \n43. \nGender. The program is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. Social protection is \na critical driver of poverty reduction because it offers the potential to minimize gender inequalities \nand  intersectional  dimensions  of  exclusion  and  vulnerability  based  on  old  age,  disability, \ngeographic location, and income status. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated \nmobility restrictions, women in urban areas have experienced additional stress, anxiety, and fear, \nas well as more violence. The program will expand its outreach to excluded and vulnerable women \nby increasing the coverage of both the old age allowance (benefiting  women over 62) and the \nallowance for widowed, deserted, and destitute women in 150 upazilas. The program will enhance \nthe  financial  inclusion  of  disadvantaged  people  by  enabling  broader  access  to  digital  financial \nservices, giving particular attention to the gender gap in financial inclusion and the needs voiced \nby vulnerable women and groups. It will support the approval of the NUHS to strengthen health \ncare services for urban populations, taking into account their gender-specific needs. The program \nwill  also  improve  the  management  of  social  protection  with  an  MIS  capable  of  producing  sex-\ndisaggregated data on social protection benefits and providing the tools to obtain quantitative data \nand analyses of poverty and gender-related aspects. \n \nfor \n44. \nBangladesh  were  carried  out  in  2006,  2010,  and  2016.  The  country  has  made  progress  in \ndeveloping its public financial management system with effective fiscal measures since the 2010 \nassessment.  However,  it  is  necessary  to  further  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity  for \n\nGovernance.  Public  expenditure  and \n\nfinancial  accountability  assessments \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nimplementing public financial management reforms and to strengthen the capacity of oversight \ninstitutions  such  as  the Office  of  the  Comptroller  and  Auditor  General  of Bangladesh  (OCAG). \nImprovements are particularly necessary in the areas of internal and external audits. In principle, \nOCAG  is  an  independent  institution.  However,  it  still  requires  more  capacity  enhancements  to \nfully exercise its oversight functions. Inadequate human resources are causing significant delays \nin submitting external audit reports to the Parliament, and in following up on the audit findings. \nADB is providing capacity-building support to OCAG for the provision of training to audit staff, and \nfor the development of an audit manual for foreign-aided projects.32 On the plus side, MOF's major \nrole in budget management contributed to the country\u2019s strong record of fiscal discipline. \n \n45. \nBangladesh  has  most  of  the formal  legislation  in  place  to  be compliant with  the  United \nNations Convention against Corruption. However, Transparency International indicates that the \ncountry\u2019s  performance  in  anticorruption  efforts  is  mixed,  and  the  improvement  in  score  is \ninsignificant.  A  major  challenge  is  the  effectiveness  deficit  of  the  Anti-Corruption  Commission. \nThe commission needs to come up with a strategy to develop institutional capacity and trust. \n \n46. \nin the table and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.33 \n \n\nRisks and mitigating measures. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized \n\nSummary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) \nimpacts are prolonged and more severe \nthan expected, which exacerbates the \nsituation of poor and vulnerable people. \n\nWeak internal and external auditing \ncapacity may lead to reduced efficiency \nand transparency of the government \nsupport programs. \n\nWeak cross-ministerial coordination may \ndelay the preparation of program \nconsolidation. \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nThe government has introduced strong stimulus and \nmitigation measures, such as (i) an increase in public \nexpenditures, (ii) fiscal stimulus, (iii) expanded social safety \nnet programs, and (iv) an increase in money supply. The \ngovernment also presents a medium-term economic recovery \nstrategy in its 8th Five Year Plan (2020\u20132025). The post-\nprogram partnership framework will also help sustain the \nongoing policy dialogue and reform momentum. \nOngoing technical assistance from the Asian Development \nBank (footnote 32) helps build the capacity of the auditor \ngeneral of Bangladesh and the capacity for program auditing. \nAlso, the World Bank is providing support to strengthen the \noverall capacity of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor \nGeneral of Bangladesh.a \nThe program steering committee, led by Senior Secretary of \nFinance Division, Ministry of Finance, and comprising \nrepresentatives from all relevant ministries and agency, has \nbeen set up to strengthen the cross-ministerial coordination \non the program implementation. \nThe attached technical assistance will support the line \nministries in strengthening their technical capacity for program \nconsolidation. \n\nLimited capacity of line ministries may \ndelay the preparation of policies on the \nconsolidation of social protection \nprograms. \na  World Bank. 2018.
