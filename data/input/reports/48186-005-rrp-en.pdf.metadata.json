The  report  also \ndescribes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  Regional  Road  Development  and \nMaintenance Project, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the TA. \n \nMongolia  is  a  large,  sparsely  populated  country  that  is  highly  dependent  on  a  narrow \n2. \neconomic base. Rapid development of the mining sector brought economic growth but only limited \nemployment, the critical ingredient of inclusive economic growth. To promote inclusive economic \ngrowth and regional economic cooperation and trade, the country needs to develop and make \nsafer  its  regional  road  network  and  its  trade  and  logistics  infrastructure  to  boost  agriculture, \nagribusiness, and tourism. The project will rehabilitate and enhance safety of important regional \nroad corridor sections between Ulaanbaatar and Altanbulag. To improve the sustainability of its \ntransport  infrastructure,  it  will  also  help  the  government  improve  the  road  asset  management \n(RAM) and road safety capacity. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nStrategic context.  Since  1991, the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  a major \npartner in the improvement of Mongolia\u2019s transport network and has assisted in developing two \nmajor highway corridors linking Mongolia to the Russian Federation and the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina  (PRC).1  This  has  brought  development,  jobs,  and  social  services  to  those  regions;  and \nimproved the lives of the poor. \n \n4. \nMongolia\u2019s economy has grown rapidly, with gross domestic product increasing more than \n720% from $1.27 billion in 2001 to $10.41 billion in 2011. However, gross domestic product growth \nfell from 17.3% in 2011 to 5.1% in 2017 because of plummeting foreign direct investment, falling \ncommodity  prices,  and  moderating  growth  in  the  PRC.  Mongolia  urgently  needs  to  restore \nmacroeconomic stability in the short term and to develop a more resilient and diversified economy \nthat  can  deliver  rapid,  inclusive,  and  sustainable  growth  in  the  long  term.  This  requires \ninfrastructure  investments  and  regional  integration  to  improve  connectivity  and  access  to \ndomestic and external markets.2 \n \nMongolia\u2019s poverty rate is high for a lower middle-income economy.3 Much of the poverty \n5. \nstems from unemployment, the absence of local markets, and lack of higher education in rural \nareas. The poor condition of roads aggravates persistent poverty conditions, particularly in rural \nareas. The rural population has limited access to social services and major markets in the region \n\n                                                \n1  ADB. 1995.

Manila. \n\n3  Middle-income economies have per capita gross national income (GNI) of $1,006\u2013$12,235 and lower middle-income \neconomies have per capita GNI of $1,006\u2013$3,955. Mongolia\u2019s poverty rate at $1.90 threshold was 0.22 in 2014, and \nthe per capita GNI was $3,590 in 2016. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fand aimags.4 Travel is costly and uncomfortable. Without access to markets, local farmers and \nherders are forced to sell their products at lower prices. \n \n6. \nMongolia has a road network of 48,538 kilometers (km), of which only 6,406 km (13.2%) \nare paved. Investing in road improvement is particularly important at times of economic difficulty \nas it delivers four benefits: (i) projects create much-needed jobs to support economic recovery; \n(ii) better roads reduce road user travel costs and facilitate access to markets, schools, and health \nfacilities, making residents more productive; (iii) modest spending on road maintenance prevents \ncostlier rehabilitation; and (iv) road safety improvements reduce the social cost of traffic accidents. \n \n7. \nSector  performance.  The  construction,  maintenance,  and  rehabilitation  of  state  roads \nare funded by the state budget, development banks, and international loans and grants. During \n2011\u20132015, MNT1.88 trillion was invested in the upgrade and construction of roads and bridges. \nThese expenditures were regulated by the Mongolian Road Law, 1998 and funded by the State \nRoad Fund.5 However, insufficient funds were collected as taxes were often reduced or canceled \nto keep fuel prices under control amid fuel price increases in the Russian Federation, on which \nMongolia depends for much of its fuel. \n\n \n8. \nWhile  investment  in  new  road  construction  has  grown,  it  has  not  been  matched  by \ncommensurate  increases  in  road  maintenance  and  rehabilitation.  The  state  budget  provides \nseparate annual allocations for routine maintenance and rehabilitation, but the government has \nnot  funded  any  major  maintenance  or  rehabilitation  projects  in  2011\u20132015,  and  the  amount \nallocated to the Ministry of Road and Transport Development (MRTD) for routine maintenance \nhas been constrained to only 15% of estimated needs. Consequently, road maintenance has been \ninsufficient,  and  the  condition  of  the  existing  road  network  has  deteriorated,  making  transport \ncosts expensive and Mongolia\u2019s exports uncompetitive.  \n \n9. \nAsset  management.  The  country  urgently  needs  to  improve  its  RAM.  A  previously \nimplemented RAM system is no longer used because of limited funding. Timely road maintenance \nis less costly than allowing roads to deteriorate and need major rehabilitation or reconstruction\u2014\nsaving  money  in  tight  fiscal  situations.  This  requires  capacity  development  and  institutional \nstrengthening, significant investment in a periodic maintenance and rehabilitation program, and \nstronger  enforcement  of  vehicle  weight  restrictions  to  prevent  costly  road  damage  from \noverloading. \n  \n10. \nTo  improve  accessibility  and  optimize  government  spending,  ADB  has  conducted \nextended dialogue with the government since 2009 through TA to prepare and implement a sector \nroad  map  and  capacity  development  strategy,  including  the  provision  of  a  RAM  system.6  TA \nactivities  helped  the  government  prioritize  work  for  a  periodic  maintenance  and  rehabilitation \nprogram. Major lessons from this work included the need for predictable funding and systematic \nasset management practices. \n  \n                                                \n4  Provincial administrative unit in Mongolia. \n5  The road fund was established through a 1991 government decree to help stabilize the funding available to the road \nsector. In 1998, the Road Law distinguished between the state road fund and local road funds. Further information \non  fund  revenue  and  spending  is  provided  in  Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Transport;  and  Financial  Analysis \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n6  ADB.  2009.  Technical  Assistance  to  Mongolia  for  Road  Database  Development  Using  Geographic  Information \nSystem.  Manila;  and  ADB.  Mongolia:  Preparation  of  a  National  Road  Sector  Capacity  Development  Roadmap. \nhttps://www.adb.org/projects/44303-012/main (the Government of Mongolia approved the road map on 24 August \n2011); and ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance to Mongolia for Road Sector Capacity Development. Manila ($2 million \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction). \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fPartly as an outcome of ADB policy dialogue, the government passed the Mongolian Road \n11. \nLaw Amendment, 2017, which ensures that at least 20% of revenues from the vehicle excise tax \nare  allocated  to  road  maintenance.  This  would  add  about  MNT7 billion  to  the  road  fund  each \nyear.7 Significantly higher fines and penalties, including for truck overloading, will also go into the \nroad  fund.  Unlike  in  the  past,  the  fund  is  only  for  road  maintenance  and  not  for  new  road \nconstruction. The amendment is an important policy change that the project will support. \n \n12. \nRoad safety. Lack of road maintenance amid rapidly increasing passenger car ownership \nhas  an  immediate  impact  on  road  safety  and  the  social  cost  of  traffic  fatalities  and  injuries. \nMongolia has a relatively high road traffic death rate of 21.0 per 100,000 population annually while \nthe global rate is 17.4 and the rate for middle-income economies is 18.4.8 Under the Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) program, ADB has supported the development of a \nroad safety strategy that aims to reduce fatalities on CAREC corridors by 50% by 2030, against \n2010 levels.9 ADB also assists the government in developing a national road safety policy and \naction plan covering three road safety elements: (i) culture and behavior; (ii) engineering, both in \ndesign  and maintenance,  including  winter  activities such  as  snow  control  and  deicing;  and (iii) \neducation, including traffic safety awareness, driving skills, and traffic rules.10 The project will help \nMongolia implement the action plan by adopting international best practices. \n \n13. \nValue added by ADB assistance. Previous TA (footnote 6) laid a foundation to support \nbetter planning and prioritization of asset management and to improve road maintenance funding \nas introduced in the Mongolian Road Law Amendment, 2017. The project will help the government \nimplement its maintenance program through enhancement of law implementation procedures and \nadoption  of  an  improved  RAM  system.  It  will  also  introduce  climbing  lanes  at  traffic  accident \nblackspots to avoid fatal head-on collisions. The attached TA will provide government agencies \nwith extensive training on RAM and road safety improvement. The project will provide institutional \nstrengthening  to  (i) ensure  maintenance  financing  and  prioritization,  (ii)  increase  the  efficiency \nand  capacity  of  road  maintenance  companies,  and  (iii)  introduce  performance-based  road \nmaintenance  schemes.  It  will  integrate  road  safety  design  and  new  maintenance technologies \nand will address vehicle overloading. \n \n14. \nLink  to  country  partnership  and  government  strategies.  The  project  is  well  aligned \nwith Mongolia\u2019s national action plan, 2016\u20132020,11 as it will take measures to strengthen and raise \nthe quality of road maintenance and gradually increase maintenance funding. It is consistent with \nADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2017\u20132020  for  Mongolia,  which  indicates  improvement  of \nphysical connectivity as a priority activity under the second pillar of the strategy (footnote 2). The \nproject  will  reduce  transport  and  logistics  cost  on  CAREC  Corridor  4b,  enhancing  the \ncompetitiveness of Mongolia\u2019s non-mining exports. \n \n\n                                                \n7  The  State  Great  Hural  (Parliament)  of  Mongolia.  http://www.parliament.mn/n/xroy.  The  law  also  provides  for  an \n\nincrease in vehicle excise tax rates by 5% to 15%, depending on engine size and vehicle age. \n\n8  World Health Organization. 2015.

This  output  will  strengthen \nsustainable road maintenance practices and build capacity for the implementation of maintenance \nprojects  prepared  and  procured  during  the  project.  Capacity-building  activities  will  include \n(i) reestablishing  and  providing training  on the RAM  system to improve maintenance planning, \nimplementation,  and  prioritization;14  (ii)  designing  improvements  in  road  funding  to  ensure  the \nsustainability of maintenance activities, including measures to prevent vehicle overloading; and \n(iii) supporting pilot performance-based maintenance. This output will be delivered partly through \nattached TA and partly with output 2. \n \n17. \nOutput 2: Road condition improved. This output will preserve and improve important \nregional road sections that link the PRC and the Russian Federation through Mongolia\u2019s capital \nand comprises part of CAREC Corridor 4b. The project will improve 311 km of existing national \nhighway sections comprising Ulaanbaatar\u2013Darkhan (193 km) and Darkhan\u2013Altanbulag (118 km). \nImprovement  works  will  include  (i)  pavement  treatment  and  (ii)  widening  of  carriageways  and \nshoulders within the existing right-of-way (ROW). \n \n18. \nOutput 3: Road safety improved. This output will provide capacity development in road \nsafety policies and the implementation of safety features in the road condition improvement works \nundertaken with output 2. Safety features will include improvements in road markings, barriers, \nand guide posts. Climbing lanes will be constructed within the ROW at traffic accident blackspots, \nwhere overtaking of slow-moving vehicles often causes fatal head-on collisions. Independent road \nsafety audits will be conducted on detailed designs, as well as a post-construction audit. \n \nD. \n \n19. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $60.6  million  (Table  1).  Detailed  cost  estimates  by \nexpenditure category and by financier are included in the project administration manual (PAM).15 \n \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n                                                \n12 This project-related impact statement aligns with the Mongolian national action plan\u2019s strategy to develop a road, \ntransportation, and logistical network that sustains economic growth, is consistent with social needs and demands, \nand provides safe and comfortable services (footnote 11). \n\n13 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n14 A team of experts under the attached TA will assess the use of equipment and planning tools provided in 2010 under \nADB.  2009.

The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period \nof 8 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year  (the  interest  and \nother  charges  during  construction  to  be  capitalized  in  the  loan);  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the straight-line method, the average \nmaturity is 16.75 years, and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.20% per year. \n \n21. \nThe borrower, the Government of Mongolia, will help finance the project and will assume \nthe foreign exchange and interest variation risks of the ADB loan.  ADB will finance 99% of the \nproject  cost,  including  the  expenditures  in  relation  to  works  and  consulting  services.  The \ngovernment will finance $0.6 million for project implementation.

The government will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of office accommodation, support facilities, counterpart staff, reports, and other \nlogistical support through in-kind contributions. ADB will engage an international consulting firm \nand a national individual consultant following the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or staff instructions. \nIt will use the 90:10 quality- and cost-based selection method because of the highly specialized \nknowledge required for the assignment. \n\n                                                \n17 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\ntasked \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \nThe assessment determined rehabilitation and maintenance needs, including constructing \n26. \nclimbing lanes and widening carriageways and shoulders to the Mongolian Class I-G standard to \nincrease  road  capacity  and  safety.18  The  project  components  are  expected  to  improve  the \nconditions  of  the  road  from  Ulaanbaatar  to  Altanbulag  (the  sections  with  some  of  the  highest \ntraffic), which would bring CAREC Corridor 4b back to adequate technical standards and increase \ncapacity and safety levels at critical sections. \n \n27. \nAs part of the capacity-building activities, the project will review road fund mechanisms \nand develop suggestions to improve the State Road Fund\u2019s management, revenue sources, and \nfund allocation control. The result should bring the road fund to a level that permits ongoing routine \nand periodic maintenance. The project will also reestablish and repopulate the RAM system and \ntrain a dedicated RAM operations unit. The ongoing use of the RAM system must be supported \nby adequate funding levels. \n \nThe lack of routine and periodic maintenance funding constrained the operations of the \n28. \n20 state-owned  and  eight  private  maintenance  companies \nto  perform  routine \nmaintenance. Domestic construction companies also suffered in 2012\u20132017 because of limited \nfunding. Foreign contractors won most construction projects during the period because they are \nmore  efficient  and  local  contractors  have  difficulty  in  meeting  qualification  criteria.  Domestic \ncontractors tend not to participate in joint ventures, which would allow them to be more competitive \nwith foreign firms. While some consolidation could result in increased efficiencies, it is premature \nin the current fiscal environment. \n \n29. \nFull introduction of standard performance-based contracts is not appropriate in the current \nsituation because the sector lacks the experience and the capacity to serve longer-term service \ncommitments. However, a form of performance-based contract will be pilot tested in civil works \ncontracts by adding an extended defect liability period of 3 years, with the contractor responsible \nfor the road section for a 5-year period. \n \nB. \n \n30. \nThe project is economically viable, with an estimated economic internal rate of return of \n60.7%  for  all  the  sections  combined.  The  project\u2019s  economic  benefits  include  increased  road \nsafety  and  savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs  and  time.  The  project  will  also  generate \nunquantifiable benefits related  to  improved  accessibility.  A  sensitivity  analysis  of  potential  cost \noverruns and benefit reductions demonstrates that the project\u2019s economic viability is robust.19 \n \n31. \nGiven the country\u2019s current economic difficulties and possible restriction on government \nspending, counterpart funding is limited to 1% of the total project cost. The project has no revenue-\ngenerating  components.  It  is  financially  sustainable  based  on  the  assessment  of  the  project\u2019s \nfiscal impact on the MRTD\u2019s projected budget. While MRTD\u2019s financial capacity is very limited, \nthe  Mongolian  Road  Law  Amendment,  2017  should  result  in  a  gradually  increasing  and  more \nstable funding source for road maintenance. Improved RAM, including implementing adequate \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n                                                \n18 The Mongolian Class I-G standard requires a two-lane carriageway with each lane 3.5-meter wide and an 8.5-meter \n\npavement. \n\n19 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nthe  MRTD  has  experience \n\nmaintenance  funding  mechanisms,  will  be  an  objective  of  the  project\u2019s  capacity  development \noutputs. \n \nC. \n \nThe financial management assessment concluded that the financial management risk is \n32. \nmoderate  before  mitigation  measures.  Although \nin  ADB \nimplementation, the financial management assessment recommended that it should strengthen \nits  financial  management  capacity  by  undertaking  training  on  ADB  financial  management \nguidelines and disbursement requirements, policies, and procedures. The MRTD will also recruit \nnew  financial  management  staff  for  the  project  to  mitigate  implementation,  compliance,  and \nforeign exchange and interest rate risks. Detailed mitigation measures are described in Table 4 \nand in the PAM. \n \n33. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MRTD.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures  are  described  in  the  PAM.  Relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  will  be \nincluded in all procurement documents and contracts. \n \nD. \n \nThe national poverty rate fell from 38.7% in 2010 to 27.4% in 2012 and 21.6% in 2014.20 \n34. \nLack of higher education and unemployment are key issues in rural areas. Out of 102 households \nsurveyed in the rural areas, 58% spend MNT1 million\u2013MNT3 million per year on education. Since \nmost rural areas do not offer higher education, people from these places continue their education \nin urban areas, where they rent rooms because of the lack of good transport. \n \n35. \nProject  beneficiaries,  comprising  about  301,000 residents  at  target  aimags,  will  receive \nimproved, low-cost, and safe transportation. The project will provide better access to markets and \nbasic services such as education and health, reducing annual expenditures and improving the \nquality of life of residents. The strategic location of the project sites, along the border  between \nMongolia and the Russian Federation, offers more opportunities for local development in trade \nand agriculture. The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming following the ADB gender \ncategorization. The gender action plan will ensure equal participation and benefits.21 It requires \nthat  women  comprise  at  least  50%  of  participants  to  community  and  household  consultation \nmeetings on project construction activities. Training on small businesses and income generation \nmethods along the corridor will be conducted with at least 50% women participation. Prevention \nmeasures  in  the  gender  action  plan  will  address  the  likely  impact  from  HIV/AIDS,  sexually \ntransmitted infections, and trafficking that women could face during the construction period.  \n \nE. \n \n36. \ncategories are as follows. \n \n37. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  initial  environmental  examination  complies  with  ADB \npolicies  and  requirements,  including  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.22  It  identifies  potential \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n20 ADB.

Meaningful  public  consultation  was  done  following  the \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement.  The  MRTD  is  committed  to  implementing  the  environmental \nmanagement plan of the project and the project-specific grievance redress mechanism (GRM). \nThe initial climate risk is low. The MRTD will establish a PIU, which will be responsible for carrying \nout the environmental management plan, environmental monitoring and reporting, and GRM of \nthe project. The PIU will have a full-time environmental officer and qualified loan implementation \nenvironmental consultants. The consultants will also provide capacity development training to the \nMRTD, PIU, and project contractors. The initial environmental examination has been prepared \nand posted on the ADB website. \n \n38. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B).  A  due  diligence report  prepared  for  outputs  2 \nand 3 confirmed that the project has no land acquisition or resettlement impacts, as all the related \nworks  are  limited  to  the  existing  ROW.  The  contractor  will  mitigate  all  construction-related \nimpacts. A resettlement framework has been prepared, following the Safeguard Policy Statement \nand national laws and regulations, to guide the preparation of resettlement plans and to ensure \nproject impacts remain within category B or C. The resettlement framework was posted on the \nADB website on 9 June 2017.23 The MRTD is committed to implement the resettlement framework \nand prepare a resettlement plan, when required. The GRM has been agreed with the MRTD and \nis included in the resettlement framework. \n \n39. \nIndigenous peoples (category C). Due diligence found no ethnic minorities affected by \nthe project. The three project aimags do not have any separate ethnic minority as defined by the \nSafeguard Policy Statement. \n \nF. \n \n40. \nThe overall benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs and risks, and the \noverall  risk  after  mitigation  measures  is  low.  Significant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are \nsummarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in  detail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management \nplan.24 The loan agreement contains assurances on operation and maintenance budget provision. \n \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nGovernment faces political and financial \npressures in the adoption of sustainable \nroad maintenance and maintenance \nfunding concepts. \n\nNewly recruited PIU staff with limited \nknowledge of ADB procedures and O&M \nrequirements may lead to implementation \ndelay. \n\nMitigation Measures \nThe MRTD and/or the MOF will provide assurances to increase the \nO&M budget provision, as this is a priority project in the road sector. \n \nADB will continue policy dialogue and long-term engagement of all \ndecision makers in policy reform, including discussions on the \nInternational Monetary Fund\u2019s Extended Fund Facility program. \n \nThe MRTD will ensure that the counterpart funds are available and \nincluded in the state budget. The Government of Mongolia has \nidentified the project as a priority in the road sector, as confirmed by \nthe MOF and the MRTD in a memorandum of understanding with ADB. \nThe MRTD will appoint suitable staff. \n \nADB and consultants will provide institutional development and \ncapacity-building support for O&M-related training on the RAM system \nand will improve maintenance planning, prioritization, and \nimplementation. \n\n                                                \n23 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fMitigation Measures \nThe PIU will use computerized accounting software.
