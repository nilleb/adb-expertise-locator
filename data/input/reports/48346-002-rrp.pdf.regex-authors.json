THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto Solomon Islands for the Solar Power Development Project.1 The report also describes the \nproposed administration or a grant to be provided by the Strategic Climate Fund (SCF),2 and if \nthe Board approves the proposed grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, approve the administration of the SCF grant. \n \n2.  The project will increase renewable energy generation in five of the eight Solomon Island \nprovincial grids: Kirakira, Lata, Malu\u2019u, Munda, and Tulagi. The project will help the country \nreplace diesel generation with solar power hybrid grids including battery storage. This will be the \nfirst solar power project in Solomon Islands supported by battery storage. Following the project, \nsolar power will generate about 78% of the electricity in the five targeted provincial grids. Project \npreparatory technical assistance was used in project preparation.3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The project will support the development of renewable energy in Solomon Islands to (i) \ndecrease the cost of generating electricity by replacing diesel power generation with cheaper \nsolar power and (ii) reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The project will be financed through an \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) grant and an externally financed grant that ADB will administer. \n \n4.  Solomon Islands Electricity Authority (Solomon Power), a state-owned electricity utility, \ngenerates and supplies grid-connected electricity to the national capital (Honiara) and eight \nisolated  provincial  centers  on  separate  islands  (Auki,  Buala,  Gizo,  Kirakira,  Lata,  Malu\u2019u, \nMunda, and Tulagi). Solomon Islands has a population of 512,870, of which 64,609 (13%) live in \nthe capital. Honiara has 34 megawatts (MW) of installed capacity with a peak load of 14 MW; \nthe  combined  installed  generation  capacity  in  the  provincial  centers  is  2.3  MW.  All  grid-\nconnected  power  generation  in  Solomon  Islands  is  diesel-generated,  which  resulted  in  an \naverage national tariff of $0.76/kilowatt-hour (kWh) in January 2016\u2014among the highest in the \nPacific.4 The high cost of electricity generation constrains economic growth, particularly in the \ncommercial and tourism sectors. \n \n5.  The cost of electricity generation in the provincial grids is significantly higher than in \nHoniara, primarily because of high transportation costs for small volumes of diesel and small \neconomies of scale for operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. The costly generation in the \nprovinces is a disincentive for Solomon Power to extend the grid to new customers, as the \nnational tariff does not cover the supply cost in these expensive areas. \n \n6.  Electricity access is low in Solomon Islands. Grid-connected electricity is supplied to \nabout 16% of the population. While the access rate in the Honiara urban area is 64%, access in \nthe remainder of the country is 6%, with five of nine provinces having access rates below 4%. \nSolomon Power is extending the distribution network and establishing renewable energy mini \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Under the Scaling Up Renewable Energy Program (SREP) in Low-Income Countries. \n3  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Solar Power \nDevelopment Project (TA 8756-SOL). \n4  Pacific Power Association. 2015. Performance Benchmarking Report for Pacific Power Utilities. Suva. This report \nindicates that the average domestic tariff across 21 Pacific utilities in 2012 was $0.45/kWh. The tariff allows for full \ncost recovery for Solomon Power\u2019s operations. ", "2 \ngrids  at  village-sized  centers,  partially  supported  by  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Solomon  Islands \nSustainable  Energy  Project. The  project  aims to  convert  the  provincial grids  to  renewable \nenergy.5 Grid-connected solar power has been assessed as the least-cost generation option for \nthe proposed sites. Average annual solar irradiation of 2,000 kWh per square meter at these \nsites constitutes a major renewable source for power generation.  \n \n7.  The project will construct a total of 2 MW of grid-connected solar power at five provincial \ngrids: Kirakira, Lata, Malu\u2019u, Munda, and Tulagi. It will include installation of battery storage to \nallow high penetration rates of intermittent solar power. The levelized cost of solar power (with \nbattery storage) is $0.405/kWh, nearly 20% below the diesel generation cost of $0.501/kWh. \nIncreased solar generation will benefit the economy by reducing fossil fuel imports and putting \ndownward pressure on tariffs. Lower diesel consumption will significantly cut the O&M costs of \ntransshipping diesel to remote centers. The conversion of provincial grids to renewable energy \nwill support sustainable, least-cost growth in provincial centers. The project will significantly \nimprove the quality and reliability of the electricity supply of the five targeted provincial grids, \nimproving the lives of about 7,300 beneficiaries. The use of renewable energy also reduces \ngreenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to global warming. The solar installations will help \nmitigate climate change by reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 840 tons equivalent per year. \n \n8.  Solomon Power will own and operate the solar power plants. To establish the enabling \nenvironment for grid-connected solar power, the project will include training of Solomon Power \nstaff in O&M of these plants.6 Solar power is modular and suitable for scaling up to meet \ngrowing demand. The project design includes oversized sites and grid connection equipment to \nallow for future expansion. \n \n9.  The power sector is prioritized under ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Solomon \nIslands, 2012\u201320167 and the project is included in the country operations business plan, 2016\u2013\n2018.8 The project also supports Solomon Islands National Development Strategy, 2016\u20132035, \nwhich prioritizes renewable energy and increasing electricity access.9 Further, it is in line with \nthe government\u2019s draft National Energy Policy Framework, 2013,10 which promotes renewable \nenergy expansion to reduce reliance on diesel generation and expand access to energy. ADB is \nimplementing the Provincial Renewable Energy Project in Solomon Islands. Lessons learned \nthat will be implemented by the current project include (i) the necessity to establish a fully \nstaffed project management unit (PMU) early to minimize delays, (ii) the importance of securing \nland during initial phases of development, and (iii) the importance of provincial governments \nsupport during implementation. \n \n                                                \n5  The remaining three provincial grids are (i) Auki, which is being supported under ADB. 2014.

Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be increased utilization of renewable energy. The outcome will be an \nincreased supply of reliable and cleaner electricity. \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.  The project will have two outputs: \n \n(i)  Five grid-connected solar power plants. The project will construct a total of 2 \nMW  of  grid-connected  solar  power  generation  at  five  provincial  grids.  Solar \npower capacity will be installed at Kirakira (320 kilowatts [kW]), Lata (290 kW), \nMalu\u2019u (140 kW), Munda (1,000 kW), and Tulagi (250 kW). The project will \ninclude the installation of battery storage, which will allow high penetration rates \nof intermittent solar power. Battery storage sizing has been optimized and will \nreplace from 66% to 87% of diesel generation at each site.11 The project will \ninclude innovative technology in remote monitoring and control of the hybrid \nsystems. \n(ii)  Capacity building. A training program will be conducted for Solomon Power \noperators on O&M of small grid-connected solar\u2013diesel hybrid systems. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n12.

The government has requested a grant not exceeding $2.24 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the project. The SCF12 will provide \ngrant cofinancing equivalent to $6.20 million, to be administered by ADB.  From the proceeds of \nthe Asian Development Fund grant and SCF grant, the government will make $8.44 million \navailable as a grant in local currency to Solomon Power. Solomon Islands will finance the \nremaining $6.76 million cost of the project to cover civil works, land acquisition, site preparation, \nand taxes and duties. Since ADB is administering cofinancing resources in the form of grants \nfrom the SCF for operations financed by the Asian Development Fund, universal procurement \nwill apply to all procurement packages under the project.13 The financing plan is in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nSource  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank     \n   Special Funds resources (grant)  2.24  14.7 \nStrategic Climate Fund (grant)a  6.20  40.8 \nGovernmentb  6.76  44.5 \nTotal  15.20  100.0 \na.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  The Ministry of Mines, Energy and Rural Electrification (MMERE) will be the executing \nagency  for  the  project.  Solomon  Power  will  be  the  implementing  agency;  a  PMU  will  be \nestablished within Solomon Power. Solomon Power will provide the following personnel for the \nPMU:  (i)  a  project  engineer,  (ii)  a  finance  officer,  and  (iii)  an  administrative  assistant,  as \nrequired. The project will finance additional consultants and equipment to support the PMU in \nachieving the outputs. A consulting firm will be engaged for support during design finalization, \ntendering, and project supervision, using the quality- and cost-based selection method with a \nquality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10. Two consultants will be hired through individual consultant selection \nto provide up-front procurement support and site supervision support. All consultants will be \nrecruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). The PMU will be responsible for the procurement of all civil works and goods, \nwhich will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended \nfrom time to time). Solomon Islands has requested that ADB select the design and supervision \nconsultants on its behalf. The government and the selected consultant will sign the contract. \nAdditional financing for more sites may be considered if the project is performing well, and any \nadditional project preparation financing that is required (in areas such as design, safeguards, \nand capacity) will be sourced from the additional financing.14 A project steering committee will \noversee implementation, monitor progress, and provide guidance to the executing agency. The \n                                                \n12 The government received clearance from the SREP subcommittee to proceed with the project preparation on the \nbasis of $6.2 million grant availability from SREP. The grant may finance local transportation and insurance costs. \n13 ADB. 2013.

The project will be implemented over 4 years with completion estimated by December \n2020.  To  expedite  implementation,  the  government  has  requested  advance  consultant \nrecruitment,  advance  procurement,  and  retroactive  financing.  ADB  has  informed  the \ngovernment  that  approval  of  advance  consultant  recruitment,  advance  procurement,  and \nretroactive  financing  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the  project.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n16.  The five solar\u2013diesel hybrid systems have been assessed as technically viable. The \nproject  will  construct  solar  photovoltaic  power  plants  with  specialized  batteries  for  energy \nstorage,  which  is  considered  the  least-cost  technology  in  view  of  the  available  renewable \nresources, necessary capital and operational costs, power output stability, and environmental \nimpacts.16 Modeling has optimized the battery storage sizing and solar integration levels based \non site-specific data. The system design has been analyzed considering the assessed solar \nirradiation,  load  demand  curve,  grid  conditions,  hard  marine  environments,  and  extreme \nweather  events  such  as  cyclones.  The  solar\u2013diesel  hybrid  systems  will  include  remote  \nmonitoring  and  protection  systems  to  stabilize  the  grid  in  line  with  international  design \nstandards. The PMU and the engineering, procurement, and construction engineers will provide \nO&M training to Solomon Power to support sustainable operation. \n \n17.  Climate change. The project has been classified high risk for climate change impact. A \nclimate risk vulnerability assessment has been prepared. The major risks to the project from \nclimate change are (i) an increase in cyclones, (ii) sea level rise at some sites, and (iii) a change \nin solar radiation. Climate change impacts have been accounted for in the project design. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n18.  Economic. The project is economically feasible with the economic internal rate of return \nestimated at 17.9%, which is higher than the economic opportunity cost of capital of 12.0% \nrecommended in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.17 The economic \ninternal rates of return for individual sites are as follows: Kirakira, 20.4%; Lata, 15.8%; Malu\u2019u, \n13.7%; Munda, 24.7%; and Tulagi, 15.8%. The economic benefits of the project are derived \nfrom (i) savings in diesel consumption, (ii) reduced O&M costs for solar power generation \ncompared with diesel generation, and (iii) environmental improvements from reduced emissions \nfrom diesel power generation. A sensitivity analysis was undertaken to gauge the impact of \nunfavorable changes in variables on the net benefits, and to test the robustness of the project\u2019s \nviability. While the overall project is not sensitive to unfavorable changes in the expected costs \nand benefits, the viability of the Malu\u2019u site is vulnerable to a 20% capital cost increase, a 20% \nbenefit decrease, or a 1-year delay in operation. Sensitivity tests for other subprojects do not \nshow similar vulnerabilities. \n \n19.  Financial. The project is financially viable with the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) \nestimated at 10.0%, which is higher than the (real) weighted average cost of capital of 5.8%. \nThe net present value is estimated at $6.2 million. The FIRRs for individual sites are as follows: \nKirakira, 13.1%; Lata, 8.9%; Malu\u2019u, 5.4%; Munda, 12.7%; and Tulagi, 6.5%.  A sensitivity \nanalysis  was conducted to account for potential increases in financial costs, as well as a \nreduction of financial benefits. The project is robust as the FIRR exceeds the weighted average \ncost of capital with a 20% increase in costs and a 20% decrease in revenues, as well as with a \ncombined 20% increase in costs and 20% decrease in revenues. \n \n                                                \n16 The feasibility design includes lead-acid batteries. However, contractors will propose optimum solutions. \n17 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "7 \nC.  Governance \n20.  Financial management. A financial management assessment (FMA) was prepared for \nSolomon Power, which indicated the overall financial management risk is low.18 An earlier FMA \nwas completed in 2014 during the preparation of the Provincial Renewable Energy Project. The \nFMA  for  the  current  project  reviewed  progress  toward  the  issues  identified  in  2014  and \nassessed any additional issues. Inadequacies noted in 2014 have largely been addressed, \nincluding improvements in the use of financial management software and enhancements to \ninternal  audit  procedures.  While  Solomon  Power\u2019s  financial  management  has  improved \nsignificantly since 2014, it still has limited experience in managing fund flows for infrastructure \nprojects financed by multilateral development banks, as well as limited human resource capacity \nin its finance department. An international financial specialist will assist Solomon Power with \nfund flow procedures and train Solomon Power staff on ADB procedures. \n \n21.  Procurement capacity. Procurement at Solomon Power is governed by its Procurement \nPolicies & Procedures Manual, revised on 29 January 2016, which is generally aligned with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. ADB conducted a procurement capacity assessment, which \nfound that Solomon Power has an established procurement unit with considerable experience in \nprocuring routine goods and minor projects. However, Solomon Power has limited experience in \nmanaging  larger  engineering,  procurement,  and  construction  packages\u2014or  with  ADB \nprocurement  systems.  To  address  these  capacity  constraints,  the  project  will  include  an \ninternational procurement specialist to (i) train Solomon Power staff in procurement processes \nfor preparation and management of larger contracts following ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines, \nparticularly engineer\u2013procure\u2013construct contracts; (ii) manage the preparation of standard ADB \nbidding documents; and (iii) provide international expertise to support construction supervision. \nIn addition, ADB will provide targeted procurement training and support during procurement.19 \n \n22.  Anticorruption measures. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and  Solomon Power. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n23.  The project will benefit the poor from improved reliability of the power supply to schools \nand clinics, which will raise the quality of essential services. Electricity tariff reduction is also \nexpected that will eventually reduce household expenditure on energy services. In addition, the \nproject will reduce the impact of diesel generator noise and pollution on adjacent communities, \nand generate a limited number of jobs for local communities during implementation. The project \nis classified as a general intervention. While it does not address poverty directly, the project is \nexpected to indirectly improve well-being and expand opportunities for livelihoods. The project \nwill comply with applicable national labor laws and core labor standards, including equal pay for \nequal work regardless of gender, race, or ethnicity; and prohibiting child labor. The PMU will \nimplement the poverty reduction measures. \n \n24.  The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. A gender action plan, \ndeveloped based on a gender analysis and community consultations, includes measures related \nto the construction of the solar power plants such as (i) women\u2019s engagement in consultation \n                                                \n18 In accordance with ADB. 2005.

Safeguards \n25.  Environment. The project has been classified category B for the environment following \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). An initial environmental examination was prepared \nand disclosed on the ADB website. The potential environmental impacts during construction are \nmainly vegetation clearance, soil erosion, and waste disposal at some sites. The main potential \nimpacts  during  operation  are  noise  from  backup  diesel  generators  and  waste  disposal \n(batteries).20 The initial environmental examination and the environmental management plan will \nbe included in the bidding documents. If the scope of the works changes, the PMU will compile \nan  updated  initial  environmental  examination  and  environmental  management  plan  to  be \napproved by ADB. As part of the assessment, a climate change adaptation risk evaluation was \nconducted and considered in the project design. An environment specialist will support the \nPMU. \n \n26.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The project has been classified \ncategory B for resettlement and category C for indigenous peoples following ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement.  The  project  will  have  land  acquisition  impacts  that  are  not  considered \nsignificant.  No  physical  relocation  of  persons  or  loss  of  income  is  expected  from  the \nimplementation of the project. The project will need to acquire about 5.7 hectares of leasehold \ntitle land held by other government departments and state-owned enterprises.21 The project will \nnot need to acquire any land from customary landowners. No long-term impacts are expected \nas the construction and operation will not restrict the community from accessing and using \nnearby resources. Adverse impacts such as the loss of trees or crops being farmed on the state \nland, or exposure to potential health hazards because of the entry of noncommunity workers, \nare likely to be minor. A draft resettlement plan has been prepared. Communities adjacent to \nthe project sites will be consulted during implementation. Information, such as a brochure in the \nlocal  language,  has  been  disseminated  to  adjacent  communities  and  local  stakeholders. \nSolomon Power has endorsed the resettlement plan, which was disclosed on the ADB website.  \n \n27.  Solomon Power will finalize the resettlement plan after approving the detailed design \nfrom the contractor and will ensure the land title has been transferred to Solomon Power before \nthe start of civil works. The project will help strengthen Solomon Power\u2019s social safeguard \ncapacity, including recruiting a social safeguard specialist to assist with project implementation.  \nThe due diligence concluded that, while clans live in the project areas, their institutions are not \nseparate from mainstream society and these groups are not vulnerable. As the project has been \ncategorized as C, an indigenous peoples plan is not required. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n28.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.22 The  risks  of  the  project  have  been \nassessed and the benefits are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n                                                \n20 The environmental management plan stipulates the requirements for appropriate disposal of batteries. \n21 No land was purchased in anticipation of ADB funding. \n22 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nPublic financial management: Insufficient financial  Project monitoring, and separate project records \nmanagement capacity within Solomon Power  and accounts will be maintained; imprest accounts \nwill not be used; and an international financial \nspecialist will be recruited to assist the PMU. \nProcurement: Recruitment of design and  Recruitment of DSC has been delegated to ADB. \nsupervision consultants (DSC) delayed \nProcurement: Insufficient procurement capacity in  An international procurement specialist will support \nthe PMU to manage ADB procurement procedures  the PMU and train staff on ADB procedures. \nProcurement: Low capacity of local contractors  Bidding documents will require (i) evidence of \nresults in poor-quality installations  commitments, and (ii) demonstrated experience in \ncontracts of similar size. \nTechnical: Proposed technology is new to Solomon  Solomon Power staff will undertake training in \nPower, which may not have technical skills to  operation and maintenance of solar hybrid grids. \noperate and maintain the systems \nTechnical: Major customers disconnect from grid  Improved consultations with key major customers. \nand self-generate. \nCapacity: Staffing of the PMU is not sufficient to  The PMU will be adequately staffed, and ADB will \nmanage project implementation adequately  review the project twice a year to monitor \nimplementation.
