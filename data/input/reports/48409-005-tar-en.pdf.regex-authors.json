THE ONGOING PROJECT \n \n1.  The Myanmar:  Climate-Friendly  Agribusiness  Value  Chains (CFAVC) Sector  Project \nsupports fulfilling the government\u2019s Agriculture Development Strategy for 2018\u20132023 and the \nNational Export Strategy for 2015-2019 by boosting competitiveness in value chains for rice, \nbeans, pulses, and oilseeds in the Magway, Mandalay, and Sagaing regions in the central dry \nzone (CDZ). The Project increases climate resilience for critical rural infrastructure, promotes \nquality and safety testing capacity, strengthens technical and institutional capacity for climate-\nsmart  agriculture  (CSA),  and  creates  an  enabling  policy  environment  for  climate-friendly \nagribusinesses. The Project, which is executed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and \nIrrigation (MOALI), has the following Outputs: \n \ni)  Output  1:  Critical  agribusiness  value  chain  infrastructure improved  and  made \nclimate-resilient. Key activities include (i) upgrading infrastructure (irrigation, farm roads, \nbuildings,  farm  machinery,  post-harvest  equipment,  seed  testing  equipment,  and \nagrometeorological  stations)  in  10  Department  of  Agriculture  (DOA)  seed  farms  for \nproducing  improved  climate-resilient  seed  of  rice,  beans,  pulses,  and  oilseeds;  (ii) \nrehabilitating tertiary canals and community reservoirs, and constructing shallow tube \nwells (with some linked to drip and sprinkler technologies) to bring an 13,000 hectares \nunder irrigation for up to 35,000 households; (iii) rehabilitating farm roads for improved \nconnectivity to markets and farm mechanization; and (iv) upgrading safety and quality \ntesting equipment in public regulatory laboratories and providing rapid food safety testing \nkits to DOA and the private sector. \n \nii)  Output  2:  Climate-smart  agriculture  and  agribusiness  promoted.  Key  activities \ninclude (i) deploying climate-resilient varieties of rice, beans, pulses, and oilseeds; (ii) \nstrengthening capacity of seed growers, agri-dealers, and government staff regarding \ngood  agriculture  practices  (GAP),  CSA,  certified  seed  production,  and  farm \nmechanization,  and  of  agribusinesses  regarding  business  plan  development,  good \nmanufacturing practices, value addition, and improvement of food quality and safety; and \n(iii)  facilitating  access  to  inputs  (seeds,  quality  agrochemicals),  farm  mechanization \nservices, and off-farm rural livelihood opportunities by establishing an agricultural digital \nfinance service for at least 35,000 smallholders. \n \niii)  Output 3: Enabling environment for climate-friendly agribusiness enhanced. Key \nactivities include (i) establishing an agribusiness policy cell within MOALI\u2019s Department of \nPlanning for research and policy advice; (ii) raising awareness and capacity of financial \ninstitutions to support climate-friendly agribusinesses; (iii) enhancing weather, market, and \ncredit information networks; and (iv) improving delivery of land administration services in \ntownships by building capacity in participatory land management. \n \n2.  The $64.92 million CFAVC Project is supported by $40.50 million of concessional ordinary \ncapital resources lending from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), a $22.00 million grant from \nthe Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP), $1.43 million from the government, \nand $0.99 million from project beneficiaries. The Project is complemented by $5.00 million of \nGAFSP funded technical assistance administered by the Food and Agriculture Organization of \nthe United Nations for extension of farm technologies/practices, promotion of nutrition behavioral \nchange; and capacity building for monitoring and process evaluation. The Project was approved \nby the ADB Board of Directors on 9 October 2018, and loan and grant agreements were signed \non 6 November 2018. \n ", "2 \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  Although Myanmar is heavily dependent on agriculture, there is little empirical evidence \navailable on the effectiveness of agricultural interventions in the country.  Official agricultural \nstatistics, even on primary agricultural products, such as rice, differ strongly from independent \nexternal estimates, and microdata on agriculture are limited1.  The studies available on agricultural \nproduction  patterns  and  practices  generally focus  on  favorable  environments,  such  as the \nAyerwaddy  delta,  so  that  knowledge  gaps  are  particularly  pronounced  on  less  favorable \nenvironments, such as the CDZ.  In 2017, the first modern household agricultural survey was \nconducted in the CDZ, but it also has important limitations for use in causal analysis2. This creates \nconsiderable uncertainty about the most appropriate agricultural interventions to promote. \n \n4.  More  broadly,  Myanmar  has  limited  exposure  to  modern  tools  for  evidence-based \npolicymaking, such as impact evaluation studies and randomized controlled trials3.  To date, no \nrandomized controlled trial has been published for interventions in the country outside of the \nhealth sector4. This means that introduction of modern \u201cgold standard\u201d evaluation tools has \nconsiderable potential to help reform how policies are conceived and evaluated.  \n \n5.  The proposed technical assistance 5(TA) will embed a rigorous randomized controlled trial \napproach to impact evaluation within the CFAVC Project, so as to establish an empirical basis for \nlearning and Project improvement over time.  More specifically, it will involve identifying up to four \nkey priority interventions for testing within the CFAVC Project.  Those interventions will be those \nfor which the CFAVC Project Management Unit and other key stakeholders have greatest need \nfor information about effects and assumptions and for which established understanding is most \nlimited.  The TA will define a pipeline randomization6 approach to the sequencing of those \ninterventions, so as to allow rigorous quantification of their effects.  To provide data for analysis, \nsurveys of at least 5,000 households in at least 240 villages will be conducted at baseline, midline \nand CFAVC Project completion, complemented by village surveys.  In addition to providing \nevidence on the effects of interventions on outcomes of interest, the collected data will be utilized \nto diagnose target agricultural systems and constraints, so as to better inform CFAVC Project \nimplementation. Impact evaluation is a specialized field of applied research, and the CFAVC \nProject  Executing  Agency  (MOALI)  has  little  experience  in  this  area.    For  this  reason, \n \n1 Raitzer, D, L.C.Y. Wong, and J. Samson. 2015.  Myanmar's Agriculture Sector: Unlocking the Potential for Inclusive \nGrowth. Asian Development Bank Economics Working Paper Series No. 470.  \n2 In 2017, the Rural Economy and Agriculture in the Dry Zone (READZ) survey of 958 crop producing households was \nundertaken in 4 townships under U.S. Agency for International Development and Livelihood Improvement and Food \nSecurity Trust Fund support.  The survey offers important descriptive information about production situations, but as \na single cross-section in a relatively concentrated area, in which sampling was not designed with respect to variation \nin exposure to any specific intervention, does not offer much potential for causal analysis. \n3 Randomized controlled trials, when implemented correctly, allow for unbiased estimation of intervention effects.  They \ninvolve introducing randomized variation in the sequencing or placement of interventions, so that effects can be \nestimated in a similar manner to experiments in the natural sciences.  They are increasingly used in both the private \nand public sector to understand and compare intervention effectiveness. \n4 Based on a search of the impact evaluation repository of the International Initiative on Impact Evaluation (3ie): \nhttp://www.3ieimpact.org/en/evidence/impact-evaluations/impact-evaluation-repository/  \n5 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 13 December 2018. \n6 Pipeline randomization draws on the fact that projects usually do not have capacity to provide interventions to all \neligible populations immediately.  The approach randomizes which units (villages and households) receive specific \ninterventions first, with those that receive interventions later serving as a control population initially. \n ", "3 \nadministration of impact evaluation on the CFAVC Project is most appropriately handled by the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) under TA. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n6.  The TA is structured into four Outputs, which will be based on background research, \nfollowed by three rounds of field surveys. The Outputs will be delivered sequentially. \n \n7.  Output 1: Project Theory of Change and Evaluation Design Refined.  After consulting \nextensively with CFAVC Project stakeholders and relevant development partners, the TA will \nprovide a clarified, detailed theory of change for the CFAVC Project within which key impact \nchannels and associated assumptions will be identified.  Those assumptions will be further \nreviewed against available evidence from Southeast and South Asia and will be discussed in a \nconsultation workshop to identify key interventions for evaluation. The tentative expectation is that \nevaluated interventions will include irrigation, digital finance, agricultural advisory services, and \ntargeted nutrition interventions, but this focus is subject to further investigation and discussions.  \nFor focal interventions, an appropriate and feasible impact evaluation design will be agreed with \nthe  CFAVC  Project  Management  Unit  (within  MOALI),  ADB,  and  GAFSP,  along  with  an \nassociated data collection strategy.   \n \n8.  Output 2: Project Target Population Characteristics Analyzed. Once a data collection \nstrategy is agreed, a baseline survey will be conducted via computer assisted personal interviews \nby a team of field enumerators in 2019.  This baseline survey will provide data on household \ndemographics and employment, living standards and income, gender relations, assets, access to \nservices, facility  presence,  social  capital, vulnerability  and  coping  strategies,  nutrition,  land \nendowments (including GPS demarcation), cultivation practices, marketing, livestock, value chain \nintegration, and other own-account production.  The data will be analyzed in a report that both \ndocuments data collection and provides information needed by the CFAVC Project to help inform \nimplementation.    \n \n9.  Output 3: Shorter-Term Impacts7 Evaluated.  Villages and households surveyed in \n2019 will be revisited in 2021 during the midline survey. Based on these data, estimates of the \nshort run effects of interventions of interest on a range of indices will be estimated, including land \nuse, agricultural production, agricultural marketing, income, poverty, consumption, food security, \ndecision making, and psychometric and social capital indices.  Estimates of effects on individual \nhousehold members will be disaggregated by gender.  These short run indices will be used to \nhelp refine assumptions and priorities for the second half of CFAVC Project implementation and \nwill inform the CFAVC Project mid-term review.  \n \n10.  Output 4: Longer-Term Impacts Evaluated. Based on data from the end line survey in \n2023, midline survey, and baseline survey, estimates of the long-term of interventions of interest \non a range of indices will be estimated, including land use, agricultural production, agricultural \nmarketing, income, poverty, consumption, food security, decision making, and psychometric and \nsocial capital indices. Any additional indices that are identified as of interest during CFAVC Project \nimplementation will also be included.  Estimates of effects on individual household members will \nbe disaggregated by gender. These long run indices will inform the CFAVC Project Completion \n \n7 \u201cImpact\u201d here refers to causal effects, as used in impact evaluation literature, which may pertain to any type of variable \naffected by the intervention of interest.  This differs from the definition of \u201cimpacts\u201d used in logical frameworks, such \nas ADB\u2019s Design and Monitoring Framework, which pertain to end goals of a project, program, or policy. \n ", "4 \nReport  and  will  be  used  to  help  refine  assumptions  and  priorities  for  potential  project(s) \nimplemented after the CFAVC Project is completed. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,194,937, of which (i) $200,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6) and (ii) $994,937 will be financed \non a grant basis by GAFSP and administered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 1. \n  \n12.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of staff time for participation \nin workshops and coordination to ensure implementation of any agreed random assignment of \ninterventions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB,  through  the  Economic  Research  and  Regional  Cooperation  Department,  will \nadminister the TA and will select, supervise and evaluate consultants. The implementation \narrangements are summarized in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  February 2019 \u2013 February 2024 \nExecuting agency  Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Irrigation \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nFirm: Single Source  International  $994,937 \nSelection  consultants (67.6 \nperson-months) \n \nNational \nconsultants (42.0 \nperson-months)  \nIndividual consultant  National  $80,000 \nselection  consultants (24.0 \nperson-months) \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time \nto time).

The TA will use single source selection for contracting of Innovations for Poverty Action \n(IPA) to conduct the study under GAFSP cofinancing. As noted earlier in this Report, there is little \nexperience with impact evaluation in Myanmar, and, as far as ADB is aware, there are no other \nagencies/firms implementing large randomized controlled trials in the country outside of the health \n \n8  Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \nsector9.  IPA is the only international nongovernmental organization dedicated to randomized \nimpact evaluation with presence in the country, and country presence will be essential to ensure \nthat randomized assignment is continually understood and implemented.  With a global portfolio \nof over 300 ongoing randomized controlled trials, the organization is uniquely experienced for this \ntask. IPA will be contracted for a team of 6 international consultants (67.6 person months) and 2 \nnational consultants (42.0 person months) intermittently over a period of 60 months. \n \n16.  Funds  from  TASF-6  will  be  used  for  supplemental  individual  consultant  selection, \nconsisting of three national consultants (24.0 person months), recruited on an intermittent basis \n(over a period of 60 months). Workshops will be organized at key stages of the TA. All consultant \nand firm contracts will be output based contracts.  Equipment, training, workshops and surveys \nwill be procured or organized by ADB or by the consultants in accordance with ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Staff Instructions on ADB Administered \nConsulting  Services  and/or  Staff  Instructions  on  Procurement  of  Goods,  Works  and \nNonconsulting Services. \n \n17.  Cofinancier requirements. GAFSP requires a brief annual update on expenditure and \nprogress to be communicated as part of reporting on the overall grant cofinancing. \n \nIII.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $994,937 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program, and (ii) ADB \nproviding the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $200,000 on a grant basis to The Republic \nof the Union of Myanmar for Impact Evaluation of the Climate-Friendly Agribusiness Value Chains \nSector Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n9 For example, the Registry for International Development Impact Evaluations (http://ridie.3ieimpact.org) has no entries \nfor other agencies in Myanmar.  \n ", "Appendix 1  6 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2019000) \n \nItem  Amount \nA.
