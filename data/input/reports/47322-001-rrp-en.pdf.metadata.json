The  programmatic  approach,  with  one  subprogram  each  in \n2017 and 2018, will build on current government-led reforms supported by a multi-partner policy \naction matrix.2 The  improved  (i)  management  of public  finances,  assets, and liabilities;  and  (ii) \neconomic  environment  for  the  private  sector  align  with  the  Kiribati  Development  Plan  (KDP), \n2016\u20132019 and the Kiribati Economic Reform Program (KERP).3 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nDevelopment  challenges.  One  of  the  most  remote  and  geographically  dispersed \ncountries in the world, Kiribati has 33 islands spread over 5 million square kilometers of ocean, \nan area larger than India. Its major export commodities are copra and fish. The capital, Tarawa, \nis about 4,000 kilometers from the major trade markets of Australia, Hawaii, and New Zealand. \nThe population of about 116,000 people lives on 20 coral atolls and a single volcanic island with \na land area of less than 800 square kilometers. Kiribati\u2019s low-lying atolls rise little more than 1.8 \nmeters above sea level on average and are therefore at the forefront of climate change. About \n50,000 people live on Tarawa, which has a land area of 16 square kilometers, while the islet of \nBetio is as densely populated as Manila or Jakarta. This extreme remoteness and large dispersion \ncreate significant service delivery challenges. \n \n4. \nKiribati  is  vulnerable  to external  shocks  because  of  its  geographic  characteristics;  high \nexposure  to  the  negative  effects  of  climate  change,  including  rising  sea  levels;  high  import \ndependency; and heavy reliance on income from external sources such as investment income \nfrom its sovereign wealth fund, the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF). Private sector \ndevelopment  has  been  constrained  by  high  business,  investment,  and  connectivity  costs.  The \npublic sector plays a dominant role in the economy, crowding out private sector activities through \nstate-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  that  operate  in  potentially  competitive  sectors. 4  Without \nindependent  monetary  and  exchange rate  policies, given  the  adoption of the  Australian  dollar, \nand the limited leverage of banking regulation and interest rate policy, the government is reliant \non fiscal policy to manage the impact of shocks and stimulate inclusive growth. \n \n\n                                                \n1  The program is included in Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2016.

Despite these challenges, Kiribati grew 3.5% \n5. \nper year during 2011\u20132015 (Figure 1), buoyed by development partner financed investments in \nroads and waste and sanitation, as Kiribati seeks to overcome significant infrastructure deficit; \nand  fishing  license  revenues,  which  reached  nearly  A$200  million  or  96%  of  gross  domestic \nproduct  (GDP)  in  2015.5 Over  the  same  period,  tax  revenue  stagnated  at  14%\u201317%  of  GDP \nbecause of the narrow tax base, weak tax compliance, and poor corporate tax performance of \nSOEs. On the public expenditure side, the public sector wage bill has remained relatively flat at \n24%\u201328% of GDP, reflecting government efforts to restrain current expenditure. In 2016, because \nof unfavorable weather conditions, fishing license revenues fell more than 40% to A$116 million \n(55% of GDP). This reduced a fiscal surplus of 47.7% of GDP in 2015 to a deficit of 12.4% of \nGDP in 2016. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) anticipates that growth is expected to pick \nup to 3.1% in 2017, although fiscal deficits of 7.8% in 2017 and 5.6% in 2018 are projected as \nfishing revenues continue to decline from their 2015 peak (Figure 2). The IMF considers Kiribati \nto be at high risk of debt distress because of weak growth prospects and the long-term threat of \nclimate change.6 \n \n\nFigure 1: Real GDP and GDP per capita \n(Constant 2006 Australian dollars) \n\nFigure 2: Real GDP, Development \nExpenditure, and Revenue from Fishing \nLicense Fees  \n(Constant 2006 Australian dollars) \n\n1,550\n\n1,500\n\n1,450\n\n1,400\n\n1,350\n\n1,300\n\n190\n\n180\n\n170\n\n160\n\n150\n\n140\n\n130\n\ns\nn\no\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\nM\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\ns\nn\no\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\nM\n\nGDP per capita (RHS)\nGDP\n\n \n\nDevelopment Expenditure (RHS)\nFishing license fees (RHS)\nGDP\n\n \n\nGDP = gross domestic product, IMF = International Monetary Fund, RHS = right-hand side. \nSources: ADB.

Although Kiribati\u2019s fiscal position stabilized during 2014\u20132015 \n6. \n(Table 1), the government recognizes that limited capacity to take on new debt, volatility of fishing \nrevenue, severe infrastructure deficits (particularly on the outer islands), and the negative effects \nof climate change mean that it must remain vigilant and continue efforts to build fiscal buffers and \nsecure  support  from  development  partners  for  project  and  policy  financing.  Efforts  to  improve \ndomestic  revenue  mobilization  have  helped  expand  the  tax  net,  improve  compliance,  and \n\n                                                \n5  Through regional cooperation via the Parties to the Nauru Agreement, Kiribati and several other Pacific economies \nhave been able to achieve a structural shift to higher fishing license fees\u2014with the minimum cost for a vessel-day \nincreasing from $2,500 in 2010 to more than $10,000 in 2017. \n\n6  IMF. 2017.

The  government  introduced  a  value-added  tax  in  mid-2014  to  replace \ndistortive  tariffs  and  trade  taxes.  Increased  public  expenditure  has  been  driven  by  large \ninfrastructure  projects  financed  by  development  partners,  increases  in  health  and  education \nspending, and the doubling in the copra subsidy from A$8.0 million in the 2015 revised budget to \nA$17.2 million in the 2016 budget.7 Future budget decisions will need to account for a prudent \nassessment of Kiribati\u2019s spending goals, revenue projections, and the management targets of the \nRERF. Maintaining a sustainable budget position in the medium term will be central to this effort, \nbased on fishing revenue projections that allow the government to protect its public expenditure \nprograms from potential revenue volatility, complemented by an appropriately sized cash reserve \nbuffer to deal with external shocks. \n \n\nTable 1: Economic and Fiscal Performance, 2014\u20132018 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n2014 \n \n\n \n\n2015 \n \n\n \n\n2016 \n \n\nEstimated  Projected \n\n2017 \n \n\n2018 \n \n\nConsumer price (% change) \n\nRevenue \n \n \n\nFishing license fees (A$ million)b \n\n1,636.8 \n0.4 \n2.1 \n \n143.4 \n89.8 \n14.4 \n75.5 \n53.5 \n118.8 \n60.9 \n57.9 \n24.6 \n141.6 \n \n4.2 \n\n1.8 \n0.7 \n \n142.1 \n80.4 \n16.8 \n63.6 \n61.6 \n154.4 \n83.2 \n71.2 \n(12.4) \n115.7 \n \n(49.8) \n894 \n6,273 \n\n1,214.4 \n2.3 \n2.0 \n \n104.5 \n69.7 \n16.3 \n53.4 \n34.7 \n110.1 \n71.3 \n38.8 \n(5.6) \n112.2 \n \n(0.5) \n\n1,403.3 \n3.5 \n0.6 \n \n171.7 \n120.9 \n17.0 \n103.9 \n50.8 \n124.0 \n66.0 \n57.9 \n47.7 \n197.8 \n \n(22.5) \n756 \n5,482 \n\nTotal revenue and grants (% of GDP) \n \nTax revenue \n \n \nNontax revenue \n  Grants and transfers \nTotal expenditure (% of GDP) \nCurrent expenditure \n \nCapital expenditure \n \n\n1,357.7  1,393.6 \n2.0 \n2.0 \n \n106.0 \n71.1 \n16.6 \n54.6 \n34.8 \n113.8 \n74.9 \n38.9 \n(7.8) \n110.0 \n \n(3.7) \n\nIncome, growth, and inflationa \n  GDP per capita ($, current) \n  GDP growth (%, constant market prices) \n \nCentral government financea \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Overall balance (% of GDP) \n \nRERFc \n \n \n \n\u2026 = data not available, ( ) = negative, % = percent, GDP = gross domestic product, IMF = International Monetary Fund, \nRERF = Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund. \na  ADB estimates and projections. 2016 values are estimates. \nb  Government estimates.

A  more  stable  macroeconomic  framework  is  the \noverarching  objective  of  the  KDP,  2016\u20132019  and  the  KERP  (footnote  3).  The  KERP  was \ndeveloped against a backdrop of weak economic management, unsustainable drawdowns from \nthe  RERF,  high  levels  of  non-concessional  debt,  uncoordinated  borrowing  by  ministries  made \nwithout  approval  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economic  Development  (MFED),  poorly \n\nFinancing from RERF (% of GDP) \nRERF closing balance (A$ million) \nPer capita value (constant 2006 A$) \n\n929 \n6,258 \n\n957 \n6,182 \n\n679 \n5,062 \n\n                                                \n7  The copra subsidy is the government\u2019s main form of income redistribution  and social welfare to the outer islands, \nwhere job creation and income-earning opportunities are limited.  At the government\u2019s  request, the World Bank is \nundertaking a review of potential efficient and equitable alternatives to the copra subsidy, including exploring cash-\nfor-work  opportunities,  recalibrating  the  eligibility  criteria  for  existing  social  protection  schemes,  adjusting \npostsecondary scholarships, and providing transport grants to seamen for boarding foreign vessels. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nperforming SOEs, and weak management of fisheries revenues.8 Budget support through policy \ndialogue and policy financing from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other development \npartners has helped the government prioritize, appropriately sequence, and implement the KERP. \nThe KERP emphasizes (i) improving public financial management, (ii) improving the management \nof public assets and liabilities, and (iii) creating an environment for private sector-led growth. \n \n8. \nDevelopment partner coordination. The Economic Reform Taskforce (ERT), chaired by \nthe  secretary  to  the  cabinet,  is  the  main  forum  for  consultation  and  coordination  between  the \ngovernment and development partners on the implementation of the KERP. The ERT comprises \nrepresentatives  from  the  MFED;  implementing  agencies  such  as  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries  and \nMarine  Resources  Development;  the  Ministry  of  Commerce,  Industry  and  Cooperatives;  the \nMinistry of Information, Communication, Transport, and Tourism Development; and development \npartners. The ERT meetings provide a forum for facilitating dialogue, monitoring progress, and \ncoordinating technical assistance (TA). Other avenues for collaboration and coordination include \nthe annual IMF Article IV consultations and the biennial Development Partners Forum. \n \nADB collaborated closely with the World Bank and the governments of Australia and New \n9. \nZealand in preparing this program, which uses a joint government-led policy matrix to underpin \nthe  provision  of  budget  support.9 The  joint  matrix  includes  actions  used  as  triggers  by  other \ndevelopment  partners  such  as  procurement, \nfisheries,  asset  management,  and \ntelecommunications  reforms.  This,  along  with  other  complementary  measures  such  as  joint \nmissions,  reduces  transaction  costs  for  the  government  while  increasing  the  policy  impact.  In \naddition, ADB and the World Bank consulted the Japan International Cooperation Agency and \nthe IMF and its Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre to coordinate policy advice and TA, \nparticularly in fisheries revenue and public finance management (PFM). \n \n10. \nGovernment  reform  progress.  This  collaboration  and  coordination  has  helped  the \ngovernment focus its efforts on accomplishing the three pillars of KERP (para. 7). During 2013\u2013\n2016, the government (i) completed an analysis of public expenditure patterns, whose findings \ninformed the preparation of the government\u2019s annual fiscal strategy; (ii) completed external audits \nof the 2015 financial statements of operational SOEs with debts or guaranteed overdraft facilities; \n(iii)  ceased  government  bailouts  for  SOEs  and  payments  to  the  Australia  and  New  Zealand \nBanking  Group  Limited  (ANZ  Bank),  the  only  commercial  bank  in  Kiribati,  under  guarantee  of \noverdrafts and loans; (iv) approved a national fisheries policy to strengthen resource management \nand maximize license revenues; (v) enacted tax legislation to improve compliance and introduced \na  value-added  tax  to  broaden  the  revenue  base;  (vi)  improved  management  of  contingent \nliabilities;  (vii)  approved  and  implemented  a  debt  policy  to  prevent  new  non-concessional \nborrowing; (ix) appointed new asset managers for the RERF and restructured the RERF portfolio; \nand  (x)  privatized  a  government-owned  telecommunications  company  and  granted  a  second \nmobile operator a license to operate.10 \n \n\n                                                \n8  Between 2013\u20132016, the government has taken important measures to improve fiscal management of debt policy. \nKiribati has adopted a debt policy establishing criteria for concessional and non-concessional public borrowing and \nformal procedures for contracting new debt, consistent with sustainable macroeconomic management. It has also \nimproved the management of public debt by establishing a comprehensive database of public debt. Kiribati\u2019s current \ndebt portfolio constitutes external debt only\u2014from ADB and Taipei,China\u2014since all domestic debt was cleared in \n2015. There is no SOE debt, and none of the SOEs have overdraft facilities with  the Australia and New Zealand \nBanking Group Limited (ANZ Bank). \n\n9  Joint Policy Matrix (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n10 ADB. 2016. Finding Balance 2016: Benchmarking the Performance of State-Owned Enterprises in Island Countries. \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n\fADB value addition. ADB has played a critical role in (i) identifying critical SOE, PFM, \n11. \nand  business  environment  reforms  to  support  the  government\u2019s  reform  agenda; (ii)  enhancing \ndevelopment coordination through coordinating and collaborating with other development partner \ninitiatives in these areas; (iii) providing TA support for capacity building and reform implementation, \nparticularly for SOE reform;11 and (iv) collaborating with the governments of Australia and New \nZealand to support the restructure of the Public Utilities Board (PUB),12 complementing ongoing \nproject  investments  in  water,  sanitation,  and  energy.  Given  thin  administrative  capacity,  the \ngovernment\u2019s focus on addressing significant deterioration in infrastructure assets, and the need \nto improve service delivery to the outer islands, reform implementation would have been difficult \nand have major cost implications without ADB technical, strategic, and financial support provided \nunder  this  program.  This  support  aligns  with  the  KDP  and  the  KERP.  It  is  consistent  with  the \nPacific Approach, 2016\u20132020 and its focus on reducing the costs of doing business and providing \nsocial services, managing risks from natural and economic shocks, and enabling value creation \nby supporting private sector growth and investment.13 The programmatic approach provides for \nan ongoing, coordinated multi-development partner dialogue on critical economic reform issues, \nwhich also acts to situates partner support within the government\u2019s economic reform priorities. At \nthe same time the program grant enables government to finance reform efforts and build a broader \nsupport  base  for  these  actions.  Future  ADB  support  will  continue  to  support  reform \nimplementation in the three major reform areas identified in the KERP (para. 7). The TA will further \nsupport economic management, structural reforms, and PFM (footnote 10). \n \nB. \n \n12. \nachieved.

In support of this effort, the \nGovernment of Kiribati has continued to fund community service obligations for the provision of noncommercial water \nto  households,  and  has  approved  the  Electricity  Distribution  Refurbishment  Project,  jointly  financed  by  the \ngovernments of Australia and New Zealand. \n\n13 ADB. 2016. Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020. Manila. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fAssets.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  government  completed  a  review  of  its  RERF \ncustodial arrangements to ensure that the services of the current provider remain \ncompetitive  with  current  market  practice  and  benchmarks.  The  government \nsubsequently  endorsed  the  recommendations  of  the  review  and  approved  the \nissuance of a request for proposal for custodial services, which was issued in April \n2017.  Subprogram  2  will  ensure  the  contract  for  custodial  services  is  awarded \nbased on the completed selection and evaluation process. \n\nContingent liabilities. The implementation of a public sector debt database has \nenabled the government to better monitor all debt, including contingent liabilities. \nThe  program\u2019s  focus  on  the  considerable  audit  backlog  resulted  in  the \ngovernment\u2019s recognition of this priority issue. Despite constrained capacity, the \ngovernment  is  now  addressing  the  backlog.  The  government  has  completed \nfinancial  statements  for  2016  for  five  major  SOEs:  Air  Kiribati  Limited, \nDevelopment  Bank  of  Kiribati,  Kiribati  Oil  Company  Ltd,  Kiribati  Ports  Authority, \nand the PUB. The Kiribati Provident Fund also completed financial statements for \n2012\u20132016. Subprogram 2 will ensure financial statements for 2017 are completed \nand, in the case of the Kiribati Provident Fund, submitted to the Kiribati National \nAudit Office. \n\nPublic finance management. The government has identified the shortcomings of \nits  financial  management  information  system  (FMIS),  including  its  inability  to \nprepare, execute, or report against the national budget, which undermines financial \ncontrol, monitoring, and reporting. The government has approved a full review to \nassess  the  needs  and  identify  all  gaps  in  the  FMIS.  The  government  has \ncommitted  $2.5  million  in  its  2018  budget  to  improve  or  replace  the  FMIS  in \nsubprogram 2, based on the outcome of the full review. \n\nState-owned enterprises. On 30 August 2017, the cabinet, supported by ADB, \napproved to seek a concession plus lease arrangement for the government-owned \nCaptain Cook Hotel on Kiritimati island. Subprogram 2 will build on this support to \nprepare  the  Captain  Cook  Hotel  for  the  transaction,  including  through  an \nadvertisement  for  sale  and  any  necessary  road  shows,  and  then  reach  cabinet \napproval to execute the concession agreement. The hotel has had mixed financial \nresults since 2010. In late 2015, after 2 years of poor financial performance and \nthe hotel failing to remit pension and income tax deductions from staff salaries, the \ngovernment directed the MFED and an ADB-funded TA team to explore public\u2013\nprivate partnership (PPP) arrangements. \n\nOutput 2. Environment for the private sector improved. Private sector-led growth is \n\n \n16. \nan important focus for the government, and the program will support the following reforms: \n \n\nImproving access to basic utilities. Access to reliable and responsibly costed \nelectricity and water is vital to encourage the growth of the private sector. Following \nthe appointment of a new chief executive officer, the PUB began implementing a \nmedium-term reform plan. The reforms are intended to ensure operationally and \nfinancially  sustainable  delivery  of  electricity,  water,  and  sanitation  services. \nChanges to electricity tariffs in January 2017 and to residential connection fees in \nApril  2017  to  make  electricity  more  affordable  and  accessible  to  lower-income \nhouseholds have resulted in expanded access to power and an increased billing \ncollection  rate.  For  example,  charges  for  the  first  100  kilowatt-hours  (kWh)  of \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fconsumption were reduced from A$0.40 per kWh to A$0.10 per kWh for domestic \nconsumers. The charge for consuming 100\u2013300 kWh of electricity is A$0.40 per \nkWh, but the rate for more than 300kWh of consumption increased from A$0.40 \nper  kWh  to  A$0.55  per  kWh.  The  cabinet  has  also  approved  a  reduction  in  the \nhousehold electricity connection fee from A$380 to A$50, which prompted  more \nthan  1,000  households  to  request  electricity  connections.  Subprogram  2  will \nsupport  further  reform  in  the  PUB  to  include  water  and  sanitation  services.  The \nPUB aims to deliver piped water that is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week \nthrough a pressurized system. Although water is free, PUB research suggests that \neven  poor  households  would be  prepared  to  pay  a  usage fee  to  have  a regular \nsupply  of  piped  water  rather  than  water  being  available  only  from  communal \nstandpipes for 2 hours a day, every second day. \n\nPublic\u2013private  partnership  concessions.  The  government  awarded  a  PPP \nconcession for the Betio Shipyard Limited. The government owns Betio Shipyard \nand  chose  to  tender  out  the  lease  of  the  shipyard  and  its  assets  under  a  PPP \nconcession  agreement,  for  an  anticipated  term  of  25  years.  In  return,  the \nconcession  holder  will  be  required  to  operate  the  shipyard,  pay  an  annual \nconcession fee, repair the existing slipway, and construct a new slipway with larger \ncapacity to service the fishing fleet rather than have these vessels serviced in Suva, \nFiji. Subprogram 2 will also support the award of a management contract for the \ngovernment-owned flagship hotel, Otintaai Hotel. \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\n \n17. \nSubprogram 2 building on subprogram 1. The policy matrix sets out 8 proposed policy \nactions for subprogram 2, with completion expected October 2018. Subprogram 2 will extend the \nfocus  of    the  policy  actions  under  subprogram  1  to  include  (i)  the  development  of  a  whole-of-\ngovernment  asset  management  strategy;  (ii)  the  implementation  of  a  community  service \nobligation policy in 2018 that will result in SOEs and utilities being directly paid for the assessed \ncost  of  providing  agreed  community  services  rather  than  a reliance on  ad hoc  cash  injections, \nwhich have been an unpredictable drain on budget resources; (iii) the continuation of PUB reforms, \nfocusing on the cost and quality of water and sanitation services and delivery of services to the \nmost vulnerable groups; and (iv) the creation of a PPP for the Otintaai Hotel.  \n \nD. \n \n18. \nThe Government of Kiribati has requested a grant not exceeding $5.0 million from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources (Asian Development Fund) for Subprogram 1. Subprogram 2 financing \nis  $2.5  million.  The  grant  will  (i)  help  meet  the  financing  gap  for  the  2017  fiscal  year  and  (ii) \nincentivize timely implementation of the KERP policy reform actions needed to move toward fiscal \nsustainability in the long term. The government forecasts its financing requirements to be $18.7 \nmillion in 2017 (9.2% of GDP) and $15.4 million in 2018 (7.3% of GDP). \n \n19. \nBudget support will help insulate public spending from potential volatility in fishing revenue, \nlimit  drawdowns  from  the  RERF  and  allow  for  its  growth,  and  allow  the  government  to  move \ntoward structurally balanced budgets over the medium term. ADB, the governments of Australia \nand New Zealand, and the World Bank jointly support the implementation of the KERP, with these \npartners providing collaborative cofinancing of $0.4 million (Australia), $2.0 million (New Zealand), \nand $5.0 million (World Bank). Total policy financing of $12.4 million will help finance 69% of the \nrecurrent fiscal deficit. \n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fImplementation Arrangements \n\nE. \n \n20. \nThe  program  is  expected  to  be  implemented  over  24  months  from  November  2016- \nOctober 2018. The implementation period for subprogram 1 is November 2016\u2013May 2018. The \nMFED,  as the  executing  agency,  will  oversee  implementation  of  agreed  policy  actions  and  be \nresponsible  for  program  administration,  disbursements,  and  maintenance  of  all  records.  The \nimplementing  agencies  will  be  the  MFED;  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries  and  Marine  Resources \nDevelopment;  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  and  Sustainable  Energy;  and  the  Ministry  of \nInformation,  Communication,  Transport,  and  Tourism  Development.  TA  from  ADB  and  other \npartners has been, and will continue to be, available to support the government in accomplishing \nthe policy actions. Procurement, advance contracting, and retroactive financing are not expected. \nADB will disburse the grant proceeds following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as \namended from time to time). ADB will carry out joint progress monitoring through the joint ERT. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nGovernance \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \n21. \nThe  primary  gain  from  strengthening  the  RERF  management  is  improved  fiscal \nsustainability and macroeconomic stability. The RERF is the primary vehicle for intergenerational \nsaving and buffers the economy from external shocks and revenue volatility, which tends to be \ndominated by the fishing license fee revenue. The improvement of the RERF management will \nenhance the government\u2019s ability to address these shocks while maintaining vital public services \nand infrastructure investments. Better public debt monitoring will also contribute to an improved \nfiscal  position.  The  expected  impact  of  the  PUB  restructuring  includes  the  improved  health  of \nKiribati\u2019s population, especially those in Tarawa, through enhanced access to improved sanitation \ninfrastructure and services. Improved access to water and electricity is also expected to create \nbusiness opportunities and foster private sector development in the country. \n \nB. \n \n22. \nPromoting  good  governance  is  a  key  national  priority.  The  2010  Public  Financial \nManagement Performance Report identified relative strengths in Kiribati\u2019s PFM. The report also \nhighlighted  weaknesses,  including  oversight  of  aggregate  fiscal  risk  from  other  public  sector \nentities; multiyear perspective in fiscal planning; recording and management of cash balances, \ndebt, and guarantees; and competition, value for money, and controls in procurement.14 Through \nthe KERP, the government has been making steady progress in addressing these reforms (para. \n9).  In  addition,  the  government  has  strengthened  expenditure  controls  through  improved \naccounting systems. Kiribati\u2019s annual budget is publicly available on the government\u2019s website. \nIn addition, the government completed an ADB-supported public procurement review in August \n2017,15 which concluded that Kiribati\u2019s public procurement process, under its Procurement Act, \n2002, is outdated and incomplete. ADB is working closely with the government and other partners \nto implement the Kiribati Public Procurement Reform Program, which will, in the long term, reduce \nstaff costs; improve value for money, quality, and delivery of purchases; and lead to 10%\u201315% in \noverall savings.16 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the government and the MFED. \n\n                                                \n14 Government of Kiribati.

Improved economic management can free up resources that \nwill  allow  the  government  to  better  respond  to  external  shocks,  increase  allocations  to  social \nsectors, and enable private sector job creation. \n \nD. \n \n24. \nThe program is classified category C for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and \nindigenous  peoples.  SDCC  has  reviewed  the  environmental  and  social  implications  of  the \nprogram  outputs  and  actions,  and  no  activity  will  result  in  or  lead  to  any  physical  works  or \ninfrastructure.  The  program  will  therefore  not  cause  any  involuntary  resettlement  and \nenvironmental impacts. No distinct and vulnerable groups of indigenous peoples will be affected. \n \nE. \n \n25.  Major risks and mitigation measures are summarized in Table 2 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.17 \n \n\nRisks and Mitigation Measures \n\nTable 2: Summary of Risks and Mitigation Measures \nMitigation Measures \n\nRisks \nThe government cannot implement \npolicy reform actions because it \nlacks capacity. \n\nExternal shocks affect the fiscal \nposition and/or divert political \nfocus from reforms. \n\nProgress and commitment to SOE \nperformance improvements are \nhalted or reversed. \n\nAlready the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development has \nstrengthened its organizational structure and its capacity. Technical \nassistance from multiple development partners aims to further \nimprove capacity while supporting and driving reform. A continued \nfocus on training and raising the professionalism of government \nofficials is a vital part of reforms to ensure sustainability. \nExternal shocks can result from climate or economic impacts to \nfisheries revenue or returns on the RERF. Kiribati is one of the \nsmallest, most isolated, and highly vulnerable countries in the world \nand has limited buffers to protect it from shocks. The program seeks \nto support fiscal resilience through revenue enhancement, ongoing \nfiscal consolidation, and stabilization of the RERF as a buffer \nagainst external shocks and the country\u2019s increasing vulnerability to \nclimate change. ADB will continue to monitor national, regional, and \nglobal economic developments and environmental risks and \nrespond promptly to possible government requests for assistance if \nunforeseen events occur. \nThere has been strong SOE reform since 2012 through the \nimplementation of the State-Owned Enterprises (Amendment) Act, \n2013 and the closure of selected underperforming SOEs. Ongoing \ncommitment to further reform is confirmed through the policy action \nreforms supported by the KERP and monitored by the ERT. SOE \nreform is a trigger for budget support for multiple development \npartners, ensuring a continued focus on reform. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, ERT = Economic Reform Taskforce, KERP = Kiribati Economic Reform Plan, RERF \n= Revenue Equalization Reform Fund, SOE = state-owned enterprise. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n                                                \n17 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \n26. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the grant \ndocuments. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n27. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  programmatic  approach  and  policy-based  grant  would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend \nthat the Board approve: \n\nthe programmatic approach for the Strengthening Economic Management Reform \nProgram, and \n\nthe grant not exceeding $5,000,000 to the Republic of Kiribati from ADB\u2019s Special \nthe \nFunds  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund) \nStrengthening Economic Management Reform Program, on terms and conditions \nthat  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  grant \nagreement presented to the Board. \n\nfor  subprogram  1  of \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n23 November 2017 \n \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nRisks \n\n \nPolitical pressure \nbecause of vested \ninterests slow down \nthe reform process. \n \nExternal shocks \nimpact the fiscal \nposition and/or \ndivert political focus \nfrom reforms. \n \n \n \nWeak government \npublic finance \nmanagement (PFM) \nsystems and limited \ncapacity undermine \nrevenue \nmobilization and \nexpenditure \ndiscipline. \n\nImpact the Program is Aligned with \nStable macroeconomic framework achieved (Kiribati Development Plan, 2016\u20132019)a \n\n \n \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \nOverall economic \nmanagement \nimproved \n\nPerformance Indicators \nwith Targets and Baselines \nBy 2020: \nAt least A$30 million of \nadditional cash reserves \ntransferred to the RERF \nannually (2016 baseline: \nA$70 million) \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n \nIMF Article IV staff \nreports \n\n \n \n \n1a.
