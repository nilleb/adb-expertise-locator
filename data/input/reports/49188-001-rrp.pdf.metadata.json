I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) the proposed \nsenior loan of up to $75,000,000 to LOLC Finance (LOFC) consisting of (a) an A loan of up to \n$30,000,000, and (b) a B loan of up to $45,000,000; and (ii) the proposed senior loan of up to \n$25,000,000 to LOLC Micro Credit (LOMC), for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises \n(MSMEs) in Sri Lanka. \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY  \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n2.  Despite an average gross domestic product growth rate of 5.7% from 2012 to 2014, Sri \nLanka had a poverty rate of 6.7% and an unemployment rate of 4.7%.1 The government has \nidentified small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as key to sustainable economic growth.2 \nIn 2014, SMEs contributed to 20% of exports, 30% of the production value  added in the \nmanufacturing  sector,  and  70%  of  total  employment,  and  were  prominent  in  the  leasing, \nagriculture, manufacturing,  construction,  and  service  sectors  in  Sri  Lanka.3 In  2014,  SMEs \ncontributed about $75 billion (52%) to gross domestic product.4 Although Sri Lanka has a large \nnumber of banks and nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs), it is estimated that there is an \nunbanked population of approximately 70%, with access to finance cited by an International \nFinance Corporation study as being the major limiting factor for MSMEs.5 \n \n3.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has provided funding through its sovereign and \nnonsovereign operations to support economic development through the financial sector. Via its \nnonsovereign  operations,  much  needed  longer  term  funding was  provided  to  financial \ninstitutions, targeting borrowers in post conflict areas and other underserved markets, including \nhousing and infrastructure finance, and SME onlending.  Short-term funding in support of trade \nwas provided through ADB\u2019s Trade Finance Program. Given the need to fund MSME growth \nand expand access to finance to underserved customer segments, ADB identified two NBFIs as \ngood candidates to reach the underbanked customer segments, which cannot easily obtain \ntraditional bank financing. LOFC, ranked third in terms of total assets among NBFIs in Sri \nLanka, is a licensed finance company that was established in 2003 and now has 140 branches \nand service outlets, offering leasing and hire purchase loans for commercial use as well as \nIslamic finance products to moderate to middle-income clientele. Its average loan size was \n                                                \n1  Government of Sri Lanka, Department of Census and Statistics. http://www.statistics.gov.lk \nhttp://www.statistics.gov.lk/poverty/SpatialDistributionOfPoverty2012_13.pd/; ADB. 2015.

LOMC, ranked seventh in terms of total assets among NBFIs in Sri \nLanka,  started  operations  in  2009  as  a  specialized  leasing  company  (SLC)  and  provides \nindividual and group loans and leases to MSMEs, including farmers and women in rural areas in \nSri Lanka.6 Women borrowers account for 70% of its loan and/or lease portfolio. It has 128 \nbranches and service outlets throughout 10 provinces in Sri Lanka and, as March 2015, had \n249,000 clients.7 LOMC\u2019s average loan size was $4,000 as of FY2014.  LOFC and LOMC are \nsubstantially owned by the Lanka ORIX Leasing Company (LOLC) Group, Sri Lanka\u2019s largest \nNBFI,  which  received funding from  ADB  in  2007.8 By  targeting  these two  companies  that \nprioritize financial inclusion, ADB will be able to reach a wider customer income base across the \nMSME segment.  \n  \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n4.  LOLC Group, the first leasing company in Sri Lanka, was established in 1980 through a \ngovernment initiative to support SME access to credit. It is one of the largest financial services \nconglomerates offering an array of products and a pioneer in the leasing industry in Sri Lanka. It \nhad total assets of SLRs246.0 billion as of FY2015 and a market capitalization of SLRs49.1 \nbillion as of 30 August 2015. The LOLC Group has 274 branches across the country.  SME and \nmicrofinance businesses are core focus areas of the group, accounting for as much as 42% of \nits  revenue.  The  group\u2019s  financial  solutions  combine  funding  with  advisory  and  technical \nsupport,  which  together  help  improve  the  supply  chain  and  marketing  linkages  for  MSME \ncustomers.  \n \n5.  LOFC\u2019s loan book was SLRs57.9 billion as of FY2015. LOFC will broaden its funding \nbase with international financial institution and commercial funding. Small LOFC units will be \nestablished  in  LOLC  Group  branches  to  leverage  cross-selling  opportunities  and  expand \nLOFC\u2019s presence beyond its 140 branches. LOFC will continue to enhance the services of its \nIslamic finance unit, Al-Falaah, by introducing a range of deposit and savings products, and by \nexpanding its services using the ORIX Realtime internet platform.9  \n \n6.  It has a large rural presence with 128 branches, with an expected 175 branches by 2018. \nLOMC sources its funding primarily through international financial institutions and social impact \ninvestors.10  \n \n                                                \n6  SLCs are unable to take deposits. The government is working on suitable legislation for the microfinance sector \nwhich would enable LOMC to take deposits. The act is expected to become effective in 2016. Group loans are \ntaken on a joint liability basis (with a minimum of three members) where the repayment obligation is borne by all \nthe members in case of default. \n7  LOMC and LOFC have shared premises in 128 branches and service outlets of which 100 are outside Colombo, \nincluding 47 in the north and east, which will help LOFC and LOMC better assess and serve the postconflict areas, \nas well as customers outside of Colombo. \n8  ADB. 2007.

Financial Performance \n \n1.  LOLC Finance \n \n14.  Capital. LOFC is well capitalized, with a tier 1 capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of 13.1% \nand total CAR of 18.1% in FY2015 (compared with 13.1% as of FY2014).  The increase in CAR \nfrom FY2014 to FY2015 was due to the issuance of unsecured redeemable subordinated \ndebentures  in  January  2015  amounting  to  SLRs5.0  billion.  LOFC  remains  well  above  the \nregulatory minimums of 5% for the tier 1 capital ratio and 10% for the total CAR, which gives the \nfinance company good absorptive capacity.18 To support LOFC\u2019s portfolio growth and its healthy \ncapital position, LOFC has not paid any dividends from 2000 to 2015.  \n \n15.  Earnings and profitability. LOFC had a net income of SLRs1.48 billion in FY2015, \ncompared with SLRs1.0 billion as of FY2014. As of FY2015, net interest income was SLRs5.9 \nbillion (FY2014: SLRs4.4 billion) and noninterest income was SLRs1.3 billion (FY2014: SLRs0.9 \nbillion).  Net interest income increased 34% in FY2015 from FY2014 due to (i) the existing \nlending portfolio yielding above current market rates; and (ii) significant growth in the portfolio. \nThe net interest margin remained high at 10.5% in FY2015 (FY2014: 9.5%). The cost-to-income \nratio increased slightly from 47.5% in FY2014 to 48.0% in FY2015; operational efficiencies are \nexpected in 2015\u20132018 following heavy investments in technology. As of FY2015, return on \nassets increased to 2.5% (2014: 1.9%) and return on equity to 20.4% (2014: 16.7%). \n \n16.  Loan  portfolio  and  asset  quality.  LOFC\u2019s  gross  loan  portfolio  grew  29.4%  from \nSLRs44.7  billion  in  FY2014  to  SLRs57.9  billion  in  FY2015.  Innovative  customer-oriented \nsolutions and increased accessibility contributed to loan growth.19 LOFC maintains a diversified \nportfolio in terms of concentration by sector. The largest industry concentrations were loans for \ntrade, which comprised 33% of the loan portfolio, followed by transportation and services (29%), \nmanufacturing (13%), agriculture (8%), construction (8%), and others (9%) as of the end of \nFY2015.20 The  average  loan  tenor  was  50  months.21 Additionally,  all  MSME  leases  are \ncollateralized by their underlying lease assets. \n                                                \n16 Branch managers have a limit of SLRs500,000 for individual and group loans; anything above this limit has to be \napproved by regional managers. Other approval levels are similar to those of LOFC.  \n17 Ownership, Management, and Governance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n18 Government of Sri Lanka, Central Bank of Sri Lanka. 2015.

Although there was economic uncertainty due to the change in government in January \n2015,  LOFC  had  strong  growth  in  the  loan  portfolio  and,  as  a  result,  strengthened  its \nunderwriting  and  monitoring  capacity  and  LOFC  engages  in  minimal  related  party  lending \n(12.7% of total equity, compared with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka\u2019s limit of 20.0%). \n \n18.  Funding and liquidity. LOFC shifted its funding strategy in FY2015. Although LOFC\u2019s \nmain source of funding was deposits, this decreased to 69.0% of total liabilities as of FY2015 \n(FY2014: 90.8%).22 The decrease in deposits by 21.8% (as a percentage of total liabilities) was \ndue to LOFC\u2019s shift toward bank and corporate borrowings to take advantage of lower interest \nrates. In addition, bank borrowings accounted for 22.3%, trade and other payables accounted \nfor 7.2%, and derivatives and tax liabilities accounted for 1.5% of total liabilities. LOFC\u2019s loan-to-\ndeposit ratio was 140.2% in FY 2015 (2014: 105.0%).23 Foreign exchange risk was low with an \nopen position of 2.16% as of FY2015. LOFC uses forward exchange contracts to hedge open \npositions. \n \n  2.  LOLC Micro Credit \n \n19.  Capital. LOMC has maintained a healthy capital position with a CAR greater than 20% \nfrom 2012 to 2015. This was supported by 100% retention of profits and fresh capital infusions \nin FY2012 and FY2013 amounting to SLRs890 million. LOMC is well capitalized with a tier 1 \ncapital ratio and CAR of 19.7% as of FY2015 (FY2014: 25.5%).24 The decrease in CAR from \nFY2014 to FY2015 was due to loan book expansion and LOMC incurring additional costs to \nintroduce new banking operations and expand its rural network. However, LOMC remains well \nabove the regulatory minimum of 5% for tier 1 capital ratio and 10% for total CAR. The tier 1 \ncapital ratio and total CAR are targeted to reach 24% by FY2018. \n \n20.  Earnings and profitability. LOMC had a net income of SLRs1.1 billion as of FY2015, \nrepresenting strong growth of 54.7% from its FY2014 net income of SLRs730 million. As of \nFY2015, net interest income was SLRs4.5 billion (FY2014: SLRs3.1 billion) and noninterest \nincome was SLRs496.6 million (FY2014: SLRs406.8 million). The net interest margin increased \nfrom 13.6% in FY2014 to 16.8% in FY2015 due to higher yields from MSME loans and strategic \nmarket positioning. The cost-to-income ratio improved to 43.5% in FY2015 (FY2014: 42.9%) \ndue to operational efficiencies. The cost-to-income ratio is expected to remain below 50% \nthrough FY2018. As of FY2015, return on assets increased to 3.9% (FY2014: 3.0%) and return \non equity increased to 22.5% (FY2014: 17.9%). \n \n21.  Loan portfolio and asset quality. LOMC\u2019s gross loan portfolio increased 31.5% to \nSLRs26.1 billion as of FY2015 (FY2014: SLRs19.8 billion).25 Growth was due to increased \ndemand for three-wheelers and microgroup loans. LOMC maintains a diversified portfolio in \nterms of concentration by sector. The largest industry concentrations as of March 2015 were \nloans for services, which comprised 45% of the loan portfolio, followed by small businesses \n(34%) and agriculture (21%). The average loan tenor was about 54 months for individual loans \nand 18 months for group loans, With strong loan growth and improved underwriting measures, \nAsset quality for microloans as measured by NPLs (30 days past due, an industry standard for \nmicrofinance institution loans) improved from 0.9% in FY2014 to 0.5% in FY2015. LOMC\u2019s loan \n                                                \n22 The sector growth was 48.5% as of December 2014. \n23 Sector average as of December 2014 was 154%. \n24 The sector average was a tier 1 capital ratio of 14.7% and total CAR of 16.6% as of the end of 2014. \n25 The sector average was 16% as of December 2014.   \n \n \n ", "6 \n \nloss reserves for NPLs were high at 86.6% as of FY2015 (FY2014: 153.8%).26 As of FY2015, \nexposure to the top 20 group obligors was very low at 2.2% of total capital, and LOMC engaged \nin minimal related party lending (8.0% of total equity). \n \n22.  Funding and liquidity. LOMC\u2019s main source of funding in FY2015 was borrowings (as \nan SLC, it cannot take deposits). As a result, this contributed to higher funding costs. As of \nFY2015, borrowings accounted for 83.3% of total liabilities (FY2014: 89.1%). Other liabilities \nincluded trade and other payables (11.3%); deferred tax liabilities (2.5%); and bank overdrafts, \nretirement  obligations,  and  derivative  financial  instruments  (2.9%).  As  of  FY2015,  LOMC \nmaintained a liquid assets ratio of 18%, which was above the sector requirement of 10%. ADB \nfunding will be beneficial to LOMC given the lack of longer tenor loans, robust loan growth, and \nthe need for continued foreign funding given the shallow capital markets. LOMC uses forward \nexchange contracts to hedge foreign exchange risks to prevent any currency mismatch. As of \nFY2015, LOMC had an open currency exposure of 2.6%. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n23.  The proposed ADB assistance consists of (i) a loan of up to $75 million to LOFC \ncomprising (a) an A loan of up to $30 million and (b) a B loan of up to $45 million; and (ii) a loan \nof up to $25 million to LOMC. The A loan to LOFC will have a tenor of up to 7 years, and the B \nloan will have a tenor of up to 3 years. The loan to LOMC will have a tenor of up to 5 years. \nLOFC  and  LOMC  will  use  the  proceeds  of  the  loans  exclusively  for  onlending  to  eligible \nMSMEs.27 ADB will also provide a capacity development technical assistance (TA) from an \nexisting TA for an environmental and social management system, product development for \nmobile banking, and financial literacy training.28  \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n24.  Monitoring of the project will be carried out by ADB.29 LOFC and LOMC will provide ADB \nwith financial reports at predetermined intervals, including (i) audited and unaudited financial \nstatements; (ii) compliance certificates for financial covenants; (iii) reporting on the MSME loan \nportfolio and gender action plan; and (iv) annual reporting on selected development indicators \nagreed between ADB, LOFC, and LOMC.

ADB financing will support longer tenor leasing products and also allow \nfor recycling of shorter-term microloans. \n \n26.  Mobilizing cofinancing.   ADB will catalyze additional private sector funding through a \nsyndicated loan that will enable the obligor to obtain additional funding. This funding will meet \nclients\u2019 needs for growth and funding diversification.  \n \n27.  Technical  assistance.  ADB\u2019s  TA  will  help  develop  an  environmental  and  social \nmanagement system, improve LOFC\u2019s deposit mobilization, and assist LOFC and LOMC with \nproduct development to increase their outreach to remote villages and farmers. Mobile banking \nwill be further developed and financial literacy programs will be introduced to improve reach and \naddress over indebtedness of household borrowers.  \n \n28.  Gender mainstreaming. ADB will help strengthen the outreach efforts of LOFC and \nLOMC by targeting women entrepreneurs, and bolstering LOFC\u2019s and LOMC\u2019s internal policies \npertaining to women. The project has gender targets and will be categorized as effective gender \nmainstreaming.30 \n \nD.  Risks \n \n29.  Political and economic conditions. A new president took office in January 2015 and \nwas reinstated in the parliamentary elections that took place on 17 August 2015. The recent \nchange  in  leadership  could  lead  to  a  continued  temporary  economic slowdown  that  could \nnegatively impact the performance of LOFC and LOMC.  To date, LOFC and LOMC have \ncontinued to see healthy demand for their products. Sri Lanka\u2019s overall outlook is currently \npositive, and gross domestic product is projected to expand 6.5% annually on average from \n2015 to 2017.31 \n \n30.  Growth strategy and asset quality. As LOFC\u2019s and LOMC\u2019s loan and lease portfolios \ncontinue to expand and as increasing numbers of first-time borrowers are extended credit, this \ncould pose additional challenges for management of each company and impact asset quality.32 \nDue  diligence  has  determined  that  management  of  both  companies  have  a  sound \nunderstanding of all the risks associated with the increase in lending to MSMEs, and that LOFC \nand LOMC have  implemented measures to mitigate these risks, including (i) robust credit \nunderwriting  policies  and  procedures;  (ii)  investment  in  technology  and  appropriate \nmanagement information systems; and (iii) well-trained staff who are capable of engaging in \nrural lending. \n \n31.  Currency risk.  LOFC and LOMC will borrow and repay in US dollars, although most \nMSME lending will be in Sri Lankan rupees. The companies will hedge ADB\u2019s loans through \nswap facilities with commercial banks and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.  \n \n \n                                                \n30 Women currently form 98% of all group loan accounts. Key targets are at least 10% of the $30 million provided to \nLOFC and at least 20% of the $25 million provided to LOMC are to women borrowers. \n31 International Monetary Fund. 2015.

DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n32.  Impact. The transaction will broaden access to finance for MSMEs in Sri Lanka.  \n \n33.  Outcome. The outcome will be the growth and sustainability of LOFC and LOMC to \nprovide financial services to MSMEs in urban and rural areas.  \n \n34.  Outputs. Outputs include LOMC\u2019s and LOFC\u2019s increased financial capacity to service \nand increase lending products to MSMEs and microfinance borrowers. LOFC and LOMC will \nprovide access to longer-term funds for onlending to MSMEs, which will result in an increased \nnumber of MSME accounts and volume of loans. In addition, the ADB TA (footnote 32) will help \nLOFC and LOMC reach underserved customers and, together with other international financial \ninstitutions, further develop mobile banking as a transaction mode.  \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n \n35.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. Under the Midterm Review of \nStrategy 2020, ADB aims to strengthen its support for the finance sector by supporting the \ndevelopment  of  financial  infrastructure,  institutions,  and  products  and  services,  and  by \npromoting inclusive growth.33 Through such initiatives, ADB will continue to (i) help channel the \nregion's savings into productive investments, and (ii) build the capacity of financial institutions \nby introducing international best practices. The proposed investment supports institutional and \nfinancial sector development through the deepening of the financial sector and the provision of \nfunding for MSME onlending in urban and rural areas. Financial development will also be \nsupported through the TA, which will strengthen the bank\u2019s onlending capacity (footnote 32). \nThe  project  is  also  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Gender  Equality  and  Women\u2019s  Empowerment \nOperational Plan, 2013\u20132020.34 \n \n36.  Consistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations. The  project  is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s interim country partnership strategy and country operations business plan \nfor  Sri  Lanka.35 These  are  built  on  the  government\u2019s  development  policy  framework  for \neconomic development, including the President of Sri Lanka\u2019s election manifesto (footnote 3), \nwhich  identified  MSMEs  as  a  strategic  sector  and  called  for  support  for  private  sector \ndevelopment  projects  that  accelerate  the  pace  of  private  sector  participation  and  promote \nfinancial sector development. ADB has actively supported the private financial sector.36 The \nproject will further build upon ADB\u2019s work and support financial sector development in Sri Lanka. \n  \nV.

The investment is classified as category FI treated as C for impacts on the environment, \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  financial  intermediaries\u2019  business \nactivities  have  no  adverse  environmental  impacts,  and  are  unlikely  to  entail  impacts  on \ninvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The financial intermediaries will apply ADB's \nprohibited investment activities list, exclude all projects that will have adverse environment and \nsocial safeguards impacts though its sustainability policy, ensure that investments using ADB \nfunds abide by applicable national laws and regulations, and comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009). The financial intermediaries will confirm this in their periodic reports to \nADB and need not apply any other specific safeguard requirements.37  \n \n38.  The financial intermediaries will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s \nSocial Protection Strategy (2001), will take measures to comply with internationally recognized \ncore labor standards. LOFC and LOMC will report regularly to ADB on (i) their compliance with \nsuch laws and (ii) the measures taken. Information disclosure and consultation with affected \npeople will be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements. Proactive gender features are \nincluded  in  the  project  design  to  support  the  project\u2019s  effective  gender  mainstreaming \ncategory.38 \nB.  Anticorruption Policy  \n \n39.  LOFC  and  LOMC  were  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  of  implementing  best  international \npractice relating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB \nwill  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting \ncorruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event \nof noncompliance.   \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n \n40.  The proposed loans are within the medium-term country, industry, group, and single \ninvestment exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n \n41.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \nCharter), 39  ADB  will  proceed  with  the  proposed  assistance  upon  establishing  that  the \nGovernment of Sri Lanka has no objection to the proposed assistance to LOFC and LOMC. \nADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, \nfollowing approval of the proposed assistance by the Board of Directors. \n \nVI.
