THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed grants \nto Tuvalu for the Outer Island Maritime Infrastructure Project.1 The report also describes the \nproposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) for \nthe Outer Island Maritime Infrastructure Project and, if the Board approves the proposed grants, \nI, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the \nGEF grant. \n \n2.  The project will help Tuvalu overcome connectivity constraints between the capital and \nouter  islands,  and  promote  economic  and  social  development  that  is  more  inclusive  and \nsustainable.  It  will  improve  maritime  facilities  in  the  three  outer  islands  of  Nukulaelae, \nNanumaga,  and  Niutao as  well  as  strengthen  the  government\u2019s  capacity  in  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) and develop a transport sector master plan.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Regional context. Tuvalu is one of the smallest and most remote member countries of \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  Its  challenges  in  the  transport  sector  and  economic \ndevelopment come from its dispersed geography: (i) the country comprises nine atoll islands, \nstretching over 680 kilometers (km) in the southwest Pacific; (ii) it has a small and dispersed \npopulation of 10,100 as of June 2016,3 with over 6,000 people in Funafuti, the capital, and the \nrest spread in the outer islands; and (iii) the population of the outer islands is decreasing as a \nresult of limited economic opportunities. Tuvalu is over 1,100 km away from Fiji and more than \n3,000 km away from Australia and New Zealand. Internationally, flights to and from Funafuti \ndepart from and arrive at Suva, Fiji, twice a week, and a commercial cargo ship arrives in \nFunafuti once every 3 weeks. \n \n4.  Government shipping service. Domestic transportation depends entirely on the two \ngovernment-owned ships operated by the Ministry of Communication and Transport (MCT), \nwhich continuously travel between Funafuti, the outer islands, and Fiji to provide lifeline support \nto people in the outer islands by transporting necessary goods such as food and fuel, as well as \ntransportation to people who need social services such as medical care and education. This \nshipping service is critical for outer islands people, as the country has no other private shipping \nor civil aviation services. \n \n5.  Maritime transport challenges. The government\u2019s shipping service faces the following \nchallenges: (i) the two ships operating continuously can only reach each island once every                 \n2\u20133 weeks;4 (ii) no outer island has a docking facility for the government ships, and passengers \nand cargo are transferred by small workboats between the ship and the shore; (iii) transferring \nbetween  the  ship  and  the  workboats  is  particularly  dangerous  when  the  sea  is  rough; \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Outer Island \nMaritime Infrastructure Project (TA 8923-TUV), and a project design advance (PDA) grant for the detailed \nengineering design and assistance to the government for the procurement of civil works for the project and project \nmanagement (PDA 6003-TUV). Tuvalu is categorized a fragile and conflict-affected state. \n3  Secretariat of the Pacific Community-Statistics for Development Division (PRISM Project). Population Statistics. \nhttp://prism.spc.int/regional-data-and-tools/population-statistics (accessed 27 September 2016). \n4  These ships are 46\u201358 meters in length, with 583\u20131,043 in gross tonnage, and carry 200\u2013300 passengers and \ncargo. ", "2 \n(iv) workboats need to pass through channels, some of which are dangerous when the sea is \nrough  or  too  shallow  to  use during  low tide;  and (v) except for  Vaitupu,  Nanumea,  and \nNukufetau, the outer islands also lack docking facilities even for the workboats. In the past, \nserious  accidents  have  occurred  during  passenger  transfers  and  passing  through  the \nchannels,  resulting  in  loss  of  lives  and  economic  values.  Transfer  operations  cannot  be \ncarried  out  when  the  sea  is  rough  or  after  dark,  which  reduces  the  efficiency  of  ship \noperations. \n \n6.  On top of these challenges, Tuvalu faces constant and increasing threats of natural \nhazards such as tropical cyclones. For example, Tropical Cyclone Pam in March 2015 caused \nsevere flooding and erosion, and damaged maritime infrastructure in most of the outer islands. \nIn Nukulaelae, a ramp was damaged and the channel was silted. In Nanumaga, a ramp was \nwashed away. In Nanumaga and Niutao, the channels were blocked with boulders and sand. \nThe government, with the help of the United Nations Development Programme, prepared the \nTuvalu  Tropical  Cyclone  Pam  Recovery:  Vulnerability  Reduction  Plan.  Following  this  plan, \nvarious climate-proofing activities are ongoing in the country. At the government\u2019s request, ADB \nManagement  set  aside  $3.0  million  from  the  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  Disaster \nResponse Facility for Tuvalu, and this project  proposes to undertake further rehabilitation \nworks. \n \n7.  The government\u2019s priority. The Government of Tuvalu places very high priority on \nimproving access for the outer islands. The National Strategy for Sustainable Development, \n2016\u201320205 sets out the government\u2019s vision to make maritime transportation more efficient \nand  safer  to  (i)  enhance  economic  development,  especially  local  fisheries;  (ii)  improve \nlivelihoods and safety conditions in the outer islands; and (iii) reduce migration from the outer \nislands to Funafuti, which is facing urban problems of overcrowding, pollution, and spread of \ndisease. The government has requested ADB to finance the proposed project given ADB\u2019s \nrecent experience in maritime transport in the Pacific, including Papua New Guinea, Solomon \nIslands, and Vanuatu. The government is also seeking assistance from development partners to \ndevelop outer islands maritime facilities.   \n \n8.  Harbor development approach. While the most efficient and safest transfer operation \ncan be achieved by building harbor facilities that can directly accommodate government ships, \nwhich is the ultimate aspiration of all Tuvaluans, the construction of such harbors in all outer \nislands  is  estimated  to  cost  several  hundred  million  dollars.  It  is,  therefore,  necessary  to \ndevelop harbors in stages based on a long-term transport master plan. This will also help the \ngovernment to seek financing from development partners in a phased and prioritized manner. \nThe  government  prioritizes  Nukulaelae  as  the  first  island  for  construction  of  small-scale \nmaritime facilities, and Nanumaga and Niutao for minor rehabilitation of their boat ramps. The \nimprovement of transfer operations is also expected to help Nukulaelae\u2019s efforts to increase \nthe climate resilience of community infrastructure by making the transportation of construction \nmaterials  more  efficient.  This  is  timely  for  Nukulaelae  because  it  has  been  raising  all \ncommunity and private houses since late 2015 to prevent flood damage. \n \n9.  The total cost for physical improvements under the project is estimated at $10.2 million. \nWith a total population of about 1,400 on these three islands, the project carries a high per \ncapita cost. This reflects, in part, the significant remoteness premium involved in any investment \n                                                \n5  Government  of  Tuvalu.  2016.  Te  Kakeega  III:  National  Strategy  for  Sustainable  Development, 2016\u20132020. \nFunafuti. As of May 2016, the Tuvalu Infrastructure Strategy and Investment Plan 2016 Update is being prepared \nbased on Te Kakeega III to replace the previous Infrastructure Strategic Investment Plan, 2011\u20132015. \n ", "3 \nin Tuvalu because almost all construction materials and equipment have to be transported from \noutside the country. Nevertheless, without such investments, these communities run the risk of \nbeing increasingly cut off from the outside world. \n \n10.  Lessons from past projects. Some of ADB\u2019s maritime transport projects in the Pacific \nfaced issues such as delays in start-up activities, including detailed design and procurement, \ncost overruns, and difficulties in establishing satisfactory O&M arrangements. To prevent such \nissues under the project, the government has (i) established a task force at the project concept \ndesign  stage  and  a  project  management  unit  (PMU)  at  the  start  of  the  feasibility  study, \n(ii) established a deferred maintenance fund in 2015 to secure resources for O&M, (iii) used a \nproject design advance (PDA) to bring the detailed design forward and establish accurate cost \nestimates, (iv) prepared a procurement strategy to attract competent civil works contractors for \nbidding,  and  (v)  incorporated  an  institutional  strengthening  program  as  a  core  project \ncomponent.  \n \n11.  ADB assistance. Since 2008, ADB\u2019s country operations in Tuvalu have focused on \npublic financial management (PFM) with policy-based grants and technical assistance. With \nADB\u2019s decision to increase the ADF minimum allocation to $6 million per country from 2017, \nADB\u2019s operation in Tuvalu will expand to include vital infrastructure improvements. PFM aims at \nenhancing  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  public  spending  and  domestic  resource \nmobilization, including procurement reforms. The infrastructure improvement program finances \ncapital spending. Through PFM, ADB is also assisting the authorities to develop and strengthen \ninfrastructure maintenance financing. To date, ADB has financed only one physical investment \nproject in Tuvalu for the education sector, which was completed in 2011. This project is ADB\u2019s \nsecond investment project for Tuvalu. It is well aligned with the Pacific Approach, particularly in \nstrengthening  connectivity  within  the  country,  strengthening  climate  change  resilience,  and \nimproving people\u2019s access to social services.6 \n \n12.  External assistance. The government\u2019s request to ADB for supporting outer islands \nmaritime transport reflects the fact that most other development partners have focused on \ninvestments in Funafuti. No other development partners are involved in maritime transport. The \nWorld Bank has committed over $46 million in grants to Tuvalu since the country joined in 2010, \nincluding about $21 million to upgrade the international airport and $7 million to increase the use \nof renewable energy in Funafuti. Japan provided about $7.9 million to improve the Funafuti \nwharf, completed in 2009, and provided a total of $23.1 million for the two ships delivered in \n2002 and 2015. New Zealand provides Tuvalu about $10 million per year, with a focus on \nrenewable  energy  and  improving  climate  resilience,  water  supply,  and  the  borrow  pit \nreclamation in Funafuti. From 2008 to 2014, New Zealand provided assistance in outer islands \nmaritime transport. Australia provides about $7 million per year, with a focus on education. Most \npartners, including ADB, have worked together to provide policy-based financing to assist the \ngovernment\u2019s  reform  efforts  and  strengthen  PFM.  In  June  2016,  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme received approval from the Green Climate Fund to provide $36 million \nto strengthen coastal protection in three islands\u2014Funafuti, Nanumea, and Nanumaga. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The  impact  will  be  safe  and  efficient  domestic  maritime  transportation  that  helps \nincrease climate resilience of community infrastructure.

The government has requested grants not exceeding $11.3 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources, comprising $8.3 million from the ADF and $3.0 million from the Disaster \nResponse Facility, to help finance the project. The GEF will provide grant cofinancing of $0.5 \nmillion from its Least Developed Country Fund, to be administered by ADB.8 Tuvalu will finance \nabout $1.5 million of the remaining project costs consisting of land acquisition, counterpart \ngovernment staff, custom clearance costs, and taxes and duties (exemption).

Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The  government  established  a  project  task  force  in  February  2015  to  oversee \npreparation and implementation of the project, with the permanent secretaries of five relevant \nministries as members. The MCT will continue to be the executing agency for the project, which \nappointed its director of Marine and Port Services as project director in July 2015 on a part-time \nbasis and as the focal person for project management. The project director is assisted by the \nPMU, which has been operating since March 2016, with three individual national consultants. \nThese three consultants financed by the PDA will be reengaged by single-source selection \n(SSS) of individual consultants under the project, as the MCT has confirmed their satisfactory \nperformance. The project director and PMU will supervise and provide counterpart support to a \nconsulting firm and a contractor who will be engaged under the project.  \n \n18.  A project support and master planning consultant (including construction supervision and \ninstitutional strengthening) will be selected through SSS of the consulting firm that was engaged \nunder the project preparatory technical assistance and PDA in two separate contracts. The firm \nwas  selected  through  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  for  both  contracts;  it  has  been \nperforming satisfactorily and has had no integrity issue.9 The use of SSS is justified because (i) \nit is a continuation of assignments from detailed design and procurement assistance under the \nPDA to construction supervision and institutional strengthening under the project, as these \nassignments are usually packaged together in ADB\u2019s projects where a PDA is not used; (ii) the \nexperience acquired by the PDA consultant amid the highly limited connectivity to the outer \nislands communities will create a seamless and efficient transition from detailed design to \nconstruction based on the consultant\u2019s established trust and confidence with the outer islands \ncommunities; and (iii) the use of SSS will continue the consultant\u2019s professional liability with the \ndesigned facilities, avoiding misinterpretation of the design based on the surveys and analyses. \nAll  consultant  recruitment  under  the  project  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). All procurement of works and goods will \nfollow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time).10 \n \n19.  The project will be implemented over about 4.5 years and is expected to be completed in \nDecember  2020.  To  expedite  implementation,  the  government  has  requested  advance \n                                                \n9  The consulting firm has not been involved in preparing the terms of reference of assignments under the project, \nand will not be given additional major assignments through an SSS or a contract variation under the project without \ngoing through a competitive process. \n10 Since the project is financed with ADB-administered cofinancing resources, universal procurement will apply.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n20.  The construction of the small-scale harbor in Nukulaelae\u2014including channel dredging, \nconstruction  of trestle, breakwaters,  a  boat  ramp,  and  a transit  shed\u2014and the  boat  ramp \nrehabilitation works in Nanumaga and Niutao have been assessed as technically viable. All \nfacilities are being designed according to Australian and New Zealand technical standards to \nhave a design life of 50 years. Climate change impacts such as a possible sea level rise, an \nincrease in wave height, or an increase in the intensity and frequency of tropical cyclones have \nbeen analyzed under the climate risk vulnerability assessment and are being reflected in the \ndetailed design. The facilities are also being designed to minimize their impact on erosion and \nsiltation. While structures made of concrete and steel do not require significant maintenance, \nthe new channel dredged in Nukulaelae is anticipated to require maintenance dredging after \nevery major cyclone. Institutional strengthening of the government to enhance its O&M capacity \nis included under the project to ensure the sustainability of the project facilities. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n21.  The project will meet the basic needs of the people of Tuvalu, improve access to social \nservices such as medical care and education, and thereby improve the livelihood of outer \nislands people\u2019s life. The improved maritime infrastructure is also expected to help promote \nfisheries  in  the  outer  islands,  which  would  improve  their  health  conditions,  increase \n ", "7 \nopportunities for economic activities, and reduce the poverty and inequality of the outer islands \ncompared  with  Funafuti.  In  assessing  economic  viability,  standard  cost\u2013benefit  analysis  is \ninapplicable in the case of this project. This is because the small population in the target outer \nislands yields disproportionately low quantifiable benefits relative to investment costs. Instead, a \nbasic needs or basic public goods and services provision perspective is more applicable, which \ntakes into account that the without-project scenario would negatively impact livelihoods if the \npopulation is unable to import basic goods. Hence, a cost-effectiveness analysis is used to \nevaluate  the  project  from  an  economic  perspective.  A  cost-effectiveness  analysis  was \nundertaken for two locations in Nukulaelae: one on the north of the island and the other on the \nsouth. The assessment results suggest that the southern option is the most cost-effective. This \noption has the lowest capital and recurrent costs, and has the shortest travel time between the \nship and the shore. The southern option is also expected to be less affected by the current \nbetween the lagoon and the ocean. \n \n22.  The government\u2019s capacity to sustain the project outputs and shipping services was \nassessed as adequate, while this is not a revenue-generating project. Passenger and cargo \nrevenues do not cover O&M of the shipping service, including the project facilities, but the MCT \nhas been satisfactorily maintaining the ships\u2014avoiding any major troubles during operation to \ndate. The major incremental O&M associated with the project will be the maintenance dredging \nof a new channel after every major tropical cyclone, which has been happening about every \n10 years. Notwithstanding this, budget for major maintenance will be allocated on a yearly basis \nto ensure sufficient funds are available when a cyclone occurs. For this incremental major \nmaintenance dredging, which is estimated to cost A$100,000 per dredging, and other O&M \nrequirements, the MCT is expected to have sufficient revenues and budgetary allocations as \nshown in the financial analysis. It is also developing institutional arrangements to improve \ntechnical and resource capacities for O&M under the project. In addition, the government has \nbeen improving its asset management system with the help of development partners as part of \nPFM reforms. In 2015, the government started the deferred maintenance fund while an asset \nmanagement plan that will define how to use the fund has yet to be developed. The government \nand development partners are discussing the establishment of a disaster restoration fund. \nThese funds  are  expected to  provide  incremental funding  to  ease the government\u2019s fiscal \nburden. Since the government shipping services provide lifeline support to the outer islands, the \ngovernment will continue prioritizing budget allocation to sustain the shipping services. Coupled \nwith  the  institutional  strengthening  activities  planned  under  the  project,  satisfactory  O&M \narrangements will be established covering financial, technical, and institutional aspects. \n \nC.  Governance \n23.  Financial management. A project financial management assessment was prepared for \nthe MCT and the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, which indicated the overall \nfinancial  management  risk  as  high.  The  assessment  identified  the  following  key  risks: \n(i) inadequate accounting and claiming of project funds, (ii) incomplete auditing, (iii) delayed \nrelease of the government counterpart fund, and (iv) no internal audit function. Mitigating action \nplans  were  discussed  and  agreed  with  the  government.  The  government  has  provided \nA$15,000 as working capital for PMU operations, the use of which will be reimbursed by the \nproject funds for eligible expenditures. The PMU will scrutinize all invoices from the contractor \nand the consulting firm, and prepare withdrawal applications that MCT management and the \nMinistry of Finance and Economic Development will review before endorsing to ADB. The PMU \nwill  prepare  a  single  set  of  financial  statements  covering  all  financial  resources,  using \n ", "8 \naccounting  software.11 ADB  staff  will  provide  capacity  building  for  ADB\u2019s  disbursement \nprocedure  and  financial  management  for  the  government  staff  involved  in  the  financial \nmanagement from time to time. The auditor general, who was notified of the start of the PDA, \nhas confirmed that it will audit the project financial statements in addition to those under the \nPDA according to ADB\u2019s financial reporting and auditing requirements. \n \n24.  Procurement capacity. A project procurement risk assessment was completed for the \nMCT, the Central Procurement Unit (CPU), and other relevant offices. Overall, the procurement \nrisk  is  assessed  as  moderate.  This  improved  on  the  previous  assessment  of  high  risk, \nconducted before 2015, following the introduction of the Tuvalu Public Procurement Act (2013) \nand the Public Procurement Rules and Regulations, and the establishment of the CPU in 2015. \nTechnical assistance from ADB supported this legislation and institutional strengthening.12 As \nthe  experience  of  implementation  of  new  legislation  and  the  CPU  is  limited,  further \nstrengthening is required. As one of the on-the-job training opportunities, procurement under the \nproject will follow the newly established procurement processes with the help of an international \nprocurement specialist under the PDA. ADB staff will oversee procurement activities under the \nproject to ensure good governance. \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 7). ADB staff will provide strengthened oversight works and \ncapacity building assistance during project implementation to mitigate the risk of fraud and \ncorruption. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n26.  The improvement in maritime infrastructure will enhance access to essential services \nand economic opportunities among the outer islands communities. Safe and efficient movement \nof people and goods are expected to increase economic activities, particularly among small \nbusiness owners, and reduce migration from the outer islands to Funafuti. Poor and vulnerable \ngroups such as women, people with disabilities, and elderly requiring medical attention are \nexpected to benefit the most as they are particularly vulnerable to the safety risk of lack of \nharbor facilities in the outer islands. The project is proposed for effective gender mainstreaming, \nand a gender action plan (GAP) has been prepared. The GAP includes specific features to \naccommodate women\u2019s needs such as ensuring user-friendly design of the facilities and setting \ntargets for women\u2019s participation in potential employment during construction and awareness, \ntraining, and workshop activities. The MCT and PMU will implement and monitor implementation \nof the GAP. Intermittent international and national social development and gender specialists \nwill be engaged to assist in implementing the GAP. Awareness activities on HIV/AIDS and other \ncommunicable diseases will be prepared and implemented during construction. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n27.  Social  safeguards.  The  project  is  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement  and \nindigenous  peoples  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009). \nConsultations have been undertaken. The activities at the project sites will not involve any \ninvoluntary resettlement impacts. The construction of a small-scale harbor at Nukulaelae and \n                                                \n11 The PMU has started to use MYOB accounting software.

Technical Assistance to Tuvalu for Institutional Strengthening of the Ministry of Finance and Economic \nDevelopment. Manila (TA 8100-TUV). \n ", "9 \nimproved boat ramps at Nanumaga and Niutao will be mostly on government or community \nlands. The government will establish lease agreements with the landowners, in accordance with \nthe accepted and long-standing process for accessing nongovernment land, where private land \nwill be required. The government will comply with the negotiated settlement requirements under \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, will not expropriate any land if it fails to agree with the \nlandowner, and will comply with the negotiated settlement requirements under ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. The project is not expected to have adverse impacts on, or target any, distinct \nor vulnerable ethnic or tribal group. The project will be implemented in a culturally appropriate \nand participatory manner. An involuntary resettlement due diligence report has been prepared \nfor the project recording all these findings. The Land Department and the Ministry of Home \nAffairs and Rural Development have sufficient capacity to enter into the lease agreement for the \nproject  site  following  the  established  procedures.  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Public \nCommunications Policy 2011, the report will be disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. \n \n28.  Environment safeguards. The project is category B for environment. The impacts are \nsite-specific, limited to the footprint of the small-scale harbor (including channel) and associated \nland-side  facilities  (Nukulaelae)  and  improvement  works  at  existing  sites  (Nanumaga  and \nNiutao),  and  can  be  mitigated  and  managed  to  acceptable  levels  provided  the  measures \nidentified in the initial environmental examination (IEE) and environmental management plan \n(EMP) are implemented, and subsequently monitored and reported. A number of alternative \nlocations for the new channel at Nukulaelae have been considered, and the proposed option \nprovides the most suitable from an environmental (coastal processes, i.e., littoral drift, sand \ntransportation,  wave  climate,  and  marine  ecological)  perspective.  The  Department  of \nEnvironment within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Trade, Tourism, Environment, and Labor has \nadequate capacity to manage environmental issues with the consultant\u2019s support. The IEE and \nEMP will be updated during the PDA when further studies and detailed design provide additional \ninformation  (including  baselines);  existing  information  gaps  will  be  filled  at  this  time.  In \ncompliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy,  the  IEE  and  updated  IEE  will  be \ndisclosed on ADB\u2019s website. \n \n29.  The  project  will  provide  resources  and  support  to  ensure  that  safeguards  are \nimplemented  effectively.  A  project  support  and  master  planning  consultant  will  include  an \nenvironmental specialist to support the PMU and the Department of Environment to ensure that \nenvironmental safeguards are properly implemented and to monitor the contractor\u2019s compliance \nwith  the  approved  construction  EMP  during  construction.  The  contractor  will  recruit  an \nexperienced  environmental  specialist,  with  expertise  in marine  ecosystems, to  prepare the \nconstruction  EMP  (including  site-specific  plan  and  construction  methodology  for  temporary \nworking areas and/or platforms) and to monitor its implementation. \n  \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n30.  The project risk is assessed to be high. It is the second ADB investment project for \nTuvalu; the first project completed in 2011 was rated partly satisfactory at completion. The root \ncause of the risks is Tuvalu\u2019s small population size and the limited number of government staff \nwho have experience in implementing large projects; most government staff are also heavily \nloaded with routine assignments. Against these risks, the project team has developed sufficient \npreventive mitigating measures with the government, as summarized in Table 4 and described \nin  detail  in the risk  assessment  and  risk management  plan.13 The  integrated  benefits  and \nimpacts are expected to outweigh the costs.  \n                                                \n13 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nProject implementation capacity.
