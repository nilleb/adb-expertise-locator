THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Hubei Enshi Qing River Upstream Environment \nRehabilitation Project.1 \n \n2.  The  project  will  address  inadequate  wastewater  collection  and  treatment,  extensive \nnonpoint source pollution, and recurrent flooding that affect living standards and sustainable \neconomic development in the Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture (ETMAP) of Hubei \nprovince.2  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Located in the upper Qing River basin (a major tributary of the Yangtze River), the \nETMAP has an ethnically diverse population of 4.01 million. Because of its mountainous terrain \nand lack of connectivity, ETMAP\u2019s per capita income in 2012 was only CNY10,327, which was \nabout half of the provincial level; the poverty incidence is 40% in rural areas. The ETMAP \nincludes  two  cities  at  district  level\u2014Enshi  and  Lichuan\u2014and  six  counties,  which  are  all \ndesignated  as  national  poverty  areas.  In  addition  to  poverty,  water  quality  deterioration, \nriverbank erosion, and recurrent flooding are key factors undermining living standards and \nsustainable economic development in the ETMAP. \n \n4.  The Qing River is the primary water supply for Enshi and Lichuan and their surrounding \nrural populations. Since the 1990s, the water quality of the Qing River and its tributaries has \ndeteriorated. Monitoring data show that water quality in 45% of all cross sections is class IV, V, \nor below, meaning it is unfit for human consumption.3 Water pollution is most serious in Enshi \nand Lichuan, resulting in odor and eutrophication. Continuing deterioration of the water quality \nposes a public health threat for local residents, who rely on the river for their water use. In \naddition,  the  degraded  water  environment  threatens  Qing  River  riparian  and  aquatic \necosystems, and limits opportunities for ecological diversity and tourism-related recreation. \n \n5.  The major sources of pollution are untreated domestic wastewater, unregulated runoff, \nand  inadequately  treated  industrial  effluent.  As  a  result  of  prolonged  underinvestment, \nwastewater collection and treatment facilities in Enshi and Lichuan are seriously deficient. Less \nthan 60% of wastewater from Enshi and Lichuan is collected and treated because of the lack of \ntreatment capacity, aging pipelines, and incomplete coverage of wastewater collection systems. \nThis  problem  will  become  increasingly  serious  with  economic  development  and  rapid \nurbanization, as projected in the master plans for Enshi and Lichuan. Further, there are no \nfacilities for collection and treatment of domestic wastewater and solid waste in rural areas \nalong the Qing River and its tributaries. \n \n6.  Upstream of Enshi and Lichuan, the Qing River watershed is mountainous with high \nseasonal rainfall and rapid runoff. This, combined with inadequate flood management facilities, \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for preparing the Hubei \nEnshi Qing River Upstream Environment Rehabilitation Project. (TA 8424-PRC). \n3  Class IV is suitable for general industrial water supply and recreational use involving no direct human contact. \nClass V is suitable for agricultural water supply and general landscaping use. Below class V is unsuitable for any \nuse (PRC Environmental Water Quality Standard GB3838-2002). ", "2 \nresults in regular flooding.  Following national flood management standards, flood management \nfacilities in Enshi and Lichuan should provide protection against 20-year floods in the short term \nand 50-year floods in the long term. The existing facilities only provide protection against a \nmaximum of 4-year floods. There are some revetments along the banks within Enshi and a mid-\nsized  multipurpose  reservoir  on  the  upper  Qing  River.  However,  there  are  virtually  no \nrevetments or other flood control measures along the Qing River and its tributaries flowing \nthrough  Lichuan.  Since  the  1950s,  at  least  nine  major  floods  have  occurred,  resulting  in \nsignificant loss of lives and property. There has also been severe riverbank erosion as a result \nof high-intensity rainfall, loss of vegetation, and lack of revetment works. This has caused heavy \nsiltation of the river and blockage in urban sections of the Qing River and its tributaries, which \nfurther exacerbates flood risk and water pollution. \n \n7.  Lack  of  integrated  water  resource  management  in  the  Qing  River  basin  hinders  a \ncoordinated  and  effective  response  by  planning,  pollution  control,  and  flood  management \nauthorities to improve water quality and reduce flooding. Weak interagency coordination and \nlack  of  monitoring  and  enforcement  capacity  have  resulted  in  ineffective  management  of \nnonpoint  source  pollution  from  rural  and  urban  sources.  Important  rural  sources  include \ndischarges of domestic waste from unsewered rural households,  agricultural runoff, animal \nwaste  discharges,  and  erosion  of  riverbanks  during  high-flow  conditions.  In  urban  areas, \nunregulated runoff along the riverbanks also contributes to nonpoint pollution, including garbage \ndumped along the riverbanks and inflow of wastewater due to leaks, clogging, and misalignment \nof wastewater pipes. While the river embankment is a critical flood management facility, proper \nmaintenance of the banks would also help reduce nonpoint pollution. \n \n8.  Guided  by  both  the  national  western  region  development  strategy  and  the  Hubei \nprovincial 12th Five-Year Plan (2011\u20132015), the Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture \nGovernment (ETMAPG) is committed to reducing poverty, improving the water quality of Qing \nRiver, and advancing the ecological rehabilitation of the river and lakes. The ETMAP is covered \nunder the Water Pollution Control Plan for the Three Gorges Reservoir Area and the Upper \nReaches,  which  is  one  of  the  national  priorities  for  water  pollution  control.  The  provincial \ngovernment  has  formulated  and  approved  the  Qing  River  Basin  Pollution  Prevention  and \nControl Master Plan (2010\u20132020) and the ETMAPG has prepared the Qing River Near-Term \nFlood Control Master Plan (2013\u20132015),4 which was approved in 2012 by the Ministry of Water \nResources. To implement and complement components of these plans, the ETMAPG requested \nthat the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provide financial and technical support for water quality \nimprovement and flood management in Enshi and Lichuan. \n \n9.  With support from the central and provincial governments, the ETMAPG has taken the \nfollowing steps to implement the master plans: (i) incorporate water quality improvement goals \nin performance evaluation of local governments; and (ii) implement more than 30 projects with a \ntotal investment of CNY8 billion for sewage network improvement, solid-waste management, \nnonpoint source pollution reduction, river rehabilitation, and soil erosion control in 2014. \n \n10.  The project is consistent with the priorities of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u2013\n2015 for the PRC;5 the comprehensive reform agenda announced at the Third Plenary Session \nof the 18th Communist Party of China Central Committee;6 the strategic priorities of ADB\u2019s \n                                                \n4  The plan includes construction of the Yao Jia Ping Reservoir, which together with the existing Da Long Tan \nReservoir will provide greater flood regulation capacity for the upper Qing River basin. \n5  ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2011\u20132015. Manila. \n6  Passed at the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on 12 November \n2013. \n ", "3 \nMidterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020,  7  and  the  Water  Operational  Plan. 8  Environmental \nsustainability  is  one  of  the  three  strategic  pillars  of  the  country  partnership  strategy.  The \ncomprehensive reform agenda announced at the third plenum emphasized the need for better \nenvironmental  infrastructure  and  the  strengthening  of  institutional  development  and \nenvironmental services at the local level. \n \n11.  Past  ADB  interventions  in  water  resources  management  in  the  PRC  and  other \ndeveloping member countries include investment projects and technical assistance in flood \nmanagement, water supply, and wastewater collection and treatment.9 The following are among \nthe  major  lessons  learned:  (i)  the  benefits  of  (a)  adopting  an  integrated  approach  in  the \nwatershed, (b) incorporating nonstructural measures, and (c) incorporating stakeholder and \ncommunity  participation  and  public  awareness  raising;  and  (ii)  the  need  for  (a)  capacity \ndevelopment for project management, (b) effective project monitoring and evaluation, and (c) \nsustainable financing  of facilities  based  on  a  realistic  and  enforceable  tariff  structure.  The \nproject incorporates these lessons and includes a number of innovative design features in \nstructural and nonstructural components. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The impact will be the improved environmental ecological sustainability in the upper Qing \nRiver basin10. The outcome will be the improved river health and water resource management in \nthe upper Qing River basin. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n13.  Output 1: Wastewater management improved. The output will include improvement of \nwastewater  collection  systems,  expansion  of  two  existing  wastewater  treatment  plants \n(WWTPs),  and  construction  of  one  new  WWTP.  In  Enshi,  about  154  kilometers  (km)  of \ninterceptors and new branch sewer pipes will be installed; an existing WWTP will be expanded \nto provide an additional capacity of 30,000 cubic meters per day (m3/d); and a new WWTP of \n50,000 m3/d will be constructed and will meet class 1A effluent standards, including advanced \nsludge treatment and disposal capacity of 102 tons/day. In Lichuan, about 77 km of interceptors \nand new branch sewer pipes will be installed; pump stations will be constructed or improved; an \nexisting WWTP will be expanded to provide an additional capacity of 50,000 m3/d and meet \nclass 1A effluent standards, with advanced sludge treatment capacity of 688 tons/day; and an \nexisting wastewater treatment facility will be upgraded to improve the effluent standard from \nclass  1B  to  class  1A.11 Energy  saving  and  greenhouse  gas  reduction  measures  will  be \nincorporated into the operation of the WWTPs. \n \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2014.

Output 2: Flood management enhanced. This output will include (i) construction of a \ntotal of 66 km of river embankments with riverside amenities in Enshi, and a total of 49 km in \nLichuan; (ii) dredging of silted sections of the Qing River and tributaries to increase the flood \ncarrying capacity in Enshi (51 km) and Lichuan (30 km); and (iii) construction of ecological \nbuffer zones, including wetlands and amenity facilities, in Enshi and Lichuan. Pollution-intercept \nbuffer  zone  functions  will  be  incorporated  in  embankment  designs  including  vegetated \nembankments and constructed wetlands. Public amenity areas will be constructed along the \nrivers to (i) intercept runoff and reduce nonpoint source pollutants, (ii) renew habitats and \nrestore riparian ecosystems, and (iii) provide recreational space for residents and tourists. \n \n15.  Output 3: Water and environmental management integrated. This output will include \ndevelopment of (i) a 2-year pilot participatory program in Xinjie village in Enshi to reduce \nnonpoint  source  pollution  by  improving  farming  practices,  training  farm  service  providers, \nproviding subsidies for purchasing formula fertilizers and organic fertilizers, improving solid-\nwaste collection, and installing biogas tanks to treat animal waste; (ii) a riverbank maintenance \nprogram,  including  community-based  environmental  supervision  and  public  education  and \nawareness-raising initiatives in Enshi and Lichuan; (iii) a sewerage infrastructure geographic \ninformation system and asset management systems; and (iv) a flood forecasting and warning \nsystem and introduction of water-sensitive land use planning in Enshi and Lichuan. \n \n16.  Output 4: Inclusive capacity development strengthened. The project will strengthen \ncapacity and institutions for project management. It will include training, capacity building, and \nconsultant engagement for (i) effective monitoring and evaluation of project using the project \nperformance management system; (ii) institutional and capacity strengthening for operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) of the structural works; and (iii) resettlement and social monitoring.  \n \n17.  Special features and value addition. The project will demonstrate that international \nbest practices can be adopted in smaller cities in poverty areas and contribute to sustainable \nwater  resources  management  and  development  of  livable  cities  and  villages.  Successful \ntransformation of Enshi and Lichuan can be replicated by other smaller cities in less-developed \nareas. The ETMAPG is planning major investment projects to implement the master plans for \nQing River pollution control and flood management. In addition, the central government will \nallocate  sizable  investment  and  grant  funding  to  implement  the  Ministry  of  Environmental \nProtection\u2019s new policy to improve rural environmental protection. The activities demonstrated \nunder  the  project  have  the  potential  to  be  scaled  up  through  ensuing  local  and  central \ngovernment initiatives.  \n \n18.  A public\u2013private partnership (PPP) is under consideration for the O&M of the expanded \nLichuan WWTP. A memorandum of understanding was signed by the Lichuan city government \n(LCG)  and  ADB  on  expansion  and  O&M  of  the  Lichuan  WWTP.  The  PPP  will  enhance \ninfrastructure efficiency by ensuring that the plant is run by a skilled and experienced service \nprovider  with  appropriate  performance  incentives.  The  construction  of  the  WWTP  will  be \nundertaken  by  the  government,  and  O&M  will  be  tendered  as  a  concession.  The  LCG \nexpressed preference for a lease contract, which is one form of PPP. This could provide for an \nup-front payment from the lessee to the LCG to pay project development costs. The approach \nwill be suitable for replication in other infrastructure projects that generate user revenue. \n \n19.  Nonstructural and participatory measures are also introduced to complement structural \nmeasures. These measures include a village-based pilot program to reduce nonpoint source \npollution, a sewer infrastructure geographic information system and asset management system, \na flood forecasting and warning system, pollution characterization and management, community \n ", "5 \nenvironmental  supervision  and  flood  management,  a  riverbank  maintenance  program,  and \nwater-sensitive land use planning. The project design incorporates findings of an assessment of \npotential climate change impacts, and includes measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions \nin the operation of WWTPs, and to increase climate resilience of flood management facilities. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n20.  The project is estimated to cost $231.62 million (Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.  Base Costb    \n  1.

During project implementation, the PMO and \nPIUs  will  carry  out  day-to-day  project  management  and  implement  nonstructural \ncomponents  in  cooperation  with  other  government  authorities,  including  water \nresources, environmental protection, city management, Tunbao township, and Xinjie \nvillage. \nCivil works and goods  NCB (civil works)  19 contracts  $131.56 million \nICB (goods)  2 contracts  $18.54 million \nNCB (goods)  5 contracts  $4.43 million \n  Shopping (goods)  1 contract  $0.74 million \nConsulting services  Project implementation and  19 person-months (international)  $1.10 million \ninstitutional strengthening  85 person-months (national) \nsupport (QCBS/international) \n(80:20) \nExternal resettlement and social  25 person-months (national)  $0.19 million \nmonitoring (CQS/national)  \nInitial project implementation  9 person-months (national)  $0.06 million \nsupport\u2013project management \n                                                \n12 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nAspects  Arrangements \nand procurement (ICS/national) \nStrengthening nonstructural  8 person-months (international)  $0.76 million \nmeasures on Qing River  41 person-months (national) \nintegrated management (QCBS \ninternational) (90:10) \nRetroactive financing  The ETMAPG has requested retroactive financing and advance contracting. \nand/or advance  Retroactive financing will finance up to $20 million of eligible expenditures or 20% of \ncontracting  the total loan amount incurred prior to loan effectiveness, but not earlier that 12 months \nbefore the loan agreement is signed. \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2015, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed by \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CQS = consultant\u2019s qualifications selection, ETMAP = Enshi Tujia and Miao \nAutonomous Prefecture, ETMAPG = Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture Government, ICB = international \ncompetitive bidding, ICS = individual consultant selection, NCB = national competitive bidding, PIU = project \nimplementation unit, PMO = project management office, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n24.  The project technical designs are in accordance with PRC design guidelines and local \nregulations. After detailed examination of the project\u2019s compatibility with local conditions, it was \nconfirmed that technical feasibility is adequate. Capacity building will be provided to ensure \nsustainable O&M of project facilities. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n25.  The economic analysis indicates that the project is economically viable, with an overall \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  of  17.2%  and  an  economic  net  present  value  of \nCNY89.8 million.  The  rates  of  return  for  the  individual  outputs  are  10.6%  for  wastewater \nimprovement in Enshi and 14.9% in Lichuan, and 21.2% for river rehabilitation in Enshi and \n20.5% in Lichuan. Sensitivity analysis shows that the project is generally robust to potential \nvariations in costs and benefits. In addition, the actual economic benefits are likely larger than \nestimated as some significant types of benefits are not quantifiable because of limited data. The \nfinancial sustainability assessment for the nonrevenue suboutputs indicates that the ECG and \nLCG have sufficient funds to finance the counterpart contributions, as well as to finance debt \nservice and O&M costs during operation. During implementation, average annual counterpart \nfunding accounts for 0.55% of the projected revenue of the ECG and 0.67% of the LCG. The \nsum of annual debt service costs and funds required for facility O&M never exceeds 0.1% of \nprojected revenues from 2021 to 2034. \n \n26.  The financial evaluation for output 1 in Enshi and Lichuan confirms that it is financially \nfeasible, with a financial internal rate of return of 4.60% above the weighted average cost of \ncapital of 1.84% in Enshi and a financial internal rate of return of 5.00% above the weighted \naverage cost of capital of 1.72% in Lichuan, given commitments of the ECG and LCG to a \nprogressive increase in wastewater tariffs to achieve full cost recovery and to provide subsidies \nto fully cover funding shortfalls before tariffs reach full cost-recovery levels. The financial viability \nis generally robust. Adjustments towards full cost-recovery tariffs are gradual and full cost \nrecovery is achieved by 2026 in Enshi and by 2021 in Lichuan. The tariff affordability analysis \nshows that the share of income spent on water and wastewater at full cost-recovery levels is \nless than 1.9% for average-income households and less than 2.6% for low-income households. \n ", "8 \nNonetheless, the ECG and LCG have committed to (i) undertake periodic reviews of tariffs and \nfees following specified tariff setting mechanisms, (ii) assess the impact of wastewater collection \nfees and tariffs on the poor and provide necessary subsidies to ensure wastewater collection \nservices to the poor, and (iii) hold public tariff consultation hearings to consult with the affected \npeople when setting or adjusting tariffs for wastewater. \n \n27.  Assessment of the financial management capacity of the Enshi  Prefectural Finance \nBureau,  Enshi  Urban  Construction  and  Investment  Company,  and  Lichuan  Liangli  Urban \nConstruction  and  Development  Company  addressed  fund  flow  arrangements,  staffing, \naccounting  and  audit  policies  and  procedures,  and  financial  information  systems.  Existing \npractices are generally sound but lack of experience with ADB projects and foreign-funded \nprojects was identified as an issue. The executing and implementing agencies have agreed to \nthe  proposed  measures  to  strengthen  their  financial  management  capability.  The  overall \nfinancial  management  risk  rating  of  the  project,  after  considering  mitigating  measures,  is \nmoderate. The identified financial management risks will be closely monitored during project \nimplementation.13 \n \nC.  Governance \n \n28.  An  assessment  of  the  procurement  capacity  confirmed  that  the  executing  and \nimplementing agencies, acting through a procurement agency and with the assistance of ADB \nand the consultants, would have adequate procurement capacity to facilitate full compliance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Specific policy requirements, \ncapacity development, and other supplementary measures are described in the PAM. ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \nETMAPG, ECG, and LCG. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are \ndescribed in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n29.  About  70,900  households  will  benefit  from  improved  flood  protection  and  40,000 \nhouseholds from improved wastewater collection and treatment; approximately 6% of these \nhouseholds are poor. The project will create 6,300 temporary jobs during implementation and \n105 permanent jobs during O&M. Jobs created under the project will be preferentially offered to \nwomen and to people displaced economically or physically under the project. Focus group \ndiscussions found that environmental improvements are anticipated to have significant gender \nand poverty impacts, with reduced time burdens and costs for health care, preparation for \nfloods, and cleanup after floods.14 \n \n30.  The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. A gender action plan \ncontains activities to ensure project benefits contribute to improved gender equality in the \nproject area, including (i) women\u2019s participation in discussions on detailed designs, wastewater \ntariff  hearings,  community  activities,  training,  and  project management; (ii) job  creation for \nwomen; and (iii) inclusion of gender perspectives in capacity development of ETMAPG staff.15 \n \n                                                \n13 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

The  project  is  classified  as  category  A  for  environment,  and  an \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) and environmental management plan (EMP) have been \nprepared following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The EIA and EMP were disclosed \non  26  November  2014.  The  project  is  expected  to  have  environmental  benefits,  including \nimproved water quality of the Qing River in the project area, reduced flood risk, increased \nwastewater treatment capacity, improved sewage coverage for about 40,000 households, and \nimproved  water  resources  management  capacity  of  the  ETMAPG.  Potential  environmental \nimpacts are a result of the planned dredging and embankment work, and construction- and \noperation-related disturbances. During preparation of the EIA, consultations were conducted \nwith key stakeholders and the outcomes have been integrated into the project design. The \nETMAPG,  through  the  project  management  office  (PMO),  will  be  responsible  for  overall \nimplementation and compliance with the EMP. The PMO and implementing agencies will be \nresponsible for site-based implementation of the EMP. The EIA concludes that the anticipated \nenvironmental impacts and risks can be mitigated through the implementation of the EMP. \n \n32.  Climate change. An assessment of potential climate change impacts found the project \nat high risk for climate impacts, with an expected increase in temperature of 1.5o Celsius, higher \nrunoff,  more  variable  precipitation,  and  more  frequent  severe  storms  by  2031\u20132040.  In \nresponse, the project design incorporates adaptation measures, including a flood forecasting \nand warning system, community-based environmental supervision and flood management, and \nwater-sensitive  land  use  planning.  Measures  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  will  be \nundertaken as part of wastewater treatment standard operation practices. \n \n33.  Involuntary resettlement. The project is categorized as A for involuntary resettlement \nunder ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. It will permanently acquire a total of 73.15 hectares of \nland; an additional 145.28 hectares will be occupied temporarily. The project will demolish \n12,778 square meters of housing. It will economically displace 5,431 people, with 1,645 to lose \nmore than 10% of their agricultural productive assets and 143 to be physically displaced. The \nETMAPG prepared resettlement plans for Enshi and for Lichuan, in line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement and related laws and regulations of Enshi and Lichuan, Hubei province, and \nthe PRC. The ETMAPG will fully finance CNY132.61 million of land acquisition and resettlement \ncosts. The ADB loan will finance the costs for semiannual external resettlement monitoring and \nevaluation. The ETMAPG has experience in conducting land acquisition and resettlement for \nforeign-funded projects and has the capacity to implement the project\u2019s resettlement plans.  \n \n34.  Indigenous peoples. The project is categorized as B for indigenous peoples under \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The ETMAP has an ethnically diverse population of 4.01 \nmillion\u201445% of people are Han, 46% Tujia, 6.5% Miao, and 2.5% belong to other ethnic \ngroups. The  project  area  has  similar  levels  of  ethnic  diversity. The  ethnic minorities  have \nsocioeconomic and livelihood systems similar to the mainstream population in terms of income, \neconomic activities, and education, and no language or other cultural barriers were identified. \nThey will benefit equally from the project activities. To ensure the benefits are accrued by the \nethnic minorities, an ethnic minority development plan was prepared and endorsed by the \nETMAPG. \n \n35.  Grievance redress mechanism. A grievance redress mechanism to address social \nand environmental concerns of stakeholders has been designed and will be established by the \nPMO. The PMO will have final responsibility for handling any disputes within the grievance \nredress mechanism. The procedures are described in the PAM. \n ", "10 \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n36.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4, and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.16 Risk assessment for the overall project is \nmedium and the integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nImplementation delays  ETMAPG will hire a qualified tendering agent with ADB procurement experience. The \ndue to the limited  project will provide consulting services for technical support and on-the-job trainings on \nexperience of the project  procurement, disbursement, and financial management. ETMAPG has established a \nmanagement office and  good relationship with the project implementing agencies of other ADB-funded projects \nimplementing agencies  to gain knowledge on loan implementation. \nBuildings and  For buildings and communities where developers having legal title can be identified, \ncommunities are not  pipes connecting the buildings and communities to the sanitary sewers will be procured \nconnected to the new  and installed by the property owners or developers in accordance with a regulation \nsanitary sewers installed  issued by the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development. For other \nunder the project  communities, pipes connecting communities to the sanitary sewers will be installed \nunder the project and financed by Enshi and Lichuan. Both cities have provided written \nassurances to install all connections within 2 years following installation of interceptor \nand branch pipes. \nProject implementation is  This risk will be mitigated through the implementation of measures laid out in the \ndelayed because of  resettlement plan. A full-time resettlement staff member will be assigned to the project \ndelays in land acquisition  management office for the smooth implementation of land acquisition and resettlement. \nand resettlement  The project management office will conduct internal monitoring of resettlement plan \nimplementation and report to ADB through semiannual project progress reports. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ETMAPG = Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture Government  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n37.  The  government,  through  the  Hubei  provincial  government  and  the  ETMAPG,  has \nassured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all applicable ADB policies \nincluding  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement, \nconsulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \nThe government has also agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set \nforth in the loan and project agreements. \n \nV.
