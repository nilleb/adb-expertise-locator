In 2015, \nthe provinces had a total population of 2.36 million consisting largely of ethnic minorities with high \npoverty  levels.  Under  the  proposed  provincially  managed  multisector  project,  locally  prioritized \nbasic  infrastructure  subprojects  will  be  implemented.  The  subprojects  will  support  economic \nconnectivity among the provinces and improve the rural living standards of over 212,000 people \nthrough  better  (i)  interprovincial  commerce  and  rural  accessibility  by  upgrading  provincial  and \ndistrict roads, (ii) health through the construction of rural domestic water supply (RDWS) systems, \n(iii)  incomes  and livelihoods  through strengthened  agriculture  and  rural  value  chains  (ARVCs), \nand  (iv)  sustainability  of  provincially  owned  infrastructure  through  the  establishment  of  asset \nmanagement systems.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe overriding comparative advantage of the four provinces is the northeast geographic \nlocation, particularly with Cao Bang, Ha Giang, and Lang Son having extensive borders with the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The provinces are at the nexus of the PRC, with its vast market \nand  high  demand  for  Vietnamese  products;  the  Red  River  Delta,  with  Hanoi  and  its  strong \ndomestic market; and with the Hai Phong port link to world markets. The area is adjacent to the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB)-supported Greater Mekong Subregion North\u2013South Economic \nCorridor, including both the central and eastern subcorridors.2 In 2015, total PRC\u2013Viet Nam trade \nwas $96 billion, an increase of 15% over 2014, imports from the PRC to Viet Nam grew at 4%, \nwhile  exports  to  the  PRC  grew  at  49%. 3 Viet  Nam  continues  to  expand  trade  with  PRC  by \ndeveloping additional international gateways and auxiliary border crossings.4  \n \n4. \nThe  full  economic  potential  of  the  four  northeastern  provinces  is  not  yet  realized.  Viet \nNam\u2019s gross domestic product grew at an average rate of 6% per year during 2012\u20132016, with \ngross domestic product per capita reaching $2,108, however in the project area it remains about \nhalf the national average, at $1,160. The 2015 nationwide poverty level was 7.0% but the levels \nwere 17.1% in Bac Kan, 24.4% in Cao Bang, 24.2% in Ha Giang and 16.2% in Lang Son.5 Most \nrural communities in the provinces are weakly integrated into the mainstream economy and social \nservices. They remain highly vulnerable to changing circumstances through external shocks such \nas commodity price fluctuations and extreme climatic events, amplified by climate change trends. \n  \n5. \n\nThe underlying causes of low income and poverty in the northeastern provinces include:  \n\n                                                \n1  ADB.  2015.

Statistical Yearbook of Vietnam. Hanoi. \n\n\f(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nPoor  road  connectivity.  The  mountainous  terrain  makes  road  development \nexpensive. The road density averages 70% of the national average, with only 32% \nof provincial roads and 26% of district roads in good condition. The provinces are \npoorly linked to each other and to many rural communities; local enterprises are \nless competitive due to high input and output costs; and travel on the roads is long, \narduous, and dangerous. The national arterial road network\u2019s south\u2013north axis is \nmostly established, but much work remains to be done on the east\u2013west axis.  \nLimited clean water supply. Only 16% of rural households have access to clean \nwater,  in  contrast  to  the  national  average  of  45%.  The  generally  steep, \nmountainous terrain complicates water storage and distribution management.  \nLimited  value  addition  to  agriculture  and  rural  production.  The  provinces \nalready produce and could greatly expand the production of many high-value crops \nsuch  as  oranges  and  star  anise,  but  inadequate  basic  infrastructure,  weak \nproduction  organization,  and  limited  access  to  finance,  hampers  local  value \naddition from farm to consumer, constraining profits and private investment. \nWeak  infrastructure  asset  management.  The  piecemeal  development  of \nprovincial infrastructure assets, without proper management systems, has resulted \nin substandard public infrastructure condition, coverage and sustainability.  \n\n \n6. \nThe  project  will  help  unlock  the  development  binding  constraints  by  improving  basic \ninfrastructure  across key  sectors  following  with  the  Overall  Development  Plan  of  Mountainous \nNortheastern Provinces 2015.6 Stronger provincial integration into the national economy will be \nachieved by: (i) upgrading the road network to interconnect: provincial centers; the PRC border \ngates; the east\u2013west network with the main road corridors to Hanoi and ports on the east coast; \nand remote rural communities; 7 (ii) developing clean, dependable RDWSs to improve health and \nto support enterprise; (iii) increasing ARVC profitability by using modern technologies, building up \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and improving farmer capacity through (a) the use \nof funds awarded through competitive processes for SME development, (b) increased use of trade \npromotion,  (c)  developing  producer\u2013market  links,  and  (d)  establishing  larger  commercial-scale \nproduction  units;  and  (iv)  effective  provincial  asset  management  to  improve  the  performance, \nreturns, and sustainability of infrastructure investment. \n \nThe project is aligned with important government policies and strategies as expressed in \n7. \n(i) the 2016 Socio-Economic Development Plan 2016\u20132020, which aims to expand and promote \nexports  and  sustain  trading  surpluses; 8  (ii)  the  2013  Master  Plan  for  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment  of  Northern  Midland  and  Mountainous  Areas  towards  2020,  which  stresses  the \nbenefits,  economic  opportunities,  and  social  services  to  rural  communities  by  increasing \nmultisector public and private investments;9 (iii) the 2009 government transport strategy, which \nemphasizes corridor development and inclusive rural connectivity;10 (iv) the 2011 National Target \nProgram  on  New  Rural  Development  with  targets  for  rural  access,  RDWSs,  and  ARVCs;11 (v) \n\n                                                \n6  Government of Viet Nam. 2015.Overall Development Plan of Mountainous Northeastern Provinces of Viet Nam  to \n\n2020.

ADB\u2019s experience is central in guiding the decisions \nto  support  decentralized  government  in  defining  inclusive  development  through  feasible \nmultisector investments with the key features of: (i) provincial responsibility for project execution \nand financing -  by  borrowing  onlent  ADB  loan  proceeds.  ADB  inputs  reduce risks  in  provincial \ngovernance,  financial  management  and  sustainability;  and  (ii)  locally  integrated  multisector \ninvestments  support  inclusive  local  development  needs  and  economic  opportunities.  ADB  has \ndrawn upon specialists across its operations to ensure project viability and due diligence. Greater \nsynergies will be achieved with ADB technical assistance by integrating their activities directly into \nthe  project,  such  as  agriculture  competitiveness,  decentralized  public  asset  management  and \nroad safety.14 The project will coordinate with the International Fund for Agricultural Development \n(IFAD) on ARVCs.15 ADB\u2019s Viet Nam Resident Mission backed-up by ADB\u2019s technical divisions, \nhas experience and capacity to assist the government to overcome implementation challenges \nhaving recently administered in the project area projects such as Sustainable Rural Infrastructure \nDevelopment Project in Northern Mountain Provinces and Transport Connections in the Northern \nMountainous Provinces Project.16 \n \n10. \nLessons  from  ADB\u2019s  experience.  The  project  draws  on  lessons  learned  from  ADB \noperations, including the need to improve: (i) basic infrastructure and connectivity for economic \ngrowth, business competitiveness and integration of rapidly developing areas with disadvantaged \nregions;  (ii)  provincial  government  ownership  through  early  engagement  in  project  design  and \nmanagement;  (iii)  sustainability  by  including  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  and  climate \nchange considerations into investment strategies; (iv) promoting a more inclusive growth path by \nenhancing  ADB  support  for  SMEs  through  direct  capital  financing;  and  (v)  project  readiness \nthrough the preparation of additional feasibility studies, master bidding documents, and consultant \nsupport during the start-up phase to prevent delays and increase implementation efficiency.   \n\n                                                \n12 Government of Viet Nam. 2017.

The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome: \nproduction, service delivery, and movement of goods and passengers sustainably increased.17 \n \nC. \n \nOutput  1:  Road  network  connectivity  improved.  The  output  will  upgrade  about  121 \n12. \nkilometers of provincial and 144 kilometers of district roads, which will improve overall network \nefficiency  by  integrating  interprovincial  travel,  transport,  and  commerce,  as  well  as  improve \nconnectivity  with  PRC  border  crossings.  Many  isolated,  poor  rural  communities  will  be  able  to \naccess the transport network at lower cost, leading to both economic and social benefits. Reduced \ntransport costs and improved rural access will make SMEs more competitive, and enhance rural \ndevelopment initiatives. The improved network connectivity addresses significant barriers to the \ndevelopment of tourism circuits. Road safety will be included in subproject design, with about 44 \ntraffic calming measures forcing reductions in vehicular speeds at critical points, such as schools, \nand  13  safety  awareness  trainings  carried  out  for  vulnerable  road  users.  Output  1  will  benefit \napproximately 44 rural communities, comprising about 160,000 people in 27,411 households. \n \nOutput  2:  Rural  water  supply  improved.  About  ten  RDWS  subprojects  will  be \n13. \nconstructed  to  meet  the  2030  forecasted  demand.  Clean  water  will  (i)  improve  public  health, \nwhich is particularly important for communities located far from medical facilities; (ii) help develop \nARVCs, as clean water is needed to wash produce, and for creating sanitary conditions at an \nearly  stage  of  value  addition  at farm  and throughout  the  ARVC;  and  (iii)  increase the tourism \ndemand through more attractive facilities. Output 2 will serve about 22 communes, comprising \n42,300 people in 10,000 households. \n \n14. \nOutput  3:  Agriculture  and  rural  value  chain  infrastructure  in  Lang  Son  province \nimproved.  The  viability  and  incomes  of  local  rural  producers  and  SMEs  will  be  increased  by \nsupplying  high-quality  food,  spices,  and  flowers  to  (i)  international  markets,  (ii)  northern \nVietnamese urban centers, and (iii) local tourist sites. IFAD will continue its established program \nof ARVC support in the Bac Kan, Cao Bang and Ha Giang. While in Lang Son, the project will \nreplicate  proven  IFAD  models  to  support  horticultural  trade  and  marketing  organizations  for  at \nleast five commodities. It will introduce market-based business plans, provide viability gap grants \nto at least 30 existing value chain enterprises to leverage investment into value-adding technology \nand  infrastructure,  support  80  producer  groups  for  investing  in  market-linked  quality  control, \nproduction, and post-harvest infrastructure. Better transport (output 1) and clean water (output 2) \nwill  lead  to  competitive  ARVCs  in  all  four  provinces.  Output  3  will  directly  benefit  about  three \ncommunes comprising about 10,400 people in 3,000 households. \n \n15. \nOutput 4: Decentralized public asset management processes established. ADB is \nsupporting  the  national decentralized  public  asset management  program.18 The  provinces  will \nprocure asset management hardware and systems, and carry out associated staff training. The \nsystems will include indicators and tools to allow monitoring of annual maintenance budgets and \n\n                                                \n17 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n18 ADB.  2016.

Of the 11 subproject \nfeasibility studies prepared following the relevant Viet Nam design standards, nine were used as \nrepresentative  subprojects.26 Detailed  demand  forecasts  and  preliminary  engineering  designs \ninformed the road and RDWS subproject feasibility studies. For the ARVC subprojects, market \ndemand  was  confirmed,  value  addition  constraints  were  identified,  indicative  investment \npackages  specified  and  quality  control  standards  and  procedures  were  defined.  Technical \nguidelines  were  prepared  for  integrating  climate  change  risk  into  detailed  designs  for  more \nresilient infrastructure through increased flood elevations, improved cross drainage, and the use \nof bioengineering for erosion protection. For ARVC\u2019s the movement into safe food systems and \nstandards, drip and spray irrigation with organic fertilizer and backward linked supply contracting \nwill enable producers to adapt to climate and market risks.27 \n \nB. \n \nThe economic and financial analysis was carried out following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the \n 26. \nEconomic  Analysis  of  Projects,  comparing  with-  and  without-project  scenarios. 28  Financial \nanalysis  of  the  feasibility  studies  validate  the  financial  and  fiscal  sustainability  of  all  nine \nrepresentative subprojects.29  O&M was estimated for the economic life of each road subproject \nand  is  less  than  1%  of  current  provincial  O&M  budgets. 30  The  RDWS  subprojects  will  be \nprofessionally  managed  by  water  supply  companies  without  incremental  increases  in  fiscal \nresources and do not require a subsidy increase. The financial internal rates of return for RDWS \nsubprojects range from 2% to 3%, all above the weighted cost of capital. The ARVCs are fiscally \npositive  requiring  no  operational  subsidy  while  generating  increased  tax  revenues  through \nenterprise growth. The financial internal rate of return is 14% for the safe vegetable and 25% for \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n                                                \n23 Project Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Additional Subprojects Screening Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Using  loan  proceeds  from  ADB.  2012.

The provinces are heavily dependent on transfers from \nthe central government and the establishment of the asset management systems will improve the \nsustainability  of  provincial  infrastructure  assets,  and  the  loan  agreement  includes  a  covenant \ncommitting the government to provide adequate O&M for subproject investments. \n \n27. \nThe economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) for the road representative subprojects, are \nabove 10%, based on vehicle operating cost and time savings. For RDWS subprojects, the EIRRs \nare above 9% based on the willingness to pay by domestic, industrial, and institutional users, and \nthe  time  savings  and  health  benefits  for  households.  All  subproject  EIRRs  exceed  the  social \ndiscount rate of 9%, which is taken as the threshold rate. The EIRRs are estimated to be 25% for \nthe  safe  vegetable  value  chain  and  15%  for  the  star  anise  subprojects.  Sensitivity  analysis \nconsiders:  (i)  cost  overruns  on  investment  and  O&M;  (ii)  reductions  in  forecasted  demand  for \nproduce or services; and (iii) reduction in project benefits such as vehicle operating and time cost \nsavings, health benefits, and agricultural produce prices. Economic viability is robust against risks. \n \nC. \n \n28. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  identified  a  high  risk  for  the  executing  and \nimplementing  agencies  because  of  capacity  and  systems  constraints  in  existing  accounting, \nstaffing, auditing, and controls systems.31 Mitigation measures have been captured in the financial \nmanagement  action  plan,  to  implement  training,  accounting  systems,  and  external  audit \narrangements, and are supported by a covenant in the loan agreement. All procurement of goods \nand civil works and recruitment of consultants to be financed by the ADB loan will follow ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  have  been  arranged  considering  the \nlimited capacity for managing externally funded projects in the four northeastern provinces. The \ngovernment\u2019s public procurement regulations, as acceptable to ADB, will be applied for packages \nprocured using national competitive bidding and shopping procedures. \n \n29. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to, and discussed \nwith,  the  government  and  the  PPCs.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n \n30. \nThe four northeastern provinces have high rural populations (80%), of whom 88% belong \nto ethnic minorities, and have rural poverty rates ranging from 28% to 57%, being roughly equal \nfor  men  and  women.32 The  rural  people  often  have  limited  access  to  markets,  with  low  labor \nproductivity associated with smallholder farming. Paid employment accounts for limited lengths of \ntime,  ranging  from  25%  in  Bac  Kan  to  41%  in  Lang  Son.  Rural  migration  to  urban  areas  is \naccelerating, leaving an aging population and constraining future rural economic growth potential. \n \n31. \nGender. The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. A gender analysis \nrevealed  that  women  are  disadvantaged  in  participating  in  public  decision  making,  access  to \ninformation, training, and employment, while often carrying a disproportionate  work load.33 The \nproject  gender  action  plan  will  promote  (i)  equal  access  to  project  benefits  and  opportunity \nsharing;  (ii)  reduction  in  gender  inequalities  and  social  risks;  (iii)  increased  representation  of \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n                                                \n31 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nwomen in decision making, (iv) collection of sex-disaggregated data for benefit monitoring and \nevaluation;  and  (v)  the  role  of  women  in  ARVCs,  which  often  exceeds  50%  and  requires \nproportionately inclusive measures. \n \nE. \n \n32. \nIn compliance with national requirements and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), \nall PPCs and ADB have agreed on the project\u2019s safeguard categories and mitigating measures. \nADB\u2019s  safeguard  due  diligence,  gender  action  plan,  appropriate  community  consultations  and \nimplementation resources, are included in all representative subproject feasibility studies, which \nserve  are  as  models  for  succeeding  subproject  feasibility  studies.  ADB  will  only  finance \nsubprojects that are classified category B or category C for all safeguards concerns. \n \n33. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  PPCs  and  ADB  have  agreed  upon  an  environmental \nassessment and review framework.34 The road works are limited to upgrades within the existing \nor newly established right-of-way and environmental impacts will be minor and temporary. They \nwill  not  infringe  on  protected  or  environmentally  sensitive  areas  and  will  require  only  simple \nmitigation measures such as proper management of construction camps or storage of building \nmaterials.  Each  initial  environmental  examination  prepared  for  the  nine  representative \nsubprojects includes an environmental management plan with appropriate mitigation measures \nand have been publicly disclosed.35 \n \n34. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B).  PPCs  and  ADB  have  agreed  on  a  combined \nresettlement  and  ethnic  minorities  development  framework.36 Resettlement  and  ethnic  minority \ndevelopment plans were prepared for all representative subprojects. They are supported by public \nconsultation and information disclosure, which will be continued during implementation. The only \nimpacts  will  be  minor  land  acquisition  and  compensation  for  roadside  trees,  crops,  or  small \nstructures  within  the  rights-of-way,  for  which  compensation,  allowances,  operation  and \nadministration, surveys, monitoring, and reporting will be financed from government counterpart \nfunds. The internal monitor will ensure that any impacts are evaluated properly and reported to \nADB semiannually through the PPCs. \n \nIndigenous peoples (category B). Impacts on indigenous peoples, referred to as ethnic \n35. \nminorities  in  Viet  Nam,  are  overwhelmingly  positive  and  will  enhance  economic  and  social \nimprovement. The project will neither cause displacement from traditional or customary lands nor \nnegatively  impact  the  identity,  culture,  or  customary  livelihood  systems.  The  resettlement  and \nethnic  minorities  development  framework  will  ensure  the  inclusion  of  ethnic  minorities  within \nproject  benefits  and  provide  the  basis  to  prepare  subproject  resettlement  and  ethnic  minority \ndevelopment plans with impact mitigation measures, capacity development, a grievance redress \nmechanism, and compliance with ADB information disclosure and consultation requirements. \n \nF. \n \n36. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.37 \n                                                \n34 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 Initial Environmental Examinations for Representative Subprojects (accessible from the list of linked documents in \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\n36 Resettlement Framework: Resettlement and Ethnic Minorities Development Framework (accessible from the list of \n\nAppendix 2) \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n37 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n Table 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nAssets damaged by impacts of \nintensifying climate change. \nWeak financial management \nand procurement systems. \n\nRisks \nPremature asset deterioration.
