I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Second Lower Secondary Education for the Most \nDisadvantaged Areas Project.1 \n \n2.  The  project  is  a  continuation  of  the  first  Lower  Secondary  Education  for  the  Most \nDisadvantaged  Regions  Project,  which  has  been  successfully  implemented  and  will  be \ncompleted by the end of 2014. 2 The second project will help the Government of Viet Nam assist \nthe poor and near-poor through the enhancement of lower secondary education (LSE), which \ncontributes to an expansion of opportunities. As more than 50% of the poor population in Viet \nNam belongs to ethnic minority groups, the project will target the following three areas which \nhave  large  ethnic  minority  populations:  northern  midland  and  mountainous  areas,  central \nhighlands, and Mekong River Delta. 3 In addition, the project will target the north central and \ncentral coastal areas, which are frequently affected by typhoons. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Socioeconomic  context.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  economy  has  grown  robustly  since  the  early \n2000s, an expansion that has been associated with significant achievements in the Millennium \nDevelopment  Goals.  Consistently  strong  economic  growth,  together  with  limited  population \nincrease,  raised  per  capita  income  from  $390  in  2000  to  $1,596  in  2012.  A  survey \ncommissioned by the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs in 2013 found that poverty \nincidence in Viet Nam dropped from 20% in 2000 to less than 8% in 2013. 4 However, the \ndecline in poverty has not been uniform across the different regions of the country, and the \nincidence of poverty varies significantly across regions and among ethnic groups. Remote areas, \nincluding Northern mountains, central highlands, and Mekong River Delta; and coastal areas \nfaced threats of natural disasters, are considered particularly poor and vulnerable.  \n \n4.  Ethnic  minorities  and  education  in  Viet  Nam.  Viet  Nam  has  54  ethnic  groups, \nincluding  the  majority  Kinh  (Vietnamese);  ethnic  minorities  account  for  13%  of  the  total \npopulation. The ethnic minority groups mainly inhabit mountainous, coastal, and remote areas, \nwhich  have  a  complex  topography,  difficult  transportation  and  communication,  and  harsh \nclimates. Most ethnic minorities still depend mainly on agriculture for their livelihood. Paid jobs \nin rural areas are still limited by a number of factors, such as low level of education, less mobility \nand productive lands, limited Vietnamese language capacity, less market access, and cultural \nbarriers. The World Bank\u2019s Viet Nam Poverty Assessment, 2012 reported that, as of 2010, \nabout 66.3% of ethnic minorities still lived below the poverty line and 37.4% lived below the \nextreme poverty line, on average. In comparison, 12.9% of the Kinh majority population was \npoor and 2.9% lived below the extreme poverty line in 2010. 5 \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2007.

Viet Nam has expanded access to schooling and improved the quality of education. As \nindicated  in  the  Education  Development  Strategic  Plan,  2011\u20132020,  one  of  the  priority \nsubsectors in Viet Nam is LSE, which is considered a basic need for good quality life and labor \ncompetitiveness. 6 The government\u2019s Socio-Economic Development Strategy, 2011\u20132020 also \nrequests that the Constitution affirms the rights of minorities to education by providing support \nfor their children to obtain education relevant to their needs. 7  However, gaps remain in access \nto and completion of good quality LSE among different regions and gender. While the national \nnet enrollment rate (NER) in LSE already reached at 98% in school year (SY) 2011/2012, the \nNER in LSE was only 77.1% in northern midland and mountainous area, 77.7% in central \nhighland, and 73.3% in the Mekong river delta. \n   \n6.  Achievements of the first project. The first project primarily aimed to improve access \nto and retention in LSE in the 103 most disadvantaged districts of the poorest 17 provinces. The \nachievements of the first project from SY2008/09 to SY2011/12 are (i) an increase in the NER in \nthe project schools from 73.9% to 75.4%, (ii) a decrease in the dropout rate from 3.81% to \n2.71%, (iii) an improvement in the completion rate from 96.17% to 96.96%, and (iv) an increase \nin the promotion rate from 92.28% to 93.62%.8  \n \n7.  Remaining  and  new  challenges.  While  the  first  project  is  expected  to  be  rated \nsuccessful in achieving its project outcome, several issues remain and new challenges have \nemerged:  (i) the  access  of  ethnic  minorities to  LSE  is  still  limited  because  of the  lack  of \nclassrooms and semi-boarding facilities, as well as the lack of awareness among parents of the \nneed for education, particularly for girls; (ii) the LSE curriculum is irrelevant to the local needs of \nethnic groups, and the low quality of teaching and learning results in less motivation for ethnic \nminority students to complete LSE; and (iii) small lower secondary schools (LSSs) in remote \nareas  have  scarce  financial  and  human  resources,  which  makes  it  difficult  to  provide  (a) \ncapacity  development  opportunities  for  teachers  and  school  principals,  and  (b)  education \nfacilities such as libraries and science laboratories. \n \n8.  Limited  access  and  retention.  Although  the  national  NER  for  LSE  has  improved \nsignificantly,  it  is still  below  the  government\u2019s target,  partly  because of  the  lower  rates  in \ndisadvantaged areas. The NER for the target LSSs in the first project was 75.4% while the \nnational average was 81.4% in 2012 (footnote 3). Girls accounted for only 45.3% of the enrolled \nethnic group students in the project areas in SY2012/13, indicating a gender gap. Dropout rates \namong LSE students in disadvantaged areas are still high. In the disadvantaged provinces \nserved by the first project, the dropout rate in SY2010/11 of ethnic minority students was 4.5%, \ncompared with the overall rate of 2.7% in these areas. Commuting difficulties, demand on \nchildren to support their families, and early marriages all undermine the ability of children in \nethnic  minority  areas  to  attend  schools.  In  many  disadvantaged  areas,  the  percentage  of \ntemporary schools is still higher than the national norm. Boarding facilities for students, kitchens, \nand sanitation facilities in remote areas either do not exist or do not meet standards. \n \n9.  Poor quality and relevance of teaching and learning. While the performance of 15-\nyear old students in Viet Nam is high relative to many developing and developed countries,9 the \n                                                \n6  Government of Viet Nam. 2012.

", "3 \nachievement  of  disadvantaged  students,  particularly  ethnic  minorities,  is  much  lower.10 In \nSY2008/09, only 38.5% of grade 9 ethnic minority students achieved the acceptable standard in \nmathematics, compared with 62.2% for the majority Kinh student population. In physics, only \n44.4% of ethnic minority students achieved the acceptable standard, compared with 60.6% for \nKinh  students.  Only  31.0%  of  grade  9  students  in  the  central  highlands  area  achieved  the \nstandard in mathematics. The Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) is undertaking several \nreforms  to  perform  well  internationally,  while  better  addressing  the  needs  of  disadvantaged \nstudents.  The  reforms  include  improving  the  quality  of  teaching  methods,  upgrading  the \ncurriculum, and carrying out initiative designed to improve participation and achievement among \ntargeted student populations. MOET will adopt a new curriculum after 2015 in accordance with \nanticipated economic and social needs. This new curriculum framework will provide flexibility for \nregions of the country to develop programs that are relevant and suitable to their conditions. \n \n10.  Limited financial and human resources in remote schools. School managers and \nteachers  in  remote  areas  have  fewer  opportunities  to  exchange  and  share  professional \nexperience. They also lack opportunities to receive regular in-service training or to engage in \nself-development activities to improve their skills, particularly in science and math education, \nlanguage training, and extracurricular activities offered at school libraries, which can function as \nresource centers for ethnic minority teachers and students. Several remote areas are facing a \nshortage of LSE teachers, partly because of this lack of opportunity to improve their knowledge \nand professional qualifications. School-based planning and management capacity also tend to \nbe weak in disadvantaged areas. Moreover, the government\u2019s regular budgets and human \nresources to support improvements in the quality of LSE are insufficient in disadvantaged areas. \n \n11.  Government  development  plan  and  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy.  The \ngovernment\u2019s  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan,  2011\u20132015  focuses  on  the  needs  for \nrestructuring and reforming education. The government\u2019s Secondary Education Sector Master \nPlan, 2011\u20132015 to 2020 provides more details about how education will be reformed. Some \ninitiatives supported by the project related to the Socio-Economic Development Plan include \ndecentralizing the system, improving teaching methods, revising the curriculum to make it more \nrelevant and practical, and improving the poor physical condition of school infrastructure. In \naddition to these initiatives, the Secondary Education Sector Master Plan supports education in \ndisadvantaged areas, prioritizes services for ethnic minority children, provides semi-boarding \nfacilities,  supports  environmental  education,  expands  vocational  consulting,  and  develops \nminority courses in LSSs. The country partnership strategy of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) for Viet Nam, 2012\u2013201511 supports the government\u2019s initiatives, specifically with regard \nto ensuring inclusive growth by helping integrate the poor and other vulnerable groups and \nsegments of society in the development process and by enhancing environmental sustainability \nthrough well-planned and timely responses to environment and climate change challenges. \n \n12.  Lessons from the first project. In the design and implementation arrangements of the \nsecond project, lessons from the first project have been taken into consideration. These include \nthe following: (i) target identification in districts and schools, instead of at the province level, can \nreduce intra-provincial poverty; (ii) the definition of disadvantaged area needs to be expanded \nfrom  three  ethnic  minority  regions  with  high  income-poverty  rates  to  include  the  typhoon-\naffected areas, which are equally poor and vulnerable;12 (iii) the system to cascade teacher \n                                                \n10 Ministry of Education and Training (MOET). 2009.

Manila. \n12 Under ADB\u2019s project preparatory TA for the project, an intensive socioeconomic and educational survey was \nconducted for the selection of the target provinces, as outlined in the Selection Procedure and Criteria for \nBeneficiary Provinces, Districts, and Schools (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "4 \ntraining through core trainers, which was adopted under the first project, often diluted the impact \nof the new teaching method, and local LSS teachers want to receive training directly; and (iv) \nthe  school  feeding  and  scholarship  program  implemented  in  the  first  project  has  been \nsuccessful, and the government adopted this as a national policy and continues to implement it \nwith their own annual budget. Lessons from other ADB projects and other donor partners13 were \nalso considered during the design of this project.14 \n \n13.  Innovative  features  of  the  project. The project includes some pilot initiatives and \nconcepts which are new to Viet Nam or ADB-funded education projects in the country. Five new \ninitiatives include: (i) new regional competency-based textbooks will be developed to better \nmeet the needs of ethnic students; (ii) existing continuing education centers (CECs) will be \nrestructured from non-formal education centers to serve as new platforms for in-service teacher \ntraining  (INSETT); (iii)  a  new  system  of school  clusters  will  be  estalished  to  exchange of \nexpertise and experiences among teachers and managers; (iv) model libraries will provide \nvenues for extracurricular academic support and recreation for ethnic minority students as a \npositve alternative to drug and alcohol use, and to help reduce teenage pregnancy; and (v) \ntyphoon-resilient facilities and disaster management education will be provided to help reduce \n(a) school dropouts because of the loss of school buildings, and (b) the cost of maintenance or \nreconstruction of damaged LSSs borne annually by the poor local goverments.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n14.  The impact will be reduced disparities in socioeconomic development between regions \nand ethnic groups. The outcome will be more equitable access and retention of ethnic minorities, \ngirls, and disadvantaged children in LSSs in the northern midland and mountainous areas, \ncentral highlands, Mekong River Delta, and north central and central coastal areas, which are \nfrequently affected by typhoons. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n15.  Output 1: Increased access to lower secondary education and lower secondary \neducation equivalency program. This output will directly help MOET achieve the target NER \nby increasing the NER by 5 percentage points in the beneficiary districts by building necessary \nfacilities. The survey under the first project showed that the shortage of education facilities in the \nnorth and central regions is the major reason for low access, while families\u2019 low awareness of \nLSE and commuting difficulties are key factors that limit opportunities for children to attend \nschool in the Mekong River Delta. School facilities that are resilient to climate change impacts \nwill be provided, particularly in the typhoon-affected coastal areas. About 660 classrooms will be \nbuilt  and  furnished.  To  attract  qualied  teahcers,  about  250  teacher  housing  units  will  be \ndeveloped. To reduce dropouts from schools caused by long commutes from home by children, \nabout 350 new semi-boarding facilities and about 37 kitchens will be constructed. About 29 \ntoilets for LSSs and 57 toilets for semi-boarding facilities will also be provided. A behavior \nchange  communication  campaign  to  encourage  parents  to  enroll  and  keep  their  children, \nespecially girls, in school will be supported. The provision of toilet facilities will benefit about \n432,000 students through improved sanitary conditions in LSSs, thereby reducing the incidence \nof waterborne gastrointestinal diseases among students.15 \n                                                \n13  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 Lessons Identified in Independent Evaluation Department Studies and Project Completion Reports for the Design \nof the Second Lower Secondary Education for the Most Disadvantaged Area Project (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 Because information on the incidence of diarrheal diseases in the project provinces is lacking, an incidence rate of \n0.345% was applied in the economic analysis. ", "5 \n \n16.  Output 2: Decentralization of teaching and learning tools developed. This output \naims to improve the quality and relevance of LSE to meet the needs, as well as the social and \ncultural backgrounds, of ethnic minority students. This will lead to higher enrollment and student \nretention,  an  increased  promotion  rate,  lower  dropout rate,  and  increased  abilities  of  LSE \nstudents to make informed decisions regarding their further studies and career choices after \ncompleting LSE. The project will develop new regional competency-based textbooks in LSE \nsubjects to address the needs in disadvantaged areas. To meet the professional development \nneeds of teachers, 86 district CECs will be designated to serve as platforms for providing \nINSETT for LSE teachers.16 The project will produce instructional materials on the preservation \nand promotion of ethnic minority cultures and values. To help mitigate the adverse physical and \nfinancial  effects  of  natural  disasters,  instructional  materials  and  INSETT  on  disaster \nmanagement education will be provided. Vocational counseling services will be supported to \nmake students aware of alternative career paths, both within and outside their local area. \n \n17.  Output 3: New school clusters established. This output will help improve the quality \nof  LSE  in  poor  isolated  LSSs  by  networking  them  using  information  and  communication \ntechnology within school clusters. This will allow them to share the limited human, financial, and \neducational resources available in ethnic minority areas. This output includes the provision of \nschool block grants for better cluster management, improvement of science education, and \ndevelopment of model libraries within the school clusters. A system of about 344 school clusters \nand  teachers\u2019  networks  will  be  established  within  and  among  the  schools  to  encourage \ncooperation and exchange of expertise and experiences among teachers. To strengthen school-\nbased planning and management capacity and to reinforce cooperation among the schools in \nthe clusters, the project will pilot block grants by providing funds to about 100 clusters. \n \n18.  Output  4:  Project  implementation  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  capacity \nenhanced.  This  output  will  support  capacity  development  in  project  management  and \nmonitoring and evaluation to enable education managers in provinces, districts, and schools, as \nwell as staff of the central project management unit (PMU) and provincial PMUs in departments \nof education and training in target provinces, to successfully implement the project within the \navailable financial resources and time frame. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n19.  The project is estimated to cost $93.0 million (Table 1). Key investments of the project \ninclude: (i) civil works (45.1%); (ii) equipment and furniture (13.7%); (iii) staff development \n(11.5%); (iv) textbooks and instructional materials (6.1%); and (v) consulting services (5.5%).  \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan ($ million) \nItem    Amounta \nA.

In addition, existing prototype designs for classrooms, sanitation facilities,21 \nand teacher housing will be used.22 The room size for semi-boarding facilities for the first project \nwill be used. The proposed equipment will consist of teaching aids, such as computers and \naudiovisual  equipment  that  do  not  require  sophisticated  skills  in  terms  of  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M). \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n23.  Economic. The project will assist the government in creating strategic and long-term \nchanges to develop the country\u2019s human resources. Through project interventions, total LSE \nstudent enrollment in the project area will increase from 1,973,129 to 2,040,080 students, yielding \nan overall NER of 90%. The project is expected to improve the (i) future income-generating \ncapacity of LSE graduates, (ii) management of LSE schools, (iii) sanitation and hygiene in LSSs, \nand (iv) climate resilience in typhoon-affected coastal areas.

", "8 \nof return (EIRR) was estimated at 19.9%, well above the economic opportunity cost of investment \nof 12%, indicating that the project is economically viable.23 The project is also considered to be \nresource-efficient based on its benefit\u2013cost ratio of 1.2, which is greater than 1. The sensitivity \nanalysis  indicated  that  the  EIRR  is  sensitive  to  changes  in  costs  and  enrollment,  as  the \nsensitivity indicator values for these change variables are significantly greater than 1. Switching \nvalues confirmed the sensitivity of EIRR to changes in cost and enrollment variables.  \n  \n24.  Financial. Financial analysis24 confirmed that the government has adequate financial \nresources and will be able to fulfill all its financial obligations under the project. Total project \ncosts are significantly less than 1% of total annual LSE expenditure. Further analysis showed \nthat the government, as the borrower, is capable of covering both annual O&M costs and debt \nservice  requirements  beyond  the  project  implementation  period.  As  a  proportion  of  total \ngovernment annual expenditure, annual O&M costs and debt service will account for at most \n0.018% in 2020, when amortization payments on the ADB loan are expected to begin. This is \nprojected to decrease to 0.009% in 2025. Total annual O&M costs and debt service are likewise \nsignificantly below 0.1% as a portion of total government annual education expenditure and \nannual LSE expenditure. \nC.  Governance \n \n25.  Financial  management  and  procurement  capacity  assessment.  The  financial \nmanagement assessment confirmed that MOET and key implementing agencies have sufficient \ncapacity for project implementation. The project will involve MOET\u2019s departments of secondary \neducation;  planning  and  finance;  and  education  facilities,  equipment,  and  children\u2019s  toys. \nThrough their involvement in all previous successfully implemented ADB-funded secondary \neducation  projects,  these  departments  are  experienced  in  ADB  procedures. 25  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in \nthe PAM. The procurement capacity of the central PMU and the 28 provincial PMUs was \nassessed and the findings are in Appendix 3 of the PAM. A combination of tailored training, \nconstruction  quality  audits,  and  prior  review  will  be  used  to  strengthen  capacity  for  four \nprovincial PMUs with limited capabilities. Procurement data from the first project was analyzed \nto assess the performance of 12 provincial PMUs that will procure works contracts under the \nproject.26 The risk assessment and risk management plan outlines how to mitigate such risks \nthrough  targeted  advertising  of  opportunities,  business  outreach  events,  effective  bidder \ncomplaint handling, and selective prior review for five other provincial PMUs where collusion \nrisks are pronounced. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social27 \n \n26.

A gender analysis and gender action plan (GAP) has been prepared.29 The GAP aims to \nnarrow gender disparities and among ethnic minority girls. The GAP will ensure that (i) 50% of \nthe semi-boarding spaces are allocated to female students; (ii) 50% of the teacher housing are \nallocated to female teachers; (iii) 100% of female and male teachers in project schools are \ntrained  on  the  new  curriculum  in  key  subject  areas;  (iv)  new  instructional  materials  and \ntextbooks  are  gender-sensitive;  (v)  100%  of  female  education  managers  are  trained  on \nmanaging the school clusters; (vi) the school performance monitoring systems will report sex-\ndisaggregated data on access, reduction of dropouts, and completion of LSE in project areas; \nand (vii) progress updates on the GAP are reported on a biannual basis to ADB. \n \nE.  Safeguards 30 \n \n27.  Involuntary resettlement. The project is classified as B for involuntary resettlement. \nCivil works will be done inside the compounds of existing LSSs, and land acquisition is unlikely. \nIf some facilities require land, it will be minimal because of the nature of the civil works. Facilities \nthat will involve significant land acquisition or resettlement impacts will not be considered for the \nproject. Initial screening of the 200 shortlisted LSSs for the construction of additional facilities \ndid not identify any land acquisition or resettlement impacts. This will be confirmed when the \nshortlist  of  LSSs  and  facilities  to  be  constructed  has  been  finalized  and  approved.  A \nresettlement and ethnic minority development framework was prepared to guide field-based \nscreening of each of the proposed facilities and LSSs. Measures to address potential land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts, as well as adverse impacts on ethnic minorities, have \nbeen identified and included in the framework. \n \n28.  Indigenous  people  (ethnic  minority  groups).  The  project  is  classified  as  B  for \nindigenous people safeguards. The proportion of ethnic minority population is one of the criteria \nused for selecting the districts to be included in the project. Measures to benefit ethnic minorities \nin the project areas include (i) constructing additional educational facilities in ethnic minority \nareas; (ii) encouraging ethnic minority parents to enroll their children in LSSs; (iii) developing \nregional textbooks suitable to the needs of ethnic minority students; (iv) producing instructional \nmaterials on promotion of  ethnic minority cultures; (v) providing vocational counseling and \nguidance suitable for ethnic minority areas; and (vi) establishing teacher networks in ethnic \nminority areas. Adverse impacts on ethnic minorities are not anticipated. Minor impacts, if any, \nwill be limited to loss of land in the unlikely event that a facility will have to be constructed \nbeyond  the  existing  LSS  compounds.  The  resettlement  and  ethnic  minority  development \nframework  describes the  project  elements  that  benefit  ethnic minorities  and  will  guide  the \nscreening of any site-specific adverse impacts of facilities on ethnic minorities. \n \n29.  Environment. The project is classified as environment category C. The construction of \nadditional school facilities will have limited adverse impacts in the form of noise, dust, vegetation \nremoval and clearance, localized erosion and sedimentation, and waste disposal. \n \n \n \n                                                \n28 Government of Viet Nam. 2013. 2012 Statistics Yearbook of Viet Nam.
