This increased operational capacity will enhance GRIL\u2019s \nability to execute its order book, and thus support the investment plans of the Government of India \nin the roads subsector. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \nProject identification. India has the second largest road network in the world,  totaling \n3. \n5.48 million kilometers (km). Road is the most common mode of transportation and accounts for \nabout  86%  of  passenger  traffic  and  68%  of  freight  traffic.  In  India,  the  120,543  km  of  national \nhighways constitute 2% of the road network but carry about 40% of the total road traffic. This has \nrequired  the  government  to  come  up  with  a  comprehensive  development  plan  for  the  national \nhighways network in India.1 \n \n4. \nThe National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), the nodal agency under the Ministry of \nRoad Transport and Highways (MORTH), is responsible for building, maintaining, and upgrading \nnational  highways  in  India. To  develop  the  national  highways  network, the  NHAI  launched the \nNational Highways Development Project in December 2000. The project consisted of upgrading \nover 48,589 km of national highways at a cost of $31.6 billion. As of September 2018, 25,641 km \nof national highways had been upgraded and 9,575 km were under implementation. In 2018, the \ngovernment  ended  the  National  Highways  Development  Project,  and  included  the  national \nhighways that were still under implementation as part of the larger Bharatmala Pariyojana Project \n(footnote 1). \n \n5. \nThe NHAI has widely involved the private sector in the development of national highways. \nProjects have been awarded to private companies either on an EPC or build\u2013operate\u2013transfer \n(BOT) basis under the BOT toll model, the BOT annuity model, or the newly introduced hybrid \nannuity model (HAM). The concession framework for BOT projects (prior to the HAM concession \nframework) did not outline clear implementation of the remedial measures to be undertaken for \ndelays  in  land  acquisition  and  receipt  of  approvals  for  projects.  Although  land  acquisition  and \napprovals  were  the  NHAI\u2019s  responsibility,  these  invariably  faced  delays.  This  led  to  delays  in \nimplementation and projects becoming unviable because of increased project costs, resulting in \nfinancial  stress  for  the  developers.  In  the  initial  years  of  public\u2013private  partnership  framework \nimplementation in the roads subsector, there was insufficient data for accurate traffic forecasting, \nresulting  in  traffic  being  overestimated  in  many  cases.  Actual  debt  service  coverage  ratios  of \nprojects were lower than projected, resulting in projects facing financial stress. Resultant stress \n\n                                                \n1  CRISIL Research. 2019. Industry, Roads and Highways, Our View. New Delhi. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fon debt service led to an increase in nonperforming assets of banks. Because of these legacy \nissues,  developers  are  reluctant  to  bid,  and  banks  are  increasingly  reluctant  to  lend  to  BOT \nprojects.  To  revive  private  sector  interest  in  highways  development,  the  NHAI  has  developed \nnewer concession frameworks such as HAM. \n \n6. \nThe Bharatmala Pariyojana Project is a new program that focuses on optimizing efficiency \nof freight and passenger movement across India by bridging critical infrastructure gaps through \neffective capacity enhancements.2 The project envisages construction of 65,000 km of highways, \nincluding national corridors (north\u2013south, east\u2013west, and the \u201cgolden quadrilateral\u201d),3 economic \ncorridors,  intercorridor  roads,  feeder  roads,  international  connectivity,  border  roads,  coastal \nroads,  port  connectivity  roads,  and  expressways.  The  expected  investment  for  phase  1  of  the \nBharatmala Pariyojana Project, which includes the upgrade of 34,800 km of the road network by \nfiscal year (FY) 2022, is $77.0 billion.4 In addition to the Bharatmala Pariyojana Project, 48,877 \nkm  of  projects  under  other  ongoing  schemes,  with  estimated  spending  of  $22.6  billion,  are \nexpected to be awarded by FY2022.5 The NHAI is expected to award 4,500 km\u20135,000 km of roads \nto  the  private  sector  for  enhancement  annually  from  FY2020-FY2023.  This  would  be  a  mix  of   \ntwo-, four-, six-, and eight-lane roads. Greenfield expressways, particularly in Maharashtra and \nUttar  Pradesh  states,  are  under  planning  and  implementation.  The  mode  of  award  for  private \nsector participation is expected to be a mix of EPC, BOT toll, and HAM projects. \n \n7.  \n\n(Confidential information redacted).  \n \n(Confidential information redacted).  \n\n8.  \n \nBorrower.

ADB\u2019s \nreview of the entity does not give ADB cause to believe that it is being used for money laundering \nor terrorism financing. Tax integrity due diligence was not required. It is noted that GRIL has been \nawarded previous ADB funded projects and is likely to bid on future ADB sovereign projects. In \nline with ADB\u2019s standard practice for procurement in all sovereign projects, all award decisions \nto  be made in any potential procurement would independently rest with the executing agency, \nand need to be completely aligned with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from \ntime to time) and the Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time \nto time).

The project, through its support \nfor  enhancement  of  connectivity,  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  with  respect  to  the \nfollowing  operational  priorities:  promoting  rural  development,  making  cities  more  livable,  and \naddressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities.7 The  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy, 2018\u20132022 for India, specifically  with pillar 2\u2014providing inclusive \naccess to infrastructure networks and social services by improving the infrastructure bottlenecks \nin lagging regions.8 \n \n20. \nConsistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \nconsistent  with  the  following  elements  of  the  Sustainable  Transport  Initiative  of  the  Transport \nSector  Group:  scaling  up  urban  transport,  improving  cross-border  transport  and  logistics,  and \nsupporting road safety and social sustainability.9 \n \nLessons  from  previous  operations.

GRIL \nhas thus far largely managed this risk through a proactive backward integration strategy by way \nof in-house sourcing of key raw material, and several efficiency-improvement measures to avoid \nor  reduce  the  impact  of  increase  in  cost  of  material  and  equipment.  The  risk  of  delay  in  land \nacquisition  resulting  in  cost  overrun  is  also  mitigated  by  the  recently  rolled  out  models  of \nconcession  structures  in  India  -  which  ensures  substantial  part  of  land  acquisition  prior  to \nconstruction \u2013 and allows for descoping of the project in case land is not handed over in a timely \nmanner.    \n \nD. \n \n22.  \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\n(Confidential information redacted).  \n \n(Confidential information redacted).  \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n(Confidential information redacted). \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\n(Confidential information redacted). \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \nADB  will  invest  up  to  $23  million  in  Indian  rupee  equivalent  by  subscribing  to  secured \n26. \nunlisted nonconvertible debentures issued by GRIL.

The environmental impact \nis expected to be minimal. No involuntary resettlement impacts or impacts on indigenous peoples \nare envisaged as a result of ADB\u2019s investment and use of proceeds. \n \n33. \nADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social \nimpacts of the project and considers that there are minimal or no adverse impacts from the project. \nGRIL  has  commissioned  an  independent  corporate  audit  of  the  company\u2019s  environmental  and \nsocial management system and an environment and social compliance audit of the company\u2019s \npresent  and  past  performance  as  per  Safeguard  Requirement  4  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement. The corporate audit assessed that the company follows the statutory requirements. \nThe current environmental and social systems, processes, and practices of the company were \nalso commensurate with the regulatory requirements governing its business and operations.12 \n \n34. \nThe corporate audit found that, although the company has existing environmental, health \nand  safety,  human  resource  and  social,  and/or  corporate  social  responsibility  policies  and \nprocedures,  there  is  a  need  to  strengthen,  integrate,  formalize,  and  document  the  different \nprocedures  and  processes  into  one  corporate  policy  or  procedure. GRIL  plans to  develop  and \nimplement  an  integrated  management  system  (covering  environment,  health  and  safety,  and \nquality) to bring consistency in approach and outcomes across its different operations. GRIL will \n(i) apply ADB's prohibited investment activities list, and (ii) ensure that investments using ADB \nfunds comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and abide by national laws and regulations. \nThese and other audit findings and recommendations have been documented and agreed on in \na corrective action plan which will be implemented by GRIL. The company will also report annually \nto ADB on the utilization of ADB proceeds and compliance with the agreed corrective action plan. \n \n35. \nSome gender elements. The investment is proposed to be categorized as  possessing \nsome gender mainstreaming elements. GRIL commits to implement measures to promote gender \nequality and/or women\u2019s empowerment in its business activities following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender \nand  Development.13 These  measures  are  (i)  committing  to  increase  the  employment  levels  of \nwomen in the corporate office by 50% by FY2023 (i.e., from 11.6% to 17.5% of total corporate \noffice workforce); (ii) working with the local community organizations to design and implement a \ntargeted corporate social responsibility program that will promote gender equality and women\u2019s \n                                                \n11 ADB.
