I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed senior \nsecured debt financing facility of up to $23,000,000 in Indian rupee equivalent into nonconvertible \ndebentures being issued by GR Infraprojects Limited (GRIL) for the Highway Equipment Finance \nProject in India. \n \n2.  GRIL, which is an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor and \ndeveloper of roads and highways, intends to use this funding to purchase new construction \nequipment and machinery. The project will help increase GRIL\u2019s execution capacity, and the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) funding will  enable the company to access medium term \nfinancing in a domestic environment where such financing is becoming scarce for companies \noperating in core infrastructure sectors. This increased operational capacity will enhance GRIL\u2019s \nability to execute its order book, and thus support the investment plans of the Government of India \nin the roads subsector. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n3.  Project identification. India has the second largest road network in the world, totaling \n5.48 million kilometers (km). Road is the most common mode of transportation and accounts for \nabout 86% of passenger traffic and 68% of freight traffic. In India, the 120,543 km of national \nhighways constitute 2% of the road network but carry about 40% of the total road traffic. This has \nrequired the government to come up with a comprehensive development plan for the national \nhighways network in India.1 \n \n4.  The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), the nodal agency under the Ministry of \nRoad Transport and Highways (MORTH), is responsible for building, maintaining, and upgrading \nnational highways in India. To develop the national highways network, the NHAI launched the \nNational Highways Development Project in December 2000. The project consisted of upgrading \nover 48,589 km of national highways at a cost of $31.6 billion. As of September 2018, 25,641 km \nof national highways had been upgraded and 9,575 km were under implementation. In 2018, the \ngovernment  ended  the National  Highways  Development  Project,  and  included  the  national \nhighways that were still under implementation as part of the larger Bharatmala Pariyojana Project \n(footnote 1). \n \n5.  The NHAI has widely involved the private sector in the development of national highways. \nProjects have been awarded to private companies either on an EPC or build\u2013operate\u2013transfer \n(BOT) basis under the BOT toll model, the BOT annuity model, or the newly introduced hybrid \nannuity model (HAM). The concession framework for BOT projects (prior to the HAM concession \nframework) did not outline clear implementation of the remedial measures to be undertaken for \ndelays in land acquisition and receipt of approvals for projects. Although land acquisition and \napprovals were the NHAI\u2019s responsibility, these invariably faced delays. This led to delays in \nimplementation and projects becoming unviable because of increased project costs, resulting in \nfinancial stress for the developers. In the initial years of public\u2013private partnership framework \nimplementation in the roads subsector, there was insufficient data for accurate traffic forecasting, \nresulting in traffic being overestimated in many cases. Actual debt service coverage ratios of \nprojects were lower than projected, resulting in projects facing financial stress. Resultant stress \n                                                \n1  CRISIL Research. 2019. Industry, Roads and Highways, Our View. New Delhi. \n ", "2 \non debt service led to an increase in nonperforming assets of banks. Because of these legacy \nissues, developers are reluctant to bid, and banks are increasingly reluctant to lend to BOT \nprojects. To revive private sector interest in highways development, the NHAI has developed \nnewer concession frameworks such as HAM. \n \n6.  The Bharatmala Pariyojana Project is a new program that focuses on optimizing efficiency \nof freight and passenger movement across India by bridging critical infrastructure gaps through \neffective capacity enhancements.2 The project envisages construction of 65,000 km of highways, \nincluding national corridors (north\u2013south, east\u2013west, and the \u201cgolden quadrilateral\u201d),3 economic \ncorridors, intercorridor roads, feeder roads, international connectivity, border roads, coastal \nroads, port connectivity roads, and expressways. The expected investment for phase 1 of the \nBharatmala Pariyojana Project, which includes the upgrade of 34,800 km of the road network by \nfiscal year (FY) 2022, is $77.0 billion.4 In addition to the Bharatmala Pariyojana Project, 48,877 \nkm of projects under other ongoing schemes, with estimated spending of $22.6 billion, are \nexpected to be awarded by FY2022.5 The NHAI is expected to award 4,500 km\u20135,000 km of roads \nto the private sector for enhancement annually from FY2020-FY2023. This would be a mix of   \ntwo-, four-, six-, and eight-lane roads. Greenfield expressways, particularly in Maharashtra and \nUttar Pradesh states, are under planning and implementation. The mode of award for private \nsector participation is expected to be a mix of EPC, BOT toll, and HAM projects. \n \n7.   (Confidential information redacted).  \n \n8.

The principal business operations are divided \ninto three categories: (i) civil construction, under which GRIL provides EPC services to the \nhighways subsector; (ii) development and ownership of roads and highways on a BOT basis; and \n(iii) manufacturing of inputs used in highways construction. \n \n10.   (Confidential information redacted).  \n \n11.  Integrated business model. GRIL benefits from backward integration into manufacturing \nof various inputs used in road construction and owning a strong fleet of equipment and vehicles, \nwhich reduces dependence on third-party suppliers. GRIL has also set up a central procurement \nteam that procures major materials and engineering items required for its projects. This integrated \nbusiness model facilitates the timely execution of projects. (Confidential information redacted). \n \n12.   (Confidential information redacted).  \n \n13.

Integrity due diligence was conducted.6 No significant or potentially significant integrity \nrisks were identified in the project. The beneficial owners do not appear to constitute a potentially \nsignificant integrity risk, in the absence of any unresolved or unsubstantiated adverse media or \nother related information.  None of the beneficial owners are politically exposed persons. ADB\u2019s \nreview of the entity does not give ADB cause to believe that it is being used for money laundering \nor terrorism financing. Tax integrity due diligence was not required. It is noted that GRIL has been \nawarded previous ADB funded projects and is likely to bid on future ADB sovereign projects. In \nline with ADB\u2019s standard practice for procurement in all sovereign projects, all award decisions \nto  be made in any potential procurement would independently rest with the executing agency, \nand need to be completely aligned with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from \ntime to time) and the Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time \nto time). This would mitigate any potential conflict of interest that may arise. \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n16.  Impact. The impact of the project is aligned with the Government of India\u2019s Bharatmala \nPariyojana Project, which targets 65,000 km to be constructed or upgraded. \n \n17.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: connectivity and travel time \nimproved as GRIL capacity to construct roads will be expanded. \n \n18.  Outputs. The project outputs will be (i) total stock of equipment and machinery of GRIL \nincreased, (ii) employment generated, and (iii) company\u2019s social and gender-inclusive strategies \nimplemented. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n19.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project, through its support \nfor enhancement of connectivity, is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 with respect to the \nfollowing operational priorities: promoting rural development, making cities more livable, and \naddressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities.7 The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy, 2018\u20132022 for India, specifically with pillar 2\u2014providing inclusive \naccess to infrastructure networks and social services by improving the infrastructure bottlenecks \nin lagging regions.8 \n \n20.  Consistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \nconsistent with the following elements of the Sustainable Transport Initiative of the Transport \nSector Group: scaling up urban transport, improving cross-border transport and logistics, and \nsupporting road safety and social sustainability.9 \n \n21.  Lessons  from  previous  operations.  This  is,  as  such,  the  first  nonsovereign  debt \nfinancing by ADB for the purchase of equipment to be utilized in the road subsector in India. \nHowever, from a sovereign road construction project in Mongolia, the importance of managing \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2003.

GRIL \nhas thus far largely managed this risk through a proactive backward integration strategy by way \nof in-house sourcing of key raw material, and several efficiency-improvement measures to avoid \nor reduce the impact of increase in cost of material and equipment. The risk of delay in land \nacquisition resulting in cost overrun is  also mitigated by the  recently rolled out models of \nconcession structures in India - which ensures substantial part of land acquisition prior to \nconstruction \u2013 and allows for descoping of the project in case land is not handed over in a timely \nmanner.    \n \nD.

The Assistance \n \n26.  ADB will invest up to $23 million in Indian rupee equivalent by subscribing to secured \nunlisted nonconvertible debentures issued by GRIL. These nonconvertible debentures would be \nredeemed over a 5-year period from the subscription date and include a grace period of 1 year \nfrom the date of subscription. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s assistance will provide access to medium-term financing to GRIL in a domestic \nenvironment where longer term financing is becoming scarce for companies operating in core \ninfrastructure sectors. (Confidential information redacted). As GRIL is one of the key companies \ndeveloping roads in India, a constraint in its ability to expand is a constraint for this critical sector.  \nADB\u2019s assistance will also help strengthen (i) GRIL\u2019s existing human resource management \nsystem and will help implement measures to promote gender equality in its business activities \n(refer to paragraph 35); and (ii) GRIL\u2019s social and environment standards by implementing a \nstandardized corporate wide environment, health and safety policy. \n \nC.

Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n32.  ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009) as follows: environment category C, involuntary resettlement category C, and \nindigenous peoples category C.11 ADB\u2019s investment will be used to purchase road construction \nequipment to ensure minimal reliance on hired or leased equipment. The environmental impact \nis expected to be minimal. No involuntary resettlement impacts or impacts on indigenous peoples \nare envisaged as a result of ADB\u2019s investment and use of proceeds. \n \n33.  ADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social \nimpacts of the project and considers that there are minimal or no adverse impacts from the project. \nGRIL has commissioned an independent corporate audit of the company\u2019s environmental and \nsocial management system and an environment and social compliance audit of the company\u2019s \npresent and past performance as per Safeguard Requirement 4 of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement. The corporate audit assessed that the company follows the statutory requirements. \nThe current environmental and social systems, processes, and practices of the company were \nalso commensurate with the regulatory requirements governing its business and operations.12 \n \n34.  The corporate audit found that, although the company has existing environmental, health \nand  safety,  human  resource  and social,  and/or  corporate  social  responsibility  policies  and \nprocedures, there is a need to strengthen, integrate, formalize, and document the different \nprocedures and processes into one corporate policy or procedure. GRIL plans to develop and \nimplement an integrated management system (covering environment, health and safety, and \nquality) to bring consistency in approach and outcomes across its different operations. GRIL will \n(i) apply ADB's prohibited investment activities list, and (ii) ensure that investments using ADB \nfunds comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and abide by national laws and regulations. \nThese and other audit findings and recommendations have been documented and agreed on in \na corrective action plan which will be implemented by GRIL. The company will also report annually \nto ADB on the utilization of ADB proceeds and compliance with the agreed corrective action plan. \n \n35.  Some gender elements. The investment is proposed to be categorized as possessing \nsome gender mainstreaming elements. GRIL commits to implement measures to promote gender \nequality and/or women\u2019s empowerment in its business activities following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender \nand Development.13 These measures are (i) committing to increase the employment levels of \nwomen in the corporate office by 50% by FY2023 (i.e., from 11.6% to 17.5% of total corporate \noffice workforce); (ii) working with the local community organizations to design and implement a \ntargeted corporate social responsibility program that will promote gender equality and women\u2019s \n                                                \n11 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n12 GRIL is working on some construction contracts which are partly financed through ADB\u2019s sovereign assistance. In \none case, there is a complaint regarding adherence to the environmental and social requirements (under ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement) and project-specific management plans. GRIL is already undertaking some mitigation \nmeasures. This is being assessed by the sector division and suitable corrective actions will be taken. \n13 ADB. 1998. Policy on Gender and Development.

Within 3 months of ADB loan disbursement, \nthe company will submit to ADB a gender action plan for corporate social responsibility activities. \nFurther, GRIL will periodically submit reports on implementation of gender measures to ADB. \n \n36.  Other social dimensions. GRIL will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to \nADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy (2001), will take measures to comply with the internationally \nrecognized core labor standards. The reporting and disclosure requirements related to the project \nwill be done in compliance with ADB requirements. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n37.  GRIL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n \n38.  The proposed nonconvertible debentures are within the medium-term, country, industry, \ngroup, and single exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n \n39.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),14 \nADB will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that the Government of India \nhas no objection to the proposed assistance to GRIL. ADB will enter into suitable finance \ndocumentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed \nassistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n40.  I am satisfied that the proposed senior secured debt financing facility would comply with \nthe Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the investment of up to $23,000,000 in Indian rupee equivalent from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources into nonconvertible debentures issued by GR Infraprojects Limited for the \nHighway Equipment Finance Project in India, with such terms and conditions as are substantially \nin accordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n25 June 2019 \n                                                \n14 ADB. 1966.
