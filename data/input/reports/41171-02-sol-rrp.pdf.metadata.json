Solomon Islands for the Transport Sector Development Project. The report also describes \nproposed  administration  of  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  be  provided  by  the  Japan  Fund  for \nPoverty  Reduction  for  Supporting  the  Transport  Sector  Development  Project,  and  if  the  Board \napproves  the  proposed  grant,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  will \napprove administration of the TA. \n \n2. \nThe  project  will  improve  access  to  socioeconomic  opportunities  by  rehabilitating  and \nmaintaining  land,  sea,  and  air  transport  infrastructure. 1  Solomon  Islands  has  been  offered \nsignificant  parallel  grant  cofinancing  from  the  governments  of  Australia  and  New  Zealand  but \nhas  insufficient  capacity  to  plan  and  implement  the  necessary  civil  works.  The  project  will \ntherefore  strengthen \ninstitutions  by  establishing  a  central  project \nimplementation  unit  (CPIU)  to  reform  the  government\u2019s  institutional  structure,  implement  civil \nworks, and conduct technical and managerial capacity development. In doing so, the project will \nprepare an environment for a comprehensive transport sector-based approach based on long-\nterm  partnerships,  sector  coordination,  and  reliance  on  government  systems.  Through  close \ncooperation  with  other  development  partners,  the  project  will  support  the  government  in \nefficiently implementing all externally funded assistance to the transport sector.2\n \n \n\ntransport  sector \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nSolomon Islands is a large Melanesian island country, with a land area of about 28,000 \nsquare kilometers, six large islands, dozens of smaller islands, and hundreds of islets and atolls. \nAbout  80%  of  the  population  of  540,000  is  rural,  living  in  widely  dispersed  villages  of  a  few \nhundred people. The country is fragile, weakly performing, and still emerging from several years \nof conflict from 1999 to 2003. It is one of the least developed of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  Pacific  developing  member  countries.  The  country  is  unlikely  to  meet  most  of  the \nMillennium Development Goals by 2015. Socioeconomic indicators include high unemployment, \nfast population growth, and slow economic growth, which combine to exacerbate poverty.  \n \n4. \nThe  economy  is  at  a  disadvantage  given  the  dispersed  population,  limited  resources, \nand  relatively  high  cost  of  providing  remote  communities  with  the  infrastructure  and  basic \nservices  to  stimulate  productivity  gains.  The  urban\u2013rural  divide  is  increasing  between  the \npopulation  living  in  and  around  the  capital  city  of  Honiara  and  the  majority  of  the  population \nliving  in  rural  communities  on  outer  islands.  The  weak  and  poorly  maintained  transport \ninfrastructure  constrains  economic  growth  and  limits  its  inclusiveness.  Improved  transport \ninfrastructure is expected to strengthen growth, improve access to basic social services in rural \nareas, build rural economies, and increase geographic equity. \n \nTransport  infrastructure. The government\u2019s National Transport Plan (NTP) and ADB's \n5. \ninterim  Solomon  Islands  country  partnership  strategy,  2009\u20132011  sets  out  a  goal  to  improve \ntransport  infrastructure  to  strengthen  equitable  private-sector-led  economic  growth  and  create \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.  ADB.  2010.  Technical \nAssistance to Solomon Islands for Preparing the Transport Sector Development Project. Manila (TA 7335-SOL).  \n\n\fan enabling business environment.3 Previously, transport infrastructure had deteriorated due to \npoor  maintenance,  low  government  and  contractor  capacity  for  planning  and  implementation, \nand  natural  disasters.  Prior  to  recent  projects,  about  65%  of  roads  had  deteriorated  and \nrequired  rehabilitation,  although  the  figure  is  now  about  50%  and  improving.  The  government \ncurrently  gives  high  priority  to  rehabilitating  and maintaining  existing transport  infrastructure to \nensure that the infrastructure remains in operation. To this end, the government is undertaking a \ncomprehensive  effort  to  rehabilitate  and  maintain  transport  infrastructure,  with  strong  support \nfrom development partners.4\n  \n \n6. \nInstitutional  aspects.  Capacity  constraints,  inappropriate  institutional  structures,  and \nsporadic  capacity  development  have  hindered  the  government\u2019s  ability  to  develop  and \nimplement  transport  sector  policies  and  plans  effectively.  These  factors  are  exacerbated  by \nconstrained  public  sector  budgets,  lack  of  human  resource  and  organizational  planning,  and \ninadequate  training  programs.  The  government\u2019s  institutional  structure  requires  strengthening \nand training to meet needs identified by ADB TA5\n and to implement the scale of works required \nto improve the network, particularly those that are externally funded.  \n \n7. \nIntermodal  connectivity.  Intermodal  connectivity  is  crucial  to  improve  access.  Where \ntravel  and  transport  demand  is  low,  typically  in  remote  areas, reliable  access  and  connectivity \nneed  to  be  prioritized.  Improving  connections  between  land,  sea,  and  air  transport  requires \nrehabilitating  deteriorated  infrastructure  and  constructing  new  facilities.  Lower  transport  costs \nand  more  frequent  services  will  in  turn  stimulate  benefits  such  as  increased  agricultural \nproduction and trade for rural communities.   \n \nNational  Transport  Plan.  The  NTP,  originally  developed  with  support  from  ADB  TA,6\n8. \n \narticulates  the  government\u2019s  transport  policies,  strategies,  and  priorities  for  developing  the \ntransport  system.  The  NTP  formally  sets  out  a  strategic  and  policy  framework  to  (i)  develop \ntransport services, (ii) maintain and develop physical infrastructure, (iii) improve the capacity of \ngovernment  agencies,  and  (iv)  develop  the  private  sector.  The  NTP  was  recently  updated  to \ninclude  a  prioritization  methodology,  subproject  selection  criteria,  and  a  3-year  rolling  work \nprogram of prioritized subprojects (footnote 5). The government and development partners have \nagreed  that  future  support  to  the  sector  will  be  in  accordance  with  the  NTP  to  develop  robust \nnational transport infrastructure that contributes fully to development of the country.   \n \n9. \nNational  Transport  Fund.  To  sustain  the  transport  sector,  increased  investment  is \nrequired  to  rehabilitate  and  maintain  transport  infrastructure  as  prioritized  in  the  NTP.  The \ngovernment  established  the  National  Transport  Fund  (NTF)  with  ADB  support  (footnote  5)  to \nserve  as  a  sustainable  mechanism  to  fund  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  of  infrastructure  as \nwell  as  support  maritime  transport  service  provision  to  uneconomic  destinations.  The  NTF \nallows  the  government  to  enhance  its  ability  to  allocate  resources,  sustain  implementation  of \nnational transport infrastructure, and help with disaster management and recovery.  \n \nDevelopment  coordination.  The  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  Development  (MID)  has  \n10. \nworked  with  development  partners  including  ADB,  the  Australian  Agency  for  International \n\n                                                \n3   ADB. 2009.

Well-functioning  informal  coordination  mechanisms \nhave already been developed and are expected to lead to a sector-wide approach.7\n \n \n11. \nBy substantially upgrading MID capacity, the project will help the government to improve \nsector planning, strengthen project implementation, and manage domestic funding and external \nassistance  to  sustain  national  transport  infrastructure.  Given  the  improved  capacity  and \nadequate  funding,  the  project  will  lead  to  better  transport  asset  conditions  and  intermodal \nconnectivity  of  national  transport  infrastructure.  Improved  access  is  expected  to  stimulate \nagricultural production and trade for rural communities and extend delivery of social services.   \n \nB. \n \n12. \nThe  impact  will  be  improved  access  to  socioeconomic  opportunities  by  the  people  of \nSolomon  Islands.  The  project  is  expected  to  produce  benefits  for  remote  rural  populations  as \nwell as the national population. The project will have important additional benefits for the socially \nvulnerable, including women, children, and the disabled. The outcome will be that MID provides \nsustainable transport infrastructure as prioritized in the NTP.  \n \nC. \n \n13. \nOutputs  include  (i)  efficient  and  effective  project  implementation  and  management \nprovided  by  a  CPIU;  (ii) rehabilitation  and maintenance  of  transport  infrastructure  prioritized  in \nthe NTP; and (iii) upgraded technical and managerial capacity of MID staff. ADB will finance the \nfirst  and  third  outputs,  the  government  will  finance  the  first  and  second  outputs,  and \ndevelopment partners will finance the second and third outputs on a parallel basis. The details \nare described in the project administration manual (PAM).8\n These outputs will be complemented \nby TA to improve MID\u2019s project management and implementation capacity (paras. 25\u201327). \n \n14. \nFor  the  first  output,  the  project  will  help  MID  establish  a  consolidated  CPIU  within  its \nexisting  Transport  Infrastructure  Management  Services  Department.  The  CPIU  is  intended  to \nimplement  and  manage  all  transport  sector  activities,  whether  funded  by  the  project  or  other \nresources.  The  CPIU  will  be  staffed  by  existing  MID  personnel  and  supplemented  by \nconsultants  to  provide  the  required  expertise  to  implement  the  NTP.  The  project  will  also \nundertake  a  range  of  capacity  development  initiatives  for  MID  staff  through  coaching  and  on-\nthe-job  training. 9\n As  MID  gains  capacity  and  expands  its  staffing,  government  personnel  will \ngradually take over from the consultants toward the end of the project. \n \n15. \nFor  the  second  output,  infrastructure  investments  will  be  planned  and  delivered  as \ndetermined  by  the  NTP.  These  are  outlined  in  the  sector  plan  and  based  on  the  subproject \nselection  criteria.  To  determine  priorities,  the  NTP  uses  multi-criteria  analysis,  including \neconomic  and  social  aspects,  safeguards,  and  engineering  standards. 10\n Designs  will \nincorporate  measures  for  adapting  to  climate  change  impacts,  for  supporting  the  socially \n\n                                                \n7   A  sector-wide  approach  strengthens  the  government\u2019s  leadership  in  implementing  projects  by  expanding  its \ncapacity  in  design,  implementation,  management,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  ability  to  work  exclusively \nthrough government systems and consolidated funding.  \n\n8   Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9  Ministry of Infrastructure Development Personnel Plan and Project Implementation Arrangement (accessible from \n\nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n10  National Transport Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fvulnerable, and ensuring sustainable maintenance. Recurrent funding provided through the NTF \nwill  be  used  for  maintenance  through  labor-based,  equipment-supported  methods;  traditional \nequipment-based  methods;  and  community  contracts  depending  on  the  needs  of  each \nsubproject.  The  resources  available  through  the  NTF  are  expected  to  gradually  increase \nthrough government allocations and bilateral grants. This will expand the NTF\u2019s importance as \nthe primary channel for external assistance.   \n \n16. \nFor the third output, the project will include a formal training component to upgrade the \ntechnical  and  managerial  skills  of  MID  staff.  It  will  review  training  needs  assessments, \ndetermine  individual  training  plans,  and  conduct  extensive  formal  training  programs.  This \ncomponent  will  also  build  capacity  of  national  contractors  and  consultants,  and  communities \n(including  supervisors  and  technicians)  in  supervision  and  quality  control  for  labor-based, \nequipment-supported maintenance.  \n \n17. \nThe  sector-based  approach  of  the  project  will  bolster  country  ownership;  increase \nreliance on country systems for reporting, budgeting, financial management, and procurement; \nstrengthen  the  links  between  the  sector  plan  and  the  budget  framework;  and  improve \ndevelopment  coordination.  The  approach  will  enhance  partnerships  with  other  agencies  by \nstrengthening  implementation  of  the  NTP  and  through  the  NTF  board,  which  includes \nrepresentatives  of  ADB,  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development,  the  European \nCommission, the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the World Bank.  \n \nD. \n \n18. \n \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $84.50 million (Table 1). \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n \n \nB. \n\n \nBase Costb \n1.

MID  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  project.  It  has  experience  in  implementing \nsector  projects  funded  by  development  partners  (footnote  4). The  NTF  board12\n will  act  as  the \nproject  steering  committee  and  approve  subprojects  based  on  the  prioritization  and  selection \ncriteria  in  the  NTP  and  consistent  with  NTF  allocations,  which  all  development  partners  have \nagreed  to  follow.  The  board  will  monitor  project  implementation  and  provide  policy  guidance, \ncoordination, quality assurance of technical design and tendering, progress reports, and audited \naccounts. \n \n22. \nThe  CPIU  will  be  responsible  for  design  and  day-to-day  implementation,  financial \nmanagement, monitoring and evaluation, and development and implementation of training. The \nCPIU  will  be  established  by  mobilizing  international  and  national  consultants  to  support  MID\u2019s \nexisting technical and managerial capacity. Consulting firms will be retained for these services, \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time \nto  time).  Throughout  project  implementation,  international  consultants  will  be  tasked  to \nstrengthen  the  capacity  of  the  CPIU  through  coaching  and  on-the-job  training  of  government \nprofessional and technical staff and national consultants. Outline terms of reference are in the \nPAM (footnote 8). Procurement and disbursement for the services will follow ADB\u2019s policy and \nguidelines.  \n \n23. \nThe  CPIU  will  develop  and  refine  required  government  guidelines  and  standards  for \nproject  implementation,  including technical  specifications, financial  management,  procurement, \ndisbursement, and safeguards. These guidelines and standards will be built on the frameworks \nfor engineering; economic, poverty and social analysis; and safeguards developed by ADB TA \n                                                \n12  The  NTF  board  comprises  permanent  secretaries  of  the  government\u2019s  line  and  central  agencies,  and  one \n\ndevelopment partner representative who represents the consolidated view of all development partners.  \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f(footnotes  2,  5,  6)  to  create  government  systems  compatible  with  the  requirements  of \ndevelopment partners.  \n \n24. \nProcurement  and  disbursement  for  civil  works  and  formal  training  programs  to  be \nfinanced  by  other  development  partners  will  follow  government  systems.  MID  will  procure  a \nnumber  of  packages  for  civil  works  and  formal  training  programs  through  the  government\u2019s \nprocurement  procedure, \ntender  board,  and \naccountable  officer  procedures.  The  CPIU  will  assist  MID  in  procuring  and  administering \ncontracts.  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  will  apply  to  all  civil  works.

While  previous  projects  and  TA  have  significantly  improved  transport  infrastructure  in \nSolomon  Islands,  ineffective  transport  infrastructure  management  and  project  implementation \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fcontinue to result in deficiencies. MID needs to improve its performance and play a stronger role \nin transport sector management. It needs to improve its organization and establish well-defined \npositions and procedures.  \n \nThe  TA  will  develop  and  implement  a  reform  and  capacity  development  plan  for  MID, \n26. \napproved  by  the  government,  to  enhance  MID\u2019s  capacity  in  project  management  and \nimplementation.  The  TA  will  support  MID  in  implementing  reforms  to  its  institutional  structure \nthrough  advice  and  training.  Expected  outcomes  will  include  separation  of  the  functions  of \npolicy,  ownership,  administration,  management,  service  provision,  and  finance;  strengthened \nability of MID to engage and supervise contractors; and targeted training of staff in engineering, \nprocurement, financial management, and safeguards. \n \nThe TA is estimated to cost $1.0 million, of which $800,000 will be financed on a grant \n27. \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and be administered by ADB. The government \nwill  contribute  $200,000  equivalent  in  kind  through  the  provision  of  counterpart  staff,  office \nspace  and  administrative  support,  logistics,  and  local  transport.  ADB  will  engage  international \nand  national  consultants  for  the  TA  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Details  of  the  terms  of  reference,  cost \nestimates and financing plan, and implementation arrangements are in the TA paper.13\n \n\n   \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n28. \nDue  diligence  is  based  on  extensive  consultations  with  potential  beneficiaries  in  rural \nand urban areas, as well as broad stakeholder consultations with the government, civil society, \nnongovernment organizations, other development partners, and the private sector.  \n \nA. \n \nThe  assessment  of  institutional  capacity  is  based  on  the  projected  civil  works  to  be \n29. \nfunded by parallel financing during the project. The required number of personnel for the CPIU \nand MID are estimated and identified in a personnel plan (footnote 9).  \n \nFor  potential  civil  works,  analyses  include  site  selection,  engineering,  and  cost \n30. \nestimates. International firms will carry out large-scale construction, and national contractors will \nundertake  smaller-scale  works  and  maintenance.  Sample  designs  include  climate  change \nadaptation strategies, which allow for sea level rise, and increase in annual mean temperature \nand  precipitation.  Sample  designs  incorporate  measures  to  support  the  socially  vulnerable \nincluding  women,  children,  and  the  disabled,  and  adopt  a  sustainable  maintenance  strategy \nwhile considering future traffic growth.    \n \nB. \n \n31. \nBased  on  previous  studies,  ongoing  projects,  the  NTP,  and  expected  subprojects  to \ncome  under  NTF  funding,  two  specific  sites\u2014a  rural  road  and  a  provincial  air  strip\u2014were \ninvestigated as sample subprojects to guide implementation of civil works.14\n Both are assessed \nas  economically  feasible  surpassing  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  threshold,  and  are \nshown to be robust through sensitivity analysis.   \n \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n                                                \n13  Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14  Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance  \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nProcurement.  MID  will  procure  civil  works  in  accordance  with  the  government\u2019s \n\nFunding  sources  for  counterpart  funds  and  operation  and  maintenance  costs  were \n32. \nreviewed.  MID  will  provide  the  counterpart  funds  required  during  project  implementation.  The \noperation  and  maintenance  arrangements  and  plans  are  also  in  place.  The  government \ncounterpart contribution will be appropriated annually in the national budget.  \n \nC. \n \n33. \nFinancial  management.  MID  has  been  involved  in  financial  management  of  projects, \naccounting,  financial  reporting,  and  audit;  and  is  gradually  building  its  capacity.  However,  its \ncapacity  remains  inadequate  for  full  administration  of  the  project  without  additional  support.15\n \nFinancial management capacity is limited to processing recurrent and personnel expenditures. \nTraining  in  accounting  procedures  will  be  required.  The  project  will  provide  capacity \ndevelopment to strengthen financial management. \n \n34. \nprocurement systems.  \n \n35. \nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  the  executing  agency.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 8). \n \nD. \n \n36. \nBenefits.  The  project\u2019s  expected  poverty  and  social  benefits  and  impacts  on  local \ncommunities  were  analyzed  through  social  and  poverty  analysis  and  consultations  with \nstakeholders.  A  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  was  prepared. 16\n The  project \nincorporates  several  strategies  to  enable  the  poor  and  vulnerable  communities  to  realize \nbenefits  and  thereby  reduce  poverty  in  the  subproject  areas,  including  (i)  improved  transport \naccess  to  households,  businesses,  schools,  and  health  centers  in  rural  and  remote  areas; \n(ii) employment  for  local  men  and  women  in  construction  and  maintenance  activities; \n(iii) provision of basic skills training and income generation activities; (iv) civil works contracts to \ninclude  minimum  labor  standards;  and  (v)  provision  of  HIV/AIDS  awareness  and  prevention \nprograms in construction camps and communities. \n \nGender.  The  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  A  gender  action \n37. \nplan17\n was  prepared  to  guide  implementation  of  the  project  including  (i)  subprojects  to  target \nwomen  beneficiaries  during  construction  and  maintenance;  (ii)  requirements  for  contracts  to \ninclude  HIV/AIDS  awareness  for  men  and  women;  (iii)  equal  pay  for  equal  work  by  male  and \nfemale  workers;  (iv)  contractors  to  increase  female  participation  in  the  labor  force;  (v)  all \ncommunity  consultations  to  have  female  participation;  (vi)  skills  training  for  women\u2019s  groups; \nand (vii) capacity development of MID on gender and development.  \n \nE. \n \n38. \nassessed in accordance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n\nImpacts  on  the  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples  were \n\nSafeguards  \n\n                                                \n15 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16  Summary  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social  Strategy;  Poverty  and  Social  Assessment  (accessible  from  the  list  of \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n17  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f \n39. \nEnvironment. Given the subprojects prioritized in the NTP, civil  works are not likely to \nresult in any significant adverse environmental impact, and potential environmental impacts can \nbe adequately mitigated and monitored. An environmental assessment and review framework18 \npresents the general anticipated environmental impacts of the sector project, selection criteria, \nand  environmental  procedures  for  future  subprojects.  An  initial  environmental  examination \nincorporating an environmental management and monitoring plan was prepared for each of the \ntwo  sample  subprojects  for  road  and  airstrip  rehabilitation. 19\n The  project  is  classified  as \nenvironment category B. \n \n40. \nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  project  is  not  expected  to  entail  significant \nresettlement  impacts,  as  anticipated  subprojects  will  involve  existing  infrastructure  and \nrehabilitation works can be undertaken within the existing right-of-way or on land owned by the \ngovernment.  While  the  sample  subprojects  studied  do  not  require  land  acquisition,  some \nsubsequent  subprojects  or  activities  may  involve  minor  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nimpacts, which can be identified only during implementation. If such impacts are identified, the \ngovernment  will  prepare  resettlement  plans for such  subprojects  according to  the resettlement \nframework for the project. 20\n \n41. \nIndigenous  peoples.  Melanesians  are  the  native  people  of  Solomon  Islands  and \ncomprise the vast majority of the population. The project is not expected to have any negative \nimpact  on  indigenous  peoples.  While  a  separate  indigenous  peoples  plan  is  not  needed,  all \nproject  components  or  subprojects  will  be  implemented  in  a  culturally  appropriate  and \nparticipatory  manner  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  population.  The  project\u2019s  indigenous  peoples \nclassification is category C. \n \nF. \n \n42.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.21\n \n \n\n The project\u2019s involuntary resettlement classification is category B. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nInstitutional \nsustainability  \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe project will improve MID\u2019s institutional capacity by providing on-the-job training and \ncoaching.  To  supplement  the  capacity  shortage,  qualified  international  and  national \nconsultants  will  be  mobilized  in  a  CPIU.  MID  will  gradually  take  over  the  consultants\u2019 \ntasks.  The  associated  technical  assistance  will  develop  a  reform  and  capacity \ndevelopment plan, facilitate its implementation, and provide formal training. \n\nFinancial \n\nOperation \nand \nmaintenance \n\nMID  will  adopt  a  conservative  approach  with  respect  to  cost  estimates  and  required \nresources,  and  ensure  competitive  tender  processes.
