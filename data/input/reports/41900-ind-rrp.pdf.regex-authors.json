THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof up to Rs3.52 billion for the Tata Power Company Limited (TPC) without a Government \nguarantee  for  the  Khandke  Wind  Power  Project  and  the  Bramanvel  Wind  Power  Project \n(collectively referred to as the Project). The loan will be made available in two direct tranches: (i) \none of up to Rs1.26 billion; and (ii) another of up to Rs2.26 billion, which will be fully covered by \na  guarantee  (or  other  financial  instrument  acceptable  to  ADB)  from  financial  institutions \nacceptable to the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Part of the guaranteed portion may be \nsyndicated to financial institutions and/or selected financial institutions may enter into a risk or \nfunded participation with ADB. \n \nII.  INTRODUCTION \n \n2.  India is endowed with abundant renewable energy sources\u2014solar, wind, biomass, and \nsmall hydroelectric\u2014and the Government is working proactively to develop them. Under the \n\u201cPower for All by 2012\u201d initiative, the Government has envisaged universal electricity supply by \n2012. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), formerly the Ministry of Non-\nConventional Energy Sources (MNES), has proposed exploiting the full potential of renewable \nenergy sources to increase generation capacity in the country. The National Electricity Policy, \nissued by the Ministry of Power on 12 February 2005, also emphasizes the development of \nrenewable energy sources. \n \n3.  Since its inception, the renewable energy program in India has been driven by policies \nand promotional measures initially framed by MNRE and subsequently by the respective state \ngovernments. The promotional measures available to renewable energy projects comprise a \nwide range of fiscal and financial incentives, including soft loans, concessional customs duties, \nexemption from excise duty, tax holidays, and accelerated depreciation benefits. \n \n4.  To accelerate the promotion of renewable energy development, Maharashtra Electricity \nRegulation  Commission  (MERC)  will  require  licensed  distributors  operating  in  the  state  to \nprocure 3% of total energy input from renewable energy sources in 2007, with a 1 percentage \npoint increase each year until 2010 to reach 6% of total energy input. As a licensed distributor, \nTPC has decided to undertake more wind power projects to comply with the requirement. \n \n5.  TPC is a sponsor of the Tala-Delhi Transmission Project, for which ADB provided a long-\nterm direct loan denominated in Indian rupees from ADB.1 The 1,100-kilometer (km) Tala-Delhi \ntransmission  system,  the  first  private  sector  power  transmission  project  in  Asia,  became \noperational in August 2006. At ADB\u2019s 38th annual meeting in Istanbul in 2005, TPC was invited \nto  speak  at  the  seminar  on  public-private  partnerships,  and  made  a  presentation  on  its \nexperience privatizing the power distribution business in Delhi. Based on the relationship it has \nbuilt and maintained with TPC, ADB has encouraged the company to undertake renewable \nenergy projects, as well as conventional thermal projects with new technologies to achieve \nhigher  efficiency.  In  this  context,  TPC  approached  ADB  for  long-term  debt  financing  to \nimplement wind farm projects. TPC also asked ADB to take the lead in arranging the entire debt \nfinancing  package,  relying  on  ADB\u2019s  catalytic  role,  capability,  and  network  of  financing \ninstitutions. The concept clearance for the loan was approved in December 2006, environmental \nand social site visits were conducted in January 2007, and due diligence was completed in \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002.

", "2        \nFebruary 2007. If approved, this would be the first ADB loan to assist a private sector wind \npower project. \n \nIII.  BACKGROUND \n \nA.  Sector Background in India \n \n1.  Demand and Supply of Power in India \n \n6.  India is the third largest electricity consumer in Asia behind the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina and Japan. As of 30 September 2005, India\u2019s installed power generation capacity was \n123,014 megawatts (MW), of which 57% is owned and operated by state entities, 32% by \ncentral public sector undertakings, and 11% by independent power producers and other private \nsector  utilities.  Thermal  plants,  mostly  coal-fired,  provide  66%  of  the  installed  capacity. \nHydropower accounts for 26% of the capacity, with gas- and oil-fired thermal plants, renewable \nenergy plants, and nuclear plants providing the remaining 8%. Despite its growing population \nand economy, India\u2019s annual consumption remains relatively low at 606 kilowatt-hours per \ncapita.  \n \n7.  Power demand in India has grown rapidly as the economy has expanded at an annual \naverage of 5.6% since 1980. Under the Government\u2019s \u201cPower for All by 2012\u201d initiative, target \ncapacity is being expanded to maintain India\u2019s current 8% economic growth rate. Industry buys \napproximately 33% of the electricity sold in India, followed by agriculture and households at \n25% each, and businesses and others at 17%. India continues to suffer from chronic electricity \nshortages, where peak demand exceeds supply by more than 10%; the energy deficit between \nApril and December 2006 was 7.7%.2 Power quality remains poor, marked by high voltage \nfluctuations  and  recurring  load  shedding.  As  the  10th  Five  Year  Plan  (FY2002\u2013FY2007) \nachieves only 75% of the capacity additions needed by the end of this period, energy shortfalls \nwill persist over the short to medium term. The Government seeks to eliminate this deficit by \nFY2012, which marks the end of the 11th Five Year Plan (FY2008\u2013FY2012).  \n \n2.  Potential and Achievement in the Wind Power Sector \n \n8.  As the Indian power sector has grown, the country has become increasingly dependent \non fossil fuels. With the recent hike in oil and gas prices, as well as the expected fossil fuel \nshortages in the future, the security of the energy supply in India has generated increasing \nconcern. The environmental concern over excess use of fossil fuels also is rising. In this \ncontext, India urgently needs to explore sustainable energy development, and the Government \nhas been working proactively to promote the use of renewable energy sources. \n \n9.  Among the renewable power resources available in India, wind energy is a promising \nsource for further development. The country has 45,000 MW of gross potential and 13,000 MW \nof technical potential for wind power. As of September 2006, India had more than 6,000 MW of \ninstalled wind power capacity, ranking the country fourth in the world. The 10th Five Year Plan \ntargets a 1,500 MW increase of installed wind power capacity. However, 3,017.55 MW is likely \nto be installed.3 \n \n                                                 \n2  Ministry of Power. 2006. Annual Report 2005\u20132006.

The  Government  has  provided  support  measures  to  increase  renewable  energy \ncontributions  in  the  country.  It  also  issued  policy  guidelines  for  the  state  governments  to \nestablish  and  maintain  state-specific  policies  to  promote  renewable  power  projects.  These \ninclude  permission  to  accelerate  depreciation,  concession  or  full  exemption  from  customs \nduties, tax holidays, and soft loans available through Government-owned agencies. \n \n11.  Maharashtra is one of the leading states in promoting wind power generation. The state \nhas an estimated 3,650 MW of gross potential and 3,000 MW of technical potential for wind \nenergy. As of September 2006, installed wind power capacity in Maharashtra was 1,242 MW, \nthe second most among states in India. From 2003 to March 2006, Maharashtra developed 750 \nMW of additional capacity. Appendix 1 further explains the wind power sector in India. \n \nB.  Asian Development Bank Operations \n \n1.  ADB\u2019s Country Strategy for India \n \n12.  Mainstreaming  poverty  reduction  is  the  central  organizing  theme  of  ADB\u2019s  country \nstrategy and program (CSP) for India.4 It draws on the three pillars of ADB\u2019s poverty reduction \nstrategy: pro-poor growth, social development, and good governance. The strategy aims to \nsupport the Government\u2019s high-growth agenda by assisting fiscal consolidation, infrastructure \ndevelopment,  and  private  sector  development.  Political  and  economic  developments  since \nfinalizing the CSP indicate that its assistance strategy remains valid, especially the core strategy \nof poverty reduction through infrastructure-led growth supported by social development and \ngood governance. The 2006\u20132008 CSP5 update suggests that the objective of accelerating \nIndia\u2019s  annual  gross  domestic  product  growth  to  8%  depends  on  upgrading  infrastructure \nfacilities  and  improving  the  efficiency  of  such  public  services.  ADB\u2019s  proposed  assistance \nprogram reflects this priority, with infrastructure accounting for nearly 77% of the 3-year pipeline \n(not including private sector and nonsovereign operations). \n \n2.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy \n \n13.  ADB\u2019s  energy  sector  strategy6  establishes  its  operational  priorities  as  (i)  reducing \npoverty by, among others, creating energy infrastructure for sustainable economic growth; (ii) \npromoting  private  sector  involvement  by  restructuring  the  energy  sector  and  creating  an \nenabling environment for private investors; (iii) addressing regional and global environmental \nimpacts; and (iv) promoting regional cooperation. In particular, the strategy strongly encourages \nADB interventions to increase investment in the renewable energy subsector, as well as to \nincrease  private  sector  participation  in  the  energy  sector  to  take  advantage  of  the  higher \noperational  efficiencies  that  private  operators  can  achieve  and  to  meet  the  large  capital \nrequirements. \n \n14.  ADB\u2019s assistance for the power sector, as outlined in the 2006\u20132008 CSP update, has \nsix main priorities: (i) reforming the sector; (ii) promoting higher efficiency and low-carbon power \nsources that are locally available; (iii) expanding and optimizing transmission and distribution \nsystems;  (iv)  supporting  institutional  strengthening  to  implement  reforms  required  by  the \nElectricity  Act  of  2003,  including  development  of  more  flexible  power  delivery  and  trading \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2003.

To support the Government\u2019s \u201cPower for \nAll by 2012\u201d initiative, ADB\u2019s strategy for the power sector will create synergy with the 10th and \n11th  Five  Year  Plans.  This  includes  development  of  sustainable  energy  development, \nparticularly promotion of renewable energy projects. \n \nIV.  THE BORROWER \n \nA.  Background \n \n15.

EIL is a joint venture between Enercon GmbH of Germany (56%), the second largest \nwind energy company in the world, and the Mehra group of Mumbai (44%). EIL, which started \ncommercial  operations  in  1995,  crossed  the  milestone  of  1,000  wind  energy  converter \ninstallations and the 500 MW benchmarks during FY2005. \n \n30.  SEL, the leading wind energy company in India, had a market share of more than 50% in \n2005. It is also the world\u2019s fifth largest wind turbine manufacturer. Established in 1995, SEL had \ncumulative global sales of 2,321 wind turbine generators with total capacity of 2,108 MW by \nMarch 2006. \n ", "  7\n31.  TCE  was  established  in  1962  as  a  partnership  between  the  Tata  Group\u2019s  electric \ncompanies  and  Ebasco  Services  Incorporated  of  the  United  States.  The  business  and \nundertaking of TCE became a division of Tata Sons Limited in 1968, and was transferred to the \nnew  TCE,  incorporated  in  December  1999  as  a  new  company  and  now  a  wholly  owned \nsubsidiary of Tata Sons Limited. TCE has executed more than 3,000 assignments, covering \npower, chemical, industrial, information and technology infrastructure, and water supply and \nsewerage projects. \n \n32.  TPC will distribute the energy generated by the Project in its license area to meet the \nrequired purchase specification (RPS) under the order issued by MERC.8 The RPS is the \npercentage of energy inputs that licensed distributors in the state of Maharashtra are obliged to \nprocure from renewable energy sources. Set at 3% for FY2007, the RPS will increase by 1 \npercentage point annually until reaching 6% in FY2010. While failure to meet the RPS in \nFY2007 does not carry a penalty, any licensed distributor that fails to meet the RPS in FY2008 \nwill be required to pay Rs5 per kilowatt hour (kWh) of shortfall. The penalty rate will increase to \nRs6 per kWh in FY2009 and Rs7 per kWh in FY2010. \n \nC.  Environmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n \n33.  The  Project  has  been  classified  as  category  B,  because  it  is  unlikely  to  create  a \nsignificant environmental impact during construction and operation. ADB staff and a project \nconsultant made site visits on 16\u201317 January 2007. The initial environmental examination was \nprepared in line with ADB\u2019s environmental safeguard policies and information disclosure for \nenvironmental category B projects. The initial environmental examination was posted on the \nADB Web site on 23 March 2007. \n \n34.  The main adverse environmental impacts of the Project will be noise (aerodynamic and \nmechanical) from the operating turbines, and the visual impact on the landscape. The noise \nfrom the wind farm at both sites is unlikely to be significant, because the turbines appear to be \nset  back  sufficiently  from  permanent  settlements  for  adequate  noise  attenuation.  The \nlandscapes that are to be affected visually from turbine placement do not appear to have any \nunique  features.  The  types  of  likely  or  potential  project  construction  impacts  (i.e.,  land \ndisturbance,  vegetation  clearance,  erosion  and  sedimentation,  water  quality  decline, \nconstruction noise and traffic, waste generation, and loss of agricultural land) are classified as \nsecondary  impacts  due  to  the  limited  extent  and  significance  of  their  consequences.  The \nimplementation  of  appropriate  management  measures  will  largely  avoid  or  mitigate  these \nimpacts. \n \n35.  The Project is classified as category C for involuntary resettlement. Land for the project \nsites has been acquired on a negotiated settlement basis, with payments covering land acquired \nfor wind turbine sites and routing of transmission lines on an easement right basis. Aside from \nthe  single  substation,  the  parcels  acquired  at  Khandke  are  marginal  slices  of  individual \nlandholdings, primarily grazing areas. These will revert to their original state, and all previous \nowners will have full access to them for their livestock after construction. At Bramanvel, where \nthe site is on forestland leased from the Government, only easement rights have been paid for \nthe transmission line where it runs across individual landholdings. As the sellers have not been \ncoerced and are not subject to expropriation, the transactions are essentially between willing \n                                                 \n8  MERC. 2006.

", "8        \nbuyers and willing sellers in an active land market. The Project has caused no displacement, \nhas not affected any physical structures, and has not led to the loss of livelihoods. \n \n36.  As the Project is classified as category C for indigenous peoples, an indigenous peoples \nplan is not required. Although Maharashtra has a significant tribal population, the Project has no \nperceptible  impacts  on  distinct  tribal  groups  in  the  project  areas.  Since  the  forestland  at \nBramanvel is primarily scrub, it has no forest-dependent peoples. \n \n37.  During due diligence for the Project, no significant adverse impacts was identified related \nto the acquisition of land and assets. The land was acquired in a manner that ensured fair \nmarket-based prices. One of the main benefits of the site at Khandke was that, consistent with \nwind farm practices worldwide, TPC and EIL ensured open access to villagers for grazing on \nlands already sold. The 700 owners who sold land would lose no more than 0.1 acres per \nindividual, less than 1% of any single landholding. At Bramanvel, there are other operating wind \nfarms, and with an additional installed capacity by the TPC\u2019s project, the whole area is soon to \nbe the world\u2019s largest wind farm spread over an area 38 km by 22 km. Rapidly growing \ncommunities, essentially cohesive groups of mixed minorities and recent settlers, are taking \nadvantage of the economic opportunities of a large project\u2014rental housing, restaurants, and \nancillary services. \n \nD.  Development Impacts \n \n38.  One of the major keys for poverty reduction in India is to maintain sustainable and high \neconomic  growth  being  supplemented  by  social  development.  The  Project  is  expected  to \ncontribute to the country\u2019s poverty reduction through its threefold development impacts: (i) to \nincrease power generation capacity to mitigate power shortages in India, particularly in the state \nof Maharashtra; (ii) to develop additional renewable energy sources, diversifying the country\u2019s \nenergy portfolio and mitigating its dependence on conventional fossil fuel-fired thermal capacity; \nand (iii) to promote private sector participation in developing power sector infrastructure. These \nare presented in the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 4. \n \nE.  Development Effectiveness \n \n39.  ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department and Operations Evaluation Department \nare formulating guidelines for implementing the Good\u2013Practice Standards for Evaluation of \nPrivate Sector Investment Operations,9 which were prepared by the Evaluation Cooperation \nGroup of the multilateral development banks. These standards cover the roles of the Operations \nEvaluation Department and Private Sector Operations Department, the evaluation dimensions \nfor private sector operations, the nature of annual reporting, and dissemination of reports and \nlessons. According to the standards, the three principle dimensions for private sector evaluation \nare (i) development outcome, encompassing a project\u2019s performance, contribution to economic \nsustainability, and contribution to private sector development; (ii) investment profitability of the \nproject intervention to the institution itself (i.e., specific returns on the loan, guarantee, or equity \ninvestment);  and  (iii)  operational  effectiveness  measured  and  assessed  on  an  overall \ndevelopment level. \n \n40.  The  Project  was  assessed  and  described  from  the  perspectives  of  development \neffectiveness and project framework in terms of its specific performance, as well as the Project\u2019s \n                                                 \n9   Multilateral Development Banks Evaluation Cooperation Group. 2006.

The Project is deemed \ndevelopmentally effective and its performance measurable. The details are in the development \neffectiveness framework in Appendix 4. \n \nF.  Economic Evaluation \n \n41.  An economic analysis was conducted to measure the viability of the Project from the \nperspective  of  India\u2019s  economy.  All  costs  and  benefits  are  expressed  in  domestic  price \nnumeraire in 2007 constant values, with all taxes and duties excluded. \n \n42.  The major economic benefit from the Project is the value of electricity generated, which \nis fully absorbed at present levels of demand for electricity in Maharashtra. The state has been \nfacing worsening power shortages since 1998. The main reason for the energy and power \nshortages in the past decade is that the capacity additions have lagged significantly behind \ndemand growth. Hence, the electricity generated by the Project is considered to meet unmet \ndemand, i.e., it would not substitute power from any existing generation capacity, which means \nthe entire output from the Project is considered incremental. TPC has been assumed to supply \npower to distributors and bulk end consumers in the same proportion as it does now in the \nMumbai  license  area.  Although  the  Project\u2019s  eligibility  to  receive  the  CER  revenue  is  still \nuncertain, the economic analysis incorporated the CER revenue. Even if the Project is not \nentitled to the CER revenue, the same monetary amount is counted as part of the economic \nbenefits stemming from the positive external effects on the global environment. \n \n43.  Costs include the capital and labor costs to construct the Project, as well as the O&M \ncosts. A standard conversion factor is applied to non-traded items, and labor conversion factors \nare  used  for  unskilled  and  skilled  labor.  Tradable  inputs  are  valued  at  their  border  price \nequivalent  and  have  been  converted  to  domestic  equivalents  using  an  estimated  shadow \nexchange rate factor of 1.05. \n \n44.  The base case economic internal rate of return was estimated at above the social \ndiscount rate of 12%. \n \nVI.  THE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  ADB Loan \n \n45.  ADB will provide a local currency loan of up to Rs3.52 billion from its ordinary capital \nresources to TPC without a Government guarantee. Proceeds of the loan will be used for eligible \ncapital expenditures and civil works for the Project undertaken by TPC. Financial institutions \nacceptable to ADB will fully cover (through a guarantee or other acceptable financial instrument) \nup to Rs2.26 billion of the proposed loan. Under this structure, ADB\u2019s net exposure to the risk of \nTPC will be no more than Rs1.26 billion, which is 25% of the capital expenditure to which TPC \nplans to apply the proceeds of the loan. The balance of the exposure to TPC will be transferred \nto the guarantors, resulting in ADB being exposed to counterparty risk up to Rs2.26 billion. \n \n46.  The financing structure, whereby financial institutions participate in the loan through \nsyndication, risk or funded participation or by providing a guarantee or other acceptable financial \ninstrument to ADB is proposed for two reasons. First, this structure would catalyze risk-taking \ncapacity of international financial institutions that do not have rupee funding capacity, but have \nan appetite to take the risk associated with the loan to assist a borrower that needs long-term ", "10       \nrupee financing.10 Second, by transferring risk to a third party financial institution, ADB\u2019s net \nexposure to the risk of TPC would be reduced to the level within ADB\u2019s single project exposure \nlimit applicable for nonsovereign operations.11 \n \n47.  The proposed ADB loan will be documented in a loan agreement, which will contain \nstandard terms and conditions for private sector loans without a Government guarantee, as well \nas covenants relating to ADB\u2019s policies.12 The loan will be subject to conditions precedent to the \ndisbursement, including all necessary government, creditor, and shareholder approvals and \nconsents;  and  all  contractual  and  financial  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The  loan \nagreement will include (i) appropriate representations and warranties; (ii) covenants, including \naffirmative, negative, financial, and information covenants; and (iii) events of default. ADB also \nwill enter into a financing agreement with financial institutions acceptable to ADB pursuant to \nwhich ADB\u2019s participation in the financing will be covered by a guarantee or other acceptable \nfinancial  instrument  to  ADB.  Further,  ADB  might  enter  into  relevant  agreements  for  the \nsyndication or participation of the covered portion of the ADB loan. \n \nB.  Justification \n \n48.  The proposed loan merits ADB\u2019s support for the following reasons: \n \n(i)  The  proposed  ADB  loan  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  CSP  for  India,  which \nemphasizes  infrastructure  development,  private  sector  participation,  and \nrenewable energy development in the country. Particularly in the power sector, \npolicy  dialogue  by  the  South  Asia  Regional  Department  has  focused  on  (a) \nsupporting sector reform and restructuring, (b) enhancing energy efficiency and \nclean energy development, and (iii) promoting balanced physical infrastructure \ndevelopment. The proposed ADB loan is in line with this strategy and dovetails \nwith  the  efforts  including  ongoing  dialogues  with  the  Government  under  the \npublic sector operations. If approved, it will be the first financing by ADB of \nprivate sector renewable energy project. \n \n(ii)  The  proposed  ADB  loan  is  consistent  with  the  ADB\u2019s  energy  sector  policy \n(footnote  6).  It  also  forms  a  part  of  ADB\u2019s  clean  energy  and  environment \nprogram, which was launched in response to the communiqu\u00e9 by the Group of 8 \nGleneagles Summit in July 2005.13 The ADB\u2019s energy policy states that ADB will \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2006. Review of ADB\u2019s Credit Enhancement Operations. Manila. It highlights the importance of using credit \nenhancement products such as \u201csyndications\u201d to mobilize risk-taking capacity from commercial financing partners, \nand to diversify risk and leverage ADB\u2019s balance sheet. Paragraph 56 (ii) refers to the use of syndications, which \nenables ADB to transfer some or all of the risk associated with its direct loans to its financing partners, thereby \nreducing its credit exposure. Meanwhile, paragraph 57 (ii) explains that syndications through reinsurance (and \nguarantee arrangements as proposed in this RRP) enable ADB to share any associated recovery with other \nsyndicate members and assume counterparty risk. \n11 ADB. 1985. Bank Assistance to the Private Sector. Manila. Paras. 25\u201327 of this paper read: \u201cOne of the principal \nconcerns regarding this facility (lending without government guarantee) is that Bank loans to private enterprises \nwithout  a  DMC  (developing  member  country)  government  guarantee  will  inevitably  involve  higher  risk  in \ncomparison with loans guaranteed or relent through DMC governments\u2026..In the short term, the Bank will have to \nadopt  other  measures  to  minimize  and  safeguard  against  the  risk  of  providing  loans  without  government \nguarantee\u2026..Where necessary, the Bank could also seek a guarantee for its loan from a financial institution \nacceptable to the Bank, or obtain appropriate collateral arrangements or other forms of security.\u201d \n12 These covenants include compliance with ADB\u2019s (i) environmental and social safeguard policies; (ii) combating \nmoney laundering, antiterrorism, and anticorruption policies; and (iii) procurement policy to the extent that TPC \nmust use the loan proceeds for financing eligible goods and services procured from the ADB\u2019s member countries. \n13 Group of 8. 2005.

", "  11\npromote the development of renewable energy sources in developing member \ncountries, and that ADB also will assist in implementing such projects, preferably \nthrough  private  sector  involvement  to  ensure  their  sustainable  long-term \noperations. The clean energy and environment program includes implementation \nof renewable energy investment opportunities. \n \n(iii)  The proposed ADB loan helps increase power generation from renewable energy \nsources in India. India has been trying to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels \nand to develop renewable energy sources, which are abundant in the country, to \nincrease  energy  security  and  promote  environmentally  sustainable  economic \ndevelopment. The proposed ADB loan will assist in adding 10% more wind power \ngeneration capacity in the state of Maharashtra, and approximately 2.5% to the \ncountry. \n \n(iv)  The proposed ADB loan will help TPC finance projects that are adding significant \nvolumes of renewable energy sources to its portfolio. TPC\u2019s strategy is to reduce \nits dependence on oil and gas as a fuel. While this strategy will be implemented \nprimarily  by  pursuing  more  coal-fired  thermal  projects,  TPC  is  also  keen  to \ndevelop  wind  power  projects  in  view  of  the  RPS  requirement  that  MERC \nintroduced recently. The power generated by the Project will account for 6% of \nthe TPC\u2019s direct power sales in its Mumbai license area, and also will help other \nlicensees in the state to achieve their RPS requirements. \n \n(v)  The proposed ADB loan helps improve the country\u2019s environmental standards by \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Project will reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions by approximately 129,000 tons of carbon dioxide (CO ) per year and \n2\nby approximately 2.6 million tons of CO  during the minimum project life of 20 \n2\nyears. \n \n(vi)  The  introduction  of  a  risk  participation  facility,  as  well  as  syndication  and/or \nparticipation  arrangement,  catalyzes  the  financing  capacity  of  other  financial \ninstitutions, which is in line with ADB\u2019s credit enhancement operations policy \n(footnote 14). Through the use of its risk participation facility, the proposed ADB \nloan will catalyze Rs2.26 billion (approximately equivalent to $51.0 million) of risk-\ntaking  capacity  by  commercial  banks.  The  risk  sharing  scheme  particularly \nmobilizes  the  capacity  of  international  banks,  which  do  not  have  a  strong \ncapacity to provide direct long-term rupee financing, but have sufficient capacity \nto take part in the risk participation arrangement with ADB. In addition, ADB \nmight syndicate part of the covered portion to other financial institutions, reducing \nits net exposure. \n \n(vii)  The  proposed  ADB  loan,  which  will  provide  long-term,  fixed-interest  rupee \nfinancing, will offer the best possible solution to the Borrower under current \nmarket circumstances. The Borrower values such long-term, fixed-interest rupee \nfinancing by ADB since such a product is not readily available in Indian financial \nmarkets. As most of TPC\u2019s revenues are in Indian rupees, the rupee financing \nhelps avoid a currency mismatch between revenues and expenditures. The feed-\nin tariff for wind energy projects does not allow financing costs to be passed \nthrough. As such, the long-term, fixed-interest rate will increase stability of the \nProject\u2019s financing plan. This also will help to make wind energy generation a ", "12       \n\u201cstand alone\u201d business, thereby encouraging more investments by Indian and \nforeign utilities. \n \nC.  Anticorruption  Policy,  and  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of \nTerrorism \n \n49.  TPC  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  policies  on  anticorruption14  and  combating  of  money \nlaundering and the financing of terrorism.15 Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB will require TPC to maintain and comply with internal \nprocedures  and  controls  following  international  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of \npreventing  corruption,  money  laundering  activities,  or  the  financing  of  terrorism.  TPC  will \ncovenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. The financing documentation \nbetween ADB and TPC will allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these \nundertakings. \n \nVII.  INVESTMENT LIMITATIONS \n \n50.  Once approved, the proposed loan of up to Rs3.52 billion to TPC will represent 3.1% of \nADB\u2019s private sector operations\u2019 portfolio, and will exceed the single project and group exposure \nlimits (Table 1). If the portion of the loan covered (by a guarantee or other acceptable financial \ninstrument) by financial institutions is deducted from the computation of the exposure to TPC \nrisk, the residual net exposure to TPC would be up to the equivalent of $28.3 million. Although \nthis net exposure is within the single project limit, it still will exceed the group exposure limit by \nthe equivalent of $14.7 million. After considering these breaches, ADB\u2019s Risk Management Unit \nsupports a waiver of each of these limits for the proposed ADB assistance. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 1998.

Growth of Generation Capacity \n \n1.  As the Indian power sector has grown, the country has become increasingly dependent \non fossil fuels. With the recent hike of oil and gas prices, as well as the expected shortages of \nfossil fuels in the future, the security of India\u2019s energy supply is generating increasing concern. \nThe environmental concern over excess use of fossil fuels also is rising. In this context, India \nurgently needs to explore sustainable energy development, and the Government has been \nworking proactively to promote use of renewable energy sources. \n \n2.  Among the renewable power resources available in India, wind energy is a promising \nsource for further development. India has 45,000 megawatts (MW) of gross potential, assuming \n1% of land availability for wind power generation in the potential areas. Sites with annual mean \nwind density exceeding 200 watts per square meter are considered suitable for wind power \nprojects, and 211 such sites have been identified in the country. However, technical potential is \nlimited  to  only  13,000  MW,  assuming  20%  grid  penetration,  which  will  rise  with  the \naugmentation of grid capacity in potential states. As of September 2006, India had installed \nwind power capacity of more than 6,000 MW, ranking the country fourth in the world after \nGermany, Spain, and the United States. In the 10th Five Year Plan for fiscal year (FY) 2002 to \n2007 targets a 1,500 MW increase of installed wind power capacity. However, 3,017.55 MW is \nlikely to be installed.1 The installed wind power capacity and gross potential in India by state is \nin Table A1. \n \nTable A1: Installed Wind Power Capacity and Potential in India by State \n(MW) \nAs of  As of  As of \nState  Gross Potential \n31 March 2005  31 March 2006  30 September 2006 \nAndhra Pradesh  120.5  121.0  121.0  8,275 \nGujarat  253.5  338.1  375.6  9,675 \nKarnataka  410.8  584.6  687.5  6,620 \nKerala  2.0  2.0  2.0  875 \nMadhya Pradesh  28.9  40.3  53.0  5,500 \nMaharashtra  456.2  1,001.3  1,241.7  3,650 \nRajastan  284.8  358.1  385.9  1,700 \nTamil Nadu  2,034.9  2,892.5  3,148.1  5,400 \nWest Bengal  1.1  1.1  1.6  3,050 \nOthers  1.6  1.6  1.6  450 \nTotal  3,594.3  5,340.6  6,018.0  45,195 \nMW = megawatt. \nSource: Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. \n \n3.

The Government created the Commission for Additional \nSources of Energy in 1981 and Department of Non-Conventional Energy Sources in 1982. The \nDepartment of Non-Conventional Energy Sources was transformed into the Ministry of Non-\nConventional Energy Sources (MNES) in 1992, and then was renamed as the Ministry of New \nand Renewable Energy (MNRE) in 2006. MNRE is the nodal ministry in the Government for all \nmatters relating to new and renewable energy. Its main functions include (i) policy making and \nplanning,  (ii)  program  formulation  and  implementation,  (iii)  research  and  development,  (iv) \ntechnology  development  and  commercialization,  (v)  promotion  of  demonstration  and  pilot \nprojects, and (vi) implementation of fiscal and financial incentives. \n \n5.  MNES (currently MNRE) established the Centre for Wind Energy Technology at Chennai \nas an autonomous research and development institution of the Government, and as a technical \nfocal point for wind power development in the country. The center provides developers with \ntechnical services, including wind resource assessment for project sites, testing and certification \nservices for equipment, and training and capacity building services. \n \n6.  Technological advancements are increasing gradually the commercial viability of wind \npower projects. The replacement of old 250 kilowatt wind turbines at a height of 30 meter (m) \nwith 1 MW single unit size at 50 m height has made them more attractive as investments. \nHigher wind power density due to increased height, lower installation cost per MW, and less \nland requirement make a case for choosing higher unit size of wind turbines. India\u2019s advantage \nis that wind turbines of 1 MW or above are being manufactured in the country. \n \n7.  Fiscal and financial incentives provided by the Government and the state governments \ntraditionally have driven the development of wind power projects in India. The incentives being \nprovided by the Government include (i) 80% accelerated depreciation of project costs for wind \npower  projects;  (ii)  concessions  or  full exemption  of certain  imported  components  of  wind \nturbines;  (iii)  tax  holiday  for  a  maximum  of  10  consecutive  years  within  15  years  of \ncommissioning,  which  is  available  for  infrastructure  projects;  and  (iv)  concessional  loans2 \navailable  through  Government-owned  agencies,  including  Indian  Renewable  Energy \nDevelopment Agency Limited, Power Finance Corporation Limited, and Rural Electrification \nCorporation Limited. The government of Maharashtra allows (i) captive use and third party sales \nof power, (ii) 2% of energy as wheeling and 5% as transmission and distribution losses, (iii) \nelectricity banking arrangements for 12 months, and (iv) a feed-in tariff of Rs3.5 per kilowatt-\nhour (kWh) for the first year after commissioning and annual tariff escalation of Rs0.15 up to the \n13th year. The state government also provides assistance to set up evacuation arrangements \nand associated infrastructure. \n \n8.  Recently, the focus of the regulatory framework for the renewable energy sector has \nchanged  from  being  driven  by  the  supply  side  to  being  driven  by  the  demand  side.  The \nElectricity Act, 20033 requires all state-level energy regulatory commissions to ensure that \nelectricity  distributors  procure  a  specified  minimum  percentage  of  power  generation  from \n                                                 \n2  The concessional loans may not be \u201cconcessional,\u201d especially for borrowers with high credit. \n3  Section 86 of the Electricity Act, 2003 states: \u201cThe State Commission shall discharge the following functions, \nnamely:\u2026(e) promote cogeneration and generation of electricity from renewable sources of energy by providing \nsuitable measures for connectivity with the grid and sale of electricity to any person, and also specify, for purchase \nof electricity from such sources, a percentage of the total consumption of electricity in the area of a distribution \nlicense;\u2026\u201d ", "    Appendix 1  17\nrenewable energy sources. The midterm appraisal of the 10th Five Year Plan by Planning \nCommission (footnote 1)  included the following recommendations for the renewable energy \nsector: \n \n(i)  Switch incentives and support from the supply-driven programs to demand-driven \nprograms and technologies. \n(ii)  Explore alternative subsidy structures that encourage utilities to integrate wind, \nsmall hydroelectric, cogeneration, etc., into their systems. \n(iii)  Phase out capital subsidies linked to the creation of renewable capacity in favor \nof subsidies linked to renewable energy generated. \n(iv)  State electricity regulatory commissions should mandate the purchase of energy \nfrom renewable sources, as per the provisions of the Electricity Act. \n(v)  Improve coordination and synergize the programs of MNES (currently MNRE) \nwith similar programs of other central ministries and state governments. \n \n9.  Based  on  the  relevant  section  of  the  Electricity  Act,  2003,  as  well  as  the \nrecommendations by the Planning Commission, the state government introduced the concept of \nrequired purchase specification (RPS) in 2006. The RPS is the percentage of total energy inputs \nthat licensed distributors in the state of Maharashtra are obliged to procure from renewable \nenergy sources. The RPS, set at 3% for FY2007, increases by 1 percentage point annually until \nreaching 6% in FY2010. While failure to meet the RPS for FY2007 does not carry a penalty, any \nlicensed distributor that does not achieve the RPS in FY2008 will be required to pay Rs5 per \nkWh of shortfall. The penalty rate will increase to Rs6 per kWh in FY2009 and Rs7 per kWh in \nFY2010. The RPS requirement has been designed based on the existing renewable energy \ngeneration capacity in the state and the planned capacity addition. The targets are expected to \nbe achieved without a major impact on the end-user tariff. ", "18      Appendix 2 \nTHE TATA POWER COMPANY LIMITED \n \nA.  Overview \n \n1.

TPC\u2019s board of directors has established several board committees, such as an audit \ncommittee, a remuneration committee, a shareholders\u2019 and investors\u2019 grievance committee, a ", "20      Appendix 2 \nmanagement  committee,  and  an  ethics  and  compliance  committee.  The  audit  committee, \nchaired by an independent director, comprises of one more independent director and one \ndirector representing the promoter. All members of the audit committee are qualified to interpret \nand understand financial statements. The ethics and compliance committee supervises the \ncompliance of TPC\u2019s employees with the code of conduct for prevention of insider trading and \nthe code of corporate disclosure practice. These codes are being adopted in accordance with \nthe Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992, \nas amended. \n \n7.  A managing director under the supervision and control of the board of directors handles \nthe  day-to-day  management  of  TPC.  The  managing  director,  Mr.  P.  R.  Menon,  who  was \npreviously managing director of Tata Chemicals Limited, was appointed to the current position \nwith effect from 16 October 2006. As of 31 March 2006, TPC had 2,870 employees, including \n1,116 officers and 1,754 other staff. \n \n8.  As a member of the Tata Group, TPC complies with the Tata Code of Conduct, which \nunderpins the Tata Group\u2019s good reputation and brand image. It prohibits employees of Tata \nGroup  companies  from  engaging  in  corrupt  practices,  and  promotes  transparent,  fair,  and \nethical business behavior. Based on this code of conduct, Tata Group companies also are \nencouraged to be good corporate citizens and to undertake corporate social responsibility \nactivities. TPC also adopted a \u201cwhistle blower\u201d policy to give employees a mechanism to report \nto management concerns about unethical behavior, actual or suspected fraud, or violations of \nthe company\u2019s code of conduct or ethics policy. \n \nD.  Operations \n \n9.  TPC has an installed capacity of 2,323 MW. Its list of power stations is in Table A2.3. \nThe  power  stations  in  the  state  of  Maharashtra  supply  bulk  energy  to  licensees  and  to \nconsumers in the Mumbai license area. The Jojobera power station is dedicated primarily to \nmeet the captive power requirement of the Tata Iron and Steel Company Limited (TISCO), while \nthe  energy  generated  by  the  Belgaum  power  station  is  sold  to  the  Karnataka  Power \nTransmission Corporation Limited. \n \nTable A2.3: Tata Power Company\u2019s Power Stations \nLocation  Installed \nPower Station  Fuel \n(state)  Capacity (MW) \nTrombay  Maharashtra  1,350  Oil or Gas or Coal \nBhira  Maharashtra  300  Hydro \nBhivpuri  Maharashtra  75  Hydro \nKhopoli  Maharashtra  72  Hydro \nJojobera  Jharkhand  428  Coal \nBelgaum  Karnataka  81  Diesel Oil \nSupa  Maharashtra  17  Wind \nTotal    2,323   \nMW = megawatt. \nSource: The Tata Power Company Limited. \n \n10.  More than half of TPC\u2019s generation capacity used to rely on oil. However, with the recent \nhigh market price of oil, TPC has reduced dependence on oil and increased the use of coal. \nTPC\u2019s fuel mix in FY2006 is as in Table A2.4. Coal is procured from Indonesia. TPC secures \n88% of its coal requirements under 5-year contracts, which can be extended for another 5 years ", "    Appendix 2  21\nat TPC\u2019s option. The imported coal contains low sulfur and ash compared to that available from \nother sources, especially domestic coal mines. About 40% of thermal generation depends on \nlow-sulfur heavy fuel oil, which is sourced domestically from Indian Oil Corporation Limited, \nBharat Petroleum Company Limited, and Hindustan Petroleum Company Limited. Due to the \nreduction in the allocation of Bombay High Crude to these three local refineries by Oil and \nNatural  Gas  Corporation  Limited,  the  availability  of  low-sulfur  heavy  fuel  oil  might  not  be \nadequate in the future. TPC has started initiatives to reduce its dependence on oil by ensuring \nthat capacity augmentation at the Trombay power station would be coal-based. The availability \nof gas from Bombay High fields also is decreasing every year. Additional gas in the Mumbai \narea will be available with the commissioning of the Dahej\u2013Uran pipeline, which is expected to \nbe operational in February 2007. TPC is in talk with Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited \nand Gail India Limited to augment gas supplies. \n \nTable A2.4: Tata Power Company\u2019s Fuel Mix in FY2006 \n(%) \nFuel  Based on generation  Based on fuel costs \nCoal  32  22 \nOil  37  73 \nGas  13  5 \nHydro  18  0 \nTotal  100  100 \nSource: The Tata Power Company Limited. \n \n11.  TPC maintains strong operating efficiency. Plant availability is nearly 95%. Plant load \nfactor of TPC\u2019s thermal power plants is 78%\u201382%, which exceeds the country\u2019s average level of \n73%. \n \n12.  TPC is meticulously planning and implementing energy conservation measures and \nsystem upgrades. These include commissioning new substations and enhancing cable and \ntransmission network to improve the quality and reliability of the power supply continuously. \nTPC has achieved a low transmission and distribution loss of 2.1%. TPC owns and operates a \ntransmission and distribution network spread across Mumbai, comprising (i) an overhead line \nnetwork of about 1,200 circuit kilometer (km) at 220 kilovolts (kV), 110 kV, 22 kV, and 5 kV; (ii) a \ndistribution network spread over the entire license area in Mumbai and suburbs; and (iii) an \nunderground cable network of about 745 km at 6.6 kV, 11 kV, 22 kV, 33 kV, 110 kV, and 220 \nkV.  TPC  also  owns  and  operates  major  transformation  facilities,  comprising  (i)  20  major \nreceiving stations at key locations, (ii) compact and reliable 220 kV gas-insulated substations at \nfour of its receiving stations, and (iii) numerous consumer substations near consumer load \ncenters.  \n \n13.  Apart from the energy generated by the Jojobera power station and the Belgaum power \nstation,  most  of  the  power  generated  by  TPC  is  sold  in  its  Mumbai  license  area.  The \nBrihanmumbai Electricity Supply & Transport Undertaking (BEST) and Reliance Energy Limited \n(REL), which sell power in their retail networks, are the two largest clients of TPC. TPC also \nsells power directly to large consumers, including the Mumbai port, refineries, textile mills, \nfertilizer plants, industrial units, and residential and commercial complexes. Further, TPC sells \npower to the customers outside of the license area, including Maharashtra State Electricity \nBoard and Tata Power Trading Company Limited. A breakdown of TPC\u2019s power sales in the \nMumbai license area in FY2006 is provided in Table A2.5. \n \n ", "22      Appendix 2 \nTable A2.5: Tata Power Company\u2019s Power Sales in the Mumbai License Area (FY2006) \nCustomer  GWh  Percent \nBEST  4,156  38 \nREL  3,924  35 \nRailways  765  7 \nOthers  1,576  14 \nSales in License Area  10,421  94 \nMSEB, MPEB, TPTCL  686  6 \n  Total  11,107  100 \nBEST = Brihanmumbai Electricity Supply & Transport Undertaking, FY = fiscal \nyear, GWh = gigawatt-hour, MPEB = Madhya Pradesh State Electricity Board, \nMSEB = Maharashtra State Electricity Board, REL = Reliance Energy Limited, \nTPTCL = Tata Power Trading Company Limited. \nSource: The Tata Power Company Limited. \n \n14.  The payment record of TPC\u2019s customers is good, and payments by BEST and REL in \nparticular never have been delayed. TPC has a power sales agreement only with BEST, and it \ncame up for renewal in August, 2005. The renewed agreement between TPC and BEST is \nawaiting ratification by Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC). The power \nsupply agreement with REL is also under discussion. TPC has entered into a power supply \nagreement  with  Hindustan  Petroleum  Corporation  Limited  for  the supply  of  48 MW  for  its \nexpansion project. \n \nE.  Subsidiaries \n \n15.  TPC  owns  various  subsidiaries  mainly  in  the  power  business  (Table  A2.6).  During \nFY2005, TPC sold its shares in Tata Petrodyne Limited, which was engaged in the exploration \nand production of crude oil and natural gas, to Tata Sons Limited. To focus on major projects in \nits core business, TPC in FY2006 also sold its shares in Tata Power Broadband Company \nLimited and in Alaknanda Hydro Power Company Limited, as those companies are not aligned \nwith its current strategy. \n \nTable A2.6: Summary of Tata Power Company\u2019s Subsidiaries \nName  TPC\u2019s  Business  Performance and/or Status \nShareholding \nAf-Taab  100%  Investment vehicle.
