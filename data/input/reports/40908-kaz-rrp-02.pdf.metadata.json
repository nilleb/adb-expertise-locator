This proposed \nloan  is  focused  on  lending  to  small  and  medium  enterprises \n(SMEs) in Kazakhstan.  \n \nBank TuranAlem JSC \n \nTargeting classification: General intervention \nSector: Finance \nSubsectors: Banking systems, finance sector development, small \nand medium-scale enterprises \nThemes: Sustainable economic growth, private sector \ndevelopment \nSubthemes: Promoting economic efficiency and enabling markets, \nprivate sector investment \n \nTo assist BTA in growing its SME loan portfolios by providing part \nof the needed debt funding and in turn assist the Government of \nKazakhstan in its efforts to steer the Kazakh economy towards a \nmore  sustainable  SME-led  growth  and  to  diversify  from  the \ndominance and dependence on natural resources industries.  \n \nThe Kazakhstan economy is heavily dominated by and dependent \nupon  its  oil  and  other  natural  resources  exports.  The  SME  and \nmanufacturing  sectors  are  currently  underrepresented  in  the \nnational  economy.  However,  the  SME  sector  is  relatively  more \nlabor-intensive,  contributing  approximately  40%  of  employment. \nSME growth is hence significantly more inclusive and \u201cpro-poor\u201d in \nnature,  and  therefore  it  is  of  key  importance  to  create  conditions \nfor growth of the SME sector.  \n \nOne  of \nfor  SME \ndevelopment  in  Kazakhstan  is  difficulty  in  accessing  capital, \nespecially  debt  financing.  For  the  companies  that  drive  pro-poor \ngrowth,  such  as  manufacturing-sector  SMEs, \nis  a \nconstraint. If Kazakhstan is to move out of its heavy dependence \non oil exports and to further develop SMEs\u2014and especially in the \nto  be \nmanufacturing  sector\u2014then \novercome. \n \nThe proposed loan is justified for the following reasons: \n \nDevelopment  Impact.  Diversification  of  the  economy  toward \nnon-oil  investments  is  crucial  for  Kazakhstan\u2019s  sustainable  and \ninclusive  economic  development.  Kazakhstan \ntwo \nchallenges  in  creating  a  sustainable  economic  base  for  after  the \noil boom recedes. The first is to achieve economic diversification, \nboth  through  strengthening  the  non-oil  sectors  of  the  real \n\nthe  most  pressing  problems \n\nthese  hurdles  will  have \n\nidentified \n\nfunding \n\nfaces \n\n\feconomy  and  through  appropriate  diversification  of  its  growing \nfinancial  assets.  Improving  access  to  finance  by  SMEs  helps  to \nachieve  both  of  these.  The  second  challenge  is  to  improve \ntransparency standards in the financing of private firms, especially \nSMEs. ADB\u2019s proposed loans will directly contribute to expanded \nfinancial  intermediation  to  SMEs,  including  those  in  rural  areas, \nvia  the  existing  and  growing  branch  networks  of  the  selected \nbanks, and they will foster the diversification of loan portfolios.  \n \nValue  Added  by  ADB.  ADB\u2019s  proposed  loan  will  add  value  by \n(i) enabling  BTA  to  grow  its  SME  loan  portfolios;  (ii) providing \naccess  to  longer  maturities,  thus  matching  assets  and  liabilities; \nand (iii) increasing depositor confidence in Kazakhstan\u2019s relatively \nyoung banking market. ADB\u2019s loans would be specifically targeted \nat  SMEs  and  will  contribute  to  strengthening  the  selected  banks\u2019 \ncapacity to serve the SME sector.  \n \nEnvironment category: FI \nIndigenous peoples and resettlement category: C \n \n\n \nEnvironmental and \nSocial Guidelines \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nii \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nsenior loan of up to $75 million to Bank TuranAlem (BTA). BTA is focused on lending to small \nand medium enterprises (SMEs) in Kazakhstan.  \n  \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n\nKazakhstan Economy: Overview and Outlook \n\nA. \n \n2. \nKazakhstan  maintained  its  solid  economic  growth  in  2005  (in  excess  of  9%  during \nJanuary\u2013September  2005)  that  is  based  on  foreign  direct  investments  in  the  energy  sector, \nincreased pipeline export capacity, conservative fiscal and monetary policy balancing increased \npublic  programs  with  price  stability,  and  strong  banking  system  regulation  and  supervision. \nContinued fiscal discipline seems likely, with approval of the 2006 budget deficit at 1.4% of GDP. \nFor 2006, GDP growth is predicted to be sustained at 8.5%. The country has benefited in recent \ntimes from higher oil prices and greater exports, both of which have increased foreign currency \ninflow  and  assisted  debt-servicing  efforts.  For  these  economic  strengths,  Kazakhstan  is  rated \nBaa3  by  Moody\u2019s  and  BBB  by  Standard  and  Poor\u2019s  with  a  positive/stable  outlook.  For  more \ndetails on the economic assessment, please refer to Appendix 1. \n \n3. \nNevertheless, Kazakhstan\u2019s high dependence on oil exports poses a potential threat for \nthe economy given potential volatility in the international oil market. To mitigate such risk, in this \ntime of growth, the Kazakhstan Government has created a National Fund that would, if needed, \nreduce  the  country\u2019s  vulnerability  to  external  commodity  price  shocks.  Moreover,  the \nGovernment is pushing hard for higher diversification of the economy, especially by promoting \nthe  SME  sector  alongside  strong  commercial  development  of  the  financial  (principally  the \nbanking) sector.  \n \nB. \n \n\nSmall and Medium Enterprises\u2019 Contribution to the Economy   \n\n1. \n\nSMEs\u2019 Contribution to the Economy and Government Focus \n\n4. \nThe  Kazakhstan  economy  is  heavily  dominated  by  and  dependent  on  its  oil  and  other \nnatural resources exports. The SME and manufacturing sectors are currently underrepresented \nin the national economy.1 However, the SME sector is relatively more labor-intensive, providing \napproximately 40% of total employment. SME growth is hence significantly more inclusive and \n\u201cpro-poor\u201d  in  nature,  and  therefore  creating  conditions  for  growth  of  the  SME  sector  is  of  key \nimportance.  \n \n5. \nConsequently,  SME  development  has  become  a  focus  area  for  the  Kazakhstan \nGovernment.  It  has  a  declared  policy  of  fostering  the  development  of SMEs,  and  especially  of \nsmall businesses, by promulgating certain SME laws2 and establishing several organizations to \nimplement this policy.3  \n\n                                                 \n1  The SME sector is estimated to have contributed only 14%\u201315% of GDP in 2005. \n2  Law on State Support to Development of Small Business in the Republic of Kazakhstan. \n3\n  The  policy  has  included  various  support  measures,  provision  of  services  via  business  development  centers,  and \nsmall business loans. There is also an exhibition and information center (a wholly state-owned joint-stock company) \nthat works in accordance with the Government's program to support SMEs. In addition, the Government set up the \nSME Support Fund in 1997 as a nonbanking financial institution. The main objective of the fund is to effectively use \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nScarcity of Capital as Major Constraint for Small and  Medium Enterprise \nDevelopment \n\nIn  a  survey  on  small  businesses  conducted  by  UNDP, 4  one  of  the  most  pressing \n6. \nproblems identified for SME development was the difficulty in accessing capital, especially debt \nfinancing. For the companies that drive pro-poor growth, such as manufacturing-sector SMEs, \nfunding  is  a  serious  constraint.  Sources  of  credit  were  mostly  family  and  friends,  as  well  as \nmoneylenders in an informal sector.5 If Kazakhstan wants to move out of its heavy dependence \non  oil  exports  and  to  further  develop  the  SME  segment\u2014and  especially  the  manufacturing \nsector\u2014then these hurdles will have to be overcome. \n \nC. \n \n\nBanking Sector in Kazakhstan \n\n1. \n\nIntroduction \n\nKazakhstan\u2019s  financial  sector  has  grown  rapidly  in  recent  years,  with  improvements  in \n7. \nthe  economic  and  operating  environment  through  the  past  5  years  leading  to  enhanced \ncreditworthiness  and  commercial  profiles  for  the  domestic  banking  sector.  In  particular,  the \nGovernment  and  National  Bank  of  Kazakhstan  (NBK),  the  central  bank,  have  undertaken \nstructural  reforms  aimed  at  promoting  consolidation  and  improving  the  overall  viability  of  the \nbanking system. \n \n8. \nEncouraged  by  the  improving  macroeconomic  environment  and  robust  growth,  Kazakh \nbanks have increased lending volumes by an average of more than 40% per year in the last 5 \nyears  (albeit  from  a  very  low  base)  while  generally  maintaining  healthy  asset  quality  and \nprofitability. This is especially true for the top performers within the first two tiers of the banking \nsystem.  Market  observers  expect  this  pace  of  growth  to  be  sustained  throughout  2006.  While \nfocusing mainly on the domestic market, some Kazakh banks are increasingly expanding their \noperations  in  other  regional  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States  (CIS)  countries,  including \nKyrgyz  Republic,  Russia,  and  Ukraine,  in  order  to  expand  and  diversify  their  businesses  and \nmarket exposures. \n \n9. \nKazakhstan\u2019s  financial  sector  has  several  strong  points  compared  with  those  of  other \nCentral  Asian  and  CIS  countries.  First,  the  size  of  the  sector  relative  to  GDP  is  significantly \nlarger than are those in other Central Asian countries. The ratio of bank credit to GDP reached \n27%  in  2004,  which  is  roughly  twice  as  high  as  those  in  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Tajikistan,  and \nUzbekistan.6 Second, while the development of the local bond markets has lagged behind that \nof  the  banking  system,  domestic  pension  funds  have  increasingly  emerged  as  important \ninvestors in the local bond market since the launch of the pension reform in 1998. The steadily \naccumulating  pension  funds  provide  a  supply  of  long-term  funds  that  is  lacking  in  most \n\nfinancial resources allocated within the framework of state and regional programs for projects and activities aimed \nat  supporting  SMEs.  The  fund  is  tasked  to  (i)  broaden  access  to  finance  for  SMEs,  (ii)  effectively  use  state  and \nnonstate resources aimed at SME support, (iii) develop SME infrastructure, and (iv) provide consultations for SMEs. \n\n4  United Nations Development Program (UNDP). 2002.  \n5  As  of  end  1999,  only  about  20%  of  the  private  sector  credit  came  from  commercial  banking.  To  access  funds \noutside the formal  banking sector, businesspersons reported that they often were forced to operate in the informal \nsector  so  that  the  identities  of  those  supplying  them  with  funds  could  be  concealed.  Repayment  is  enforced  by \nsocial pressure (and also the fear of physical harm). \n\n6  However,  27%  bank  credit  to  GDP  remains  quite  low  when  compared  to  more  developed  markets,  where  it  is \n\ntypically near or even above 100%. \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nemerging markets, including many other former Central Asian and CIS countries. Third, the core \nlegal framework for the financial sector is already in place.  \n \n\n2. \n\nOverview \n\n10. \nThe  commercial  banks  in  Kazakhstan  can  be  divided  into  four  groups:  (i)  large  local \nbanks (Tier I Banks),7 such as BTA and its principal competitors, which are Kazkommertsbank \n(KKB)  and  Halyk  Bank;  (ii)  banks  under  foreign  ownership,  such  as  ABN  AMRO  Bank \nKazakhstan, HSBC Bank Kazakhstan and Citibank Kazakhstan; (iii) second tier (Tier II Banks) \nmedium-sized banks with a regional footprint; and (iv) smaller local banks. The decrease in the \nnumber  of  banks  from  184  in  1996  to  the  current  348 is  primarily  attributable  to  the  ongoing \nsector reform undertaken by NBK.  \n \n11. \nReform  of  the  banking  sector  began  in  1996  with  the  introduction  of  international \nprudential standards, including requirements on capital adequacy, liquidity ratios, transparency \nas to the auditing of banks by local and international auditors, harmonization of local accounting \npractices  to  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (IFRS),  and  personnel  training \nprograms. In addition, NBK required commercial banks to adopt recapitalization and corporate \nenhancement plans with the aim of boosting their abilities to attract long-term, private investors. \nIn  2000,  guidelines  were  established  for  bank  inspections  and  for  periodic  reporting  by \ncommercial  banks  to  NBK  (and  now  also  to  the  Financial  Markets  Supervisory  Agency,  or \nFMSA, which currently is the banking supervision body in Kazakhstan). In 2003, all banks were \nrequested to develop and install internal risk management systems. \n  \n\n3. \n\nCredit Standing of Commercial Banks \n\n12. \nThe financial standings of Kazakhstan\u2019s banks vary. As of 30 September 2005, 18 of the \n34 commercial banks had registered capital of over T2 billion, 15 banks had registered capital of \nover  T2  billion,  15  banks  had  share  capital  of  T1  billion  to  T2  billion,  and  one  bank  had \nregistered capital of T500 million to T1 billion. There are no banks with registered capital of less \nthan  T500  million,  and  any  bank  whose  capital  falls  below  this  level  is  required  to  submit  to \nFMSA an application for voluntary reorganization into an entity performing only limited banking \noperations.  As  of  30  September  2005,  aggregate  provisions  of  Kazakh  banks  on  overdue \nreceivables were T52.5 billion. \n \n13. \nAs  of  31  December  2005,  all  of  the  commercial  banks  licensed  in  Kazakhstan  were  in \ncompliance with prudential regulatory requirements on capital adequacy, single borrower limits, \nliquidity ratios, foreign currency limits, and reserve requirements. As of 31 December 2004, two \ncommercial  banks  had  failed  to  comply  with  seven  prudential  regulatory  requirements, \ncompared to one bank out of compliance as of 31 December 2003 and one as of 31 December \n2002 (BTA was not among these banks). The banks out of compliance did not meet any of the \ncurrent liquidity ratios, own capital ratios, single borrower exposure ratio, open currency position \nratio and maximum asset investment ratio. Provisions for bad debts of all banks operating in the \nKazakhstan banking sector as of 31 August 2005 totaled T52.5 billion. \n \n\n                                                 \n7  Technically,  NBK  would  be  the  first  tier.  The  terminology  used  here  therefore  only  refers  to  commercial  banks \n\nbelow NBK. \n\n8  As  of  August  2005,  there  were  34  banks  operating  in  Kazakhstan,  excluding  NBK,  which  included  two  fully \nstate-owned  special-purpose  banks  and  14  banks  under  foreign  ownership.  As  of  mid-2004,  there  were  27 \nrepresentative offices of foreign banks. \n\n \n\n\fIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED INVESTMENT \n\nProject Selection \n\nA. \n \n14.  Missions to Kazakhstan, in April and November 2005, respectively, by the Private Sector \nOperations Department (PSOD) met with key Government officials and identified several banks \nfor potential cooperation. These missions were preceded by a visit of ADB\u2019s Board to the region \nthat  identified  an  urgent  need  for  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  to  increase  its presence  in \nthe market. This mandate aligns with the recognition in the Medium Term Strategy II paper of \nMarch 2006 that the financial sector represents the top \u201cCore I\u201d focus for ADB. Subsequently, \nthe Private Sector Operations Division (PSOP) of PSOD has deepened discussions with banks \nin Kazakhstan.  \n \n15. \nADB  has  just  started  to  explore  private  sector  opportunities  in  Kazakhstan  and  other \nCentral Asian republics, as these countries\u2019 framework agreements with ADB have been signed \nonly  recently.  To  create  a  sustainable  footprint  for  ADB  in  this  region,  from  both  the  risk  and \ndevelopmental perspectives, PSOP has taken a balanced approach and chosen two countries \nfor its first moves: Azerbaijan9 and Kazakhstan. ADB recognizes that Kazakhstan is certainly a \nmore developed country in the CIS region. \n \nB. \n \n\nBank TuranAlem \n\n1. \n\nOverview and History \n\nBank TuranAlem JSC (TuranAlem or BTA) is a leading commercial bank in Kazakhstan, \n16. \nheadquartered in Almaty, and offering a full range of traditional banking products and services. \nBTA  was  incorporated  in  January  1997  as  a  closed  joint-stock  company  and  arose  from  the \nrestructuring and merger of two state-owned banks, Alem Bank and Turan Bank, pursuant to a \ndecision of the Government and NBK. Having been recapitalized by the Government, BTA was \nfully privatized at a competitive auction in March 1998 and reorganized from a closed joint-stock \ncompany  into  an  open  joint-stock company  in  December  1998.  By  September  2003,  the  bank \nhad completed its reregistration as a joint-stock company and had adopted a new charter.  \n \n\n2. \n\nBTA\u2019s Business \n\nBTA\u2019s principal business areas include corporate banking, retail banking, trade finance, \n\n17. \ncredit and debit card services, and currency and securities trading. \n \n\nCorporate Banking \n\na. \n \n\nBTA has a wide range of corporate customers, including many of the country\u2019s leading \n18. \nindustrial  companies  but  primarily  SMEs.  A  major  part  of  BTA\u2019s  business  with  respect  to \ncorporates  consists  of  providing  trade  finance  and  short-term  credit  facilities,  mostly  in  tenge \nand US dollars. These include letters of credit, guarantees, and working capital. \n  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2006.

The first is to achieve economic diversification, both through strengthening the \nnon-oil  sectors  of  the  real  economy  and  through  appropriate  diversification  of  its  growing \nfinancial  assets,  particularly  through  improving  access  to  finance  by  SMEs.  The  second  is  to \nimprove  standards  of  transparency  in  the  financing  of  private  firms,  especially  SMEs.  ADB\u2019s \nproposed loans will directly contribute to expanding financial intermediation to SMEs\u2014including \n\n \n \n\n22. \n  \n\nA. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\nthose in rural areas\u2014via the existing and growing branch network of the selected banks, as well \nas foster the diversification of loan portfolios.  \n \n25. \nAs discussed in Section II, the diversification of the economy toward non-oil investments \nis  a  crucial  factor  for  Kazakhstan\u2019s  sustainable  and  inclusive  economic  development.  While \noverall investment ratios have been increasing over the past few years, the investment ratio for \nthe  non-oil  sectors  has  remained  stagnant  at  around  7%  of  GDP.10 Although  the  country  is \nmodernizing  its  extractive  industries,  with  mining  and  metals  contributing  significantly  to  the \nlocal economy, non-oil exports have been sluggish at around $2 billion since 1997.11 \n \n\n3. \n\nValue Added of ADB  \n\nADB\u2019s proposed loans will add value by (i) enabling BTA to grow its SME loan portfolios; \n26. \n(ii)  providing  access  to  longer  maturities,  thus  better  matching  assets  and  liabilities;  and  (iii) \nincreasing depositor confidence in Kazakhstan\u2019s relatively young banking market. ADB\u2019s loans \nwould be specifically targeted at SMEs and will contribute to strengthening the selected banks\u2019 \ncapacity to serve the SME sector.  \n \n\n4. \n\nMeasures for Development Impact \n\nPSOP  will  measure  the  expected  development  impact  of  the  proposed  loans.  These \n27. \nperformance  measures  follow  the  multilateral  development  banks\u2019  Evaluation  Cooperation \nGroup's Standards for Evaluation of Private Sector Investment Operations. Development impact \nis  measured  in  three  distinct  categories:  (i)  business  performance  of  the  project  itself,  (ii) \neconomic sustainability, and (iii) private sector development. Examples of development impact \nmeasures are provided below. Appendix 2 shows the full development impact framework. \n\n \n5. \n\nFit to Sector and Country Strategy  \n\n28. \nIn view of the Government\u2019s medium-term targets for 2010, the development of a vibrant \nand  competitive  private  sector  is  vital  to  ensure  economic  diversification  as  well  as  balanced \nand inclusive development. The Government has a particular focus on SME development and \non deepening and developing the financial sector. The ADB program, as set out in the private \nsector  development  section  of  the  country  strategy  and  program  for  Kazakhstan,12 seeks  to \ncomplement the Government\u2019s efforts through increased activities in private sector operations.13 \n \nAs  a  result,  the  ADB  Kazakhstan  country  strategy  and  program  update  2006\u20132008 \n29. \nemphasizes  the  Government\u2019s  policy  on  SME  development  to  create  jobs  and  recommends \nADB assistance through providing credit to SMEs via domestic banks.  \n \nTherefore,  the  proposed  loans  will  directly  contribute  to  implementing  the  country \n30. \nstrategy and program for Kazakhstan by fostering financial intermediation for SMEs. Indirectly, \nthe assistance also supports rural area development, as the selected banks are providing loans \nto SMEs in these areas. The portfolio approach taken (Section III.A.) will ensure sustainability of \nADB\u2019s intervention from a risk and development perspective. \n \n                                                 \n10 World Bank. 2005.

Moreover,  PSOP\u2019s  initiatives  are  part  of  a  wider  effort  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  the \nfinancial sector, as these are accompanied by policy dialogue. The involvement of ADB\u2019s public \nsector  operations  through  the  East  and  Central  Asia  Regional  Department  ensures  the \nnecessary Government discussions enabling both a strong financial sector and reform in SME \nfinance.  \n \n32. \nThe Central and Western Asia Regional Department has undertaken various projects to \nincrease ADB private sector operations in Kazakhstan. For instance, Technical Assistance KAZ: \nUrban Small Business Development14 has the objectives to promote development of the urban \nSME  sector,  review  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  SMEs,  and  foster  financial \nintermediation.  Most  recently,  ADB  has  approved  Technical  Assistance  KAZ:  Republic  of \nKazakhstan  Financial  Sector  Governance  Phase  II,15 which  seeks  to  foster  a  sound,  efficient, \nand broad financial system by strengthening the supervision of banks, accumulation of pension \nfunds, and operations of asset management companies. This assistance will play a central role \nin  supporting  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations  in  the  financial  sector  and  in  strengthening \ndomestic banks.  \n \nB. \n \n33. \nThe proposed loans have been assigned an \u201cFI\u201d environmental classification and a \u201cC\u201d \nwith  respect  to  indigenous  people  and  resettlement.

Gross  domestic  product  (GDP) \ngrowth, led by the oil sector, averaged 9.5% during 2002\u20132004 and 9.4% in 2005. Furthermore, \nrepresenting 65% of GDP, the private sector is increasingly driving growth in the economy.1  \n \n2. \nThe  above  mentioned  factors  helped  lift  2005\u2019s  general  budget  revenues  by  4.7 \npercentage  points  to  28.2%  of  GDP.  This  large  gain  was  somewhat  offset  by  the  increase  in \nbudgetary spending before the December presidential election. The general government budget \nrecorded a surplus of 0.6% of GDP, from a slight deficit of 0.3% in 2004. In view of its strong \nfinancial position, the Government made early repayments totaling $850 million on its external \npublic  debt,  reducing  the  total  to  about  4%  of  GDP  at  end-2005.  The  2006  state  budget  was \napproved in November 2005. It raised revenues by 2% of GDP from the previous year\u2019s level, \nreflecting  government  projections  for  greater  receipts  from  oil.  The  increase  is  earmarked  for \npublic investment and social programs.2 \n \nHigh world commodity prices helped ramp up exports by 40.0% to $28.7 billion, oil and \n3. \nmetals accounted for more than two thirds of the increase. Imports also leaped, by 37%, driven \nlargely by machinery, equipment, and nonprecious metals. The trade surplus improved by about \n45%  to  $9.8  billion,  but  the  deficit  on  the  services,  income,  and  transfers  account  worsened \nsharply.  The  latter  stemmed  from  greater  payments  for  construction,  freight,  insurance,  and \ninformation technology services, as well as a near doubling of income payments to foreign direct \ninvestors, nearly all associated with oil sector development. Consequently, the current account \nsurplus  in  2005  improved  only  marginally  from  a  year  earlier  to  $750  million  (about  1.3%  of \nGDP). For the first time in 5 years, official reserves at the National Bank of Kazakhstan declined, \nthough they recovered substantially in the first 2 months of 2006. (Footnote 2) \n \n4. \nGross  official  reserves  stood  at  $7.1  billion  at  end-2005  (equivalent  to  37  months  of \nimports of goods and services) while end-year foreign asset holdings of the National Fund of the \nRepublic  of  Kazakhstan  (NFRK),  which  saves  a  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  oil  and  mineral \nrevenues  for  future  generations,  amounted  to  $8.0  billion.  During  the  year,  the  total  of  official \nreserves  and  fund  assets  strengthened  by  about  $684  million  (about  1.2%  of  GDP)  to  $15.1 \nbillion. Outstanding public external debt was reduced by about $1.0 billion to $2.4 billion (about \n4.2%  of  GDP)  in  the  9  months  to  end-September  2005.  In  this  period,  private  sector  external \ndebt (excluding oil and gas intracompany debt) increased sharply by $4.6 billion to $16.6 billion \n(about 33% of GDP). The upsurge in private debt in recent years\u2014mainly local bank borrowing \nfor  onlending\u2014was  largely  a  response  to  the  differential  between  available  foreign  borrowing \nrates and domestic lending rates of about 15% for tenge loans and 11% for loans denominated \nin foreign currency. (Footnote 2) \n \nThe  tenge  continued  to appreciate against  the US  dollar  (2.9%)  on  an  average  annual \n5. \nbasis, reflecting export earnings, foreign direct investment (FDI), and private external borrowing. \nHowever, tighter market conditions in the final months of 2005 resulted in a 2.2% depreciation \non an end-of-year basis. As in the previous year, the real effective exchange rate rose by about \n\n                                                 \n1  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development estimate. This is up from 55% of GDP in 1998. \n2  ADB. 2006. Asian Development Bank Outlook 2006: 96\u201397. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n9\n\n6% year on year, due to inflation differentials. Largely because of future substantial oil-related \nrevenues, real appreciation may continue in 2006. (Footnote 2)   \n \n6. \nThe  medium-term  outlook  is  positive,  assuming  buoyant  oil  prices,  foreign  direct \ninvestment inflows, continuation of economic diversification, good macroeconomic management, \nand  political  stability.  In  2006,  GDP  growth  is  expected  to  be  sustained  at  8.5%.  Moreover, \nmacroeconomic  stabilization  should  continue,  with  inflation  estimated  at  about  6.5%  in  2006. \nDespite  recent  substantial  increases  in  wages  and  social  spending,  the  Government  of \nKazakhstan has maintained sustainable fiscal and monetary policies, which have limited budget \ndeficits and inflation. General government debt will continue to decrease in the next few years \nby about 1.0%\u20131.5% of GDP annually. Additionally, with the National Reserve Fund for excess \noil  earnings  and  tax  revenues  expected  to  reach  about  $7.4  billion  by  year-end  2005,  a \nsubstantial fiscal buffer has been created.3 Despite increased external borrowing by commercial \nbanks, the overall external position remains strong. \n \n7. \nA  decomposition  shows  that  overall  growth  in  2000\u20132004  was  led  by  strong \ncontributions  from  capital  and  total  factor  productivity  (TFP).  The  contribution  of  labor \naccumulation  declined  continuously,  suggesting  that  the  economy  is  likely  approaching  full \nemployment. According to government data, the contributions of capital accumulation, TFP, and \nlabor growth to the average GDP rate of expansion of 10.4% in 2000\u20132004 were 6%, 3.2%, and \n1.2%, respectively.4  \n \n8. \nThe hydrocarbons sector has grown at an average of 16% a year since 2000, and will \nremain the locomotive of growth in the medium term. Its share in GDP, including production and \nrelated services, jumped from 11% in 2000 to almost 25% in 2005, and is expected to continue \nrising  as  production  capacity  increases.  Sector  growth  has  been  fueled  by  large  capital \ninvestments; oil and gas have received 60% of total investment, equivalent to 15% of GDP over \nthe 2000\u20132005 period. Two thirds of the oil and gas investment came from the private sector. \nThe share of hydrocarbons in GDP will increase over the medium term as large projects come \non  stream,  though  investment  in  the  sector  is  expected  to  taper  off  as  a  share  of  total  fixed \ninvestment. (Footnote 4) \n \nNon-oil output has risen at an average of 7% a year since 2000 and has been sustained \n9. \nat the rate of 25% of total investment, representing 6.5% of GDP in 2000\u20132005. Within the non-\noil  sector,  construction  and  services  have  been  the  most  dynamic.  Their  combined  share  in \nGDP and total employment has increased to 65% and 60%, respectively. (Footnote 4) \n \n10. \nIn  contrast, the  share  of  manufacturing  and  agriculture  in  GDP  has  declined,  reflecting \nlow capital investment. Their investment rate stood at 3% of GDP a year on average over the \nperiod, with half of that from the public sector. If the investment rate in the non-oil sector keeps \nto its recent trend, non-oil growth could well stay at 7\u20138% a year in the medium term\u2014and even \nhigher  if  the  Government  manages  to  diversify  the  economy  and  stimulate  the  private  sector. \nRemoving impediments to regional trade and accession to the World Trade Organization would \nadvance development of both the non-oil and private sectors. (Footnote 4) \n \n11. \nContinuing  growth,  job  creation  in  the  private  sector,  and  pro-poor  growth  have  raised \nliving standards. In 2004, real per capita incomes rose by 13%.

Unemployment \ndeclined from 8.8% in 2003 to 8.4% in 2004.  \n  \nB. \n \n12. \nKazakhstan  became  an  independent  sovereign  state  in  1991  as  a  result  of  the \ndissolution  of  the  former  Soviet  Union.  Since  then,  Kazakhstan  has  experienced  significant \nchange as it emerged from a single party political system and a centrally controlled command \neconomy  to  a  market-oriented,  democratic  model.  The  transition  was  initially  marked  by \npolitical  uncertainty  and  tension,  a  recessionary  economy  marked  by  high  inflation  and \ninstability of the local currency, and rapid but incomplete changes in the legal environment. \n \nSince 1992, Kazakhstan has actively pursued a program of economic reform designed \n13. \nto establish a free-market economy through privatization of state enterprises and deregulation, \nand it is more advanced in this respect than some other countries of the CIS. However, as with \nany  transition  economy,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  such  reforms  and  other  reforms \ndescribed elsewhere in this proposal will continue or that such reforms will achieve all or any \nof their intended aims. \n \n14. \nKazakhstan depends on neighboring states to access world markets for a number of its \nmajor  exports,  including  oil,  steel,  copper,  ferro-alloys,  iron  ore,  aluminum,  coal,  lead,  zinc, \nand wheat. Kazakhstan is thus dependent upon good relations with its neighbors to ensure its \nability to export. In addition to taking various steps to promote regional economic integration \namong  neighboring  countries,  Kazakhstan  signed  an  agreement  in  September  2003  with \nBelarus, Russia, and Ukraine for creating a single economic zone, which is expected to result \nin  common  economic  policies,  harmonization  of  legislation  implementing  such  policies,  and \nthe creation of a single commission on trade and tariffs. The aim of the single economic zone \nis to create a free customs area within which member countries would enjoy free movement of \ngoods,  services,  capital,  and  labor.  Another  step  toward  integration  is  that  the  member \ncountries  also  intend  to  look  at  ways  to  coordinate  their  fiscal  policies,  credit  and  currency \npolicies,  and  government  policies.  These  efforts  will  support  further  economic  integration \nwithin the CIS, one of the aims of which is to assure continued access to export routes. \n \nC. \n \n15. \nSince  Kazakhstan  is  heavily  dependent  upon  export  trade  and  commodity  prices,  it \nwas particularly affected by the Asian financial crisis in early 1998 and by the Russian crisis \nlater  that  year,  both  of  which  exacerbated  the  problems  associated  with  falling  commodity \nprices.  Because  Kazakhstan\u2019s  economy  is  negatively  affected  by  low  commodity  prices  and \neconomic instability elsewhere in the world, the Government has promoted economic reform, \ninward  foreign  investment,  and  diversification  of  the  economy.  Notwithstanding  these  efforts, \nhowever, low commodity prices and weak demand in its export markets may adversely affect \nKazakhstan\u2019s economy in the future. \n \nThe  Government  began  implementing  market-based  economic  reforms  in  1992, \n16. \nincluding to implement a significant privatization program, promote high levels of foreign direct \n\nMacroeconomic Considerations and Exchange Rate Policies \n\n                                                 \n5  The subsistence minimum is a measure of poverty. Calculated by the State Statistics Agency, it comprises the cost \nof a basket of 70% food items and 30% goods and services. The poverty line is established as a fixed percentage \nof the subsistence minimum, and it is used for determining households\u2019 social assistance allowances and eligibility \nfor such assistance. In 2004, the subsistence minimum was T5,427 or equivalent to $40 a month. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11\n\ninvestment  (particularly  in  the  oil  and  gas  sectors),  and  introduce  an  extensive  legal \nframework.  Despite  uneven  progress  in  this  regard,  Kazakhstan  has  experienced  extensive \neconomic  transformation  over  the  last  12  years.  Since  mid-1994,  the  Government  has \nadhered  to  a  macroeconomic  stabilization  program  aimed  at  curtailing  inflation,  reducing  the \nfiscal  deficit,  and  boosting  international  currency  reserves.  According  to  figures  compiled  by \nKazakhstan\u2019s National Statistical Agency, GDP has continued to grow in real terms following \nthe adoption of a floating exchange rate policy in April 1999. It rose by 13.5% in 2001, 9.8% in \n2002,  9.2%  in  2003,  and  9.4%  in  2004.  However,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  GDP  will \ncontinue to grow, and any decrease in GDP or in the rate of GDP growth in subsequent years \ncould adversely affect Kazakhstan\u2019 development. \n \n17. \nThe  tenge  is  convertible  for  current  account  transactions,  although  it  is  not  a  fully \nconvertible  currency  outside  Kazakhstan.  Between  1991,  when  Kazakhstan  began  its \ntransition to a market-based economy, and April 1999, the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) \nmaintained a managed exchange rate policy, which, although permitting the general trend in \nthe  exchange  rate  to  reflect  market  conditions,  involved  official  intervention  aimed  at  limiting \nin  1998  and  early  1999,  however,  caused \nfluctuations.  Depressed  export  markets \nconsiderable  pressure  on  Kazakhstan\u2019s  managed  exchange  rate  and  resulting  official \nintervention  in  the  foreign  exchange  markets  led  to  losses  on  foreign  currency  reserves.  In \nresponse  to  these  pressures,  the  authorities  instituted  a  number  of  expenditure  cuts,  took \nrevenue increasing measures and, in April 1999, the NBK floated the tenge. The tenge fell by \n64.6% against the US dollar as of 31 December 1999, compared to a depreciation of 10.7% \nas  of  31  December  1998.  Following  the  adoption  of  a  floating  exchange  rate  policy  in  1999, \nthe  tenge  continued  to  depreciate  against  the  US  dollar,  although  at  a  much  slower  rate.  It \ndepreciated  by  4.6%  in  2000,  by  3.8%  in  2001,  and  3.3%  in  2002.  The  tenge  subsequently \nappreciated against the US dollar by 7.3% during 2003 and by 9.9% during 2004. Then during \nthe first 6 months of 2005, it depreciated against the dollar by 4.0%, to T135.26, as of 30 June \n2005.  Since  then  the  tenge  has  gradually  appreciated  against  the  dollar  and  as  of  11  May \n2006, the official T/$ exchange rate reported by the NBK was T122.87. \n \n18.  While  the  NBK  has  stated  that  is  has  no  plans  to  resume  a  managed  exchange  rate \npolicy, there can be no assurance that the NBK\u2019s policy will not change, and any subsequent \ndecision to support the exchange rate could have an adverse impact on Kazakhstan\u2019s public \nfinances and economy. \n \nD. \n \n19. \nIn  September  1995,  the  NBK  introduced  strict  prudential  requirements  for  the \noperations  and  the  capital  adequacy  of  banks.  In  addition,  an  institutional  development  plan \nwas  prepared  for  leading  Kazakhstan  banks.  According  to  the  plan,  banks  are  required  to \nprepare their accounts in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) \nand to apply the Basel Committee norms within the period determined by the NBK on a case-\nto-case basis. These norms apply to both banks. Further, Kazakhstan banks are required to \njoin  a  bank-funded  deposit  insurance  scheme  and  be  audited  annually  by  a  public \naccountancy firm approved by the NBK, which is likely to be one of the leading international \nfirms.  Following  legislative  changes  in  July  2003,  the  Financial  Markets  Supervisory  Agency \n(FMSA)  was  formed,  and,  as  of  1  January  2004,  it  took  responsibility  for  most  of  the \nsupervisory  and  regulatory  functions  in  the  financial  sector,  which  had  previously  been \nperformed  by  the  NBK.  The  FMSA\u2019s  main  task  is  to  regulate  and  supervise  the  financial \nmarkets and financial institutions in Kazakhstan. \n \n\nRegulation of the Banking Industry \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n       Appendix 1 \n\n \n\nImplementation of Further Market-Based Economic Reforms \n\nE. \n \n20. \nThe need for substantial investment in many enterprises has driven the Government\u2019s \nprivatization  program.  The  program  has  excluded  certain  enterprises  deemed  strategically \nsignificant by the Government, although major privatizations in key sectors have taken place, \nsuch as full or partial sales of certain large oil and gas producers, mining companies, and the \nnational  telecommunication  company.  However,  there  remains  a  need  for  substantial \ninvestment  in  many  sectors  of  the  Kazakhstan  economy  and  there  are  areas  in  which \neconomic  performance  in  the  private  sector  is  still  constrained  by  an  inadequate  business \ninfrastructure. Furthermore, the extent of noncash transactions in the economy and the size of \nthe  shadow  economy  adversely  affect  implementation  of  reforms  and  hamper  the  efficient \ncollection of taxes. The Government has stated that it intends to address these problems by \nimproving  bankruptcy  procedures,  the  business  infrastructure,  and  tax  administration  as  well \nas by continuing the privatization process.
