THE PROPOSAL  \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nNepal for the additional financing of the Bagmati River Basin Improvement Project. The report \nalso describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for the Capacity Building of the Bagmati River \nBasin (BRB) Water Management Institutions, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.  \n2.  The Bagmati River Basin Improvement Project (current project) will improve river health \nand flood management in the BRB. The additional financing is required to expand the current \nproject, including (i) consolidation of water management institutions; (ii) expansion of riverbank \nbeautification works; (iii) mobilization of the riverine community; and (iv) the design, building, and \noperation of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The additional financing is also required to \ncover cost overruns associated with the current project,1 the performance of which is on track.2 \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The BRB has important cultural and economic value for the people of Nepal. The water of \nthe Bagmati River is considered holy and is used for cultural and ritual ceremonies practiced at \nthe many significant riverbank temples. The river flows through Kathmandu Valley, which is the \nadministrative and economic center of the country, and Nepal\u2019s gateway for tourism. The river \nprovides most of the city\u2019s drinking water in its upper basin, with hydropower generation in the \nupper and middle basins, and large-scale irrigation in the lower basin. \n4.  The BRB is considered the most water-stressed river basin in Nepal. Kathmandu City\u2019s \nrapid and unplanned expansion has placed tremendous pressure on the upper river system. In \nthe absence of appropriate solid waste and wastewater management, the river has become an \nopen sewer with high fecal contamination, a heavy solid waste load, and physicochemical \npollutants. River pollution is further aggravated in the dry season when 80% of the river flow is \nwithdrawn for drinking purposes. The condition of the riverbanks has been increasingly degraded \nby  solid  waste  dumping,  encroachment,  and  uncoordinated  works  by  various  government \ndepartments. The physical deterioration of the riverine environment has created a public health \nhazard, as well as the loss of cultural and recreational amenities for urban communities. \n5.  The Government of Nepal has long attempted to address the degradation of the BRB. In \nthe 1990s efforts were made to improve river management through creation of the High Powered \nCommittee for Integrated Development of the Bagmati Civilization (HPCIDBC), and by embracing \nthe principles of integrated water resources management.3 The Bagmati Action Plan approved by \nthe government in 2009 formed the basis for Asian Development Bank (ADB) involvement in the \nBRB improvement effort. The current project supported further policy, legal, and institutional \nimprovements by assisting in the development of a new Federal Integrated Water Resources \nPolicy, which was finalized in late 2018 and is being considered for approval by the Cabinet. The \n                                                \n1  Cost overruns resulted primarily from depreciation of special drawing rights vs. the United States dollar, which could \nnot be predicted. \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). Nepal. Bagmati River Basin Improvement Project. The current project is financed \nby an Asian Development Fund (ADF) loan of $25.5 million equivalent (Loan 3057-NEP, which as of 1 January 2017 \nis a concessional loan from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources), an ADF grant of $4.5 million (Grant 0367-NEP), and \nabout $0.5 million in cofinancing from the Multidonor Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership Facility. The \nproject was declared effective in February 2014 and is expected to close by 29 February 2020. \n3  Government of Nepal. 2002. Water Resources Strategy. Kathmandu; and Government of Nepal. 2005.

", "2   \npolicy provides the foundation for a new water act, which is under preparation and is expected to \nbe submitted for approval by Parliament during the first quarter of 2020. Approval of the act will \nenable the long-term establishment of river basin organizations (RBOs), including the Bagmati \nRBO, which was established temporarily through an executive order approved by the cabinet on \n19 January 2017. The BRB is a sub-basin of the Koshi River basin for which an RBO will be \nformed to oversee the entire river basin including the Bagmati RBO. \n6.  ADB support to the Bagmati River basin. ADB approved the current project on 31 \nOctober 2013 to support government and civil society initiatives to improve water management \nand the river environment in the upper BRB (footnote 1). Output 1 of the current project supports \nthe establishment of an RBO with adequate capacity and decision support systems to implement \nintegrated water resources management. Output 2 aims to improve the riverbank\u2019s environment \nin Kathmandu Valley through riverbed oxygenating weirs, riverbank beautification, and community \nmobilization and awareness-raising. Output 3 aims to increase water availability in the river during \nthe dry season through the construction of upstream water storage, pilot groundwater recharge \nschemes, and upstream watershed management. Output 4 provides a flood forecasting and early \nwarning system to reduce flood impacts on riverine communities along the BRB. The current \nproject is complemented by the Kathmandu Valley Wastewater Management Project, which is \nfinancing the design, construction, and management of strategic WWTPs.4 \n7.  Performance  of  the  current  project.  The  performance  of  the  current  project  is \nconsidered satisfactory. The current project was rated on-track for the past 12 months and \nexceeds its contract awards and disbursement projections. The current project is due to close on \n29 February 2020. In terms of physical achievements, output 1 activities were completed in \nDecember 2018; output 2 activities should be completed by December 2019; output 3 activities \nshould be completed by February 2020; and output 4 activities were completed in July 2018.5 \n8.  The need for continued support for Bagmati River preservation. Under the current \nproject, civil society organizations were established and have become active stakeholders in the \nprotection of sections of the upper Bagmati River in the Kathmandu Valley. The organizations \nneed to be further strengthened, and their activities extended to other stretches of the river. \nBeautification  works  have  used  nature-based  solutions,  which  have  renewed  residents\u2019 \nappreciation of the Bagmati River, but these works cover only about half of the urban area. \nExpanding their scope to include other culturally significant river stretches, including restoring \nriverine heritage buildings, would significantly increase the current project\u2019s impact. These historic \nbuildings, which were severely damaged during the 2015 earthquakes, are closely related to the \nriver and have significant cultural importance for Kathmandu\u2019s citizens. River water availability will \nincrease through the completion of upstream water storage under the current project, which will \nallow targeted releases of water during the dry season, but additional work is needed to capture \nand treat contaminated water from the Tukucha tributary to improve water quality for reuse in the \nmain river branch. A flood forecasting and early warning system was developed, but more end-\nuser training activities are needed to enhance communities\u2019 response to flood warnings. The need \nto scale up the current project scope was anticipated,6 and feasibility studies and preparation of \ndetailed designs were undertaken under the current project for this purpose. \n                                                \n4  ADB.

The overall project (i) remains technically feasible and economically viable; (ii) is \naccorded high priority by the government; (iii) is consistent with the project\u2019s development \nobjectives; (iv) is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Nepal, 2013\u20132017;7 and \n(v) is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational priorities on (a) making cities more livable; \n(b) tackling  climate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing \nenvironmental sustainability; and (c) strengthening governance and institutional capacity.8 The \nadditional financing project is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2019\u20132021.9 \n11.  The proposed additional financing will strengthen the current project achievements. It will \nensure continuity in actions by the government and civil society to restore the Bagmati River. \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The project is aligned with the following impact: a clean, green, and healthy Bagmati River \nsystem that is full of life and valued by all.10 The project will have the following outcome: river \nhealth and flood management improved.11 \nC.  Outputs \n13.  The additional financing has four key outputs, the same as the current project. \n14.  Output  1:  Systems  and  capacity  for  integrated  and  participatory  river  basin \nmanagement established. The additional financing will (i) construct and equip a new regional \nbuilding for the Koshi River basin office, (ii) purchase information technology (IT) equipment for \nthe Koshi River basin office and the Bagmati RBO to support river management, and (iii) provide \ncapacity building to the Koshi River basin office and the Bagmati RBO staff through attached \ntransaction TA. \n15.  Output 2: Riverbank environment in urban areas improved. The additional financing \nwill (i) finance cost overruns of the current project\u2019s river environment civil works; (ii) stabilize and \nbeautify an additional 5.75 kilometers of riverbank, including landscaping and restoration of 23 \nhistoric cultural monuments located on the riverbanks; and (iii) mobilize, raise awareness, and \nbuild capacity of local government and communities for riverbank management and maintenance. \n16.  Output 3: Water availability in the basin during dry season increased and watershed \nconservation improved. The additional financing will construct and operate a WWTP to clean \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2013. Country Partnership Strategy: Nepal, 2013\u20132017. Manila. The strategy was extended until 2019.

The document has not yet been approved by the Government of Nepal. The current impact was \nformulated following the previous design and monitoring framework guidelines. The overall impact was updated to \nalign with the current policy: Bagmati River Basin Integrated Development and Management Plan, 2018-2038.\u201d \n11 The original and aggregate targets are in the revised design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n ", "4   \nthe polluted water of the Tukucha tributary, which flows into the Bagmati River. About 17 million \nliters of treated effluent will be released in the river daily and contribute to increased Bagmati \nRiver flow in the dry season. The WWTP will be built on the bank of the Bagmati River at the \nconfluence with the Tukucha tributary. Located in a highly populated area, the WWTP will be \nodorless, and integrated into the riverbank landscape. A sludge digester will be built to produce \nelectric power and reduce the plant\u2019s power and sludge disposal expenses. The additional \nfinancing will also fund the civil works cost overruns and tree planting under the environmental \nmanagement plan for the upstream water storage being constructed under the current project. \n17.  Output 4: Functioning flood forecasting and early warning system for the Bagmati \nRiver basin utilized. The additional financing will provide funds for a civil society organization to \ntrain 18 communities along the Bagmati River downstream of Kathmandu in implementing a \ncommunity-based  flood  early  warning  system.  This  system  was  designed  and  piloted  in \ncommunities under the current project. \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n18.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n24.  The proposed transaction TA will support capacity building of the BRB water management \ninstitutions under project outputs 1 and 4. The TA will focus on capacity building in IT applications \nfor improved river basin management. It will have three outputs: (i) capacity and tools for river \nasset management and water quality data processing by the Bagmati RBO developed; (ii) \ncapacity of the Bagmati RBO and the Koshi River basin office to use a geographic information \nsystem and the decision support system for water management scenarios improvement, and \ndisplay results to the BRB stakeholders, increased; and (iii) flood forecasting and measures \nimproved through routine use and extension of the flood forecasting and early warning system by \nBagmati RBO, Koshi River basin office, and the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology. \nThese outputs will be supported through associated TA because the tasks are specialized and \nrequire specific consultant skills and functional IT systems and networks in the offices. The \ntransaction TA is estimated to cost $620,000, of which $600,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The government will provide counterpart \nstaff, office space, workshop venues, and other in-kind contributions. The Water and Energy \nCommission  Secretariat  (WECS)  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  TA,  which  will  be \nimplemented over 3 years.15 \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n25.

The WWTP will be constructed on the bank of the Bagmati River. An innovative \ndesign was supported by ADB to address several constraints, including (i) limited space for \nconstruction; (ii) a location close to residential areas, a cultural heritage area, and within the \n                                                \n15 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nflooding area of the Bagmati River; (iii) high fluctuations in the quantity and quality of the \nwastewater; and (iv) integration into the urban landscape. To address these, the WWTP will adopt \ncompact treatment technology with covered basins and cover slabs above the flood level. The \nproposed purification technology comprises an activated sludge plant operating according to the \nsequencing batch reactor process. This process has a smaller footprint than other activated \nsludge plants and is well known in the subregion but was not yet adopted in Nepal. Polluted air \nwill be drawn out of the buildings and passed through air filtration and purification facilities to \nremove any harmful emissions and nuisance odors. The construction will be built partially \nunderground and partially above ground, and will consider a 50-year flood return period. The \nbasins will be covered and planted with grass. All plant amenities will be designed following the \nlocal architectural style, and the aesthetics of the site will be enhanced through landscaping. \n26.  ADB value addition also focused on the designs for the riverbank beautification work and \nthe Tukucha WWTP. These designs were produced with the support of an urban architect and \ncultural heritage specialist. They will use local materials (e.g., stones, wood, and traditional bricks) \nfor construction, and incorporate local cultural amenities and architectural features in the design. \nThe design exceeds local standards for flood management to anticipate climate change impacts.16  \n27.  An assessment of the condition and structural design of the damaged cultural heritage \nbuildings was undertaken by cultural heritage architects and structural engineers, and reviewed \nby a cultural heritage specialist working for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \nOrganization. The designs and construction methodology follow national standards for cultural \nheritage restoration. All buildings will be restored, renovated, or rebuilt in accordance with the \noriginal  ancient  design,  with  the  inclusion  of  specific  structural  improvements  to  ensure \nearthquake resilience. \nB.  Economic and Financial \n28.  All  project  outputs  are  nonrevenue  generating.  Therefore,  a  financial  sustainability \nanalysis was completed to consider whether the owners of the assets developed by the project \nadditional financing will be able to support the operation and maintenance costs of  (i) landscaping \nalong the riverbanks of the Bagmati, (ii) restored historic temples and monuments, and (iii) the \nTukucha WWTP. The asset owners can sustainably cover the recurrent costs associated with the \nproject assets, but mitigation measures have been put into place to address the associated risks. \n29.  For  the  economic  analysis,  a  comprehensive  nonmarket  valuation  exercise  was \ncompleted to estimate the economic benefits from the additional financing using a survey-based \nmethod. A sample of households in urban Kathmandu were asked how much they are willing to \npay for improved water quality in the Bagmati River, landscaping along the riverbanks, and \nrestoration  of  historic  temples  and  monuments  along  the  riverbanks.  Survey  results  were \nanalyzed by developing econometric models to estimate the willingness-to-pay of an individual \nhousehold; these results were then scaled up to all households in the urban Kathmandu area. \nThe results showed urban Kathmandu households are willing to pay $15.83 per year for an \nimproved Bagmati River environment. A separate nonmarket valuation exercise estimated the \nwillingness-to-pay of international visitors to the project area; these visitors are willing to pay \n                                                \n16 Increased flood intensity is the main potential risk associated with climate change. To account for this risk, the project \nconsidered a 100-year flood return period for the design of the infrastructure. This is the maximum flood that can be \naccommodated within the available space of the river corridors. Flood return periods considered by the government \nare more typically 25\u201350 years. \n \n ", "8   \n$23.90 for the amenity values provided by the project. The economic analysis only included the \nbenefits to Kathmandu households to focus on the \u201cwithin country\u201d benefits of the project. \n30.  Using the nonmarket valuation estimate of economic benefits and the additional financing \ncosts, the estimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 6.7%; the economic net present \nvalue is $120.1 million. The EIRR is higher than the economic opportunity cost of capital estimated \nat 6.0%, which is the rate used in ADB environment projects.17 This indicates that the additional \nfinancing is economically viable. A 6% social discount rate is used for ADB environment projects, \ninstead of the usual social discount rate of 9%. In addition, for this project, the lower discount rate \nthreshold is justified by the omission of benefits to international visitors\u2014 if included, these would \nraise the EIRR to 18%. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using simulation to estimate the risk \naround the EIRR and economic net present value results. Simulation results showed that the \nEIRR ranged from a minimum 0.0% to a maximum 12.1%, with a probability of about 30% that \nthe EIRR was less than the threshold discount rate of 6.0%. \nC.  Governance \n31.  Financial  management.  A  financial  management  assessment  of  HPCIDBC,  the \nDepartment of Irrigation, and WECS was carried out in accordance with ADB guidelines during \nthe current project preparation, and updated for the additional financing.18 The overall risk \nassessment for the project is moderate. HPCIDBC has experience in implementing the current \nproject and has proven ability to manage funds adequately. The project accounts will be audited \nyearly by the Office of the Auditor General. \n32.  The main risks include (i) lack of a comprehensive internal audit function, (ii) inadequate \nvariance analysis in financial and physical targets, and (iii) turnover of financial management staff \nduring implementation. These risks will be mitigated through the following measures: (i) a financial \nmanagement specialist will be engaged to provide support and capacity building to the project, \n(ii) regular training on ADB\u2019s financial management procedures and requirements will be provided \nto the project\u2019s financial management staff, (iii) the quarterly and annual financial reporting will be \nenhanced, and (iv) the external audit\u2019s terms of reference will be strengthened in examining the \nproject\u2019s internal control framework. \n33.  Procurement. The procurement of goods and works, and recruitment of consultants will \nfollow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). The updated procurement \ncapacity assessment concluded that the overall procurement risk for the project is low. The project \ncoordination and management unit and WECS have experience in procurement in accordance \nwith  ADB  requirements  and  have  demonstrated  their  capacity  under  the  current  project. \nInternational and national procurement specialists are provided by ADB to prepare the design\u2013\nbuild\u2013operate bidding documents and support the evaluation process. Funds were allocated in \nthe project to provide consulting services to assist with contract management. \n34.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and  the Ministry of Urban Development (MOUD). The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 12). \n                                                \n17 ADB. 2017.

The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. A Gender Equality and Social \nInclusion Action Plan was designed for the current project and updated for the additional financing \nbased on implementation performance; currently (i) women hold 16% of civil works contract \nemployment, (ii) women make up 53% and excluded social groups 37% of those involved in \nwatershed conservation groups, and (iii) women account for 66% and excluded social groups for \n33% of those involved in training related to rainwater harvesting. While the primary project \nbeneficiaries are the people living in the BRB, all residents (including the poor and socially \nexcluded) will benefit from (i) improved water security, (ii) conservation of the watershed and \nincreased river flow, (iii) improvements to sanitation and the river environment, (iv) reduced flood \nhazards impacts, (v) improved governance through establishment of a dedicated RBO, and (vi) \ncapacity development of local residents. \n36.  The additional financing will provide women, the poor, and socially excluded with access \nto project benefits. Job reserves will allocate 20% of employment in project construction created \nfor women and 10% for socially excluded people, while 33% of membership in community group \nplatforms created by the project will be reserved for women members, and 20% for poor and \nsocially excluded groups. In addition, the needs of women, children, and the disabled and elderly \nwill inform disaster management responses in all community-based flood adaptation programs. \nThe  current  project  has  prepared  a  stakeholder  communication  strategy  for  community \nawareness and participation to mobilize stakeholders for widespread and meaningful participation. \nE.  Safeguards \n37.  Environment. The additional financing is classified category B for the environment in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The additional financing will have no \nsignificant adverse impacts and will improve the condition of heritage buildings and enhance the \nwater quality of Bagmati River. Environmental impacts associated with air quality and construction \nwaste will be temporary and mitigated with respect to anticipated riverbank works in the urban \narea,  the  proposed  project  design  will  contribute  to  improvement  of  their  environment. \nStakeholders were and will continue to be consulted. ADB will post the final initial environmental \nexamination and environmental monitoring reports on its website.19 \n38.  Social safeguards. The additional financing is classified category B for involuntary \nresettlement  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  Stabilization  and \nlandscaping of riverbanks under the additional financing will cause involuntary resettlement \nimpacts to 18 affected persons, including (i) permanent physical displacement of 17 nontitle \nholders and (ii) temporary physical displacement of 1 nontitle holder (a holy man who will \ntemporarily move during construction and return to live in a shrine). A resettlement plan was \nprepared and will be disclosed on the ADB website.20 \n39.  The project is classified category C for indigenous peoples in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. Project screening confirms that indigenous peoples are not present \nin the project area, and that those living in the river basin area will benefit equally from the project. \n                                                \n19 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "10   \nF.
