The Project \narea  covers \nfour  oblasts  (provinces)\u2014Akmola,  Karaghandy, \nNorth-Kazakhstan  and  South-Kazakhstan\u2014and  includes  about \n500 villages, with populations ranging from 200 to 6,000 persons. \nThe four provinces were selected because they are poor and with \nan identified need for development of WSS systems. The Project \nincludes  four  core  subprojects,  which  were  prepared  using \nparticipatory  approaches.  The  Project  will  provide  basic  WSS \ninfrastructure  services  to  about  530,000  persons,  of  whom \napproximately 40% are living below the poverty line. \n \nto  aging \nInadequate  delivery  of  rural  WSS  services,  due \ninfrastructure,  institutional  constraints,  and  fiscal  difficulties  is \ninhibiting  the  access  of  communities  to  basic  WSS infrastructure \nservices.  Existing \nfacilities  are  often  poorly  designed  and \ninsufficiently  maintained,  and  do  not  adequately  provide  urgently \nneeded  basic  services.  The  capacity  of  the  sector  agencies \nconcerned  must  be  developed  to  enable  them  to  implement \nsubprojects  and  to  undertake  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M) \nof the constructed systems. In line with the Government\u2019s policy to \nuse  a  decentralized  community  management  approach,  the \nProject  will  enhance  the  coverage  of  basic  WSS  facilities; \ncontribute  to  improving  living  and  health  conditions,  in  particular \nfor  the  poor;  and  improve  the  institutional,  organizational,  and \nmanagerial capabilities of the sector agencies. \n \n\n \n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\nObjective and Scope  \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nThe  main  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  the  living  and \nhealth  conditions  of  selected  rural  communities,  in  particular  for \nthe  poor,  by  providing  basic  WSS  infrastructure  services.  The \nProject  consists  of  two  parts:  Part  A:  Physical  Infrastructure,  and \nPart  B:  Institutional  Development.  Part  A  consists  of  about  80 \nsubprojects;  each  covering  one  village  or  a  cluster  of  up  to  15 \nvillages. The subprojects will include developing and rehabilitating \npiped  water  supply  systems,  wastewater  facilities,  school  and \nprivate  latrines,  and  bathhouses.  Part  B  includes  a  capacity-\nbuilding  program,  a  hygiene  and  sanitation  education  program \nand consulting services for project management support. \n \nThe estimated project cost is $65.0 million equivalent, comprising \nforeign  exchange  costs  of  $37.3  million  and  local currency costs \nequivalent to $27.7 million. \n \n\n($ million equivalent) \nPercent \n\nForeign \nExchange \n27.0 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n7.6 \n\nTotal \nCost \n34.6 \n\n53.2 \n\nSource of Fund \n\nA.

The \nloan  will  have  a  term  of  25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5 \nyears, an interest rate to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-Based  Lending  facility,  a  front-end  fee  of  0.5%  and  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum. \n \nA loan of SDR7.0 million (or about $9.5 million) equivalent will be \nprovided  as  parallel  cofinancing  from  the  Islamic  Development \nBank  (IDB).  The  loan  will  have  a  term  of  25  years,  including  a \ngrace  period  of  7  years,  and  a  service  fee  of  2.5% per annum. \nThe  IDB  loan  will  provide  this  parallel  cofinancing  for  the \ndevelopment and rehabilitation of the WSS infrastructure services \nin Karaghandy oblast. \n \nUntil 30 June 2010 \n \n31 December 2009 \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementing Agency  \n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\nv \n\nA  central  project  management  unit  will  be  established  within  the \nWater Resources Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). \nProject  implementation  will  be  carried  out  by  the  oblast  project \nmanagement units to be established in each of the four oblasts  of \nAkmola,  Karaghandy,  North-Kazakhstan,  and  South-Kazakhstan. \nA  project  coordination  commission  will  be  established  to  monitor \nproject  implementation  and  ensure  coordination  with  government \npolicies and other programs. \n \nMinistry of Agriculture \n \nWater Resources Committee \n \nThe procurement of civil works, goods and services to be financed \nby  the  ADB  loan  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  International  competitive  bidding \nprocedures will be applied for supply contracts estimated to cost \nthe equivalent of $500,000 or more. Supply contracts with a value \nless  than  $500,000  equivalent  will  follow  international  shopping \nprocedures, except for supply contracts with a value of less than \n$100,000 equivalent, which may be procured by direct purchase. \nLocal competitive bidding procedures will be applied for civil works \ncontracts that are valued at less than $1.0 million.  \n \nThe  consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  using  quality  and  cost \nbased selection (QCBS)  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to \nADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The Project will \nrequire  639  person-months  of  consulting  services  (51  person-\nmonths of international and 588 person-months of domestic) for (i) \nreview of detailed design, (ii) construction supervision, (iii) finance \nand  accounting,  (iv)  community  development,  and  (v)  project \nmanagement. \n \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  benefit  500  villages  with  populations \nranging  from  200  to  6,000.  Overall,  about  530,000  people,  of \nwhom  approximately  40%  are  living  below  the  poverty  line,  will \nbenefit  directly  from  the  Project  through  the  provision  of  potable \nquality  piped  water  supply \nimproved  wastewater \ndrainage  facilities,  school  and  private  latrines,  and  public  bath \nhouses.  The  Project  will  improve  health  conditions  by  reducing \nwaterborne  diseases.  The  core  subprojects\u2019  average  economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  is  29%.  The  support  for  decentralized \ncommunity  management  and  capacity  building  will  enhance  the \nefficiency  and  sustainability  of  the  rural  WSS  services  in  the \nRepublic of Kazakhstan. \n \n\nfacilities, \n\n\fvi \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\n \n \n\nof \n\nand \n\nagency \n\nresponsibilities \n\nThree  possible  project  risks  have  been  identified.  First,  the \npossibility  of  delays  in  project  implementation  caused  by  lack  of \ninstitutional  capability  to  implement,  operate,  and  maintain  the \nwater  supply  systems  has  been  addressed  through  a  clear \nappropriate \ndelineation \nmechanisms for coordination. Considerable preparatory work has \nalready  been  undertaken  in  the  potential  subproject  communities \nregarding  the  present  status  of  water  supply  facilities,  and  an \ninitial assessment of required development has been carried out. \nSubstantial  support  will  also  be  provided  for  capacity  building \nthrough  training  programs  and  consulting  services.  Second,  the \npotential  for  delays  in  project  implementation  caused  by  lack of \nlocal  counterpart  funds  has  been  addressed  by  the  active \nparticipation of local administration which meet some construction \nsupervision  and  all  land  requirements.  Measures  to  reduce \npossible  delays  have  been  discussed  with  the  Government.  \nThird,  limited  financial  capability  to  cope  with  the  incremental \nO&M of  the  expanded water supply systems has been dealt  with \nby including the institutional development program, which should \nstrengthen  the  capacity  to  undertake  the  O&M  of  the  expanded \nwater  supply  systems.  If  a  subsidy  for  the  O&M  of  completed \nwater system facilities is needed, a commitment from the oblast to \nprovide  a  subsidy  will  be  required  before  a  subproject  can  be \nprocessed.  The  Project \nintensively \nmonitored,  with  at  least  two  field  reviews  every  year,  throughout \nits implementation. \n \nAn  advisory \ninstitutional \nstrengthening  for  rural  WSS  services  is  being  provided  in \nconjunction with the Project. The Executing Agency of the TA will \nalso  be  MOA.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $505,000  equivalent, \ncomprising  $258,000  in  foreign  exchange  cost,  and  $247,000  in \nequivalent  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will  finance  $350,000  on  a \ngrant  basis  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund  funded  by  the \nGovernment  of  Japan.  The  grant  includes  the  entire  foreign \nexchange cost and $92,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. \nThe  Government  will  finance  the  remaining  $155,000  equivalent \nof  local  currency  costs.  The  TA  consultants  will  be  engaged  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \nusing QCBS and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  TA  will  help  the \nGovernment  refine  and  implement  appropriate  management \nsystems  for  rural  WSS  services  for  local  and  village  local \ngovernments and water consumers groups. The TA will focus on \ninstitutional  strengthening \npreparing  and \nprogram  for  the  local  governments,  and  helping  the  consumers \ngroups to improve their organizational structures and capabilities. \n \n\ntechnical  assistance \n\nimplementing  an \n\nis  also  planned \n\nto  be \n\n(TA) \n\nfor \n\n\f \n\nv\n\ni\ni\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Kazakhstan for the Rural Area Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project  to \nbe cofinanced by the Islamic Development Bank. The report also describes proposed technical \nassistance  (TA)  for  Institutional  Strengthening  of  Rural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Services, \nand if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by \nthe Board, will approve the TA. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nKazakhstan is a landlocked country covering an area of approximately 2.7 million square \nkilometers (km2). The population is approximately 14.9 million people, of whom about 40% (6.0 \nmillion) live in rural areas. Since 1990, the population has been declining at a rate of 0.6% per \nannum.  The  country  is  administratively  divided  into  14  oblasts  (provinces). The main cities of \nAstana (the capital) and Almaty also have oblast status. North-Kazakhstan, Akmola, and South-\nKazakhstan oblasts are predominantly rural, while Karaghandy oblast has a higher proportion of \nurban  dwellers.  In  2000  the  populations  of  the  four  oblasts  and  the  proportion  living  in  rural \nareas were: North-Kazakhstan 727,000 (72%); Akmola 837,500 (76%); Karaghandy 1,413,000 \n(22%);  and  South-Kazakhstan  1,974,000  (36%).  The  sharp  decline  in  economic  output  since \nindependence  has  also  contributed  significantly  to  poverty.  According  to  national  poverty \nincidence data, in 2001, the consumption per head of 28.4% of the population was lower than \nthe monthly subsistence minimum of T4,590 (or $30.20). The most deprived regions are South-\nKazakhstan and North-Kazakhstan. Poverty in these areas is compounded by the lack of water \nsupply and sanitation (WSS) services and most acute in rural areas contributing to a decline in \nliving  standards  and  an  increase  in  poverty.  An  analysis  of  the  WSS  sector  is  set  out  in \nAppendix 1. \n \n3. \nThe  Government\u2019s  development  objectives  are  to  promote  economic  growth,  reduce \npoverty,  and  provide  balanced  regional  development  including  improved  WSS  services.  The \ncountry\u2019s WSS facilities are often poorly designed, inadequately maintained and in a poor state \nof repair. Rural water supply has been particularly badly hit by budget cuts since independence \nand  there  has  been  a  low  level  of  investment  in  the  sector  both  by  the  Government  and  from \nexternal assistance sources (Appendix 2). There has been close coordination between ADB and \nother  sources  of  assistance,  which  has  reinforced  and  complemented  their  respective  WSS \nsector aid activities in Kazakhstan. ADB has coordinated closely with other aid agencies during \npreparation  in  identifying  requirements  for  WSS  policy  development  initiatives  and  sector \ninstitutional  arrangements.  The  Islamic  Development  Bank  (IDB)  is  planning  to  cofinance  the \nproposed Project through parallel financing for civil works in one project oblast \u2013 Karaghandy. \nFormerly, an estimated 80% of all rural villages had piped potable water supply. This coverage \nis  now  officially  reported  at  40%,  although,  in  reality,  coverage  may  be  substantially  less  with \nworking  systems  falling  rapidly  to  less  than  35%  coverage.  The  poor  oblasts  of  Akmola, \nKaraghandy,  North-Kazakhstan,  and  South-Kazakhstan  are  particularly  badly  hit,  where  only \nabout  30%  of  villages  have  a  reliable  water  supply.  The  average  amount  of  drinking  water \ndelivered to the population is being reduced by 3-5% a year because of the continued decline in \nthe  condition  of  the  existing  infrastructure.  There  are  no  funds  with  which  to  carry  out  routine \nmaintenance,  and  repairs  are  mostly  performed  on  an  emergency  basis.  As  a  result,  tens  of \nthousands  of  people  every  year  lose  their  piped  water  supply.  The  rate  of  new  construction  is \nalso  very  slow.  The  levels  of  tariffs  are  low,  collection  management  is  poor,  and  insufficient \nmoney is raised to support efficient operation. \n\n\f2 \n\nThe lack of adequate WSS services has also a large negative impact on the community \n4. \nhealth  of  the  country,  especially  the  poor.  In  rural  areas  people  often  have  to  walk  long \ndistances,  only  to  obtain  contaminated  water  from  untreated  sources.  Until  recently,  many \nvillages contained banyas (public bath houses), which have now largely fallen into disuse due to \nlack of water supply. One of the results is an increase in skin diseases caused by lack of proper \ncleanliness.  There  are  few  working  wastewater  collection  systems  in  rural  areas  or  any \nacceptable  level  of  human  waste  disposal.  Insufficient  and  polluted  drinking  water  supplies, \ncombined  with  poor  sanitation  and  hygiene  practices,  are  directly  linked  to  high  incidence  of \nwaterborne diseases. Statistics on morbidity and mortality in the country indicate that while the \nmortality  rate  has  declined  somewhat  because  of  improvements  in  basic  health  services,  the \nmorbidity rate continues to increase. Diarrheal diseases that are strongly associated with unsafe \nwater  supply,  and  poor  sanitation  and  hygiene  are  among  the  leading  causes  of  morbidity. \nLikewise, cases of typhoid have increased due to polluted water sources, resulting in an almost \nfourfold increase since 1997. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n5. \nThe  following  government  agencies  are  involved  in  development  and  operations  of  the \nWSS sector. The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) is the main agency responsible for WSS sector \ndevelopment  and  protection  of  water  sources,  and  its  Water  Resources  Committee  (WRC) is \ndirectly  responsible  for  WSS  development  programs  and  water  resources  management.  The \nMinistry  of  Health  (MOH)  monitors  water  quality  through  its  sanitary  and  epidemiological \nservices  department,  the  Committee  for  Geology  and  Mineral  Resources  is  responsible  for \ncontrolling the exploitation of groundwater sources, and the Committee on Hydrometeorology is \nresponsible  for  monitoring  water  recharge.  The  oblast  governments  assisted  by  the  water \nconsumers groups (WCGs) are responsible for operation and maintenance (O&M) of rural WSS \nfacilities.  \n \nThe  key  problems  in  the  WSS  sector  are:  (i)  declining  water  quality  due  to  increased \n6. \nsalinity;  (ii)  lack  of  spending  on  maintenance  of  ageing  water  supply  systems,  and  of  new \ninvestments  in  water  supply,  particularly  rural;  (iii)  inappropriately  long-distance transmission \nwater  pipelines;  (iv)  lack  of  knowledge  of  new  technologies  for  small-scale modular plants for \ndesalination and other contemporary methods of water treatment; (v) limited acceptance of the \ngroundwater use because of misconceptions about salinity; and (vi) difficulty in recovering O&M \ncosts and costs of capital investments. \n \nThe  Government  follows  the  millennium  development  goal  to  ensure  environmental \n7. \nsustainability and aims to halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to \nsafe  drinking  water,  presently  estimated  at  60%  in  rural  areas  and  30%  in  urban  areas.  The \noverall  goal  of  the  Government's  WSS  sector  policy  is  to  improve  the  health  and  living \nconditions of the population by providing better access to safe and adequate amounts of water \nsupply and better sanitation services. To achieve this goal, several objectives need to be met. \nThese objectives are to (i) assist, initially, in the development of infrastructure systems in those \nregions  in  crisis  or  with  a  depressed  economy;  (ii)  decentralize  water  distribution  systems \ndevelopment  in  rural  areas;  (iii)  undertake  institutional  reforms  necessary  for  the  effective, \nefficient,  and  equitable  development  and  operation  of  WSS;  (iv)  develop  effective \nimplementation mechanisms including cost recovery for WSS in conditions of the market; and \n(v) involve the private sector in management of WSS. The goal for drinking water supply is the \nreliable  provision  to  the  population  of  potable  water,  according  to  the  standards  for  drinking \nwater, in the necessary quantities.  The potable water supply objectives are to (i) provide crisis \nregions and depressed regions with potable water according to a quality standard in minimum \nquantities,  (ii)  develop  new  potable  water  sources  in  regions  with  shortage  of  water,  and  (iii) \n\n\f3 \n\nrehabilitate and develop water supply systems to satisfy the demand. The goal for sanitation is \nto  provide  conditions  that  satisfy  public  health  requirements  and  do  not  contaminate  potable \nwater sources. The sanitation objectives are to (i) increase the reliability of operation of urban \nwastewater  systems  through  rehabilitation  of  existing  networks;  (ii)  develop  domestic  and \nindustrial  wastewater  and,  in  parallel;  (iii)  take  action  for  the  relief  discharge  of  existing \nsewerage ponds serving population and industry, to remove the environmental threat they pose; \n(iv)  ensure  that  pit  latrines  in  rural  areas  are  soundly  designed  and  operated;  and  (v)  develop \nrural  waterborne  sanitation  systems  in  areas  where  there  are  adequate  water  resources  and \nwhere this would be affordable.  \n \n8. \nThe Government's sector policies, strategies, and investment plan have been reviewed \nand agreed upon, and are considered to be  well formulated. The Executing Agency, MOA, has \nsuccessfully  implemented  one  World  Bank-financed  water  project  in  the  past  and  is  presently \nimplementing  another  World  Bank  and  one  Kuwait  Fund-assisted  water  project,  and  has \nadequate capacity and experience to implement the Project. MOA will be further strengthened \nthrough  the  Project's  capacity-building  activities.  Therefore,  a  sector  lending  modality  was \nadopted for the Project, which is also justified by the large number of replicable subprojects.  \n \n9. \nThe  main  institutional  challenges  for  further  WSS  sector  development  are  the \ndevelopment  of  WSS  services  at  the  local  level,  and  sector  services  decentralization.  As \ninfrastructure  investments  have  traditionally  been  planned  and  financed  by  the  Central \nGovernment, remnants of top-down approaches persist at almost all administrative levels, with \nlittle  participation  from  local  communities  and  governments.  The  main  focus  for  institutional \nreform  will  therefore  be  in  community  participation,  private  sector  participation,  and  capacity \nbuilding in local government. Women have an important role as teachers and disseminators of \ninformation  on  better  hygiene  practices  and  proper  use  of  water  supply  facilities.  Women\u2019s \norganizations  will  be  involved  in  leadership  development,  and  in  training  women  for  regular \nparticipation  in  the  local  governments.  To  achieve  this,  capacity  building  and  management \nsupport  should  be  provided  through  a  training  and  support  program  for  the  WRC,  staff  of  the \noblast and rayon (district) governments, the members of the Sanitary Epidemiological Station of \nthe  oblasts  and  rayons,  and  relevant  water  supply  providers,  as  well  as  for  community \nrepresentatives  to  strengthen  their  capacity  to  efficiently  implement,  use,  and  pay  for  the \nsystems.  Capacity  building  is  also  required  for  the  water  service  providers  in  public  utilities \nmanagement  and  operations,  financial  sustainability,  responsive  service  delivery  to  the \ncustomer,  and  effective  investment  in  new  infrastructure  and  rehabilitation  of  the  existing \nsystems. \n \n10. \nThe  Project  would  be  the  first-ADB  assisted  WSS  project  in  Kazakhstan.  However, \nexperience from other externally assisted projects in Kazakhstan and ADB's experience in other \nsimilar  projects  show  that  the  main  problems  faced  during  the  implementation  of  large-scale \nrural WSS services projects relate to insufficient community consultation and participation in the \nplanning  and  design  of  subprojects.  Insufficient  community  involvement  at  these  stages \ncontributes to nonfunctioning or nonestablishment of local utility agencies, lack of guarantees for \nO&M financing, poor cost recovery, and inadequate O&M. The need to focus on sustainability of \noperations  and  increased  sense  of  ownership  has  been  recognized.  Further,  limited \nGovernment experience with project implementation has led to delays and slow disbursement in \nsome  projects.  One  other  lesson  learned  concerns  the  weak  institutional  capacity  of  oblast \ngovernments. It is clear that there is a need for the government officials to become familiar with \nADB's implementation procedures and to provide substantial technical assistance. These issues \nwere studied during project formulation, and comprehensive measures have been appropriately \nincorporated  in  the  project  design.  The  Government,  ADB,  and  other  aid  agencies  are  now \nfocusing on community consultation and decentralizing the implementation process.  \n\n\f4 \n\nADB's  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  has  covered  investment  priorities  and \n11. \npoverty  focus;  the  Government  has  agreed  to  rehabilitate  and  expand  existing  WSS \ninfrastructure in poor rural areas using simple and least cost solutions. It has also covered the \ndevelopment  of  WSS  services  at  the  local  level  and  decentralization  of  implementation.  The \nProject  is  structured  to  increase  local-level responsibilities for WSS infrastructure services by \ndecentralizing implementation and O&M, and actively involving all stakeholders. Policy dialogue \nhas  also  touched  on  local-level  O&M  of  WSS  infrastructure  facilities;  the  communities  will be \ninvolved in the O&M of the constructed facilities through their WCGs. \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nObjective \n\n12. \nThe  main  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  the  living  and  health  conditions  in \nselected  rural  communities,  in  particular  for  the  poor,  through  the  provision  of  basic  WSS \nservices.  The  Project  aims  to  achieve  its  objective  by  (i)  assisting  the  central  and  local \ngovernments  in  delivering  WSS  infrastructure  services;  and  (ii)  improving  the  technical  and \nfinancial capacity of local governments and WCGs in the planning, implementation, and O&M of \nfacilities. The project area will cover the four oblasts of Akmola, Karaghandy, North-Kazakhstan, \nand  South-Kazakhstan,  which  were  selected  because  they  are  poor  and  have  an  identified \ndemand  for  the  development  of  WSS  services.  The  linkage  between  the  goals,  objectives, \noutputs, and inputs are given in the Project Framework (Appendix 3). \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n13. \nThe Project consists of two parts: Part A: Physical Infrastructure; and Part B: Institutional \nDevelopment,  which  includes  a  capacity-building  program,  a  hygiene  and  sanitation  education \n(HSE) program, and consulting services for project management support. \n \n\n1. \n\nPart A: Physical Infrastructure  \n\nPart  A  includes  about  80  subprojects,  covering  500  villages  with  populations  ranging \n14. \nfrom 200 to 6,000. Each subproject will cover one village or a cluster of up to 15 villages. The \nsubprojects  will  include  the  development  and/or  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  piped  water \nsupply  systems,  wastewater  drainage  facilities,  school  and  private  latrines,  and  banyas.  The \ndevelopment  and  expansion  of  the  water  supply  systems  will  include  constructing  and/or \nrehabilitating  water  source  intakes,  pumping  stations,  treatment  facilities,  storage reservoirs, \ntransmission  and  distribution  pipelines,  public  standpipes,  and  individuals  yard  or  house \nconnections. The subprojects will derive supplies from different types of water sources. Most of \nthe subprojects will use groundwater, and will require development and/or rehabilitation of water \nsupply systems and some drilling of deep wells. The new development of water supply will be \ncoordinated  with  wastewater  drainage  measures.  The  school  and  private  latrines  will  be \nconstructed or rehabilitated in the form of ventilated improved pit latrines and with water supply \nand  connected  to  septic  tanks.  The  banyas,  which  have  fallen  into  disuse  mainly  because  of \nlack of water supply, will also be rehabilitated. \n \n15. \nThe WSS component will cover 500 villages of a total of 2,900 villages in the four project \noblasts. About 1,750 villages of the 2,900, or 60%, do not have any formal piped water supply \nsystem;  the  remaining  1,150  villages  or  40%  have  centralized  systems  in  various  states  of \noperation. Of the total 2.5 million rural population in the project oblasts, about 20% or 530,000 \npeople will be covered by the 80 subprojects. Of the 500 villages, 350 villages will be provided \n\n\f5 \n\nwith new systems and 150 villages will have their systems rehabilitated. Of the 80 subprojects \ncovering 1-15 villages, about 60 systems will utilize groundwater sources, and 20 systems will \nutilize surface water. Subprojects will include wastewater drainage measures and rehabilitation \nand construction of school and private latrines and bath houses, as required. On average, the \nper  capita  investment  cost  will  be  $90  for  groundwater  and  $125  for  surface  water.  The  total \ncost  for  the  water  supply,  wastewater  drainage,  school  and  private  latrines,  and  banyas \ncomponent  will  be  about  $55.2  million,  and  the  overall  average  cost  will  be  about  $100  per \ncapita. The improvement of each school latrine will cost about $200, private latrines about $30, \nand  average  cost  for  rehabilitation  of  each  bath  house  is  about  $500.  The  total  cost  for  the \nsanitation program is $1.5 million. \n \n16. \nSettlements  in  the  project  area  are  divided  into  three  major  categories  (i)  settlements \nwhere  group  water  pipelines  (GWPs)  are  no  longer  in  working  order,  (ii)  settlements  with \ninfrequent  water  supply  from  a  GWP,  and  (iii)  settlements  that  have  other  individual  water \nsupply.  The  four  core  subprojects  were  selected  based  on  the  three  major  categories  of \nsettlements  in  the  project  area.  Bulayev  in  North-Kazakhstan  and  Shortandy  in  Akmola  have \nsettlements  where  the  GW Ps  are  functioning  but  the  water  supply  is  infrequent  (category  ii). \nSpasskoe in North-Kazakhstan falls under category (i) where the GWP is not functional, hence \nthe community resorted to other type of water sources like tubewells. Nurinsky in Akmola falls \nunder category (iii) where the villages have individual tubewells. The four core subprojects are \nrepresentative  of  the  other  settlements  in  the  project  area.  In  selecting  the  settlements  for  the \nother subprojects wider criteria will be used, and priority  will initially be given to the settlements \nwhere  GWPs  are  no  longer  in  working  condition  and  the  settlements  with  infrequent  water \nsupply  from  a  GWP.  In  addition,  the  following  criteria  will  also  be  included  in  subproject \nselection  (i)  settlements  with  low-income  level;  (ii)  settlements  that  have  available  water \nresources  to  be  tapped;  (iii)  subprojects  that  meet  the  economic  criteria  set  out  in  the  ADB \nGuidelines on Economic Analysis of Water Supply Projects, in particular the least-cost criteria; \n(iv) sustainability of the O&M of completed water supply facilities; (v) settlements that are willing \nto  establish  WCGs;  and  (vi)  settlements  for  which  the  respective  oblast  government  has \ncommitted  itself  to  subsidizing  the  O&M  cost,  as  required.  Further,  the  subprojects  will  have \nenvironmental clearances from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection \nand will not require any resettlement. The proposed schemes must use appropriate technology \nand represent the least-cost solution.  \n \n17. \nA  structured  approach  will  be  adopted  for  the  appraisal  and  approval  of  subprojects \nunder  Part  A.  Small  subprojects  (with  cost  below  $0.5  million)  would  be  mostly  deep  well \ndevelopment  involving  necessary  water  treatment,  and  rehabilitation  and/or  construction  of \nwater  supply  systems.  Large  subprojects  (with  cost  over  $0.5  million)  would  involve \ndevelopment  and/or  rehabilitation  of  water  supply  systems  in  the  service  area  of  GWPs, \nincluding ground and/or surface water development and wastewater collection  measures. The \njustification of subprojects will be based on (i) the proven economic viability, (ii) the adoption of \naffordable  least-cost  design  solutions,  (iii)  assurance  of  regular  O&M,  and  (iv)  contribution  to \nenvironmental improvements and added health benefits. The WRC will submit and obtain ADB\u2019s \nprior approval for each of the first small subproject proposals from each of the four oblasts and \nalso  for  the  first  large  subproject  proposals  from  each  oblast.  Any  subsequent  subproject  that \ncost more than $2.0 million equivalent financed under the loan will be submitted to ADB for prior \napproval.  The WRC will furnish ADB with an application for the approval of these subprojects, \ncontaining  a  description  and  appraisal  of  the  subproject  proposal.  All  other  subprojects will be \nappraised by the central project management unit (CPMU) within the WRC and approved by the \nproject  coordination  commission  (PCC).  The  WRC  and  oblast  project  management  units \n(OPMUs), assisted by the consultants, will carry out economic and financial analyses of all large \nsubprojects but only simplified financial and economic analysis, including affordability analysis, \n\n\f6 \n\nof  the  small  subprojects.  Only  those  subprojects  found  viable  will  be  endorsed  for \nimplementation. Documentation relating  to  the  subproject  proposals  will  be  retained  by  WRC \nand made available to ADB on request.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPart B: Institutional Development \n\n18. \nCapacity-Building Program. To be carried out by the WRC assisted by the consultants, \nthe  program  involves  preparation  of  training  programs,  and  training  of  central  and  local \ngovernments  staff  and  other  stakeholders  to  strengthen  their  capacity  to  efficiently  plan, \nimplement,  operate,  and  maintain  the  WSS  systems.  The  program  will  provide  four  types  of \ntraining:  (i)  subproject-related  training  for  local  governments  and  training  for  financial  staff  in \nfinancial  management  and  accounting;  (ii)  training  in  O&M  of  new  systems;  (iii)  training  of  the \nWRC,  CPMU,  and  OPMUs  in  financial  management  and  accounting;  and  (iv)  training  for \nimproved water quality testing and environmental issues. The program will focus on four areas \n(i)  training  in  O&M,  emphasizing  reduction  of  unaccounted-for  water;  (ii)  gradual  expansion  of \nthe organizational structure, including assistance to local governments;  (iii) development of the \nlocal governments\u2019 planning, engineering, and financial capability; and (iv) strengthening of the \nongoing  health  education  program.  About  2,000  central  and  local  government  staff  will  be \ntrained under the program.  Under  the capacity-building activities of the Project, WCGs will be \ndeveloped in each subproject area. The WCGs will play a key role working in collaboration with \nthe oblasts and local governments. The WCGs will be composed of representatives of the local \ngovernment  from  the  respective  subproject  area,  male  and  female  representatives  from  the \nrespective  community  of  the  subproject,  and  representatives  from  selected  nongovernment \norganizations  (NGOs)  and  community-based  organizations  (CBOs).  At  least  half  of  the \ncommunity representatives from the settlements and management position of the WCG will be \nfemale.  Community  representatives  will  also  include  representatives  from  poor  households, \ndisabled,  and  elderly.  Through  the  WCGs,  the  local  communities  will  be  responsible  for \nmonitoring of regular water supply, access to water by the poor households, regular payment of \ntariffs, quality of water, and prevention of water waste. They will also be involved in deciding on \nlocations  of  public  standpipes  and  level  of  services.  Currently  WCGs  have  no  formal  legal \nstatus;  therefore  a  TA,  Institutional  Strengthening  for  Rural  WSS  Services,  will  assist  in \ndeveloping  a  legal  framework  to  establish  WCGs  and  advise  on  required  legislation,  including \nstrengthening of the water code. \n \n19. \nHygiene  and  Sanitation  Education  (HSE)  Program.  The  HSE  program  will  help  the \nbeneficiaries  to  improve  their  understanding  of  the  close  interrelationship  between  hygiene, \nwater,  sanitation,  and  health.  The  program  will  be  formulated  by  the  CPMU  and  the  staff  of \nMOH  responsible  for  surveillance  of  drinking  water  quality  as  well  as  sanitation  and  hygiene \nsurveillance,  and  assisted  by  the  consultants.    The  HSE  program  will  include  (i)  selection  of \nHSE  media  materials  for  hygiene,  sanitation,  and  water-related  issues,  and  production  of \ncampaign  and  training  materials  to  complement  existing  virology  school  subject  materials;  (ii) \nHSE  workshops,  orientation  and  training  of  rayon  and  village  health  staff,  village  leaders,  and \nschool teachers in all selected communities;  (iii) equipping selected health posts and schools \nwith  materials  and  software  required  for  training;  and  (iv)  training    teachers  to  deliver  HSE \nmessages to the project communities. About 1,100 staff will be trained, and at least half of the \ntrainees will be female.  \n \n20. \nConsulting  Services  for  Project  Management  Support.  The  consultants  will  help \nimplement  the  Project  and  provide  project  management  support.  They  will  also  support  the \nimplementing  capacity  of  sector  agencies  concerned.  The  services  will  also  (i)  help  in  project \nmanagement  and  monitoring,  (ii)  assist  in  construction  supervision  of  subprojects,  and  (iii) \nsupport  the  planning  and  implementation  of  the  capacity-building  and  HSE  programs.    The \n\n\f7 \n\nWRC will involve at least two CBOs/NGOs (such as women\u2019s committees and elders\u2019 councils) \nto  be  associated  with  the  Project's  consulting  services  for  community  consultation  and \ndevelopment  in  subproject  planning  and  for  monitoring  subprojects.  The  WRC  will  also  use \nCBOs  to  assist  in  capacity  building.  Specific  steps  to  enhance  women\u2019s  participation  in  the \nProject include (i) identifying women\u2019s groups in the community; (ii) training women\u2019s community \ngroups  to  participate  in  project-related  activities,  such  as  health  education  and  gender issues; \n(iii) training women\u2019s organizations, including those representing poorer women, in the decision-\nmaking  process,  including  planning  of  WSS  facilities;  and  (iv)  providing  employment \nopportunities for women in the activities of local governments and WCGs. \n  \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nThe Project supports and strengthens several of ADB's water policy1 principal elements: \n21. \n(i)  promote  a  national  focus  on  water  sector  reform,  (ii)  improve  and  expand  the  delivery  of \nwater  services,  (iii)  foster  the conservation of water and increase system efficiencies, and (iv) \nimprove  governance  by  decentralization  and  capacity-building.  The  Project  incorporates \nappropriate technology taking into account the local conditions and the limited capacity of local \ngovernments.  The  community  consultations  ensure  that  appropriate  technologies  will  be \ninvestigated  and  discussed  prior  to  implementation.  Such  an  approach  helps  ensure  that \ntechnically appropriate and acceptable systems are sustainable. The type of technology  for the \nsystems  will  be  guided  by  the  design  criteria.  When  preparing  the  Project,  the  sanitary \nconditions  in  the  project  area  were  also  reviewed.  The  wastewater  drainage  components \nprovide for the development and rehabilitation of drainage channels.   \n \nThe  private  sector  will  participate  in  providing  the  basic  infrastructure  services.  A  key \n22. \nelement  for  WSS  infrastructure  development  is  to  make  quality  equipment,  materials,  and \ncontracting  services  available  to  involved  institutions.  A  private  support industry for the WSS \nsector  is  evolving  slowly  in  the  country.  The  Government  through  the  Project  will  be \nencouraging the development of (i) a diversified private consulting capacity by encouraging the \ntransformation of present research and design institutes into smaller private organizations; (ii) a \nresponsive and efficient industry to supply quality equipment and materials by accelerating the \nprivatization  of  state  equipment  manufacturers  and  material  suppliers;  (iii)  strong  civil  works \ncontractors  capable  of  providing  quality  services  by  strengthening  of  present  civil  works \ncontractors  in  rural  areas,  adopting  mandatory  competitive  procurement  procedures  for  public \nenterprises such as water utilities, strengthening technical specifications, and introducing stricter \nsupervision of construction; (iv) small-scale entrepreneurs who can offer community services in \nthe construction and O&M of water supply systems; (v) privatized banyas; and (vi) NGOs/CBOs \nthat can contribute to the WSS development. \n \n23. \nSustainable  O&M  of  water  supply  facilities  is  a  major  problem,  especially  in  the  rural \nareas.  An  analysis  of  willingness-to-pay  (WTP)  and  affordability  for  the  four  core  subprojects \nshows that full O&M cost recovery is feasible on commencement for the three subprojects, and \nincluding  depreciation  in  the  next  5-to-10-year period by gradual tariff adjustments. The fourth \nsubproject,  however,  will  need  subsidy  from  the  oblast  government  for  the  O&M  cost.  The \nproject  design  also  incorporates  appropriate  organization  at  the  local  government  level, \nincluding establishment of WCGs, systematic training of staff, preparation of O&M manuals, and \nperiodic  monitoring  of  operations,  including  consumer  satisfaction.  The  capacity-building \nprogram  will  establish  proper  procedures  for  the  collection  of  fees  and  sanctions  for \nnonpayment. The charges will be affordable for all customers. Households with house or yard \nconnections will be charged a higher fee than poorer households served by public standpipes. \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2001. Water for All: The Water Policy of ADB. Manila. \n\n\f8 \n\nThe  socioeconomic  surveys  to  be  undertaken  as  part  of  subproject  design  will  facilitate \nbeneficiary involvement and enable the determination of an appropriate and affordable service \nlevel.  Participation  of  community  representatives  and  other  stakeholders  will  ensure  that the \ncosts of the investment and O&M will be known to the communities. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n24. \nBased on cost estimates of the four representative core subprojects reviewed, the total \nproject  cost  is  estimated  at  $65.0  million  equivalent,  of  which  $37.3  million  is  the  foreign \nexchange  cost  and  $27.7  million  equivalent  is  the  local  currency  cost.  The  cost  estimates \ninclude  interest  and  other  charges  during  construction,  as  well  as  taxes  and  duties.  The \nsubprojects  included  under  the  Project  represent  least-cost solutions. A summary of the cost \nestimates is provided in Table 1, and detailed cost estimates are given in Appendix 4. \n\n \nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n \n\nItem \n\nTotal Cost \n\nPercent \n\n \n\n \n\nSubtotal (A) \n\nPhysical Infrastructure \nWater Supply \n1. \nSanitation \n2. \n \nDetailed Design and Construction  \n3. \nSupervision \n \n \n \n\nA.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nB. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nC. \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE. \n\nInstitutional Development \n1. \n2. \n3. \n \n \n \n \n\nCapacity-Building Program  \nHygiene and Sanitation Education \nConsulting Services for Project  \nManagement Support \na. \nb. \n \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nInterest and Other Charges during Construction \n \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n \n\nInternational Consulting Services \nDomestic Consulting Services  \nSubtotal (B)  \n\n \n\n \n\nForeign \nExchange \n \n33.2 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n \n20.5 \n1.5 \n4.0 \n\n33.2 \n \n \n0.0 \n0.0 \n \n\n1.3 \n0.0 \n1.3 \n \n2.8 \n37.3 \n\n26.0 \n \n \n0.6 \n0.4 \n \n\n0.0 \n0.7 \n1.7 \n \n0.0 \n27.7 \n\n \n53.7 \n1.5 \n4.0 \n\n59.2 \n \n \n0.6 \n0.4 \n \n\n1.3 \n0.7 \n3.0 \n \n2.8 \n65.0 \n\n \n82.5 \n2.3 \n6.1 \n\n90.9 \n \n \n0.9 \n0.6 \n \n\n2.0 \n1.1 \n4.6 \n \n4.5 \n100.0 \n\n25. \nThe  Government  of  the  Republic  of  the  Kazakhstan  has  requested  a  loan  of  $34.6 \nmillion from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a  \n25-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge \nof 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of 0.5%, and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe  draft  Loan  Agreement.    The  Government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reason  for  its \ndecision  to  borrow  under  ADB's  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and \nconditions,  and  (ii)  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. Of the total cost of the Project of \n$65.0  million,  ADB  will  finance  53.2%  of  the  total  estimated  project  cost.  The  ADB  loan  will \ncover  $27.0  million  in  foreign  exchange  cost,  and  $7.6  million  equivalent  of  the  local  currency \ncost.  The  Islamic  Development  Bank  (IDB)  will  provide  parallel  cofinancing  of  SDR7.0 million \nequivalent  to  $9.5  million  (14.6%)  and  the  Government  (including  the  governments  of  the \noblasts) will finance about $20.9 million (32.2%). The ADB loan would finance the cost for civil \n\n\f9 \n\nworks  and  equipment/materials  in  Akmola,  North-Kazakhstan,  and  South-Kazakhstan oblasts. \nIDB is planning to finance the civil works and equipment/materials in Karaghandy. The Central \nGovernment  counterpart  funds  will  be  used  to  finance  taxes  and  duties,  some  civil  works, \ncapacity-building,  HSE,  consulting  services  for  project  management  support,  commitment \ncharges,  front-end  fees  (which  have  to  paid  prior  to  disbursement),  and  interest  during \nconstruction. The proposed financing plan is summarized in Table 2 and details are presented \nin Appendix 4. \n \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \n\nSource \n\nSubtotal (A) \n\nExternal Source \nAsian Development Bank \n1. \nIslamic Development Bank  \n2. \n \n \n \nDomestic Source \n1. \n \n2. \n \n \n\nA. \n \n \n \nB. \n \n \n \n \n \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nNational Government \n \n \nOblasts \n \n \n \n \n\nSubtotal (C)  \nTotal \n \n\nSubtotal (B) \n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \n \n\nForeign \nExchange \n \n27.0 \n6.2 \n33.2 \n \n \n4.1 \n \n0.0 \n37.3 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n \n7.6 \n3.3 \n10.9 \n \n \n11.8 \n \n5.0 \n27.7 \n\nTotal \nCost \n \n34.6 \n9.5 \n44.1 \n \n \n15.9 \n \n5.0 \n65.0 \n\nPercent \n\n \n53.2 \n14.6 \n67.8 \n \n \n24.6 \n \n7.6 \n100.0 \n\n26. \nThe WRC, under MOA (the Executing Agency), will be the Implementing Agency for the \nProject.  A principal function of the Implementing Agency is to be responsible for preparing and \nimplementing  programs  to  develop  and  improve  sustainable  rural  water  supply  systems.  It  is \ndirectly  responsible  for  the  planning,  design,  and  development  and/or  rehabilitation  of  water \nsupply systems under the Project. The WRC has 30 staff members at its headquarters including \n20 engineers and 4 accountants. It also has a strong cadre of technical experts among its 510 \nstaff and offices in all oblasts and rayons. To coordinate the wide range of ministries, agencies, \norganizations  active  and  with  responsibilities  in  the  WSS  sector  and  local  governments,  the \nPCC  will  be  established  to  monitor  project  implementation,  and  ensure  coordination  with \ngovernment  policies  and  programs.  The  PCC  will  be  chaired  by  the  Executing  Agency  and \ncomprise  representatives  of  the  ministries,  offices,  and  agencies,  including  the  Ministry  of \nEconomy and Budget Planning, Ministry of Finance, MOH, and other agencies concerned. The \nPCC will review reports to be provided by the CPMU, and provide guidance and instructions, as \nnecessary, to the CPMU and OPMUs. Based on lessons learned and to ensure sustainability, \ninstitutional \nextensive  consultation  with \narrangements will be needed to ensure and formalize community involvement. Accordingly, the \nProject incorporates an institutional development program for sector agencies concerned. \n \nThe Government will establish the CPMU under the Executing Agency. The CPMU will \n27. \ncarry  out  the  implementation  of  the  Project,  including  procurement  of  goods,  works  and \nservices,  and  the  awarding  of  contracts  in  coordination  with  the  OPMUs  at  the  four  project \noblast  centers.  The  CPMU  will  be  headed  by  a  project  coordinator/design  and  procurement \n\nrequired.  Decentralized \n\nthe  communities \n\nis \n\n\f10 \n\nspecialist and will have staff to be recruited under the consulting services in the fields of project \nimplementation,  engineering,  financial  management,  community  participation,  and  capacity-\nbuilding.  The  OPMUs  will  coordinate  and  manage  all  activities  for  the  implementation  and \nmanagement  of  the  Project,  and  will  report  directly  to  MOA.  The  OPMUs  will  coordinate \npreparation and development of the basic WSS infrastructure under the general direction of the \nCPMU.  Under  the  guidance  of  the  CPMU,  the  OPMUs  will  carry  out  all  aspects  of  project \nimplementation and coordinate closely with the technical departments concerned and agencies \nat the oblast level. The OPMUs will initiate and coordinate key project implementation activities, \nsuch  as  the  community  consultations,  subprojects  selection,  preparation  of  tender  and  bid \ndocuments,  construction  supervision,  monitoring  and  quality  control,  maintenance  of  project \naccounts,  and  clearance  for  environmental  examinations.  Each  OPMU  will  be  supported  by  a \ntechnical  consultant/OPMU  team  coordinator  in  consultation  with  the  oblast  governor.  Each \nOPMU will have a staff member for project implementation to be recruited under the consulting \nservices in the fields of engineering, construction supervision, social development, accounting, \nand  community  development.  The  Government  will  ensure  adequate  technical  staff;  the  skills \nand number of each specialist type will be decided upon in consultation with ADB, as needed by \nthe  OPMUs  to  help  with  development  and/or  rehabilitation  of  piped  water  supply  systems, \nwastewater drainage facilities, private and school latrines, and banyas. \n \n28. \nTo comply with the  needs  and  demands  of  the  community,  a  participatory  approach  is \nadopted  to  formulate  and  design  the  Project.  A  comprehensive  socioeconomic  survey  was \ncarried out during the initial phase of project preparation to determine the real demands of the \npeople in the core subprojects area. The survey respondents expressed a strong commitment to \nparticipate in project design and implementation. CBOs and NGOs in the core subproject areas \nwere  also  consulted  during  project  formulation.  To  achieve  a  high  degree  of  community \ninvolvement  in  the  subproject  design,  implementation,  and  O&M,  the  OPMUs  will  carry  out \ncommunity  participation  activities  and  conduct  socioeconomic  surveys  to  determine  the \nprospective  beneficiaries\u2019  needs,  affordability,  and  WTP  for  the  services.  A particular focus of \nthe participatory programs will be on meeting and prioritizing the needs of the poor. Accordingly, \nin preparing the subprojects, once approved for funding, the OPMUs will work with CBOs and \nNGOs to help mobilize the community and to prepare socioeconomic surveys of the community. \nDetailed  designs  will  have  to  be  prepared  for  each  individual  subproject.  The  details  of  the \nproject implementation arrangements, including a funding scheme for each subproject activity, \nare in Appendix 5. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n29. \nImplementation  is  planned  to  commence  by  the  end  of  2003  with  completion  expected \nby  the  end  of  2009.  The  implementation  schedule  is  outlined  in  Appendix  6.  The  advance \nproject preparation activities, including detailed design carried out for the four core subprojects, \nwill  ensure  that  the  Project  gets  off  to  a  fast  start.  The  Project  is  included  in  the  Central \nGovernment's list of investment projects and budget for 2004. \n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n30. \nThe  supply  of  goods  and  services  in  the  oblasts  financed  under  the  ADB  loan  will  be \nundertaken in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. International competitive \nbidding (ICB) procedures will be applied to supply contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of \n$500,000  or  more.  Supply  contracts  with  a  value  less  then  $500,000  equivalent  will  follow \ninternational  shopping  (IS)  procedures,  except  for  supply  contracts  with  a  value  less  than \n$100,000  equivalent,  which  may  be  procured  by  direct  purchase.  Presently,  each  civil works \ncontract  is  estimated  at  less  than  $1.0  million  equivalent  and  will  follow  the  local  competitive \n\n\f11 \n\nbidding (LCB) procedures. Certain simple and minor civil works may be difficult to undertake by \ncontractors at reasonable cost. Such works may be undertaken by the Borrower using its own \nstaff (force account), provided the works cost less than $100,000 equivalent. In addition, force \naccount  can  be  employed  only  if  the  Borrower  has  adequate  construction  facilities,  including \nequipment, and the capability to undertake works expeditiously and at reasonable costs. A list of \nindicative contract packaging and applicable procurement procedures is in Appendix 7. Efforts \nwill be made to make a contract package as large as possible to attain economies of scale. The \nprocurement  of  goods  and  services  financed  under  the  IDB  loan  will  be  undertaken  in \naccordance with IDB\u2019s procurement guidelines. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nThe  Project  will  require  consulting  services  in  the  fields  of  project  management,  WSS \n31. \nengineering,  environmental  examination,  hydrogeology,  well  drilling,  HSE,  financial  and \naccounting  advice,  and  institutional  development  for  assistance  with  (i)  preparation  of \nsocioeconomic, technical, and environmental surveys; (ii) development of standard water supply \ndesigns; (iii) preparation of contract packages and documents; (iv) supervision and evaluation of \nproject  activities;  (v)  support  to  the  institutional  development  program,  including  training  for \nunaccounted-for  water  loss  reduction;  (vi)  support  to  the  activities  of  the  CPMU  and  OPMUs; \n(vii) training of the accounting staff in preparing loan withdrawal applications and the supporting \ndocuments; and (viii) maintaining accurate and sufficient accounting project records. A total of \n639  person-months  (51  person-months  international  and  588  person-months  domestic)  of \nconsulting services are required. To ensure project quality, the international consultants will be \ninvolved  in  project  management,  financial,  and  institutional  strengthening  activities.  The \ndomestic  consultants\u2019  main  activities  will  be  to  review  technical  studies,  including  detailed \ndesigns,  and  to  supervise  construction.  According  to  standard  government  procedures  for  all \nexternally  financed  projects,  including  World  Bank-assisted  projects,  the  consultants  will  be \nfinanced  by  the  Government.  The  consultants  will  work  with  suitable  CBOs  and  NGOs.  The \nlevel of consulting services has been discussed and agreed upon by ADB and the Government. \nThe  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  MOA  in  accordance  with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants using quality and cost based selection (QCBS), and other arrangements acceptable \nto ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. Appendix 8 contains the required areas of \nexpertise  and  terms  of  reference.  The  recruitment  and  fielding  of  the  consulting  services  for \nproject  management    support  is  a  condition  for  loan  effectiveness.  ADB's  Management  has \napproved  advance  action  for  recruiting  consultants  for  implementation  assistance  and  the \npreparation of detailed design and contract documents. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n32. \nAn imprest account will be established at a bank to be agreed upon by the Government \nand  ADB  to  facilitate  the  timely  release  of  loan  funds.  The  MOF  will  supervise  the  imprest \naccount operations. The amount to be deposited will not exceed $2.0 million equivalent. ADB\u2019s \nstatement of expenditure (SOE) procedure will be used to reimburse eligible expenditures and \nto  liquidate  advances  provided  to  the  imprest  account.  It  will  be  used  to  finance  project \nexpenditures in local currency.  The individual payments that may be reimbursed or liquidated \nunder  the  SOE  procedure  will  not  exceed  $50,000  equivalent.  The  imprest  account  and  SOE \nprocedure  will  be  established  and  maintained  in  accordance  with  The  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook, dated January 2001 and detailed arrangements between the Government and ADB. \nIn  Karaghandy  oblast,  similar  arrangements  will  be  established  in  accordance  with  IDB\u2019s \ndisbursement procedures.   \n \n\n\f12 \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n33. \nThe Government through the CPMU will (i) maintain separate accounts for the Project, \nand  (ii)  have  such  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  audited  annually  by  independent \nauditors acceptable to ADB and in accordance with the provisions of the Loan Agreement and \nas specified in ADB\u2019s Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the Bank.  The \nauditors should have qualifications, experience, and terms of reference acceptable to ADB.  The \nimprest  account  and  SOE  records  will  also  be  audited  as  part  of  the  annual  audit.  The \nGovernment  will  submit  to  ADB  certified  copies  (in  English)  of  such  audited  accounts  and \nfinancial statements, and the related reports of auditors, within 9 months after the close of each \nfinancial year. For the purpose of complying with the requirements for annual audited financial \nstatements, proceeds of this loan may be used to finance expenditure for private sector auditors \nand  translations  of  auditors\u2019  reports  into  English.  The  WRC  will  submit  consolidated quarterly \nprogress  reports  to  ADB  (in  English)  on  all  aspects  of  project  implementation.  The  reports  will \ninclude  details  on  overall  implementation  progress,  problems/issues  encountered  during  the \nreference period, measures taken or proposed to be taken to remedy these problems, and the \nproposed program of activities for the following quarter. Within 3 months of project completion, \nthe WRC will prepare and submit to ADB, in a format acceptable to ADB, a project completion \nreport  on  the  utilization  and  impact  of  the  loan;  performance  of  the  Project;  the  economic  and \nsocial  benefits  generated;  and  details  about  implementation,  costs,  and  other  information \nrequested by ADB. \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nThe  CPMU  will  implement  a  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS)  for  each \n34. \nsubproject to evaluate the delivery of the planned facilities and the subproject benefits accrued. \nA framework and the indicative indicators have been prepared. The CPMU, with the assistance \nof the consultants, will develop comprehensive PPMS procedures and plans in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  handbook  within  6  months  after  loan  effectiveness.  The  PPMS  activities,  including  the \nestablishment of benchmarks, collection of information, monitoring of benefits, and evaluation of \nsocial  impact,  will  be  undertaken  by  the  local  governments.  Data  collection  will  be  carried  out \nprior to physical implementation of the Project, in conjunction with socioeconomic surveys. It will \nthen  continue  on  a  regular  basis  during  implementation,  and  within  3  months  after  physical \ncompletion. The results will be incorporated into the project progress and completion reports. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n35. \nThe Project features an emphasis on decentralized implementation as well as a focus on \ninstitution building, and close monitoring will be required to ensure smooth implementation and \nO&M. Accordingly, a comprehensive review of the implementation arrangements, including the \nrole  of  the  WRC  and  WCGs,  as  well  as  project  start-up experience,  will be undertaken by the \nGovernment  and  ADB  1  year  after  loan  effectiveness.  Comprehensive  reviews  will  be \nundertaken  2  and  4  years  after  loan  effectiveness.  These  reviews  will  focus  on  the  impact  on \npoverty \ninvolvement,  physical \nimplementation,  design  and  technology,  O&M  and  cost  recovery  arrangements,  institutional \naspects  including  training,  health  education,  and  the  role  of  women.  The  reviews  will  also \nassess  the  Project\u2019s  progress  and  achievements  against its objectives, identify any problems \nencountered, and recommend any required remedial measures. \n \n\nimplementation  arrangements,  community \n\nreduction, \n\n\f13 \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n36. \nAdvisory TA for Institutional Strengthening for Rural WSS Services is being provided in \nconjunction  with  the  Project.  The  TA\u2019s  main  objective  is  to  strengthen  sector  institutions  and \ncreate  the  appropriate  management  systems.  The  TA  will  focus  on  (i)  preparing  and \nimplementing  an  institutional  strengthening  program  for  local  governments;  and  (ii)  helping \nvillage  local  governments  and  communities  to  improve  their  organizational  structures  and \ncapacities,  including  strengthening  their  planning,  budgeting,  O&M,  and  in  particular,  financial \nmanagement and billing and collection systems, and examining the legal basis for the creation \nof  WCGs.  The  WRC  within  MOA  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA.  The  main \nbeneficiaries  will  be  clients  who  receive  improved  services  due  to  implementation  of  revised \nmanagement  systems.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  7  months.  It  will  require  9  person-\nmonths of international consulting inputs and 32 person-months of domestic consulting inputs. \nThe  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  using  QCBS  and  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for  the  engagement of \ndomestic  consultants.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $505,000  equivalent,  of  which  $258,000  is \nthe  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $247,000  equivalent  is  the  local  currency  cost.  Of  this  cost, \n$350,000 will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment of Japan. This includes the entire foreign exchange cost and $92,000 equivalent of \nthe local currency cost. The Government will finance the remaining $155,000 equivalent of local \ncurrency costs.  The Government's counterpart funding will be provided in kind. A detailed TA \ndescription is given in Appendix 9. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nProject Benefits and Impacts \n\n37. \nThe Project will benefit about 530,000 people, of which about 40% are considered poor, \nin the four project oblasts through the provision of improved access to safe and reliable water \nsupply and better sanitation facilities. Technical, economic, and financial analyses confirm that \nthe  least-cost  long-term  solutions  involve  development  and/or  rehabilitation  of  water  sources \nand  water  supply  systems,  including  some  rehabilitation  of  the  existing  GWPs.  This  approach \nwill  bring  social  and  economic  benefits,  including  poverty  reduction,  financial  sustainability  at \naffordable  levels  for  project  beneficiaries,  and  positive  environmental  impacts.  Institutional \nsolutions  and  community  participation  in  design  and  implementation  of  the  subprojects  will \nenhance the efficiency and sustainability of the sector program and subprojects.  \n \nB. \n\nInstitutional Strengthening \n\n38. \nThe  WRC  has  successfully  implemented  one  World  Bank-financed water project in the \npast  and  is  presently  implementing  another  World  Bank  and  one  Kuwait  Fund-assisted water \nproject, and has adequate capacity and experience to implement the Project.  However, there is \na  need  for  institutional  strengthening  at  all  government  levels,  including  in  particular \nstrengthening  their  planning  and  financial  management  systems  and  their  community \nparticipation  structures  and  processes.  Institutional  strengthening  is  incorporated  into  the \nProject  directly  through  the  institutional  development  component  of  the  Project  including  a \ncapacity-building  program,  the  HSE,  and  the  consulting  services  for  project  management \nsupport.    In  addition  the  TA  for  Institutional  Strengthening  for  Rural  WSS  Services  will  be \nprocessed  in  conjunction  with  the  Project.  The  TA\u2019s  main  objective  is  to  strengthen  sector \ninstitutions  and  create  the  appropriate  management  systems  prior  to  commencement  of  the \ninstitutional development component of the Project itself. \n \n\n\f14 \n\nC. \n\nSocial Dimensions \n\n39. \nA social analysis following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Incorporation of Social Dimensions and \nHandbook  for  Incorporation  of  Social  Dimensions  in  Projects  was  undertaken  to  evaluate  the \nstatus of infrastructure service delivery and the demands of the people living in the project area. \nDirect  views  of  the  community  were  obtained  regarding  the  infrastructure  service  needs  and \nWTP  fees  for  the  improved  services.  Social  analysis  indicates  that  there is an urgent need to \nprovide access to potable water to the settlements where GWPs are no longer in working order, \nand  water  supply  is  infrequent.  The  results  of  the  social  analysis  are  reflected  in  the  poverty \nreduction  and  social  strategy  as  outlined  in  Appendix  10.  The  social  analysis  in  the  core \nsubprojects  shows  that  the  average  monthly  income  per  person  of  the  families  surveyed  is \nT2,453  (or  $16.7),  being  considerably  below  the  living  minimum  established  officially.  The \nlowest  income  (T2,034  or  $13.8)  is  in  South-Kazakhstan  oblast  and  the  highest  (T2,935  or \n$19.9) in Akmola. In all the four oblasts the average monthly income is almost half the officially \nstated subsistence level. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  is  expected  to  be  positive  in  two  respects:  (i)  the  improved \n40. \nquantities  and  quality  of  water  available  will  lead  to  an  improved  quality  of  life,  and  (ii)  the \nformation  of  WCGs  will  empower  vulnerable  and  disenfranchised  communities.  Through  the \nProject,  poor  women-headed  households,  the  elderly,  and  disabled  people  will  have  equal \naccess  to  potable  water.  Access  to  potable  water  and  increased  sanitation  awareness  among \nthe rural population and children will improve health and sanitation. Improved health conditions \nwill  reduce  the  mortality  rate  and  incidence  of  waterborne  and  skin  diseases.  The  number  of \nhours spent on collecting water will be reduced significantly by the establishment of public water \nstandpipes  by  the  road  in  a  settlement.  This  will  allow  women  to  spend  time  in  productive \nactivities and family welfare. Children will have more time for school work and welfare activities.  \n \n41. \nFurther, the Project\u2019s HSE program stresses the need to adopt proper sanitary practices. \nThis will lead to environmental improvements, added health benefits, and increased productivity, \nresulting in direct economic benefits. A considerable majority of the respondents were positive \nwith  respect  to  the  establishment  of  the  WCGs.  Their  principal  functions  are  seen  as  control \nover the water quality and spending of the funds allocated for servicing and improving the water \nsupply  systems.  Further,  community  participation  in  WCGs  will  increase  accountability  and \ntransparency in the management of the Project. To ensure equitable access to safe and reliable \nwater  supply  to  poor  rural  communities,  monitoring  systems  will  be  developed  both  at  the \ncommunity level and at the project administration level. Socioeconomic surveys in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s guidelines will be undertaken as part of detailed analysis of affordability required for \nsubproject preparation. The WRC and ADB will monitor the socioeconomic implications of the \nProject through all the  processing phases. To assess the project impact, the first year, midterm, \nand  final  evaluations  will  examine  (i)  the  extent  to  which  the  living  conditions  of  the  rural \npopulation and poor have improved; (ii) the extent to which the drudgery of women and children \nhas decreased and its impact in their daily activities; (iii) changes in hygiene behavior; and (iv) \nthe decrease in morbidity and mortality rates of waterborne diseases.  \n \nSpecific  steps  to  enhance  women\u2019s  participation  in  the  Project  include  (i)  identifying \n42. \nwomen\u2019s  groups  in  the  community;  (ii)  training  women\u2019s  community  groups  to  participate  in \nproject-related  activities  such  as  health  education  and  gender  issues;  (iii)  training  women\u2019s \norganizations,  including  those  representing  poorer  women,  in  the  decision-making  process \nincluding planning of WSS facilities; and (iv) providing employment  opportunities for women in \nthe  activities  of  local  governments  and  WCGs.  The  improved  WSS  services  will  save  time \nespecially for women and enable them to engage in productive activities. Sanitation awareness \nwill  give  them  control  over  family  hygiene.  The  women who work in local governments will be \n\n\f15 \n\ninvolved  in  capacity-building  training  under  the  Project  to  equip  them  with  management  and \ntechnical skills in WSS work and to enable them to provide WSS services to poor communities, \nincluding  women-headed  households  and  disabled  people.  Half  of  all  training  activities  will  be \ndirected toward women who occupy relevant staff positions.  \n \n43. \nIn view of the sector lending modality of the Project, specific land requirements have not \nbeen  fully  identified.  However,  based  on  the  core  subprojects,  the  Project  will  require  small \nareas of land for the location of small groundwater pumping stations and, in some cases, small \nstorage tanks. These will be outside the village areas in agricultural land or unused land owned \nby the village governments. The community will contribute land for the facilities as part of their \ncontribution to the Project. This is part of the subproject selection criteria. The Government will \nscreen  each  subproject  before  the  award  of  the  civil  works  contracts  to  ensure  that  the  site \nselection does not cause any involuntary resettlement effects that would require compensation \nand other assistance under ADB's Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. \n \n\nD. \n\nEconomic and Financial Aspects \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Aspects \n\n44. \nThe economic benefits of the Project include direct and indirect health-related benefits, \nrelease of productive time currently spent on collecting water, better education opportunities for \nchildren  who  share  the  primary  responsibility  for  carrying  water  to  the  household,  increased \nwater consumption, and improved water quality. Other major benefits include reduced wastage \nof  water  due  to  distribution  leaks  and  inefficient  O&M  of  water  supply  facilities.  Improved \nsanitation facilities will support a higher standard of public hygiene. The environment will benefit \nfrom a reduced dependence on fuel wood to render water safe for drinking by boiling.  \n \n45. \nInadequate  quality  of  drinking  water  supply  and  sanitation  measures  are the primary \ncauses of rising incidences of water-borne diseases such as hepatitis, diarrhea, acute intestinal \ndiseases, and others. According to a UNDP report, about a quarter of the population is affected \nby  inadequate  quantity  and  quality  of  potable  water.  The  socio-economic survey showed that \n15% of the households purchased drinking water from water trucks, and 25% of the households \nsuffered  some  form  of  gastro-intestinal  infection  over  the  last  year.  Outbreaks  of  small \nepidemics of diseases such as viral hepatitis remain common. Though difficult to quantify, the \nhealth  benefits  generated  by  the  Project  will  be  significant.  The  provision  of  more  reliable  and \nless expensive piped water systems and improved sanitation facilities will help reduce morbidity \nand mortality of the population in the four oblasts, including lower infant morbidity rate in these \nareas,  as  well  as  an  increase  in  the  number  of  working  days  available.  In  addition,  human \nsuffering  and  medical  costs  associated  with  treatment  of  water-related  diseases  will  decline, \nparticularly for the poor who are more exposed to these diseases.  \n \n46. \nThe  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  through  the  release  of  time  for  productive \neconomic activities and education will be particularly significant. The sample surveys in the core \nsubprojects  areas  indicate  that  the  average  household  currently  spends  1-4  hours  per  day \ncollecting  water  from  various  sources,  including  polluted  rivers.  In  winter  when  the  water  is \nfrozen, water is transported or bought from vendors for daily needs. The time saved will become \navailable  to  households  for  other  economic  and  social  activities.  An  economic  rate  of  return \n(EIRR)  analysis  was  undertaken  in  respect  to  the  four  representative  core  subprojects.  Using \ndomestic  price  numeraire,  cost  estimates  were  apportioned  into  traded  and  nontraded \ncomponents and labor, financial costs converted to economic costs so as to reflect costs from \nan  economic  perspective,  and  estimated  labor  costs  adjusted  to  reflect  the  real  market  value. \nFollowing the methodology for quantifiable benefits excluding the health benefits, the EIRRs for \n\n\f16 \n\nthe four core subprojects range from 22.6% in the case of Bulayev subproject to 38.6% in the \ncase  of  Shortandy  subproject.  The  EIRR  for  the  Spasskoe  subproject  is  27.2%  and  for  the \nNurinsky subproject, 31.1%. The wide range of the EIRRs mainly reflects variations in per capita \ninvestment  costs  arising  out  of  population  base  and  the  characteristics  of  the  subproject, \nincluding  the  source  of  water  supply.  The  EIRRs  are  all  well  above  the economic opportunity \ncost  of  capital  of  12%  in  Kazakhstan.  The  EIRRs  were  subjected  to  sensitivity  analysis  and \nremain  acceptable  under  adverse  circumstances,  as  summarized  in  Appendix  11.  Financial \nevaluation and socioeconomic analysis have also been carried out for the four core subprojects. \nOf the four, two each are from Akmola and North-Kazakhstan oblasts and  represent the range \nof various subproject types. The per capita investment costs of the core subprojects vary from \n$90 to $125, averaging about $100. The overall viability of all four core subprojects reviewed is \nsatisfactory in terms of viability, affordability, and type of infrastructure facilities. \n \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Aspects \n\n47. \nThe  water  tariffs  for  the  core  subprojects  were  based  on  the  current  legislation  of  the \nRepublic  of  Kazakhstan  and  the  methodology  of  tariff  calculation  applied  by  the  Agency  for \nRegulation of Natural Monopolies and Protection of Competition of the Republic of Kazakhstan  \n(the agency in charge of the tariff setting). This method also supports affordability to the poor by \nallowing  for  subsidies  to  be  paid  to  maintain  project  sustainability.  The  Project  supports  this \napproach  because  it  is  supporting  the  poor.  The  water  tariffs  will  be  a  flat  rate  per  month  for \npublic  standpipe  users  and  a  fixed  rate  per  cubic  meter  of  water  consumed  for  metered \nconnections.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  was  calculated  with  associated \nsensitivity tests. The FIRR (base case) ranged from 0.7% to 2.3%. The calculations assume an \nannual  subsidy  from  the  Government  equivalent  to  the  annual  depreciation  of  the  capital \ninvestments.  The  FIRRs  are  below  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  computed  at  5.7% \n(considering  the  opportunity  cost  of  Government  investment  as  10%).  However,  as the EIRRs \nare  above  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  considered  at  12%,  the  subprojects  are \njustified on economic considerations. Three of the four core subprojects will cover the full O&M \ncost  from  the  first  year  of  operation  and  generate  annual  revenue  surplus  on  an  incremental \nbasis to meet part of the depreciation cost. The fourth subproject will be able to cover O&M cost \nin  year  17  after  operation.  A  commitment  from  the  oblast  to  subsidize  the  O&M  of  this \nsubproject is needed before it can be implemented. \n\n3. \n\nAffordability Analysis and Project Sustainability \n\n \n48. \nAll water supply subprojects will be community driven from the initial stage of formulation \nand construction. WCGs formed will be participating in O&M of the schemes as self-supporting \nagencies to the extent possible. Due to hardship and considerable time spent in fetching water \nfrom distant places, there is an apparent willingness among the rural population to contribute in \ncash  or  kind  to  part  of  the  subproject  cost  affecting  their  village.  The  tariffs  will  vary  between \n3.3%  and  5.0%  with  an  average  of  about  4.2%  of  the  estimated  average  household  income. \nThese are within the accepted standards of 3-5%. As the poorer households will collect water \nfrom  the  public  standpipes  at  a  lower  rate,  in  their  case  the  cost  will  be  much  less  than \nhouseholds  with  house  connection.  Sustainable  O&M  of  water  supply  facilities  is  a  major \nproblem  especially  in  rural  areas  of  developing  countries.  The  proposed  tariff,  although \naffordable, will not be able to sustain the O&M of constructed facilities as in the case of Nurinsky \nsubproject. The financial analysis for the Nurinsky subproject shows that the proposed tariff will \nonly cover 80-90% of O&M cost in the next 10 years. Subsidies from the oblast government will \nbe needed just to operate and maintain the system. In Shortandy, the subproject revenue will be \nable  to  cover  O&M  and  depreciation.  However,  in  Spasskoe  and  Bulayev,  the  subprojects \n\n\f17 \n\nrevenues can only cover O&M and part of the depreciation. The oblast governments may have \nto  subsidize  capital  investments  to  replace  the  old  ones  in  the  future.  During  the  appraisal \nmission, discussions with the heads of local government of the rayons visited revealed that on \nthe  average  about  80%  of  the  rayon\u2019s  annual  budget  is  subsidized  by  the  national  or  oblast \ngovernments while the remaining 20% comes from local taxes. More than 80% of the budget is \nspent  on  salaries  and  pensions  and  the  balance  is  used  for  capital  investment  and  O&M  of \npublic facilities. Although there is willingness on the part of the rayons to subsidize the O&M of \nconstructed water supply facilities, the rayons may not have the financial capacity to finance the \nO&M. Any subsidy for water supply O&M, therefore, will come from the oblasts who  also gave \nindications  that  they  are  willing  to  subsidize  the  O&M  cost.  To  insure  project  sustainability  for \nthe  succeeding  subprojects,  the  selection  criteria  include  evaluation  of  the  capacity  and \ncommitment  of  the  oblast  to  provide  subsidy  for  subprojects  with  O&M  cost  that  exceeds  the \nsubproject revenues generated. \n \n\nE. \n\nEnvironment Impact \n\nOverall,  the  Project  is  environmentally  beneficial.  An  initial  environmental  examination \n49. \n(IEE)  was  carried  out  for  the  four  core  subprojects  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental \nAssessment  Guidelines  (Appendix  12).  The  IEE  found  that  the  subprojects  component, \ninvolving  simple,  appropriate,  low-cost  technology,  does  not  pose  any  significant  adverse \nenvironmental  consequences.  The  provision  of  safe  drinking  water  and  proper  sanitation \nfacilities  is  expected  to  have  a  significant  positive  impact  on  the  improvement  of  the \nenvironment.  The  subprojects  will  include  the  identification  of  any  special  environmental \nconcerns  that  need  to  be  addressed  during  appraisal,  design,  and  implementation  of  the \nsubprojects,  as  well  as  the  present  environmental  management  measures.  The  Government\u2019s \nenvironment  sector  policies  and  the  capacity  of  the  Government  agencies  involved  are \nadequate.  An  IEE  will  be  prepared  for  each  subproject in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines, \nand a determination will be made as to whether the subproject is environmentally sensitive. If it \nis,  the  IEE  will  be  amplified  to  address  any  significant  environmental  concerns,  and  if  the \nconcerns  are  extensive,  an  environmental  impact  assessment  will  be  prepared  as  for  an  ADB \nenvironmental  category  A  project  and  be  approved  by  ADB.  Environmental  examination  and \nmonitoring  procedures  established  under  an  ADB-financed  regional  TA2  will  be  fully  utilized. \nEnvironmental  concerns,  for  which  appropriate  safeguards  will  be  built  into  the  subproject \ndesigns, include (i) protection of environmentally sensitive areas around the water sources, (ii) \nprovision  for  the  proper  collection  and  disposal  of  wastewater,  (iii)  controlled  extraction  from \ngroundwater  sources,  and  (iv)  safeguarding  the  interests  of  downstream  users  of  surface \nsources.  \n\nF. \n\nOverall Project Risks \n\nThree  possible  project  risks  have  been  identified:  (i)  delay  in  project  implementation \n50. \ncaused  by  lack  of  institutional  capability  to  implement,  operate,  and  maintain  the  water  supply \nsystems; (ii) delay in project implementation caused by lack of local counterpart funds; and (iii) \nlimited  financial  capacity  to  cope  with  the  incremental  O&M  of  the  expanded  water  supply \nsystems.  The  risk  of  delays  in  project  implementation  has  been  addressed  through  a  clear \ndelineation  of  agency  responsibilities  and  appropriate  mechanisms \nfor  coordination. \nConsiderable  preparatory  work  has  already  been  undertaken;  information  has been obtained \nfrom the potential subproject communities regarding the present status of water supply facilities, \nand an initial assessment of required development has been carried out. Substantial support will \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2000.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of  Kazakhstan  for  Strengthening  Environmental  Management. \n\nManila. \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n\nalso  be  provided  for  capacity  building  through  training  programs  and  consulting  services. \nThrough O&M training programs, local water supply system operators will be trained to ensure \ntheir  involvement  in  O&M  of  the  water  supply  systems.  The  possibility  of  delays  in \nimplementation caused by lack of local counterpart funds has been addressed. The villages will \nprovide  some  labor  requirements  and  also  all  land  requirements  in  kind.  Measures  to  reduce \npossible delays have been discussed with the Government. The issue of financial capability has \nbeen dealt with by including the institutional development program, which should strengthen the \ncapacity to cope with the O&M of the expanded water supply systems. If a subsidy for the O&M \nof completed water system facilities is needed, a commitment from the oblast to provide subsidy \nwill  be  required  before  a  subproject  can  be  processed.  The  Project  is  also  planned  to  be \nintensively monitored, with at least two field reviews every year, throughout its implementation. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  MOA  have  given  the \n\n51. \nfollowing assurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nThe Government will ensure and will cause the local governments to increase the \nsupply of water to residents in the relevant subproject area who are living below \nthe poverty levels (as defined by the Government). \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  (a)  all  necessary  government's  environmental \npermits will be obtained promptly; (b) an IEE will be prepared for each subproject \nin  accordance  with  ADB's  Environmental  Guidelines;  (c)  each  subproject  is \nconstructed  and  operated  in  accordance  with  environmental  procedures  and \nguidelines of the Government and ADB; (d) any adverse environmental impacts \narising  from  the  subprojects  are  minimized  by  implementing  the  mitigation \nmeasures  and  monitoring  program  presented  in  the  summary  IEE  of  the  core \nsubprojects, and if concerns are extensive, an environmental impact assessment \nwill be  prepared; and (e) the progress of the environmental monitoring program \nduring  the  construction  and  operation  will  be  reported  to  ADB  as  part  of  the \nproject monitoring and review. \n\nThe Government will ensure that the implementation of the Project, the benefits \nderived  from  the  Project,  and  the  overall  operations  will  be  monitored  and \nevaluated  on  an  annual  basis  by  the  CPMU.  Within  6  months  of  loan \neffectiveness,  the  Government  will  refine  the  PPMS  in  a  manner  satisfactory  to \nADB,  including  the  use  of  relevant  financial  and  technical  monitoring  indicators \nand information. \n\nThe Government will cause the local governments to carry out annual reviews of \nthe  level  and  structure  of  their  water  tariffs,  to  ensure  that  revenues  from  the \nwater tariffs cover O&M costs, and furnish the result thereof to ADB through the \nExecuting Agency, within 3 months of each such reviews.    \n\nThe  Government  will  cause  the  local  governments,  supported  by  the  WCGs \nconcerned,  to  take  appropriate  measures  for  proper  collection  of  outstanding \nwater  bills  and  protect  their  water  resources  and  facilities  through  vigorous \nprosecution for violations such as water meter tampering or water theft. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19 \n\n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\n(ix) \n\n \n(x) \n\n \n(xi) \n\n \n(xii) \n\nThe Government will ensure that (a) relevant CBOs and NGOs will be involved in \nsubproject planning, design, construction, and O&M, as well as actively help with \nthe  capacity  building,  health,  and  hygiene  components  of  the  Project;  (b) \nwomen\u2019s  community  groups  will  participate  in  all  relevant  project-related \ndecision-making activities; and (c) adequate opportunities for the employment of \nwomen  in  WCG-related  activities  under  the  Project  will  be  made  available.  At \nleast half of the members of management positions of WCGs will be women. \n\nThe Government will obtain ADB\u2019s prior approval of the first small subprojects, or \nsubproject costing less than $500,000, from each of the four oblasts, and the first \nlarge subproject, or subproject costing more than $500,000, proposal from each \noblast.  The  Government  will  submit  the  first  10  subprojects  completed  in  each \nparticipating oblast for ADB\u2019s review and comments.  Any subsequent subproject \nthat  costs  more  than  $2.0  million  equivalent  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  prior \napproval. \n\n(viii) \n\nLoan  funds  may  be  used  to  finance  expenditure  for  private  sector  auditors  and \ntranslations  of  auditor\u2019s  reports  into  English,  provided  that  such  auditors  have \nqualifications,  expertise,  and  terms  of  reference  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  are   \nrecruited following processes acceptable to ADB.  \n\nOne  year  after  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government,  together  with  ADB,  will \nconduct  a  review  of  the  implementation  arrangements,  including  the  role  of  the \nWRC  and  WCGs,  as  well  as  project  start-up  experience.  Further,  the \nGovernment will conduct comprehensive reviews on the second and fourth year \nof Project implementation. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  project  activities  are  implemented  in  line \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Incorporation of Social Dimension in Bank Operations. \n\nThe Government will ensure that selection of the settlements and subprojects is \nbased on the criteria established for this Project. \n \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  all  necessary  counterpart  funds  for  project \nimplementation  are  provided  in  a  timely  manner  and,  to  such  end,  the \nGovernment  will  ensure  that  the  local  governments  will  provide  the  counterpart \nfunds and subsidy (for O&M if necessary) in a timely manner during each year of \nproject implementation. The Government will ensure the Project is included in the \nlist of priority investment projects for 2004. \n\n \n(xiii)  Although no involuntary resettlement is envisaged, the Government will, prior to \nthe award of civil works contracts, screen for involuntary resettlement effects, to \nensure that there are no losses of land, income, housing, community facilities, or \nresources  that  would  require  compensation  to  be  paid  and  other  assistance  in \naccordance with ADB's policy on involuntary resettlement.  \n\n \nB. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\n52. \n\nThe effectiveness of the Loan Agreement, will be subject to the following conditions: \n\n\f20 \n\n \nC. \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nThe  Central  Government  will  have  engaged  the  consulting  services  for  Project \nManagement  Support  and  established  a  CPMU  under  the  WRC,  and  the  four \noblast  governments  will  have  established  OPMUs,  one  each  in  Akmola, \nKaraghandy,  North-Kazakhstan,  and  South-Kazakhstan  oblasts.  The  central \nGovernment  and  the  oblast  governments  will  have  provided  adequate  office \nspace  for  the  CPMU  and  OPMUs,  and  identified  adequate  technical  staff  to \nsupport the work of the CPMU and OPMUs. \n\nThe  PCC  will  have  been  established,  and  will  be  comprised  of  senior  officials \nfrom  the  concerned  Government  ministries,  offices,  and  agencies  including \nMinistry of Finance, Ministry of Economy and Budget Planning, WRC, and MOH. \nThe  PCC,  which  is  to  provide  overall  project  coordination,  will  be  maintained \nthroughout the implementation period, with a composition and terms of reference \nsatisfactory to ADB. \n\nThe  Government  will  have  issued  a  regulation  on  project  implementation \nsatisfactory to ADB, clearly specifying the respective roles and responsibilities of \nthe  Ministry  of  Finance,  MOH,  WRC,  local  executive  authorities  concerned,  and \nother relevant agencies in implementation of the Project. \n\nConditions for Loan Disbursement  \n \nThe disbursement of the Loan will be subject to the payment in advance of the front-end \n\n53. \nfee in the amount of 0.5% of the amount of the Loan. \n \n \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n54. \nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of  $34,600,000  to  the  Republic  of \nKazakhstan for the Rural Area Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility; an amortization period of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other \nterms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \nAgreement presented to the Board. \n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTADAO CHINO \nPresident \n\n \n \n \n2 September 2003\n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n21 \n\nA. \n\nGeneral  \n\nSECTOR ANALYSIS \n\n \n\n1. \nThe Republic of Kazakhstan is a landlocked country covering an area of approximately 2.7 \nmillion square kilometers (km2). The population is officially estimated at approximately 14.9 million \npeople,1 of whom about 40% (6.0 million) live in rural areas. Since 1990, the population has been \ndeclining  at  a  rate  of  0.6%  per  annum.  The  country  is  administratively  divided  into  14  oblasts \n(provinces).  The  main  cities  of  Astana  (the  capital)  and  Almaty  also  have  oblast  status.  North-\nKazakhstan,  Akmola,  and  South-Kazakhstan  oblasts  are  predominantly  rural,  while  Karaghandy \noblast has a higher proportion of urban dwellers; however, it has significant rural poverty. In 2000 \nthe populations of the four oblasts and the proportion living in rural areas were North-Kazakhstan \n727,000  (72%);  Akmola  837,500  (76%);  Karaghandy  1,413,000  (22%);  and  South-Kazakhstan \n1,974,000 (36%). \n \n \nFive  difficult  years  of  macroeconomic  disarray  followed Kazakhstan\u2019s separation from the \n2. \nformer  Soviet  Union  in  1991.  Gross  domestic  product  declined  by  about  50%,  then  began \nstabilizing  in  1995.  The  hyperinflation  of  1992-1994  declined  to  about  17%  in  1997  and  to  about \n2%  in  1998.  Gross  domestic  product  growth  recovered  to  about  10%  in  2000.  A  budget  surplus \nwas  achieved  in  2000  for  the  first  time  since  independence,  inflation  subsided,  the  balance  of \npayments situation improved significantly and the short-term economic outlook is positive. Despite \nthe  recent  achievements  and  positive  prospects,  Kazakhstan  faces  major  economic  challenges, \nwhich  have  mixed  implications  for  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  operations.  While  continuing \ngrowth  is  likely  to  increase  the  country\u2019s  need  for  long-term  financing  for  development projects \nsuch  as  from  ADB,  growing  debt  service  obligations  may  constrain  the  Government\u2019s  external \nborrowing capacity.  \n \nB. \n\nPoverty and Health Implications \n\n3. \nMoreover,  the  current  economic  base  for  growth  is  narrow  and has not let to widespread \nimprovements  in  people\u2019s  living  standards.  As  a  result,  poverty  remains  a  serious  problem.  The \nGovernment indicates that about 30% of the population lived below the subsistence minimum 2 in \n2000,  compared  with  25%  in  1993.  The  sharp  rise  in  poverty  was  caused  by  the  persistent \neconomic  difficulties.  The  Government\u2019s  social  expenditures  were  sharply  reduced,  and  the \ndelivery  of  social  services  such  as  water  supply  and  sanitation  (WSS),  education,  and  primary \nhealth care has deteriorated significantly. \n \n4. \nKazakhstan  ranks  73rd  in  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)  Human \nDevelopment  Index  of  year  2000.  Although  poverty  was  not  statistically  defined  in  the  Soviet \nUnion, it has been estimated that, at that time, Kazakhstan was one of the least poor Central Asian \nrepublics.  Presently,  however,  wages  have  fallen  by  about  50%  and  the  former  security  of  job \ntenure  has  been  replaced  by  unemployment,  which  is  especially  high  in  rural  areas.  Poverty in \nrural areas is more acute than in urban areas. The urban areas have about 25% poor population \nas  compared  to  35%  of  poor  population  in  rural  areas.  At  the  time  of  the  Soviet  Union,  WSS \nfacilities were mostly provided to the public free of charge. Recent closure of facilities and declining \nbudget  for  the  WSS  sector  has  resulted  in  service  disruption  and  major  cost  increases  for  these \n\n                                                 \n1  Source: Population Census 1999. \n2 The \u201csubsistence minimum\u201d is defined as insufficient economic resources to meet basic needs. An official \u201cpoverty line\u201d \nis also set by law and equal to 38% of the subsistence minimum. However, the \u201cpoverty line\u201d is used to target social \nassistance, rather than to measure actual poverty. \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nservices. The access of poor households to basic WSS infrastructure services has deteriorated in \nquantity and quality. Health and demographic indicators reinforce the presence of greater levels of \nhuman  deprivation  in  rural  areas.  Diarrheal  diseases,  which  are  strongly  associated  with  unsafe \nWSS and poor hygiene, are among the leading causes of increased water-related morbidity. Given \nthe  fact  that  health  statistics  are  based  on  hospital  in-patient  records  only,  the  prevalence  of \ndiarrheal diseases could be higher than reported. The incidence of waterborne and excreta-related \ndiseases is on the rise. It is, therefore, of utmost importance that provision of basic WSS facilities \nare combined with hygiene education in communities and schools will become important elements \nin improving the community health. \n \nC. \n\n Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Conditions \n\nAs a result of severely reduced operational budgets, WSS systems in Kazakhstan are in a \n5. \nserious state of disrepair, particularly in rural areas, where population coverage is only about 40%. \nThe  conditions  have  worsened  in  the  years  since  independence  and  in  the  period  from  1991  to \n2000,  in  which  the  population  dropped  by  9%  and  industrial  and  agricultural  production  declined, \npotable water supply decreased by 55%. Some rural potable water supplies average only 10 liters \nper capita per day (lpcd).3 The water is also of poor quality, either because the source is of poor \nquality  or  because  of  insufficient  treatment  and  contamination  during  transmission.  Some \ngroundwater and surface water are highly mineralized or polluted, and pose significant health risks. \nMany  people  rely  on  supplementary  supplies  from  private  wells,  handpumps,  and  local  surface \nwater sources irrespective of the quality of the water available. Others have moved because they \nhave little or no water available. Agricultural production in the country\u2019s main grain-producing areas \n(especially Akmola and North-Kazakhstan oblasts) is at risk since farmers are moving due to lack \nof sufficient safe drinking water. \n \n6. \nThe  water  supply  systems  in  the  rural  areas consist of (i) large pipeline systems, called \ngroup  water  pipelines  (GWPs),  which  distribute  water  over  long  distances  and  served  a  large \nnumber  of  communities;  and  (ii)  small,  decentralized  systems  typically  serving  one  or  more \ncommunities. Most systems supply water through public standpipes in the streets. A few systems \nhave yard taps and house connections. Groundwater is the most common water source. Surface \nwater  is  used  if  the  groundwater  is  unsuitable,  especially  for  the  GWPs  in  the  North-Kazakhstan \noblast. Water is also supplied by vendors through kiosks or tanker trucks. Some people depend on \nother supplementary sources, such as private wells, hand pumps, and local surface water sources. \nThe  reasons  for  the  poor  condition  of  rural  water  supply  systems  include  (i)  inefficiency  of \noperation (e.g., high water losses); (ii) high operation and maintenance (O&M) costs, especially for \nthe GWPs; (iii) insufficient resource allocation for maintenance and rehabilitation, due to low tariffs \nand  low  revenue  collection;  and  (iv)  ineffectiveness  of  operating  water  utilities  to  manage  the \nsystems. \n \nThe  GWPs  were  designed  to  supply  large  areas  where  the  local  groundwater  is \n7. \nmineralized. As many as 120 communities may be served by a single system, with communities up \nto  30-40  kilometers  (km)  apart.  Other  GWPs  serve  as  few  as  35  communities.  GWPs  were \ndesigned  for  a  25-year  life  but  are  now  30-40  years  old.  They  are  in  poor  condition  and  largely \nbeyond  repair.  Some  systems  have  ceased  to  function  completely.  This  applies  to  treatment \nfacilities  and  pumping  stations  as  well  as  pipelines,  which  are  of  unlined  steel.  Some  GWPs \noperate only in part, with local distribution systems closed because of their poor condition. Water is \nfrequently  sold  by  vendors  from  water  towers  and  kiosks  erected  over  operational  standposts  or \nmodified valves. Existing decentralized water supply systems are in poor condition also, for similar \n\n                                                 \n3  World Health Organization minimum standard is 25 lpcd. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n23 \n\nreasons. A significant number of these systems supply mineralized and untreated water. \n \n8. \nWith regard to tariffs for water supply, the water supply services organizations are intended \nto  operate  commercially  on  full  cost  recovery  principles,  as  required  by  the  country\u2019s  market \nreforms and the Agency for Regulation of Natural Monopolies and Protection of Competition of the \nRepublic  of  Kazakhstan  (or  the  Anti-Monopolies  Agency,  which  is  in  charge  of  tariff  setting). \nHowever, the agency sets tariffs based on justification provided by the water utilities, which often \nresults  in  tariffs  set  below  cost  recovery  level.  Consequently,  many  water  utilities  have  gone \nbankrupt. In some rural areas where GWPs are no longer working, private vendors are supplying \nwater to the communities at a much higher cost. Monthly payment per family for water supply can \ntherefore  vary  from  T150  ($1.00)  to  T850  ($5.80)  depending  on  whether  the  source  is  a  piped \nsystem or a vendor. Rural populations that cannot afford to buy water are using polluted water from \nwells and open sources. \n \n9. \nThe  appropriate  solution  for  improvement  of  rural  potable  water  supplies  will  be \ndecentralized,  small  systems  through  a  combination  of  development  of  local  ground  and  water \nsources  and  rehabilitation  of  segments  of  the  existing  pipelines,  where  this  is  viable,  or \nconstruction of completely new local networks. The highly dispersed settlement patterns in some \nrural areas make replacement or extensive rehabilitation of the GWPs inappropriate. Furthermore, \nthe management of the new systems should be decentralized to as close to the level of the users \nas possible. \n \n10. \nThere are also few functioning sanitation systems in rural areas. Only a few  rayon (district) \ncenters  have  sewerage  systems,  which  only  collect  wastewater  and  then  dispose  of  it  without \ntreatment.  Their  condition  is  generally  poor,  with  little  maintenance  being  carried  out.  Elsewhere, \nwastewater  is  disposed  of  on  the  ground  around  the  house  or  in  a  septic  tank.  Private  toilets \nusually comprise simple non-sanitary pit latrines in poor condition replaced with a new one when \nfull.  School  latrines  and  other  public  facilities  are  usually  in  poor  condition  as  well,  and \nhandwashing facilities tend to be nonexistent. The cold weather adds to the difficulties of providing \nsatisfactory  sanitation,  especially  where  large  quantities  of  wastewater  have  to  be  disposed.  In \nwinter,  wastewater  is  disposed  of  outside  the  house,  which  then  freezes  and  melts  slowly  in  the \nspring,  creating  pools  of  septic  water  close  to  the  house.  Further,  in  the  past  many  villages  had \nbanyas (public bath houses), which have now mostly fallen into disuse mainly because of lack of \nwater  supply.  Therefore,  an  increase  in  skin  infections  caused  by  lack  of  proper  cleanliness has \nbeen observed.  \n \nD. \n\nInstitutional, Legal and Policy Framework \n\n1. \n\nInstitutional Arrangements \n\nFor  water  resources  and  water  supply  development,  there  are  effectively  three  levels  of \n11. \ngovernance  or  organization.  At  the  upper,  national  government  level,  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture \n(MOA)  together  with  the  Water  Resources  Committee  (WRC)  within  it,  is  responsible  for  water \nresources  management,  policy,  and  allocation.  At  the  intermediate  level,  local  government  is \nindirectly responsible for water supply, but in fact this function is usually assigned to water supply \nproviders, which report to the WRC directly.  The main exceptions are in smaller rural communities \nwhere  there  are  decentralized  systems,  where  water  is  transported,  and  where  the  local \ngovernment takes an active role. At the community level, water consumers groups as such do not \nexist.  However, there are some community based, rather than government organizations that have \nan  involvement  in  water  supply  matters.  They  are  associations  of  apartment  owners  and  the \nhousehold committees.   \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nThe water supply providers have the role of a municipal utility in all cases where there is a \n12. \ncentralized supply system, from small settlements to the towns and cities. This function is assigned \nby  the  local  government,  but  they  report  to  the  WRC.    There  are  other  service  providers  whose \narea  of  operation  extends  to  a  number  of  local  government  areas  and  state-owned enterprises \nresponsible for rural water supplies and maintenance of water supply pipelines within a particular \ngroup  system  area.    All  water  supply  providers\u2019  commercial  operations  and  tariff  setting  are \nregulated by the Anti-Monopolies Agency. \n\nIn  addition,  the  following  organizations  are  directly  concerned  with  water  activities  and \n13. \nresources  management:  (i)  the  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH),  through  its  sanitary-epidemiology \ndepartments,  controls  drinking  water  quality;  (ii)  the  Hydro-meteorology  and  Natural  Resources \nMonitoring  Agency,  whose  responsibilities  include  analysis  of  surface  water  resources  and \nstreams;  and  (iii)  the  Ministry  of  Natural  Resources  and  Environmental  Protection  which  sets \nconcentration  norms  for  sewage  disposal.  The  following  agencies  also  play  a  part  in  the  WSS \nsector: Construction Committee; Ministry of Transport and Communications; Forestry, Fishing and \nHunting  Committee;  and  the  State  Land  Committee.  The  large  number  of  bodies  involved  in  the \nsector  causes  problems  of  interagency  integration  and  inefficiency  and  creates  additional \nconstraints on the protection of water sources from pollution.  \n\n14. \nThe governance of sanitation is treated as being a health and environmental matter, rather \nthan being related to the provision of adequate and safe drinking water supplies, or as a service in \nits own right.  It is therefore controlled and regulated\u2014rather than managed for service provision\u2014  \nby  MOH  for  matters  related  to  public  health  and  prevention  of  water-borne  diseases, and by the \nMinistry of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection, which deals with standards and field \nmonitoring for discharges of effluents to the environment including natural water bodies. There is \nlimited  involvement  of  community-based  organizations (CBOs) and nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs) in the development of the WSS sector. Those CBOs that exist are informal and traditional \norganizations mostly in the south of the country. There are a growing number of NGOs, but they \nare  generally  weak.  None  specifically  cover  the  WSS  sector,  several  deal  with  environmental \nissues, while others promote small-scale economic activities or provide support to health or other \nsocial issues such as of mothers and children. This is probably partly due to  lack of investment in \nthe  sector.  The  present  tax  code  requires  that  NGOs  be  treated  as  any  other  commercial \norganization  and  are  liable  for  income  and  profit  tax  on  their  earnings,  representing  a  significant \nconstraint in their development. \n \n\n2. \n\nLegislation \n\n15. \nThe system of laws and subordinate regulations, standards and codes provide a sufficient \nnormative  base  to  enable  the  preparation  of  a  detailed  inventory  of  water  resources  by  origin, \ndestination,  purposes,  and  technical  conditions  of  usage,  as  follows:  (i)  the  rights  and \nresponsibilities  related  to  provision  of  WSS  services  have  remained  under  the  authority  of  local \nexecutive  agencies  headed  by  the  akims  (head  of  local  governments)  although  responsibility  for \nwater  supply  has  effectively  been  delegated  to  water  service  providers  in  cities,  towns,  and \nsettlements where there are centralized systems; and (ii) the current legislation is sufficient, subject \nto  a  relevant  initiative  by  the  local  agencies  (akims),  for  initiating  structural  changes  in  WSS \nsystems,  including  change  of  ownership,  of  enterprises  involving  natural  monopolies,  and  for \nprivatization with sales or transfer of some communal property to mixed ownership. \n\nThe  legislative  system  demonstrates  that,  since  independence,  Kazakhstan  is  moving \n16. \ntoward the reform of legislation in the area of environment protection. It has ratified more than 20 \ninternational agreements, and more than 30 international treaties are currently in force. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n25 \n\n3. \n\nPolicies \n\n17. \nSince independence in 1991, the Government has pursued a number of policies to improve \nthe  WSS  sector  as  well  as  promote  cost  recovery  and  private  sector  development;  it  has  also \nintroduced measures to improve living standards and reduce poverty. Decentralization plays a key \nrole in the Government\u2019s approach to the restoration of basic services, as reflected in the recently \napproved  Strategic  Plan  of  Development  of  the  Republic  of  Kazakhstan  to  2010.  However,  until \nrecently, Kazakhstan has had no formal program of WSS development. Only since 1999 has the \nWRC  started  developing  regional  sector  projects  and  a  sector  program:  the  National  Drinking \nWater Program. \n \nE. \n\nAssistance to the Sector  \n\n18. \nSince  independence,  public  investment  in  the  sector  has  been  very  limited.  External \nassistance specifically to the WSS sector has also been limited and did not commence until 1997.  \nAssistance  has  been  mainly  for  irrigation  and  soil  salinity  programs  and  capacity  building. \nMultilateral  support  to  the  sector  has  been  from  the  World  Bank  and  European  Bank  of \nReconstruction  and  Development  (EBRD).  The  French  Government  has  provided  funds  for  the \nEBRD-supported WSS project in Almaty. Among the other external aid agencies, Kuwait Fund and \nthe Government of Germany have provided funds for rural WSS development. As part of the Aral \nSea  initiatives,  UNDP  has  supported  a  remote  village  development  project  in  Kyzyl  Orda.  The \nWorld  Bank  is  carrying  out  a  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  a  proposed  WSS  project  in  North-\nEastern Kazakhstan, covering the cities of Karaghandy, Kokshetau, and Temirtau.  \n \n\n1. \n\nADB Lending and Technical Assistance \n\n19. \n  In  2000,  the  Government  requested  TA  from  ADB  to  help  prepare  the  Rural  Area  Water \nSupply and Sanitation Sector Project.4 There has been close coordination between ADB and other \nsources of assistance, which has reinforced and complemented their respective WSS sector aid \nactivities  in  Kazakhstan.  As  a  result,  the  Islamic  Development  Bank  is  planning  to  cofinance  the \nProject  through  parallel  financing  for  the  civil  works  and  equipment  in  one  project  oblast: \nKaraghandy. \n\nF. \n\nReforms Needed \n\n20. \nUnder the National Drinking Water Program, the overall goal of the WSS sector policy is to \nimprove  the  health  and  living  conditions  of  the  population  by  providing  better  access  to  safe  and \nadequate  amounts  of  water  supply  and  better  sanitation  services.  To  achieve  this  goal,  several \nobjectives  need  to  be  met.  These  objectives  are  to  (i)  assist,  initially,  in  the  development  of \ninfrastructure  systems  in  those  regions  in  crisis  or  with  a  depressed  economy;  (ii)  decentralize \nwater  distribution  systems  development  in  rural  areas;  (iii)  undertake  institutional  reforms \nnecessary  for  the  effective,  efficient,  and  equitable  development  and  operation  of  WSS;  (iv) \ndevelop effective implementation mechanisms including cost recovery for WSS in conditions of the \nmarket; and (v) involve the private sector in management of WSS. \n\n21. \n  The  goal  for  drinking  water  supply  is  the  reliable  provision  to  the  population  of  potable \nwater,  according  to  the  standards  for  drinking  water,  in  the  necessary  quantities.    The  potable \nwater supply objectives are to (i) provide crisis regions and depressed regions with potable water \naccording  to  a  quality  standard  in  minimum  quantities,  (ii)  develop  new  potable  water  sources  in \n\n                                                 \n4 ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Kazakhstan for the Rural Water Supply Sector Project. Manila. \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nregions with shortages of water, and (iii) rehabilitate and develop water supply systems to satisfy \nthe demand. The goal for sanitation is to provide conditions that satisfy public health requirements \nand  do  not  contaminate  potable  water  sources.  The  sanitation  objectives  are  to  (i)  increase  the \nreliability of operation of urban  wastewater systems through rehabilitation of existing networks; (ii) \ndevelop domestic and industrial wastewater and, in parallel; (iii) take action for the relief discharge \nof  existing  sewerage  ponds  serving  population  and  industry,  to  remove  the  environmental threat \nthey  pose;  (iv)  ensure  that  pit  latrines  in  rural  areas  are  soundly  designed  and  operated;  and  (v) \ndevelop rural waterborne sanitation systems in areas where there are adequate water resources, \nand where this would be affordable. \n\n22. \n  The main institutional challenges for further WSS sector development are the development \nof  WSS  services  at  the  local  level,  and  sector  services  decentralization.  As  infrastructure \ninvestments have traditionally been planned and financed by the Central Government, remnants of \ntop-down  approaches  persist  at  almost  all  administrative  levels,  with  little  participation  from  local \ncommunities  and  governments.  The  main  focus  for  institutional  reform  will  therefore  be  in \ncommunity participation, private sector participation, and capacity building in local government. To \nachieve this, capacity building and management support should be provided through a training and \nsupport  program  for  (i)  MOA,  the  WRC,  training  of  staff  of  the  oblast  and  rayon  (district) \ngovernments, the members of the Sanitary Epidemiological Station of the oblasts and rayons and \nrelevant water supply providers; and (ii) the communities to strengthen their capacity to efficiently \nimplement, use, and pay for the systems. Capacity building is also required for the water service \nproviders in public utilities management and operations, financial sustainability, responsive service \ndelivery  to  the  customer,  and  effective  investment  in  new  infrastructure  and  rehabilitation  of  the \nexisting systems. \n\n \n\n\fEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE SECTOR \n \n \n\nAgency \n\nProject  \n\nYear \n\nWorld Bank  Water Supply Project in Kyzyl-Orda Oblast \n\n1997 \n\n \nWorld Bank \n\n(province) \n \nTA on Rehabilitation and Management of \nEnvironment of Nura-Isim River Basins \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n7.0 \n\n \nWorld Bank \n\n \nTA on Water Resources Management at \nthe Northeast of Kazakhstan \n\n \nWorld Bank \n\n \n \nEBRD  \nFrance \n\n \nTA for Regulation of the Syrdarya River \nand Northern Part of the Aral Sea \n \n \nAlmaty Water and Sewerage \nProject/Municipality of Almaty  \n\n \nWorld Bank  Water Supply and Sanitation Facilities in \n\n \n\n \nKuwait Fund \n\n \nKfW \n\nAtyrau/Municipality of Atyrau \n \nAral Sea Region Water Supply and \nSanitation Project \n \nRegulation of the Syrdarja River Course \nand Northern Part of Aral Sea \n\n \n\n \n\n \n1999 \n \n \n\n \n1999 \n \n \n\n \n2000 \n\n \n \n2000 \n\n \n2000 \n\n \n2001 \n\n \n2001 \n\n \n0.7 \n\n \n0.5 \n\n \n1.8 \n\n \n \n6.6 \n25.0 \n \n \n16.5 \n\n \n13.6 \n\n \n5.3 \n\nEBRD = European Bank for Reconstruction and Development; KfW = Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Weideraufbau of the \nGovernment of Germany; TA = technical assistance. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n \nDesign Summary \n\nGoal \nImprove living and health \nconditions of the rural \ncommunities \n\nPurpose  \nProvide safe, easily \naccessible, and sustainable \nwater supply, and improved \nwastewater drainage \nfacilities, school latrines, and \nbathhouses to selected rural \ncommunities in four oblasts \n(provinces). \n\nOutputs \n \nA.

These budgets will be reviewed and updated every 6 months. All budgets will \nbe reviewed and approved by the WRC before implementation. Expenditures will be recorded at \nsource  by  the  OPMUs  and  the  CPMU.  The  CPMU  will  approve  and  supervise  all  draw-down \narrangements.  The  CPMU  will  be  responsible  for  compiling  project  expenditures  based  on  its \nown expenditures and the reports of expenditures submitted by the OPMUs. It will report project \nexpenditures to the WRC and the PCC, with copies to ADB, on a monthly basis with quarterly \nand annual summaries. \n \n6. \nFor  the  rehabilitation  and  development  of  infrastructure  facilities,  the  OPMUs  will  work \nwith local governments, as well as the rayon (district) and oblast administrations and WCGs and \nother  stakeholders  where  appropriate.  The  OPMU  will  carry  out  a  rapid  assessment  of  the \nsubproject.  The  CPMU  will  provide  the  selection  criteria  and  the  OPMU  will  present  the \napplications,  with  their  own  assessment,  to  the  CPMU  for  their  evaluation.  In  preparing  the \nsubprojects, once approved for funding, the OPMU will identify and support NGOs/CBOs to help \nmobilize  the  community  and  prepare  socioeconomic  surveys  of  the  community.  This  will  form \nthe  basis  of  an  assessment  of  their  ability  to  pay  for  the  improvements.  The  OPMU  will  also \nappoint  design  engineers  to  consult  with  the  community  and  prepare  financially  feasible \nprojects. Each large subproject (costing over $0.5 million) will require a simple business plan to \ndemonstrate  how  the  subproject  will  be  managed  once  complete,  including  the  institutional \narrangements and staff levels. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nPROJECT IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE \n \n\nActivity\n\nYear 1\n\nYear 2\n\nYear 3 Year 4 Year 5\n\nYear 6\n\nA.

At the same time the Government has recognized the need to set \ntariffs  for  utilities  and  services  at  a  level  that  will  ensure  the  services  can  be  sustained.  The \nProject is based on the principle of cost recovery for operation and maintenance and, in the long \nterm, also for depreciation by the end users. It is therefore necessary that the stakeholders have \ngreater  control  over  the  standard  and  quality  of  services  provided.  The  participation  by  all \nstakeholders  is  a  fundamental  strategy  to  achieve  this,  as  is  the  need  to  create  choice  in  the \nmarket.  \n \nThe  main  purpose  of  the  technical  assistance  (TA)    is  to  develop  good  practices  and \n2. \ncreate the appropriate management systems for the smooth implementation of these strategies. \nIn the course of the TA good practices will be developed taking those core subproject sites that \nhave been studied under the project preparation TA (PPTA) 1 as examples. It will also develop \nsystems  for  involving  the  community,  including  strengthening  the  role  of  women  in  identifying \nneeds  for  basic  infrastructure  services  and  planning  the  level  of  services  to  be  provided,  and \npropose a model for the participation of the proposed water consumers groups (WCGs). It will \nalso  introduce  the  concepts  of  establishing  appropriate  design  standards  to  oblast  (province) \nand village governments and give advice on tariff setting and revenue collection.  The services \nprovided under the TA will encompass:  (i) international and domestic consulting services,  (ii) \ntraining  of  central  project  management  unit  (CPMU)  and  oblast  project  management  unit \n(OPMU) staff, and  (iii) training of relevant  rayon (district) and local village government leaders \nand staff. \n \nB. \n\nCost Estimates \n\nThe cost of the TA is estimated at $505,000 equivalent, of which $258,000 is the foreign \n3. \nexchange cost and $247,000 equivalent the local currency cost. Of this, $350,000 equivalent is \nproposed  to  be  financed  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  on  a  grant  basis,  which \ncomprises the entire foreign exchange cost and $92,000 equivalent of local currency cost. The \nGovernment  will  finance  the  remaining  $155,000  equivalent  of  local  currency  costs.

Yes \n\n \n\n \nSector identified as a national priority in country poverty \npartnership agreement?  Yes \n\nContribution of the water supply and sanitation sector to reduce poverty in Kazakhstan: \n \n1. \nThe  water  supply  and  sanitation  sector  in  Kazakhstan  is  in  a  serious  condition  since  independence.  The \nprincipal reason for this is the almost complete collapse of the former water supply systems. During the period 1991 to \n1999, potable water supply has decreased by about 55%. A large number of water supply lines are defunct. Drinking \nwater supply for the rural population is a more serious problem than for the urban. Currently, there is water supply and \nsanitation coverage of about 40% of the rural population. Most rural water systems comprise of long-distance pipelines \ndrawing  on  surface  or  ground  water  sources.  The  pipelines  have  exceeded  their  useful  lives.  Due  to  lack  of \nmaintenance, the pipelines are unserviceable and seriously deteriorated in many locations.  In many rural areas water \nsupply is presently unavailable. In some areas, people have access to water intermittently.  From some rural areas, \npeople have moved because they have little or no water. Agriculture production in the country\u2019s main grain producing \nareas is at risk. \n \n2. \nThe worst situation with regards to water supply, according to results of the survey is in the South- and North-\nKazakhstan oblasts (provinces). Some surveyed rayons (districts ) of Karaghandy oblast are in a better position in this \nrespect. Focus groups identified a dramatic deterioration in water supply over the last 5 years. In the oblasts surveyed \nthe sources of water are available at night for only a proportion of households : 55.0% in South-Kazakhstan, 40.5% in \nAkmola, 37.1% in North-Kazakhstan, and 26.8% in Karaghandy. \n \n3. \nThe  lack  of  adequate  water  of  an  appropriate  quality  adversely  affects  the  lives  of  much  of  the  rural \npopulation.    This  is  exacerbated  by  the  fact  that  these  communities  previously  had  access  to  water.  Communities \nidentify problems related to water supply and health systems as the highest priority. Water supply problems exist in all \nthe surveyed regions, but it is particularly critical in South- and North-Kazakhstan oblasts and in the Shortandy rayon \nof Akmola oblast. Water pipelines are worn out and in many villages they do not work. The water in the wells, the most \ncommon  sources  of  water,  in  North-Kazakhstan  is  of  poor  quality  and  is  salty.  The  villagers  in  South-  and  North-\nKazakhstan oblasts have to use  brought-in water most frequently. About 5% of the respondents have to use the water \nfrom the pits and irrigation canals, and to collect rainwater. In some villages the water systems have been transferred \nto private owners, especially in North-Kazakhstan.  \n \n4. \nRecently, in some rural areas where pipeline are no longer working, private vendors are transporting water to \nthe  communities.  The  cost  of  water  from  the  vendors  varies  according  to  the  distance  of  water  source.  Monthly \npayment per family varies from T150 to T850. A poor family spent T150 to T300 to purchase water.  Findings of the \nfocus group discussions indicate that monthly income of the poor family\u2019s ranges from T2,000 to T5,000.  Given the \nincome  of  the  poor  family,  cost  of  water  from  vendor  becomes  a  significant  burden  for  poor  households.    In  North-\nKazakhstan, people melt snow in winter to meet household water needs. Women are responsible for melting snow by \nburning  coal.  Women  reported  that  burning  coal  every  day  for  long  hours  has  increased  respiratory  disease  in  the \nfamily.  \n \n5. \nSince the access to potable water supply has decreased significantly, the living condition of poor pensioners \nand single women-headed households are most seriously affected.  Half of the pensioners are women. In villages \nwhere group water pipes are no longer working, a family spends significant amounts of time fetching water. Since the \npipeline  became  dysfunctional  and  water  has  to  be  collected  from  long  distance,  women,  men,  and  children  are \ninvolved  in  fetching  water.    However,  women  and  children  are  mainly  responsible  for  collecting  water  for  household \nneeds. The amount of time spent by children for collecting water limits the time available for education and recreation. \nWomen\u2019s  responsibility  for  family  care  and  household  work  is  affected  by  lack  of  availability  of  water  and  it  has \nseriously complicated the already difficult circumstances of many women, especially poor women and single mother. \nIn  caring  for  the  family,  women  bear  the  brunt  of  inadequate  and  poor  quality  of  water.  In  health  terms,  pregnant \nwomen, nursing mothers, and young children are at greatest disadvantage.  \n \n6. \nVery few rural settlements have water-borne sewerage networks and none of those have sewerage treatment \nfacilities. The majority of families surveyed use pit latrines.  In villages where water pipes are no longer working, basic \nwater  supply  has  a  higher  priority  than  improved  sanitation  measures.  Field  observations  suggest  that  rural \npopulations  have  low  levels  of  awareness  on  sanitation.  Rural  sanitation  needs  to  be  improved  to  avoid  pollution  of \nwater supply systems. \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n47 \n\nThe health status was often related to the quality of the water supply. Survey indicates where the people use \n7. \nthe  brought-in  water,  water  from  the  wells,  pits  and  irrigation  canals,  the  incidence  of  diseases,  especially  those \nrelated  to  the  intestines,  were  higher  than  in  the  villages  with  the  pipeline  water  supplies.  Most  bath  houses  in  the \nsettlements need rehabilitation. In addition schools often lack adequate toilet facilities.   \n \nThere is an urgent need to upgrade and expand the rural water supply and sanitation services. The Project \n8. \naims to rehabilitate group water pipelines where viable and to develop new supply systems from ground and surface \nwater sources in the rural areas. The Project will provide access to potable water to the settlements where pipes are \nno  longer  in  working  order,  settlements  with  infrequent  water  supply,  and  settlements  that  never  had  piped  water \nsupply  but  manage  from  alternative  sources.  In  selecting  settlements  for  subprojects,  priority  will  be  given  to  the \nsettlements where pipes are no longer working, and settlements with infrequent water supply and with a large number \nof  poor  households.  In  providing  water  supply  to  the  settlements,  through  the  water  consumers  groups  (WCGs) \nmeasures will be taken to ensure that poor households, poor women-headed households, elderly, and disabled people \nhave access to water. \n \n\n \n\n \n\nB. \n\nPoverty Analysis   \n\nProposed Classification: Poverty Intervention \n\nKazakhstan ranks 73rd in the United Nations Development Programme Human Development Index of 2000. \n9. \nAlthough poverty was not unknown in the former Soviet Union, Kazakhstan was one of the least poor Central Asian \nrepublics. Since independence in 1991, Kazakhstan is making a difficult transition to a market-based economy. The \nsharp decline in output since independence has, however, contributed significantly to the increase in poverty.  \n \n10. \nThe proportion of households living below the poverty threshold rose from 15.5% in 1989 to 25.0% in 1993 \nand  34.6%  in  1996.  The  Kazakh  Statistics  Agency  calculated  the  percentage  of  the  population  with  a  consumption \nlevel lower than the subsistence minimum by using the data on cash incomes and expenditures, as well as data on \nvolume of material resources consumed.1 Based on the overall data, in 1998, the consumption of 39% population was \nlower than the subsistence minimum. In 1999, during a period of economic growth and increase of cash incomes, this \nindicator dropped but remains significant. The Government indicates that about 28.4% of the population lived below \nthe subsistence minimum in 2001. The most deprived regions are Kazakhstan\u2019s southern provinces, and the oblast of \nNorth-Kazakhstan.  \n \n11. \nThe  economic  transition  has  been  accompanied  by  increasing  inequity  in  income  distribution.  In  1998,  the \nrichest 10% of the population received 27% of the income, while the poorest 10% received 2.3%. The poverty in rural \nareas is more acute than in urban areas. In urban areas 25% of the population is considered to be poor while in rural \nareas this increases to 35%. In rural area average living minimum per capita monthly income is T3,020 (or about $20), \nwhile monthly per  capita  income  in  the  urban  area  is  about  twice  that  amount.  The  situation  is  even  more  obvious \nwhen  access  to  social  infrastructure  services  such  as  safe  and  reliable  water  supply  and  sanitation  is  taken  into \naccount.  Health  and  demographic  indicators  reinforce  the  presence  of  greater  levels  of  human  deprivation  in  rural \nareas. \n \n12. \nThe social and economic costs of the current transition have been sharp and immediate. Closing of facilities, \nprivatization of public enterprises, and falling budget for the sector have resulted in service disruption and major price \nincreases  for  these  services.  Social  spending  including  social  assistance  and  provision  of  social  services  such  as \nhealth and education has declined sharply. Weak fiscal capability of local governments has sharply reduced access to \nsocial  infrastructure  such  as  heating,  transport,  water  supply,  and  sanitation  facilities.  As  a  result,  health,  sanitation \nand general living standards are rapidly worsening. During the Soviet  Union era, housing, heating, water supply and \nsanitation were free of charge. In service terms they accounted for 30% of household income. Wages have fallen by \nover  50%  in  real  terms  and  earlier  security  of  job  tenure  has  been  replaced  by  unemployment.  Unemployment is \nespecially high in small towns. Living conditions of people have been severely affected by environmental degradation \nsuch as air and groundwater contamination. The problem is noticeable in rural water supply and sanitation systems. \n \n \n                                                 \n1   The poverty incidence is based on the Government\u2019s definition of a subsistence minimum, which is set in the 1999 \n\u201cSubsistence Minimum\u201d law. It is equivalent to the minimum consumption basket estimated on the basis of a food \nand  non-food  basket  of  expenditures.  The  National  Statistical  Agency  calculates  the  subsistence  minimum  on  a \nquarterly basis and by oblast levels. In 2001, the value of the subsistence minimum was T4,590 per month. The \nGovernment differentiates the subsistence minimum from the \u201cpoverty line\u201d in that the latter which is also regulated \nby  legislation,  is  determined  every  year  by  Parliament  as  a  fixed  percentage  of  the  subsistence  minimum.  This \npoverty  line  is  used  as  a  basis  for  social  assistance.  In  2001,  the  poverty  line  was  38%  of  the  subsistence \nminimum, or T1,781 per month.  \n\n\f \n\n48\n\nAppendix 10 \n\nThe population in the Project area consists of two major ethnic groups: the Kazakhs in the South and the \n13. \nRussians in the North. Household survey of 2000 interviews, focus group interviews, and rapid social assessments in \nfour oblasts indicate most of the family members are not engaged in any intensive economic activity. A majority of the \nrural population strongly perceives a sharp decline in quality of their life as compared to during the Soviet era. Having \nfaced  serious  problems  in  the  process  of  privatization  and  agriculture  restructuring,  many  families  had  to  give  up \nmaintaining livestock; they are unable to buy fodder and afford other expenses required for livestock maintenance. \n \n14. \nThe average monthly income per person of the families surveyed is T2,453, being below the living minimum \nestablished officially. The lowest average income (T2,034) is in South-Kazakhstan and the highest average (T2,925) in \nAkmola. The average income of Kazakh families is lower than that of Russian families. Out of ethnic Kazakhs 60.9% \nhave a per capita income of less than T2,000, and out of the ethnic Russians it is 37.8%. Focus group discussions in \neight  villages  in  four  oblasts  suggest  that  poor  families  make  up  30-60%  of  the  families  in  these  villages.    In  these \ncommunities, the poorest of the poor constitutes families: (i) with no access to cash income or earn very little cash, (ii) \nwith small household plot, (iii) with no cultivable land, (iv) with no cattle, and (v) living on pension only.      \n\nC. \nStakeholder analysis prepared:  Yes \n\nParticipation Process \n\nParticipatory strategy included:  Yes \n\n15. \nA  more  participatory  approach  for  stakeholders  has  been  recommended.  Survey  indicates  that  over  two \nthirds of the respondents supports the idea of setting up a WCG. All the focus groups approved of the idea on setting \nup  WCGs  composed  of  local  people.  Respondents  show  greater  willingness  to  participate  in  a  WCG,  the  less \naccessible  and  the  poorer  quality  the  water  that  they  have.    A  WCG  will  be  formed  for  each  subproject  to  assist  in \nplanning, implementing, and monitoring of the project activities. Developing WCGs will ensure community participation \nand local level ownership of the Project. Sense of ownership and active community participation would contribute to \neffective  implementation  and  sustainability  of  the  Project.  The  WCGs  will  be  involved  in  the  design  phase  of  each \nsubproject. In designing each subproject, the rural communities of the respective subproject areas will be involved in \nassisting  in  the  planning  and  implementation  of  the  subproject.  Through  the  WCG,  the  local  communities  will \nparticipate  in  decision-making  processes  on  the  types  of  water  connection  in  the  subproject  area,  location of public \nstandpipes,  level  of  services,  and  tariffs.  Women  from  the  rural  settlements  will  be  actively  involved  in  the  planning \nprocess especially for selection of location of public standpipes. The WCG will help the poor and disabled to get equal \naccess to water supply in the settlement. The WCG will be responsible for monitoring of regular water supply, access \nto water by the poor households, regular payment of tariff, quality of water, and prevention of water waste. The WCG \nwill  consists  of  male  and  female  representatives  from  the  community,  and  representatives  of  local  nongovernmental \norganizations (NGOs) and local governments. At least half of the membership and management positions of the WCG \nwill be held by women. \n \n16. \nHygiene  and  sanitation  education  both  in  schools  and  at  the  community  level  will  be  undertaken  in \nconjunction with the water supply improvements.  The selected NGOs and WCGs at the community level will facilitate \nthe hygiene and sanitation education program. Volunteers from the community will be selected to facilitate community \nmeetings and disseminate information in the schools. Women and youth in the community will be trained as volunteers \nfor the hygiene and sanitation education program. \n \n\nD.         Gender and Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: Yes \n\nGender strategy prepared: Yes \n\n17. \nWomen  have  played  a  significant  role  in  the  economic  development  of  Kazakhstan.  However,  current \neconomic  transitions  have  affected  men  and  women  differently.  New  gender-specific  inequalities  have  developed \nduring the transformation process. Since 1990 there has been a loss of women's jobs in practically every section of \nthe economy. Female employment decreased by nearly half. On average, the share of poor female population with \nincome  below  the  subsistence  level  is  44.9%,  while  the  poor  male  population,  33.2%.    Women  are  often  more \nvulnerable  in  terms  of  social  security.  The  deterioration  of  public  support  mechanisms  has had a severe impact on \npoor, women, children, and elderly. Evidence suggests that women especially, elderly pensioners, and single women \nheading large households are the majority of people living below subsistence minimum. \n \n18. \nSince the access to potable water supply has decreased significantly, the living conditions of poor pensioners \nand single women-headed  households  are  most  seriously  affected.    Half  of  the  pensioners  are  women.  Since  the \npipeline  became  dysfunctional  and  water  have  to  be  collected  from  long  distances,  women,  men,  and  children  are \ninvolved in fetching water. Women\u2019s responsibility for family care and household work is affected by lack of availability \nof water and it has seriously complicated the already  difficult circumstances of many women, especially poor women \nand single mothers. In caring for the family, women bear the brunt of inadequate and poor quality of water. In health \nterms, pregnant women, nursing mothers, and young children are at greatest risk.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n49 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n19. \nTherefore the improvement of WSS systems can save women's time and reduce physical burdens. Women \nwill also have considerable influence on the behavioral patter of communities with their important roles as educators \nand  information  disseminators  of  hygiene  practices.  Women\u2019s  role  in  child  care  will  be  made  easier  through  better \nhealth of children expected from safe, potable piped water supply. A participatory approach is recommended, and the \nrole of women is expected to become more important. \n \n \nE.  \n\nSocial Safeguards and Other Social Risks \n \n\n \nSignificant/ \nNonsignificant/ \nNone \n\nResettlement \n\nNone \n\nIndigenous Peoples  \n\nNone \n\n \nLabor \n\n \nAffordability \n\nNonsignificant \n\nSignificant \n\nOther Risks/ \nVulnerabilities  \n \n\nNonsignificant \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n \nLand is required only for small groundwater pumping stations \nand, in some cases, small storage tanks. These will be \noutside the village areas in agricultural land or unused land \nowned by the village governments. They will make land \navailable as an in kind contribution to local funding. There is \nno possibility of the Project triggering the involuntary \nresettlement policy.  \nSocial assessment indicated that no indigenous people are \ninvolved in the proposed investment components. No plan is \nwarranted. \nImpact on labor is not expected to be significant, so no \nstrategy has been designed to target labor. \n\nThe tariff will vary between 3.3% and 5.0% with an average \nof about 4.2% of the estimated average household income. \nThese are within the accepted standards of 3-5%. As the \npoorer households will collect water from the public \nstandpipes at a lower rate, in their case the cost will be much \nless than households with house connection.  \nLow risks in other aspects are anticipated. \n\n \nPlan \nRequired \n\nNone \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n50\n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  about  0.53  million  of  the  country's  most  deprived  and \nunderprivileged  people  in  the  oblasts  (provinces)  of  North-Kazakhstan,  Akmola,  Karaghandy, \nand South-Kazakhstan, of which approximately 40% of the population are poor. The support for \ndecentralized  management  and  capacity  building  will  enhance  the  efficiency  and  sustainability \nof  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  (WSS)  infrastructure  services  at  the  local  levels  in \nKazakhstan.  To  comply  with  the  needs  and  demands  of  the  community,  a  participatory \napproach  has  been  adopted  to  formulate  and  design  the  Project.  The  community,  water \nconsumers  groups  (WCGs),  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  community-based \norganizations (CBOs) will be involved in the implementation of the Project. \n\n2. \nThe  Project  will  develop  several  direct  and  indirect  benefits.  Better  access  to  potable \nwater  with  improved  rural  WSS  services  to  areas  both  currently  served  and  without  existing \npiped water supply or safe sanitation facilities will confer several long and short-term benefits. \nThere will be qualitative improvement in the lives of the rural communities, in particular the poor. \nLiving  conditions  will  improve  at  individual  and  communal  levels,  including  opportunities  for \nimproved  health.  Improved  sanitation  facilities  will  support  higher  standards  of  public  hygiene. \nMajor benefits include time saving,  increased  water  consumption,  and  improved  water  quality. \nThe  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  through  the  release  of  time  for  productive  economic \nactivities and education will be significant. Sample surveys in the project area indicate that some \nhouseholds can spend as much as three hours per day collecting water from various sources, \nincluding rivers, or buy it at a high price from vendors instead.  The time and money saved will \nbecome available to households for other economic and social activities. \n\nAlthough  difficult  to  quantify,  the  Project  will  result  in  health  benefits.    The  provision  of \n3. \nmore reliable water supplies and improved sanitation facilities will help to reduce morbidity and \nmortality, including the high morbidity rate of young children in these areas. It will also reduce \nthe number of working days lost and hence income lost. Reduced illness will provide the basis \nfor  additional  poverty  reduction  and  economic  benefits  by  increasing  capacity  for  income \ngeneration.  By  reducing  water  supply  losses  and  wastage  the  existing  inefficiencies  and \nresulting  costs  can  be  minimized.  Security  of  supply  and  improved  standards  of  service  will \nincrease  the  willingness  to  pay  for  service  and  will  contribute  to  cost  recovery.  Financial \nmanagement and accounting improvements, including meter reading, billing, and collection will \nimprove tariff-collection levels and the viability of the implementing agencies.  \n\n4. \nFollowing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  guidelines  on  Economic  Analysis  of \nWater Supply Projects , an economic analysis was undertaken. The economic analysis is based \non  the  findings  of  the  socioeconomic  survey  and  other  available  secondary  data.    In  brief,  the \nfollowing methodology was followed: \n\n(i) \n\nBoth  project  capital  cost  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  cost  estimates \nwere  apportioned  into  traded  and  nontraded  components  and  labor  so  as  to \nreflect  costs  from  the  standpoint  of  the  economy  as  a  whole.  Using  domestic \nprice  numeraire,  financial  prices  (based  on  July  2001  prices  and  reduced  by \nduties and taxes) were converted to economic prices by shadow exchange rate \nfactor  of  1.06  for  traded  cost  component;  nontraded  cost  component  was \nconsidered as 1.0. Using a factor of 0.7, the estimated labor cost was converted \nto reflect the real market value of labor. \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n51 \n\n \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nCurrent  water  consumption,  considered  as  nonincremental,  was  obtained  from \nthe  survey  figure.  Based  on  the  design  norms  for  the  subprojects  incremental \nwater  provided  by  the  Project  was  estimated.  For  the  purpose  of  analysis,  the \nfuture without-project scenario is assumed to remain at the existing level. \n\nAverage cost of nonincremental water was estimated with reference to the time \nand  other  savings  likely  to  be  generated  as  a  result  of  the  Project. Using the \naverage  distance  and  the  collection  time,  the  cost  of  time  used  for  collecting \nwater was estimated at 75% of the average hourly wage rate. This was multiplied \nwith the shadow wage rate of 0.7 and the number of hours needed per month. To \nthis, the cost for in-house storage, filtration, etc., of water was added (these costs \nwere  considered  as  non-traded  costs  and  therefore  no  conversion  factor  was \napplied).  The  total  cost  to  the  household  was  then  divided  by  the  water \nconsumption to arrive at per cubic meter (m3) cost of present water, i.e. economic \nbenefit from nonincremental water.   \n\n(iv) \n\nFor  economic-benefit  quantification,  incremental  water  is  valued  at  the  average \ndemand  price,  which  is  approximated  by  the  average  between  the  current  and \nfuture  costs  of  water  supply.  It  has  been  assumed  that  future  price  of  water \nsupply  will  be  based  on  the  household  affordability  criteria  restricted  to  5%  of \nincome available for payment for water supply. \n\n5. \nFollowing  this  methodology  the  quantifiable  benefits  of  time  saved  in  obtaining  water \nwas compared on an incremental basis with the project capital cost stream to demonstrate the \neconomic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs)  for  the  four  subprojects.  As  economic  benefits  from \nthe time savings alone justify the Project on economic grounds, other economic benefits, e.g., \nsavings in medical expenses were not considered for analysis due to the uncertainty associated \nin their estimation. The EIRRs range from 22.6% in the case of Bulayev  subproject to 38.6% in \nthe case of Shortandy subproject. The wide range mainly reflects variations in per capita costs \narising out of the base population, the characteristics of the subproject area and the source of \nwater supply. The EIRRs are all well above the economic opportunity cost of capital of 12% in \nKazakhstan.  The  EIRRs  were  subjected  to  sensitivity  analysis  and  remain  acceptable  under \nadverse circumstances, as summarized in Table A11.1.  \n\nTable A11.1: Summary of Economic Analysis of Subprojects \n\nSubproject \n \n\nBase  \nEIRR  % \n\n1 Shortandy  \n\n(Sensitivity indicators) \n\n2 Spasskoe  \n\n(Sensitivity indicators) \n\n3  Nurinsky \n\n(Sensitivity indicators) \n\n4  Bulayev \n\n(Sensitivity indicators) \n\n38.6 \n \n27.2 \n \n31.1 \n \n22.6 \n \n\nCosts \n+10% \n35.5 \n(0.81) \n25.0 \n(0.82) \n28.7 \n(0.79) \n20.5 \n(0.91) \n\nSensitivity Tests \n\nBenefits \u2013\n20% \n31.6 \n(0.91) \n22.2 \n(0.92) \n25.6 \n(0.89) \n18.0 \n(1.02) \n\nCosts +5% & \nBenefits \u201310% \n33.6 \n \n23.7 \n \n27.2 \n \n19.3 \n\n \n\nBenefits \ndelayed 1 year \n30.3 \n \n22.5 \n \n25.5 \n \n18.8 \n\n \n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return. \n \nThe  average  incremental  cost  (AIC),  usually  regarded  as  an  approximation  of  the  long \n6. \nrun  marginal  cost,  was  calculated  based  on  the  present  value  of  additional  capital  investment \nand  O&M  costs  divided  by  the  present  value  of  additional  volume  of  water sold/consumed \nresulting from such investments. The average incremental (economic and financial) costs were \n\n\f \n\n52\n\nAppendix 11 \n\ncalculated to determine the economic and financial tariffs required to be set for full cost recovery \nbased  on  August  2001  prices  over  the  assumed  project life of 20 years and using a discount \nrate  of  12%,  considered  appropriate  to  represent  the  economic  cost  of  capital.  The  average \nincremental  economic  cost  (AIEC)  and  average  incremental  financial  cost  (AIFC)  have  direct \nrelation to the project costs, which are high due to the long distance to the water source, and the \nrelated operating costs. AIEC varies between T57 per m3 and T91 per m3. AIFC, which is similar \nto the AIEC except that capital and O&M costs are expressed in financial terms, varies between \nT59 per m3 and T94 per m3, as summarized in Table A11.2.  \n \n\nTable A11.2: Summary Average Incremental Costs \n\n \n\nSubproject \n\nShortandy  \nSpasskoe  \nNurinsky \nBulayev \n\nAverage Incremental Cost (T/m3) \nAIFC \nAIEC \n59 \n57 \n83 \n80 \n74 \n70 \n94 \n91 \n\nT = Tenge. \n\n            AIEC = average incremental economic cost, AIFC = average incremental financial cost, m 3 = cubic meters,  \n \n \nB. \n \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n7. \nExisting water tariff in the core subproject areas are composed of fixed monthly fee per \nhousehold for public standpipe users and a fixed rate per m 3 of water consumed for metered in-\nhouse connections. Water vendors charge the household per water tanker. Households using \nthe public standpipe and with in-house connections pay on the average T30 to T400 per month, \nwhile households supplied by water vendors, pay from T40 to T260 per m3 of water delivered. \nWater purchased from water vendors is mainly used for drinking purposes. The existing water \ntariff in the four subprojects are shown in Table A11.3. \n\n \nTable A11.3: Existing Household Water Consumption and Expenditure \n \n\nWater \nConsumption \n\nWater Tariff \n\n \nSubproject \n\nAverage \nHH  size \n\nEstimated \nWater Supply \nExpenditure \n(T/month/HH) \n\nSource of \nWater \n\n(m3/month/HH) \n to     5.3  \n to     4.5  \n to     3.2  \n to     3.6  \n  \n  \n\n Shortandy \n Spasskoe \n Nurinskya \n Bulayeva \n  \n  \nGWP = group water pipeline; GWS = group water source, HH = household; m 3 = cubic meters. \na  Delivered by water tanker. \n\n        3.4  \n        3.3  \n 40 to 260          3.8  \n 150 to 190   80 to 200          3.9  \n  \n\n 50 to 250  \n 30 to 400  \n 100 to 600  \n 150 to 700  \n\n     0.7  \n     3.0  \n     1.7  \n     1.2  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nT/month \n(Flat Rate)  Per m3 \n 55  \n 50 to 200  \n 30 to 400  \n dna  \n dna  \n\n GWS  \n GWS  \n GWP  \n GWP  \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\nWater supply tariffs should generally be set based on the AIFC of water produced, but \n8. \nthey seldom are. The proposed capital investments consider the long-term needs of the service \narea and population to be served over a period of 20 years. The capital and O&M costs are high \ndue to the long distance between the water sources and the service areas. Average incremental \ncost  of  water  supply  is  very  high.  Full  cost  recovery  based  on  AIC  is  not  feasible  and,  on \neconomic  grounds,  not  affordable  for  most  of  the  income  groups.  Tariffs  were,  therefore, \ndesigned for the core subprojects taking into account the existing water tariffs, concerns of the \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n53 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAnti-Monopolies  Agency  and  the  affordability  of  the  water  tariffs  to  the  communities  (monthly \nwater  expenditure  was  restricted  to  5%  of  household  income  of  the  low-income group) in the \nproject area.  \n\n \nWhere the schemes are based on public standpipe supplies, the collection of fees will be \n9. \nmade  from  the  beneficiaries  either  (i)  through  bulk  metering  of  each  public  standpipe  with \nidentified households as users and under the supervision of the rayon (district) and the WCG, \nthe households will decide the allocation of their respective contribution, or (ii) a fixed monthly \ncharge  will  be  recovered  from  each  household  irrespective  of  their  consumption  level.  The \ncollection of fees based on bulk metering was done in some communities with an existing water \nsupply system but failed due to administrative problems. With respect of in-house connections, \nthere are two options: (i) a flat rate where metering is not available, and (ii) a fixed tariff per m3 \nof water consumed where metering is available.  It is difficult to control both consumption and \nwastage under a flat rate system. Thus for metered connection, it was proposed to use the latter \nscheme.  Based  on  the  discussion  with  the  Anti-Monopolies  Agency,  it  was  agreed  that  a  flat \nrate  will  be  charged  on  public  standpipe  users  and  a  fixed  rate  per  m3 of water consumed for \nhouseholds with metered in-house connection. The proposed tariffs are shown in Table A11.4. \n \nTable A11.4: Suggested Water Tariff by Subproject \n\nSubproject \nPublic standpipe users (T/month/household) \nMetered in-house connection (T/cubic meter) \n\nShortandy  Spasskoe  Nurinsky \n200 \n30 \n\n200 \n35 \n\n200 \n40 \n\nBulayev \n250 \n45 \n\nBased on the proposed tariff, the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) was determined. \n10. \nThe FIRR (base case) ranged from 0.7% to 2.3%. The calculations assume an annual subsidy \nfrom  the  Government  equivalent  to  the  annual  depreciation  of  the  capital  investments.  The \nFIRRs are below the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) computed at 5% (assuming the \nopportunity  cost  of  Government  investment  as  10%).  However,  as  the  EIRR  is  above  the \neconomic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  considered  at  12%  the  subprojects  are  justified  on \neconomic considerations. Table A11.5 shows the summary of FIRRs: \n\nTable A11.5: Summary of Financial Analysis of Subprojects \n\nSubproject \n\nShortandy \nSpasskoe \nNurinsky \nBulayev \n\nBase \nFIRR \n% \n2.2 \n2.3 \n1.4 \n0.7 \n\nAssumed subsidy \nfrom the Government \n(T million/year) \n0 \n3.5 \n5.3 \n9.1 \n\n% of Depreciation \ncovered by \nProject Revenue \n128 to 258 \n51 to 105 \n11 in year 17 \n31 to 79 \n\n \n\n          FIRR = financial internal rate of return. \n\nAffordability Analysis and Project Sustainability  \n\nC. \n \n11.  Sustainable O&M of water supply facilities is a major problem especially in rural areas of \ndeveloping countries. For the four subprojects, the socio-economic survey results showed that \nthere  was  willingness  both  to  have  piped  water  connections  and  to  pay  for  the  services.  The \ntariffs will vary between 3.2% and 5.0% with an average of about 4.2% of the estimated average \nhousehold income. These are within the accepted standards of 3.5%. As the poorer households \nwill collect water from public standpipes at a lower rate, in their case the cost will be much less \nthan  households  with  in-house  connections.  The  proposed  tariff,  although  affordable  (Table \nA11.6), will not be able to sustain the O&M of constructed facilities as in the case of Nurinsky \n\n\f \n\n54\n\nAppendix 11 \n\nsubproject. The financial analysis for the Nurinsky subproject shows that the proposed tariff will \nonly  cover  80-90%  of  O&M  cost  in  the  next  10  years.  Subsidy  from  the  Government  will  be \nneeded just to operate and maintain the system. For the Shortandy subproject, the subproject \nrevenue  will  be  able  to  cover  O&M  and  depreciation.  However  for  the  Spasskoe  and  Bulayev \nsubprojects,  the  subproject  revenue  can  only  cover  O&M  and  part  of  the  depreciation.  The \nGovernment  may  have  to  subsidize  capital  investments  to  replace  the  old  ones  in  the  future. \nDuring  the  appraisal  mission,  discussions  with  the  akims  (local  government  heads)  of  the \nrayons  visited  revealed  that  on  the  average  about  80%  of  the  rayon\u2019s  annual  budget  is \nsubsidized by the Central Government while the remaining 20% comes from local taxes. More \nthan  80%  of  the  budget  is  spent  on  salaries  and  pensions  and  the  balance  is  used  for  capital \ninvestment and O&M of public facilities. Although there is willingness on the part of the rayons \nto  subsidize  the  O&M  of  constructed  water  supply  facilities,  the  rayons  may  not  have  the \nfinancial capacity to finance the O&M. Any subsidy for water supply O&M, therefore, will come \nfrom the provinces, which also gave indications that they are willing to subsidize the O&M cost. \nTo insure project sustainability for the succeeding subprojects, the selection criteria will include \nevaluation  of  the  capacity  and  commitment  of  the  participating  oblast  to  provide  subsidy  for \nsubprojects with O&M cost that exceeds the subproject revenues generated. \n \n\nTable A11.6: Average Household Consumption Level and Affordability \n \n\nSubproject \n\nConsumption \nLevel \n\nMonthly \nConsumption \nof Average \nHH \n\nTariff for \nDifferent \nUser \nCategory \n\nMonthly \nCost to \nHH \n\nWater Cost \nas % of  HH \nIncome \n\nPublic Standpipe \nUsers \n1.

This  summary \n\n1. \nThe initial screening of the potential environmental impacts of the Project indicates that it \nwill  not  affect  environmentally  sensitive  areas,  nor  will  it  cause  large-scale  changes  in  the \nphysical, biological, or social environment. It will have a largely neutral impact on the ecology of \nthe  surrounding  areas.  Overall  there  will  be  positive  effect  on  the  physical  environment,  and \nimprovements in the health, social and economic environment of the beneficiaries. The physical \nworks  proposed  are  limited  in  scope,  and  largely  concern  the  development  of  local  water \nsupplies  and \ninitial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)  draws  on  the  individual  subproject  IEEs  and  is  prepared  in \naccordance with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) guidelines on IEE preparation. The outline \nIEE  is  based  on  a  series  of  field  visits  to  the  subproject  sites  by  the  technical  assistance \nconsultants and the design institutes responsible for investigation of each subproject. Software \ncomponents  such  as  the  capacity  building  and  community  preparation  and  awareness \ncomponents, which have no impact on the environment, have not been subjected to an IEE. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  Project  components  include  Part  A:  Physical  Infrastructure  comprising  the \nconstruction new of local water supplies, or the rehabilitation of existing systems, and improved \ninstitutional  and  household  sanitation;  and  Part  B:  Capacity  Building  for  the  staff  of  different \nlevels of government and of state institutions, and for community members.  \n\nDescription of the Project \n\nC. \n\nExisting Environmental Conditions \n\n1. \n\nPhysical Environment \n\n3. \nNorthern  Kazakhstan  is  primarily  open  steppe.  The  climate  is  arid  and  sharply \ncontinental. Summers are dry and warm.  Winters are cold, with snow covering the ground from \nOctober  to  April.  Local  streams  are  seasonal  and  are  often  mineralized  once  the  snow  has \nmelted.  Groundwater  levels  can  be  high  in  the  spring.  Many  surface  water  and  groundwater \nresources  are  mineralized  because  of  high  evaporation  rates,  low  precipitation,  and  little \nmovement of surface or groundwater. Most communities are more than 5 kilometers (km) apart, \nand sometimes as much as 30-40 km. The  situation  in  the  south  of  the  country  is  similar, \nalthough the distances between communities are often not so great. Most rural communities are \ninvolved  in  some  sort  of  agriculture.  In  many  cases  this  is  individual,  small-scale agriculture. \nThere is little flora or fauna of note in the subproject areas. No rare or endangered flora or fauna \nare  known  to  inhabit  these  areas.  Hunting  and  fishing  are  common,  especially  during  the \nautumn and early winter. \n\n2. \n\nSociocultural Environment \n\n4. \nPopulation  densities  in  the  subproject  communities  are  typically  in  the  range  40-60 \npersons per hectare. Since independence the population growth rate has been negative, largely \nas a result of migration. The declining birth rate and the increasing death rate has contributed to \nthe decline. Per capita income in most communities is low. It is estimated that in 1998 83% of \nrural households had a disposable income of less than T3,000 ($20) per month.  \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n56\n\nAppendix 12 \n\nD. \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n1. \n\nPositive Environmental Impacts \n\nThe positive environmental benefits that will result from the Project include improved use \n5. \nof scarce water resources through improvements in the distribution and use of water; reduced \nenvironmental  pollution,  especially  of  ground  and  surface  water,  through  improvements  in \ninstitutional  and  domestic  sanitation;  and  improved  human  health  due  to  (i)  increases  in  the \nquantity and quality of the water available; (ii) improved access to improved sanitation services, \nsuch as public banyas (public bath houses), institutional toilets, handwashing facilities, etc.; and \n(iii)  reduced  human  exposure  to  wastes  and  reduced  odor  and  insect  nuisance  through \nimprovements in institutional and domestic sanitation. \n\n2. \n\nPotential Negative Environmental Impacts \n\na. \n\n Environmental Problems Due to Project Location \n\n6. \nThere are few possible environmental problems associated with the subproject locations. \nIn  most  cases  the  infrastructure  that  will  result  will  affect  the  local  environment  positively. \nHowever some components, such as the  need  to  dispose  of  wastes  from  improved  sanitation \nand from desalination, may have minor negative impacts. Mitigation measures will be included \nin the Project to minimize these impacts. \n\nb. \n\nEnvironmental Problems Related to Design, Construction Stage, and \nOperation \n\n7. \nImproper  design  and/or  siting  of  improved  sanitation  services  and  of  facilities  for \ndisposing  of  the  waste  from  desalination  plant  may  result  in  adverse  environmental  impacts. \nThere may also be problems attributed to the use of inexperienced and ill-equipped contractors \nto implement the works. During operation, overabstraction of limited water resources may result \nin  supplies  of  fresh  water  becoming  mineralized,  and  therefore  unsuitable  for  potable  use \nwithout  further  treatment.  Disposal  of  wastes  from  demineralization,  water  treatment,  latrines, \nand also the disposal of wastewater and solid waste could result in some negative impacts on \npublic health and environmental pollution.  \n\n3. \n\nMitigation Measures \n\na. \n\nProject Selection and Location \n\nAs much as possible subprojects will avoid areas that are environmentally sensitive and \n8. \nthose that will have a negative impact on cultural heritage. The Project will be implemented in \nareas where environment improvements are expected as a result of the Project. \n\nb. \n\nProject Design \n\n9. \nAll  subproject  components  will  be  designed  to  ensure  optimum  use  and  appropriate \ndesign with minimum adverse environmental impacts. Sanitation components will be designed \nto  improve  the  efficiency  of  on-plot  sanitation  and  wastewater  disposal  systems,  optimize  the \ntreatment of wastes and avoidance of pollution, especially of water resources that will later be \nused for potable purposes without any form of treatment. Similarly wastes from demineralization \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \n57\n\nwill be discharged only where there will be no negative impact. Where these conditions do not \nexist the waste will be impounded in a reservoir.  \n \n\nc. \n\nProject Construction \n\n10. \nThe  potential  adverse  impacts  will  be  avoided  by  appointing  experienced  and \nresponsible contractors, and by providing training and capacity building for local contractors, the \nExecutive Agency, and other supervisory staff. As  population  densities  are  low  and  the  works \nare  relatively  small  scale  and  short  term  in  any  one  area,  the  overall  impact  felt  by  individual \ncommunity members with respect to dust, noise, interrupted access, is expected to be small.  \n\nd. \n\nProject Operation and Maintenance  \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\nInstitutional Issues and Environmental Monitoring \n\n11. \nProject  components  will  continue  to  avoid  negative  environmental  impacts  only  if  they \nare  operated  correctly  and  maintained  regularly.  The  necessary  technical  skills,  financial \nresources,  and  operational,  maintenance,  and  monitoring  systems  must  therefore  be  put  in \nplace  as  part  of  the  subproject.  The  capacity-building  component  of  the  Project  will  provide \ntraining  in  O&M  for  the  oblast  and  rayon  agencies  and  water  consumer  groups  that  are \nexpected to be responsible for O&M.  \n \nE. \n \n12. \nOverall  responsibility  for  environmental  protection  lies  with  the  Ministry  of  Natural \nResources  and  Environmental  Protection.  Regulations  and  guidelines  concerning  local \nenvironmental  approval  of  the  subprojects  are  detailed  and  comprehensive,  and  are  generally \nmore strict than ADB\u2019s environmental requirements.  \n \nF. \n \n13. \nThe goal of the Project is to improve the living conditions and health of rural communities \nin  the  project  area  through  improved  access  to  increased  quantities  of  safe  water  supply, \nimproved  sanitation,  and  hygiene  and  sanitation  information.  As  about  40%  of  the  rural \npopulation  in  the  project  area  is  considered  poor,  it  is  expected  that  the  Project  will  result  in \nconsiderable  benefits  to  poor  people.  They  will  run  less  risk  of  incurring  infectious  diseases \nthrough  reduced  exposure  to  inadequate  quantities  of  contaminated  and  untreated  water \nsupplies,  reduced  exposure  to  the  various  wastes  generated  in  the  villages,  and  through \nimproved  access  to  quantities  of  good  quality  water  and  better  sanitation  facilities.  Some \npotential adverse impacts considered are the need to dispose of the mineralized water that will \narise  from  the  treatment  of  mineralized  water  for  potable  water  supply,  and  the  possible \nconcentration  of  wastes  from  the  development  of  toilets.  However,  by  carefully  choosing  the \nmethods  to  be  used  for  disposal  of  these  wastes,  and  their  location,  it  is  considered  that \npotential  adverse  impacts  can  be  minimized.  Further,  if  the  construction  process  is  well \nmanaged  the  short-term  minor  negative  impacts  of  the  Project  will  be  far  outweighed  by  the \nmajor positive impacts of improved water supply services and sanitation infrastructure. Thus, on \nthe  basis  of  this  initial  evaluation,  and  careful  attention  to  the  mitigation  of  potential  adverse \nimpacts  it  is  considered  that  the  Project  is  unlikely  to  result  in  any  adverse  environmental \nimpacts.  The  identified  potential  adverse  effects  will  be  readily  addressed  through  proper \nengineering  design  and  incorporation  of  the  identified  mitigation  measures.  The  screening  of \npotential  impacts  and  mitigation  measures  associated  with  this  Project  are  summarized in the \nfollowing table. \n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures  \n \n\n \nPotential Adverse or Negative Impact \nA.
