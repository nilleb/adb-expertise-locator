The report also describes proposed administration of technical \nassistance  (TA)  to  be  provided  by  the  Multi-Donor  Trust  Fund 1 under  the  Water  Financing \nPartnership Facility for Strengthening Urban Flood Management in Huainan Municipality, and if \nthe  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the \nBoard, approve the TA.2 \n\n2. \nThe project is located in Huainan Municipality of Anhui Province. The project will support \nthe  Huainan  municipal  government  (HMG)  in  implementing  components  of  the  Huainan \nMunicipality Master Plan, 2010\u20132020 related to urban water systems.3 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nHuainan spans both banks of Huai River; 87 kilometers (km) of the river flow through the \nmunicipality. The  total  land  area  of the  municipality  is  1,895.4  square kilometers,  and the total \npopulation  is  2.46  million.  Inadequate  infrastructure  development,  rapid  urbanization,  and \neconomic  development  have  resulted  in  a  heavy  pollution  load\u2014mainly  caused  by  domestic \nwastewater and solid waste\u2014to the urban water system, including six urban water channels and \nfive lakes.4 At the same time, flood control capacity of the urban water systems is not sufficient; \nvarious locations in Huainan experience flood damage every year. \n\n4. \nIn the urban area of Huainan, two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) serve each of \nthe  eastern  and  western  areas  of  the  municipality.5 Huainan  Capital Water  Company  (HCWC) \noperates  the  WWTPs  based  on  a  2004  concession  agreement  with  the  HMG.  During \n2000\u22122011,  Huainan increased  the sewer  system  length from  430 km to  679  km.  Each  of  the \ntwo WWTPs has a treatment capacity of 100,000 cubic meters per day (m3/day). However, the \neastern  WWTP  is  treating  only  90,000  m3/day  of  wastewater  and  the  western  WWTP \n73,000 m3/day  because  the  wastewater  collection  system  coverage  is  still  low\u201464%  for  the \neastern urban area, and 66% for the western urban area. In addition, wastewater generated in \nHuainan  has  been  increasing  from  160,000  m3/day  in  2009  to  228,000  m3/day  in  2011.  As  a \nresult, the wastewater treatment rate has remained at approximately 75%.  \n\nHuainan\u2019s  urban  area  is  served  partially  by  a  combined  sewer  system  (CSS)  and \n5. \npartially  by  a  sanitary  sewer  system  (SSS).  Under  the  CSS,  only  a  portion  of  the  wastewater \ncollected  through  combined  sewers,  together  with  storm  water  during  floods,  is  transferred \nthrough  urban  water  channels  to  the  eastern  or  western  WWTPs.  Most  of  the  wastewater  is \ndirectly discharged to the lakes and Huai River without treatment. Under  the SSS, wastewater \ncollected through sanitary sewers is directly transferred to the WWTPs. Water quality in all six \nwater  channels  in  the  urban  area  are  class  V+  because  they  are  used  to  convey  both \nwastewater  and  storm  water.  Of  the  five  lakes  in  the  urban  area,  water  quality  in  Long  Lake, \n\n                                                \n1  Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  TA.  ADB.  2012.  Technical  Assistance  to  the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Preparing  the  Anhui  Huainan  Urban  Water  Systems  Integrated  Rehabilitation \nProject. Manila. \n\n4  Untreated industrial wastewater is not being discharged into the urban water channels, lakes, or Huai River. \n5  The urban area is the same as the project area. \n\n\fDajiangou  Wetlands,  and  Shijian  Lake  are  worse  than  class  IV;  and  water  quality  in  Gaotang \nLake  is  class  IV.6 Sludge,  sediment,  and  solid  waste  have  accumulated  in  the  channels  and \nlakes  over  time  causing  increasing  deterioration  of  the  urban  water  and  lake  environments. \nWhile  many  of  the  monitoring  points  of  the  Huainan  section  of  Huai  River  are  class  III,  some \npoints are worse than class III at times.7 \n\n6. \nHuainan has two types of flooding: (i) overflows from Gaotang Lake and Huai River, and \n(ii) urban waterlogging.8 Historically, Huainan has been highly vulnerable to flooding from Huai \nRiver. Various flood control projects  are being implemented to control floods, and the Huainan \nsection of Huai River will have flood control capacity for a 1 in 100 year flood by 2015. Huainan \nis  also  vulnerable  to  flooding  from  Gaotang  Lake,  which  occurs  once  every  3\u20134  years, \ninundating areas as extensive as 10 square kilometers. About 22,000 people currently live along \nthe shores of Gaotang Lake. The HMG will develop a new district in this area for an additional \n20,000  people  in  2020  and  280,000  in  2030.  For  most  of  the  urban  area  in  Huainan,  storm-\nwater  runoff  flows  through  the  urban  water  channels  and  lakes  to  Huai  River.  Pump  stations \ndischarge  storm  water  from  lakes  to  Huai  River.  Currently,  many  of  the  urban  water  channels \nare designed for 1 in 5 year floods. However, the reduced capacity of the urban water channels \ndue to siltation and garbage accumulation, as well as insufficient capacity of the pump stations, \nstill causes waterlogging almost every year. \n\nTo  facilitate  the  development  of  Huainan,  the  HMG  prepared  the  Huainan  Municipality \n7. \nMaster Plan, 2010\u20132020, which was approved by the provincial and central governments. The \nmaster  plan  sets  targets  for  2020  for  the  water  environment  (water  quality  in  the  urban  water \nsystems  improved  to  class  IV  or  above)  and  flood  management  (storm-water  management \nsystem designed to handle 1 in 20 year rain storms).9 The HMG therefore requested the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB) \nimplement  and  complement \nto \ncomponents of the master plan related to urban water systems.  \n\nlending  support \n\nto  provide \n\n8. \nThe PRC\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan (2011\u20132015) supports the long-term goal of building \na  xiaokang  (harmonious  and  moderately  prosperous)  society  through  livelihood  improvement, \nand  regionally  balanced  and  environmentally  sustainable  growth.10 ADB\u2019s  country  partnership \nstrategy,  2011\u20132015  for  the  PRC  supports  the  government\u2019s  overarching  strategic  goal  of \nbuilding  a  xiaokang  society  by \ninclusive  growth, \nenvironmentally  sustainable  growth,  and  regional  cooperation  and  integration.11 The  project  is \nfully  consistent  with  the  PRC\u2019s  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan  (footnote  10)  and  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership strategy (footnote 11) by improving the urban water environment, public health, and \nquality  of  life.  ADB  will  closely  follow  the  PRC  government\u2019s  new  development  plan,  including \n\nthree  strategic  pillars: \n\nfocusing  on \n\n                                                \n6  Currently, Caoling Lake is filled with fly ash by private companies; and is basically dried up. \n7  Class I water has the highest quality and class V+ water the worst. Class III water is suitable as a supply source for \nmunicipal  drinking  water  treatment  and  for  swimming;  class  IV  is  suitable  for  use  as  a  general  industrial  water \nsupply  and  for  recreational  use  involving  no  direct  human  contact  with  the  water;  class  V  is  suitable  only  for \nagricultural water supply and general landscaping use; and class V+ is unsuitable for any use (PRC Environmental \nWater Quality Standard GB 3838-2002). \n\n8  Waterlogging occurs in low-lying areas when storm-water runoff exceeds the capacity of the drainage system. \n9  Main  components  of  the  master  plan  are  structural  measures;  nonstructural  measures  for  water  environmental \n\nimprovement and flood management are not included in the master plan.  \n\n10 Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, National People\u2019s Congress. 2011.

Major  lessons \nincorporated  in  the  project  design  are  the  importance  of  (i)  nonstructural  measures  and \ncommunity  participation \nflood  management,  and  \n(ii)  continuous  operation  and  maintenance  with  sustainable  financial  sources  based  on  a \nrealistic  and  enforceable  tariff  structure.  Other  general  lessons  reflected  in  the  project  design \nare (i) sludge management; (ii) effective cross-sector coordination; (iii) capacity development of \nthe  executing,  implementing,  and  relevant  agencies;  and  (iv)  establishment  of  an  effective \nproject monitoring and evaluation system. \n\nfor  environmental \n\nimprovement  and \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n10. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  an  improved  urban  water  environment,  public  health, \nand quality of life for urban residents in Huainan. The outcome will be improved management of \nsurface water resources in Huainan.  \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n11. \n\nThe project will have the following outputs:13 \n\n12. \nOutput  1:  Improvement  of  wastewater  collection.  Output  1  will  convert  the  existing \nCSS  to  SSS,  and  establish  SSS  in  newly  developed  areas  by  installing  new  sanitary  sewers. \nThe  SSS  will  separate  wastewater  and  storm  water,  and  transfer  the  wastewater  directly  to \nexisting eastern and western WWTPs. Existing buildings and communities being served by CSS \nwill  be  disconnected  from  combined  sewers  and  reconnected  to  the  newly  installed  sanitary \nsewers.14 Along and in the urban water channels, intercepting sewers and wells will be installed \nto  transfer  wastewater through the  SSS  to  the WWTPs.  Under  output  1,  (i) approximately  192 \nkm  of  new  sewers  will  be  installed,  including  sanitary  sewers,  intercepting  sewers,  and  pipes \nconnecting communities to the sanitary sewers;15 (ii) 10 intercepting wells will be constructed in \nsix urban water channels; and (iii) three wastewater pump stations will be constructed.16 \n\n \n\n                                                \n12 The official guidelines for the new government development plan, including an urbanization program, are expected \n\nto be disclosed in 2013. \n\n13 Output  1  will  improve  water  quality  in  urban  water  channels  and  lakes  by  reducing  wastewater  inflow  into  them. \nOutputs  2  and  3  will  improve  water  quality  and  environment  in  and  around  the  channels  and  lakes  by  removing \nsludge,  sediment,  and  solid  waste;  reducing  garbage  dumping;  constructing  wetlands,  building  revetments,  and \nplanting  vegetation  in  and  along  the  lakes;  and  monitoring  water  quality  and  ecological  impacts.  The  channels \nimproved and pump stations constructed or improved under output 2 will transmit storm water from the urban area \nto Gaotang Lake and Huai River, and reduce flood frequency from 1 in 5 years to 1 in 20 years.   \n\n14 After the conversion of CSS to SSS, combined sewers used for CSS will remain in operation; but only for transfer \n\nof storm water to urban water channels. \n\n15 For  buildings  and  communities  where  property  owners  or  developers  having  legal  title  can  be  identified,  pipes \nconnecting  the  buildings  and  communities  to  the  sanitary  sewers  will  be  installed  by  the  property  owners  or \ndevelopers  in  accordance  with  the  Urban  Wastewater  Discharge  Permit  Management  Method  issued  by  the \nMinistry  of  Construction  (Order  No.  152).  For  the  other  communities,  pipes  connecting  the  communities  to  the \nsanitary sewers will be installed under the project and financed under the ADB loan. \n\n16 Pursuant  to  the  Agreement  on  the  Expansion  of  Urban  Wastewater  Treatment  Plant  and  its  amendment  made \nbetween HCWC and the HMG, acting through the Huainan Municipal Urban and Rural Construction Committee, in \n2012 and 2013, HCWC will expand the eastern WWTP from 100,000 m3/day to 150,000 m3/day by June 2015, and \nto  200,000  m3/day  by  2019;  and  the  western  WWTP  from  100,000  m3/day  to  150,000  m3/day  by  2018.  These \nexpansions are out of the project scope, but the WWTPs are associated facilities of the project.  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fremoving  sludge,  sediment,  and  solid  waste \n\nOutput 2: Improvement of urban water channels and flood management.17 Output 2 \n13. \nwill  rehabilitate  or  construct  5\u22129  km  of  six  urban  water  channels  to  improve  the  urban  water \nenvironment  and  improve  urban  flood  control  to  meet  1  in  20  year  storm  water  by  \n(i) \nthe  existing  channels;  and \nthe  waterways,  slopes,  and  embankments. 18  About \n(ii) reconstructing  or  constructing \n10 maintenance  stations  will  be  constructed  along  the  channels  to  store  maintenance \nequipment and provide workstations for maintenance staff. To protect the project area from 1 in \n20  year  storm  water,  the  flood  control  capacity  of  the  existing  three  pump  stations  will  be \nincreased  and  four  new  pump  stations  constructed  along  Gaotang  Lake.  To  protect  the  area \nalong Gaotang Lake from 1 in 50 year flood from the lake, about 14.5 km of embankment will be \nconstructed. \n\nfrom \n\nTo  improve  urban  flood  management  in  Huainan,  an  urban  flood  forecasting  and \n14. \nwarning  system  will  be  procured.  An  associated  TA  will  prepare  an  urban  flood  and \nwaterlogging  management  master  plan,  including  arrangements  of  the  flood  forecasting  and \nwarning  system;  and  develop  the  capacity  of  HMG  staff for flood management, particularly for \nflood  forecasting  and  warning.  To  maintain  the  urban  water  channels  and  improve  flood \nmanagement  in  Huainan, (i)  sampling  and  monitoring equipment for  the urban water  channels \nwill  be  procured;  and  (ii)  consultants  will  be  engaged  to  (a)  pilot  community  environmental \nsupervision and flood management teams; (b) prepare a water quality and ecological monitoring \nplan for the urban water channels, and develop the capacity of HMG staff for monitoring; and (c) \nprepare an urban water channel maintenance program, and develop the capacity of HMG staff \nfor  maintenance.  Each  team  will  comprise  three  community  members,  including  at  least  a \nfemale member.  A total of  eight  community  environmental  supervision  and flood management \nteams  will  be  established  in  model  communities  that  are  seriously  affected  by  pollution  and \nfloods from the urban water channels. The teams will (i) raise the environmental awareness of \ncommunity  residents  to  eliminate  waste  dumping  into  the  urban  water  channels;  and  (ii) \ndisseminate the flood warning system to community residents. \n\n15. \nOutput 3: Improvement of urban lakes. To improve water quality and reduce pollution \nload,  artificial  wetlands  will  be  constructed  at  major  discharge  points  into  the  five  lakes. \nRevetment will be constructed for Dajiangou Wetlands, Long Lake, and Shijian Lake to prevent \nsoil  erosion  and  capture  nonpoint  source  pollution  from  around  the  lakes.  At  Gaotang  Lake, \nrevegetation  will  be  piloted  in  the  area  between  the  embankment  constructed  under  output  2 \nand  the  lake.  The  northern  pond  area  of  Long  Lake  will  be  dredged  to  remove  sludge  and \nsediment, including pollutants; and increase the storage capacity of the pond (footnote 18). \n\nTo  sustain  urban  lake  management,  (i)  sampling  and  monitoring  equipment  will  be \n16. \nprocured to monitor the lake water quality; and (ii) the consultants engaged under output 2 will \n(a)  design  the  wetlands,  select  native  plant  species  for  the  wetlands,  and  guide  the \nmanagement of artificial wetlands; (b) assist in piloting a revegetation scheme at Gaotang Lake, \nand  develop  HMG  staff  capacity  for  revegetation  around  Gaotang  Lake  after  the  project;  \n(c)  prepare  lake  zoning  plans  for  Caoling  Lake,  Dajianguo  Wetlands,  and  Long  Lake  to \nsafeguard  the  natural  and  biodiversity  values  of  the  lakes;  and  (d)  prepare  integrated  lake \nmanagement plans for Gaotang Lake and Shijian Lake. \n\n \n                                                \n17 For this project, \u201cflood\u201d includes waterlogging. \n18 Disposal  of  the  dredged  sludge  and  sediment  was  assessed  as  part  of  the  environmental  impact  assessment \n\n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fOutput  4:  Project  management  and  capacity  development.

The project will provide the HMG and implementing agencies with \nproject management  consultants  and  office  equipment.  During  project  implementation,  various \ntraining sessions, workshops, and domestic and international study tours will be conducted. The \nproject management consultants will assist the PMO in conducting these capacity development \nactivities. \n\n18. \nSpecial  features.  The  project  includes  innovative  structural  measures  such  as \nconstruction of artificial wetlands in the lakes to remove pollutants. The project complements the \nstructural measures with various nonstructural measures, including strengthening HMG capacity \nfor  flood  management,  wastewater  collection  and  treatment  planning,  and  maintenance  of  the \nimproved urban water channels. The introduction of such international best practices for urban \nwater  channel  and  lake  pollution  control  and  management,  and  flood  management  is  ADB\u2019s \nvalue  addition.  In  addition,  extensive  environmental  due  diligence  included  an  assessment  of \npotential  climate  change  impacts  and  sensitivity  analysis  of  the  capacity  of  flood  control \nstructures 19  based  on  climate  change  modeling. 20  As  a  result,  climate  change  adaptation \nmeasures  are  included  in  the  project  and  TA  for  strengthening  urban  flood  management  in \nHuainan  (para.  23). 21  The  use  of  sensitivity  analysis  to  examine  potential  climate  change \nimpacts  and  risks  of  flood  control  structures  is  a  replicable  best  practice  that  the  PRC \ngovernment can apply to future projects. \n\nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n19. \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $343.33 million (Table 1). \n\nThe  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $150  million,22 including  taxes  and  duties,23 \n20. \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year \nterm, including a grace period of 5 years; annuity repayment method with 10% discount factor; \nan  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year (the interest and other \ncharges during construction to be capitalized in the loan); and such other terms and conditions \nset forth in the draft loan and project agreements. Based on these, the average loan maturity is \n18.31 years; and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.20% per annum.  \n\n21. \nThe  financing  plan  is  in  Table  2.  The  ADB  loan  will  finance  43.7%  of  the  project  cost \n(base cost, including taxes and duties). The HMG will finance 56.3% (base cost, including taxes \nand duties; costs for land acquisition, resettlement, and environmental protection; and physical \n                                                \n19 Climate Change Impact (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Xiaotao  Cheng,  Jing  Wang,  et  al.  2008.

The  PRC  will  be  the  borrower  of  the  loan  and  will  make  the  entire \nproceeds  available  to  the  Anhui  provincial  government,  and  then  to  the  HMG.  The  loan \nproceeds made available to the Anhui provincial government and the HMG will carry the same \nterms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. The HMG will assume the foreign exchange and \ninterest rate variation risks on the ADB loan.  \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nImprovement of wastewater collection \nImprovement of urban water channels and flood management \nImprovement of urban lakes \n\n \nBase Costb \n1. \n2. \n3. \n4.

The TA is estimated to cost $625,000, of which $500,000 \nwill  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Multi-Donor  Trust  Fund25 under  the  Water  Financing \nPartnership Facility, and administered by ADB. The HMG will provide counterpart support in the \nform  of  office  accommodation,  domestic  transportation,  remuneration  and  per  diem  for \ncounterpart  staff,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  The  TA  will  prepare  an  urban  flood  and \nwaterlogging management master plan for the municipality and develop a flood forecasting and \nwarning system. The HMG will be the executing agency. The leading group established for the \nproject will provide overall guidance for TA implementation. The PMO established for the project \nwill  administer  day-to-day  TA  activities.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  from  April  2014  to  March \n2016. ADB will engage the consultants following its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, \nas amended from time  to time).  International  (13.5  person-months)  and national  (14.5  person-\nmonths) consultants will be recruited through quality- and cost-based selection at a quality\u2013cost \nweighting ratio of 80:20. \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n24. \nThe economic analysis indicates that the project is economically viable, with an overall \ninternal  rate  of  return  of  15.8%  and  an  economic  net  present  value  of \neconomic \nCNY458.8 million.  The  rates  of  return  for  the  individual  outputs  are  13.2%  for  improved \nwastewater  collection,  16.8%  for  improved  urban  water  environment  and  flood  management, \nand  12.2% for  improved  urban  lake  environment.  Sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the  project  is \ngenerally robust to potential variations in costs and benefits. The project remains economically \n\n                                                \n25  Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nviable  even  with  a  combination  of  a  benefit  decline  of  10.0%  and  a  capital  cost  increase  of \n10.0%.  In  addition,  the  actual  economic  benefits  are  likely  larger  than  estimated  as  some \nsignificant types of benefits are not quantifiable due to limited data. \n\nThe financial sustainability assessment for the nonrevenue suboutputs indicates that the \n25. \nHMG  has  sufficient  funds  to  finance  the  counterpart  contributions,  as  well  as  to  finance  debt \nservice  and  operation  and  maintenance  costs  during  operation.  Average  annual  counterpart \nfunding accounts for 1.05% of the projected HMG revenues during implementation. Annual debt \nservice  ranges  from  0.12%  of  projected  revenues  in  2019  to  0.25%  in  2024.  Annual  funds \nrequired  for  facility  operation  and  maintenance  averages  around  0.27%  of  projected  revenues \nand  0.56%  of  projected  expenditures  during  2019\u20132024.  The  financial  analysis  for  output  1 \nconfirms that it is financially feasible, with a financial internal rate of return of 3.55%  compared \nwith the weighted average cost of capital of 2.47%; the financial net present value is estimated \nto  be  CNY50.92  million.  The  financial  viability  is  generally  robust  but  is  sensitive  to  revenue \ndeclines. While the HMG will provide subsidies to cover expenses when needed, strengthening \nthe  financial  sustainability  of  wastewater  collection  facilities  through  gradual  increases  in  the \nwastewater collection tariff to full-cost recovery will be important. \n\nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n26. \nAn  assessment  of  HMG\u2019s  procurement  capacity,  including  the  PMO,  confirms  that  it, \nacting  through  a  procurement  agency  and  with  the  assistance  of  ADB  and  the  consultants, \nwould have adequate procurement capacity to facilitate full compliance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time). Specific policy requirements, capacity development, and \nother supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 24). \n\n27. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  HMG.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 24). \n\nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nThe  project  will  reduce  flood  risk  and  improve  the  urban  water  environment  for  a \n28. \npopulation of 962,000 (39.2% of the total population of Huainan), including 65,000 poor people. \nSuch  improvements  could also  benefit  the  water environment,  public  health,  and quality  of  life \nfor  urban  residents  in  Huainan,  thus  helping  to  reduce  poverty.  The  project  will  create  5,000 \ntemporary  jobs  during  implementation  and  120  permanent  jobs  during  operation  and \nmaintenance. \n\n29. \nThe  project  was  designed  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  Women\u2019s  focus  group \ndiscussions found that environmental improvements are anticipated to have a significant gender \nimpact, with reduced time burdens and costs for health care, preparation for floods, and clean-\nup  after  floods;  and  with  overall  improvement  of  living  conditions  and  the  environment.  The \ngender action plan contains activities to ensure project benefits are accrued by women at least \nas  equally  as  by  men,  including  (i)  women\u2019s  participation  in  discussions  on  detailed  designs, \nprice  hearings,  community  activities,  training,  and  project  management;  (ii)  job  offerings  to \nwomen; and (iii) inclusion of gender perspectives in capacity development of HMG staff. 26 \n\n                                                \n26 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n30. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category A). The project will acquire a total of 126 hectares \nof  land;  248  hectares  will  be  occupied  temporarily.  The  project  will  demolish  17,257  square \nmeters of housing and 780 square meters of small business shops. It will affect 2,075 people, \n1,451 of these will lose more than 10% of their productive assets and/or be physically displaced. \nThe  HMG,  with  the  assistance  of  consultants  engaged  under  the  project  preparatory  TA, \nprepared a resettlement plan in line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and related \nlaws  and  regulations  of  Huainan  Municipality,  Anhui  Province,  and  the  PRC.  The  HMG  has \nendorsed  the resettlement  plan  and  disclosed  the relevant  information to  affected  people. The \nresettlement  plan  was  also  disclosed  on  ADB  website.  The  HMG  will  fully  finance  CNY292.1 \nmillion  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  costs.  The  ADB  loan  will  finance  the  costs  for \nsemiannual  external  resettlement  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  HMG  has  experience  in \nconducting land acquisition and resettlement for foreign-funded projects and has the capacity to \nimplement the resettlement plan for this project. \n\nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).  Indigenous  peoples  will  not  be  affected  or  benefit \n\n31. \nfrom the project. \n\n32. \nEnvironment (category  A). The environmental impact assessment report prepared for \nthe project is based on the domestic environmental impact assessment report,27 as well as the \nconsultant\u2019s  report  on  the  project  preparatory  TA;  and  complies  with  the  PRC\u2019s  environmental \npolicy and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. It concludes that the project will have substantial \npositive  environmental  and  socioeconomic  benefits  resulting  from  (i)  improved  urban  water \nchannels, lakes, and Huai River; (ii) improved management of water and ecology in the  lakes; \ninclude \nand  (iii) improved \nconstruction  impacts  on  air,  noise,  and  water  quality;  solid  waste;  and  disturbance  to  some \nwater  birds.  These  will  be  prevented  or  minimized  to  acceptable  levels  through  the \nimplementation of an environmental management plan with adequate mitigation and monitoring \narrangements. The plan includes a detailed training program to ensure the HMG has adequate \ncapacity  to  manage  and  monitor  environmental  impacts  and  risks.
