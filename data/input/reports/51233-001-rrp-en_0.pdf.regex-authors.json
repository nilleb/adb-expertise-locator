THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan1 \nof up to $235,000,000 (or its equivalent in baht) to B.Grimm Power Public Company Limited \n(B.Grimm) for the ASEAN Distributed Power Project (Phase 2).2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n2.  Project identification. Demand for electricity in Thailand increased by an average of \n3.6% per year during 2005\u20132016. Total electricity consumption was 182,846 gigawatt-hours in \n2016, up 4.6% from 174,834 gigawatt-hours in 2015. As of April 2017, Thailand\u2019s installed power \ngeneration capacity was 41,393 megawatts (MW). Production of electricity depends heavily on \nfossil fuels: 60% is generated from natural gas, 10% from lignite, and 8% from coal. Although \nrenewable energy sources currently contribute only 8%, the Government of Thailand\u2019s promotion \nof alternative energy under the Alternative Energy Development Plan, 2015\u20132036 is expected to \nincrease renewable energy capacity to 19,684 MW (30% of total capacity) by 2036, with 6,000 \nMW coming from solar power and 3,002 MW from wind power.3 The plan, prepared as part of the \ngovernment\u2019s strategy to diversify the energy mix and promote renewable energy, notes the \nsignificant potential of renewable energy in Thailand and indicates that energy imports can be \navoided by developing domestic renewable energy projects with private investment. \n \n3.  Countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) face a rapid increase \nin energy demand, driven by socioeconomic factors such as rapid population growth, sustained \neconomic growth, growing urbanization, an expanding middle class population, and increased \naccess to electricity. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, \nelectricity consumption by countries in the ASEAN region will grow 8.04% per year during 2009\u2013\n2030. This poses major challenges to achieving and balancing energy policy objectives in the \nregion, including energy security, sustainable development, energy access, and affordability. \n \n4.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) identified the opportunity of providing financial \nassistance to B.Grimm through close cooperation and strong relationships built over the last ten \nyears with key players in Thailand\u2019s energy sector, with the goal of (i) implementing the Midterm \nReview of Strategy 2020 and its country operations business plan, 2017\u20132019 for Thailand, which \nemphasize support for clean energy and environmentally sustainable growth;4 and (ii) helping \nachieve the Sustainable Development Goals, which seek to substantially increase the share of \nrenewable energy in the global energy mix.5  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n5.

Borrower. B.Grimm, established in 1993 in Thailand, is an energy company that focuses \non the development, financing, construction, and operation of greenfield power plants.

Development Impacts, Outcome, and Output \n7.  Impacts. The project will contribute to: (i) regional progress ensured in increasing the \nshare of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030;6 and (ii) the energy mix diversified \nthrough  the  addition  of  alternative  energy  capacity  and  more  electricity  consumption  from \nrenewable sources.7 \n \n8.  Outcome. The outcome will be: sustained operation of private sector power projects in \nthe ASEAN region and other DMCs. \n \n9.   Output. The output will be the rollout and operation of power projects in the ASEAN region \nand other DMCs. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n10.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 (footnote 4) in promoting environmentally sustainable \ndevelopment, assisting the private sector in meeting growing energy demand in the region, and \ncapitalizing on ADB\u2019s operating strengths in infrastructure development, finance, and other areas. \nThe midterm review also supported the expansion of environment-friendly technologies for clean \nand efficient energy generation and use, as well as a larger role for private sector financing of \ninfrastructure. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategies for various ADB DMCs echo the themes of \nthe energy policy, including the promotion of environmentally sustainable economic development \nand energy security. \n \n11.  Consistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, which supports wider access to energy through investments \nin energy efficiency and renewable energy projects.8 The project will contribute to ADB\u2019s target of \n$6 billion in annual financing for climate mitigation and adaptation by 2020, and catalyze further \nprivate sector resources in the clean energy segment. \n \nD.

B.Grimm\u2019s  existing  solar  power  projects  were \ndeveloped under Thailand\u2019s Very Small Power Producer Program, which \nallows private developers to build, own, and operate power projects with a \ncapacity of up to 10 MW and enter into PPAs with PEA. \nManagement  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \nImplementation period  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \nRevenue structure  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \nMajor cost structure  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \nContractor selection  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \nOperation and maintenance  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \nPerformance monitoring  The company  will submit quarterly unaudited financial statements and \nannual audited financial statements on a consolidated basis. \nEGAT = Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand, MW = megawatt, PEA = Provincial Electricity Authority, PTT = \nPTT Public Company Limited, PPA = power purchase agreement. \nSource: B.Grimm Power Public Company Limited. \n \nF.

Value Added by ADB Assistance \n13.  ADB\u2019s assistance will support B.Grimm in the diversification and expansion of its energy \nportfolio in the ASEAN region and other DMCs. By working with a well-established energy \ncompany with a strong track record of successful execution, ADB will be able to extend its reach \nto multiple energy and renewable power projects that would be difficult to assist directly. ADB\u2019s \nassistance will play an important role not only in providing direct financing but also in attracting \nthird-party investors and establishing more confidence in B.Grimm\u2019s future access to capital \nmarkets. ADB\u2019s assistance will also ensure that B.Grimm fully adopts and implements ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental and social safeguards standards. \n \n14.  ADB\u2019s assistance will help the company establish renewable energy solutions in DMCs \nwith more challenging legal and regulatory contexts. Countries such as Cambodia, Myanmar, the \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Indonesia, and Viet Nam have only recently begun to develop \ndistributed renewable power options such as solar and wind, and new developers face multiple \ntechnical,  legal,  regulatory,  and  financing  challenges.  Through  ADB\u2019s  loan  facility  and \nconcessional finance, ADB will help demonstrate a track record of successful financing to \nencourage private sector developers to take on the higher risk associated with these projects. \n ", "4  \n \n       \n \nC.
