To address \nthis issue, in 2016, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the financing of the CAREC \nCorridors  1  and  3  Connector  Road  Project  costing  $114.35  million.2 The  project  connects  two \nmajor  CAREC  regional  corridors  by  rehabilitating  a  crucial  connector  road,  part  of  the  North\u2013\nSouth Alternate Corridor linking Balykchy with Jalal-Abad. The project will (i) improve connectivity \nand  mobility,  (ii) \nlink  economically  underprivileged  regions  with  economic  hubs,  and  \n(iii) strengthen institutional capacity. Consistent with the current project, the additional financing \nwill  rehabilitate  the  missing  sections  of  the  North\u2013South  Alternate  Corridor,  and  continue  the \nongoing efforts to strengthen institutional capacity of the Ministry of Transport and Roads (MOTR). \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nIn 2018, the government approved its medium-term development program\u2014Unity, Trust, \nCreation\u2014covering 2018\u20132022, which prioritizes construction and expansion of the network of \nhighways  and  international  transport  corridors  to  improve  connectivity. 3  The  development \nprogram  prioritizes  the  construction  of  the  North\u2013South  Alternate  Corridor.  Development  of \ntransport and road infrastructure under the CAREC  Program is a priority area identified by the \n2018\u20132022 development program. The government is focusing on rehabilitation and maintenance \nof international transport corridors to promote movement of cargo and passengers, and increase \naccess to regional economic centers. \n \n4. \nBeing a landlocked country, the Kyrgyz Republic depends heavily on road transport. The \nroad  network  caters  to  58%  of  cargo  and  78%  of  passenger  traffic.  Of  the  country\u2019s  34,000-\nkilometer (km) road network, international road corridors comprise 2,654 km. About 69% of the \ninternational corridors have been rehabilitated, with the remainder in the process of rehabilitation. \nThe government plans to expand the size of the international road corridor network to 3,248 km \nby 2025.4 Besides expanding the network, the government aims to allocate more funds for road \nmaintenance, and improve its road asset management system. \n  \n5.  \nThe  CAREC  Corridors  1  and  3 Connector  Road (connector  road)  linking Balykchy  with \nBashkugandy  forms  part  of  the  North\u2013South  Alternate  Corridor  and  will  improve  national  and \nregional  connectivity  in  the  center  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  Besides  linking  the  two  CAREC \ncorridors, it contributes to enhancing the connectivity between the southern regions (Jalal-Abad \nand Osh) and the northern regions (Chui and Issyk-Kul) through a more efficient alternative route, \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2016.

Development Program of the Kyrgyz Republic, 2018\u20132022: Unity, Trust, \n\nCreation. Bishkek. \n\n4  Road subsector-related figures sourced from Government of the Kyrgyz Republic - Ministry of Transport and Roads; \n\nand National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nimproving access to international markets.5 The project will also support the government\u2019s road \nsector reform agenda and assist the government in improving its road asset management system \n(RAMS) and road safety. \n \nThe rehabilitation  of  the  connector  road  is  consistent  with the government\u2019s  priority,  as \n6. \nstated in its medium-term strategy (footnote 3). It is also aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy (CPS) for the Kyrgyz Republic, 2018\u20132022,  and Strategy 2030; and is included in ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan for the Kyrgyz Republic, 2018\u20132020. 6 \n \n7. \nBased  on  the  government\u2019s  request,  ADB  approved  the  concept  paper  of  the  CAREC \nCorridors 1 and  3  Connector  Road Project  on 22 April  2015.7 The  concept  paper  included  the \napproval of transaction technical assistance (TA) of $1 million. In parallel, ADB approved a $3 \nmillion grant for the project design advance (PDA) financing for the CAREC Corridors 1  and 3 \nConnector  Road  Project  on  2  June  2015.  The  PDA  was  used  to  finance  a  detailed  design \nconsultant  for  ADB-financed  sections.  The  PDA  grant  agreement  was  signed  by  ADB  and  the \ngovernment  on  15  June  2015  and  became  effective on  25 January  2016. The  detailed  design \nconsultant was mobilized in February 2016. On 27 September 2016, ADB approved a loan and a \ngrant for the CAREC Corridors 1 and 3 Connector  Road Project (the current project), which is \nphase 1 of the connector road (footnote 2). The financing agreement was signed on 2 December \n2016  and  became  effective on  23  May  2017. The PDA  was integrated  into the  current  project \nwhen the financing agreement became effective. \n \n8. \nBecause of limited funding, it was not possible to finance all sections studied under the \ncurrent  project.  The  current  project  included  only  one  section  of  70  km  (Epkin  village  to \nBashkugandy village) for rehabilitation along with soft components comprising preparation and \nimplementation of the RAMS, and review of pilot performance-based maintenance contracting. \n \n9. \nThe rehabilitation of two other road sections totaling 68 km (Balykchy\u2013km marker [Km] 43 \nand Kochkor\u2013Epkin) was proposed to be considered for approval as additional financing under \nthe subsequent phase 2 of the connector road project. All project documents related to the two \nsections under phase 2 were prepared and reviewed under the transaction TA and then the PDA. \nThe PDA consultant is responsible for assisting the government in procuring the contracts and \nupdating the safeguards documents. \n \n10. \nBesides  ADB,  other  development  partners  are  supporting  the  rehabilitation  of  the \nconnector  road.  Financing  from  the  Islamic  Development  Bank  and  the  Saudi  Fund  for \nDevelopment  was  used  for  rehabilitating  24  km  of  the  Bashkugandy\u2013Kyzyl  Jyldyz  section.  A \nEurasian  Development  Bank  loan  will  rehabilitate  the  91  km  road  linking  Aral  with  CAREC \nCorridor  3.  Export-Import  Bank  of  China  is  financing  the  rehabilitation  of  250  km  of  the  Kyzyl \nJyldyz to Jalal-Abad section. Construction works are currently ongoing. \n \n11. \nImplementation status of the current project. The civil works contract for the current \nproject,  the  Epkin\u2013Bashkugandy  section,  was  awarded  in  September  2018  and  mobilization \nworks will begin in November 2018. The delay in procurement was caused by the protracted bid \n\n                                                \n5  Sector Assessment (Summary): Transport (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  ADB. 2018.

The government  will  decide  on  the use  of  loan  savings after  sufficient  physical \nprogress is achieved. The consultancy contract for the RAMS was awarded in August 2018. \n \nSafeguards  compliance.  The  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  (LARP),  updated \n12. \nbased on detailed design for the current project, was cleared and disclosed by ADB on its website \nin  July  2018.  The  government  is  committed  to  implementing  the  LARP  before  the  start  of  the \nconstruction activities on any specific road section. The initial environmental examination (IEE) \nreport,  also  updated  based  on  the  detailed  design,  was  cleared  and  disclosed  by  ADB  on  its \nwebsite in June 2018. \n \nProject performance. The current project performance rating is on track. With the award \n13. \nof  the  RAMS  consulting  contract,  the  achievement  of  contract  awards  improved.  Project \nperformance parameters\u2014delivery of outputs, compliance with safeguards policy requirements, \nand management of risks\u2014are satisfactory. Although the loan and grant were made effective in \nlate  May  2017,  the  civil  works  contract  was  awarded  in  September  2018.  Disbursement \nperformance will improve after the start of physical works. Risk mitigation measures related to \nefficient  implementation  of  the  project  include  (i)  delegation  of  the  project  to  KYRM  to  ensure \nclose and frequent monitoring of the physical progress; (ii) monthly reporting by the supervision \nengineer  of  the  construction  progress,  identifying  issues  and  solutions;  and  (iii)  periodic \nmonitoring by ADB of the key milestones to ensure that the project is completed by July 2021, as \nscheduled. \n \n14. \nEligibility of additional financing. The justification for additional financing is to scale up \nthe  project,  which is  consistent  with the  approval  of  the  current  project. The two  new  sections \nincluded  in  phase  2  are  contiguous  with  the  current  project  section.  The  project  remains \ntechnically, economically, and financially viable. The development objectives remain unchanged \nwith the additional financing. The project is accorded high priority by the government (para. 3), \nand is consistent with the CPS (para. 6). The project has a high degree of readiness. The current \nproject  is  performing  well,  as  stipulated  in  ADB\u2019s  Operations  Manual.8 As  such,  the  additional \nfinancing meets other eligibility criteria in ADB\u2019s additional financing policy. \n \n15. \n\nValue added by ADB assistance. The following features provide ADB value addition: \n(i) \n\nroad \n\nProject design and innovation. ADB\u2019s intervention initiated an innovative design \nfeature  of  combining \nroad \nrehabilitation  with  performance-based \nmaintenance by customizing ADB\u2019s existing standard bidding documents. \nInstitutional  development.  Besides  the  RAMS,  ADB  will  continue  road  safety \ninterventions intended to improve the institutional framework for conducting road \nsafety audits. \nClimate  change  resilience.  The  road  design  incorporates  climate  change \nadaptation mechanisms that will lead to enhanced climate change resilience. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nB. \n \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  enhanced  regional  and  national \n16. \nconnectivity  (footnote  3).  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  improved  efficiency  and \n\n                                                \n8  A president\u2019s waiver was sought in respect of the following: \u201cWhile projects may experience problems, these should \nhave been addressed and the project should be performing well for at least 12 months before the cross-departmental \ncirculation of the report and recommendation of the President.\u201d ADB. 2011.

The government has requested that the loan be denominated in \nUnited States dollars. \n \n20. \n \n\nThe financing plan is in Table 2. \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\nCurrenta \n\nShare of \nTotal (%) \n  \n\nAdditional Financing \nShare of \nAmount \nTotal (%) \n($ million) \n  \n  \n\n32 \n51 \n17 \n100 \n\n9.50 \n68.50 \n12.75 \n90.75 \n\n10 \n76 \n14 \n100 \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n  \n36.72 \n58.39 \n19.24 \n114.35 \n\nTotal \n\nAmount \nShare of \n($ million)  Total (%) \n\n  \n46.22 \n126.89 \n31.99 \n205.10 \n\n  \n\n22 \n62 \n16 \n100 \n\n \n\nSource \n\n \n\n \n\nAsian Development Bank  \nSpecial Funds resources (grant) \nOrdinary capital resources (loan) \nGovernment of the Kyrgyz Republic \n\n  \n\n  \n\nTotal \na  Refers to the original amount. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n21. \nThe  MOTR  will  be  the  executing  agency.  It  has  implemented  all  development  partner-\nfinanced  road  projects  in  Kyrgyz  Republic  since  1995,  and  has  accumulated  considerable \nexperience. The project implementation unit - Investment Projects Implementation Group (IPIG) \nwill be responsible for project implementation activities. Construction supervision consultants will \nbe  engaged  as  the  engineer  for  the  construction  contract.  Road  safety  consultants  will  be \nrecruited by the MOTR to provide advice on road safety reforms, road safety engineering, road \nsafety  campaign,  and  capacity  strengthening.  Additional  scope  of  the  RAMS  will  be  decided \npending the results of the current project\u2019s RAMS development. \n \n22. \nThe government requested ADB\u2019s approval for importing bitumen under the two civil works \ncontracts of phase 2 (additional financing) from the Russian Federation, a nonmember country of \nADB.  Because  of  climate  conditions  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  bitumen  required  for  construction \nshould be able to endure extreme weather conditions. Bitumen from neighboring ADB member \ncountries  often  cannot  meet  the  quality  requirements  and  is  subjected  to  unreliable  supply  of \nconsistent  quality.  Allowing  bitumen  produced  in  the  Russian  Federation  to  be  used  for  road \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nconstruction  works  would  result  in  better  quality  road  pavement  requiring  relatively  lower \nmaintenance  costs  during  operation,  compared  with  using  bitumen  from  neighboring  member \ncountries.  Therefore,  to  maximize  the  project\u2019s  development  impact,  economic  efficiency,  and \nquality  assurance,  a  waiver  to  allow  procurement  of  bitumen  from  the  Russian  Federation  is \nrequested from the ADB Board of Directors.11 \n \n23. \nThe  implementation  arrangements  have  not  changed,  as  summarized  in  Table  3  and \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual (PAM).12 The functioning of IPIG has been \nimproved as part of the MOTR\u2019s reform, as a result of which IPIG has separate units handling \ndifferent development partner projects. The proposed additional financing for phase 2 will require \nnew  civil  works  procurement  for  the  two  added  sections.  Likewise,  one  additional  supervision \nconsulting firm will need to be recruited; however, one firm can manage supervision for both phase \n2  sections.  Road  safety  components  have  been  added  to  the  additional  financing  as  per  the \nrequest of the government and the National Road Safety Conference held in 2017. The RAMS \nmay need to be expanded to include more sections of road in the country, and legislative and \ncapacity  support;  this  will  be  carried  out  either  by  a  new  firm  or  the  existing  firm.  The  same \nfinancial audit firm will carry out financial audits for the current and additional financing scope. \n \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n1 December 2018\u201331 July 2027 \n31 July 2027 \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated project \ncompletion date \nEstimated loan closing date  31 December 2027 (loan and grant closing date) \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body \n\n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii) Key implementing \nagencies \n(iv) Implementation unit \nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nMinistry of Finance, deputy minister (chair) \nHead of Public Investment Program, Technical Assistance, and Foreign Aid \nDepartment; and head of Investment Projects Implementation Division (members) \nMinistry of Transport and Roads \nInvestment Projects Implementation Group \n\nBishkek, 20 staff \nInternational competitive \nbidding using ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2015, \nas amended from time to time) \n\nRecruitment of Consulting Firm \nusing Quality- and cost-based \nselection using ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time) \n \n\nLeast-cost selection using \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  \n\nCurrent project: 1 civil works \ncontract \n \nAdditional financing: 2 civil \nworks contracts \nCurrent project:  \n1 construction supervision (301 \nperson-months) \n1 road asset management (191 \nperson-months) \n\nAdditional financing:  \n1 construction supervision (486 \nperson-months) \n1 road safety (200 person-\nmonths) \n1 RAMS (100 person-months) \nCurrent project: Financial audit \nAdditional financing: Financial \naudit \n\n$72.00 million \n \n \n$53.54 million \n\n \n$3.26 million \n \n$2.41 million \n\n \n$5.4 million \n \n$1.8 million \n \n$1.67 million \n$0.10 million \n$0.10 million \n\n                                                \n11 The ADB Board of Directors must approve the waiver by a vote representing not less than two-thirds of the total \n\nvoting power of the members of the Board. \n\n12 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fAspects \n\nArrangements \nIndividual consultants using \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time)  \n\nCurrent project: Project \nmanagement (1,080 person-\nmonths) \n2 performance-based \nmaintenance contract \nspecialists (18 person-months) \nAdditional financing: Project \nmanagement (900 person-\nmonths) \n\n$1.57 million \n \n \n$0.34 million \n \n \n$1.2 million \n\nAdvance contracting \n\nDisbursement \n\nThe following items of expenditure are being proposed for advance contracting: civil \nworks, construction supervision consultant, and RAMS consulting services.

Using \ncontemporary geometric design standards, the detailed designs have been prepared for a  two-\nlane road (four lanes in the first part of section 1 and in all the village areas) featuring 3.75-meter \n(m) traffic lanes with adjacent shoulders featuring a configuration of 0.75 m paved and 3.00 m \nunpaved. This is considered appropriate based on the forecast future traffic demand. The project \nplans  to  use  materials  recycled  from  the  existing  roadbed  as  part  of  the  fill,  including  the  old \nasphalt surfacing that could present environmental concerns if moved to off-site disposal areas. \nCivil works rehabilitation will also cover improvement of the bridges. To address concerns over \nincreased traffic volumes and operating speeds, road safety measures have been introduced into \nthe detailed design following audits by design team specialists. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n25. \nEconomic  assessment.  Economic  assessment  conducted  during  preparation  and \nprocessing of the current project included the two new sections under phase 2. This analysis is \nan extension to that conducted for the current project (footnote 2) with a focus on those sections \nto  be  rehabilitated  under  the  additional  financing  (sections  1  and  2A).  The  analysis  applied  \n(i) investment costs based on the updated detailed design and (ii) baseline traffic and the traffic \nforecast based on traffic counts conducted on those sections in June 2017. All other aspects of \nthe economic analysis remain the same. The project will lower transport costs, and increase travel \nspeeds and time savings. The project\u2019s economic evaluation was undertaken using the highway \ndevelopment  and  management  model 13  and  following  ADB's  Guidelines  for  the  Economic \nAnalysis  of  Projects. 14  The  results  indicate  that  the  project  is  economically  viable  with  an \neconomic internal rate of return of 22.8%. The high economic internal rate of return reflects high \ntraffic volumes and the poor state of the roads without the project. Sensitivity tests confirmed that \nthe project would remain viable even if the envisaged project costs increase or benefits decrease. \n\n                                                \n13 The model is a software package managed by HDMGlobal (www.hdmglobal.com). \n14 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f26. \nFinancial sustainability. The costs related to operation and maintenance of the road will \ndecrease after construction because the road condition will be improved. Besides implementation \nof the RAMS, the proposed additional financing includes introduction of a hybrid construction and \nperformance-based road maintenance contract for the Balykchy\u2013Km 43 and the Kochkor\u2013Epkin \nroad sections. This will cover routine and periodic maintenance after the construction work. After \nthe completion of the contract, the government is expected to continue the performance-based \nroad maintenance system and allocate sufficient funds from the general budget. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n27. \nInstitutional capacity. The IPIG has been implementing ADB-funded projects since 1996 \nand has delivered 11 ADB road projects with a total cost of more than $601 million. IPIG staff \nhave  adequate  knowledge  and  understanding  of,  and  experience  with,  ADB  procedures  to \nmanage the project. \n \n28. \nFinancial  management.  The  IPIG\u2019s  capacity  for  project  financial  accounting  is \nsatisfactory,  and  it  has  a  proven  track  record  with  ADB\u2019s  disbursement  procedures.  Separate \nproject  records  and  accounts  will  be  maintained.  The  project  accounts  and  related  financial \nstatements  will  be  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  national  and  international  auditing \nstandards.  The  pre-mitigation  risk  rating  assigned  to  the  project  is  substantial  based  on  the \nassessment  of  the  existing  financial  management  arrangements,  including  budgeting  and \nplanning,  accounting  and  reporting,  internal  controls,  and  functioning  of  the  accounting \ninformation system. Mitigation measures include (i) stricter monitoring of compliance with audit \nobservations,  (ii)  strengthening  of  financial  management  staffing  in  the  IPIG,  and  (iii) \nstrengthening of internal audit functions in the IPIG. Project sustainability has been identified as \na  key  risk,  and  will  be  mitigated  through  sector  reform,  implementation  of  performance-based \nroad maintenance, and the implementation of the RAMS. \n  \nProcurement.  The  project  procurement  risk  classification  is  moderate.  Besides  closer \n29. \nmonitoring by ADB, the mitigation measures include mobilization of an experienced international \nprocurement specialist to support the MOTR to assist in preparing the procurement documents \nand in bid evaluation. The invitation for bids for the additional financing sections (Balykchy\u2013Km \n43 and the Kochkor\u2013Epkin road sections) will be advertised in October 2018, and the contracts \nare  expected  to  be  awarded  by  March  2019.  In  parallel,  the  recruitment  of  the  supervision \nconsultant for the phase 2 works will also start in October 2018 and the contract is envisaged to \nbe awarded by March 2019. Advance actions in terms of finalizing the detailed design and bidding \ndocuments have been taken to ensure project implementation readiness. Recommendations of \nthe procurement risk assessment will be implemented in conjunction with the government. ADB \nwill continue to provide support to the MOTR procurement team and tender committee. \n \nThe  country  suffers  from  inadequate  road  maintenance,  and  budgetary  allocations  for \n30. \nplanned  road  maintenance  have  not  been  sufficient.  To  address  this  issue,  the  civil  works \ncontracts  for  phase  2  will  be  based  on  a  hybrid  contract  comprising  construction  works  and \nperformance-based  road  maintenance activities. The  defects  notification period  of the  contract \nwill be expanded to include a performance-based road maintenance period of 5 years. The civil \nworks contract will be based on an amended version of ADB\u2019s standard bidding documents. \n \nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \n31. \nto  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  the  MOTR.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 12). \n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nSafeguards \n\n32. \nThe  project  is  expected  to  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  through  the  stimulation  of \neconomic activities by improving the transport of goods and people and access to services. It will \nalso  benefit  local  residents  and  enterprises  by  creating  jobs  during  construction,  and reducing \ntransport cost and travel time. The project is classified as a general intervention, with no direct \npoverty  reduction  component.  The  civil  works  contract  will  require \nthat  contractors  \n(i)  comply  with  applicable  labor  laws  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  related  international  treaty \nobligations,  and  not  employ  child  labor;  (ii)  provide  safe  working  conditions  and  separate \nsanitation facilities for male  and female  workers;  (iii)  provide  equal  wages  to male and female \nworkers for work of equal value; (iv) provide employment opportunities for women; and (v) carry \nout HIV/AIDS, illicit drugs, and human trafficking prevention and awareness programs in workers\u2019 \ncampsites. The project is categorized as having some gender elements, with the following gender \nactions: (i) employing women during construction; (ii) ensuring women\u2019s participation in all project \nconsultations, as well as in road safety campaigns; and (iii) including women staff of the MOTR \nin capacity building activities relevant to the project. \n \nE. \n \n33. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009). In accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, an IEE report, including \nan  environmental  management  plan  (EMP),  has  been  prepared  for  each  project  section.  The \nupdated reports were disclosed on the ADB and MOTR websites in June 2018. The road sections \ntraverse thorough sparse residential areas and close to a few archaeological sites. In addition, \nthe Balykchy\u2013Km 43 section is an existing road located inside a rehabilitation zone of the Issyk-\nKul Biosphere Reserve, which contains Issyk-Kul Lake, a Ramsar site. The lake is 6 km away \nfrom the starting point of the road section, and thus no impacts on the lake are expected. The \nEMP provides adequate mitigation measures and a monitoring plan. Site-specific EMPs will be \ndeveloped  in  consultation  with  the  Issyk-Kul  Biosphere  Reserve  Directorate.  Impacts  from  the \nproject are expected to be mostly related to construction work and can be mitigated. The identified \nimpacts  during  the  construction  phase  include  noise,  dust,  vehicle  emissions,  vibration, \ndisturbances to rivers because of bridge rehabilitation and construction works along the rivers, \nlimited  tree  cutting,  borrow  and  quarry  sites,  impacts  from  campsites  and  material  processing \nplants, and traffic safety. Impacts during operation are likely to be insignificant and mainly related \nto an increase in noise levels and a decrease in road safety because of increased traffic. As part \nof the IEE, modeling studies for noise and vibration, and an archaeological survey (site walkover) \nwere  undertaken;  results  are  presented  in  the  IEEs  and  were  used  as  part  of  the  impact \nassessment.  The  IPIG  has  adequate  capacity  for  safeguard  management.  Public  consultation \nwas conducted in all villages during the IEE preparation. \n \nResettlement. The project is classified as category B for involuntary resettlement impacts. \n34. \nThe  census  carried  out  during  project  preparation  identified  approximately  40  affected \nhouseholds, including private agriculture plots and buildings, with 249 affected persons. Of the 40 \naffected  households,  12  households,  including  67  affected  persons,  will  experience  severe \nimpacts  on  their  livelihood,  and  16  households  with  117  members  were  found  to  belong  to \nvulnerable groups.  A  LARP  was  prepared  to mitigate  and  address  all  the  associated  losses  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and relevant national legislation. The LARP \nwas disclosed on the ADB website in July 2018. Consultations with the project stakeholders and \ndisplaced  persons  were  undertaken  during  LARP  preparation,  and  will  continue  throughout \nimplementation. A grievance redress mechanism will be put in place in accordance with the LARP \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n \n\n \n\nto  assist  affected  persons  in  resolving  grievances  and  complaints.  The  MOTR  will  submit \nsemiannual safeguards monitoring reports to ADB for review and disclosure. \n \n35. \nIndigenous peoples. There are no indigenous peoples, as defined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement, in the project area, and the project is classified as category C for indigenous \npeoples. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nProject risk is rated low. Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the \n\n36. \nrisk assessment and risk management plan.15 \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n37. \nThe  government  and  the  MOTR  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin  the  PAM  and  loan  documents.  The  government  and  the  MOTR  have  agreed  with  ADB  on \ncertain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the financing agreement. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  and  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \n\n38. \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthe loan of $68,500,000 to the Kyrgyz Republic for the additional financing of the \nCentral Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Corridors 1 and 3 Connector Road \nProject (Phase 2), from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in concessional terms, \nwith an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and \n1.5% thereafter; for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and \nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board; \nthe grant not exceeding $9,500,000  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  from  ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund)  for  the  additional  financing  of  the \nCentral Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Corridors 1 and 3 Connector Road \nProject  (Phase  2),  on  terms  and  conditions  that  are  substantially  in  accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the Board; and \nthe  proposal  in  para.  22  of  this  report  to  permit  procurement  in  a  nonmember \ncountry of ADB of goods produced in the Russian Federation. \n\n8  October 2018\n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n\n                                                \n15 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nCurrent project \nRegional and national connectivity enhanced (National Sustainable Development Strategy, 2013\u20132017)a \nOverall project \nRegional and national connectivity enhanced (Development Program of the Kyrgyz Republic, 2018\u20132022: Unity, Trust, \nCreation)b \n\nPerformance Indicators with \nTargets and Baselines \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n\nRisks \n\nResults Chain \n\nOutcome \n \nCurrent project \nEfficiency and safer \nmovement of goods and \npeople improved \n\n \n \nCurrent project \na\u2013b.
