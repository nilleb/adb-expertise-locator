It  will  support  the  development  of  an  automated \nsystem that  will  enable sharing  of  harmonized  data across systems  of  cross-border  regulatory \nagencies  (CBRAs), 1 Maldives  Ports  Limited  (MPL),  and  Maldives  Airports  Company  Limited \n(MACL).  It  will  also  allow  traders  and  other  service  providers  to  submit,  and  to  obtain  unified \nclearance of export and import documentation requirements through a single point of entry.  The \nreport  also  describes  a  TA  that  will  support  the  Government  of  Maldives  in  related  capacity \ndevelopment of various stakeholders, including on change management. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nOverview  of  the  economy.  Maldives  is  one  of  the  smallest  countries  in  Asia  and  the \nPacific by population and land area. Its estimated population of 436,330 is widely dispersed over \n188  inhabited  islands  across  an  archipelago  that  is  more  than  800  kilometers  long  and  130 \nkilometers wide. Despite its geographical challenges, Maldives has successfully developed many \nislands into high-end tourist resorts. Strong growth in the tourism  and tourism-related activities \nhelped  the  country  attain  upper  middle-income  status  in  2010.  However,  Maldives\u2019  narrow \neconomic  base,  which  is  largely  concentrated  on  tourism,  fisheries,  and  construction,  has \nconstrained its growth prospects. \n \n4. \nImportance  of international  trade.  Like  other  small  island economies,  Maldives  relies \nheavily on imports for food, fuel, and capital goods.  From 1995 to 2016 imports accounted for \nabout  60%  of  gross  domestic  product.  The  value  of  import  transactions  increased  from  about \n$268 million in 1995 to more than $2 billion in 2016. Exports, primarily of fresh fish and processed \nfish products, also increased, from $50 million in 1995 to $140 million in 2016. As a share of gross \ndomestic product, however, exports declined from about 11% to about 4% during the same period. \nSouth Asian countries, especially India and Sri Lanka, are major trading partners of Maldives. As \nsuch, improving the trade environment of Maldives and promoting digital exchange of information \namong  South  Asian  countries\u2019  customs  authorities  are  expected  to  result  in  expanded  trade \namong them. \n \n5. \nMaldives  performance in trade facilitation.  Maldives lags  on  certain  trade facilitation \nindicators and has fallen behind in several rankings despite some progress in 2016\u20132018. In the \nWorld Bank\u2019s Doing Business 2019 report, Maldives\u2019 rank slipped to 155 in terms of trading across \nborders from 152 in 2018.2 The cost of documentary compliance per export transaction is $300, \n\n                                                \n1  These  CBRAs  include  the  Ministry  of  Economic  Development  (MED);  the  Maldives  Customs  Service  (MCS);  the \nMaldives Food and Drug Authority; the Ministry of Fisheries, Marine Resources and Agriculture; and the Ministry of \nDefense. \n\n2  World Bank Group. 2018. Doing Business 2019: Training  for Reform. Washington, D.C.. \n\n\famong  the  highest  in  South  Asia,  where  the  average  is  $180.  The  cost  of  documentary \ncompliance per import transaction is $180. This is lower than the SASEC subregional average of \n$342, but much higher in comparison with Singapore ($40), one of the Asia and Pacific region\u2019s \nbenchmarks in terms of trade facilitation. While the time for documentary compliance to export \n(48 hours) and import (61 hours) is lower than the averages for South Asia (77 hours for export \nand 105 hours for import), there is still room for improvement compared with Singapore (2 hours \nfor export and 3 hours for import).  \n \nBottlenecks in trade processes. Procedural and organizational bottlenecks substantially \n6. \nhamper the efficient flow of trade transactions and increase costs for traders. These bottlenecks \ninclude (i)  paper-based processes,  which cause  delays  and are  human resource  intensive;  (ii) \nunderutilization of existing ICT systems in some CBRAs, such as the Maldives Food and Drug \nAuthority; (iii) overlapping and redundant documentary requirements, which create unnecessary \nworkloads for traders and CBRAs;3 (iv) a physical cargo inspection rate of 100%, which is both \nresource intensive and a source of delays; (v) delays in the release of cargo because of lengthy \nprocedures,  space  and  equipment  constraints  at  Mal\u00e9  commercial  harbor,  and  limited \ninfrastructure for security screening of exports at Mal\u00e9 port and airport; and (vi) other procedural \ninefficiencies within CBRAs.4 \n \n7. \nActions taken by the government. Through a presidential decree issued in September \n2015,  the  government  formed  the  National  Trade  Facilitation  Committee  (NTFC)  to  promote \ninternational  trade,  including  the  introduction  of  an  NSW. 5    The  NTFC  has  initiated  various \nmodernization  and  trade facilitation  measures,  including  (i)  online  submission  and  processing of \ncustoms  declarations,  (ii)  express  channels  to  expedite  customs  clearance,  (iii)  a  prepayment \naccount  system  and  simplified  customs  declaration  for  individuals,  and  (iv)  upgrading  of  goods \nclearance toward a paperless trading environment. In line with its Strategic Plan, 2014\u20132018,6 and \nfollowing the government\u2019s policy to lower the rate of customs duties in 2012, the Maldives Customs \nService (MCS) has shifted its focus from tax revenue collection to trade facilitation. New customs \nlegislation was also enacted to implement the World Trade Organization (WTO) Customs Valuation \nAgreement.7 \n\n \n8. \nNational  single  window  road  map.  An  NSW  is  designed  to  facilitate  and  establish  an \nefficient  international  trade  environment  by  reducing  delays  and  lowering  costs  associated  with \nclearance of goods, while maintaining the requisite controls and collection of levies, fees, duties, \n\n                                                \n3  For example, to obtain export and import licenses, traders are required to submit the same information to both the \n\nMED and the MCS. \n\n4  ADB.

The regulation was approved along with \nthe  Maldives  Customs  Act  in  2011  and  contains,  among  others,  (i)  guidelines  on  goods  importation  into  and \nexportation from Maldives; (ii) the procedure for appraising the customs value of the goods, which, as specified in \nthe WTO\u2019s Valuation Agreement, is based primarily on the goods transaction value; and (iii) the classification and \ncodification  of  goods  based  on  Harmonized  Commodity  Description  and  Coding  System  of  the  World  Customs \nOrganization (WCO). \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fin \n\nfollow \n\nand taxes,  where applicable, on imports or exports. The NSW road map8 and business process \nredesign (footnote 4) for the NSW in Maldives were prepared to help improve trading across borders. \nThe  road  map  defines  the  scope  for  business  process  redesign  of  procedures  and  data \nharmonization  among  the  five  CBRAs,  MACL,  and  MPL;  and  identifies  the  legal  framework \nrequirements and business model options for the NSW operator. The business process redesign \nprovides  the  design  for  streamlined  procedures  within  the  NSW  environment.  Maldives\u2019  NSW \ndevelopment  will \nthe  United  Nations \ninternational  standards,  as  embodied \nrecommendations.9 Following common standards is the best way to build interoperability into the \nNSW systems of Maldives and its trading partners.  \n \n9. \nThe  project  will  establish  an  NSW  in  Maldives  as  an  electronic  platform,  which  allows \nparties  involved  in  trade  and  transport  to  lodge  standardized  information  and  documents  at  a \nsingle-entry  point  to  fulfill  all  import-  and  export-related  statutory  requirements.  The  NSW  will \nprovide an efficient environment for streamlined international trade procedures between private \nsector  stakeholders  and  border  control  agencies.  This  includes  (i)  a  labor-saving  set  of \nstandardized  and  transparent  international trade procedures,  (ii) enhanced border control,  and \n(iii) more readily available data on trade flows. The establishment of the NSW is in line with the \noperational  priorities  for  trade  facilitation  under  the  SASEC  program.  The  project  will  foster \nregional  cooperation  and  integration,  strengthen  governance  and  institutional  capacity,  and \npromote the use of advanced technologies in line with the priorities of ADB Strategy 2030. \n \n10. \nValue added by Asian Development Bank assistance. The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) has been supporting Maldives in preparing and implementing trade facilitation measures \nthrough  the  conduct  of  seminars  and  studies  on  risk  management  of  customs\u2019  clearance, \naccession to the Revised Kyoto Convention,10 and the NSW system. As SASEC secretariat, ADB \norganizes the annual meetings of the SASEC customs subgroup, which discuss and plan national \nand subregional initiatives on modernizing customs administrations, among other things. ADB\u2019s \nprimary  value  addition  is  founded  on  the  sector  knowledge  gained  through  its  long-term \nengagement in trade facilitation in the SASEC countries. The government recognizes ADB\u2019s good \nrecord of translating knowledge into effective advisory and analytical inputs to the government\u2019s \npolicy  formulation.  Through  its  support  for  SASEC,  ADB  also  brings  the  added  value  of \ncomplementing  country-level  assistance  to  Maldives\u2019  trade  facilitation  efforts  with  subregional \ninitiatives. Since 2001, the ADB-supported SASEC program has provided a platform for member \ncountries  to  collectively  discuss  and  address  trade  facilitation  issues  of  subregional  concern, \nincluding those identified in the WTO\u2019s Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA).11 \n \nLessons learned. Challenges in previous NSW implementation in other countries (such \n11. \nas  India)  were  related  to  (i)  procurement  capability,  (ii)  project  management,  and  (iii)  project \nleadership. Addressing procurement and project implementation challenges is crucial since the \nNSW environment requires integration of the NSW system with multiple stakeholders and their \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2018.

TFA aims to expedite the movement, release \nand clearance of goods, to facilitate effective cooperation on trade facilitation and customs compliance issues; and \nto enhance support for capacity building for developing countries. \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fOutputs \n\nImpacts and Outcome \n\nsystems.  Experienced  project  management  is  essential  to  coordinate  execution  of  multiple \nparallel projects across different organizations. In the context of the project, supervision is also \nimportant given the project\u2019s broad scope, and the risks of misalignment with desired deliverables. \nThere  is  a  need  for  a  project  champion  to  effectively  mobilize  the  multiple  ministries  and \ngovernment agencies. Incorporating these lessons, ADB will assist the government to implement \ninstitutional reform by providing support for change management through the attached TA. \n \nB. \n \n12. \nThe project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) efficient international trade facilitation \nensured; 12  and  (ii)  faster,  cheaper,  and  more  predictable  cross-border  trade  in  the  SASEC \nsubregion achieved.13 The project will have the following outcome: efficiency in cargo clearance \nimproved.14 \n \nC. \n \n13. \nOutput 1: National single window system for international trade and reengineered \ntrade processes established. The nationwide online system that provides for all relevant parties \nto submit standardized information at a single-entry point to fulfill all import, export, and transit-\nrelated regulatory requirements will be established in two phases. In the first phase, systems of \nthe agencies which show high readiness,15 will be interfaced with the NSW system. The systems \nof  the  rest  of  the  CBRAs  will  be  connected  in  the  second  phase.  The  capacity  building  for \noperation and maintenance will be provided under the project. Business processes reengineering \nmeasures to streamline international procedures will be implemented. By project completion in \n2023, the local NSW operator will be fully responsible for operations of the NSW. \n \n14. \nOutput 2: Capacity of relevant agencies and private sector users, including women, \nto utilize the national single window developed. This output will be financed by the TA and \nincludes (i) supporting the government in finalizing the NSW framework and e-transaction bill, (ii) \ndeveloping and implementing a change management strategy, capacity development plan, and \nNSW operations manual to increase buy-in and capacity of CBRAs and other relevant agencies \nto utilize the NSW; and (iii) outreach to private sectors, including women in inner and outer atolls.  \nThe NSW Operator will also set up a helpdesk to assist NSW users. \n  \n15. \nOutput  3:  High-level  technologies  to  support  national  single  window  and  trade \nfacilitation  pilot  tested.  This  output  will  be  financed  by  the  TA  and  includes  pilot  testing  the \napplication of blockchain, a high-level technology that enables users to track shipping items and \nrecord all related documentation history on its distributed ledger without a chance of falsification. \nBlockchain has the potential to be adopted as the future operating system of the NSW system. \nAn  e-payment  gateway  platform\u2014a  component  of  the  NSW  to  be  connected  to  e-payment \nsystems\u2014functions as a hub and simplifies the processing of payment transactions for electronic \nservices.

The NTFC will oversee the project, and the NSW steering committee will monitor and \nmake major decisions regarding project implementation (Table 3). The government will designate \nthe NSW operator at the initial stage of the project. The operator can be either an existing public \nagency or a new entity and will be set up during the implementation period. \n \n20. \nthe PAM (footnote 15). \n \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nArrangements \n\nJune 2019\u2013June 2023 \n30 June 2023 \n31 December 2023 \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nEstimated loan and grant \nclosing date \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body \n(ii)  National single window \nsteering committee \n\n(iii)  Executing agency \n(iv)  Lead implementing \n\n(v)  Other implementing \n\nagency \n\nagencies \n\n(vi)  Implementation unit \nProcurement \n\n \n\nRetroactive financing  \nDisbursement \n\nNational Trade Facilitation Committee \nChair:  Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Economic Development \nMinistry of Finance, the Maldives Customs Service; the Maldives Food and Drug Authority; \nthe  Ministry  of  Fisheries,  Marine  Resources  and  Agriculture;  the  Ministry  of  Defense; \nMaldives  Ports  Limited;  Maldives  Airports  Company  Limited;  the  Maldives  Monetary \nAuthority; the National Centre for Information Technology; and the national single window \nsystem operator. \nMinistry of Finance \nMinistry of Economic Development \n\nMaldives  Customs  Service;  Maldives  Food  and  Drug  Authority;  Ministry  of  Fisheries, \nMarine Resources and Agriculture; Ministry of Defense; Maldives Ports Limited; Maldives \nAirport Company Limited; and Maldives Monetary Authority \nProject management unit in the Ministry of Economic Development (4 staff) \nDevelop, install, supply, and \nmaintain national single \nwindow software and hardware \nAutomated System for \nCustoms Data enhancement \nsoftware development \nInterfaces development in \nexisting software systems \nRecruitment of project management unit staff and related equipment \nThe  loan  and  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  following  ADB's  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed \nbetween the government and the Asian Development Bank. \n\nOpen competitive \nbidding (international \nadvertisement) \nDirect contracta \n\nRequest for \nquotation \n\n$0.15 million \n\n$8.01 million \n\n$0.24 million \n\n4 contracts \n\n1 contract \n\n1 contract \n\na  This  is  for  Automated  System  for  Customs  Data  enhancement  software  development  for  national  single  window \n\ninstallation, which is only obtainable from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nProcurement  arrangements  and  project  management  will  be  closely  monitored  and \n21. \nsupported by the relevant departments and resident missions of ADB in neighboring countries. \nProcurement  (including  consulting  services)  will  follow  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as \namended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time). Consultants to support various aspects of the project will be recruited under \nthe attached TA. \n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fIII. \n\nATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n22. \nThe  proposed  transaction  TA  attached  to  the  project  will  (i)  support  the government  to \nfinalize legal framework required for effective implementation of the NSW system, (ii) develop and \nmonitor  project  design  and  implementation  requirements,  (iii)  conduct  capacity  building  to \nimplement and operate the NSW system, and (iv) pilot test high-level technologies for sustainable \ndevelopment  of  the  NSW  system.18 The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1.1  million,  of  which  (i)  $0.5 \nmillion will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6); \nand (ii) $0.5 million will be financed on a grant basis by the High-Level Technology Fund19 and \nadministered by ADB. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of staff, office \nspace, and other in-kind contributions. The implementation period will be from June 2019 to June \n2023 and the executing agency will be the MOF. ADB will handle the administration of the TA. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \n23. \nTechnical due diligence confirmed that designs are robust and sustainable and included \na  comprehensive  review  of  the  project  feasibility  study,  system  designs,  and  cost  estimates. \nTechnical aspects of the project were appraised based on (i) rationale and relevance, benefits, \nproposed  designs,  and  ease  of  implementation  and  operations;  (ii)  a  range  of  technical \nalternatives  and  their  viability  along  with  least-cost  analysis;  (iii)  the  life  cycle  costs,  including \ncapital and operating costs, and achievable cost savings; (iv) maximization of beneficiary area \ncoverage  including  the  poor;  and (v)  optimization  of  timelines  for  implementation  through  high \nproject  readiness.  NSW  objectives  and  effectiveness  act  as  a  catalyst  toward  comprehensive \nstreamlining of procedures by CBRAs and automated processing. \n \nB. \n \n24. \nThe  analysis  was  prepared  using  a  cost\u2013benefit  analysis  approach  in  accordance  with \nADB guidelines. 20 The main project benefits are time and resource savings. Benefits arise from \nstreamlined business processes that reduce time spent on processing trade documents and their \nassociated costs, including reproduction, storage, archiving, filing, and processing. Time savings \nto  traders  and  CBRAs  are  derived  from  less  frequent  visits  to  CBRAs,  including  queueing  at \napplication  and  payment  windows.  Importers,  forwarders,  and  goods  processors  would  spend \nless time for cargo release and travel costs associated with these tasks. Benefits also derive from \nother avoided costs involving stakeholder transport and travel, and lost time to other productive \nendeavors and leisure. Reduced time and cost are also likely to increase trade volumes. \n \n25. \nEconomic  costs  are  derived  from  financial  costs  using  shadow  exchange  rate  factors. \nUsing a social discount rate of 9%, the project has a mean economic net present value of $3.57 \nmillion  and  a  mean  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  13.6%.  These  benefits,  combined  with \nunquantifiable benefits will more than  compensate for the overall cost attributed to the project. \nRisk analysis using a Monte Carlo simulation model was used to account for project risks and \nuncertainties.21 The  results  showed  a  probability  of  less  than  15%  that  the  project  would  not \nachieve the ADB standard economic opportunity cost of capital of 9%. \n\n                                                \n18  Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19  Financing partner:  Government of Japan. \n20  ADB. 2017.

The financial management risk of the project is rated substantial. \nHowever, based on the financial management assessment, MED\u2019s overall financial management \narrangements are adequate to implement the project with the proposed mitigation measures. In \naddition, the MED is already familiar with ADB\u2019s disbursement procedures since it served as the \nimplementing agency for the Inclusive Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprise Development \nProject.22 A project monitoring unit will be established under the MED. \n \n27. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MOF.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 15). The government has been informed of ADB\u2019s \npublic disclosure requirement on audited project financial statements. \n \nD. \n \nPoverty.  Overall  poverty  of  7.3%  (2009)  along  with  widening  income  inequality  and \n28. \nunemployment is still a major issue in Maldives.23 The implementation of an NSW is estimated to \ngenerate $17 million annual savings for both the government and the private sector through lower \ntransaction costs.24 These additional resources can be utilized for better provision of, and greater \naccess to, public services serving a bigger segment of the population, particularly those in the \nouter  atolls  where  poverty  incidence  is  high.  The  NSW  will  also  reduce  the  overall  costs  of \ntransactions  by  cutting  retail  prices  of  imported  staple  goods,  such  as  food  and  fuel,  thereby \nbenefiting consumers, especially low-income people. In addition, the project will strengthen and \nimprove the ease of doing business environment and facilitate private sector development, which \nare deemed crucial for employment creation and economic growth. \n \n29. \nGender. The project is categorized some gender elements. Women\u2019s participation in trade \nand other economic fields remains low in Maldives because of, among other things, geographic \ndispersion, traditions, customs, and the institutional environment. While an NSW will not address \nthis directly, it will support creating a women-friendly environment to improve their access to trade-\nrelated services. An NSW will help women traders and entrepreneurs to effectively use their time \nin managing both business and domestic responsibilities. An NSW will also espouse a gender-\nneutral  environment  since  the  CBRAs  and  the  NSW  operator  will  be  bound  by  service-level \nagreements that will require them to deliver and perform within an expected level of performance \nfor all clients regardless of gender. \n \nE. \n \n30. \ncategories are as follows.25 \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n22  ADB. 2012.
