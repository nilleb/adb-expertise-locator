The emergency assistance will help the government mitigate the \nimpact of the typhoon on poverty incidence in the Visayas, a group of islands in the center of the \ncountry.2  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE RATIONALE \n\nDescription  of  the  emergency.  Typhoon  Yolanda  hit  the  central  Philippines  on             \n\n \n3. \nThe Philippines ranks third on the United Nations Disaster Risk Index, behind the Pacific \nisland  states  of  Vanuatu  and  Tonga.  Every  year,  about  20  typhoons  hit  the  Philippines.          \nThe country also experiences floods, earthquakes, droughts, and volcanic eruptions. However, \n2013  has  been  an  exceptionally  difficult  year  for  the  Philippines.  By  the  end  of  October  2013, \nthe  Philippines  had  been  struck  by  23  typhoons  of  increasing  ferocity  and  a  7.2  magnitude \nearthquake  on  the  island  of  Bohol  on  15  October,  reportedly  killing  218  people,  displacing \n345,000,  and  causing  about  P2.25  billion  in  damage  to  property  and  infrastructure. 3  The \nfrequency and severity of these natural disasters are overstretching the administrative capacity \nand resources of both national and local governments to respond effectively.   \n \n4. \n8  November  2013.  It  reached  winds  of  315  kilometers  an  hour  with  heavy  rains,  making \nTyphoon  Yolanda  the  strongest  storm  to  make  landfall  in  the  world  in  2013.  According  to  the \nsituation  analysis  report  dated  8  November  2013  by  the  United  Nations  Office  for  the \nCoordination  of  Humanitarian  Affairs  (OCHA),  the  typhoon  made  landfall  five  times  in  the \nVisayas and once in Palawan; a storm surge was also recorded in several locations along the \neastern coastline.  OCHA reported that the storm surge created 5\u20136 meter waves that wiped out \nmost  of  the  infrastructure,  health  facilities,  schools,  basic  public  services,  homes,  and \ncommercial  buildings  in  several  coastal  towns  and  municipalities  on  the  islands  of  Samar  and \nLeyte. Tacloban, a city of more than 221,000 people in Leyte, was the most severely damaged \ncity.  The  tsunami-like  storm  surge  created  floods  about  3  meters  high  in  the  city,  destroying \nmuch of its infrastructure, homes, and other buildings.    \n \nThe  humanitarian  costs  of  Typhoon  Yolanda  are  severe.  As  of  29  November  2013,  as \n5. \nmany  as  10.9  million  people  had  been  affected  by  the  disaster,  of  which  3.8  million  are \ndisplaced  across  nine  regions  (Table  1).  Much  of  the  damage  and  loss  is  concentrated  in the \nVisayas.  Also,  as  of  29  November,  5,598  people  had  died,  26,136  were  reported  injured,  and \n1,759 were missing. The death toll is expected to increase. More than 1.1 million homes were \nreportedly  destroyed  or  damaged.  Tens  of  thousands  of  people  have  reportedly  left  their \naffected  areas  for  safer  locations,  placing  severe  pressure  on  underfunded  social  services  in \nthese other locations. Reports are increasing of traumatized children and adults without support \nservices.   \n \n\n                                                \n1   Internationally known as typhoon Haiyan. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  Government of the Philippines, National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. 2013. Situation Report \n\non the Effects of the Earthquake in Sagbayan, Bohol. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nfor \n\nthe  basis \n\nDamage  and  loss  to  property  and  infrastructure.  The  Asian  Development  Bank \n6. \n(ADB) has worked closely with the government\u2019s National Economic and Development Authority \n(NEDA), the OCHA, and other development agencies to carry out an initial damage and needs \nassessment,  which  provided \nthe  government\u2019s  Yolanda  Recovery  and \nRehabilitation Plan (YRRP). Data for the  damage and needs assessment was provided by the \nsituation reports produced by the government through the National Disaster Risk Reduction and \nManagement Council (NDRRMC) and situation reports produced by OCHA, as well as joint ADB \nand OCHA rapid assessments of Tacloban and other locations. Table 1 presents a selection of \nproperty  and  infrastructure  assessed  as  damaged  and  lost  because  of  Typhoon  Yolanda. \nEstimates  of  the  damage  and  loss  to  public  and  private  property  and  infrastructure  range \nbetween $3.0  billion  and  $4.0  billion,  but  these  are preliminary  and are  likely  to  be revised  as \nfurther assessments are carried out. Like other natural calamities of this type, more than half of \nthe  estimated  damage  and  loss  is  private  property,  especially  houses,  commercial  premises, \nfarmers\u2019 crops and livestock, and fisheries. However, damage to public property (roads, bridges, \nbasic utilities and services, and public schools) is also sizable.  \n\n \n\nTable 1: Selected Damage and Loss Indicatorsa  \n\nHumanitarian  \n Population affected \n Population  displaced \n\nInside evacuation centers \nOutside evacuation centers \n\n Number of confirmed deaths \n Number of reported injuries \n Number of reported missing persons \nDamaged or destroyed property \nHouses destroyed \nHouses damaged \nDay care centers \nPublic schools (elementary and high \nschool) \n\n(as of 29 November 2013) \nNumber of persons \n10.9 million (2.3 million families) \n3.8 million (835,379 families) \n0.2 million (48,239 families) \n3.6 million (787,140 families) \n5,598 \n26,136 \n1,759 \nUnits \n580,481 \n587,625 \n1,600 centers, serving 48,000 children, damaged \n15 of 57 divisions reporting significant damage affecting \n3,232 schools, 34,104 personnel (26,855 classrooms) with \nserving 1,007,980 children b  \n2,280 health facilities damaged including 61 hospitalsc \n \n865,305 individuals; 202,410 farm households affected  \n\nHealth facilities \nDamaged infrastructured \nAgriculture land, crops, livestock, and \nfisheries \nPower network \na  Summary Initial Disaster and Needs Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \nb  Government of the Philippines,  Department of Education. 2013.

The total economic costs will be much larger than the direct estimates \nof damage and loss to property once lost output and household incomes are realized at the end \nof 2013 and in 2014. Preliminary estimates are that Typhoon Yolanda and other recent natural \ncalamities may cut the national economic growth rate by 0.3\u20130.8 percentage points in the fourth \n\n \n\n\f3 \n \n\nquarter  of  2013  alone.4 This  is  equivalent  to  $900  million\u2013$2.5  billion  in  lost  gross  domestic \nproduct (GDP) in 2013. In 2014, the drop in the growth rate could be as high as 1 percentage \npoint.5 \n \nTyphoon Yolanda\u2019s  economic  impact  will  be  devastating to  the  affected  Visayas areas, \n8. \nwhich  rely  heavily  on  agriculture,  fisheries,  and  agro-based  industries  for  incomes  and \nemployment. While the economic impacts are difficult to project, preliminary estimates suggest \nthat  the  combined  regional  economies  of  Central  Visayas,  Eastern  Visayas,  and    Western \nVisayas\u2014which account for 12.5% of the country\u2019s GDP\u2014could shrink by 4.0%\u20138.0% in 2014. \nThe  largest  economic  contraction  will  be  in  Eastern  Visayas,  because  of  the  scale  of  the \ndamage inflicted there including the destruction of its main regional economic center, Tacloban. \nADB estimates that Eastern Visayas\u2019 economy could contract by 30.0% or more in 2014 (Figure \n1). Eastern Visayas was also the most vulnerable economy among the three affected regions, \nbecause  of  its  smaller  economic  base  and  the  dominant  role  of  agriculture  as  a  source  of \nhousehold  income.  With  average  per  capita  gross  regional  domestic  product  (GRDP)  of \nP54,236  per  year  (2012,  current  prices),  Eastern  Visayas  does  not  have  the  resources  to \novercome this disaster without substantial assistance. \n \n\nFigure 1: Potential Impact on Estimated Growth Rates in Gross Regional Domestic Product \n(annual change, %) \n\n \n \n\n  \nSource:  Asian  Development  Bank  preliminary  estimates  for  2013  and  2014.  Gross  regional  domestic  product \ngrowth rates for 2011 and 2012 from the Government of the Philippines, National Statistical Coordination Board. \n\n \n\n9. \nCentral  Visayas  and  Western  Visayas  will  slow  markedly  in  2014,  although  much  less \nthan in Eastern Visayas. Based on the impact of previous natural calamities in the region, ADB \nestimates that the economy of Western Visayas may experience a cut in its growth rate by more \nthan  half  in  2014  because  of  the  damage  to  crops  and  fisheries.  Central  Visayas  will  be  the \nleast  affected  of  the  three  regions  as  the  city  of  Cebu,  the  second-largest  metropolis  in  the \ncountry, was only slightly affected by the typhoon (Figure 1). \n \nPoverty incidence in the Visayas. The incidence of poverty in the Visayas is expected \n10. \nto surge in the immediate aftermath of the typhoon as the regional economies initially contract, \nunemployment rises, and food prices spike during the early emergency relief phase. The most \nseverely affected areas will have the largest increases in poverty incidence. ADB simulations of \nthe  impact  of  Typhoon  Yolanda  show  that  the  number  of  poor  people  below  the  poverty  line \n                                                \n4  NEDA estimates. \n5  ADB estimates.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\ncould increase by 1.5 million.6 Eastern Visayas is expected to have the largest jump in poverty \nbecause of  the magnitude  of the  damage  in the  region, the  destruction  in  public  infrastructure \nand  services,  and the  high  share  of families  that  were  vulnerable to falling  into  poverty  before \nthe typhoon. ADB estimates that the poverty rate in Eastern Visayas may increase from 41.2% \nto 55.7% (Table 2). Many families will adopt strategies to escape poverty or mitigate the risk of \nfalling into poverty, such as migrating to safer locations and relying on remittances. Thus, actual \npoverty  rates  will  be  lower  than  those  projected  in  Table  2.  Nevertheless,  the  incidence  of \npoverty  in  the  most  severely  affected  provinces  will  remain  elevated  for  some  time,  as  many \nfamilies have lost income generating assets. The poverty gap, which measures how far people \nare below the poverty line, has also increased in the severely affected areas. The implication of \nthe  larger  poverty  gap  is  that  not  only  are  there  more  people  impoverished  as  a  result  of  the \ndamage caused by Typhoon Yolanda, but it may also take some of them a long time to escape \npoverty (footnote 6).     \n\n \n\n \n\n \n35.6 \n18.9 \n9.1 \n\n41.2 / 55.7 \n34.8 / 41.5 \n31.0 / 37.3 \n\n \n2,302,752 \n3,103,702 \n2,538,327 \n\n \n3,122,377 \n3,691,407 \n2,769,273 \n\n \n39.7 / 53.8 \n33.5 / 39.9 \n35.0 / 38.2 \n\nPoverty Rate \nbefore/after \nTyphoon \nYolanda \n(%)  \n\nTable 2:  Simulations of Potential Poverty Impact  \nChange in \nNumber of \nPoor \nPersons \n(%) \n \n35.3 \n19.4 \n20.2 \n\nPoor Persons \nbefore Typhoon \nYolanda \n(number) \n \n1,720,892 \n2,317,565 \n2,101,364 \n\nPoor Persons \nafter Typhoon \nYolanda \n(number) \n \n2,328,850 \n2,766,554 \n2,526,658 \n\nGeographical area \nBy region \nEastern Visayas \nCentral Visayas \nWestern Visayas \n \nBy category  \nSeverely affected provincesa \nModerately affected provincesb \nSlightly affected provincesc \na Includes Aklan, Antique, Biliran, Capiz, Eastern Samar, Leyte, Southern Leyte, and Western Samar. \nb Includes Bohol, Catanduanes, Cebu, Iloilo, Negros Occidental, and Romblon.  \nc Includes Albay, Negros Oriental, Occidental Mindoro, Oriental Mindoro, Palawan, Siquijor, and Sorsogon. \nSource:  2009  Family  Income  and  Expenditure  Survey;  ADB  estimates.  See  Summary  Poverty  Impact  Assessment \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n \nFiscal adjustment. These economic and social costs create pressure on fiscal policy in \n11. \ntwo  ways.  First,  the  national  government  started  reallocating  budget  spending  in  November \n2013 to finance emergency relief efforts. The relief efforts are expected to continue until March \n2014.  The  national  government  has  also  allocated  spending  for  rehabilitation  of  infrastructure, \nbasic services, schools and institutions, and reconstruction of infrastructure and housing to start \nin  December  2013  or  early  2014.  The  national  government  is  also  transferring  national \ngovernment personnel to the affected areas to assist  local governments. Additional funding will \nalso  be  needed  to  scale  up  social  assistance  programs  to  assist  displaced  persons  and  the \nnewly unemployed. Overall, the additional public spending is estimated at P153 billion, of which \nP14  billion  has  been  added  to  the  2013  budget  and  P139  billion  will  be  added  to  the  2014 \nbudget. Second, the expected decline in GRDP in the affected regions will result in foregone tax \nrevenue, which ADB estimates could be as much as P8.0 billion\u2013P2.3 billion in 2013 and P5.7 \nbillion in 2014.  \n \n12. \nGovernment action and preliminary assessment of the country\u2019s capacity. Initially \nthe  breakdown  in  communication  logistics  and  damaged  infrastructure  hampered  relief \noperations  to  remote  areas  in  the  immediate  aftermath  of  the  typhoon.  However,  the \n\n                                                \n6  Poverty Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f5 \n \n\ngovernment,  including  the  NDRRMC,  armed  forces,  and  police,  responded  to  the  disaster \nthrough immediate rescue, evacuation, and relief operations that provided basic food supplies, \nwater, and medical assistance. The government also provided the public with daily information \non the impact of the typhoon on lives and property. A state of national calamity was declared on \n11  November  2013,  which  gave  the  national  government  enhanced  powers  to  work  with  local \ngovernments in the hardest hit areas.  \n\n \n13. \nAt  the  end  of  November  2013,  NEDA  finalized  the  YRRP,  which  is  expected  to  be \nendorsed  by  the  government  in  December  2013.  The  YRRP  covers  the  following  five  priority \nareas with specified broad interventions and designated agency responsibilities: (i) shelter and \nreconstruction of houses; (ii) power restoration; (iii) livelihood and employment; (iv) resettlement \nand psychosocial care; and (v) environmental protection (para. 23 and Table 3).  \n \nDevelopment  coordination.  Because  of  the  recent  successive  disasters,  Philippine \n14. \nemergency  agencies  are  stretched.  The \ninternational  community  and  nongovernment \norganizations  have  responded  quickly  to  support  the  government\u2019s  emergency  and  relief \noperations.  OCHA  activated  its  systems  and  continues  to  update  the  government  and  its \ndevelopment  partners \nrapid  assessments.  The \nTyphoon Haiyan  Action  Plan,  a  United  Nations-led  emergency  relief  initiative,  was  announced \non 9 November 2013. It aims to ensure that people with typhoon-induced needs that exceed the \nimmediate  national  response  capacity  receive  necessary  materials  and services,  and  live  in  a \nsafe  and  healthy  environment  until  reconstruction  restores  normality  and  self-reliance.            \nThe  action  plan  estimates  the  funding  requirements  to  meet  these  objectives  at  $301  million.     \nTo  support  the  ongoing  relief  and  recovery  operations  in  the  areas  affected  by  Typhoon \nYolanda,  43  international  donors  have  pledged  or  have  already  sent  assistance.  Private \nfoundations,  both  domestic  and  international,  have  also  contributed  substantial  amounts  for \nrelief support to victims. 7 \n\nreports  based  on \n\nthrough  situation \n\n \nADB\u2019s  response  to  Typhoon  Yolanda  included  the  immediate  creation  of  the  Typhoon \n15. \nYolanda  Response  Team  and  three  financing  facilities:  (i)  a  $3  million  grant  from  the  Asia \nPacific  Disaster  Response  Fund  was  disbursed  on  14  November,  just  days  after  the  typhoon;  \n(ii) a $20 million special grant from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, which is expected to \nbe submitted to the ADB Board of Directors for consideration in mid-December, will help rebuild \nlivelihoods  of  affected  persons  and  families  in  Eastern  Visayas;  and  (iii)  the  proposed  $500 \nmillion EAL will support post-disaster efforts led by the government. ADB also has ongoing and \nplanned  interventions  in  the  affected  areas.  ADB\u2019s  conditional  cash  transfer  project  partially \nfunds  200,000  households  in  the  affected  areas,  including  at  least  69,000  families  in  the \nseverely affected areas.8 \n\n \n16. \nStructure and modality of ADB\u2019s emergency assistance loan. The EAL is an integral \npart  of  ADB\u2019s  commitment  to  the  Government  of  the  Philippines  to  support  recovery  from \nTyphoon  Yolanda.  The  government  was  initially  targeting  a  national  budget  deficit  of  2.0%  of \nGDP  in  2013  and  2014.  As  the  public  spending  needs  arising  from  the  calamity  will  require \nadditional financing of around P153 billion, the deficit is likely to rise above the targets for 2013 \nand  2014.  The  government  has  asked  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  to  provide  support  to  fill  the \nadditional financing gap.  \n\n                                                \n7  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8   ADB.  2010.

An EAL was selected as the modality \nbased  on  three  factors: 9 (i)  quick-disbursing  support  is  appropriate  because  of  the  urgency  of \nthe humanitarian situation in the Visayas and the need to mitigate the immediate economic and \nsocial impacts; (ii) international studies show that the speed of aid is critical in lifting victims out \nof  extreme  poverty  on  a  sustainable  basis  through  timely  and  high-quality  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction  of  public  and  private  assets,  and  restoration  of  livelihood  activities;  and              \n(iii) directing funds through government channels enables the government to take ownership of \nthe emergency response and initiatives.10   \n\n \n18. \nThe use of the EAL to support the government\u2019s fiscal response to mitigate the adverse \neconomic and social conditions in the Visayas is consistent with ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency \nAssistance  Policy  (2004).  The  policy  stresses  that  EALs  are  designed  to  help  rebuild  high-\npriority  physical  assets  and  restore  economic,  social,  and  governance  activities  after \nemergencies, rather than comprehensive reconstruction.  \n\n \n19. \nIn  structuring  the  EAL  for  the  Philippines,  lessons  were  taken  from  previous  EALs.  In \nparticular,  coursing  the  assistance  through  the  government\u2019s  budget  is  important  to  ensure \ngovernment ownership of the recovery agenda. Also, governments often divert resources from \nother purposes and unaffected areas to initiate rehabilitation programs. This can undermine the \ngovernment\u2019s poverty reduction programs in other areas.  Given the urgency of the crisis in the \nVisayas and the need to meet critical expenditures, the EAL will be coursed through the national \nbudget to help finance (i) essential livelihood and economic expenditures linked to the disaster \nthrough  the  proposed  YRRP,  and  (ii)  other  essential  disaster-related  expenditures  under  the \ngovernment\u2019s  2014  public  expenditure  program.  The  EAL  and  the  World  Bank\u2019s  proposed \nemergency  loan  are  closely  aligned  with  the  purpose  of  funding  the  increased  government \nfinancing gap.   \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE LOAN \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nA. \n \nThe impact will be revitalized regional economies in the Visayas. This will be measured \n20. \nby  the  recovery  in  GRDP  growth  rates  (adjusted  for  inflation)  to  pre-Typhoon  Yolanda  levels. \nThe  outcome  will  be  mitigated  adverse  social  impact  of  the  typhoon  on  the  poor.  This  will  be \nmeasured by the recovery in the per capita consumption level of the poorest 50% of households \nin the affected areas towards pre-typhoon levels.  \n \nB. \n \nThe  EAL  will  provide  $500  million  in  immediate  short-term  financial  support  to  the \n21. \ngovernment  to  meet  its  additional  financing  gap  linked  to  new  spending  initiatives  under  the \nYRRP and other disaster-related public expenditures. \n \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                \n9  For  similar  design  to  the  proposed  EAL,  see  ADB.  2008.

In  formulating  the \nYRRP,  ADB  and  other  development  partners  collaborated  closely  with  the  government  by \nproviding NEDA with staff technical expertise. ADB staff also worked with OCHA on joint rapid \nneeds assessment missions to the affected areas in November 2013. \n \nTable 3 presents the key features and immediate activities of the YRRP. The YRRP will \n23. \nbe  implemented  from  December  2013  to  December  2017.  The  YRRP  will  provide  immediate \nhumanitarian  needs  to  victims  from  December  2013  to  March  2014.  The  short-term  recovery \nand  rehabilitation  of  affected  areas,  housing,  and  livelihoods,  as  well  as  provision  of  social \nassistance and care will commence in December 2013 and be completed by December 2014. \nFrom January 2015 to December 2017, the government will focus on larger and more complex \nreconstruction  investments.  The  government  will  formulate  interventions  for  this  later  phase \nafter further assessments have been completed in 2014. The EAL will support the restoration of \nthe local economies and the livelihoods of affected persons.  \n \n\nTable 3: Yolanda Recovery and Rehabilitation Plan \n\nComponents \n1.

The  EAL\u2019s objective is  to  provide  immediate  and flexible financing  to  support  the \ngovernment\u2019s  response  to  these  urgent  needs.  The  projected  financing  gap  for  2014  is  P274 \nbillion.  However,  this  financing  gap,  along  with  the  financing  gap  for  2013  are  expected  to \nincrease by a total of P153 billion (Table 4). The EAL will help finance the additional financing \ngap  in  the  national  government  budget  arising  from  increased  public  spending  linked  to  the \nYRRP. \n \n25. \nA special feature of the EAL is the monitoring framework and reporting mechanism that \nwill be built into the YRRP. Implementation of the YRRP will be outcome-driven and will include \na rigorous monitoring and evaluation framework, with specified performance indicators linked to \nthe YRRP activities. The monitoring framework will be finalized  in December 2013. The EAL\u2019s \nmechanism  will  draw  on  the  YRRP\u2019s  framework  and  will  comprise  three  parts:  (i)  a  NEDA-led \ninteragency coordination committee for formulating the YRRP and monitoring and reporting on \nimplementation,  (ii)  the  use  of  country  public  financial  management  (PFM)  systems  for \nmonitoring  budgetary  disbursements  and  implementation,  and  (iii)  the  use  of  civil  society \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\norganization  (CSO)  mechanisms  for  monitoring  and  evaluating  impact  of  selected  projects \nunder the YRRP.  \n \n26. \nADB has approved a small scale TA to support the formulation of YRRP. In addition, it \nplans to process another TA that will help the Government, among others, set up a monitoring \nsystem to track the implementation of YRRP. ADB also plans to establish an extended mission \nin one of the  affected  areas to support  implementation  of  ADB's  assistance.  All  these  sources \nwill  be  utilized  to monitor  the  overall  implementation  of  YRRP.  Further,  since  the  Government \nwill  be  drawing  down  on  the  loan  proceeds  to  match  the  financing  needs  of  YRRP,  staff  will \nwork  closely  with the  Government  on monitoring  the  different  components (Table 3)  of  YRRP. \nThe  government  (through  NEDA-led  coordination  committee)  will  work  with  ADB  and  other \ndevelopment  agencies  to  report  on  YRPP  implementation  and  outcomes  on  a  quarterly  basis. \nAs much as possible, sex disaggregated data will be collected on coverage related to housing \nconstruction  and  new  settlements  as  well  as  livelihood  restoration  programs.  ADB  will  also \ncoordinate monitoring with key CSOs. The stand-alone TA for monitoring YRRP implementation \nwill also engage a CSO to carry out monitoring and evaluation of selected activities of the YRRP \nin severely affected areas.  \n \n27.  While  the  EAL  will  finance  imports  necessary  for  recovery,  it  will  not  finance  a  list  of \nimports  identified for  that  purpose. Instead,  the EAL will  finance general  imports  in connection \nwith the recovery, except those on the list of ineligible items.11 \n \nC. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\nTable 4:  Financing Plan for National Government Budget (P million) \n\n2014 Budget Financing Requirements \nNet financing requirement  \nGross foreign borrowingsb \nLess amortization \nNet foreign borrowings \n \n\nGross domestic borrowings \nLess amortization \nNet domestic borrowings \n\n \n \n\nProjected 2013 \nBudget \n299,846a \n104,340c \n107,782 \n(3,442) \n \n\n \n \n\n630,691 \n327,403 \n303,288 \n153,000 e  \n14,000 \n139,000 \n \n \n21,750 \n   1,000 f \n21,750 \nTBD \n\nApproved 2014 \nBudget \n\n274,110 \n95,030d \n89,994 \n5,036 \n \n620,011 \n350,937 \n269,074 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nAdditional financing requirement linked to the typhoon    \n\n2013 national government budget supplement \n2014 national government budget supplement \n \nOf which funding source: \n ADB emergency assistance loan                                                                    \n ADB JFPR grant and Asia Pacific Disaster Response    Fund \n World Bank emergency loan \n\n      Others (Gross domestic borrowings and government Savings           \n( ) = negative,  ADB = Asian Development Bank, JFPR = Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, TBD =  to be determined. \na  The projected 2013 net financing requirements as of mid-2013 before Typhoon Yolanda. \nb  Includes overseas development assistance (both program and projects) and overseas commercial borrowings and \n\nbonds \n\nc   Includes ADB\u2019s proposed Local Government Finance and Fiscal Decentralization Reform Program of $250 million \n\nand the World Bank\u2019s development policy loan 2 of $300 million \n\nd  Includes ADB\u2019s proposed Increasing Competitiveness for Inclusive Growth Program, subprogram 2 of $200 million. \nFinancing for 2014 also includes project disbursement of both the World Bank and ADB\u2019s proposed community-\ndriven development projects.  \n\ne  Preliminary figure and is subject to change with the final endorsement of the YRRP. \n\n                                                \n11 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f9 \n \n\nf  The  proposed  JFPR  grant  is  for  $20  million.

The EAL will have a 32-year term, including a \ngrace period of 8 years, custom tailored repayment method, an annual interest rate determined \nin  accordance  with  ADB's  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment  fee  of  0.15%  per  year,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in the  draft \nloan agreement.  Based on this, the average loan maturity is 19 years and the maturity premium \npayable  to  ADB  is  0.20%  per  annum.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full \nexchange  cost  (excluding  local  taxes  and  duties)  of  items  necessary  for  the  recovery  that  are \nproduced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports \nfinanced  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  Since  disbursement  of  the  loan  proceeds \nwill  be  similar  to  program  loans,  disbursement  and  audit  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  the \nprovisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements  for \nProgram Loans.12 The proceeds of the EAL will be disbursed to the Philippines as the borrower. \n \nD. \n \nThe Department of Finance will be the executing agency. The proceeds of the EAL will \n29. \nbe released upon effectiveness and withdrawn based on financing needs under the YRRP.

The \ngovernment  with  development  partner  support,  has  developed  and  is  implementing  a \ncomprehensive  and  coherent  suite  of  PFM  reforms  to  strengthen  PFM  systems,  promote \ntransparency and accountability, and address corruption. In 2011, the government launched its \nPFM  reform  road  map,  2011\u20132016,  covering  budget  reporting  and  performance  management, \ngovernment  integrated financial  management  information  system, Treasury  cash  management \noperations,  and  accounting  and  auditing  reforms.  In  January  2012,  the  government  launched \nthe  Good  Governance  and  Anti-Corruption  Plan,  2012\u20132016  to  improve  transparency, \naccountability,  and  citizen  engagement.  The  plan  includes  several  PFM  initiatives,  including \nzero-based  budgeting,  enhanced  CSO  participation  in  budgeting,  more  comprehensive \ninformation on funds disbursement by legislators, and publication of a statement of fiscal risks. \nADB  has  provided  substantial  support  to  PFM  reforms,  including  most  recently  on  public  debt \nmanagement, establishing a treasury single account, and local governance budget and finance \nreform.  Pre-mitigation  PFM  risk  is  assessed  as  substantial,  however  the  government  has  in \nplace a wide-ranging PFM reform program with indications of initial positive impacts. 13 \n \n31. \nwith the government. \n \nB. \n \n32. \nThe incidence of poverty in the severely affected areas is expected to surge as a result \nof  the  economic  and  social  costs  of  Typhoon  Yolanda.

The EAL has four main risks that are rated low to medium: (i) further natural disasters \nand  their  adverse  impact  on  regional  economies  may  undermine  implementation  of  the  YRRP \nand increase poverty rates; (ii) the government\u2019s administrative capacity and resources may be \nstretched, thereby limiting implementation of its YRRP; (iii) weak interagency coordination may \nundermine relief  and recovery  efforts;  and  (iv)  corruption  may  increase  in  the  disbursement of \nfunds  to  local  governments.  The  risk  of  corruption  has  been  observed  in  disaster-related \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction  plans  in  other  countries.  Mitigating  measures  will  address \nthese  risks  (footnote  13).  The  NEDA-led  interagency  coordination  committee  will  strengthen \ncoordination among agencies and development partners in implementing the YRRP. The YRRP \nwill  also  include  a rigorous monitoring, reporting,  and  evaluation framework.  Also,  recent  PFM \nreforms have helped improve transparency and accountability in the budget system.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n35. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting services,  and  disbursement as described in detail  in the loan \nagreement.
