Sungas LLC and Sungas Ltd. are collectively one \nentity (Sungas). \n  \nClassification  Targeting classification: General intervention \n \nSector (subsectors): Energy (conventional energy, energy sector \n \ndevelopment) \nTheme  (subthemes):  Environmental  sustainability  (urban \nenvironmental  improvement),  economic  growth  (promoting \neconomic  efficiency  and  enabling  business  environment, \nwidening access to markets and economic opportunities), private \nsector development (private sector investment) \nLocation impact:  Rural (low), urban (high), national (high), regional \n(low) \n  \nEnvironmental and  Environment:      B \nSocial Safeguards  Involuntary resettlement:  C \nClassification  Indigenous peoples:    C \n  \nProject Description  The project will develop a nationwide LPG storage and distribution \nnetwork  in  Afghanistan.  LPG  is  the  only  practical  and  feasible \nsubstitute for firewood and animal dung as a primary fuel source.  \nIncreased LPG consumption improves the environment, improves \nliving conditions, and accelerates economic growth through more \nefficient use of, and enhanced access to, energy for households \nand small businesses. \n \nThe project imports LPG directly from refineries in Turkmenistan \nand  Uzbekistan,  and  delivers  LPG  to  consumer  households \nthrough  an  efficient  supply  chain  with  no  intermediaries.  The \nproject provides the following deliverables to consumer household \nbeneficiaries: \n \nEnvironmental. Compared with solid fuels currently used in many \nhouseholds,  LPG  reduces  ambient  air  pollution  in  cities  and \nreduces harmful fumes within households. \n \nSafety. The project will contribute to reducing death and accidents \ncaused by illegal products and inexperienced distributors. \n \nEnergy. LPG has a higher calorific value, is more efficient to burn \nthan solid fuels, and provides long-run cost savings to consumers.  \nIt is more diverse as it can be used in applications other than just \nopen combustion. \n ", "ii   \nEconomic. Households using LPG are more productive, especially \nwomen and children, enabling more time for studying and working; \nfamily  productivity  increases.  Small  businesses  benefit  from  a \nreliable and uninterrupted fuel supply without the burden of using \ntheir own employees or family members to collect firewood. \n  \nImpact,  Outcome,  and  Impacts. Improved access to modern energy sources facilitating \nBenefits  economic growth and well-being, decreased use of traditional solid \nfuels for energy, private sector investment in Afghanistan's energy \ninfrastructure. \n \nOutcome. Increased retail supply of affordable, high quality LPG in \na safe and reliable manner with an additional 230,000 households \nswitching from traditional solid fuels to LPG by 2019. \n \nBenefits. Higher and more dispersed availability of LPG, lower \nexposure to local pollutants such as suspended particulate matter, \na safer and more reliable energy supply system as opposed to the \nexisting gray market system (which is unsafe and unreliable), and \nalleviation of energy poverty in the country. \n \nThe  project's  direct  benefits  include  the  provision  of  clean, \naffordable, reliable energy to households and small businesses, \nand the creation of 340 jobs by 2014.   \n \nThe  project  significantly  benefits  women  and  children,  who  are \noften the more vulnerable to the adverse health impacts of solid \nfuel smoke and suspended particulate matter emissions. Women \nand children further benefit by no longer having to spend time \ncollecting firewood, and instead have time to pursue education and \nother  activities  that  contribute  to  household  productivity  and \nincome. Small businesses also receive direct benefits by reducing \nharmful  smoke  and  particulates  in  the  workplace,  increasing \nworker safety and productivity. \n   \nBorrower/Project  The  sponsors  are  three  well-regarded  non-resident  Afghan \nSponsors  businessmen,  each  with  a  long  history  of  establishing  and \noperating  successful  businesses  in  petroleum  products  and \nconsumer  goods  packaging  and  distribution.  Each  has \ndemonstrated the ability to operate successfully in the challenging \nbusiness environment of Afghanistan. \n   \nInvestment Cost and  The company is planning to invest a total of $58.2 million through \nFinancing Plan  2019 to build LPG refilling centers in five Afghan cities and to \nacquire additional LPG fuel cylinders for distribution to consumers. \nADB is seeking Board approval to subscribe up to $8 million in \ncompany  preference  shares.  In  addition  to  paid-in  capital,  the \ncompany will plough back cash flow from operations and raise \nshort-term debt from local relationship banks to fund its capital \nexpenditure program. \n  \n   ", "  iii\nProposed ADB  An equity investment of up to $8,000,000 from the ordinary capital \nAssistance  resources  of  ADB  to  stimulate  the  capital  investment  and \ndevelopment  objectives  of  the  company,  with  the  intention  of \nexiting the investment by 2019 through either a share sale, put \noption, or call option, under such terms and conditions as have \nbeen approved by ADB's Investment Committee. \n  \nImplementation  Sungas Ltd. began implementing its business plan as originally \nArrangements  envisioned and has completed the construction and commissioning \nof two bulk storage facilities and one refilling center, with another \nrefilling center to be fully commissioned by 2010. ADB's investment \nand  the  company's  other  financing  sources  will  fund  three \nadditional  refilling  centers  and  the  purchase  of  LPG  cylinders.  \nConstruction  is  being  performed  by  Sungas  Ltd.  using  local \ncontractors and imported LPG equipment, vessels, and piping.   \n   \nRisks and Mitigating  Any  investment  in  Afghanistan  is  at  risk  of  being  negatively \nMeasures  affected  by  the  challenging  political  and  security  environment.  \nHowever, the risks are mitigated by the sponsors' experience in the \ncountry  and  the  project's  ability  to  scale  up  or  down  with  the \nmarket.  The development impact outweighs the risks. \n \nRealization of benefits from the project relies on a sustained or \nimproved security situation, relative macroeconomic stability, and a \ncontinued pro-business policy environment. Specific project-related \nrisks include: \n(i)  market risk, \n(ii)  product quality and safety, \n(iii)  sponsor, management and reputational risk, \n(iv)  regulatory and political risk, \n(v)  foreign exchange and price risk, \n(vi)  security risk, \n(vii)  insurance availability,  \n(viii)  ADB influence over strategy and direction, and  \n(ix)  exit risk \n  \nJustification / ADB  The  investment  stimulates  the  expansion  of  a  company  that \nValue-Added  demonstrates  adherence  to  business  ethics  and  international \nsafety standards. The rationale for the timing and the amount of \ninvestment is to enable the company to achieve its franchising \nstrategy by installing LPG distribution capacity in locations where \ndistributor demand is highest, thus increasing the supply of safe \nand  reliable  LPG  to  household  users.  ADB's  support  of  this \nexpansion  will  encourage  commercial  lenders,  international \ninvestors,  and  aid  agencies  to  support  broader  private  sector \ndevelopment in a wider range of industries in Afghanistan. ADB's \nassistance provides capital to the company at a critical time in the \nbusiness plan rollout, thereby supporting the generation of brand \nawareness,  construction  of  infrastructure  and  facilities,  and \nexpansion of retail sales channels.   \n \n ", "", "    \n \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nequity investment in Sungas Limited Liability Corporation (Sungas LLC) of up to $8,000,000 or \n25%  of  the  company's  total  paid-in  share  capital,  whichever  is  less.  Sungas  LLC,  is  the \nDelaware, United States, registered holding company of Sungas Limited (Sungas Ltd.), which is \na distributor of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \nA.  Project Identification and Selection \n2.  The sponsors first approached Asian Development Bank (ADB) in July 2005 to invite its \nparticipation  in  the  expansion  of  Sungas's  nationwide  LPG  storage  and  distribution \ninfrastructure. After a series of meetings in November 2005 and a site visit by the project team \nto Afghanistan in December 2005, Sungas submitted its business plan to ADB in late 2005, with \na request for financing. The project received concept clearance on 20 March 2006, and due \ndiligence  missions  were  conducted  in  April  and  September  2006.  Complex  financial  and \ncorporate structuring has continued since 2007, with Sungas now in a position for ADB to \nsubscribe to shares. Given the nature and location of the project, it was subjected to very \nrigorous due diligence and structuring. The rationale for ADB's participation in the project is to \nsupport Afghanistan's growth by catalyzing private sector development and facilitating access to \nmodern energy sources. LPG is clean and safe. It has the least demanding infrastructure \nrequirements of the energy alternatives and has the potential to dramatically improve living \nconditions for the poor. \n \n3.  Modern  energy  is  a  prerequisite  for  development.  According  to  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP),1 access to greater quality and quantity of energy is essential \nfor the poor to make the transition from subsistence livelihoods to improved productivity, income \ngeneration, and living standards. Services enabled by modern energy (such as heat, light, \nmotive  power,  and  refrigeration)  are  pivotal  contributors  to  human  welfare  and  economic \ndevelopment. Studies link access to modern energy to improved human welfare as measured \nby  the  human  development  index  (HDI).2  Afghanistan  ranks  173rrd  out  of  178  surveyed \ncountries in the HDI.3 Kabul energy consumption data4 indicate that over 60% of Afghanistan's \nenergy  consumption  is  provided  by  firewood.  For  the  poorest  people  and countries, small \nincremental increases in access to modern energy lead to dramatic gains in the HDI. \n \n4.  Providing  the  poor  with  access  to  clean,  affordable  modern  energy  improves \nproductivity, education, health, and gender equality. Access to modern energy frees the poor, \nespecially  women  and  girls,  from  the  drudgery  of  collecting  firewood,  thus  expanding \nopportunities for schooling and after-school study. Use of clean modern energy also reduces \n                                                 \n1  Source:  UNDP website. \n2  The  HDI  is  an  indicator  that  measures  a  country's  relative  development  and  represents  measures  of  life \nexpectancy, literacy, educational attainment, standard of living, and GDP per capita for countries worldwide. UNDP \nuses the HDI as an indicator of opportunities, inter alia, for education, health care, income, and employment. \n3  UNDP.  2004.  Afghanistan National Human Development Report 2004.  Kabul.

Shifting  to  cleaner-burning  LPG  reduces  carbon \nemissions significantly compared with the burning of biomass. \n \n5.  While natural gas supplied by pipeline is typically more economical in the long run than \nLPG  transported  by  tanker  trucks,  the  absence  of  a  nationwide  pipeline  network  and  the \nprohibitive construction costs for pipelines over long distances in the near term imply that \nachieving a wide distribution of LPG will rely on road-based transportation. According to the \nWorld Bank, a natural gas pipeline to Kabul from the north and the use of unconfirmed domestic \nnatural  gas  in  the  south  are  not yet  viable  or  cost-effective.5    Considering  these  factors, \nSungas\u2019s capital investments can be easily scaled according to market conditions, i.e., trucks \nand cylinders can be added or scaled back more readily and at a lower cost than permanently \ninstalled piping from terminals to distribution centers. \n \n6.  LPG offers an attainable-cost solution to consumers using firewood and other cheaper \nalternatives, who are typically not in a position to pay for switching to piped natural gas because \nof high initial conversion costs. Even in higher-income, gas-rich countries, for example in Latin \nAmerica, the urban poor continue to use LPG, although it has a higher price per energy unit \nthan natural gas, because they cannot afford the connection to the natural gas pipeline system. \n \nB.  Sector Background \n1.  Liquefied Petroleum Gas Market Demand \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n7.  The three major fuels in the energy basket of Afghanistan's households are firewood \n(35%), animal dung (19%), and vegetation brush (18%). The share of LPG in the total energy \ndemand by Afghanistan's households stands at 9%. The bulk of LPG use in Afghanistan is for \ndomestic cooking, and secondarily for lighting and winter heating, with many households that \nuse LPG for cooking continuing to use firewood for heating. Use of LPG is greater among urban \nhouseholds, whose share in energy consumption is 33%, compared to 2% for rural households. \n \n8.  An independent market consultant,6 commissioned to validate Sungas\u2019s market strategy, \nrevealed that in only 6 of 34 provinces (Balkh, Herat, Jawzjan, Kabul, Mazar-e-Sharif, Nimroz, \nand Panjsher) do a significant number of households use LPG for any or all of the three uses, \nnamely cooking, heating, and lighting. Low LPG usage rates are found in five other provinces \n(Baghlan, Kandhar, Kapisa, Kunduz, and Takhar). In rural provinces like Bamyan, Daikindi, \nFarah,  Ghor,  Kunarha,  Laghman,  Nuristan,  Paktika,  Sar-i-poul,  and  Zabul,  almost  no \nhouseholds use LPG for all or any of the three uses. Kabul alone accounts for more than half of \nthe country\u2019s total consumption of LPG, while the combined consumption of Kabul, Mazar-e-\nSharif, and Herat accounts for a majority. \n \n9.  Residential LPG use in Kabul, as a proportion of total fuel use, is presently estimated at \nonly 18% (Table 1), suggesting significant potential demand for LPG in the residential urban \nmarket.  Kabul's  non-LPG  urban  consumers  exhibit  similar  consumption  patterns  to  rural \nhouseholds, resorting to heavy biomass consumption because of the lack of access to other \nfuels, economic factors, and tradition.

Forecasted Demand Growth \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n10.  Higher income growth  in the coming years will not only add more LPG-consuming \nhouseholds, but it will also increase the consumption of LPG in existing households. Income \nelasticity, estimated by an independent market consultant, implies that demand for LPG could \nrise faster than increases in gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, which is consistent with \nincome elasticity of demand in other developing countries such as India, Pakistan, and People's \nRepublic of China (footnote 6). GDP growth has averaged 7.5% per year.7 \n \n11.  Demand varies  by city and state, taking into account population growth, household size, \nGDP per capita growth, position on the energy ladder8, and LPG availability. A detailed scenario \nanalysis suggests that rapid growth is likely with total LPG demand increasing many times over \nthe next 10 years. This trend is consistent with other countries that have transitioned from \ngathered biomass fuels to LPG, such as Turkey, India, and Pakistan.   \n \n3.  Supply and Competition \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2009. Asian Development Outlook 2009: Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Manila. \n8  The energy ladder is a concept that describes what sources of energy are chosen by individuals according to their \nper capita income (buying power). As individuals and households improve their income and increase their buying \npower, they tend to choose cleaner and safer fuels. \n ", "4   \n12.  As there is no domestic production of LPG in Afghanistan, demand is met through \nimports. The supply chain is composed of a number of importers, wholesalers, and unorganized \nretailers. Besides the government, which imports for its own use and limited retail operations, a \nsmall number of importers buy bulk LPG9 from refineries in either Turkmenistan or Uzbekistan, \nimport the LPG in railcars or tanker trucks, and offload it to LPG tanker trucks for transportation \nto  independent  distributors  at  wholesale  prices.  The  distributors  repackage  the  LPG  into \ncylinders, which are sold to end-users by individual retailers in the main cities and trading \ncenters. \n \n13.  The  threat  of  new  market  entrants  in  direct  competition  with  Sungas  does  exist; \nhowever, there are a number of barriers that prevent supply-side overcrowding. The most \nsignificant barrier is the difficulty in establishing supply chain and procurement relationships with \nthe most economical sources of LPG available to Afghanistan, and these relationships take time \nto establish. Other significant barriers to entry include the cost of bulk storage facilities and \nassociated  LPG  unloading  equipment,  and  obtaining  Afghanistan  regulatory  approvals  for \nimport licensing and facility construction. \n \n14.  There  is  a  substantial  quantity  of  illegal10  or  under-invoiced  supplies  of  LPG  in \nAfghanistan, whose pricing could disrupt the company's market penetration. These gray market \nsuppliers, however, do not offer a consistent product or safe storage and refilling of LPG.  \nBased on data when the independent market study was conducted in 2007, total imports in \n2005 amounted to just 16,190 tons, whereas the total estimated LPG usage in Afghanistan for \nthat year was approximately 150,000 tons. The independent market consultant suggested that \nthis  difference  is  explained  by  inadequate  statistical  reporting  systems,  under-invoicing  of \nimports, and illegal imports.   \n \n15.  Consumer demand exceeds Sungas's current supply capacity as many LPG consumers \nperceive their existing suppliers as being unreliable and providing an inconsistent and unsafe \nproduct.  During  2008,  there  were  a  total  of  5,610  deaths  in  Afghanistan  from  accidents \noccurring from either misuse or the use of unsafe LPG cylinders. Customers regard Sungas' \ncylinder inspection and maintenance process as a key product differentiator.  \n \n4.  Market Regulation, Pricing, and Affordability \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n16.  The LPG market in Afghanistan is currently not subject to quality standards or control \nregulations other than import classification, which is not always tightly controlled. As a result, \nproduct quality is variable, and at times very poor. Import and distribution of LPG are not subject \nto licensing other than regular business license requirements. \n \n17.  LPG prices are market-based. Consistent with international best practice, Afghanistan \ndoes not subsidize LPG. LPG sales prices are subject to competition and adjusted in line with \nchanges  in  the  LPG  purchase  price  and  transportation costs, both  of  which are  linked  to \ninternational petroleum prices. The retail price of LPG in Afghanistan is typically about double its \ninternational  price  because  of  higher  supply  costs  and  margins  charged  by  importers, \n                                                 \n9  A comparison of recorded quantities of LPG imports versus the quantity consumed in Afghanistan suggests that \nthere are significant non-report imports. \n10  Illegal imports are quantities that are traded (bought and sold) commercially but imported by entities that are not \nlicensed by the Government of Afghanistan for importation of petroleum products. ", "  5\nwholesalers, and retailers. Seasonal and regional variations also play a role as supply adjusts \naccording to demand. \n \n18.  The  demand  for  LPG  in  Afghanistan  is  highly  price-sensitive.  The  LPG  market  in \nAfghanistan is characterized by a long supply chain with numerous middleman sales, which \ndrives  up  prices  and  applies  downward  pressure  on  consumer  demand.  However,  an \nindependent market expert determined that LPG pricing in the country is market-based, and \nsuppliers  offset  downward  trends  in  demand  by  reducing  their  margins.  Sungas,  the  only \nvertically integrated supplier, has a better cost position and more flexibility by which to reduce its \nmargins, meet consumer affordability constraints, and remain profitable. \n \n5.  Industry Competitiveness and Profitability \n19.  Neither the government nor any private sector operator operates a nationwide LPG \nnetwork able to exploit economies of scale. No organization operating in the LPG market in any \npart of the supply chain has a dominant share of the market. Barriers to entry, though they exist, \nare not strong enough to give any single firm absolute dominance. \n \n20.  The  low  level  of  concentration  in  the  supply  chain,  comparatively  easy  licensing \nprocedures, low customs duty, and the absence of any price regulation, make Afghanistan's \nLPG  market  fully  competitive,  although  this may  be  more  a  result of  market  infancy  than \nimplemented policy. A vertically integrated LPG business has strong potential for profitability \nsince it delivers LPG to the end-consumer at a lower cost compared with the current supply \nchain,  where  profit  is  extracted  numerous  times  as  LPG  is  bought  and  sold  between \nintermediaries. Given the absence of strong incumbents, Sungas, which is vertically integrated \nfrom import to consumer sales with an emphasis on brand safety and reliability, should have a \nstrong first-mover advantage. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n21.  The project is aligned with ADB's strategies and operational objectives, providing safer \nand improved access to a modern fuel supply with direct benefits to economic and social \ndevelopment.  \n \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 \n22.  Strategy 2020 identifies the energy sector as a core operational sector.11  Catalyzing \ninvestments  through  increased  private  sector  participation  in  ADB's  developing  member \ncountries is one of the five strategic priorities. The project contributes to inclusive economic \ngrowth by connecting more Afghans to energy infrastructure, which increases their household \nproductivity and alleviates much of the deprivation that currently exists among women and \nchildren, who spend valuable time collecting firewood and biomass for cooking and heating.  \nThe project addresses an infrastructure deficit, which Strategy 2020 broadly recognizes as a \nconstraint to market-led growth and a proliferator of environmental damage. The project delivers \nnot only improved infrastructure in the form of built assets, but also an improvement in energy \ndelivery services, which creates an enabling environment for the private sector in terms of both \nfuel supply and opportunities to participate as distributors.   \n   \n                                                 \n11  ADB. 2008.

ADB's country partnership strategy for Afghanistan12 recognizes the critical importance \nof  the  energy  sector  for  economic  growth,  private  sector  development,  and  employment \ncreation.  Since lack of access to both power and energy resources is a key constraint to a \ncountry's development, ADB will work with the Ministry of Energy and Water to improve service \ndelivery, promote efficiency, and build capacity across the sector. The project complements the \nefforts of ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department to promote increased access to energy \nservices by providing downstream distribution assets linking more Afghan households to LPG. \n \n3.  Consistency with the Energy Policy 2009 \n24.  The Energy Policy emphasizes promotion of energy sector reforms, governance, and \ncapacity building as one of the advancements necessary for maximizing access to energy for \nall. The project contributes to this objective by assisting a well-organized company that complies \nwith  Afghanistan's  regulatory  procedures\u2014both  those  already  established  and  ones  being \ndeveloped\u2014and connects efficient delivery of energy products and services with best practice \nenergy sector policies, reducing illegal imports and unsafe grey-market distribution. \n \n25.  Extensive use of traditional biomass results in a higher incidence of health problems, \nand the Energy Policy cites World Health Organization data that almost 1.6 million people, \nmostly women and children, die every year around the world from exposure to this pollution.  \nThe typical transition for poor rural people is to switch from traditional biomass to coal, charcoal, \nand kerosene, which are improved sources over traditional biomass, yet their health, safety, and \nenvironmental  (HSE)  effects  are  not  sustainable.  The  project  directly  delivers  the  Energy \nPolicy's preferred option of LPG as a fuel source and also implements an efficient delivery \nsystem that will lower the cost of switching from traditional fuel sources to LPG. \n \n26.  ADB is a major source of external assistance to the energy sector in Afghanistan, having \nprovided  over  $350  million  of  lending  assistance,  $23  million  in  grants,  and  $8  million  in \ntechnical assistance to the energy sector. The focus of sovereign lending assistance has been \non hydropower development, infrastructure rehabilitation and reconstruction, and transmission \nand distribution. ADB's nonlending assistance has focused on sector reviews, feasibility studies, \ninstitutional  development,  renewable  energy  development,  and  regulatory  framework \ndevelopment for the natural gas sector.   \n \n4.  Consistency with ADB's Private Sector Operations in Afghanistan \n27.  Notwithstanding the challenging investment climate, ADB's Private Sector Operations \nDepartment (PSOD) has been active in Afghanistan since 2003. PSOD has provided three \ntranches of direct financing, a B loan, and a political risk guarantee to help Afghanistan's current \ntelecommunications  leader,  Roshan,  deliver  affordable  communications  services  to  the \npopulation. PSOD has also helped establish one of Afghanistan's first new banks\u2014Afghanistan \nInternational Bank.  Being a benchmark transaction and aligned with private sector development \npriorities as set forth in the country partnership strategy, the project is expected to enhance \naccess  to  efficient  energy  sources  for  households  and  promote  productivity  for  small  and \nmedium-size businesses, thereby fostering economic growth, reducing poverty, and creating \nemployment opportunities throughout the country. The project generally complements PSOD's \nongoing investments, wherein the focus has been on creation of an enabling environment, \ninstitutional strengthening, investment promotion, and infrastructure development. \n                                                 \n12  ADB. 2008.

The Investee and Sponsors \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n28.  The sponsors of Sungas are three well-regarded non-resident Afghan businessmen, \neach with a long history of establishing and operating successfully in the areas of petroleum \nproducts  and  consumer  goods  packaging  and  distribution  in  the  challenging  business \nenvironment of Afghanistan. With ADB's subscription, the Sponsors will collective own 75% of \nthe Company. \n29.  Abdul Rahman Alokozay, chairman and president of Sungas Ltd., is the owner of the \nAlokozay Group Corporation, engaged in the import and distribution of tobacco, tea, and similar \nfast-moving  consumer  goods  in  the  United  Arab  Emirates,  former  Soviet  Union,  and \nAfghanistan.  The  Alokozay  Group  owns  and  operates  substantial  storage,  packaging,  and \ndistribution facilities in the United Arab Emirates and other countries. Its Afghanistan operations \ninclude the import and distribution of tea and tobacco.   \n30.  Mahmut \u00c7an Kadiri, managing director and chief executive officer of Sungas Ltd., leads \nthe family-owned Barakat Company Ltd., a major importer of building materials, petroleum \nproducts,  and  food  products.  It  has  a  30-year  operating  history  in  Afghanistan  and  has \noperations in Kazakhstan (wheat flour milling), Uzbekistan (medical cotton processing), and \nTurkey  (greenhouse  operations).  It  is  the  distributor  of MTZ  tractors  and  has a  history  of \ndistributorships with Unilever, Colgate-Palmolive, Tesco, Mobil, Pirelli, JVC, Toshiba, and other \nwell-known manufacturers of global consumer brands. \n \n31.  Abdul Wahab Wahab Kefayat, director of Purchasing and Turkmenistan Operations for \nSungas Ltd., owns Kefayat General Trading Company LLC, a distributor of major brands of \nhousehold,  food,  and  personal  care  products,  tires  (Hankook),  and  lubricants  (Total).  The \ncompany imports and distributes petroleum products in significant quantities from Turkmenistan \nand Uzbekistan, and has interests in tourism, real estate development, and hotel construction \nand management. It also operates a network of currency exchange dealerships throughout \nAfghanistan. \n2.  Project Design \n \n32.  The project will establish a nationwide LPG distribution network with a capacity of up to \n190,000 tons per year by 2019. Funds will primarily be used for development of distribution \ncenters  in  Herat,  Mazar-e-Sharif,  Kandahar,  and  Pul-e-Qumri;  expansion  of  the  saleable \ninventory of LPG cylinders; and for general capital expenditures to support the LPG storage \nterminals in Hairaton and Turghundy, expansion of the transportation fleet, and enhancement of \ndistribution center equipment. \na.  Distribution Strategy \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n33.  A fleet of tanker trucks transports LPG from 2 bulk storage terminals, near the borders of \n ", "8   \nUzbekistan and Turkmenistan, to LPG cylinder refilling stations in five major Afghan city centers. \nRetail distribution is accomplished through a Sungas-franchised sales force, which works under \nreselling agreements with Sungas. The initial distribution phase will service Kabul and Herat, \nAfghanistan's two major cities, followed by the other major demand centers at Mazar-e-Sharif, \nKandahar,  and  Pul-e-Qumri,  in  step  with  Sungas's  market  penetration  and  sales  growth. \nSelection of resellers is critical in achieving the business strategy, as they need to be positioned \nsuch  that  cylinders  can  be  easily  picked  up  or  delivered  to  consumers.  Sungas  provides \nuniforms, and customer interaction and product training to the resellers, so that the buying and \nservice experience is consistent from consumer to consumer and for each consumer over time. \n34.  Consumers initially pay a deposit for the use of Sungas LPG cylinders. When they have \nused  the  LPG,  they  return  the  empty  cylinder  to  the  reseller  by  either  dropping  it  off  or \nscheduling a pickup.  In both cases, the consumer receives, in exchange for the empty cylinder, \na full cylinder of the same size, paying only for the incremental LPG. The resellers return the \nempty cylinders to the refilling center, which recycles the cylinder by washing, inspecting, and \nrefilling.   \nb.  Supply Flexibility and Bulk Storage \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n35.  The LPG is purchased in bulk quantities from petroleum refineries in Uzbekistan and \nTurkmenistan. A rail line crossing the border into Hairaton from Uzbekistan makes bulk LPG \ntransportation  from  Uzbekistan  particularly  efficient.  Transportation  into  Turghundy  from \nTurkmenistan is either by rail or by tanker truck over the national highway. By utilizing two \nindependently  supplied  terminals,  with  the  ability  to  purchase  LPG  from  two  independent \nrefineries and route supplies to any of their five refilling centers from either terminal, Sungas has \nsupply flexibility, particularly when compared to other private importers in the country. Such \nefficiency gains will be passed on to consumers through lower prices as Sungas competes for \nmarket share. Construction at both bulk storage sites was completed in 2008. \nc.  Facility Construction \n \n36.  Bulk storage terminals and refilling centers employ LPG equipment and systems that \ncomply with international quality and safety standards, including those set by the American \nSociety of Mechanical Engineers and the American Petroleum Institute. \n37.  LPG bulk storage tanks were fabricated by Isisan in Turkey and erected on site by \nSungas-managed contractors. The tanks were manufactured and tested according to European \npressure vessel standards. LPG control and operating equipment at the bulk storage terminals \nwere procured from FAS GMBH Flussigas division of Germany. LPG refilling equipment and \ncarousels are supplied by Kaya Inc. of Turkey, which has supplied many LPG operators in  \nTurkey and the Middle East, including Ipragaz and BP. LPG cylinders are supplied by Mauria \nUdyog  Limited  of  India  and  are  compliant  with  European  standards.  The  cylinders  were \nmanufactured and tested and certified by Bureau Veritas. \n \n \nd.  Organization and Management \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n38.  Sungas will directly employ about 340 Afghan personnel within 5 years. They will receive ", "  9\ndedicated in-house training, with key supervisory and management staff being trained overseas.  \nOperator training has already been carried out at the Hairaton bulk storage site and the Kabul \n(Karizmir) refilling station. Sungas is organized geographically by location of operation, and by \nfunction, namely marketing, purchasing, administration, and operations. \n39.  The  administrative  head  office  is  in  Mazar-e-Sharif.  Local  expertise  is  largely \nunavailable, and few international experts are willing to relocate to Afghanistan, so recruiting \nstaff with the required functional and industry expertise is challenging. The sponsors have \nlooked  to  their  individual  business  networks  and  have  identified  qualified  persons  for  key \npositions. As an example, the general director of Sungas, A. Nasim, is a long-time employee \nfrom the Barakat Group in Turkey, and the Kabul marketing manager, M. Rustaki, has worked \nfor the Alokozay Group. Most critical management positions have been filled and personnel will \nbe added as the organization expands with the growth of the business. \n40.  To minimize overhead expenses in the early phase of business growth, general and \nadministrative staff are shared with the sponsors' other operations co-located at the sites in \nHairaton and Mazar-e-Sharif, under service agreements.  \n41.  The purchasing organization, with offices in Almaty, Ashgabat, Tashkent, and Termiz, \nreports directly to one of the sponsors, Abdul Wahab Wahab Kefayat. A fleet of tanker trucks \nthat transport LPG from Turkmenistan to Turghundy is based in Turkmenistan, along with the \ndrivers, and managed by the Ashgabat office.  \n42.  Sungas  LLC  was  established  in  2008  as  a  limited  liability  company  registered  in \nDelaware, United States, with the intent of being the holding company for Sungas Ltd.  ADB \nproposes to subscribe to shares in Sungas LLC, and at the time of subscription, the sponsors \nwill  subscribe  to  an  in-kind  amount  of  shares  at  the  appraised  value  of  Sungas  Ltd.  and \nadditional shares as required to maintain 75% ownership of the company. Sungas LLC will be \nregistered with the Afghanistan Ministry of Commerce as a foreign company owner of Sungas \nLtd., establishing the parent-subsidiary legal relationship through agreement documents. \n43.  Sungas Ltd. was born out of the household and commercial LPG business of ANP, a \ncompany owned by the sponsors and engaged in the purchasing, import, distribution and sale of \npetroleum  products  (gasoline,  diesel,  jet  fuel,  and  industrial  LPG).  In  2007,  the  sponsors \nestablished Sungas Ltd. as an independent company to market LPG to the commercial and \nhousehold market segments. ANP's and Sungas's co-located fixed assets, prior to 2008, were \nall held by ANP, but were transferred to Sungas in January 2008. ANP still operates as a seller \nof petroleum products, and the Sungas business model includes a leaseback of petroleum \nfacilities to ANP and a service fee agreement to cover the costs of common personnel and site \nservices. \ne.  Business Development Strategy \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n44.  Two fully automated refilling stations (one in Kabul and one in Herat) were built initially.  \nTo achieve nationwide coverage and commercial success, Sungas plans to construct three \nmore  refilling  stations  in  the  major  city  centers  of  Afghanistan.  This  roll-out  strategy  was \nvalidated by the independent market consultants, who identified Kabul and Mazar-e-Sharif as \nthe most important centers, followed by Herat, Kandahar, and Pul-e-Qumri. \n45.  Sungas's marketing strategy is to identify local entrepreneurs who will serve as the \n ", "10  \ncompany's authorized dealers in specific, restricted markets. By controlling distribution assets \nand outsourcing sales and collections, Sungas will be able to efficiently retain control over \nquality,  inventories,  and  physical  distribution,  while  reducing  overhead  costs.  Building  a \nnationwide brand based on quality and reliability of supply will enable Sungas to capture the \nbottling, wholesale, and distribution segment of the market, which is viewed as potentially the \nmost profitable in the supply chain.  \n46.  Because of Sungas's reputation as a reliable and transparent LPG supplier, there is high \ndemand from existing distributors currently reselling LPG from other suppliers. Distributors of \nother LPG suppliers complain of inaccurate LPG dispensing by other suppliers, sometimes with \nthe intent to overcharge the reseller. These distributors are attracted to the Sungas franchise \nbecause of their state-of-the-art filling and metering accompanied by 100% leak testing of all \ncylinders  after  filling.  Both  distributors  and  consumers  complain  of  unsafe  and  unreliable \ncylinders and fittings. As reported by company management, Sungas is turning away potential \ndistributors because it does not have the LPG handling capacity to supply them until the \nplanned capital expenditure for the remaining refilling centers and LPG cylinders is complete. \n47.  As with any commodity product in a competitive market, product packaging or branding \nis of more importance for differentiation than price, as pricing pressures prevent competition \nfrom differentiating on price. Each of the sponsors has extensive experience in successfully \nbuilding  brands  for  consumer  goods,  in  areas  as  diverse  as  toothpaste,  tea,  and  motor \nlubricants.  Marketing  measures  include  multimedia  (print,  television,  and  radio)  advertising \ncampaigns coupled with promotions, loyalty programs, and sales incentives for dealers.  \n      \n3.  Project Outputs and Outcome \n \n48.  The project outputs are the commissioning and expansion of Sungas\u2019s nationwide LPG \ndistribution  network.  The  project  will  further  enhance  the  bulk  storage  facilities  for  higher \ninventory turnover and will create a total of 5 LPG refilling stations at the major population \ncenters of Kabul, Mazar-e-Sharif, Pul-e-Qumri, Kandahar, and Herat. Sungas will stimulate \nmore private sector activity through contracts with independent resellers and distributors. \n49.  The project will expand the national supply of LPG, enabling an additional 230,000 \nhouseholds to access affordable and safe LPG by 2019 and contributing to a national supply of \n833,000 tons per year by 2014. The project will showcase international design and safety \nstandards in the purchasing of specialized equipment and fabrication of facility components. By \n2014, 340 jobs will be created at the storage facilities and refilling stations.  \n \nB.  Development Impact \n1.  Contribution to Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction \n50.  Economic growth and the provision of basic services are essential for the improved well-\nbeing and quality of life of the people of Afghanistan. Poverty reduction and economic growth in \nAfghanistan  require  the  development  of  small-scale  and  grass-root  businesses  to  provide \ngainful employment. The provision of basic inputs for the development of such businesses is \nlacking. Also, as is evident from the HDI, people lack access to basic necessities, particularly in \nremote and rural areas. The project provides a clean, safe, convenient, and reliable source of \nenergy to households and small businesses. Such sources of energy are in short supply in the \ncountry.  Further,  through  improved  distribution  and  operational  efficiency,  and  through ", "  11\neconomies of scale, the project will be able to price LPG more competitively, thereby making it \naccessible and affordable for more customers. The project will directly provide employment to \nmore than 300 people, but its indirect contribution to employment generation will be more \nsignificant. The growth of small businesses through the availability of a reliable and secure \nsource of energy will provide employment to many people and improve their level of economic \nwell-being. A reduction in the use of traditional fuels like wood and biomass will result in better \nlocal air quality, benefiting the poor in particular as they are more dependent, on such fuels. \n2.  Private Sector Development \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n51.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR), prepared by ADB with confidential financial \ninputs from the Company, indicates that the project's benefit to the Afghanistan economy is \ngreater than its benefit to the company.  The operators employed by Sungas and also the \nconsumers that purchase LPG from Sungas will benefit from the environmental, health, and \nsafety improvements. The company has a formalized health, safety, and environment (HSE) \npolicy that was prepared by Bureau Veritas in 2007, as well as an environmental management \nplan (EMP) that was established in 2007 and verified by an ADB audit in October 2009.   \n52.  The profitability of the ADB investment will be judged by the return on investment of cash \nflows from ADB to the company and cash flows from the company to ADB in the form of annual \ndividends, and ultimately, the sale of its shares \n53.  ADB additionality is required for the timely introduction of cash to enable the company to \nimplement its business plan, which entails constructing refilling stations to meet market demand \nand establishing a brand preference among consumers. \n3.  Economic Sustainability \n \n54.  The economic analysis of the project was carried out according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nthe Economic Analysis of Projects.13 The direct benefits of the project include the provision of \nclean, affordable and reliable energy to households and small businesses. The market price is \nused as a proxy to value these benefits. The project results in environmental and related health \nbenefits, especially for women and children, but these were not quantified in the analysis \nmaking it a conservative valuation of benefits. Adding new capacity, increasing the supply, and \nproviding the fuel more efficiently make the sector more competitive and the product affordable \nfor more consumers.  Sensitivity testing against three adverse scenarios demonstrates that the \nproject is economically robust and viable. The project is most sensitive to an increase in the \nprice of LPG. \nC.  Environment and Social Dimensions \n1.  Environment \n \n55.  Sungas has given due consideration to HSE aspects in the facilities\u2019 site selection, \ndesign, equipment procurement and specification, and construction. An initial environmental \nexamination was prepared in September 2007 and the EMP has been implemented at the \nproject sites. An independent expert will audit the company's EMP compliance prior to financial \nclose,  as  the  security  situation  in  Afghanistan  permits.    Environmental  quality  monitoring \n                                                 \n13  ADB.  1997.  Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.  Manila. \n ", "12  \nrequirements in terms of ambient air quality, water quality, and noise levels in and around the \nfacilities during construction and operation will be implemented to meet the prescribed World \nHealth Organization and ADB standards (i.e., World Bank Group's Pollution Prevention and \nAbatement Handbook 1998: Toward Cleaner Production). \n56.  The use of LPG will improve household health conditions by providing LPG to replace \ntraditional sources of energy for cooking, heating, and lighting purposes. Where wood charcoal \nand animal dung have been the primary sources of heating and cooking fuel, smoke from fires \nhave contributed significantly to infant respiratory infections and infant mortality. Clean burning \nLPG will reduce indoor air pollution and improve ambient air quality. The availability and use of \nLPG will save time needed for gathering fuel wood, and allow for more productive activities such \nas household chores, farming, schooling and after-school study for women and children. \n57.  The project is classified as category B under ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \nThe environmental impacts have been assessed and statutory permits from the government \nhave been obtained to construct and operate the proposed LPG and oil bulk storage facilities. \nDue diligence of the project's HSE activities was undertaken in September 2007 and confirms \nthat  the  project  meets  ADB's  environmental  requirements  as  well  as  national  and  local \nrequirements. A Health, Safety, and Environmental Management Manual14 has been prepared \nto clearly define the responsibilities and procedures to be implemented throughout project \npreparation and operation of the facilities. The risk assessment and emergency response plans \nand procedures incorporated in the HSE manual are adequate to handle unforeseen risks and \nemergencies. As part of its community environmental plan, Sungas will undertake periodic \nmonitoring and consultation with local communities during operation of the facilities to identify \nany major impacts and implement appropriate actions to mitigate the adverse impacts. \n2.  Social Dimensions \n \n58.  Findings of the social assessment show that there are limited negative social impacts \nduring construction and operation. Sites for the bulk storage facilities were located in areas at a \nsafe distance from any human settlement or any public facilities. From the perspective of ADB's \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project  is  categorized  as  C.  The  Hairaton  and \nTurghundy bulk storage facilities were constructed on vacant land near the Uzbekistan and \nTurkmenistan borders. These facilities, which were constructed on land being leased by the \ngovernment to ANP, have been transferred to Sungas Ltd. at incorporation. Three refilling \nstations, each requiring 1.5 hectares of land, are being established on land purchased by \nSungas. Pumping stations will be set up in other parts of the country on vacant land leased or \npurchased by Sungas either from the government or private owners. The selection of sites is \nbeing undertaken in such a way that involuntary resettlement is avoided. Moreover, Sungas only \nputs up pumping stations on land where lease or purchase has been freely negotiated with \nproperty owners. There are a number of ethnic groups in Afghanistan, such as the Aimaks,  \nBaloch, Brahui, Hazaras, Hindkowans, Kuchi Pashtuns, Tajiks, Turkmen, and Uzbek.  None of \nthese ethnic groups has been affected as bulk storage facilities were constructed in industrial \nzones and refilling and pumping stations on leased or purchased land. The project is expected \nto improve the socioeconomic living conditions of people living in five major centers, namely, \nHerat,  Kabul,  Kandahar,  and  Mazar-e-Sharif,  by  providing  LPG  to  those  using  traditional \n                                                 \n14 The HSE manual is designed and approved by Bureau Veritas and design specification and standards are certified \nby them. The designed standards and specifications adopted by Sungas for equipments (including LPG cylinders) \nand facilities are conformity with the internationally accepted industry best specifications and it has complied with \nEuropean (EN) Standards. The equipments are procured from manufacturers well known in the international \nmarkets and quality is inspected and checked by independent international quality check agencies. ", "  13\nsources of fuel for cooking, lighting, and heating, and good quality fuel for public and private \ntransportation. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is attached (Appendix 2). \n \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n59.  Major fixed asset investments are planned to occur over the first 4 years of operations, \nwhich started in 2007, followed by capacity increases at the refilling stations and for LPG \ncylinder purchases as demand increases. As of December 2009, both bulk storage terminals \nand 2 of the 5 planned refilling stations are in operation. \n \n60.  The total cost to implement the business plan is financed by cash flow from operations \nand equity capital from the sponsors and ADB. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Construction Arrangements \n \n61.  Construction of the bulk storage facilities, the more complex of Sungas's projects, is \ncomplete. Further construction arrangements to complete the remaining refilling stations will be \nmanaged by Sungas, which will procure local subcontractors for the various trade crafts. The \nconstruction of the refilling centers is primarily a commercial class building project. Specialized \nequipment, including the LPG refilling carousels, and LPG storage tanks, will be purchased from \nand fabricated by international firms. Local pipefitter and welding contractors will be managed \nby Sungas and their work will be in compliance with the company's HSE policy, which includes \nguidelines on the installation of LPG-handling equipment. \n2.  Anticorruption Policy  \n \n62.  The company and the sponsors were advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) and policy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing \nof Terrorism (2003). Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB will require the investee to institute, maintain, and comply with internal \nprocedures  and  controls  following  international  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of \npreventing  corruption  or  money  laundering  activities  and  the  financing  of  terrorism  and  to  \ncovenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. The investment documentation \nbetween ADB and the company and sponsors will further allow ADB to investigate any violation \nor potential violation of these undertakings. \n3.  Project Performance Monitoring, Reporting, and Evaluation \n \n63.  Financial reports are audited annually by the local affiliates of a reputed international \naccounting firm. Financial record-keeping and statements will be prepared in compliance with \nInternational Financial Reporting Standards. \n64.  ADB will periodically monitor (i) implementation progress, (ii) development impacts, (iii) \nsocial impacts, and (iv) environmental impacts. Implementation progress will be monitored by \nreviewing  project  status  reports  and  periodic  operation  reports  prepared  by  the  company.  \n ", "14  \nDevelopment, social, and environmental impacts will be evaluated by ADB during annual review \nmissions. \n \nF.  Projected Operational and Financial Performance \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n65.  The project\u2019s internal rate of return is anticipated to be strong in light of the Sponsors' \ncost of equity capital. The financial performance is satisfactory in conditions of general LPG \nmarket stress or external stresses from currency depreciation or increases in the international \nprice  of  raw  materials.  The  scalability  of  capital  expenditures  (i.e., matching  the  fleet  and \ncylinder capacities with market demand) will further mitigate the risk of the project not being \nviable. \n \n66.  The anticipated average earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization \nmargin, as a percent of total sales, is moderately strong from 2010 to 2019. The average net \nprofit margin is low over the same period; however, it ramps up after 2011, when the business \nwill be fully utilizing the capacity of installed assets. The company has excellent liquidity to cover \nits short-term purchasing and debt obligations. \n \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n1.  Instrument and Amount \n \n67.  ADB proposes to subscribe up to a maximum of the lesser of $8,000,000 and 25% of the \npaid-up share capital within 2 years from the approval date, provided that ADB prudential \ninvestment limits are met. \n   \n2.  Terms and Conditions \n \n68.  The sponsors and the company will be required to comply with all ADB environmental \nand social safeguards as well as corporate governance policies.  \n \n69.  ADB intends to own shares in Sungas for a period of time sufficient to maximize its \nadditionality to the company. However, ADB may exit the investment by exercising a put option \nto the company or the sponsors under certain voluntary and commercial conditions. \n \n3.  Compliance with Investment Limitations  \n \n70.  The proposed investment will be within the medium-term country, industry, group, and \nsingle project exposure limits for nonsovereign operations. \n \nB.  Justification for ADB Assistance \n71.  The investment stimulates the expansion of a company that demonstrates adherence to \nbusiness  ethics  and  international  safety  standards,  and  provides  much  needed  capital  to \ncontinue the expansion of the commercial franchise through construction of critical LPG refilling \ncenters. ADB's support of this expansion will foster confidence among commercial lenders, \ninternational investors, and aid agencies to support broader private sector development in a ", "  15\nwider range of industries in Afghanistan. ADB's assistance adds value to the project in the \nfollowing ways: \n \n(i)  Catalyzes private investment in a security-challenged developing member \ncountry.  ADB  assistance  will  support  Sungas's  first  phase  of  business \nexpansion. The success of the company\u2019s business will demonstrate to other \nprivate  investors  that  positive  outcomes  are  achievable.  ADB's  successful \nparticipation in the first phase may make commercial cofinancing more realistic \nfor financing subsequent phases of Sungas's growth plans.  \n \n(ii)  Provides direct assistance to the poor. The project contributes to inclusive \neconomic growth by connecting more Afghans to energy infrastructure, which \nincreases their household productivity and alleviates much of the deprivation that \ncurrently exists among women and children, who spend valuable time collecting \nfirewood and biomass for cooking and heating. The project connects more of the \ncountry's low income households to efficient power and energy resources, which \nare  key  enablers  in  reducing  poverty.  Additionally,  the  project  facilitates  the \ntransition for poor rural people switching from traditional biomass directly to LPG \nrather than through the typical intermediate fuels such as coal, charcoal, and \nkerosene, which have unsustainable HSE effects.   \n \n(iii)  Promotes corporate governance. Through its role as a shareholder and its \nboard representation, ADB can influence corporate governance practices and \nhelp the company develop into a role model for other ventures in Afghanistan.  \nThe example set by the company, with ADB's help, can be replicated by other \ncompanies  in  the  sponsors'  spheres  of  interest  and  by  other  companies  in \nAfghanistan. \n \n(iv)  Enhances environment and social responsibility. ADB's participation in the \nproject has facilitated the adoption of environmental and social safeguards. The \ninitial  environmental  examination,  conducted  in  2007,  prompted  public \nconsultation, which generated significant support from local stakeholders and \nofficials,  and  ensured  the  creation  of  an  HSE  policy  developed  by  Bureau \nVeritas, and implementation of an EMP. \n \nC.  Risks and Mitigation Measures \n72.  Investments in Afghanistan, by nature of the political and commercial environment, are \nexposed to a high degree of political, commercial, and security risk. Nevertheless, unless a \nmultilateral financial institution like ADB takes the lead in structuring such transactions and \nhelps to mitigate the risks, projects will stall, as other means of financing are practically non-\nexistent at present. Notwithstanding the risk environment, the project has inherent risk mitigation \nthrough very experienced sponsors, a wide distribution of scalable assets, and fundamental \nmarket demand. Specific identified risks and their mitigants include: \n \n(i)  Market risk.  There is currently no regulatory regime for the LPG market in \nAfghanistan.  There are also significant price volatilities since supply and demand \nlevels are subject to availability and seasonality.  ADB has conducted extensive \ndue diligence over several years on the sponsors and on the market, including \nengaging an independent consultant with experience in the LPG market.  Market \ndata show that there is a ready and substantial market for LPG across the \n ", "16  \ncountry, especially for household consumption, and that as household income \nincreases,  consumers  would  tend  to  shift  to  cleaner  fuels.  The  consultant \nvalidated the sponsors' expectations and market opportunities, and the market \nforecast was used as the basis for the company's financial model. ADB will work \nwith the company through the board of directors to ensure business decisions \nand their execution are consistent with the strategy.   \n \n(ii)  Product quality and safety. ADB commissioned an independent audit on HSE \nissues, which validated that the installed equipment conformed with international \nstandards and the handling of LPG with quality control best practices. The final \nHSE report outlines recommended management plans that have been adopted \nby Sungas as corporate policies and procedures. Sungas is thus employing \nproduct and safety standards used in developed markets and well in excess of \nthose currently seen in Afghanistan. \n \n(iii)  Sponsor,  management,  and  reputational  risk. The sponsors are individual \ninvestors, and ADB does not typically invest alongside individual sponsors as \npartners  due  to  issues  related  to  compliance,  know-your-customer  (KYC) \nprinciples, transparency in terms of funding sources, creditworthiness, related \nparty transactions, conflict of interest and succession. However, there are few \nalternatives in making significant development impacts through the private sector \nin Afghanistan, given the lack of commercial interest. With this environment, ADB \nhas therefore selected a group of sponsors who are well-reputed in the local \ncontext.  Sponsor risk is further mitigated by having safeguard mechanisms in \nplace, and by ADB having a unilateral put option, allowing ADB to exit for any \nreason  at  any  time.    Given  the  lack  of  exposure  of  the  sponsors  to  the \ncommercial  credit  markets,  a  comprehensive  integrity  investigation  was \ncommissioned to address potential reputational risk to ADB. An international risk \nmanagement consulting firm, hired by ADB, conducted a multi-country search \nand  investigation  into  the  business  interests  and  personal  history  of  each \nsponsor, their relatives, and their business associates. The investigation revealed \nno reputational risk for ADB and highlighted the prominent standing of these \nbusiness leaders in Afghanistan.     \n \n(iv)  Regulatory and political risk. The regulatory environment in Afghanistan is still \ndeveloping. However, given Sungas's high quality supply of LPG to meet the \ncurrent  market  demand,  and  the  prominence  of  the  sponsors,  the  risk  of \nregulatory and political interference is manageable. \n \n(v)  Foreign  exchange  and  price  risk.  The  company's  cash  flows  will  be \ndenominated  in  afghani,  whereas  dividend  payments  to  the  investors  and \npurchases of LPG imports will be in foreign currency. Working capital funding \nand hedging instruments are not available in Afghanistan. Foreign exchange risk \nis partially mitigated by the international benchmarking of the LPG retail price in \ndollars, and through a cost-plus mechanism on retail sales of LPG such that price \nvolatilities can be passed on to consumers.  However, the afghani could devalue \nto the point where the demand elasticity imposes a ceiling on the retail price. At \nthis point, Sungas would be unable to pass on further exchange rate increases; \nhowever, it could sell excess LPG internationally. This contingency is further \nmitigated by the recent performance of the afghani which, since its introduction in \nFebruary 2003, has substantially held its value and is freely convertible.  ", "  17\n \n(vi)  Security  risk.  The  recently  deteriorating  security  situation  can  delay  project \nimplementation  and  pose  threats  to  employees  and  infrastructure.  It  can \nconstrain the company in distributing its products and severely impact its ability \nto realize its sales and profits forecasts. However, the company is supplying a \nbasic  commodity  and  it  has  a  flexible  program  for  build-up,  roll-out,  and \ndistribution, which can cater to changes in the security situation and market. \n \n(vii)  Insurance availability. Sungas has obtained insurance coverage on its fixed \nassets from a London-based insurer. Losses are covered under typical weather \ndamage, operational damage, and damage caused by vehicles; however, acts of \nwar  and  terrorism  are  excluded  and  not  available  from  alternate  insurers  in \nAfghanistan. Losses to the company's fleet of tanker trucks are not covered \nunder any policy as the cost to insure the fleet is not commensurate with the \nbook value of the assets. \n \n(viii)  ADB influence over strategy and direction. ADB will work with the sponsors to \nestablish and enforce acceptable governance procedures to protect the interests \nof ADB as a minority investor and to prepare the company for ADB's timely exit \nafter development impact has been demonstrated. \n \nD.  Assurances \n73.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank, 15 the \nGovernment of Afghanistan will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed \nassistance to Sungas via ADB's investment in Sungas LLC.  ADB will enter into suitable finance \ndocumentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed \nassistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \n \n \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n74.  I am satisfied that the proposed investment would comply with the Articles of Agreement \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the absence of the President, under the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove the equity investment of up to the lesser of $8,000,000 and 25% of the issued and paid \nup share capital in Sungas LLC for the LPG Distribution Development Project from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources, on terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board.  \n \n \n \nC.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nThe country partnership strategy for Afghanistan (2009\u20132013)a has identified the limited availability and poor quality of power \ninfrastructure  (only  6%  of  the  population  has  access  to  electricity)  as  one  of  the  factors  undermining  the  country's \ncompetitiveness, economic opportunities, and delivery of social services such as education, health care, and security. The \nproject, which will develop a nationwide liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) storage and distribution network in Afghanistan, will \npromote increased access to energy services by providing downstream distribution assets linking more Afghan households to \nLPG. The project is consistent with the 2009 Energy Policy as it directly delivers the Energy Policy's preferred option of LPG \nas a fuel source and also implements an efficient delivery system that will lower the cost of switching from traditional fuel \nsources to LPG. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.  Key Issues.  \nThe project connects more of the country's low income households to efficient power and energy resources, which are key \nenablers in reducing poverty. Additionally, the project facilitates the transition for poor rural people switching from traditional \nbiomass directly to LPG rather than through the typical intermediate fuels such as coal, charcoal, kerosene, which have \nunsustainable health, safety, and environmental effects. The project is also expected to foster sustainable economic growth \nas small and medium-size enterprises will have easy access to a clean fuel source.  \n2. Design Features \nThe project will establish a nationwide LPG distribution network with a capacity of up to 190,000 tons per year by 2019.  \nFunds will primarily be used for development of distribution centers in Herat, Mazar-e-Sharif, Kandahar, and Pul-e-Qumri, \nexpansion of the saleable inventory of LPG cylinders, and for general capital expenditures to support the LPG storage \nterminals in Hairaton and Turghundy, expansion of the transportation fleet, and enhancement of distribution center equipment. \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending \nNot applicable. \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Findings of Social Analysis \nFindings of the social assessment show that there are limited negative social impacts during construction and operation. Sites \nfor the bulk storage facilities were located in areas at a safe distance from any human settlement or any public facilities. From \nthe perspective of ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is categorized as C. The Hairaton and Turghundy \nbulk storage facilities were constructed on vacant land near the Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan borders. These facilities, which \nwere constructed on land being leased by the government to ANP, have been transferred to Sungas Ltd. at incorporation. \nThree refilling stations, each requiring 1.5 hectares of land, are being established on land purchased by Sungas. Pumping \nstations will be set up in other parts of the country on vacant land leased or purchased by Sungas either from the government \nor private owners. The selection of sites is being undertaken in such a way that involuntary resettlement is avoided. Moreover, \nSungas only puts up pumping stations on land where lease or purchase has been freely negotiated with propery owners. \nThere are a number of ethnic groups in Afghanistan, such as the Aimaks, Baloch, Brahui, Hazaras, Hindkowans, Kuchi \nPashtuns, Tajiks, Turkmen, and Uzbek.  None of these ethnic groups has been affected as bulk storage facilities were \nconstructed in industrial zones and refilling and pumping stations on leased or purchased land. The project is expected to \nimprove the socioeconomic living conditions of people living in five major centers, namely, Herat, Kabul, Kandahar, and \nMazar-e-Sharif, by providing LPG to those using traditional sources of fuel for cooking, lighting, and heating, and good quality \nfuel for public and private transportation.  \n \nThe project is expected to improve the socioeconomic living conditions of people living in five major centers, namely, Kabul, \nHerat, Mazar-e-Sharif, Kandahar, and Pul-e-Khumri by providing LPG to those using traditional sources of fuel for cooking, \nlighting and heating and good quality fuel for public and private transportation. During construction, approximately 40\u201350 \nlaborers were employed by construction contractors at each site. During operation, Sungas is expected to increase local labor \nstaff from 108 to 336 in 5 years and to 372 by the 10th year.  \n \n \n \n ", "    Appendix 2   2  1   \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nWith respect to the process of public participation and consultation, various formal and informal consultations were carried out \nduring the field assessment in April 2007. Representatives of regulatory agencies, local government officials and residents of \nnearby communities were consulted on socioeconomic conditions and likely impacts due to construction and operation of the \nproposed storage and refilling facilities, awareness on environmental quality (air, water, noise), presence of historical sites or \ncultural places, and potential hazards to the health and safety of the community. Most of the people consulted strongly \nsupport the project as they think the project will provide easy access to alternative sources of energy, generate employment, \nand contribute to the regional and local economy. With respect to grievances, there has been no reported accident or \ncomplaint on the operations of the bulk storage facilities at Hairaton and Turghundy. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a consultation and participation plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nDuring project design, consultations were carried out in Kabul as part of the environment and social assessment process with \nbeneficiaries, local and national government officials, nongovernment organizations and community leaders, as stakeholders. \nConsultations were also conducted through informal discussions during field visits. During operations, Sungas has adopted a \npolicy principle to demonstrate openness to employees and the community, not only to ensure good communications with \nthese groups but also to promote local development. \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues. The project will connect more Afghans to energy infrastructure, which is expected to increase household \nproductivity and alleviate much of the deprivation that currently exists among women and children, who spend valuable time \ncollecting firewood and biomass for cooking and heating.   \n \n2.
