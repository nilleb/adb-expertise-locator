The investment program will include (i) construction of about six run-of-river \nhydropower  plants 1 to  supply  provincial  centers,  (ii)  construction  of  transmission  systems  to \nconnect  provincial  centers,  and  (iii)  capacity  building  within  the  power  utility  and  communities. \nProject preparatory technical assistance (TA) was used in project preparation.2\n \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nIn  Papua  New  Guinea  (PNG),  grid-connected  power  is  largely  restricted  to  the  main \nurban  areas.  Less  than  10%  of  the  population  has  access  to  electricity.3 In  provincial  urban \ncenters  not  connected  to  the main  power grids, a  relatively  low  percentage  of  urban residents \nare  connected,4 and  distributed  power  is  rarely  available  outside  the  provincial  urban  centers. \nThe supply of power to business and industry in the provincial urban centers is unreliable, with \nregular  power  outages5\n and  demand  that  at  times  exceeds  generation  capacity.  As  a  result, \nmany  large  businesses  in  the  provinces  self-generate  using  diesel  generators,  at  high  cost. \nLack of access to affordable, reliable power is limiting economic growth in provincial centers.  \n \n4.  \nPNG  has  a  total  of  580  megawatts  (MW)  installed  generation  capacity.  PNG  Power \nLimited (PPL), the national state-owned corporatized power utility, manages generation of about \n300  MW,  including  the  two  main  grids  (Port  Moresby  and  Ramu  grids)  and  19 geographically \nisolated independent power grids servicing provincial centers. The remaining 280 MW consists \nof  power  that  is  self-generated  by  industrial  facilities,  including  mines,  and  private  sector \ngenerators.  The  majority  of  provincial  centers  are  supplied  entirely  through  diesel  generation, \nresulting  in  high  generation  costs. 6 The  poor  development  of  provincial  power  is  due  to  (i) \ndifficult  geographical  conditions;  (ii)  maintenance  issues;  (iii)  high  initial  investment  costs  for \nhydropower resulting in reliance on diesel generation, which has low upfront costs but higher life \ncycle costs; and (v) the single national tariff structure, which serves an investment disincentive. \nThe  current  regulatory  framework  provides  power  tariffs  that  allow  full  cost  recovery  by  PPL; \nhowever,  in  the  absence  of  adequately  funded  community  service  obligations  (CSOs),  the \nnational uniform power tariff creates a disincentive for investment in high-cost regional centers. \nThe ongoing policy reform proposes to address this through (i) a CSO policy,7\n (ii) an electricity \ntrust  fund  under  the  draft  electricity  industry  policy  (EIP),  and  (iii)  split  tariffs  to  reflect  higher \n\n                                                \n1  While hydropower is generally the least-cost renewable energy alternative, other sources may be considered. \n2  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2008.  Technical  Assistance  to  Papua  New  Guinea  for  Preparing  the  Power \n\nSector Development Project. Manila (TA 7113-PNG, approved on 8 August). \n\n3  Provinces not connected to the main power grids have an average access rate of 2.9%. \n4  In the provincial centers assessed under the TA for Preparing the Power Sector Development Project, the urban \n\nelectrification rate was 24% to 57%.  \n\n5  For example, PPL estimates that load shedding in West New Britain is currently around 50%.  \n6  Power generation costs in some provincial centers exceed $0.8 per kilowatt-hour. \n7  ADB is assisting the establishment of the CSO policy through ADB. 2009.

The projects selected for the investment program are financially viable under \nthe  current  national  tariff  system.  PNG  has  significant  underutilized  indigenous  renewable \nenergy  sources, particularly  hydropower.  The  investment  program  will  support  development of \nrenewable energy sources, including hydropower plants, in about six target provincial centers to \n(i) improve reliability and quality of power supply in order to stimulate economic growth; and (ii) \nreplace  diesel  generation,  thereby  reducing  power generation  costs  and creating  incentives  to \nimprove access rates.  \n \nThe  investment  program  supports  the  Government  of  PNG\u2019s  strategic  priorities  in  the \n5. \nenergy  sector.  Activities  in  the  PNG  power  sector  are  currently  governed  by  the  Electricity \nIndustry Act 2002. The government has recently prepared the draft EIP,8 which is expected to \nbe  approved  in  2010. It proposes  various  policy measures,  including  (i) facilitating  competition \nand  contestability  in  the  electricity  industry,  including  the  private  sector;  (ii)  up-scaling  rural \nelectrification \nregulation.  The  proposed \n(iii)  enhanced \ndevelopment  of  the  power  sector  in  each  province  is  detailed  in  the  PPL  10-year  power \ndevelopment  plan  (PDP). 9\n The  PDP  lists  the  status  of  current  infrastructure  and  proposed \ninvestments  over  a  10-year  time  frame.  The  PDP  provides  a  road  map  of  priority  hydropower \ndevelopments  in  the  provinces  to  reduce  reliance  on  diesel  generation  and  improve  service \ndelivery. The investment program will support implementation of the PDP.   \n \nThe government has recognized a number of key policy constraints in the power sector \n6.  \nand  is  currently  undertaking  a  number  of  reforms  that  will  be  supported  by  the  investment \nprogram.10 The  investment  program  also  supports  (i)  the  PNG  country  strategy  and  program \n2011\u20132015 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB),11 which prioritizes energy as a key area of \nsupport; (ii) the national program of priority hydropower developments listed in the PDP; and (iii) \nthe  Papua  New  Guinea  Development  Strategic  Plan  2010\u2013203012\n priority  of  replacing  diesel \ngeneration with hydropower. \n \nPNG\u2019s  development  partners  have  been  consulted  extensively  during  development  of \n7.  \nthe investment program. The development partners have recently focused on policy support in \nthe  energy  sector  and  development  of  small  off-grid  power  supply  projects  with  direct  poverty \nalleviation benefits. The Pacific Islands Applied Geosciences Commission provided support for \na  number  of  energy  sector  issues  in  PNG,  including  consultation  regarding  the  draft  national \nenergy policy and draft rural electrification policy through the Pacific Islands Energy Policy and \nStrategic  Action  Planning.  The  World  Bank,  with  support  from  the  Global  Environment  Fund, \nhas  been  supplying  rural  teachers  in  the Western  Province  with  solar  lighting  kits.  It  has  also \nlaunched  a  regional  Sustainable  Energy  Financing  Project,  designed  to  provide  financing \nsupport to the energy sector in a number of Pacific countries, including PNG.  \n \n8.  \nThe  implementation  capacity  of  key  institutions  has  been  assessed  and  capacity \nfinancial  management  of  PPL,  (ii) \nfocusing  on  (i) \nstrengthening  activities  developed, \nprocurement capacity for PPL, (iii) development of public\u2013private partnership (PPP) options for \nconsideration  under  tranche  2,  and  (iv)  capacity  of  communities  to  manage  improved  power \n\n                                                \n8  A draft rural electrification policy has also been prepared, but has yet to receive broad endorsement.   \n9  Government of PNG. 2009.

The MFF was selected as the preferred financing modality as the MFF (i) provides long \nterm support to the implementation of the PNG Power 10 Year Development Plan, (ii) reduces \ncommitment  charges,  (iii)  reduces  transaction  costs  compared  to  individual  project  financing, \n(iv)  enables  staged  construction  to  match  human  resource  availability  within  implementing \nagency, and (v) establishes a platform for ongoing dialogue and support regarding sector reform.  \nThe  government  and  ADB  have  entered  into  a  framework  financing  agreement  (FFA),  which \nsets  out  the  roadmap,  strategic  context,  policy  framework,  investment  program,  and  the \nfinancing  plan.  The  FFA  also  records  the  assurances  and  conditions  in  crosscutting  themes \ncovering  safeguards,  governance,  anticorruption,  financial  management,  procurement,  and \nproject  selection.    Financing  will  be  extended  under  the  MFF  subject  to  the  (i)  submission  of \nperiodic financing requests (PFRs) by the government; (ii) compliance with the project selection \ncriteria;  (iii)  execution  of  the  related  loan  and  project  agreements  for  each  tranche;  and  (iv) \nfulfillment  of  terms,  conditions,  and  undertakings  set  forth  in  the  FFA.  Each  PFR  will  be \naccompanied by a list of projects identified for financing under the MFF. 13\n \n \nB. \n \n9. \nThe  impact  of  the  investment  program  will  be  improved  economic  conditions  in  target \nprovincial centers not connected to the main grids. The outcome of the investment program will \nbe improved utilization of reliable, clean power by PPL to about six provincial urban centers.  \n \nC. \n \n10. \nThe  outputs  of  the  investment  program  will  be  (i)  about  six  renewable  energy  projects, \nincluding  hydropower  plants,  put  into  operation  by  PPL;  (ii)  transmission  systems  constructed \nand operated by PPL; (iii) capacity building undertaken for the implementing agency and project \nbeneficiaries;  and  (iv)  efficient  project  management  services  rendered  by  the  project \nmanagement unit.

The  investment  program  will  establish  key  transmission  links  along  main \npopulation  corridors,  which  will  facilitate  increased  connectivity  of  the  population  outside  the \nmain provincial centers.14\n This will address a key investment hurdle for provincial governments, \nwho are responsible for rural electrification. \n \nD. \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  investments  under  the  PDP  between  FY2011  and  FY2016  is \n12. \nestimated at $550 million equivalent. The investment program, which will support the section of \nthe  PDP  targeting  supply  of  power  to  provincial  centers  not  connected  to  the  main  grids,  is \nestimated to cost $150 million equivalent and will be implemented over 6 years. Tranche 1 will \ncost  about  $71.6  million  equivalent,  including  taxes,  duties,  physical  and  price  contingencies, \ninterest, and other charges.

The  government  will  be  contributing  $30  million  to  the  MFF, \nincluding  all  local  taxes  and  duties.  The  MFF  will  consist  of  two  tranches,  subject  to  the \ngovernment's submission of related PFRs, execution of the related loan and project agreements \nfor each tranche, and fulfillment of terms and conditions and undertakings set forth in the FFA.  \n \n14. \nThe first tranche of the MFF will comprise a blend of (i) a loan from OCR of $40.9 million \n(OCR loan), and (ii) a loan from Special Funds resources of SDR10,565,000 equivalent ($16.4 \nmillion)  (Asian  Development  Fund  [ADF]  loan),  which  will  finance  80%  of  the  total  cost  of \ntranche  1.

Discussions  are  ongoing  for  cofinancing  of  the  proposed  grant  assistance.  The \ngrant project will be submitted separately for Board approval, and may include the following: \n \n\nComponent  A:  Trialing  of  power  grid  extension  to  low-income  rural \ncommunities.  Component  A  will  (a)  consist  of  bundling  of  power  distribution \nprojects to demonstrate the impact of targeted CSOs financing on access rates; \nand (b) target approximately 1,500 poor households in the Northern Province. \nComponent  B:  Trialing  of  community-based  civil  works  contracts. A major \nbarrier  is  the  high  cost  of  civil  works  to  construct  distribution  systems,  which  is \nrelated to difficulties in attracting civil works contractors. The proposed grant will \ntrial community-based civil works contracts for distribution systems.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \n21. \nThe proposed projects have been assessed to be technically viable. For the hydropower \ndesign, all available stream flow data was collated to assess water resource availability. Where \nflow  data  was  limited,  correlated  projections  were  made.  Alternative  designs  have  been \nassessed, e.g., glass-reinforced plastic penstocks have been recommended to (i) reduce initial \ncosts,  (ii)  reduce  maintenance,  and  (iii)  reduce  transport  costs.  Standard  equipment  of  known \ndesign has been selected to (i) increase availability of parts, and (ii) standardize equipment.    \n \nB. \n \n22. \nEconomic aspects. A least-cost analysis of alternative generation options has indicated \nthat tranche 1 projects represent the least-cost means of meeting forecasted growth in demand. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for each project exceeds the EIRR threshold of 12% \n(Divune  Hydropower  Plant  18.6%,  Lake  Hargy \nInterconnection  18.1%,  and  Ramazon \nHydropower  Plant  16.4%),  and  the  projects  are  therefore  economically  viable.  Analysis  was \nundertaken to test the sensitivity of the EIRR to adverse changes in five major risk areas, (i) an \nincrease of 10% in capital cost; (ii) an increase of 10% in operation and maintenance costs; (iii) \na  10%  decrease  in  benefits;  (iv)  a  combination  of  (i),  (ii),  and  (iii);  and  (v)  a  2-year  delay  in \nproject  implementation.  The  analysis  indicates  that  the  EIRR  remains  robust  under  all \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n                                                \n22 The grant design mission (5\u201316 April 2010) agreed on the proposed scope of works with the government.  \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\nGovernance \n\nscenarios,  with  the  exception  that  EIRR  for  the  Lake  Hargy  interconnection  and  Ramazon \nHydropower projects drops just below 12% under the \u201call of the above\u201d scenario.   \n \n23. \nFinancial aspects. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) and financial net present \nvalue  were  computed  at  the  May  2010  price  level.  The  overall  FIRR  of  tranche  1  projects  is \n9.6%,  which  exceeded  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  2.4%.  Tranche  1  is  considered \nfinancially  feasible.  The  financial  viability  of  tranche  1  projects  was  subjected  to  sensitivity \nanalysis.  Sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the  FIRR  is  robust  under  various  adverse  conditions, \nincluding  a  (i)  10%  increase  in capital  costs,  (ii) 10% reduction  in  benefits, (iii) 2-year  delay  in \nproject implementation, and (iv) case 1 and case 2 combined. \n \nC. \n \nFinancial management. A financial management assessment was completed for PPL,23\n24. \n \nincluding a review of the accounting and reporting system, internal and external auditing, fund \ndisbursement,  and  information  system.  Control  risk  for  PPL  was  rated  as  moderate,  and  was \ndeemed to be lower than inherent risk due to the corporatized nature of PPL and its significant \nfinancial  management  capacity.  PPL\u2019s  current  financial  management  system  was  considered \nadequate, however, PPL does not have recent experience with international donor-funded loan \nprojects. Specific training needs have been identified and incorporated into tranche 1 design.   \n \n25. \nProcurement  capacity. A procurement capacity assessment (PCA) was completed for \nPPL. The PCA is included in the FAM (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2). The PCA indicated that PPL has significant procurement experience, including preparation of \nbidding documents and evaluation of technical proposals and monitoring contract performance. \nPPL  has  recent  experience  with  procurement  for  large  projects;  however,  it  does  not  have \nrecent  experience  with  multilateral  development  bank  procurement  procedures.  Targeted \nprocurement training of PPL will be undertaken. \n \n26. \nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto  and  discussed  with  the  Department  of  Petroleum  and  Energy  and  PPL.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the FAM. 24\n  \n \nD. \n \n27. \nPotential  poverty  and  social  benefits  and  impacts  on  local  communities  have  been \nanalyzed.  The  investment  program  incorporates  several  strategies  to  enable  communities  to \nrealize benefits and reduce poverty, including (i) improved access to power, both in towns and \nvillages  near  hydropower  sites;  (ii)  water  supply  connections  to  adjacent  communities;  (iii) \nemployment  during  construction;  (iv)  skills  training;  and  (v)  inclusion  in  civil  work  contracts  of \nis  classified  as  effective  gender \ninvestment  program \nminimum \nmainstreaming. A gender action plan has been prepared, and includes (i) provision of HIV/AIDS \nawareness for men and women, (ii) equal pay for equal work by male and female workers, (iii) \nin  community \nfemale  participation \nconsultations,  (v)  skills  training  for  village  committees  and  households  (minimum  50%  female \nparticipation),  (vi)  the  establishment  of  village  power  and  water  committees  with  at  least  50% \nfemale participation, and  (vii) capacity building of PPL.   \n\nlabor  force,  (iv)  female  participation  (30%) \n\nlabor  standards.

An  environmental  assessment  review  framework  presents  the  general \nanticipated  environmental  impacts  of  the  investment,  selection  criteria,  and  environmental \nprocedures for subsequent projects. Initial environmental examinations have been prepared for \neach of the three tranche 1 projects. The main potential impacts identified include (i) waterway \nsedimentation, (ii) impacts on fauna during construction, and (iii) reduced streamflow. Adequate \nmitigation measures have been incorporated. A climate change adaptation risk  evaluation was \nconducted and considered in infrastructure design.  \n \n29. \nthe  program  provides \nguidelines  for  preparation  of  resettlement  plans  for  subsequent  projects.  Tranche  1  does  not \ninvolve  physical  displacement  of  people  and  structures,  although  it  will  acquire  land  for  two \nhydropower sites. All land acquisition will be financed by the government. Displaced persons will \nlose  part  of  their  land,  crops,  and  trees.  A  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  for  Divune \nHydropower  Plant,  which  involves  acquisition  of  customary  land. 25\n The  resettlement  plan \nincludes measures to compensate for affected land and assets and to assist displaced persons \nto restore and improve their livelihoods.  \n \n30. \nIndigenous peoples. An indigenous peoples planning framework provides guidelines to \nprepare  indigenous  peoples  plans  for  subsequent  tranches.  Customary  landowners  at  one \ntranche  1  site  will  lose  part  of  their  customary  land,  but  are  not  expected  to  experience  other \nadverse  impacts.  The  landowners  are  expected  to  benefit  from  power  connection  and \nemployment opportunities. An indigenous peoples plan has been prepared for tranche 1 project.  \n \n31. \nTranche 1 has been classified as category B for environment, involuntary resettlement, \nand  indigenous  peoples.  Social  safeguard  documents  for  tranche  1  projects  have  been \ndisclosed on PPL's website. All safeguard documents will be disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. The \ninvestment program will support capacity within PPL to manage safeguards.   \n \nF. \n \n32.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4.  The  risks  of  the \ninvestment program have been assessed and the benefits are expected to outweigh the costs.   \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n\nRisks \n\nLack of trust by the private sector in the grid power \nsupply results in continuing self-generation. \nOther external factors will act to prevent private \nsector expansion. \nLandowner disputes delay implementation. \nPNG Power reallocates human resources to \nalternative projects. \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nOfftake agreements will be signed with major \ncustomers prior to connection to the grid. \nDemand growth will be monitored in target \nprovincial centers.  \nAdequate PMU staffing for consultation  \nAdditional staffing will be allocated to the PMU \nto ensure adequate human resources. \n \n\n                                                \n25 In 1989, ADB approved the  Divune Hydropower Project, which failed to proceed, partially due to land ownership \nissues.
