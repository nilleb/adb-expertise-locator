The  Project  is \ncofinanced by the Department for International Development of the \nUnited Kingdom (DFID) and International Development Association \n(IDA).  The  Project  will  focus  on  providing  basic  health  services  to \nthe  poor  and  disadvantaged,  including  ethnic  minorities,  women, \nand  children,  in  21  provinces.  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nfinancing  will  cover  nine  provinces  and  will  improve  access  to \nquality health services by upgrading commune health centers and \ndistrict  referral  hospitals  and  enhancing  the  skills  of  health  care \nservice  providers.  The  Project  will  support  contracting  of  health \nservices  to  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  in  11  poor \noperational  districts.  The  Project  will  also  support  public  health \npriorities, including national programs for tuberculosis (TB), malaria, \nHIV/AIDS, nutrition, and safe motherhood. The Project emphasizes \nbuilding the capacity of MOH for planning, financing, and managing \nhealth services. \n \nHealth indicators in Cambodia are among the most adverse in the \nregion.  Health  infrastructure  needs  significant  strengthening.  The \nquality  of  health  services  in  public  and  private  sectors  is  poor. \nSkills  of  health  care  providers  need  to  be  upgraded.  Although \nconsiderable progress has been made in the last 5 years, further \nsupport  and  consolidation  are  required  to  improve  access  and \nthe  poor  and \nutilization  of  health  services,  especially  by \ndisadvantaged.  The  capacity  of  MOH  to  plan,  finance,  and \nmanage  health  services  remains  weak  and  needs \nto  be \nstrengthened. \n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nObjectives  \n\nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \n\n \n\nThe  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  (i)  increase  the  institutional \ncapacity  to  plan,  finance,  and  manage  the  health  sector  in  line \nwith  the  Health  Sector  Strategic  Plan;  (ii)  develop  affordable, \ngood-quality,  basic  curative  and  preventive  health  services, \nespecially  for  women,  the  poor,  and  the  disadvantaged;  (iii) \nincrease the utilization of health services, especially by women and \nthe  poor;  and  (iv)  control  and  mitigate  the  effects  of  infectious \ndisease epidemics and of malnutrition, with emphasis on the poor. \n \nThe  Project  will  have  three  components:  (i)  improved  delivery  of \nhealth services, (ii) support to priority public health programs, and \n(iii) strengthening of institutional capacity. \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  $77  million  equivalent.  ADB  will \nprovide  a  loan  of  $20  million  equivalent  from  its  Special  Funds \nresources,  representing  26%  of  the  total  project  cost.  IDA  will \nprovide  $27  million  to  cofinance  the  Project  on  a  parallel  basis. \nDFID has agreed with ADB and IDA to jointly finance the Project \nby  providing  grants  of  about  $22  million  (\u00a315  million).  ADB  will \nadminister  $10.4  million  of  DFID  funds  using  ADB\u2019s  guidelines \nand procedures.  \n \n\nSource \n\nPercent \n\n57 \n30 \n13 \n100 \n\nADB \nDFID \nGovernment\nTotal \n\nTotal \nCost \n20.0 \n     10.4 \n       4.6 \n 35.0 \n\nForeign \nExchange\n9.2 \n10.4 \n0.0 \n19.6 \n\nADB-Administered Part of the Project \n($ million) \n \nLocal \nCost \n10.8 \n       0.0 \n       4.6 \n15.4 \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  DFID  =  Department  for  International \nDevelopment. \n \n \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  SDR15,154,000  ($20 \nmillion equivalent) from its Special Funds resources, with a maturity \nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years and an interest \ncharge  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per \nannum thereafter. \n \nUntil 30 June 2008 \n \n31 December 2007 \n\n\fImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \n\n \n\nv\n\nThe  Department  of  Planning  and  Health  Information  (DPHI)  in \nMOH  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating  the  implementation  of \nthe Project. It will be implemented under the overall guidance of a \nHealth  Sector  Steering  Committee  headed  by  the  secretary  of \nstate. The director general (health) will be the project director. The \ndirector, DPHI, will be the project coordinator, responsible for day-\nto-day  operations  of  the  Project.  Supervised  by  the  project \ncoordinator,  several  domestic  consultants  will  help  monitor  and \ncoordinate  implementation  of  the  ADB-administered  part  of  the \nProject.  \n \nMinistry of Health \n \nUnder  the  ADB-administered  part  of  the  Project,  goods  and \nservices will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement.  Civil  works  in  23  procurement  packages  will  be \nawarded  on  the  basis  of  local  competitive  bidding.  Medicines, \nsupplies, equipment, and furniture (10 packages) will be procured \non  the  basis  of  international  competitive  bidding,  international \nshopping,  local  competitive  bidding,  or  direct  purchase.  Health \nservices  in  10  operational  districts  will  be  contracted  to  NGOs \nusing procedures acceptable to ADB. \n \nFifteen  international  consultants  (138  person-months)  and  six \ndomestic  consultants  (360  person-months)  will  be  recruited  and \nwill  provide  services  in  (i)  medical  equipment  procurement  and \nmaintenance,  (ii)  contracting  services  to  NGOs,  (iii)  human \nresource  development,  (iv)  development  of  the  complementary \npackage  of  activities  and  review  of  the  minimum  package  of \nactivity modules, (v) financial management, (vi) procurement, and \n(vii) monitoring and evaluation. A firm will be recruited to prepare \ndetailed designs, undertake necessary surveys, and supervise the \ncivil  works.  The  selection  and  engagement  of  all  consultants  will \nfollow the quality and cost-based selection method in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. \n \n\n\f \n\nthe \n\nfor  92%  of \n\nfor  2.5  million  women, \n\nrural  population,  accounting \n\nADB financing of the Project will cover more than 5 million people \n(40%  of  the  total  population),  who  will  benefit  from  improved \navailability  and  quality  of  health  services.  In  particular,  project \ninterventions will improve health care coverage for the rural poor, \nwho  currently  have  very  limited  access  to  even  the  most  basic \nhealth  services.  An  estimated  4.6  million  beneficiaries  will  come \nfrom \ntotal \nbeneficiaries.  The  Project  will  improve  access  to  quality  health \nthrough  strengthened  safe-\nservice \nmotherhood  services  and \nimproved  antenatal  care  and \nemergency  obstetric  facilities.  The  Project  will  also  have  a  major \nimpact  on  improving  the  health  status  of  ethnic  minorities  in  the \nprovinces of Mondol Kiri and Rattanak Kiri, which are among the \npoorest in the country. The Project will benefit about 2 million poor \npeople.  The  poor,  who  make  up  36%  of  the  population  in  the \nproject area, capture more than 47% of the project benefits. \n \nUsing  very  conservative  assumptions, \neconomic internal rate of return of 17\u201327%. \n \ntechnical  risk. \nThe  project \nHowever, the implementation of a substantial and jointly financed \nProject poses a serious challenge to the Government\u2019s capacity to \nabsorb and properly utilize available resources. This risk is being \nminimized in the Project through strong capacity-building support, \nlargely  funded  by  DFID  grants,  and  provision  of  consulting \nservices to support procurement and disbursement.  \n \nAnother  challenge  for  the  Government  will  be  to  ensure  the \nsustainability  of \nthe  services \nintroduced,  especially  after  the  end  of  the  Project.  To  ensure \nproper maintenance of health facilities and equipment, the Project \nwill  help  MOH  prepare  maintenance  plans  and  manuals  for  each \nhealth facility and develop capacity for regular maintenance.  \n \n\nfacilities  constructed  and \n\nthe  Project  has  an \n\ninvolve  almost  no \n\ninterventions \n\nthe \n\nvi \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f  vii\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nloan  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  Health  Sector  Support  Project,1  and  (ii)  proposed \nadministration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of a grant for the Project to be provided \nby the Government of the United Kingdom. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nSector Performance \n\nincluding  contracting  of  health  services \n\n2. \nFrom extremely low levels only 10 years ago, the Cambodian private and public sector \nhealth system has developed rapidly. The achievements of the Ministry of Health (MOH) during \nthis  brief  period  have  been  encouraging.  MOH  has  developed  a  national  health  policy  that \nincludes  major  financial  reforms  (e.g.,  budgetary  reforms,  introduction  of  user  fees)  and  a \nnational  system  of  primary  health  care  coverage.  Polio  has  been  eradicated.  MOH  has  also \nmade substantial progress in other critical areas of public health, including HIV/AIDS prevention \nand  in  the  introduction  of  modern  birth-spacing  methods.  Most  commendably,  MOH  has \nremained  open  to  change  and  has  piloted  several  innovative  approaches  for  increasing  the \ncoverage  and  quality  of  health  services, \nto \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) and use of equity funds to support the poor. \n \n3. \nNotwithstanding  the  encouraging  progress  in  the  last  decade,  health  indicators  in \nCambodia are still among the worst in the Asia and Pacific region. Average life expectancy at \nbirth is estimated at only 56.4 years\u201454.4 years for men and 58.3 years for women. The infant \nmortality rate is estimated to be 95 per 1,000 live births, while the mortality rate under the age of \n5 is 124, and the maternal mortality ratio is 437 per 100,000 live births (Cambodia Demographic \nand Health Survey 2000). Rates of malnutrition are the second highest in Southeast Asia, with \nan estimated 56% of children under 5 affected by chronic malnutrition. \n \n4. \nThe  country's  progress  toward  achieving  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs) \nhas  been  slow.  Infant  and  child  mortality  rates  appear  to  have  increased  in  the  1990s.  The \ntargets  for  infant  and  under-5  mortality  rates  for  2015  are  42  and  59,  respectively,  or  half  the \npresent  levels.  Given  the  stagnant  and,  in  fact,  slightly  increasing  trends  in  these  rates  in  the \npast  few  years,  the  achievement  of  the  MDGs  will  be  difficult  unless  reproductive  and  child \nhealth services expand considerably. Similarly, the maternal mortality ratio remains high and is \nnot  falling  as  rapidly  as  required  to  achieve  the  target  of  150  by  2015.  Achieving  the  goals  of \nensuring universal access to reproductive health services and halting and reversing the spread \nof  communicable  diseases,  including  HIV/AIDS,  malaria,  and  tuberculosis  (TB),  will  also  need \naccelerated efforts. \n \nB. \n\nKey Problems and Opportunities \n\n5. \nThe  health  sector  faces  considerable  challenges  in  the  short  and  medium  term.  In \nparticular,  the  following  critical  issues  need  to  be  addressed  to  expand  and  sustain  future \nprogress in health: \n \n6. \nAccess, Utilization, and Health Benefits by the Poor. This is the major challenge for \nthe sector.  In the past 5 years, a large number of health facilities have been improved; major \n\n                                                 \n1 Project framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n\f 2 \n\ninitiatives in national health programs have been undertaken; and service capacities have been \nconsiderably  expanded.  However,  the  MOH  Health  Coverage  Plan,  which  identifies  all  health \nfacilities  required  to  provide  adequate  health  service  coverage  in  the  country,  is  only  80% \nimplemented. Many poor communes and districts still lack properly equipped health facilities of \nacceptable quality. \n \n7. \nPoor  Cambodians  have  not  proportionally  benefited  from  health  service  improvements. \nIn 1998, only 27% of poor children were fully vaccinated compared to 52% of nonpoor children. \nIndividuals  from  the  wealthiest  quintile  are  also  more  than  twice  as  likely  to  be  admitted  to  a \nhospital  as  compared  to  those  from  the  poorest  quintile,  despite  the  fact  that  the  poor  have \nworse  health.  Health  care  expenses  are  a  major  cause  of  distress  sales,  indebtedness, \nlandlessness,  and  poverty.  Poor  people\u2019s  access  to  health  services  is  constrained  by  both \nsupply  and  demand  side  factors.  The  lack  of  physical  infrastructure  in  poor  areas,  lack  of \nresources  to  pay  for  health  services,  and  poor  knowledge  about  the  need  and  availability  of \npublic  health  services  limit  poor  people\u2019s  utilization  of  health  services.  Around  21%  of  the \npoorest quintile have to travel more than 5 kilometers to seek basic health services, compared \nto 14% of the richest quintile. The quality of services in poor areas is significantly worse than in \nnonpoor areas.  \n \n8. \nMOH  instituted  user  charges  for  health  services  in  1996  through  the  Health  Finance \nCharter (HFC) in response to the unpredictable informal fees that were being charged in most \nMOH facilities and that had contributed to a marked shift from public to private providers. HFC \nauthorized  MOH  facilities  to  charge  user  fees  and  established  a  formula  for  allocating  the \nresulting  revenue.  HFC  exempted  the  poor  from  paying  user  charges.  However,  studies  show \nthat the cost of health services for the poor remains high. User fees, including exemptions for \nthe  poor,  appear  to  have  worked  well  at  health  centers  but  not  at  hospitals,  where  fees  are \nconsiderably  higher.  Hospitals  have  been  reluctant  to  publicize  their  fee  structures.  Even  in \nhospitals  where  user  fees  have  been  regularized  and  are  carefully  monitored,  the  exemption \nsystem  is  not  operating  effectively  and  facilities  do  not  have  adequate  incentives  to  treat  the \npoor. \n \n9. \nThe quality of health services needs improvement. Many rural MOH facilities have staff \nshortages, which limit access to general and specialized health services. Remote health centers \nare seriously understaffed, in midwifery and reproductive health services. A large proportion of \nhealth  providers  lack  the  necessary  curative  and  preventive  skills  to  provide  effective  health \ncare. The referral system between health centers and hospitals is poorly developed. \n \n10. \nThe  Government  piloted  the  contracting  of  health  services  to  NGOs  under  the  Basic \nHealth  Services  Project  (BHSP).2  The  results3  of  the  pilot  show  that  contracting  of  health \nservices to NGOs can effectively improve access and utilization of health services in rural areas \nin a short time, especially for the poor. This represents an important viable alternative to public \nprovision of health services, particularly in remote areas.  \n \n11. \nCommunicable  Diseases.  Communicable  diseases  remain  the  main  causes  of \nmortality and morbidity. The rural poor, particularly young children and women of reproductive \nage, are the most vulnerable. TB and malaria are the major causes of morbidity and mortality for \nadults. Cambodia is ranked as a high-burden country for TB (two thirds of the population, or 8 \n\n                                                 \n2   Loan 1447-CAM: Basic Health Services Project, for $20 million, approved on 20 June 1996. \n3   Bhushan, I; S.

Manila: ADB. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 3\n\nmillion,  are  infected).  Multi-drug-resistant  malaria  infects  a  large  number  of  people,  especially \nethnic  minorities.  Although  it  has  been  declining  in  recent  years,  HIV  prevalence  is  still  the \nhighest  in  Asia,  with  about  2.8%  of  the  adult  population  (15\u201349  years)  infected.  The  MDG  of \nhalting  and  reversing  the  spread  of  these  diseases  requires  significantly  accelerated  efforts. \nAcute  respiratory  infection,  neonatal  tetanus,  hemorrhagic  dengue  fever,  and  diarrhea, \nexacerbated  by  malnutrition,  are  the  major  causes  of  child  mortality  and  morbidity.  Three \nquarters of the entire burden of disease is preventable through low-cost interventions. \n \nLack  of  Qualified  Human  Resources.  The  lack  of  trained  health  care  providers \n12. \nremains the key constraint in improving the performance of public health providers and provision \nof services to the poor. Public providers will continue to be important sources of health services \nin  both  public  and  private  sectors.  At  the  same  time,  the  capacity  of  government  resources  to \nfinance these providers through the budget will continue to be severely constrained. Appropriate \npersonnel policies and incentive structures need to be introduced to rectify the human resource \nimbalance  between  rural  and  urban  areas.  The  MOH  Health  Sector  Strategic  Plan  2003-2007 \n(Strategic  Plan)  identifies  human  resource  development  as  one  of  the  six  key  areas  of  work. \nThe strategy calls for enhancing the skills of the workforce through quality education, expanding \nthe number and skills of midwives, and strengthening workforce planning and management to \nreduce maldistribution and ensure efficient use of human resources. \n \nLimited Institutional Capacity. Poor capacity to effectively plan, manage, and finance \n13. \nthe health sector at all levels significantly contributes to the poor performance of basic curative \nand  preventive  services.  Improving  institutional  capacity  is  critical  for  ensuring  better  use  of \nhealth  services  and  increased  benefits  to  the  population,  particularly  the  poor.  As  in  other \nsectors in the country, low salaries of civil servants and health care providers imply that the key \npersonnel in MOH have to look for other sources of income and are often not available full-time \nto  fulfill  their  responsibilities.  Establishing  an  effective  incentive  and  salary  structure  is  a \nprerequisite for strengthening the capacity of MOH.  \n \n14. \nSeveral international agencies are supporting the reconstruction and development of the \nhealth sector (Appendix 2). Official development assistance accounts for more than half of the \nconsolidated  public  funding  to  the  sector.  Major  partners  include  ADB,  Department  for \nInternational  Development  (DFID),  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development \n(USAID), Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), Japan International Cooperation \nAgency (JICA), Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), German Agency for \nTechnical Cooperation (GTZ), World Bank, World Health Organization (WHO), and other United \nNations  (UN)  agencies.  International  support\u2014chiefly  investment  for  developing  infrastructure, \nand technical assistance (TA) for developing policies and processes\u2014has played a critical role \nin developing the sector.  \n \n15.  Within  the  context  of  the  national  development  strategy,  MOH  has  developed  the \nStrategic Plan and Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). To achieve the overall goal \nof  improving  health  status  and  reducing  poverty,  the  Strategic  Plan  identifies  eight  core \nstrategies  in  the  six  priority  areas:  health  service  delivery,  behavior  change,  quality \nimprovement,  human  resource  development,  health  financing,  and  institutional  development \n(Appendix  3).  This  plan  will  form  the  basis  for  planning  and  financing  health  services  and \ndirecting  international  support  during  2003-2007.  The  Project\u2014jointly  financed  by  ADB,  DFID, \nand  the  International  Development  Association  of  the  World  Bank  Group  (IDA)\u2014will  directly \nsupport  the  Strategic  Plan  and  fill  funding  gaps  identified  in  MTEF.  The  Project  is  also  in  line \nwith ADB\u2019s operational strategy in Cambodia, which emphasizes human resource development \nas one of three pillars and identifies the health sector as one of the key sectors. \n\n\f 4 \n\nA. \n\nObjectives \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nThe  Project  will  improve  health  status,  especially  of  women,  children,  and  the  poor,  in \n\n16. \ntargeted regions of Cambodia. Specifically, the Project aims to \n \n\nincrease the institutional capacity to plan, finance, and manage the health sector \nin line with the Health Sector Strategic Plan; \n\ndevelop affordable, quality, basic curative and preventive health services for the \npopulation, especially for women, the poor, and the disadvantaged; \n\n(iii) \n\nincrease the utilization of health services, especially by women and the poor; and \n\n(iv) \n\ncontrol  and  mitigate  the  effects  of  infectious  epidemics  and  of  malnutrition  with \nemphasis on the poor and disadvantaged.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nB. \n\nScope \n\n17. \nProject Area. The Project will help strengthen health services in 21 provinces, support \nnational-level activities for communicable disease control, and strengthen the capacity of MOH. \nADB  financing  will  help  to  improve  services  in  nine  provinces\u2014Kompong  Cham,  Kompong \nChhnang,  Koh  Kong,  Mondol  Kiri,  Prey  Veng,  Rattanak  Kiri,  Krong  Prean  Sihanouk,  Svay \nRieng, and Takeo. Of these, five (Kompong Cham, Kompong Chhnang, Prey Veng, Svay Rieng, \nand Takeo) were covered under BHSP and will require only some supplementary investments. \nThe additional provinces were selected based on their incidence of poverty and prevalence of \ncommunicable  diseases.  Selection  criteria  and  health  sector-related  information  about  the \nprovinces covered by ADB is in Appendix 4. ADB financing will also cover selected regional and \ncentral  MOH  activities.  IDA  financing  will  cover  12  provinces,  national-level  communicable \ndisease  control,  and  other  selected  MOH  activities.  A  DFID  grant  will  mostly  support  national-\nlevel  capacity  building,  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E),  safe-motherhood  activities, \napproaches  for  improving  access  of  the  poor  to  health  services,  and  contracting  of  health \nservices to NGOs. A significant part of the DFID grant will be channeled through ADB or IDA. \n \n18. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  under  the  overall  framework  defined  in  the  Strategic \nPlan.  Financing  needs  will  inevitably  change  over  the  project  period  as  other  development \npartners  commit  their  funding.  Therefore,  proposed  investments  will  be  reviewed  annually \ntogether with the Government and other partners to confirm the need for planned investments. \nAs part of the Strategic Plan, MOH together with all development partners and civil society will \nundertake an annual sector review before 31 May every year. These agencies and groups will \nreview sector performance and project progress, and agree upon a 3-year rolling plan, including \na detailed operational plan for the subsequent year (Appendix 5). \n \n19. \nThe  Project  has  three  components.  The  project  design  was  based  on  an  extensive \nhealth  sector  review  and  social  assessment,  and  was  developed  with  active  participation  of \nNGOs, communities, international agencies working in the health sector and the Government. \n \n\nImproved Delivery of Health Services \n\n1. \n \n20. \nThis  component  focuses  on  improving  health  service  quality,  utilization,  and  access, \nespecially for the poor, women, and ethnic minorities in 21 project provinces. ADB will finance \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 5\n\nthese  activities  in  the  nine  target  provinces  while  IDA  support  will  focus  on  the  other  12 \nprovinces.  Specifically,  financing  will  involve    (i)  construction  and  renovation  of  health  centers \nand  health  posts,  and  renovation  of  referral  hospitals;  (ii)  provision  of  medical  and  auxiliary \nequipment  to  health  centers  and  referral  hospitals;  (iii)  training  in  the  minimum  package  of \nactivities  (MPA)  and  complementary  package  of  activities  (CPA);4  (iv)  provision  of  alternative \nmechanisms  for  delivery  of  health  services  to  the  poor  by  contracting  of  health  services  to \nNGOs in 11 of the relatively poorer operational districts and establishment of social protection \nfunds; and (v) provision of drug kits, particularly for newly constructed health centers. \n \n\na. \n\nBuilding and Civil Works \n\n \n21. \n Under  this  subcomponent,  new  and  renovated  facilities  (including  health  centers, \nreferral  hospitals,  operational  district  offices  and  drugstores)  will  be  developed  to  meet  the \nstandards of MPA and CPA services according to the Health Coverage Plan (HCP). It outlines \nthe health facilities required to provide adequate access to health services. Priority will be given \nto  health  facilities  in  remote  and  poor  areas.  The  Project  will  also  support  a  review  and \nnecessary revision of HCP to account for changes in demographics, road infrastructure, and the \nhealth system since its preparation in 1995.  \n \n22. \nThe Project will give priority to health centers, which are the first point of access to basic \nhealth  care.  Based  on  HCP,  the  Project  will  also  support  smaller  health  posts  in  sparsely \npopulated mountainous areas inhabited by ethnic minorities. ADB will finance the construction \nor  renovation  of  128  health  centers  and  9  health  posts  in  the  nine  target  provinces.  Referral \nhospitals are the first link to provide curative health services to the population and play a major \nrole in helping women with complicated deliveries. ADB will finance the renovation of 14 referral \nhospitals  and  10  emergency  facilities  in  referral  hospitals  across  the  nine  provinces.  In  these \nhospitals, special emphasis will be given to safe-motherhood facilities. The civil works program, \nwhen  completed,  will  meet  HCP  standards  and  ensure  that  all  health  centers  can  adequately \nprovide MPA services, and all referral hospitals, CPA services. \n \n23. \nDesigns  of  health  facilities  under  the  Project  will  conform  to  MOH  guidelines.  The \ndesigns  will  provide  adequate  visual  and  auditory  privacy  to  the  patients  and  also  toilets  for \nwomen  and  men.  The  facilities  will  be  simple  and  will  use  indigenous  materials  for  easy \nmaintenance.  All  facilities  will  have  adequate  medical  waste  disposal  units.  A  facilities \nmaintenance  plan  will  also  be  developed.  The  Project  will  support  the  implementation  of  the \nmaintenance plan. \n\n \nb. \n\nMedical and Auxiliary Equipment \n\n \n24. \nThe  Project  will  help  provide  and  maintain  medical  equipment  in  new  and  renovated \nhealth  centers  to  provide  MPA,  and  in  renovated  referral  hospitals  to  provide  CPA.  Service \nquality  will  also  be  improved  by  providing  MPA  kits  to  train  staff  trainers  and  health  center \npersonnel.  As  with  civil  works,  this  subcomponent  will  aim  to  complete  HCP  and  meet  the \nrequirements for providing MPA and CPA services. \n \n25.  MOH  has  developed  a  list  of  equipment  required  to  deliver  MPA  services  in  health \ncenters.  The  Project  will  support  the  provision  of  MPA  kits,  including  obstetric  equipment,  to \neach  new  health  center.  MOH  is  finalizing  CPA  service  guidelines  and  equipment  lists.  Three \n\n                                                 \n4   The MPA is provided at health centers and includes a basic set of preventive, promotive, and out-patient curative \nhealth services. The CPA is provided at referral hospitals and includes appropriate curative care for first referral. \n\n\f 6 \n\nlists  of  equipment  for  referral  hospitals  have  been  developed:  for  the  basic  set  of  activities  at \nreferral  hospitals,  referral  hospitals  providing  major  surgery,  and  the  planned  emergency \ndepartments.  The  Project  will  review  these  lists  to  ensure  that  all  appropriate  equipment  is \nincluded and then help provide the kits (including surgical and obstetric equipment) to renovated \nreferral hospitals to fill the shortage of functional equipment and enable the hospitals to deliver \nappropriate  CPA.  Auxiliary  equipment\u2014generators  and  x-ray  machines\u2014will  be  provided  to \nrenovated referral hospitals, and ambulances to five major referral hospitals. \n \nThe  capacity  for  equipment  maintenance  in  the  Hospital  Services  Department  will  be \n26. \nstrengthened  through  TA  and  training.  Procurement  and  supply  of  equipment  will  be  closely \ncoordinated with civil works. The Project will ensure that health personnel are trained to use and \nmaintain the equipment and that operational manuals are supplied in the Khmer language. The \nGovernment will provide necessary funds to maintain the equipment. \n \n\nc. \n\nTraining of Health Service Providers \n\n \nThe  Project  will  take  a  comprehensive  approach  to  the  training  of  health  center  and \n27. \nreferral  hospital  staff  to  deliver  MPA  and  CPA  services.  Training  quality,  relevance,  and \nefficiency  will  be  addressed;  the  MOH  continuing  education  system  strengthened;  and  priority \nMPA and CPA training courses implemented. Subcomponent activities will include (i) training of \n(a)  70  provincial  and  204  district  trainers  in  teaching  methods  and  curriculum  content;  (b)  100 \nprovincial  continuing  education  coordinators  in  management;  and  (c)  8,279  health  center  staff \nand  4,550  referral  hospital  staff  in  the  nine  target  provinces;  and  (ii)  follow-up  of  trainees. \nWorkers in the most remote areas will be trained to directly benefit ethnic minority populations \nand to impart reproductive health skills. Equal training opportunities will be given to women and \nethnic minorities, especially those working in very remote areas. \n \n28.  MOH  has  developed  13  MPA  training  modules  under  the  ADB-supported  Basic  Skills \nProject5  and  commenced  a  comprehensive  program  of  in-service  training  to  enable  health \ncenter staff to deliver these services. The Project will support training of health center staff in the \ntarget provinces in the priority MPA modules, including child health, reproductive health, health \npromotion, and infection control. Training will be based on regular training-needs assessments \nand  will  reflect  priorities  identified  in  the  Strategic  Plan.  Training  will  be  supported  by  the \ndevelopment  or  review  of  training  curricula  where  needed.  The  Project  will  also  seek  to \nstrengthen systems to monitor and evaluate training, quality control, and accreditation.  \n \n\nd. \n\nContracting of Services to NGOs \n\n \n29. \nAn  operations  research  pilot  of  contracting  health  services  to  NGOs  was  found  to  be \nvery efficient, equitable, and cost-effective in BHSP (Appendix 6). Building on the experience of \nthe  pilot  study,  provision  of  health  services  will  be  contracted  to  NGOs  in  11  operational \ndistricts,  selected  for  their  poverty  levels,  weak  capacity  in  service  delivery,  poor  access, \nremoteness, and ethnic minority concentration. ADB and DFID will jointly finance the contracting \nof  services  in  10  operational  districts,  while  IDA  will  support  contracting  in  1.  This  support  will \nensure quality services in poor operational districts covering about 1.8 million people, including \n800,000 poor, and build MOH capacity to manage and monitor NGO contracts. \n \n\n                                                 \n5   Loan 1368-CAM: Basic Skills Project, for $20 million, approved on 29 August 1995. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 7\n\nADB  and  DFID  will  jointly  finance  extension  of  contracting  in  four  of  the  five  pilot \n30. \noperational districts contracted under BHSP: Kompong Cham (Memut), Prey Veng (Pearaing), \nand Takeo (Kirivong and Ang Rokar). Six new operational districts will also be contracted:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nPonhea Krek in Kompong Cham Province, Preah Sdach in Prey Veng Province, \nand Rattanak Kiri and Mondol Kiri will be contracted from the second year of the \nProject.  \nBoth operational districts of Koh Kong Province (Koh Kong and Sre Ambel) will \nbe contracted from the third year of the Project. \n\n \n31. \nContracting activities include management and monitoring of contracts with contractors, \ndevelopment  and  monitoring  of  performance  contracts  with  the  relevant  provincial  health \ndepartments  (PHDs),  and  a  household  survey  to  evaluate  the  progress  and  outcomes  of \ncontracting. Staff employed under contracting will retain civil service status but will be formally \nseconded  by  the  PHD  to  the  contractor.  A  manual  for  contracting  NGOs  will  guide  MOH  in \nimplementing  the  subcomponent.  The  capacity  of  provincial  and  district  health  management \nteams  in  all  the  contracted  operational  districts  and  provinces  will  be  developed  to  manage \nhealth  services  after  the  termination  of  contracts  and  to  sustain  the  achievements  made.  A \ncommittee  on  health  sector  initiatives  in  the  Department  of  Planning  and  Health  Information \n(DPHI) will monitor the contracting of health services to NGOs and other new service delivery \nand financing initiatives by MOH. \n \n32. \nThe  Project  will  finance  establishment  of  social  protection  funds  (also  called  equity \nfunds)  in  17  operational  districts.  These  NGO-managed  funds  will  help  the  poor  pay  for \ntreatment costs incurred for a defined set of catastrophic and chronic health conditions. IDA and \nDFID will finance establishment of these funds in 7 operational districts, while ADB will support \n10 operational districts. \n \n\ne. \n\nSupplies and Drugs \n\n \n33. \nThe  Project  will  finance  drugs  and  supplies  required  to  provide  MPA.  ADB  will  finance \nMPA  start-up  drug  kits  to  new  health  centers  in  the  target  provinces.  As  women  and  children \nconstitute the vast majority of patients at the health centers, this support will provide more-than-\nproportionate  benefits  to  this  population.  MPA  start-up  drug  kits  will  be  provided  through  the \nCentral  Medical  Store  (CMS).  The  MPA  start-up  drug  kits  contain  a  6-month  supply  of  basic \ndrugs  and  contraceptives,  based  on  average  consumption  figures.  These  kits  will  ensure  that \nfacilities  become  operational  immediately  upon  opening  and  allow  them  to  determine  their \nconsumption and join the routine 3-month ordering cycle through CMS. \n \n34. \nIDA  funding  for  this  subcomponent  will  finance  activities  to  strengthen  procurement, \nstorage, and testing of drugs and pharmaceuticals. In particular, the Project will help establish a \ncentral  drug  procurement  unit,  strengthen  the  Food  and  Drug  Department,  and  upgrade  the \nNational Drug Quality Control Laboratory. IDA will finance a pilot study on using revolving funds \nfor essential drugs. \n\n \n2. \n\nSupport to Programs Addressing Public Health Priority  \n\n \n35. \nThe  Project  will  finance  national  programs  to  control  and  prevent  communicable \ndiseases,  including  HIV/AIDS,  malaria,  and  TB.  The  Project  will  also  support  important  public \nhealth activities, including safe motherhood, immunization, and nutrition. This component will fill \ncritical financing gaps in management and inputs for public health priority programs.  \n\n\f 8 \n\n \n36. \nThe  proposed  investments  will  be  closely  coordinated  with  the  investments  by  other \ninternational  agencies,  including  the  Global  Fund  for  AIDS,  TB  and  Malaria  (GFATM);  DFID; \nUSAID; and UN agencies. A significant amount of support for priority public health programs is \nalready  committed  by  several  agencies.  ADB  is  providing  substantial  financing  for  prevention \nand  control  of  HIV/AIDS,6  and  GFATM  and  USAID  recently  approved  large  programs  for \nHIV/AIDS. Therefore, the Project will be the financier of the last resort and ensure that critical \nareas  of  all  priority  programs  are  fully  funded.  Financing  for  this  component  will  largely  come \nfrom  IDA.  DFID  will  support  safe-motherhood  investments.  Recognizing  the  persistently  high \nlevels of maternal mortality, DFID funding will complement the planned investments under the \nProject to ensure a comprehensive response to high maternal mortality. \n\n3. \n\nStrengthening Institutional Capacity  \n\n \n37. \nThe  Project  will  help  strengthen  institutional  capacity  in  management,  planning,  and \nevaluation at the national, provincial, and district levels. The support will improve the capacity of \nMOH  to  undertake  health  sector  reforms  in  accordance  with  the  Strategic  Plan,  including  the \ncapacity  for  evidence-based  planning,  health  service  management  and  financing,  and  M&E. \nThis component will be closely coordinated with other development partners, especially WHO. \nADB financing under this component will support (i) strengthening of management capacity and \nsupervision  at  the  provincial  and  district  levels  in  the  nine  target  provinces,  (ii)  capacity  for \nworkforce  planning  and  management  in  MOH,  (iii)  training  capacity  at  regional  and  national \nlevels, and (iv) M&E. \n \n\na. \n\nHealth Service Planning and Management Capacity Strengthening \n\n \n38. \nADB will finance the training of 123 provincial, district, and referral hospital managers in \nthe  nine  target  provinces  in  health  service  management,  including  planning,  monitoring,  and \nevaluation.  Equal  opportunities  will  be  given  to  competent  women  and  ethnic  minority \nmanagers.  The  Project  will  also  support  and  expand  the  MOH  program  of  supervision,  and \nfinance  the  development  of  annual  provincial  and  district  plans.  Community  participation  in \nhealth  service  management  will  be  supported  through  health  center  committees  that  equally \nrepresent women and men. \n \n\nb. \n\nHuman Resource Planning and Management Capacity Strengthening \n\n \n39. \nThe Project will help strengthen MOH capacity for human resource policy, planning, and \nmanagement  through  a  range  of  interventions.  Functional  analysis  is  the  first  step  in \nrationalizing staff deployment and addressing critical staff needs in rural and remote areas, and \nwill be supported in the first year of the Project. TA will be provided for MOH to use the findings \nto  develop  a  rational  human  resources  policy,  and  prepare  the  second  health  workforce \ndevelopment plan. The Project will support specific strategies to solve staff and skill shortages \nin  very  remote  areas,  including  the  development  of  a  primary  nurse  training  course  for  the \nnortheastern  provinces,  with  scholarships  for  participants  from  communities  without  adequate \nhealth  services.  The  Project  will  also  help  the  Government  review  and  improve  the  incentive \nstructure for health providers working in rural and remote areas. \n \n\n                                                 \n6   ADB.  2001.

Activities  include  the  implementation  of  an  accreditation  system  for  training  courses, \nmanagement training for selected staff, quarterly meetings of training providers and managers, \nrefresher training for teachers and clinical instructors, and upgrading of the qualifications of key \nnurse teachers to enable them to provide educational and professional leadership. \n \n\nc. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation  \n\n \n41. \nThe Project will support M&E activities to (i) increase the capacity of key stakeholders to \ndesign  and  implement  policies  and  programs  on  the  basis  of  evidence;  (ii)  measure  the \nattainment  of  sector-wide  improvements  in  managing  resources,  delivering  services,  and \nimproving  health  status;  and  (iii)  produce  required  information  on  project  implementation.  The \nProject  will  help  build  capacity  for  M&E  and  undertake  specific  M&E  in  line  with  the  Strategic \nPlan. In particular, the support will facilitate monitoring of the health status of, and use of health \nservices  by,  disadvantaged  groups,  including  women,  ethnic  minorities,  and  the  poor.  The \ntraining,  consumer  and  household  surveys, \nProject  will \nstrengthening  of  the  health  information  system  through  use  of  information  technology,  and \nrationalization  of  the  surveillance  system.  Activities  for  annual  reviews  envisioned  in  the \nStrategic Plan and midterm project review will be financed.  \n \n42. \nA set of measurable indicators\u2014input, process, output, outcome\u2014has been developed \nfor  each  strategic  priority  identified  in  the  Strategic  Plan  (Appendix  7).  Baseline  values  and \ntargets  for  these  indicators  will  be  agreed  upon  during  the  first  year  of  the  Project.  ADB  and \nDFID will jointly finance this subcomponent. \n \n\nfinance  consulting  services, \n\nd. \n\nProject Management  \n\n \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  through  the  existing  MOH  structure.  Domestic \n43. \nconsultants  will  help  MOH  cope  with  the  increased  workload.  The  Project  will  help  strengthen \nMOH's  capacity  for  procurement,  disbursement,  and  project  management.  The  Project  will \nfinance  the  equipment,  furniture,  and  consulting  services  required  for  effective  implementation \nand M&E of project activities. An international procurement and disbursement specialist will be \nfinanced  for  24  person-months.  These  consultants  will  also  contribute  to  longer-term  capacity \nbuilding of the planning and budget and finance departments of MOH. Contract staff will support \nvarious MOH departments in project implementation. \n\nC. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n \n\n44. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  $77  million  equivalent.  The  Government  has  requested \nADB  to  provide  a  loan  of  SDR15.15  million  ($20  million  equivalent)  from  its  Special  Funds \nresources,  representing  26%  of  the  total  project  cost.  IDA  will  provide  $27  million  for  parallel \nproject  cofinancing.  DFID  has  agreed  with  ADB  and  IDA  to  jointly  finance  the  Project  by \nproviding  grants  of  about  $22  million  (\u00a315  million).  ADB  will  administer  $10.4  million  of  DFID \nfunds  using  ADB  guidelines  and  procedures.  IDA  will  administer  $1.8  million  of  DFID  funds. \nDFID will directly manage the grants to the Government for the remaining $10 million. \n \n \n\n\f0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n\n9.80 \n1.24 \n0.35 \n11.39 \n\n3.00 \n3.00 \n14.39 \n\n \n\n 10 \n\n \nItem \n \nADB-Administered Part \nADB \nDFID \nGovernment \nSubtotal \nIDA-Administered Part \nIDA \nDFID \nGovernment \nSubtotal \nDFID-Administered Parta \nDFID \nSubtotal \nTotal \n\n13.85 \n7.99 \n3.48 \n25.32 \n\n13.20 \n0.60 \n2.26 \n16.06 \n\n0.00 \n0.00 \n41.38 \n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates and Sources of Funds  \n($ million) \n \nProject Component \n\n \n\nService \nDelivery \n\nPublic  \nHealth \n\nCapacity \nBuilding \n\nUnallocated \n \n\n \n\nTotal \n \n\n20.00 \n10.36 \n4.63 \n35.00 \n\n27.00 \n1.84 \n3.16 \n32.00 \n\n10.00 \n10.00 \n77.00 \n\n2.13 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n2.13 \n\n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n\n2.50 \n2.50 \n4.63 \n\n4.02 \n2.37 \n1.15 \n7.55 \n\n4.00 \n0.00 \n0.55 \n4.55 \n\n4.50 \n4.50 \n16.60 \n\n a  DFID  will  allocate  about  $4.5  for  institutional  development  (including  performance-based  incentives)  through  a \nfirm  contracted  through  a  competitive  process,  and  $3.0  million  for  safe  motherhood,  for  which  implementation \narrangement will be designed in 2003. \n\n \n45. \nThe  ADB-administered  part  of  the  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $35  million  equivalent. \nThe Government will provide counterpart funds of $4.63 million equivalent and DFID will provide \nuntied  grants  of  $10.36  million  (Appendix  8).  ADB  will  finance  the  major  part  of  the  capital \nexpenditures  for  its  components  while  the  Government  will  provide  the  counterpart  funds  to \ncover  a  part  of  the  project  implementation  cost  and  capital  expenditures  as  necessary.  DFID \ncofinancing will be used to contract NGOs, build capacity of MOH, and M&E. \n\nIt is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $20 million equivalent from its Special Funds \n46. \nresources to finance 26% of the total project cost and 57% of the ADB-administered part of the \nProject  (Table  2).  The  loan  would  cover  $9.2  million  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost  (including \ninterest on the loan) and $10.8 million equivalent, or 70% of local currency costs. The term of \nthe proposed loan will be 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge \nof 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter.  \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \n\nSource \n\nADB \nDFID \nGovernment \nTotal \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nForeign  \nExchange \n9.2 \n10.4 \n0.0 \n19.6 \n\nLocal  \nCost \n10.8 \n0.0 \n4.6 \n15.4 \n\nTotal  \nCost \n20.0 \n10.4 \n4.6 \n35.0 \n\n% \n\n57 \n30 \n13 \n100 \n\n \n \n47. \nThe provision of financing for the local currency cost is considered justified under ADB\u2019s \nlocal currency financing policy. Cambodia needs a large investment program to rehabilitate and \nupgrade  dilapidated  health  sector  infrastructure.  The  need  to  generate  domestic  resources  to \nfinance investments to sustain economic growth is well recognized. However, it will take some \ntime before the country can develop the necessary resource base to finance the required level \nof  investment  without  external  finance.  Under  the  current  circumstances,  a  large  investment-\n\n\f \n\n \n\n 11\n\nsavings  gap  will  continue,  hindering  in  particular  poverty  reduction  and  human  development \nprograms  that  have  a  large  local  currency  component.  Consistent  with  ADB  policy,  a  higher \npercentage of local cost financing for this poverty reduction project is thus justified. \n \nD. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1.  \n\nProject Management \n\n \n48.  MOH  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  Project.  DPHI  will  be  responsible  for \ncoordinating  project  implementation.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  under  the  overall \nguidance  of  a  Health  Sector  Steering  Committee  headed  by  a  secretary  of  state.  The  director \ngeneral  (health)  will  be  the  project  director.  The  DPHI  director  will  be  the  project  coordinator, \nresponsible  for  day-to-day  operations.  The  project  coordinator  will  be  assisted  by  a  small \nsecretariat and several domestic consultants and contracted staff to monitor and coordinate the \nimplementation  of  the  ADB-administered  part  of  the  Project  (Appendix  9).  Staff  will  have \nexpertise  in  project  management,  contracting  of  health  services,  management,  and  human \nresource development, and will liaise directly with the related MOH departments and PHDs, and \nundertake frequent field monitoring.  \n \n49. \nDisbursement and procurement for the Project will be done by the MOH Department of \nBudget  and  Finance  (DBF).  Procurement  of  NGO  contracting  and  consulting  services  will  be \ndone  by  DPHI.  To  ensure  adequate  linkages  between  the  technical,  procurement,  and \ndisbursement functions, a working group will be established, chaired by the project coordinator \nand composed of staff from DPHI and DBF. This group will meet weekly to review the status of \ntechnical, \nvarious \nadministrative, and financial personnel associated with the Project. \n \n\nimplementation  actions  and  ensure  close  coordination  among \n\nthe \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years,  from  January  2003  to  December  2007. \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n \n50. \nThe project implementation schedule is in Appendix 10. \n \n \n\nProcurement of Goods and Services \n\n3. \n\n \n\n51. \nAll  ADB-financed  procurement  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement.  The  MOH  Procurement  Unit  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  procuring  goods, \nwith  technical  guidance  from  the  project  coordinator/deputy  project  director  and  relevant  staff \nfrom DPHI, and support from a firm that will act as civil works manager (CWM). Procurement of \nconsulting  services  and  NGO  contracting  of  health  services  will  be  carried  out  by  DPHI  under \nthe guidance of the project coordinator. Where the procurement is done by other agencies such \nas  provinces,  the  project  coordinator  and  DPHI  staff  will  ensure  that  the  process  follows  ADB \nguidelines. A list of indicative procurement packages is in Appendix 11. \n \n\na. \n\nCivil Works \n\n \n52.  Most civil works will consist of building health centers and referral hospitals. To allow for \nadequate  supervision  of  construction,  and  due  to  the  dispersed  locations  of  these  structures, \nhealth  units  will  be  limited  to  less  than  20  packages  each,  not  exceeding  $500,000.  As  the \nfacilities will be small and scattered, the civil works are unlikely to attract foreign bidders. Hence, \nit  is  proposed  that  local  competitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  be  employed  for \nthese structures. Following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, DPHI will recruit CWM \n\n\f 12 \n\nto  finalize  designs,  develop  the  program  of  works,  develop  bid  documents,  and  help  the \nProcurement Unit in tendering, contracting construction work, and monitoring construction and \nrenovation.  \n \n\nEquipment and Materials \n\nb. \n \n\n \n\nc. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n53. \nProcurement of equipment and materials will be done by DBF. Medical equipment and \nsupply  packages  for  health  centers  and  referral  hospitals  will  be  procured  under  international \ncompetitive  bidding  if  the  cost  of  the  package  exceeds  $500,000.  Packages  under  $500,000 \nmay  be  procured  using  international  shopping,  direct  purchase,  or  local  competitive  bidding. \nDrugs will be procured using international competitive bidding procedures. Office equipment and \nvehicles, estimated to cost less than $100,000, will be procured under international shopping or \ndirect  purchase.  Office  furniture,  motorcycles,  and  bicycles,  estimated  to  cost  less  than \n$100,000, will be purchased using local competitive bidding or direct purchase procedures. \n \n \n \n54. \nInternational  and  domestic  consultants  to  help  implement  the  project  will  be  recruited \nfollowing the quality- and cost-based selection method in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and other procedures acceptable to ADB for the recruitment of domestic \nconsultants. Fifteen international consultants (138 person-months) and six domestic consultants \n(360 person-months) will be recruited on an individual basis. CWM will be recruited following the \nsimplified  technical  proposal.  The  consultants  will  provide  services  in  (i)  medical  equipment \nprocurement  and  maintenance;  (ii)  contracting  services  to  NGOs;  (iii)  human  resource \ndevelopment; (iv) development of the CPA modules and revision of MPA modules; (v) financial \nmanagement;  (vi)  procurement  and  disbursement;  (vii)  M&E;  and  (viii)  civil  works  design, \nsurvey, and supervision. DPHI will procure consulting services. Consulting service requirements \nand brief terms of reference are in Appendix 12. \n \n \n \n55. \nContracts  for  the  provision  of  health  services  will  be  competitively  awarded  following \nprocurement  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  A  single  organization  may  bid  on  any  number  of \ncontracts, but each bid will be evaluated independently against other bids for the same contract. \nBids will be evaluated based on (i) organizational capacity (expertise and resources to provide \nthe services), (ii) strength of the technical proposal, and (iii) cost. Contractors able to contribute, \nin kind or in cash, from other sources will get additional points, as will international bidders that \nhave a local partner agency, to develop local capacity and a pool of potential Cambodian health \nservice contractors. \n \nContracts  will  be  implemented  on  the  basis  of  fixed  price,  with  quarterly  progress \n56. \npayments  made  contingent  on  satisfactory  contractor  performance.  Contracts  will  specify \nobjectively measurable service delivery goals, a minimal acceptable level of improvement, and \nfinancial  penalties  that  will  be  incurred  if  the  minimal  level  is  not  met.  The  contracts  will  be \nawarded only to NGOs from ADB's member countries. \n \n \n \n57.  MOH  will  take  advance  action  to  expedite  project  implementation,  particularly  by  (i) \nshortlisting  firms  to  carry  out  engineering  design  and  construction  supervision;  (ii)  shortlisting \nindividual  consultants  for  technical  assignments;  (iii)  inviting  expressions  of  interest  and \n\nAdvance Action and Retroactive Financing \n\nContracting of NGOs \n\nd. \n\n4. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 13\n\n5. \n\nAccounts and Auditing \n\ncapability  statements  from  NGOs  for  contracting  of  health  services;  (iv)  providing  1-year \ncontracts to the four existing contractors in Memut, Pearaing, Ang Rokar, and Kirivong following \nADB procedures; and (v) identifying the roles, structure, and functions of the steering committee \nand various MOH departments involved in project implementation. The Project will retroactively \nfinance  the  1-year  contracts  to  NGOs  working  in  the  four  operational  districts  under  BHSP,  to \nallow  continuation  of  services  until  the  new  contracts  are  signed.  The  development  and \nfinalization  of  1-year  contracts  will  follow  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  In  particular,  the \nexisting NGOs will be considered only if they are performing satisfactorily and agree to contracts \nbased  on  the  originally  negotiated  rates  with  correction  for  inflation.  Retroactive  financing  will \nnot exceed 10% of the ADB loan ($2 million) and will apply to contracts finalized after 16 August \n2002.  However,  ADB\u2019s  concurrence  in  advance  action  and  retroactive  financing  does  not \ncommit ADB to finance the related expenditure under the Project or to finance the Project. \n \n \n \n58.  MOH will maintain records and accounts to identify goods and services financed by loan \nproceeds.  MOH  will  follow  the  Project  Accounting  Manual  issued  by  the  Ministry  of  Economy \nand  Finance  (MEF)  on  23  June  1998,  and  other  instructions  and  modifications  issued \nsubsequently.  MOH  will  (i)  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  ADB  administered  part  of  the \nProject; (ii) ensure that accounts and financial statements are audited annually, in accordance \nwith sound accounting principles by independent auditors acceptable to ADB; and (iii) furnish to \nADB,  not  later  than  9  months  after  the  close  of  each  fiscal  year,  certified  copies  of  audited \naccounts and financial statements, and the report of the auditor on these.  \n \n \n \n59.  Withdrawal  of  loan  proceeds  will  be  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook,  of  January  2001  and  as  amended  from  time  to  time.  The  imprest  account  and \nstatement of expenditure procedures will be used. An imprest account will be established within \n1  month  of  loan  effectiveness  in  a  reputable  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB.  The \nstatement  of  expenditures  procedures  will  be  used  to  reimburse,  liquidate,  and  replenish  the \nimprest  account  for  eligible  expenditures  not  exceeding  $50,000  per  payment.  Second-\ngeneration imprest accounts may be opened in the nine provinces. The ceiling for the imprest \naccount  and  all  second-generation  imprest  accounts  in  aggregate  will  be  $2  million.  These \naccounts  will  be  replenished  through  the  imprest  account  on  submission  of  full  supporting \ndocuments  for  the  expenditure.  Provinces  will  follow  clear  guidelines  for  procurement  and \ndisbursement as stated in health management agreements between the provinces and MOH. \n \n\nDisbursement Procedures \n\n6. \n\n7. \n\nReporting \n\n \nDPHI  will  prepare  project  progress  reports  every  6  months  and  submit  them  to  ADB \n60. \nwithin 1 month of the end of each period. The reports will be prepared in a format acceptable to \nADB,  DFID,  and  IDA,  and  will  include  (i)  progress  made  against  established  targets,  including \naspects of quality; (ii) delays and problems encountered, and actions taken to resolve them; (iii) \ncompliance with loan covenants; (iv) proposed program of activities to be undertaken during the \nnext 6 months; (v) expected progress during the succeeding period; and (vi) maintenance and \nrepair activities undertaken on health facilities. Within 3 months of the physical completion of the \nProject,  the  Government  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report  on  the \nexecution of the Project, including the costs and compliance with loan covenants. \n \n \n\n\f 14 \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n61. \nThe  Government,  ADB,  DFID,  and  IDA  will  jointly  review  the  project  progress  at  least \ntwice  every  year,  including  once  in  conjunction  with  the  annual  review  of  the  Strategic  Plan. \nWhile the Project will be regularly reviewed, the Government and the three cofinanciers will also \nundertake  a  joint  midterm  review  of  the  Project  during  the  third  year  of  implementation.  The \nmidterm  review  will  (i)  examine  the  scope,  design,  implementation  arrangements,  and  other \nrelevant issues in light of the Government\u2019s development strategies and the policy framework; \n(ii) examine progress in achieving the measurable objectives of the Project; (iii) identify changes \nsince the time of appraisal relating to sectoral issues and resource management and allocation, \nand  reassess  their  impact  with  regard  to  future  project  implementation  and  sustainability;  (iv) \nassess  implementation  performance  against  appropriate  projections;  (v)  review  and  establish \ncompliance  with  various  loan  covenants;  (vi)  identify  problems  and  constraints;  and  (vii) \nformulate appropriate recommendations for corrective action. \n\n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation System \n\n \n62. \nThe Project has selected a list of verifiable indicators for M&E. Baseline values for these \nindicators  will  be  estimated  using  data  from  the  2002  National  Health  Survey  and  the  2000 \nCambodia Demographic and Health Survey. The final values of the indicators will be estimated \nfrom data from a household survey, planned under the Project in 2006. \n \n63. \nAs part of the sector-wide management, sector performance will be monitored annually, \nbased  on  an  agreed-upon  set  of  indicators  collected  annually  through  surveys,  studies,  and \nservice statistics. Analysis of the indicators will be disaggregated by socioeconomic level, sex, \nand ethnicity, where appropriate and useful. The Project will monitor the environmental impact \nof the interventions by observing waste disposal and by evaluating the water quality of randomly \nselected wells near the referral hospitals renovated under the Project. The final evaluation of the \nProject will be made by an independent firm under the supervision of MOH. Data collection will \nbe carried out by MOH but analysis and reporting will be under the responsibility of the firm. To \nmonitor project indicators, DPHI will have overall responsibility for data collection, analysis, and \nreporting  to  all  interested  parties,  including  ADB.  Service  delivery  and  health  impact  will  be \nmonitored  through  regular  reports  and  routine  data  collected  through  the  Health  Management \nInformation System. Qualitative methods to assess beneficiary satisfaction will be used for the \nmidterm review and at the end of the Project. \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nProject Benefits \n\n64. \nInvestments  proposed  under  the  Project  will  provide  significant  benefits  to  people  and \ninstitutions.  The  Project  will  improve  the  coverage  and  quality  of  the  health  system,  not  only \ndirectly  improving  the  welfare  of  the  beneficiaries,  but  also  contributing  to  prospects  for \neconomic  growth,  human  capital  of  the  poor,  and  poverty  reduction.  Poverty  and  health  are \nclosely interrelated, as poverty can lead to health problems while illness often leads families into \npoverty.  The  Project  will  strengthen  policymaking  and  governance  in  the  health  sector  at  a \ncritical time as Cambodia accelerates decentralization. The Project will serve as a springboard \nto  strengthen  coordination  and  MOH's  capacity  to  lead  and  institute  reforms  for  efficient, \nsustainable, and equitable health services.   \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 15\n\nImproved Coverage. The ADB-administered part of the Project will cover more than 5 \n65. \nmillion people (40% of the total population), who will benefit from the improved availability and \nquality  of  health  services.  Project  interventions  will  improve  health  care  coverage  for  the  rural \npoor,  who  have  very  limited  access  to  even  the  most  basic  health  services.  An  estimated  4.6 \nmillion (92%) beneficiaries will come from the rural population. The Project will improve access \nto  quality  health  service  for  2.5  million  women  by  strengthening  safe-motherhood  services, \nimproving antenatal care, and providing emergency obstetric facilities. The Project will also have \na major impact on improving the health status of ethnic minorities in the provinces of Mondol Kiri \nand Rattanak Kiri, which are among the poorest in the country. The Project includes measures \ndesigned to bridge the linguistic and cultural gaps that often hinder ethnic minorities\u2019 access to \nthe  health  system.  By  helping  expand  and  strengthen  MPA  and  CPA,  the  Project  will  ensure \nthat health centers and referral hospitals have the capacity to provide primary and preventative \nhealth  care  services.  The  use  of  contracting  in  remote  and  poor  operational  districts  will  bring \nhealth services to deprived areas.  \n \n66. \nPoverty Reduction and Increased Equity. The ADB project provinces are among the \npoorest in the country and generally have worse health and nonmonetary indicators of poverty \nthan the national average. Project investments are designed to provide more-than-proportionate \nbenefits to the poor. The poor make up 36% of the project area population but capture at least \n47%  of  the  project  benefits.  The  Project  supports  the  extension  of  services  to  the  poor  by \nconstructing and renovating health facilities, improving providers' skills, and supporting community \nparticipation in rural and remote areas. The Project\u2019s support to contracting of health services in \nremote  and  poorly  served  operational  districts  further  enhances  the  pro-poor  bias  of  the \ninvestments.  The  Project  also  benefits  the  near-poor,  who  make  up  about  40%  of  the \npopulation.  One  health  shock  is  often  sufficient  to  push  an  entire  household  into  poverty.  The \nProject  will  also  provide  a  platform  for  instituting  several  pro-poor  policies  in  MOH,  including \nrationalization  of  user  charges,  pro-poor  health  sector  financing,  mainstreaming  of  poverty \nbased planning and M&E. \n \n67. \nSignificant  Economic  Returns.  Economic  analysis  of  the  project  intervention  shows \nthat even at conservative assumptions, the Project will have an economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR)  of  27%  (Appendix  13).  Even  when  the  assumptions  regarding  project  gains  are \nextremely  pessimistic,  the  EIRR  does  not  go  below  17%.  Health  service  improvements  in  the \nproject area provide three types of economic benefits to the population: (i) health improvements \nthat lead to better productivity and learning outcomes at school, (ii) reduction in days lost due to \nsickness  or  health  care,  and  (iii)  savings  in  out-of-pocket  expenditure  on  health  care  due  to \nbetter  and  more  efficient  health  services.  The  analysis  could  not  take  into  account  the  first \nstream of benefits because of the difficulty in quantifying the gains in health and improvement in \nproductivity.  The  analysis  used  data  from  BHSP  to  quantify  the  likely  impact  of  the  Project  in \nreducing  lost  days  due  to  sickness  and  health  care  and  out-of-pocket  expenditure.  A  more \ncomprehensive  analysis  (including  productivity  gains)  of  economic  benefits  would  likely  yield  a \nsignificantly higher EIRR. \n \n68. \nIncreased Health System Efficiency. Increased efficiency in service delivery, increased \nstaff knowledge and skills, and improved quality of services will all help provide better value for \nmoney to health care consumers. By contracting  health  services,  the  Project  will  help  promote \nappropriate and effective health care and improved, more efficient financing of health services. \nSupport  to  functional  analysis  and  the  Health  Workforce  Development  Plan  (HWDP)  will  help \nremove inefficiencies in the deployment of health personnel. The Project will help increase the \nrelevance  and  efficiency  of  the  health  system  at  provincial  and  district  levels  by  building  the \ncapacity  of  managers.  Managers  will  develop  skills  to  better  identify  specific  health  needs  in \n\n\f 16 \n\ntheir  area  and  to  address  them  within  the  context  of  national  policy  and  strategy.  Increased \ncapacity at the health centers and operational districts will enable gradual absorption of vertical \ndisease  management  approaches  into  the  integrated  system  with  considerable  cost-efficiency \nsavings. \n \n69. \nStrengthened  Health  Sector  Governance.  The  Project  will  help  the  Government \nimprove  the  efficiency  of  resource  allocation  and  increase  cost-effectiveness  in  the  health \nsector.  According  to  Cambodia  Demographic  and  Health  Survey  2000,  health  care  resources \nare  distributed  inefficiently  among  Government  ($2.50  per  capita  per  annum),  international \nagencies  ($6.30),  and  private  out-of-pocket  expenditure  ($25.90).  Within  the  health  sector, \nprimary  health  care  does  not  receive  its  due  share.  The  Project  seeks  to  rectify  these \ninefficiencies. The Project is Cambodia\u2019s first attempt at sector-wide management in the health \nsector. The preparation of the Strategic Plan is an important first step in setting overall priorities. \nSupport  and  constant  review  of  the  Strategic  Plan  by  all  stakeholders  under  the  Project  will \nfurther help the process. The Project will support MOH in preparing and monitoring annual plans \nto operationalize the Strategic Plan. TA provided under the Project will enhance MOH\u2019s capacity \nto  undertake  evidence-based  decision  making.  The  Project  will  strengthen  MOH  capacity  to \nplan, finance and manage the provision of health services. Additional training and TA provided \nat the provincial and district levels will further improve capacity for planning and management at \ndecentralized levels. The Project will also ensure better community feedback into planning and \nmonitoring of health services through consumer surveys and participation of civil society.   \n \nB. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures \n\n1. \n\nEnvironment \n\n \n \n70. \nThe  Project  will  have  no  significant  adverse  environmental  effect.  All  large  civil  works \nentail rehabilitation of existing structures. The new structures are small and not likely to disturb \nthe environment or natural resources. Handling and disposal of hazardous medical waste such \nas syringes and needles will be addressed in the design and operation of the health centers.  \n \n \n \n71. \nThe  Project  does  not  have  any  adverse  social  impact  (Appendix  14).  A  detailed  social \nanalysis was undertaken during the project preparation. The results of the analysis were fed into \nthe  project  design  to  ensure  that  disadvantaged  populations  obtain  the  optimum  benefits  from \nthe Project. No land acquisition or resettlement is planned under the Project. New structures will \nbe  built  on  government  land  already  allocated  for  existing  health  facilities.  Some  social  issues \naddressed by the project design are as follows: \n\nSocial Analysis \n\n2. \n\n \na. \n\nPoverty \n\n \n72. \nThe  project  design  specifically  addresses  the  constraints  often  faced  by  the  poor  on \nseeking health care services. The Project will (i) focus on primary health care, which provides \nmore-than-proportionate benefits to the poor; (ii) invest largely in rural health facilities used by \nthe  poor;  (iii)  focus  on  prevention  and  treatment  of  common  communicable  diseases,  which \nmostly  afflict  the  poor;  (iv)  contract  out  health  services  in  11  relatively  poorer  operational \ndistricts to NGOs, a strategy that has been shown to benefit the poor; (v) help redress the staff \ngap  and  skills  of  providers  working  in  poor  areas;  (vi)  help  establish  social  protection  funds, \nwhich  will  directly  help  the  poor  deal  with  catastrophic  and  chronic  health  conditions;  (vii) \nencourage  participation  of  the  poor  in  managing  health  services  through  support  to  health \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 17\n\ncenter  committees;  and  (viii)  mainstream  poverty  issues  into  planning,  budgeting,  and \nmonitoring of health services. \n \n\nb. \n\nEthnic Minorities \n\n \n73. \nTwo project provinces, Mondol Kiri and Rattanak Kiri, are home to a significant number \nof ethnic minorities. Their health status is the most challenging among all target groups due to \ngeneral  poverty,  difficulties  in  outreach,  lack  of  health  awareness,  high  illiteracy  rates,  and,  in \nmany cases, culturally insensitive health services. Therefore, the Ethnic Minorities Development \nPlan (EMDP) has been prepared in accordance with ADB guidelines and will be implemented as \npart of the Project (Appendix 15). \n \n\nc. \n\nGender \n\n \n74. \nAll project subcomponents will target women and girls, who will comprise more than 50% \nof project beneficiaries. One major project priority is safe motherhood and improving the access \nto  quality  reproductive  health  care.  Since  rural  women  perceive  the  opportunity  cost  of  using \nhealth  services  as  high,  health  services  must  be  brought  closer  to  them  by  improving  service \nquality  and  reduced  costs  and  by  generating  demand  for  services.  The  Project  will  aim  to \nprovide more-than-proportionate training opportunities to women (Appendix 15).  \n \nC. \n\nRisks \n\n75. \nThe  project  interventions  involve  almost  no  technical  risk.  The  technologies  and \ntechniques  for  providing  effective  primary  health  care  are  well  understood  and  tested. \nCambodia\u2019s experience in the sector has been highly encouraging, demonstrating feasibility of \nimplementation and sustained commitment of the Government. However, the implementation of \na  substantial  and  jointly  financed  project  poses  a  serious  challenge  at  the  central,  provincial, \nand  district  levels  to  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  to  absorb  and  properly  utilize  available \nresources. Although it has successfully implemented BHSP, MOH still has weak implementation \ncapacity, poorly motivated staff due to low salaries, and a weak financial managerial structure. \nThese  risks  are  being  minimized  through  strong  capacity-building  support,  largely  funded  by \nDFID,  and  provision  of  consulting  services  to  support  procurement  and  disbursement.  DFID \nsupport  under  the  Project  for  an  interim  strategy  as  well  as  a  comprehensive  solution  to  the \nproblem of low salaries will also alleviate these risks.  \n \nAnother  challenge  for  the  Government  will  be  the  sustainability  of  the  facilities \n76. \nconstructed  and \nthe  Project  ends.  Financial \nintroduced,  especially  after \nsustainability of the investments is contingent on the continued provision of an adequate budget \nfor the health sector, which the Government has been able to increase in recent years. Its ability \nto do so in the future depends on making better macroeconomic and fiscal progress. To ensure \nproper  maintenance  of  health  facilities  and  equipment,  the  Project  will  help  MOH  prepare \nmaintenance  plans  for  all  health  facilities.  The  Government  has  assured  that  it  will  at  least \nmaintain  the  proportion  of  the  national  budget  currently  allocated  to  the  health  sector  and \nsufficiently increase the budget for maintenance for equipment and health facilities. \n \n77. \nThe  model  of  contracting  out  services  has  been  tested  in  Cambodia  and  showed \nimpressive results in the pilot districts. The risks in the Project relate to both the capacity of this \nmodel  to  work  on  a  larger  scale  \u2013  a  province  rather  than  an  operational  district,  and  to  the \nchances  that  any  improvements  achieved  will  not  be  sustained  once  the  externally  supported \ncontract  ends.  These  risks  have  been  minimized  through  intensive  consultations  with \n\nthe  services \n\n\f 18 \n\nA. \n \n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\npolicymakers at provincial and national levels and modifying the design of the model to include \nan exit strategy. \n \n78.  With  elections  in  Cambodia  scheduled  for  July  2003,  it  is  likely  that  there  will  be \ndistraction of efforts at senior levels and limited scope for difficult reforms. However, the Project \nhas been designed to use this period to plan and lay foundations for future implementation and \nmost support in this period will be in the form of TA. This will minimize the risk of diversion of \nresources or lack of decision-making. \n \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nThe  Government  and  MOH  have  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the \n\n79. \nstandard assurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nThe Government and MOH will ensure that no later than 30 April 2003 and in each year \nthereafter, an annual review of the health sector is organized. Documents to be prepared \nas  the  basis  for  the  review  will  be  circulated  to  ADB,  DFID,  and  IDA  no  later  than  2 \nweeks  before  the  scheduled  review  and  should  include  (a)  a  review  of  sector \nperformance  (summarizing  sector  performance  indicators  and  trends,  implementation \nprogress of agreed-upon policy measures, and institutional reforms); (b) a review of past \nprogress  and  future  plans  to  implement  the  health  sector  institutional  capacity-building \nplan and the health infrastructure development plan; (c) a procurement audit and details \nof government budget and actual expenditure in the previous year; and (d) a draft 3-year \nrolling plan for health sector development, comprising a detailed description of activities, \ncosts, and sources of funds for the first year. No later than 15 October 2003 and in each \nsubsequent year, MOH will submit for review and comments to ADB, DFID, and IDA the \nfinal version of the annual operational plan approved by MEF. \n\nThe Government and MOH will ensure that no later than 31 May 2003 and in each year \nthereafter,  they  will  provide  to  ADB,  DFID,  and  IDA  an  annual  operational  plan  for  the \nhealth sector for the upcoming year. No later than 31 July of each year, the Government \nand  MOH  will  finalize  and  approve  the  3-year  rolling  plan,  including  the  annual \noperational plan, incorporating the suggestions of ADB, DFID, and IDA. \n\n(iii)  MOH  will  submit  by  30  April  2004  for  review  and  concurrence  of  ADB,  DFID,  and  IDA \nduring  the  2004  annual  review,  a  plan  to  strengthen  the  administration  of  health \nservices. The MOH health sector institutional capacity-building plan will include a review \nof  current  and  future  responsibilities,  revised  organizational  charts,  proposed  numbers \nand profiles of key staff, and a training plan to develop capabilities. The Government will \nensure that the plan will be implemented in 2004-2007.  \n\n(iv)  MOH  will  submit  by  30  April  2004  for  review  and  concurrence  of  ADB,  DFID,  and  IDA \nduring  the  2004  annual  review,  a  health  infrastructure  development  plan  and  a \nmaintenance  plan.  The  health  infrastructure  development  plan  will  indicate  the  type  of \nhealth facilities proposed to be developed, their locations, the nature of civil works to be \ncarried out, and implications for staffing of the proposed facilities. The maintenance plan \nwill  cover  buildings,  equipment,  and  vehicles.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  these \nplans are implemented in 2004-2007.  \n\n\f \n\n 19\n\n \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n(xii) \n\nMOH  will  submit  by  30  April  2004  for  review  and  concurrence  of  ADB,  DFID,  and  IDA \nduring  the  2004  annual  review,  (a)  a  review  of  the  HWDP  (1996-2005)  and  (b)  the \nproposed HWDP for 2005-2013.  HWDP 2005-2013 should take into account the MPA \nand  CPA  guidelines  and  the  infrastructure  development  plan.  It  will  propose  specific \nmeasures to deploy, manage, and train health providers. It will also identify measures to \nestablish a sector-wide solution for the problem of low salaries for health providers.  \n\nThe Government will ensure that (a) its allocation for recurrent expenditures in the health \nsector will be maintained at least at the current rate of 10% of the total recurrent budget, \nand  (b)  actual  salary  and  nonsalary  expenditures  will  increase  to  at  least  90%  of \nallocated funds in FY2003 and FY2004, and to 95% in FY2005 and FY2006.  \n\n(vii) \n\nThe Government will ensure that at least 50% of allocated funds from its budget for the \nhealth sector will have been disbursed by 30 September of each year from FY2003.  \n\n(viii)  The Government and MOH will ensure (a) starting in 2003, allocation of at least 60% of \nthe  new  recurrent  spending  above  the  previous  fiscal  year  for  provincial  and  district \nhospitals and commune health centers, and for programs that directly target the poor; (b) \nby 30 April 2004, review of exemptions made in various cost-recovery arrangements in \nthe sector, and propose mechanisms to benefit the poor during the 2004 annual review; \n(c)  by  September  2006,  evaluation  of  various  initiatives  to  help  the  poor  afford  health \ncare, including a social protection fund pilot and, if effective and feasible, mainstreaming \nof  such  schemes  in  the  Government  strategy;  and  (d)  allocation  of  the  health  sector \nbudget to provinces and districts, and development and subsequent implementation of a \nformula that incorporates, among other things, poverty criteria and disease burden.  \n\nThe  Government  and  MOH  will  ensure  that  for  each  fiscal  year  from  2004  to  2007, \nbudgetary allocation to health education and consumer behavior programs increases by \nat least 10%.  \n\nThe  Government  and  MOH  will  ensure  that  (a)  contracted  districts  receive  an  MOH \noperating  budget  at  levels  comparable  to  those  of  noncontracted  districts.  Operating \nbudget  to  the  contracted  districts  will  be  disbursed  in  lumpsum  by  MOH  DBF  to  the \ncontractors  quarterly;  and  (b)  civil  service  salaries,  drugs,  equipment,  and  consumable \nsupplies to the contracted districts through normal MOH channels are continued. \n\nThe  Government  and  MOH  will  ensure  the  implementation  of  EMDP,  prepared  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines,  to  increase  the  quality  of  and  access  to  health \nservices  received  by  ethnic  minorities.  The  Government  and  MOH  will  further  ensure \nthat the ethnic minorities have equal opportunities to participate in training, recruitment, \nand promotion of health workers.   \n\nThe  Government  and  MOH  will  ensure  the  implementation  of  the  gender  strategy \nprepared during the appraisal. They will further ensure that in selecting the participants \nfor all training activities, priority will be given to achieving at least the same proportion of \nwomen  trainees  as  in  the  overall  pool  of  the  targeted  staff,  with  the  ultimate  goal  of \nreaching gender equality in the training, recruitment, and promotion of health workers. \n\n(xiii)  Although  no  significant  environmental  impacts  were  identified,  the  siting,  design, \nconstruction, rehabilitation, and operation of the health centers and referral hospitals will \nbe  implemented  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  guidelines.  Handling  and  disposal \nmeasures for hazardous medical waste will be carried out strictly in accordance with the \nprescribed design and operation of the health centers. \n\n\f 20 \n\n \nB. \n \n(i) \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n(xiv)  Although  no  involuntary  resettlement  is  envisaged,  the  Government  and  MOH  will \nensure  that  before  the  award  of  civil  works  contracts,  the  proposed  works  will  be \nscreened  for  involuntary  resettlement  effects  to  ensure  that  no  losses  of  land,  income, \nhousing,  community  facilities,  and  resources  occur  that  would  require  compensation  to \nbe paid in accordance with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement. \n\n(xv)  No later than 30 September 2003, the Government and MOH will propose mechanisms \nto ensure transparent budget management at the central level and at PHDs, operational \ndistricts, and health centers for discussion during the 2004 annual review. \n\nCondition for Loan Effectiveness \n\nThe  effectiveness  of  the  Loan  Agreement  will  be  subject  to  the  Government  and  ADB \nobtaining from DFID a confirmation that the DFID grant has been approved. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n\n80. \nADB and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 15,154,000 to \nthe  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  Health  Sector  Support  Project  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1%  per  annum \nduring  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  a  term  of  32  years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement \npresented to the Board; and \n\nADB administering grant in the amount of $10,360,000 equivalent to be provided \nby the Government of the United Kingdom to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the \nHealth Sector Support Project.  \n\n                                                                                                              Tadao Chino \n                                                                                                              President \n\n28 October 2002 \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n21\n\nDesign summary \n\nPerformance targets \n\nAssumptions and risks \n\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \n\nMonitoring mechanisms\n  \n \n\u2022 Demographic and \nhealth surveys  \n\n\u2022 National Health Survey \n\n  \n\n2002 (baseline)  \n\nGOAL \nImproved health status, \nespecially women, \nchildren and the poor, in \ntargeted regions \n\n  \nBy 2007: \n\nPURPOSE \n1.

The Strategic Plan was launched by the Prime Minister on 22 August 2002. MOH\u2019s \n5-year strategic goal is to \u201cenhance health sector development in order to improve the health of \nthe  people  of  Cambodia,  especially  mothers  and  children,  thereby  contributing  to  poverty \nalleviation and socioeconomic development.\u201d Goals include reductions in the high infant, child, \nand maternal mortality rates. \n \n2. \n \n\nKey Constraints. The plan identifies and seeks to address the following: \n\nlow salaries of health staff in the public sector and lack of incentives to work in \nremote areas. While broader public administrative reforms are underway, interim \nstrategies  are  needed  to  improve  the  income  of  government  health  staff  to \nachieve the plan's objectives; \nirregular and inadequate flow of government funds. Although the national health \nbudget  has  increased,  access  to  funds,  and,  therefore,  expenditures,  remains \nlow; \nhigh  prices,  which  limit  access  to  services,  particularly  hospital  services,  by  the \npoor; \npoor quality of care in public and private sectors; \npoor  attitudes  and  practices  among  service  providers  in  communicating  with \nconsumers; \n\n(vi)  maldistribution of health service providers, especially trained midwives; \n(vii) \n\nfor  monitoring,  evaluation,  supervision, \n\ninadequate  managerial  capacities \ndelegation, and evidence-based decision making; and \nlimited coordination of external financing in the sector. \n\n(viii) \n\nPriority Interventions. The Strategic Plan identifies the following priority interventions: \n\n \n3. \n \n\nhealth service delivery: improving coverage and utilization through improvements \nin the public health system and collaboration with the private sector;  \nimprovement  of  the  weak  interpersonal  skills  of  health  care  providers  and  their \nresponsiveness to consumer needs, especially of the poor; \nimprovement of the quality of public and private sector services;  \nhuman  resource  development  in  terms  of  skills  and  effective  deployment  of \npersonnel; \nimproved  health  financing  in  the  context  of  a  sector  that  is  underfunded  and \nsuffers from poor access to agreed allocations; and \ninstitutional  development  to  enable  MOH  to  implement  these  interventions  and \nassociated strategies. \n\n \n4. \nThe highest priority intervention is improved health service delivery and coverage, since \nthey  will  directly  reduce  morbidity  and  mortality.  The  five  other  priorities  are  necessary  to \nachieve  the  first,  since  without  changes  in  the  health  sector  as  a  whole  and  MOH  as  an \ninstitution, the chances of achieving the intended outcomes are limited. \n \n5. \n\nKey strategies to be employed in these intervention areas include \n(i) \n\nimproving  coverage  and  access  to  health  services,  especially  for  the  poor, \nthrough appropriate location of health facilities; \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n(viii) \n(ix) \n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n(xii) \n\n(xiii) \n\n(xiv) \n(xv) \n\nstrengthening health center delivery of the Minimum Package of Activities;  \nstrengthening  referral  hospital  delivery  of  the  complementary  package  of \nactivities;  \npromoting  public-private  partnerships  to  improve  accessibility,  quality,  and \naffordability of health services;  \ntraining  health  providers  to  become  more  responsive  to  consumer  needs, \nespecially of the poor, through sensitization and building interpersonal skills;  \nintroducing  and  developing  a  \u201cculture  of  quality\u201d  in  the  public  health  sector \nthrough the use of MOH standards; \ndeveloping private sector legislative and regulatory mechanisms; \nexpanding the number of midwives through basic training;  \nstrengthening the capacity and skills of midwives through continuing education; \nimproving  the  flow  of  funds  to  the  health  sector  through  advocacy  to  increase \nresources; \nstrengthening  financial  management  through  improved  budget  implementation \nprocedures; \nallocating  financial  resources  to  improve  the  accessibility  of  health  services  for \nthe poor through alternative health-financing schemes;  \ndeveloping monitoring and financial auditing systems within MOH to ensure that \nfunds are allocated equitably, and used effectively; \nincreasing effective decentralization and deconcentration of MOH functions; and  \nstrengthening MOH management structures, systems, and procedures (including \nfor procurement) to implement all of the above.  \n\nRelationship between the Project Components and MOH Health Sector Strategy \n \nHSS Intervention Area \n\nRelevant HSS Strategies \n\n \n \n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\n \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\nDrugs, medical supplies \n\nProject Component/Activity \n1.

The  nine  provinces  to  be  covered  by  ADB  are  Kompong  Cham, \nKompong Chhnang, Koh Kong, Mondol Kiri, Prey Veng, Rattanak Kiri, Krong Prean Sihanouk, \nSvay Rieng, and Takeo. The rationale for selecting these provinces is as follows: \n \n\nFive provinces\u2014Kompong Cham, Kompong Chnnang, Prey Veng, Svay Rieng, and \nTakeo\u2014were  covered  under  the  Basic  Health  Services  Project.  Continued  support \nwill enable the consolidation of the achievements in the previous project and provide \nopportunity to fill the remaining gaps. These provinces are some of the poorest and \nmost heavily populated in Cambodia.  \n\nThe  four  additional  provinces  were  selected  on  the  following  bases:  (i)  poor  health \nindicators;  (ii)  remote  and  underserved  in  terms  of  public  health  care  capacity \n(Mondol Kiri, Rattanak Kiri, and Koh Kong); (iii) a high poverty profile (Mondolk Kiri, \nRattanak Kiri, and Koh Kong);  (iv) presence of a large proportion of ethnic minorities \n(Mondol Kiri and Rattanak Kiri); (iv) high incidence, and strong possibility of increase, \nof  HIV  infection  (Krong  Prean  Sihanouk  and  Koh  Kong);  and  (v)  compact  and \ngeographically  contiguous  area \nto  enable  better  monitoring  and  effective \nimplementation. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n3. \n \n\nThe table indicates poverty and health data for the nine provinces targeted by ADB.  \n\nProvince \n\nPoverty and Health Statistics by Province \n \n\nPoor \n(%) \n\nANCa\n(%) \n\nMeasles \nCoverage\n(%) \n\nDeliveries \nin Modern \nFacilities\n(%) \n\nPublic \nHealth \nContacts\n/Capita \n\nTBc \nincidence/ \n100,000 \n\n61.0 \n61.0 \n43.0 \n54.0 \n69.0 \n60.0 \n53.0 \n75.0 \n74.0 \n61.3 \n69.0 \n\n39.0 \n52.0 \n10.0 \n19.0 \n37.0 \n8.0 \n31.0 \n73.0 \n41.0 \n37.8 \n41.0 \n\n39.0 \n43.0 \n56.0 \n68.0 \n32.0 \n54.0 \n15.0 \n33.0 \n30.0 \n36.2 \n36.1 \n\nKompong Cham \nKompong Chhnang \nKoh Kong \nMondol Kiri \nPrey Veng \nRattanak Kiri \nKrong Prean Sihanouk \nSvay Rieng \nTakeo \nProvincial Average  \nNational Average \na  Antenatal care. \nb  Human immunodeficiency virus. \nc  Tuberculosis. \nSource: Ministry of Health.

The \nProject  will  help  organize  these  sector  reviews.  The  annual  health  sector  review  process  will \nbring together stakeholders active in the health sector to review progress on agreed-upon key \nissues, against a core indicator set and agreed-upon annual milestones.  The establishment of \nbaselines  will  be  a  priority  in  2003.  The  project  cofinanciers  and  other  development  partners \nhave  a  broad  consensus  on  a  joint  review  process.  The  review  will  reduce  the  need  for  time-\nconsuming  and  costly  individual  progress  reviews  by  each  development  partner  and  improve \nthe sharing of information between stakeholders. \n \nA. \n \n2. \n  \n\nThe objectives of the joint annual health sector review process are the following:  \n\nObjectives \n\nreview the progress in delivering the Health Sector Strategic Plan; \ndevelop a mechanism for joint review and collaboration under the coordination of \nthe Ministry of Health (MOH); \nprovide  an  opportunity  for  policy  dialogue  and  joint  consideration  of  key  issues \nand constraints, including issues of equity and sustainability; \nidentify  and  agree  on  main  priorities  and  a  limited  number  of  milestones  for \nFY2004 and subsequent years; and \ndiscuss \nthe  proposed \ncontributions of all stakeholders, and adopt the annual plan comprising planned \nactivities and sources of financing for the coming year.  \n\nthe  comprehensive  3-year  rolling  plan \n\nintegrating \n\nOutline of the Process \n\nThe annual review will consist of the following activities:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nan  annual  technical  review  that  will  assess  progress  and  key  issues  relating  to \nthe  seven  priority  strategic  areas  as  outlined  in  Strategic  Plan,  and  led  by  the \nGovernment, with appropriate technical assistance (TA); and \npolicy and planning review meetings, twice a year.  \n\n \n4. \nThe annual review will provide information to the annual budget and planning cycle. The \ntiming  of  the  technical  review  and  the  policy  and  planning  review  meetings  will  need  to  be \ncarefully  considered  to  fit  in  with  the  Government  budgetary  and  planning  cycle  to  ensure  full \nvalue is made of the findings and recommendations.  The report of the findings of the technical \nreview will be made available in advance of the first policy and planning review.  The technical \nreview will be conducted around March every year to allow annual reporting of progress for the \nprevious financial year and policy and planning reviews around June and November, in line with \nthe budget and planning timetable.  An initial consultative exercise could be undertaken to set \nthe first milestones based on a review of baseline data and work plans.  \n \nC. \n \n5. \nTo  allow  an  informed  judgment  on  progress  in  the  sector  and  project,  a  number  of \nrequirements  for  the  annual  health  sector  review  linked  to  planning,  management,  and \nimplementation need to be agreed upon.  These should be in the form of a set of milestones to \nbe achieved by specified times.  \n\nAnnual Technical Review  \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n33 \n\n \n\n \n6. \nfollowing:  \n \n\nExamples  of  annual  milestones  (to  be  achieved  before  the  technical  review)  are  the \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\npublic expenditure review for the health sector; \nannual  health  sector  profile  (report  based  on  the  core  indicator  set  that \ndemonstrates overall progress in the sector against established baselines); \nannual independent review of procurement;  \nannual workforce plan and annual report (including salary review); and \nannual financial audit report. \n\n \n7. \nMany  stakeholders  are  involved  in  the  Health  Sector  Support  Plan  2003\u20132007. \nResponsibility  for  coordination  of  the  various  inputs  lies  with  MOH,  and  the  Health  Sector \nSteering Committee, chaired by the secretary of state, is proposed to oversee implementation. \nThe  wide  variety  of  stakeholders  poses  a  challenge  to  the  establishment  of  coherent  program \nimplementation  that  makes  best  use  of  available  resources.    While  the  existing  informal \nthe \nmechanisms  will  be  strengthened,  more \ndevelopment of joint planning and monitoring processes will be developed. \n \nD. \n \n8. \nThe annual health sector review will bring MOH and its partners together and help link \nhealth  work  with  other  government  processes.  Specifically,  the  annual  review  will  aim  for  the \nfollowing:   \n\nLinks with Wider Government Processes \n\nformal  working  arrangements, \n\nincluding \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\navoid unnecessary duplication due to different reporting requirements of Ministry \nof Economy and Finance and funding agencies; \nlink  up  with  the  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper  (PRSP)  by  ensuring  that \nhealth, nutrition, and HIV/AIDS objectives, targets, and indicators are consistent \nwith  any  future  poverty-monitoring  framework  and  that  the  annual  review \nfindings, recommendations, and commitments feed into the PRSP annual review; \nlink up with the Medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) and coordinate with \nthe  Government\u2019s  planning  and  budgeting  cycle.  In  particular,  the  review  will \ninclude substantive discussion around the MTEF; and \nlink  up  with  other  crosscutting  reforms  underway  by  ensuring  that  findings  and \nrecommendations are fed into the respective ministries, specifically the work on \nsalary reforms and sectoral reforms such as those underway in education. \n\n \n9. \nThe joint review will require effective coordination and good organization. A coordination \nteam  will  thus  guide  and  support  the  process  and  ensure  that  key  documents  and  summary \nreports are produced on time for the main review meeting.  \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nCONTRACTING NONGOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS FOR PROVIDING HEALTH \nSERVICES: RESULTS OF THE PILOT STUDY \n\nIntroduction \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nUnder  the  Basic  Health  Services  Project,  the  Ministry  of  Health  undertook  operations \nresearch  on  the  feasibility,  impact,  and  cost-effectiveness  of  contracting  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) to provide health service delivery as an alternative to conventional direct \ngovernment  provision  of  services.  The  following  two  models  of  contracting  for  health  services \nwere  tested,  and  the  experience  of  these  two  models  was  compared  to  a  number  of \nnonintervention areas as controls: \n \n\n(i) \n\nContracting out (CO). Contractors had full responsibility for delivery of specified \nservices  in  an  operational  district,  directly  employed  staff,  and  had  full \nmanagement  authority,  and  accountability  for  achievement  of  specific  health \ncoverage  targets.  The  contractor  had  full  management  control  over  resource \nallocation and disbursement. \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\nContracting  in  (CI).  Contractors  provided  only  management  support  to  civil \nservice  health  staff,  with  recurrent  operating  costs  provided  by  the  Government \nthrough normal channels. A budget supplement of $0.25 per capita was provided \nout  of  loan  funds.  Contractors  had  full  management  control  over  allocation  and \ndisbursement  of  the  budget  supplement,  but  were  obliged  to  follow  government \nrules  and  regulations  with  respect  to  the  government-provided  resources. \nContractors  had  management  authority  over  staff  but  did  not  directly  employ \nthem. \n\n \n2. \nA  comparable  operating  budget  supplement  was  made  available  to  the  control  areas. \nIntervention and control areas consisted of an entire district, each with a population of 100,000\u2013\n200,000. There were 4 control, 3 CI, and 2 CO districts. \n  \n3. \nEvaluation  indicators  were  established  and  baseline  household  and  health  facility \nsurveys  conducted  before  the  intervention.  An  independent  evaluation,  including  repeat \nhousehold  and  health  facility  surveys,  was  conducted  in  mid-2001,  2.5  years  after  contractors \ncommenced  work.  All  districts  at  baseline  had  less  than  20%  of  planned  health  facilities \nfunctional  and  extremely  poor  health  service  coverage.  The  CI,  CO,  and  control  groups  had \nsimilar socioeconomic status and baseline health service coverage. \n \nB. \n\nResults \n\n1. \n\nWas Contracting Effective? \n\n4. \nResults  of  the  final  survey  show  that  contracted  districts  consistently  outperformed \ncontrol  districts  with  respect  to  the  predefined  coverage  indicators.  The  CO  model  was  more \nhighly performing than the CI model. Table A6.1 summarizes the changes in 11 health service \ncoverage indicators over 2.5 years. \n \n5. \nStarting  with  comparable  levels,  CO  districts  increased  health  service  utilization  to  1.7 \nper  contact  per  capita  per  annum,  and  CI  districts  to  1.2.  Control  districts  had  an  annual  per \ncapita  contact  rate  of  only  0.8.  CO  districts  witnessed  an  impressive  increase  in  use  of \nreproductive health services. For example, coverage of antenatal care increased by more than \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n35 \n\n400%, but only by 233% in CI districts and 160% in control districts. Success in the coverage of \nchild  health  services  also  followed  a  similar  pattern.  Immunization  rates  increased  in  CO \ndistricts by 158%, in CI districts by 82%, and in control districts by 56%. \n \n\n2. \n\nWas Contracting Efficient?  \n\n6. \nThe  final  survey  measured  the  productive  time  lost  due  to  illness  by  patients  and  their \ncaretakers. The results showed that on an average, people in CO districts lost about 15% less \ntime on illness and seeking health care compared to control districts. People in CI districts lost \nabout  5%  less  time  due  to  illness  compared  to  control  districts.  Comparable  data  were  not \navailable  in  the  baseline  survey  to  assess  changes  in  lost  time  over  the  contract  period. \nHowever, contracted districts had higher utilization of services and still had lower time lost due \nto  sickness  and  health  care.  This  implies  that  in  contracted  districts  primary  health  care  was \nmore accessible, obviating the need to travel long distances to seek care. These districts also \nhad  more  efficient  and  early  diagnosis  and  more  rational  treatment,  which  may  have  reduced \nthe need for hospitalization and shortened the illnesses. \n \n7. \nThe  pilot  measured  cost-effectiveness  of  contracting  with  respect  to  the  delivery  of \npredefined  health  services.  While  service  was  more  expensive  in  the  contracting  than  in  the \ncontrol  districts,  it  turned  out  to  be  more  cost-effective  when  health  service  outcomes  were \nfactored in the evaluation (Table A6.2). A dollar invested through CO yielded about 50% better \noutcomes  than  in  the  control  districts.  Contracting  of  services  appears  to  be  more  sustainable \nas well since it had lower recurrent cost, taking into account private expenditures (Table A6.3). \n \n\n3. \n\nWas Contracting Equitable? \n\n8. \nThe  evaluation  shows  that  contracted  districts  not  only  achieved  better  health  care \nutilization and significant efficiencies, but also provided more than proportionate benefits to the \npoor. Much of the increase in health care utilization in contracted districts was attributable to the \nincreased  use  of  services  by  households  of  low  socioeconomic  status.  For  example,  use  of \ncurative health services at district hospitals by the bottom-half socioeconomic group increased \nby 1,096% in CO districts and by 491% in CI districts in 2.5 years. The corresponding increase \nin the control districts was considerably lower at 82%. \n \n9. \nWhile  the  use  of  services  by  the  households  of  low  socioeconomic  status  increased  in \ncontracted  districts,  their  actual  out-of-pocket-payment  for  health  care  utilization,  even  when \nuser  fees  were  charged  by  contractors,  substantially  decreased.  Private  out-of-pocket  health \ncare  expenditures  by  the  bottom-half  socioeconomic  group  reduced  by  up  to  70%  during  the \ncontract period. The reduction in out-of-pocket costs was greater among this population than the \noverall  population,  indicating  successful  targeting  of  the  desired  beneficiaries  and  efficient \ntransfer  of  subsidies.  The  out-of-pocket  expenditure  for  the  bottom-half  socioeconomic  group \nwas reduced by $35 per capita, which compares extremely favorably to about $4 per capita per \nyear  invested  through  contracting  of  services.  Clearly,  this  was  achieved  through  reduction  in \nuse  of  inefficient  services  and  reduction  in  travel  expenditure  by  providing  services  closer  to \nhome. Control districts showed an increase in private expenditures  (Table A6.4). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n \n\n \n \n\n1\n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n1\n \n \n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n \n \n1\n

The  Project  will  support  the  implementation  of  the  Minimum \nPackage  of  Activities  (MPA)  and  the  Complementary  Package  of  Activities  (CPA),  which  are \ndesigned to ensure that the population, particularly the poor, has access to basic, cost-efficient \nhealth  services.  Included  in  the  MPA  are  basic  interventions  such  as  immunization,  antenatal \ncare,  birth-spacing  services,  basic  nutrition  interventions,  and  prevention  and  treatment  of \ncommon  diseases  such  as  tuberculosis  and  malaria.  These  interventions  generate  large \nexternalities and can be provided at low cost.  \n\n3. \nHealth  care  is  characterized  by  asymmetrical  information  on  medical  interventions;  the \nhealth  care  provider  typically  knows  more  about  the  need  and  efficacy  of  treatment  than  the \nreceiver,  especially  in  Cambodia,  where  the  education  level  of  patients  is  low  and  consumers \nare often ignorant about even basic health practices. Publicly provided health services can help \nbridge  the  gap  and  provide  information  about  good  health  practices  and  alternatives  in  health \ncare.  Credit  markets  are  weak  in  Cambodia  and  health  insurance  is  nonexistent.  Proper \nadherence  to  a  formal  fee  system  for  health  care  will  reduce  uncertainty  about  health  care \nexpenditures. Schemes should be established to protect the poor from the burden of health care \ncost.  \n\n4. \nThe  Project  will  also  support  training  of  health  workers,  particularly  health  workers  in \nremote areas. While training does provide private benefits, in Cambodia these are likely to be \nsmall compared to the public benefits of having better-trained health workers in a remote area. \nSince  the  public  sector  health  care  providers  work  in  the  public  and  private  sectors  and \nconstitute most human resources in health, improved skills of health care providers will benefit \nthe entire health sector. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic Benefits of the Project \n\n1.  \n\nUnderlying Assumptions  \n\n5. \nThe  assumptions  used  for  the  economic  analysis  of  benefits  are  in  Table  A13.1.  The \nevaluation  of  the  five  contracting  districts  provides  an  important  source  of  information  on  the \npotential impact of the Project on the health and well-being of the population.a The base case \nmakes  conservative  assumptions  about  the  coverage  and  effect  of  the  Project.  To  ensure  the \neconomic  viability  of  the  Project,  a  sensitivity  analysis  will  show  the  effect  of  tightening  the \nassumptions on the overall rate of return.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \na  Keller,  S.  and  Schwartz,  Brad  J.  2001.

These can be broadly divided into resource cost savings \nand productivity gains due to the Project. \n \n7. \nResource cost savings represent a reduction in out-of-pocket expenses for health care \nas a result of (i) increased access to health services to reduce transport cost; (ii) more efficient \nand  rational  diagnosis  and  treatment  to  reduce  cost  of  treatment;  and  (iii)  reforms  in  health \nfinancing  to  reduce  cost  of  seeking  services,  especially  by  the  poor.  The  evidence  from  the \nongoing  Basic  Health  Services  Project  (BHSP)  shows  that  carefully  designed  public  health \nprojects  can  significantly  decrease  out-of-pocket  expenditures  for  health  services  along  with \nimprovements  in  health  status.  The  base  case  under  this  analysis  assumes  that  out-of-pocket \nspending  on  health  care  will  be  reduced  from  $22  to  $16  per  year  in  contracting  districts \n(savings of $6 per person per year) and to $18 per year in noncontracting districts (savings of \n$4  per  person  per  year).  This  is  a  conservative  assumption  since  the  expected  savings  are \nmuch larger.   \n \n8. \nThe  productivity  gains  are  the  result  of  less  time  lost  to  illness  and  increase  in \nproductivity for adults and better learning outcomes for children. Improving the health status of \nthe population will lead to fewer days lost due to illness and fewer days needed to take care of ill \nrelatives  than  without  the  health  interventions  introduced  by  the  Project.  The  base  case \nassumes  that  in  contracting  districts,  an  average  of  2.3  days  will  be  gained  per  capita  due  to \nmore efficient treatment and better availability of services. In other districts, the gain is assumed \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n51 \n\nto be 0.8 days per person. Again, these base-case assumptions are conservative and below the \namounts observed in BHSP. Time is valued at $0.75 per day for the entire population, based on \nprevailing  wages.  This  value  of  time  is  assumed  constant  for  the  entire  population,  whether \npeople  work  outside  the  home,  study,  or  work  at  home,  reflecting  the  contribution  that  the \n\"nonworking\" population makes to household welfare.   \n \n9. \nInitially,  as  the  project  commences,  beneficiaries  will  be  few.  However,  with  time,  their \nnumber  will  increase.  The  base  case  assumes  that  the  first  2  years  of  the  project  will  see  no \nnew  beneficiaries.  In  the  third  year,  20%  of  the  target  population  will  benefit  from  the  project, \nincreasing  to  40%  in  the  fourth  year,  60%  in  the  fifth,  and  80%  in  all  subsequent  years. \nEvidence  from  the  contracting  evaluation  suggests  that  contracting  starts  to  have  a  positive \neffect on the health system within 6 months, so these assumptions are also conservative.  \n \n10. \nNumerous studies have shown that improvements in health have a significant effect on \nthe  population\u2019s  productivity.  This  is  true  for  people  working  (in  a  job,  on  their  own  farm,  and \ndoing housework) and studying. Few studies have been done in Cambodia on the relationship \nbetween  health  status  and  productivity.  This  analysis,  therefore,  does  not  attempt  to  quantify \nthese  gains  and  only  provides  conservative  estimates  based  on  benefit  streams  that  can  be \nquantified in Cambodia.  \n \nImplementing  the  Project  will  require  additional  resources,  particularly  from  the \n11. \nGovernment  but  also  from  partners  in  the  form  of  concessionary  lending  and  grants.  The \nanalysis assumes that for each dollar spent on investment, $0.15 per year has to be spent as \nrecurrent cost. Training is assumed to lead to an increase of 15% in salaries, which will increase \nrecurrent costs. Contracting is essentially a recurrent cost and the assumption here is that the \ncost will remain constant in real terms. An additional amount is included to cover the cost of the \nadministration  of  the  Project.  Finally,  the  analysis  assumes  an  additional  increase  in  recurrent \ncosts for the purchase of new drugs and supplies. \n\n \n\n2.  \n\nCost, Benefits, and Economic Returns of the Project  \n\n12. \nTable  A13.2  summarizes  the  results  for  the  base  case  and  the  alternative  scenarios. \nEven  with  these  relatively  conservative  assumptions,  the  Project  yields  a  return  of  27%.  The \nreal rate of return is likely to be higher as healthier workers are able to work more productively \nand earn higher wages.  \n \nThe  low-coverage  scenario  assumes  that  the  implementation  of  the  project  is  slower \n13. \nthan expected. The fewer-sick-days-saved scenario assumes that the Project does not reduce \nas many days lost due to sickness. The less-cost-savings scenario assumes that the Project is \nnot as successful in reducing out-of-pocket expenses.   \n\n \nTable A13.2:  Rates of Return under Different Scenarios \n\n \n\nScenario \n\n \nBase Case \n \nLow Coverage in the Project \n \nFewer Sick Days Saved \nLess Cost savings  \n \nNote: Calculations in millions of constant US dollars, at 12% discount rate  \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of \nReturn \n27% \n17% \n24% \n17% \n\nNet Present Value \n\n$57.7 million \n$31.4 million \n$49.5 million \n$33.8 million \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n14. \nEven  under  the  most  pessimistic  project  outcome  scenario,  the  Project  has  a  positive \nreturn of 17%. Reducing the number of sick days saved has little effect on the overall returns, \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nreflecting the low value of time. Of course, as health conditions improve, the value of time will \ntend  to  increase.  More  important  to  the  overall  economic  viability  of  the  Project  are  the  cost \nsavings  associated  with  reforming  health  finance  in  Cambodia  and  improving  efficiency  in  the \nhealth  sector,  underlining  the  Project's  commitment  to  health  sector  reform  and  improving \ndelivery to complement the traditional project focus of providing supply and infrastructure.  \n \n15. \nThe Project is part of the larger health sector reform process, led by the Strategic Plan \n2002-2007. At this stage, it is not possible to perform an economic assessment of the Strategic \nPlan  due  to  the  large  number  of  components  that  have  not  been  identified  and  a  number  of \nactivities  that  have  impacts  that  are  difficult  to  measure  (for  example,  sector-wide  monitoring \nand  evaluation).  International  Development  Association  (IDA)  has  undertaken  an  economic \nanalysis of its components and noted an overall economic internal rate of return of 29%.   \n\nC.  \n\nFinancial Sustainability of the Health Sector \n\n \n\n \n\n16. \nThe  sustainability  of  the  health  care  system  is  of  serious  concern  to  the  Government. \nCambodia is still reconstructing its economy and health care system and, as a result, resources \navailable for all sectors (including health) are limited. Although the health needs of the country \nare great, any investment in the health system must be sustainable with domestic resources. \n \nCambodia is unusual among Asian countries, with its large share of health spending\u2014an \n17. \nestimated 12% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Of this, the largest percentage comes from \nhousehold  expenditures,  at  83%.  The  Government\u2019s  contribution  to  total  health  care  is \nestimated to be 5%, and that of development partners, the remaining 12%. The Government\u2019s \neffort is severely limited by its narrow revenue base, accounting for around 12% of GDP.   \n \n18.  While the private sector can be an important source of quality in the health sector, most \nstudies in Cambodia suggest that the country\u2019s over-reliance on the private sector has serious \nconsequences  on  efficiency  due  to  the  lack  of  supervision  and  regulation.  The  private  sector \nproviders rely heavily on the prescription of inappropriate and poor-quality drugs. Serious equity \nissues also exist, associated with high private costs and a weak social safety net. Health has a \nstrong public-good component that requires government support. \n \n19. \nThe  health  sector  is  largely  dependent  on  international  support  and  consumers  for \nfinancing.  Consumers  often  have  limited  information  about  their  health  care  options.  A  good \ndeal  of  international  resources  go  to  capacity  building  and  capital  expenditures,  which  do  not \ndirectly contribute to basic health care. Estimates are that a basic package of publicly provided \nservices should cost $12\u201324 per capita per year.  \n \n20. \nThe  Government  does  not  have  the  resources  to  sustain  the  health  sector  on  its  own. \nWith a budget of $2\u20133 per capita, Government spending is well below the recommended targets \nfor  health  spending.  Given  Cambodia\u2019s  low  income  and  small  revenue  base,  the  country  will \nhave to depend on international assistance for a few more years. Cambodia needs to develop a \nstrategy  to  ensure  that  the  health  sector  can  continue  to  function  with  reduced  international \nsupport,  and  a  strategy  to  better  target  private  health  care  spending  to  improve  the  sector\u2019s \nefficiency.  \n \n21. \nFiscal sustainability analysis assumes the following:  \n \n\nPrimary  health  care  is  funded  by  the  Government,  user  fees,  and  funding  agencies. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n53 \n\n(i)  \n\n(ii)  \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe  economy  will  grow  at  a  moderate  rate  of  5.5%  with  current  trends  in \npopulation growth. This is below the current growth rate and well within the long-\nterm growth rate of Cambodia.  \nThe  Government\u2019s  share  in  the  economy  will  grow  moderately  following  targets \nand  reaching  about  18.7%  of  GDP  in  2015.  The  health  sector  will  account  for \nabout 10% of total government spending. Some of this government spending will \nbe for administrative costs and higher-level services.  \nExternal  financing  will  drop  sharply  from  2001  to  2015.  Given  that  donors  also \nfinance  capital  spending  and  capacity  building,  only  part  of  donor  financing \nactually supports basic primary health care.  \n A  small  portion  of  significant  household  spending  on  health  care  is  on  basic \nprimary health. With time, households will better allocate their resources for basic \nprimary health care.  \n\n \n22.  With  these  assumptions,  Cambodia  will  be  able  to  meet  the  basic  primary  health  care \ntarget of $12 per capita in the year 2010, relying almost entirely on domestic resources. These \nassumptions  are  quite  conservative  and  Cambodia  may  be  able  to  reach  this  target  earlier. \nCambodia  already  spends  substantially  more  than  $12  per  capita  on  health  care,  largely \nthrough household financing of low-quality private services. Were this spending better utilized, \nCambodia would already be well above the recommended level. With the long-term increase in \neducation  and  with  improvements  in  the  health  care  system,  household  spending  will  have  a \nmore positive impact on health.  \n \nD. \n\nFinancial Sustainability of the Project \n \n\n23. \nAs discussed in the section on economic costs and benefits, the Project will impact on \nthe  Government\u2019s  health  spending  in  several  different  areas.  Contracting  of  health  services \nrequires that the Government take over the cost of the contract in the long run. The construction \nof  new  civil  works  and  the  provision  of  equipment  will  require  additional  spending  on \nmaintenance. While these costs are modest, they will require real commitment on the part of the \nGovernment to ensure that the benefits of the investment are not lost.  \n \nThe Project is part of a larger health sector reform program, with additional funding from \n24. \nDepartment  for  International  Development  (DFID)  and  IDA.  It  is  estimated  that  the  ADB  and \nDFID  component  of  the  Project  will  introduce  about  $4.2  million  per  year  in  recurrent  costs. \nAssuming that this is one third of the total incremental recurrent costs, about $12.6 million more \nper  year  will  be  needed  for  recurrent  costs  in  2008.  The  estimates  used  in  the  health  sector \nsustainability  analysis  (section  C)  show  that  the  Government  should  see  an  increase  of  its \nbudget from $43 million in 2003 to $68 million in 2008. This increase is more than sufficient to \ncover  the  additional  costs  introduced  by  the  Project.  Although  future  ADB  assistance  is  likely \nnecessary  for  the  health  sector,  following  current  trends,  Cambodia  is  in  a  good  position  to \nsustain the proposed investment. \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS \n \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nA. \nSector identified as a national priority in country \npoverty analysis? \n \nYes \n\nSector identified as a national priority in country poverty \npartnership agreement?  \n \nThe partnership agreement and the National Poverty \nReduction Strategy identify the health sector as a national \npriority. \n\nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Cambodia: \n \nA recent participatory poverty assessment shows that poor health is one of the leading causes of poverty. Health \nshocks are one of the key dimensions of vulnerability. One episode of poor health that requires hospitalization is \nsufficient to drive most rural households into poverty. The poor in Cambodia pay a significant share of their income \n(more than 10%) for health services that are generally of low quality. The health status of the poor is also \nsubstantially lower than the national average and their access to health services are less. \n \nThe Project will address all of these concerns by strengthening the public health system in rural and poor areas and \nby financing nongovernment organization (NGO)-provided health services to poor areas with little access to health.  \n \n \nB. \nThe Project is national in scope, but will focus its investment in rural areas, particularly in rural areas that have little or \nno access to health care. The project will focus on primary health care, which mainly benefits the poor and the \npopulation with no access to health services. At least 47% of the benefits will accrue to the population living below the \npoverty line. Additionally, an estimated 200,000 of the near poor (those living just above the poverty line) will not fall \nin poverty due to the Project. The contracting of NGOs will be focused in particularly poor areas (including many that \nhave been recently been devastated by floods) and will bring health care to areas that were previously not served or \nwere significantly underserved.  \n \nEthnic minorities, who are a particularly poor and vulnerable group in Cambodia, will benefit from the Project's focus \nin the northeast and from its commitment to train local health workers.  \n \n\nProposed Classification: Poverty  \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\nBenefits to the Poor \n\nGender Benefits \n\nBenefits to Ethnic Minorities \n\nComponent 1: Improved Delivery of Health Services, especially for the Poor and Women \n1.1: Buildings and civil works \nImprove quality and access to \nhealth services for 2.0 million poor \nand 2.0 million near poor.  \n\n2.6 million women will benefit \nfrom increased access to health \ncare. \n\nAt least 160,000 people from ethnic \nminorities will benefit from the \nstrengthening of health services in \nremote areas.  \n\n1.2: Medical and auxiliary equipment \nFacilitates the introduction of the \nMPA, covering basic health \nservices that the poor lack.  \n\nMinimum Package of Activity \n(MPA) introduces reproductive \nhealth as a central component of \nbasic health care for 1.2 million \nwomen.  \n\n1.3: Training of health workers in health centers and hospitals  \nWomen health workers will be \nApproximately 13,000 health \ntrained at least in proportion to \nworkers will be trained in MPA \ntheir number in their system, with \nand complementary package of  \na goal of at least 40% of trained \nactivity.

Consistent  with  these  guidelines,  the  Project  will  work  to  ensure  that  (i) \nethnic minorities are not made more vulnerable as a result of the project\u2019s interventions and (ii) \nethnic minorities positively benefit from the project. EMDP is based on ADB\u2019s previous studies \nin  Cambodia,  including  TA  5794-REG:  Addressing  the  Health  and  Education  Needs  of  Ethnic \nMinorities  in  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion,  and  TA  5953-REG:  Capacity  Building  for  Ethnic \nMinorities.  EMDP  also  draws  on  the  joint  social  assessment  supported  by  the  Department  for \nInternational Development (DFID) for the partners in the health sector project.b  \n \n3. \nPotential  Negative  Impact  on  Ethnic  Minorities.  No  negative  impacts  on  ethnic \nminorities  are  expected.  In  Mondol  Kiri  and  Rattanak  Kiri,  two  new  health  centers  and  nine \nhealth posts will be constructed. The health posts are designed to serve low-density areas. The \ncivil  works  proposed  to  be  undertaken  under  the  Project  are  small  and  no  resettlement  is \nexpected.  Evidence  shows  that  hill  tribes  are  receptive  to  health  interventions  if  properly \ndesigned and if implemented by health workers with substantial knowledge about local beliefs.  \n \n4. \nThe  Cham  are  native  Khmer  speakers  and  well  integrated  into  mainstream  society. \nWomen  and  men  regularly  interact  with  the  existing  health  system  without  apparent \ndiscrimination  or  unease.  Expanding  and  improving  the  health  system  should  not  have  any \nnegative impact on the Cham.  \n \n5. \nEnsuring Proportional Benefits to Ethnic Minorities from the Project. The  hill  tribes \nin Mondol Kiri and Rattanak Kiri are among the poorest groups in the country. Limited access \nand  low-quality  health  services  are  problems  shared  with  other  marginalized  and  remote \ngroups.  These  limitations  will  be  similarly  addressed  by  the  Project  for  vulnerable  Khmer-\nspeaking  groups.  To  the  extent  possible,  the  Project  will  help  ethnic  minorities  by  expanding \nhealth  services  in  poor  areas  through  a  mainstreaming  strategy.  EMDP  focuses  on  issues \nspecific  to  ethnic  minorities.  The  most  significant  barriers  they  face  are  those  created  by \ndifferences in language and culture, which will be addressed by the ethnic minority strategy.  \n \nLiteracy  rates  in  Mondol  Kiri  and  Rattanak  Kiri  are  less  than  one  third  of  the  national \n6. \naverage. Women are even less likely to be literate and speak Khmer. This creates extra barriers \nfor  women  who  are  often  most  in  need  of  reproductive  health,  birth-spacing,  and  child  health \nservices. Women\u2019s inability to access health services harms the children. \n \n \n\n                                                 \na  Another  common  term  is  Khmer  Loeu  (highland  Khmer).  EMDP  will  use  the  term  hill  tribes  to  describe  the  15 \n\nindigenous groups in the northeast. \n\nb Helen Pickering. The Health Situation of Ethnic Minorities in Cambodia. June 2002. \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n57 \n\n \n\n7. \nthe Project:  \n \n\nThe  mainstreaming  strategy  will  be  implemented  through  the  following  components  of \n\nNew and upgraded health facilities and equipment in poor and remote areas will \nhelp improve the quality of health care that ethnic minorities receive (components \n1.1.1 and 1.2.1).  \nDeveloping  a  maintenance  plan  will  help  ensure  the  sustainability  of  the  health \nsystem,  which  is  a  particular  concern  in  remote  areas  where  few  alternatives \nexist (components 1.1.2 and 1.2.2). \nEqual opportunity will be given to eligible candidates from ethnic minorities in all \ntraining activities (component 1.3 and 3.2.4) \nThe use of contracting in the remote provinces of Mondol Kiri and Rattanak Kiri \nwill lead to significant improvements in access to health in areas with little or no \nformal health care (component 1.4.2).  \nIncreased  community  participation  in  the  health  system  will  ensure  that  basic \nhealth services are responsive to local needs and are culturally appropriate. The \nproject  will  support  the  establishment  of  health  center  community  committees \n(component 3.1).  \n\nThe  ethnic  minority  strategy  focuses  on  designing  interventions  that  are  culturally \n\n \n8. \nappropriate and will improve the access of ethnic minorities to basic health services:  \n \n\nTraining community-based health workers from Mondol Kiri and Rattanak Kiri will \nensure  that  the  staff  that  serve  the  ethnic  minority  population  speak  the  local \nlanguage  and  are  familiar  with  the  local  culture  The  training  program  will  be \ndesigned to take into account the low initial level of education of ethnic minority \nstudents (component 3.2.5).  \nThe construction of small, village-based health posts will provide basic services \nto  low-density  populations.  The  health  posts  also  permit  the  local  population  to \nstaff  health  services  rather  than  rely  on  outsiders  to  staff  larger  health  centers \n(component 1.1).  \nThe development of guidelines for nongovernment organization (NGO) selection \nfor contracting in Mondol Kiri and Rattanak Kiri will ensure that the NGO will train \nand  employ  local  staff  familiar  with  the  ethnic  minority  languages  and  cultures \n(component 1.4.2). \nThe  introduction  of  a  formal  national  and  provincial  affirmative  action  plan  will \nensure that ethnic minorities help manage the health system (components 3.1.1, \n3.2.1, and 3.2.2).  \nCommunity  participation  in  the  management  of  local  health  services  will  be \nensured. For cultural and linguistic reasons, the participation strategy may need \nto be modified to ensure that ethnic minorities (and particularly hill tribes) have an \nadequate  voice  in  the  health  system.  The  contracted  NGOs  in  Mondol  Kiri  and \nRattanak  Kiri  will  develop  a  culturally  sensitive  participation  strategy  for  their \ncontracted district.  \nAn ethnic minority-disaggregated monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system will be \ninstitutionalized in Ministry of Health (MOH) (component 3.3) \n\nDeveloping  the  capacity  of  the  Government  to  monitor  the  implementation  of  EMDP  is \n\n \n9. \nessential. As part of the EMDP, the following steps will be undertaken:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nA focal point for ethnic minority issues will be designated by the provincial health \nservices in Mondol Kiri, Rattanak Kiri, and, if necessary, in other provinces. The \nfocal point will serve as a liaison among the provincial health service, contracted \nNGOs, MOH, and the local population.  \nAll annual reviews will ensure that the terms of EMDP are met and will discuss \ntheir  progress.  ADB  will  program  a  special  review  mission  to  focus  on  the \nconcerns of ethnic minorities in the third or fourth year of the project.  \nThe  Project  will  request  that  ethnic  minority-specific  questions  be  included  in \nfuture health and living standard surveys to ensure that it is possible to track the \nhealth status of ethnic minorities. ADB will ensure that M&E activities under the \nProject  incorporate  the  concerns  of  ethnic  minorities.  Monitoring  will  be \nqualitative and quantitative.  \n\nGender Strategy \n\n \nB. \n \n10.  Women in Cambodia are disproportionately burdened by health problems. Although the \nStrategic Plan focuses on ensuring that the health system will equally benefit men and women, \nspecific actions and investments are needed to realize this intention. The gender strategy is the \nProject's  contribution  to  the  commitment  of  the  Government  and  ADB  to  improve  the  health \nstatus of women and ensure their full participation in the health system. \n \n11. \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  a  gender  intervention  because  of  the  significant  benefits \nthat  women  will  receive.  The  Project  is  built  around  the  Strategic  Plan,  and  stresses  the \navailability of sufficient resources for Minimum Package of Activity (MPA) and Complementary \nPackage  of  Activity  (CPA),  which  emphasize  women's  health,  particularly  reproductive  health. \nGiven  the  limited  resources  available  for  health  in  Cambodia,  the  Project  recognizes  that \ninvesting in reproductive health will have a positive impact on the welfare of the population. \n \nFollowing the Government and ADB strategy, the Project is committed to mainstreaming \n12. \ngender  concerns.  It  will  support  many  interventions  and  reforms  that  will  benefit  both  women \nand men, including efforts to increase the affordability and access to health services. In addition, \nthe  Project  will  introduce  a  number  of  changes  that  will  target  women  specifically.  The \nimplementation  of  the  MPA  will  significantly  increase  access  to  reproductive  health  for  1.2 \nmillion  women  of  reproductive  age.  At  least  5,200  female  health  workers  will  be  trained  in  the \nMPA  and  CPA  to  ensure  that  more  women  can  be  attended  to.  Many  partners  are  providing \nsignificant support (including through this Project) to the national HIV/AIDS strategy that will also \nbenefit women, who are disproportionately burdened by HIV/AIDS.  \n \n13. \nKey to implementing the gender strategy is ensuring that the health system serves the \nhealth  needs  of  men  and  women.  The  formal  health  system  has  health  center  community \ncommittees  (HCCCs)  to  involve  the  community  in  the  management  of  health  centers.  The \nHCCC  consists  of  one  man  and  one  woman  per  village  covered  by  the  health  center.  Many \nareas,  however,  do  not  have  an  active  HCCC.  The  Project  will  help  communities  establish \nHCCCs where none exist.  \n \n14. \nEnsuring Women Benefit Proportionately from the Project. The underlying principle \nof  the  Project  is  that  women's  health  concerns  should  be  mainstreamed  in  the  health  sector \nthrough a gender mainstreaming strategy. It will attempt to ensure that the health system takes \ninto  account  the  cultural  and  biological  differences  between  men  and  women.  The  Project  will \nalso have a gender targeting strategy to ensure that women receive adequate support from the \nhealth  system.  The  Project  will  monitor  the  implementation  of  the  gender  mainstreaming \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n59 \n\n \n\nstrategy.  \n \n15. \n \n\n(i) \n\nIt will be implemented through the following as part of the Project:  \n\nTo  ensure  that  women  are  adequately  represented  in  the  health  system,  a \nsignificant  number  of  women  health  workers  will  be  trained  under  the  project. \nEqual  opportunity  for  women  to  receive  training  is  essential  and  the  Project  will \nensure that women will receive training at least in proportion to their numbers in \nthe health system, with the ultimate goal of at least 40% of trainees being women \nin 2007 (component 1.3).  \nThe  Project  will  ensure  that  civil  works  provide  adequate  visual  and  auditory \nprivacy for patients, which is particularly important for women (component 1.1).  \nThe  Project  will  help  establish  health  center  feedback  committees  (HCFCs)  in \ncommunes  where  the  committees  are  not  operating.  HCFCs  provide  equal \nrepresentation to men and women and ensure that their voices are heard in the \nmanagement of local health centers (component 3.1).  \nEthnic minority women are often especially disadvantaged due to their low formal \neducation  and  contact  with  the  formal  health  system.  The  Project  will  focus  on \ntraining  ethnic  minority  women  health  workers,  who  have  the  cultural  and \nlinguistic knowledge to treat ethnic minority women effectively. More than 50% of \nthe trainees in remote provinces will be women (components 1.3 and 3.2).  \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe gender targeting strategy will be built into the Project and will serve to improve the \n\n \n16. \nhealth status of women. In particular the Project will work to accomplish the following:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nto \n\nIncorporate  the  MPA  and  CPA  in  the  health  system,  which  will  significantly \nimprove  women's  access \nreproductive  health  services  and  benefit \napproximately 1.2 million women living in project operating districts (components \n1.2 and 1.3).  \nImprove  the  relevance  of  messages  that  encourage  women\u2019s  health-seeking \nbehavior, for themselves and for children (component 3.2).  \nInstitutionalize a gender-disaggregated M&E system (component 3.3) \n\n \n17. \nADB  will  work  with  the  Government  and  other  partners  to  ensure  that  the  gender \nstrategy is implemented. The Project will ensure the strategy\u2019s implementation. Annual reviews \nto be conducted jointly with all partners will ensure that the terms of the strategy are met, and a \ndiscussion on its progress will be included in progress reports. \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 October 2002) \n", "Currency Unit\nKR1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "riel (KR) \n$0.00026 \nKR3,835 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nAusAID \nBHSP \nCIDA \nCI \nCO \nCPA \nCMS \nCWM \nDBF \nDFID \nDPHI \nEIRR \nEMDP \nGFATM \nGTZ \n", "HCCC \nHCFC \nHCP \nHFC \nHWDP \nHIV/AIDS \n", "HSD \nIDA \nJICA \nM&E \nMDG \nMEF \nMOH \nMPA \nMTEF \nNGO \nOD \nPHD \nPRSP \nRTC \nSDR \nTA \nTB \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAustralian Agency for International Development \nBasic Health Services Project  \nCanadian International Development Agency \ncontracting-in \ncontracting-out \ncomplementary package of activity \nCentral Medical Store \nCivil Works Manager  \nDepartment of Budget and Finance  \nDepartment for International Development \nDepartment of Planning and Health Information \neconomic internal rate of return  \nEthnic Minorities Development Plan \nGlobal Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria \nDeutsche Gesellschaft fuer Technische Zusammerarbeit \n(German Agency for Technical Cooperation) \nhealth center community committee \nhealth center feedback committee \nhealth coverage plan \nHealth Finance Charter \nHealth Workforce Development Plan  \nhuman immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency \nsyndrome \nHospital Services Department \nInternational Development Association \nJapan International Cooperation Agency \nmonitoring and evaluation \nMillennium Development Goal \nMinistry of Economy and Finance \nMinistry of Health \nminimum package of activity \nmedium-term expenditure framework \nnongovernment organization  \nOperating district \nprovincial health department \npoverty reduction strategy paper \nregional training center \nspecial drawing right \ntechnical assistance  \ntuberculosis  \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "UN \nUSAID \nWHO \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "United Nations  \nUnited States Agency for International Development \nWorld Health Organization \n \n \nNOTES \n \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December. \nIn this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars. \n", "This  report  was  prepared  by  a  team  consisting  of:  I.
