THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Mongolia for the Skills for Employment Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will improve the employability of graduates from technical and vocational \neducation and training (TVET) programs and courses in three priority sectors of the economy in \nMongolia: agriculture, construction, and road and transportation.2 The project, which has several \ninnovative features, will (i) develop an industry-driven TVET system; (ii) upgrade selected TVET \nproviders  to  implement  competency-based  training  and  assessment;  (iii)  establish  training \nsystems for TVET teachers and managers; (iv) support secondary education career guidance \nand schools that specialize in technology; and (v) establish an effective project management \nsystem.3  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.   Rationale \n \n3.  Mongolia\u2019s  economy  has  grown  rapidly  with  a  two-fold  increase  in  gross  domestic \nproduct (GDP) per capita from 2001 to 2012,4 due in large part to the booming mining sector, \nwhich boosted its share of GDP from 9.0% to 18.6%. The rapid growth of the economy has \nsignificantly changed the structure of employment and the demand for skills. In 2012, the \nagriculture sector  share of GDP (14.8%) was second after the mining sector, while agriculture \nemployed  the  largest  proportion  of  the  labor  force  (35.0%),  but  its  share  of  GDP  and \nemployment decreased by more than 10 percentage points  during 2001-2012. The share of \nemployment in the construction and mining sectors, on the other hand, had almost doubled in \nthe same period, accounting for 5.6% (construction) and 4.4% (mining) in 2012. The three \npriority sectors (agriculture, construction, and road and transportation) contributed 22.9% of \nGDP as a whole and employed 45.9% of the labor force; women accounted for a minority of \nemployment (46.8% in agriculture, 21.1% in construction, and 19.8% in transportation and \nstorage).5  \n \n4.  The supply of skills, however, has not responded flexibly to labor market demand. \nDespite a strong demand for skilled workers, only 55.6% of TVET graduates found employment \nin 2012;6 the labor force participation rate remained at 63.6%, lower than the world average;7 \nand the national unemployment rate was 8.2%, with higher rates in urban areas (9.7%), and \namong youths aged 20\u201324 (18.3% for women, 16.1% for men). This situation can be partly \nexplained by the country\u2019s TVET system whose linkages with industries and employers were \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The programs are in general of 2.5\u20133.0 years\u2019 duration, leading to complete secondary and vocational certificates. \nThe duration of a course is up to 1 year and upon completion, a vocational certificate is issued. \n3  The Asian Development Bank provided technical assistance funded by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction: \nADB. 2012.

The  global  average  labor  force \nparticipation rate was 69%.  \n ", "2 \nweakened considerably during the transition from central planning to a market-based economy, \nand have never been fully restored.  \n \n5.  The shortage of skilled workers constrains growth in some key sectors of the Mongolian \neconomy. First, although Mongolia has unique and abundant agricultural resources, these have \nremained largely underutilized because of poor product quality and productivity, despite recent \nfavorable  government  policies  to  support  the  introduction  of  modern  technology  in  the \nproduction and the processing of agricultural products. This underutilization can be explained in \npart by difficulties in finding skilled workers in the sector. Second, the recent growth of public \nand private investments in housing and public facility development has generated employment \nopportunities in the building construction sector, which recorded the largest number of job \nvacancies of all sectors in Mongolia in the first quarter of 2013.8 Third, Mongolia is large, \nsparsely populated and landlocked, and the government has invested in road and railway \nconstruction projects to improve connectivity, both internally and with neighboring countries. \nHowever, serious shortages of skilled workers have often forced contractors to hire foreign \nworkers.9 \n \n6.  To  improve  the  responsiveness  of  the  TVET  system  to  labor  market  demand,  the \ngovernment initiated reforms beginning in the 2000s that have involved employers, and industry \nand professional associations. The amendment to the TVET law in 2009 was a landmark in \nrecent TVET  system  reforms, establishing  a  specialized  TVET  agency,10 and  the  National \nCouncil on Vocational Education and Training (NCVET) as an institution to actively engage \nemployers, and industry and professional associations in TVET policy development. Four sector \nsubcouncils have been established under NCVET, but NCVET and the sector subcouncils have \nyet  to  become  functional.  With  the  support  of  development  partners,  competency-based \ncurricula  (CBC)  have  been  developed  for  certain  occupations, 11 using  standards  set  in \ncollaboration with some employers. However, no standards have been approved by NCVET or \nsector  subcouncils  and  widely  recognized  by  the  relevant  employers,  and  industry  and \nprofessional associations. CBCs were introduced relatively recently, and remain in an early \nstage of implementation. Moreover, graduates from TVET programs and courses have not been \nindependently assessed and certified, and competency varies across TVET providers, programs, \nand courses.   \n \n7.  In SY2012/13, there were 75 formal TVET providers,12  49 of which were public. The \ngovernment is the largest financier in the TVET sector, enabling public providers to offer tuition-\nfree TVET, with dormitories and teaching\u2013learning materials that are largely free. Private TVET \nproviders are also subsidized by the government. Student enrollment was 45,225 in SY2012/13; \n                                                \n8  Data from the Labor Exchange Central Office indicates the construction sector had 73,246 out of 249,791 job \nvacancies (29.3%).  \n9  The construction sector employed the largest number of foreign workers (21.6%) of all sectors, followed by the \nmining sector (18.3%), and the transportation and storage sector (13.4%). (Government of Mongolia, Ministry of \nLabor, Employment Service Center. 2013. Report on Labor Market Trend in February 2013. Ulaanbaatar.) \n10 Prior to the establishment of the Agency for Vocational Education and Training, the former Ministry of Education, \nCulture, and Science was responsible for TVET along with the other levels of education. The agency was \ndisbanded in 2012 with responsibility for TVET transferred to the newly created Ministry of Labor.  \n11 The list of occupations for which CBC have been developed is in Appendix 4 of the Project Administration Manual \n(PAM, accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n12 The 75 formal TVET providers include 40 vocational training production centers (18,629 students), 13 polytechnic \ncolleges (11,257 students), 7 branches of tertiary level institutes (5,884 students), and 15 branches of universities \n(9,455 students). Vocational training production centers offer both long-term programs (2.5\u20133.0 years leading to \ncomplete secondary and vocational certificates) and short-term courses (up to 1 year leading to vocational \ncertificates). Others provide short-term courses. Currently, levels of vocational certificates offered by different types \nof institutions are not clearly differentiated.  \n ", "    3 \n45.6% were female. In SY2011/12 program and course enrollment in the three priority sectors \nwas 2,088 in agriculture (27.3% female), 14,528 in construction (5.1% female), and 4,227 in \nroad and transportation (11.9% female). Although both the number of TVET providers and \nTVET enrollment have increased dramatically in less than a decade,13 most TVET programs \nand courses have been offered without adequate training equipment and facilities. With the \nexception  of  those  that  have  been  supplied  training  equipment  under  projects  funded  by \ndevelopment partners, many TVET providers, particularly in remote areas, have been operating \nwith training equipment that is outdated or can no longer be used, and training facilities that \nrequire repairs.14 Licenses have been given to TVET providers that meet basic requirements, \nbut these requirements are insufficient to ensure quality at program, course, and institution \nlevels. Inadequate training equipment and facilities are major constraints on the development of \na TVET system that is responsive to labor market demand.  \n \n8.  The lack of both technical and vocational skills and experience among teachers is \nanother  constraint  faced  by  the  TVET  system.  In  SY2012/13,  there  were  2,236  full-time \nteachers; 1,468 (65.7%) taught technical and vocational subjects, but about 92.5% of them had \nonly 0\u20134 years of industry experience in the subjects they teach. Most TVET teachers have \nbeen trained as general secondary education teachers, because qualifications for teachers in \nthe TVET system have not been clearly specified.15 Institutional mechanisms for in-service \ntraining for teachers in technical and vocational skills are almost non-existent. Additionally, most \nmanagement staff of TVET providers lack the industry experience and skills needed to develop \nand manage TVET programs and courses in collaboration with employers, and industry and \nprofessional associations.  \n \n9.  Because of its poor public image, TVET remains a secondary option to most students \nand parents. The growth of student TVET enrollment has resulted largely from the monthly \nstipends given to TVET students, rather than their informed choice. Career information and \nguidance have not been provided for junior secondary students, who must choose between \nsenior secondary education and TVET after graduation. As a result, TVET has enrolled students \nwho are generally academically less successful and come from poorer families. Notwithstanding \nacademic success, existing senior secondary and tertiary education do a poor job of preparing \nstudents for work, as evidenced by the low labor force participation rates for youths aged 15\u201324, \nand high unemployment rates for graduates from tertiary education. \n \n10.  Strategic fit. The Government Platform, 2012\u20132016 highlights employment as one of \nfive goals in creating a sustainable and competitive economy.16 Many initiatives are underway to \nreform TVET and general education systems in order to better prepare the country\u2019s labor force. \nThe  project  will  support  the  government\u2019s  reform  initiatives  in  the  TVET  and  secondary \neducation  sectors.  The  project  is  included  in  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\u2019s  country \noperations business plan, 2014\u20132016 for Mongolia, and is aligned with ADB\u2019s interim country \npartnership strategy, 2014\u20132016 for Mongolia, which has a focus on achieving inclusive growth \nand social development through broad-based employment generation.17  \n \n                                                \n13 Government of Mongolia, Ministry of Education, Culture, and Science. 2010.

In 2005, there were only 38 formal TVET providers which enrolled 23,249 students.  \n14 Total public expenditures on TVET are estimated to be less than 1% of GDP, of which capital expenditures are \naround 10%.  \n15 The Law on Vocational Education and Training (Article 18) requires TVET teachers to have \u201dproper experience in \nproduction work\u201d and \u201da high vocational degree\u201d; these have not yet been defined.  \n16  Government of Mongolia. 2012.

The project will introduce several innovations to Mongolia\u2019s TVET \nsystem, including (i) support for sector subcouncils, industry and professional associations, and \nemployers to set standards for TVET programs and courses; (ii) creation of an independent \ncompetence assessment and certification system; (iii)  strengthening of workplace training for \nTVET students and teachers; (iv) introduction of career guidance in junior secondary schools \nprior to tracking; and (v) development of a credit transfer system between senior secondary \neducation, tertiary education, and TVET within a national qualifications framework.  \n \n12.  Lessons. The project builds on past and ongoing projects in the TVET sector supported \nby development partners and the private sector.18 It also draws on lessons from previous \ninvolvement by ADB in the Mongolian TVET and general education sectors.19 Major lessons \nfrom these projects are (i) various interventions\u2014such as development of training curricula and \nmaterials, upgrading of equipment and facilities, and training for TVET teachers\u2014need to be \naligned  with  standards  set  in  collaboration  with  employers,  and  industry  and  professional \nassociations; (ii) institutionalized technical and vocational skills training for TVET teachers is \nindispensable for keeping skills of TVET teachers upgraded; (iii) provision of career information \nand guidance in early grades is essential to enable students to make an informed choice \nregarding  their  career,  and  prepare  for  work;  and  (iv)  active  public  communication  and \nconsultations are key to sustainable reforms of TVET and general education systems.  \n \nB.   Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The impact of the project will be increased employment in the three priority sectors \n(agriculture, construction, and road and transportation). The outcome of the project will be \nenhanced responsiveness of the TVET system to labor market demand in the three priority \nsectors.  \n \nC.   Outputs \n \n14.  The project will have five outputs: \n \n15.  Output 1: Industry-driven technical and vocational education and training system \nestablished in the three priority sectors. The project will, in collaboration with employers, and \nindustry and professional associations, support the establishment of an industry-driven TVET \nsystem in the three priority sectors by (i) developing occupational and other related standards \nfor key occupations; and (ii) establishing accredited assessment and certification centers with \nrehabilitated and/or refurbished testing facilities, adequate testing equipment, and accredited \ncenter personnel.20 The role of sector subcouncils in developing, approving, and registering \nstandards, and assessment and certification, will be reviewed and strengthened.    \n \n                                                \n18 Major development partners and the private sector that have supported the Mongolian TVET sector include the \nEuropean  Commission,  German  development  cooperation  through  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Internationale \nZusammenarbeit, the Korean International Cooperation Agency, the Millennium Challenge Account-Mongolia, Oyu \nTolgoi LLC, Singapore Polytechnic, and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation. \n19 ADB. 2001.

The financing plan is in Table 2 and is further detailed in the project \nadministration manual (PAM).24  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nSource  Amount ($ million)    Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank (Asian Development Fund)  25.00    87.4 \nGovernment    3.59    12.6 \n  Total    28.59    100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.   Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  The Ministry of Labor (MOL) will be the executing agency and oversee overall project \nimplementation and management activities. MOL will be the implementing agency for outputs 1, \n2, 3, and 5, while the Ministry of Education and Science (MEDS) will be the implementing \nagency for output 4. A project steering committee, chaired by the minister of labor, will approve \nannual budgets and plans for the project, and guide and support project implementation.

The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and \ndescribed in detail in the PAM (footnote 24). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  May 2015\u2013May 2019 \nEstimated completion date  31 May 2019 (estimated closing date: 30 November 2019) \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  A PSC will be established by MOL. The PSC will be chaired by MOL and \ncomposed of senior officials of MOL, MEDS, and the Ministry of Finance; \nand  representatives  of  employers,  and  industry  and  professional \nassociations. \n(ii)   Executing agency  MOL will be the executing agency of the project.  \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  MOL will be the implementing agency for outputs 1, 2, 3, and 5. MEDS will be \nthe implementing agency for output 4. \n(iv)  Implementation unit  A PIU will be established by MOL. On behalf of the executing agency and \nimplementing  agencies,  the  PIU  will  be  responsible  for  the  day-to-day \nmanagement of the project. The PIU will be staffed by a project manager, a \nproject  coordinator  responsible  for  output  4,  a  procurement  specialist,  an \naccountant and financial management specialist, a competency-based training \nand assessment specialist, a training specialist, a monitoring and evaluation \nspecialist, an education specialist (senior secondary technology subject), an \neducation specialist (career guidance), a project assistant, and a driver.   \nProcurement  International competitive bidding  10 contracts  $17,605,000 \nNational competitive bidding  9 contracts  $3,120,000 \nShopping  11 contracts  $385,000 \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost-based selection  38 person-months  $318,500 \nConsultants\u2019 qualifications selectiona  57 person-months  $316,650 \nIndividual consultants selectionb  55 person-months  $482,295 \nRetroactive financing and/or  Advance contracting for three consulting services will be provided.  \nadvance contracting \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, MEDS = Ministry of Education and Science, MOL = Ministry of Labor, PIU = project \nimplementation unit, PSC = project steering committee.  \na  Two consulting firms will be recruited through the consultants\u2019 qualifications selection method on the grounds that \nhighly  specialized  expertise  is  required,  recruitment  time  is  critical  and  the  assignment  is  short-term,  few \nconsultants are qualified, and the process of preparing and evaluating competitive proposals is unjustified. \nb  A total of 14 consultants will be engaged through the individual consultants selection method because collective \nresponsibility is not needed, while individual experience and qualifications are the main requirements.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.   Technical  \n \n23.  The project will upgrade selected TVET providers by supplying up-to-date equipment \nand rehabilitating or refurbishing training facilities. Equipment to be supplied will meet standards \nset  by  industries  and  employers  to  ensure  the  quality  of  TVET  programs  and  courses. \nMaintenance and training services included in the supply contracts will enhance local capacity \nfor the use, operation, and maintenance of the supplied equipment. Training facilities will be \nrehabilitated or refurbished in accordance with the national regulations, standards, and codes. \nThe project outputs have been designed to incorporate international best practices, such as \nstrengthening  of  sector  subcouncils,  involvement  of  industries  and  employers  in  the \ndevelopment of standards, and enhancement of workplace training for TVET students and \nteachers.  \n ", "8 \nB.   Economic and Financial \n \n24.  Economic  benefits.  The  economic  benefits  of  the  project  were  estimated  as  the \nincremental value of higher earnings that graduates from TVET programs and courses can \nexpect in the labor market as a result of improved skills attributable to the project. Other \neconomic benefits were not considered due to practical constraints in quantifying the benefits. \nIncremental earnings for graduates who would work as full-time employees in occupations \nrelated to their training were conservatively assumed at 60%\u201380% of the average monthly \nsalaries for the occupations. Estimating these benefits over the 25-year loan period and based \non the total project cost of $28.59 million, yielded an economic internal rate of return of 22.76%. \nThe economic internal rate of return, tested through sensitivity analysis, stood at 19.84%. The \nproject is considered economically viable.  \n \n25.  Financial  sustainability. The project has no revenue-generating component hence, \nfinancial costs and benefits were not analyzed. The financial sustainability of the project was \nassessed at the fiscal and project levels. An analysis of recent and projected government \nexpenditures was undertaken to evaluate the potential impact of the project on the budget of \nMOL  and  MEDS.  The  government  will  fund  $3.59  million,  comprising  recurrent  costs  and \ncontingencies. The government\u2019s annual commitment to the project as a percentage of the total \nbudget of MOL and MEDS is estimated to be 0.10% in 2015, 0.09% in 2016, 0.13% in 2017, \n0.03% in 2018, and 0.01% in 2019. The government\u2019s annual commitment to the project, \ntherefore, is considered affordable.  \n \nC.   Governance \n \n26.  Procurement capacity assessments have been carried out for MOL and MEDS. The two \nministries have reasonable capacity to conduct procurement in compliance with the relevant \nnational laws and regulations on public procurement. MEDS, through past and ongoing ADB \nprojects, has experience in procurement using ADB policies and procedures. The procurement \ncapacity of MOL will be strengthened by recruiting a procurement specialist to the PIU that will \nbe supported by consultants specialized in project implementation start-up, equipment, and civil \nworks.  All  procurement  under  the  project  will  be  carried  out  by  MOL  and  MEDS,  and \ncoordinated by the PIU.   \n \n27.  Financial management assessments conducted for MOL and MEDS confirmed that both \nhave adequate accounting professionals, and computerized financial accounting and reporting \nsystems and procedures related to their current project activities. The entity- and project-specific \nrisks were rated as substantial, however, due to weaknesses identified in budget planning and \nexecution at sector and local levels, key internal controls surrounding the government financial \nmanagement information system, internal audit functions, and experience with donor-funded \nprojects. These weaknesses will be addressed by providing training for MOL and MEDS staff \nand strengthening capacity of MOL and MEDS through the PIU. The PIU will be equipped with \nan integrated financial management system and staffed by qualified professionals\u2014including an \naccountant and financial management specialist, a project manager, and a project coordinator\u2014\nto ensure the project is implemented in compliance with ADB policy, operational, and procedural \nrequirements. Annual project audits will be arranged by the National Audit Office. \n \n28.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, MOL, and MEDS. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 24). \n \n ", "    9 \nD.   Poverty and Social \n \n29.  The project  will directly benefit young students, who are enrolled in selected TVET \nproviders, and generally come from poorer families and are academically less successful; and \nadult  students  who  are  unemployed  or  looking for  better  employment  opportunities. TVET \nproviders in remote and disadvantaged areas will be prioritized if they present self-assessment \nreports and quality improvement plans that fulfill selection criteria. About 15,500 students will \ncomplete competency-based training programs (3,500 students) and courses (12,000 students) \nfor the key occupations that meet standards set in collaboration with employers, and industry \nand  professional  associations;  as  a  consequence,  they  are  expected  to  have  improved \nemployment opportunities. The project will reach eighth and ninth grade students in all junior \nsecondary schools (99,920 in SY2012/13) with career information and guidance in order to help \nthem  make  an  informed  choice  among  TVET  programs,  and  between  TVET  and  senior \nsecondary education, and to better prepare them for work. Better preparation in earlier grades is \nessential to counteract the high youth unemployment rate.  \n \n30.  Gender benefits. The project is designed to have gender equity as a theme, because \nthe project will directly address gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment by narrowing \ngender disparities through access to TVET. The unemployment rate for women aged 20\u201324 has \nbeen  higher  than  that  for  men.  TVET  generally  enrolls  fewer  female  than  male  students, \nwhereas senior secondary and tertiary education have been enrolling more female than male \nstudents.25  A gender action plan has been developed to ensure that gender disparities are \naddressed. The plan ensures the collection of sex-disaggregated data for planning and decision \nsupport,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation;  gender  sensitivity  for  public  communication  and \nconsultations; general participation of female management staff and teachers in training (at \nleast 37% will be women); identification and training of female master trainers (about 17%); \nparticipation of female students in internships (about 29%); development of gender-sensitive \ncareer guidance modules; and training of eighth and ninth grade teachers in gender-sensitive \ncareer guidance (70%).   \n \nE.   Safeguards \n \n31.  Environment. The project is classified category C for the environment. The project \ninvolves minor civil works, limited to the rehabilitation of existing buildings under outputs 1 and 2.            \nA  simplified  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  was  prepared, 26 defining \neligibility criteria for civil works, as well as environment management, supervision, and reporting \nresponsibilities of selected TVET providers and contractors during minor civil works to avoid \nnegative impacts on the environment, and health and safety. \n \n32.  Involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  as \ncategory C for involuntary resettlement. The project involves minor civil works that will be \ncarried out on existing government land and no land acquisition and resettlement impacts are \nanticipated. The project is classified as category C for indigenous peoples. The assessment \ndetermined that indigenous peoples will not be negatively impacted.  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n25  In SY2012/13, females accounted for 45.6% of TVET enrollment, 54.1% of senior secondary education enrollment, \nand 58.3% of tertiary education enrollment.  \n26  The simplified environment assessment and review framework is in Appendix 3 of the PAM. \n ", "10 \nF.   Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n33.
