The  rapid  growth  of  the  economy  has \nsignificantly  changed  the  structure  of  employment  and  the  demand  for  skills.  In  2012,  the \nagriculture sector  share of GDP (14.8%) was second after the mining sector, while agriculture \nemployed  the  largest  proportion  of  the  labor  force  (35.0%),  but  its  share  of  GDP  and \nemployment  decreased  by  more  than  10  percentage  points    during  2001-2012.  The  share  of \nemployment  in the  construction  and mining  sectors,  on the  other  hand,  had  almost  doubled  in \nthe  same  period,  accounting  for  5.6%  (construction)  and  4.4%  (mining)  in  2012.  The  three \npriority  sectors  (agriculture,  construction,  and  road  and  transportation)  contributed  22.9%  of \nGDP  as  a  whole  and  employed  45.9%  of  the  labor  force;  women  accounted  for  a  minority  of \nemployment  (46.8%  in  agriculture,  21.1%  in  construction,  and  19.8%  in  transportation  and \nstorage).5  \n \n4. \nThe  supply  of  skills,  however,  has  not  responded  flexibly  to  labor  market  demand. \nDespite a strong demand for skilled workers, only 55.6% of TVET graduates found employment \nin  2012;6 the  labor  force  participation  rate  remained  at  63.6%,  lower  than  the  world  average;7 \nand  the  national  unemployment  rate  was  8.2%,  with  higher  rates  in  urban  areas  (9.7%),  and \namong  youths  aged  20\u201324  (18.3%  for  women,  16.1%  for  men).  This  situation  can  be  partly \nexplained  by  the  country\u2019s  TVET  system  whose  linkages  with  industries  and  employers  were \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The programs are in general of 2.5\u20133.0 years\u2019 duration, leading to complete secondary and vocational certificates. \n\nThe duration of a course is up to 1 year and upon completion, a vocational certificate is issued. \n\n3  The  Asian  Development  Bank  provided  technical  assistance  funded  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction: \nADB. 2012.

The  global  average  labor  force \n\neducation institutions in 2012.  \n\nparticipation rate was 69%.  \n\n \n\n\fweakened considerably during the transition from central planning to a market-based economy, \nand have never been fully restored.  \n\n \n5. \nThe shortage of skilled workers constrains growth in some key sectors of the Mongolian \neconomy. First, although Mongolia has unique and abundant agricultural resources, these have \nremained largely underutilized because of poor product quality and productivity, despite recent \nfavorable  government  policies  to  support  the  introduction  of  modern  technology  in  the \nproduction and the processing of agricultural products. This underutilization can be explained in \npart  by  difficulties  in  finding  skilled  workers  in  the  sector.  Second,  the  recent  growth  of  public \nand private investments in housing and public facility development has generated employment \nopportunities  in  the  building  construction  sector,  which  recorded  the  largest  number  of  job \nvacancies  of  all  sectors  in  Mongolia  in  the  first  quarter  of  2013. 8 Third,  Mongolia  is  large, \nsparsely  populated  and  landlocked,  and  the  government  has  invested  in  road  and  railway \nconstruction  projects  to  improve  connectivity,  both  internally  and  with  neighboring  countries. \nHowever,  serious  shortages  of  skilled  workers  have  often  forced  contractors  to  hire  foreign \nworkers.9 \n \n6. \nTo  improve  the  responsiveness  of  the  TVET  system  to  labor  market  demand,  the \ngovernment initiated reforms beginning in the 2000s that have involved employers, and industry \nand  professional  associations.  The  amendment  to  the  TVET  law  in  2009  was  a  landmark  in \nrecent  TVET  system  reforms,  establishing  a  specialized  TVET  agency, 10  and  the  National \nCouncil  on  Vocational  Education  and  Training  (NCVET)  as  an  institution  to  actively  engage \nemployers, and industry and professional associations in TVET policy development. Four sector \nsubcouncils have been established under NCVET, but NCVET and the sector subcouncils have \nyet  to  become  functional.  With  the  support  of  development  partners,  competency-based \ncurricula  (CBC)  have  been  developed  for  certain  occupations, 11  using  standards  set  in \ncollaboration with some employers. However, no standards have been approved by NCVET or \nsector  subcouncils  and  widely  recognized  by  the  relevant  employers,  and  industry  and \nprofessional  associations.  CBCs  were  introduced  relatively  recently,  and  remain  in  an  early \nstage of implementation. Moreover, graduates from TVET programs and courses have not been \nindependently assessed and certified, and competency varies across TVET providers, programs, \nand courses.   \n \nIn  SY2012/13,  there  were  75  formal  TVET  providers,12   49  of  which  were  public.  The \n7. \ngovernment is the largest financier in the TVET sector, enabling public providers to offer tuition-\nfree TVET, with dormitories and teaching\u2013learning materials that are largely free. Private TVET \nproviders are also subsidized by the government. Student enrollment was 45,225 in SY2012/13; \n\n                                                \n8  Data  from  the  Labor  Exchange  Central  Office  indicates  the  construction  sector  had  73,246  out  of  249,791  job \n\nvacancies (29.3%).  \n\n9  The  construction  sector  employed  the  largest  number  of  foreign  workers  (21.6%)  of  all  sectors,  followed  by  the \nmining  sector  (18.3%),  and  the  transportation  and  storage  sector  (13.4%).  (Government  of  Mongolia,  Ministry  of \nLabor, Employment Service Center. 2013. Report on Labor Market Trend in February 2013. Ulaanbaatar.) \n\n10 Prior to the establishment of the Agency for Vocational Education and Training, the former Ministry of Education, \nCulture,  and  Science  was  responsible  for  TVET  along  with  the  other  levels  of  education.  The  agency  was \ndisbanded in 2012 with responsibility for TVET transferred to the newly created Ministry of Labor.  \n\n11  The list of occupations for which CBC have been developed is in Appendix 4 of the Project Administration Manual \n\n(PAM, accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n12  The 75 formal TVET providers include 40 vocational training production centers (18,629 students), 13 polytechnic \ncolleges (11,257 students), 7 branches of tertiary level institutes (5,884 students), and 15 branches of universities \n(9,455  students).  Vocational  training  production  centers  offer  both  long-term  programs  (2.5\u20133.0  years  leading  to \ncomplete  secondary  and  vocational  certificates)  and  short-term  courses  (up  to  1  year  leading  to  vocational \ncertificates). Others provide short-term courses. Currently, levels of vocational certificates offered by different types \nof institutions are not clearly differentiated.  \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\n45.6% were female. In SY2011/12 program and course enrollment in the three priority sectors \nwas  2,088  in  agriculture  (27.3%  female),  14,528  in  construction  (5.1%  female),  and  4,227  in \nroad  and  transportation  (11.9%  female).  Although  both  the  number  of  TVET  providers  and \nTVET  enrollment  have  increased  dramatically  in  less  than  a  decade,13 most  TVET  programs \nand  courses  have  been  offered  without  adequate  training  equipment  and  facilities.  With  the \nexception  of  those  that  have  been  supplied  training  equipment  under  projects  funded  by \ndevelopment partners, many TVET providers, particularly in remote areas, have been operating \nwith  training  equipment  that  is  outdated  or  can  no  longer  be  used,  and  training  facilities  that \nrequire  repairs.14 Licenses  have  been  given  to  TVET  providers  that  meet  basic  requirements, \nbut  these  requirements  are  insufficient  to  ensure  quality  at  program,  course,  and  institution \nlevels. Inadequate training equipment and facilities are major constraints on the development of \na TVET system that is responsive to labor market demand.  \n \n8. \nThe  lack  of  both  technical  and  vocational  skills  and  experience  among  teachers  is \nanother  constraint  faced  by  the  TVET  system.  In  SY2012/13,  there  were  2,236  full-time \nteachers; 1,468 (65.7%) taught technical and vocational subjects, but about 92.5% of them had \nonly  0\u20134  years  of  industry  experience  in  the  subjects  they  teach.  Most  TVET  teachers  have \nbeen  trained  as  general  secondary  education  teachers,  because  qualifications  for  teachers  in \nthe  TVET  system  have  not  been  clearly  specified. 15 Institutional  mechanisms  for  in-service \ntraining for teachers in technical and vocational skills are almost non-existent. Additionally, most \nmanagement staff of TVET providers lack the industry experience and skills needed to develop \nand  manage  TVET  programs  and  courses  in  collaboration  with  employers,  and  industry  and \nprofessional associations.  \n\n \nBecause  of  its  poor  public  image,  TVET  remains  a  secondary  option  to  most  students \n9. \nand  parents.  The  growth  of  student  TVET  enrollment  has  resulted  largely  from  the  monthly \nstipends  given  to  TVET  students,  rather  than  their  informed  choice.  Career  information  and \nguidance  have  not  been  provided  for  junior  secondary  students,  who  must  choose  between \nsenior secondary education and TVET after graduation. As a result, TVET has enrolled students \nwho are generally academically less successful and come from poorer families. Notwithstanding \nacademic success, existing senior secondary and tertiary education do a poor job of preparing \nstudents for work, as evidenced by the low labor force participation rates for youths aged 15\u201324, \nand high unemployment rates for graduates from tertiary education. \n \n10. \nStrategic  fit.  The  Government  Platform,  2012\u20132016  highlights  employment  as  one  of \nfive goals in creating a sustainable and competitive economy.16 Many initiatives are underway to \nreform TVET and general education systems in order to better prepare the country\u2019s labor force. \nThe  project  will  support  the  government\u2019s  reform  initiatives  in  the  TVET  and  secondary \neducation  sectors.  The  project  is  included  in  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\u2019s  country \noperations  business  plan,  2014\u20132016  for  Mongolia,  and  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  interim  country \npartnership strategy, 2014\u20132016 for Mongolia, which has a focus on achieving inclusive growth \nand social development through broad-based employment generation.17  \n \n\n                                                \n13 Government  of  Mongolia,  Ministry  of  Education,  Culture,  and  Science.  2010.

In 2005, there were only 38 formal TVET providers which enrolled 23,249 students.  \n\n14  Total  public  expenditures  on  TVET  are  estimated  to  be  less  than  1%  of  GDP,  of  which  capital  expenditures  are \n\naround 10%.  \n\n15 The Law on Vocational Education and Training (Article 18) requires TVET teachers to have \u201dproper experience in \n\nproduction work\u201d and \u201da high vocational degree\u201d; these have not yet been defined.  \n\n16  Government of Mongolia. 2012.

The project builds on past and ongoing projects in the TVET sector supported \n12. \nby  development  partners  and  the  private  sector. 18 It  also  draws  on  lessons  from  previous \ninvolvement  by  ADB  in  the  Mongolian  TVET  and  general  education  sectors.19 Major  lessons \nfrom these projects are (i) various interventions\u2014such as development of training curricula and \nmaterials,  upgrading  of  equipment  and  facilities,  and  training  for  TVET  teachers\u2014need  to  be \naligned  with  standards  set  in  collaboration  with  employers,  and  industry  and  professional \nassociations;  (ii)  institutionalized  technical  and  vocational  skills  training  for  TVET  teachers  is \nindispensable for keeping skills of TVET teachers upgraded; (iii) provision of career information \nand  guidance  in  early  grades  is  essential  to  enable  students  to  make  an  informed  choice \nregarding  their  career,  and  prepare  for  work;  and  (iv)  active  public  communication  and \nconsultations are key to sustainable reforms of TVET and general education systems.  \n \nB.  \n \n13. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  increased  employment  in  the  three  priority  sectors \n(agriculture,  construction,  and  road  and  transportation).  The  outcome  of  the  project  will  be \nenhanced  responsiveness  of  the  TVET  system  to  labor  market  demand  in  the  three  priority \nsectors.  \n \nC.  \n \n14. \n \n15. \nOutput 1: Industry-driven technical and vocational education and training system \nestablished in the three priority sectors. The project will, in collaboration with employers, and \nindustry  and  professional  associations,  support  the  establishment  of  an  industry-driven  TVET \nsystem  in the  three  priority  sectors  by  (i)  developing  occupational  and  other  related  standards \nfor  key  occupations;  and  (ii)  establishing  accredited  assessment  and  certification  centers  with \nrehabilitated  and/or  refurbished  testing  facilities,  adequate  testing  equipment,  and  accredited \ncenter  personnel. 20 The  role  of  sector  subcouncils  in  developing,  approving,  and  registering \nstandards, and assessment and certification, will be reviewed and strengthened.    \n \n\nThe project will have five outputs: \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                \n18 Major  development  partners  and  the  private  sector  that  have  supported  the  Mongolian  TVET  sector  include  the \nEuropean  Commission,  German  development  cooperation  through  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Internationale \nZusammenarbeit, the Korean International Cooperation Agency, the Millennium Challenge Account-Mongolia, Oyu \nTolgoi LLC, Singapore Polytechnic, and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation. \n\n19  ADB.  2001.

DUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical  \n\n \nA.  \n \n23. \nThe  project  will  upgrade  selected  TVET  providers  by  supplying  up-to-date  equipment \nand rehabilitating or refurbishing training facilities. Equipment to be supplied will meet standards \nset  by  industries  and  employers  to  ensure  the  quality  of  TVET  programs  and  courses. \nMaintenance and training services included in the supply contracts will enhance local capacity \nfor  the  use,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  the  supplied  equipment.  Training  facilities  will  be \nrehabilitated  or refurbished  in  accordance  with the  national regulations, standards,  and  codes. \nThe  project  outputs  have  been  designed  to  incorporate  international  best  practices,  such  as \nstrengthening  of  sector  subcouncils, \nthe \ndevelopment  of  standards,  and  enhancement  of  workplace  training  for  TVET  students  and \nteachers.  \n\nindustries  and  employers \n\ninvolvement  of \n\nin \n\n \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nB.  \n \n24. \nEconomic  benefits.  The  economic  benefits  of  the  project  were  estimated  as  the \nincremental  value  of  higher  earnings  that  graduates  from  TVET  programs  and  courses  can \nexpect  in  the  labor  market  as  a  result  of  improved  skills  attributable  to  the  project.  Other \neconomic  benefits  were not considered  due  to  practical  constraints  in quantifying the  benefits. \nIncremental  earnings  for  graduates  who  would  work  as  full-time  employees  in  occupations \nrelated  to  their  training  were  conservatively  assumed  at  60%\u201380%  of  the  average  monthly \nsalaries for the occupations. Estimating these benefits over the 25-year loan period and based \non the total project cost of $28.59 million, yielded an economic internal rate of return of 22.76%. \nThe economic internal rate of return, tested through sensitivity analysis,  stood at 19.84%. The \nproject is considered economically viable.  \n \n25. \nFinancial  sustainability.  The  project  has  no  revenue-generating  component  hence, \nfinancial  costs  and  benefits  were  not  analyzed.  The  financial  sustainability  of  the  project  was \nassessed  at  the  fiscal  and  project  levels.  An  analysis  of  recent  and  projected  government \nexpenditures  was  undertaken  to  evaluate  the  potential  impact  of  the  project  on  the  budget  of \nMOL  and  MEDS.  The  government  will  fund  $3.59  million,  comprising  recurrent  costs  and \ncontingencies. The government\u2019s annual commitment to the project as a percentage of the total \nbudget  of  MOL  and  MEDS  is  estimated  to  be  0.10%  in  2015,  0.09%  in  2016,  0.13%  in  2017, \n0.03%  in  2018,  and  0.01%  in  2019.  The  government\u2019s  annual  commitment  to  the  project, \ntherefore, is considered affordable.  \n \nC.  \n \n26. \nProcurement capacity assessments have been carried out for MOL and MEDS. The two \nministries  have  reasonable  capacity  to  conduct  procurement  in  compliance  with  the  relevant \nnational  laws  and  regulations  on  public  procurement.  MEDS,  through  past  and  ongoing  ADB \nprojects, has experience in procurement using ADB policies and procedures. The procurement \ncapacity of MOL will be strengthened by recruiting a procurement specialist to the PIU that will \nbe supported by consultants specialized in project implementation start-up, equipment, and civil \nworks.  All  procurement  under  the  project  will  be  carried  out  by  MOL  and  MEDS,  and \ncoordinated by the PIU.   \n \n27. \nFinancial management assessments conducted for MOL and MEDS confirmed that both \nhave  adequate  accounting  professionals,  and computerized  financial  accounting  and  reporting \nsystems and procedures related to their current project activities. The entity- and project-specific \nrisks were rated as substantial, however, due to weaknesses identified in budget planning and \nexecution at sector and local levels, key internal controls surrounding the government financial \nmanagement  information  system,  internal  audit  functions,  and  experience  with  donor-funded \nprojects.  These  weaknesses  will  be  addressed  by  providing  training  for  MOL  and  MEDS  staff \nand strengthening capacity of MOL and MEDS through the PIU. The PIU will be equipped with \nan integrated financial management system and staffed by qualified professionals\u2014including an \naccountant and financial management specialist, a project manager, and a project coordinator\u2014\nto ensure the project is implemented in compliance with ADB policy, operational, and procedural \nrequirements. Annual project audits will be arranged by the National Audit Office. \n \n28. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  MOL,  and  MEDS.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 24). \n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nD.  \n \n29. \nThe  project  will  directly  benefit  young  students,  who  are  enrolled  in  selected  TVET \nproviders, and generally come from poorer families and are academically less successful; and \nadult  students  who  are  unemployed  or  looking  for  better  employment  opportunities.  TVET \nproviders in remote and disadvantaged areas will be prioritized if they present self-assessment \nreports  and  quality  improvement  plans  that  fulfill  selection  criteria.  About  15,500  students  will \ncomplete competency-based training programs (3,500 students) and courses (12,000 students) \nfor  the  key  occupations  that  meet  standards  set  in  collaboration  with  employers,  and  industry \nand  professional  associations;  as  a  consequence,  they  are  expected  to  have  improved \nemployment  opportunities.  The  project  will  reach  eighth  and  ninth  grade  students  in  all  junior \nsecondary schools (99,920 in SY2012/13) with career information and guidance in order to help \nthem  make  an  informed  choice  among  TVET  programs,  and  between  TVET  and  senior \nsecondary education, and to better prepare them for work. Better preparation in earlier grades is \nessential to counteract the high youth unemployment rate.  \n \nGender  benefits.  The  project  is  designed to  have gender  equity  as  a theme,  because \n30. \nthe  project  will  directly  address  gender  equality  and/or  women\u2019s  empowerment  by  narrowing \ngender disparities through access to TVET. The unemployment rate for women aged 20\u201324 has \nbeen  higher  than  that  for  men.  TVET  generally  enrolls  fewer  female  than  male  students, \nwhereas  senior  secondary  and  tertiary  education  have  been  enrolling  more  female  than  male \nstudents.25   A  gender  action  plan  has  been  developed  to  ensure  that  gender  disparities  are \naddressed. The plan ensures the collection of sex-disaggregated data for planning and decision \nsupport,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation;  gender  sensitivity  for  public  communication  and \nconsultations;  general  participation  of  female  management  staff  and  teachers  in  training  (at \nleast  37%  will  be  women);  identification  and  training  of  female  master  trainers  (about  17%); \nparticipation  of  female  students  in  internships  (about  29%);  development  of  gender-sensitive \ncareer  guidance  modules;  and  training  of  eighth  and  ninth  grade  teachers  in  gender-sensitive \ncareer guidance (70%).   \n \nE.  \n \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  category  C  for  the  environment.  The  project \n31. \ninvolves minor civil works, limited to the rehabilitation of existing buildings under outputs 1 and 2.            \nA  simplified  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  was  prepared, 26  defining \neligibility criteria for civil works, as well as environment management, supervision, and reporting \nresponsibilities  of  selected  TVET  providers  and  contractors  during  minor  civil  works  to  avoid \nnegative impacts on the environment, and health and safety. \n \n32. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  as \ncategory  C  for  involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  involves  minor  civil  works  that  will  be \ncarried  out  on  existing  government  land  and  no  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  are \nanticipated.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples.  The  assessment \ndetermined that indigenous peoples will not be negatively impacted.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n25  In SY2012/13, females accounted for 45.6% of TVET enrollment, 54.1% of senior secondary education enrollment, \n\nand 58.3% of tertiary education enrollment.  \n\n26  The simplified environment assessment and review framework is in Appendix 3 of the PAM. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nF.   \n \n33. \nThe overall benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs and risks involved. \nMajor  risks  and mitigating measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in  detail  in the \nrisk assessment and risk management plan.27  \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nMitigating Measures \nConsult with and involve major stakeholders in and outside of government during \nproject  implementation,  allocate  funding  for  public  communication  on  project \nactivities  to  build  a  broad  base  of  support  for  project  activities,  and  engage  a \ncommunication specialist to develop a communication strategy \nBegin  consultations  with  and  capacity  development  of  major  industry  and \nprofessional associations identified in the three priority sectors in the early stages \nof project implementation \n\nRisks \nChanged government priorities \naffect policies and the \ngovernment\u2019s commitment to \nproject activities  \nSlow consensus-building \nprocesses on occupational and \nother standards among \nemployers, and industry and \nprofessional associations, delay \nproject implementation \nLimited experience of MOL with \nADB projects results in \nprocurement delays,  \nmisprocurement, and \nirregularities \nLack of capacity for compliance \nwith the ADB guidelines and \nprocedures, and environmental \nassessment and review \nframework, causes delays \nMEDS = Ministry of Education and Science, MOL = Ministry of Labor, PIU = project implementation unit. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n  \n\nBefore loan effectiveness, identify and train staff of the PIU that will assume day-\nto-day  management  of  the  project  including  procurement,  disbursement,  and \nfinancial management; train MOL staff in applicable ADB guidelines, policies, and \nregulations  (by  project  implementation  start-up  specialist);  and  establish  clear \nroles and responsibilities among MOL, MEDS and the PIU  \nIdentify  and  train  staff  involved  in  project  implementation  on  procurement, \nfinancial  management  and  disbursement,  conduct  spot  reviews  of  procurement \nand \nloan  effectiveness,  and  engage  project \nimplementation  start-up  specialist  and  environment  specialist  to  provide  training \non procurement, financial management, disbursement, and environment \n\nfinancial  processes  before \n\nIV.
