THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Bank of Xingtai Green Finance Development Project. \n \n2.  The proposed project will catalyze and demonstrate the use of green finance in Hebei \nprovince, one of the most polluted industrial regions in the PRC. The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) funds will be provided to the Bank of Xingtai, a regional city commercial bank in Hebei,1 to \nfinance subprojects that meet national and international green finance standards.2 The Bank of \nXingtai was chosen because of its established business relationships with polluting industries in \nand around the city of Xingtai, its improving financial and operational performance, and its firm \ncommitment to transform itself into a green bank that focuses on sustainable lending. The project \nwill introduce the latest concepts and international best practices on green, responsible, and \nsustainable financing into the Bank of Xingtai\u2019s operations, including: (i) green finance taxonomies \n(i.e.,  defining  what  is  \u201cgreen\u201d);  (ii)  a  risk  framework  that  covers  environment,  social,  and \ngovernance (ESG) requirements that substantially exceed standard credit risk-based models of \nconventional commercial banks;3 and (iii) ESG public disclosure requirements based on the \nGlobal Reporting Initiative (GRI).4 The Bank of Xingtai will apply these international best practices \nin its financing of subprojects as described in para. 17. In addition, the project will strengthen the \nBank  of  Xingtai\u2019s  institutional  capacities  in  green  finance  policy,  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard systems, financial and risk management, and gender mainstreaming. The project will \nalso serve as a green finance business model for other city and rural commercial banks in the \nPRC to replicate, thereby furthering the government\u2019s efforts to expand green finance in the \ncountry and, ultimately, contribute to better regional and global environmental outcomes. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Environmental challenges on a national scale. The ecological and environmental \ndamage to the PRC from the 1980s of rapid economic development and industrialization is \nenormous. In 2019, the PRC ranked 120th out of 180 countries on 24 environmental sustainability \ncategories, including the state of its air, water, soil, oceans, climate, and biodiversity.5 The \nchallenge is particularly severe in Hebei province, one of the nation\u2019s industrial hubs and the \nlocation of the project. As of 2018, the average annual mean concentration of particulate matter \n2.5 micrometers or less in diameter (PM ) in the air of Hebei province was 60 micrograms per \n2.5\ncubic meter (\u00b5g/m3), six times the World Health Organization acceptable level (10 \u00b5g/m3). Hebei \nprovince\u2019s average annual mean concentration of particulate matter 10 micrometers or less in \ndiameter (PM ) was 109 \u00b5g/m3, more than five times what the World Health Organization \n10\nconsiders  acceptable  (20  \u00b5g/m3).6 Worsening  environmental  conditions  are  making  Hebei \nprovince and many regions of the country less livable. It is the poor who suffer the most, and the \n \n1  The PRC\u2019s banking sector consists mainly of 133 city commercial banks, 1,424 rural commercial banks, 782 rural \ncooperatives, and 1,622 village banks. City commercial banks gain strong local business advantages from operating \nmainly within and around their respective municipalities. \n2  Subprojects are referring to the project facilities to which the Bank of Xingtai intends to lend under the ADB project. \n3  The ESG risk framework helps financial institutions identify and select investments and lending activities based on \ntheir ESG sustainability. \n4  The GRI helps businesses worldwide understand and communicate their impact on critical sustainability issues \nthrough its sustainability reporting standards, which represent global best practice for reporting on economic, \nenvironmental, and social issues. \n5  Yale University. Environmental Performance Index (accessed 13 January 2020). \n6  Ministry of Ecology and Environment of The PRC. 2018. China\u2019s Environmental Report. Beijing. \n ", "2   \nPRC\u2019s total welfare loss because of pollution was estimated at $1.59 billion as of 2013 (or 9.9% \nof gross domestic product), the latest estimate.7 \n \n4.  Need  to  scale  up  green  finance  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China.  These \nenvironmental and social concerns placed green finance at the heart of the PRC\u2019s national \ndevelopment strategy under the 13th Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020.8 Green finance will likely \nfeature more prominently in the 14th Five-Year Plan, 2021\u20132025. The National Development and \nReform Commission (NDRC), the People\u2019s Bank of China (the central bank), the China Banking \nand Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC), and the Ministry of Ecology and Environment \nare the leading agencies for green finance development. Some headway has already been made, \nwith the country\u2019s 21 largest banks (comprising 3 policy banks, 6 state banks, and 12 joint stock \nbanks) increasing their green financing to an annual average of $234 billion during 2013\u20132017.9 \nHowever, based on the estimated total green finance needs of $350 billion per annum, the gap of \nabout $116 billion cannot be filled by these large financial institutions alone.10 Commercial banks \nsuch as the Bank of Xingtai dominate the PRC financial system, which makes expanding their \ngreen finance lending capacity an essential step toward improving the country\u2019s environmental \nconditions.  \n \n5.  Pandemic  impact.  The  outbreak  of  the  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  and  the \nallocation  of  national  resources  to  combat  the  pandemic  in  2020  have  not  changed  the \nGovernment of PRC\u2019s long-term policy priority of pursuing green growth and environmental \nsustainability. The pandemic-related economic slowdown will not affect the robust demand for \ngreen finance over the medium term. Conditions in the PRC are gradually returning to normal, \nand the government\u2019s economic recovery plans are anchored on a less energy-intensive and \nmore  environment-friendly  path.  The  Hebei  Provincial  Government  has  been  successful  in \ncontrolling COVID-19, which has minimized the pandemic\u2019s impact on the Bank of Xingtai\u2019s \nbusiness. As a result, no significant changes to the project are anticipated because of COVID-19. \n \n6.  Need to introduce international best practices. To fulfill their abundant potential to drive \nenvironmentally sustainable growth, commercial banks beyond the largest 21 must become \naccustomed to the new green commercial banking concepts and practices that have taken hold \ninternationally. These include ESG criteria and the GRI sustainability reporting standards. The \ntraditional commercial banking practices that base lending decisions primarily on borrowers\u2019 credit \nqualities are no longer sufficient. Recognizing that ESG issues can impact a business\u2019s long-term \nsustainability, commercial banks across the world are increasingly considering the ESG attributes \nof potential borrowers when assessing risks. For example, when borrowers breach environmental \nrules and regulations, they will face fines, suspensions, or even shutdowns that can undermine \nbanks\u2019 underlying asset quality and profitability. In addition, commercial banks increasingly need \nto disclose their ESG performance for government and public scrutiny. Most city and rural \ncommercial banks in the PRC have limited knowledge of the concepts and practices related to \nESG and the GRI. The PRC\u2019s request for ADB financing to help expand green finance is a \nresponse to this gap.

It will create a \nreplicable model for other commercial banks in the PRC. \n \n7.  Addressing the challenge of determining what is \u201cgreen.\u201d Defining what constitutes \n\u201cgreen\u201d is by applying the green finance taxonomy, which is difficult to do. This is true particularly \nfor city and rural commercial banks with limited experience in green finance. The complexity is \ncompounded in the PRC by the existence of different taxonomies. The three green finance \ntaxonomies currently in use were developed by the NRDC, the People\u2019s Bank of China, and the \nCBIRC, which have overlapping interpretations on how green should be defined. Moreover, these \ndomestic standards are not fully aligned with international standards, particularly in terms of the \nuse of fossil fuel. For example, the European Union (EU) standards exclude fossil fuel-based \ntechnologies, particularly from solid fossil fuels, which the NDRC\u2019s Green Industry Guidance \nCatalogue (2019) still consider to be green.11 Precise definitions of what is truly green can be \nachieved through the use of information technology (IT) that employs big data, cloud computing, \nand sophisticated algorithms to help banks sort through the complex domestic and international \ngreen finance standards. \n \n8.  The battle with pollution in Hebei province. Hebei province is the PRC\u2019s industrial \nheartland for steel, petrochemicals, cement, glass, and leather. As a result, Hebei also is one of \nthe country\u2019s most polluted provinces. The PRC\u2019s 10 most polluted cities include four in Hebei \nprovince: Shijiazhuang (ranked second), Xingtai (third), Handan (fifth), and Baoding (eighth).12 \nThe Hebei Provincial Government is determined to reverse this trend, particularly as an important \nparticipant in the central government\u2019s Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei (BTH) air quality improvement \nprogram (BTH program).13 The provincial government is implementing a 3-year \"blue sky\" action \nplan during 2018\u20132020 to restructure and modernize its industrial base and reduce its pollution \nlevel.14 \n \n9.  Why the Bank of Xingtai? The Bank of Xingtai is committed to become a leading green \nbank. This adds impetus to the province\u2019s efforts to transform its industries and manufacturing \nsectors to address pollution and move onto a sustainable development path. The Bank of Xingtai \nis implementing the national and provincial green finance agendas, and is keen to learn from \ninternational experience. Although headquartered in Xingtai city, the bank\u2019s reach extends across \nthe province through a network of 4 branch offices and 74 subbranches. This provides for a strong \nhome market advantage. The bank is rated satisfactory under the capital adequacy, asset quality, \nmanagement quality, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to market risk (CAMELS) model\u2013the \ninternational standard for financial analysis of commercial banks and involves comprehensive \nevaluations of CAMELS. \n \n10.  Demonstration effects and replication potential. Once the Bank of Xingtai builds up its \nown green finance operations and strengthens its institutional capacity under the project, other \ncity and rural commercial banks will have a reference point for adopting similar green finance \nbusiness models. To help demonstrate the project\u2019s green finance model, the Bank of Xingtai has \n \n11 EU  Technical  Expert  Group  on  Sustainable  Finance.  2019.  Taxonomy  Technical  Report.

These \nactivities will include the preparation of publications and other media products, internal and \nexternal workshops, and other knowledge events and materials on the project\u2019s results, benefits, \nand lessons. Some of these activities will be jointly hosted with ADB, green finance associations, \npublic sector entities, and other financial institutions. City and rural commercial banks account for \n26.2% of the PRC\u2019s banking sector\u2019s overall assets, and 95% of the PRC\u2019s banking institutions \n(excluding rural cooperatives and other smaller financial institutions) by number. Replication of \nthe project\u2019s experience could add to the PRC\u2019s long-term green finance endeavors. \n \n11.  Complementary projects and initiatives. ADB\u2019s $2.0 billion in funding for the BTH \nprogram from 2015 to 2020 has included support for policy and regulatory reform, the expansion \nof clean technologies in small and medium-sized enterprises, the development of advanced clean \ntechnologies, energy-efficient heating and cooling systems development, and coal-to-natural gas \nconversion. A targeted green finance model, to be implemented through the commercial banking \nsector, will complement and add substantial value to the BTH program. The impact of this \nproposed project will be significant, particularly since city and rural commercial banks have not \nyet been exposed to or involved in green finance practices, despite growing interest among their \nindustrial and corporate borrowers who must become part of the pollution reduction solution. In \naddition, ADB\u2019s highly innovative Shandong Green Development Fund Project, approved in 2019, \nprovides an equity investment fund approach to address environmental and climate change \nchallenges.15 Given the project\u2019s focus on equity injections, however, it does not address the \nfinancing requirements of many industries and corporates in the form of bank loans. \n \n12.  Strategic alignment. By promoting industrial transformation and helping reduce pollution \nin Hebei province, the project is aligned with the PRC\u2019s 13th Five-Year Plan (footnote 8); the \nprovincial government\u2019s \u201cblue sky\u201d action plan (footnote 14); and the Xingtai City Master Plan, \n2016\u20132030.16 It supports ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020 to (i) help \ntranslate innovative ideas into actual projects for implementation; (ii) support transformative and \ndemonstration projects, which can be replicated and scaled up; (iii) promote institutional reform \nefforts; and (iv) enable private sector participation.17 It is also aligned with four operational \npriorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030: (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities, (ii) \naccelerating progress in gender equality, (iii)  tackling climate change, building climate and \ndisaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental  sustainability,  and  (iv)  strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity.18 By helping to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas \nemissions, the project will generate regional public goods. \n \nB.

Output 1: The Bank of Xingtai\u2019s green finance system established. The project will \nhelp the Bank of Xingtai (i) adopt domestically  and internationally accepted green finance \ntaxonomy as the basis for subproject eligibility and selection criteria, (ii) establish an ESG \nframework for monitoring subproject performances, and (iii) implement the GRI principles for \nreporting  and  disclosing  subproject  ESG  information  to  the  public.  The  establishment  and \nadoption of the green finance system will be accomplished through (i) the operationalization of a \nsophisticated green finance IT system that will apply domestic and international green finance \ntaxonomies to define what constitutes \u201cgreen\u201d, and (ii) implements the ESG and GRI guidelines. \nThe EU\u2019s sustainable finance taxonomy (footnote 11), which is among the most comprehensive \nanywhere, will be incorporated in the subproject eligibility criteria (para. 17). \n \n15.  Output 2: Green finance lending by the Bank of Xingtai initiated and increased. The \nproject will support the Bank of Xingtai\u2019s establishment of a green finance lending business line \nand help it increase its green lending volume during project implementation and beyond. The ADB \nproject funds will serve as a catalyst for green financing provided by the private sector and other \ncommercial sources.21 Specifically, the ADB loan of \u20ac170 million is expected to leverage \u20ac170 \nmillion in counterpart funding from the Bank of Xingtai and an additional \u20ac340 million from private \nsector and commercial sources such as other commercial banks. Each euro of ADB financing will \nleverage \u20ac3 or more from other sources, and significantly expand the project\u2019s green finance and \ndevelopment impact. \n \n16.  Output 3: The Bank of Xingtai\u2019s environment, social, and governance and related \ninstitutional capacities improved. The project will help the Bank of Xingtai strengthen its \ninstitutional capacity. It will develop an ESG risk management framework. The Bank of Xingtai\u2019s \nenvironmental and social management system (ESMS) will be improved, a dedicated safeguard \nunit established, and environmental and social safeguard training provided for its staff. The project \nwill also support the improvement of the Bank of Xingtai\u2019s financial and risk management capacity \nthrough training to bank staff on credit assessment and treasury operations. This will help \nintegrate the ESG risks to the bank\u2019s credit review process and extend the sourcing of other low-\ncost funds such as from the capital markets. To disseminate the experience of the Bank of Xingtai \nand support replication, extensive knowledge-sharing programs on green finance in general, and \ngreen finance business models for commercial banks in particular, will be conducted with the \nparticipation of other city and rural commercial banks across Hebei and other provinces. The Bank \nof Xingtai will enhance human resource management to expand gender mainstreaming at the \ninstitutional and lending product levels. This will be an important step in the Bank of Xingtai\u2019s \njourney toward becoming a more sustainable and inclusive financial institution. \n \n17.  Subprojects and subproject eligibility criteria. The Bank of Xingtai has been preparing \na subproject pipeline under the ADB project.22 Potential subprojects are in such areas as biomass \npower generation, biofuel production, waste-to-energy investment, plastic replacement (e.g., \nbiodegradable  material  production),  green  buildings,  and  environment-friendly  upgrades  to \nrelevant components of industrial production lines. The ADB funds are likely to contribute to  a \nsmall portion of the total subproject costs, but catalyze additional  market finance. Qualified \n \n20 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n21 Private sector finance refers to commercial bank funding from such sources as private enterprises and individuals in \nthe form of deposits and investments. Commercial finance refers to commercial bank funding from public sector \nsources, such as state-owned enterprises in the form of deposits and investments. \n22 Indicative Subprojects (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6   \nsubprojects will need to meet financial viability and technical soundness criteria, generate net \nenvironmental benefits, and comply with one or more of the prevailing domestic green finance \ntaxonomies: (i) NDRC: Green Industry Guidance Catalogue (2019), (ii) People\u2019s Bank of China: \nGreen Lending Statistical Method (2019), and (iii) CBIRC: Green Finance Statistical Method \n(2013). To align with the international best practices, the qualified subprojects will also comply \nwith the EU\u2019s sustainable finance taxonomy (footnote 11). In addition, no subprojects categorized \nas A under the ESMS for environment, involuntary resettlement, or indigenous people will be \nselected.23 \n \n18.  Market demand and project readiness. The PRC\u2019s annual green financing gap stood at \n$116 billion in 2018. This equated to 33% of the $350 billion of annual demand (para. 4), an \namount that continues to grow given the government\u2019s development priorities. In addition to the \n13th Five-Year Plan, the upcoming 14th Five-Year Plan is expected to place an even greater \nemphasis on green finance. In 2018, the State Council announced a new government policy to \ntransform Hebei province\u2019s pollution-intensive industries and manufacturers by adopting clean \nand environmentally sustainable production alternatives.24 With a widespread presence in the \nprovince, the Bank of Xingtai will be in a strong position to provide a steady flow of green finance \nfor traditional industries and manufacturers that dominate the local economic landscape (footnote \n22). \n \nC.

ADB\u2019s participation will add substantial value to the Bank of Xingtai\u2019s efforts to become a \ngreen finance institution, and to the development of green finance across the PRC. The ADB \nfinancial intermediary loan (FIL) funds are expected to help the Bank of Xingtai catalyze significant \nadditional private sector and commercial finance, especially through loan syndications from other \ncommercial banks. ADB\u2019s capacity building and institutional strengthening support will introduce \nadvanced green finance concepts (i.e. the EU sustainable finance taxonomy) and help align the \nBank of Xingtai\u2019s operations more closely with international best practices for environmental and \nsocial safeguards, effective gender mainstreaming, and financial and risk management. The \ngreen finance IT system will be among the most advanced in the PRC. The planned knowledge-\nsharing activities and showcasing of positive results from the adoption of international best \npractices in green financing are expected to have a transformative impact on the city and rural \ncommercial banking sector in the PRC. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n20.  The project is estimated to cost \u20ac681 million, of which \u20ac170 million will be from ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources,  \u20ac170  million  equivalent  from  the  Bank  of  Xingtai\u2019s  mandatory \ncounterpart financing, and \u20ac340 million equivalent from private sector and commercial financing \n(Table 1). The proportion of ADB financing of the total subproject cost will depend on the \nsubproject financing structure and needs, but in no case will it exceed 40% of the total subproject \ncost. The Bank of Xingtai will provide up to CNY5,600,000 ($800,000 equivalent) for capacity \ndevelopment and CNY1,400,000 ($200,000 equivalent) for procurement and operationalization \nof the green finance IT system (exchange rate based on 13 August 2020).  \n \n23 Assessments indicate that the three national standards are similar, and they are different from the international \nstandards most prominently in terms of some inclusion of the use of fossil fuel. The implementation of the green \nfinance IT system under this project will enable detailed comparison between domestic and international standards. \nFindings based on practical experience will be distilled and disseminated. \n24 Government of the PRC, State Council. 2018.

The capacity development cost is not included in the calculation of the financing shares. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n21.  The Government of the PRC has requested a regular loan of \u20ac170 million ($199 million) \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the project.25 The loan will have a 20-year \nterm, including a grace period of 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of \n0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project \nagreements. Based on the straight-line method, the average maturity is 12.75 years, and there is \nno maturity premium payable to ADB. \n \n22.  The project does not face material climate risks and will support climate change mitigation. \nOf the total project cost of \u20ac680 million, the climate mitigation costs are estimated at \u20ac218 million. \nThe resulting greenhouse gas emission reductions are projected to be 1,861,632 tons of carbon \ndioxide equivalent per annum.26 Of the ADB project financing of \u20ac170 million, the climate \nmitigation costs are estimated at \u20ac54 million, and the estimated greenhouse gas emissions \nreduction will be 465,408 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent a year. While most of the subprojects \nare expected to support climate change mitigation, preference will be given to subprojects with \nclimate adaptation benefits to enrich the project\u2019s overall climate resilience impact. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n23.  The PRC will be the borrower. The Ministry of Finance will relend the ADB funds to the \nHebei Provincial Government, which will relend them to Xingtai City Government, which will then \nrelend them to the Bank of Xingtai, in each case on the same terms and conditions governing the \nADB loan. The Hebei Provincial Government will be the executing agency. The Bank of Xingtai \nwill be the implementing agency and will set up a project management unit, with staffing and \nresources satisfactory to ADB, to manage the day-to-day project implementation. The Bank of \nXingtai will implement the project under its relending agreement with the Xingtai City Government \nand in accordance with the loan agreement, the project agreement, and the project administration \nmanual (PAM).27 A subproject\u2019s qualification as green will be based on the domestic taxonomies \nand international guidelines (para. 17) and on other commercial and technical requirements \noutlined in the PAM. Subproject lending rates will be on commercial terms, determined by the \n \n25 \u20ac0.8564 = $1.00 as of 13 August 2020. \n26 The climate mitigation finance and associated emission reduction estimates are based on a sample of pipeline \nsubprojects. The sample subproject pipeline and calculation methodologies are in Climate Change Assessment and \nIndicative Subprojects (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 The Bank of Xingtai will identify, evaluate, and finance eligible subprojects and undertake the related credit risk \nassessments. Subproject selection will follow the detailed eligibility criteria in the PAM, which are based on economic, \nfinancial, technical, safeguard, and other considerations. Based on the ADB ESMS categorization requirement, \nsafeguard category A subprojects will not be funded.

The Bank of Xingtai will allocate up to CNY7,000,000 from its own funding sources for \ncapacity  development  and  procurement  of  the  green  finance  IT  system.  The  IT  system \nprocurement costs are estimated at CNY1,400,000, and the costs of the consulting services for \ncapacity development are estimated at CNY5,600,000 (para. 20; and Table 1). A capacity \ndevelopment plan will be developed and cover all areas under project output 3 (para. 16). The \ncapacity development activities will be funded and administered by the Bank of Xingtai. Detailed \nimplementation plan and proposed consultant terms of reference are provided in the PAM. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s due diligence for the project consisted of detailed country, macroeconomic, finance \nsector, industry sector, and institutional assessments to check the project\u2019s technical soundness. \nThe ADB team visited several potential subproject sites and assessed subproject potentials for \nADB financing.28 ADB has also conducted integrity due diligence on the Bank of Xingtai, and no \nsignificant or potential integrity risks were identified. The Bank of Xingtai is a competent city \ncommercial bank. However, issues such as lack of an international credit rating, low earnings, \noverreliance on short-term deposits (96% of its funding), localized operations with less diversified \nlending, and lack of experience in international transactions and international best practices (e.g., \non financial management and safeguards) make it suitable for public sector support at this stage. \n \n28 Comprehensive assessments of the Bank of Xingtai\u2019s operational capacities are summarized in the Financial and \nEconomic Analysis and Financial Management Assessment Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n ", "  9 \nThe project\u2019s significant pollution reduction impact, a public good, also justifies public sector \nsupport. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n26.  The project\u2019s economic rationale is based on the need to correct the market failures of \npollution and environmental degradation caused by the negative externalities of industrial and \ncommercial enterprises in Hebei province. Incremental benefits will include expanded supply of \nclean energy, greater use of more energy-efficient resources, and cleaner and more technically \nadvanced production lines to accommodate additional market demand for such products. Non-\nincremental benefits include the replacement of fossil fuels and energy savings from expanded \nuse of more technically advanced and cleaner production methods that provide for net pollution \nreduction. The positive externalities will be reductions in the emission of carbon dioxide, nitrogen \noxides, sulfur oxides, PM  and PM , and other particle pollutants.29 Due diligence on the \n2.5 10\nproject\u2019s financial viability was conducted following the relevant provisions in the ADB financial \nmanagement technical guidance notes: (i) Project Financial Reporting and Auditing (2015), (ii) \nFinancial Due Diligence for Financial Intermediaries (2018), and (iii) Financial Analysis and \nEvaluation (2019). The Bank of Xingtai was assessed for its capacity to expand credit to the target \ngroups (industrial and commercial borrowers), operate on a continuous basis, and comply with \nprudential norms. This was determined based on the financial intermediary\u2019s assessment and \nsatisfactory rating for 2015\u20132019 using the CAMELS model (para. 9). \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n27.  The project, which will help the Bank of Xingtai become a leading green finance bank \nthrough  strengthened  institutional  capacities,  will  enhance the  bank\u2019s  long-term  operational \nsustainability. Improved subproject environmental and social compliance will reduce the bank\u2019s \noverall credit risks. The Bank of Xingtai\u2019s adoption of an ESG framework and international green \nfinance taxonomy will position it among the most innovative and leading green banks in the PRC. \nThis will strengthen the bank\u2019s market standing, which will help it expand its businesses and lower \nits cost of funding. Finally, the Bank of Xingtai\u2019s knowledge sharing and information dissemination \nof its green finance model and institutional development supported by the project will help other \ncity and rural commercial banks scale up green finance development. This will expand national \ngreen finance lending volumes and contribute to environmental sustainability in the PRC and \npossibly other countries in Asia. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n28.  Corporate governance. The Bank of Xingtai is a regulated and licensed city commercial \nbank and has diverse shareholders. Hebei Shunde Investment Group, which is 100% owned by \nthe  Xingtai  City  Government,  is  the  largest  (18.5%).  Other  shareholders  are  mostly  local \ncommercial  enterprises  and  surrounding  municipalities.  The  nine-member  board  has  two \nindependent directors. The five board committees deal with risk management, related party \ntransactions, assets and liabilities management, audit, and IT management. The supervisory \nboard has two external members and two staff supervisory members. The bank complies with the \nnational corporate governance guidelines from the CBIRC\u2019s 162 corporate governance evaluation \ncriteria and 5 classification criteria, including those related to board composition and structure, \ninternal control, and overall risk management. ADB will help the Bank of Xingtai further assess \nand improve its corporate governance practices through such steps as an increase in the ratio of \n \n29 Economic analysis of the subprojects for ADB financing will be carried out during project implementation. \n ", "10   \nindependent  directors,  the  appointment  of  a  chief  risk  officer,  and  the  engagement  of  a \ngovernance advisor. \n \n29.  Financial management. The bank\u2019s financial management is satisfactory in terms of \nplanning, directing, monitoring, organizing, and controlling its financial resources. The systems of \nfinancial  accounting,  assets  management,  credit  management,  liquidity  and  treasury \nmanagement, financial reporting, internal controls, and internal and external audit are adequate \nfor the bank\u2019s business operations. The financial reporting and monitoring follow regulatory \nrequirements and are conducted regularly and on time. The core banking system was upgraded \nin December 2019 to improve financial and risk management efficiency, among other things. On \nthe other hand, the bank operates only in Hebei province and has no national or international \nbusiness. It has not implemented any international development assistance projects. As a result, \nit may face an initial learning curve in project financial management procedures, monitoring, and \nreviews, as well as in audit requirements. The project\u2019s capacity development component will help \naddress this issue and strengthen the bank\u2019s financial management. Both the Xingtai City Finance \nBureau and the Bank of Xingtai will participate in periodically available ADB-wide financial \nmanagement training. Overall, the pre-mitigation financial management and control risks are \nconsidered moderate.30 \n \n30.  Procurement and disbursement. The Bank of Xingtai will ensure (i) that subborrowers \navailing themselves of the ADB FIL proceeds apply appropriate procurement methods to ensure \nvalue for money on the basis of private sector or commercial practices acceptable to ADB, and \n(ii) that the utilization of such loan proceeds shall be subject to the eligibility criteria and the \nintegrity requirements set out in the Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as \namended from time to time). Subproject procurement reviews and assessments will be carried \nout during project implementation to ensure that they are acceptable to ADB. The green finance \nIT system procurement and consulting services will be funded by the Bank of Xingtai and follow \nits institutional procurement guidelines, which are aligned with the PRC Procurement Law and \nrelated local regulations. The recommended project procurement classification is B. The loan \nproceeds will be disbursed following ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed between the government and ADB. A free \nlimit of \u20ac20 million equivalent will be established per subloan. \n \n31.  Anticorruption policy. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and the Bank of Xingtai. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n32.  The project will increase the flow of green finance and improve the environment in Hebei \nprovince, which will also improve health conditions for the residents in Xingtai city and the \nsurrounding areas. The subproject financing will likely create jobs and reduce any remaining \npoverty. The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. A gender assessment found the \nBank of Xingtai to have a good track record in the employment of and promotions for women. \nHowever, its human resources policy and development plan lack explicit references to gender \nequality, and the bank has no previous experience with gender mainstreaming in its lending \noperations. Through an integrated gender action plan, the project will help the bank (i) develop a \ngender-sensitive human resources policy; (ii) create new lending product line(s) targeting women \n \n30 Key financial management risks and their mitigation measures to ensure project financial sustainability are detailed \nin the Financial Management Assessment Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  11 \nentrepreneurs; and (iii) work with existing subborrowers to review their potential for incorporating \ngender-sensitive  components  in  their  operations,  such  as  increasing  their  employment  of \nwomen.31 \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n33.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategory is FI for environment and involuntary resettlement, and FI-C for indigenous peoples. The \nproject\u2019s ESMS will ensure subproject environmental and social safeguard compliance. The FIL \nwill not support environment and involuntary resettlement category A and indigenous peoples \ncategory  A  and  B  subprojects.  The  subproject categorizations  for  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples  will  be  assessed  and  determined  during  project \nimplementation.32 \n \n34.  Environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples (category FI). The \nsubprojects will involve mostly corporate (not project) lending and existing facilities. They will be \nclassified as green by national and international green finance taxonomies and provide net \nemission reduction or net energy saving. The project will be located mostly on special-purpose \ncommercial lands in designated industrial zones. No ethnic minorities are known to be living in or \nnear the industrial sites in Hebei province. ADB has reviewed the Bank of Xingtai\u2019s environmental \nand social safeguard system and practices. Prior to 2019, the bank had no environmental or social \nsafeguard system equivalent to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. It did not have a designated \nenvironmental and social safeguard management unit or any designated environment and/or \nsocial safeguard staff. Through dialogue with ADB and to meet requirements during project \npreparation, the Bank of Xingtai has now established a dedicated safeguard unit with two full-time \nsafeguard staff. The bank\u2019s safeguard capacity development is ongoing and will continue through \nproject implementation. The Bank of Xingtai management has committed to complying with the \nsubproject environmental and social safeguard compliance requirements stated in the ESMS, \nwhich provides a framework for (i) screening ADB-funded subprojects, (ii) ensuring compliance \nwith  national  and  ADB  safeguard  requirements,  and  (iii)  conducting  necessary  safeguard \nmonitoring and reviews. The ESMS has been adopted and will be maintained throughout the term \nof the project. \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n35.

The Asian Development Bank funds will be provided to the Bank of Xingtai, a regional city commercial bank in Hebei, to finance subprojects that meet national and international green finance standards. The Bank of Xingtai was chosen because of its established business relationships with polluting industries in and around the city of Xingtai, its improving financial and operational performance, and its firm commitment to transform itself into a green bank that focuses on sustainable lending. The project will introduce the latest concepts and international best practices on green, responsible, and sustainable financing into the Bank of Xingtai\u2019s operations, including: (i) green finance taxonomies (i.e., defining what is \u201cgreen\u201d); (ii) a risk framework that covers environment, social, and governance (ESG) requirements that substantially exceed standard credit risk-based models of conventional commercial banks;3 and (iii) ESG public disclosure requirements based on the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). The project will strengthen the Bank of Xingtai\u2019s institutional capacities in green finance policy, environmental and social safeguard systems, financial and risk management, and gender mainstreaming. The project will also serve as a green finance business model for other city and rural commercial banks in the PRC to replicate, thereby furthering the government\u2019s efforts to expand green finance in the country and, ultimately, contribute to better regional and global environmental outcomes.", "Title": "Bank of Xingtai Green Finance Development Project: Report and Recommendation of the President"}}
