The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) funds will be provided to the Bank of Xingtai, a regional city commercial bank in Hebei,1 to \nfinance subprojects that meet national and international green finance standards.2 The Bank of \nXingtai was chosen because of its established business relationships with polluting industries in \nand around the city of Xingtai, its improving financial and operational performance, and its firm \ncommitment to transform itself into a green bank that focuses on sustainable lending. The project \nwill  introduce  the  latest  concepts  and  international  best  practices  on  green,  responsible,  and \nsustainable financing into the Bank of Xingtai\u2019s operations, including: (i) green finance taxonomies \n(i.e.,  defining  what  is  \u201cgreen\u201d);  (ii)  a  risk  framework  that  covers  environment,  social,  and \ngovernance (ESG) requirements that substantially exceed standard credit risk-based models of \nconventional  commercial  banks; 3 and  (iii)  ESG  public  disclosure  requirements  based  on  the \nGlobal Reporting Initiative (GRI).4 The Bank of Xingtai will apply these international best practices \nin its financing of subprojects as described in para. 17. In addition, the project will strengthen the \nBank  of  Xingtai\u2019s  institutional  capacities  in  green  finance  policy,  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard systems, financial and risk management, and gender mainstreaming. The project will \nalso serve as a green finance business model for other city and rural commercial banks in the \nPRC  to  replicate,  thereby  furthering  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to  expand  green  finance  in  the \ncountry and, ultimately, contribute to better regional and global environmental outcomes. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nEnvironmental  challenges  on  a  national  scale.  The  ecological  and  environmental \n3. \ndamage  to  the  PRC  from  the  1980s  of  rapid  economic  development  and  industrialization  is \nenormous. In 2019, the PRC ranked 120th out of 180 countries on 24 environmental sustainability \ncategories,  including  the  state  of  its  air,  water,  soil,  oceans,  climate,  and  biodiversity. 5 The \nchallenge  is  particularly  severe  in  Hebei  province,  one  of  the  nation\u2019s  industrial  hubs  and  the \nlocation of the project. As of 2018, the average annual mean concentration of particulate matter \n2.5 micrometers or less in diameter (PM2.5) in the air of Hebei province was 60 micrograms per \ncubic meter (\u00b5g/m3), six times the World Health Organization acceptable level (10 \u00b5g/m3). Hebei \nprovince\u2019s  average  annual  mean  concentration  of  particulate  matter  10  micrometers  or  less  in \ndiameter  (PM10)  was  109  \u00b5g/m3,  more  than  five  times  what  the  World  Health  Organization \nconsiders  acceptable  (20  \u00b5g/m3). 6  Worsening  environmental  conditions  are  making  Hebei \nprovince and many regions of the country less livable. It is the poor who suffer the most, and the \n\n \n\n1  The PRC\u2019s banking sector consists mainly of 133 city commercial banks, 1,424 rural commercial banks, 782 rural \ncooperatives, and 1,622 village banks. City commercial banks gain strong local business advantages from operating \nmainly within and around their respective municipalities. \n\n2  Subprojects are referring to the project facilities to which the Bank of Xingtai intends to lend under the ADB project. \n3  The ESG risk framework helps financial institutions identify and select investments and lending activities based on \n\ntheir ESG sustainability. \n\n4  The  GRI  helps  businesses  worldwide  understand  and  communicate  their  impact  on  critical  sustainability  issues \nthrough  its  sustainability  reporting  standards,  which  represent  global  best  practice  for  reporting  on  economic, \nenvironmental, and social issues. \n\n5  Yale University. Environmental Performance Index (accessed 13 January 2020). \n6  Ministry of Ecology and Environment of The PRC. 2018. China\u2019s Environmental Report. Beijing. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nPRC\u2019s total welfare loss because of pollution was estimated at $1.59 billion as of 2013 (or 9.9% \nof gross domestic product), the latest estimate.7 \n \nNeed  to  scale  up  green  finance  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China.  These \n4. \nenvironmental  and  social  concerns  placed  green  finance  at  the  heart  of  the  PRC\u2019s  national \ndevelopment  strategy  under  the  13th  Five-Year  Plan,  2016\u20132020. 8 Green  finance  will  likely \nfeature more prominently in the 14th Five-Year Plan, 2021\u20132025. The National Development and \nReform Commission (NDRC), the People\u2019s Bank of China (the central bank), the China Banking \nand Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC), and the Ministry of Ecology and Environment \nare the leading agencies for green finance development. Some headway has already been made, \nwith the country\u2019s 21 largest banks (comprising 3 policy banks, 6 state banks, and 12 joint stock \nbanks) increasing their green financing to an annual average of $234 billion during 2013\u20132017.9 \nHowever, based on the estimated total green finance needs of $350 billion per annum, the gap of \nabout $116 billion cannot be filled by these large financial institutions alone.10 Commercial banks \nsuch as the Bank of Xingtai dominate the PRC financial system, which makes expanding their \ngreen finance lending capacity an essential step toward improving the country\u2019s environmental \nconditions.  \n \nPandemic  impact.  The  outbreak  of  the  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  and  the \n5. \nallocation  of  national  resources  to  combat  the  pandemic  in  2020  have  not  changed  the \nGovernment  of  PRC\u2019s  long-term  policy  priority  of  pursuing  green  growth  and  environmental \nsustainability.  The  pandemic-related  economic  slowdown  will  not  affect  the  robust  demand  for \ngreen finance over the medium term. Conditions in the PRC are gradually returning to normal, \nand  the  government\u2019s  economic  recovery  plans  are  anchored  on  a  less  energy-intensive  and \nmore  environment-friendly  path.  The  Hebei  Provincial  Government  has  been  successful  in \ncontrolling  COVID-19,  which  has  minimized  the  pandemic\u2019s  impact  on  the  Bank  of  Xingtai\u2019s \nbusiness. As a result, no significant changes to the project are anticipated because of COVID-19. \n \nNeed to introduce international best practices. To fulfill their abundant potential to drive \n6. \nenvironmentally  sustainable  growth,  commercial  banks  beyond  the  largest  21  must  become \naccustomed to the new green commercial banking concepts and practices that have taken hold \ninternationally.  These include  ESG  criteria  and the  GRI  sustainability  reporting  standards.  The \ntraditional commercial banking practices that base lending decisions primarily on borrowers\u2019 credit \nqualities are no longer sufficient. Recognizing that ESG issues can impact a business\u2019s long-term \nsustainability, commercial banks across the world are increasingly considering the ESG attributes \nof potential borrowers when assessing risks. For example, when borrowers breach environmental \nrules and regulations, they will face fines, suspensions, or even shutdowns that can undermine \nbanks\u2019 underlying asset quality and profitability. In addition, commercial banks increasingly need \nto  disclose  their  ESG  performance  for  government  and  public  scrutiny.  Most  city  and  rural \ncommercial banks in the PRC have limited knowledge of the concepts and practices related to \nESG  and  the  GRI.  The  PRC\u2019s  request  for  ADB  financing  to  help  expand  green  finance  is  a \nresponse to this gap.

It will create a \nreplicable model for other commercial banks in the PRC. \n \nAddressing the challenge of determining what is \u201cgreen.\u201d Defining what constitutes \n7. \n\u201cgreen\u201d is by applying the green finance taxonomy, which is difficult to do. This is true particularly \nfor city and rural commercial banks with limited experience in green finance. The complexity is \ncompounded  in  the  PRC  by  the  existence  of  different  taxonomies.  The  three  green  finance \ntaxonomies currently in use were developed by the NRDC, the People\u2019s Bank of China, and the \nCBIRC, which have overlapping interpretations on how green should be defined. Moreover, these \ndomestic standards are not fully aligned with international standards, particularly in terms of the \nuse  of  fossil  fuel.  For  example,  the  European  Union  (EU)  standards  exclude  fossil  fuel-based \ntechnologies,  particularly  from  solid  fossil  fuels,  which  the  NDRC\u2019s  Green  Industry  Guidance \nCatalogue  (2019)  still  consider  to  be  green.11 Precise  definitions  of  what  is  truly  green  can  be \nachieved through the use of information technology (IT) that employs big data, cloud computing, \nand sophisticated algorithms to help banks sort through the complex domestic and international \ngreen finance standards. \n \nThe  battle  with  pollution  in  Hebei  province.  Hebei  province  is  the  PRC\u2019s  industrial \n8. \nheartland for steel, petrochemicals, cement, glass, and leather. As a result, Hebei also is one of \nthe country\u2019s most polluted provinces. The PRC\u2019s 10 most polluted cities include four in Hebei \nprovince:  Shijiazhuang  (ranked  second),  Xingtai  (third),  Handan  (fifth),  and  Baoding  (eighth).12 \nThe Hebei Provincial Government is determined to reverse this trend, particularly as an important \nparticipant  in  the  central  government\u2019s  Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei  (BTH)  air  quality  improvement \nprogram (BTH program).13 The provincial government is implementing a 3-year \"blue sky\" action \nplan during 2018\u20132020 to restructure and modernize its industrial base and reduce its pollution \nlevel.14 \n \nWhy the Bank of Xingtai? The Bank of Xingtai is committed to become a leading green \n9. \nbank. This adds impetus to the province\u2019s efforts to transform its  industries and manufacturing \nsectors to address pollution and move onto a sustainable development path. The Bank of Xingtai \nis  implementing  the  national  and  provincial  green  finance  agendas,  and  is  keen  to  learn  from \ninternational experience. Although headquartered in Xingtai city, the bank\u2019s reach extends across \nthe province through a network of 4 branch offices and 74 subbranches. This provides for a strong \nhome market advantage. The bank is rated satisfactory under the capital adequacy, asset quality, \nmanagement  quality,  earnings,  liquidity,  and  sensitivity  to  market  risk  (CAMELS)  model\u2013the \ninternational  standard  for  financial  analysis  of  commercial  banks  and  involves  comprehensive \nevaluations of CAMELS. \n \nDemonstration effects and replication potential. Once the Bank of Xingtai builds up its \n10. \nown green finance operations and strengthens its institutional capacity under the project, other \ncity  and  rural  commercial  banks  will  have  a  reference  point  for  adopting  similar  green finance \nbusiness models. To help demonstrate the project\u2019s green finance model, the Bank of Xingtai has \n\n \n\n11 EU  Technical  Expert  Group  on  Sustainable  Finance.  2019.  Taxonomy  Technical  Report.

These \nactivities  will  include  the  preparation  of  publications  and  other  media  products,  internal  and \nexternal workshops, and other knowledge events and materials on the project\u2019s results, benefits, \nand lessons. Some of these activities will be jointly hosted with ADB, green finance associations, \npublic sector entities, and other financial institutions. City and rural commercial banks account for \n26.2% of the PRC\u2019s banking sector\u2019s overall assets, and 95% of the PRC\u2019s banking institutions \n(excluding rural cooperatives and other smaller financial institutions) by number. Replication of \nthe project\u2019s experience could add to the PRC\u2019s long-term green finance endeavors. \n \nComplementary  projects  and  initiatives.  ADB\u2019s  $2.0  billion  in  funding  for  the  BTH \n11. \nprogram from 2015 to 2020 has included support for policy and regulatory reform, the expansion \nof clean technologies in small and medium-sized enterprises, the development of advanced clean \ntechnologies, energy-efficient heating and cooling systems development, and coal-to-natural gas \nconversion. A targeted green finance model, to be implemented through the commercial banking \nsector,  will  complement  and  add  substantial  value  to  the  BTH  program.  The  impact  of  this \nproposed project will be significant, particularly since city and rural commercial banks have not \nyet been exposed to or involved in green finance practices, despite growing interest among their \nindustrial and corporate borrowers who must become part of the pollution reduction solution. In \naddition, ADB\u2019s highly innovative Shandong Green Development Fund Project, approved in 2019, \nprovides  an  equity  investment  fund  approach  to  address  environmental  and  climate  change \nchallenges.15 Given  the  project\u2019s  focus  on  equity  injections,  however,  it  does  not  address  the \nfinancing requirements of many industries and corporates in the form of bank loans. \n \nStrategic alignment. By promoting industrial transformation and helping reduce pollution \n12. \nin  Hebei  province,  the  project  is  aligned  with  the  PRC\u2019s  13th  Five-Year  Plan  (footnote  8);  the \nprovincial  government\u2019s \u201cblue  sky\u201d  action  plan (footnote  14);  and the  Xingtai  City  Master  Plan, \n2016\u20132030.16 It supports ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020 to (i) help \ntranslate innovative ideas into actual projects for implementation; (ii) support transformative and \ndemonstration projects, which can be replicated and scaled up; (iii) promote institutional reform \nefforts;  and  (iv)  enable  private  sector  participation. 17 It  is  also  aligned  with  four  operational \npriorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030: (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities, (ii) \naccelerating  progress  in  gender  equality,  (iii)  tackling  climate  change,  building  climate  and \ndisaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental  sustainability,  and  (iv)  strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity.18 By helping to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas \nemissions, the project will generate regional public goods. \n \nB. \n \n13. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  industrial  transformation  and  green \ndevelopment in Hebei province promoted and environmental conditions improved.19 The project \nwill have the following outcome: volume of green finance provided by the city and rural commercial \n\nProject Description \n\n \n\n15 ADB. 2019.

Future targets beyond 2020 will be identified in the PRC 14th Five-Year Plan, 2021\u20132025, \nwhich is being prepared, at the national level. \n\nManila.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nbanking  sector  in  Hebei  province  increased. 20 This  outcome  will  be  achieved  through  three \noutputs. \n \nOutput 1: The Bank of Xingtai\u2019s green finance system established. The project will \n14. \nhelp  the  Bank  of  Xingtai  (i)  adopt  domestically  and  internationally  accepted  green  finance \ntaxonomy  as  the  basis  for  subproject  eligibility  and  selection  criteria,  (ii)  establish  an  ESG \nframework  for  monitoring  subproject  performances,  and  (iii)  implement  the  GRI  principles  for \nreporting  and  disclosing  subproject  ESG  information  to  the  public.  The  establishment  and \nadoption of the green finance system will be accomplished through (i) the operationalization of a \nsophisticated  green finance  IT  system  that  will  apply  domestic  and international  green finance \ntaxonomies to define what constitutes \u201cgreen\u201d, and (ii) implements the ESG and GRI guidelines. \nThe EU\u2019s sustainable finance taxonomy (footnote 11), which is among the most comprehensive \nanywhere, will be incorporated in the subproject eligibility criteria (para. 17). \n \nOutput 2: Green finance lending by the Bank of Xingtai initiated and increased. The \n15. \nproject will support the Bank of Xingtai\u2019s establishment of a green finance lending business line \nand help it increase its green lending volume during project implementation and beyond. The ADB \nproject funds will serve as a catalyst for green financing provided by the private sector and other \ncommercial  sources.21 Specifically,  the  ADB  loan of  \u20ac170 million  is  expected  to  leverage  \u20ac170 \nmillion in counterpart funding from the Bank of Xingtai and an additional \u20ac340 million from private \nsector and commercial sources such as other commercial banks. Each euro of ADB financing will \nleverage \u20ac3 or more from other sources, and significantly expand the project\u2019s green finance and \ndevelopment impact. \n \nOutput 3: The Bank of Xingtai\u2019s environment, social, and governance and related \n16. \ninstitutional  capacities  improved.  The  project  will  help  the  Bank  of  Xingtai  strengthen  its \ninstitutional capacity. It will develop an ESG risk management framework. The Bank of Xingtai\u2019s \nenvironmental and social management system (ESMS) will be improved, a dedicated safeguard \nunit established, and environmental and social safeguard training provided for its staff. The project \nwill also support the improvement of the Bank of Xingtai\u2019s financial and risk management capacity \nthrough  training  to  bank  staff  on  credit  assessment  and  treasury  operations.  This  will  help \nintegrate the ESG risks to the bank\u2019s credit review process and extend the sourcing of other low-\ncost funds such as from the capital markets. To disseminate the experience of the Bank of Xingtai \nand support replication, extensive knowledge-sharing programs on green finance in general, and \ngreen  finance  business  models  for  commercial  banks  in  particular,  will  be  conducted  with  the \nparticipation of other city and rural commercial banks across Hebei and other provinces. The Bank \nof  Xingtai  will  enhance  human  resource  management  to  expand  gender  mainstreaming  at  the \ninstitutional  and  lending  product  levels.  This  will  be  an  important  step  in  the  Bank  of  Xingtai\u2019s \njourney toward becoming a more sustainable and inclusive financial institution. \n \nSubprojects and subproject eligibility criteria. The Bank of Xingtai has been preparing \n17. \na subproject pipeline under the ADB project.22 Potential subprojects are in such areas as biomass \npower  generation,  biofuel  production,  waste-to-energy  investment,  plastic  replacement  (e.g., \nbiodegradable  material  production),  green  buildings,  and  environment-friendly  upgrades  to \nrelevant components of industrial production lines. The ADB funds are likely to contribute to  a \nsmall  portion  of  the  total  subproject  costs,  but  catalyze  additional    market  finance.  Qualified \n\n \n\n20 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n21 Private sector finance refers to commercial bank funding from such sources as private enterprises and individuals in \nthe  form  of  deposits  and  investments.  Commercial  finance  refers  to  commercial  bank  funding  from  public  sector \nsources, such as state-owned enterprises in the form of deposits and investments. \n22 Indicative Subprojects (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nValue Added by ADB \n\nsubprojects  will  need  to  meet  financial  viability  and  technical  soundness  criteria,  generate  net \nenvironmental benefits, and comply with one or more of the prevailing domestic green finance \ntaxonomies: (i) NDRC: Green Industry Guidance Catalogue (2019), (ii) People\u2019s Bank of China: \nGreen  Lending  Statistical  Method  (2019),  and  (iii)  CBIRC:  Green  Finance  Statistical  Method \n(2013). To align with the international best practices, the qualified subprojects will  also comply \nwith the EU\u2019s sustainable finance taxonomy (footnote 11). In addition, no subprojects categorized \nas  A  under  the  ESMS  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  or  indigenous  people  will  be \nselected.23 \n \n18.  Market demand and project readiness. The PRC\u2019s annual green financing gap stood at \n$116  billion  in  2018.  This  equated  to  33%  of  the  $350  billion  of  annual  demand  (para.  4),  an \namount that continues to grow given the government\u2019s development priorities. In addition to the \n13th  Five-Year  Plan,  the  upcoming  14th  Five-Year  Plan  is  expected  to  place  an  even  greater \nemphasis on green finance. In 2018, the State Council announced a new government policy to \ntransform  Hebei  province\u2019s  pollution-intensive  industries  and  manufacturers  by  adopting  clean \nand  environmentally  sustainable  production  alternatives.24 With  a  widespread  presence  in  the \nprovince, the Bank of Xingtai will be in a strong position to provide a steady flow of green finance \nfor traditional industries and manufacturers that dominate the local economic landscape (footnote \n22). \n \nC. \n \n19. \nADB\u2019s participation will add substantial value to the Bank of Xingtai\u2019s efforts to become a \ngreen  finance  institution,  and  to  the  development  of  green  finance  across  the  PRC.  The  ADB \nfinancial intermediary loan (FIL) funds are expected to help the Bank of Xingtai catalyze significant \nadditional private sector and commercial finance, especially through loan syndications from other \ncommercial banks. ADB\u2019s capacity building and institutional strengthening support will introduce \nadvanced green finance concepts (i.e. the EU sustainable finance taxonomy) and help align the \nBank of Xingtai\u2019s operations more closely with international best practices for environmental and \nsocial  safeguards,  effective  gender  mainstreaming,  and  financial  and  risk  management.  The \ngreen finance IT system will be among the most advanced in the PRC. The planned knowledge-\nsharing  activities  and  showcasing  of  positive  results  from  the  adoption  of  international  best \npractices in green financing are expected to have a transformative impact on the city and rural \ncommercial banking sector in the PRC. \n \nD. \n \n20. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  \u20ac681  million,  of  which  \u20ac170  million  will  be  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources,  \u20ac170  million  equivalent  from  the  Bank  of  Xingtai\u2019s  mandatory \ncounterpart financing, and \u20ac340 million equivalent from private sector and commercial financing \n(Table  1).  The  proportion  of  ADB  financing  of  the  total  subproject  cost  will  depend  on  the \nsubproject financing structure and needs, but in no case will it exceed 40% of the total subproject \ncost.  The  Bank  of  Xingtai  will  provide  up  to  CNY5,600,000  ($800,000  equivalent)  for  capacity \ndevelopment and CNY1,400,000 ($200,000 equivalent) for  procurement and operationalization \nof the green finance IT system (exchange rate based on 13 August 2020).  \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n \n\n23 Assessments  indicate  that  the  three  national  standards  are  similar,  and  they  are  different  from  the  international \nstandards most prominently in terms of some inclusion of the use of fossil fuel. The implementation of the green \nfinance IT system under this project will enable detailed comparison between domestic and international standards. \nFindings based on practical experience will be distilled and disseminated. \n\n24 Government of the PRC, State Council. 2018.

Based on the straight-line method, the average maturity is 12.75 years, and there is \nno maturity premium payable to ADB. \n \n22. \nThe project does not face material climate risks and will support climate change mitigation. \nOf the total project cost of \u20ac680 million, the climate mitigation costs are estimated at \u20ac218 million. \nThe resulting greenhouse gas emission reductions are projected to be 1,861,632 tons of carbon \ndioxide  equivalent  per  annum. 26  Of  the  ADB  project  financing  of  \u20ac170  million,  the  climate \nmitigation  costs  are  estimated  at  \u20ac54  million,  and  the  estimated  greenhouse  gas  emissions \nreduction will be 465,408 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent a year. While most of the subprojects \nare expected to support climate change mitigation, preference will be given to subprojects with \nclimate adaptation benefits to enrich the project\u2019s overall climate resilience impact. \n \nE. \n \n23. \nThe PRC will be the borrower. The Ministry of Finance will relend the ADB funds to the \nHebei Provincial Government, which will relend them to Xingtai City Government, which will then \nrelend them to the Bank of Xingtai, in each case on the same terms and conditions governing the \nADB loan. The Hebei Provincial Government will be the executing agency. The Bank of Xingtai \nwill  be  the  implementing  agency  and  will  set  up  a  project  management  unit,  with  staffing  and \nresources satisfactory  to  ADB,  to manage  the  day-to-day  project  implementation.  The  Bank  of \nXingtai will implement the project under its relending agreement with the Xingtai City Government \nand in accordance with the loan agreement, the project agreement, and the project administration \nmanual (PAM).27 A subproject\u2019s qualification as green will be based on the domestic taxonomies \nand  international  guidelines  (para.  17)  and  on  other  commercial  and  technical  requirements \noutlined in the  PAM.

The  IT  system \nprocurement costs are estimated at CNY1,400,000, and the costs of the consulting services for \ncapacity  development  are  estimated  at  CNY5,600,000  (para.  20;  and  Table  1).  A  capacity \ndevelopment plan will be developed and cover all areas under project output 3 (para. 16). The \ncapacity development activities will be funded and administered by the Bank of Xingtai. Detailed \nimplementation plan and proposed consultant terms of reference are provided in the PAM. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \n25. \nADB\u2019s due diligence for the project consisted of detailed country, macroeconomic, finance \nsector, industry sector, and institutional assessments to check the project\u2019s technical soundness. \nThe ADB team visited several potential subproject sites and assessed subproject potentials for \nADB financing.28 ADB has also conducted integrity due diligence on the Bank of Xingtai, and no \nsignificant  or  potential  integrity  risks  were  identified.  The  Bank  of  Xingtai  is  a  competent  city \ncommercial bank. However, issues such as lack of an international credit rating, low earnings, \noverreliance on short-term deposits (96% of its funding), localized operations with less diversified \nlending, and lack of experience in international transactions and international best practices (e.g., \non financial management and safeguards) make it suitable for public sector support at this stage. \n\n28 Comprehensive assessments of the Bank of Xingtai\u2019s operational capacities are summarized in the  Financial and \nEconomic Analysis and Financial Management Assessment Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nSustainability \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\nThe  project\u2019s  significant  pollution  reduction  impact,  a  public  good,  also  justifies  public  sector \nsupport. \n \nB. \n \n26. \nThe project\u2019s economic rationale is based on the need to correct  the market failures of \npollution  and  environmental  degradation  caused  by  the  negative  externalities  of  industrial  and \ncommercial enterprises in Hebei province. Incremental benefits will include expanded supply of \nclean energy, greater use of more energy-efficient resources, and cleaner and more technically \nadvanced production lines to accommodate additional market demand for such products. Non-\nincremental benefits include the replacement of fossil fuels and energy savings from expanded \nuse of more technically advanced and cleaner production methods that provide for net pollution \nreduction. The positive externalities will be reductions in the emission of carbon dioxide, nitrogen \noxides,  sulfur  oxides,  PM2.5  and  PM10,  and  other  particle  pollutants. 29 Due  diligence  on  the \nproject\u2019s financial viability was conducted following the relevant provisions in the ADB financial \nmanagement  technical  guidance  notes: (i)  Project  Financial  Reporting  and Auditing  (2015), (ii) \nFinancial  Due  Diligence  for  Financial  Intermediaries  (2018),  and  (iii)  Financial  Analysis  and \nEvaluation (2019). The Bank of Xingtai was assessed for its capacity to expand credit to the target \ngroups (industrial and commercial borrowers), operate on a continuous basis, and comply with \nprudential  norms.  This  was  determined  based  on  the  financial  intermediary\u2019s  assessment  and \nsatisfactory rating for 2015\u20132019 using the CAMELS model (para. 9). \n \nC. \n \nThe  project,  which  will  help  the  Bank  of  Xingtai  become  a  leading  green  finance  bank \n27. \nthrough  strengthened  institutional  capacities,  will  enhance  the  bank\u2019s  long-term  operational \nsustainability. Improved subproject environmental and social compliance will reduce the bank\u2019s \noverall credit risks. The Bank of Xingtai\u2019s adoption of an ESG framework and international green \nfinance taxonomy will position it among the most innovative and leading green banks in the PRC. \nThis will strengthen the bank\u2019s market standing, which will help it expand its businesses and lower \nits cost of funding. Finally, the Bank of Xingtai\u2019s knowledge sharing and information dissemination \nof its green finance model and institutional development supported by the project will help other \ncity and rural commercial banks scale up green finance development. This will expand national \ngreen  finance  lending  volumes  and  contribute  to  environmental  sustainability  in  the  PRC  and \npossibly other countries in Asia. \n \nD. \n \nCorporate governance. The Bank of Xingtai is a regulated and licensed city commercial \n28. \nbank and has diverse shareholders. Hebei Shunde Investment Group, which is 100% owned by \nthe  Xingtai  City  Government,  is  the  largest  (18.5%).  Other  shareholders  are  mostly  local \ncommercial  enterprises  and  surrounding  municipalities.  The  nine-member  board  has  two \nindependent  directors.  The  five  board  committees  deal  with  risk  management,  related  party \ntransactions,  assets  and  liabilities  management,  audit,  and  IT  management.  The  supervisory \nboard has two external members and two staff supervisory members. The bank complies with the \nnational corporate governance guidelines from the CBIRC\u2019s 162 corporate governance evaluation \ncriteria and 5 classification criteria,  including those related to board composition and structure, \ninternal control, and overall risk management. ADB will help the Bank of Xingtai further assess \nand improve its corporate governance practices through such steps as an increase in the ratio of \n\nGovernance \n\n29 Economic analysis of the subprojects for ADB financing will be carried out during project implementation. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nliquidity  and \n\nindependent  directors,  the  appointment  of  a  chief  risk  officer,  and  the  engagement  of  a \ngovernance advisor. \n \nFinancial  management.  The  bank\u2019s  financial  management  is  satisfactory  in  terms  of \n29. \nplanning, directing, monitoring, organizing, and controlling its financial resources. The systems of \nfinancial  accounting,  assets  management,  credit  management, \ntreasury \nmanagement, financial reporting, internal controls, and internal and external audit are adequate \nfor  the  bank\u2019s  business  operations.  The  financial  reporting  and  monitoring  follow  regulatory \nrequirements and are conducted regularly and on time. The core banking system was upgraded \nin December 2019 to improve financial and risk management efficiency, among other things. On \nthe  other  hand, the  bank  operates only  in  Hebei  province  and  has  no  national  or  international \nbusiness. It has not implemented any international development assistance projects. As a result, \nit may face an initial learning curve in project financial management procedures, monitoring, and \nreviews, as well as in audit requirements. The project\u2019s capacity development component will help \naddress this issue and strengthen the bank\u2019s financial management. Both the Xingtai City Finance \nBureau  and  the  Bank  of  Xingtai  will  participate  in  periodically  available  ADB-wide  financial \nmanagement  training.  Overall,  the  pre-mitigation  financial  management  and  control  risks  are \nconsidered moderate.30 \n \nProcurement and disbursement. The Bank of Xingtai will ensure (i) that subborrowers \n30. \navailing themselves of the ADB FIL proceeds apply appropriate procurement methods to ensure \nvalue for money on the basis of private sector or commercial practices acceptable to ADB, and \n(ii)  that  the  utilization  of  such  loan  proceeds  shall  be  subject  to  the  eligibility  criteria  and  the \nintegrity  requirements  set  out  in  the  Procurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers  (2017,  as \namended from time to time). Subproject procurement reviews and assessments will be carried \nout during project implementation to ensure that they are acceptable to ADB. The green finance \nIT system procurement and consulting services will be funded by the Bank of Xingtai and follow \nits institutional procurement guidelines, which are aligned with the PRC Procurement Law and \nrelated  local  regulations.  The  recommended  project  procurement  classification  is  B.  The  loan \nproceeds will be disbursed following ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed between the government and ADB. A free \nlimit of \u20ac20 million equivalent will be established per subloan. \n \nAnticorruption  policy.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \n31. \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  the  Bank  of  Xingtai.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nE. \n \n32. \nThe project will increase the flow of green finance and improve the environment in Hebei \nprovince,  which  will  also  improve  health  conditions  for  the  residents  in  Xingtai  city  and  the \nsurrounding  areas.  The  subproject  financing  will  likely  create  jobs  and  reduce  any  remaining \npoverty. The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. A gender assessment found the \nBank of Xingtai to have a good track record in the employment of and promotions for women. \nHowever,  its  human resources policy  and  development  plan  lack explicit  references to  gender \nequality,  and  the  bank  has  no  previous  experience  with  gender  mainstreaming  in  its  lending \noperations. Through an integrated gender action plan, the project will help the bank (i) develop a \ngender-sensitive human resources policy; (ii) create new lending product line(s) targeting women \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n30 Key financial management risks and their mitigation measures to ensure project financial sustainability are detailed \n\nin the Financial Management Assessment Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\nSafeguards \n\nentrepreneurs; and (iii) work with existing subborrowers to review their potential for incorporating \ngender-sensitive  components  in  their  operations,  such  as  increasing  their  employment  of \nwomen.31 \n \nF. \n \n33. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \ncategory is FI for environment and involuntary resettlement, and FI-C for indigenous peoples. The \nproject\u2019s ESMS will ensure subproject environmental and social safeguard compliance. The FIL \nwill  not  support  environment  and  involuntary  resettlement  category  A  and  indigenous  peoples \ncategory  A  and  B  subprojects.  The  subproject  categorizations  for  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples  will  be  assessed  and  determined  during  project \nimplementation.32 \n \nEnvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples (category FI). The \n34. \nsubprojects will involve mostly corporate (not project) lending and existing facilities. They will be \nclassified  as  green  by  national  and  international  green  finance  taxonomies  and  provide  net \nemission reduction or net energy saving. The project will be located mostly on special-purpose \ncommercial lands in designated industrial zones. No ethnic minorities are known to be living in or \nnear the industrial sites in Hebei province. ADB has reviewed the Bank of Xingtai\u2019s environmental \nand social safeguard system and practices. Prior to 2019, the bank had no environmental or social \nsafeguard system equivalent to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. It did not have a designated \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguard  management  unit  or  any  designated  environment  and/or \nsocial  safeguard  staff.  Through  dialogue  with  ADB  and  to  meet  requirements  during  project \npreparation, the Bank of Xingtai has now established a dedicated safeguard unit with two full-time \nsafeguard staff. The bank\u2019s safeguard capacity development is ongoing and will continue through \nproject implementation. The Bank of Xingtai management has committed to complying with the \nsubproject  environmental  and  social  safeguard  compliance  requirements  stated  in  the  ESMS, \nwhich provides a framework for (i) screening ADB-funded subprojects, (ii) ensuring compliance \nwith  national  and  ADB  safeguard  requirements,  and  (iii)  conducting  necessary  safeguard \nmonitoring and reviews.

Hebei province is an industrial hub of the PRC and its economic \nfoundation is strong enough to weather the macroeconomic risks. \nThrough engagement with ADB in developing the project, the Bank of Xingtai \n\nRisk \nThe banking sector is negatively \naffected by unforeseen economic \nslowdowns from shocks. \n\nThe Bank of Xingtai\u2019s limited \n\n \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n31 Gender  indicators  are  included  in  Appendix  1  and  the  Gender  Action  Plan  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\n32 ADB\u2019s  prohibited  investment  activities  list  will  be  applied  in  Environmental  and  Social  Management  System \n\n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n33 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nRisk \ninstitutional experience leads to \nsubproject safeguard reviews \nthat do not meet the ESMS and \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009) guidelines. \nBecause the Bank of Xingtai \ndoes not hedge its euro \nborrowing from ADB, and the \neuro interest rate and euro\u2013yuan \nexchange rate is prone to drastic \nchanges, the bank may face \nforeign exchange losses. \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nhas established a dedicated safeguard unit and assigned two full-time \nsafeguard staff. The project\u2019s capacity development component will help \nfurther strengthen the bank institutionally, particularly in relation to the ESMS. \nRepeated training has also been carried out during loan processing. \n\nThe bank will strengthen its risk and foreign exchange management capacity. \nADB\u2019s proposed loan of \u20ac170 million (CNY1,382 million) accounted for 1.5% \nof the bank\u2019s total balance sheet of CNY92,744 million (\u20ac753,925 million), and \n2.9% of the total loan book of CNY47,661 million (\u20ac387,441 million) as of 13 \nAugust 2020. The risk is manageable. In addition, during loan negotiations, \nADB has clarified with the borrower that the local currency conversion option \nwill be available during the loan repayment period.a \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, ESMS = environmental and social management \nsystem, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \na  ADB. 2008.
