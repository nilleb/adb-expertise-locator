The report also describes \nthe proposed administration of a loan of up to $20,000,000 to be provided by the Leading Asia\u2019s \nPrivate Infrastructure Fund1 (LEAP), and if the Board approves the proposed loans and partial \nrisk  guarantee,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  approve  the \nadministration of the loan.   \n  \nThe  proposed  loans  and  PRG  will  support  the  construction  of  a  275-megawatt  (MW) \n2. \ncombined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plant and ancillary infrastructure in Riau province in \ncentral Sumatra. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) invited and is working together with the \nInternational Finance Corporation (IFC) on its first joint project in Indonesia. Furthermore, ADB \nwill also be providing its PRG product to commercial banks for the first time in Indonesia thereby \nsignificantly  increasing  our  cofinancing  relationships.  This  plant  will  contribute  to  the \ndiversification  of  energy  sources  in  the  country  and  will  also  provide  an  affordable  power \ngeneration source that could increase the penetration capacity of renewable energy sources in \nthe Sumatra grid.     \n  \n \n  \nA.  \n  \n \n  \n3. \nIndonesia is the largest economy in Southeast Asia, with gross domestic product of about \n$1,015.4 billion (current United States dollars) in 2017.2 Economic growth averaged 5.0% during  \n2015\u20132017, but stronger growth is needed to drive poverty down and reverse high inequality.3  \nGrowth  remains  below  potential  because  of  structural  impediments  such  as  deficient  energy \ninfrastructure.  ADB  estimates  Indonesia\u2019s  infrastructure  investment  needs  at  $1.1  trillion  for \n2016\u2013 2030, or $1.3 trillion if climate adaptation measures are included.4 Accelerating investment \nin affordable and sustainable energy is critical for achieving the country\u2019s economic and social \ndevelopment goals.  \n  \n4. \nThe  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mineral  Resources  (MEMR)  anticipates  power  demand  to \nexceed current forecasts, resulting in a shortage that could undermine the country\u2019s sustainable \ngrowth potential if not addressed adequately. Every year, the MEMR issues a rolling 10-year plan \nprepared by Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), the national electric utility, to prioritize new power  \n\nProject Identification and Description  \n\nProject Identification  \n\nTHE PROJECT  \n\n1.  \n\nII.  \n\n                                                           \n\n1  Financing partner: Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).  \n2  International Monetary Fund. 2018.

The National Electricity Business Plan (RUPTL), 2018\u201320275 indicates that, during \nthis period, 56 gigawatts will be added to PLN\u2019s network.6   \n  \n5. \nSupporting sustainable growth. The use of combined-cycle gas-fired power generation \ncan improve the environmental sustainability of the current energy mix by displacing diesel and \ncoal as fuels for electricity generation.7 Gas engines and turbines can respond more quickly than \ncoal and diesel units and, therefore, are better suited to responding rapidly to load fluctuations. \nThis, in turn, can enable greater use of intermittent renewable energy sources, such as wind and \nsolar. The increased usage of natural gas will therefore help the government to reach the target \nof 23% power generation from renewable energy sources.   \n  \nIncreasing  power  affordability.  PLN  awarded  the  project  to  the  sponsors  through  a \n6. \ncompetitive bidding process. The project will contribute to lowering the average power generation \ncost in Sumatra. The MEMR issued new regulations in January 2017 to set energy tariffs against \nthe local and national grid cost of power generation.8 The cost of power generation is issued by \nthe MEMR every year. The project\u2019s tariff is well below the cost of power generation in the area,9 \ndelivering savings to PLN and ultimately to its energy users.    \n  \n \n  \n7. \nThe  project  entails  the  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  a  275-MW  CCGT \npower plant with all supporting facilities and necessary equipment (including a gas pipeline of \napproximately 40 kilometers (km) that connects to the existing gas pipeline network, 150-kilo-volt \n(kV)  transmission  lines  of  approximately  0.75  km,  and  150-kV  substation  and  switchyard \ninfrastructure).  It  will  connect  to  the  Tenayan  150-kV  sub-station  in  Pekanbaru  city  in  Riau \nprovince in central Sumatra. The project will be implemented under a 20-year power purchase \nagreement (PPA) with PLN. PLN will supply natural gas to the project, and the project will operate \nas a load-following10 power plant.  \n  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]  \n  \n \n  \n8. \nThe  project  will  be  implemented  through  a  special  purpose  vehicle,  PT.  Medco  Ratch \nPower  Riau,  which  is  the  borrower.  It  will  be  51%  owned  by  PT.

Jakarta.  \n6  In the RUPTL, 2018\u20132027, power demand was revised downward from 2015\u20132017 levels because economic growth \nwas lower than expected. However, the planned additional new power capacity by 2027 is still 56 gigawatts, which \nis larger than existing installed capacity in 2017.   \n\n7  A combined-cycle power plant uses both a gas and a steam turbine. The waste heat from the gas turbine is routed \nto the nearby steam turbine, which generates extra power. Combined-cycle plants are more efficient than traditional \nsimple-cycle plants.  \n\n8  Sector Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n9  The 2017 cost of power generation published in April 2018 shows an average cost of generation of $0.1098 per \n\nkilowatt-hour in Riau and the Riau archipelago. [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]  \n\n10 The project plant will adjust its power output as demand for electricity fluctuates throughout the day. Based on the \n\ndispatch profile, the anticipated annual capacity factor is 60%.  \n\n\f3  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nin  Indonesia,  and  49%  by  Ratchaburi  Electricity  Generating  Holding  Public  Company  Limited \n(Ratch), Thailand's largest IPP (rated BBB+ by Standard and Poor\u2019s and Baa1 by Moody\u2019s).11  \n   \nIntegrity  due  diligence,  and  enhanced  tax  integrity  due  diligence  were  conducted  and  shared \nconcerns were discussed together with IFC.12   \n  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]  \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs  \n\nB.  \n  \n9. \nImpacts. The project will have the following impact: implemented national energy policy \nwhich aims to re-establish Indonesia\u2019s energy independence by using domestic gas for power \ngeneration, and improved reliability of power supply in the Sumatra grid.13   \n  \n10.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: increased delivery of stable and \nreliable  power  to  the  domestic  grid  through  CCGT  power  generation  of  1,445  gigawatt-hour \nannually.14  \n  \n11.  Outputs.  The  project  will  have  the  following  outputs:  (i)  successful  completion  of  a \n275MW  CCGT  power  plant  and  ancillary  infrastructure,  operated  by  the  private  sector;  (ii) \ngeneration of local employment opportunities during the construction phase; (iii) stimulation of \nlocal and national economy; and (iv) implementation of measures to promote gender equality \nand women\u2019s empowerment.  \n  \nC.  \n  \n12.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. Following ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, \nthe project meets this operational priority: tackling climate change, building climate and disaster \nresilience,  and  enhancing  environmental  sustainability. 15  Also,  the  project  supports  private \nsector  participation  in  infrastructure  to  fill  the  infrastructure  gap  and  catalyze  and  mobilize \nfinancial resources for development.16 The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy  for  Indonesia,  2016\u20132019  in  supporting  the  expansion  of  infrastructure  and \nenvironmentally  friendly  technologies  for  energy  generation. 17  It  also  contributes  to  the \nobjectives of Indonesia\u2019s National Energy Plan (footnote 13).  \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n                                                           \n11 Client Information (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n12 ADB. 2003.

Consistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy,  which  supports  natural  gas-based  power  plants  and \nefficient technologies such as combined-cycle. 18 The energy policy also supports public-private \npartnership models that enable the participation of the private sector to help achieve efficiencies \nand reduce reliance on public sector funds. Further, the project complements ADB\u2019s assistance \nto  the  MEMR  and  PLN  through  its  results-based  and  policy-based  lending,  which  includes \nsupport to PLN for grid capacity improvement in Sumatra.19   \n  \n14. \nLessons  from  previous  operations.  The  project  will  benefit  from  ADB\u2019s  exposure  to \nIndonesia\u2019s  energy  sector  and  experience  gained  from  structuring  and  implementing  energy \nprojects  in Indonesia.20 Most  of the  private sector power  projects  that  have been financed  by \nADB to date are still under construction but are generally on track. ADB\u2019s experience indicates \nthat  successful  project  implementation  depends  on  the  sponsors\u2019  strength,  experience,  and \nability to understand the regulatory environment, as well as the terms and conditions governing \nthe financing of such projects.  \n  \nD.  \n  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]  \n  \nE.  \n  \n15.  \n  \n\nTable 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements.21  \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan  \n\nImplementation Arrangements  \n\nTable 3: Summary of Implementation Arrangements  \n\nAspects  \nRegulatory framework  \n\nManagement  \n\nImplementation period  \nConstruction arrangements  \n Type of arrangement  \n\n Contractor  \n\nOperations arrangements  \n\n                                                           \n\nArrangements  \nPT.

ADB\u2019s assistance consists of (i) a proposed A loan of up to $70.0 million,22 (ii) a proposed \nB loan of up to $82.0 million, (iii) a proposed PRG for the B loan covering up to $77.9 million of \nprincipal  plus  interest  and  guarantee  fees,23 and  (iv)  a  proposed  parallel  loan  of  up  to  $20.0 \nmillion, to be provided by LEAP and administered by ADB (footnote 1).  \n  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]  \n  \n17.  ADB\u2019s PRG will cover up to 95% of the B loan for the commercial banks, mitigating losses \ncaused by the following perils:   \n\nbreach of PPA: an arbitral award default and denial of recourse;  \nexpropriation: actions by the host government which deprive the project of rights \nor assets or interferes with the ownership control of such assets or of the borrower;    \nwar and civil disturbance: acts of war, revolution, and insurrection; and   \ntransfer  restrictions  or  inability  to transfer:  events,  including  actions  by  the  host \ngovernment that prevent or restrict conversion and transfer of currency.   \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n  \n\n                                                           \n\n22 ADB\u2019s direct A loan will rank pari pasu with the B loan to be funded by commercial banks, sharing a pooled security \npackage over project assets. A portion of the risk on ADB\u2019s direct loan and PRG may be transferred to counterparties \neligible under applicable policies, in which case the investment committee will endorse the terms of the risk transfer \narrangement.  \n\n23 ADB\u2019s maximum aggregate liability under this PRG will be up to $150,000,000.   \n\n\f  \n\n6 \n \n\n \nB.  \n  \n18.  \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance  \n\n(ii) \n\nADB\u2019s participation in the project will add substantial value in the following ways:  \n(i) \n\nADB  has  played  a  lead  role  in  structuring  the  project  by  ensuring  fair  risk \nallocation under various project documents and the financing structure.   \nSecuring  long-term  commercial  bank  financing  necessary  for  any  large-scale \ninfrastructure  investments  remains  a  challenge  in  Indonesia.  ADB\u2019s  role  as  a \nlender and provider of PRG cover for the B loan will enable the project to mobilize \na significant amount of long-term debt.   \nADB is playing a lead role in ensuring the implementation of environmental and \nsocial safeguards of international standards.   \n\n(iii) \n\n  \nRisks  \n\nC.  \n  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]  \n  \n\n \n\nIV.  \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE  \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions  \n\n  \nA.  \n  \n19. \nADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009) as follows: environment category A, involuntary resettlement category B, and \nindigenous peoples category C.24 ADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the potential \nenvironmental and social impacts of the project and the measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, \nand  compensate  for  the  adverse  impacts  in  the  safeguard  reports  and  plans.  To  meet  ADB \nrequirements  for  an  environment  category  A  project,  a  draft  environmental  and  social  impact \nassessment  (ESIA)  was  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website  on  18  May  2018. 25  This  includes  an \nenvironmental  and  social  management  plan  and  a  framework  environmental  and  social \nmanagement system to manage and monitor impacts during pre-construction, construction and \noperation. The environmental and social measures and the institutional capacity and commitment \nof the borrower to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed adequate.  \n  \nEnvironment.  The  CCGT  site  is  on  an  oil  palm  plantation  and  is  surrounded  by  the \n20. \nplantation to the south, west, and east, and road 45 to the north. Ancillary infrastructure includes \na 150-kV switchyard on site, 0.75 km long 150-kV power line with eight new pylons, a 40-km gas \npipeline connecting to the main gas network, 3 km of water intake and discharge pipelines to the \nSiak river, and a temporary jetty for the transport of heavy equipment. The temporary jetty, water \nintake and outlet are located adjacent to the existing Tenayan coal-fired power plant. Pekanbaru \ncity is approximately 3 km to the west and the closest residence is 0.45 km to the south-east. \nThere  are  residential  properties,  a  school  and  a  mosque  near  the  gas  pipeline,  which  follows \nexisting roads.  \n  \n21. \nThe project area is modified habitat with 0.24 hectares of degraded natural habitat. The \ncritically endangered Sunda pangolin (Manis javanica) and endangered agile gibbon (Hylobates \n\n                                                           \n\n24 ADB. Safeguard Categories.  \n25 https://www.adb.org/projects/50182-001/main.   \n\n\f7  \n\n  \n\nagilis) occur in or near the project area. Sunda pangolin can occupy modified habitat including an \noil palm plantation but are threatened by hunting and poaching. Agile gibbon occurs in intact and \ndegraded forest and forest edges. Due to actual or potential impacts on natural and critical habitat \nthe project has developed a Biodiversity Action Plan. This includes a no tolerance policy towards \npoaching by workers, education programs for the community, and conservation initiatives.   \n  \n22. \nThe main air pollutant of potential concern from a CCGT is nitrogen dioxide. Baseline air \nquality  monitoring  showed  that  the  airshed  is  non-degraded  for  nitrogen  dioxide.  During \noperation,  air  dispersion  modeling  shows  that  maximum  ground  level  nitrogen  dioxide \nconcentrations, accounting for maximum potential cumulative emissions from the Tenayan coal-\nfired  power  plant,  comply  with  Indonesian  air  quality  standards  and  the  World  Bank \nEnvironmental  Health  and  Safety  Guidelines.  In  addition,  nitrogen  dioxide  emissions  from  the \npower  plant  only  are  well  within the World Bank 25% threshold  to  allow  for future  sustainable \ndevelopment.26   \n  \nThe plant will source water from the Siak river at a rate of less than 0.5% of minimum daily \n23. \nflows.  Wastewater  will  be  treated  on  site  before  discharge  to  the  river  in  compliance  with \nIndonesian and World Bank Group standards.27 Cooling water does not result in elevated water \ntemperatures and no cumulative impacts are caused by the existing power plant. Impacts on river \necology have been assessed as minor and a fisherfolk survey has also been conducted.  \n  \n24. \nDuring  construction,  the  sponsor  is  to  implement  measures  to  minimize  disturbance  to \nresidents. This includes a staged approach for gas pipeline installation in 500 meters (m) lengths \nover a two-week period. Stakeholder consultation was undertaken during the local environmental \napproval  process  and  during  the  preparation  of  the  ESIA.  This  has  included  disclosure of  the \nESIA and feedback from the community, with additional meetings to be held in November 2018. \nA community grievance redress mechanism was developed and socialized.  \n  \n25. \nInvoluntary resettlement. The project will not cause involuntary physical displacement \nbut  will  produce  some  temporary  involuntary  economic  displacement  and  restriction  impacts \nthrough pipeline construction. The power plant and switchyard will be constructed on privately \nowned land. Purchase of this land by the borrower was on a voluntary willing-seller willing-buyer \nbasis on commercial terms at market value. Land required for the pumphouse and water intake \narea  will  be  leased  from  the  government.  Water  intake  and  discharge  pipelines  are  on \ngovernment land and will be laid along existing corridors with easement rights. Land on the bank \nof the Siak river required during construction for a temporary jetty is unoccupied but its use for \nthe project may restrict the access of river users during the 8month construction period. The route \nof the 40-km buried gas supply pipeline has been designed to minimize displacement impacts \nand will be built within an existing road right-of-way and on state-owned and privately-owned oil \npalm plantations.  \n \n26. \nA  plan  to  manage  all  temporary  project-related  involuntary  economic  displacement \nimpacts through compensation and livelihood restoration measures has been developed by the \nborrower. It is not expected that any involuntary physical displacement will occur because there \nare no dwellings located at the power plant site or within the transmission tower alignment and \n                                                           \n\n26 IFC. 2008.

World Bank Group, Washington, DC.  \n\n\f8 \n \n\n  \n\nthe gas and water pipelines will predominantly run along the road reserve or within easements \nwhich will be agreed with the affected landowners. The borrower is directly responsible for the \nimplementation of the compensation and livelihood restoration measures.    \n  \nIndigenous peoples. No distinct and vulnerable indigenous peoples or ethnic minority \n27. \ngroups as defined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) are identified as present in the \nproject\u2019s  area  of  influence.  The  project  impact  assessment  identifies  presence  of  ethnic \nsubgroups of the Malay (Melayu) majority, which is one of Indonesia\u2019s larger ethnic groups.  \n  \n28. \nSome  gender  elements.  In  addition  to  measures  required  under  national  law  and \nsafeguards  requirements,  at  ADB\u2019s  request  and  guidance,  PT.  Medco  Ratch  Power  Riau  has \ncommitted to implement measures to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment in its \nproject  business  activities following  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and  Development  (2003).  These \nmeasures are: (i) women\u2019s health training events programmed in collaboration with community \nhealth centers; (ii)  early  childhood education  and development  training  events  focused on the \nneeds  of  girls,  programmed  in  collaboration  with  community  groups;  and  (iii)  financial  literacy \ntraining events for households and enterprises focused on the needs of women, programmed in \ncollaboration  with  community  groups.  The  borrower  will  submit  periodic  reports  on \nimplementation of gender measures to ADB as part of its environmental and social monitoring \nreports.  \n  \nOther social aspects. PT. Medco Ratch Power Riau will comply with national labor laws \n29. \nand,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy  (2001),  will  take  measures  to  comply  with \ninternationally recognized core labor standards. The client will report regularly to ADB on (i) its \ncompliance with such laws and that of its contractors, and (ii) the measures taken. Information \ndisclosure and consultation with affected people will follow ADB requirements.28  \n  \nB.  \n  \n30. \nPT.  Medco  Ratch  Power  Riau  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  of  implementing  best \ninternational  practice  relating to  combating corruption, money  laundering,  and the financing  of \nterrorism.  ADB  will  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions \nprohibiting corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB \nin the event of noncompliance.  \n  \nC.  \n  \n31. \nsingle exposure limits for non-sovereign investments.  \n  \nD.  \n  \nConsistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),29 \n32. \nADB  will  proceed  with  the  proposed  assistance  upon  establishing  that  the  Government  of \n\nThe proposed loans and PRG are within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and \n\nInvestment Limitations  \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\nAssurances  \n\n                                                           \n\n28 Summary  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social  Strategy;  and  Safeguards  and  Social  Dimensions  Summary  (accessible \n\nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n29 ADB. 1966.
