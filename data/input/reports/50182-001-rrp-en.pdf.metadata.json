THE PROPOSAL  \n  \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed A \nloan of up to $70,000,000; (ii) a proposed B loan of up to $82,000,000; and (iii) a proposed partial \nrisk guarantee (PRG) for the B loan covering up to $77,900,000 of principal plus interest and \nguarantee fees for the Riau Natural Gas Power Project in Indonesia. The report also describes \nthe proposed administration of a loan of up to $20,000,000 to be provided by the Leading Asia\u2019s \nPrivate Infrastructure Fund1 (LEAP), and if the Board approves the proposed loans and partial \nrisk  guarantee,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  approve  the \nadministration of the loan.   \n  \n2.  The proposed loans and PRG will support the construction of a 275-megawatt (MW) \ncombined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plant and ancillary infrastructure in Riau province in \ncentral Sumatra. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) invited and is working together with the \nInternational Finance Corporation (IFC) on its first joint project in Indonesia. Furthermore, ADB \nwill also be providing its PRG product to commercial banks for the first time in Indonesia thereby \nsignificantly  increasing  our  cofinancing  relationships.  This  plant  will  contribute  to  the \ndiversification of energy sources in the country and will also provide an affordable power \ngeneration source that could increase the penetration capacity of renewable energy sources in \nthe Sumatra grid.     \n  \n  II.   THE PROJECT  \n  \nA.   Project Identification and Description  \n  \n  1.   Project Identification  \n  \n3.  Indonesia is the largest economy in Southeast Asia, with gross domestic product of about \n$1,015.4 billion (current United States dollars) in 2017.2 Economic growth averaged 5.0% during  \n2015\u20132017, but stronger growth is needed to drive poverty down and reverse high inequality.3  \nGrowth remains below potential because of structural impediments such as deficient energy \ninfrastructure. ADB estimates Indonesia\u2019s infrastructure investment needs at $1.1 trillion for \n2016\u2013 2030, or $1.3 trillion if climate adaptation measures are included.4 Accelerating investment \nin affordable and sustainable energy is critical for achieving the country\u2019s economic and social \ndevelopment goals.  \n  \n4.  The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR) anticipates power demand to \nexceed current forecasts, resulting in a shortage that could undermine the country\u2019s sustainable \ngrowth potential if not addressed adequately. Every year, the MEMR issues a rolling 10-year plan \nprepared by Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), the national electric utility, to prioritize new power  \n                                                           \n1  Financing partner: Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).  \n2  International Monetary Fund. 2018. World Economic Outlook (WEO). Washington, DC.  \n3  The proportion of people living in poverty has declined by more than half, from 24% in 1999 to 10.1% in 2017, but    \nremains high for a lower middle-income country.  \n4  ADB. 2017. Meeting Asia's Infrastructure Needs. Manila.  \n ", "2    \n \ninvestments. The National Electricity Business Plan (RUPTL), 2018\u201320275 indicates that, during \nthis period, 56 gigawatts will be added to PLN\u2019s network.6   \n  \n5.  Supporting sustainable growth. The use of combined-cycle gas-fired power generation \ncan improve the environmental sustainability of the current energy mix by displacing diesel and \ncoal as fuels for electricity generation.7 Gas engines and turbines can respond more quickly than \ncoal and diesel units and, therefore, are better suited to responding rapidly to load fluctuations. \nThis, in turn, can enable greater use of intermittent renewable energy sources, such as wind and \nsolar. The increased usage of natural gas will therefore help the government to reach the target \nof 23% power generation from renewable energy sources.   \n  \n6.  Increasing power affordability. PLN awarded the project to the sponsors through a \ncompetitive bidding process. The project will contribute to lowering the average power generation \ncost in Sumatra. The MEMR issued new regulations in January 2017 to set energy tariffs against \nthe local and national grid cost of power generation.8 The cost of power generation is issued by \nthe MEMR every year. The project\u2019s tariff is well below the cost of power generation in the area,9 \ndelivering savings to PLN and ultimately to its energy users.    \n  \n  2.   Project Design  \n  \n7.  The project entails the construction, operation, and maintenance of a 275-MW CCGT \npower plant with all supporting facilities and necessary equipment (including a gas pipeline of \napproximately 40 kilometers (km) that connects to the existing gas pipeline network, 150-kilo-volt \n(kV)  transmission  lines  of  approximately  0.75  km,  and  150-kV  substation  and  switchyard \ninfrastructure). It will connect to the Tenayan 150-kV sub-station in Pekanbaru city in Riau \nprovince in central Sumatra. The project will be implemented under a 20-year power purchase \nagreement (PPA) with PLN. PLN will supply natural gas to the project, and the project will operate \nas a load-following10 power plant.  \n  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]  \n  \n  3.   Borrower and Sponsors  \n  \n8.  The project will be implemented through a special purpose vehicle, PT. Medco Ratch \nPower Riau, which is the borrower. It will be 51% owned by PT. Medco Power Indonesia, a \nleading developer and operator of small and medium size independent power producers (IPPs) \n                                                           \n5  Government of Indonesia, MEMR. 2018. Rencana Usaha Penyediaan Tenaga Listrik (RUPTL), 2018\u20132027. Jakarta.  \n6  In the RUPTL, 2018\u20132027, power demand was revised downward from 2015\u20132017 levels because economic growth \nwas lower than expected. However, the planned additional new power capacity by 2027 is still 56 gigawatts, which \nis larger than existing installed capacity in 2017.   \n7  A combined-cycle power plant uses both a gas and a steam turbine. The waste heat from the gas turbine is routed \nto the nearby steam turbine, which generates extra power. Combined-cycle plants are more efficient than traditional \nsimple-cycle plants.  \n8  Sector Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n9  The 2017 cost of power generation published in April 2018 shows an average cost of generation of $0.1098 per \nkilowatt-hour in Riau and the Riau archipelago. [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]  \n10 The project plant will adjust its power output as demand for electricity fluctuates throughout the day. Based on the \ndispatch profile, the anticipated annual capacity factor is 60%.

Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs  \n  \n9.  Impacts. The project will have the following impact: implemented national energy policy \nwhich aims to re-establish Indonesia\u2019s energy independence by using domestic gas for power \ngeneration, and improved reliability of power supply in the Sumatra grid.13   \n  \n10.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: increased delivery of stable and \nreliable power to the domestic grid through CCGT power generation of 1,445 gigawatt-hour \nannually.14  \n  \n11.  Outputs. The project will have the following outputs: (i) successful completion of a \n275MW CCGT power plant and ancillary infrastructure, operated by the private sector; (ii) \ngeneration of local employment opportunities during the construction phase; (iii) stimulation of \nlocal and national economy; and (iv) implementation of measures to promote gender equality \n \nand women\u2019s empowerment. \n  \nC.   Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n  \n12.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. Following ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, \nthe project meets this operational priority: tackling climate change, building climate and disaster \nresilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability.15 Also, the project supports private \nsector participation in infrastructure to fill the infrastructure gap and catalyze and mobilize \nfinancial resources for development.16 The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy  for  Indonesia,  2016\u20132019  in  supporting  the  expansion  of  infrastructure  and \nenvironmentally  friendly  technologies  for  energy  generation.17 It  also  contributes  to  the \nobjectives of Indonesia\u2019s National Energy Plan (footnote 13).  \n                                                           \n11 Client Information (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n12 ADB. 2003.

Consistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, which supports natural gas-based power plants and \nefficient technologies such as combined-cycle. 18 The energy policy also supports public-private \npartnership models that enable the participation of the private sector to help achieve efficiencies \nand reduce reliance on public sector funds. Further, the project complements ADB\u2019s assistance \nto the MEMR and PLN through its results-based and policy-based lending, which includes \nsupport to PLN for grid capacity improvement in Sumatra.19   \n  \n14.  Lessons from previous operations. The project will benefit from ADB\u2019s exposure to \nIndonesia\u2019s energy sector and experience gained from structuring and implementing energy \nprojects in Indonesia.20 Most of the private sector power projects that have been financed by \nADB to date are still under construction but are generally on track. ADB\u2019s experience indicates \nthat successful project implementation depends on the sponsors\u2019 strength, experience, and \nability to understand the regulatory environment, as well as the terms and conditions governing \nthe financing of such projects.  \n  \nD.

Ancillary infrastructure includes \na 150-kV switchyard on site, 0.75 km long 150-kV power line with eight new pylons, a 40-km gas \npipeline connecting to the main gas network, 3 km of water intake and discharge pipelines to the \nSiak river, and a temporary jetty for the transport of heavy equipment. The temporary jetty, water \nintake and outlet are located adjacent to the existing Tenayan coal-fired power plant. Pekanbaru \ncity is approximately 3 km to the west and the closest residence is 0.45 km to the south-east. \nThere are residential properties, a school and a mosque near the gas pipeline, which follows \nexisting roads.  \n  \n21.  The project area is modified habitat with 0.24 hectares of degraded natural habitat. The \ncritically endangered Sunda pangolin (Manis javanica) and endangered agile gibbon (Hylobates \n                                                           \n24 ADB.

Sunda pangolin can occupy modified habitat including an \noil palm plantation but are threatened by hunting and poaching. Agile gibbon occurs in intact and \ndegraded forest and forest edges. Due to actual or potential impacts on natural and critical habitat \nthe project has developed a Biodiversity Action Plan. This includes a no tolerance policy towards \npoaching by workers, education programs for the community, and conservation initiatives.   \n  \n22.  The main air pollutant of potential concern from a CCGT is nitrogen dioxide. Baseline air \nquality  monitoring  showed  that  the  airshed  is  non-degraded  for  nitrogen  dioxide.  During \noperation,  air  dispersion  modeling  shows  that  maximum  ground  level  nitrogen  dioxide \nconcentrations, accounting for maximum potential cumulative emissions from the Tenayan coal-\nfired  power  plant,  comply  with  Indonesian  air  quality  standards  and  the  World  Bank \nEnvironmental Health and Safety Guidelines. In addition, nitrogen dioxide emissions from the \npower plant only are well within the World Bank 25% threshold to allow for future sustainable \ndevelopment.26   \n  \n23.  The plant will source water from the Siak river at a rate of less than 0.5% of minimum daily \nflows. Wastewater will be treated on site before discharge to the river in compliance with \nIndonesian and World Bank Group standards.27 Cooling water does not result in elevated water \ntemperatures and no cumulative impacts are caused by the existing power plant. Impacts on river \necology have been assessed as minor and a fisherfolk survey has also been conducted.  \n  \n24.  During construction, the sponsor is to implement measures to minimize disturbance to \nresidents. This includes a staged approach for gas pipeline installation in 500 meters (m) lengths \nover a two-week period. Stakeholder consultation was undertaken during the local environmental \napproval process and during the preparation of the ESIA. This has included disclosure of the \nESIA and feedback from the community, with additional meetings to be held in November 2018. \nA community grievance redress mechanism was developed and socialized.  \n  \n25.  Involuntary resettlement. The project will not cause involuntary physical displacement \nbut will produce some temporary involuntary economic displacement and restriction impacts \nthrough pipeline construction. The power plant and switchyard will be constructed on privately \nowned land. Purchase of this land by the borrower was on a voluntary willing-seller willing-buyer \nbasis on commercial terms at market value. Land required for the pumphouse and water intake \narea  will  be  leased  from  the  government.  Water  intake  and  discharge  pipelines  are  on \ngovernment land and will be laid along existing corridors with easement rights. Land on the bank \nof the Siak river required during construction for a temporary jetty is unoccupied but its use for \nthe project may restrict the access of river users during the 8month construction period. The route \nof the 40-km buried gas supply pipeline has been designed to minimize displacement impacts \nand will be built within an existing road right-of-way and on state-owned and privately-owned oil \npalm plantations.  \n \n26.  A  plan  to  manage  all  temporary  project-related  involuntary  economic  displacement \nimpacts through compensation and livelihood restoration measures has been developed by the \nborrower. It is not expected that any involuntary physical displacement will occur because there \nare no dwellings located at the power plant site or within the transmission tower alignment and \n                                                           \n26 IFC. 2008.

World Bank Group, Washington, DC.  ", "8    \n \nthe gas and water pipelines will predominantly run along the road reserve or within easements \nwhich will be agreed with the affected landowners. The borrower is directly responsible for the \nimplementation of the compensation and livelihood restoration measures.    \n  \n27.  Indigenous peoples. No distinct and vulnerable indigenous peoples or ethnic minority \ngroups as defined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) are identified as present in the \nproject\u2019s  area  of  influence.  The  project  impact  assessment  identifies  presence  of  ethnic \nsubgroups of the Malay (Melayu) majority, which is one of Indonesia\u2019s larger ethnic groups.  \n  \n28.  Some gender elements. In addition to measures required under national law and \nsafeguards requirements, at ADB\u2019s request and guidance, PT. Medco Ratch Power Riau has \ncommitted to implement measures to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment in its \nproject business activities following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (2003). These \nmeasures are: (i) women\u2019s health training events programmed in collaboration with community \nhealth centers; (ii) early childhood education and development training events focused on the \nneeds of girls, programmed in collaboration with community groups; and (iii) financial literacy \ntraining events for households and enterprises focused on the needs of women, programmed in \ncollaboration  with  community  groups.  The  borrower  will  submit  periodic  reports  on \nimplementation of gender measures to ADB as part of its environmental and social monitoring \nreports.  \n  \n29.  Other social aspects. PT. Medco Ratch Power Riau will comply with national labor laws \nand, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy (2001), will take measures to comply with \ninternationally recognized core labor standards. The client will report regularly to ADB on (i) its \ncompliance with such laws and that of its contractors, and (ii) the measures taken. Information \ndisclosure and consultation with affected people will follow ADB requirements.28  \n  \nB.   Anticorruption Policy  \n  \n30.  PT.  Medco  Ratch  Power  Riau  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  of  implementing  best \ninternational practice relating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of \nterrorism. ADB will ensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate provisions \nprohibiting corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB \nin the event of noncompliance.  \n  \nC.
