The  investment  program  aims  to \nimprove  approximately  2,787  km  of  road  sections  in  Kazakhstan  along  CAREC  Corridor  1, \nrunning  from  Khorgos  through  Almaty  and  Shymkent  to  the  Russian  Federation's  western \nborder. When  the  investment  program  is  completed  in  2015,  the  corridor  is  expected  to  more \nefficiently carry increasing international traffic. \n\n3. \nThe project is compatible with the CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy and \nAction Plan,2 and the core business areas of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Kazakhstan. \n\n4. \nThe  investment  program  has  been  smoothly  implemented  since  its  start  in  2009,  with \nassistance  from  international  financial  institutions.  The  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and \nDevelopment is financing a 102 km road section and the World Bank a 1,062 km road section. \nThe Islamic Development Bank (IDB), the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and \nADB  committed  to  improving  a  480  km  section  in  Zhambyl  Oblast  through  the  investment \nprogram.3 Specifically, ADB committed to finance approximately 301 km through a multitranche \nfinancing  facility  (MFF)  not  exceeding  $700  million,4 IDB  committed  to  finance  159  km,5 and \nJICA 20 km. \n\n5. \nSince  2008,  ADB  has  provided  four  loans  totaling  $697  million  under  the  MFF,  which \nfinanced improvement of approximately 351 km of road sections;6 IDB provided a $170 million \nloan in 2009 for 57 km; and JICA provided a $68 million loan in 2010 for 20 km. \n\n6. \nFinancial  issues  caused  IDB  to  withdraw  in  2010  its  earlier  commitment  to  finance \nimprovement of two remaining sections, totaling 114 km, which the government then requested \nthat ADB finance. The seamless completion of all road sections in Zhambyl Oblast is crucial for \nthe success of the investment program, and consequently ADB approved, with available funds \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The section is part of CAREC Corridor 1, one of the six priority transport corridors under the CAREC Transport and \n\nTrade Facilitation Strategy. \n\n3  The total length for road improvement in Zhambyl Oblast has been updated to 493 km from 480 km. \n4  ADB.  2008.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Multitranche \nFinancing  Facility and  Administration of Loan  to  the  Republic of  Kazakhstan  for  the  CAREC  Transport  Corridor I \n(Zhambyl  Oblast  Section)  [Western  Europe\u2013Western  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  International  Transit  Corridor] \nInvestment Program. Manila. \n\n5  The total length for road improvement under IDB financing has been increased to 171 km from 159 km. \n6  The implementation of civil works for projects 1 and 2, started in 2010, is progressing satisfactorily. Projects 3 and \n4 are at an early stage; civil works for project 3 is expected to start in March 2012, and for project 4, in May 2012. \nThe  development  of  intelligent  transport  system  strategy,  which  will  contribute  to  improved  road  operation  and \nmaintenance will commence by November 2011. \n\n\funder  the  existing  MFF,  a  $112  million  loan  in  February  2011  as  tranche  4  of  the  MFF  to \nimprove a 49 km portion of IDB\u2019s former 114 km section.7 It is now proposed that ADB provide a \nseparate loan of $95 million to improve the 65 km Taraz bypass (the remaining portion of IDB\u2019s \nformer section), as the MFF has been fully utilized.  \n\n7. \nThe 65 km Taraz bypass section is integral to the transport corridor, connecting the oil-\nrich  western  part  of  the  country  to  southeast  Kazakhstan  and  beyond.  The  project  will  boost \nregional connectivity and strengthen the viability of the investment program roads. \n\n8. \nKazakhstan's  93,600  km  road  network  includes  23,495  km  of  republican  (national  and \ninternational) roads, with the rest being rural and urban roads. Road freight traffic has increased \nas  a  result  of  growth  in  vehicular  traffic  and  private  road-hauling  companies,  shorter  transport \nhauls of goods compared to other modes of transport, and a changing industrial and distribution \npattern. In 2009, roads accounted for 25% of Kazakhstan's freight traffic by ton-km and 85% of \nits  passenger  traffic  by  passenger-km.  These  shares  are  likely  to  continue  to  grow  in  the \nforeseeable future. \n\n9. \nKazakhstan\u2019s road sector has operational and institutional bottlenecks, caused mainly by \n(i)  insufficient  and  deteriorating  infrastructure,  (ii)  weak  cost  recovery,  (iii) inefficient  cross-\nborder  procedures,  (iv)  weak  planning,  and  (v)  limited  project  development  and  management \ncapacity.  These  bottlenecks  raise  transport  costs  and  hamper  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration  opportunities,  undercutting  the  country\u2019s  competitiveness.  Based  on  the  lessons \nlearned,  ADB  realized  that  sufficient  support  for  institutional  capacity  development  throughout \nthe duration of the projects has to be sustained. This is further described under implementation \narrangements (para. 15). \n\n10.  Much of the road network is in poor condition, as 40% of republican roads require major \nrehabilitation and proper maintenance. The feeder road network serving the rural population is \nnot fully developed. Roads on the six main international corridors are mostly paved with asphalt, \nbut  their  technical  and  operational  characteristics  (e.g.,  evenness  and  strength)  are  below \ninternational standards, with current traffic often exceeding allowable loads. \n\nThe  government  has  adopted  the  2020  Strategy  for  Economic  Development  and  the \n11. \nState  Program  on  Accelerated  Industrial-Innovative  Development  (SPAID)  to  diversify  the \neconomy  and  promote  balanced  developments.  To  effectively  support  the  2020  Strategy  and \nSPAID,  the  government  reshaped  and  expanded  its  previous  road  development  plan  into  the \nTransport  Sector  Program  (TSP)  for  2010\u20132014.8 The  TSP  will  develop  an  efficient  transport \nsystem that is integrated into the international transport network. The project aligns with ADB's \nStrategy 2020,9 its country operations business plan for 2010\u20132011,10 and Kazakhstan's SPAID \nand TSP. \n\n                                                \n7  The maximum amount available under the MFF was limited. \n8  The 2020 Strategy for Economic Development was approved in February 2010; the SPAID was approved in March \n\n9  ADB.  2008.

The  outcome  will  ensure  better \nconnectivity for the Zhambyl Oblast section of the CAREC Transport Corridor 1. \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  outputs  will  be  (i)  an  approximate  7.7  km  upgraded  road,  from  category-II  to \n13. \ncategory-IB with four lanes; and (ii) an approximate 57.4 km new category-II bypass road. The \nupgrading  of  the  existing  7.7  km  section  will  be  undertaken  within  the  existing  right-of-way; \nconstruction of the 57.4 km bypass will require land acquisition. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nD. \n \n14. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $123  million  equivalent,  inclusive  of  taxes  and  duties. \nThe government has requested a loan of $95 million from ADB to help finance the project. The \ngovernment will finance the balance. The loan, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, will have \na  24-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  4  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment  charge of  0.15%  per  year (the  interest  and other  charges  during construction  will \nnot  be  capitalized  in  the  loan  and  will  be  paid  separately  by  the  government),  and such  other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The government has provided ADB \nwith (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility based \non  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own \nindependent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any  communication  or  advice  from  ADB. \nTables 1 summarizes the project investment plan and Table 2 the financing plan. \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nItem \n\n \n\n \n \n\nA. \n\nB. \n\nBase Costb \n \n \nContingenciesc \n \n \n\nCivil works for km 483\u2013km 536 \nSubtotal (A) \n\nAmounta \n\n112.0 \n112.0 \n             11.0 \n123.0 \n\nTotal (A+B) \n\n  \nkm = kilometer. \na  Includes taxes and duties of $17 million to be financed from government resources. \nb  In 2011 prices. \nc  Physical contingencies computed at 10% for civil works.

The  program \nmanagement  unit  (PMU)  within  the  Committee  of  Roads  is  in  charge  of  four  ongoing  MFF \nprojects,  assisted  by  the  program  management  consultants,  and  will  manage  this  project.11 \nFollowing  a  capacity  assessment  mission  in  July  2011,  it  was  determined  that  additional \nresources\u2014particularly safeguard, procurement, and contracts specialists staff\u2014will be needed \nto support the PMU in managing projects. These additional resources will be engaged under the \ntranche 1 loan (Loan 2503-KAZ) (footnote 4). MOTC has also planned for additional staff at the \noblast  level.  The  terms  of  reference  of  the  supervision  consulting  firm  engaged  under  the \ntranche 4 project (Loan 2735-KAZ) are sufficiently broad to enable it to provide supervision and \nsafeguards  implementation  management  for  this  project.  Therefore,  sufficient  additional \nresources  have  been  planned  to  address  overall  management  and supervision  of  this  project. \nSufficient  funds  are  available  under  the  respective  loans  mentioned  to  finance  the  additional \nscope.

The 7.7 km section between km 483 and km 491 will \nbe upgraded to technical category IB, situated at the edge of Taraz City. The remaining 57.4 km \nsection  between  km  491  and  km  536  (a  two-lane  bypass  road  around  Taraz  City)  will  be \nconstructed to technical category II specifications. The project involves (i) widening the 7.7 km \nsection from a two- to four-lane road with a center mall, and (ii) constructing a 57.4 km two-lane \nbypass for a design speed of 120 km per hour. All traffic lanes and shoulders on both sides will \nbe  3.75  meters  wide.  The  65  km  sections  will  be  paved  with  asphalt.  The  right-of-way  is \ndesigned with a 200-meter buffer zone to keep the alignment away from the archaeological sites \nin  the  surrounding  area.  Crossing  two  rivers,  the  alignment  will  include  two  bridges,  four \ninterchanges,  and  railway  overpasses  paved  with  asphalt  concrete.  The  detailed  design  is \ncomplete including the preparation of the civil works bidding documents. \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n17. \nThe project will contribute to achieving the envisaged benefits of the improved transport \ncorridor: higher travel speeds, shortened travel distances, and improved road safety standards. \nThe  economic  evaluation  of  the  project  was  undertaken  using  ADB's Guidelines  for  Economic \nAnalysis of Projects.13 The economic analysis compares the with- and without-project scenarios. \nThe  methodology  and  general  approach  to  the  economic  evaluation  involved  updating  the \nprevious  due  diligence  work  carried  out  when  the  four  Zhambyl  Oblast  road  sections  were \noriginally  analyzed,  individually  and  collectively,  to  prepare  the  (subsequently  approved) \nCAREC  Transport  Corridor  I  Investment  Program.  The  construction  costs  and  disbursement \nprogram have been updated, as well as values of time, vehicle operating cost, and time savings. \nThe economic costs are (i) capital, including physical contingencies but excluding taxes; and (ii) \noperation  and  maintenance,  including  replacing  of  depreciated  equipment.  The  economic \nbenefits are (i) savings in vehicle operating costs resulting from the improved project road, and \n(ii)  time  savings.  The  neighboring  road  sections  remain  under  construction,  and  traffic  on  the \nproject road therefore remains unchanged. Using the 2009 average daily traffic volumes, annual \nnormal traffic growth was forecast at 4% for 2010\u20132014, and 6% thereafter.  Generated traffic, \nestimated  as  10%\u201330%  of  normal  traffic,  was  included  in  the  analysis.  The  project  is \neconomically  feasible  with  an  estimated  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  13.5%.  Sensitivity \ntests confirmed the project would remain feasible should the envisaged project costs increase, \nor benefits be reduced. No financial analysis was undertaken because the project road will not \ngenerate any revenues. \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n18. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MOTC. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare  described  in  the  PAM  (footnote  12).  The  government\u2019s  policies  and  procedures  regarding \nfinancial management and procurement have been assessed and found to be lacking in some \nareas.  The  additional  resources  described  under  implementation  arrangements  (para.  15)  will \nbe mobilized to manage and monitor compliance with these policies and procedures. \n\n                                                \n13  ADB. 1997.

Key measures to \nensure  proper governance  are (i) independent  external  auditing  of  contracts,  project  accounts, \nand financial statements; (ii) transparent decision processes for all procurement matters; and (iii) \nverification  of  contractors\u2019  payment  claims  by  the  supervising  consultant  and  oversight  by  the \nPMU. \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n20. \nThe  average per  capita income of Zhambyl  Oblast  is  one  of the  lowest  in Kazakhstan. \nThe  main  economic  activities  in  the  project  area  are  agriculture,  and  livestock  and  poultry \nraising.  The  project  is  expected  to  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  stimulating  economic \nactivities  by  improving  the  transport  of  goods  and  people  and  access  to  services.  The  project \nwill  also  benefit  local  residents  and  enterprises  by  creating  jobs  during  construction  and \nreducing  transport  cost  and  travel  time.  Social  and  poverty  assessments  are  shown  in  the \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy.14 \n\n21. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  a  general  intervention,  with  no  direct  poverty  reduction \ncomponent.  It  will  benefit  poor  people  in the  project  area  by  improving transport  conditions for \nbetter access to social services. The project will create some job opportunities for women during \nimplementation and after project completion, apart from the benefits described above. \n\n22. \nThe  civil  works  contract  will  require  that  contractors  (i)  comply  with  Kazakhstan\u2019s \napplicable labor laws and related international treaty obligations and not employ child labor; (ii) \nprovide safe working conditions and separate sanitation facilities for male and female workers; \n(iii)  provide  equal  wages  to  male  and  female  workers  for  work  of  equal  value;  (iv)  provide \nemployment  opportunities  for  women;  and  (v)  carry  out  HIV/AIDS,  illicit  drugs,  and  human \ntrafficking prevention and awareness programs in workers\u2019 campsites. \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n1. \n\nEnvironment \n\n \n23. \nThe project is classified as environment category A. MOTC prepared the environmental \nimpact  assessment  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009). 15  Major \nanticipated  environmental  impacts  relate  to  construction  of  bridges,  railway  overpasses, \ninterchanges,  and  cutting  \u2015non-special  status\u2016  trees.  The  alignment  has  been  designed  to \nensure it does not encroach on archeological sites. Adequate mitigation measures are included \nin,  and  will  be  implemented  through,  the  environmental  management  plan.  The  environmental \nmanagement  plan  stipulates  that  capacity  development  be  provided  for  MOTC  and  its \nconsultants  through  training  workshops  at  the  preconstruction  and  construction  stages.  The \nproject  management  consultants  (para.  15)  will  supplement  the  PMU  in  managing  the \nenvironmental  impacts  of  the  project,  including  through  capacity  development.  The  project \ncomplies with public disclosure and consultation requirements. \n\n                                                \n14 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 Environmental  Impact  Assessment  (accessible  from  the list  of linked  documents in  Appendix  2)  endorsed  by the \n\ngovernment on 21 June 2011 and cleared by ADB on 4 July 2011. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f2. \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement \n\n \n24. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  involuntary  resettlement  category  B.  Some  98  households \nand 10 legal entities will be affected by the project, but most impacts are expected to be minor, \nwith no households displaced under the project. Only five households will lose more than 10% \nof their land. Some 214 hectares of land will be acquired for permanent use, most of which (188 \nhectares) are leased on a long-term basis for agricultural use. \n\nAccording to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, the government has revised its earlier \n25. \ndraft  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  (LARP),  which  was  prepared  under IDB financing. \nThe final LARP includes adequate provisions for additional compensation for termination of land \nleases  and  for  assistance  for  the  severely  affected  households.  The  original  LARP  was \ndisclosed to displaced persons during several public consultations in 2009\u20132011, and brochures \nin Russian and Kazak were distributed. The original LARP was partially implemented in 2009 as \npart  of  the  preparation  for  IDB  financing.  Consultations  on  the  final  LARP  were  held  with \naffected  persons  during  March\u2013May  2011.  The  final  LARP  has  been  disclosed.  Supplemental \ncompensation  payments  amounting  to  T8.4  million,  to  be  funded  by  the  government,  are \nexpected  to  be  completed  by  December  2011.  Completion  of  LARP  implementation  is  a \ncondition  for  starting  civil  works.  The  government  will  ensure  that  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  activities  comply  with  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of  the  borrower  and \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  as  specified  in  the  LARP.  Adequate  experienced  staff \ncapacity for implementation of the LARP will be ensured by engaging an additional resettlement \nspecialist. An external monitoring consultant, engaged by ADB, will monitor and validate LARP \nimplementation.  A  community  liaison  group,  recently  established for  ADB\u2019s  CAREC  Corridor  1 \ninvestment  program,  will  assist  in  disseminating  information  to  displaced  persons  and \ncommunities along the road and in resolving grievances arising from project activities. \n\n3. \n\nIndigenous Peoples \n\n \n26. \ndefinition of indigenous peoples are expected to be negatively affected by the project. \n\nThe  project  is  classified  as  indigenous  peoples  category  C.  No  people  fitting  ADB\u2019s \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n27.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.16 The  risks  are  considered  manageable \nthrough the prescribed mitigating measures. \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisk \nDelayed implementation of the LARP \n\nPossible interruption due to complaints \nfrom local community \n\n \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nClose monitoring of implementation of the LARP, including \npayments of compensation to affected people and provision \nof necessary supports.
