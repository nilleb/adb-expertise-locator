The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a multitranche financing facility (MFF) to \nPakistan on 23 August 2016 for an aggregate amount of up to $810 million\u2014comprising provisions \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR) and Special Funds resources (Asian Development \nFund)\u2014for the Second Power Transmission Enhancement Investment Program.1 ADB and the \nGovernment of Pakistan signed a framework financing agreement (FFA) for the investment program \non 15 July 2016.  \n \n2.  Sector context during the appraisal of the second multitranche financing facility. \nPakistan faces power shortages. Lack of access to grid electricity affects 34% of the population and \nis one of the main constraints to inclusive sustainable growth. The average daily shortfall of 4,500\u2013\n6,000 megawatts (MW) causes frequent load shedding, which led to civil strife and factory closures \nin  2013  and  2014.  Aging,  overloaded,  and  unreliable  transmission  and  distribution  systems \nexacerbate the problem. Sustained electricity payment arrears, or circular debt,2 deterred investment \nacross the sector, resulting in insufficient, inefficient, unreliable, and unsustainable power supply. \nMajor causes of continued accumulation of circular debt include (i) the gap between end-user and \ncost recovery tariffs due to high generation cost, high transmission and distribution system losses, \nand a low collection rate;3 (ii) the ambiguity in legislation, which has blocked the government\u2019s efforts \nto introduce surcharges and other policy decisions to boost the sector\u2019s financial sustainability; and \n(iii) the overall lack of transparency and low institutional efficiency in the sector.  \n \n3.  Road map. The government\u2019s development vision is reflected in Pakistan\u2019s Vision 2025,4 \nwhich recognizes that sufficient, reliable, clean, and cost-effective energy for all is indispensable to \nensure sustainable economic growth and development in Pakistan. The vision\u2019s power sector goals \nby 2025 are to (i) double power generation to over 45,000 MW with percentage of indigenous \nsources of power generation over 50%, (ii) increase electricity access to 90% of the population, (iii) \nreduce  system  losses  to  10%,  (iv)  introduce  institutional  reform  and  strengthen  regulatory \nframeworks to improve transparence and efficiency, (v) address institutional fragmentation and \ndecay of the sector due to poor capacity, and (vi) improve demand management.  \n \n4.  Policy framework. The National Power Policy, 20135 supports the road map to Vision 2025. \nThe three guiding principles of the policy are efficiency, competition, and sustainability. One of the \npolicy\u2019s five targets is to decrease aggregate technical and commercial transmission and distribution \nlosses from 25% in 2013 to 16% in 2017.6 It also includes the following transmission system \nstrategies: (i) expanding and strengthening the transmission grid to increase electricity access and \nimprove the quality and reliability of supply; (ii) reducing losses through improved planning and \ndesign, economic dispatch, and implementation of improved monitoring equipment and software; (iii) \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2016. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche Financing \nFacility to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Second Power Transmission Enhancement Investment Program. \nManila.  \n2  Circular debt represents payables to electricity producers and fuel suppliers, caused by insufficient cash flows from \npower distribution companies. \n3  The government\u2019s targeted average cost of generation is $0.10/kilowatt-hour (kWh), down from $0.12/kWh in 2013. This \ncompares with an average notified user tariff of $0.11/kWh. The government has not passed on the cost of electricity to \nconsumers for sociopolitical reasons. The gap between the end-user and cost-recovery tariff consists of two factors: (i) \nthe difference between cost recovery and National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA)-determined tariffs; and \n(ii) the difference between NEPRA-determined and government-notified tariffs, which are balanced through subsidies, \nbut the subsidies are always insufficient and untimely. \n4  Government of Pakistan. 2014. Pakistan Vision 2025: One Nation, One Vision. Islamabad.  \n5  Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Water and Power. 2013. National Power Policy, 2013. Islamabad. \n6  Other targets include decreasing the supply\u2013demand gap from 4,500 MW\u20135,000 MW to 0 MW by 2017; decreasing the \ncost of generation from $0.12/unit to $0.10/unit by 2017, increasing collection from 85% to 95% by 2017; and shortening \nthe decision-making processing time at the Ministry of Water and Power, related departments, and regulators. \n ", "2 \n \nincentivizing private sector investment; and (iv) establishing transparency and controls for dispatch \nand payment. One of the key challenges to achieve the targets specified in the policy and in Vision \n2025 is the low institutional efficiency of power sector utilities.  \n \n5.  Second multitranche financing facility and its tranches. In line with the government\u2019s \nVision 2025; the National Power Policy, 2013; and ADB\u2019s sector strategy, the second MFF supports \n(i) meeting the quality and reliability of power supply standards; (ii) serving the increasing customer \ndemand; and (iii) developing a more balanced generation mix with more renewable energy through \nexpansion and reinforcement of a stronger, smarter, and more climate-resilient transmission system. \nIts capacity development component supports policy reforms; enhanced sector competition and \ntransparency;  and  improved  institutional  efficiency,  good  governance,  planning,  project \nmanagement, and procurement capacities of the National Transmission and Dispatch Company \nLimited (NTDC)\u2014the transmission system owner and operator\u2014and the Central Power Purchasing \nAgency (Guarantee) Limited (CPPA-G)\u2014the sector\u2019s commercial operator.  \n \n6.  The second MFF comprises four tranches. Government selected the tranches in accordance \nwith the selection criteria set forth in schedule 4 of the FFA, taking into account a fair geographic \ncoverage.  Tranche  1  focuses  on  the  rehabilitation  and  augmentation  of  500-kilovolt  (kV) \ntransmission systems in Punjab and Sindh provinces (footnote 1). Through its concessional loan \nfrom the Asian Development Fund, Tranche 1 provides capacity development to support the NTDC\u2019s \norganizational restructuring and to enhance its capacity to plan, design, operate, and manage assets \nthroughout the second MFF. Tranche 2 will expand the 220 kV transmission system in the provinces \nof Sindh and Balochistan.7 It will also upgrade the supervisory control and data acquisition system \nacross the national grid to enable the NTDC to monitor and control the grid in real time, and to \nprevent network outages or reduce their duration, thereby increasing grid stability, reliability, and \nresilience to accommodate more intermittent renewable energy. Tranche 3 will expand the 500 kV \nand 220 kV transmission systems to meet demand at load centers in Punjab Province. Tranche 4 \nwill help evacuate hydropower to load centers in Islamabad and in the provinces of Punjab and \nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa.

On 14 May 2018, ADB received the government\u2019s periodic financing \nrequest for tranche 3, totaling $284 million, comprising an OCR loan of $280 million and a grant of \n$4 million from the High-Level Technology Fund (HLTF) (Appendix 1).

Given the urgent demand for the transmission \nsystems (para 9), the government requested that the implementation of Tranche 3 commences in \n2018. Similarly, Tranche 4 is now likely to commence in 2019, instead of March 2021. \n \nII.  ASSESSMENT OF MULTITRANCHE FINANCING FACILITY IMPLEMENTATION  \n \n8.  Progress on road map. The road map did not have substantial or material changes in \nstrategic direction. The significant private sector investments it attracted increased the total installed \ngeneration capacity from 23.6 gigawatts (GW) in 2013 to 30.9 GW in 2017, and this is expected to \nrise further to 38.0 GW in 2019.9 Hydropower, gas, and furnace oil or high-speed diesel dominated \nthe generation mix of installed capacity, each accounting for about a one-third share in 2013. From \n2013 to 2017, the share of furnace oil or high-speed diesel declined from 30% to 14%, mainly through \nsubstitution by nuclear (4%); wind, solar, and bagasse (5%); and coal (5%). Energy security has \nimproved, and generation cost has been reduced from $0.12 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) to about $0.09 \nper kWh.10 The duration of load shedding in urban areas and the industrial sector decreased from \n12 hours per day in 2013 to 6 hours and 4 hours in 2016 (footnote 9). The transmission and \ndistribution loss dropped from 20.9% in 2013 to 19.4% in 2017, and the electricity bill collection rate \nincreased from 85% to 91% (footnote 10), albeit below their respective targets set in the National \nPower Policy, 2013 (footnote 5). \n \n9.  While  there  has  been  substantial  private  sector  involvement  in  transmission  system \ndevelopment, the progress is not keeping pace with the addition of generation capacity.11 During \n2013\u20132017, generation capacity increased by 30% (from 23.6 GW to 30.9 GW) with a compound \nannual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.9%, helped particularly by 19% (4.9 GW) increases in 2016 and \n2017. The transmission system only increased at a CAGR of 2.4% during the same period, and the \nrate for the distribution system was even lower (footnote 10), hampering the delivery of the full \nbenefits of the higher generation CAGR to customers. This further deteriorated the already weak \nfinancial capacity of distribution companies, which need to make capacity payments to power \nproducers after the commercial operation date based on take-or-pay power purchasing agreements, \neven when no electricity is generated or taken. This is one of the main reasons for the sudden \nincrease in circular debt from PRs321.0 billion as of 30 June 2016 to PRs379.0 billion as of 30 June \n2017 (footnote 10).  \n \n10.  Improvements in policy framework. ADB, together  with other development partners, \nsupported sector reforms through the $2.4 billion Sustainable Energy Sector Reform Program with \nthe  purpose  of  (i)  managing  the  tariff  regime  for  cost  recovery,  (ii)  improving  energy  sector \nperformance and the market access for private sector participation, and (iii) increasing accountability \nand transparency in the power sector.12 The Parliament amended the National Electric Power \nRegulatory Authority (NEPRA) Act in February 2018, allowing the government to (i) impose a \nsurcharge for tariff rationalization or subsidy management purposes, to address the circular debt, (ii) \nimprove its efficiency and accountability as policy maker to prepare a national electricity policy and \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2017.

Power System Statistics 2016\u20132017 (42nd Edition). Lahore. \n11  In 2016, Private Power Infrastructure Board secured a $3 billion investment from the private sector to develop two 660-\nkilovolt (kV) high-voltage direct current transmission lines totaling 4,000 MW of capacity, which will evacuate electricity \nfrom the power hub in Sindh Province to the load center in Punjab Province, with commercial operation in 2019. \n12 The Sustainable Energy Sector Reform Program comprises three subprograms. Subprogram 1 ($400.0 million) was \napproved in 2014 and subprogram 2 ($400.0 million) in 2015, with cofinancing from the World Bank ($1.1 billion) and \nthe Japan International Cooperation Agency (\u00a510 billion). Subprogram 3 was approved in June 2017, with cofinancing \nfrom the Agen\u00e7e Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (\u20ac100 million). \n   ", "4 \n \nplan, (iii) enhance NEPRA as sector regulator with empowered authority to supervise distribution \ncompanies and address consumer complaints, and (iv) develop a more competitive electricity market.  \n \n11.  The government created the Ministry of Energy in August 2017 by merging the Ministry of \nPetroleum and Natural Resources with the power division of the Ministry of Water and Power. This \ncritical step for integrated energy sector planning and policy development followed the policy \nrecommendations of the report by the Friends of Democratic Pakistan Energy Sector Taskforce, \ncochaired by ADB and the government.13 The CPPA-G is evolving into a competitive wholesale \nelectricity market operator, which is essential for an efficient and transparent power sector.14 NEPRA \napproved transmission tariff guidelines, establishing a transparent methodology for determining \ntransmission revenues and service charges, a prerequisite for the approval of privately financed \ntransmission projects.15 \n \n12.  Further, ADB is providing technical assistance to help the government (i) assess lessons \nlearned in 2010\u20132016 from the implementation of the Friends of Democratic Pakistan Energy Sector \nTaskforce Report recommendations and the National Power Policy, 2013; (ii) update the National \nPower  Policy,  2013  to  promote  competition,  power  market  development,  and  private  sector \ninvolvement; and (iii) develop a national electricity plan to rationalize the energy mix that addresses \nenergy security and climate change impacts.16 The Council of Common Interests is expected to \napprove the new National Power Policy in 2018.  \n \n13.  Progress of investment program. There were no substantial or material changes in the \ntype of investments contemplated under the investment program. The MFF performance is rated on \ntrack. The NTDC is the executing agency. For Tranche 1, three of eight procurement packages have \nbeen awarded as of 31 March 2018, and the facility management consultant (FMC) was mobilized \nin January 2018. The awarded contracts total $27.7 million, of which $3.5 million has been disbursed. \nAll other contracts will be awarded in the third quarter (Q3) of 2018. Under tranche 2, the NTDC \nissued all the bidding documents. Bid submission deadlines are in May and June 2018. The NTDC \nwill award all contracts in 2018. Tranches 1 and 2 are also rated on track, given that delivery of all \nphysical and nonphysical investments is expected to be completed on time. \n \n14.  Compliance with undertakings and loan covenants. The government and the NTDC are \ncompliant with most of the FFA undertakings and loan covenants for tranches 1 and 2 to date. \nConstruction work on a small section of a transmission line contract (17 among 177 towners) under \nTranche  1  commenced  before  affected  persons  were  compensated.  The  NTDC  prepared  a \ncorrective action plan and ADB approved and disclosed it on 3 May 2018. The NTDC has paid the \ncost of damaged crops and trees to affected persons and an independent monitoring consultant has \nvalidated the cost. The NTDC has not submitted semi-annual safeguards monitoring report covering \nJuly \u2013 December 2017 for one contract under Tranche 1, rather it will submit the monitoring report \ncovering July 2017 \u2013 June 2018 in July 2018. Both tranches 1 and 2 are classified as category \u201cB\u201d \nfor environment, \u201cB\u201d for involuntary resettlement, and \u201cC\u201d for indigenous peoples. To assure full \ncompliance with safeguards covenants for tranche 1 and tranche 2, NTDC will submit to ADB for \napproval  updated  safeguards  instruments  and  third-party  validation  reports  on  payment  of \ncompensation, following the procedure as described in para 38, and submit safeguards monitoring \n                                                \n13  Membership consists of the government and 26 donors, including France, Germany, Japan, the People's Republic of \nChina, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

Impact and Outcome \n \n15.  Tranche 3 is aligned with the following impacts: (i) improved transmission infrastructure \n(footnote 5), and (ii) improved energy market transparency and efficiency (footnote 4). Tranche 3 will \nhave the following outcome: improved coverage, reliability, transparency, and quality of the power \ntransmission service in Pakistan. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 2. \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n16.  Tranche 3 will support the NTDC in meeting the electricity demand of 1,150 MW efficiently \nand reliably at loan centers in Punjab Province.17 A battery storage energy system (BESS) pilot \nproject in tranche 3 will also enhance the NTDC\u2019s capacity to dispatch intermittent renewable energy \nand provide frequency regulations.  \n \n17.  Output  1:  Transmission  system  capacity  augmented  and  expanded.  This  output \ninvolves three subprojects. Subproject 1 involves the installation of a 500 kV, 3,000 megavolt-\nampere (MVA) substation in Lahore North; extension at 500 kV Gujranwala substation; and 194 \nkilometers (km) of associated new transmission lines and reconductoring of 44 km of transmission \nlines with high-temperature, low-sag (HTLS) conductors. Subproject 2 involves the installation of a \n500 kV switching station near the village of Maira. Subproject 3 involves the installation of a 220 kV, \n480 MVA substation near the town of Jauharabad and 12 km of associated transmission lines.  \n \n18.  Output 2: Grid-connected large-scale BESS installed. This output adopts high-level \ntechnology and comprises subproject 4: a 20 MW, 5 MWh BESS pilot project at Jhimpir I substation. \n \n19.  Key features of Tranche 3. Tranche 3 will promote high-level technologies and climate-\nchange-resilient transmission systems. It will support the first large-scale grid-connected BESS pilot \nproject in Pakistan, which will provide subsecond frequency regulation. This pilot project will use \nwind power to help the NTDC comply with frequency requirements in the existing Grid Code, and \nwill supplement the functions of the supervisory-control and data-acquisition system being upgraded \nunder Tranche 2. Because the Grid Code does not have a penalty clause for noncompliance with \nfrequency requirements, the BESS pilot project will recommend on the (i) revision of the Grid Code \nfor better frequency compliance; and (ii) development of a commercial ancillary services market, \nwhich is key to the envisaged power market. Tranche 3 will promote the deployment of HTLS \nconductors, which can operate at higher ambient temperatures within the required vertical clearance. \nCompared to conventional aluminum conductor steel-reinforced conductors of an equivalent size, \nHTLS conductors can transfer more current with less loss of energy. Tranche 3 will also support the \nreplacement of porcelain insulators with a fog-resistant type, such as glass or composite insulators, \nwhich are expected to perform better in heavily polluted areas. The 500 kV Lahore North substation \nwill be the largest substation in Pakistan. \n \nC.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plans  \n \n20.  Tranche 3 is estimated to cost $428 million (Table 2). Detailed cost estimates by expenditure \ncategory and financier are in the project administration manual (PAM) (Appendix 7).  \n                                                \n17 In 2017, about 6,000 MW of the 14,800 MW load demand in Punjab Province was poorly supplied. \n   ", "6 \n \n \nTable 2: Summary Cost Estimates  \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n24.  The NTDC has established a project management unit (PMU) to implement the second MFF. \nThe PMU\u2019s day-to-day project management includes procurement, project execution, financial \nmanagement, and monitoring of and reporting on progress. The FMC firm funded by the support \ncomponent of tranche 1 will assist the NTDC in implementing tranche 3, and in finalizing and \nimplementing its restructuring action plan for better institutional efficiency and better corporatization. \nUniversal procurement will apply to the civil works, goods, turnkey contracts, and consulting services \nto be financed by ADB and the High-Level Technology Fund. The implementation arrangements are \nsummarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the PAM. \n \nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements for Tranche 3 \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2019\u2013December 2023 \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2023 (loan and grant closing on 31 December 2023) \nManagement   \n(i) Oversight body  Ministry of Energy (Power Division) \n(ii) Executing agency  NTDC \n(iii) Key implementation agency  NTDC \n(iv) Implementation units  Project management unit in NTDC \nProcurement  International  10 packages  $255 million \ncompetitive bidding \nConsulting services  ICS  30 person- months  $1.0 million \nRetroactive financing and/or  Advance contracting, including the preparation of bidding documents, \nadvance contracting   inviting and receiving bids for contracts, and retroactive financing of \nup to 20% of the loan amount for expenditures incurred 12 months \nbefore loan signing. \nDisbursement  Loan and grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) \nand detailed arrangements agreed on between the government and \nADB.  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ICS = individual consultant selection, NTDC = National Transmission and Dispatch \nCompany Limited, TBD = to be decided. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nE.  Project Readiness \n \n25.  Tranche 3\u2019s readiness is high. The proposed subprojects were  included in the NTDC \ninvestment plan, which NEPRA approved. The Executive Committee of the National Economic \nCouncil approved the Planning Commission proforma 1 (PC-1) of subproject 1 in November 2017 \nand of subproject 2 in March 2018. The Central Development Working Party approved the PC-1 of \nsubprojects 3 and 4 in May 2018.18 The PC-1 is a standard form that sets out the project scope and \ndesign, and establishes the project\u2019s technical, financial, and economic viability.  \n \n26.   The NTDC will issue the bidding documents in June 2018. The master bidding documents \napproved  in  Tranche  2  will  be  adopted,  given  the  similarity  of  technical  specifications  and \nqualification requirements. The PMU has been established and is functional. The FMC funded by \nTranche 1 will help the NTDC manage the implementation of Tranche 3. The land acquisition and \nresettlement plans (LARPs) and initial environmental examinations (IEEs) were disclosed on 23 April \n2018. \n                                                \n18 As per the government\u2019s requirements, the Central Development Working Party\u2019s approval of a PC-1 is a precondition \nfor loan negotiations. Further, for a PC-1 costing more than PRs3.0 billion (about $30.0 million), the approval of the \nExecutive Committee of the National Economic Council is needed before loan agreement signing. \n   ", "8 \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical  \n \n27.  Tranche 3 will continue the efforts made under tranches 1 and 2 to address constraints in the \ntransmission system and enhance the network\u2019s capacity to absorb expected future loads. A total of \n3,480 MVA in substation capacity and 206 km of transmission lines will be added to the system. The \nHTLS conductors will be adopted to reconductor deteriorated 220 kV transmission lines in Lahore to \nimprove transmission capacity, reduce line loss, and adapt to higher temperatures caused by climate \nchange. The NTDC energized the 2.5 km 220 kV Gatti\u2013Nishatabad transmission line reconductoring \nwith HTLS conductors in November 2017. The BESS pilot project will provide subsecond frequency \ncontrol with a range of +/\u2013 0.019 hertz. ADB team conducted detailed due diligence (including load \nflow analysis, cost verification, and technology selection analysis) and confirmed the project as the \noptimal design to address the issues. Tranche 3 will contribute reduction of 166,000 ton of carbon \ndioxide equivalent per year, due to reduced loss and improved efficiency. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n28.  The main benefits derived from Tranche 3 are (i) improved service reliability, (ii) reduced \ntransmission loss, (iii) increased flow of power from increased substation capacity, and (iv) expanded \nnetwork capacity. The analyses compare the incremental costs and benefits of with- and without-\nproject scenarios.  \n \n29.  An  economic  evaluation  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects (Appendix 8).19 An economic internal rate of return of 24.5% justifies \nthe viability of Tranche 3. A sensitivity analysis found that the project\u2019s economic viability remained \nrobust in the cases of (i) a 10% increase in capital costs, (ii) a 10% increase in operation and \nmaintenance  costs,  and  (iii) a  1-year  delay  in  project  completion,  with  the  results  comparing \nfavorably with the economic opportunity cost of capital of 9% assumed for each case. \n \n30.  A financial evaluation was carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial \nManagement and Analysis of Projects (Appendix 9).20 Tranche 3 is financially viable, with a financial \ninternal rate of return of 7.34%, which is greater than the weighted average cost of capital of 5.37%. \nA sensitivity analysis found that the project\u2019s financial viability remains robust in the cases of (i) a \n10% increase in capital costs, (ii) a 10% increase in operation and maintenance costs, (iii) a 10% \ndecrease in revenues, and (iv) a 1-year delay in project completion. \n \n31.  The NTDC\u2019s operating performance has improved from PRs6.0 billion in profits before tax in \n2012 to PRs13.6 billion in 2016. Its liquidity has also improved since large amounts of outstanding \nreceivables from distribution companies were transferred to the CPPA-G in May 2015. As a regulated \nentity with a required minimum rate of return on equity of 15%, the NTDC\u2019s financial performance is \nexpected to remain stable throughout the second MFF implementation period and beyond. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n32.  ADB  conducted  the  financial  management  assessment  in  March  2018.  The  NTDC\u2019s \npremitigation risks are considered substantial, mainly due to the use of an incomplete and inaccurate \nfinancial reporting system. ADB and NTDC agreed to prepare an action plan to help the NTDC \n                                                \n19 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.

This will be provided through a strong, dedicated PMU, an FMC, and additional capacity \ndevelopment support. \n \n33.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to, and discussed \nwith, the government and the NTDC.22 The policy requirements and supplementary measures are \ndescribed in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender  \n \n34.  The updated summary of poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 10. Reliable \nand adequate electricity supply promotes business expansion, increases employment, and improves \nliving conditions, which all contribute to poverty reduction. A reliable and good-quality electricity \nsupply is necessary to meet the basic human needs in health and education. Poor and vulnerable \nconsumers, as well as public institutions such as hospitals and schools, are often particularly \ndisadvantaged by inadequate power supply, load shedding, and poor quality. Tranche 3 will help \nsolve these issues by enabling more reliable and higher quality electricity supply. Tranche 3 is \ncategorized some gender elements, as it will support the NTDC in employing at least 30% female \nstaff at its PMU and at least three women in technical positions on its BESS operation and \nmaintenance staff by 2019. \n \nE.  Safeguards  \n \n35.  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement (2009), the  project\u2019s  safeguard \ncategories are as follows.  \n \n36.  Environment (category  B). The  NTDC  has reviewed  and  updated the  environmental \nassessment and review framework of the second MFF. The NTDC has prepared IEEs for all \nsubprojects  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  the  environmental \nassessment and review framework. The key anticipated negative environmental impacts of the \nproject during construction are soil erosion, noise and fugitive dust generation, tree cutting, and \ncommunity and occupational health and safety hazards. Electromagnetic field generation is the main \nnegative  environment  impact  anticipated  during  operation.  Adequate  mitigation  measures  are \nincorporated in the project design and will be implemented through the environmental management \nplans. Those include capacity building for contractors before and during construction, and throughout \noperation. The project complies with public disclosure and consultation requirements. The NTDC \nconducted public consultations on the subprojects from July 2016 to April 2018. ADB disclosed draft \nIEEs and updated IEEs on the ADB website on 23 April 2018 and 18 May 2018. The IEEs will be \ndisclosed locally during public hearings in accordance with national legislation. The NTDC will \nestablish a project grievance redress mechanism before project implementation.  \n \n37.  Involuntary resettlement (category A) and indigenous peoples (category C). The NTDC \nwill acquire about 311 acres of private agriculture land owned by 107 families for the three new \nsubstations. The installation of about 250 km transmission lines will temporarily impact about 3,000 \nacres of cropped area and about 3,000 wood trees, owned by 598 families. The farm land is \n                                                \n21 The World Bank is supporting the implementation of an enterprise resources planning system for the NTDC. \n22 ADB. 1998.

Thus, only \nthe owners of farm land are affected, and they will be compensated for the affected crops and trees. \nOwners  will  be  compensated  for  crops  that  are  temporarily  affected  during  construction  of \ntransmission lines, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. No physical displacement \nof affected persons will occur under any subproject of Tranche 3, although 50 of 63 affected families \nnear Lahore North substation will lose 10% or more of their productive land. None of the subprojects \nwill impact communities of indigenous peoples, groups, or ethnic minorities, or interfere with their \nterritories, livelihoods, customary properties, or natural or cultural resources. \n \n38.  The land acquisition and resettlement framework of the MFF prepared under tranche 1 was \nreviewed and confirmed to remain valid for tranche 3. The NTDC prepared and endorsed three draft \nLARPs  for  new  grid  stations,  as  per  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  approved  land \nacquisition and resettlement framework. ADB disclosed the draft LARPs and revised LARPs on 23 \nApril 2018, 24 and 25 May 2018. For the grid station component, the NTDC will update the LARPs \nfollowing the notification of Section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, and this will be a condition for \ncontract award. For the transmission line components, the NTDC will update the LARPs based on \nthe approved route after the contractors conduct the check survey. ADB will approve and redisclose \nall updated or final LARPs. The NTDC will monitor the LARPs internally, while an independent \nmonitoring consultant will prepare the third-party monitoring reports and validate implementation and \npayment to affected persons. Construction works for the new grid stations will start only after ADB\u2019s \napproval of the third-party independent monitoring report validating disbursement of compensation \nto affected persons in accordance with approved LARPs and the NTDC\u2019s written confirmation of the \ncompletion of the compensation process. For transmission lines where compensation payments \nfollow the phased (construction of tower foundations, erection of towers, and stringing of conductors) \nand section-by-section implementation of the works, progress will be reflected in section-wise LARP \naddendums, internal monitoring reports and confirmed through third-party validation. The NTDC will \nprovide  section-by-section  notification  to  ADB  confirming  fair,  and  timely  completion  of  the \ncompensation, and will ensure that land is restored to its original condition after completion of works. \nThe details are in Para 41-42 of PAM (Appendix 7). ADB and NTDC will disclose all monitoring \nreports after approval by ADB. An environment and social impacts cell has been established within \nthe PMU and its safeguards management capacity is being strengthened through the FMC. \n \nF.  Climate Change Impact \n \n39.  Climate change risk is rated medium. The main risks are increases in flood levels, landslides, \nand temperatures. These risks will be mitigated through a best-practice engineering design in \ntransmission  lines  and  substations.  A  summary  of  the  climate  change  risk  assessment  and \nmanagement measures is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n40.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan (Appendix 13). Tranche 3 is categorized complex \nbecause the loan amount exceeds $200 million.  \n \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nRegulatory environment: delayed  ADB and other development partners approved the Sustainable \nprogress on policy and regulatory  Energy Sector Reform Program.
