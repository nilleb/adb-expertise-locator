Approximately 35% of the population lives \nbelow the poverty line, with 7% living in extreme poverty.   \n \nThe  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  population  of  just  over  5  million  means  a \nvery small domestic market and limited potential for economies of \nscale in industrial production. Its integration with the global market \nis constrained by its geographic location and inadequate physical \ninfrastructure. The country\u2019s two major natural resources are gold \nand  hydropower.  However,  known  gold  reserves  are  being \ndepleted without significant new discoveries being made, and the \npotential for exporting hydropower has not yet been fully realized.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\nRecipient \n\nProgram Cluster \nProposal  \n\nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nSocial Safeguards \nAssessment \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\f \n\nii \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nProgram Cluster \nDescription \n\n \nSubprogram 1  Grant \nAmount and Terms \n\n \nProgram Cluster Period \nand Tranching \n\nExecuting and \nImplementing Agencies \n\nto \n\nthe \n\nfavorable \n\ninvestment  climate \n\nis  a  cornerstone  of \n\nthe  private  sector  continues \n\nKyrgyz Republic\u2019s long-term development prospects depend on a \nmore  diversified  economy  and  a  more  vibrant  private  sector. \nHowever, \nface  a  hostile \nenvironment  characterized  by  an  inefficient  regulatory  regime, \nfinancing constraints, and infrastructure bottlenecks.  \n \nThe growth targets and development outcomes envisioned in the \nGovernment\u2019s  Country  Development  Strategy \n(CDS)  are \nambitious.  The  CDS  aims  to  achieve  an  annual  growth  rate  of \n8.5%  during  2008\u20132010.  It  aims  to  increase  per  capita  incomes \nsubstantially  and  to  reduce  the  poverty  rate  to  30%  by  2010. \nImproving \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s economic growth objectives. Accordingly, reducing \nadministrative  barriers,  creating \ntax  and  customs \nregimes,  and  strengthening  the  financial  sector  are  the  main \npriorities highlighted in the CDS.  The Program is therefore fully in \nline with Government strategy and development objectives. \n \nThe  proposed  program  cluster  aims  to  support  sustainable \neconomic  growth  and  employment  creation.  The  outcome  will  be \nan  improved  business  environment  and  investment  climate  that \ngenerates  domestic  and  foreign  investment.  The  Program  will \nhave three core policy areas:  (i) reducing entry and exit barriers \nand  compliance  costs;  (ii)  improving  access  to  finance;  and \ninfrastructure \n(iii)  promoting  private  sector  participation \nprovision. \n \nIt  is  proposed  that  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  support  the \nGovernment\u2019s policy reform program by providing a program grant \nof $12.5 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. \n \nThe  program  cluster  will  be  implemented  during  October  2007\u2013\nDecember  2011.  The  implementation  period  for  subprogram  1  is \nOctober  2007\u2013October  2008.  The  program  grant  of  $12.5  million \nwill  be  available  following  satisfaction  of  subprogram  1  policy \nactions provided the grant has become effective.  \n \nThe \nis \nNovember 2008\u2013June 2010, and for subprogram 3 it is July 2010\u2013\nDecember 2011. The indicative amounts for subprograms 2 and 3 \nwill be $20 million each. \n \nThe Ministry of Economic Development and Trade (MEDT) will be \nthe  Executing  Agency  (EA)  and  will  have  responsibility  for  the \nexecution  and  coordination  of  program  activities.  The  main \nImplementing  Agencies  (IAs)  will  be  MEDT,  Ministry  of  Finance, \nMinistry of Justice, National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic, and the \nState Customs Committee.   \n \n\nimplementation  period \n\nfor  subprogram  2 \n\ntentative \n\nin \n\n\fiii\n\nGrant Assistance  \n \n \n\nInvestment Plan; \nGrant Amount and Terms \n\nThe  Project  will  provide  system  support  for  the  Program  through \nprocurement  of  consulting  services  to  establish  a  one-stop  shop \nfor  business  registration  and  a  pre-customs  single  window, \ntogether with related hardware and software.   \n \nIt is proposed that ADB provide a grant of $2.9 million from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources.  The  Government  will  provide  financing \nof  $725,000,  mainly  in  the  form  of  taxes  and  duties,  office \naccommodation, and counterpart staff.  \n\n                                                          Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nProcurement \n \n\nSystem Support Project Financing Plan \n($ \u2018000) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank Grant \nGovernment  \nTotal \n\nTotal Cost \n2,900 \n   725 \n3,625 \n\nPercent \n80 \n20 \n\n   100          \n\nUntil 31 December 2010 \n \n30 June 2010. \n \n \nThe  project  technical  cell,  through  MEDT,  will  be  responsible  for \nprocurement  of  all  equipment  and  services  under  the  project \ncomponent. All equipment and services to be financed under the \ngrant will be procured in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nA  total  of  11  person-months  of  international  consulting  services \nand  24  person-months  of  national  consulting  services  will  be \nfinanced  by  the  project  grant.  The  consultants  will  support  the \nimplementation of the one-stop shop business registration and the \npre-customs  single  window  for  export  and  import  clearance.  The \nconsultants will be recruited on an individual basis in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended from time to time), and ADB\u2019s procedures for recruiting \nindividual consultants.   \n \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\niv \n \n\nProgram Cluster Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\nBy  supporting  the  development  of  a  dynamic  private  sector,  the \nprogram  cluster  will  promote  broad-based  and  sustainable \neconomic  growth,  which  will  help  address  the  problems  of \nunemployment and poverty in Kyrgyz Republic. \n \n\nAdministrative  barriers  in  the  form  of  inefficient \nregulation  and  excessive  government  intervention \nand  red  tape  translate  into  direct  costs  as  well  as \nuncertainty,  thereby  deterring  private  investment.  \nBy \nreducing  business  entry  and  exit  and \ncompliance  costs,  the  Program  will  help  promote \ninvestment and growth. The recourse mechanisms \nproposed  under  the  Program  will  further  reduce \nrisks and boost business confidence.  \n\nMeasures  to  strengthen  enforcement  of  financial \ncontracts  and  credit  information  sharing  among \nfinancial institutions will be fundamental to reducing \ncredit  risk  and  promoting  long-term  funds  for \ninvestment.  The  Program  will  also  support \ndevelopment  of  leasing  as  a  way  of  expanding \nfinance in capital equipment. \n\nin \n\nin \n\nframework \n\ninfrastructure.  The \nthe  quality  of \n\nThe  enabling \nfor  public\u2013private \npartnerships  (PPPs)  will  help  attract  private  sector \nresulting \ninvestment \nimprovement \ninfrastructure \nservices  will  significantly  reduce  the  cost  of  doing \nbusiness.    It  will  also  bring  about  additional  direct \nand indirect benefits.  Infrastructure investment will \ndirectly  generate  employment  and \nimprove \nincomes.  Private  investment  in  infrastructure  will \ncreate fiscal space by reducing the need for public \nspending in infrastructure.  To the extent that this is \nchanneled  toward  social  spending,  PPPs  can  also \nindirectly help improve overall social welfare. \n\ninterference  and \n\nThere  are  two  additional  channels  through  which \nthe  Program  will  help  improve  the  country\u2019s  fiscal \nsituation  over  the  medium  to  long  term.  Less \ntape  will \ngovernment \nencourage  many  businesses  that  are  currently \noperating informally to come into the formal sector. \nThis  will  generate  additional  tax  revenues.    More \ngenerally, more private sector activity will enhance \ntax \nthereby  enabling  development \nexpenditures. \n\nrevenues, \n\nred \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fv\n\nThe program cluster faces three main risks.  \n \nLimited  Interagency  Coordination.  Investment climate reforms \ncut  across  various  subsectors,  and  require  close  coordination \namong relevant government agencies. The Program involves five \nIAs  and  lack  of  coordination  among  them  is  a  potential  risk.  The \nimplementation  arrangements  are  designed  to  ensure  effective \ncoordination  at  a  high  level  for  overall  policy  guidance,  at  a \nworking  level  for  day-to-day  implementation  matters,  and  at  a \ntechnical  level.  The  involvement  of  the  Investment  Council\u2014a \nhigh  level  forum  chaired  by  the  President  and  with  the  explicit \nmandate  to  coordinate  reforms\u2014will  also  facilitate  interagency \ncoordination.  Moreover,  ADB  is  currently  working  with  two  IAs  in \nthe context of other ongoing projects (Banking Reform and Capital \nMarket  Development  and  Customs  Modernization  and \nInfrastructure Development). This will further facilitate interagency \ncoordination.  \n \nWeak  Implementation  Capacity  and  High  Staff  Turnover. \nAnother potential risks is weaknesses in implementation capacity \nand  high  staff  turnover,  especially  in  MEDT,  which  is  a  relatively \nnew  ministry.  To  mitigate  this  risk,  the  attached  TA  places  a \nstrong emphasis on capacity building and training.  MEDT\u2019s ability \nto attract and retain qualified staff is also increasing gradually as \nits  profile  as  the  lead  agency  for  economic  planning  and  private \nsector  development  has  increased  in  recent  years.  In  addition,  a \nrecently  approved  World  Bank  TA  focuses  on  strengthening \nMEDT  capacity  by  improving  human  resource  management  and \ndeveloping comprehensive training curricula for MEDT staff. \n\nUnforeseen  Changes  in  Circumstances.  The  issues  to  be \naddressed  under  the  Program  are  mostly  structural  and  hence \nunlikely to change in the short term. However, the specific set of \ninstitutional solutions and mechanisms may need to be adapted to \nchanges  in  circumstances  (e.g.  new  parallel  and  related  laws \ncoming  into  effect  and  related  institutional  changes).  This  may \nrequire  different  solutions  to  the  original  problem.  The  proposed \ncluster  approach  will  help  mitigate  these  risks,  as  it  allows  for  a \nreassessment  of  the  way  forward  at  each  processing  stage  of \nsubsequent subprograms.  \n \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nvi \n \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\nThe  objective  of  the  TA  is  to  support  effective  implementation  of \nthe  program  cluster.  Specifically,  the  TA  will  help  ensure  timely \nachievement  of  the  policy  actions  envisioned  for  subprogram  2 \nthrough  technical  inputs  and  through  stakeholder  consultations \nand public awareness activities to build consensus on the reform \nagenda.   \n \nThe  estimated  cost  of  the  TA  is  $750,000,  of  which  ADB  will \nsupport $600,000 as a grant from its TA funding program.  The TA \nwill engage 20 person-months of international consultants and 24 \nperson-months  of  national  consultants\u2019  services.  All  international \nand national consultants will be engaged on an individual basis in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time), and ADB\u2019s procedures for \nrecruiting individual consultants. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on:  (i)  a  proposed \nprogram  cluster  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  for  the  Investment  Climate  Improvement  Program \n(Program),  comprising  three  subprograms;  (ii)  a  proposed  grant  for  subprogram  1  of  the \nProgram; and (iii) a proposed grant to provide system support for the Program. The report also \ndescribes a proposed technical assistance (TA) grant for Implementation Support for Investment \nClimate  Reform.  If  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  program  and  grants,  I,  acting  under  the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\nA. \n\nRecent Macroeconomic Developments  \n\nFigure 1: Contributions to Growth (Supply) \n\n2. \nThe  Kyrgyz  economy  grew  at  an  annual  rate  of  4.7%  during  1996\u20132005,  and  had \nreached  approximately  80%  of  its  pre-transition  levels  by  2005.  The  political  turmoil  following \nthe  2005  Tulip  Revolution  and  a  major  gold  mining  accident1 in  2006  adversely  affected  the \neconomy,  and  real  gross  domestic product  (GDP)  growth  rate  in  2005 was  \u20130.2  %.  In  2006 it \nwas 3.1%.   \n \nOwing  largely  to  a  strong  performance  in  services  (especially  communications)  and \n3. \nconstruction,  the  economy  rebounded  strongly  in  2007  and  grew  by  8.2%.  Services  grew  by \n12.4%,  contributing  two-thirds  of  GDP  growth,  and  industry  grew  by  9.3%,  driven  largely  by \nexpansion  in  construction  activity.  Construction  and  trading  have  been  fueled  by  significant \nincreases  in  household  demand,  funded  by  remittances,  mainly  from  the  Russian  Federation \nand Kazakhstan. Agriculture, which suffers from weak productivity, grew by 1.5% (Figure 1). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook 2008. \n\nTrade and \nDomestic Services \n\nIndustry \n-Construction \n\nIndustry \n-Other \n\nIndustry\n-Gold\n\n \ne\ng\na\nt\nn\ne\nc\nr\ne\nP\n\nAgriculture \n\nYear \n\nGDP\n\n2007 \n\n2003 \n\n10.0 \n\n2006\n\n2005\n\n2004\n\n-2.0 \n\n-6.0 \n\n-4.0 \n\n2.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n4.0 \n\n6.0 \n\n8.0 \n\n                                                 \n1 The accident occurred in the Kumtor gold mine, the largest single contributor to growth. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n2 \n \n\nMonetary  policy  was  expansionary  through  much  of  2006  and  2007,  with  the  National \n4. \nBank  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  (NBKR)  resisting  upward  pressure  on  the  Kyrgyz  Som  through \nlarge foreign exchange purchases. On the fiscal side, significant progress in revenue collection \nhas been made over the last few years. With higher receipts from value-added taxes (VAT) and \ncustoms  duties,  the  overall  fiscal  deficit  fell  to  0.7%  of  GDP,  down  from  2.5%  in  2006.  Public \ndebt  (largely  external)  levels  have  continued  to  decrease  during  the  past  few  years  as  the \nauthorities refrained from external borrowing or guaranteeing external loans on nonconcessional \nterms. Debt reduction was also aided by the rescheduling that took place under the Paris Club \numbrella. Total external debt declined to 61% in 2007 from over 100% in 2003. \n \nB. \n\nNear-Term Prospects \n\nThe  recent  deterioration  in  international  economic  conditions  has  brought  new \n5. \nmacroeconomic  challenges  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  The  economic  slowdown  in  neighboring \nKazakhstan, in particular, will have important implications since Kazakhstan is one of the Kyrgyz \nRepublic\u2019s main trading partners and sources of foreign direct investment. While the contagion \neffect from the Kazakh banking sector appears to have been limited thus far, it may grow, given \nthe  strong  presence  of  Kazakh-owned  banks  in  Kyrgyz  Republic.  The  sharp  decline  in \nconstruction activity in Kazakhstan has reduced the flow of remittances to the Kyrgyz Republic \n(a  major  source  of  balance  of  payments  inflows)  as  this  sector  employs  thousands  of  Kyrgyz \nnationals.  Largely  as  a  result  of  these  spillover  effects  from  Kazakhstan,  economic  growth \n(excluding gold production) is expected to slow to 5% in 2008. \n \n6. \nMoreover,  the  escalation  in  food  and  fuel  prices  since  late  2007  has  put  pressures  on \nthe  authorities  for  policy  responses  that  have  diverse  fiscal  and  monetary  implications. \nFundamentally,  the  authorities  face  tough  trade-offs  between  competing  macroeconomic \nobjectives.  With  bank  reserves  and  broad  money  already  growing  and  significant  increases  in \ncurrent public expenditures (salary increases of 30% and sizable increases in pension benefits) \nin  the  recent  past,  it  will  be  a  challenge  to  keep  inflation  under  control  and  at  the  same  time \nprovide  safety  nets  to  the  population  most  affected  by  this  shock.  Concerns  have  been \nexpressed that the current spike in imported inflation may become entrenched. The Government \nhas  accordingly  signaled  its  intention  to  tighten  monetary  policy,  and  to  reduce  nonpriority \ncurrent expenditures to enable discretionary spending to mitigate poverty impacts from the food \nand fuel crises.  \n \n7. \n To cushion the impact of the price shocks on low-income households, the Government \nrecently  increased  cash  transfers  under  the  unified  monthly  benefit  scheme  by  Som35  (from \nSom125)  per  beneficiary.2 The  Government  has  budgeted  an  additional  Som650  million  ($19 \nmillion)  for  a  variety  of  in-kind  support,  including  for  the  purchase  of  farm  equipment  and \nfertilizers  and  for  subsidized  wheat  for  low-income  households.  The  Government  has  also \nannounced  a  Som100  million  loan  to  Ailbank  (Agriculture  Bank)  for  onlending  to  farmers  at \nbelow-market interest rates.    \n \n8. \nIn addition, the authorities anticipate the need to step-up budget-funded imports of fuel \nduring the coming winter months significantly because of the critically low levels of water in the \nmain  hydropower  generation  reservoir.  As  a  result,  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF) \n\n                                                 \n2   This scheme is based on an assessment of the level of farm and nonfarm income of each household benchmarked \nagainst a \u201cguaranteed minimum consumption level\u201d. There are currently approximately 400,000 beneficiaries of this \nscheme.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3\n\nestimates that the cost of food and fuel imports in 2008 will be $350 million higher than in 2007. \nAccordingly, IMF projects the current account deficit will deteriorate to 4.4% of GDP in 2008. \n \n9. \nThe Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s near-term economic prospects have therefore become markedly \nmore  uncertain  since  late  2007.  The  authorities  face  two  immediate  challenges:  (i)  securing \nfinancial resources and implementing effective and well-targeted safety net measures to protect \nthose  worst  affected  by  the  food  and  fuel  crises;3 and  (ii)  formulating  appropriate  fiscal  and \nmonetary  policies  in  view  of  the  trade-offs  highlighted  above.  Effective  management  of  these \nchallenges  will  be  crucial  for  ensuring  macroeconomic  stability  as  well  as  for  maintaining \nmomentum for reforms to improve the investment climate. \n \n10. \nSelected  economic  indicators  are  provided  in  Table  1.

With  an  annual  per  capita  income  of \nabout $700, Kyrgyz Republic is one of the poorest countries in Central Asia. Approximately 35% \nof the population lives below the poverty line, and 7% in extreme poverty. Progress toward the \nMillennium  Development  Goals  has  been  mixed,  and  many  of  the  targets  are  unlikely  to  be \nachieved if the country continues on its current path.   \n \n12. \nA  narrow  economic  base  and  reliance  on  a  few  sectors  are  the  root  development \nchallenges. In particular, economic growth in recent years has been driven primarily by the gold \nindustry, and is therefore highly vulnerable to external shocks. Moreover, known gold reserves \nare  being  depleted  without  significant  new  discoveries  being  made.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic  has \nsignificant  hydropower  resources,  but  the  potential  for  hydropower  exports  has  not  yet  been \nrealized  because  of  a  lack  of  investment  and  regional  issues  related  to  water  usage  and  its \nnexus to energy. Manufacturing represents only 13% of GDP, and aside from a recently growing \ntextile and fabrics sector, this sector\u2019s employment generation record has been poor.   \n \n13. \nCurrently, minerals and precious and semi-precious metals account for over 50% of total \nexports,  followed  by  textiles  (11%),  vegetables  and  prepared  foodstuff  (12%),  machinery  and \nelectrical parts (7%), and glass and ceramics (6%).

Integration  with  regional  and  global  markets  is \ntherefore essential if the country is to achieve economies of scale in production. This in turn is \ncontingent  upon  the  ability  to  diversify  the  economy  and  export  structure.  International \nintegration  is  both  (i)  an  outcome  of  an  \u201cinvestment  climate\u201d  that  enables  the  creation  of  a \nvibrant  private  sector  with  access  to  quality  infrastructure  services  and  finance,  and  with \ncapacity  to  venture  into  new  business  and  export  markets;  and  (ii)  a  major  enabler  of  the \ninternal  diversification  of  the  economy,  which  itself  allows  for  knowledge  spillovers  that  will \ntrigger new activities, and economies of scale to improve productivity and cost-competitiveness.   \n \nTaking better advantage of the country\u2019s natural resources as well as expanding growth \n15. \npotential  in  the  nonresource  sector  will  require  significant  improvements  in  the  business \nenvironment  and  investment  climate.  Existing  and  potential  investors  face  a  hostile  business \nenvironment  characterized  by  an  inefficient  and  opaque  regulatory  regime  and  excessive  red \ntape  and  state  intervention.  Businesses,  especially  small-  and  medium-sized  enterprises,  also \ncontinue  to  face  financing  constraints  as  a  result  of  fundamental  weaknesses  in  the \nenforcement  of  financial  contracts  and  credit  information  sharing  (CIS)  mechanisms,  which \nincrease credit risk and the cost of borrowing. \n \n16. \nInfrastructure  bottlenecks  further  increase  the  cost  of  doing  business.  Transport  costs \nare  high  because  of  the  country\u2019s  mountainous  terrain  and  the  poor  quality  of  the  transport \nnetwork. Problems in the energy sector lead to frequent interruptions in power supply, disrupting \nbusiness  operations.  The  poor  quality  of  infrastructure  has  especially  hurt  the  manufacturing \nsector, which tends to use transport services and electricity more intensively than other sectors.  \n \nIn 2007, the Doing Business5 report ranked the Kyrgyz Republic 94 out of 178 countries \n17. \nfor \u201cease of doing business\u201d, down from 88 in the previous year. The Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s ranking \nin 2008 has improved to 68, largely reflecting recent policy announcements and legal reforms to \nsimplify business registration and the permit system for construction. While this is a step in the \n                                                 \n5  World Bank. 2008. Doing Business 2008. Washington DC. The survey ranks economies based on 10 indicators of \nbusiness  regulation  that  tracks  the  time  and  costs  to  meet  government  requirements.  The  indicators  include: \nstarting  a  business,  dealing  with  permits,  employing  workers,  registering  property,  getting  credit,  protecting \ninvestors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts, and closing a business. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n6 \n \n\nright direction, private sector development and sustainable growth and employment creation will \nrequire further reforms to put in place the institutional setting, incentive structures, and systems \nand  procedures  necessary  for  effective  implementation  and  enforcement.

Business  start-up  procedures  are  onerous,  and  the outcome  is \nunpredictable  because  of  lack  of  transparency  and  the  discretion  enjoyed  by  the  approving \nauthorities.  Businesses  register  by  submitting  documents  (application  form,  company  charter \nand founder\u2019s agreement) at the State Registration Department of the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) \nor  other  Justice  Administrations  in  Bishkek  city,  Osh  city,  and  the  seven  oblast  (province) \ncenters.  Businesses  also  need  to  visit  and  register  at  the  State  Committee  for  Taxes  and \nCollection,  the  Social  Fund,  and  the  National  Statistical  Committee.  MOJ  then  conducts  a \nsubstantive review of registration documents to assess their compliance with a number of laws \nand regulations (e.g., the Civil Code and the Law on Registration of Legal Entities). This review \nprocess  is  a  major  bottleneck,  causing  considerable  delay,  and  is  a  significant  drain  on  MOJ \nresources.  \n \n19. \nThe Civil Code and other legislation govern how companies can be liquidated. However, \nthere  is  no  easy  or  quick  means  to  liquidate  or  remove  from  the  register  a  company  which  is \nsimply  inactive.  Several  thousand  of  the  40,000  registered  companies  are  believed  to  be \ndormant. This causes difficulties for the tax authorities and other regulatory bodies, as well as \nfor  entrepreneurs  who  may  themselves  wish  to  liquidate  their  companies  but  are  discouraged \nfrom doing so because of the time and complexity of the procedures. If exit from a business is \ndifficult and implies open-ended tax liabilities, establishing a formal business becomes a riskier \nproposition. \n \n20. \nThe  proliferation  of  inspections  and  related  fees  and  fines  disrupt  business  operations \nand  add  significantly  to  the  regulatory  burden.  Although  the  list  of  broad  activities  subject  to \nlicensing  has  been  reduced  through  amendments  to  the  Law  on  Licensing,  further  legal  and \nregulatory changes are needed to reduce the number of existing licenses and permits, and to \nprevent their future proliferation. \n \n21.  While  ongoing  reforms  have  helped  streamline  and  modernize  custom  procedures, \nbusinesses continue to face significant barriers arising from inconsistent regulations, and lack of \nstandardized documents and coordination among the relevant agencies (such as the ministries \nof health, agriculture, transport and other certification bodies). Exporters and importers have to \nsubmit at least 12 documents to various agencies just at the pre-customs stage. Movement of \ngoods is further hampered by high transit and transport costs, both formal and informal.   \n \n22. \nthrough legal, institutional, regulatory, and administrative reforms. \n \n\nThere  is,  therefore,  an  urgent  need  to  reduce  administrative  barriers  and  red  tape \n\n2. \n\nInefficiencies in Financial Intermediation  \n\n23. \nSignificant  progress  has  been  made  in  restoring  confidence  in  the  financial  sector \nfollowing  the  destabilizing  impact  of  the  1998  Russian  crisis.  Key  achievements  include  legal \nreforms  to  strengthen  bank  regulation  and  supervision,  improved  enforcement  of  bank \ngovernance  and  disclosure  rules,  and  stronger  procedures  for  bank  resolution.  The  Asian \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n8 \n \n\nthat  constrain \n\nthere  are  remaining \n\ninstitutions\u2019  confidence \n\nthe  enforcement  of  contracts \n\ninstitutional  weaknesses \nin \n\nDevelopment  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  ongoing  Banking  and  Capital  Market  Development  Program6 is \nsupporting  further  strengthening  of  banking  regulations  and  risk  management  policies  and \nprocedures. The Government has also recently approved the introduction of a deposit insurance \nscheme,  which  will  help  improve  confidence  in  the  banking  system  and  support  deposit \nmobilization.  \n \nfinancial \n24. \nHowever, \nintermediation.  Financial \nis \nfundamentally constrained by (i) the uncertain and ineffective legal framework for enforcement \nof  financial  contracts;  and  (ii)  the  incomplete  institutional  framework  for  warning  credit \ninstitutions against, and for establishing priority over, competing pledges on the same collateral. \nCombined, these problems generate a vicious circle in which high credit risk leads to financial \ninstitutions demanding high premiums over benchmark interest rates, and higher rates leading \nto  riskier  credit  loans  and  leases)  portfolios  and  ultimately  credit  rationing.7 This  reduces  the \navailability of funds for entrepreneurs, especially long-term funds for capital investment. \n \nIneffective  Secured  Lending  Framework.  Although  the  Law  on  Pledges  gives \n25. \nsubstantial rights to pledge holders, extrajudicial processes to enforce repossession of security \nin  financial  contracts  are  uncertain  and  ineffective  when  the  pledge  giver  simply  refuses  to \nrecognize the rights of the pledge holder. As a result, parties still turn to the courts in order to \nenforce pledges. However, courts in the Kyrgyz Republic do not always function impartially or \nefficiently. Creditors are, therefore, invariably subject to long and costly judicial processes. \n \n26. \nFurther legal shortcomings reduce the market value of assets offered as collateral. For \nexample,  the  lack  of  correspondence  between  the  Law  on  Pledges  and  the  Law  on  Licensing \nlimits the value of operating licenses offered as security (as the license is quickly revoked by the \nauthorities  upon  foreclosure).  Also,  provisions  in  the  Law  on  Pledges  and  in  the  Civil  Code \nrequire  that  all  pledge  contracts  must  contain  an  explicit  valuation  of  assets,  which  should  be \nthe  basis  for  the  starting  prices  in  auctions  for  all  repossessed  assets.  A  creditor\u2019s  right  to \nundertake a free auction is thus limited, and this significantly impairs lending. \n \n27. \nConditions for Leasing Development.  Leasing has the potential to overcome some of \nthe weaknesses outlined above. The fundamental advantage of a lease agreement  is that the \nfinancing made available by the credit institution is linked to the purchase of a specific piece of \nequipment (a movable asset), ownership of which remains with the lessor (the credit institution). \nAs  enforcing  ownership  rights  under  a  lease  agreement  is  in  most  circumstances  easier  than \nenforcing  creditors\u2019  rights  under  loan  contracts,  leasing  has  a  significant  potential  as  a  way  of \nexpanding financing capital investment in the Kyrgyz Republic. \n  \n28. \nHowever, leasing activity is still negligible, mostly because of (i) uncertain norms for tax \nand accounting treatment for both lessors and lessees, and (ii) lack of awareness of rights and \nobligations of lessors and lessees under different lease agreements. Given the current low level \nof  leasing  activity,  the  enforcement  mechanisms  for  lease  contracts  have  hardly  been  tested.  \nThe current practice of including provisions in lease agreements for dispute resolution through \ncommercial arbitration is questionable, and will probably not circumvent the problems of judicial \nenforcement. This is because commercial arbitration in the Kyrgyz Republic is ineffective, and, \n                                                 \n6   ADB. 2005. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Program Loan \nand  Technical  Assistance  Grant  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  for  the  Banking  Sector  and  Capital  Market  Development \nProgram. Manila (Loan 2224, approved on 20 December 2005). \n\n7   As a result, these problems get factored in by banks in the form of very high average interest rates to clients, so \n\nthat the pay-back period is short enough to compensate for the higher average portfolio risk. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\nas  with  loans,  lessors  currently  have  no  effective  extrajudicial  means  of  enforcing  their  rights. \nFinancial  contracts  require  specific  solutions  to  improve  the  enforceability  of  commercial \narbitration decisions.  \n \nFinally,  when  it  comes  to  the  origination  of  loans  and  leases,  credit  institutions  are \n29. \nexposed  to  the  possibility  of  a  movable  asset  financed  through  a  lease  agreement  in  effect \nbeing presented as collateral in a loan application to a bank, without the bank knowing about the \ncompeting  right  (the  lease  agreement).  If  there  is  more  leasing,  the  credit  risk  in  the  banking \nsector  caused  by  this  loophole  may  increase  as  there  is  currently  no  obligation  to  file  lease \nagreements with the Central Pledge Office. This must be addressed as a matter of priority.  \n \n30. \nIn  addition  to  the  issues  highlighted  above,  which  heighten  credit  risks,  there  are  not \nenough  reporting  mechanisms  and  practices  to  enable  credit  institutions  to  unveil  the  specific \nrisk  profiles  of  individual  credit  applicants.  This  leads  to  (i)  very  little  pricing  differentiation \namong  borrowers  or  lessees,  (ii)  high  risk  aversion  and  over-reliance  on  collateral,  and  \n(iii) segmentation of the credit market (relationship lending). In consequence, credit institutions \nbear high credit appraisal costs and end up setting loan amount thresholds for their operations, \nbelow  which  no  applications  are  considered.  These  information  problems  are  a  source  of \ninefficiency  in  the  allocation  of  deposits  mobilized  in  the  Kyrgyz  economy.  Fundamentally,  the \npotential  profitability  of  proposed  new  projects  will  not  matter,  in  these  circumstances,  in  the \ncredit decision. \n \n31. \nIneffective  Credit  Information  Sharing  Mechanisms.  The  current  Credit  Information \nBureau (CIB) has been in existence for 5 years.  It is funded by membership and search fees \npaid  by  participating  financial  institutions.  NBKR  currently  has  no  part  in  it.  According  to  the \nDoing Business report, the CIB\u2019s coverage in 2007 was a mere 1.6% of the adult population\u2013\nsignificantly  below  the  average  of  15.4%  for  Central  Asia,  and  even  further  below  the  OECD \naverage  of  59.3%.  The  effectiveness  of  the  current  CIB  is  fundamentally  constrained  in  two \nways:  (i) uncertainty about its legal framework  is a source of legal risk to participating banks; \nand  (ii)  its  self-regulatory  model,  at  this  early  stage  of  banking  development,  cannot  address \nissues of enforcement of the reporting rules agreed upon in the CIB membership agreements.  \n \nTo reduce legal risks to its members, the CIB urgently needs to be supported by a clear \n32. \nlegal  framework.  This  will  require  changes  to  the  Civil  Code  and  to  the  Law  on  Banking. \nCurrently, the Civil Code does not include a legal mechanism to enable a borrower\u2019s information \nto  be  shared  among  banks,  or  for  specialized  legislation  to  govern  CIS  mechanisms  and \nsafeguard  financial  privacy.  The  stakeholders  also  have  to  reach  a  consensus  on  the  overall \ninstitutional  and  legal  architecture  that  best  minimizes  the  legal  risks  of  positive  information \nsharing.  The  consensus  building  effort  and  the  assessment  of  different  technical  and \ninstitutional options is yet to be initiated.  \n \n33. \nThe  CIB  system  is  generally  not  automatically  integrated  with  the  management \ninformation  systems  of  participating  banks.  Thus,  the  daily  reporting  requirements  impose  a \nheavy burden on a bank\u2019s operations, as information about borrowers is entered manually. The \nequivalent cost of this burden, in terms of the number of bank employees set aside for this task, \nis proportional to the market share of each bank. On the other hand, the perceived benefits of \nthe CIB to the participating bank are inversely proportional to its market share. This cost\u2013benefit \nasymmetry  has  an  impact  on  the  reporting  compliance  of  each  bank,  and  the  CIB  is  currently \nperceived by a number of banks as incomplete and ineffective in many ways.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n10 \n \n\n3. \n\nLow Investment in Infrastructure and Utilities \n\n34. \nState  ownership  is  dominant  in  what  the  authorities  define  as  \u201cstrategic  assets\u201d,  which \ninclude  almost  all  infrastructure.  Inadequate  resources  for  rehabilitation,  maintenance  and \noperation  have  resulted  in  a  serious  deterioration  in  many  infrastructure  assets  and  services.  \nFor  example,  road  transport  accounts  for  about  95%  of  movement  of  goods  and  people,  but \nbecause  of  past  neglect  of  routine  and  preventive  maintenance,  the  roads  are  in  a  distressed \nstate. This translates into high freight transport costs that in turn increase overall production and \nmarketing costs. Frequent interruptions in power supply also impose significant costs, especially \non smaller businesses. This has been exacerbated by the heavy rationing of electricity in recent \nmonths resulting from the low water levels of the main hydropower reservoirs and the reduced \noutput  of  the  main  thermal  power  plant.  Effective  infrastructure  services,  particularly  in  the \nenergy  and  transport  sectors,  are  key  to  the  expansion  of  the  economy\u2019s  productive  capacity. \nWithout  adequate  maintenance  and  new  investments  in  infrastructure,  economic  growth  will \ncontinue to be constrained by power outages, traffic congestion, high transport costs, and other \ninfrastructure bottlenecks.  \n \n35. \nAs outlined in the Government\u2019s Country Development Strategy (CDS) 2007\u20132010, the \nKyrgyz  Republic  has  significant  infrastructure  and  utilities  investment  needs.  Specifically, \ninfrastructure spending needs to be boosted from the current 3\u20134% of GDP to at least 6%. This \ncannot be done from the government budget and external aid alone. \n \n36. \nThe  Government  is  committed  to  creating  a  conducive  environment  for  private  sector \nparticipation  and  public\u2013private  partnerships  (PPPs) 8  for  commercially  viable  infrastructure \nprojects.  However, the legal, regulatory and institutional framework for PPPs is incomplete. For \ninstance,  the  Concession  Law,  1992  only  covers  concessions  and  does  not  specify  other \ncontractual  arrangements  suitable  for  PPPs.  Other  important  gaps  include:  (i)  the  absence  of \nprocedures and  criteria for  concessionaire  selection,  (ii)  the lack  of  a  general  clause  for  tariffs \nand tariff adjustments in concessionaire agreements, and (iii) ambiguity about the availability of \ngovernment support and financial guarantees. There is a need to strengthen both cross-sectoral \nand sector-specific laws and regulations. The fact that only one concession\u2014for a gold mine\u2014\nhas been awarded since 1992 may be at least partly attributable to these weaknesses. \n \n37. \nA conducive environment for PPPs also requires an effective institutional framework to \nensure  a  consistent  approach  to  private  sector  participation  across  sectors.  Adequate  risk \nmitigation and fair risk-sharing mechanisms between the public and private sectors are essential. \nLikewise,  there  is  a  need  to  develop  effective  mechanisms  and  build  capacity  for  project \npreparation and for transparent and competitive selection of private sector partners.  \n \n38. \nPrivate  investors  will  participate  in  infrastructure  development  only  if  they  can  fully \nrecover  their  costs  and  earn  an  adequate  rate  of  return.  Current  tariff  levels  in  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic  are  low  because  of  the  legacy  of  the  centrally  planned  economy  when  infrastructure \n                                                 \n8   PPPs  are  long-term  contractual  arrangements  between  the  public  sector  and  a  private  sector  company  for  the \nprovision  of  an  infrastructure  service.  PPPs  frequently  involve  complementary  investments  and/or  services.  An \nexample  is  private  investments  in  power  generation  that  are  complemented  by  public  investments  in  power \ntransmission and distribution. Another example from the energy sector is the involvement of a strategic investor in \nthe  construction  and  operation  of  a  gas  transmission  project  undertaken  by  the  state  gas  corporation.  In  the \ntransport  sector,  the  public  sector  can  either  implement  a  network  of  feeder  roads  to  supplement  a  privately \nfinanced  and  operated  toll  road,  or  provide  the  land  required  for  the  toll  road.  In  airports,  the  public  sector  can \nprovide  airside  facilities  such  as  runways  and  aprons,  while  private  investors  focus  on  landside  facilities  such  as \nterminals and their operation. PPPs for ports can consist of the public sector providing the port infrastructure and \nthe private investor being awarded a concession for port operation. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11\n\nservices were provided at a low or no cost, with tariffs bearing no relationship to the actual cost \nof supply.  \n \nB. \n\nGovernment Strategy \n\nThe  growth  targets  and  development  outcomes  envisioned  in  the  CDS  are  ambitious.   \n\n39. \nThe  Government\u2019s  medium-term  development  goals  and  strategy  are  outlined  in  the \nCDS.  The  CDS  was  prepared  through  extensive  stakeholder  consultations,  and  builds  on  the \nstrategy laid out in the National Poverty Reduction Strategy 2003\u20132005. The CDS focuses on \nfour  strategic  pillars\u2014enhancing  economic  potential,  combating  corruption,  accelerating  social \ndevelopment, and promoting environmental sustainability.     \n \n40. \nThe  CDS  aims  to  achieve  an  annual  growth  rate  of  8.5%  during  2008\u20132010.  Over  the  same \nperiod,  it  aims  to  increase  per  capita  income  substantially,  to  reduce  the  poverty  rate  to  30%, \nand to increase private investment from 17% of GDP to 35%. Improving the investment climate \nby  reducing  administrative  barriers,  creating  favorable  tax  and  customs  regimes,  and \nstrengthening the financial sector is therefore one of the main CDS priorities. A key milestone \nwas the March 2007 enactment of the Law on Inspections which aims to protect entrepreneurs \nfrom  legal  ambiguities  and  unjustifiable  inspections  and  fines.  The  Government  has  also \nembarked  on  an  ambitious  program  to  streamline  the  licensing  regime,  and  has  approved  a \nregulatory impact assessment (RIA) method to assess the justification for existing licenses and \npermits and the criteria for issuing new ones. A presidential decree and government resolutions \naimed  at  rationalizing  export  and  import  clearance  procedures  through  the  establishment  of  a \nsingle electronic window have recently been issued. The Government has also adopted a new \ntax  code  to  reduce  the  tax  burden  on  enterprises,  streamline  tax  regulations,  and  simplify \nprocedures. The new code will be effective in January 2009. \n \nC. \n\nADB Operations and Lessons Learned \n\n41. \nSupporting economic growth and poverty reduction through private sector development \nhas been an important theme of ADB strategy and operations in Kyrgyz Republic. The country \nstrategy and program for 2004\u201320069 concluded that the public investment-led growth of 1996\u2013\n2001 financed primarily by external resources was no longer sustainable, and proposed a new \nfocus on interventions to support private investments and promote exports. During the country \nstrategy  and  program  period,  ADB  supported  agricultural  reforms  to  enhance  productivity  and \nexportability,  financial  reforms  to  stimulate  savings  and  investments,  and  investments  in  trade \nand transport infrastructure to improve access to regional markets for exports.  \n \nThe Joint Country Support Strategy (JCSS) 2007\u2013201010 aims to achieve full alignment \n42. \nwith  the  CDS  and  interventions  that  yielded  tangible  development  outcomes.  Private  sector \ndevelopment  was  a  priority  of  the  JCSS,  in  particular  (i)  support  to  improve  the  business \nenvironment  and  investment  climate,  (ii)  capacity  building  to  formulate  and  implement  market-\noriented policies, and (iii) an assessment of the opportunities for private sector operations. \n \nRelevant lessons learned have been incorporated in the program design. A key lesson \n43. \nthat  emerged  during  JCSS  preparation  is  that  the  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  development  partners  in \nthe past had underestimated the weaknesses in implementation capacity, which in turn led them \n\n                                                 \n9   ADB. 2003. County Strategy and Program (2004\u20132006): Kyrgyz Republic. Manila. \n10 The  JCSS  was  prepared  by  ADB  together  with  the  Department  for  International  Development  of  the  United \n\nKingdom, Swiss Cooperation, United Nations agencies and the World Bank Group. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n12 \n \n\nto overestimate the depth of reforms undertaken. This Program and the attached TA emphasize \nimplementation and sustainability, not only through training and public awareness, but also by \nputting in place appropriate institutions (such as the one-stop-shop and single electronic window) \nand  recourse  mechanisms  and  accountability  requirements.  In  addition,  under  the  proposed \ncluster modality, while the reform directions are laid out, each subprogram will be approved only \nwhen  the  relevant  prior  actions  have  been  completed.  By  effectively  integrating  program \nprocessing  and  implementation,  this  approach  will  help  reduce  the  \u201cimplementation  gap\u201d  that \nhas undermined project effectiveness in the past. \n  \n44. \nADB  experience  has  shown  that  in-depth  analysis  to  identify  underlying  problems  is \nessential  for  program  success.  This  is  particularly  important  for  cross-cutting  programs  where \nthe distinction between root causes and effects can be blurred. The design of this Program has \nbenefited  from  a  comprehensive  2007  private  sector  study  that  covered  the  overall  legal, \nregulatory, policy and institutional aspects, as well as sector-specific constraints.11 The program \npreparatory  technical  assistance  approved  in  March  2008 12  carried  out  a  more  focused \nassessment  of  the  most  binding  constraints  and  appropriate  short-,  medium-,  and  long-term \nactions. \n45. \nAnother important lesson is that long-term engagement and commitment on the part of \ndevelopment partners is critical to real change and the proposed Program builds on a number of \npast and ongoing projects. For instance, the Second Phase of the Corporate Governance and \nEnterprise Reform Program13 helped develop the Law on Pledges and the legal framework for \nout-of-court  commercial  dispute  resolution.  This  Program  will  help  further  these  reforms  by \nestablishing  implementation  arrangements  and  enforcement  mechanisms.  Likewise,  measures \nto improve access to finance will build on the achievements of the Financial Intermediation and \nResource  Mobilization  Program14 and  the  ongoing  Banking  and  Capital  Market  Development \nProgram  (footnote  6),  which  helped  to  put  in  place  the  legal,  regulatory  and  supervisory \nframework  for  the  banking  and  nonbanking  financial  sectors.  ADB  is  also  currently  providing \nassistance to modernize customs and tax administration.15 There are strong synergies between \nthese two projects and the proposed Program. \n \n46. \nThe  2007  special  evaluation  study by  ADB\u2019s  Operations  Evaluation  Department  (OED) \nprovides  valuable  information  on  private  sector  development  trends,  foreign  investment \npromotion, and private sector participation in infrastructure. One of the main conclusions of the \nstudy  is  that  developing  member  countries  are  increasingly  seeking  ADB  support  to  build  the \nenabling  environment  for  the  private  sector  (including  rule  of  law,  access  to  finance,  and  an \n\n                                                 \n11 ADB.  2007.

In the area \nof  investment  climate,  ADB  has  coordinated  closely  with  the  World  Bank,  which  has  recently \napproved  a  $3  million  TA  project  on  capacity  building  for  economic  management.  A  key \ncomponent  of  this  TA  is  strengthening  the  capacity  of  the  Ministry  of  Economic  Development \nand  Trade  (MEDT)  to  formulate  and  implement  macroeconomic  and  structural  policies, \nparticularly  those  pertaining  to  the  business  environment.  To  this  end,  the  TA  will  support:  \n(i) a reorganization of MEDT to refocus its objectives and strategy, (ii) improvements to human \nresource  management  and  development  of \nfor  MEDT  staff,  and  \n(iii)  establishment  of  a  policy  development  group  of  qualified  officials  and  financing  of  salary \nsupplements  for  members  of  the  group.  By  strengthening  the  institutional  capacity  of  the \nExecuting  Agency  (EA)  of  this  Program,  the  World  Bank  TA  will  contribute  directly  to  both  its \nimplementation  and  the  long-term  sustainability  of  reforms.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  Doing  Business \nproject has also provided specific inputs in a number of areas related to the investment climate. \nADB has coordinated closely with the Doing Business team in assessing and monitoring recent \nchanges in business conditions in the Kyrgyz Republic. \n \n48. \nUnder  its  Regional  Business  Environment  Improvement  Project,  the  United  States \nAgency for International Development (USAID) has supported the development of a number of \nkey  laws,  including  those  on  inspections  and  regulatory  impact  assessment.  ADB  has  worked \nclosely  with  German  development  cooperation  through  GTZ  to  prepare  the  concept  for  the \nexport  and  import  single  window,  which  was  supported  through  a  GTZ  regional  economic \ncooperation TA. The development coordination matrix is in Appendix 2. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM AND GRANT ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n49. \nThe  proposed  program  cluster  supports  sustainable  economic  growth  and  employment \ncreation.  The  program  outcome  will  be  a  better  business  environment  and  investment  climate \nthat  will  generate  domestic  and  foreign  investments.  The  Program  will  comprise  three  core \npolicy areas: (i) reducing entry and exit barriers and compliance costs, (ii) improving access to \nfinance, and (iii) promoting private sector participation in infrastructure.     \n \n50. \nSubprogram  1  includes  a  program  grant  supporting  policy  reforms,  and  a  grant \nsupporting the adoption of modern equipment and technology for effective implementation of the \npolicy reforms. A TA grant is proposed to support implementation of reforms.  \n \n51. \nTable 3 provides a snapshot of key achievements envisioned under the program cluster. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 3.

Under  subprogram  1,  the  Government \nhas introduced the new Law on Registration of Legal Entities and amendments to the Civil Code \nto  provide  the  legal  basis  for  the  establishment  of  the  one-stop  shop  enabling  businesses  to \ncomplete  all  registration  formalities  at  MOJ.  The  legal  amendments  also:  (i)  remove  the \nrequirement for substantive review of registration documents and introduce standard company \ncharters  for  limited  liability  companies,  (ii)  remove  the  requirement  of  the  lengthy  process  of \nlegalization on constitutive documents for foreign investors, (iii) establish rules for deregistration \nof dormant companies and voluntary deregistration, and (iv) strengthen the protection given to \nlegal  names  of  legal  persons.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  Government  has  adopted  a  detailed \nblueprint  with  streamlined  procedures,  institutional  arrangements  and  a  plan  for  automation  of \nthe  one-stop  shop.  The  Government  has  also  commenced  the  process  of  removing  the \nrequirement  for  legalization  of  constitutive  documents  for  foreign  investors  by  acceding  to \nHague Apostille Convention.16 \n \n55. \nUnder subprogram 2, the Government will fully implement the one-stop shop at the State \nRegistration  Department  at  the  MOJ.  The  system  will  then  be  installed  in  the  Justice \nAdministrations of Chui oblast, Bishkek city, and Osh city. Subprogram 3 will support the rollout \nof the one-stop shop in the remaining six oblasts after incorporating lessons from the pilot stage. \nTo  strengthen  the  accountability  of  state  registering  agencies,  the  Government  will  introduce \nregulations  and  measures  to  monitor  and  disclose  information  related  to  one-stop  shop \nregistration  outcomes.  The  Government  will  begin  implementing  International  Organization  for \nStandardization  (ISO)  9001  certification  of  the  business  registration  process  employed  across \nthe  Kyrgyz  Republic.  The  ISO  certification  will  enable  the  authorities  to  align  processes  with \nwell-defined  objectives  to  maintain  service  quality.  Subprograms  2  and  3  will  also  support  the \nestablishment  and  implementation  of  the  mechanisms  of  compulsory  and  voluntary  de-\nregistration of dormant companies. This will involve developing appropriate \u201ctrigger events\u201d and \nnotification processes. \n     \n\nb. \n\nStreamline Licensing and Inspections Regime   \n\n56. \nThe  objective  of  this  component  is  to  improve  the  licensing  and  inspections  system, \nwhich  currently  imposes  significant  costs  on  businesses  and  create  opportunities  for  rent-\nseeking. Under subprogram 1, the Government has established mechanisms for the regulatory \nreview  of  government  regulations  with  clear  delegation  of  enforcement  authority  to  a  new \ninterdepartmental  committee. 17  The  Government  has  also  approved  an  RIA  that  sets  out \nprinciples and criteria for assessing existing licenses and justifying new licenses. Following the \nenactment of the Law on Inspections in May 2007, the Government has adopted procedures for \ninspections by authorized agencies, defining the rights, obligations and liabilities of the agencies \nand of the business entities.  \n \n57. \nSubprogram  2  will  support  the  implementation  and  enforcement  of  reforms  initiated \nunder  subprogram  1  by  strengthening  the  dedicated  RIA  unit  in  MEDT,  initiating  the  RIA \nprocess  in  strict  compliance  with  the  rules,  and  ensuring  public  disclosure  of  licenses  and \n                                                 \n16  The  Hague  Convention  of  5  October  1961  Abolishing  the  Requirement  of  Legalization  for  Foreign  Public \n\nDocuments. \n\n17 The  interdepartmental  committee  is  chaired  by  the  Minister  of  Economic  Development  and  Trade  and  includes \nsenior  officials  from  MEDT,  MOF,  MOJ,  Investment  Council,  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Office,  National  Anti-Corruption \nAgency, and the heads of the Union of Entrepreneurs and Congress of Business Associations. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n16 \n \n\nregulations  that  comply  with  the  RIA.  The  Government  will  also  develop  implementation \nprocedures  and  strengthen  recourse  mechanisms  by  establishing  clear  mechanisms  for \nreporting  violations  of  inspections  and  licensing  rules  to  the  interdepartmental  committee  (for \nexample, through the existing hotline in MEDT) and regularly and publicly disclosing the number \nand  types  of  complaints  and  follow-up  actions  by  MEDT  and  the  relevant  agencies.  Under \nsubprogram  3,  a  full  assessment  of  the  regulatory  review  process  will  be  conducted  and \nrevisions made if necessary. \n \n\nc. \n\nReduce Administrative Barriers to Trade \n\n58. \nThe costs and delays associated with internal processes for export and import clearance \nare  significant,  and  undermine  the  potential  benefits  from  the  modernization  of  customs \nadministration and regional initiatives to facilitate the movement of goods across borders. This \ncomponent  of  core  policy  area  1  aims  to  promote  trade  by  simplifying  and  harmonizing \nregulations  and  documentary  requirements  and  by  facilitating  information  exchange  among \nbusinesses  and  government  agencies.  The  component  will  support  the  establishment  of  a \ncustomer-orientated pre-customs single window which could significantly reduce the document \npreparation  time  and  business  cost  (currently  approximately  26  days  and  $200).  Under \nsubprogram 1, the Government has approved a concept paper outlining the objectives and the \nmain  features  of  the  pre-customs  single  window.  Following  this,  the  Government  has  also \nadopted a detailed blueprint for harmonizing and streamlining documentation and reengineering \nprocedures and for establishing the institutional framework for the pre-customs single window. \nSubprogram  2  will  support  the  adoption  of  regulations  and  harmonization  of  customs-related \ndocuments,  and  to  automate  the  pre-customs  single  window  and  the  payment  mechanism. \nUnder  subprogram  2,  the  Government  will  also  begin  the  ISO  9001  certification  process  to \nensure management and service quality. Key activities envisioned under subprogram 3 include \na full assessment of the pre-customs single window with a view to strengthening it further and \nthe  consideration  of  advanced  payment  options  in  line  with  the  banking  facilities  and  systems \navailable in the Kyrgyz banking system. \n \n\n2. \n\nCore Policy Area 2: Improving Access to Finance \n\nIn  tandem  with  reforms  under  ADB\u2019s  Banking  Sector  and  Capital  Market  Development \n59. \nProgram (footnote 6) that aim to improve confidence in and the savings mobilization capacity of \nthe  financial  sector,  reforms  under  the  program  cluster  will  aim  to  improve  credit  institutions\u2019 \nconfidence  in  the  enforcement  of  financial  contracts  and  their  capacity  to  assess  borrowers\u2019 \nspecific  credit  risk.  By  significantly  reducing  credit  risks  and  the  inefficiency  of  financial \nintermediation, these measures will improve access to finance to longer-term capital equipment \ninvestment. \n \n\na. \n\nStrengthen the Secured Lending Framework  \n\n60. \nAlthough the Law on Pledges gives clear rights to the pledge holder to take possession \nof  pledged  property  from  the  pledge  giver  without  turning  to  the  court,  in  practice  this  right \ncannot be effectively enforced. During subprogram 1, a detailed set of amendments to the Law \non  Pledges,  the  Civil  Code,  and  other  laws  have  been  drafted  to  improve  extrajudicial \nenforcement  of  pledges.  This  will  be  accomplished  primarily  by  allowing  for  the  use  of  notary \nexecutive inscriptions and court executors, as well as by the removal of restrictions on auctions \nfor  repossessed  assets.  Key  amendments  to  the  Law  on  Third  Party  Courts,  and  further \namendments  to  the  Code  of  Civil  Procedures  and  the  Law  on  Court  Executors  have  been \ndrafted in order to improve the effectiveness of third party courts. The draft amendments will be \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17\n\nsubmitted to Parliament  during subprogram 2. During subprogram 2, draft amendments to the \nLaw on Licensing will also be submitted to Parliament to clarify which licenses are alienable. In \nparallel, reforms to the Central Pledge Office, which supervises the regulatory, operational and \ntechnological implementation of the law, will be identified. Physical and institutional upgrades to \nthe Central Pledge Office will be undertaken during subprogram 3. \n \n\nb. \n\n Improving Conditions for Leasing Development \n\nThe new tax code adopted during subprogram 1 addresses a number of impediments to \n61. \nleasing  development.  Until  recently,  lease  agreements  were  subject  to  both  import  VAT  and \ndelivery VAT (output VAT). As the import VAT charge was not deductible from the output VAT \ncharge  collected,  leasing  was  in  effect  subject  to  double  taxation.  The  new  tax  code  has \neliminated  the  VAT  on  leasing.  Additional  changes  to  the  tax  code  include  the  removal  of \nrestrictions on the interest charge that can be claimed as tax-deductible expense by a lessee. \nDuring  subprogram  1,  the  Government  has  also  issued  a  public  notification  to  clarify  that  the \ncurrent  legislation  allows  a  lessee  to  choose  between  capitalizing  financial  lease  assets  or \nclaiming financial lease payments as a tax deductible expense. \n  \n62. \nHowever, the main obstacle to leasing expansion, especially for corporate investment in \ncapital  equipment  (as  household  lessees  will  probably  be  the  group  that  will  benefit  the  most \nfrom  the  changes  to  VAT  rules),  is  the  weak  mechanism  for  enforcing  lessors\u2019  rights.  Under \nsubprogram 2, amendments to the Law on Pledges (or Law on Leasing) will provide for the new \nmechanisms  for  extrajudicial  enforcement  of  pledges  on  loans  to  be  extended  to  lease \nagreements, and coupled with the amendments to be made on the Law on Arbitration, this will \nsubstantially  improve  the  ability  to  enforce  rights  in  an  extrajudicial  manner.  Also  under  these \namendments, filing with the Central Pledge Office of lease agreements will be made mandatory \n(a lease agreement will be invalid if not registered). Implementing a public awareness program \nto raise awareness of the rights and obligations under lease agreements will be an integral part \nof the reform agenda during subprogram 2.  \n \n\nc. \n\nImproving Credit Information Sharing \n\nTo develop an effective credit information system, the Government has completed under \n63. \nsubprogram 1 crucial amendments to the Civil Code to explicitly allow for negative information \nsharing  and  for  future  enactment  of  specialized  legislation  to  govern  CIS  systems.  During \nsubprogram 2, amendments to the Law on Banks and Banking Activities will be undertaken to \nensure they are consistent with the Civil Code. These activities will form the basis for progress \nunder subprogram 2, during which the Government will complete a study, in close consultation \nwith  all  stakeholders,  to  finalize  legal  reforms  to  enable  the  use  of  a  borrower\u2019s  \u201cpositive\u201d \ninformation,  to  define  liabilities,  and  to  impose  penalties  for  its  misuse.  The  study  will  also \ndevelop appropriate code of conduct for CIS institutions and procedures for borrower recourse. \nImplementation of these measures will significantly reduce legal risks to participating members \nof CIS institutions. \n \nDifferent  options  to  improve  the  effectiveness  of  the  current  CIS  institution  will  also  be \n64. \nassessed  in  detail  during  subprogram  2,  with  a  view  to  achieving  full  compliance  with  CIS \nrequirements by participating banks and to minimizing duplication of investments in information \ntechnology  (IT).  During  subprogram  2,  the  implementation  of  the  most  appropriate  option  will \nalso  be  initiated.  Under  subprogram  3,  any  implementation  difficulties  and  adjustments  will  be \naddressed  systematically  by  providing  technical  solutions  to  the  policy  framework  developed \nduring subprogram 2. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n18 \n \n\n3. \n\nCore Policy Area 3:  Promoting Private Sector Participation in \nInfrastructure    \n\nCore policy area 3 aims to support private sector development by reducing infrastructure \n\n65. \nbottlenecks such as those caused by high transport costs and frequent power outages. \n \n\na. \n\nPolicy, Legal, Regulatory, and Institutional Framework \n\ninfrastructure  sectors  and  efficient  use  of \n\nThe Government\u2019s support for private sector participation in infrastructure development \n66. \nwas reiterated by the President in a speech to Parliament on 10 January 2008. This high-level \npolicy  statement  emphasized  the  need  for  (i)  an  effective  combination  of  domestic  resources \nand external investments; (ii) an acceleration of the privatization of the remaining state-owned \nenterprises;  (iii) transparency, legality and economic feasibility of the privatization process, and \n(iv) the application of new PPP mechanisms.   \n \n67. \nSubprogram 1 supported a review of key cross-sector and sector-specific laws such as \nthe  Law  on  Concession,  Law  on  Procurement,  Law  on  Roads,  and  Law  on  Energy.  Under \nsubprogram 2, the Government will develop the legal framework for private sector participation \nin specific infrastructure projects under various types of PPPs. To ensure a consistent approach \nacross \nfunds  by  ministries  and  municipal \nadministrations,  the  Government  has  expanded  the  mandate  of  the  Coordination  Council  on \nMacroeconomic  and  Investment  Policy  (Coordination  Council)  to  include  formulating  and \nimplementing  PPP  policy  matters.  Specifically,  the  Coordination  Council  will  now  also  be \nresponsible  for  ensuring  policy  consistency,  quality  control,  and  transparency  by  establishing \nmandatory  standards  and  principles.  The  Government  has  also  established  a  PPP  Unit  in \nMEDT  that  will  serve  as  the  secretariat  to  the  Coordination  Council  on  PPP  matters.  For  the \nday-to-day management of PPP projects, PPP focal points have been established in Ministry of \nTransport and Communications and the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Fuel Resources. Under \nsubprogram 1, the Government has also established a risk management unit in the Ministry of \nFinance  (MOF)  responsible  for  evaluating  requests  for  government  support  for  PPP  projects \nand managing consequent budget risks. The PPP unit, PPP nodes and risk management unit \nwill become fully operational under subprogram 2. A risk management policy defining principles \nsuch as legality, project quality, fiscal prudence and transparency and specifying criteria for risk \nsharing will also be developed during subprogram 2.  \n \n\nb. \n\nSector Reforms \n\n68. \nThis component will support sector reforms to attract private investment in infrastructure.  \nUnder  subprogram  1,  the  Government  has  completed  a  master  plan  for  the  energy  sector.  A \nsimilar  master  plan  will  be  prepared  for  the  transport  sector  under  subprogram  2.  Under \nsubprogram 1, the Government has also developed a strategy for achieving full cost recovery in \nthe  energy  sector  through  efficiency  improvements  and  tariff  increases.  Subprograms  2  and  3 \nwill support the gradual implementation of the cost recovery strategy.   \n \nThe Government needs to shift gradually from being a service provider to playing a role \n69. \nas  policy  maker,  planner,  coordinator,  facilitator,  and  purchaser  of  infrastructure  services.  To \nachieve  this,  subprogram  3  will  support  an  assessment  of  the  regulatory  framework  in  the \nenergy  and  transport  sectors,  and  the  implementation  of  recommendations  arising  from  the \nassessment. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19\n\nc. \n\nPilot PPP Projects  \n\n70. \nUnder subprogram 1, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and the Ministry of \nIndustry, Energy and Fuel Resources have identified a preliminary list of candidate PPP projects \nfrom their master plans. The most attractive will be piloted under subprogram 2 to demonstrate \nthe key principles, practices and benefits of the new PPP framework.  For these pilot projects, \nfeasibility  studies  will  be  prepared,  followed  by  competitive  bidding  and  contracting  under \nsubprograms 2 and 3. The sector ministries will also start a rolling pipeline of PPP projects for \nfuture preparation and execution. \n \n\nd. \n\nFinancing Mechanisms for PPP Projects  \n\nThere  are  three  options  for  financing  the  preparation  of  PPPs:  (i)  allocations  from  the \n71. \ngovernment budget; (ii) aid from development partners on a project-by-project basis; or (iii) aid \nfrom  development  partners  for  a  project  development  facility,  which  would  be  administered  by \nthe  PPP  unit.  During  subprogram  2,  the  Government  will  assess  the  financing  needs  for  PPP \nproject preparation and execution and identify funding sources. An appropriate financing facility \nwill also be established.  \n \n72. \nSustainable  financing  of  PPP  projects  will  be  facilitated  by  the  availability  of  long-term \nfunds from the domestic financial market.  As a first step, under subprogram 2, the Government \nwill prepare a policy paper on long-term infrastructure financing, outlining the measures needed \nto mobilize resources through various methods, and the structures through which such financing \ncan  be  provided  for  PPP  projects.  Under  subprogram  3,  the  Government  will  begin  gradually \nimplementing the infrastructure financing policy. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nClose  Alignment  with  Government  Priorities. Government commitment to improving \n73. \nthe  investment  climate  is  strong,  as  evidenced  by  the  priorities  outlined  in  the  CDS  and  a \nnumber  of  recent  measures,  such  as  the  approval  of  the  RIA  methodology  and  the  Law  on \nInspections.  The  Program  enjoys  support  at  the  highest  level  of  Government  and  both  the \nPresidential  Administration  and  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Office  are  directly  involved  through  the \nprogram  steering  committee.  This  is  a  unique  opportunity  for  ADB  to  advance  necessary  but \ndifficult reforms that may otherwise not have been possible. \n \nPrivate  Sector  Involvement  in  the  Reform  Process.  Policy  dialogue  between  the \n74. \nprivate sector and the Government has recently become more constructive and meaningful. An \nInvestment  Council  was  established  by  the  President  in  2007  with  the  explicit  mandate  of \nimproving  the  private  sector\u2019s  involvement  in  reform  direction  and  policy  decisions.  It  has \nevolved into an effective forum for stakeholder consultations, and businesses have reported that \na  number  of  their  concerns  have  been  addressed  directly  as  a  result.  Program  design  and \nimplementation will benefit from this improved environment. \n \nD. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n75. \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  support  the  Government\u2019s  policy  reform  program  through  a \nprogram  grant  of  $12.5  million  from  its  Special  Funds  resources.  It  is  estimated  that \napproximately  $5  million  of  the  grant  proceeds  will  be  used  to  meet  the  balance  of  payments \nneeds highlighted in paras. 6\u20139.  The remainder will help leverage reforms under the Program. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n20 \n \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n76. \nExecuting and Implementing Agencies.  MEDT will be the EA for the overall program. \nIt  will  have  responsibility  for  the  execution  and  coordination  of  program  activities.  The  main \nimplementing  agencies  (IAs)  will  be  MEDT,  MOF,  MOJ,  NBRK  and  the  State  Customs \nCommittee.  The principal IAs for the Program will be: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n \n \n\nCPA 1: MEDT, MOJ, and State Customs Committee; \nCPA 2:  MEDT, MOJ and NBKR; and \nCPA 3:  MEDT and MOF. \n\n \n77. \nProgram Steering Committee. A high-level program steering committee chaired by the \nMinister  of  Economic  Development  and  Trade,  with  representatives  from  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s \nOffice,  Presidential  Administration,  Investment  Council,  MOJ  and  MOF  will  guide  the  reform \nagenda  proposed  under  the  Program.  The  committee  will  meet  at  least  three  times  a  year,  to \ndiscuss issues highlighted in progress reports, and other related policy issues. ADB may join the \nmeetings as an observer.  \n \n78. \nProgram Working Group. A program working group chaired by MEDT and represented \nby  all  IAs  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  program  implementation.  The  working  group  will \nmeet  at  least  once  every  month  to  ensure  progress  is  being  made.  It  will  submit  quarterly \nprogress reports to the program steering committee and to ADB.  \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n79. \nThe  implementation  period  for  the  program  grant  for  subprogram  1  is  October  2007\u2013\nOctober 2008. The tentative implementation period for subprogram 2 is November 2008\u2013June \n2010, and the tentative implementation period for subprogram 3 is July 2010\u2013December 2011. \n \nG. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\n80. \nProgram  grant  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  foreign  exchange  cost  of  items \nproduced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  other  than  items  specified  in  the  list  of \nineligible items (Appendix 5) or imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. All \nprocurement under the program grant will be undertaken through normal commercial practices \nfor  the  private  sector  of  the  Government\u2019s  prescribed  procurement  procedures  acceptable  to \nADB,  with  due  consideration  to  economy  and  efficiency.  The  Government  will  certify  that  the \nvolume of eligible imports exceeds the amount of ADB\u2019s projected disbursement under the grant \nfor  the  given  period.  The  disbursement  of  the  program  grant  will  be  in  accordance  with \nSimplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans \n(1998).  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  program  grant  proceeds  and  verify  the \naccuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \nH. \n\nTranching and Counterpart Funds \n\n81. \nThe grant proceeds will be available for withdrawal in a single tranche in the amount of \n$12.5 million for subprogram 1. All prior actions in the subprogram 1 matrix in Appendix 4 must \nhave been satisfied before the subprogram 1 can be withdrawn. \n \n82. \nThe  Government  shall  ensure  that  the  local  currency  funds  generated  by  the  program \ngrant  shall  be  used  (i)  to  support  the  adjustment  costs  of  reforms  to  be  initiated  and \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n21\n\nimplemented under subprogram 1, and (ii) to finance expenditures for the Government\u2019s general \ndevelopment purposes. \n \nI. \n\nGrant for System Support  \n\n83. \nObjective.  The  Project  aims  to  reduce  the  cost  of  doing  business  by  streamlining \nbusiness  registration  process  and  export  and  import  clearance  procedures.  Specifically,  the \nProject  will  support  the  establishment  of  a  one-stop  shop  for  business  registration  and  a  pre-\ncustoms single window for export and import clearance. The Project will have the following main \ncomponents. \n \n84. \nOne-Stop Shop Business Registration. The Project will support the implementation of \nan automated one-stop shop that will allow all registration formalities to be completed in MOJ.  \nThis will significantly reduce the time taken to register a business (from 21 days to 3 days), and \nwill  reduce  the  uncertainty  associated  with  the  approval  process.  A  summary  of  the  one-stop \nshop blueprint is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n85. \nPre-Customs  Single  Window.  The  Project  will  support  the  implementation  of  a  pre-\ncustoms  single  window  to  enable  businesses  to  submit  applications  and  receive  permits  and \ncertifications for exports and imports through a single channel. Currently, pre-customs clearance \nrequires at least 12 separate approvals and about 25 days clearance time.  By streamlining and \nharmonizing  regulations  and  automatic  processes,  the  pre-customs  single  window  will  enable \nbusinesses to obtain clearances within 5 days and through a single administrative document. A \nsummary of the pre-customs single window blueprint is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n86. \nCost Estimates and Financing Plan. The total project cost is estimated at $3,625,000.  \nA summary of the cost estimates is provided in Table 4.

A  project  technical  cell  will  be  established  in  MEDT  to \nimplement the project grant. The cell will include project managers appointed by MEDT, MOJ, \nand  the  State  Customs  Committee.  It  will  be  supported  by  an  international  one-stop  shop \nregistration bureau and pre-customs single window expert and two national IT experts.   \n \n\nThe project grant will be implemented during November 2008 to June 2010.   \n\nThe  overall  implementation  arrangements  for  the  program  and  project  grants  are \n\n1. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n89. \n \n90. \nsummarized in Appendix 7. \n \n\n2. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n91. \nA total of 11 person-months of international consulting services and 24 person-months of \nnational consulting services will be financed by the project grant. The outline terms of reference \nand detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 6. The consultants will be recruited on an individual \nbasis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime to time), and ADB\u2019s procedures for recruiting individual consultants.   \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement  \n\n92. \nThe  project  technical  cell,  through  MEDT,  will  be  responsible  for  procurement  of  all \nequipment  and  services  under  the  project  component.  All  equipment  and  services  to  be \nfinanced  under  the  grant  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Procurement  of  goods,  equipment,  materials  and \nservices  costing  between  $0.10  million  and  $0.50  million  will  be  procured  through  national \ncompetitive  bidding  in  accordance  with  the  Borrower\u2019s  procurement  procedures,  subject  to \nmodifications and clarifications to such procedures. Procurement valued below $0.10 million will \nbe  procured  through  the  shopping  method.  Limited  international  bidding  will  be  used  for \nprocurement of items that may not be available in Kyrgyz Republic and whose amounts are not \nlarge enough to attract foreign suppliers through international competitive bidding or if there are \nonly a limited number of suppliers. The project procurement plan is in Appendix 6. \n \n\n4. \n\nDisbursement \n\n93. \nThe  project  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  expedite  project \nimplementation  through  timely  release  of  grant  proceeds,  the  MEDT  will  establish  a  separate \nimprest account for the grant promptly after their effectiveness. Total advances will not exceed \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n23\n\nADB\u2019s estimated share of eligible expenditures to be financed through the imprest account for \nthe next 6 months, or 10% of the grant amount, whichever is lower. The imprest account will be \nestablished  at  a  bank  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  will  be  managed  and  liquidated  in  accordance \nwith detailed arrangements agreed on by the project technical cell and ADB. \n \n94. \nThe statement of expenditure procedure may be used for liquidation and replenishment \nof  the  imprest  account  or  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  not  exceeding  $5,000  per \nindividual  payment.  The  payments  in  excess  of  the  statement  of  expenditure  ceiling  will  be \nliquidated, or replenished or reimbursed based on full supporting documentation. \n \n\n5. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nThe  project  technical  cell  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  Project,  including \n95. \nseparate accounts for the grant.  It will register all receipts and payments for the Project in these \naccounts. The project technical cell will ensure that the Project is managed according to sound \naccounting  principles  and  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  accounts  and  financial \nstatements  for  each  fiscal  year,  including  the  imprest  accounts,  will  be  audited  annually  by \nindependent external auditors acceptable to ADB.  Audit reports should include a separate audit \nopinion on the proper use of the imprest account. MEDT will provide ADB will an audit report, \nwith audited accounts and financial statements, within 6 months after the end of each fiscal year. \nThe  financial  statements  and  auditor\u2019s  report  will  be  in  English.  A  summary  of  the  financial \nmanagement assessment is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n96. \nThe  program  working  group  will  submit  quarterly  progress  reports  to  ADB  and  the \nprogram  steering  committee  on  both  the  program  and  project  grants.  The  reports  will  indicate \nprogress made and problems encountered during the review period, steps taken or proposed to \nbe  taken  to  remedy  the  problems,  proposed  programs  of  activities,  and  expected  progress \nduring the following period. \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n97. \nADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Program.  To  support  these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB's Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant agreements \nand  the  binding  documents  for  the  Program.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Program  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and \nother service providers as they relate to the Program. \n \n\n7. \n\nProgram Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n98. \nThe  program  working  group  will  establish  a  performance  evaluation  system  for  the \nprogram and project components. The program performance monitoring and evaluation system \nwill include a database on the status of policy measures and program indicators based on the \npolicy matrix and the design and monitoring framework. It will also include a system that tracks \nimplementation  progress  of  the  project  component  in  line  with  the  implementation  schedule \nagreed by the Government and ADB.    \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n24 \n \n\n8. \n\nProgram Review \n\n99. \nADB  will  field  regular  review  missions  (three  per  year)  for  the  program  and  project \ncomponents  (reviewing  them  jointly  whenever  possible).  The  missions  will  cover  evaluation  of \nprogram scope, implementation arrangements, and progress with the policy reform agenda. \n \n\nV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT FOR                 \n\nINVESTMENT CLIMATE REFORM \n\nImplementation  Period.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  from  November  2008  to  June \n\n100.  Objective  and  Scope.  The  TA  objective  is  to  support  effective  implementation  of  the \nprogram  cluster.  Specifically,  the  TA  will  help  ensure  timely  achievement  of  the  policy  actions \nenvisioned  for  subprogram  2,  through  technical  inputs,  stakeholder  consultations,  and  public \nawareness  activities  to  build  consensus  on  the  reform  agenda.  Developing  training  programs \nand related manuals to ensure reform sustainability beyond the program period will be a priority. \nIn  line  with  the  program  reform  areas,  the  TA  will  cover  (i)  regulatory  reform  to  reduce \ncompliance costs, (ii) financial sector reforms to improve access to long-term funds  for capital \ninvestment, and (iii) an enabling environment for PPP to enhance infrastructure investment. \n \n101. \nImplementation  Arrangements.  MEDT  will  be  the  EA  for  the  TA.  MOJ,  NBKR,  and \nMOF will be the main IAs. The Investment Council will support reform coordination across the \nEA and IAs and the program working group formed under the Program.   \n \n102. \n2010. \n \n103.  Consulting  Services.  The  TA  will  engage  20  person-months  of \ninternational \nconsultants\u2019  services  and  24  person-months  of  national  consultants\u2019  services.  The  areas  of \nexpertise  will  include  regulatory  impact  assessment,  PPP,  legal  reform,  and  credit  information \nsystems.  The  consultants  will:    (i)  liaise  with  relevant  stakeholders  from  the  Government,  the \nprivate sector and funding agencies to foster participation in the implementation of the Program;  \n(ii)  conduct  technical  round  table  discussions  and  workshops;  (iii)  follow  up  with  the  program \nworking group and IAs on implementation progress and convey to ADB any issues or concerns; \n(iv)    support  the  program  working  group  and  IAs  on  overall  supervision,  implementation,  and \nmonitoring of various activities under the Program; and (v) prepare regular progress reports.   \n \n104.  All  international  and  national  consultants  will  be  engaged  on  an  individual  basis  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime), and ADB\u2019s procedures for recruiting individual consultants. \n \n105.  Cost  Estimates  and  Financing.  The  estimated  cost  of  the  TA  is  $750,000,  of  which \nADB will support $600,000 as a grant from its TA funding program. The Government will provide \nthe  balance  amounting  to  $150,000  equivalent  for  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation, \nadministrative and logistical support. Detailed cost estimates and consultant terms of reference \nare in Appendix 8. \n \n\nVI. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n106.  The Kyrgyz Republic has a narrow economic base and relies heavily on a few economic \nsectors.    By  promoting  the  development  of  a  dynamic  private  sector  through  an  improved \n\nA. \n\nBenefits  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n25\n\ninvestment  climate,  the  Program  will  significantly  contribute  to  economic  diversification  and \nindustrialization. This in turn will be key to sustainable economic growth, employment creation, \nand poverty reduction.  The specific benefits of the Program can be summarized as follows: \n \n\nAdministrative  barriers  in  the  form  of  inefficient  regulation  and  excessive \ngovernment  intervention  and  red  tape  constitute  the  single  most  important \nimpediment  to  private  sector  development.  These  barriers  translate  into  direct \ncosts as well as uncertainty, thereby deterring private investment. The recourse \nmechanisms  proposed  under  Program  will  reduce  this  risk  and  boost  business \nconfidence.  By  streamlining  business  regulation  and  procedures,  the  Program \nwill help promote investment and growth.  \n\nSignificant  progress  has  been  made  in  stabilizing  the  financial  sector  and \nstrengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework.  As a result, confidence \nin  the  sector  has  strengthened  and  access  to  finance  has  improved.  However, \nthe financial sector does not yet play a meaningful role in financial intermediation; \ninterest rates and interest margins are high and loans are mostly short term. The \nProgram will strengthen enforcement of financial contracts and credit information \nsharing among financial institutions, which will be fundamental to reducing credit \nrisk  and  promoting  long-term  funds  for  investment.  The  Program\u2019s  support  for \nleasing will help to expand financing for capital equipment. \n\nThe  enabling  framework  for  PPP  will  help  attract  private  investment  in \ninfrastructure,  which  will  significantly  reduce  the  costs  of  doing  business, \nespecially  those  associated  with  high  transport  costs  and  an  unreliable  energy \nsupply.  More  private  investment  in  infrastructure  will  generate  employment  and \nimprove  incomes.  It  will  reduce  the  need  for  public  spending  in  infrastructure;  if \nthis  saving  is  channeled  toward  social  spending,  PPPs  will  also  indirectly  help \nimprove overall social welfare. \nOver  the  medium  to  long  term,  less  government  interference  and  red  tape  will \nencourage the large number of businesses that are currently operating informally \nto  enter  the  formal  sector.  This  will  generate  additional  tax  revenues.  More \ngenerally,  increased  private  sector  activity  will  enhance  tax  revenues,  thereby \ncreating fiscal space for development expenditures. \n\nLimited  inter-agency  coordination.  Investment  climate  reforms  cut  across \nvarious subsectors, and require close coordination among government agencies. \nThe Program involves five IAs and there is a risk that their work may not be well \ncoordinated.  However,  implementation  arrangements  are  designed  to  ensure \neffective  coordination  at  the  highest  level  for  overall  policy  guidance,  at  the \nworking  level  for  day-to-day  implementation  matters,  and  at  the  technical  level. \nThe  inclusion  of  the  Investment  Council  as  one  of  the  IAs  will  improve \ncoordination  given  its  important  role  in  coordinating  all  reforms  related  to  the \nbusiness environment and investment climate. ADB is currently working with two \nof the IAs in the context of other projects on banking reform and capital market \ndevelopment,  and  customs  modernization  and  infrastructure  development.  This \nwill facilitate interagency coordination and a consistent approach. \n\n \nB. \n\nRisks \n\n107.  The Program faces three main risks. \n \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n26 \n \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n \nC. \n\nImpacts \n\n \n(ii)  Weak  implementation  capacity  and  high  staff  turnover.  Weaknesses  in \nimplementation capacity and high staff turnover are a potential risk, especially in \nMEDT,  which  is  a  relatively  new  ministry.  To  mitigate  this,  the  attached  TA \nemphasizes  capacity  building  and  training.  MEDT  is  gradually  attracting  and \nretaining  more  qualified  staff  as  its  role  and  profile  as  the  lead  agency  for \nmacroeconomic planning and private sector development increase. In addition, a \nrecently  approved  World  Bank  TA  focuses  on  strengthening  MEDT  capacity  by \nimproving human resource management and developing comprehensive training \ncurricula for MEDT staff. \n\nUnforeseen changes in circumstances. The issues to be addressed under the \nProgram  are  mostly  structural  and  hence  unlikely  to  change  in  the  short  term. \nHowever, the specific set of institutional solutions and mechanisms may need to \nbe  adapted  to  changes  in  circumstances  (e.g.  new  parallel  and  related  laws \ncoming  into  effect  and  related  institutional  changes).  This  may  require  different \nsolutions  to  the  original  problem.  The  proposed  cluster  approach  will  help \nmitigate these risks, as it allows for a reassessment of the way forward at each \nprocessing stage of subsequent subprograms. \n\n108.  Subprogram  1  of  the  Program  is  classified  as  environmental  category  C.  It  is  not \nexpected  to  generate  adverse  environmental  impacts  requiring  mitigating  measures.  No \ninvoluntary  resettlement  or  impact  on  indigenous  people  is  expected  from  subprogram  1 \nimplementation. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 9.  \n \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n109.  The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \nassurances: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nthe  policies  adopted  and  actions  taken  prior  to  the  date  of  the  ADB  Board  of \nDirectors\u2019 approval of the program grant, as described in the development policy \nletter and the policy matrix will continue in effect for the duration of the Program \nand subsequently; \nthe  Government  will  provide  budgetary  provisions  to  meet  all  counterpart \nfinancing obligations in a timely manner; \nthe  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with  other \nmultilateral  and  bilateral  agencies  that  may  have  implications  for  the  Program, \nand  will  provide  ADB  with  an  opportunity  to  comment  on  any  resulting  policy \nproposal; \nthe Government will ensure that the one-stop shop business registration system \nwill be fully in line with the blueprint and any variations will be agreed with ADB; \nthe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  pre-customs  single  window  system  will  be \nfully in line with the blueprint and any variations will be agreed with ADB; \nthe  Government  will  ensure,  and  cause  its  line  ministries  and  contracting \nagencies to ensure, that the environmental and social assessments of the model \nPPP  projects  developed  under  the  Program  are  carried  out  and  appropriate \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \nB. \n\n \n\n \n\n27\n\nmitigation  measures,  including  monitoring,  are  prepared  and  implemented  in \naccordance with all applicable laws and regulations. \n\nConditions for Effectiveness \n\n110.  The  effectiveness  of  the  grant  agreement  for  subprogram  1  is  conditional  upon  due \nauthorization, execution and delivery of the grant agreement for system support, and vice versa.  \n \nC. \n\nConditions for Disbursement \n\n111.  Disbursement  of  the  proceeds  from  the  grant  agreements  for  subprogram  1  and  the \nsystem support project is conditional on the completion of the prior actions for subprogram 1. \n \n\nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n\n112. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  program  cluster  and  grants  would  comply  with  the \nArticles  of  Agreement  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove \n \n(i) \n\nthe  program  cluster  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  for  the  Investment  Climate \nImprovement Program; \nthe  grant  of  $12,500,000  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  for  subprogram  1  of  the \nInvestment  Climate  Improvement  Program,  on  terms  and  conditions  that  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Program  Grant \nAgreement presented to the Board; and \nthe grant of $2,900,000 to the Kyrgyz Republic to provide system support for the \nInvestment  Climate  Improvement  Program,  on  terms  and  conditions  that  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Project  Grant \nAgreement presented to the Board. \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n\n \n  10 October 2008 \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n \n\n28 \n \n\n SECTOR ANALYSIS \n\nMacroeconomic Context  \n\n \nA. \n \nNarrow  Resource-Based  Economy.  With  a  per  capita  income  of  about  $700  per \n1. \nannum, the Kyrgyz Republic is one of the poorest countries in Central Asia. Approximately 35% \nof  its  population  of  5  million  lives  below  the  poverty  line,  with  7%  living  in  extremely  poverty.1  \nBeing small, open, and narrowly based in terms of its productive structure, the Kyrgyz economy \nhas been vulnerable to shocks. Economic growth has averaged 5% per year from 1995 to 2007 \n(Figure A1.1), but has been characterized by booms and busts, the latter being linked to single \nevents  affecting  the  few  resource-based  economic  sectors  on  which  the  economy  is  heavily \ndependent. \n \n \n\nFigure A1.1: Economic Structure and Growth of the Kyrgyz Republic \n\n120\n\n110\n\n100\n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n50\n\n45\n\n40\n\n35\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n5\n9\n9\n1\nR\nY\n\n6\n9\n9\n1\nR\nY\n\n7\n9\n9\n1\nR\nY\n\n8\n9\n9\n1\nR\nY\n\n9\n9\n9\n1\nR\nY\n\n0\n0\n0\n2\nR\nY\n\n1\n0\n0\n2\nR\nY\n\n2\n0\n0\n2\nR\nY\n\n3\n0\n0\n2\nR\nY\n\n4\n0\n0\n2\nR\nY\n\n5\n0\n0\n2\nR\nY\n\n6\n0\n0\n2\nR\nY\n\n7\n0\n0\n2\nR\nY\n\n5\n9\n9\n1\nR\nY\n\n6\n9\n9\n1\nR\nY\n\n7\n9\n9\n1\nR\nY\n\n8\n9\n9\n1\nR\nY\n\n9\n9\n9\n1\nR\nY\n\n0\n0\n0\n2\nR\nY\n\n1\n0\n0\n2\nR\nY\n\n2\n0\n0\n2\nR\nY\n\n3\n0\n0\n2\nR\nY\n\n4\n0\n0\n2\nR\nY\n\n5\n0\n0\n2\nR\nY\n\n6\n0\n0\n2\nR\nY\n\n7\n0\n0\n2\nR\nY\n\nGDP growth (annual %) (LHS axis)\n\nWorkers' remittances from Abroad (% of GDP) (LHS axis)\n\nTrade (% of GDP) (RHS axis)\n\nAgriculture, value added (% of GDP)\n\nServices, etc., value added (% of GDP)\n\nManufacturing, value added (% of GDP)\n\nMining, manufacturing, construction, electricity, water, and gas (% of GDP)\n\n \n\n         \n     GDP = gross domestic product, LHS = left hand side, RHS = right hand side.    \n     Source: World Development Indicators. \n \n \n2. \nWith the political instability that followed the Tulip Revolution of March 2005, the ensuing \ndisruption  in  land  ownership,  use  rights,  and  public  order  affected  agriculture  and  mining, \ninterrupting  economic  growth. 2  When  a  resolution  was  reached  on  gold  mining  issues,  a \nrebound in production was expected in 2006. However an accident at the Kumtor gold mine in \nthat year caused a further one-third reduction in extraction, delaying the resumption of growth.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1  While  official  figures  put  the  unemployment  rate  at  8%,  actual  unemployment  and  underemployment  rates  are \nbelieved to be considerably higher. Progress in meeting the Millennium Development Goals has been mixed, and \nmany of the targets are unlikely to be met if the country continues in its current path. \n\n2  Agriculture,  contracted  by  4.2%  in  2005  as  land  disputes  delayed  harvests,  and  gold  mining  activity  fell  by  24% \nbecause of disputes over gold mine concessions and road blockades by  villagers seeking compensation for past \naccidents caused by the Kumtor project. \n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 1\n\n29\n\n \n\nRecent  Growth  is  Consumption-Led. Strong economic growth was resumed in 2007, \n3. \non  the  back  of  strong  trading  and  household  construction.  This  was  mainly  because  of \nincreasing remittances from abroad, particularly from the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan. \nThese transfers are now a major source of balance of payments inflow and have led to a growth \nin  household  demand  that  has  been  a  driver  of  the  latest  expansion  in  economic  activity. \nRapidly  growing  bank  credit  for  the  construction  and  trading  sectors  has  added  momentum  to \nthis process and contributed to a sharp increase in real estate prices. Significant resources are \nbeing mobilized by Kazakh-owned local banks, which own more than one-third of Kyrgyz banks\u2019 \ntotal  assets.  This  expansion  in  credit  demand  has  not  been  matched  by  increases  in  deposit \nmobilization. Confidence building in the banking system has been a long process (starting from \na very low level), and recent increases in deposits have also reflected increases in Government \nbalances with banks (i.e., the increases do not necessarily correspond to a general increase in \ndepositors\u2019  willingness  to  keep  their  savings  with  the  banking  system).  Riding  the  real  estate \nboom has therefore been much preferred by savers. \n \n4. \nThe  recent  deterioration  in  international  economic  conditions  has  brought  new \nmacroeconomic  challenges  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  The  economic  slowdown  in  neighboring \nKazakhstan, in particular, will have important implications since Kazakhstan is one of the Kyrgyz \nRepublic\u2019s main trading partners and sources of foreign direct investment. While the contagion \neffect from the Kazakh banking sector appears to have been limited thus far, it may grow, given \nthe  strong  presence  of  Kazakh-owned  banks  in  Kyrgyz  Republic.  The  sharp  decline  in \nconstruction activity in Kazakhstan has reduced the flow of remittances to the Kyrgyz Republic \n(a  major  source  of  balance  of  payments  inflows)  as  this  sector  employs  thousands  of  Kyrgyz \nnationals.  Largely  as  a  result  of  these  spillover  effects  from  Kazakhstan,  economic  growth \n(excluding gold production) is expected to slow to 5% in 2008. \n \n5. \nMoreover,  the  escalation  in  food  and  fuel  prices  since  late  2007  has  put  pressures  on \nthe  authorities  for  policy  responses  that  have  diverse  fiscal  and  monetary  implications. \nFundamentally,  the  authorities  face  tough  trade-offs  between  competing  macroeconomic \nobjectives.  With  bank  reserves  and  broad  money  already  growing  and  significant  increases  in \ncurrent public expenditures (salary increases of 30% and sizable increases in pension benefits) \nin  the  recent  past,  it  will  be  a  challenge  to  keep  inflation  under  control  and  at  the  same  time \nprovide  safety  nets  to  the  population  most  affected  by  this  shock.  Concerns  have  been \nexpressed  that  the  current  spike  in  imported  inflation  may  become  entrenched. 3  The \nGovernment  has  accordingly  signaled  its  intention  to  tighten  monetary  policy,  and  to  reduce \nnonpriority  current  to  enable  discretionary  spending  to  mitigate  poverty  impacts  from  the  food \nand fuel crises.  \n \n6. \nTo cushion the impact of the price shocks on low-income households, the Government \nrecently  increased  cash  transfers  under  the  unified  monthly  benefit  scheme  by  Som35  (from \nSom125)  per  beneficiary.4 The  Government  has  budgeted  an  additional  Som650  million  ($19 \nmillion)  for  a  variety  of  in-kind  support,  including  for  the  purchase  of  farm  equipment  and \nfertilizers  and  for  subsidized  wheat  for  low-income  households.  The  Government  has  also \n\n                                                 \n3   However,  there  is  considerable  uncertainty  about  how  that  entrenchment  could  be  realized,  as  second  round \neffects of wage claims across the economy would require a tighter labor market and particular collective bargaining \nsettings. These do not seem to be the case in the Kyrgyz Republic. Nonetheless, the International Monetary Fund \n(IMF) Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility review report highlights the Government\u2019s recognition of the need to \ntighten monetary policy. \n\n4   This scheme is based on an assessment of the level of farm and nonfarm income of each household benchmarked \nagainst a \u201cguaranteed minimum consumption level\u201d. There are currently approximately 400,000 beneficiaries of this \nscheme.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n \n\n30 \n \n\nannounced  a  Som100  million  loan  to  Ailbank  (Agriculture  Bank)  for  onlending  to  farmers  at \nbelow-market interest rates (Table A1).    \n \n\nTable A1: Summary of Measures in Response to the Food Crisis \n\nAgency \n\nAmounts Budgeted \nin 2008 \n\nMinistry of Agriculture \n\nSom200 million  \n\nState Strategic Reserves \n\nSom20 million \nSom30 million \nSom400 million  \nSom205 million \n\nPurpose \nTo purchase tractors and ploughing carts to rent \nto farmers \nTo purchase fertilizers for distribution to farmers \nTo purchase seeds for farmers \nTo replenish and increase stock of grains \nTo replenish and increase stock of fuel with \npurchases from Russia and Kazakhstan \nTo onlend to farmers at 7% interest rate \n\nAilBank \n\nSom100 million \n\n    Source: Ministry of Economic Development and Trade.  \n \n7. \nIn addition, the authorities anticipate the need to step-up budget-funded imports of fuel \nduring the coming winter months significantly because of the critically low levels of water in the \nmain  hydropower  generation  reservoir.  As  a  result,  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF) \nestimates that the cost of food and fuel imports in 2008 will be $350 million higher than in 2007. \nAccordingly, IMF projects the current account deficit will deteriorate to 4.4% of gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) in 2008. \n \n8. \nThe Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s near-term economic prospects have therefore become markedly \nmore  uncertain  since  late  2007.  The  authorities  face  two  immediate  challenges:  (i)  securing \nfinancial resources and implementing effective and well-targeted safety net measures to protect \nthose  worst  affected  by  the  food  and  fuel  crises;5 and  (ii)  formulating  appropriate  fiscal  and \nmonetary policies in view of the need for trade-offs highlighted above. Effective management of \nthese challenges will be crucial for ensuring macroeconomic stability as well as for maintaining \nmomentum for reforms to improve the investment climate. \n \nB. \n \nDevelopment  Prospects  and  Challenges.  Known  gold  reserves  are  being  depleted \n9. \nwithout significant new discoveries being made and the potential for exporting hydropower has \nnot yet been realized largely because of the lack of regional cooperation on energy, and limited \ninvestment  in  hydropower  generation  and  distribution.  More  fundamentally,  the  path  to \nsustained increases in income per capita needs to be found outside the natural resources sector. \nManufacturing  activity  represents  only  13%  of  GDP  (as  of  2007)  and  aside  from  a  textile  and \nfabrics sector that has grown in recent years, the potential for employment generation is still low. \nThe  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  small  and  low-income  population  represents  a  very  small  domestic \nmarket (despite the increase in household consumption as a result of remittances), which limits \nthe  potential  for  economies  of  scale  in  industrial  production.  Integration  with  global  production \nand trade is therefore both the most feasible way of expanding target markets (overcoming fixed \ncosts in manufacturing activity) and of absorbing surplus labor from rural areas. \n \n\nInvestment Climate  \n\n \n\n                                                 \n5  To  help  address  the  impact  of  high  food  and  fuel  prices,  IMF  doubled  the  final  disbursement  under  its  Poverty \nReduction and Growth Facility (to $28.8 million) in June 2008. The World Bank has also recently approved a $10 \nmillion  grant  from  its  Global  Food  Crisis  Response  facility.  The  funds  will  be  used  to  augment  the  World  Bank\u2019s \nongoing Agriculture Investment and Services Project (by $4 million) and  Health and Social Protection Project (by \n$6 million, of which $5 million will finance the unified monthly benefit top-up mentioned in para. 7 of the main text). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 1\n\n31\n\n \n\nThe  country\u2019s  inadequate  physical  infrastructure  and  mountainous  geography  leads  to \n10. \nhigh  transportation  costs  for  industry.  Lack  of  adequate  physical  infrastructure  in  the  power \nsector  causes  power  interruptions  that  stifle  the  competitiveness  of  large-scale  manufacturing \nunits.  Above  all,  potential  investors  and  entrepreneurs  continue  to  face  a  hostile  environment \ncharacterized by burdensome and inefficient state intervention, an inefficient regulatory regime, \nand financing constraints. These issues are generally lumped together under the broad heading \nof \u201cinvestment climate\u201d, and, although they affect all businesses, they are most problematic for \nmanufacturing,  which  is  the  most  intensive  user  of  energy  and  transportation  services  and \nstands  to  gain  most  from  the  institutional  mechanisms  developed  by  the  state  to  reduce \ntransaction  costs  (e.g.,  improvements  to  commercial  and  financial  contracts  and  increases  in \nthe number of cross-border transactions).  \n \nAlmost  by  definition,  international  trade  integration  can  only  be  undertaken  and \n11. \nsustained if a  country\u2019s manufacturing  sector  expands  its  exports  and  upgrades  its  production \ncapabilities. Cross-country experience has shown that international integration is both: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\ndependent on (a) a macroeconomic policy environment that keeps real effective \nexchange  rates  stable  and  competitive  (anchored  in  sustainable  fiscal  policies), \nand (b) an investment climate that enables the creation of a vibrant private sector \nwith  access  to  competitively  priced  energy,  transportation  and  communication \nservices, with the capacity to venture into new activities and export markets, and \nhas access to cost-effective financial intermediation; and  \na major enabler of continuous internal diversification of the economy, which leads \nto  knowledge  spillovers  that  trigger  new  activities,  and  economies  of  scale  to \nimprove productivity and cost-competitiveness. \n\n \n12. \nEconomic  policies  to  improve  the  investment  climate  are  therefore  at  the  core  of  this \npotential  virtuous  cycle  and  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  Such  policies  need  to  address \nadministrative burdens and infrastructure bottlenecks that erode the return on investment in the \ntradable  sector,  and  the  lack  of  efficient  financial  intermediation  (caused  by  high  credit  risk  in \nfinancial contracts and low levels of deposit mobilization), which has raised the cost of capital to \nvery high levels.  \n \n13. \nHigh  Administrative  Barriers  and  Compliance  Costs.  Inefficiencies  and  uncertainty \narising  from  the  regulatory  regime  are  a  major  impediment  to  private  sector  development. \nBusiness start-up procedures are onerous and the outcome is unpredictable because of the lack \nof transparency and the discretion enjoyed by the approving authorities. Businesses register by \nsubmitting documents (application form, company charter and founder\u2019s agreement) at the State \nRegistration  Department  of  the  Ministry  of  Justice  (MOJ)  or  other  Justice  Administrations  in \nBishkek city, Osh city and the seven oblast centers. Businesses also need to visit and register \nat the State Committee for Taxes and Collection, the Social Fund, and the National Statistical \nCommittee. The MOJ then conducts a substantive review of registration documents to assess \ntheir  compliance  with  a  number  of  laws  and  regulations  (e.g.,  the  Civil  Code  and  the  Law  on \nRegistration of Legal Entities). This review process is a major bottleneck, causes considerable \ndelay, and is significant drain on MOJ resources.  \n \n14. \nThe Civil Code and other legislation provide for cases where solvent companies can be \nliquidated,  but  there  is  no  easy  or  quick  means  to  liquidate  or  remove  from  the  register  a \ncompany that is simply inactive. This causes difficulties for regulators and supervisory bodies as \nwell as for entrepreneurs who may themselves wish to liquidate their solvent companies but are \ndiscouraged from doing so by the time and complexity of the procedures. If exit from business is \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n \n\n32 \n \n\ndifficult  and  implies  open-ended  tax  liabilities  (as  every  year,  businesses  need  to  pay  taxes, \nirrespective  of  whether  they  are  operating  or  not),  venturing  into  formal  business  becomes  a \nriskier proposition. \n \nThe  proliferation  of  inspections  and  related  fees  and  fines  disrupt  business  operations \n15. \nand  add  significantly  to  the  regulatory  burden.  According  to  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Doing  Business \nreport,6 businesses  can  spend  as  many  as  291  days  dealing  with  license  and  permit  related \nmatters. As a result, in the category \u201cdealing with licenses,\u201d the Kyrgyz Republic ranks 152 out \nof the 178 countries surveyed. In addition to increasing compliance costs, unchecked licensing \nand  inspections  also  provide  rent-seeking  opportunities.  The  list  of  broad  activities  subject  to \nlicensing has been reduced through amendments to the Law on Licensing, but further legal and \nregulatory work will be needed both to reduce the number of existing licenses and permits, and \nto prevent future proliferation. \n \nDespite having a liberal trade policy regime,7 the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s integration with the \n16. \nglobal  economy  has  been  constrained  by  nontariff  barriers.  While  reforms  have  helped \nstreamline  and  modernize  custom  procedures,  businesses  continue  to  face  inconsistent \nregulations and a lack of standardized documents and coordination among ministries and other \ncertification  bodies.  Exporters  and  importers  have  to  submit  almost  a  dozen  documents  to \nvarious agencies just at the pre-customs stage. Movement of goods is further hampered by high \ntransit and transport costs, both formal and informal.   \n \n17. \nthrough legal, institutional, regulatory, and administrative reforms. \n \n18. \nLimited Access to Finance. Despite the increase in confidence in the banking system \nevidenced by the recent growth in deposit mobilization, financing by credit institutions is still very \nlimited in outreach and diversification. The capacity of the Kyrgyz financial system to transform \ndeposited savings into investment financing is low. For example, domestic credit to the private \nsector  in  1995  amounted  to  only  about  12%  of  GDP.  In  2006,  this  figure  was  still  at  10%,  as \nover this period of time, the banking sector went through a deep restructuring process.8  \n \nSince 2006, and induced by a boom in real estate and trading activity, bank credit has \n19. \nexpanded  rapidly,  outpacing  deposit  mobilization  and  driving  interest  rate  margins  to  record \nlevels.  This  indicates  that  the  root  obstacles  to  efficiency  in  financial  intermediation  may  have \nbecome  a  binding  constraint  to  sustained  economic  growth  in  the  Kyrgyz  economy.  Liquidity \nratios in the banking sector have decreased rapidly in the last few years with the strong increase \nin loan demand, and the already very high average interest rate spreads reached 9.7% in 2007, \nup from about 3% in 1999. This is a clear indication of credit rationing. \n \nInefficient  intermediation  by  bank  and  nonbank  financial  institutions  is  a  reflection  of \n20. \nproblems  in  the  legal,  regulatory  and  information  infrastructure  for  financial  contracts  in  the \nKyrgyz  economy.  Financial  institutions\u2019  confidence  in  the  enforcement  of  financial  contracts  is \nfundamentally  undermined  because  of  (i)  the  uncertain  and  ineffective  legal  framework  for \nenforcement  of  financial  contracts  (loans  and  leases),  and  (ii)  the  incomplete  institutional \n\nThere  is,  therefore,  an  urgent  need  to  reduce  administrative  barriers  and  red  tape \n\n                                                 \n6 World Bank. 2008. Doing Business 2008. Washington DC. \n7 Kyrgyz Republic became a World Trade Organization member in 1995, the first Central Asian republic to do so. \n8  The Russian crisis in 1998 severely impacted on the soundness of the Kyrgyz banking system, with the bankruptcy \nof  the  largest  commercial  bank  in  April  1999  ultimately  leading  to  seven  other  banks  being  unable  to  meet  the \nNBKR\u2019s prudential requirements. With a large percentage of the banking sector under corrective action, the sudden \nstop in domestic credit expansion also contributed to weakness in the enterprise sector. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 1\n\n33\n\n \n\nframework  for  warning  credit  institutions  against  competing  pledges  over  the  same  collateral \nand mechanisms for establishing priority. Combined, these problems generate a vicious circle in \nwhich  high  credit  risk  leads  financial  institutions  to  demand  high  interest  rates,  and  higher \ninterest rates lead to riskier credit portfolios and credit rationing. This significantly reduces the \navailability of funds for entrepreneurs, especially long-term funds for capital investment. \n \n21. \nIneffective  Secured  Lending  Framework.  Although  the  Law  on  Pledges  gives \nsubstantial rights to pledge holders, extrajudicial processes to enforce repossession of security \nin  financial  contracts  are  uncertain  and  ineffective  in  cases  where  the  pledge  giver  simply \nrefuses  to  recognize  the  rights  of  the  pledge  holder.  In  practice,  therefore,  it  is  generally \nnecessary to turn to the courts to enforce pledges, although business surveys indicate that the \ncourts seldom function impartially or effectively.  \n \n22. \nCreditors  are,  therefore,  invariably  subjected  to  long  and  costly  judicial  processes. \nFurther legal shortcomings reduce the value of the asset that had been offered as collateral. For \nexample,  the  lack  of  correspondence  between  the  Law  on  Pledges  and  the  Law  on  Licensing \nlimits creditors\u2019 ability to use operating licenses as assets for what they are worth (e.g. by being \ngiven  enough  time  to  look  for  an  interested  party,  as  operating  licenses  would  be  quickly \nrevoked). Also, provisions in the Law on Pledges and in the Civil Code require that all pledge \ncontracts  must  contain  valuations  of  assets,  and  provide  that  auctions  for  all  repossessed \nassets  must  have  artificial  starting  prices.  Creditors\u2019  rights  are  thus  not  protected,  and  this \nsignificantly impairs lending. \n \n23. \nConditions  for  Leasing  Development.  Leasing  has  the  potential  to  overcome  the \nweaknesses  outlined  above.  The  fundamental  advantage  of  a  lease  agreement  is  that  the \nfinancing  extended  by  the  credit  institution  is  intrinsically  linked  to  the  purchase  of  a  specific \npiece  of  equipment  (a  movable  asset),  ownership  of  which  remains  with  the  lessor  (the  credit \ninstitution). In most circumstances of contract default, it should be easier to enforce ownership \nrights under a lease agreement than to enforce creditors\u2019 rights under loan contracts. There is \nthus  a  strong  rationale  for  promoting  leasing  as  a  way  of  expanding  investment  in  capital \nequipment. \n \nHowever, leasing activity is still negligible in the Kyrgyz credit market, mostly because of \n24. \n(i) uncertain norms for tax and accounting treatment of both lessors and lessees, and (ii) lack of \nawareness of rights and obligations of lessors and lessees under different lease agreements. As \na  result,  the  currently  weak  credit  enforcement  mechanisms  for  lease  contracts  have  hardly \nbeen  tested.  It  is  expected  that,  as  the  Government  addresses  current  tax  and  accounting \nconstraints,  and  the  market  becomes  familiar  with  this  alternative  financial  product,  the  lease \nportfolio  quality  will  probably  deteriorate.  The  current  practice  of  including  provisions  in  lease \nagreements  for  dispute  settlement  through  commercial  arbitration  is  questionable,  and  will \nprobably  not  circumvent  the  problems  of  judicial  enforcement.  As  described  in  the  Doing \nBusiness report, commercial arbitration in the Kyrgyz Republic is highly ineffective, and as with \nthe case of loans, lessors have currently no effective extrajudicial means of enforcing their rights.  \n \nCredit institutions are still exposed to the possibility of a movable asset financed through \n25. \na lease agreement in effect being presented as collateral in a loan application to a bank, without \nthe bank having the opportunity to be aware of that competing right. The potential increase in \ncredit  risk  in  the  banking  sector  caused  by  this  loophole  may  increase  with  the  expansion  of \nleasing  in  the  market,  as  there  is  currently  no  obligation  to  file  lease  agreements  with  the \nCentral Pledge Office. This should be addressed as a priority. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n \n\n34 \n \n\nThe  lack  of  reporting  mechanisms  and  practices  makes  it  hard  for  credit  institutions  to \n26. \nunveil the specific risk profiles of individual credit applicants. This leads to (i) very little pricing \ndifferentiation  between  borrowers  and  lessees,  (ii)  high  risk  aversion  and  over-reliance  on \ncollateral, and (iii) segmentation of the credit market (e.g. relationship lending). In consequence, \ncredit institutions bear high credit appraisal costs and end up setting loan amount thresholds for \ntheir operations below which no applications are considered. These information problems are a \nsource  of  inefficiency  in  the  allocation  of  deposits  mobilized  in  the  Kyrgyz  economy.  Under \nthese  circumstances,  the  potential  profitability  of  proposed  new  projects  will  not  matter  in  the \ncredit decision. \n \n27. \nIneffective  Credit  Information  Sharing  Mechanisms.  The  current  Credit  Information \nBureau (CIB) has been in existence for 5 years.  It is funded by membership and search fees \npaid by participating financial institutions. According to the Doing Business 2008 report, it covers \na  mere  1.6%  of  the  adult  population,  significantly  below  the  regional  average  of  15.4%,  and \neven  further  below  the  OECD  average  of  59.3%.  The  effectiveness  of  the  current  CIB  is \nfundamentally restricted in two ways:  the uncertainty regarding its legal framework is a source \nof  legal  risk  to  participating  banks;  and  its  self-regulatory  model  cannot  address  issues  of \nenforcement of the reporting rules agreed upon in the CIB membership agreement.  \n \n28. \nTo reduce the legal risk to its members, the CIB urgently needs a clear legal framework. \nThis will require changes to the Civil Code and to the Law on Banking. Currently, the Civil Code \ndoes not include any legal mechanism to enable a borrower\u2019s information to be shared among \nbanks,  or  for  specialized  legislation  to  govern  credit  information  sharing  mechanisms.  Such \nspecialized  legislation  has  recently  been  recommended  in  the  Doing  Business  report,  but  in \nterms  of  sequencing,  the  Civil  Code  and  the  Law  on  Banking  need  to  be  amended  first.  The \nvarious  stakeholders  also  have  to  reach  a  consensus  on  the  overall  institutional  and  legal \narchitecture  that  minimizes  the  legal  risks  in  the  positive  information  sharing  that  participating \nmembers  engage  in.  The  consensus  building  effort  and  the  assessment  of  different  technical \nand institutional options is yet to be initiated.  \n \n29. \nThe  CIB  system  is  generally  not  automatically  integrated  with  the  management \ninformation  systems  of  participating  banks,  which  means  that  the  daily  reporting  requirements \nimpose a heavy burden on bank\u2019s operations, as information about borrowers is input manually. \nThe equivalent cost of this burden, in terms of the number of bank employees directly set aside \nfor this task, is proportional to the market share of each bank. On the other hand, the perceived \nbenefits of the CIB to the participating bank are inversely proportional to its market share. This \ncost\u2013benefit  asymmetry  does  affect  the  reporting  compliance  of  each  bank,  and  the  CIB  is \ncurrently not perceived by a number of banks to be complete in any way.  \n \n30. \nmany infrastructure assets and almost full population coverage with basic infrastructure services.  \nHowever,  lack  of  resources  for  rehabilitation,  maintenance  and  operation  has  resulted  in  a \nserious deterioration of many infrastructure services. For example, road transport accounts for \nabout  95%  of  movements  of  goods  and  people,  but  neglect  of  routine  and  preventive \nmaintenance  means  that  most  roads  are  in  a  distressed  condition.  This  translates  into  high \nfreight  transport  costs  that  add  considerably  to  production  and  marketing  costs.  Frequent \ninterruptions to the power supply also impose significant costs, especially to small businesses. \nThis has been exacerbated by the heavy rationing of electricity in recent months resulting from \nlow reservoir levels and reduced output from the main thermal power plant. The development of \neffective  infrastructure  services,  particularly  in  the  energy  and  transport  sectors,  is  key  to  the \nexpansion  of  the  economy\u2019s  productive  capacity  and  to  the  transformation  of  industry.  If \n\nInfrastructure Bottlenecks. The Kyrgyz Republic inherited from the former Soviet Union \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 1\n\n35\n\n \n\nmaintenance  and  new  investments  are  inadequate,  economic  growth  will  continue  to  be \nconstrained by power outages, traffic congestion, high transport costs, and other infrastructure \nbottlenecks.  \n \nThe  infrastructure  investment  requirements  for  improving  the  investment  climate  and \n31. \nmeeting  the  ambitious  economic  growth  target  outlined  in  the  Government\u2019s  Country \nDevelopment  Strategy  (CDS)  2007\u20132010  are  significant.  Specifically,  infrastructure  spending \nneeds  to  be  significantly  increased  from  the  current  level  of  3-4%  of  GDP  to  at  least  6%.  It  is \nclear  that  the  investment  needs  cannot  be  met  from  the  Government  budget  and  external  aid \nalone, and that private sector financing, both domestic and foreign, needs to be mobilized. \n \n32. \nThe  Government  is  therefore  fully  committed  to  creating  an  environment  that  is \nconducive for private sector participation and for promoting public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs)9 \nfor  commercially  viable  infrastructure  projects.  However,  the  legal,  regulatory  and  institutional \nframework  for  PPPs  is  incomplete.  For  instance,  the  Concession  Law,  1992  only  covers \nconcessions and does not specify other sectors in which PPPs can be applied. Other important \ngaps include: (i) the absence of procedures and criteria for concessionaire selection, (ii) the lack \nof  a  general  clause  or  tariffs  and  tariff  adjustments  in  concessionaire  agreements,  and  \n(iii) ambiguity about the availability or otherwise of government support and financial guarantees.   \nThere is a need to strengthen both cross-sectoral and sector-specific laws and regulations. The \nfact  that  only  one  concession\u2013for  a  gold  mine\u2013has  been  awarded  since  1992  may  be  at  least \npartly attributable to these weaknesses. \n \n33. \nA  conducive  environment  for  PPP  also  requires  an  effective  institutional  framework  to \nensure  a  consistent  approach  to  private  sector  participation  across  sectors.  Adequate  risk \nmitigation and fair risk-sharing mechanisms between the public and private sectors are essential. \nLikewise,  there  is  a  need  to  develop  effective  mechanisms  and  build  capacity  for  project \npreparation and transparent and competitive selection of private sector partners.  \n \n34. \nPrivate  investors  will  participate  in  infrastructure  development  only  if  they  can  fully \nrecover their costs and earn an adequate rate of return. Current low tariff levels in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic  are  a  legacy  of  the  centrally-planned  economy  when  infrastructure  services  were \nprovided at a low or no cost, with tariffs bearing no relationship to the actual cost of supply.  \n \n\n                                                 \n9  PPPs  are  long-term  contractual  arrangements  between  the  public  sector  and  a  private  sector  company  for  the \nprovision  of  an  infrastructure  service.  PPPs  frequently  involve  complementary  investments  and/or  services.  An \nexample  is  private  investments  in  power  generation  that  are  complemented  by  public  investments  in  power \ntransmission  and  distribution.  Another  example  is  the  involvement  of  a  strategic  investor  in  the  construction  and \noperation of a gas transmission project undertaken by the state gas corporation. In the transport sector, the public \nsector can either implement the network of feeder roads to supplement a privately-financed and operated toll road, \nor provide the land required for the toll road. In airports, the public sector can provide the airside facilities such as \nrunways  and  aprons,  while  private  investors  focus  on  landside  facilities  such  as  terminals  and  their  operation. \nPPPs  in  ports  can  consist  of  the  public  sector  providing  the  port  infrastructure  and  the  private  investor  being \nawarded a concession for port operation. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n \n\n \n\n36 \n \n\n \n\nReducing Administrative \nBarriers \n\nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION MATRIX \n\nReform Areas \n\nADB \n\nOther Development Partners \n\nInvestment Climate \nImprovement Program   \n \nKey components include: \n\u2022  one-stop shop for business \n\nregistration, and streamlined \nprocesses for deregistration, \n\n\u2022  streamlined licensing and \ninspections regime, and \n\n\u2022  pre-customs single window for \n\nexport/import clearance. \n\n \nTax Administration Reform and \nModernization Project ($10 \nmillion, 2007) \n \nThe project aims to promote \nefficient and transparent tax \nadministration procedures which \nwill enhance tax revenue, reduce \ncompliance costs for taxpayers, \nand reduce the scope for rent-\nseeking by tax inspectors.

In  addition  to  these  core  reports,  the  consultants  will  be  required  to  provide \nshort  technical  reports  as  necessary,  the  format  of  which  is  to  be  defined  on  a  case-by-case \nbasis. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n \n\n \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nCountry/Project Title: Kyrgyz Republic: Investment Climate Improvement Program \n\nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\nProgram Cluster \n\n \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nCentral and West Asia \nDepartment \nGovernance, Finance, and \nTrade Division \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n\n \n\n \n\nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  medium-term  development  goals  are  outlined  in  the  Country  Development  Strategy  (CDS)  2007\u20132010, \nwhich builds on the National Poverty Reduction Strategy 2003\u20132005. The CDS focuses on four strategic pillars\u2014enhancing \neconomic growth potential, combating corruption, accelerating social development, and promoting environment sustainability.  \nThe CDS aims to achieve annual growth rates of 8.5% during 2008\u20132010. Likewise, it aims to increase per capita incomes \nsubstantially and to reduce the poverty rate to 30% in 2010. The investment required to meet these objectives is large. The \nCDS  therefore  places  a  strong  emphasis  on  improving  the  investment  climate  by  reducing  administrative  barriers,  creating \nfavorable  tax  and  customs  regimes,  and  strengthening  the  financial  sector.  The  program  cluster  is  fully  aligned  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  priorities.  The  Program  is  also  included  in  the  Joint  Country  Support  Strategy  (JCSS)  2007\u20132010  prepared \ntogether  with  the  Department  for  International  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom,  Swiss  Cooperation,  United  Nations \nagencies and the World Bank Group.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nWith an annual per capita income of about $700, the Kyrgyz Republic is one of the poorest countries in Central Asia. Poverty \npeaked at about 60% in 1999 following the Russian economic crisis.  Although poverty incidence has declined since, it is still \nat a very high level of 35%.  Almost 7% of the population lives in extreme poverty.  About 75% of the poor live in rural areas.  \nProgress toward meeting the Millennium Development Goals has been mixed and many of the targets may not be met if the \ncountry moves along its current path.     \n \nMitigating  the  poverty  impact  of  the  ongoing  food  crisis  is  one  of  the  most  pressing  challenges  currently  facing  the \nGovernment. While food producers  will probably benefit from rising food prices, the real incomes of the urban poor and the \nnet food consumers in rural areas will be adversely affected.  As the poorest 20% of the population spend as much as 60% of \ntheir incomes on food, the poor will be the hardest hit by the food price hike.    \n \n2. Design Features \n \nThe Program will support employment generation and poverty reduction through high and sustainable economic growth.    \n\nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n \nBy  supporting  a  broadening  of  the  economic  base  and  thereby  reducing  the  country\u2019s  vulnerability  to  external  shocks,  the \nProgram  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  efforts  through  higher  and  sustainable  economic  growth.  The \nProgram will enhance tax revenues by encouraging businesses that are currently operating informally to come into the formal \nsector  and  by  expanding  private  sector  activities  in  general,  as  well  as  by  reducing  the  need  for  public  spending  on \ninfrastructure.  This in turn will enable more social spending and other development expenditures that directly benefit the poor. \n \nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe Program does not focus on individuals or households or specific geographical areas, but aims to support macroeconomic \ngrowth and poverty reduction through increased investment.   \n \n \n \n\n72 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nI. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9      73 \n\n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nStakeholder consultation for the Program started during the preparation of JCSS in 2006. Program design benefited from a \ncomprehensive assessment that was conducted in 2007 to flesh out the overall legal, policy and institutional aspects as well \nas  sector-specific  constraints.  Consultations  were  subsequently  conducted  during  the  program  preparatory  technical \nassistance  and  during  program  preparation.  In  addition  to  Government  counterparts,  stakeholder  consultations  were  also \nconducted  with private sector participants represented by business associations such as the International Business  Council \nand Chamber of Commerce. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nA  consultation  and  participation  plan  is  not  required  as  there  are  no  significant  social  safeguard  issues.  Nevertheless, \nstakeholder consultation will be an integral part of the Program. \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues. The project has no specific gender implications. \n \n2.
