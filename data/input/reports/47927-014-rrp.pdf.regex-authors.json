I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nequity investment of up to $60,000,000 in the OrbiMed Asia Partners II, LP Fund, not to exceed \n25% of the fund\u2019s total capital commitments and not resulting in the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) being the single largest investor in the fund. \n \nII.  THE FUND \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n2.  Description. The fund, a Cayman Islands limited partnership, is a close-ended private \nequity fund (PEF) with a target capitalization of $300 million that will invest in health care \ncompanies in Asia. The general partner will be OrbiMed Asia GP II, LP, a Cayman Islands \nexempted  limited  partnership.  It  will  have  an  advisory  services  agreement  with  OrbiMed \nAdvisers LLC (OrbiMed), a global health care asset manager. The shareholders of OrbiMed are \nsubstantially the same as the beneficial owners of the general partner.1 \n \n3.  Investment identification. The fund\u2019s concept was driven by a 2011 cross-division \nregional  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  project  spearheaded  by  the  Private \nSector Infrastructure Finance 1 division of the Private Sector Operations Department, alongside \nthe Private Sector Investment Funds and Special Initiatives division.2 The goal of the TA was to \nexamine  the  feasibility  of  establishing  a  PEF  that  would  target  opportunities  that  could \ncommercialize affordable and accessible drug therapies for Asia\u2019s poor, and thereby increase \nthe  current  low  level  of  health  sector  interventions  by  the  Private  Sector  Operations \nDepartment.3 The TA project, led by global consulting firm McKinsey & Co., concluded that a \nsuccessful health-focused private equity fund would experience stronger commercial success \nwith a diversified investment portfolio of both therapeutic and nontherapeutic assets.  \n   \n4.  ADB invited 11 fund managers to express their interest in assisting in the implementation \nof the TA and the production of a formal report that could be used to establish an Asia-focused \nhealth care PEF aligned with ADB\u2019s development goals. At the conclusion of this process, \nOrbiMed was judged to be the most capable in establishing and managing such a PEF based \non its platform and its previous success with its first fund, OrbiMed Asia Partners I, LP.4 \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n5.  Providing affordable and high-quality health care is an increasing challenge for ADB\u2019s \ndeveloping member countries, particularly because of the region\u2019s unique patient and health \ncare dynamics, including lower affordability, high prevalence of certain diseases, geographical \ndispersion, and urban and rural inequalities.5  \n \n6.  In designing a PEF that will target commercial health care opportunities, the fund will \nleverage both (i) the expertise and track record of OrbiMed\u2019s global  health care investing \nplatform, and (ii) the TA outputs. The TA outputs include 29 key health care themes\u201419 in India \nand 10 in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC)\u2014identified by the market analysis.

Ownership, Management, and Governance \n1.  Ownership \n7.  The fund is a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership that will comprise strategic \ninvestors, foundations, family offices, and other institutional investors. (This information was \ndeemed  confidential  according  to  exception  no.  97(iv)  and  97(v)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public \nCommunications Policy.) \n \n8.  The Cayman Islands is on the list of jurisdictions that have substantially implemented the \ninternationally agreed tax standard.6 The Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of \nInformation for Tax Purposes (Global Forum) has determined, following its phase 1 peer review \nof the Cayman Islands, that the country has in place all the elements assessed to date in \nrelation to the internationally agreed tax standard.7 \n \n9.  Following a review of the fund, ADB does not believe that it has been established or is \nbeing used for cross-border tax evasion, money laundering, or terrorism financing.  \n   \n2.  Management \n10.  The general partner is affiliated with the Delaware limited liability company, OrbiMed, \nwhich is the world\u2019s leading health care investing platform with more than $7 billion in net assets \nunder management as of 1 April 2013. OrbiMed maintains one of the strongest management \nteams of all health-care-focused PEFs in the market with 60 investment professionals\u201420 of \nwhom hold PhDs or MDs, and 10 of whom are former chief executive officers or founders of \nhealth care businesses. OrbiMed professionals also serve on the boards of more than 50 health \ncare companies. OrbiMed is one of the first health care investment firms to establish and \nmanage a pan-Asia health care PEF\u2014OrbiMed Asia Partners I, a $182 million fund launched in \n2008\u2014and to maintain a significant team focused on health care investments across multiple \nAsian markets (footnote 1).  \n   \n11.  The general partner will staff a dedicated Asia team comprising at least 11 investment \nprofessionals (substantially the same team that managed OrbiMed Asia Partners I) based in \nOrbiMed\u2019s Shanghai and Mumbai offices (This information was deemed confidential according \nto  exception  no.  97(iv)  and  97(v)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy).  OrbiMed\u2019s \ninvestment professionals have extensive local networks in the medical, scientific, health care, \nand private equity industries, as well as with regulatory bodies, in Asia. The Asia team will also \nleverage the resources and expertise of the OrbiMed platform, including the public equity team, \nthe global private equity team, the royalty team, and other professionals across finance, legal, \ncompliance, trading, and information technology. \n \n12.  (This information was deemed confidential according to exception no. 97(iv) and 97(v) of \nADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy.) After reviewing OrbiMed\u2019s policies to combat money-\nlaundering and the financing of terrorism, ADB is satisfied that sufficient integrity checks and \n                                                \n6  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). 2012.

(This  information  was  deemed  confidential \naccording to exception no. 97(iv) and 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy.) \n \n3.  Governance Structure \n13.  The general partner will follow a three-stage investment process based on an approach \ndeveloped and refined through its 20 years of health care investing: (i) investment screening of \neach  potential  portfolio  company\u2019s  operations,  products,  market  opportunity,  and  valuation \nagainst  the  fund\u2019s  mandate  and  strategy;  (ii)  deal  structuring  and  due  diligence;  and  (iii) \npreparation of investment proposals for presentation to the fund\u2019s investment committee.  \n \n14.  Once an investment has been made, the team assists portfolio companies with strategic \nand operational objectives. One of the team\u2019s competitive advantages (relative to other Asia-\nonly generalist firms) is the ability to tap into OrbiMed\u2019s global relationships with private and \npublicly traded health care companies. The general partner leverages these relationships to \ndrive many facets of growth for portfolio companies, including business development, product \nlicensing opportunities, and mergers and acquisition activity. The team members draw upon \ntheir decades of collective operating and management experience as entrepreneurs and board \nmembers to help portfolio companies achieve strong growth. \n \n15.  In addition to the investment committee, the fund also has an advisory committee of up \nto seven members representing the fund\u2019s investors. ADB will be represented on the advisory \ncommittee.8 \n \nD.  Financial Performance \n16.  OrbiMed, through funds under its management, has made private investments in the \nhealth  care  sector  since  1993  and  has  developed  a  track  record  of  effectively  exiting \ninvestments at attractive returns. The funds managed by OrbiMed have invested about $1.6 \nbillion in more than 155 private investments across a wide range of health care subsectors and \ncompany stages. (This information was deemed confidential according to exception no. 97(iv) \nand 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy.) \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n17.  ADB will provide an equity investment of up to $60,000,000 in the fund, not to exceed \n25% of the fund\u2019s total capital commitments and not resulting in ADB being the single largest \ninvestor in the fund. \n \nB.  Financial Analysis of Expected Returns and Assumptions  \n18.  (This information was deemed confidential according to exception no. 97(iv) and 97(v) of \nADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy.) \n \n                                                \n8  The role of the advisory committee is to represent the interests of the fund\u2019s investors. It will not participate in the \nfund\u2019s  investment  process  or  make  investment  decisions.  A  more  detailed  description  is  in  Ownership, \nManagement, and Governance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "4    \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Exit Strategy  \n19.  The  fund  has  a  10-year  term  from  final  closing,  with  two  options  to  extend  for  a \nmaximum of 1 year each.9 OrbiMed anticipates that the exit strategies for the fund\u2019s investments \nwill include public offerings on both Asian and North American exchanges, and trade sales of \nportfolio companies to strategic buyers.10 Sales to strategic buyers, including larger private \nequity firms, will likely be the most common exit strategy for portfolio companies. As many large \ndeveloped-country health care companies are seeking to expand their activities in Asia, the \nmergers and acquisition markets in the PRC and India are expected to be active and grow \nrobustly. \n \n2.  Reporting Arrangements \n20.  The general partner will provide ADB with (i) quarterly unaudited reports; and (ii) audited \nannual reports, including financial statements, a fund overview, and an overview of the portfolio \nwith brief information on each portfolio company\u2019s performance and valuation. ADB will review \nthis information and will follow up with the general partner when more information or clarification \nis needed. If the information received from the general partner raises issues that could impair \nthe value of ADB\u2019s investment in the fund, ADB will decide whether to put the fund on a watch \nlist for more frequent review and closer attention. \n \n21.  The general partner will be required to submit its environmental and social management \nsystem (ESMS) to ADB and to report annually on environmental and social safeguards issues \nand development effectiveness indicators. ADB will monitor the receipt and quality of the ESMS \nreports and offer guidance if the general partner requires clarification on ADB\u2019s safeguard \nrequirements. \nD.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n22.  Refinement  of  investment  approach. Through the regional project preparatory TA \n(para. 3), ADB played a key role in (i) refining OrbiMed\u2019s investment strategy for the health \nsector in Asia, and (ii) helping the general partner capture the link between successful health \ncare investing and solutions for the underserved. The TA helped the general partner identify \nmore than 50 potential investees with potential for high development impact within its three \ntargeted  categories  of  operations:  (i)  for  products\u2014a  manufacturer  of  affordable,  portable \ndiagnostics  equipment  for  easy  deployment  in  rural  areas  focused  on  HIV,  hepatitis, \ntuberculosis, and dengue; (ii) for services\u2014a network of primary health care clinics in tier 2 and \ntier 3 cities in northern India;11 and (iii) for cost-advantageous production\u2014a branded generic \nproducts company with an innovative distribution model for rural areas. The success of this \nstrategy\u2014and ADB\u2019s presence in the fund\u2014will help signal that commercial investor returns in \nthis sector can be made with impact-oriented investments. \n \n                                                \n9 Any further extensions will be subject to unanimous approval of the advisory committee (including ADB\u2019s consent). \n10 The general partner will have the flexibility of listing on multiple exchanges, including the Hang Seng in Hong Kong, \nChina and the Nasdaq in New York. While a recent reduction in initial public offering activities in the PRC was \nnoted during due diligence, this is seen as a temporary, cyclical slowdown that will not limit the fund\u2019s ability to exit \nfrom its portfolio during its divestment phase. \n11 Generally, in India, tier 1 cities refer to those having a population of 10 million or more; tier 2 for those cities having \na population between 1 million to less than 10 million, and tier 3 for those cities with a population size of less than 1 \nmillion. ", "  5 \n \n \n \n23.  Capital mobilization. Based on its experience with its first fund and the outputs of the \nTA, the general partner\u2019s refined investment strategy requires a larger fund size (at least $300 \nmillion) that it can deploy, at scale, to make investments that will establish benchmarks for both \nthe private equity industry and the Asian health care sector. To achieve this $300 million target, \nthe general partner is seeking ADB\u2019s participation as  an anchor investor based on ADB\u2019s \npresence and reputation in Asia. ADB\u2019s commitment of up to $60 million is therefore expected to \nsend a strong signal to other investors, validating the social and development impact against a \nbackdrop of strong financial returns. It is a prime example of ADB\u2019s \u2015Finance++\u2016 concept of \nleveraging the institution\u2019s reputation and capital to mobilize third-party investment activity in \ndeveloping member countries. ADB\u2019s investment is expected to mobilize at least $180 million in \nadditional commitments from investors. \n \n24.  Health care is a specialized sector within the private equity asset class, with limited \ndistribution across mainstream institutional investors. This is especially true for Asian health \ncare private equity, which operates in a sector with a deficit in overall spending. By investing in \nthe fund, ADB will support the concept of health care investing through pooled investment \nvehicles, which are then envisaged to help unlock capital from fresh sources available for health \ncare opportunities that can reach the underserved\u2014and not just export-oriented, lower-cost, \nand generic therapies. Furthermore, while several funds target health care opportunities in \nNorth America and Europe, many institutional investors who are not familiar with investing in \nemerging markets have viewed an Asia-specific health care fund as being too specialized of an \ninvestment strategy, which presents a significant financing market gap. \n \n25.  Raising standards. ADB\u2019s presence as an anchor investor in the fund obligates the \ngeneral partner to ensure that its investee companies comply with environment and social \nsafeguard standards, and to report on development indicators. ADB\u2019s role, along with other \nmembers of the fund\u2019s advisory committee, will be to assist in providing oversight on important \ngovernance matters that are essential for companies to demonstrate as they seek additional \nsources of growth capital from institutional and/or individual investors. \n \nE.  Risks \n26.  Deal pipeline. While the demand for private financing in Asia\u2019s health care sector is \nvast, these markets are also competitive. There is some risk that the fund\u2019s committed capital \nwill not be fully invested within the investment period or that the fund\u2019s investment objectives will \nnot be fully realized. Partially mitigating this risk is (i) a pipeline totaling more than $840 million \nidentified  for  further  due  diligence  by  the  general  partner,  with  several  potential  deals  in \nadvanced stages of discussion; and (ii) OrbiMed\u2019s extensive track record, experience, and \nplatform,  which  includes  a  significant  team  across  key  Asian  markets  for  sourcing  deals. \nFurther, the general partner has a wide network of local industry relationships that provides it \nwith  significant  access  to  proprietary  deals.  (This  information  was  deemed  confidential \naccording to exception no. 97(iv) and 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy.) \n \n27.  Concentration. While the general partner intends to invest in a diversified portfolio, the \nfund may be exposed to certain geographic and sector concentration risks due to its investment \nstrategy. This risk is partially mitigated by the fund\u2019s diversification mandate: (i) no single \ninvestment may exceed 20% of the fund\u2019s aggregate commitments, (ii) no single health care \nsubsector may exceed 65% of the fund\u2019s aggregate commitments with a minimum of three \nhealth subsectors to be invested, and (iii) no single country may exceed 70% of the fund\u2019s \naggregate commitments. \n ", "6    \n \n \n28.  Potential conflict of interest. OrbiMed conducts a wide range of investment activities \nacross the globe and through various local teams. Situations may arise where OrbiMed may \nhave an interest that conflicts with its duties or that of the fund. (This information was deemed \nconfidential  according  to  exception  no.  97(iv)  and  97(v)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications \nPolicy.) Another conflict of interest could arise from OrbiMed fundraising for a successor fund \nduring the investment period of the fund. (This information was deemed confidential according \nto  exception  no.  97(iv)  and  97(v)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy.)  Where  other \nspecified potential conflicts of interest arise, the general partner will be required to refer the \nmatter to its advisory committee, which will include a representative from ADB, for resolution. In \naddition, any member of the advisory committee, investment committee, and OrbiMed may \npresent to the advisory committee a potential conflict of interest with respect to any proposed \nportfolio  investment  by  the  fund.  (This  information  was  deemed  confidential  according  to \nexception no. 97(iv) and 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy.) \n \n29.  Divestment and exit risks. The fund will pursue the following exit strategies in order of \npriority: trade sale, IPO, put option (if there is no IPO in 6 months), and drag-along rights.12 \nOrbiMed usually structures a liquidation preference for its investments. While divestments might \nbe difficult because of the state of capital markets in the target countries, the fund is not \nexpected  to  be  constrained  by  regulatory  restrictions  on  exits.  However,  given  varying \nregulatory  environments  in  the  target  markets,  the  fund  is  keeping  all  exit  options  open \ndepending on market conditions. Such flexibility is necessary to mitigate exit risks in the target \ncountries.  \n30.  Regulatory and legal risks. Potential risks to portfolio companies may arise because of \nregulatory changes in laws pertaining to the health care sector. To mitigate this risk, all OrbiMed \nfunds  consider  potential  legal  and  regulatory  risks  to  prospective  portfolio  companies.  To \naddress such potential risks, the firm performs extensive due diligence, such as (i) reviewing \nhistorical  correspondence  between  regulators  and  prospective  portfolio  companies,  (ii) \nevaluating the risk of product rejection and/or withdrawal because of regulatory actions, and (iii) \nanalyzing likely future reimbursement rates for health care products from public and private \npayers. In this fund, OrbiMed will invest the vast majority of its capital in commercial stage \ncompanies (i.e.,  those not  at risk from  clinical  trial failures  or  regulatory  rejections  of key \nproducts).  \n \n31.  General risks. The fund will be subject to the typical risks associated with equity and \nPEF investments not already mentioned, including (i) political, economic, and social risks; (ii) \nrisks involving the performance of the underlying investment; (iii)  liquidity risks; (iv) capital \nraising risks; (v) accounting and disclosure risks; and (vi) repatriation and tax risks. \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n1.  Impact \n32.  The success of the fund is expected to catalyze additional health-focused investments in \nthe region through the private equity modality. The expected long-term impacts of the proposed \n                                                \n12 A put option is a contract giving a shareholder the right, but not the obligation, to sell its stake at a specified price \nwithin a specified time. Drag-along rights provide assurances to a minority shareholder that it may join any other \ninvestor (including the majority shareholder) in any sale transaction under the same price and terms.  ", "  7 \n \n \n \ninvestment are (i) improved access and affordability of  health care goods and services in \ndeveloping member countries, and (ii) the establishment of new health-focused funds in Asia \nand the Pacific which reflects development of the private equity industry. ADB\u2019s participation will \nprovide  institutional  support to the fund,  while  also  catalyzing future private  equity  activity \n(potentially resulting in similar funds being raised in the future). The private equity modality is \nexpected to benefit health care companies in the PRC and India by (i) creating sustainable long-\nterm value, (ii) improving the overall quality of health care goods and services, (iii) raising \noverall  health  care  industry  standards,  and  (iv)  transferring  international  best  practices  to \nportfolio health care companies. These equity investments in health care, along with other \nneeded public sector reforms, are expected to reduce out-of-pocket health expenditures in the \nPRC and India, which are home to 46% of the world\u2019s extreme poor (by number). \n \n2.  Outcome \n33.  The outcome is that the fund achieves positive financial returns with social benefits, and \nthus the viability of financing Asian emerging market health care through private equity. (This \ninformation was deemed confidential according to exception no. 97(iv) and 97(v) of ADB\u2019s \nPublic Communications Policy.) The fund also expects to improve the corporate governance \nand transparency of its investee companies, wherever needed, and contribute to overall (net) \njob creation and tax contributions. \n \n3.  Outputs \n34.  The output will be the establishment of the fund and investment of the fund\u2019s committed \ncapital. ADB\u2019s participation will send positive signals to the market, catalyzing investments from \nadditional investors\u2014particularly first-time investors in the sector or Asia\u2019s developing markets. \nThis will enable the fund to reach the critical mass needed to create a diversified portfolio of \nhealth care investments. (This information was deemed confidential according to exception no. \n97(iv) and 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy).13 \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n35.  The fund will support Strategy 2020 in two areas: financial sector development and the \nhealth sector. ADB\u2019s assistance is an equity commitment into one of the largest pan-Asia, non-\ncaptive private equity funds focused on health care products and services. It is aligned with \nStrategy  2020\u2019s  efforts  to  develop  financial  infrastructure  and  products.  The  assistance \naddresses a sector that ADB recognizes as \u2015vital to development, productivity, social inclusion, \nand gender equity.\u201614 \n \n36.  Strategy 2020 supports inclusive growth and opportunities for innovation and value-\nadded technology development. The strategy also recognizes the importance of cost-effective \nand quality health services. The Operational Plan for Improving Health Access and Outcomes \n                                                \n13 (This  information  was  deemed  confidential  according  to  exception  no.  97(iv)  and  97(v)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public \nCommunications Policy).  \n14 ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n ", "8    \n \nUnder  Strategy  2020  supports  health  outcomes  through  more  cost-effective  services  and \nregional public goods, and emphasizes developing partnerships with the private sector.15 \n \n37.  The fund is aligned with the country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2011\u2013201516 by \nfinancing catalytic projects that (i) drive change in private sector development, and (ii) provide \nan alternative source of capital to reduce the PRC\u2019s reliance on TA funds and external financing \nto  introduce  innovation  and  access  new  technology.  The  fund  will  also  contribute  to  the \ncomprehensive health approach in the country partnership strategy for India, 2009\u2013201217 by \ncomplementing ADB\u2019s ongoing interventions in public health and sanitation with the delivery of \nimproved health care systems and services.   \n  \n2.  Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n38.  According to the health sector operational plan (footnote 16), ADB will (i) build on areas \nof the health care sector where it has distinct and demonstrable comparative advantages, (ii) \nwork closely with other agencies showing technical expertise in health, and (iii) focus on\u2014and \nmeasure\u2014the health outcomes of its activities. Investment in the fund is consistent with these \nthree aspects, as ADB will (i) leverage its institutional strength to mobilize capital into the health \ncare private equity asset class, (ii) partner with the sector\u2019s leading manager in health care \ninvesting, and (iii) establish a framework to monitor the outcomes and impacts of the investment.   \n \n3.  Lessons from Previous Operations \n39.  In May 2006, ADB approved a $20 million equity investment in the Asia Healthcare Fund \nLP, which intended to invest in health care companies in India and other emerging Asian \nmarkets. The targeted $200 million fund was subsequently terminated in March 2008 as it was \nunable to reach financial closure, primarily because of the fund\u2019s challenges of launching with a \nfirst-time fund manager in an infant sector. \n \n40.  The lesson drawn from this experience is the importance in selecting an experienced \nand reputable fund manager with a proven track record in fundraising (and subsequently capital \ndeployment). Highly attuned to this lesson, ADB selected an established, top-tier fund manager \nto  execute  this  investment.  ADB  is  confident  that  OrbiMed\u2019s  platform  and  track  record \nestablishes  the  firm  as  the  best  in  its  class  and  more  than  capable  of  achieving  both \ndevelopmental and financial project outcomes. \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions   \n41.  Potential  environmental  impacts  that  may  arise  from  the  fund\u2019s  operations \n(manufacturing,  marketing,  and  distribution  of  pharmaceuticals,  medical  devices,  and \ndiagnostics; operations of hospital groups and laboratory chains; and other services such as \ncontract  research  manufacturing)  include  the  generation  of  domestic  and  hazardous  solid \nwaste, air emissions, and wastewater discharges contaminated with infectious and hazardous \nmaterials and wastes. Other potential issues include threats to biodiversity, those related to \nbioethics, and occupational health and safety hazards. While varied, most of these impacts are \n                                                \n15 ADB. 2008. An Operational Plan for Improving Health Access and Outcomes Under Strategy 2020.

Thus, it is likely that the fund\u2019s \nportfolio companies will be classified category B, while this transaction is classified category FI \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  On  social  safeguards,  the \ninvestment  is  expected  to  be  classified  FI  treated  as  C  since  impacts  on  involuntary \nresettlement and indigenous peoples are unlikely. \n \n42.  In  accordance  with  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  the  fund  will  establish  and \nimplement an ESMS commensurate with the impacts and risks of its operations and that of its \nportfolio  companies.  The  fund\u2019s  ESMS  will  include  a  provision  to  ensure  that  investee \ncompanies will establish and implement an ESMS that matches their operations\u2019 impacts and \nrisks. The fund and its investee companies will comply with the applicable laws and regulations \non environment and health and safety, (This information was deemed confidential according to \nexception no. 97(iv) and 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy).18 The fund\u2019s ESMS will \ninclude provisions requiring the fund and portfolio companies to comply with national labor laws \n(This information was deemed confidential according to exception no. 97(iv) and 97(v) of ADB\u2019s \nPublic Communications Policy), in accordance with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy,19 (This \ninformation was deemed confidential according to exception no. 97(iv) and 97(v) of ADB\u2019s \nPublic Communications Policy). The project is categorized as having  no gender elements. \nHowever, the fund may have opportunities to invest in companies providing maternal and child \ncare services, as well as potentially address the associated high out-of-pocket expenditures, \nespecially in rural areas.20 \n \n43.  During due diligence, the fund\u2019s key investment staff committed to establish, implement, \nand have in place an ESMS that is satisfactory to ADB before ADB\u2019s first investment in a \nportfolio company. A member of the general partner with the required qualifications and skills \nwill be designated as the ESMS officer. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy  \n44.  OrbiMed and the general partner were advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best \ninternational practice relating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of \nterrorism. ADB will ensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate provisions \nprohibiting corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB \nin the event of noncompliance.   \n \nC.
