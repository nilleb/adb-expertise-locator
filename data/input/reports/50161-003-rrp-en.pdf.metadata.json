The report also describes the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by Japan \nFund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) for the financing of the Rupsha 800-Megawatt Combined Cycle \nPower  Plant  Project,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grant. \n\nThe  project  targets  improving  energy  security  in Bangladesh. It  will  increase availability  of \n2. \nefficient and cleaner energy by developing a state-of-the-art power plant with 800-megawatt (MW) \ngeneration  capacity  using  cleaner  and  highly  efficient  power  generation  technology.  The  project \nalso  envisages  the  construction  of  associated  natural  gas  supply  and  power  transmission \ninfrastructure  facilities,  as  well  as  strengthening  of  the  institutional  capacity  and  overall  business \nprocess  of  the  project\u2019s  executing  agency,  North-West  Power  Generation  Company  Limited \n(NWPGCL), to efficiently plan and operate power plants.1 \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n3. \nBangladesh  has  the  eighth  largest  population  and  is  the  10th  most  densely  populated \ncountry in the world.2 The country has achieved consistent and steady economic growth, with real \ngross domestic product estimated at 6.1% in fiscal year (FY) 2014, 6.6% in FY2015, and 7.1% in \nFY2016. 3  The  structure  of  the  Bangladesh  economy  is  gradually  shifting  from  agriculture  to \nmanufacturing  and  services.  The  government\u2019s  strategy  for  development  in  the  medium  to  long \nterm  focuses  on  four  priorities:  (i)  accelerating  growth  to  7.5%  per  year;  (ii)  making  this  growth \nmore  inclusive,  pro-poor,  and  environmentally  sustainable;  (iii)  reducing  the  poverty  rate  from \n24.8% to 18.6% and the extreme poverty from 12.9% to about 8.9%; and (iv) providing productive \njobs for all new entrants to the labor force by 2021.4 \n\n4. \nDespite the economic success, the country faces major challenges in its effort to maintain \nthe  growth  trend  and  move  closer  to  upper  middle-income  status  because  of  infrastructure \ndeficiencies. Bangladesh ranks low in infrastructure quality (behind India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka), \nand  as  such,  addressing  infrastructure  deficiencies  is  a  top  priority  for  the  government.5 A  major \nchallenge  is  to  provide  modern  and  affordable  energy  services  to  those  who  lack  access. \nInadequate  energy  could  result  in  a  loss  of  productivity  and  competitiveness  and  become  a \nconstraint  to  faster  growth  and  greater  investment  in  the  short  to  medium  term.  To  mitigate  this \nconstraint  and  sustain  Bangladesh\u2019s  economic  momentum,  the  government  has  prepared  an \ninvestment plan to increase power generation capacity, as well as improve and extend the power \ntransmission and distribution network, with the aim of achieving universal access to grid-connected \nelectricity by 2021. \n\n5. \nSector overview. The power sector in Bangladesh is characterized by recurring shortages \nof  electricity  generating  capacity  in  the  face  of  ever-rising  demand  in  a  growing  economy.  In \n\n                                                \n1  The project is included in ADB. 2017. Country Operations Business Plan: Bangladesh, 2018\u20132020. Manila. \n2   World Bank. https://data.worldbank.org/country/bangladesh (accessed 1 March 2018). As of 2016, Bangladesh had an \n\nestimated population of 162 million people and a population density of 1,252 people per square kilometer. \n\n3  Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. http://www.bbs.gov.bd/ (accessed 1 March 2018).  \n4  Government  of  Bangladesh,  Planning  Commission.  2015.  Seventh  Five  Year  Plan  FY2016\u2013FY2020:  Accelerating \n\n5  World  Economic  Forum.  2017.  The  Global  Competitiveness  Report,  2017\u20132018.  Geneva.  Bangladesh  was  ranked \n\nGrowth and Empowering Citizens. Dhaka. \n\n111th of 137 countries. \n\n\fFY2015, per capita electricity consumption was 310 kilowatt-hours (kWh); this was lower than most \nof  the  other  countries  in  South  Asia,  indicating  that  power  sector  infrastructure  facilities  in \nBangladesh  require  significant  capacity  additions.6 In  FY2017,  peak  demand  was  estimated  at \n10,400 MW while available generation capacity was  9,479 MW. Net peak demand is expected to \nexceed  13,300  MW  by  2020  and  19,900  MW  by  2025  while  existing  generation  capacity  will \ngradually retire and need replacement. Bangladesh\u2019s power generation expansion plan intends to \nprovide  (i)  the  required  generation  capacity  to  meet  this  increasing  demand  at  least  cost;  and               \n(ii) sufficient generation capacity to meet the government\u2019s electrification goals, including delivering \nservices  to  segments  of  the  population  currently  not  connected  to  grid  electricity,  and  required \nreserve  margins. 7  In  tandem  with  increased  power  generation  capacity,  investments  in  the \ntransmission  network  are required  to  address  transmission  bottlenecks for the  evacuation of bulk \npower  from  power  stations  to  major  load  centers.  Therefore,  at  the  government\u2019s  request,  the \nproposed  Southwest  Transmission  Grid  Expansion  Project  (footnote  1)  will  be  submitted  for \nconsideration by ADB in July 2018. \n\n6. \nEnergy  security.  Domestic  natural  gas  is  the  dominant  fuel  in  power  generation  in \nBangladesh.  In  2016,  62%  of  the  country\u2019s  electricity  was  generated  by  gas-fired  power  stations \nwhile  the  remainder  was  based  on  furnace  oil  (21.3%),  diesel  (8.2%),  power  imports  (4.9%), \nhydropower  (1.9%),  and  coal  (1.6%).  However,  domestic  gas  reserves  are  rapidly  declining  and \nthe  growth  in  gas  production  has  not  kept  up  with  increasing  demand  for  power  generation  and \nother  industrial,  commercial,  and  household  consumption.  Current  reserves  are  likely  to  be  fully \ndepleted by 2030, and domestic gas exploration efforts are yet to yield any promising results. \n\n7. \nTo  address  the  problem  of  declining  domestic  gas  reserves  and  ensure  energy  security, \nimporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) will play a pivotal role. LNG is a cleaner fuel that burns at a \nhigher  efficiency  in  modern  combined  cycle  power  plants,  leading  to  lower  environmental \nemissions, including carbon dioxide. Additionally, production costs of electricity using LNG are now \nmore  competitive  compared  with  many  conventional  fuels.  The  Power  System  Master  Plan  2016 \n(footnote  7)  indicates  that  equal  proportions  of  coal-fired  and  gas-fired  generation  result  in  least \neconomic  cost  on  a  per  kWh  basis  in  the  long  term.  Accordingly,  the  project  is  designed  to  use \ndual fuel gas-fired combined cycle power plant technology.8 \n\n8. \nThe government has executed two separate terminal use and implementation agreements \nwith  Excelerate  Energy  L.P.  and  Summit  Power  International  Ltd.  for  the  construction  and \noperation  of  Bangladesh\u2019s  first  and second  LNG  import  terminals  near  Maheshkhali  Island  in  the \nBay of Bengal. These terminals will enable the government to procure LNG from international gas \nmarkets,  which  will  supplement  the  country\u2019s  declining  domestic  natural  gas  reserves.  The \ngovernment has already signed a long-term contract with RasGas Company (Qatar) to supply 2.5 \nmillion  tons  of  LNG  per  annum  over  15  years,  commencing  in  2018.  The  LNG  terminals  will  be \nconstructed  in time  to  receive  the  first  LNG  delivery  within  2018.  Given  that  the  government  has \nprovided  written  assurance  to  supply  gas  to  the  Rupsha  power  plant  from  the  Maheshkhali  LNG \nterminals,  the  project  will  significantly  contribute  to  reducing  the  gap  between  electricity  demand \nand supply in Bangladesh. \n\n9. \nWeak  institutional  capacity.  Technical and financial management of electricity utilities is \nlargely  based  on  traditional  practices,  with  limited  use  of  modern  management  techniques \n                                                \n6  Annual per capita consumption levels reported in 2015 by other countries in the region were as follows: Bhutan 3,039 \n\nkWh, India 800 kWh, Maldives 558 kWh, Sri Lanka 530 kWh, and Nepal 140 kWh. \n\n7  Government of Bangladesh; Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources; Power Division. 2016. Power System \n\n8  The  Rupsha  power  plant  is  designed  as  dual  fuel  plant. It will  operate  on  natural  gas as  the primary  fuel,  and  high-\n\nMaster Plan 2016. Dhaka. \n\nspeed diesel as an emergency backup fuel. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fsupported  by  information  management  systems.  This  leads  to  poor  resource  allocation  and \ninefficient  reporting.  Power  generation,  which  accounts  for  the  highest  share  of  the  cost  of \nelectricity,  needs  to  be  managed  by  specialists  with  hands-on  training  in  controlling  the  process \nflow  in  each  power  plant,  including  the  use  of  modern  power  plant  operations  simulators. \nOtherwise, power plant operator training is limited to classroom sessions and to trainings provided \nby power plant contractors during commissioning of new power plants. \n\n10. \nAsian  Development  Bank  sector  experience  and  assistance  program.  The  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  is  a  key  development  partner  in  the  energy  sector  of  Bangladesh  and \nhas  been  actively  supporting  investments  in  seven  broad  thematic  areas:  (i)  promoting  a \ncommercial  orientation  for  power  sector  entities,  (ii)  promoting  investments  in  power  generation, \n(iii)  removing  transmission  constraints,  (iv)  expanding  access  to  electricity,  (v)  increasing  gas \nproduction  capacity  and  mobilizing  investments  to  gas  production,  (vi)  improving  the  gas \ntransmission  and  distribution  network,  and  (vii)  improving  the  governance  and  regulatory \nframework.  ADB  has  strongly  contributed  to  promoting  far-reaching  energy  sector  reforms, \nespecially  in  the  power  sector  and  private  sector  participation.  Through  a  series  of  reform-linked \nprojects, ADB helped the government vertically unbundle the power sector entities and set of new \ncompanies  with  firm  commercial  bases  for  power  distribution,  transmission,  and  generation. \nFinancing  was  also  provided  for  the  newly  set  up  companies  to  increase  generation  capacity, \naugment  transmission  systems,  and  rehabilitate  distribution  networks.  Also,  ADB  interventions \nhave resulted in issuance of gas and electricity tariff regulations. \n\n11. \nPer covenants stipulated in the draft loan agreement for this project, ADB will continue its \npolicy dialogue with the government to pursue further reform actions to strengthen the gas pricing \npolicy and regular electricity tariff revisions with the active involvement of the Bangladesh Energy \nRegulatory  Commission.  The  project  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for \nBangladesh,  2016\u20132020, 9  supporting  the  government\u2019s  vision  of  higher,  more  inclusive,  and \nsustainable  economic  growth  and  investments  to  address  infrastructure  constraints.  The  country \npartnership strategy recognizes that achieving energy security through policy reforms is the key to \nachieving accelerated growth. The project also complements activities of other major development \npartners in Bangladesh.10 \n\n12. \nValue  added  by  ADB  assistance.  The  project  builds  upon ADB\u2019s  strong  and  sustained \npresence  in  the  power  sector  of  Bangladesh  and  embraces  ADB\u2019s  sector  knowledge  and \nsynergistic approach  in  developing  all  energy  subsectors.  Complementing ongoing  massive \ninvestments  in  transmission  and  distribution  infrastructure,  this  project  is  an  integral  part  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s plan to ensure energy security for its population. \n\n13. \nADB is a pioneer in harnessing clean and efficient power generation technology; the ADB-\nfinanced  project  design  will  ensure  that  the  Rupsha  power  plant  will  use  the  latest  proven \ncombined cycle technology, which offers the highest efficiency to convert gas to electricity. Further, \nthe power plant is designed to use the latest zero liquid discharge technology making it the first of \nits  kind \nthrough  capacity  building.  This \nproject will facilitate  operator  training  and will  finance  a  high-level  technology  power  plant \noperations  training  simulator  to  be  installed  at  NWPGCL.  The  project  will  also  finance  the \n\nin  Bangladesh. 11  ADB  will  also  add  value \n\n                                                \n9  ADB. 2016.

In  addition,  the  proposed  JFPR  grant \nunder  the  project  will  pilot  test  innovative  socially  inclusive  and  gender-sensitive  development \nprograms for communities in the project area (para. 18). Activities to be financed by the grant will \nfocus on vulnerable households and women, with a view to improving living standards.  \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n14. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  energy  security  improved,  and  electricity \nsupply increased.12 The project will have the following outcome: availability of efficient and cleaner \nenergy increased.13 \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n15. \nOutput 1: Efficient gas-fired power generation increased. This will be achieved through \nthe  design,  supply,  installation,  and  commissioning  of  the  new  Rupsha  800  MW  combined  cycle \npower plant. Combined cycle technology provides the best efficiency among all power-generating \ntechnologies. It enables the power plant to be built in stages, with the ability to commission the gas \nturbines  in  2  years,  which  is  useful  to  meet  the  ongoing  capacity  deficit  in  Bangladesh\u2019s  power \nsystem.  Khulna  city,  where  the  Rupsha  power  plant  will  be  based,  is  served  by  the  national  gas \ntransmission network, enabling domestic or imported gas to be readily supplied. \n\n16. \nOutput 2: Energy transfer systems upgraded. For gas supply to the Rupsha power plant, \nthe  project  will  construct  (i)  a  10-kilometer  (km),  24-inch  gas  distribution  pipeline  to  connect  the \nKhulna city gas station to the Rupsha power plant; and (ii) an additional 2 km, 20-inch gas pipeline \n(offtake)  from  the  Rupsha  power  plant  to  NWPGCL\u2019s  existing  225  MW  power  plant  at  Khulna, \nwhich  is  currently  operating  on  high-speed  diesel  (HSD).  The  project  will  replace  the  HSD  at  the \nKhulna  power  plant  and  provide  a  stable  gas  supply  for  its  operation,  resulting  in  significant \nenvironmental, economic, and financial benefits. To transfer generated electricity from the Rupsha \npower plant to the existing Khulna south grid substation, the project will  finance construction of a \n230-kilovolt  switchyard  at  the  Rupsha  power  plant  site  and  29  km  of  230-kilovolt  high-capacity \ndouble-circuit transmission lines. \n\n17. \nOutput  3:  Institutional  capacity  of  North-West  Power  Generation  Company  Limited \nstrengthened. This will be achieved through (i) implementation and operation of an ERP system; \n(ii) supply and installation of a universal power plant operations training simulator; and (iii) on-the-\njob  training  for  NWPGCL  staff  in  (a)  project  management,  implementation,  and  supervision;                \n(b)  monitoring  and  evaluation;  (c)  operation  and  maintenance;  (d)  environment  and  social \nsafeguards; (e) gender equity; and (f) effective project communications. \n\n18. \nOutput  4:  Socially  inclusive  development  of  communities  neighboring  the  project \nsite  pilot  tested.

The Rupsha power plant will be located 271 km southwest of Dhaka in \nKhulna  city.  The  power  plant  will  use  combined  cycle  gas  turbine  technology,  comprising  two \nidentical  generating  units,  each  nominally  rated  at  400 MW.  Combined  cycle  gas  turbine \ntechnology is the most efficient (the conversion efficiency of the power plant\u2019s two generating units \nis  estimated  to  be  57%  or  higher)  and  the  cleanest  fossil  fuel  power  generation  option  currently \navailable  in  the  market.  The  power  plant  is  designed  to  have  two  blocks  of  multi-shaft  1:1:1 \nconfiguration  comprising  one  gas  turbine,  one  heat  recovery  steam  generator,  and  one  steam \nturbine. \n\n28. \nThe Rupsha power plant is designed to operate on natural gas as the primary fuel and HSD \nas an emergency backup fuel. A net efficiency of 57% would require a gas flow rate of 113 million \ncubic  feet  per  day.  Allowing  provision  for  power  plant  sizing  above  800  MW  (depending  on  the \nsuccessful bidder\u2019s offered configuration), a provision of 125 million cubic feet per day (0.9 million \ntons  per  annum)  is  expected  to  be  allowed  for  gas  supply  infrastructure.  The  government  has \nprovided  written  assurance  to  supply  natural  gas  for  Rupsha  power  plant  operation.  ADB\u2019s  due \ndiligence  confirmed  that  the  government  will  commence  LNG  imports  within  2018  and  assessed \nthat the existing gas transmission network is adequate to deliver gas from LNG receiving facilities \nto the Rupsha power plant.21  \n\n                                                \n20 Consulting  services  to  prepare  a  comprehensive  project  feasibility  study  were  financed  by  ADB.  2012.

An  economic  analysis  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects.22 Results  indicate  an  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn  of  17.8%,  in  constant  2017  prices.  Given  a  hurdle  rate  of  9%,  the  project  is  deemed \neconomically viable. Without the Rupsha power plant, Bangladesh Power Development Board will \nhave  to  continue  with  ongoing  contracts  using  oil-fired  generation  to  meet  growing  demand. \nHowever, the proposed power plant running at 800 MW full capacity will generate 4,906 gigawatt-\nhours  of  electricity  every  year,  and  an  estimated  320  MW  of  oil-fired  generating  capacity  will  be \ndisplaced.  The  non-incremental  benefit  of  avoided  fuel  costs  and  the  environmental  benefit  of \navoided  carbon dioxide  emissions  were  calculated  based  on fuel type  of  displaced power  plants. \nThe remaining capacity (480 MW) will produce incremental outputs, valued using the willingness-\nto-pay methodology, and non-incremental outputs, valued at resource cost savings. \n\n30. \nFinancial viability. Following ADB's Guidelines on the Financial Management and Analysis \nof  Projects,  a  financial  cost\u2013benefit  analysis  was  carried  out  separately  for  outputs  1,  2,  and  3.23 \nFinancial viability was assessed by comparing the incremental costs and revenues over the life of \neach output. The electricity produced by the Rupsha power plant will be priced based on the power \npurchase agreement between NWPGCL and Bangladesh Power Development Board, which allows \nfull  cost  recovery  through  a tariff. The financial  internal rate  of return for  the  Rupsha  power  plant \nwas calculated in real terms on an after-tax basis using 2017 constant prices. Results (confirmed \nthrough sensitivity  analysis)  show  a rate  of return of  6.0%,  which is  above the  weighted  average \ncost of capital of 1.8%; the project is therefore deemed financially viable.24 \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n31. \nNWPGCL,  an  enterprise  of  Bangladesh  Power  Development  Board,  is  one  of  five  public \npower generation utilities in the country. NWPGCL was created in 2007 under the provision of the \nCompanies  Act,  1994  and  the  framework  of  the  Government  Power  Sector  Reforms  Policy \nsupported  by  ADB\u2019s  sector  development  program  loan.25 NWPGCL  is  one  of  the  fastest-growing \npower  companies  in  Bangladesh,  with  a  current  installed  generation  capacity  of  722  MW  and  an \naim to increase generation capacity by an additional 2,590 MW by 2022. \n\n32. \nNWPGCL  has  substantial  capacity  to  undertake  the  project,  as  it  has  been  the  executing \nand  implementing  agency  for  past  ADB-financed  projects.  NWPGCL  has  significant  capability  in \npublic  procurement,  as  well  as  extensive  knowledge  of  ADB\u2019s  procurement  processes  and \nregulations.  Procurement  capacity  risk  is  rated  low.26 The  financial  management  assessment  of \nNWPGCL concluded that it can fulfill ADB\u2019s fiduciary requirements, and financial management risk \nis  moderate.  However,  the  assessment  noted  that  NWPGCL  has  room  to  strengthen  its  overall \nfinancial  management  capacity  considering  the  future  development  agenda  of  the  company. \nNWPGCL  currently  uses  a  manual  information  reporting  system  and  accounting;  financing  and \nfixed  asset  records  are  kept  manually  using  spreadsheets.  To  upgrade  NWPGCL\u2019s  business \nprocesses,  ADB  will  support  implementation  of  the  ERP  system,  and  help  NWPGCL  build \nadditional financial management capacity. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwas  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  NWPGCL.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 15). \n                                                \n22 ADB. 2017.

The major benefit of the project is additional electricity supply to about \n300,000 consumers, which will promote business expansion and create employment opportunities \nfor  local  communities,  including  poor  and  socially  disadvantaged  people.  The  project  will  also \ncontribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  bringing  economic  and  livelihood  opportunities  to  the  area \naround the project site, and directly provide electricity in the project area. During construction, the \nproject  is  expected  to  generate  jobs  for  skilled  and  unskilled  laborers,  including  the  poor, \nvulnerable groups, and women. \n\n34. \nGender. The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming, and a gender action \nplan  has  been  prepared.  Key  design  features  are  (i)  providing  a  safe  and  inclusive  educational \nenvironment, (ii)  providing training for  safe  and efficient use  of  electricity  for school  teachers  and \nstudents,  (iii)  providing  technical  and  skills  training  to  expand  employment  and  livelihood \nopportunities,  and  (iv)  supporting  improved  social  and  gender  awareness  in  the  energy  sector. \nThese  activities,  supported  by  targets,  will  be  undertaken  with  a  focus  on  women.  ADB  will \nencourage NWPGCL to enhance women\u2019s recruitment in the energy sector. \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n35. \ncategories are as follows.28 \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),27 the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\n36. \nEnvironment  (category  A).  The  project  is  a  \u201cgreenfield\u201d  investment  in  fossil  fuel-based \npower generation, and the power plant is adjacent to the Bhairab River, which supports the globally \nendangered Ganges River dolphin. The Rupsha power plant will run annually for 5,632 hours using \nnatural gas and 500 hours using HSD. Following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and national \nregulations,  an  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  (including  biodiversity  assessment  and \nsurveys)  was  undertaken  and  is  presented  in  three  volumes,  one  for  each  component  of  the \nproject.29 Mitigation measures are proposed in the EIA and the environmental management plan to \nminimize environmental, health, and safety impacts resulting from air emission, effluent, noise, and \nwaste  from  the  project.  A  draft  EIA  was  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website  on  23  February  2018. \nNWPGCL  has  previously  implemented  ADB  projects  and  has  adequate  institutional  capacity  to \nmanage  environmental  risks.  External  monitoring  will  verify  the  information  submitted  to  ADB  by \nNWPGCL. A grievance redress mechanism has been established. The project management unit in \nNWPGCL  will  be  responsible  for  environmental  management  plan  implementation,  retaining  one \npermanent  safeguard  staff  member supported  by  national  and international  experts  to  strengthen \nthe capacity of NWPGCL. \n\n37. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B). Land acquisition for the project is not envisaged, \nand the impacts are therefore not considered significant. The Rupsha power plant will be located in \nthe abandoned Khulna Newsprint Mill complex, from which 20 hectares of government land will be \npurchased and transferred to NWPGCL. The construction of the 12 km gas pipeline will follow the \nexisting right-of-way of highways and roads, while the construction of the 29 km transmission line \nwill  temporarily  require  land under  right-of-way.  The  project  is  expected to affect  145  households \nwith  640  people,  but  the  impacts  are  mostly  temporary  and  not  considered  significant.  Mitigation \nmeasures and budgetary provisions are in place to provide compensation at replacement cost and \n                                                \n27 ADB and IDB agreed to follow ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n28  ADB.

NWPGCL  has  contracted  the  International  Union  for  Conservation  of  Nature  to  undertake  biodiversity \nassessment in the project area. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\frestore  livelihoods  commensurate  to  the  impacts.  The  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  in \ncompliance with the relevant government regulations and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and \nwas  disclosed on  ADB\u2019s  website on  5 March  2018. Given  its  experience,  NWPGCL can  properly \nimplement the resettlement plan. \n\nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).  Relevant  due  diligence  confirmed  that  no  indigenous \n\n38. \npeoples, as defined by ADB\u2019s Safeguards Policy Statement, are located in the project area. \n\nF. \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nSignificant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \n\n39. \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.30 \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nNon-availability of natural gas to \noperate the Rupsha power plant due to \ndelays in liquefied natural gas imports. \n\nPower transmission system constraints \nwill cause the Rupsha power plant to \nunderutilize its capacity. \n\nIncreases in prices of commodities and \nraw materials in the international \nmarket above projections and \ncontingencies could result in cost \noverrun and delay project completion. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nMitigation Measures \nInfrastructure to import liquefied natural gas is under construction, and the \ngovernment has given written assurance to allocate gas for the Rupsha power plant. \nThe government has already signed an agreement to import gas, which is expected to \nbe available within 2018, 2 years ahead of commissioning of the first gas turbines of \nthe Rupsha power plant. \nThe required infrastructure to evacuate power to the existing substation will be \nfinanced by the project.
