The project will support \nkey  policy  reforms  to  strengthen  polytechnic  education  through  an  integrated  approach \naddressing  the  priorities  of  equitable  access,  graduate  employment  outcomes,  subsector \nmanagement, and study program quality and relevance.2  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nWith the aim of achieving higher and more inclusive growth, and of expanding economic \ndevelopment  to  poorer  regions  across  Indonesia,  the  MP3EI  has  three  strategic  foci: \n(i) accelerating development in six economic corridors;3 (ii) improving national connectivity; and \ntechnology  capabilities,  which  are \n(iii)  strengthening  human  resources,  science,  and \nprerequisites to sustained, accelerated, and green growth. In light of current drivers of economic \ngrowth, investment plans, and estimated future industry demand in the six economic corridors, \nthe MP3EI prioritizes economic activities4 to achieve a \u201cself-sufficient, advanced, equitable, and \nprosperous  Indonesia.\u201d  To  generate  broad  employment  and  income-earning  opportunities  and \nimprove  productivity,  the  MP3EI  highlights  (i)  increasing  value  addition  and  expanding  value \nchains  for  industrial  production,  (ii)  strengthening  production  efficiency  and;  (iii)  promoting  an \ninnovation-driven  economy.  As  a  basic  principle  and  prerequisite  for  development  success, \nhuman resource development is deemed a vital driving force for economic growth. Indonesia\u2019s \npolytechnic  education  system,  which  includes  32  public  and  140  private  institutions,  is \nconsidered  a  significant  contributor  to  accelerating  the  shift  toward  a  knowledge-based \neconomy and the development of a productive workforce. The proposed project will support the \nMP3EI  policy  objectives  by  improving  access  to,  and  the  quality  and  relevance  of,  the \npolytechnic  system  to  deliver  improved  skills  that  meet  the  needs  of  employers  and  the \nemployment  aspirations  of  graduates.  The  project  will  provide  targeted  support  to  polytechnic \ninstitutions  in  six  economic  corridors  to  strengthen  their  capability  to  deliver  demand-driven, \nhigh-quality programs  related  to  five  main  sectors:  manufacturing,  infrastructure,  mining,  agro-\nindustry, and tourism. Assessments of investment plans and future demand lead the MP3EI to \nconclude that the demand for skilled labor will significantly increase in these sectors.  \n \nKey  features.  The  project  has  the  following  innovative  features:  (i)  it  facilitates \n4. \npartnerships  between  polytechnic  institutions  and  target  industry  employers  in  economic \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2    ADB.  2008.  Technical  Assistance  to  Republic  Indonesia  for  Preparing  the  Polytechnic  Education  Development \n\nProject (42099-012). Manila.  \n\n3  The government has identified the six economic corridors as Sumatera, Java, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Bali and Nusa \n\nTenggara, and Papua and Kepulauan Maluku. \n\n4  The  main  economic  activities  as  defined  in  the  MP3EI  can  be  clustered  into  eight  priority  areas:  tourism  and \nhospitality,  agriculture  and  fisheries,  resources  and  mineral  mining,  oil  and  gas, shipping  and  transportation, \ntextiles, food processing and beverage services, and manufacturing. The project will focus on five areas: tourism, \nagriculture, mining, manufacturing, and infrastructure.  \n\n\f2 \n\ncenters;  (ii) it  establishes  a  flexible  and  demand-driven  national  skills  fund  through  which  the \ngovernment can direct funding to public and private polytechnics in the six economic corridors to \ncontribute  to  achieving  MP3EI  objectives;  (iii)  it  implements  a  credit  transfer  system  and \nrecognition  of  prior  learning  in  the  Indonesian  Qualifications  Framework  (IQF);  and  (iv)  it \nintroduces a competitive mechanism and fosters an entrepreneurial culture, which will enhance \nmanagement capacity and create ownership in the project polytechnics. \n \n5. \nImproving  skills  in  the  labor  market.  Macroeconomic  and  political stability  has  freed \nIndonesia  to  perform  impressively  over  the  past  10  years.  Gross  domestic  product  growth \naccelerated  to  6.5%  in  2011,  with  further  acceleration  forecasted  for  2012\u20132014.  While \nIndonesia\u2019s economy is becoming more complex, shifting toward knowledge-based activity, the \nneed  for  human  resources  with  advanced  technological,  administrative,  and  managerial  skills \nhas become more pressing than ever. As a middle-income country, Indonesia is operating in an \nincreasingly  competitive  global  economy.  To  remain  viable  and  create  additional  employment, \nenterprises  need  to  improve  service  standards,  produce  better  products,  improve  work \norganization  and  technology  use,  and  build  value  chains  that  increase  local  content  and \notherwise capture value throughout the economy. However, an estimated 75% of jobholders in \nIndonesia  could  improve  enterprise  productivity  if  they  had  better  technical  skills.  Training  is \ndifficult  because  90%  of  workers  throughout  Indonesia  are  employed  by  micro  and  small \nenterprises employing fewer than six workers.5 While formal unemployment declined to 6.6% in \nAugust 2011, an estimated third of the workforce is underemployed, and 60% of the employed \npopulation  works \nlow \ncompetitiveness is considered a key constraint on growth and caused primarily by low skills and \nlow productivity in the workforce. The need for advanced skills has been identified by industry \nassociations in each of the five economic sectors to be supported under the project as critical to \nthe success of growth plans.6  \n \n6. \nPartnerships  between  polytechnics  and  industry.  The  government  considers \nexpanding and strengthening the polytechnic system as a key strategy for upgrading the skills of \nthe  workforce  to  better  serve  knowledge-intensive  and  technology-driven  industries  in  the  five \npriority  sectors  identified  by  the  MP3EI.  Currently,  the  country\u2019s  172  polytechnic  institutions \nhave only limited capacity to address growing demand for personnel with advanced skills. The \ngovernment has therefore earmarked additional funds to establish new polytechnics and expand \nthe  capacity  of  existing  institutions,  and  is  encouraging  the  growth  of  private  polytechnics. \nAccording to a recent survey by the Ministry of Education and Culture (MOEC),7 applications to \nenroll in polytechnic education programs exceed the current capacity of most public institutions. \nThe study states that more than 80% of graduates from the high-performing public polytechnics \nfind  jobs  within  3\u20136  months  after  graduation.  However,  feedback  from  employers  reveals  that \nmany graduates need to be retrained as their knowledge and skills do not match those required \nin  the  workplace.  Although  demand  for  skilled  labor  is  growing  quickly,  many  graduates  of \nweaker polytechnics\u2014most of them private but some public\u2014search for 12 months or longer to \nfind  employment  because  training  programs  are  outdated  and/or  suffer  poor  teaching  and \nlearning  environments.  At  present,  a  common  challenge  of  polytechnic  education  is  limited \nindustry involvement,8 which fails to correct the poor quality and relevance of training courses, \nand a lack of clear national standards to guide study programs and assessment. Many lecturers \n\ninformal  establishments  performing \n\njobs.  Firms\u2019 \n\nlow-skilled \n\nin \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB, ILO, IDB. 2010.

Jakarta. \n\nUnpublished.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nof  weaker  polytechnic  institutions  have  little  workplace  experience,  which  makes  it  difficult  for \nthem  to  prepare  their  students  for  the  world  of  work.  The  lack  or  obsolescence  of  equipment \nwith which to simulate the workplace with practical demonstration and application hampers the \nquality  of  the  teaching  and  learning  process  in  many  underfunded  polytechnic  institutes.  To \naddress  these  challenges,  the  project  will  foster  partnerships  between  polytechnics  and \nemployers to jointly develop curricula to impart the skills needed in the workplace, create flexible \nmechanisms  with  active  industry  participation  to  regularly  adapt  training  programs  to  new \nbusiness  circumstances,  and  prepare  flexible  graduates  who  are  able  to  adjust  quickly  to \nchanging demands in the labor market. Study programs will be aligned with industry standards \nto enable industry to judge if graduates possess the skills that meet standards of practice and \nthe  quality  requirements  of  industry.  Standards  to  be  adopted  in  the  project  will  be  registered \nwith  the  National  Agency  for  Professional  Certification  and  aligned  with  outcomes  and \ndescriptors in the IQF.9  \n \n7. \nGovernment  plans.  The  project  will  support  Indonesia\u2019s  economic  development  as  \ndetailed  in  the  MP3EI  by  increasing  the  supply  of  highly  skilled  workers  in  five  sectors  of  the \neconomy. This will be facilitated by improving links between polytechnics and enterprises. Well-\neducated  technicians  are  essential  to  enabling  the  transition  to  higher-technology  jobs  and \nincreasing  the  value  of  production.  Striving  for  higher  productivity  and  competitiveness,  the \ngovernment has strengthened its emphasis on developing technical and vocational education in \ngeneral, which is reflected in enhanced investments in polytechnic education as stipulated in the \nMOEC\u2019s  strategic  plan,  2010\u20132014.  The  project  will  help  the  Directorate  General  for  Higher \nEducation  (DGHE)  implement  an  integrated  approach  to  improve  the  quality  of  polytechnic \nstudy  programs  and  skills-development  services  that  (i)  ensures  relevance  to  employers,  (ii) \nexpands  access  for  vocational  school  graduates  and  others  interested  in  developing  higher-\nlevel  skills,  (iii)  builds  the  capacity  of  teaching  staff  and  administrators,  and  (iv)  upgrades \nfacilities and equipment to better impart to learners job-ready skills. The project will strengthen \nand  implement  the  IQF  to  support  quality  assurance  and  recognize  prior  learning  to  expand \napplicants\u2019  access  to  high-quality  skills-development  services  available  through  selected \npolytechnic institutions. \n \n8. \nLink  with  the  country  partnership  strategy.  The  project  is  included  in  the  country \npartnership strategy (CPS) 2012\u20132014 and country operation business plan 2012 of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and addresses four outcomes in the results framework. The country \npartnership  strategy  has  identified  strengthening  polytechnic  education  as  a  core  approach  to \ncontribute to inclusive economic growth. The outcomes of the CPS to be addressed through this \nproject  are  to  (i)  make  postsecondary  and  higher  education  more  efficient,  effective,  and \nresponsive  to  the  needs  of  the  labor  market;  (ii)  improve  policy  coordination  and  the \nmanagement  of  polytechnic  institutions;  (iii)  establish  a  strategy  that  develops  critical  skills  for \nnational  development;  and  (iv)  increase  the  participation  of  employers  in  delivering  and \nassessing  polytechnic  training  programs.  The  project  is  consistent  with  ADB's  education \nstrategies and with Strategy 2020.10 Project activities adopt the findings of ADB\u2019s good practice \nguide for technical and vocational education and training.11 \n \n\n                                                 \n9  The government approved the IQF in January 2012 through Presidential Decree No. 8/2012.   \n10  ADB.  2008.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n9. \nThe  impact  will  be  the  polytechnic  education  to  produce  graduates  responsive  to  the \nneeds of the labor market and contribute toward increasing productivity in the Priority Sectors. \nThe  outcome  will  be  polytechnic  education  aligned  with  the  MP3EI  strategy  in  five  priority \neconomic sectors. The performance targets are (i) the number of polytechnic students enrolled \nin study programs in the five priority sectors increased by 25%, with at least 30% of students \nbeing female, and (ii) the number of polytechnic graduates finding relevant employment within 6 \nmonths  of  graduation  increased  by  25%  in  five  priority  sectors,  including  at  least  a  15% \nincrease for women.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n10. \nThe  project  will  deliver  four  outputs:  (i)  the  improved  quality  and  relevance  of  the \npolytechnic  system;  (ii)  expanded  and  more  equitable  access  to  polytechnic  institutions;  (iii) \ngreater  private  sector  involvement  in,  and  promotion  of,  entrepreneurial  culture  to  strengthen \npolytechnic  graduate  competitiveness;  and  (iv)  strengthened  governance  and  management  of \npolytechnic education. To achieve these four outputs, the project will provide targeted support to \n13  polytechnic  institutions  in  selected  economic  centers  of  the  six  corridors  established  under \nthe  MP3EI.12  These  selected  polytechnics  will  work  in  partnership  with  industry  to  provide \ndemand-driven  examples  of  improved  quality  and  relevance  in  study  programs,  responding  to \ndemand  in  each  economic  corridor,  so  that  these  successful  approaches  can  be  replicated \nacross the country. The 13 project polytechnics will receive assistance to upgrade their learning \nand  teaching  environments,  as  well  as  staff  development  and  research  strengthening  toward \ntheir  becoming  centers  of  excellence  in  their  respective  economic  corridors.  In  addition  to \nsupport  provided  to  the  13  preselected  polytechnics,  the  project  will  establish  a  flexible  and \ndemand-driven national skills fund (NSF).13 The NSF will provide a number of windows in each \neconomic corridor through which polytechnic institutions can, in collaboration with their industry \npartners,  access  resources  with  which  to  upgrade  their  teaching  and  learning  environments, \nstrengthen their lecturers\u2019 professional development, and improve study programs in response \nto regional labor market demand and the objectives of the MP3EI. The project will provide $38.1 \nmillion for the NSF. \n \n11. \nOutput  1:  Improved  quality  and  relevance  of  the  polytechnic  system.  Under  this \noutput the project will provide assistance to (i) strengthen standards and learning outcomes in \ncollaboration  with  industry  and  align  revised  study  programs  with  the  IQF,  with  industry \nstandards guiding the development and improvement of curricula to address skills requirements \nin  the  five  main  economic  areas;  (ii)  upgrade  lecturer  skills  through  programs  delivered  in \npartnership  with  international  polytechnics  and  through  industry  placements;  (iii)  revise \naccreditation, assessment, and quality assurance systems to improve the quality of polytechnic \nprograms and ensure their alignment with IQF policies and guidelines; (iv) improve teaching and \nlearning  environments  and  equipment  in  13  preselected  polytechnic  institutions  to  reflect  the \nskills industry needs; (v) actively engage and partner with industry to improve the quality of skills \nby  implementing  skills  development  activities  funded  through  the  NSF;  and  (vi)  initiate  the \ndevelopment of advanced degree programs in applied sciences and technology.  \n \n\n                                                 \n12 MOEC  has  selected  13  polytechnics  to  receive  special  assistance  from  the  project.

A  project  steering  committee,  chaired  by  the  deputy  minister  for \nthe  National  Planning  Development  Agency \nhuman  resources  and  cultural  affairs  of \n(BAPPENAS)  and  co-chaired  by  the  director  general  of  higher  education  in  MOEC,  will \nsupervise the project and provide strategic guidance. A project management unit (PMU) will be \nestablished  by  DGHE  under  the  guidance  of  the  project  director,  who  will  be  the  director  of \nlearning  and  student  affairs  in  DGHE.  The  PMU  will  be  headed  by  a  project  manager  and \nresponsible  for  day-to-day  project  administration,  planning  and  budgeting,  procurement, \ndisbursement, monitoring, and reporting. The PMU will have at least seven permanent staff and \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nthe \n\nimplementation  arrangements,  which  are \n\nfive  support  staff.  Table  3  summarizes \ndocumented in detail in the PAM. \n \n18. \nTo appraise proposals submitted by polytechnics to be financed under the NSF and to \nrecommend which proposals to support, the executing agency will establish a review committee \nwithin  3  months  after  loan  effectiveness.  The  committee  will  consist  of  at  least  20  qualified \nexperts and representatives from companies or industry associations in the five economic areas \nsupported by the project, MOEC, and polytechnics. Guidelines for the operation of the NSF and \nthe proposed assessment process are in Appendix 7 of the PAM. \n \n19. \nAt each polytechnic supported by the project, a project implementation unit (PIU) will be \nestablished with responsibility for implementing approved project activities under the supervision \nand management of the polytechnic director. A PIU manager will be responsible for day-to-day \nimplementation. Each project polytechnic institution will assign to the PIU adequate secretarial, \nfinance, and procurement staff, as well as a program coordinator and data officer for monitoring \nand evaluation, to ensure smooth implementation. The PIU manager will prepare reports to the \npolytechnic director, who will report in turn to the PMU. The project will provide capacity building \nto PMU and PIU members. Section 3 of the PAM details the terms of reference for the project \nsteering committee, PMU, and PIUs.  \n \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nProject management \n(i)   Oversight body \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements\n2 January 2013\u221231 December 2017 \n\nProject steering committee  \nDeputy minister for human resources and cultural affairs, BAPPENAS (chair); \nDirector general, DGHE (cochair);  \nMOEC, Ministry of Finance, BAPPENAS, Ministry of Manpower and Transmigration, \nprivate sector (KADIN & other industry associations as ad hoc members) (members) \nDGHE, MOEC \n\n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)   Key implementing agency  13 polytechnic institutions \n(iv)  Project management unit \nProcurement \n\nPMU, DGHE: 7 permanent staff and 5 support staff \nICB & NCB \nMultiple contracts \nShopping & direct contracting  Multiple contracts \nQCBS, CQS, and ICS \n\nConsulting services \n\nSocial marketing campaign \n3 studies  \nAdvance procurement action   Consultants for the capacity development program, procurement specialist, and \n\nCQS \nCQS, ICS \n\n$0.55 million \n$1.40 million \n\n259 person-months national and \n3 person-months international \nMultiple contracts \nMultiple contracts \n\n$51.25 million \n$5.00 million \n$2.20 million \n\nDisbursement \n\nfinance expert  \nLoan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2012 as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed \nupon between the government and ADB. \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  BAPPENAS  =  National  Planning  Development  Agency,  CQS  =  consultants' \nqualifications  selection,  DGHE  =  Directorate  General  of  Higher  Education,  ICB  =  international  competitive  bidding, \nICS = individual consultant selection, KADIN = Chamber of Commerce, MOEC = Ministry of Education and Culture, \nNCB = national competitive bidding, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n20. \nthe \nrecruitment of consultants, establish procurement and disbursement systems for the PMU and \nPIUs,  and  ensure  that  they  comply  with  ADB  requirements.

Employers \nwill  benefit  from  improvements  to  the  quality  and  relevance  of  polytechnic  education,  as \nimproved  skills  directly  link  to  improving  workplace  productivity,  product  quality,  and  service \nstandards.  Improving  the  quality  and  relevance  of  study  programs  will  build  community  and \nindustry  confidence  in  the  vocational  education  system  and  strengthen  this  pathway  toward \nexpanding  meaningful  employment.  Greater  access  for  women  to  polytechnic  education \nresulting  from  initiatives  such  as  the  NSF  will  ensure  that  the  benefits  of  high-quality  skills \ndevelopment  are  shared.  Female  students  and  poor  students  will  capture  a  significant \nproportion of the direct benefits thanks to the project's gender and pro-poor targets detailed in \nthe  design  and  monitoring  framework  (Appendix  1).  The  lecturer  development  program  will \nenable  39  lecturers  to  improve  their  skills,  initially  overseas,  while  the  project  supports  the \ndevelopment of a local master\u2019s program designed to support the long-term development needs \nof polytechnic lecturers and instructors.  \n \nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n22. \nEconomic benefits. Modernizing polytechnic education will contribute to improving the \nproductivity  and  competitiveness  of  Indonesian  industry  and  promote  inclusive  growth.  The \ndirect  economic  benefits  from  the  project  will  flow  from  the  increased  numbers  of  polytechnic \ngraduates who find direct employment. Based on conservative assumptions, such targeted skills \ndevelopment  can  increase  monthly  wages  by  Rp2,000,000.  Estimating  these  benefits  over  20 \nyears and based on the total project cost of $92.60 million yields an economic internal rate of \nreturn of 17.2%. Other external benefits of the project that will most likely accrue to society at \nlarge, and not just the direct beneficiaries of the project, are (i) improvements in the provision of \nhigh-quality  skills-development  services  at  selected  polytechnic  institutions  filtering  into  other \nvocational  training  providers  and  thereby  improving  the  value  of  the  sector  to  industry;  (ii) \nimproved responsiveness of the polytechnic education system improving the relevance of skills \nand  employment  outcomes  of  graduates;  (iii)  heightened  efficiencies  in  project  polytechnic \ninstitutions  resulting  from  improved  governance  and  capacity  improvement  and  regulatory \nreforms  under  the  project  supporting  other  polytechnic  providers  seeking  to  work  closely  with \nindustry;  and  (iv)  improved  gender  distribution  in  polytechnic  institutions  as  a  consequence  of \nactivities in the gender action plan creating additional choice and opportunity for women seeking \nemployment,  particularly  in  the  five  priority  industry  sectors.  The  project  will  raise  polytechnic \neducation quality, relevance, and efficiency in project polytechnics reaching 20% of polytechnic \nstudents.  \n\n \nFinancial  sustainability.  The  project  should  be  financially  sustainable,  as  the  bulk  of   \n\n23. \nexpenditures do not continue beyond the end of the project. Recurrent expenditures such as on \nequipment  maintenance  can  be  absorbed  using  additional  revenues  from  government  funding, \nstudent fees, and tailored training for enterprises. The project will increase the relevance of the \npolytechnic system to the labor market and improve the policy framework governing polytechnic \ninstitutions,  which  together  will  improve  the  sustainability  of  polytechnics  by  enabling  them  to \nbetter serve national social and economic development needs. Efficiency gains in the 13 project \npolytechnics  will  be  realized  in  part  through  increased  enrollment  and  the  resulting  higher \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nutilization of facilities and equipment. The government\u2019s annual commitment to the project as a \npercentage  of  the  total  education  budget  is  projected  to  increase  from  0.03%  in  year  1  of  the \nproject  to  0.7%  in  year  3  and  to  decline  to  0.03%  in  year  5.  The  government\u2019s  annual \ncommitment for the project is therefore deemed affordable.  \n\n \nGovernance \n\nB. \n\n24. \nAssessment  of  financial  management  and  procurement  capacity  found  the  DGHE  to \nhave extensive capacity to carry out the project, as it has implemented numerous internationally \nfunded  projects  since  1980.  The  financial  management  assessment  found  sufficient  capacity \nand  staffing  in  the  accounting  and  finance  section  of  MOEC's  DGHE.  The  Integrated  Chart  of \nAccounts  is  consistent  with  international  accounting  standards.  The  PMU  will  prepare \ngovernment  financial  reports  according  to  the  government  financial  information  system  and \nsubmit them to ADB, the Ministry of Finance, and MOEC. Of particular concern, however, is the \nlack  of  standardization  in  the  use  of  accounting  systems  and  software  across  polytechnic \ninstitutions.  The  project  will  help  project  polytechnics  to  undertake  the  financial  reporting \ndemanded  under  the  project\u2019s  financial  compliance  requirements.  The  executing  agency  will \nprovide accounting staff for the PMU; train PMU staff in financial planning, accounting, auditing, \nand control; and implement a performance-based planning and budgeting system. The PMU will \nlikewise  ensure  proper  monitoring,  particularly  of  the  activities  funded  through  the  NSF.  The \nfinancial management assessment questionnaire is in the PAM.  \n \n25. \ndiscussed with the government. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. \n \nC. \n\nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and    \n\nPoverty and Social  \n\nGender  and  development.  The  project \n\n26. \nis  categorized  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming.  It  includes  elements  that  address  key  constraints  on  female  participation  in \npolytechnic education and includes a gender action plan. The key gender issues addressed by \nthe  project  include  (i)  females\u2019  limited  access  to  untraditional,  high-quality  skills-development \nprograms; (ii) their access to technical training constrained by the costs of education and living \nexpenses; (iii) lack of knowledge related to the range of study programs and career prospects \nfor  females  in  male-dominant  skills  areas;  (iv)  academic  barriers  to  polytechnic  education  for \nlack  of  recognition  of  practical  experience  and  prior  learning;  and  (v)  inadequate  incentives, \nincluding  equity  strategies  and  scholarships,  to  encourage more  females  to  enter untraditional \nsectors.  The  gender  action  plan  includes  the  following  targets  and  gender-responsive  design \nfeatures: (i) 30% of the short courses developed through the Project target the study programs \nthat  benefit  female;  (ii) 30%  quota  of  the  internships  or  industry  placements  in  the  priority \nsectors will be for female; (iii) at least a 15% increase in female polytechnic graduates entering \nthe workforce by 2016; (iv) 4,800 female students tested and certified to endorsed standards in \nthe  priority  skills  areas  by  2016;  (v)  assurance  that  each  proposal  submitted  to  the  NSF  is \nevaluated  in  terms  of  its  contribution  to  gender  equity  and  achieving  project  targets;  (vi) \nallocation of 20% of project-supported scholarships to females; (vii) 20% of the lecturers trained \nbeing female; (viii) 20% of  the management and staff in the Project Executing Agency and the \nSelected Polytechnics Institutions who are trained on technical and management skills to meet \nindustry  standards  shall  be  female;  (ix)  the  implementation  of  a  social  marketing  campaign  to \npromote  female  participation  and  mobilize  employers  to  recruit  women  in  untraditional  trades; \nand (x) the development of a gender strategy for the DGHE\u2019s support to the polytechnic sector.  \n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n27. \nIn accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is category C \nfor impacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. The project \nactivities  will  require  neither  land  acquisition  nor  resettlement.  No  specific  activities  will  be \ndirectly targeted to indigenous peoples.  \n\nE. \n\nRisk and Mitigating Measures \n\n28.        Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.16  \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nOutcome \nThe government will not support \nemployer engagement in \npolytechnic development. \n\nMitigating Measures\n \nThe project will, with the assistance of local employers, engage in a dialogue with \nthe MOEC, citing successful international examples and arguing the necessity of \nemployer engagement toward improving study program quality and relevance. \n\nPolytechnic training and careers \nare undervalued in the market. \n\nOutputs \nIndustry support and \nparticipation in the program is \nnot secured. \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nAs the project begins to produce graduates with employable skills, the public \nimage of the polytechnics will improve. Success stories will be communicated to \nthe public, and social marketing will increase demand for graduates.  \nThe project will capitalize on positive examples of industry partnerships and build \non the successful programs established by some polytechnics. Needs analysis \nand skills mapping techniques will be developed in project polytechnics to ensure \nthe relevance of study programs to employer needs. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the project will conform to all \n29. \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  and  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as  described  in  detail  in  the \nproject  administration  manual  and  loan  documents.
