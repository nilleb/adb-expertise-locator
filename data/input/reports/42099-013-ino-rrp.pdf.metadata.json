I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Indonesia for the Polytechnic Education Development Project.1  \n \n2.  The project will improve the quality and relevance of polytechnic education to support \nworkforce  development  in  line  with  employers\u2019  needs  in  five  priority  industry  subsectors \nidentified  as  critical  to  the  success  of  the  government\u2019s  Master  Plan  for  Acceleration  and \nExpansion of Indonesia\u2019s Economic Development (MP3EI), 2011\u20132025. The project will support \nkey  policy  reforms  to  strengthen  polytechnic  education  through  an  integrated  approach \naddressing  the  priorities  of  equitable  access,  graduate  employment  outcomes,  subsector \nmanagement, and study program quality and relevance.2  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  With the aim of achieving higher and more inclusive growth, and of expanding economic \ndevelopment  to  poorer  regions  across  Indonesia,  the  MP3EI  has  three  strategic  foci: \n(i) accelerating development in six economic corridors;3 (ii) improving national connectivity; and \n(iii)  strengthening  human  resources,  science,  and  technology  capabilities,  which  are \nprerequisites to sustained, accelerated, and green growth. In light of current drivers of economic \ngrowth, investment plans, and estimated future industry demand in the six economic corridors, \nthe MP3EI prioritizes economic activities4 to achieve a \u201cself-sufficient, advanced, equitable, and \nprosperous Indonesia.\u201d To generate broad employment and income-earning opportunities and \nimprove productivity, the MP3EI highlights (i) increasing value addition and expanding value \nchains for industrial production, (ii) strengthening production efficiency and; (iii) promoting an \ninnovation-driven economy. As a basic principle and prerequisite for development success, \nhuman resource development is deemed a vital driving force for economic growth. Indonesia\u2019s \npolytechnic  education  system,  which  includes  32  public  and  140  private  institutions,  is \nconsidered  a  significant  contributor  to  accelerating  the  shift  toward  a  knowledge-based \neconomy and the development of a productive workforce. The proposed project will support the \nMP3EI  policy  objectives  by  improving  access  to,  and  the  quality  and  relevance  of,  the \npolytechnic  system  to  deliver  improved  skills  that  meet  the  needs  of  employers  and  the \nemployment aspirations of graduates. The project will provide targeted support to polytechnic \ninstitutions in six economic corridors to strengthen their capability to deliver demand-driven, \nhigh-quality programs related to five main sectors: manufacturing, infrastructure, mining, agro-\nindustry, and tourism. Assessments of investment plans and future demand lead the MP3EI to \nconclude that the demand for skilled labor will significantly increase in these sectors.  \n \n4.  Key  features.  The  project  has  the  following  innovative  features:  (i)  it  facilitates \npartnerships  between  polytechnic  institutions  and  target  industry  employers  in  economic \n                                                 \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to Republic Indonesia for Preparing the Polytechnic Education Development \nProject (42099-012). Manila.  \n3  The government has identified the six economic corridors as Sumatera, Java, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Bali and Nusa \nTenggara, and Papua and Kepulauan Maluku. \n4  The main economic activities as defined in the MP3EI can be clustered into eight priority areas: tourism and \nhospitality, agriculture and fisheries, resources and mineral mining, oil and gas, shipping and transportation, \ntextiles, food processing and beverage services, and manufacturing. The project will focus on five areas: tourism, \nagriculture, mining, manufacturing, and infrastructure.  \n ", "2 \ncenters; (ii) it establishes a flexible and demand-driven national skills fund through which the \ngovernment can direct funding to public and private polytechnics in the six economic corridors to \ncontribute  to  achieving  MP3EI  objectives;  (iii)  it  implements  a  credit  transfer  system  and \nrecognition  of  prior  learning  in  the  Indonesian  Qualifications  Framework  (IQF);  and  (iv)  it \nintroduces a competitive mechanism and fosters an entrepreneurial culture, which will enhance \nmanagement capacity and create ownership in the project polytechnics. \n \n5.  Improving skills in the labor market. Macroeconomic and political stability has freed \nIndonesia to perform impressively over the past 10 years. Gross domestic product growth \naccelerated  to  6.5%  in  2011,  with  further  acceleration  forecasted  for  2012\u20132014.  While \nIndonesia\u2019s economy is becoming more complex, shifting toward knowledge-based activity, the \nneed for human resources with advanced technological, administrative, and managerial skills \nhas become more pressing than ever. As a middle-income country, Indonesia is operating in an \nincreasingly competitive global economy. To remain viable and create additional employment, \nenterprises  need  to  improve  service  standards,  produce  better  products,  improve  work \norganization  and  technology  use,  and  build  value  chains  that  increase  local  content  and \notherwise capture value throughout the economy. However, an estimated 75% of jobholders in \nIndonesia could improve enterprise productivity if they had better technical skills. Training is \ndifficult  because  90%  of  workers  throughout  Indonesia  are  employed  by  micro  and  small \nenterprises employing fewer than six workers.5 While formal unemployment declined to 6.6% in \nAugust 2011, an estimated third of the workforce is underemployed, and 60% of the employed \npopulation  works  in  informal  establishments  performing  low-skilled  jobs.  Firms\u2019  low \ncompetitiveness is considered a key constraint on growth and caused primarily by low skills and \nlow productivity in the workforce. The need for advanced skills has been identified by industry \nassociations in each of the five economic sectors to be supported under the project as critical to \nthe success of growth plans.6  \n \n6.  Partnerships  between  polytechnics  and  industry.  The  government  considers \nexpanding and strengthening the polytechnic system as a key strategy for upgrading the skills of \nthe workforce to better serve knowledge-intensive and technology-driven industries in the five \npriority sectors identified by the MP3EI. Currently, the country\u2019s 172 polytechnic institutions \nhave only limited capacity to address growing demand for personnel with advanced skills. The \ngovernment has therefore earmarked additional funds to establish new polytechnics and expand \nthe capacity of existing institutions, and is encouraging the growth of private polytechnics. \nAccording to a recent survey by the Ministry of Education and Culture (MOEC),7 applications to \nenroll in polytechnic education programs exceed the current capacity of most public institutions. \nThe study states that more than 80% of graduates from the high-performing public polytechnics \nfind jobs within 3\u20136 months after graduation. However, feedback from employers reveals that \nmany graduates need to be retrained as their knowledge and skills do not match those required \nin the workplace. Although demand for skilled labor is growing quickly, many graduates of \nweaker polytechnics\u2014most of them private but some public\u2014search for 12 months or longer to \nfind  employment  because  training programs  are  outdated  and/or  suffer  poor  teaching  and \nlearning environments. At present, a common challenge of polytechnic education is limited \nindustry involvement,8 which fails to correct the poor quality and relevance of training courses, \nand a lack of clear national standards to guide study programs and assessment. Many lecturers \n                                                 \n5  ADB, ILO, IDB. 2010.  Indonesia Critical Development Constraints\u2019 Country Diagnostics Studies Series. \n6  A detailed description of skills identified by employers is provided in Appendix 6 of the Project Administration \nManual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n7  Government of Indonesia, Directorate General of Higher Education. 2010.

Jakarta. \n ", "  3\nof weaker polytechnic institutions have little workplace experience, which makes it difficult for \nthem to prepare their students for the world of work. The lack or obsolescence of equipment \nwith which to simulate the workplace with practical demonstration and application hampers the \nquality of the teaching and learning process in many underfunded polytechnic institutes. To \naddress  these  challenges,  the  project  will  foster  partnerships  between  polytechnics  and \nemployers to jointly develop curricula to impart the skills needed in the workplace, create flexible \nmechanisms  with  active  industry  participation  to  regularly  adapt  training  programs  to  new \nbusiness  circumstances,  and  prepare  flexible  graduates  who  are  able  to  adjust  quickly  to \nchanging demands in the labor market. Study programs will be aligned with industry standards \nto enable industry to judge if graduates possess the skills that meet standards of practice and \nthe quality requirements of industry. Standards to be adopted in the project will be registered \nwith  the  National  Agency  for  Professional  Certification  and  aligned  with  outcomes  and \ndescriptors in the IQF.9  \n \n7.  Government plans. The project will support Indonesia\u2019s economic development as  \ndetailed in the MP3EI by increasing the supply of highly skilled workers in five sectors of the \neconomy. This will be facilitated by improving links between polytechnics and enterprises. Well-\neducated technicians are essential to enabling the transition to higher-technology jobs and \nincreasing the value of production. Striving for higher productivity and competitiveness, the \ngovernment has strengthened its emphasis on developing technical and vocational education in \ngeneral, which is reflected in enhanced investments in polytechnic education as stipulated in the \nMOEC\u2019s strategic plan, 2010\u20132014. The project will help the Directorate General for Higher \nEducation (DGHE) implement an integrated approach to improve the quality of polytechnic \nstudy programs and skills-development services that (i) ensures relevance to employers, (ii) \nexpands access for vocational school graduates and others interested in developing higher-\nlevel skills, (iii) builds the capacity of teaching staff and administrators, and (iv) upgrades \nfacilities and equipment to better impart to learners job-ready skills. The project will strengthen \nand implement the IQF to support quality assurance and recognize prior learning to expand \napplicants\u2019  access  to  high-quality  skills-development  services  available  through  selected \npolytechnic institutions. \n \n8.  Link with the country partnership strategy. The project is included in the country \npartnership strategy (CPS) 2012\u20132014 and country operation business plan 2012 of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and addresses four outcomes in the results framework. The country \npartnership strategy has identified strengthening polytechnic education as a core approach to \ncontribute to inclusive economic growth. The outcomes of the CPS to be addressed through this \nproject  are  to  (i)  make  postsecondary  and  higher  education  more  efficient,  effective,  and \nresponsive  to  the  needs  of  the  labor  market;  (ii)  improve  policy  coordination  and  the \nmanagement of polytechnic institutions; (iii) establish a strategy that develops critical skills for \nnational  development;  and  (iv)  increase  the  participation  of  employers  in  delivering  and \nassessing  polytechnic  training  programs.  The  project  is  consistent  with  ADB's  education \nstrategies and with Strategy 2020.10 Project activities adopt the findings of ADB\u2019s good practice \nguide for technical and vocational education and training.11 \n \n                                                 \n9  The government approved the IQF in January 2012 through Presidential Decree No. 8/2012.   \n10  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n ", "4 \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be the polytechnic education to produce graduates responsive to the \nneeds of the labor market and contribute toward increasing productivity in the Priority Sectors. \nThe outcome will be polytechnic education aligned with the MP3EI strategy in five priority \neconomic sectors. The performance targets are (i) the number of polytechnic students enrolled \nin study programs in the five priority sectors increased by 25%, with at least 30% of students \nbeing female, and (ii) the number of polytechnic graduates finding relevant employment within 6 \nmonths  of  graduation  increased  by  25%  in  five  priority  sectors,  including  at  least  a  15% \nincrease for women.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n10.  The  project  will  deliver  four  outputs:  (i)  the  improved  quality  and  relevance  of  the \npolytechnic system; (ii) expanded and more equitable access to polytechnic institutions; (iii) \ngreater private sector involvement in, and promotion of, entrepreneurial culture to strengthen \npolytechnic graduate competitiveness; and (iv) strengthened governance and management of \npolytechnic education. To achieve these four outputs, the project will provide targeted support to \n13 polytechnic institutions in selected economic centers of the six corridors established under \nthe MP3EI.12 These selected polytechnics will work in partnership with industry to provide \ndemand-driven examples of improved quality and relevance in study programs, responding to \ndemand in each economic corridor, so that these successful approaches can be replicated \nacross the country. The 13 project polytechnics will receive assistance to upgrade their learning \nand teaching environments, as well as staff development and research strengthening toward \ntheir becoming centers of excellence in their respective economic corridors. In addition to \nsupport provided to the 13 preselected polytechnics, the project will establish a flexible and \ndemand-driven national skills fund (NSF).13 The NSF will provide a number of windows in each \neconomic corridor through which polytechnic institutions can, in collaboration with their industry \npartners, access resources with which to upgrade their teaching and learning environments, \nstrengthen their lecturers\u2019 professional development, and improve study programs in response \nto regional labor market demand and the objectives of the MP3EI. The project will provide $38.1 \nmillion for the NSF. \n \n11.  Output 1: Improved quality and relevance of the polytechnic system. Under this \noutput the project will provide assistance to (i) strengthen standards and learning outcomes in \ncollaboration  with  industry  and  align  revised  study  programs  with  the  IQF,  with  industry \nstandards guiding the development and improvement of curricula to address skills requirements \nin the five main economic areas; (ii) upgrade lecturer skills through programs delivered in \npartnership  with  international  polytechnics  and  through  industry  placements;  (iii)  revise \naccreditation, assessment, and quality assurance systems to improve the quality of polytechnic \nprograms and ensure their alignment with IQF policies and guidelines; (iv) improve teaching and \nlearning environments and equipment in 13 preselected polytechnic institutions to reflect the \nskills industry needs; (v) actively engage and partner with industry to improve the quality of skills \nby implementing skills development activities funded through the NSF; and (vi) initiate the \ndevelopment of advanced degree programs in applied sciences and technology.  \n \n                                                 \n12 MOEC has selected 13 polytechnics to receive special assistance from the project.

Implementation Arrangements  \n17.  The DGHE of the MOEC will be the executing agency, responsible for implementing and \nmonitoring project activities. A project steering committee, chaired by the deputy minister for \nhuman  resources  and  cultural  affairs  of  the  National  Planning  Development  Agency \n(BAPPENAS)  and  co-chaired  by  the  director  general  of  higher  education  in  MOEC,  will \nsupervise the project and provide strategic guidance. A project management unit (PMU) will be \nestablished by DGHE under the guidance of the project director, who will be the director of \nlearning and student affairs in DGHE. The PMU will be headed by a project manager and \nresponsible  for  day-to-day  project  administration,  planning  and  budgeting,  procurement, \ndisbursement, monitoring, and reporting. The PMU will have at least seven permanent staff and \n ", "  7\nfive  support  staff.  Table  3  summarizes  the  implementation  arrangements,  which  are \ndocumented in detail in the PAM. \n \n18.  To appraise proposals submitted by polytechnics to be financed under the NSF and to \nrecommend which proposals to support, the executing agency will establish a review committee \nwithin 3 months after loan effectiveness. The committee will consist of at least 20 qualified \nexperts and representatives from companies or industry associations in the five economic areas \nsupported by the project, MOEC, and polytechnics. Guidelines for the operation of the NSF and \nthe proposed assessment process are in Appendix 7 of the PAM. \n \n19.  At each polytechnic supported by the project, a project implementation unit (PIU) will be \nestablished with responsibility for implementing approved project activities under the supervision \nand management of the polytechnic director. A PIU manager will be responsible for day-to-day \nimplementation. Each project polytechnic institution will assign to the PIU adequate secretarial, \nfinance, and procurement staff, as well as a program coordinator and data officer for monitoring \nand evaluation, to ensure smooth implementation. The PIU manager will prepare reports to the \npolytechnic director, who will report in turn to the PMU. The project will provide capacity building \nto PMU and PIU members. Section 3 of the PAM details the terms of reference for the project \nsteering committee, PMU, and PIUs.  \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements\nImplementation period  2 January 2013\u221231 December 2017 \nProject management \n(i)   Oversight body  Project steering committee  \nDeputy minister for human resources and cultural affairs, BAPPENAS (chair); \nDirector general, DGHE (cochair);  \nMOEC, Ministry of Finance, BAPPENAS, Ministry of Manpower and Transmigration, \nprivate sector (KADIN & other industry associations as ad hoc members) (members) \n(ii)   Executing agency  DGHE, MOEC \n(iii)  Key implementing agency  13 polytechnic institutions \n(iv)  Project management unit  PMU, DGHE: 7 permanent staff and 5 support staff \nProcurement  ICB & NCB  Multiple contracts  $51.25 million \nShopping & direct contracting  Multiple contracts  $5.00 million \nConsulting services  QCBS, CQS, and ICS  259 person-months national and  $2.20 million \n3 person-months international \nSocial marketing campaign  CQS  Multiple contracts  $0.55 million \n3 studies   CQS, ICS  Multiple contracts  $1.40 million \nAdvance procurement action   Consultants for the capacity development program, procurement specialist, and \nfinance expert  \nDisbursement  Loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2012 as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed \nupon between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, BAPPENAS = National Planning Development Agency, CQS = consultants' \nqualifications selection, DGHE = Directorate General of Higher Education, ICB = international competitive bidding, \nICS = individual consultant selection, KADIN = Chamber of Commerce, MOEC = Ministry of Education and Culture, \nNCB = national competitive bidding, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n20.  The  government  has  requested  advanced  procurement  action  to  expedite  the \nrecruitment of consultants, establish procurement and disbursement systems for the PMU and \nPIUs,  and  ensure  that  they  comply  with  ADB  requirements.  Advance  contracting  will  be \nundertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to \ntime) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The \ngovernment was advised that ADB Management\u2019s approval of advanced contracting will not \n ", "8 \ncommit ADB to subsequently approve the project or to finance the procurement costs approved \nby Management in principle, which is subject to approval by the Board and, as such, does not \ncommit ADB to financing the project.  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE  \n21.  The direct beneficiaries of the project will be more than 48,000 students who will gain \naccess to high-quality study programs closely aligned with the needs of employers. Employers \nwill  benefit  from  improvements  to  the  quality  and  relevance  of  polytechnic  education,  as \nimproved skills directly link to improving workplace productivity, product quality, and service \nstandards. Improving the quality and relevance of study programs will build community and \nindustry confidence in the vocational education system and strengthen this pathway toward \nexpanding  meaningful  employment.  Greater  access  for  women  to  polytechnic  education \nresulting from initiatives such as the NSF will ensure that the benefits of high-quality skills \ndevelopment  are  shared.  Female  students  and  poor  students  will  capture  a  significant \nproportion of the direct benefits thanks to the project's gender and pro-poor targets detailed in \nthe design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). The lecturer development program will \nenable 39 lecturers to improve their skills, initially overseas, while the project supports the \ndevelopment of a local master\u2019s program designed to support the long-term development needs \nof polytechnic lecturers and instructors.  \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n22.  Economic benefits. Modernizing polytechnic education will contribute to improving the \nproductivity and competitiveness of Indonesian industry and promote inclusive growth. The \ndirect economic benefits from the project will flow from the increased numbers of polytechnic \ngraduates who find direct employment. Based on conservative assumptions, such targeted skills \ndevelopment can increase monthly wages by Rp2,000,000. Estimating these benefits over 20 \nyears and based on the total project cost of $92.60 million yields an economic internal rate of \nreturn of 17.2%. Other external benefits of the project that will most likely accrue to society at \nlarge, and not just the direct beneficiaries of the project, are (i) improvements in the provision of \nhigh-quality skills-development services at selected polytechnic institutions filtering into other \nvocational training providers and thereby improving the value of the sector to industry; (ii) \nimproved responsiveness of the polytechnic education system improving the relevance of skills \nand  employment  outcomes  of  graduates;  (iii)  heightened  efficiencies  in  project  polytechnic \ninstitutions  resulting  from  improved  governance  and  capacity  improvement  and  regulatory \nreforms under the project supporting other polytechnic providers seeking to work closely with \nindustry; and (iv) improved gender distribution in polytechnic institutions as a consequence of \nactivities in the gender action plan creating additional choice and opportunity for women seeking \nemployment, particularly in the five priority industry sectors. The project will raise polytechnic \neducation quality, relevance, and efficiency in project polytechnics reaching 20% of polytechnic \nstudents.  \n \n23.  Financial sustainability. The project should be financially sustainable, as the bulk of   \nexpenditures do not continue beyond the end of the project. Recurrent expenditures such as on \nequipment maintenance can be absorbed using additional revenues from government funding, \nstudent fees, and tailored training for enterprises. The project will increase the relevance of the \npolytechnic system to the labor market and improve the policy framework governing polytechnic \ninstitutions, which together will improve the sustainability of polytechnics by enabling them to \nbetter serve national social and economic development needs. Efficiency gains in the 13 project \npolytechnics will be realized in part through increased enrollment and the resulting higher \n ", "  9\nutilization of facilities and equipment. The government\u2019s annual commitment to the project as a \npercentage of the total education budget is projected to increase from 0.03% in year 1 of the \nproject  to  0.7%  in  year  3  and  to  decline  to  0.03%  in  year  5.  The  government\u2019s  annual \ncommitment for the project is therefore deemed affordable.  \n \nB.  Governance \n24.  Assessment of financial management and procurement capacity found the DGHE to \nhave extensive capacity to carry out the project, as it has implemented numerous internationally \nfunded projects since 1980. The financial management assessment found sufficient capacity \nand staffing in the accounting and finance section of MOEC's DGHE. The Integrated Chart of \nAccounts  is  consistent  with  international  accounting  standards.  The  PMU  will  prepare \ngovernment financial reports according to the government financial information system and \nsubmit them to ADB, the Ministry of Finance, and MOEC. Of particular concern, however, is the \nlack  of  standardization  in  the  use  of  accounting  systems  and  software  across  polytechnic \ninstitutions.  The  project  will  help  project  polytechnics  to  undertake  the  financial  reporting \ndemanded under the project\u2019s financial compliance requirements. The executing agency will \nprovide accounting staff for the PMU; train PMU staff in financial planning, accounting, auditing, \nand control; and implement a performance-based planning and budgeting system. The PMU will \nlikewise ensure proper monitoring, particularly of the activities funded through the NSF. The \nfinancial management assessment questionnaire is in the PAM.  \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and    \ndiscussed with the government. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social  \n26.  Gender  and  development.  The  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming. It includes elements that address key constraints on female participation in \npolytechnic education and includes a gender action plan. The key gender issues addressed by \nthe project include (i) females\u2019 limited access to untraditional, high-quality skills-development \nprograms; (ii) their access to technical training constrained by the costs of education and living \nexpenses; (iii) lack of knowledge related to the range of study programs and career prospects \nfor females in male-dominant skills areas; (iv) academic barriers to polytechnic education for \nlack of recognition of practical experience and prior learning; and (v) inadequate incentives, \nincluding equity strategies and scholarships, to encourage more females to enter untraditional \nsectors. The gender action plan includes the following targets and gender-responsive design \nfeatures: (i) 30% of the short courses developed through the Project target the study programs \nthat benefit female; (ii) 30% quota of the internships or industry placements in the priority \nsectors will be for female; (iii) at least a 15% increase in female polytechnic graduates entering \nthe workforce by 2016; (iv) 4,800 female students tested and certified to endorsed standards in \nthe priority skills areas by 2016; (v) assurance that each proposal submitted to the NSF is \nevaluated  in  terms  of  its  contribution  to  gender  equity  and  achieving  project  targets;  (vi) \nallocation of 20% of project-supported scholarships to females; (vii) 20% of the lecturers trained \nbeing female; (viii) 20% of  the management and staff in the Project Executing Agency and the \nSelected Polytechnics Institutions who are trained on technical and management skills to meet \nindustry standards shall be female; (ix) the implementation of a social marketing campaign to \npromote female participation and mobilize employers to recruit women in untraditional trades; \nand (x) the development of a gender strategy for the DGHE\u2019s support to the polytechnic sector.  \n \n ", "10 \nD.  Safeguards \n27.  In accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is category C \nfor impacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. The project \nactivities will require neither land acquisition nor resettlement. No specific activities will be \ndirectly targeted to indigenous peoples.  \nE.  Risk and Mitigating Measures \n28.

ASSURANCES  \n29.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project will conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, and consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the \nproject administration manual and loan documents. The government has agreed with ADB on \ncertain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n30.
