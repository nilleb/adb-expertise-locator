ADB  assistance \namounted  to  $406  million  between  1983  and  2009,  which  forms  about  45%  of  the  total \ncontribution by the major development agencies working in the Lao PDR transport sector. ADB \nhas  the  opportunity  to  facilitate  further  improvements  in  the  development  effectiveness  of \ntransport assistance in the country. \n \n\nAs  an  input  to  the  country  assistance  program  evaluation,  this  sector  assistance \nprogram evaluation (SAPE) assesses the performance of ADB\u2019s assistance between 2000 and \n2009 to the Lao PDR transport sector. More specifically, the SAPE examines the effectiveness \nof  ADB-funded  projects  in  achieving  their  development  objectives  and  assesses  their \ncontribution  to  human  development  impacts.  It  identifies  lessons  for  further  development  of \ntransport sector assistance in the country. The transport sector analysis focuses mainly on the \nroad  subsector,  since  ADB\u2019s  transport  operations  have  been  in  this  subsector  only  during  the \nperiod of evaluation. \n \n\nAs  of  December  2009,  ADB  approved  14  loans  totaling  $363  million,  32  technical \nassistance (TA) projects totaling $16 million, and 1 grant worth $27 million. Out of this, the civil \naviation  subsector  received  one  loan  of  $15  million,  while  the  tourism  subsector  received \nanother  loan  for  $11  million,  which  included  rehabilitation  of  roads  connecting  tourist \ndestinations. \n \n\nADB\u2019s  program  can  be  broadly  divided  into  two  categories  based  on  the  mode  of \nlending\u2014(i)  the  Lao  PDR  country  program  that  has  supported  various  levels  of  road \nimprovements  from  national  roads  to  rural  roads  contributing  to  the  growth  of  the  domestic \neconomy,  and  (ii)  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  regional  program  that  has  supported \nmainly  regional  roads  (national  roads  or  highways)  connecting  the  international  borders \ncontributing  mainly  to  the  growth  in  international  trade.  This  document  refers  to  the  country \nprogram and GMS regional program separately to highlight the need for ADB to continue and \nscale-up assistance for improvement of provincial and rural roads, which typically forms part of \nthe country program. \n \nTransport Sector Context \n \n\nBeing  a  landlocked  country,  the  Lao  PDR  depends  heavily  on  road  transport  for \neconomic  development.  The  increase  in  the  road  network  has  been  accompanied  by  an  even \nfaster growth in the number of vehicles across the country. However, remote areas still have low \ntraffic density due to the low level of their economic activities. The Ministry of Public Works and \nTransport (MPWT) is the national government agency primarily responsible for expansion and \nmaintenance of the transport infrastructure in the country. \n \n\nThe  Lao  PDR's  development  plans  have  consistently  supported  the  expansion  of  the \nroad network but have also recognized the limitations imposed by funding constraints. In recent \nyears,  regional  connectivity  has  been  emphasized.  MPWT's  multicriteria  mechanism  for \nprioritizing projects gives more weight to funding regional projects connecting the international \nborders  than  the  projects  providing  access  to  remote  areas  within  the  country.  In  response, \nADB's  strategy  has  evolved  to  focus  more  on  regional  roads  (through  the  GMS  Program)  to \nimprove  connectivity  with  neighboring  countries.  While  there  has  been  a  growing  awareness \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nwithin the government of the need to ensure the sustainability of projects, what ADB will do in \nthis area has not been clearly identified. \n \n\nADB's investment in rural roads is not only through its transport sector portfolio but also \nthrough  its  agriculture  and  rural  development  lending  window.  ADB\u2019s  completed  and  ongoing \nassistance has contributed to the improvement of about 796 kilometers of such roads in the Lao \nPDR. While the quality of outputs has generally been satisfactory, there is inadequate capacity \nat the provincial level to implement these projects.  \n \nProgram Implementation \n \n\nAll ADB transport sector projects in the Lao PDR faced delays, ranging from 13 months \nto 47 months. Initial delays were attributed to late engagement of consultants, slow mobilization \nof  equipment,  design  changes  and/or  additional  work,  and  the  prolonged  and  tedious \nprocurement  process  of  the  government.  To  address  these  problems,  ADB  allowed  advance \nprocurement  from  1993,  which  reduced  the  start-up  problems.  However,  implementation  was \ndelayed  in  subsequent  projects  due  to  the  insufficient  capacity  of  the  executing  agency  in \nproject  administration  and  in  implementing  ADB  procedures,  delays  in  mobilization  of  the \nrequired implementation structure, delays in counterpart funding, delays in preparation of tender \ndocuments,  and  contractor  problems.  Other  factors  that  affected  the  completion  of  civil  works \ninclude difficult physical conditions such as massive landslides (e.g., Fourth Road Improvement \nProject)  and  discoveries  of  deeply  buried  unexploded  ordnances  (e.g.,  East\u2013West  Corridor \nProject). \n \n\nThe Lao PDR has been able to encourage growth of private contracting firms, some of \nwhich  have  emerged  from  former  state-owned  enterprises.  However,  most  of  these  national \nfirms  lack  experience  in  technical  and  commercial  aspects.  The  issue  of  poor  performance  of \nthe national contractors has been seen on the Rural Access Roads Project and the Roads for \nRural Development Project. \n \nEvaluation of the Assistance \n \n\nStrategic  positioning.  This  is  satisfactory,  taking  into  consideration  the  regional \nprojects,  upcoming  country  program,  and  the  integrated  agriculture  and  rural  development \nprogram. However, allocation of funding can be improved. Given the funding constraints in the \nLao PDR, ADB's country strategy and program has applied selectivity in its programming. The \ntransport sector program is inclined toward regional cooperation, in line with the government\u2019s \ndevelopment  plans.  As  a  result,  there  has  been  limited  incremental  allocation  for  the  country \nprogram. The last transport project approved for the country program was in 2004. ADB is now \nplanning a new project within the country program for approval in 2012. While this indicates a \nlong  gap  in  assistance,  it  needs  to  be  noted  that  a  GMS  project  was  approved  in  2007  for \nrehabilitating the roads in northern Lao PDR. However, the long gap in the country program has \ncreated a disconnect between the actual assistance (i.e., regional cooperation projects) and the \nsector  road  map,  which  is  relatively  inward  looking  (e.g.,  provinces  without  all-weather  road \naccess,  paved  roads  in  general,  and  increase  in  maintenance  funding).  As  per  the  current \nprogram,  the  Lao  PDR  has  been  provided  a  biennial  allocation  of  $150.56  million  for  2009\u2013\n2010, which includes adjustment in response to the global economic crisis. The relatively small \nsize of this assistance indicates the funding constraints faced by the transport sector. \n \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nADB  has  adopted  an  integrated  approach  for  designing  agriculture  projects,  combining \nrural roads with agriculture sector interventions. This should be continued, but the planning and \nimplementation can be improved by incorporating several factors mentioned in this report. \n \n\nRelevance. The transport sector assistance for the Lao PDR is relevant based on (i) the \ndegree  to  which  ADB  assistance  was  consistent  with  the  country  needs  and  ADB's  strategic \npriorities,  (ii)  the  quality-at-entry  of  the  country  partnership  strategies  and  program,  and \n(iii) coordination  with  development  partners.  ADB's  program  has  been  consistent  with  the  Lao \nPDR's  socioeconomic  development  plans.  However,  the  thrust  of  ADB's  assistance  for  2006\u2013\n2010 was on regional projects, and no new assistance was approved for the Lao PDR's country \nprogram. Further, ADB-funded projects have typically been geographically dispersed in various \nparts  of  the  country,  affecting  the  implementation  efficiency  as  well  as  the  attribution  of  their \ntransport  sector  program  has  generally  been  coordinated  with  other \nimpacts.  ADB's \ndevelopment partners but this can be further improved. Finally, the quality of the project design \nframeworks  in  the  past  reports  and  recommendation  of  the  President  and  project  completion \nreports needed strengthening, especially in relation to the indicators for outcomes and impacts. \nSince 2009, they have shown improvement. \n \n\nEfficiency.  ADB  assistance  is  less  efficient  based  on  the  economic  analysis  and  the \nimplementation  performance  of  the  transport  projects.  Based  on  the  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn criterion alone, out of the 5 completed ADB road projects between 2000 and 2009, 1 was \nfound  to  be  highly  efficient,  3  were  efficient,  and  1  was  less  efficient  as  reported  in  previous \nevaluation  reports.  Two  of  these  projects  were  self-evaluated.  The  efficiency  ratings  of  the  first \nfour  projects  did  not  consider  their  implementation  performance  in  the  rating  although  these \nprojects  also  had  implementation  issues.  The  inclusion  of  the  implementation  efficiency  as  the \ncriterion  has  resulted  in  a  lower  performance  rating.  The  recently  completed  Rural  Access \nRoads Project was found to be less efficient, owing to a combination of low economic benefits \naccrued and implementation efficiency issues. The lower economic viability of rural roads and, \nto a certain extent, of regional roads is not unexpected but could improve later with change in \neconomic  conditions  after  the  intervention.  Generally,  overall  transport  sector  efficiency  has \nbeen  affected  by  poor  implementation  performance  characterized  by  substantial  delays \n(average  35  months)  and  cost  overruns  (average  13%)  for  projects  completed  between  2000 \nand 2009. Finally, the use of loan savings for funding additional works needs to be justified in \nterms of adequate due diligence at the time of utilization and at the project completion stage. \n \n\nEffectiveness.  ADB  assistance  is  effective,  based  on  the  extent  to  which  ADB's \nprogram  achieved  sector-specific  outcomes  and  institutional  development  outcomes.  The \ngovernment  and  its  development  partners  have  been  contributing  to  road  network  expansion \nand improvement of the connectivity. Typically, the majority of the outputs from road subsector \nprojects in the Lao PDR can be summarized in terms of physical accomplishments, such as the \nlength  of  roads  improved  or  constructed  and  numbers  of  bridges  improved  or  built.  Projects \nhave also contributed to all-weather connectivity in southern and western parts of the country. \nThe  most  recently  completed  project,  the  GMS:  Northern  Economic  Corridor  Project,  links  the \nPeople's  Republic  of  China  with  Thailand  via  the  Lao  PDR's  Louang  Namtha  Province. \nAssistance  for  periodic  maintenance  of  roads  has  been  difficult  to  assess  since  ADB  funding \nwas fungible. \n \n\nADB has provided effective support for institutional development, but some areas need \nto  be  improved.  ADB's  efforts  need  to  focus  on  the  core  areas  of  safeguard  implementation, \nrural  road  network  expansion,  and  maintenance  planning  and  funding.  MPWT's  current  draft \ntransport sector strategy also advocates this institutional strengthening. \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\nSustainability.  Overall,  ADB  assistance  to  the  Lao  PDR  transport  sector  is  likely  to  be \nsustainable based on an assessment of government's financing of recurrent costs, cost recovery \nof  the  projects,  institutional  arrangements,  and  the  past  experience  of  road  maintenance  in  the \ncountry.  The  maintenance  of  national  roads  and  highways  in  the  Lao  PDR  is  funded  from  the \nRoad  Maintenance  Fund,  which  allocates  90%  of  its  revenues  to  national  roads.  Based  on  the \nrevenue  growth  estimated  by  MPWT,  this  fund  is  expected  to  be  self-sufficient  in  the  medium \nterm.  However,  this  will  depend  on  a  large  increase  in  the  fuel  levy,  which  has  political \nramifications. In view of the assurances provided by MPWT for continued rise of this levy in the \nfuture and the demonstrated fuel levy increases in the past, ADB assistance for the national roads \nprogram is rated likely to be sustainable. However, the funds allocated for provincial, district, and \nrural  roads  continue  to  remain  short  of  the  requirements.  This  has  increased  the  risk  of \ndeterioration  of  recently  rehabilitated  roads.  With  the  low  demand  in  the  form  of  traffic, \nmaintenance  of  those  roads  remains  low  in  the  order  of  funding  priority.  In  view  of  this,  ADB \nassistance  for  rural  roads  is  less  likely  to  be  sustainable,  unless  the  government  sets  up  a \nmechanism to address this issue. \n \n\nImpacts.  The  contribution  of  ADB\u2019s  assistance  to  development  impacts  in  the  transport \nsector  is  rated  substantial.  This  assessment  measures  the  extent  to  which  ADB's  cumulative \ninterventions  contributed  to  the  Lao  PDR's  long-term  development  results.  These  impacts  are \nassessed across ADB's portfolio in the following key thematic areas: poverty reduction, impact on \ntrade  and  tourism,  impact  on  health,  vehicle  overloading  and  safety,  agricultural  development, \nenvironmental impact, and impact on ethnic people (or indigenous peoples, as described in ADB\u2019s \nSafeguards  Policy  Statement).  This  assessment  has  highlighted  the  need  for  setting  up \nappropriate impact assessment tools to capture post-project impacts. An important area that ADB \nneeds to monitor is the differential impacts of the transport projects among ethnic communities. \n \n\nTwo  conclusions  are  intuitive  to  the  Lao  PDR's  context:  (i)  more  time  is  needed  for \nproject  benefits  to  be  captured  by  the  residents  in  rural  areas;  and  (ii)  other  interventions  are \nessential  for  economic  benefits  to  be  captured  by  the  population,  such  as  improvement  in \npolicies  for land  allocation,  village  consolidation,  opium  cultivation  eradication,  and eradication \nof swidden cultivation; agriculture development in terms of improvement of quantity, quality, and \ndiversity  of  crops;  encouragement  of  crop  substitution;  and  provision  of  health  and  education \nservices. The Lao PDR\u2019s transport sector is susceptible to adverse impacts on environment and \nethnic people, as highlighted in this report. Use of external monitors for sensitive projects also \nneeds  to  be  mainstreamed.  Specifically,  the  issue  of  the  delayed  appointment  of  external \nmonitors  for  the  ongoing  Northern  GMS  Transport  Network  Improvement  needs  to  be \naddressed. \n \n\nOverall  assessment.  The  overall  rating  of  ADB's  program  is  successful  based  on  the \nabove six criteria. This rating is an outcome of several factors. First, ADB's contribution to the \nLao PDR transport sector has been tangible and consistent with the country's needs. Second, \nthe  assistance  has  been  effective  in  enabling  positive  outcomes  at  the  local,  country,  and \nregional  levels.  Third,  it  can  be  attributed  to  having  contributed  to  agricultural  development. \nThere  remains  room  for  improvement  in  other  areas,  such  as  project  implementation \nperformance, low utilization of project outputs, institutional development, sustainability, strategic \npositioning, and differential impacts among ethnic people. \n \n\nADB performance. This is satisfactory for the transport sector in the Lao PDR. ADB has \nadded value by funding capital investment projects and capacity development in selected areas. \nAlthough this continues to be consistent with the needs of the country, there are other areas of \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nintervention  that  need  improvement,  such  as  sustainability.  ADB  can  further  improve  its \nperformance  by  assisting  MPWT  in  addressing  sector-wide  issues  relating  to  capacity \ndevelopment, road maintenance, and private sector development. Delegation of loan and grant \nadministration  to  the  Lao  Resident  Mission  could  be  scaled  up  provided  it  is  supported  by \nadequate staff and other resources. \n \n\nADB  has  been  at  the  forefront  of  participating  in  sector  working  groups  to  coordinate \ntransport  investments  in  the  Lao  PDR.  With  the  increase  in  the  number  of  development \nagencies and the amount of external assistance, there was heightened awareness of the need \nfor  donor  coordination.  However,  coordination  among  agencies  can  be  improved,  especially \nregarding knowledge sharing and project implementation monitoring. \n \nLessons and Recommendations for Future Assistance \n \n\nThe country assistance program evaluation in 2006 for the Lao PDR had recommended \nroad  safety.  These \n\nroad  maintenance  and \n\nto  support \n\nthat  ADB  should  continue \nrecommendations continue to be valid. \n \n\nFrom  this  SAPE,  the  lessons  identified  for  ADB  for  future  assistance  are  (i)  higher \ndevelopment  effectiveness  could  be  achieved  by  continuing  and  scaling  up  the  assistance  for \nfocused  projects  enable  better  project \nprovincial  and  rural  roads;  (ii)  geographically \nmanagement  and  development  effectiveness;  (iii)  the  quality  of  sector  and  project  design \nframeworks can be improved to ensure better measurement of outcomes and impacts; (iv) ADB \ncan facilitate transfer of knowledge from other countries to the Lao PDR; (v) better due diligence \nduring procurement of  civil works contracts can avoid selection of poorly qualified contractors; \n(vi)  sector-wide  solutions  for  road  maintenance  will  ensure  consistent  sustainability;  and  (vii) \nmore detailed and careful ex-ante assessment of environmental and social impacts will ensure \nthat  propensities  for  negative  impacts  are  identified  correctly  at  the  feasibility  stage.    External \nmonitors have been useful and could be replicated in other projects. \n \n\nRecommendations  for  ADB\u2019s  future  assistance  are  summarized  in  the  table  below. \nThese  recommendations  are  suggested  for  inclusion  in  the  next  country  partnership  strategy. \nThe results of the interventions linked to these recommendations can be measured after 5 years \nto evaluate their effectiveness. \n \n\nRecommendation \nCapacity development (para. 178).

Its  transport  system  depends  heavily  on  the  road \nnetwork,  much  of  which  was  destroyed  during  past  conflicts  as  well  as  through  natural \ncalamities. Although considerable network rehabilitation has been achieved, network coverage \nmust be further extended to remote areas to enable their access to social services, trade, and \nincome and employment opportunities. While the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has provided \ntechnical assistance (TA), grants, and loans to support these efforts, such interventions need to \nbe continued to further improve the gaps in the network coverage. \n \n2. \nADB lending assistance for the transport sector in the Lao PDR was initiated in 1983 with \nthe  road  subsector,  and  subsequently  in  1993  for  the  civil  aviation  subsector.  Since  then,  ADB \nassistance  has  focused  on  the  road  subsector  only.  Cumulative  ADB  lending  for  the  transport \nsector in the Lao PDR has amounted to $406 million, covering 14 loan projects, 1 grant-financed \nproject, and 32 TA projects as of December 2009, of which 13 were for the road subsector. As per \nthe  ADB  country  classification  system,  the  Lao  PDR  is  eligible  to  receive  concessionary  Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  (ADF)  resources  in  light  of  its  gross  national  income  per  capita  and \ncreditworthiness.  Appendix  1  provides  details  of  loans  and  TA  projects,  both  completed  and \nongoing.1 \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe  objective  of  this  sector  assistance  program  evaluation  (SAPE)  is  to  provide  an \nindependent  assessment  of  ADB  assistance  between  2000  and  2009  to  the  Lao  PDR  transport \nsector  and  to  identify  areas  for  improving  the  effectiveness  of  its  interventions.  It  uses  facts  and \nlessons  from  earlier  projects  to  establish  the  content  of  this  evaluation.  The  findings  of  this \nevaluation will feed into the broader country assistance program evaluation being carried out by the \nIndependent  Evaluation  Department  (IED).  Taking  into  account  the  sector  context,  the  SAPE \nevaluates  the  contribution  of  ADB  to  specific  development  results  in  the  Lao  PDR  and  identifies \nissues and lessons in the sector pertinent to the preparation of the next country partnership strategy. \n \n4. \nIn  the  Lao  PDR  transport  sector,  the  SAPE  mainly  covers  the  road  subsector,  with  a \nlimited analysis of the civil aviation subsector. Although ADB has funded only one civil aviation \nproject, this subsector is included in the SAPE to fully cover all of ADB\u2019s transport assistance. \n \nC. \n \nThe  SAPE  follows  ADB  guidelines  for  a  country  assistance  program  evaluation.2 \n5. \nAppendix  2  provides  the  evaluation  framework  for  the  SAPE.  The  evaluation  criteria  for  the \nsector  comprise  relevance,  efficiency,  effectiveness,  sustainability,  development  impacts,  and \nstrategic  positioning.  Taking  into  account  the  findings  from  these  assessments,  this  SAPE \nprovides  an  overall  rating  for  transport  sector  assistance  and  identifies  lessons  and \nrecommendations for future assistance. \n \n\nEvaluation Framework and Methodology \n\n                                                 \n1  Details of these loans and TA projects are not footnoted when they are referred to in the text. \n2  ADB. 2010. Revised Guidelines for the Preparation of Country Assistance Program Evaluations. Manila. Draft. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nFindings of Earlier Evaluation \n\nThe SAPE draws on a combination of desk reviews, project documents, and primary data \n6. \ncollection to analyze the transport sector. Out of the 13 ADB-funded road projects completed in \nthe  Lao  PDR,  IED  evaluated  seven  projects  through  project  performance  evaluation  reports \n(PPERs). More recently, a PPER has been prepared for the Rural Access Roads Project.3 These \nevaluation reports provide a comprehensive analysis of the completed projects. \n \nD. \n \nThe  2006  country  assistance  program  evaluation  for  the  Lao  PDR4  indicated  that  ADB \n7. \nhad performed well in the transport sector. It found that an important factor contributing to the \noverall success of ADB operations was continuity in key sectors, like transport. The success of \nthe  country  program  in  enabling  infrastructure  development  reflected  a  systematic,  continued \nseries of interventions, allowing succeeding projects to build on past achievements. \n \n8. \nThe evaluation concluded that ADB assistance to the Lao PDR transport sector was highly \nrelevant to the country strategy objectives and the country's needs since it provided investments \nin essential infrastructure to enhance connectivity and to stimulate market transition, which were \npriority areas in all three periods of the ADB country strategies for the Lao PDR. Assistance to the \ntransport  sector  was  efficient.  Capacity  building  of  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport \n(MPWT)\u2014formerly  called  the  Ministry  of  Communications,  Transport,  Post,  and  Construction \n(MCTPC)\u2014has  been  a  key  element  of  ADB  support  to  this  sector  through  a  series  of  advisory \ntechnical assistance (ADTA) projects over the past 2 decades. Institutional development and other \nimpacts of ADB assistance to the transport sector were rated substantial. \n \nE. \n \n9. \nChapter II of this SAPE describes the background of the Lao PDR transport sector and \nidentifies  the  development  challenges.  Chapter  III  provides  a  summary  of  ADB  strategy  and \nassistance for the sector. Chapter IV evaluates ADB sector assistance. Chapter V provides the \nconclusions, lessons, and recommendations for future sector assistance. \n \n\nOrganization of the Report \n\nII. \n\nSECTOR CONTEXT \n\nSector Profile \n\n \nA. \n \nBeing a landlocked country, the Lao PDR depends heavily on road transport for trade links \n10. \nboth  externally  and  internally.  In  2007,  road  transport  accounted  for  93%  of  passenger  travel \n(passenger-kilometers [km]) and 85% freight movement (ton-km).5 The remaining passenger and \nfreight traffic were carried through waterways and civil aviation. The road network has increased \nby 78% over the last decade from 20,000 km in 1997 to 35,558 km in 2009.6 \n \n11. \nRoads.  Transport  infrastructure  in  the  Lao  PDR  is  at  an  early  stage  of  development  as \ndemonstrated by the road density as well as by the road quality. Its road density is low, compared \nwith  other  Southeast  Asian  countries,  as  well  as  with  most  other  landlocked  countries.  For \nexample,  Mongolia,  which  is  also  a  landlocked  country,  has  a  road  density  of  19.0  km  per \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2009.

Strategy for Transport Sector Development for the Period 2008\u20132010 \nand Direction for 2011\u20132015. Vientiane. Draft. This document is yet to be formally approved by the government. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\n1,000 people  as  compared  with  the  Lao  PDR\u2019s  road  density  of  6.1  km  per  1,000  people.  In \naddition,  the  general  demands  on  the  transport  infrastructure  are  low,  since  traffic  levels  on  the \nnational network (except near Vientiane and Savannakhet) are below 1,000 average annual daily \ntraffic and below 500 average annual daily traffic on most other networks. However, demand has \nbeen  increasing  over  the  years  at  an  annual  rate  of  5%\u20138%  for  goods  and  8%\u201310%  for \npassengers, indicating a rise in line with economic growth. A majority of the roads are impassable \nduring the rainy season. Appendix 3 provides a summary of the transport sector profile. \n \nThe  number  of  vehicles  in  the  country  increased  from  59,781  in  1985  to  568,290  in \n12. \n2005, with the highest growth occurring from 2000 to 2005 (a two-fold increase).7 At the end of \n2007,  the  Lao  PDR  had  641,031  vehicles  registered,  and  motorcycles  accounted  for  almost \n80%. Most of the country's transport fleet is registered in Vientiane, which has more than 40% \nof  the  country's  vehicles.  This indicates  a  concentration  of  vehicles  in  urban  areas,  increasing \nthe  corresponding  pressure  on  its  transport  infrastructure  and  traffic  management.  The  long-\ndistance traffic segment is dominated by lighter vehicles, with trucks forming about 30% of the \ntraffic,  mostly  on \nthe  national  roads.  A  section  of  Road  13  (Vientiane\u2013Vangvieng\u2013\nLouangphrabang) generated the highest traffic volume at 2,000\u20134,000 vehicles per day.8 \n \n13. \nThe  low  traffic  demand,  combined  with  the  need  to  provide  access  to  remote  areas, \nshows that the Lao PDR needs to develop basic two-lane roads at a low cost for the medium \nterm  until  demand  rises  to  levels  requiring  significant  capacity  expansion.

The  public  road  network  is  divided  into \n14. \n(i) national  roads  or  highways  which  connect  the  capital  city  to  other  provincial  towns  and \neconomic centers, connect to the international borders, and serve socioeconomic development at \nthe national level; (ii) provincial roads link provincial capitals and connect special economic zones \nto the district centers; (iii) district roads link district economic centers to villages; (iv) urban roads, \nwhich are internal to towns and cities; (v) rural roads link villages and utilities serving the villages; \n\n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2007.

The traffic figures on this road have been \n\nobtained from the draft strategy report (footnote 6). \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nand  (vi)  special  roads  serve  specific  purposes  such  as  for  tourism,  environmental  conservation, \nand water source protection. Each class is formally defined in the Road Law of 1999.9 Based on \nmid-2008 estimates, out of the total 35,558 km of public roads, rural roads form the majority of the \nroad  network,  followed  by  provincial  and  national  roads  (Figure  2).10  Feeder  roads  connect \nnational roads with other smaller roads or with adjacent dwellings. \n \n\nFigure 2: Classification of Roads (number of kilometers), 2008 \n\nSpecial, 2%\n\nNational, 19%\n\nRural, 40%\n\nProvincial, \n20%\n\nUrban, 5%\n\nDistrict, 14%\n\n \n\nSource:  Government  of  the  Lao  People's  Democratic  Republic,  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport.  2008. \n\nStrategic Plan for Transport Sector Development: Guiding the Sector-Wide Approach. Vientiane.  \n\n \n15. \nIn mid-2008, only 13.6% of the total length of roads was paved (using bitumen, asphalt, or \nconcrete); 33.7% was gravel; and the remaining 52.7% was earth construction. Paved roads form \n56% of the national roads and 3% of the other roads. Other roads have gravel (33.7%) or earth \nsurfaces  (52.3%).  Seasonal  closures  are  frequent  due  to  poor  pavement  and  deficient  cross-\ndrainage. MPWT reported in its 2009 strategy paper that many of these sections are impassable \nduring  the  rainy  season  (footnote  6).  It  also  estimated  that  about  36%  of  the  roads  are  in  an \nunmaintainable condition, that is, their condition is so poor that they have to be rehabilitated. \n \n16. \nAir transport. In the civil aviation subsector, the Lao PDR operates the Wattay Airport at \nVientiane  and  two  regional  airports  at  Louangphrabang  and  Pakxe.  In  addition,  there  are \n10 minor airports in the provincial capitals and 39 other airstrips. \n \n17. \nInland waterways. The Lao PDR's topography has traditionally facilitated inland waterway \ntransport. However, this form of transport is insufficiently used and lacks integration with the other \nforms  of  transport,  especially  roads.  The  country  has  over  2,000  km  of  rivers,  comprising  the \nMekong and its tributaries. Twenty-one river port facilities, constructed by the government, have \ntypically been employed for domestic trade only. However, recent years have witnessed a growth \nin cross-border trade with the People's Republic of China (PRC), Myanmar, and Thailand. \n \nRailways. Other than a 3.5-km rail link across the Mekong River between Thanaleng in \n18. \nthe  Lao  PDR  and  Nongkhai  in  Thailand,  the  railway  subsector  in  the  Lao  PDR  has  not  been \ndeveloped, restricting the transport of bulk and heavy freight at lower costs. This has contributed \nto slow growth of large industries in rural areas. \n \n19. \nNonroad transport infrastructure has not developed much in the Lao PDR, due to lack of \nadequate funding as well as the relatively low level of economic activities in rural areas. The Lao \nPDR  economy  faces  a  conundrum:  the  lack  of  infrastructure  hinders  economic  development, \nand  the  lack  of  economic  activities  does  not  provide  a  sufficiently  strong  rationale  for \n                                                 \n9  The Road Law was passed by the National Assembly on 3 April 1999. \n10 MPWT estimates in mid-2008. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nInstitutional Arrangements \n\ninfrastructure development. Yet this issue can be resolved by developing economic centers that \nhave good access to urban areas and can attract economic and commercial activities. \n \n20. \nUrban transport. The pressure on urban transport systems has been building up slowly. \nWhile  the  number  of  vehicles  has  been  increasing  in  line  with  national  figures,  urban \ninfrastructure in Vientiane and other large towns needs to be upgraded, and mass rapid transit \nsystems must be introduced. A 2008 study on Vientiane's urban transport network forecasted a \nrise in vehicle trips from 418,775 in 2007 to 958,144 in 2025, a growth of 2.3 times.11 This will \nimpact traffic congestion in the city similar to other Asian cities such as Bangkok and Manila. \n \n21. \nAccording to the 2008 study, the number of registered vehicles especially increased after \n2000,  primarily  attributed  to  the  growing  availability  of  low-priced  motorcycles.  Traffic  surveys \nconducted in Vientiane showed that there is usually high traffic on major roads, with the highest \ntraffic volume (58,470 vehicles per day in both directions, including motorcycles) observed in front \nof the Pohphano Temple along Kaysone Road. This indicates a growing problem of congestion, \nrequiring a combination of infrastructure improvement and traffic management. \n \nB. \n \n22.  MPWT  is  the  national  government  agency  primarily  in  charge  of  transport.  It  is \nresponsible for developing national and provincial roads, civil aviation, urban transport systems, \nriver wharves, and river and road transport. MPWT consists of six departments: the Department \nof Civil Aviation, Department of Housing and Urban Planning, Department of Inland Waterways, \nDepartment  of  Planning  and  Cooperation,  Department  of  Roads  (DOR),  and  Department  of \nTransport.  Based  on  5-year  transport  plans,  the  provinces  prepare  and  submit  annual \nimplementation plans for transport projects to MPWT. \n \n23. \nRoads. Recent changes to the institutional structure of MPWT resulted in a delegated, \ndecentralized system of coordination and implementation. MPWT has the overall responsibility \nbut has delegated certain project management and maintenance responsibilities to departments \nof  public  works  and  transport  (DPWTs)  in  each  province,  with  subsidiary  offices  in  districts. \nSimilarly, DPWTs have delegated various tasks to offices of public works and transport, which \nare  headed  by  DPWT  staff.  DPWTs  report  to  the  provincial  governor  for  budget  purposes  but \nalso  to  MPWT  for  compliance  with  national  technical  standards.12  Although  MPWT  provides \npartial  budgetary  support  for  routine  and  periodic  maintenance,  the  implementation  is  carried \nout by DPWTs, requiring adequate technical capacity at the provincial and district levels. \n \n24. \nThe  Road  Maintenance  Fund  (RMF)  was  created  within  the  organizational  structure  of \nMPWT.  It  is  supervised  and  directed  by  an  RMF  advisory  board,  which  consists  of \nrepresentatives  from  the  public  and  private  sectors  appointed  by  the  Prime  Minister  from  the \nMinistry  of  Finance,  MPWT,  provincial  authorities,  Lao  National  Chamber  of  Commerce  and \nIndustry,  road  and  passenger  transport  operators,  and  the  general  public.  The  advisory  board \nrequirements.13  The  Road \nalso \nAdministration  Department  of  MPWT  coordinates  with  the RMF  regarding  financial  support  for \nnational road maintenance and the Local Roads Division with regard to local roads. \n                                                 \n11 Government of the Lao PDR, MCTPC and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). 2008.

The Lao National Railways Authority under MPWT is responsible for managing \n\nAir  transport.  Within  MPWT,  the  Department  of  Civil  Aviation  is  responsible  for  policy \n25. \nand  planning  in  civil  aviation  and  for  regulatory  oversight  of  technical  and  safety  matters \npertaining  to  aviation  and  the  Lao  Airports  Authority.  The  department  has  eight  divisions  in \naddition to the Lao Airports Authority, which is responsible for the operation and maintenance of \nthe  Wattay  international  and  domestic  airport  terminals  (Vientiane),  two  regional  airports \n(Louangphrabang and Pakxe), and two provincial airports (Louang Namtha and Savannakhet). \nAll  other  provincial  small  airports  are  the  responsibility  of  the  provincial  governments  with  the \ndepartment\u2019s technical consultation. \n \n26. \nInland waterways. The Department of Waterways is responsible for policy, planning, and \nmanaging  all  inland  waterways  in  the  country.  This  includes  port  and  navigation  channel \nmanagement, flooding and river bank protection, and waterways transport. These waterways carry \nfreight within the Lao PDR, as well as across the border to the PRC, Myanmar, and Thailand. \n \n27. \nthe short railway line, which is used for freight traffic, between the Lao PDR and Thailand. \n \nC. \n \n28. \nFunding  constraints.  Despite  large  investments  to  develop  the  national  roads  and \nhighways,  the  road  network  remains  less  developed  due  to  funding  constraints  for  rehabilitation. \nMost remote parts of the Lao PDR remain inaccessible and depend on earth roads, which are often \nimpassable during the rainy season. As previously stated, only 56% of the national roads are paved \nwith a bitumen surface (footnote 12). Further, besides central budget allocations, MPWT depends \non  funding  from  multilateral  and  bilateral  development  agencies,  whose  funding  has  been  mainly \nchanneled  toward  developing  the  national  road  network,  i.e.,  highways,  often  overlooking  the \nsmaller and more remote provincial and rural roads. Lack of adequate funding has been the main \nconstraint faced by the sector, which is also evident by the delays in the availability of counterpart \nfunds. The project completion reports (PCRs) of the recently completed Rural Access Roads Project \nand  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS):  Northern  Economic  Corridor  Project  indicated  that \ncounterpart funding has become a significant challenge in the recent years. It is being resolved in \nthe  current  projects  through  tax  breaks,  e.g.,  for  the  ongoing  Northern  GMS  Transport  Network \nImprovement Project, the counterpart funding includes taxes of $5.6 million. \n \n29. \nHigh dependence on external assistance. The Lao PDR continues to depend heavily on \nexternal assistance from multilateral and bilateral development agencies to fund capital investments \nand,  to  a  certain  extent,  for  maintenance  expenditure.  For  2007\u20132008,  MPWT's  total  public \ninvestment for roads amounted to $78.59 million, of which 73% came from external assistance and \nthe  remaining  from  national  budget  resources  (Table  1).  Although  this  dependence  has  fallen  in \nrecent years, about 50% of MPWT's budget is still funded by external assistance. \n \n\nTable 1: Annual Investment for Road Sector in the Lao People's Democratic Republic \n\nTotal Road Sector \nInvestment by MPWT \n($ million) \n78.59 \n83.64 \n88.55 \n\nFunding from \nNational Budget \n($ million) \n20.86 (27%) \n28.81 (34%) \n40.15 (45%) \n\nYear \n2007\u20132008 \n2008\u20132009 \n2009\u20132010 (estimate) \nMPWT = Ministry of Public Works and Transport. \nNote:  Funding from the national budget includes that for the Road Maintenance Fund.

Rehabilitated  paved  roads  have  been  deteriorating  due  to  lack  of \n30. \nregular  maintenance,  both  routine  and  periodic.  Although  the  RMF  has  been  set  up  and \noperationalized, it is focused on national roads and highways, and can allocate only 10% of its \nrevenues to provincial and rural roads. This has resulted in neglect of rural road maintenance, \nwhich is also due to insufficient funding by the provincial governments. \n \n31. \nInstitutional capacity. The Lao PDR lacks technically trained personnel in general and also \nin  MPWT.  The  capacity  to  plan,  implement,  monitor,  and  maintain  transport  projects  is  currently \ninsufficient  to  keep  pace  with  the  increasing  size  of  the  network.  Although  several  capacity \ndevelopment  programs  have  been  implemented,  gaps  remain  in  various  areas,  such  as  project \nmanagement, safeguard monitoring, rehabilitation and maintenance planning, and procurement. \n \nDifferential  impacts  on  ethnic  groups.  Improvement  of  roads  could  increase  the \n32. \neconomic inequality between ethnic groups since benefits may not accrue equally to all groups. \nSuch  differential  impacts  can  be  addressed  only  if  the  assessment  at  appraisal  is  carried  out \nefficiently,  propensities  for  differential  economic  development  are  identified  correctly  at  the \nfeasibility  stage,  and  mitigation  measures  are  put  in  place.  At  times,  such  assessments  have \nbeen rudimentary. \n \n33. \nRoad safety. Road improvement is typically linked to higher vehicle speeds, which in turn \nleads  to  more  road  accidents.  In  addition,  there  has  been  an  increase  in  the  severity  of  these \naccidents in terms of injuries and fatalities. Between 2002 and 2007, there was 4% average annual \ngrowth  (year  on  year)  in  the  number of  accidents  in  the country.14  Motorcycles  accounted  for the \nhighest  accident  rates,  followed  by  cars  and  pickups.  Another  challenge  linked  to  road  safety  is \nvehicle overloading. Logging trucks and international traffic on some road sections continue to be \nmain  sources  of  overloading.  This  leads  to  road  damage,  reducing  the  life  of  the  road.  Further, \nexisting  weigh  stations  on  national  roads  do  not  adequately  enforce  vehicle  axle  controls,  while \nprovincial and rural roads lack such stations. Finally, road construction remains a challenging task, \nowing to the country's generally steep terrain and propensity toward landslides. Slope stabilization \ntechniques for reducing landslides tend to be costly, reducing the economic viability of projects. \n \nD. \n \n34. \nThe government's sector strategy has focused primarily on expanding the road network \nin  a  continuing  effort  to  provide  all-weather  access.  The  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan, \n2001\u20132020  and  the  Fifth  Five-Year  Plan  for  Socioeconomic  Development,  2001\u20132005  have \nidentified the main goal for 2010, which is to improve and build economic infrastructure with firm \nand  secured  steps  in  particular  to  strengthen  agricultural  production,  eradicate  slash-and-burn \ncultivation,  complete  poverty  reduction  of  the  people,  and  build  basic  industrial  initiatives  and \nhuman  resources  in  sufficient  quality  and  quantity  in  order  to  step  into  industrial  development \nand  modernization  step  by  step.15  While  the  emphasis  on  infrastructure  development  includes \nthe  transport  sector,  the  sector  strategy  has  focused  on  improving  the  national  roads,  i.e., \nhighways, for providing international connectivity with neighboring countries. The development \nof  district  and  rural  roads  has  been  included  under  the  rural  development  efforts  that  cover \nvarious other interventions.16 \n                                                 \n14 Data provided by MPWT. \n15 Government of the Lao PDR, Lao PDR Committee for Planning and Cooperation. 2001.

Vientiane. \n\n16 Rural development efforts were strategically combined with poverty reduction activities and comprised slash-and-\nburn  cultivation  stabilization;  permanent  resettlement  management  and  land  and  forest  allocation;  opium \neradication; communications, electricity, and water supply basic infrastructure development; education and public \nhealth improvement; improvement of gender issues; and district and village staff training. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nTransport development has always been a priority of the government. However, owing to \n35. \nfinancial  constraints,  international  development  agencies  have  played  an  important  role  in \ncontributing to sector investment. The country\u2019s transport strategy, set forth in the most recent \nNational Socioeconomic Development Plan (NSEDP),17 aims to provide transport infrastructure \nfor  the  entire  country  so  that  the  population  can  more  readily  communicate  and  participate  in \ndevelopment  activities  as  well  as  interact  with  neighbors  and  markets  outside  of  the  country. \nAttention to primary roads will continue, but increasing emphasis is placed on GMS road links, \nrural transport infrastructure, and railways development. Table A3.9 provides the details of the \ngovernment\u2019s  strategic  plan  for  transport  development  anchored  within  the  NSEDP  6  and \nindicates  the  priorities  for  each  subsector.  Although  Table  A3.9  shows  high  government \ncommitment  toward  road  maintenance,  it  needs  to  be  backed  up  by  appropriate  allocations, \nespecially for rural road maintenance, which is currently lacking (paras. 109\u2013112). \n \n36. \nDevelopment  agency  coordination.  The  NSEDP\u2019s  medium-term  expenditure  program \nfor  transport  lists  an  extensive  investment  plan  for  projects  with  an  estimated  total  cost  of \n$900 million, which exceeds available resources. In keeping with the Vientiane Declaration and in \nconjunction  with  the  government,  development  agencies  have  agreed  to  adopt  a  sector-wide \napproach  (SWAp)  to  increase  aid  effectiveness  for  the  transport  sector.18  The  SWAp  approach \nhas already been adopted by the World Bank in its support of the Road Maintenance Program, \nalbeit in a limited way. MPWT has now created a secretariat for the SWAp, which will take steps \nto strengthen financial management systems and their capacity to implement environmental and \nsocial safeguards. Transport sector donors, including ADB, the Australian Agency for International \nDevelopment (AusAID); Department  for International Development of the United Kingdom;  KfW; \nSwedish  International  Development  Cooperation  Agency  (Sida);  Thailand's  National  Economic \nDevelopment  Authority;  and  the  governments  of  PRC,  Japan,  and  the  Republic  of  Korea  have \nagreed to support the SWAp.19 Thus, an infrastructure sector working group has been set up by \nMPWT and is co-chaired by ADB and the Embassy of Japan (para. 83). \n \nDecentralization. The government initiated a policy of decentralization of the development \n37. \neffort in 2000. A Prime Ministerial Instruction set out the general principles to build up \u201cprovinces as \nstrategic  units,  districts  as  planning  and  budgeting  units,  and  villages  as  implementation  units.\u201d20 \nThis was complemented by (i) detailed recommendations by the State Planning Committee on the \ncompetence,  functions,  and  responsibilities  of  the  stakeholders  regarding  planning;  and  (ii)  a \nMinistry  of  Finance  recommendation  on  establishing  and  implementing  provincial  budgets.  The \ndecentralization  policy  enables  the  provinces  to  formulate  their  5-year  and  annual  socioeconomic \nplans and related budgets, and delegates the revenue collection tasks linked with these plans. Such \ndecentralization has implications on the transfer of specific activities such as maintenance contract \nmanagement,  project  management  for  smaller  roads,  various  procurement  activities,  etc.,  to  the \nDPWT. It will require a definitive building of technical and administrative capacities at the district and \nprovincial levels, especially in the DPWTs.  \n \n\n                                                 \n17 Government  of  the  Lao  PDR,  Lao  PDR  Committee  for  Planning  and  Investment.  2006.

Now  included  in  the  NSEDP  6,  the  National  Growth  and  Poverty \n38. \nEradication Strategy places poverty eradication and acceleration of social development as the \ncountry's primary long-term strategic goals.21 The three pillars of the strategy are (i) economic \ngrowth with equity, (ii) sociocultural development, and (iii) sustainable environment preservation. \nThe  four  priority  sectors  for  ensuring  poverty  reduction  are  agriculture,  health,  education,  and \ninfrastructure.  Thus,  a  key  presupposition  of  the  government  is  that  improvement  of  the \ntransport sector (i.e., infrastructure) will lead to poverty reduction. \n \nThe  government's  recent  draft  strategy  for  transport  sector  development  adopts  a \n39. \nmulticriteria analysis for prioritizing projects based on the following factors (in descending order \nof  weight):  (i) \nimpacting \nsocioeconomic  or  poverty  eradication,  (iv)  serving  national  integration  and  defense,  and \n(v) serving  large  populations  (footnote  6).  These  prioritization  criteria  reflect  the  government's \npolicy  of  improving  the  connectivity  with  neighboring  countries.  The  strategy  indicates  that  a \nsubregional project is five times more important than a project serving a large population, and it \nis  60%  more  important  than  a  project  serving  socioeconomic  development  and  poverty \nreduction.  This  has  policy  implications  on  giving  higher  importance  to  developing  international \nlinks,  such  as  regional  roads,  as  compared  with  providing  access  to  remote  areas  within  the \ncountry by developing provincial and rural roads. \n \n\nlinking  provinces  and  Vientiane,  (iii) \n\ninternational \n\nlinks,  (ii) \n\nIII. \n\nADB STRATEGY AND PROGRAM \n\nSector Strategy, 1991\u20132011 \n\nA. \n \nAppendix  4  provides  details  of  the  country  strategies  adopted  by  ADB  in  the  Lao  PDR \n40. \nfrom 1991 to 2011. These have evolved in accordance with national and regional demands. The \n1991 and 1996 operational strategies adopted sustainable economic growth as a strategic focus. \nUnder these country operational strategies, ADB identified development challenges for improving \nthe physical infrastructure, particularly national and provincial roads, river ports, and airports. The \ncountry  assistance  plan,  2001\u2013200322  also  emphasized  economic  growth  but  paid  particular \nattention  to  providing  more  balanced  development.  By  highlighting  improvement  in  public \nexpenditure  management,  ADB  saw  a  great  demand  for  building  capacity  in  road  planning  and \nsustainable  operation  and  maintenance  of  road  networks.  The  next  country  strategies  and \nprograms (CSPs) and updates,23 which emphasized poverty reduction and covered 2002\u20132008, \nwere more concerned with rural access roads and small airports to promote rural\u2013urban market \nlinks. Appendix 4 also provides an evolution in the specific thematic areas. Significantly, there was \nincreasing  emphasis  on  GMS  roads  to  create  transport  links  in  line  with  subregional  integration \nand cooperation  within the region. The current  CSP 2007\u2013201124 also adopts poverty reduction \nas  a  priority.  While  it  seeks  to  maintain  previous  lines  of  assistance,  it  recommends  expanding \nADB support to the GMS Program, focusing on the improvement of transport corridors for trade \nand tourism. TA on transport has shifted from the introduction of regulatory frameworks on user \ncharges to formulating a transport sector strategy and sustaining the RMF. \n \n\n                                                 \n21 Government of the Lao PDR. 2003.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n41. \n\n \n\nThe above analysis leads to three main inferences: \n(i) \n\nThe  ADB  transport  sector  strategy  in  the  Lao  PDR  has  supported  the \ngovernment, and has evolved to focus more on regional roads (i.e., through the \nGMS Program) to improve connectivity with neighboring countries, even as it has \nexited from the civil aviation subsector. \nThere has been a growing awareness of the need to ensure the sustainability of \nprojects, although what ADB will do in this area has not been clearly identified. \nRural roads is currently an emerging subsector for ADB in the Lao PDR. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nSector Program \n\n \nB. \n \n42. \nADB has been involved in the Lao PDR transport sector since 1979 when it first provided \nTA for the Vientiane Plain Road Improvement Project. During the 1980s, assistance for the Lao \nPDR\u2019s transport sector was concentrated on the road subsector. In 1992, ADB first entered the \ncountry\u2019s civil aviation subsector, which was made possible by the approval of the Civil Aviation \nMaster Plan in August 1992 (Appendix 1). \n \n43. \nOver  the  years,  ADB  has  approved  14  loans  totaling  $363.0  million,  32  TA  projects \ntotaling $16.1 million, and 1 grant worth $27.0 million. Out of the 14 loans approved, only 2 were \nnot  specifically  for  the  road  subsector:  the  Airports  Improvement  Project  in  the  civil  aviation \nsubsector and the GMS: Mekong Tourism Development Project in both the civil aviation and the \nroad  subsectors.  There  were  13  loans  in  the  road  subsector\u20144  were  approved  in  the  1980s, \n5 were approved in the 1990s, and 4 were approved in the 2000s.25 The assistance for the civil \naviation  subsector  amounted  to  $16.8  million,  while  the  assistance  for  the  road  subsector \namounted  to  $350.9  million.26  Using  the  categorization  mentioned  in  para.  14,  Figure  3 \nillustrates the distribution of ADB-financed project capital investments and TA for the Lao PDR\u2019s \ntransport sector. \n \n\nFigure 3: ADB Assistance for the Transport Sector \n\nLoans ($ million)a\n\nAirports, 5%\n\nTechnical Assistance ($'000)\n\nCivil Aviation, \n11%\n\nProvincial or \nRural Roads, \n24%\n\nFeeder \nRoads, 4%\n\nNational \nRoads, 67%\n\n \n\nRoads, 89%\n\n \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank. \na  These relate to civil works costs only. \nSource:  Asian  Development  Bank  project  management  database.  For  completed  projects,  actual  data  from  the \nproject completion report are used. For ongoing projects, data from the reports and recommendation of the \nPresident are used. \n\n \n44. \nAs for the TA projects, five projects were approved for the civil aviation subsector totaling \n$1.8 million, while the rest were projects for the road subsector. Out of the 5 TA projects in the civil \n\n                                                 \n25 This includes the GMS: Mekong Tourism Development Project. \n26 Includes investments in Louang Namtha airport and access road improvements under the GMS: Mekong Tourism \n\nDevelopment Project. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\n(Phase \n\nInformation  System \n\naviation subsector, 3 were approved during the 1990s, and the rest were approved after. The 26 TA \nprojects in the road subsector were mostly during the 1980s and the 1990s. Only one TA, Vientiane \nPlain Road Improvement, was approved before 1980 and only four TA projects excluding those on \nManagement \n(Supplementary)\u2014Strengthening  Social  and \nII) \nEnvironmental Management Capacity in DOR, Roads for Rural Development, Northern Economic \nCorridor, and Northern GMS Transport Network Improvement, were approved after 1999. \n \n45. \nADB\u2019s  road  subsector  program  can  be  broadly  divided  into  two  categories  based  on  the \nmode  of  lending\u2014the  Lao  PDR  country  program  that  has  supported  various  levels  of  road \nimprovements from national roads to rural roads; and the GMS regional program that has supported \nmainly national roads connecting the international borders. The regional roads referred in this SAPE \nfall  under  the  latter  category.  Table  2  summarizes  the  categories  adopted  for  the  purpose  of  this \nSAPE.  The  CSP  2007\u20132011  includes  both  these  categories.  The  objective  of  separating  these \nprograms  is  to  highlight  the  need  for  scaling  up  assistance  for  the  provincial  and  rural  roads  to \nfurther improve the development effectiveness (para. 118). \n \n\nTable 2: Category of ADB Assistance in the Lao PDR Road Subsector \n\nLao PDR Country Program \nNational roads connecting domestic economic \ncenters \n\nGMS Regional Program \nNational roads or highways connecting \ninternational borders (mentioned as regional roads \nin the SAPE) \n \nMinimal rural roads adjacent to the highways \n\nFeeder, provincial, and rural roads \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, GMS = Greater Mekong Subregion, Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, \nSAPE = sector assistance program evaluation. \nSource: ADB project management database. \n \nIn the road subsector, loans amounting to $337 million are divided: $15 million went to \n46. \nfeeder roads, $85 million went to provincial and rural roads, and $237 million went to national \nroads and highways.27 This indicates the focus on national roads. \n \nIn addition to the rural roads included in the transport portfolio, ADB provided assistance \n47. \nthrough  the  agriculture and  rural  development  lending  window.  These  rural  roads  are  typically \nfarm-to-market  roads,  as  well  as  selected  district  roads  connecting  district  centers.  ADB's \ncompleted and ongoing assistance has contributed to the improvement of about 796 km of such \nroads in the Lao PDR (TableA1.3). The rural roads component has varied between 12.7% and \n34.5% of total project investments. \n \n48. \nADB  had  only  one  project  in  the  civil  aviation  subsector  in  the  1990s,  after  which  it \nvirtually exited from the sector. In 2002, ADB reentered in this subsector by providing a loan for \nairport  infrastructure  improvement  (extension  and  rehabilitation  of  Louang  Namtha  airport) \naimed at tourism development.28 Currently, assistance to this subsector forms 7% of total ADB \nassistance to the Lao PDR transport sector. This is a reflection of ADB's priorities presented in \nits second medium-term strategy, which provided a low priority for civil aviation projects.29 The \ncurrent  Strategy  2020  continues  to  focus  on  other  infrastructure  areas,  implying  that  civil \naviation is not a core area.30 \n                                                 \n27 Some  provincial  roads  were  designed  as  rural  roads.  Subsequently,  several  were  recategorized  by  MPWT  as \n\nnational roads. However, their primary use continues to be mainly agriculture-related. \n\n28 The project also includes rehabilitation of access roads to tourist destinations. \n29 ADB. 2006.

The  Northern  GMS  Network  Improvement  Project  was  processed  as \nscheduled  in  the  CSP  2007\u20132011.  Although  the  pipeline  of  the  CSP  2007\u20132011  included  the \nsecond  Northern  GMS  Network  Improvement  Project  for  processing  in  2008,  this  has  been \ndelayed.  Similarly,  the  ADTA  for  Building  Sector  Program  Readiness  in  the  Transportation \nSector to be approved in 2008 has been combined with the Southern Network Transport Project \nto be approved in 2012. Thus, the overall implementation performance of the CSP 2007\u20132011 \nhas  been  mixed.  For  the  earlier  CSPs,  GMS  loans  for  the  East\u2013West  Economic  Corridor, \nNorthern Economic Corridor, and Northern GMS Transport Network Improvement projects were \napproved  as  planned.  However,  assistance  for  rural  roads  (e.g.,  the  Rural  Access  Roads  II \nProject) to rehabilitate the national road network (as identified in the current CSP) has not yet \nbeen approved. Efforts are under way to process this assistance in a modified form. \n \n50. \nADB's portfolio of loan and grant projects has witnessed several implementation issues \nsuch  as  cost  overruns,  implementation  delays,  counterpart  funding,  and  contractor  problems. \nOut of the 10 evaluated road projects, half reported varying amounts of cost overruns. The five \nprojects  with  major  cost  overruns  (over  20%)  showed  actual  civil  works  costs  for  road \nimprovements  that  were  greater  than  appraisal  estimates.  In  fact,  9  of  the  10  evaluated  road \nprojects experienced cost overruns or increase in costs due to various reasons surrounding cost \nescalations  of  various  natures.  For  example,  the  Second  Road  Improvement  Project  overshot \nthe  appraisal  target for  civil  works cost  by  85%  and  needed  additional  funds  to  be  transferred \nfrom the Sixth Road Improvement Project to complete its original scope (Appendix 1). The Sixth \nRoad Improvement Project faced higher than expected civil works costs causing an indirect cost \noverrun fueling a reduction in project scope. \n \n51. \nTable  A6.2  describes  evaluated  road  projects  with  cost  overruns  or  increase  in  costs \n(linked  to  change  in  project  scope)  in  their  civil  works  or  road  improvement  components.  In \nseveral cases, cost overruns have been addressed through a reduction in project scope, which \ntends to reduce the effectiveness of the projects. In others, increase in costs reflected a change \nin  scope  of  works,  as  loan  savings  created  by  currency  fluctuations  benefited  the  budgets  of \nongoing projects. This has been more common in recent years when cost overruns have been \nreduced due to low bid prices and depreciation of the kip, enabling ADB to use loan savings to \nincrease  the  scope  of  works.  The  Xieng  Khouang  Road  Improvement  Project  and  the  GMS: \nEast\u2013West  Economic  Corridor  Project  are  examples  of  loan  savings  being  used  to  fund \nadditional works. Para. 91 brings out the issue about the lack of adequate economic analysis at \ncompletion of the increased project scope. \n \n52. \nIn the civil aviation sector, the Airports Improvement Project (Appendix 1) faced a 209% \nincrease  in  cost  due  to  the  change  in  scope  of  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency \n(JICA) component. This resulted from inadequate information available at appraisal. Besides the \ncost  overrun,  the  project  also  witnessed  implementation  delays  of  more  than  4  years.  The \nunderlying causes of this implementation performance were as follows. \n\n(i) \n\nLack of adequate coordination among cofinanciers. Besides ADB, the project \nwas  cofinanced  by  JICA,  Nordic  Development  Fund,  Organization  of  Petroleum \nExporting  Countries  (OPEC)  Fund  for  International  Development,  and  the \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\ngovernments  of  France  and  Thailand.  This  created  additional  implementation \nburdens  on  the  executing  agency.  The  changes  in  project  scope  and  the \nincrease in the costs of components financed by other cofinanciers affected the \nimplementation performance. \nInstitutional constraints. The executing agency, originally the National Airports \nAuthority  (and  the  Department  of  Civil  Aviation),  were  unfamiliar  with  ADB \nprocedures  relating  to  procurement  of  consultants  and  contractors.  This  led  to \nstart-up delays and subsequently slow approvals for payments. \n\n(ii) \n\n \n53. \nImplementation delays. ADB's transport sector projects in the Lao PDR faced average \ncompletion delays  of  about  35  months  (Table A6.3),  which  is  higher  than  the  ADB  average  of \n24 months.31  In  projects  that  used  advanced  procurement,  the  major  causes  of  delay  were \nrelated  to  the  inexperience  of  the  executing  agency  in  project  administration  and  in  ADB \nprocesses,  mobilization  of  the  required  implementation  structure,  delayed  counterpart  funding, \ndelays in preparation of tender documents, and contractor problems. For the remaining projects, \ndelays  were  caused  by  the  late  engagement  of  consultants,  slow  mobilization  of  equipment, \ndesign changes and/or additional work, and the prolonged and tedious procurement process of \nthe  government.  Other  factors  that  affected  the  completion  of  civil  works  include  physical \nconditions  such  as  massive  landslides  (e.g.,  the  Fourth  Road  Improvement  Project)  and \ndiscoveries  of  deeply  buried  unexploded  ordnances  (e.g.,  East\u2013West  Economic  Corridor \nProject). Delayed counterpart funding continues to be a major cause of implementation delays, \nand was a cause in 4 out of the 10 completed road projects. \n \n54. \nUntil  the  early  1990s,  start-up  delays  were  common  due  to  procurement  issues,  contract \naward delays, delayed engineering design, and contractor mobilization delays. From 1993, with the \napproval of the Sixth Road Improvement Project, ADB allowed advance procurement prior to loan \napproval for early contracting of goods or works.32 This partly contributed to reducing the start-up \ndelays  as  evidenced  in  the  subsequent  projects.  Some  projects,  such  as  the  Champasack  Road \nImprovement  Project,  benefited  from  advance  action,  while  others,  such  as  the  Xieng  Khouang \nRoad  Improvement  Project,  faced  start-up  delays  despite  advance  action.  Although  advance \nprocurement helped facilitate preparatory activities, it did not guarantee timely completion of projects \nsince  other  factors  tended  to  impinge  on  construction.  However,  the  SAPE  encourages  advance \nprocurement, which needs to continue since it provides time savings at project start-up; however, \nproject-readiness filters are needed to control start-up delays. Discussions with ADB project staff in \nthe Lao PDR indicated that such filters are being developed to assess the institutional preparedness \nwithin the government to implement new projects. Appendix 6 provides details of the implementation \nperformance  of  projects  with  and  without  advance  action.  It  shows  that  although  advance \nprocurement  action  helped  in  reducing  start-up  delays,  other  implementation  issues  persisted \nindicating continued difficulties faced by the executing agency in implementation. \n \nContractor problems. The Lao PDR has encouraged the growth of private contracting \n55. \nfirms, some of which are offshoots of former state-owned enterprises. However, most of these \nnational  firms  lack  experience  in  technical  and  commercial  aspects.  With  limited  financial \n\n                                                 \n31 ADB. 2008. Annual Report on 2007 Portfolio Performance. Manila. \n32 Under Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time), advance action may be allowed to authorize \nprocurement  prior  to  loan  approval,  particularly  when  early  contracting  of  goods  or  works  is  seen  as  crucial  for  the \ntimely completion of a project. In such cases, ADB encourages borrowers to comply with its procurement procedures \nincluding the required advertising for the contracts to be eligible for ADB financing. The guidelines also stipulate that \nthe advance actions undertaken should be subject to ADB review and taken at the risk of borrowers. Any concurrence \nby  ADB  with  the  procedures,  documentation,  or  proposal  for  award  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the  project. \nRetroactive financing or reimbursements may be permitted within the limits specified in the financing agreement. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\ncapacities, they often face difficulties in purchasing equipment and completing the construction \nactivities on schedule. Yet there has been growing encouragement from MPWT and multilateral \nagencies  to  award  contracts  to  the  national  firms.  However,  this  needs  to  be  matched  by \nadequate  capacity  within  these  firms,  which  currently  is  lacking.  The  issue  of  contractor \nperformance  was  quite  distinct  on  the  Rural  Access  Roads  Project  and  the  Roads  for  Rural \nDevelopment  Project,  which  used  national  contractors  in  an  effort  to  develop  local  capacities. \nWhile  this  justification  was  seen  as  appropriate,  the  national  contractors  were  not  capable  of \ndelivering  the  civil  works  as  per  the  project  requirements,  leading  to  cost  overruns  and \nimplementation  delays.  Better  implementation  of  procurement  rules  during  selection  of  the \ncontractors, as well as close supervision, is needed. \n \n56. \nImplementation  of  rural  roads  as  part  of  agriculture  projects.  Para.  47  provides \ndetails  of  rural  roads  funded  within  the  scope  of  agriculture  projects.  These  road  project \ncomponents  were  executed  either  by  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Forestry  or  the  provincial \ngovernments,  but  they  were  implemented  by  the  provincial  Department  of  Construction, \nTransport, Post, and Communication (now referred as DPWTs). This setup has ensured that the \nroad interventions are integrated into broader agriculture-driven rural development. The Shifting \nCultivation Stabilization Project, completed in 2006, witnessed cost and environmental impacts \ndue to changes in physical road designs. The quality of outputs was adequate. DPWT capacity \nremains  limited  to  manage  these  road  improvement  projects,  as  does  sustainability  given  the \nmeager funding for maintenance. \n \n\n2. \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\nTA  projects  amounted  to  $16.10  million,  out  of  which  the  road  subsector  received \n57. \n$14.32 (89%)  million  and  the  civil  aviation  subsector  $1.78  million.  Of  the  32  TA  projects \napproved from 1979 for the transport sector, 15 were classified as project preparatory technical \nassistance  (PPTA)  projects  and  17  were  classified  as  ADTA  projects  (Appendix  7).  ADB \napproved PPTA for the GMS: Louangphrabang Airport Improvement Project in December 2006. \nAfter a gap of 4 years, ADB approved another PPTA for the proposed Second Northern GMS \nTransport  Network  Improvement  Project  in  2010,  which  is  ongoing.  An  associated  TA  to  the \nRural Access Roads Project (approved in December 2000) was the last ADTA provided by ADB \nas part of the country program, indicating a gap in TA by ADB. \n \n58. \nProject  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  roads.  The  objectives  of  most  PPTA \nroad projects were to carry out technical and economic feasibility studies for the improvement \nand/or  rehabilitation  of  roads,  formulate  project  designs,  and  assess  the  capabilities  of \ninstitutions tasked to undertake road construction and maintenance operations. \n \n59.  Most TA activities as envisaged were completed. The feasibility studies and TA reports \nwere used as inputs to the formulation of road projects. At least nine PPTA projects for roads \nresulted  in  the  approval  of  project  loans  and  one  grant  project.  Yet,  analysis  of  start-up  and \nimplementation  delays  as  well  as  subsequent  scope  reductions  (para.  51)  indicate  that  PPTA \nprojects did not seek to improve project designs over the last decade. The only change was in \nbringing  in  advance  procurement  (para.  54).  In  view  of  this,  the  incremental  value  addition  by \nthe PPTA projects can be improved, especially in the area of project design. \n \n60. \nProject  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  civil  aviation.  The  objectives  of  PPTA \nprojects for civil aviation were to update the Civil Aviation Master Plan, provide the framework \nfor  sustainable  and  effective  development  of  the  civil  aviation  sector,  upgrade  airport  designs \nand facilities, and support tourism and trade through the integration of the Lao PDR in the GMS \nair  traffic  network.  There  were  no  reports  available  describing  the  actual  outputs  of  these  TA \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nprojects, except in the case of the Civil Aviation Master Plan. This small-scale TA helped update \nthe  civil  aviation  master  plan,  formulate  suitable  arrangements  for  its  implementation,  and \nresulted in the approval of the Airports Improvement Project (Appendix 1). \n \nAdvisory  technical  assistance  for  roads.  Most  ADTA  projects  for  the  road  subsector \n61. \nwere  attached  to  project  loans.  ADTA  projects  for  roads  and  highways  focused  on  providing \ncapacity  development  and  institutional  support  to  MPWT  for  operations  and  road  maintenance, \nbridge  management,  and  privatization  of  government-owned  road  transport  organizations. \nSpecific  forms  of  interventions  included  the  conduct  of  studies;  formulation  of  policy  guidelines, \nlegal framework, and investment plans; provision of on-the-job  training to  officers  and staff; and \nimprovement of systems and procedures on planning and budgeting. Some TA projects included \nthe  recommendation  of  mitigation  measures  to  address  potential  adverse  environmental  and \nsocial impacts of road projects (e.g., TA projects on East\u2013West Economic Corridor Coordination \nand Strengthening Social and Environmental Management Capacity in the DOR). \n \n62. \nADB approved the last ADTA in 2000, pausing ADB's efforts at capacity building in the \ncountry.  Between  2000  and  2009,  ADB  has  only  approved  ADTA  embedded  in  the  regional \ndevelopment  framework  for  promoting  transport  and  trade  facilitation  within  the  GMS.  These \nregional TA projects are aimed at (i) streamlining and strengthening institutional mechanisms for \naddressing regional transport and trade facilitation initiatives, and (ii) strengthening institutional \ncapacity within GMS countries to undertake initiatives for GMS transport and trade facilitation. \nAppendix  8  provides  a  summary  of  these  regional  TA  projects  and  shows  that  although  they \nprovided substantial contribution to trade facilitation and regional transport development, there \nwas  limited  assistance  toward  areas  of  domestic  transport  development  such  as  safeguard \nimplementation, rural road network expansion, and maintenance planning and funding.33 \n \n63. \nFollowing a process of policy dialogue and capacity development assistance that began \nin  the  mid-1990s,  ADB  provided  a  capacity  development  program  loan  to  support  improved \nenvironmental  management  and  social  safeguards  in  the  energy  and  transport  sectors.  The \nEnvironment  and  Social  Program  has  partly  achieved  its  expected  outcome.  At  the  national \nlevel,  it  succeeded  in  putting  in  place  streamlined  procedures  for  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards.  However,  at  the  subnational  level,  the  achievement  was  somewhat  less,  with  the \nprogram only partly achieving expected improvements in environmental and social management \nof both energy and transport projects.34 \n \nOverall,  the  Environment  and  Social  Program  was  borderline  successful.35  Program \n64. \noutputs  were  generally  achieved,  with  the  exception  of  the  Environment  Protection  Fund.  In \nterms  of  sector  achievements,  the  energy  and  transport  sectors  established  the  required \nregulatory  framework  and  institutional  mechanism  to  undertake  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard  measures  on  their  own.  The  program  substantially  achieved  its  expected  output  of \nstrengthening the national policy and regulatory framework for environmental management and \nsocial safeguards. It also achieved its expected output of improving the subnational-level (sector \nand  provincial)  planning  and  policy  implementation  framework.  Both  the  national  and \n                                                 \n33 This was stated in the CSP 2007\u20132011 and continues to be relevant. \n34 With regard to the transport sector, there is evidence to suggest that the environmental management of transport \nprojects  has  improved  since  the  Environment  and  Social  Program  has  been  implemented;  however,  the \nperformance  depends  on  the  location.  Projects  in  sensitive  areas  have  sometimes  led  to  increased  soil  erosion \nduring construction and air pollution during implementation. The social benefits from transport projects are not easy \nto  quantify.  On  the  one  hand,  transport  corridors  have  certainly  contributed  to  enhanced  economic  growth  in  the \nproject areas, particularly with regard to improving market access. On the other hand, transport projects have not at \ntimes been carried out with due attention to resettled persons and ethnic minorities. \n\n35 ADB.  2010.  Performance  Evaluation  Report:  Environment  and  Social  Program  in  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic \n\nRepublic. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nsubnational framework components of the program were successful. The sustainable financing \nmechanisms component, including the Environment Protection Fund, was partly successful. \n \n65. \nEight ADTA projects were completed, out of which six were assessed by IED's PPERs. \nOf these, one was highly successful, five were successful, and one was partly successful. The \nTA on Roads for Rural Development was highly successful. Among the five ADTA projects rated \nsuccessful  were  the  TA  projects  on  Feeder  Roads  Maintenance  Training  and  Management \nInformation  System  in  MCTPC,  which  were  both  attached  to  the  Champasack  Road \nImprovement Project. In the case of the TA on Feeder Roads Maintenance Training, the PPER \nclaimed  that  the  effectiveness  of  the  training  could  not  be  distinguished  from  other  capacity-\nbuilding  measures  implemented  by  MCTPC.  Also  rated  successful  were  the  TA  on  the \nPrivatization  and  Management  of  Road  Sector  Institutions,  Management  Information  System \n(Phase II), and East\u2013West Economic Corridor Coordination.36 Those rated successful to highly \nsuccessful  contributed  in  formulating  policy  guidelines  and  providing  strategic  direction  to  the \nroad  subsector  in  the  Lao  PDR.  The  TA  on  Bridge  Management  attached  to  the  Fourth  Road \nImprovement  Project  was  rated  partly  successful,  as  it  was  found  to  be  ineffective  in  building \ncapacities  or  establishing  functioning  systems  required  for  instituting  an  effective  bridge \nmanagement system.37 \n \n66. \nThe main issues from the evaluation of ADTA projects revolve around the lack of funding \nfor  road  maintenance  and  inadequate  equipment  and  human  resources.  Efforts  to  address \nthese  were  observed  to  be  slow  but  progressing.  Completion  and  evaluation  reports  on  these \nADTA projects recommended the need to (i) further develop capacity in road maintenance and \noperations;  (ii)  sustain  the  gains  obtained  through  training  and  actual  use  of  manuals  and \nguidelines;  (iii)  encourage  ownership  and  accountability  to  pursue  policy  reforms,  particularly \nthose  related  to  the  privatization  process;  (iv)  participate  in  cross-border  commerce;  and \n(v) avoid overlapping donor assistance and ensure efficiency in resource allocation. \n \nAdvisory  technical  assistance  for  civil  aviation.  One  ADTA  was  provided  for  civil \n67. \naviation  for  the  Institutional  Strengthening  of  the  National  Airports  Authority  and  Lao  Civil \nAviation,  attached  to  the  Airports  Improvement  Project  (Appendix  1).  The  objective  of  this  TA \nwas  to  formulate  long-term  business  plans  for  the  National  Airports  Authority  and  Lao  Civil \nAviation  and  transform  them  into  market-oriented  organizations.  This  TA  reviewed  the \noperational and financial procedures, established a computerized financial control system and a \nmanagement \nfinancial \naccounting  in  both  organizations.  The  PCR  on  the  Airports  Improvement  Project  found  the \nperformance  of  the  TA  consultants  satisfactory  and  that  the  government  appreciated  the \neffectiveness of the TA. \n \n\ninformation  system,  and  prepared  comprehensive  manuals  on \n\nIV. \n\nEVALUATION OF ADB ASSISTANCE \n\n68. \nEvaluation of the Lao PDR transport sector is based on six evaluation criteria identified \nby  IED's  draft  Revised  Guidelines  for  the  Preparation  of  Country  Assistance  Program \nEvaluations (footnote 2). Overall assessment is based on the cumulative evaluation of strategic \n                                                 \n36 The TA on East\u2013West Economic Corridor Coordination was rated highly successful in the 2008 PPER of the GMS \nEast\u2013West Corridor Project (ADB. 2008.

The  report  found  that  none  of  the  intended  outputs  were  available  or  in  use.  For \nexample, the TA included development of manuals and guidelines for\u00a0inspection and maintenance of bridges and a \ncentralized  computer-based  bridge  management  information  system.  Such  outputs  were  not  tangible  at \npostevaluation. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\npositioning, relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, sustainability, and development impacts. These \ncriteria are weighted as indicated in para. 164. \n \nA. \n\nStrategic Positioning \n\n69. \nStrategic positioning of the Lao PDR transport sector strategy is satisfactory, with room \nfor improvement in certain areas. The CSP 2007\u20132011 is structured to include transport sector \nfinancing  under  the  regional  cooperation  umbrella,  which  has  a  separate  ADF  allocation  and \nreflected the government's inclination toward regional cooperation. The CSP results framework \nincludes  limited  market  access  and  limited  access  to  infrastructure  as  the  key  constraints \nidentified under the NSEDP 6. To address these constraints, the CSP identifies interventions for \nADB  funding  during  2007\u20132011.  ADB\u2019s  core  competency  of  funding  road  improvement  has \nbeen  correctly  reflected  in  its strategic  position in  the  Lao PDR.  ADB  is  the lead  development \npartner for road subsector and effectively co-chairs the infrastructure working group (para. 36). \nThis provides ADB with an opportunity to add value in the development effectiveness process. \n \nADB  strategies  in  the  Lao  PDR  have  been  consistently  focused  on  road  improvements \n70. \nand provision of all-weather access. Issues related to access to remote areas must be addressed, \nbut the current CSP focus on regional roads appears to overshadow this focus (para. 40). \n \nAppendix 6 provides an assessment of the implementation of past CSPs. It shows ADB's \n71. \npropensity to fund both road and airport projects. Funding constraints have slowed the overall \nimplementation  of  these  strategies,  including  that  of  the  current  CSP.  For  example,  although \nADB  intended  to  assist  in  securing  sustainable  maintenance  of  the  road  network  through  the \nRMF, there has been no incremental assistance from ADB for improving the sustainability of the \nRMF to prevent overlap with the World Bank\u2019s assistance. \n \nCurrently,  ADB  provides  100%  grants  to  the  Lao  PDR  based  on  the  ADF  X  policy.38  The \n72. \ncurrent CSP is based on the earlier ADF IX policy, which provided up to 50% grants for the country. \nAlthough this has helped the Lao PDR in reducing the impact on its budget, actual ADF funding is \nsubject to the performance-based allocation. The ADF allocation for the Lao PDR for 2007 and 2008 \nwas  set  at  $40.2  million  in  total  compared  with  $45  million\u2013$55  million  per  year  on  average  as \nindicated in the CSP 2002\u20132004. In addition, ADF funding of $40.0 million was programmed for the \nGMS  Program  for  2007\u20132009,  or  an  annual  average  of  about  $13.0  million.  As  per  the  current \nprogram, the Lao PDR has been provided a biennial allocation of $150.56 million for 2009\u20132010, \nwhich includes an adjustment in response to the global economic crisis. These allocations cover all \nthe sectors of ADB assistance, and the relatively small size of the assistance highlights the funding \nconstraints faced by the transport sector. \n \n73. \nTo  address  this  funding  constraint,  ADB  has  applied  selectivity  in  its  programming. \nHowever, there is a disconnect between the assistance (i.e., regional cooperation projects) and \nthe  sector  road  map,  which  is  relatively  inward  looking.  The  CSP's  pipeline  of  projects  shows \nthat most transport projects will be funded out of the GMS Program, with only one being funded \nthrough the country program (i.e., the Southern Transport Network Project is intended for grant \napproval  in  2012).  Although  the  CSP  acknowledges  investment  needs  in  the  transport  sector \n(e.g.,  road  safety  and  enforcement  of  social  and  environmental  safeguards),  there  is  no  clear \nstrategy  to  provide  funding  in  these  areas.  Further,  the  CSP's  transport  sector  road  map \ncomprises sector-wide output indicators (e.g., provinces without all-weather road access, share \nof paved national highways, paved roads in general, and increase in maintenance funding) that \n\n                                                 \n38 The ninth replacement of ADF, ADB\u2019s major source of concessional financing, covering the period from 2009 to 2012. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nare specific and measurable, but the corresponding outcome indicators are difficult to measure. \nFor  example,  road  transport  user  costs  and  access  in  the  rainy  season  need  to  be  measured \nusing a consistent tool before the start of CSP and at completion. The CSP, however, does not \nprovide the source of these data, making it difficult to monitor these outcomes. \n \n74. \nADB  has  appropriately  adopted  an  integrated  approach  for  designing  agriculture \nprojects,  and  often  combines  rural  roads  with  agriculture  sector  interventions.  Para.  56  details \nthe implementation performance of the rural roads that have been included within the scope of \nagriculture  projects.  This  integrated  approach  has  enabled  complementary  investments  in  the \nrural  roads  and  agriculture  subsectors,  which  contributed  to  positive  impacts  such  as \ndiversification of incomes made possible by the road improvement.39 In view of this, it is prudent \nfor  ADB  to  continue  this  integrated  project  design.  However,  this  needs  to  be  planned  and \nimplemented, taking into account the following factors: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nEnsure that the rural roads are in line with the wider MPWT network rehabilitation \nprogram.  This  will  enable  sector-wide  connectivity  and  link  rural  areas  with  the \nnational economy. \nThe Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and MPWT need to coordinate with each \nother  at  programming  stage  to  prioritize  road  rehabilitation  projects.  This  is \ncrucial to ensure synergies among the subsectors. \nImprove  coordination  within  ADB.  Transport  and  agriculture  divisions  of  the \nSoutheast Asia Department need to coordinate with each other at programming \nstage to capture the synergies at the country level. \nEnsure  sustainability  of  the  rural  roads  by  policy  dialogue  and  improving  local \ncapacities (para. 111). \nRecognize the limited capacity at the district and provincial levels while designing \ncomplex projects. \nUse appropriate road construction technology that will ensure cost-effectiveness \nand will match the demand in terms of traffic volume and composition. \n\n \n75. \nADB has had limited involvement in the inland waterways sector and even less so in the \nrailways. Taking into consideration the limited funding available through the country program as \nwell  as  through  the  regional  cooperation  window  and  its  core  competencies,  it  is  deemed \nappropriate that ADB focuses its assistance on the road subsector. \n \nB. \n\nRelevance \n\nThe Lao PDR transport sector assistance is relevant based on (i) the degree to which ADB \n76. \nassistance was consistent with country needs and ADB strategic priorities, (ii) the quality-at-entry \nof  ADB  assistance,  and  (iii)  harmonization  with  development  partners.  These  subcriteria  are \nclosely  linked  with  those  for  strategic  positioning.  While  relevance  is  focused  on  the  assistance \nprogram of loans, grants, and TA projects, strategic positioning assesses the coherence and the \nstrategic bearing of the subsectors. The rating for the relevance of the transport sector assistance \nwas affected by the quality-at-entry, which is discussed in paras. 80\u201383. \n \nADB assistance has focused on the road subsector since the early 1990s. ADB projects \n77. \nhave  been  drawn  from  the  list  of  projects  planned  by  the  government  as  part  of  its \nsocioeconomic  development  plans.  Transport  infrastructure  development  has  long  been \nperceived  as  the  main  remedy  for  the  country's  economic  constraints.  ADB  has  successfully \ncontributed  to  this  need  by  funding  road  infrastructure  in  various  parts  of  the  country.  ADB \n                                                 \n39 ADB.  2007.  Completion  Report:  Shifting  Cultivation  Stabilization  Pilot  Project  in  the  Lao  People's  Democratic \n\nRepublic. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nassistance has typically been focused on upgrading the national trunk roads to provide cross-\ncountry  connections  to  the  PRC  and  Thailand.  Such  assistance  has  formed  67%  of  the  loan \nportfolio.  Since  2000,  ADB  has  also  provided  funding  for  rural  roads  in  an  effort  to  enhance \npoverty reduction by providing access to rural areas. \n \n78. \nEarly national road projects were located in both northern as well as southern areas of the \ncountry.  The  focus  on  regional  cooperation  and  integration  created  a  further  geographical \ndispersion  of  projects,  since  the  Lao  PDR  aimed  to  become  the  regional  hub  with  connections \nfrom  all  directions.  While  this  has  provided  a  major  contribution  to  developing  the  national  road \nnetwork, it would be difficult to attribute any specific impact of ADB assistance to any part of the \ncountry, as other development agencies have also been funding roads in the same geographical \nareas. The CSP 2007\u20132011 mentions that projects have witnessed high transaction costs due to \nthe  number  of  relatively  small  projects  throughout  the  country  causing  heavy  administrative \nburdens to the MPWT. This calls for a geographical concentration of the subprojects, especially \nsince  the  rehabilitation  of  the  national  road  network  has  progressed  substantially.  Moreover,  it \nwould be easier for the rural road subsector to have a more focused approach. \n \n79. \nThe Lao PDR's socioeconomic development plans have been consistent in their focus on \nroad development. In 2001, the government identified a basic development strategy up to 2020. \nOne  of  its  main  goals  was  to  modernize  economic  and  social  basic  infrastructure  to  facilitate \nregional and international integration (footnote 15). ADB projects have generally been rationalized \nalong the same lines, as they have been aimed at reducing transport constraints and stimulating \nagriculture development. This rationale has evolved in the last 10 years since the initiation of the \nXieng  Khouang  Road  Improvement  Project  and  the  East\u2013West  Economic  Corridor  Project.  This \nhas  coincided  with  the  government's  inclination  toward  regional  integration  as  identified  in  the \ngoals  of  the  Socioeconomic  Development  Strategy,  2001\u20132010,  which  seeks  to  \"improve  and \nestablish the basis for the economy to progress strongly in firm steps \u2026. develop our country to \nbecome the central point of transit of the region in the future\u201d (footnote 15). \n \n80. \nThe importance of rural development continues, as reflected in a goal of NSEDP, 2006\u2013\n2010, which aims \"to reduce the disparities between rural areas and urban centers, enhance the \ntransport  and  communications  networks  and  improve  the  living  conditions  of  the  rural  people, \nespecially  those  in  mountainous  and  remote  areas\"  (footnote  17).  In  other  words,  there  is  a \nneed to balance the investments for regional integration (external links) with those for ensuring \nall-weather  access  to  remote  areas  (internal  links).  ADB  assistance  has  included  two  projects \nfor  rural  roads  during  2000\u20132007,  and  such  funding  must  continue.  The  inclusion  of  regional \nprogram  in  the  ADB  portfolio  should  not  be  at  the  cost  of  country  program,  especially  that \ntargeted at rural road development. \n \n81. \nA  midterm  review  of  the  NSEDP  6  was  carried  out  by  the  government  in  November \n2008.40 This review stated that the most disadvantaged areas in terms of access to roads and \nsocial services remain the central southern and northern highlands and the northern lowlands. \nThus, it advocated higher priority for constructing all-weather roads to Phongsali, Salavan, and \nXaibouly provinces. The review also showed a significant variance across areas in term of per \ncapita public investment. In the northern region, which is less developed, the public investment \nper capita expenditure was KN252,000 per person, compared with KN144,000 per person in the \nsouthern region, which is relatively better economically developed. This has been attributed to \ndiscrepancy in development funding among the various geographic areas. \n \n                                                 \n40 Government  of  the  Lao  PDR.  2008.  Midterm  Review  of  the  Implementation  of  the  Sixth  National  Socioeconomic \n\nDevelopment Plan, 2006\u20132010. Vientiane. \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nThe quality of the design and monitoring frameworks in the reports and recommendation \n82. \nof  the  President  (RRPs)  and  PCRs  can  be  improved,  especially  in  relation  to  the  indicators  for \noutcomes and impacts. Efforts have been made by ADB to improve the quality since 2009. Output \nindicators  for  all  transport  assistance  have  been  specific  and  measurable,  typically  in  terms  of \nlength of roads improved. The outcome indicators have varied, with typical ones being economic \ninternal rates of return (EIRRs), traffic, vehicle operating costs, and time savings. In most cases, \nthese indicators have been generally improved. However, several PCRs did not provide specific \ntime-bound indicators for outcomes, which prevent their evaluation. Targeted impacts have been \nbroad, such as improvement in gross domestic product and social indicators. The attribution of the \nproject to these indicators is an issue, and difficulties associated with consistent measurement of \nindicators remain, e.g., the nature of social indicators varies among different projects. \n \nADB transport sector assistance has generally been harmonized with other development \n83. \npartners,  but  areas  of  improvement  remain.  Recently,  ADB  has  taken  the  lead  in  donor \ncoordination efforts by co-chairing the infrastructure sector working group along with MPWT and \nthe Embassy of Japan. This working group, with others, was set up in June 2005 to harmonize \ndevelopment  agency  efforts.  The  midterm  review  of  the  NSEDP  6  expressed  concern  over \nthese  working  groups  \"losing  momentum,  lacking  a  clear  mandate  and  a  work  plan\"  (footnote \n40).  Discussions  with  the  World  Bank  and  Sida  indicated  that  meetings  have  been  held, \nalthough  no  tangible  output  is  visible  apart  from  the  harmonization  of  investment  planning, \nwhich had been continuing. \n \n84. \nSome of the lessons from earlier projects have been incorporated into the improvements \nin  the  project  design  and  implementation  efficiency  but  there  remains  room  for  further \nimprovement.  A  project  performance  audit  report  of  the  Vientiane  Plain  Road  Improvement \nProject,  completed  as  early  as  1989,  recommended  that  ADB  should  monitor  the  executing \nagency's  institutional  development.41  Even  today,  MPWT  continues  to  face  institutional  capacity \nconstraints. In 1997, the project performance audit report on the Third Road Improvement Project \nreiterated  a  recommendation  for  institutional  reforms,  which  are  now  being  carried  out.  All \nevaluation reports have been unanimous in recommending the need for adequate maintenance. \nHowever, this area continues to be strained due to funding constraints (paras. 108\u2013112). \n \nC. \n\nEfficiency \n\n85. \nADB  assistance  is  less  efficient  based  on  the  portfolio  performance  and  economic \nviability  of  the  projects.  Portfolio  performance  is  based  on  the  assessment  of  implementation \npunctuality  and  cost  overruns.  Further,  EIRRs  measure  the  net  economic  benefits  of  ADB \nassistance and are typically benchmarked against a yardstick opportunity cost of capital of 12% \n(i.e.,  projects  with  EIRRs  of  more  than  12%  are  considered  efficient  and  those  with  EIRRs  of \nmore than 18% are considered highly efficient). \n \nBased  on  the  EIRR  criterion  alone,  out  of  the  5  completed  ADB  road  projects  between \n86. \n2000 and 2009, 1 project was found to be highly efficient, 3 were efficient, and 1 was less efficient \nas  reported  in  previous  evaluation  reports.  Two  of  these  projects  were  self-evaluated.  The \nefficiency ratings of the first four projects did not consider their implementation performance in the \nrating although these projects also had implementation issues. A recent evaluation by IED found \nthe  Rural  Access  Roads  Project  to  be  less  efficient,  owing  to  a  combination  of  low  economic \nbenefits accrued and implementation efficiency issues. Since ADB assistance has been mainly for \n\n                                                 \n41 The executing agency comprised a combination of MCPTC (now referred as MPWT) and the Vientiane Provincial \nPublic  Works  Department  (ADB.  1989.  Project  Performance  Audit  Report:  Vientiane  Plain  Road  Improvement \nProject in the Lao People's Democratic Republic. Manila). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21\n\nPortfolio  performance.  Paras.  49\u201355  analyze \n\nnational roads connecting domestic economic centers, earlier projects witnessed higher EIRRs at \ncompletion as compared with those expected at appraisal because there has been a faster-than-\nexpected  growth  in  traffic  on  those  roads.  On  the  other  hand,  national  roads  connecting \ninternational borders, i.e., regional roads that were expected to generate cross-border traffic have \nwitnessed lower-than-expected performance, being constrained by delayed implementation of the \ncross-border  transport  agreements  (footnote  36).  Similarly,  rural  access  roads  have  seen \nrelatively slower growth in traffic, resulting in lower EIRRs. The overall sector evaluation is based \non both the EIRR as well as the portfolio performance. \n \n87. \nThe lower economic viability of rural roads and, to a certain extent, of regional roads is \nexpected. For rural roads, the PPER for Rural Access Roads Project showed that (i) more time \nis  needed  for  a  road  project  benefits  to  be  captured  by  residents  in  rural  areas;  and  (ii)  other \ninterventions  are  essential  for  rural  road  improvement  benefits  to  be  captured  by  the  people, \nsuch  as  those  related  to  agriculture  and  alternative  livelihood  development.  Further,  road \nimprovement  alone  is  not  sufficient  to  ensure  economic  benefits.  Regarding  regional  roads, \nlegal and regulatory factors governing cross-border movement need to be addressed before the \nexpected economic benefits can be realized (footnote 36). \n \n88. \nthe  performance  of  program \nimplementation.  The  majority  of  the  transport  projects  have  witnessed  cost  overruns  and \nimplementation  delays.  The  cost  overruns,  which  were  caused  by  higher-than-expected  bid \nprices, have typically been accompanied by changes in project scope to accommodate funding \nconstraints. Para. 53 analyzes the causes of implementation delays. Although several of these \nfactors  have  been  addressed,  issues  remain,  such  as  contractor  problems  and  counterpart \nfunding  delays.  These  are  expected  to  be  addressed  through  close  cooperation  between  the \nSoutheast  Asia  Department's  Transport  Division  and  the  resident  mission  as  well  as  between \nADB and various government departments. \n \nOverall, the implementation performance of the transport projects has been less efficient \n89. \n(para. 50). Because MPWT and ADB are now more familiar with each other's procedures and the \nuse of project-readiness filters, the implementation efficiency could improve for future projects. \n \n90. \nLoan savings. Three projects witnessed loan savings owing to the depreciation of the \nkip: the Xieng Khouang Road Improvement Project, East\u2013West Economic Corridor Project, and \nRural Access Roads Project. In the case of the East\u2013West Economic Corridor Project, instead \nof  the  three  original  rural  roads,  a  total  of  nine  roads  were  rehabilitated  with  the  extra  loan \nsavings. In the Xieng Khouang Road Improvement Project and the Rural Access Roads Project, \nthe loan savings were used to rehabilitate additional feeder roads. In the East\u2013West Economic \nCorridor  Project,  the  rehabilitation  of  the  Kaysone  Phomvihane\u2013Xeno  road  (additional  work) \nmeant that about 32% of the total project cost was outside of the original scope and beyond the \neconomic appraisal before rehabilitation. \n \n91.  While including the additional works could have been defensible, ADB did not carry out \nadequate  economic  analysis  of  the  additional  works  at  completion  to  check  whether  the  loan \nsavings  had  been  used  efficiently.  The  inclusion  of  additional  works  was  subjected  to \nfollowed  up  during \npreliminary  environmental  and  social  assessments,  which  were \nimplementation  by  the  supervision  consultants.  The  approvals  for  the  reallocation  of  loan \nproceeds were carried out as per ADB instructions.42 \n \n\n                                                 \n42 ADB. 2003.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\nD. \n\nEffectiveness \n\n92. \nThe contribution of ADB assistance to the Lao PDR transport sector is effective, based on \nthe  extent  to  which  the  ADB  program  achieved  sector-specific  outcomes  and  institutional \ndevelopment outcomes. Typically, the majority of the outputs from road subsector projects can be \nsummarized in terms of physical accomplishments, such as km of road improved or constructed, \nnumbers of bridges improved or built, and/or km of road maintained. Outcomes of individual road \nprojects, though, are project-specific. The physical accomplishments have resulted in reduction in \ntravel time between key economic centers in the country, as well as between the rural areas and \nthe  cities.  This  has  contributed  to  enabling  improvement  in  trade  within  the  country,  as  well  as \nexternally. It has also led to increased investments in tourism, agriculture, and manufacturing. \n \n93.  While  these  benefits  are  generic,  the  demand  for  transport  services  in  the  Lao  PDR \nremains  low,  since  production  is  yet  to  develop  at  the  same  pace  as  the  development  of \nphysical infrastructure (footnote 36). The NSEDP 6 (footnote 17) states that the limited capacity \ncannot  make  efficient  use  of  the  investments  and  \"results  in  waste  and  a  reduction  of  cost-\neffectiveness  of  investments.\"  While  this  reduces  the  economic  viability  of  the  projects,  the \nbenefits  in  terms  of  all-weather  connectivity,  reduced  travel  times,  and  access  to  markets  and \nbasic productive assets remain important for inclusive development. \n \nADB's  policy  dialogue  has  been  effective  in  shaping  the  RMF,  supporting  capacity \n94. \ndevelopment,  mitigating  HIV/AIDS  linked  to  transport  improvement  projects,  and  promoting \nregional  cooperation.  This  dialogue  has  been  supported  by  investment  projects  and  TA. \nHowever,  room  for  improvement  in  capacity  development  remains,  as  confirmed  by  the  CSP \n2007\u20132011,  which  states  that  ADB's  efforts  at  capacity  development  in  core  areas  have  not \nbeen effective in enhancing institutional performance (e.g., safeguard implementation, rural road \nnetwork expansion, and maintenance planning and funding). This has been confirmed by IED's \nfield  assessment,  which  found  that  the  performance  of  MPWT  and  DPWTs  continues  to  be \naffected due to lack of adequate human resources.  \n \n95. \nAll  completed  ADB  projects  were  effective  in  reducing  transport  costs  and  travel  time \n(Appendix 1). In the case of the Sixth Road Improvement Project, one of the objectives was to \nprivatize  road  construction  and  road  transport  units  that  formerly  were  owned  and  operated \ndirectly  by  the  central  and  local  governments.  This  was  partly  effective, since  the  privatization \nprocess has been progressing slowly. \n \nThe only rural roads assistance (Rural Access Roads Project) that has been completed \n96. \nwas effective in achieving its targeted outcomes (footnote 3). All subprojects, except one, were \neffective since they were successful in improving the access among farm-based communities, \nnational  and  provincial  roads,  and  market  centers.  Transport  costs  and  travel  times  on  all \nsubproject  roads  declined  considerably.  The  main  reason  for  the  less  effective  rating  for  one \ncomponent  was  that  traffic  on  one  road  was  below  the  forecast  levels  owing  to  the  dearth  of \neconomic activities and investments in the project area. This indicates that road improvement is \na necessary, but not sufficient, condition for economic development. \n \n97. \nADB  assistance  has  also  included  periodic  maintenance  of  roads  in  the  Lao  PDR. \nHowever,  postevaluation  studies  have  not  been  able  to  ascertain  the  specific  effectiveness  of \nthese projects, since ADB funding was fungible and was added to the pool of MPWT resources. \nDiscussions  with  the  RMF  secretariat  indicated  that  ADB  assistance  has  been  useful  in \ncontributing to the road maintenance efforts. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n23\n\nissues \n\nThe  PCRs and selected  PPERs  have  rated all  projects  effective.  The  Third,  Fourth, \n98. \nand  Fifth  Road  Improvement  projects  were  developed  in  a  phased  manner  to  rehabilitate  the \n500-km road between Vientiane and Louangphrabang. This road, National Road 13, is one of \nthe most important roads in the Lao PDR and provides connectivity between Vientiane and the \nnorthern  provinces.  Similarly,  other  projects  have  contributed  to  all-weather  connectivity  in \nsouthern  and  western  parts  of  the  country.  The  most  recently  completed  project,  the  GMS: \nNorthern Economic Corridor Project, links the PRC with Thailand via the Lao PDR's Louang \nNamtha Province. This project has been effective in reducing transport costs and providing \nall-weather  access  to  an  important  trade  route.  However,  these  benefits  have  been \naccompanied by migration and social issues (para. 147). \n \n99. \nRegarding  institutional  development  outcomes,  room  for  improvement  remains.  There \nhas  been  progress  in  (i)  project  management  within  MPWT,  (ii)  delegation  of  maintenance \nactivities  to  provincial  levels,  (iii)  countrywide  road  data  collection,  (iv)  prioritization  of \nexpenditures  based  on  road  roughness  for  national  roads,  (v)  improved  development  agency \ncoordination,  and  (vi)  improvement  in  technical  and  financial  management  skills  in  MPWT. \nDespite this progress, institutional performance needs to be improved, due to inherent capacity \nproblems  and  sustainability \n(para.  111).  Moreover,  effectiveness  of  capacity \ndevelopment assistance is rated on the lower side due to the policy of capacity substitution. A \nspecial  evaluation  study  found  that  the  objectives  and  outcomes  of  capacity  development \nassistance were not articulated in ways that allowed any focusing of resources and inputs either \nto attain these goals or to monitor and assess outcomes.43 This was especially true about ADB \nassistance  in  the  1990s,  when  capacity  development  was  equated  with  delivering  consulting \nservices and training. In the last 10 years, ADB assistance has improved, with value addition in \nareas such as formulating policy guidelines and training for maintenance planning. However, the \nabsence of any TA in the last 10 years has paused ADB's efforts. \n \n100.  ADB  provided  TA  for  Strengthening  Social  and  Environmental  Management  Capacity  in \nthe DOR, which was completed in 2005. A postevaluation carried out in 2009 rated the TA less \neffective  (footnote  3).  The  PPER  stated  that  the  social  side  of  the  MPWT  mandate  has  been \ndiluted since the Environment and Social Division has been moved from DOR to the Public Works \nand Transport Institute. The division is now called the Environmental Division, implying the lower \nimportance  of  the  social  aspect.  While  the  TA  included  training  on  social  and  environmental \nassessments, the division's social side remained deficient and less effective owing to the lack of \nhuman resources. This issue is linked to wider sector-level issues: (i) the local university needs to \nhave a structured program so that basic capacity in social and environmental disciplines is built, \nand  (ii)  capacity-building  efforts  have  not  led  to  human  resources  development  and  have  been \nrelegated to training in implementation of specific safeguard procedures. \n \n101.  Local  capacity  development  is  typically  being  done  through  on-the-job  training  for \nenvironment  assessment  and  environmental  management  plan  implementation,  which  is \nimparted  by  project  supervision  consultants.  Other  development  partners,  including  the  World \nBank and Sida, have supported capacity building in areas such as maintenance planning. The \ntraining provided for social and environmental issues has been limited to safeguard documents, \nlimiting the overall institutional development in these areas. \n \n102.  The  new  Environmental  Division  has  eight  staff  members,  out  of  whom  only  two  have \ndegrees in an environment-related field; four are engineers by training; and two are non-engineers \n\n                                                 \n43 ADB.  2004.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\n(though not social scientists). Although the division expects to improve its resources in the short \nterm, the current situation prevents it from adding value to the implementation of projects in the \ncountry  and  results  in  a  continued  reliance  on  external  consultants.  Overall,  the  institutional \ndevelopment efforts have been less effective in environmental and social areas. This is reflected \nin  the  current  draft  of  the  transport  sector  strategy  being  prepared  by  MPWT,  which  states  that \nthere  is  a  need  for  institutional  strengthening,  including  human  resources  development, \nmechanisms for effective management, and means of attracting resources from all sources for the \ndevelopment of the sector with a mechanism for checks and balances (footnote 6). \n \nE. \n\nSustainability \n\n103.  ADB assistance to the Lao PDR transport sector is  likely to be sustainable based on an \nassessment  of  government  financing  of  the  recurrent  costs,  cost  recovery  of  the  projects, \ninstitutional arrangements, and past experience of road maintenance in the country that indicates \nthe level of risk. The road subsector has gone through a change in terms of creating awareness \nfor  better  road  maintenance.  Currently,  the  commitment  and  willingness  of  MPWT  to  engage  in \nfinding  solutions  to  this  problem  are  high.  However,  MPWT  continues  to  be  constrained  by  the \nlack of funding allocations, as well as capacity at the provincial and district levels. \n \n104.  The draft transport sector strategy (footnote 6) states that the total need for road funding \nover 2008\u20132015 is KN27,103 billion ($3.2 billion), of which KN10,548 billion ($1.2 billion) is for \nroad  maintenance,  and KN16,555  billion  ($2  billion)  is  for  road  upgrading  and  expansion.  The \nstrategy  admits  that  these  figures  are  far  beyond  the  funds  available,  increasing  the  overall \nsustainability risk. \n \n105.  As  stated  previously,  most  ADB  assistance  has  been  channeled  toward  rehabilitating \nnational roads and highways. The maintenance of national roads is funded from the RMF, which \nallocates  90%  of  its  revenues  to  national  roads.  The  remaining  revenues  are  allocated  for \nmaintenance of provincial, district, and rural roads. The midterm review of the CSP 2007\u20132011 \n(footnote 24) stated that the RMF provides just 45% of the requirements for maintaining national \nroads,  but  discussions  with  the  RMF  secretariat  in  2009  indicated  that  all  the  current \nrequirements of national road maintenance are fulfilled by the RMF. The RMF depends heavily \non development agency funding, which currently forms 37% of the overall funding. Sources of \nRMF revenues comprise fuel levy, bridge tolls, heavy vehicle surcharges, overweight fines, and \ninternational  transit  fees.  The  fuel  levy  forms  the  bulk  of  these  revenues.  MPWT  intends  to \ngradually increase the fuel levy from the current KN300 per liter, as it is estimated that the RMF \nwill be self-sufficient only if the fuel levy is increased by at least KN50 per liter every year. As \nsuch, the government has increased the fuel levy at the rate of KN50 per liter consistently over \nthe last 5 years. MPWT has provided assurances for a continued rise of this levy in the future \nuntil  the  RMF  becomes  self-sufficient.  These  assurances  are  backed  by  an  expansion  in  the \nsources of RMF revenues to include contributions from hydropower and mining projects. \n \n106.  MPWT's draft transport sector strategy states that the government's first priority will be to \npreserve the existing operational roads by providing sufficient funds to maintain satisfactory road \nconditions, particularly for national roads (footnote 6). Thus, it can be inferred that the government \nintends to allocate sufficient funds for maintenance before further expanding the network. \n \n107.  Appendix  9  provides  a  review  of  the  literature  surrounding  the  RMF.  A  World  Bank \nIndependent Evaluation Group study on road funding strategies of various countries assessed \nthe  RMF  especially  successful  in  that  fund  collections  were  efficiently  allocated  to  road \n\n \n\n\f \n\n25\n\nmaintenance.44 The RMF has steadily improved its efficiency and effectiveness since 2001, but \ncannot  yet  be  declared  a  complete  success.  The  RMF  follows  the  general  principles  of  the \nsecond-generation  type  of  road  funds  established  under  the  broader  context  of  road \nmanagement reforms and limited resources. Its creation provides the mechanism by which user \ncharges are pooled to a dedicated fund with priority given to road maintenance. A decree, which \nestablished  the  RMF  advisory  board,  included  members  representing  both  the  public  and \nprivate sectors. All of these aspects point to a good fund structure. However, for this structure to \nsucceed,  it  needs  to  receive  adequate  revenue.  Moreover,  institutional  issues  within  the  RMF \nneed  to  be  addressed  in  terms  of  further  improvements  in  human  resources,  financial \nmanagement, and maintenance procedures. \n \n108.  Taking  into  account  the  above  analysis,  the  RMF  appears  to  be  improving  and  could \nensure  the  sustainability  of  the  national  roads.  Moreover,  the  demand  for  national  roads  will \nalways be higher as compared with other roads. This will enable the national roads to obtain a \nlarger share of government allocations for maintenance, which could, however, take place at the \ncost of the provincial and rural roads. \n \n109.  The  likelihood  of  sustainability  of  rural  roads  is  lower  as  compared  to  that  of  national \nroads.  Rural  road  maintenance  depends  on  allocations  from  provincial  governments  and \nvoluntary  work  carried  out  by  village  maintenance  committees.  These  committees  comprise \ngroups  of  local  residents  who  have  been  nominated  to  carry  out  routine  maintenance  of  rural \nroads.  However,  in  most  cases,  they  do  not  get  any  funding  from  the  provincial  or  district \ngovernments. As a result, this work is carried out on a voluntary basis. This results in a lack of \nconsistent routine maintenance, affecting road condition. \n \n110.  Thus,  as  stated  previously,  the  actual  funds  allocation  for  provincial,  district,  and  rural \nroads continues to be short of the requirements. This has increased the risk of deterioration of \nrecently rehabilitated roads. With the low traffic, maintenance of those roads also remains low in \nthe order of funding priority. This increases the risk of sustainability of continued funding. \n \n111. \nIn  addition,  the  institutional  capacity  of  MPWT  and  the  DPWTs  continues  to  be \nconstrained  by  the  lack  of  adequate  resources.  The  dependence  on  consultants  for  project \npreparation  and  implementation  continues.  Although  MPWT  has  awarded  maintenance \ncontracts  for  national  roads,  no  such  contracts  are  being  discussed  for  rural  roads.  With  the \nrecent policy of decentralization, the DPWTs are expected to become centers for planning and \nbudgeting  activities  for  the  districts'  socioeconomic  plans,  requiring  a  definitive  building  of \ntechnical  and  administrative  capacities  at  the  district  and  provincial  levels.  Planning  and \nimplementing  maintenance  programs  at  the  district  level  will  require  additional  manpower  and \nfunding resources, both of which are currently falling short. \n \n112.  Finally,  the  government's  commitment  and  willingness  to  maintain  transport  assets  are \nstrong.  One  of  the  goals  of  the  NSEDP  6  is  to  \"ensure  the  maintenance  of  existing \ninfrastructure;  establish  additional  infrastructure  specifically  to  support  the  socioeconomic \ndevelopment  activities  aiming  to  promote  trade,  investment,  and  tourism\"  (footnote  17).  This \nrequires  substantial  investments  backed  up  by  sustained  maintenance,  which  is  currently  a \nmatter of concern for rural roads. \n \n\n                                                 \n44 H.

ADB's  contributions  to  development  impacts  specific  to  the  transport  sector  are \nsubstantial.  This  assessment  measures  the  extent  to  which  ADB's  cumulative  interventions \ncontributed  to  the  Lao  PDR's  long-term  development  results.  Although  it  is  difficult  to \ndisaggregate  the  specific  impact  of  ADB  assistance  in  the  development  context,  the  impact \nassessment analyzes the sector-wide positive and negative impacts linked to road improvement \nin the Lao PDR. These impacts are assessed across ADB's transport portfolio in the following \nkey thematic areas: poverty reduction, trade and tourism, health, vehicle overloading and safety, \nagricultural  development,  environmental  impact,  and  impact  on  indigenous  peoples.  Appendix \n10 provides a summary of the impact of each completed project. \n \n115.  Poverty  reduction.  Poverty  in  the  Lao  PDR  is  defined  by  a  poverty  line  based  on  the \nlevel  of  per  capita  household  consumption  considered  necessary  to  meet  minimum  dietary \nneeds,  such  as  the  level  of  per  capita  food  consumption  needed  to  purchase  a  typical  food \nbasket.  ADB  assistance  for  the  funding  of  national  road  improvement  did  not  have  a  direct \nrationale  of  poverty  reduction,  since  these  projects  were  justified  more  along  the  lines  of \nconnectivity  and  support  to  agricultural  development.  Poverty  reduction  had  been  an  indirect \nimpact targeted by these projects, until ADB ventured into the rural road subsector. The Rural \nAccess Roads Project was the first project that aimed to reduce poverty by providing access to \nmarket, education, and health facilities.  \n \n116.  The link between road improvement and poverty reduction falls into two basic schools of \nthought.  The  first  states  that  significant  poverty  reduction  has  been  achieved  in  the  Lao  PDR, \nand a proportion of this can be statistically attributed to improvement in rural transport access. \nThe  second  argues  that  road  improvement  has  led  to  economic  growth  but  not  necessarily  to \npoverty reduction. \n \n117.  Several  studies  have  indicated  that  road  improvement  has  contributed  to  poverty \nreduction.45  Most  studies  have  analyzed  the  link  between  improved  access  and  poverty \nreduction. Access is typically measured in terms of travel time, effort involved, and cost of travel. \nA  key  point  is  that  people  with  capital  were  most  able  to  benefit  from  the  new  opportunities \ncreated by rural infrastructure.46 \n \n118. \nIn  2005,  Warr  concluded  that  between  1997\u20131998  and  2002\u20132003,  rural  poverty \nincidence in the Lao PDR declined by 9.5%, despite some macroeconomic conditions mitigating \nthe interests of rural people.47 It estimated that about 13.0% of this decline can be attributed to \nimproved  road  access  alone.  Another  factor  included  public  investment  in  irrigation  facilities. \nWarr found  that by providing rural areas with dry season road access, rural poverty incidence \ncould be reduced by 3.0%. A further reduction of 2.0% could be obtained by providing all rural \nhouseholds with all-weather road access. \n\n                                                 \n45 ADB, National Statistical Centre of the Committee for Planning and Investment, Sida, and the World Bank. 2006. \nLao PDR Poverty Assessment Report: From Valleys to Hilltops\u201415 Years of Poverty Reduction.

An \nlinked  rural  road \nimprovement with poverty reduction in Attapeu, Houaphan, Louangphrabang, Savannakhet, and \nXiangkhouang  provinces,  all  of  which  have  benefited  from  ADB  assistance.48  The  study \nconcluded that there is a close link between villages connected by roads and poverty reduction \nthrough increased income opportunities to rural people. However, it stated that the provision of \nroads  alone  is  not  sufficient  to  ensure  these  impacts.  Other  requirements  include  providing \nagriculture extension works, ensuring agricultural market information, and creating awareness of \nthe benefits that they could gain from improved roads. \n \n120.  The Lao PDR has witnessed considerable improvement of its national roads as well. The \ndevelopment  of  National  Road  13  between  Vientiane  and  Louangphrabang  contributed  to  the \npoverty  reduction  efforts  in  northern  Lao  PDR.  With  the  provision  of  connectivity  between \nVientiane  and  the  northern  provinces,  there  has  been  a  major  contribution  to  economic \ndevelopment  in  these  areas.  Similar  results  were  found  by  a  survey  carried  out  as  part  of  the \nPPER for the Champasack Road Improvement Project in southern Lao PDR, which indicated an \nimprovement in income levels and job opportunities.49 \n \n121.  Breaking  away  from  the  above  studies,  another  school  of  thought  differentiates \neconomic  development  from  poverty  reduction,  arguing  that  road  improvement  might  not \nnecessarily lead to poverty reduction. Evidence from the Rural Access Roads Project provides \nthe case for this argument. First, poverty needs to be defined correctly and consistently. Relying \nstrictly  on  statistical  definitions  could  introduce  a  bias  from  the  originating  institution.  On  the \nother  hand,  qualitative  studies  could  be  influenced  by  prevailing  themes,  which  could  change \nover  time.  Thus,  a  balance  of  quantitative  and  qualitative  techniques  is  required  that  adopt  a \nconsistent  methodology  over  several  years.  Moreover,  poverty  needs  to  be  defined  at \nhousehold, village, or community levels and needs to be consistent with the national definition. \n \nIn  the  case  of  the  Rural  Access  Roads  Project,  villages  in  the  project  area,  mostly \n122. \npopulated by various ethnic minority groups, witnessed poverty reduction, albeit on a differential \nbasis. A socioeconomic assessment carried out by IED found that some of these groups (e.g., \nHmong groups) were able to take advantage of the road improvement. However, the Khmu and \nBahnar groups had been the recipients of limited incremental economic benefits. \n \n123.  Two  conclusions  emerged  from  the  impact  assessment:  (i)  more  time  is  needed  for \nproject  benefits  to  be  captured  by  residents  in  rural  areas;  and  (ii)  other  interventions  are \nessential for economic benefits to be captured by the people, such as improvement in policies \nfor  land  allocation,  village  consolidation,  opium  cultivation  eradication,  and  eradication  of \nswidden  cultivation;  agriculture  development  in  terms  of  improvement  of  quantity,  quality,  and \ndiversity  of  crops;  encouragement  of  crop  substitution;  and  provision  of  health  and  education \nservices. \n \n124. \nImpact  on  trade  and  tourism.  ADB  assistance  included  two  regional  cooperation \nprojects  involving  cross-border  roads.  The  East\u2013West  Economic  Corridor  Project,  connecting \nthe  Thai  border  with  the  Vietnamese  border  across  southern  Lao  PDR,  was  substantially \ncompleted in 2005. A PPER was carried out in 2008 (footnote 36) to measure the impact of the \n\n                                                 \n48 S. Oraboune. 2008.

The  GMS:  Northern  Economic  Corridor  Project  was  completed  in  2009,  but  the  PCR \nhas yet to be prepared. \n \n125.  On the East\u2013West Economic Corridor Project, the impact of the improved Road No. 9 on \ntrade has been modest to substantial, partly because of restrictions on vehicle movements. The \naverage  trade  value  through  the  Lao  Bao  crossing  improved  from  $93  million  per  year  during \n1998\u22122000  (before  the  project)  to  $100  million  per  year  during  2004\u22122007  (after  the  project). \nDuring  the  last  decade,  the  trade  value  peaked  at  $148  million  in  2007  compared  with  the \nprevious high of $129 million in 1999. \n \n126.  The  PPER  for  the  East\u2013West  Economic  Corridor  Project  (footnote  36)  describes  the \nrelative significance of trade passing through Dansavanh (on the Lao PDR\u2013Viet Nam border) to \nthe  total  trade  nationwide.  Following  the  drop  in  trade  value  due  to  construction,  the  share  of \ntrade  through  Dansavan  to  the  Lao  PDR\u2019s  total  trade  has  gradually  increased  from  about  2% \nfrom 2002 to around 5% in 2007. It decreased briefly in 2008 due to the global economic crisis \nbefore recovering again in 2009. Being landlocked, the Lao PDR has been the most dependent \nof  the  GMS  countries  on  intra-GMS  trade  and  has  benefited  from  the  development  of  the \nregional roads. Regional cooperation in the Lao PDR\u2019s transport sector has led to externalities \nthat benefit neighboring countries in the form of alternative trade routes. It is important for the \nLao  PDR  to  receive  a  share  of  these  benefits,  which  could  be  in  the  form  of  transit  charges. \nSuch charges are being negotiated and could contribute to the national economy in the future. \n \n127.  The East\u2013West Economic Corridor Project resulted in enhanced connectivity, helping form \nareas  of  production.  A  number  of  factories  in  the  Lao  PDR  are  using  Road  No.  9  to  transport \ngoods  to  Viet  Nam,  resulting  in  improved  livelihoods  (e.g.,  diversification  of  production  to  other \ncrops) and living standards (with increased production more than consumption) of local residents. \nEast\u2212West  transport  facilitation  (Lao  PDR\u2212Thailand\u2212Viet  Nam)  further  opened  up  markets  and \nenabled consumer choices through cheaper prices, and product availability and diversity. Goods \npassing through Road  No. 9 are  mainly  from bilateral trade (Lao PDR\u2013Thailand and  Lao PDR\u2013\nViet Nam), as the Lao PDR and Viet Nam have a bilateral agreement to allow residents of border \nvillages  to  cross  the  borders  freely  to  trade.  This  has  enabled  Dansavan  villagers  to  go  night \nshopping at the Lao Bao market or opt to use a Viet Nam hospital for more serious illnesses. \n \n128.  Tourism accounts for a major part of the increased traffic between Thailand and the Lao \nPDR, which has more than doubled since the completion of the East\u2013West Economic Corridor \nProject. For the Lao PDR, the question for the future is how to encourage more of these tourists \nto stay longer and spend more in the country.50 This indicates that the project has contributed to \nsubstantial  changes \nIn  summary,  regional  cooperation  projects  contribute \ntourism. \nsubstantially to the macroeconomy. \n \nImpact on health. The construction of roads as well as their subsequent use has been \n129. \nlinked  to  increase  in  the  population's  vulnerability  to  sexually  transmitted  infections,  such  as \nHIV/AIDS.51 One study has found a link among economic development in rural areas, mobility, \n\nin \n\n                                                 \n50 As  part  of  Japan\u2019s  efforts  to  develop  and/or  promote  the  corridor,  JICA  provided  a  $1.5  million  grant  for  a  tourism \nproject  in  Kaysone  Phomvihane.  It  aims  to  address  poverty  through  development  of  a  one  village\u2212one  product \nprogram (for regional development), along with a one-stop service center near the second Mekong Friendship Bridge. \n51 S.

ADB  has  carried  out  case  study  reviews  of  four  transport  projects  in  the  GMS \nlessons  and \n(including \nrecommendations for tackling the issue.53 These recommendations need to be implemented by \nthe government in close coordination with other development partners. \n \n130.  The  initial  information  from  the  GMS:  Northern  Economic  Corridor  Project  indicated  a \nmuch  worse  scenario  in  terms  of  sexually  transmitted  infections.  The  construction  work  for \nRoute  No.  3  required  a  large  number  of  skilled  and  unskilled  laborers  from  the  PRC,  the  Lao \nPDR,  and  Thailand\u2014mostly  men  with  disposable  incomes  who  work  away  from  their  families \nand  traditional  social  norms  for  several  years.  This  increased  the  vulnerability  to  sexually \ntransmitted infections and drug addiction in the construction camps. Even before the project was \ncomplete, the number of people using the road had grown substantially to cross border between \nthe  PRC  and  the  Lao  PDR,  resulting  in  a  distinct  increase  in  the  risk  of  sexually  transmitted \ninfections on both sides of the border. \n \n131.  The  issue  of  whether  HIV/AIDS  mitigation  measures  should  be  included  in  project \ndesigns  of  road  improvement  projects  has  yet  to  be  resolved.  Although  the  project  loan \nagreements  for  East\u2013West  Economic  Corridor  Project  and  the  GMS:  Northern  Economic \nCorridor  Project  included  covenants  requiring  contractors  to  carry  out  HIV/AIDS  prevention \nactivities, no funding was earmarked specifically for such activities. In addition, the supervision \nconsultants and implementing agencies had limited technical capacity to design and implement \nthese  prevention  activities  adequately.  The  ongoing  Roads  for  Rural  Development  Project \nincludes  a  component  on  awareness  and  prevention  of  HIV/AIDS,  sexually  transmitted \ninfections,  and  drug  use  that  has  been  designed  and  implemented  through  the  National \nCommittee  for  Control  of  AIDS  and  the  provincial  committees  for  AIDS  control.  The \neffectiveness of this component will be assessed upon project completion. \n \n132.  To  specifically  address  HIV  mitigation,  ADB  funded  the  HIV/AIDS  and  sexually \ntransmitted  infections,  Drug  and  People  Trafficking  Awareness  and  Prevention  Education \nProgram,  which  was  designed  as  a  standalone  project  to  address  the  potential  spread  of \nHIV/AIDS  and  sexually  transmitted  infections,  as  well  as  drug  and  human  trafficking,  through \ncomprehensive prevention activities supporting risk-reduction behavior. The program comprised \nawareness  raising  among  villagers,  construction  workers,  and  service  workers  as  well  as \ncapacity building, while more activities specifically focused on prevention targeted construction \nworkers, local communities, and mobile service workers (footnote 53). This program is ongoing. \n \n133.  Vehicle  overloading  and  road  safety.  Improvement  of  roads  has  also  led  to \ndeterioration of road safety due to increased vehicle overloading and traffic accidents. Vehicle \noverloading results in a decrease in the design life of the road pavement and increases the risk \nof accidents. PPERs have noted a continual incidence of axle loads in excess of the maximum \nlegal axle load limit.54 It is recognized that (i) MPWT faces constraints in terms of the number of \nweigh bridges; and (ii) on the roads where weigh bridges do exist, there is no strict enforcement. \n\n                                                 \n52 Handicap  International.  2006.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\n \n\nThese issues need to be addressed comprehensively to ensure that the economic value of the \nroad pavement is sustained. The Roads for Rural Development Project includes a component \nfor axle load control equipment. However, MPWT has not used this funding. \n \n134.  Road  improvements  typically  result  in  higher  speeds  for  vehicles,  to  which  have  been \nattributed  increased  traffic  accidents  and  fatalities.  With  increasing  populations  living  along \nroads,  this  issue  has  been  exacerbated.  The  main  causes  of  these  accidents  are  (i)  lack  of \nenforcement of posted speed limits and lack of appreciation by drivers of the rationale for speed \nlimits;  (ii)  increasing  pedestrian  traffic,  both  crossing  and  along  the  roadway;  (iii)  lack  of \nadequate shoulder width for vehicular stops and parking; and (iv) continued breakdown of the \nedges of shoulders. \n \n135.  Road accident statistics from MPWT show that motorcycles account for highest accident \nrates followed by cars, pickups, and others.55 From 2000 to 2008, the average number of fatalities \nper  10,000  vehicles  was  9\u201315  persons  per  year.  Most  of  the  victims  were  19\u201331  years  of  age, \nwith the highest rate between 25 and 30 years old. The intensity of accidents has increased in the \nrecent years, with the fatalities per accident increasing from 0.08 in 2002 to 0.10 in 2007, and the \ninjuries per accident increasing from 1.36 in 2002 to 1.45 in 2007. \n \n136.  The observed trend in road traffic safety in the Lao PDR generally mirrors the experiences \nof  its  neighboring  countries  as  a  result  of  improved  road  surfaces.  Poor  road  safety  and  high \nnumbers of accidents, injuries, and fatalities are also serious, growing problems in Cambodia and \nViet  Nam.  For  the  two  neighbors,  traffic  accidents  are  usually  caused  by  speeding,  misuse  of \ndrugs and breach of traffic regulations, poor traffic management, and/or the mix of high- and low-\nspeed  vehicles  on  the  same  road.  Among  the  three  neighbors,  Cambodia  reported  the  highest \nfatality  rate  in  2009.56  The  fatality  per  100,000  inhabitants  for  the  Lao  PDR  of  12.4  was  only \nslightly  better  than  for  Cambodia  and  Viet  Nam.  In  terms  of  fatality  rate  per  10,000  vehicles  in \n2009, the ratio of 8.6 for the Lao PDR was higher than Viet Nam but lower than Cambodia. These \nfigures have been worsening over the last few years. \n \n137.  Value  addition  by  ADB  in  terms  of  road  safety  needs  to  go  beyond  the  provision  of \ntraditional hardware like traffic signs and signals, street lights, road markings, center lines and \nbarriers,  and  speed  reduction  strips.  In  addition  to  road  shoulder  widening,  more  needs  to  be \ndone  in  the  areas  of  driver  education,  vehicle  inspection,  licensing,  and  traffic  regulation \nenforcement.  On  the  latter,  inefficient  law  enforcement  has  been  a  root  cause  of  the  traffic \nsafety problem for Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam. Project experiences indicate that the \neffectiveness of ADB assistance can be enhanced if it is able to build on a vigorous regime of \nlaw enforcement by local authorities. \n \n138.  Agricultural  development.  Road  improvement  has  contributed  to  an  increase  in  crop \ndiversification  as  well  as  a  general  rise  in  agricultural  production.  In  the  area  around  the \nChampasack Road Improvement Project, before the project, farmers used to grow one rice crop \nper year and could manage their livelihoods with it. After road improvement, with better access \nto  markets,  farmers  have  been  attempting  to  produce  two  rice  crops  per  year.  This  has  been \nhampered, however, by the lack of irrigation and by the high cost of installing irrigation systems. \nIn  other  cases,  farmers  have  diversified  into  growing  cash  crops,  such  as  tobacco,  with  high \nprofit  margins.  An  unexpected  benefit  of  the  project  has  been  that  the  traders  have  now \n\n                                                 \n55 Office of Roads and Bridges, Department of Public Works and Transport.

Phnom Penh (September). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n31\n\norganized a transport service wherein their trucks pick up agricultural produce directly from the \nfarms.  A  similar  situation  exists  on  the  Community-Managed  Irrigation  Sector  Project.57  After \nproject completion, rice was no longer grown on steep slopes, and there is a growing trend to \ngrow cash crops where new roads have improved access to markets. While these cash crops \ndo  provide  income  for  farmers,  the  potential  for  ecological  damage  remains  high.58  Moreover, \nthe  importance  of  rural  transport  is  underlined  by  the  fact  that  improvement  in  this  subsector \nfacilitates  temporary  labor  migration  from  rural  areas,  allowing  farm  families  to  remain  partly \nengaged in agriculture activities simultaneously with wage and nonfarm employment. \n \n139.  The 2008 World Development Report stated that inadequate transport infrastructure and \nservices in rural areas tend to push up marketing costs, undermining local markets and exports.59 \nHowever,  it  also  stated  that  benefits  of  road  improvement  depend  heavily  on  interactions  with \nother infrastructure and geographical, community, and household characteristics. It could take 4\u20136 \nyears after road rehabilitation for the road transport services to respond in areas where markets \nwere already established and natural disasters were relatively infrequent. This indicates that road \nrehabilitation planning must consider whether the absence of connectivity is critical enough before \nembarking  on  road  rehabilitation.  This  needs  to  be  accompanied  by  assessment  of  what  other \npolicy initiatives and investments are necessary to make it successful. \n \n140.  Environmental  impact.  Unless  road  improvement  projects  implement  a  sound \nenvironmental impact mitigation plan, they could create negative impacts on biodiversity in the \nform  of  habitat  loss  and  fragmentation,  and  invasion  of  nonindigenous  species.60  Even  with \ngood implementation, there are several unavoidable impacts due to the increase in accessibility \nto  forested  areas.  In  the  Lao  PDR,  the  threat  to  biodiversity  is  likely  to  increase  as  the \npopulation  grows  and  also  due  to  the  access  to  forested  areas  provided  by  the  roads.  In \naddition,  transport  infrastructure  development  has  indirect  impacts  such  as  water  pollution,  air \npollution during construction and operation, and waste disposal during construction. \n \n141.  The preparation of projects at ex-ante stage can be improved by paying attention to the \nlimited  resources  devoted  by  MPWT  and  the  complex  nature  of  the  ecology.  For  the  Rural \nAccess Roads Project, the environmental management plan was found to be lacking in detail, \nsince  it  only  provided  a  general  framework  for  environmental  protection  without  specifying \nmeasures  (footnote  3).  This  resulted  in  less-than-adequate  implementation  of  environmental \nmitigating measures during construction. Unless an environment management plan is detailed, \ncivil works contractors cannot implement it properly. A detailed plan needs to be backed up by \nbidding documents containing project-specific contract clauses for environmental protection and \nmanagement.  With  the  mainstreaming  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguards  Policy  Statement  of  2009,  future \nenvironmental management plans will require closer coordination with the agencies at national \nand  local  levels,  including  management  boards  of  national  biodiversity  conservation  areas, \nMinistry of Agriculture and Forestry, and nongovernment organizations. \n \n\n                                                 \n57 ADB.  1996.

World Development Report. Washington, DC. \n60 These  are  species  that  ecologically  alter  the  habitats  that  they  invade,  such  as  the  unintentional  introduction  of \nforest pest species that will ultimately change forest ecology. This problem becomes more serious for roads cutting \nthrough protected areas. The problem may not be noticeable during its initial stages, but could become prominent \nin the long term. \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\n \n\n142.  The Champasack Road Improvement Project, as well as other projects, has witnessed \nencroachment by villagers on forest areas. While community participation programs are helpful \nin reducing the impact of this problem, they cannot solve it completely. The Rural Access Roads \nProject is equally challenging, since it included a road linking Xam Tai to Xam Nua and bisecting \nthe  Nam  Xan  National  Biodiversity  Conservation  Area  in  Houaphan  Province.  While  from  a \nconservation perspective, this road should not have passed through the conservation area, the \nidea is in conflict with the socioeconomic needs of Xam Tai since this is the only link to the main \nhighway. This district has been in existence long before the conservation area was declared a \nprotected area. \n \n143.  Upgrading  roads  in  rural  areas  has  been  known  to  facilitate  illegal  logging  in  the  Lao \nPDR.61  The  government  has  established  specific  regulations  to  control  logging,  such  as  the \nnumber of logs that can be cut annually in each province. These logs are then auctioned by the \ngovernment  to  obtain  the  best  prices,  and  some  are  also  exported  to  Viet  Nam.  Discussions \nwith  forest  officials  and  a  timber  mill  owner  indicated  that  government  regulations  were  being \nfollowed  and  that  logs  are  cut  from  the  production  forests  only.  However,  discussions  with \nnongovernment  organizations  indicated  that  there  have  been  instances  of  illegal  logging, \nespecially  in  southern  Lao  PDR.  This  indicates  that  although  there  is  an  appropriate  policy  in \nplace for controlling logging, it is not being enforced strictly. \n \n144.  With road improvement, the traditional swidden or slash-and-burn agriculture or shifting \nagriculture has become an environmental issue. It has been a successful and dominant farming \nsystem  in  the  northern  Lao  PDR  for  several  generations.  In  recent  years,  the  average  fallow \nperiods have decreased from an average of 4\u20135 years to 2\u20133 years as a result of a combination \nof  population  pressure,  government  restrictions  on  forest  clearing,  competing  land-use \nobjectives,  and  migration  of  people  to  areas  adjacent  to  roads.  With  the  improved  access  to \nremote areas, this issue is likely to worsen. In 2006, an environmental performance assessment \nreport  systematically  documented  a  nationwide  assessment  of  ADB's  environmental  concerns \nand  how  the  Lao  PDR  is  addressing  them.62  The  report  applied  a  pressure-state-response \nmodel. It identified the government\u2019s efforts and investments in road and irrigation infrastructure \nto induce farmers to change from shifting cultivation to more sustainable production systems. \n \n145.  The Lao PDR has also seen a growth in industrial tree plantations. The NSEDP 6 cited \nthe  conversion  of  some  72,870  hectares  of  swidden  fields  into  industrial  tree  plantations  in \n2005.63 This represented 61% of the areas used in 2001 for slash-and-burn cultivation. In effect, \nswidden areas have become the prime catalyst for land-use change by first clearing the forest \nfor  subsistence  farming,  then  ultimately  converting  the  land  into  industrial  tree  plantations. \nThese  land  conversions  are  facilitated  by  the  presence  of  roads,  since  the  harvesting  of \nindustrial trees requires good access. \n \nImpact  on  ethnic  people.64  The  GMS:  Northern  Economic  Corridor  Project  affected \n146. \n76 villages  flanking  Road  No.  3,  comprising  about  37,000  people.  More  than  90%  of  these \nresidents  belong  to  ethnic  groups  distinct  from  the  lowland  Lao  PDR  peoples.  Similarly,  the \nRural Access Road Project was involved in areas with ethnic minority communities. Most often, \n\n                                                 \n61 ADB. 2004.

Bangkok. \n\n63 The  Fourth  and  Fifth  Road  Improvement  projects  led  to  the  establishment  of  teak  tree  and  bamboo  plantations \n\n64 The term ethnic people are used here to describe the indigenous peoples as defined in ADB\u2019s Safeguards Policy \n\n(footnote 37). \n\nStatement. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n33\n\nthe social assessment carried out at appraisal has two methodological issues: (i) inappropriate \nclassification of the ethnic minority groups, and (ii) incomplete surveys and oversimplification of \nlivelihood descriptions. The PPER for the Rural Access Roads Project provided details of these \nissues (footnote 3), indicating that the quality of the assessment leading up to the project could \nhave been better. The indirect consequence is that all the ethnic communities were grouped into \na single category that did not differentiate relative economic status and the ability to capture the \nbenefits of road improvement. \n \n147.  All  ADB  projects  carry  out  a  social  analysis  or  an  initial  poverty  and  social  impact \nassessment  during  the  preparatory  phase.  In  principle,  these  analytical  studies  include \nassessing the needs of impacted villagers defined as affected peoples for compensation for loss \nof  land  or  houses  and could  trigger  ADB  social  safeguard policies  on  involuntary  resettlement \nand  indigenous  peoples.  In  the  Lao  PDR  transport  sector,  involuntary  resettlement  has  not \ninvolved  large-scale  relocation  of  villages  such  as  might  be  required  in  hydropower  projects. \nTypically,  road  projects have  involved  compensation  for  the  appropriation  of  small  amounts  of \nland  to  meet  right-of-way  standards.  However,  the  socioeconomic  analysis  carried  out  by  this \nSAPE shows various unanticipated impacts that could have eluded with earlier social analyses. \nGiven below are generic observations from various parts of the Lao PDR. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nA  road  improvement  project  could  cause  strategic  problems  for  ethnic  minority \ngroups  when  a  road  passes  through  their  ancestral  territory,  inducing  them  to \nrelocate to the roadside to prevent migrants from doing so, a self-protective move \nnot  motivated  by  economics.  However,  these  aspects  have  not  been  studied \nduring social analysis and, hence, tend to be overlooked in the initial poverty and \nsocial impact assessment. \nRoad improvement could lead to a change in the social and economic balance in \nlocal communities. It could exacerbate a dormant inferiority complex on the part \nof  Mon\u2013Khmer  people  when  they  are  consolidated  into  villages  of  Lao\u2013Tai  or \nHmong\u2013Mien groups, or when relocated to roadsides where they must compete \nfor  resources  with  these  groups.65  Relative  strengths  and  weaknesses  of \nindividual ethnic groups in the face of development may not be revealed in social \nanalysis,  and  interethnic  relationships  are  usually  not  described.  In  addition, \nwhere villages are ethnically mixed, socioeconomic studies frequently aggregate \ndata  by  village  and  miss  ethnic  distinctions  or  characterize  these  villages  as \n\u201cintegrated.\u201d  This  point  brings  out  the  differential  impacts  among  the  ethnic \ngroups that need to be recognized. A socioeconomic assessment carried out by \nIED for the  Rural Access Roads Project found that some of these groups (e.g., \nHmong\u2013Mien  groups)  were  able  to  take  advantage  of  the  road  improvement \n(footnote 3). However, other groups such as the Khmu and  Bahnar groups had \nlimited  incremental  economic  benefits.  In  particular,  the  Mon\u2013Khmer  segment \nremained poor before and after road improvement. \nAn  initial  poverty  and  social  impact  assessment  sometimes  does  not  consider \nindirect  impacts,  thereby  compromising  the  quality  of  the  appraisal  process. \nAlthough a road improvement project might not require the relocation of villages, \nthere  could  be  a  parallel  intervention  linked  to  regional  planning  or  policy-\nmotivated  social  engineering.  To  enable  villages  to  capture  the  economic \nbenefits of the road improvement, they are usually relocated to areas adjacent to \nroads.  Most  districts  have  relocation  plans;  thus,  information  on  which  villages \n\n                                                 \n65 UNDP and Government of the Lao PDR, Ministry of Planning and Investment. 2009.

However, this is not used \nby the initial poverty and social impact assessments.  \n\n \n148.  The above points have been identified to contribute to the improvement of future project \nappraisals. The link of the first two points ([i] and [ii]) with ADB safeguard policies is clear and \nundeniable. It is important for ADB to recognize these issues and identify mitigation measures to \naddress  them  during  project  implementation.  The  third  point  has  an  indirect  link  to  road \nimprovement  projects.  However,  this  places  ADB  in  a  position  where  it  could  be  seen  as \ncontributing  to  the  government's  relocation  policies.  This  requires  a  more  detailed  indigenous \npeoples impact assessment, which is currently outside the scope of this SAPE. However, ADB \nneeds to be aware of this risk and plan mitigation measures to address it. \n \nG. \n\nADB Performance \n\n149.  ADB's performance in the Lao PDR transport sector is satisfactory. ADB has been one \nof  the  lead  development  agencies  in  this  sector,  assisting  the  government  in  planning  and \nimplementing projects. Discussions with MPWT indicated general satisfaction with the quality of \nthe responsiveness and value addition by ADB. Capacity building by ADB has been effective in \n(i)  direct  TA  for  training  of  MPWT  staff  and  for  specific  thematic  areas  such  as  road  safety, \nregional  cooperation,  and  safeguard  assessment;  and  (ii)  indirect  capacity  development  for \nMPWT project managers and other staff members who work on ADB projects. \n \n150.  ADB's  main  value  addition  has  been  in  providing  inputs  for  capital  investment  projects \nand capacity development in selected areas. Although this continues to be consistent with the \nneeds of the country, there exist areas of interventions that ADB needs to improve upon (para. \n94).  This  includes  improving  the  sustainability  of  projects,  which  continues  to  be  an  area  of \nconcern for the transport sector in the Lao PDR. In the past, the World Bank has focused on this \naspect,  and  ADB  has  chosen  to  avoid  duplication.66  While  this  is  seen  as  appropriate \nharmonization, ADB needs to continue to work in conjunction with the World Bank in this area. \n \n151.  An  analysis  of  ADB  performance  in  implementing  IED  recommendations  can  also  be \nimproved  (Appendix  11).  The  main  issues  that  have  yet  to  be  comprehensively  acted  upon \ncover  capacity  development,  road  maintenance,  and  private  sector  development.  Although \nthese are sector-wide problems requiring multidonor interventions, ADB needs to take a lead in \nsustaining the efforts in these areas. ADB could further improve its value addition by acting as a \ncatalyst  for  these  sector-wide  issues.  In  the  short  term,  ADB  needs  to  restart  TA  to  the  Lao \nPDR's transport sector targeting the above issues. \n \n152.  ADB has delegated four projects to the resident mission. Out of these, three have been \ncompleted.  Currently,  the  resident  mission  is  administering  the  Roads  for  Rural  Development \nProject and intends to administer another one in the next 6 months. The current capacity of the \nresident mission is sufficient for this scale of operation. ADB's effectiveness and efficiency could \nbe improved in the future if further projects are delegated to the resident mission.67 If and when \nthis  delegation  is  stepped  up,  it  will  need  to  be  accompanied  by  a  corresponding  capacity \nenhancement in the resident mission. In the third quarter of 2010, the Northern GMS Transport \nNetwork Improvement Project will be delegated to the resident mission as well. \n \n                                                 \n66 In the Xieng Khouang Road Project, ADB agreed to cancel the road maintenance capacity building component to \navoid  duplication  of  work  under  a  program  financed  by  the  World  Bank  (ADB.  2006.

ADB  has  been  at  the  forefront  of  participating  in  sector  working  groups  to  coordinate \ntransport investments in the Lao PDR. Other agencies participating in the provision of funding \nand TA are AusAID, government of Thailand, JICA, Sida, and the World Bank. Further bilateral \naid has been provided by other countries including the PRC, Republic of Korea, and Viet Nam, \nalbeit  on  a  smaller  scale.  Figures  4  and  5  provide  a  summary  of  the  relative  size  of  the \nassistance for road rehabilitation in the Lao PDR. \n \n\nFigure 4: Length of Roads Rehabilitated \nby Source of Funding, 1998\u20132010 \n(kilometers) \n\nFigure 5: Cost of Road Rehabilitation by \nFunding Source, 1998\u20132010 \n(%) \n\nThailand, 3%\n\nUNDP, 9%\n\nSida, 8%\n\nThailand, 8%\n\nUNDP, 1%\n\nSida, 5%\n\nKfW, 3%\n\nJICA, 20%\n\nADB, 45%\n\nKfW, 8%\n\nJICA, 4%\n\nWB/IDA, 19%\n\nPRC, 2%\n\nADB, 47%\n\nWB/IDA, 13%\n\nAusAID, 0.1%\n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  AusAID  =  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development,  PRC  =  People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China,  IDA  =  International  Development  Association,  JICA  =  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency, \nSida = Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, UNDP = United Nations Development Programme, \nWB = World Bank. \nSource:  Data  provided  by  the  Government  of  the  Lao  People's  Democratic  Republic,  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and \n\n \n\nPRC, 5%\n\n \n\nTransport. \n\n \n154.  With  various  development  agencies  participating  in  the  development  of  the  Lao  PDR \ntransport  sector,  issues  of  coordination  and  harmonization  remain.  MPWT  has  been  the  main \ncoordinating agency, and carried out this duty effectively until the late 1990s. With the increase \nin  the  number  of  development  agencies  and  the  amount  of  external  assistance,  the  need  for \nagency coordination is now greater. \n \n155.  Since  the  1980s,  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)  organized \nroundtable meetings to serve as a forum for development dialogue between the Government of \nthe  Lao  PDR  and  the  donor  community.  These  were  initially  held  in  Geneva.  But  since  1999, \nthese have been conducted in Vientiane. The government has taken the lead in managing this \nprocess. ADB chairs the infrastructure working group within the roundtable meeting process. An \nevaluation  by  the  United  Nations  Evaluation  Office  in  2007  found  that  the  roundtable  meeting \nwas  effective  in  improving  dialogue  among  the  development  agencies  and  has  led  to  more \neffective  information  sharing  and  complementary  efforts.68  The  evaluation  recommended  that \nUNDP continue its role in coordinating aid through the roundtable meeting process. \n \n156.  The  government  has  set  up  another  infrastructure  sector  working  group  to  coordinate \nand harmonize investment planning among development agencies. Para. 83 indicates needed \nimprovements  in  the  functioning  of  this  working  group.  In  addition,  a  memorandum  of \nunderstanding on collaboration was signed among ADB, Sida, and the World Bank. Discussions \n\n                                                 \n68 UNDP. 2007. Assessment of Development Results, Evaluation of UNDP's Contribution to the Lao PDR. New York. \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\n \n\nwithin ADB, as well as other development partners, indicate that this remains mainly on paper \nand has not been mainstreamed. Finally, the Coordination Framework Agreement was signed in \n2006, which outlined the Lao Transport Development Partnership. This framework needs to be \nreviewed  since  its  immediate  next  steps  had  been  \"to  jointly  develop  detailed  physical, \nprocedural,  sector  and  organizational  efficiency,  and  capacity  indicators  for  some  of  the  core \nareas  of  the  Lao  PDR  transport  sector  to  provide  a  uniform  basis  for  achievement  of \ndevelopment objectives of the sector.\"69 Discussions with development agencies indicated that \nnot much progress has been achieved on this agreement. \n \n157.  Two  areas  require  development  agency  coordination.  The  Lao  PDR  has  the  benefit  of \nvarious  studies  by  different  agencies.  This  knowledge  needs  to  be  shared  and  disseminated \namong development agencies needs, followed by application of this knowledge to new projects. \nFor  example,  slope  stabilization  techniques  and  low-cost  pavement  technologies,  which  have \nbeen  identified  by  recent  studies  funded  by  bilateral  development  agencies,  can  be \nmainstreamed into ADB and World Bank projects. This requires streamlined harmonization not \nonly at the planning stage but also at project implementation stage. The second area requiring \ncoordination is project implementation monitoring. Contractor problems are faced by almost all \nexternally-funded projects in the Lao PDR. Similarly, most implementation issues are common \namong  these  projects.  This  requires  an  annual  multipartite  meeting  between  the  Ministry  of \nFinance,  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment,  MPWT,  and  all  development  agencies  to \nidentify  the  implementation  problems  and  find  solutions  for  all  ongoing  projects.  This  concept \nhas been applied in other countries, such as India, and has been successful. \n \nI. \n\nGovernment Performance \n\nimproved  over \n\nthe  years,  with \n\n158.  The  government's  performance  has \nincreased \nfamiliarization of ADB procedures and awareness of international good practices. In all cases, \nthe executing agency has been MPWT. Although the majority of projects faced implementation \nissues  (paras.  50\u201354)  causing  implementation  delays  and,  in  some  cases,  cost  overruns,  the \nintensity of these issues has been reduced in recent years with the growing maturity of MPWT \nand  appropriate  measures  from  ADB.  For  example,  in  2000,  MPWT  replaced  all  the  project \nimplementation units with a single project management division in DOR, which streamlined the \nproject management functions and enabled better coordination, ownership, and transparency. \n \n159.  The  financing  of  the  road  subsector  continues  to  tarnish  the  performance  of  MPWT. \nLack of funding for road rehabilitation as well as maintenance has constrained economic growth \nin  remote  areas.  Delays  in  counterpart  funding  have  contributed  to  overall  implementation \ndelays. Four out of the 10 completed projects faced counterpart funding delays. This issue has \nbeen  tackled  in  recent  projects  by  lowering  the  government\u2019s  share  of  funding.  It  needs  to  be \naddressed as a fiscal issue, rather than an institutional problem, with MPWT. \n \n160.  The  low  effectiveness  and  sustainability  of  the  capacity  building  assistance  also \ncontinues to be an issue for MPWT. The reliance on consultants to manage projects has been \nreduced  but  not  completely  eliminated.  Issues  such  as  safeguard  implementation  still  receive \nlow priority, resulting in low-quality assessment and implementation (para. 147). As a strategic \nmove,  MPWT  intends  to  adopt  a  catalyst  role  wherein  various  aspects  of  a  project  are \noutsourced.  However,  unless  gaps  in  capacity  development  are  fixed,  it  would  be  difficult  for \nMPWT  to  play  the  catalytic  role  effectively.  Appendix  12  analyzes  MPWT  performance  in \n\n                                                 \n69 Memorandum  of  Understanding  signed  on  3  May  2006  by  MCTPC  (now  called  MPWT),  Embassy  of  Sweden, \n\nInternational Development Association (World Bank), and ADB. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n37\n\nsafeguard implementation. It indicates that although there is commitment from the government \nin  implementing  these  social  and  environmental  safeguards,  lack  of  adequate  institutional \ncapacity has constrained its overall performance. \n \n161.  MPWT's  capacity  constraints  could  be  reduced  by  the  use  of  external  monitors.  Lessons \nfrom the Rural Access Roads Project indicated that external monitors for environmental safeguard \nimplementation were useful in ensuring appropriate implementation of mitigation measures. Other \nprojects, such as the GMS: Northern Economic Corridor Project, have external monitors but could \nhave  benefited  from  stronger  support  from  MPWT.  For  the  ongoing  Northern  GMS  Transport \nNetwork Improvement Project, MPWT has yet to appoint external monitors for resettlement although \nthis was agreed to in 2007, as part of the project design. It is noted that the procurement process for \nthese  monitors  is  currently  under  way.  It  is  apparent  that  given  the  capacity  constraints  faced  by \nMPWT  in  the  areas  of  social  and  environmental  safeguard  implementation,  the  use  of  external \nmonitors could add value in bridging the gap in the short term as well as capacity development in \nthe long  term.  From  January  2010,  ADB  safeguard policy  requires  external  monitors  for  sensitive \nprojects with significant impacts and risks. For this requirement to be triggered, the assessment at \nappraisal needs to be sufficiently rigorous, which is currently lacking (para. 147). \n \n162.  The current ADB safeguard policy requires that \"for projects that are deemed by ADB to \nbe highly complex and sensitive, ADB will require the borrower/client to engage an independent \nadvisory  panel  during  project  preparation  and  implementation.\"70  Taking  into  account  the \npotential  impacts  of  future  projects  (paras.  140\u2013148),  this  requirement  could  be  triggered  by \nprojects located in remote areas. The need for a careful assessment of the potential impacts at \nthe ex-ante stage is crucial in the context of the Lao PDR. \n \n163.  MPWT  has  also  taken  initial  steps  toward  developing  an  environmental  and  social \noperational manual, which aims to establish a countrywide system acceptable to all development \npartners  (footnote  6).  The  manual  includes  (i)  the  development  and  implementation  of  a \nharmonized  approach  to  environmental  and  social  management,  initially  starting  with  the  road \nsubsector;  (ii)  a  consolidation  of  the  environmental  and  social  management  technical  capacity \nwithin MPWT; and (iii) provision of appropriate technical support and resources for implementation \nand compliance monitoring. However, the effectiveness and success of safeguard implementation \nwill be seen in the mainstreaming of this manual and the level of its use. \n \nJ. \n\nOverall Assessment \n\n164.  The overall rating of ADB's program is successful based on the six criteria listed in Table \n3.  This  rating  is  an  outcome  of  several  factors.  First,  ADB's  contribution  to  the  Lao  PDR \ntransport  sector  has  been  tangible  and  consistent  with  the  country's  needs.  Second,  the \nassistance has been effective in enabling positive outcomes at the local, country, and regional \nlevels.  Third,  it  has  contributed  to  agricultural  development.  Other  areas  should  be  improved, \nhowever,  such  as  implementation  performance,  low  utilization  of  project  benefits,  institutional \ndevelopment, sustainability, strategic positioning, and differential impacts among ethnic people. \n \n\n                                                 \n70 ADB. 2009.

ADB  has  been  a  longstanding  development  partner  in  the  Lao  PDR  transport  sector. \nADB assistance, as well as the sector itself, has undergone changes over the years. Although \nthe basic objective of providing connectivity remains, regional cooperation has emerged as an \narea  for  investment.  This  requires  an  appropriate  balance  between  domestic  needs  and \ninternational  aspirations.  Besides  contributing  to  this  balanced  development,  ADB's  value \naddition is closely linked to the institutional development efforts in the country. \n \n166.  Economic  activities  in  the  Lao  PDR  take  a  longer  time  to  stimulate  as  compared  with \nother  countries  such  as  India  and  Thailand.  As  a  result,  an  integrated  approach  that  enables \ncomplementarities  with  other  interventions  such  as  agriculture,  trade,  and  tourism  is  needed. \nSimilarly,  the  need  for  the  maintenance  of  road  projects  has  gained  awareness  within  the \ngovernment.  However,  it  remains  to  be  seen  whether  the  government  can  deploy  adequate \nresources to ensure sustainability. Moreover, this needs to be supported appropriately by ADB, \nwhich has yet to define a clear strategy for addressing sustainability concerns in the Lao PDR. \n \n167.  ADB has adopted an integrated approach to rehabilitate rural roads by combining them \nwith agriculture interventions. This is seen as prudent, and ADB should continue this approach, \ntaking  into  account  the  factors  mentioned  in  para.  74  for  planning  and  implementing  such \nprojects.  While  all  factors  mentioned  are  important,  the  two  that  stand  out  relate  to  better \ncoordination between MPWT and Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and among the transport \nand agriculture divisions within ADB's Southeast Asia Department. \n \n168.  ADB exited from the civil aviation subsector and has stayed away from the inland waterways \nand railways subsectors. This is considered prudent in light of funding limitations. Support to urban \ntransport could be scaled up, given the potential demand for funds in this subsector. However, this \nneeds to be considered within the broader constraint of funds availability. \n \nA. \n\nLessons for Future Assistance \n\n169.  Continued and scaled up assistance for provincial and rural roads. ADB\u2019s transport \nsector  assistance  in  the  Lao  PDR  has  evolved  in  the  recent  years  to  focus  on  GMS  regional \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n39\n\nprojects  that  fund  improvement  of  national  roads  and  highways  connecting  international \nborders.  Higher  development  effectiveness  could  be  achieved  by  improving  access  to  remote \nareas  in  the  Lao  PDR  (para.  118).  This  indicates  the  need  for  increased  attention  to  funding \nprovincial  and  rural  roads  in  the  future  country  program.  The  development  of  GMS  regional \nroads has benefited the Lao PDR by providing connectivity through alternative trade routes. But \nthey  have  also  provided  benefits  to  neighboring  countries.  It  would  be  beneficial  for  the  Lao \nPDR\u2019s economy if these benefits of the externalities are internalized in the form of transit fees. \nEfforts toward such internalization are being made and could be supported by ADB in the future. \n \n170.  Geographical focus of projects. ADB road projects are in different parts of the country. \nEven  within  a  given  project,  the  subprojects  are  located  in  various  parts,  straining  MPWT's \nresources  and  reducing  synergies.  By  ensuring  a  geographical  focus  on  certain  areas  or \nprovinces  within  the  Lao  PDR,  project  management  and  development  effectiveness  could  be \nimproved.  A  corollary  effect  would  possibly  lead  to  better  coordination  with  development \npartners agreeing to focus on different provinces.  \n \n171.  Quality  of  sector  and  project  design  frameworks.  The  CSP  2007\u20132011  includes  a \ntransport sector road map that is similar to that for Cambodia. Both road maps contain outcome \nindicators  that  are  difficult  to  measure,  such  as  road  transport  costs.  Moreover,  the  road  map \ndoes  not  state  the  source  of  these  data.  This  is  also  an  area  of  improvement  for  the  project \ndesign and monitoring frameworks, which have broad indicators that are unquantifiable and not \ntime-bound.  Although  the  quality  of  the  frameworks  has  improved  in  the  last  year  for  new \nprojects,  efforts  need  to  be  made  to  improve  the  quality  of  the  sector  road  map  in  the \nsubsequent country partnership strategy. \n \n172.  Transfer  of  knowledge.  Capacity  development  is  an  area  for  improvement  in  the  Lao \nPDR.  ADB  has  the  potential  to  contribute  to  this  by  bringing  in  good  practice  models  and \nlessons from other countries. This is done indirectly as part of the project management exercise \nwherein  MPWT's  project  managers  build  their  awareness  through  working  with  international \nconsultants and contractors. However, a systematic process is needed for the transfer of good \npractices to the Lao PDR. \n \n173.  Performance  of  contractors.  The  issue  of  contractor  performance  has  been  affecting \nproject  implementation.  Attempts  to  use  local  contractors  are  seen  as  appropriate  for  local \ncapacity development but have resulted in poor project performance. ADB needs to ensure that \nthe procurement process includes rigorous due diligence so that poorly qualified contractors are \nnot selected. This will be important in the context of the 100% grants being provided by ADB for \nfuture projects. \n \n174.  Road  maintenance.  Appropriate  allocation  for  rural  road  maintenance  continues  to  be \nan issue in the Lao PDR. There is no easy solution to address this issue. Sector-wide solutions \nwill ensure consistent sustainability of new rehabilitated roads, but these need to be developed \nin conjunction with the government and all development partners. \n \n175.  Safeguard  assessment  and  monitoring.  Roads  are  likely  to  create  inequality  among \nethnic minority groups, since benefits do not accrue equally to all groups. Such impacts can be \naddressed only if the assessment at appraisal is carried out in a comprehensive manner. Most \noften,  all  ethnic  minority  communities  are  grouped  into  one  category.  This  negates  any \ndifferential  interventions  to  resolve  inequality  among  them.  In  other  words,  there  is  a  need  to \nensure  that  assessment  of  social  groupings  are  carried  out  correctly,  so  that  propensities  for \ndifferential economic development are identified correctly at the feasibility stage. \n \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\n \n\n176.  Suitable due diligence at appraisal is crucial. For sensitive projects, the use of external \nmonitors  needs  to  be  enforced  consistently.  Such  monitors  have  been  used  on  transport \nprojects in the past and have demonstrated value addition. Continuing such external monitoring \nwill  increase  the  chances  of  improvement  in  the  quality  of  the  social  and  environmental \nmitigation plans, and will ensure that the plans are implemented effectively. It will also contribute \nto the building of local capacities in these areas. \n \nB. \n\nRecommendations \n\nindigenous  peoples \n\nimpact  assessment,  monitoring,  and \n\n177.  The 2006 country assistance program evaluation for the Lao PDR recommended that ADB \nshould continue to support road maintenance and road safety (para. 7). Taking into account the \nsector performance stated in paras. 109\u2013113 and paras. 133\u2013137, the recommendations continue \nto  be  valid.  In  addition,  given  below  are  specific  recommendations  from  this  SAPE  for \nconsideration in formulating the next country partnership strategy. Their impacts can be measured \nafter 5 years to evaluate their effectiveness. \n \n178.  Capacity  development.  Support  the  government  in  the  development  of  integrated \ncapacity-building  programs  (instead  of  one-off  TA)  in  specific  areas  such  as  project \nmanagement  at  provincial  levels;  economic,  social,  and  environmental  impact  assessment; \nprocurement; \nidentification  of \nmitigation measures; rural road network expansion; and maintenance funding. With government \ndecentralizing  several  activities  to  the  provincial  level,  it  becomes  crucial  that  capacity  in  the \nprovincial administration is improved in these areas.  \n \n179.  Project-readiness  filters.  Improve  implementation  performance  of  ADB  transport \nprojects  by  mainstreaming  project-readiness  filters  to  assess  the  institutional  preparedness \nwithin the government for implementing a new project. Such filters can be used to check if the \nexecuting and implementing agencies are ready to implement the project so that start-up delays \ncan  be  avoided  (para.  54).  One  option  is  to  include  directions  for  applying  these  filters  in  the \nsubsequent country partnership strategy to enable mainstreaming. \n \n180.  Coordination  of  assistance.  Work  in  conjunction  with  the  government  to  improve \ndevelopment agency coordination in the areas of knowledge management and implementation \nmonitoring.  The  Lao  PDR  has  witnessed  a  major  increase  in  the  number  of  multilateral  and \nbilateral  development  agencies  working  in  various  sectors.  Specifically  in  transport  sector, \nefforts have been made to coordinate the planning and implementation of national assistance, \nbut  these  efforts  are  quite  often  running  parallel  or  overlapping  with  each  other.  By  bringing \ntogether these efforts, it should be possible to develop synergies in terms of time and resources \ncurrently being spent. ADB, as the lead multilateral development partner in the transport sector, \nneeds  to  facilitate  these  synergies  in  conjunction  with  MPWT.  In  the  short  term,  it  is \nrecommended that development agency coordination be targeted at two areas. \n \n181.  The  first  is  knowledge  sharing.  ADB  needs  to  work  in  conjunction  with  other \ndevelopment  agencies  to  create  a  framework  for  identification,  storage,  dissemination,  and \napplication  of  knowledge  of  the  transport  sector  (para.  157).  The  second  area  is  project \nimplementation monitoring. ADB needs to initiate the concept of an annual multipartite meeting \nbetween the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Planning and Investment, MPWT, and all agencies \nto identify implementation problems and find solutions on a sector-wide basis. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nADB ASSISTANCE FOR THE TRANSPORT SECTOR IN THE LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC \n\nTables A1.1 and A1.2 provide a summary of the overall Asian Development Bank assistance to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \n\n \n1. \nRepublic.

It  had  a  2007  population  of  5.9  million,  which  was  growing  at  2.1%  per  year.  It \nconsists  of  236,800  square  kilometers  (km)  of  land  and  has  a  low  population  density  of  25 \npeople per square km. The share of urban population is low at 21% (2006), and per capita gross \ndomestic  product  was  estimated  at  KN6,696  thousand  in  2007.  Vientiane,  the  capital,  has  the \nlargest urban concentration.1 \n \n2. \nOver  the  years,  the  Lao  PDR  has  been  in  the  process  of  transforming  to  a  market-\noriented  economy.  The  government  has  introduced  a  package  of  reforms  focusing  on \ninfrastructure  improvement,  privatization  of  industry,  and  development  of  legal  framework  to \nenhance  economic  activities.  In  recent  years,  macroeconomic  growth  (7.5%  in  2007)  has \nimproved  significantly,  but  the  situation  remains  fragile,  and  further  efforts  are  necessary  to \nmaintain  stability.  Agriculture  remains  a  major  sector,  contributing  32.8%  to  the  economy, \nemploying  about  2  million  of  the  labor  force.  Industry  contributes  25.2%  to  the  economy,  and \nservices,  which  include  transport  and  communications,  have  grown  steadily  to  40.0%  (Table \nA3.1).2 \n \n\nTable A3.1: Sector Contribution to Gross Domestic Product \n(current producer\u2019s prices, %) \n \n\n2006 \nItem  \n42.6 \nAgriculture \n31.8 \nIndustry  \nServices \n25.6 \nSource: Asian Development Bank. 2008.

Transport demand has been growing over the years, but transport of passengers and \ngoods  is  constrained  by  an  inadequate  network  exacerbated  by  poor  physical  conditions.  In \n2007, the road network accounted for 93% of passengers per km of travel and 85% of freight \ntraffic  (i.e.,  tons  per  km).  The  remaining  passenger  and  freight  traffic  are  carried  through \nwaterways and aviation. Air transport serves 2% of passenger demand and plays an important \nrole  in  linking  main  urban  centers,  tourist  destinations,  and  inaccessible  parts  of  the  country. \nThe volume of airfreight, however, is negligible (Figures A3.1\u2013A3.4).3 \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2008.

The GMS transport sector strategy defines the \nkey transport corridors of the Northern Corridor, connecting Thailand and the PRC (comprising \nNational  Road  3  in  the  Lao  PDR);  the  Central  Corridor  (National  Road  13  in  the  Lao  PDR), \nlinking  Cambodia  and  the  PRC;  the  East\u2013West  Corridor  (Road  9)  between  Thailand  and  Viet \nNam,  crossing  the  Mekong  River  at  Savannakhet;  and  the  new  Northeastern  Corridor, \nconnecting northern Viet Nam and Thailand along a new road (in the long-term parallel roads 6 \nand 7 within the Lao PDR) to Louangphrabang and Road 4 to Thailand.4 \n \n\n1. \n\nRoad Transport \n\n \n1. \nClassification.  The  public  road  network  is  divided  into  (i)  national,  (ii)  provincial, \n(iii) district, (iv) urban, (v) rural, and (vi) special.5 Each class is formally defined in the Road Law \nof 1999 (Table A3.2).6 Based on mid-2008 estimates, there are about 35,557 km of public roads \nin the country. Of this, national and provincial roads each account for close to 20%.

Paved  roads \nformed 56% of the national roads and 3% of local roads. The other roads had gravel (33.7%) or \nearth  surfaces  (52.3%).  Thus,  seasonal  closures  are  frequent  due  to  poor  pavement  and \ndeficient  cross-drainage.  The  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport  (MPWT)  reported  in  its \n2008 strategy paper that many of these sections are impassable during the rainy season (Table \nA3.2). \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB.  2007.

According  to  data  by  the  MPWT  (formerly  called  the  Ministry  of \nCommunications,  Transport,  Post,  and  Construction  [MCTPC]),8  the  vehicle  base  in  the  Lao \nPDR increased from 59,781 in 1985 to 568,290 in 2005, with the highest growth occurring from \n2000  to  2005  at  almost  197%.  Motorcycles,  which  account  for  almost  80%  of  total,  are  used \nprimarily  for  short  travel,  and  their  numbers  have  been  increasing  in  recent  years.  Longer \ndistance traffic comprises a mix of trucks, buses, and light vehicles. The truck fleet includes 4-\naxle, 12-wheel rigid vehicles; truck\u2013trailer combinations; 10-wheel general purpose trucks; and \nmany  mid-sized  2-axle  6-wheelers.  There  are  a  limited  number  of  regular  long-distance  bus \nservices  using  modern  purpose-built  vehicles.  Local  passengers  services  are  operated  by \nconverted trucks, pickups, or tuk-tuks.9 Small trucks and light vehicles dominate the provincial \nand  local  road  networks.

Vientiane is the main international \ngateway,  while  Louangphrabang  and  Pakxe  accept  regional  traffic  and  provide  customs, \nimmigration,  and  quarantine  services.  Another  significant  provincial  airport  is  Savannakhet. \nMPWT  reported  that  all  airports  were  recently  upgraded.  Wattay  International  Airport  at \nVientiane is capable of assisting the largest jets, and Louangphrabang and Pakxe  can handle \nregional  jets  and  turbo  props.  There  are  also  10  minor  airports  in  provincial  capitals  and  39 \nother airstrips (footnote 3). \n \nSeveral international airlines such as Air Asia, Bangkok Airways, China Eastern Airlines, \n10. \nLao  Airlines,  Thai  Airways,  and  Vietnam  Airlines  provide  international  services.  Direct \nconnections are also available to Bangkok, Chiang Mai, and Ha Noi from Louangphrabang, and \nto  Bangkok  and  Siem  Reap  from  Pakxe.  Scheduled  domestic  services  are  operated  on  main \nroutes13 by Lao Airlines with regular daily services, and additional flights are made in the rainy \nseason to selected locations. The state-owned airline, Lao Air, flies 10-seat Cessna aircrafts on \na regular basis to three remote provinces\u2014Houaphan, Phongsali, and Xayabury. Domestic and \ninternational services are provided primarily for tourist traffic.14 \n \n\n3. \n\nRailway Transit \n\n \n11.  MPWT reported that a direct railway link from Thailand to Thanaleng was completed in \nJuly  2008  (footnote  3).  The  initial  railway  infrastructure  into  the  Lao  PDR  comprises  a  3.5  km \nlink  from  the  Thai  railway  system  in  Nong  Khai  across  the  Friendship Bridge  to  Thanaleng  on \nthe  outskirts  of  Vientiane.  A  passenger  station  at  Thanaleng  with  plans  for  a  future  freight \nterminal and logistics center is under way. \n \n\n4. \n\nInland Waterways \n\n \n12. \nOver  2,000  km  of  the  Mekong  River  and  its  tributaries  are  located  in  the  Lao  PDR. \nDuring the dry season, the navigable length is reduced to 1,300 km. The river forms the border \nbetween the Lao PDR and Myanmar, and the remaining length defines the border with Thailand. \nThe northern sector of the river is used for international trade among the PRC, Lao PDR, and \nThailand. Trade on the river has been increasing in recent years. \n \n13.  MPWT  reported  recent  improvements  that  allow  100\u2013150  ships  to  navigate  year-round \nbetween the PRC and Houayxai (footnote 3). The river between Louangphrabang and Vientiane \nis navigable all year, although there are difficult sections, with Vientiane\u2013Thakhek\u2013Savannakhet \nas  the  best  section.  Navigation  is  also  easy  in  the  Pakxe\u2013Don  Deth  section  along  the  border \nwith Cambodia. \n \n14. \nThere  are  21  river  port  facilities  on  the  side  of  the  river.  Lakse  Port  in  Vientiane  is  the \nmain port, with 20,000\u201330,000 tons per year going through it. Houayxai, Louangphrabang, and \nPakbeng each handle 10,000 tons of traffic. Vessels of 300 deadweight tons or greater capacity \ncarry  mainly  industrial  and  agricultural  products  such  as  sand,  rocks,  wood  products,  food \n\n                                                 \n13 Includes Houayxai, Louangnamtha, Louangphrabang, Oudomxai, Pakxe, Savannakhet, and Xiengkhouang.  \n14 ADB.  2002.

Traffic  is  mainly  domestic,  although  international  traffic  is \npresent in the upper section among the PRC, the Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Thailand. \n \n15. \n\nThe key benefits of inland waterways transport are  \n(i) \n\nlower financial costs relative to roads and railways, and high economic benefits in \nterms of movement of bulk goods, which can cover a wide community (i.e., local, \nregional, and national economies); \nreduced  travel  time  owing  to  negligible  congestion  associated  with  road \ntransport; and \nreduced  external  costs  linked  to  air  and  noise  pollution,  and  accidents,  which \nimpact  indirectly  on  the  wider  community.  The  diversion  of  traffic  from  one \ntransport  mode  to  another  will  also  have  various  impacts  on  costs  indirectly \nborne  by  the  community,  such  as  a  reduction  in  the  costs  of  infrastructure \nprovision and maintenance. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThese indicate the potential for the Lao PDR to develop its inland waterways transport \n\n5. \n\nUrban Transport \n\n \nA study on the Master Plan on Comprehensive Urban Transport (footnote 10) reported \n17. \nthat  transport  in  Vientiane  has  improved  and  has  been  upgraded  to  cope  with  growing  traffic \ndemand.  In  recent  years,  Vientiane  has  concentrated  on  construction  and  rehabilitation  of \nasphalt, earth, and feeder roads in its districts; road links between district and rural areas; and \ninner  and  outer  ring  roads.  In  addition,  bridges  were  constructed  or  repaired  in  Sangthong \nDistrict and Xaisettha District. A summary of transport in Vientiane is shown in Table A3.8. \n \n\nTable A3.8: Transport in Vientiane, 2001\u20132005 \n\nCategory \nGoods transport (ton) \nPassenger transport (person) \nGoods circulation (ton x km)  \nPassenger circulation (person x km)  \nkm = kilometer. \nSource:  Sixth  Five-Year  Social  Economic  Development  Plan  (2006\u20131010)  cited  in  the  Government  of  the  Lao \nPeople's Democratic Republic, Ministry of Communications, Transport, Post, and Construction and Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency. 2008.

In 2006, more than 200,000 vehicles were registered. A traffic survey conducted \nin the study area15 showed that there is usually high traffic in major roads, with the highest traffic \nvolume  observed  in  front  of  the  Pohphano  Temple  along  Kaysone  Road.  This  road  section \nwitnesses 58,470 vehicles per day for both directions, including motorcycles (Figure A3.8). This \nindicates a potential issue of congestion that is likely to become more visible in the future across \nVientiane City. \n\n                                                 \n15 Includes  the  whole  areas  of  districts  of  Chanthabouly  and  Sisattanak  and  inner  parts  of  districts  of  Hatxayfong, \nSikhottabong, Xaisettha, and Xaithany.

MPWT  is  the  national  government  agency  primarily  in  charge  of  transport.  It  is \nresponsible for developing national and provincial roads, civil aviation, urban transport systems, \nriver  wharves,  and  river  and  road  transport.  It  consists  of  six  departments:  the  Department  of \nCivil  Aviation,  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban  Planning,  Department  of  Inland  Water, \nDepartment of Planning and Cooperation, Department of Roads, and Department of Transport. \nBased  on  5-year  transport  plans,  the  provinces  submit  annual  implementation  plans  for \ntransport  projects  to  MPWT,  which  submits  them  to  the  Committee  for  Planning  and \nCooperation  of  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Office  for  approval.  The  Department  of  Planning  and \nCooperation handles the accounting and financial matters of MPWT. \n \ntransport  administration  provides  a  delegated, \n20. \ndecentralized system of coordination and implementation.16 MPWT has overall responsibility but \ndelegates tasks and responsibilities to divisions of public works and transport (DPWTs) in each \nprovince  through  subsidiary  offices  in  districts.  Similarly,  DPWTs  delegate  other  tasks  and \nresponsibilities  to  offices  of  public  works  and  transport,  which  are  headed  by  DPWT  staff. \nDPWTs  report  to  the  provincial  governor,  although  MPWT  is  responsible  for  establishing \nnational  technical  standards  (footnote  3).  An  average  of  75  DPWT  staff  members  operate  in \neach province. \n \n \n \n21.  Within  MPWT,  the  Department  of  Roads  has  the  responsibility  for  the  overall \nmanagement  of  the  entire  road  network.  Its  senior  management  sets  goals,  objectives,  and \nstandards; decides on systems and procedures; approves plans; allocates funds; and monitors \nthe  implementation  of  projects.  The  department  consists  of  two  divisions:  (i)  the  Road \nAdministration  Division,  which  deals  with  national  road  construction  and  maintenance;  and \n(ii) the  Local  Roads  Division,  which  assists  DPWTs  and  offices  of  public  works  and  transport \n\nRoad Transport \n\nfor \n\n1. \n\n                                                 \n16 K.

The  Road  Administration  Division  assumes \nresponsibility for national road maintenance, but the provinces, on MPWT's behalf, arrange the \nactual  works.  DPWTs  take  care  of  road  maintenance  within  the  provinces.  The  Local  Roads \nDivision sets out the directions and priorities for provincial maintenance programs and monitors \nand evaluates the results.17 \n \n22.  With  decentralization,  provinces  are  now  responsible  for  local  roads,  although  DPWTs \nmanage the overall road network. Expenditure on local roads comes under the provincial budget \nagreed with the government. Offices of public works and transport are responsible for planning \nand  supervising  the  maintenance  of  district  and  rural  roads  under  the  supervision,  technical \nguidance, and assistance provided by DPWTs. \n \nThe  RMF  was  created  within  the  organizational  structure  of  MCTPC  (now  known  as \n23. \nMPWT).  It  is  supervised  and  directed  by  an  advisory  board,  which  consists  of  representatives \nfrom  the  public  and  private  sectors,  appointed  by  the  Prime  Minister,  from  the  Ministry  of \nFinance,  MPWT,  provincial  authorities,  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry,  road  and \npassenger transport operators, and the general public. The chair is nominated by MPWT. The \nadvisory board, together with the MPWT minister, decides on fund allocations and use. It also \nrecommends charges based on maintenance requirements.18 The Road Administration Division, \nunder  MPWT,  coordinates  with  the  RMF  regarding  financial  support  for  national  road \nmaintenance, and with the Local Roads Division regarding local roads. \n \n \n \n24.  Within MPWT, the Department of Civil Aviation is responsible for policy and planning in \ncivil  aviation  and  for  regulatory  oversight  of  technical  and  safety  matters  pertaining  to  Lao \nAviation  and  the  Lao  Airports  Authority.  The  department  has  eight  divisions  plus  the  Lao \nAirports Authority.19 The civil aviation sector is governed by the department as designated by a \nPrime Minister\u2019s decree. The Lao Airports Authority has eight sections and is responsible for the \noperation  and  maintenance  of  Vientiane's  international  airport,  two  regional  airports  (at \nLouangphrabang  and  Pakxe),  and \n(at  Louang  Namtha  and \nSavannakhet). All other provincial small airports are the responsibility of provincial governments \nwith  the  department\u2019s  technical  consultation.  The  Vientiane  international  terminal  has  been \noperated by a joint venture, the Lao\u2013Japan Airport Terminal Services, since June 1999. \n \n25. \nThe Department of Civil Aviation is currently finalizing a comprehensive master plan for \nair transport that addresses the future development of civil aviation in the Lao PDR.

Vientiane. \n\nKey Challenges \n\n \nE. \n \n27. \nchallenges. \n\nThe  current  situation  on  the  Lao  PDR  transport  sector  raised  the  following  key \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nRural accessibility. The majority of the country's road network consists of rural \nroads that are mostly unpaved and remain impassable during the rainy season. \nMany  people  live  in  remote  areas  and  have  no  access  to  utilities  and  basic \nservices. Road design standards and construction practices must be developed \nto  improve  rural  roads  (e.g.,  by  using  labor-based  construction  methods  and \nadopting greater community participation). \nFunding  and  maintenance.  Huge  investments  in  infrastructure  must  be \nmaintained  to  sustain  economic  growth.  The  RMF  has  been  established  and \nbegan operations in 2002; however, its expected revenues may not be sufficient. \nHence, the country remains heavily dependent on external support in the form of \ngrants or soft loans. The RMF mostly finances national roads and provides very \nlimited  budgetary  allocations  for  remaining  roads  at  the  provincial  and  local \nlevels.  Even  funding  for  the  routine  maintenance  of  provincial  and  local  roads \nremains a problem. \nDistribution of demand. There is an unbalanced transport demand toward road \ntransport  and  against  railways  and  air  services.  The  potential  of  other  transport \nmodes, such as railways, waterways, or by air, need to be maximized. \nRoad  safety.  Recent  trends  showed  that  accident  rates  have  been  increasing, \nand  correspondingly,  so  have  injuries  and  fatalities.  The  government  has  put  in \nplace  the  National  Road  Safety  Strategy  and  Action  Plan,  which  aims  to \nstrengthen  the  road  accident  data  system,  provide  safe  planning  of  roads,  and \nconduct  road  safety  education  and  an  information  campaign.  The  government \nhopes  to  reduce  the  rate  of  fatalities  to  8  persons  per  10,000  vehicles  by  2010 \nand 5 persons per 10,000 vehicles by 2015. The government is also focusing on \nimproving  enforcement,  the  technical  environment,  coordination,  and  research \nand evaluation (footnotes 3 and 7). \nOverloading.  Overloading  has  been  identified  as  one  of  the  reasons  for  road \ndeterioration,  particularly  in  international  traffic.  The  government  has  recently \nimproved  enforcement  on  load  limits  in  line  with  its  ASEAN  commitments.  A \nreview of existing regulations is also underway. \nInstitutional  development.  Decentralization  has  placed  provincial-  and  district-\nlevel  officials  at  the  forefront  of  infrastructure  service  delivery,  although  the \ncentral  government  retains  regulations  and  oversight.  With  the  demand  to \nimprove performance, the provincial and local authorities should have adequate \nskills and training on road planning, operations, and management. There is also \na need to provide transparency and accountability in the award of contracts. \n(vii)  Regional  trade.  The  Lao  PDR's  current  potential  in  promoting  trade  through \nregional integration has been identified as a priority. There have been efforts to \ndevelop and/or improve transport links that connect the country with neighboring \ncountries.  As  such,  policy  dialogue  harmonizing  government  regulations, \nparticularly  on  customs  procedures,  must  be  an  important  concern  to  facilitate \nthe movement of goods. \n\n(vi) \n\n(v) \n\nThe major issues relating to urban transport include the following. \n(i) \n\nThere  is  high  demand  to  improve  road  planning  in  Vientiane.  A  2008  study  on \nurban  transport  observed  that  the  current  road  system  failed  to  consider  future \ndevelopments,  such  as  accessing  the  new  railway  and  town  development \n(footnote  11).  Also,  the  rapid  increase  of  vehicles  is  expected  to  result  in  traffic \ncongestion and accidents, which the current road system may not address. \nTraffic  management  issues  identified  include  mixing  passengers,  cars,  trucks, \nbuses,  motorcycles,  tuk-tuks,  bicycles,  and  pedestrians  on  the  road;  improper \n\n(ii) \n\n \n28. \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n61 \n\n(iii) \n\nin  enforcing \n\ntraffic  safety.  Countermeasures  on \n\ninstallation  of  traffic  signals,  signs,  and  road  markings;  insufficient  and/or  illegal \nparking of vehicles in commercial zones and market areas; and limited facilities \nand  capacities \ntraffic \nmanagement,  road  safety  programs,  and  a  review  of  transport  policies  are \nrequired (footnote 11). \nFinancing  arrangements  for  urban  development  are  constrained  given  the \ngovernment's  limited  capacity  to  generate  revenue.  Given  that  the  national \nbudget is the main source of financing for urban development and operation and \nmaintenance  of  roads  throughout  the  country,  local  governments  need  to \nmobilize  their  own  financial  resources  to  meet  local  needs.  In  Vientiane, \nadditional  funds  for  transport  development  are  sourced  from  user  charges  for \nsolid  waste  management  services  and  land  taxes.  In  line  with  financial \ndecentralization  and  delegation  of  budget  controls,  a  suitable  framework  to \nprovide for sustained funding for operation and maintenance should be in place \nconsidering  direct  and  indirect  cost-recovery  principles  (e.g.,  funds  from  vehicle \nuser charges and property taxes) (footnote 10). \n\n \n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nEvolution of the Sector Strategy \n\nADB TRANSPORT SECTOR STRATEGY IN THE LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC \n \nA. \n \nThe 1991 operational strategy for the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) was \n1. \nthe first formal strategic basis for Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance.1 It was developed \nwhen the Lao PDR was undergoing a transition from a command to a market-oriented economy. \nIt  was  aligned  with  the government\u2019s  new  economic  mechanism;2  the  Second  Five-Year  Plan, \n1986\u20131990;  and  the  government\u2019s  medium-term  development  strategy,  which  was  then  being \nprepared. The 1991 operational strategy was aimed at (i) putting into place an enabling policy \nand  institutional  reforms  necessary  for  the  development  of  competitive  markets  and  private \nsector  investments,  and  (ii)  providing  for  direct  investment  interventions  such  as  essential \nphysical  infrastructure  to  support  private  sector  activities.  Against  this  broad  strategic  focus, \nADB  saw  the  transport  sector  as  an  area  in  which  the  government  could  attract  the  private \nsector by linking the Lao PDR to neighboring countries such as the People\u2019s Republic of China \nand  Viet  Nam.  Adopting  government  priorities  during  the  medium  term,  the  1991  operational \nstrategy  emphasized  national  and  provincial  road  networks,  river  ports,  and  airport  facilities. \nADB  also  prioritized  the  negotiation  of  transit  rights  through  neighboring  countries  and  the \nintroduction of a regulatory framework, which included user charges. \n \nThe 1996 country operational strategy also placed a high priority on economic growth to \n2. \nsustain  the  process  of  economic  transition.3  Policy  reforms,  social  services,  and  human \nresources  development  were  expected  to  enhance  the  economic  environment  and  incentive \nframework.  The  1996  country  operational  strategy  was  in  line  with  the  government's  medium-\nterm development strategy (until 2000). Similar to the 1991 operational strategy, assistance for \ntransport was focused on the development of link roads with other countries and secondary and \nfeeder roads. \n \nThe  2000  country  assistance  plan  emphasized  the  need  to  pursue  more  balanced \n3. \neconomic  growth  due  to  increasing  disparities  in  incomes.4  Thus,  there  was  a  great  need  to \ndeepen  reforms  in  public  expenditure  management.  The  2000  country  assistance  plan  saw \ntransport  infrastructure  as  critical  to  providing  increased  access  to  markets  and  economic \nopportunities.  ADB  also  recommended  strengthening  capacities  in  the  maintenance  of  assets, \nproviding  adequate  funding  and  staffing,  and  establishing  a  system  for  sustainable  operation \nand  maintenance  of  the  roads  network.  During  the  preparation  of  this  plan,  ADB  provided \nassistance for both rural access roads and strategic corridors with subregional links. \n \n4. \nThe strategic focus of the country strategy and program (CSP) 2002\u20132004 was poverty \nreduction  supported  by  three  pillars:  (i)  sustainable  economic  growth,  (ii)  inclusive  social \ndevelopment, and (iii) good governance through policy and institutional development.5 Though \ndeveloping economic corridors with subregional links remained a priority, the CSP  2002\u20132004 \nemphasized rural access roads and small airports to improve transport links in small towns and \nurban areas and to facilitate rural development and market links. \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  1991.

Manila. \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n63 \n\n \nLike the CSP 2002\u20132004, the CSP 2003\u201320056 was also focused on poverty reduction. \n5. \nIt  was  consistent  with  the  government\u2019s  policy  on  poverty  eradication;  the  Poverty  Reduction \nPartnership Agreement, which was signed by the government and ADB in September 2000; and \nthe  Millennium  Development  Goals.  The  Poverty  Reduction  Partnership  Agreement  identified \nroad  transport  as  a  priority  sector  with  agriculture,  rural  development,  education,  and  health. \nRural access roads, subregional roads, and airport improvement were among the specific areas \nof intervention. \n \n6. \nThe  strategic  focus  of  the  CSP  2003\u20132005  remained  valid  under  the  CSP  updates \n2004\u20132005, 2005\u20132006, and 2006\u20132008.7 Then, in 2003, the government prepared an interim \npoverty reduction strategy paper and the draft National Poverty Eradication Programme, which \nwas  also  in  line  with  the  Poverty  Reduction  Partnership  Agreement.  This  program  focused  on \nthe  transport,  agriculture,  and  social  sectors.  The  CSP  updates  2004\u20132005,  2005\u20132006,  and \n2006\u20132008  (footnote  7)  also  emphasized  private  sector  development  and  its  important  role  in \nhydropower, mining, forestry, agriculture, and tourism. Transport development was increasingly \nhighlighted by the CSPs as a priority in border development and subregional integration, with a \nfocus  on  the  transformation  of  the  transport  corridor  into  a  full-fledged  economic  corridor. \nImprovement of Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) roads and northern airports were mentioned \nas  possible  areas  of  assistance  for  project  loans.  Technical  assistance  was  lined  up  for  the \npreparation of a transport sector strategy for the next 10 years. \n \nThe  CSP  2007\u20132011,8  which  is  the  current  country  strategy  for  the  Lao  PDR,  also \n7. \nfocuses on poverty reduction. The CSP 2007\u20132011 is anchored on the government\u2019s Sixth Five-\nYear  National  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan,  2006\u20132010  and  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \noverarching  goal  of  poverty  reduction.9  It  seeks  to  harmonize  poverty  reduction  and  economic \ngrowth  through  three  strategic  pillars:  (i)  promoting  pro-poor  and  sustainable  growth, \n(ii) fostering  inclusive  social  development,  and  (iii)  good  governance.  ADB  assistance  remains \nfocused  on  the  management  of  the  road  network  and  expansion  of  access  roads  to  the  main \nroad network. Specific intervention areas include sector regulations, sustainable maintenance of \nthe  road  network  through  the  Road  Maintenance  Fund,  improvement  of  transport  logistics, \nmanagement of social and environmental impacts, and implementation of a national road safety \nstrategy and action plan. With the issuance of the GMS regional strategy (of which the Lao PDR \nplays  an  integral  role),  economic  growth  will  be  accelerated  by  extending  main  transport \ncorridors  (north\u2013south  and  east\u2013west),  facilitating  trade  and  tourism,  and  implementing  the \nCross-Border Transport Agreement.10 Further, under the GMS transport strategy, 2006\u20132015,11 \nADB  is  concentrating  on  the  completion  and  expansion  of  strategic  transport  corridors, \nimprovement  of  the  transport  network  in  northwestern  Lao  PDR,  and  the  connection  of  the \nborder  crossing  with  Thailand.  Assistance  is  under  way  on  improving  the  airport  in \nLouangphrabang and the Northern Transport Corridor to promote tourism. \n \n8. \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2002.

There \nwere two macroeconomic \nconsiderations: (i) to mobilize \ndomestic resources and expand \nexports, and (ii) to provide for \nbasic needs and support social \nservices. \n\nIt aided the transition to a \nmarket-oriented economy \nthrough public administration \nstrengthening and reform, \nplanning and policy analysis, \ncreation of an institutional and \nlegal framework for private \nsector investment, \ncommercialization and/or \nprivatization of state-owned \nenterprises, resource \nmobilization, and financial sector \ndevelopment. \n \nIt focused on diversification and \nexpansion of the production and \nexport base through physical \ninfrastructure, hydropower and \n\n1996 \n1996 Country Operational Strategy \nStudy \n\nThis highlighted four strategic \nconsiderations: (i) enhance \neconomic growth, and broaden its \nimpact; (ii) continue to move forward \nwith the transition to a market-\noriented economy to ensure its \nsustainability; (iii) progressively \naddress human resources and \ninstitutional capacity constraints to \nensure capacity to foster \ndevelopment and to enable equitable \ndistribution of benefits; and (iv) \ndevelop economic policy in the \ncontext of growing subregional \nintegration. High priority was placed \non sustainable economic growth, and \npolicy reform, social services, and \nhuman development was \nemphasized to enhance the \neconomic environment and incentive \nframework. \nADB prioritized investing in economic \ngrowth projects in infrastructure as \nwell as sustainable growth by \npromoting partnerships with the \nprivate sector for these projects and \nfocusing on ensuring that these \ninvestments provided, in addition to \nexport potential, appropriate budget \nsupport that could be used to raise \ndomestic capacity and improve \nsocial service delivery. \n \nIt also helped develop a policy \nframework to further transition to a \nmarket economy. \n \nIt focused on human resources \ndevelopment and capacity building. \n\n6\n4\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n4\n \n\ni\n\n2000 \nCountry Assistance Plan, \n2001\u20132003 \n\nThis continued to emphasize \neconomic growth in physical \ninfrastructure as well as the \nneed to pursue more balanced \ngrowth to address income \ndisparities. It highlighted the \ngovernment's thrust to deepen \nreforms, particularly on public \nexpenditure management. \n\n2001 \nCountry Strategy and Program, \n2002\u20132004 \n\nPoverty reduction by broadening \ncommunity participation and \nopportunities was the unifying principle \nof ADB interventions in the Lao PDR \nover the next 5 years. The CSP was \naimed at helping the government \nsubstantially reduce poverty through \nthree pillars: (i) sustainable economic \ngrowth, (ii) inclusive social \ndevelopment with poverty and equity \nas goals, and (iii) good governance \nthrough policy and institutional \ndevelopment. \n\nThe CAP focused on (i) \nstructural reforms and enhanced \ngovernance, (ii) rural \ndevelopment, (iii) human \nresources development, (iv) \nsustainable natural resources \nmanagement, (v) geographical \nand integrated planning focus of \nproject interventions, and (vi) \ncommunity participation in the \nselection and design of ADB \nprojects. \n\nRural development and market links \n(i.e., urban\u2013rural links, rural \ninfrastructure development, agriculture \nproductivity) and developing transport \nand information links with small towns, \nurban areas, and larger markets were \nin line with efforts of promoting rural \nemployment and broadening market \naccess. With community participation, \nADB supported the development of \ntransport (especially rural access \nroads), electricity and water supply, \nand other rural physical infrastructure \nto encourage investment in agriculture \nand other rural businesses. \n \nDevelopment (including education, \nhealth care, water supply and \n\n\fItem \n\n1991 \n\n1996 \n1996 Country Operational Strategy \nStudy \n\n2000 \nCountry Assistance Plan, \n2001\u20132003 \n\n \n\n \nIt also promoted subregional \ncooperation. \n\n1991 Operational Strategy \n\nother natural resources, \nstrengthening regional economic \nlinks, and environmental \nsafeguards and sustainable \ndevelopment. \n \nIt also addressed basic needs \nthrough basic education and \ntechnical skills training, health \nservices, and water supply. \n\nThe 1991 operational strategy \nrecognized that the transport \nsector has important regional \nsignificance. It was seen as one \nof the areas where the \ngovernment could support \nprivate sector activity by \nimproving the viability of \ninvestments and linking \nneighboring countries. ADB \nadopted the government's \npriorities for the transport sector \nas follows: \n\u2022  completion of the national \n\nroad network, including road \nlinks with the PRC and Viet \nNam and bridge links with \nThailand; \n\n\u2022  greater emphasis on the \nprovincial road network; \n\n\u2022  negotiation of improved transit \nrights through neighboring \ncountries; \n\n\u2022  improvement of river port and \n\nairport facilities and the \nestablishment of new \ninternational air routes; and \n\nADB Transport \nStrategy \n\n \n\nThere was no separate transport \nsector strategy under the 1996 COS \nfor the Lao PDR. Rather, \nstrengthening transport (with \ncommunications and power) was \nincluded under  \n\u2022  supporting sustainable growth, \n\nthrough development of link roads \nwith other countries and secondary \nand feeder roads; and \n\n\u2022  rural development, as transport \nproblems were seen as part of \ndeveloping the agriculture sector \nsince low growth or productivity \nwas linked to government policies \non poor infrastructure. Expansion \nof the surface transport system \nwas identified as a determinant of \nrural development. As such, the \nsystematic expansion of priority \naccess roads construction was an \nimportant objective of ADB loan \nand technical assistance \nprograms. \n\nThe CAP saw transport \ninfrastructure as critical to \nproviding increased access to \nmarkets and economic \nopportunities. \n \nGiven the high priority accorded \nto road development, particularly \nnational roads, the need to \nstrengthen capacity in the \nmaintenance of assets, efficient \nmanagement, and service \ndelivery was emphasized. \nSpecifically, the CAP highlighted \nthe need to plan financial \narrangements for subregional \nprojects and the early integration \nof social and environmental \nconcerns in road planning and \ndevelopment.

However, there was still a 6-month \ndelay, as the consultants were in place only in December 1993 compared with \nJuly 1993 as envisaged. Prequalification of contractors also took longer than \nenvisaged at appraisal. \n \nIssues included (i) lengthy discussions between MCTPC and ADB with respect to \nthe recommended shortlist of contractors to be invited to tender; (ii) late \ncompletion of tendering due to concerns about the availability of loan funds (i.e., \ndetailed design that the cost of construction would be higher than expected); and \n(iii) contractors' lack of resources, cash flow problems, lack of skilled labor, and \nlack of qualified engineers and supervisors. \n \nPre-selection of consultants was approved by ADB at the management review \nmeeting on 29 March 1995. There was no delay in the recruitment of consultants, \nwhich was actually done earlier than envisaged. The services of the supervision \nconsultants were extended due to delays in the completion of the additional civil \nworks (contract C) after identifying quality defects. \n \nADB approved advance procurement action in December 1996. The \nprequalification of the civil works contractors was carried out between January \nand June 1997. \n \nDelay in project implementation was attributed to the start of the civil works \ncontracts, particularly (i) the late arrival of the contractors\u2019 equipment; (ii) slow \npreparation of works; (iii) contractors' substandard organization, planning, and \ncommunication; (iv) unfavorable weather conditions; and (v) unexplored \nordnance clearing. \n \nAdvanced procurement action was approved, and it proceeded ahead of loan \neffectiveness. The prequalification process for the National Road 9 contract \nproceeded rapidly, and ADB approved 13 applicants in December 1999, 2 weeks \nbefore loan approval. Five top-ranked firms were invited to submit tenders, and \nthe selection was made on the basis of price. The contract was signed as soon \nas the loan became effective. \n \nThere was, however, a slow start in Viet Nam, which also delayed the Lao PDR \ncomponent. Delays in the completion of the civil works contracts were a result of \nunforeseen technical difficulties (e.g., insufficient initial survey work necessitating \nsome redesign, deeply buried unexploded ordnance discoveries in the Lao PDR \nafter areas had been declared clear, and material supply difficulties). \n \nThe desired early implementation did not materialize because it took longer than \nexpected for the executing agency to take the necessary preparatory steps for \nproject implementation. Specifically, although the Capital Works Implementation \nUnit was already formed in June 1993, it was only early in 1994 that the project \noffice and tender committee were set up. This contributed to the delay in \nimplementation. \n\nChampasack Road \nImprovement \n\nXieng Khouang \nRoad Improvement \n\nGMS East\u2013West \nCorridor (Regional)  \n\nAirports \nImprovement \n\n \n\n \n\n\f76 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n \n\nProject Name \n \n\nFindings and/or Issues \nDelays in the appointment of consultants were attributed to (i) inexperience of the \nexecuting agency, (ii) delays in the tendering process, and (iii) slow mobilization \nand/or preparation of tender documents and documents in the prequalification \nphase. \n\nProjects without Advance Procurement \nVientiane Plain \nRoad Improvement \n \nSecond Road \nImprovement \n\nThere was an 8-month delay in the delivery of workshop equipment, which \nprevented construction activities from starting. \n \nProject implementation was behind schedule because of (i) late engagement of \nconsultants, which affected the commencement of detailed engineering; (ii) the \ncompletion survey for Road B as well as the design changes caused the overall \ndesign activity to be completed in 37 months instead of 7 months as appraised; \n(iii) a prolonged procurement process for construction equipment and the \nreorganization of the executing agency; and (iv) problems with local funding. \n \nActual start and completion dates were slightly delayed because of the slow \nmobilization of equipment. The problems that contributed to the late completion \nincluded (i) delayed installation and start of production of pipe culverts from the \npipe-making plant; (ii) lack of prompt supply of cement, steel reinforcement bars, \nand equipment spare parts, resulting in inordinate delays to plant operations; (iii) \ndelays of up to 6 months in payments for labor; and (iv) operational problems \nwithin the Road and Bridge Construction Enterprise, which reduced production, \nparticularly at the crushing plant and the workshop. \n \nThere was a delay in the completion of detailed engineering and subsequently in \nthe procurement and contract award. Construction delays were caused by \n(i) numerous massive landslides that occurred on the project road; and (ii) \ntedious government procedures for approval of bids for construction materials, \nequipment, spare parts, and other materials. \n \nThe following were observed: (i) difficulty in recruiting labor in the remote project \narea, and (ii) additional work that resulted from the relocation of the bridge over \nthe Nam Khan River. \n \nDelays in the completion of civil works were due to (i) the late mobilization of the \ncontractors' equipment and contractors' substandard organization; (ii) joint \nventure problems; (iii) award of the contractors during the rainy season; (iv) lack \nof financial resources and/or delays in the raising of counterpart funds; and (v) \nchanges in design and additional work, such as increased roadway excavation. \n\nThird Road \nImprovement \n\nFourth Road \nImprovement \n\nFifth Road \nImprovement \n\nRural Access \nRoads \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank;  GMS  =  Greater  Mekong  Subregion,  MCTPC  =  Ministry  of  Communications, \nTransport, Post, and Construction; Lao PDR= Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \nSource: Project completion reports. \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n77 \n\n \n2. \n2000 and 2009. \n \n\nTable A6.2 provides a summary of the increase in costs on projects completed between \n\nTable A6.2: Status of Increase in Costs for ADB-Financed Completed Road Projects in \nthe Lao PDR \n\nIncrease in Costs \nor Cost Overrun of \nCivil Works or \nRoad Improvement \nComponent \n(%) \n17 \n\nLoan \nNumber \n1234 \n\nProject \n\nSixth Road \nImprovement \n\n1369 \n\n1533 \n\nChampasack Road \nImprovement \n\nXieng Khouang Road \nImprovement \n\n1727 \n\nGMS: East\u2013West \nEconomic Corridor  \n\n2 \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n1795 \n\nRural Access Roads \n\n21 \n\nChange in Project Scope \n\nThe cost overrun in road improvement components \nresulted in a reduction in the actual length of \nprovincial roads improved and in the number of minor \nbridge works.

The loan savings supported \ndesign changes and achievement of the full project \nscope at appraisal.  \n\nLoan savings from lower than expected bids financed \nadditional works including expansion in the scope of \nrural roads under the rural community access \ninfrastructure component. In other words, the project \nachieved more outputs. \n\nLoan savings from currency movements and lower \nthan expected bids were used to finance variations \nand additional works under the road improvement \nand feeder road components. Despite overall loan \nsavings benefiting the project, the civil works \ncomponent had an increase in costs due to an \nincrease in the length of roads improved. \n\nGMS = Greater Mekong Subregion. \nNote:  Cost  overrun  has  been  measured  as  the  ratio  of  the  difference  in  civil  works  cost  at  completion  and  at \n\nappraisal, and the estimated civil works cost at appraisal. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank project completion reports and project performance evaluation reports. \n \n3. \nbetween 2000 and 2009. \n\nTable  A6.3  provides  a  summary  of  the  implementation  delays  for  projects  completed \n\n \n\n\f78 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable A6.3: Implementation Delays for ADB-Financed Road Projects in the Lao PDR \n\nLoan No. \n1234 \n1369 \n1533 \n1727 \n1795 \n \n\nProject Name \n\nSixth Road Improvement \nChampasack Road Improvement \nXieng Khouang Road Improvement \nGMS: East\u2013West Economic Corridor  \nRural Access Roads \n \n\nAverage \n\nPlanned Date of \nProject Closure \n30 Jun 1999 \n30 Jun 2000 \n30 Jun 2002 \n31 Dec 2004 \n30 Apr 2005 \n \n\nActual Date of \nProject Closure \n22 Jan 2003 \n26 Jul 2001 \n28 Apr 2006 \n22 Feb 2008 \n9 Apr 2008 \n \n\nImplementation \nDelay  \n(months) \n43 \n13 \n47 \n38 \n36 \n35 \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, GMS = Greater Mekong Subregion, Lao PDR = Lao People's Democratic Republic. \nSource: Asian Development Bank database. \n \n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n79 \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE TRANSPORT SECTOR IN THE LAO PEOPLE'S \nDEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC \n\nTable A7.1: Project Preparatory Technical Assistance in the Transport Sector of the Lao \nPeople's Democratic Republic \n(as of 31 December 2009) \n\nNo. \nA.

In general, most studies1 focused on these \nfunds  as  an  area  of  reform  in  road  management  and  a  likely  solution  to  the  problem  of  road \nmaintenance.  The  studies  identified  common  issues  among  road  funds,  such  as  inadequate \nfunding  for  road  maintenance,  failure  of  the  government  to  provide  for  adequate  budget, \neventual deterioration of road infrastructure, weak road management, and overloading. \n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe  Government  of  the  Lao  PDR  established  the  RMF  on  15  January  2001  through \nPrime  Ministerial  Decree  No.  9.2  Collections  for  the  RMF  began  in  February  2002  and  are \ncurrently  from  a  fuel  levy,  bridge  tolls,  heavy  vehicle  surcharges,  overweight  fines,  and \ninternational  transit  fees.  The  RMF  was  aimed  at  financing  routine  maintenance,  emergency \nand  periodic  maintenance  work,  administration  renewal  works,  road  safety  projects,  and  other \nadministrative costs. \n \n3. \nThe  RMF  is  managed  and  supervised  by  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport \n(MPWT).  Another  decree  was  signed  for  the  creation  of  the  RMF  Advisory  Board,  which  is \ntasked  to  approve  decisions  about  RMF  allocations  with  MPWT.  The  board  consists  of \nmembers  from  the  public  and  private  sectors  appointed  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  MPWT, \nprovincial  authorities,  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry,  road  and  passenger  transport \noperators, and the general public. The chair is nominated by MPWT. \n \nB. \n \n4. \nKey  principles  of  the  Road  Maintenance  Fund.  The  RMF  is  aligned  with  key \nprinciples of road fund management, operating under the context of resource limitations. Vaidya \nand Tusanasorn3 characterized the Lao PDR's creation of the RMF as reflective of the country's \nshift from emphasizing new construction and rehabilitation to maintenance. The RMF adopts the \n\"user's  pay\"  principle,  since  financing  road  maintenance  comes  from  user  charges.  Following \nthe  general  principles  discussed  in  the  World  Bank  studies,4  the  RMF  is  categorized  as  a \nsecond-generation road fund,5 which takes on a commercial approach as it seeks to bring road \nmaintenance to the private sector on a fee-for-service basis, similar to business transactions. \n \n\nFindings from the Literature Review \n\n                                                 \n1  H.

Freeman  (footnote  1);  and  K.  Gwilliam  and  Z.  Shalizi.  1999.  Road  Funds,  User  Charges,  and \n\nTaxes. The World Bank Research Observer. 14 (2).  \n\n5  First-generation  funds  refer  to  the  traditional  or  budget  approach  to  road  maintenance,  which  is  widely  used  in \ndeveloping countries. Road funds under this approach are  allocated as public expenditures to be covered by the \nnational budget. \n\n \n\n\f86 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nSources of revenue. Vaidya and Tusanasorn (footnote 3) reported gaps in local funding \n5. \nsources  and  the  RMF's  failure  to  meet  targeted  revenues.  The  RMF  was  expected  to  be \nsupported mainly by collections from a fuel levy,  with charges to be increased rapidly to meet \nmaintenance  requirements.  While  RMF  revenues  still  grew  because  of  increases  in  other \ncharges,  particularly  from  vehicle  charges,  the  study  observed  that  revenue  targets  would  not \nbe met, as the fuel levy was KN40 per liter in 2004. The levy was increased to KN300 per liter in \n2009.  \n \nIn a World Bank report, Gwilliam6 also claimed that the increased tax rate fell behind the \n6. \noriginal schedule of increases. The rate was still considered low by international standards, as it \nonly constitutes about 2.0%\u20132.5% of the retail price. Other sources of RMF revenue may also \nbe  worth  investigating  to  improve  its  revenues.  In  particular,  there  could  be  some  leaks  and \ninefficiencies  in  collections  of  road  tolls,  unnecessary  spending  on  weighing  equipment  and \nstaffing  costs  being  charged  to  the  RMF  to  enforce  overloading  fines,  and  complex  licensing \nprocedures on  vehicle  registration. Vaidya  and  Tusanasorn  (footnote  3)  expected  that  support \nfrom external sources would likely to continue beyond 2009 to sustain the RMF. \n \n7. \nFinancing  needs.  In  a  2007  study  conducted  by  the  World  Bank  Independent \nEvaluation  Group  on  road  funding  strategies  of  various  countries,7  the  RMF  was  assessed  as \nespecially  successful.  Fund  collections  were  efficiently  allocated  for  road  maintenance.  Using \nthe  percentage  of  estimated  needs  financed  and  changes  in  the  overall  level  of  funding  for \nmaintenance as indicators to assess improvement in the quality of roads, the World Bank study \nobserved  a  significant  increase  in  the  percentage  of  roads  in  good  condition  than  in  most \ncountries. The RMF only covered 40% of its needs, but it was still said to be a \"well-performing \nfund.\"  In  general,  the  World  Bank  study  noted  that  no  road  fund  in  the  countries  surveyed \nmanaged to cover all maintenance funding needs, with the best cases contributing as much as \n75%\u201380% (e.g., Ethiopia and Uganda). It found that about half of the road funds fulfilled half of \nthe  maintenance  needs  of  the  national  network,  and  only  one  third  of  the  road  funds  use  the \nresources exclusively for road maintenance. A 2003 Asian Development Bank (ADB) study8 on \nbest  practices  of  road  funds  also  found  that  a  dedicated  road  fund  typically  contributes  about \n50% of the requirements, depending on its ability to raise revenues. \n \nAllocations  of  the  Road  Maintenance  Fund.  MPWT  reported  that  about  90%  of  the \n8. \nRMF  has  been  given  to  national  roads  and  only  10%  to  local  roads.  If  RMF  revenues  can  be \nincreased,  the  percentage  allocations  provided  to  national  and  provincial  roads  should  be \nexamined as long as this is consistent with the fund\u2019s objective to prioritize road maintenance. \nThe  ADB  study  (footnote  8)  claimed  that  the  RMF  should  not  only  finance  all  maintenance \nworks of the national highway network but also partly provide for lesser roads. \n \n9. \nProvincial  road  maintenance.  Vaidya  and  Tusanasorn  (footnote  3)  emphasized  the \nvery limited  resources provided to road maintenance at the provincial level. In addition, it was \nobserved in the same study that available funds for roads at the provincial level tend to be spent \non  rehabilitation  and  construction  rather  than  on  maintenance.  The  study  suggested  that \nprovinces should be given the option to raise additional revenues, such as through license fees \nfor  vehicles,  to  finance  road  maintenance.  The  establishment  of  provincial  road  maintenance \nfunds managed at the local or provincial levels should be considered with structures similar to \nthe  national  RMF.  Provincial  RMFs  may  include  allocations  for  local  roads  from  the  national \n\n                                                 \n6  K. Gwilliam. 2007. Paving the Road for Better Capacity.

Manila. \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n87 \n\nSupport from Aid Agencies \n\nthe  RMF  reported  some  operational  delays \n\nRMF,  provincial  and  national  budget,  and  donor  support.  Continued  financial  support  from \navailable  sources  would  be  required  to  help  establish  the  provincial  RMFs,  including  the \nrequired institutional structure. \n \nDistrict roads. Gwilliam's report mentioned that the RMF has been struggling to obtain \n10. \nfunds for the routine maintenance of the network (footnote 6). At the district level, the creation of \ncommunity  road  trust  funds  might  address  the  financial  needs  to  rural  road  maintenance.  The \nreport  noted  that  funding  community  roads  and  their  maintenance  should  be  an  area  of \ncontinued support or assistance by multilateral donors. \n \n11. \nAdvisory board and secretariat. The World Bank studies (footnote 4) have argued that \na road fund should have an independent advisory board. The Lao PDR\u2019s RMF Advisory Board \nmay  not  be  fully  independent,  as  it  is  created  as  a  department  in  MPWT,  which  exercises \noversight functions. Moreover, the RMF Advisory Board has limited powers to oversee the RMF, \nthus  diluting  its  role.  Gwilliam  also  found  that  control  over  the  Lao  PDR\u2019s  road  maintenance \nprogram composition and financial allocations remained with the Department of Roads.  \n \n12. \nFurther,  the  RMF  secretariat  is  expected  as  an  organization  to  be  strong,  stable,  and \ncompetent  on  financial  management  procedures.  However,  preliminary  findings  on  the \nperformance  of \nin  revenue  collections, \nimplementation  of  maintenance  works,  and  payments  to  contractors.  These  were  attributed  to \ninadequate technical capacities of the RMF secretariat.  \n \nC. \n \n13. \nThe  main  supporters  of  the  Lao  PDR's  maintenance  activities  have  been  ADB,  Nordic \nDevelopment  Fund,  Swedish  International  Development  Cooperation  Agency  (Sida),  and  the \nWorld  Bank.  The  last  three  have  provided  assistance  in  the  development  of  the  Road \nMaintenance Program.9 The program supported the establishment of a road fund financed from \ngradually  increasing  road  user  charges,  in  particular  a  surcharge  on  fuel.  ADB  supported  the \nsetting up of the RMF and also provided funding for the periodic maintenance.10 \n \nBefore its exit from the Lao PDR, Sida contributed to the development and maintenance \n14. \nof  the  rural  roads  network.  In  its  2004  country  report  (footnote  9),  Sida  supported  the \ngovernment's  move  to  raise  fuel  levies  as  a  means  to  mobilize  resources  for  the  RMF  and  a \nstep  toward  sustaining  the  road  network.  Sida  has  also  provided  assistance  in  capacity \ndevelopment programs for provincial road authorities and promoted the community road model \nas an approach to road maintenance at the district levels (footnote 10). \n \nD. \n \n15. \nNeed  for  further  studies.  An  assessment  on  the  performance  or  effectiveness  of  the \nRMF  remains  largely  inadequate.  While  aggregate  assessments  could  be  drawn  particularly \nfrom  the  World  Bank  and  ADB  studies,  there  has  also  been  a  pervading  view  that  no  single \nmodel  is  the  best;  hence,  road  funds  may  well  be  analyzed  on  a  case-to-case  basis  in \naccordance  with  country  needs.  In  other  words,  the  development  of  road  funds  needs  to  be \n                                                 \n9  Embassy of Sweden. 2005. Sida Country Report 2004.

Most  studies  observed  gaps  in  meeting  the  targeted  revenues  from  local \nsources  and  the  overall  level  of  coverage  of  the  RMF  vis-\u00e0-vis  the  country's  financing  needs. \nThe RMF's allocation formula, which favors national roads, is a matter of concern since it dilutes \nthe resources for provincial, district, and rural roads. \n \nInstitutional. The independence and technical capacity of the RMF secretariat and RMF \n17. \nAdvisory Board were concerns that need to be addressed. Specifically, the creation of the RMF \nunder MPWT could be seen as limiting the powers of the RMF. On the other hand, it could also \nbe  argued  that  locating  the  RMF  outside  of  MPWT  supervision  could  lead  to  coordination \nproblems among rehabilitation and maintenance activities. Finally, the RMF secretariat has also \nbeen found to be wanting in capacities in planning, selection, and prioritization of maintenance \nworks, including monitoring and evaluation of projects. \n \nE. \n \n18. \nIn  conclusion,  the  RMF  has  steadily  improved  its  efficiency  and  effectiveness  since \n2001. However, it has a long way to go before it can be declared a complete success. The RMF \nfollows  the  general  principles  of  the  second-generation  road  funds  established  under  the \nbroader  context  of  road  management  reforms  and  limited  resources.  Its  creation  provides  the \nmechanism by which user charges are pooled to a separate and/or dedicated fund with priority \ngiven  to  road  maintenance.  The  decree  that  established  the  RMF  Advisory  Board  included \nmembers  representing  both  the  public  and  private  sectors.  All  these  aspects  point  to  a  good \nfund structure. However, for this structure to succeed, it needs to receive adequate revenues. \n \n19. \nSignificantly,  some  financial  and  institutional  issues  have  since  affected  the  operations \nand  management  of  the  RMF.  These  weaknesses  were  being  addressed  by  further \nimprovements  in  human  resources,  financial  management,  and  maintenance  procedures, \namong  others.  These  can  be  addressed  through  technical  assistance  for  skills  transfer  and \ninstitutional development. \n \n\nSummary \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n89 \n\nSUMMARY OF THE IMPACTS OF ADB-FUNDED ROAD PROJECTS \n\n \n1. \nThe  sector  assistance  program  evaluation  for  transport  sector  in  the  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic (Lao PDR) included a broad evaluation of the entire portfolio of transport \nprojects  completed  until  date  to  assess  their  visible  impacts.

Thus,  the  project  is  considered  to  have  realized  its  principal \nobjective  of  facilitating  more  efficient  road  transport  for  both  the  main  road  and \nfeeder road traffic. \nThe project generated about 9,020 person-months of employment for both skilled \nand unskilled labor. \nIt spurred savings in vehicle operating costs. \nIt provided agricultural and producer surplus benefits. \nThe  project's  social  and  educational  benefits  improved  access  to  primary  and \nsecondary schools, health care clinics, as well as community stores. \nBicycle access to schools was extended to about 10 kilometers (km), resulting in \nhigher school attendance. \nAdditional school facilities are now being constructed along the road. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n \n\n\f90 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n4. \n \nB. \n \n5. \n \n6. \n\n \n7. \n \nC. \n \n8. \n \n9. \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  The  improved  feeder  roads  increased  intervillage  traffic,  primarily  agricultural \nflows  associated  with  farm-to-market  access.  Vientiane  is  now  perceived  as  a \nmajor market center year-round. \nThere  were  also  slight  increases  in  consumption  of  luxury  items  like  televisions \nand motorcycles, as well as liquor. \nJobs  were  generated  as  more  timber  processing  facilities  opened  (though  this \nwas not mentioned as an environmental impact). \n\n(x) \n\nNo negative impacts were mentioned in the PPER. \n\nSecond Road Improvement Project (Champasack, Pakxong, and Salavan) \n\nThe implementation period was from 1987 to 1996. \n\nIts benefits were as follows. \n(i) \n\nTraffic  volumes  observed  in  1995  were  considerably  higher  than  the  traffic \nforecast  at  appraisal,  while  traffic  composition  was  not  significantly  different, \nexcept  for  trucks.  Thus,  the  project  is  considered  to  have  realized  its  principal \nobjective of facilitating more efficient road transport. \nAbout 18,000 person-months of employment was generated for both skilled and \nunskilled labor. \nVehicle operators emerged as the main beneficiaries of the reduction in vehicle \noperating costs as a result of the improved road sections. \nAccess to health care centers improved. \nPrimary and secondary educational facilities were improved. \nThe numbers of markets and community stores increased.  \nPassenger fares and truck rates indicated that a substantial amount of the initial \nsavings in vehicle operating costs was passed on to road users. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n\nNo negative impacts were mentioned in the project completion report. \n\nThird Road Improvement Project (Vangvieng and Vientiane) \n\nThe implementation period was from 1988 to 1994. \n\nIts benefits were as follows. \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nWith the improved project road, cattle raising, forestry, and logging in Phon Hong \nand Vientiane increased. \nExternal  assistance  for  irrigation,  rural  electrification,  and  forestry  was  set  in \nmotion. \nImprovement of the project road accelerated development of the area, including \nnew gas stations, small service industries, food markets, restaurants, shop-front \nhousing, several new factories, a new vehicle assembly plant, and new housing. \nTourist  attractions  and  accommodations  were  developed  at  km  45  and  in  Phon \nHong. \n(v)  While  paddy \n\nto \nconsiderable tracts of farmland producing two rice crops per year instead of one. \nFish farming has been introduced as has diversification to cattle, goats, tree-type \ncrops, and vegetables. \nAt km 150, the cement factory run under a joint venture consortium between the \ngovernments of the Lao PDR and the People's Republic of China was completed. \n\nfarming  still  predominates, \n\nintroduction  of \n\nirrigation \n\n(iv) \n\n(vi) \n\nled \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n91 \n\nLimestone  rock  is  mined  for  the  factory.

This has enhanced the local tourism \nindustry \ntransport, \nthrough  development  of  accommodations,  restaurants, \ninternet services, and handicrafts. \nThe projects had a positive effect on economic activities in the impact area. The \nfeasibility study observed that only few cash crops were grown in 1987. In 2001, \nall  villages  visited  by  the  independent  evaluation  mission  reported  a  variety  of \nincome  sources,  including  vegetables,  papyrus-type  grass  (i.e.,  paper  mulberry \ntree  or  broussenetia)  that  local  enterprises  use  for  papermaking  in  the \nLouangphrabang area and export to Thailand, and fishponds.

This  was,  in  part,  anticipated  at  appraisal,  but  the \nchosen road alignment was selected as the best possible least-cost option. Other \nchoices  would  have  caused  fewer  landslides  but  would  have  required  more \nearthworks during construction, resulting in even more negative impacts. \nOther  environmental  impacts  were  increased  logging  and  \u201cslash-and-burn\u201d \nagriculture.4 \nAn associated technical assistance (Road Infrastructure for Rural Development) \ncited  in  the  PPER  concluded  that  environmental  impacts  from  logging  and \nin \ntrafficking  of  wildlife  and  plants  will  not  result \nLouangphrabang and Vientiane provinces. \n\nfrom  road  projects \n\nSixth Road Improvement Project (Attapeu, Champasack, and Xekong) \n\nThe implementation period was from 1993 to 1999. \n\nThe project's environmental and socioeconomic impacts were as follows. \n(i) \n\nThe  main  component  of  the  project\u2014improvement  of  provincial  roads\u2014was \nprimarily  located  in  sparsely  populated  areas  and  generally  followed  existing \nalignments. As such, land acquisition for right of way, resettlement problems, and \nchanges  in  land-use  patterns  were  minimal.  Tree  cutting  to  widen  the  project \nroads had a moderately negative effect on the environment. \nOn  the  other  hand,  the  strengthening,  paving,  and  widening  of  the  roads,  and \nraising the embankments with proper culverts and bridges and channel treatments \nhas helped improve the environment in the project area. The smooth surface of the \nimproved  roads  requires  less  traction  power,  consumes  less  fuel,  and  results  in \nless air pollution. Further, the smooth flow of traffic results in less noise. \nBased  on  observations  in  the  project  area,  there  is  evidence  of  significant \ndevelopment  activity  along  the  project  roads.  Activities  expected  at  appraisal \nsuch  as  coffee  production  and  increased  coffee  yields,  livestock  development, \nand  expansion  of  the  electricity  grid  has  gone  forward.  Overall  environmental, \nsociocultural, and other development impacts are significant. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n13. \n\n \nE. \n \n14. \n \n15. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB.  2001.

New  industries  include  a  concrete  plant,  import\u2013\nexport businesses, and a new plywood factory. Due to the increasing volume of \ntraffic,  several  villages  along  National  Road  13  have  also  grown  considerably. \nSurveys showed that several village shops enjoy more business, and the tourist \nresorts  in  the  area  have  benefited  from  the  influx  of  domestic  and  international \ntourists since the road was improved. \nImproved  access  to  social  services  and  to  markets  was  noted  in  the  PPER6  as \nwell as an increase in tourism. \nThe  PPER  also  noted  that  the  road  has  reduced  travel  by  villagers  because \ntraders come to the village to buy and sell. \nAccess to social services and markets have improved due to reduced transit time \nbetween  communities.  Travel  time  savings  have  not  been  estimated  for \nreevaluation, as it was not calculated at the appraisal stage. A survey conducted \namong local people suggested that travel times had been reduced by more than \nhalf, however. \nThe  PPER  cited  conclusions  of  a  separate  study  that  the  road  benefits  only \nnonpoor.7 \nAlso, the PPER noted that negative environmental impacts resulted from damage \nand lack of clean-up during road construction and the excessive cutting of forests \nat  km  26.  According  to  the  PPER,  the  International  Union  for  Conservation  of \nNature complained publicly on the latter. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nXieng Khouang Road Improvement Project \n\nThe implementation period was from 1998 to 2002. \n\nThe project impacts were as follows. \n(i) \n\nThe main impact of the project as envisaged at appraisal was to promote national \nand  provincial  economic  growth.  The  provincial  annual  gross  domestic  product \ngrowth rate in the project area prior to the project was about 5%. Annual growth \nduring 1998\u20132003 was 6% and during 2003\u20132005 around 7%. \nThe incidence of poverty in the project area declined from 49% in 2000 to about \n30% in 2005.8 \n\n(ii) \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2001.

The number \nof  secondary  schools  in  the  project  area  increased  from  38  in  2000  to  259  in \n2005. There is also a number of new hotels in Phonsavan. \nElectricity  is  now  available  to  many  residents  on  National  Road  7  due  to  the \ninfrastructure  provided  by  Electricit\u00e9  du  Lao.  Income  per  capita  in  the  project \narea increased from $263 in 2000 to $360 in 2005. \nAn environmental management plan was not done prior to the commencement of \nthe project, and it was not until problems were encountered later that mitigations \nwere  implemented,  but  only  very  slowly  according  to  the  PCR.9  Implementation \nof the plan was finally completed, except for tree planting, which was canceled by \nthe  Embassy  of  Japan  and  characterized  in  the  PCR  as  mainly  a  road \nbeautification component, and not necessary for strictly environmental reasons. \n\nEast\u2013West Corridor Project (Savannakhet) \n\nThe implementation period was from 2000 to 2004. \n\n \nH. \n \n20. \n \nThe  PPER10  reported  that  the  project  opened  up  markets  and  enhanced  consumer \n21. \nchoices  through  (i)  cheaper  prices,  and  (ii)  product  availability  and  diversity.  Improved \nconnectivity along the corridor also helped form surplus areas of production, which resulted in \nchanges  in  the  livelihood  and  living  standards  of  local  residents.  Overall,  the  project  made \nsubstantial positive contributions within the impact area. \n \n22. \nThough the project impact varied according to household resources, large-scale farmers \nand  cross-border  traders  experienced  the  highest  sales  and  income  increases.  Some  shifting \ncultivators,  who  adopted  sedentary  farming  systems  using  new  technologies,  reported  a \n10%\u221220% increase in income. \n \nEnvironmental and social concerns were incorporated in the project design through the \n23. \ninclusion  of  mitigation  measures.  These  measures  included  implementation  of  specific \nsafeguards  to  address  issues  such  as  the  spread  of  sexually  transmitted  infections  and \nHIV/AIDS during construction. \n \n24. \nOn  the  Lao  PDR  side,  the  project  did  not  create  any  serious  adverse  environmental \nimpacts.  But  some  agriculture  or  productive  land  was  lost  to  residential  or  industrial \ndevelopment, and sustaining forest conservation was a matter of concern. \n \nIn  2006,  regional  technical  assistance11  was  funded  by  ADB  to  examine  the  impact  on \n25. \npoverty of regional economic integration (REI), and the National Economic Research Institute of \nthe  Lao  PDR  looked  closely  at  the  impacts  around  the  border  crossing  point  at  Dansavan.  A \nconsultant report on the research methodology noted that  \n\nAlthough it was not my purpose to become too involved with the content, it is fair to say \nthat  local  communities  in  the  near  vicinity  of  border  crossing  points  do  not  currently \nbenefit from REI in the form of improved roads and transportation, and in most cases are \nnegatively  impacted  and  impoverished  by  having  their  land  and  natural  resources \n\n                                                 \n9  ADB.  2006.

Governments  do  not  understand  local  communities \nand local livelihood systems and do not currently possess the means of doing so. Thus, \nproviding  mitigations  and  viable  solutions  to  negative  impacts  will  not  happen  through \nany  planning  process  at  the  present  time  and  in  the  near  future.  Positive  actions  are \nthose that local villagers have developed on their own and remain in the domain of the \ninformal  sector.  And  these  may  or  may  not  be  in  accord  with  what  is considered  to  be \n\u201clegal\u201d since in many instances official policies have outlawed traditional livelihoods and \nhave made it impossible to be legitimate and at the same time to survive.12 \n\n \n26. \nThe  National  Economic  Research  Institute  remarked  that  the  markets  at  Dansavan  on \nthe Lao PDR side are dominated by Vietnamese traders, with little or no Lao PDR participation. \nIt indicated that REI thinking has downplayed the asymmetrical relationships between countries \nand has no safeguards in place to help balance out the lack of equity. The same conditions are \nseen at Boten on the border with the People's Republic of China, where markets are dominated \nby  the  Chinese.  Thus,  without  additional  assistance,  the  Lao  PDR  might  not  realize  projected \neconomic benefits.  \n \nI. \n \n27. \n \n28. \n \n\nRural Access Roads Project (Attapeu, Houaphan, and Vientiane) \n\nThe implementation period was from 2001 to 2006. \n\nThe project locations are outlined in Table A10.2. \n\nTable A10.2: Locations of Rural Roads \n\nSection \nAttapeu\u2013Senamnoy \nNasak\u2013Khockhaodo  \nThongkoun\u2013Longxan \nHuayhung\u2013Xam Tai \nSource:  Asian Development Bank. 2009.

The  other  two  consist  of  a  strategic  road  with  a \nnational  security  function  (C2)  and  the  completion  of  a  national  highway  linking  two  inland \nprovincial capitals (C1).  \n \n30. \nIn  Houaphan  (C4),  a  component  consisting  of  three  feeder  roads  was  added  to \ncomplement  United  Nations  Drug  Control  Programme  (United  Nations  Office  on  Drugs  and \nCrime) and government plans to eradicate opium. It was determined that because livelihoods of \nminorities  would  be  affected  through  loss  of  opium  sales,  ethnic  minority  development  plans \nwould be necessary for each feeder road. \n \nYet for the main roads of the project, a separate ethnic minority development plan was \n31. \nnot required because (i) most of the ethnic minorities were integrated into the wider community; \n(ii)  project  impacts  related  mainly  to  resettlement,  and  the  project  included  specific  actions  for \nethnic minorities; and (iii) significant economic benefits from improved access were expected for \nall populations within the project zone of influence. \n                                                 \n12 Joint  Research  Center.  2006.

Subsequent projects \nsuch as the Xieng Khouang Road \nImprovement Project have included \ncapacity building at the provincial level. \n\nWork in progress.  \n\nThird Road \nImprovement Project \n\nADB should monitor annual traffic counts on \nall project roads. Traffic counts should be \nscheduled for early November, prior to the \nonset of the country's main harvesting \nseason. \n \n(PPAR 1997) \nADB should continue to support road \nimprovement projects but should (i) ensure \nthat progress on civil works is monitored and \nstays within the project's design \nspecifications; and (ii) specify, in accordance \nwith accepted international benchmark \nstandards, the finishing characteristics to \nwhich road pavement construction and \nimprovements are expected to be built. \n \nThe government should ensure that reforms \naimed at developing administrative and \ntechnical competencies and accountability at \nthe central level are also transferred to the \nprovincial and district levels. Reforms should \ninclude a commitment from the government \nand provincial administrators to enter into \ntimely and obligatory contract payments. \n \nStudies were be initiated for cost recovery on \nenforcement, capital, and maintenance costs \nassociated with overloading; and ongoing \nsupport of commercial finance mechanisms \nto address construction and maintenance \nenterprise needs for equipment purchases. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fProject  \n \n\nActions Completed \n\n \n\n98 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nFourth Road \nImprovement Project \nand Fifth Road \nImprovement  \n\nChampasack Road \nImprovement Project \n\n \n\n \n\nProject Performance Evaluation Report \nRecommendations for \nFollow-Up Actions \n\nMPWT, the EA, was encouraged to take \nmeasures to ensure that drainage \nobstructions are routinely cleared and that \nplatforms erected across main side drains do \nnot interfere with drainage design provisions. \n \nMPWT was also encouraged to place \nincreased routine maintenance along the \nproject road, and to promote additional \ntraining to technical staff and administrators. \n \n(PPER 2001) \nRepairs on major road damages need to be \nimplemented before the next rainy season \nwhen some of the road sections risk being \nwashed out further.   \n\n \n\nArrangements should be made to ensure that \nroutine maintenance is undertaken along the \nentire length of ADB4 and ADB5. The EA \nmay engage small contractors to cover areas \nbeyond the reach of villages that otherwise \nundertake routine maintenance activities.  \n \nThe EA should expand the road markings, \nparticularly on dangerous curves, to increase \nroad security. Some initiatives to set up road \nsigns have been taken, but have to continue \nto cover all road sections in need of \nmarkings.  \n \n(PPER 2005) \nADB should work within the GMS Program to \nencourage successful completion of the \nborder negotiations between the Lao PDR \nand Cambodia. This will enable MCTPC to \ncomplete the construction of the 6.9-\nkilometer link from the end of the project road \n(near the Veun Kham intersection) to the \nCambodian border post to enable \nuninterrupted access from Champasack \nProvince to towns in Cambodia. Subject to \nthe resolution of these negotiations, activities \nleading up to the development of this link \ncould be initiated to enable the completion of \nthe road in time for the 2007 implementation \nof the GMS agreement. ADB should explore \npossible ways of including this link road in \nongoing or future projects in the country. \n \nMCTPC should develop a modern road \nmaintenance planning system. Such capacity \nbuilding should be undertaken at the junior \nmanagement level to ensure that a trained \nworkforce is created for updating and running \nmodels such as the Highway Design and \nMaintenance Standards Model. Such needs \ncould be addressed within the World Bank's \nRoad Maintenance Program 2.

Policies and laws have been crafted to address the need for environmental protection \nand management. Since 1999, the Environmental Protection Law has been the central piece of \nlegislation and main instrument for environmental protection and management in the Lao PDR. \nFurther,  Environmental  Assessment  Regulations  (1770/STEA  2000)  were  issued  and  have \ndefined \nimpact  assessments  of \ndevelopment  projects.  In  addition,  the  Road  Law  (1999)  requires  that  road  construction  be \nundertaken in accordance with public safety and environmental protection considerations. \n \n2. \nSubsequent  regulations  were  issued  in  2003  by  the  Ministry  of  Communication, \nTransport,  Post,  and  Construction  for  the  environmental  impact  assessments  of  road  projects \n(Decree  2929/MCTPC),  including  provisions  on  screening,  scoping,  public  involvement, \nenvironmental management plan and implementation, content, review, and approval. Similarly, \nimportance was also given to social safeguards. A Prime Minister's decree (192/PM 2005) and \nregulations concerning compensation and resettlement of development projects, issued in 2005, \ndefine  the  principles,  rules,  and  measures  to  mitigate  adverse  social  impacts  and  to \ncompensate  for  damages  resulting  from  involuntary  acquisition  or  repossession  of  land  and \nassets. Also included were articles specific to concerns on ethnic minority groups requiring the \npreparation of a development plan if necessary. \n \nRecently,  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport  (MPWT)  has  moved  further  to \n3. \nstrengthen  its  commitment  to  incorporating  environmental  and  social  considerations  in  road \nprojects  through  the  release  of  its  2008  Environmental  and  Social  Operations  Manual.  This \nmanual serves as a reference point for harmonizing the law and regulations of the Lao PDR with \nthe  requirements  of  project  donors  and  development  partners.  It  acknowledges  the  need  to \naddress  safeguard  policies  of  project  donors  and  development  partners,  including  the  three \nsafeguard  policies  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  It  advocates  the  general  principle  of \nsafeguard  assessment  and  echoes  the  objectives  of  ADB  safeguard  policies,  that  is,  to  avoid, \nminimize,  or  mitigate  harmful  environmental  impact,  social  costs,  and  marginalization  of \nvulnerable groups that may result from development projects. The manual will be approved after \nits pilot testing in some selected provinces. \n \nFull implementation of the Environmental and Social Operations Manual means there are \n4. \nsufficient  regulations  in  the  Lao  PDR  to  require  the  necessary  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards during project preparation and implementation. These regulations are in line with the \nsafeguard  policies  of  project  donors  and  development  partners,  including  ADB,  Swedish \n(Sida),  United  Nations  Development \nInternational  Development  Cooperation  Agency \nProgramme  (UNDP),  and  World  Bank.  It  takes  into  account  safeguard  policies  commonly \ntriggered in road projects such as those related to environmental impact assessments, natural \nhabitats, forestry, indigenous peoples, involuntary resettlement, and cultural property. \n \n5. \nAlthough  there  is  good  policy  support,  the  institutional  capacity  of  the  Department  of \nRoads, within MPWT, to enforce safeguard requirements and to monitor their implementation is \nquestionable.  The  recent  reorganization  within  MPWT  has \nthe \ninstitutional  capacity  of  the  Department  of  Roads.  The  newly  created  Environmental  and \nTechnical  Division  (ETD),  which  merged  the  former  Environment  and  Social  Division  with  the \nPlanning  and  Technical  Division,  is  tasked  with  mainstreaming  the  social  and  environmental \n\ntemporarily  weakened \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n101 \n\naspects in the road subsector. During reorganization, staff specialists of the former Environment \nand Social Division were transferred to MPWT\u2019s Public Transport Institute as a new unit that will \nhandle policy-level work for the entire ministry. This move left ETD without any staff members \nwho have the necessary skills for safeguard work. \n \n6. \nRestoring  ETD\u2019s  capacity  is  an  urgent  task  for  the  government.  In  the  past,  ADB  has \nprovided assistance to the Lao PDR for capacity building, specifically regarding safeguards. As \nreflected  in  the  recent  country  strategy  and  program,1  support  for  building  capacity  to \nincorporate  environmental  considerations  into  development  planning  is  a  key  focus  area  for \nenvironmental initiatives. The country strategy and program also indicates that ADB will provide \nsupport  to  mitigate  potential  negative  social  impacts  arising  from  road  development,  such  as \ntrafficking  of  drugs  and  humans,  transmission  of  HIV/AIDS,  and  other  sexually  transmitted \ninfections.  However,  the  country  strategy  and  program  needs  to  be  backed  up  by  specific \nassistance.  On  the  MPWT  side,  its  institutional  capacity  needs  to  be  sustained  to  ensure  the \neffectiveness of external assistance. \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\fMANAGEMENT RESPONSE TO THE SECTOR ASSISTANCE PROGRAM EVALUATION \nFOR THE TRANSPORT SECTOR IN THE LAO PEOPLE\u2019S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC \n\n \n \n \n\nOn  8  November  2010,  the  Director  General,  Independent  Evaluation  Department, \nreceived the following response from the Managing Director General on behalf of Management: \n \n \n\nGeneral Comments \n\nI. \n \n1. \nWe  appreciate  the  IED  report  and  its  comprehensive  analysis  of  ADB\u2019s \nassistance  in  the  transport  sector.  We  concur  with  the  overall  assessment  that \nADB\u2019s  program  has  been  successful  and  that  ADB\u2019s  performance  in  the  sector \nhas overall been satisfactory. \n \n2. \nBefore  responding  to  the  specific  recommendations,  we  note  that  the \nreport would benefit from some clarifications. First, the characterization of ADB\u2019s \nprogramming in the sector as \u201cdisconnected\u201d (para. 73) is misleading. The report \nacknowledges  that  the  transport  sector  faces  funding  constraints  due  to  the \ncountry-level  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  allocation.  Accessing  the  ADF \nsubregional allocation pool to finance transport projects that support subregional \ncooperation does not crowd out national transport projects; in fact, because Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) is a land-locked country, many of the \nroads  improved  through  the  subregional  allocation  are  national  roads.  Second, \nwhile  the  report  indicates  that  the  quality  of  design  and  monitoring  frameworks \ncan  be  improved  and  acknowledges  efforts  to  improve  the  quality  of  these \nframeworks (para. 82), the report does not acknowledge that these efforts have \nresulted in substantive quality improvements. Third, we are concerned about the \nassessment that the efficiency of ADB\u2019s assistance has deteriorated since 2006, \nand  is  rated  as  less  efficient  based  on  the  performance  of  five  road  projects \ncompleted between 2000 and 2009 (paras. 85 & 86). While describing the same \nconcerns  over  delays  and  cost  overruns,  the  Country  Assistance  Program \nEvaluation  (CAPE)  (para.  43)  rates  nine  out  of  10  completed  road  projects  as \nefficient as reflected in economic internal rates of return (EIRRs). While the report \nattributes \n(i.e., \nimplementation  efficiency),  it  appears  that  the  performance  of  one  project  has \npulled down the average. \n \nII. \n \nthe \n3. \ngovernment  in  the  development  of  integrated  capacity-building  programs \n(instead  of  one-off  TA)  in  specific  areas.  We  agree.  We  are  currently \npreparing  support  for  an  integrated  capacity-building  program  as  a  core \ncomponent of the proposed Southern Link Transport Project, which is scheduled \nfor  Board  consideration  in  2012.  The  proposed  2011  project  preparatory  TA  for \nthis Project will help to develop a multi-year capacity building program, which will \ninclude  support  for:  (i)  planning  and  prioritizing  of  road  improvements;  (ii) \nstrengthening the institutional arrangements and performance standards for road \nmaintenance;  (iii)  implementing  environmental  and  social  safeguards;  and  (iv) \nmonitoring  implementation.  This  capacity  building  program  will  be  designed  to \n\nRecommendation  1:  Capacity  Development \n\nComments on Specific Recommendations \n\ninclusion  of  a  new  criterion \n\nthis  downgrading \n\n-  Support \n\nthe \n\nto \n\n\f 2\n\n- \n\n2: \n\nfilters \n\nRecommendation \n\nProject-readiness \n\nattract additional grant co-financing from development partners, which will further \nstrengthen capacity development. \n \n4. \nImprove \nimplementation  performance  of  ADB  transport  projects  by  mainstreaming \nproject-readiness filters to assess the institutional preparedness within the \ngovernment for implementing a new project. We agree. The project readiness \nfilters developed by the Lao Resident Mission (LRM) will be further improved in \n2011  by:  (i)  incorporating  requirements  under  the  Streamlined  Business \nProcesses; (ii) making them more specific and relevant to transport projects; and \n(iii)  including  institutional  capacity  criteria.  To  mainstream  these  filters,  the \nupcoming Country Partnership Strategy to be finalized in 2011 will refer to their \nusefulness and application. \n \nin \n5. \nconjunction  with \nimprove  development  agency \ncoordination  in  the  areas  of  knowledge  sharing  and  implementation \nmonitoring.  We  agree.  The  creation  of  a  Transport  Sector  Working  Group \n(TSWG)  has  been  discussed  with  the  Government  as  a  means  to  promote \ngreater  coordination  among  development  agencies  and  the  Government  in \nknowledge  management  and  implementation  monitoring.  The  TSWG  will  be \nestablished in 2011, and will first focus on: (i) sharing of knowledge regarding the \ntransport sector; and (ii) monitoring project implementation. The TSWG will have \nquarterly  meetings  that  will  include  the  participation  of  LRM  and  other \ndevelopment  agency  staff  based  in  Vientiane.  As  recommended  in  the  IED \nreport, the annual multipartite meeting will include ADB staff from headquarters. \n \n\nRecommendation  3:  Coordination  of  assistance \n\nthe  government \n\n-  Work \n\nto \n\n\fThere  was  solid  progress  in  rural  electrification.

Members also inquired as to how ADB has addressed \nissues on road maintenance and road safety that were raised in previous CAPEs. \n \n2. \nDirector, SETU described how the focus in the past was on national roads to meet the \nGovernment\u2019s priority to emphasize international linkage and in the future there will be projects \nfor  rural  roads.  On  road  maintenance,  he  noted  that  capacity  building  programs  have  been \nimplemented  with  the  objective  of  delegating  road  maintenance  to  provincial  governments. \nFurther,  in  road  projects  since  2007  road  safety  aspects  have  been  built  in  as  project \ncomponents. Road safety is important not only to ADB, but also to co-financiers. \n \nConclusions \n \n3. \nDEC  members  noted  with  satisfaction  the  steady  progress  made  by  LAO  PDR.  The \nCountry  grew  at  a  compounded  rate  of  7%  per  year  during  2000-2009,  reduced  its  external \npublic debt as a proportion of GDP from 80% in 2005 to 54% in 2009. \n \n4. \nrapidly from 17% of households in 1995 to more than 60% in 2009. \n \n5. \non its way to achieve its ambition of becoming the regional power battery. \n \n6. \nMembers expressed their satisfaction that certain facilitating laws, like water and water \nresources  law,  environmental  protection  law,  environmental  and  social  sustainability  of  the \nhydropower sector law, and amendment of the environmental protection law, were under way. \n \n7. \nMembers also noted that Nam Theun 2 has been successfully completed and sufficient \nprogress has been made in implementing environment and social safeguards. It is now a world-\nclass hydropower plant.    \n \n8. \nMembers noted that the road network has increased by 78% over the last decade, from \n20,000  kilometers  in  1997  to  35,558  kilometers  in  2009.  Roads  have  had  positive  impact  in \nameliorating rural poverty.    \n \n9. \nMembers underlined the need for improving implementation of projects and reducing the \nlarge delays observed in the past. There was a need for improving coordination, strengthening \nthe LRM, and having a medium to long-term strategy based on policies and programs in various \nsectors. Furthermore, members noted that given the importance of hydroelectric power in Lao \nPDR  and  that  hydroelectric  power  is  a  renewable  energy  source,  ADB,  including  through  the \nprivate sector, should remain engaged in the upstream generation projects. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n        (signed) \n \n \nAshok K.
