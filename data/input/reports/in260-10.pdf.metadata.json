ADB assistance \namounted  to  $406  million  between  1983  and  2009,  which  forms  about  45%  of  the  total \ncontribution by the major development agencies working in the Lao PDR transport sector. ADB \nhas  the  opportunity  to  facilitate  further  improvements  in  the  development  effectiveness  of \ntransport assistance in the country. \n \nAs  an  input  to  the  country  assistance  program  evaluation,  this  sector  assistance \nprogram evaluation (SAPE) assesses the performance of ADB\u2019s assistance between 2000 and \n2009 to the Lao PDR transport sector. More specifically, the SAPE examines the effectiveness \nof  ADB-funded  projects  in  achieving  their  development  objectives  and  assesses  their \ncontribution to human development impacts. It identifies lessons for further development of \ntransport sector assistance in the country. The transport sector analysis focuses mainly on the \nroad subsector, since ADB\u2019s transport operations have been in this subsector only during the \nperiod of evaluation. \n \nAs  of  December  2009,  ADB  approved  14  loans  totaling  $363  million,  32  technical \nassistance (TA) projects totaling $16 million, and 1 grant worth $27 million. Out of this, the civil \naviation  subsector  received  one  loan  of  $15  million,  while  the  tourism  subsector  received \nanother  loan  for  $11  million,  which  included  rehabilitation  of  roads  connecting  tourist \ndestinations. \n \nADB\u2019s  program  can  be  broadly  divided  into  two  categories  based  on  the  mode  of \nlending\u2014(i)  the  Lao  PDR  country  program  that  has  supported  various  levels  of  road \nimprovements from national roads to rural roads contributing to the growth of the domestic \neconomy, and (ii) the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) regional program that has supported \nmainly  regional  roads  (national  roads  or  highways)  connecting  the  international  borders \ncontributing mainly to the growth in international trade. This document refers to the country \nprogram and GMS regional program separately to highlight the need for ADB to continue and \nscale-up assistance for improvement of provincial and rural roads, which typically forms part of \nthe country program. \n \nTransport Sector Context \n \nBeing  a  landlocked  country,  the  Lao  PDR  depends  heavily  on  road  transport  for \neconomic development. The increase in the road network has been accompanied by an even \nfaster growth in the number of vehicles across the country. However, remote areas still have low \ntraffic density due to the low level of their economic activities. The Ministry of Public Works and \nTransport (MPWT) is the national government agency primarily responsible for expansion and \nmaintenance of the transport infrastructure in the country. \n \nThe Lao PDR's development plans have consistently supported the expansion of the \nroad network but have also recognized the limitations imposed by funding constraints. In recent \nyears,  regional  connectivity  has  been  emphasized.  MPWT's  multicriteria  mechanism  for \nprioritizing projects gives more weight to funding regional projects connecting the international \nborders than the projects providing access to remote areas within the country. In response, \nADB's strategy has evolved to focus more on regional roads (through the GMS Program) to \nimprove connectivity with neighboring countries. While there has been a growing awareness ", "ii   \nwithin the government of the need to ensure the sustainability of projects, what ADB will do in \nthis area has not been clearly identified. \n \nADB's investment in rural roads is not only through its transport sector portfolio but also \nthrough its agriculture and rural development lending window. ADB\u2019s completed and ongoing \nassistance has contributed to the improvement of about 796 kilometers of such roads in the Lao \nPDR. While the quality of outputs has generally been satisfactory, there is inadequate capacity \nat the provincial level to implement these projects.  \n \nProgram Implementation \n \nAll ADB transport sector projects in the Lao PDR faced delays, ranging from 13 months \nto 47 months. Initial delays were attributed to late engagement of consultants, slow mobilization \nof  equipment,  design  changes  and/or  additional  work,  and  the  prolonged  and  tedious \nprocurement process of the government. To address these problems, ADB allowed advance \nprocurement from 1993, which reduced the start-up problems. However, implementation was \ndelayed in subsequent projects due to the insufficient capacity of the executing agency in \nproject  administration  and  in  implementing  ADB  procedures,  delays  in  mobilization  of  the \nrequired implementation structure, delays in counterpart funding, delays in preparation of tender \ndocuments, and contractor problems. Other factors that affected the completion of civil works \ninclude difficult physical conditions such as massive landslides (e.g., Fourth Road Improvement \nProject) and discoveries of deeply buried unexploded ordnances (e.g., East\u2013West Corridor \nProject). \n \nThe Lao PDR has been able to encourage growth of private contracting firms, some of \nwhich have emerged from former state-owned enterprises. However, most of these national \nfirms lack experience in technical and commercial aspects. The issue of poor performance of \nthe national contractors has been seen on the Rural Access Roads Project and the Roads for \nRural Development Project. \n \nEvaluation of the Assistance \n \nStrategic  positioning.  This  is  satisfactory,  taking  into  consideration  the  regional \nprojects,  upcoming  country  program,  and  the  integrated  agriculture  and  rural  development \nprogram. However, allocation of funding can be improved. Given the funding constraints in the \nLao PDR, ADB's country strategy and program has applied selectivity in its programming. The \ntransport sector program is inclined toward regional cooperation, in line with the government\u2019s \ndevelopment plans. As a result, there has been limited incremental allocation for the country \nprogram. The last transport project approved for the country program was in 2004. ADB is now \nplanning a new project within the country program for approval in 2012. While this indicates a \nlong gap in assistance, it needs to be noted that a GMS project was approved in 2007 for \nrehabilitating the roads in northern Lao PDR. However, the long gap in the country program has \ncreated a disconnect between the actual assistance (i.e., regional cooperation projects) and the \nsector road map, which is relatively inward looking (e.g., provinces without all-weather road \naccess, paved roads in general, and increase in maintenance funding). As per the current \nprogram, the Lao PDR has been provided a biennial allocation of $150.56 million for 2009\u2013\n2010, which includes adjustment in response to the global economic crisis. The relatively small \nsize of this assistance indicates the funding constraints faced by the transport sector. \n ", "  iii\nADB has adopted an integrated approach for designing agriculture projects, combining \nrural roads with agriculture sector interventions. This should be continued, but the planning and \nimplementation can be improved by incorporating several factors mentioned in this report. \n \nRelevance. The transport sector assistance for the Lao PDR is relevant based on (i) the \ndegree to which ADB assistance was consistent with the country needs and ADB's strategic \npriorities,  (ii)  the  quality-at-entry  of  the  country  partnership  strategies  and  program,  and \n(iii) coordination with development partners. ADB's program has been consistent with the Lao \nPDR's socioeconomic development plans. However, the thrust of ADB's assistance for 2006\u2013\n2010 was on regional projects, and no new assistance was approved for the Lao PDR's country \nprogram. Further, ADB-funded projects have typically been geographically dispersed in various \nparts of the country, affecting the implementation efficiency as well as the attribution of their \nimpacts.  ADB's  transport  sector  program  has  generally  been  coordinated  with  other \ndevelopment partners but this can be further improved. Finally, the quality of the project design \nframeworks in the past reports and recommendation of the President and project completion \nreports needed strengthening, especially in relation to the indicators for outcomes and impacts. \nSince 2009, they have shown improvement. \n \nEfficiency. ADB assistance is less efficient based on the economic analysis and the \nimplementation performance of the transport projects. Based on the economic internal rate of \nreturn criterion alone, out of the 5 completed ADB road projects between 2000 and 2009, 1 was \nfound to be highly efficient, 3 were efficient, and 1 was less efficient as reported in previous \nevaluation reports. Two of these projects were self-evaluated. The efficiency ratings of the first \nfour projects did not consider their implementation performance in the rating although these \nprojects also had implementation issues. The inclusion of the implementation efficiency as the \ncriterion has resulted in a lower performance rating. The recently completed Rural Access \nRoads Project was found to be less efficient, owing to a combination of low economic benefits \naccrued and implementation efficiency issues. The lower economic viability of rural roads and, \nto a certain extent, of regional roads is not unexpected but could improve later with change in \neconomic conditions after the intervention. Generally, overall transport sector efficiency has \nbeen  affected  by  poor  implementation  performance  characterized  by  substantial  delays \n(average 35 months) and cost overruns (average 13%) for projects completed between 2000 \nand 2009. Finally, the use of loan savings for funding additional works needs to be justified in \nterms of adequate due diligence at the time of utilization and at the project completion stage. \n \nEffectiveness.  ADB  assistance  is  effective,  based  on  the  extent  to  which  ADB's \nprogram  achieved  sector-specific  outcomes  and  institutional  development  outcomes.  The \ngovernment and its development partners have been contributing to road network expansion \nand improvement of the connectivity. Typically, the majority of the outputs from road subsector \nprojects in the Lao PDR can be summarized in terms of physical accomplishments, such as the \nlength of roads improved or constructed and numbers of bridges improved or built. Projects \nhave also contributed to all-weather connectivity in southern and western parts of the country. \nThe most recently completed project, the GMS: Northern Economic Corridor Project, links the \nPeople's  Republic  of  China  with  Thailand  via  the  Lao  PDR's  Louang  Namtha  Province. \nAssistance for periodic maintenance of roads has been difficult to assess since ADB funding \nwas fungible. \n \nADB has provided effective support for institutional development, but some areas need \nto be improved. ADB's efforts need to focus on the core areas of safeguard implementation, \nrural road network expansion, and maintenance planning and funding. MPWT's current draft \ntransport sector strategy also advocates this institutional strengthening. \n ", "iv   \n \nSustainability. Overall, ADB assistance to the Lao PDR transport sector is likely to be \nsustainable based on an assessment of government's financing of recurrent costs, cost recovery \nof the projects, institutional arrangements, and the past experience of road maintenance in the \ncountry. The maintenance of national roads and highways in the Lao PDR is funded from the \nRoad Maintenance Fund, which allocates 90% of its revenues to national roads. Based on the \nrevenue growth estimated by MPWT, this fund is expected to be self-sufficient in the medium \nterm.  However,  this  will  depend  on  a  large  increase  in  the  fuel  levy,  which  has  political \nramifications. In view of the assurances provided by MPWT for continued rise of this levy in the \nfuture and the demonstrated fuel levy increases in the past, ADB assistance for the national roads \nprogram is rated likely to be sustainable. However, the funds allocated for provincial, district, and \nrural  roads  continue  to  remain  short  of  the  requirements.  This  has  increased  the  risk  of \ndeterioration  of  recently  rehabilitated  roads.  With  the  low  demand  in  the  form  of  traffic, \nmaintenance of those roads remains low in the order of funding priority. In view of this, ADB \nassistance for rural roads is less likely to be sustainable, unless the government sets up a \nmechanism to address this issue. \n \nImpacts. The contribution of ADB\u2019s assistance to development impacts in the transport \nsector is rated substantial. This assessment measures the extent to which ADB's cumulative \ninterventions contributed to the Lao PDR's long-term development results. These impacts are \nassessed across ADB's portfolio in the following key thematic areas: poverty reduction, impact on \ntrade and tourism, impact on health, vehicle overloading and safety, agricultural development, \nenvironmental impact, and impact on ethnic people (or indigenous peoples, as described in ADB\u2019s \nSafeguards  Policy  Statement).  This  assessment  has  highlighted  the  need  for  setting  up \nappropriate impact assessment tools to capture post-project impacts. An important area that ADB \nneeds to monitor is the differential impacts of the transport projects among ethnic communities. \n \nTwo conclusions are intuitive to the Lao PDR's context: (i) more time is needed for \nproject benefits to be captured by the residents in rural areas; and (ii) other interventions are \nessential for economic benefits to be captured by the population, such as improvement in \npolicies for land allocation, village consolidation, opium cultivation eradication, and eradication \nof swidden cultivation; agriculture development in terms of improvement of quantity, quality, and \ndiversity of crops; encouragement of crop substitution; and provision of health and education \nservices. The Lao PDR\u2019s transport sector is susceptible to adverse impacts on environment and \nethnic people, as highlighted in this report. Use of external monitors for sensitive projects also \nneeds  to  be  mainstreamed.  Specifically,  the  issue  of  the  delayed  appointment  of  external \nmonitors  for  the  ongoing  Northern  GMS  Transport  Network  Improvement  needs  to  be \naddressed. \n \nOverall assessment. The overall rating of ADB's program is successful based on the \nabove six criteria. This rating is an outcome of several factors. First, ADB's contribution to the \nLao PDR transport sector has been tangible and consistent with the country's needs. Second, \nthe assistance has been effective in enabling positive outcomes at the local, country, and \nregional levels. Third, it can be attributed to having contributed to agricultural development. \nThere  remains  room  for  improvement  in  other  areas,  such  as  project  implementation \nperformance, low utilization of project outputs, institutional development, sustainability, strategic \npositioning, and differential impacts among ethnic people. \n \nADB performance. This is satisfactory for the transport sector in the Lao PDR. ADB has \nadded value by funding capital investment projects and capacity development in selected areas. \nAlthough this continues to be consistent with the needs of the country, there are other areas of ", "  v\nintervention  that  need  improvement,  such  as  sustainability.  ADB  can  further  improve  its \nperformance  by  assisting  MPWT  in  addressing  sector-wide  issues  relating  to  capacity \ndevelopment, road maintenance, and private sector development. Delegation of loan and grant \nadministration to the Lao Resident Mission could be scaled up provided it is supported by \nadequate staff and other resources. \n \nADB has been at the forefront of participating in sector working groups to coordinate \ntransport  investments  in  the  Lao  PDR.  With  the  increase  in  the  number  of  development \nagencies and the amount of external assistance, there was heightened awareness of the need \nfor donor coordination. However, coordination among agencies can be improved, especially \nregarding knowledge sharing and project implementation monitoring. \n \nLessons and Recommendations for Future Assistance \n \nThe country assistance program evaluation in 2006 for the Lao PDR had recommended \nthat  ADB  should  continue  to  support  road  maintenance  and  road  safety.  These \nrecommendations continue to be valid. \n \nFrom this SAPE, the lessons identified for ADB for future assistance are (i) higher \ndevelopment effectiveness could be achieved by continuing and scaling up the assistance for \nprovincial  and  rural  roads;  (ii)  geographically  focused  projects  enable  better  project \nmanagement  and  development  effectiveness;  (iii)  the  quality  of  sector  and  project  design \nframeworks can be improved to ensure better measurement of outcomes and impacts; (iv) ADB \ncan facilitate transfer of knowledge from other countries to the Lao PDR; (v) better due diligence \nduring procurement of civil works contracts can avoid selection of poorly qualified contractors; \n(vi) sector-wide solutions for road maintenance will ensure consistent sustainability; and (vii) \nmore detailed and careful ex-ante assessment of environmental and social impacts will ensure \nthat propensities for negative impacts are identified correctly at the feasibility stage.  External \nmonitors have been useful and could be replicated in other projects. \n \nRecommendations  for  ADB\u2019s  future  assistance  are  summarized  in  the  table  below. \nThese recommendations are suggested for inclusion in the next country partnership strategy. \nThe results of the interventions linked to these recommendations can be measured after 5 years \nto evaluate their effectiveness. \n \nRecommendation  Responsibility \nCapacity development (para. 178).

Background \n \n1.  The  Lao  People's  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  is  a  landlocked  country,  with  a \npopulation of more than 5 million people. Its transport system depends heavily on the road \nnetwork,  much  of  which  was  destroyed  during  past  conflicts  as  well  as  through  natural \ncalamities. Although considerable network rehabilitation has been achieved, network coverage \nmust be further extended to remote areas to enable their access to social services, trade, and \nincome and employment opportunities. While the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has provided \ntechnical assistance (TA), grants, and loans to support these efforts, such interventions need to \nbe continued to further improve the gaps in the network coverage. \n \n2.  ADB lending assistance for the transport sector in the Lao PDR was initiated in 1983 with \nthe road subsector, and subsequently in 1993 for the civil aviation subsector. Since then, ADB \nassistance has focused on the road subsector only. Cumulative ADB lending for the transport \nsector in the Lao PDR has amounted to $406 million, covering 14 loan projects, 1 grant-financed \nproject, and 32 TA projects as of December 2009, of which 13 were for the road subsector. As per \nthe ADB country classification system, the Lao PDR is eligible to receive concessionary Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  (ADF)  resources  in  light  of  its  gross  national  income  per  capita  and \ncreditworthiness. Appendix 1 provides details of loans and TA projects, both completed and \nongoing.1 \n \nB.  Objective and Scope \n \n3.  The  objective  of  this  sector  assistance  program  evaluation  (SAPE)  is  to  provide  an \nindependent assessment of ADB assistance between 2000 and 2009 to the Lao PDR transport \nsector and to identify areas for improving the effectiveness of its interventions. It uses facts and \nlessons  from  earlier  projects  to  establish  the  content  of  this  evaluation.  The  findings  of  this \nevaluation will feed into the broader country assistance program evaluation being carried out by the \nIndependent  Evaluation  Department  (IED).  Taking  into  account  the  sector  context,  the  SAPE \nevaluates the contribution of ADB to specific development results in the Lao PDR and identifies \nissues and lessons in the sector pertinent to the preparation of the next country partnership strategy. \n \n4.  In the Lao PDR transport sector, the SAPE mainly covers the road subsector, with a \nlimited analysis of the civil aviation subsector. Although ADB has funded only one civil aviation \nproject, this subsector is included in the SAPE to fully cover all of ADB\u2019s transport assistance. \n \nC.  Evaluation Framework and Methodology \n \n5.  The  SAPE  follows  ADB  guidelines  for  a  country  assistance  program  evaluation.2 \nAppendix 2 provides the evaluation framework for the SAPE. The evaluation criteria for the \nsector comprise relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, sustainability, development impacts, and \nstrategic positioning. Taking into account the findings from these assessments, this SAPE \nprovides  an  overall  rating  for  transport  sector  assistance  and  identifies  lessons  and \nrecommendations for future assistance. \n \n                                                 \n1  Details of these loans and TA projects are not footnoted when they are referred to in the text. \n2  ADB. 2010. Revised Guidelines for the Preparation of Country Assistance Program Evaluations. Manila. Draft. \n ", "2   \n6.  The SAPE draws on a combination of desk reviews, project documents, and primary data \ncollection to analyze the transport sector. Out of the 13 ADB-funded road projects completed in \nthe Lao PDR, IED evaluated seven projects through project performance evaluation reports \n(PPERs). More recently, a PPER has been prepared for the Rural Access Roads Project.3 These \nevaluation reports provide a comprehensive analysis of the completed projects. \n \nD.  Findings of Earlier Evaluation \n \n7.  The 2006 country assistance program evaluation for the Lao PDR4 indicated that ADB \nhad performed well in the transport sector. It found that an important factor contributing to the \noverall success of ADB operations was continuity in key sectors, like transport. The success of \nthe country program in enabling infrastructure development reflected a systematic, continued \nseries of interventions, allowing succeeding projects to build on past achievements. \n \n8.  The evaluation concluded that ADB assistance to the Lao PDR transport sector was highly \nrelevant to the country strategy objectives and the country's needs since it provided investments \nin essential infrastructure to enhance connectivity and to stimulate market transition, which were \npriority areas in all three periods of the ADB country strategies for the Lao PDR. Assistance to the \ntransport sector was efficient. Capacity building of the Ministry of Public Works and Transport \n(MPWT)\u2014formerly called the Ministry of Communications, Transport, Post, and Construction \n(MCTPC)\u2014has been a key element of ADB support to this sector through a series of advisory \ntechnical assistance (ADTA) projects over the past 2 decades. Institutional development and other \nimpacts of ADB assistance to the transport sector were rated substantial. \n \nE.  Organization of the Report \n \n9.  Chapter II of this SAPE describes the background of the Lao PDR transport sector and \nidentifies the development challenges. Chapter III provides a summary of ADB strategy and \nassistance for the sector. Chapter IV evaluates ADB sector assistance. Chapter V provides the \nconclusions, lessons, and recommendations for future sector assistance. \n \n \nII.  SECTOR CONTEXT \n \nA.  Sector Profile \n \n10.  Being a landlocked country, the Lao PDR depends heavily on road transport for trade links \nboth externally and internally. In 2007, road transport accounted for 93% of passenger travel \n(passenger-kilometers [km]) and 85% freight movement (ton-km).5 The remaining passenger and \nfreight traffic were carried through waterways and civil aviation. The road network has increased \nby 78% over the last decade from 20,000 km in 1997 to 35,558 km in 2009.6 \n \n11.  Roads. Transport infrastructure in the Lao PDR is at an early stage of development as \ndemonstrated by the road density as well as by the road quality. Its road density is low, compared \nwith  other  Southeast  Asian  countries,  as  well  as  with  most  other  landlocked  countries.  For \nexample, Mongolia, which is also a landlocked country, has a road density of 19.0 km per \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2009.

In \naddition, the general demands on the transport infrastructure are low, since traffic levels on the \nnational network (except near Vientiane and Savannakhet) are below 1,000 average annual daily \ntraffic and below 500 average annual daily traffic on most other networks. However, demand has \nbeen  increasing  over  the  years  at  an  annual  rate  of  5%\u20138%  for  goods  and  8%\u201310%  for \npassengers, indicating a rise in line with economic growth. A majority of the roads are impassable \nduring the rainy season. Appendix 3 provides a summary of the transport sector profile. \n \n12.  The number of vehicles in the country increased from 59,781 in 1985 to 568,290 in \n2005, with the highest growth occurring from 2000 to 2005 (a two-fold increase).7 At the end of \n2007, the Lao PDR had 641,031 vehicles registered, and motorcycles accounted for almost \n80%. Most of the country's transport fleet is registered in Vientiane, which has more than 40% \nof the country's vehicles. This indicates a concentration of vehicles in urban areas, increasing \nthe corresponding pressure on its transport infrastructure and traffic management. The long-\ndistance traffic segment is dominated by lighter vehicles, with trucks forming about 30% of the \ntraffic,  mostly  on  the  national  roads.  A  section  of  Road  13  (Vientiane\u2013Vangvieng\u2013\nLouangphrabang) generated the highest traffic volume at 2,000\u20134,000 vehicles per day.8 \n \n13.  The low traffic demand, combined with the need to provide access to remote areas, \nshows that the Lao PDR needs to develop basic two-lane roads at a low cost for the medium \nterm until demand rises to levels requiring significant capacity expansion.

Road classification and network condition. The public road network is divided into \n(i) national  roads  or  highways  which  connect  the  capital  city  to  other  provincial  towns  and \neconomic centers, connect to the international borders, and serve socioeconomic development at \nthe national level; (ii) provincial roads link provincial capitals and connect special economic zones \nto the district centers; (iii) district roads link district economic centers to villages; (iv) urban roads, \nwhich are internal to towns and cities; (v) rural roads link villages and utilities serving the villages; \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2007.

The traffic figures on this road have been \nobtained from the draft strategy report (footnote 6). \n ", "4   \nand (vi) special roads serve specific purposes such as for tourism, environmental conservation, \nand water source protection. Each class is formally defined in the Road Law of 1999.9 Based on \nmid-2008 estimates, out of the total 35,558 km of public roads, rural roads form the majority of the \nroad  network,  followed  by  provincial  and  national  roads  (Figure  2).10  Feeder  roads  connect \nnational roads with other smaller roads or with adjacent dwellings. \n \nFigure 2: Classification of Roads (number of kilometers), 2008 \nSpecial, 2%\nNational, 19%\nRural, 40%\nProvincial, \n20%\nUrban, 5%\nDistrict, 14%  \nSource: Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Ministry of Public Works and Transport. 2008. \nStrategic Plan for Transport Sector Development: Guiding the Sector-Wide Approach. Vientiane.  \n \n15.  In mid-2008, only 13.6% of the total length of roads was paved (using bitumen, asphalt, or \nconcrete); 33.7% was gravel; and the remaining 52.7% was earth construction. Paved roads form \n56% of the national roads and 3% of the other roads. Other roads have gravel (33.7%) or earth \nsurfaces (52.3%). Seasonal closures are frequent due to poor pavement and deficient cross-\ndrainage. MPWT reported in its 2009 strategy paper that many of these sections are impassable \nduring the rainy season (footnote 6). It also estimated that about 36% of the roads are in an \nunmaintainable condition, that is, their condition is so poor that they have to be rehabilitated. \n \n16.  Air transport. In the civil aviation subsector, the Lao PDR operates the Wattay Airport at \nVientiane  and  two  regional  airports  at  Louangphrabang  and  Pakxe.  In  addition,  there  are \n10 minor airports in the provincial capitals and 39 other airstrips. \n \n17.  Inland waterways. The Lao PDR's topography has traditionally facilitated inland waterway \ntransport. However, this form of transport is insufficiently used and lacks integration with the other \nforms of transport, especially roads. The country has over 2,000 km of rivers, comprising the \nMekong and its tributaries. Twenty-one river port facilities, constructed by the government, have \ntypically been employed for domestic trade only. However, recent years have witnessed a growth \nin cross-border trade with the People's Republic of China (PRC), Myanmar, and Thailand. \n \n18.  Railways. Other than a 3.5-km rail link across the Mekong River between Thanaleng in \nthe Lao PDR and Nongkhai in Thailand, the railway subsector in the Lao PDR has not been \ndeveloped, restricting the transport of bulk and heavy freight at lower costs. This has contributed \nto slow growth of large industries in rural areas. \n \n19.  Nonroad transport infrastructure has not developed much in the Lao PDR, due to lack of \nadequate funding as well as the relatively low level of economic activities in rural areas. The Lao \nPDR economy faces a conundrum: the lack of infrastructure hinders economic development, \nand  the  lack  of  economic  activities  does  not  provide  a  sufficiently  strong  rationale  for \n                                                 \n9  The Road Law was passed by the National Assembly on 3 April 1999. \n10 MPWT estimates in mid-2008. \n ", "  5\ninfrastructure development. Yet this issue can be resolved by developing economic centers that \nhave good access to urban areas and can attract economic and commercial activities. \n \n20.  Urban transport. The pressure on urban transport systems has been building up slowly. \nWhile  the  number  of  vehicles  has  been  increasing  in  line  with  national  figures,  urban \ninfrastructure in Vientiane and other large towns needs to be upgraded, and mass rapid transit \nsystems must be introduced. A 2008 study on Vientiane's urban transport network forecasted a \nrise in vehicle trips from 418,775 in 2007 to 958,144 in 2025, a growth of 2.3 times.11 This will \nimpact traffic congestion in the city similar to other Asian cities such as Bangkok and Manila. \n \n21.  According to the 2008 study, the number of registered vehicles especially increased after \n2000, primarily attributed to the growing availability of low-priced motorcycles. Traffic surveys \nconducted in Vientiane showed that there is usually high traffic on major roads, with the highest \ntraffic volume (58,470 vehicles per day in both directions, including motorcycles) observed in front \nof the Pohphano Temple along Kaysone Road. This indicates a growing problem of congestion, \nrequiring a combination of infrastructure improvement and traffic management. \n \nB.  Institutional Arrangements \n \n22.  MPWT  is  the  national  government  agency  primarily  in  charge  of  transport.  It  is \nresponsible for developing national and provincial roads, civil aviation, urban transport systems, \nriver wharves, and river and road transport. MPWT consists of six departments: the Department \nof Civil Aviation, Department of Housing and Urban Planning, Department of Inland Waterways, \nDepartment of Planning and Cooperation, Department of Roads (DOR), and Department of \nTransport.  Based  on  5-year  transport  plans,  the  provinces  prepare  and  submit  annual \nimplementation plans for transport projects to MPWT. \n \n23.  Roads. Recent changes to the institutional structure of MPWT resulted in a delegated, \ndecentralized system of coordination and implementation. MPWT has the overall responsibility \nbut has delegated certain project management and maintenance responsibilities to departments \nof public works and transport (DPWTs) in each province, with subsidiary offices in districts. \nSimilarly, DPWTs have delegated various tasks to offices of public works and transport, which \nare headed by DPWT staff. DPWTs report to the provincial governor for budget purposes but \nalso to MPWT for compliance with national technical standards.12 Although MPWT provides \npartial budgetary support for routine and periodic maintenance, the implementation is carried \nout by DPWTs, requiring adequate technical capacity at the provincial and district levels. \n \n24.  The Road Maintenance Fund (RMF) was created within the organizational structure of \nMPWT.  It  is  supervised  and  directed  by  an  RMF  advisory  board,  which  consists  of \nrepresentatives from the public and private sectors appointed by the Prime Minister from the \nMinistry of Finance, MPWT, provincial authorities, Lao National Chamber of Commerce and \nIndustry, road and passenger transport operators, and the general public. The advisory board \nalso  recommends  user  charges  based  on  maintenance  requirements.13  The  Road \nAdministration Department of MPWT coordinates with the RMF regarding financial support for \nnational road maintenance and the Local Roads Division with regard to local roads. \n                                                 \n11 Government of the Lao PDR, MCTPC and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). 2008.

Within MPWT, the Department of Civil Aviation is responsible for policy \nand  planning  in  civil  aviation  and  for  regulatory  oversight  of  technical  and  safety  matters \npertaining to aviation and the Lao Airports Authority. The department has eight divisions in \naddition to the Lao Airports Authority, which is responsible for the operation and maintenance of \nthe  Wattay  international  and  domestic  airport  terminals  (Vientiane),  two  regional  airports \n(Louangphrabang and Pakxe), and two provincial airports (Louang Namtha and Savannakhet). \nAll other provincial small airports are the responsibility of the provincial governments with the \ndepartment\u2019s technical consultation. \n \n26.  Inland waterways. The Department of Waterways is responsible for policy, planning, and \nmanaging  all  inland  waterways  in  the  country.  This  includes  port  and  navigation  channel \nmanagement, flooding and river bank protection, and waterways transport. These waterways carry \nfreight within the Lao PDR, as well as across the border to the PRC, Myanmar, and Thailand. \n \n27.  Railways. The Lao National Railways Authority under MPWT is responsible for managing \nthe short railway line, which is used for freight traffic, between the Lao PDR and Thailand. \n \nC.  Development Challenges \n \n28.  Funding  constraints.  Despite  large  investments  to  develop  the  national  roads  and \nhighways, the road network remains less developed due to funding constraints for rehabilitation. \nMost remote parts of the Lao PDR remain inaccessible and depend on earth roads, which are often \nimpassable during the rainy season. As previously stated, only 56% of the national roads are paved \nwith a bitumen surface (footnote 12). Further, besides central budget allocations, MPWT depends \non funding from multilateral and bilateral development agencies, whose funding has been mainly \nchanneled  toward  developing  the  national  road  network,  i.e.,  highways,  often  overlooking  the \nsmaller and more remote provincial and rural roads. Lack of adequate funding has been the main \nconstraint faced by the sector, which is also evident by the delays in the availability of counterpart \nfunds. The project completion reports (PCRs) of the recently completed Rural Access Roads Project \nand  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS):  Northern  Economic  Corridor  Project  indicated  that \ncounterpart funding has become a significant challenge in the recent years. It is being resolved in \nthe current projects through tax breaks, e.g., for the ongoing Northern GMS Transport Network \nImprovement Project, the counterpart funding includes taxes of $5.6 million. \n \n29.  High dependence on external assistance. The Lao PDR continues to depend heavily on \nexternal assistance from multilateral and bilateral development agencies to fund capital investments \nand,  to  a  certain  extent,  for  maintenance  expenditure.  For  2007\u20132008,  MPWT's  total  public \ninvestment for roads amounted to $78.59 million, of which 73% came from external assistance and \nthe remaining from national budget resources (Table 1). Although this dependence has fallen in \nrecent years, about 50% of MPWT's budget is still funded by external assistance. \n \nTable 1: Annual Investment for Road Sector in the Lao People's Democratic Republic \nTotal Road Sector  Funding from  Funding from External \nInvestment by MPWT  National Budget  Assistancea \nYear  ($ million)  ($ million)  ($ million) \n2007\u20132008  78.59  20.86 (27%)  57.73 (73%) \n2008\u20132009  83.64  28.81 (34%)  54.06 (65%) \n2009\u20132010 (estimate)  88.55  40.15 (45%)  48.40 (55%) \nMPWT = Ministry of Public Works and Transport. \nNote: Funding from the national budget includes that for the Road Maintenance Fund.

Road maintenance. Rehabilitated paved roads have been deteriorating due to lack of \nregular  maintenance,  both  routine  and  periodic.  Although  the  RMF  has  been  set  up  and \noperationalized, it is focused on national roads and highways, and can allocate only 10% of its \nrevenues to provincial and rural roads. This has resulted in neglect of rural road maintenance, \nwhich is also due to insufficient funding by the provincial governments. \n \n31.  Institutional capacity. The Lao PDR lacks technically trained personnel in general and also \nin MPWT. The capacity to plan, implement, monitor, and maintain transport projects is currently \ninsufficient  to  keep  pace  with  the  increasing  size  of  the  network.  Although  several  capacity \ndevelopment programs have been implemented, gaps remain in various areas, such as project \nmanagement, safeguard monitoring, rehabilitation and maintenance planning, and procurement. \n \n32.  Differential  impacts  on  ethnic  groups.  Improvement  of  roads  could  increase  the \neconomic inequality between ethnic groups since benefits may not accrue equally to all groups. \nSuch differential impacts can be addressed only if the assessment at appraisal is carried out \nefficiently, propensities for differential economic development are identified correctly at the \nfeasibility stage, and mitigation measures are put in place. At times, such assessments have \nbeen rudimentary. \n \n33.  Road safety. Road improvement is typically linked to higher vehicle speeds, which in turn \nleads to more road accidents. In addition, there has been an increase in the severity of these \naccidents in terms of injuries and fatalities. Between 2002 and 2007, there was 4% average annual \ngrowth (year on year) in the number of accidents in the country.14 Motorcycles accounted for the \nhighest accident rates, followed by cars and pickups. Another challenge linked to road safety is \nvehicle overloading. Logging trucks and international traffic on some road sections continue to be \nmain sources of overloading. This leads to road damage, reducing the life of the road. Further, \nexisting weigh stations on national roads do not adequately enforce vehicle axle controls, while \nprovincial and rural roads lack such stations. Finally, road construction remains a challenging task, \nowing to the country's generally steep terrain and propensity toward landslides. Slope stabilization \ntechniques for reducing landslides tend to be costly, reducing the economic viability of projects. \n \nD.  Government Strategy \n \n34.  The government's sector strategy has focused primarily on expanding the road network \nin a continuing effort to provide all-weather access. The Socioeconomic Development Plan, \n2001\u20132020 and the Fifth Five-Year Plan for Socioeconomic Development, 2001\u20132005 have \nidentified the main goal for 2010, which is to improve and build economic infrastructure with firm \nand secured steps in particular to strengthen agricultural production, eradicate slash-and-burn \ncultivation, complete poverty reduction of the people, and build basic industrial initiatives and \nhuman resources in sufficient quality and quantity in order to step into industrial development \nand modernization step by step.15 While the emphasis on infrastructure development includes \nthe transport sector, the sector strategy has focused on improving the national roads, i.e., \nhighways, for providing international connectivity with neighboring countries. The development \nof district and rural roads has been included under the rural development efforts that cover \nvarious other interventions.16 \n                                                 \n14 Data provided by MPWT. \n15 Government of the Lao PDR, Lao PDR Committee for Planning and Cooperation. 2001. Socioeconomic Development \nPlan from 2001 to 2020 and the Fifth Five-Year Plan for Socioeconomic Development, 2001\u20132005. Vientiane. \n16 Rural development efforts were strategically combined with poverty reduction activities and comprised slash-and-\nburn  cultivation  stabilization;  permanent  resettlement  management  and  land  and  forest  allocation;  opium \neradication; communications, electricity, and water supply basic infrastructure development; education and public \nhealth improvement; improvement of gender issues; and district and village staff training. \n ", "8   \n35.  Transport development has always been a priority of the government. However, owing to \nfinancial  constraints,  international  development  agencies  have  played  an  important  role  in \ncontributing to sector investment. The country\u2019s transport strategy, set forth in the most recent \nNational Socioeconomic Development Plan (NSEDP),17 aims to provide transport infrastructure \nfor the entire country so that the population can more readily communicate and participate in \ndevelopment activities as well as interact with neighbors and markets outside of the country. \nAttention to primary roads will continue, but increasing emphasis is placed on GMS road links, \nrural transport infrastructure, and railways development. Table A3.9 provides the details of the \ngovernment\u2019s  strategic  plan  for  transport  development  anchored  within  the  NSEDP  6  and \nindicates  the  priorities  for  each  subsector.  Although  Table  A3.9  shows  high  government \ncommitment toward road maintenance, it needs to be backed up by appropriate allocations, \nespecially for rural road maintenance, which is currently lacking (paras. 109\u2013112). \n \n36.  Development agency coordination. The NSEDP\u2019s medium-term expenditure program \nfor  transport  lists  an  extensive  investment  plan  for  projects  with  an  estimated  total  cost  of \n$900 million, which exceeds available resources. In keeping with the Vientiane Declaration and in \nconjunction with the government, development agencies have agreed to adopt a sector-wide \napproach (SWAp) to increase aid effectiveness for the transport sector.18 The SWAp approach \nhas already been adopted by the World Bank in its support of the Road Maintenance Program, \nalbeit in a limited way. MPWT has now created a secretariat for the SWAp, which will take steps \nto strengthen financial management systems and their capacity to implement environmental and \nsocial safeguards. Transport sector donors, including ADB, the Australian Agency for International \nDevelopment (AusAID); Department for International Development of the United Kingdom; KfW; \nSwedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida); Thailand's National Economic \nDevelopment Authority; and the governments of PRC, Japan, and the Republic of Korea have \nagreed to support the SWAp.19 Thus, an infrastructure sector working group has been set up by \nMPWT and is co-chaired by ADB and the Embassy of Japan (para. 83). \n \n37.  Decentralization. The government initiated a policy of decentralization of the development \neffort in 2000. A Prime Ministerial Instruction set out the general principles to build up \u201cprovinces as \nstrategic units, districts as planning and budgeting units, and villages as implementation units.\u201d20 \nThis was complemented by (i) detailed recommendations by the State Planning Committee on the \ncompetence,  functions,  and  responsibilities  of  the  stakeholders  regarding  planning;  and  (ii)  a \nMinistry of Finance recommendation on establishing and implementing provincial budgets. The \ndecentralization policy enables the provinces to formulate their 5-year and annual socioeconomic \nplans and related budgets, and delegates the revenue collection tasks linked with these plans. Such \ndecentralization has implications on the transfer of specific activities such as maintenance contract \nmanagement, project management for smaller roads, various procurement activities, etc., to the \nDPWT. It will require a definitive building of technical and administrative capacities at the district and \nprovincial levels, especially in the DPWTs.  \n \n                                                 \n17 Government of the Lao PDR, Lao PDR Committee for Planning and Investment. 2006.

Now  included  in  the  NSEDP  6,  the  National  Growth  and  Poverty \nEradication Strategy places poverty eradication and acceleration of social development as the \ncountry's primary long-term strategic goals.21 The three pillars of the strategy are (i) economic \ngrowth with equity, (ii) sociocultural development, and (iii) sustainable environment preservation. \nThe four priority sectors for ensuring poverty reduction are agriculture, health, education, and \ninfrastructure.  Thus,  a  key  presupposition  of  the  government  is  that  improvement  of  the \ntransport sector (i.e., infrastructure) will lead to poverty reduction. \n \n39.  The  government's  recent  draft  strategy  for  transport  sector  development  adopts  a \nmulticriteria analysis for prioritizing projects based on the following factors (in descending order \nof  weight):  (i)  international  links,  (ii)  linking  provinces  and  Vientiane,  (iii)  impacting \nsocioeconomic  or  poverty  eradication,  (iv)  serving  national  integration  and  defense,  and \n(v) serving large populations (footnote 6). These prioritization criteria reflect the government's \npolicy of improving the connectivity with neighboring countries. The strategy indicates that a \nsubregional project is five times more important than a project serving a large population, and it \nis  60%  more  important  than  a  project  serving  socioeconomic  development  and  poverty \nreduction. This has policy implications on giving higher importance to developing international \nlinks, such as regional roads, as compared with providing access to remote areas within the \ncountry by developing provincial and rural roads. \n \nIII.  ADB STRATEGY AND PROGRAM \nA.  Sector Strategy, 1991\u20132011 \n \n40.  Appendix 4 provides details of the country strategies adopted by ADB in the Lao PDR \nfrom 1991 to 2011. These have evolved in accordance with national and regional demands. The \n1991 and 1996 operational strategies adopted sustainable economic growth as a strategic focus. \nUnder these country operational strategies, ADB identified development challenges for improving \nthe physical infrastructure, particularly national and provincial roads, river ports, and airports. The \ncountry assistance plan, 2001\u2013200322 also emphasized economic  growth but paid particular \nattention  to  providing  more  balanced  development.  By  highlighting  improvement  in  public \nexpenditure management, ADB saw a great demand for building capacity in road planning and \nsustainable  operation  and  maintenance  of  road  networks.  The  next  country  strategies  and \nprograms (CSPs) and updates,23 which emphasized poverty reduction and covered 2002\u20132008, \nwere more concerned with rural access roads and small airports to promote rural\u2013urban market \nlinks. Appendix 4 also provides an evolution in the specific thematic areas. Significantly, there was \nincreasing emphasis on GMS roads to create transport links in line with subregional integration \nand cooperation within the region. The current CSP 2007\u2013201124 also adopts poverty reduction \nas a priority. While it seeks to maintain previous lines of assistance, it recommends expanding \nADB support to the GMS Program, focusing on the improvement of transport corridors for trade \nand tourism. TA on transport has shifted from the introduction of regulatory frameworks on user \ncharges to formulating a transport sector strategy and sustaining the RMF. \n \n                                                 \n21 Government of the Lao PDR. 2003.

The above analysis leads to three main inferences: \n(i)  The  ADB  transport  sector  strategy  in  the  Lao  PDR  has  supported  the \ngovernment, and has evolved to focus more on regional roads (i.e., through the \nGMS Program) to improve connectivity with neighboring countries, even as it has \nexited from the civil aviation subsector. \n(ii)  There has been a growing awareness of the need to ensure the sustainability of \nprojects, although what ADB will do in this area has not been clearly identified. \n(iii)  Rural roads is currently an emerging subsector for ADB in the Lao PDR. \n \nB.  Sector Program \n \n42.  ADB has been involved in the Lao PDR transport sector since 1979 when it first provided \nTA for the Vientiane Plain Road Improvement Project. During the 1980s, assistance for the Lao \nPDR\u2019s transport sector was concentrated on the road subsector. In 1992, ADB first entered the \ncountry\u2019s civil aviation subsector, which was made possible by the approval of the Civil Aviation \nMaster Plan in August 1992 (Appendix 1). \n \n43.  Over the years, ADB has approved 14 loans totaling $363.0 million, 32 TA projects \ntotaling $16.1 million, and 1 grant worth $27.0 million. Out of the 14 loans approved, only 2 were \nnot specifically for the road subsector: the Airports Improvement Project in the civil aviation \nsubsector and the GMS: Mekong Tourism Development Project in both the civil aviation and the \nroad subsectors. There were 13 loans in the road subsector\u20144 were approved in the 1980s, \n5 were approved in the 1990s, and 4 were approved in the 2000s.25 The assistance for the civil \naviation  subsector  amounted  to  $16.8  million,  while  the  assistance  for  the  road  subsector \namounted  to  $350.9  million.26  Using  the  categorization  mentioned  in  para.  14,  Figure  3 \nillustrates the distribution of ADB-financed project capital investments and TA for the Lao PDR\u2019s \ntransport sector. \n \nFigure 3: ADB Assistance for the Transport Sector \nLoans ($ million)a Technical Assistance ($'000)\nAirports, 5% Civil Aviation, \nProvincial or  11%\nRural Roads, \n24%\nFeeder \nNational  Roads, 4%\nRoads, 67%  \nRoads, 89%  \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \na These relate to civil works costs only. \nSource: Asian Development Bank project management database. For completed projects, actual data from the \nproject completion report are used. For ongoing projects, data from the reports and recommendation of the \nPresident are used. \n \n44.  As for the TA projects, five projects were approved for the civil aviation subsector totaling \n$1.8 million, while the rest were projects for the road subsector. Out of the 5 TA projects in the civil \n                                                 \n25 This includes the GMS: Mekong Tourism Development Project. \n26 Includes investments in Louang Namtha airport and access road improvements under the GMS: Mekong Tourism \nDevelopment Project. \n ", "  11\naviation subsector, 3 were approved during the 1990s, and the rest were approved after. The 26 TA \nprojects in the road subsector were mostly during the 1980s and the 1990s. Only one TA, Vientiane \nPlain Road Improvement, was approved before 1980 and only four TA projects excluding those on \nManagement  Information  System  (Phase  II)  (Supplementary)\u2014Strengthening  Social  and \nEnvironmental Management Capacity in DOR, Roads for Rural Development, Northern Economic \nCorridor, and Northern GMS Transport Network Improvement, were approved after 1999. \n \n45.  ADB\u2019s road subsector program can be broadly divided into two categories based on the \nmode  of  lending\u2014the  Lao  PDR  country  program  that  has  supported  various  levels  of  road \nimprovements from national roads to rural roads; and the GMS regional program that has supported \nmainly national roads connecting the international borders. The regional roads referred in this SAPE \nfall under the latter category. Table 2 summarizes the categories adopted for the purpose of this \nSAPE. The CSP 2007\u20132011 includes both these categories. The objective of separating these \nprograms is to highlight the need for scaling up assistance for the provincial and rural roads to \nfurther improve the development effectiveness (para. 118). \n \nTable 2: Category of ADB Assistance in the Lao PDR Road Subsector \nLao PDR Country Program  GMS Regional Program \nNational roads connecting domestic economic  National roads or highways connecting \ncenters  international borders (mentioned as regional roads \nin the SAPE) \n \nFeeder, provincial, and rural roads  Minimal rural roads adjacent to the highways \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, GMS = Greater Mekong Subregion, Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, \nSAPE = sector assistance program evaluation. \nSource: ADB project management database. \n \n46.  In the road subsector, loans amounting to $337 million are divided: $15 million went to \nfeeder roads, $85 million went to provincial and rural roads, and $237 million went to national \nroads and highways.27 This indicates the focus on national roads. \n \n47.  In addition to the rural roads included in the transport portfolio, ADB provided assistance \nthrough the agriculture and rural development lending window. These rural roads are typically \nfarm-to-market  roads,  as  well  as  selected  district  roads  connecting  district  centers.  ADB's \ncompleted and ongoing assistance has contributed to the improvement of about 796 km of such \nroads in the Lao PDR (TableA1.3). The rural roads component has varied between 12.7% and \n34.5% of total project investments. \n \n48.  ADB had only one project in the civil aviation subsector in the 1990s, after which it \nvirtually exited from the sector. In 2002, ADB reentered in this subsector by providing a loan for \nairport  infrastructure  improvement  (extension  and  rehabilitation  of  Louang  Namtha  airport) \naimed at tourism development.28 Currently, assistance to this subsector forms 7% of total ADB \nassistance to the Lao PDR transport sector. This is a reflection of ADB's priorities presented in \nits second medium-term strategy, which provided a low priority for civil aviation projects.29 The \ncurrent  Strategy  2020  continues  to  focus  on  other  infrastructure  areas,  implying  that  civil \naviation is not a core area.30 \n                                                 \n27 Some provincial roads were designed as rural roads. Subsequently, several were recategorized by MPWT as \nnational roads. However, their primary use continues to be mainly agriculture-related. \n28 The project also includes rehabilitation of access roads to tourist destinations. \n29 ADB. 2006.

Program Implementation \n1.  Loan Projects \n49.  Analysis of planned and actual ADB assistance in the Lao PDR indicates that most of \nthe planned assistance in the early 1990s was generally approved as envisaged (Appendix 5) \nexcept for some gaps. The Northern GMS Network Improvement Project was processed as \nscheduled in the CSP 2007\u20132011. Although the pipeline of the CSP 2007\u20132011 included the \nsecond Northern GMS Network Improvement Project for processing in 2008, this has been \ndelayed. Similarly, the ADTA for Building Sector Program Readiness in the Transportation \nSector to be approved in 2008 has been combined with the Southern Network Transport Project \nto be approved in 2012. Thus, the overall implementation performance of the CSP 2007\u20132011 \nhas been mixed. For the earlier CSPs, GMS loans for the East\u2013West Economic Corridor, \nNorthern Economic Corridor, and Northern GMS Transport Network Improvement projects were \napproved as planned. However, assistance for rural roads (e.g., the Rural Access Roads II \nProject) to rehabilitate the national road network (as identified in the current CSP) has not yet \nbeen approved. Efforts are under way to process this assistance in a modified form. \n \n50.  ADB's portfolio of loan and grant projects has witnessed several implementation issues \nsuch as cost overruns, implementation delays, counterpart funding, and contractor problems. \nOut of the 10 evaluated road projects, half reported varying amounts of cost overruns. The five \nprojects  with  major  cost  overruns  (over  20%)  showed  actual  civil  works  costs  for  road \nimprovements that were greater than appraisal estimates. In fact, 9 of the 10 evaluated road \nprojects experienced cost overruns or increase in costs due to various reasons surrounding cost \nescalations of various natures. For example, the Second Road Improvement Project overshot \nthe appraisal target for civil works cost by 85% and needed additional funds to be transferred \nfrom the Sixth Road Improvement Project to complete its original scope (Appendix 1). The Sixth \nRoad Improvement Project faced higher than expected civil works costs causing an indirect cost \noverrun fueling a reduction in project scope. \n \n51.  Table A6.2 describes evaluated road projects with cost overruns or increase in costs \n(linked to change in project scope) in their civil works or road improvement components. In \nseveral cases, cost overruns have been addressed through a reduction in project scope, which \ntends to reduce the effectiveness of the projects. In others, increase in costs reflected a change \nin scope of works, as loan savings created by currency fluctuations benefited the budgets of \nongoing projects. This has been more common in recent years when cost overruns have been \nreduced due to low bid prices and depreciation of the kip, enabling ADB to use loan savings to \nincrease the scope of works. The Xieng Khouang Road Improvement Project and the GMS: \nEast\u2013West  Economic  Corridor  Project  are  examples  of  loan  savings  being  used  to  fund \nadditional works. Para. 91 brings out the issue about the lack of adequate economic analysis at \ncompletion of the increased project scope. \n \n52.  In the civil aviation sector, the Airports Improvement Project (Appendix 1) faced a 209% \nincrease in cost due to the change in scope of the Japan International Cooperation Agency \n(JICA) component. This resulted from inadequate information available at appraisal. Besides the \ncost overrun, the project also witnessed implementation delays of more than 4 years. The \nunderlying causes of this implementation performance were as follows. \n(i)  Lack of adequate coordination among cofinanciers. Besides ADB, the project \nwas cofinanced by JICA, Nordic Development Fund, Organization of Petroleum \nExporting  Countries  (OPEC)  Fund  for  International  Development,  and  the \n ", "  13\ngovernments of France and Thailand. This created additional implementation \nburdens  on  the  executing  agency.  The  changes  in  project  scope  and  the \nincrease in the costs of components financed by other cofinanciers affected the \nimplementation performance. \n(ii)  Institutional constraints. The executing agency, originally the National Airports \nAuthority  (and  the  Department  of  Civil  Aviation),  were  unfamiliar  with  ADB \nprocedures relating to procurement of consultants and contractors. This led to \nstart-up delays and subsequently slow approvals for payments. \n \n53.  Implementation delays. ADB's transport sector projects in the Lao PDR faced average \ncompletion delays of about 35 months (Table A6.3), which is higher than the ADB average of \n24 months.31 In projects that used advanced procurement, the major causes of delay were \nrelated  to  the  inexperience  of  the  executing  agency  in  project  administration  and  in  ADB \nprocesses, mobilization of the required implementation structure, delayed counterpart funding, \ndelays in preparation of tender documents, and contractor problems. For the remaining projects, \ndelays were caused by the late engagement of consultants, slow mobilization of equipment, \ndesign changes and/or additional work, and the prolonged and tedious procurement process of \nthe  government.  Other  factors  that  affected  the  completion  of  civil  works  include  physical \nconditions  such  as  massive  landslides  (e.g.,  the  Fourth  Road  Improvement  Project)  and \ndiscoveries  of  deeply  buried  unexploded  ordnances  (e.g.,  East\u2013West  Economic  Corridor \nProject). Delayed counterpart funding continues to be a major cause of implementation delays, \nand was a cause in 4 out of the 10 completed road projects. \n \n54.  Until the early 1990s, start-up delays were common due to procurement issues, contract \naward delays, delayed engineering design, and contractor mobilization delays. From 1993, with the \napproval of the Sixth Road Improvement Project, ADB allowed advance procurement prior to loan \napproval for early contracting of goods or works.32 This partly contributed to reducing the start-up \ndelays as evidenced in the subsequent projects. Some projects, such as the Champasack Road \nImprovement Project, benefited from advance action, while others, such as the Xieng Khouang \nRoad  Improvement  Project,  faced  start-up  delays  despite  advance  action.  Although  advance \nprocurement helped facilitate preparatory activities, it did not guarantee timely completion of projects \nsince other factors tended to impinge on construction. However, the SAPE encourages advance \nprocurement, which needs to continue since it provides time savings at project start-up; however, \nproject-readiness filters are needed to control start-up delays. Discussions with ADB project staff in \nthe Lao PDR indicated that such filters are being developed to assess the institutional preparedness \nwithin the government to implement new projects. Appendix 6 provides details of the implementation \nperformance  of  projects  with  and  without  advance  action.  It  shows  that  although  advance \nprocurement  action  helped  in  reducing  start-up  delays,  other  implementation  issues  persisted \nindicating continued difficulties faced by the executing agency in implementation. \n \n55.  Contractor problems. The Lao PDR has encouraged the growth of private contracting \nfirms, some of which are offshoots of former state-owned enterprises. However, most of these \nnational  firms  lack  experience  in  technical  and  commercial  aspects.  With  limited  financial \n                                                 \n31 ADB. 2008. Annual Report on 2007 Portfolio Performance. Manila. \n32 Under Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time), advance action may be allowed to authorize \nprocurement prior to loan approval, particularly when early contracting of goods or works is seen as crucial for the \ntimely completion of a project. In such cases, ADB encourages borrowers to comply with its procurement procedures \nincluding the required advertising for the contracts to be eligible for ADB financing. The guidelines also stipulate that \nthe advance actions undertaken should be subject to ADB review and taken at the risk of borrowers. Any concurrence \nby ADB with the procedures, documentation, or proposal for award does not commit ADB to finance the project. \nRetroactive financing or reimbursements may be permitted within the limits specified in the financing agreement. \n ", "14   \ncapacities, they often face difficulties in purchasing equipment and completing the construction \nactivities on schedule. Yet there has been growing encouragement from MPWT and multilateral \nagencies to award contracts to the national firms. However, this needs to be matched by \nadequate  capacity  within  these  firms,  which  currently  is  lacking.  The  issue  of  contractor \nperformance was quite distinct on the Rural Access Roads Project and the Roads for Rural \nDevelopment Project, which used national contractors in an effort to develop local capacities. \nWhile this justification was seen as appropriate, the national contractors were not capable of \ndelivering  the  civil  works  as  per  the  project  requirements,  leading  to  cost  overruns  and \nimplementation  delays.  Better  implementation  of  procurement  rules  during  selection  of  the \ncontractors, as well as close supervision, is needed. \n \n56.  Implementation of rural roads as part of agriculture projects. Para. 47 provides \ndetails  of  rural  roads  funded  within  the  scope  of  agriculture  projects.  These  road  project \ncomponents were executed either by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry or the provincial \ngovernments,  but  they  were  implemented  by  the  provincial  Department  of  Construction, \nTransport, Post, and Communication (now referred as DPWTs). This setup has ensured that the \nroad interventions are integrated into broader agriculture-driven rural development. The Shifting \nCultivation Stabilization Project, completed in 2006, witnessed cost and environmental impacts \ndue to changes in physical road designs. The quality of outputs was adequate. DPWT capacity \nremains limited to manage these road improvement projects, as does sustainability given the \nmeager funding for maintenance. \n \n2.  Technical Assistance \n57.  TA  projects  amounted  to  $16.10  million,  out  of  which  the  road  subsector  received \n$14.32 (89%)  million  and  the  civil  aviation  subsector  $1.78  million.  Of  the  32  TA  projects \napproved from 1979 for the transport sector, 15 were classified as project preparatory technical \nassistance  (PPTA)  projects  and  17  were  classified  as  ADTA  projects  (Appendix  7).  ADB \napproved PPTA for the GMS: Louangphrabang Airport Improvement Project in December 2006. \nAfter a gap of 4 years, ADB approved another PPTA for the proposed Second Northern GMS \nTransport Network Improvement Project in 2010, which is ongoing. An associated TA to the \nRural Access Roads Project (approved in December 2000) was the last ADTA provided by ADB \nas part of the country program, indicating a gap in TA by ADB. \n \n58.  Project preparatory technical assistance for roads. The objectives of most PPTA \nroad projects were to carry out technical and economic feasibility studies for the improvement \nand/or  rehabilitation  of  roads,  formulate  project  designs,  and  assess  the  capabilities  of \ninstitutions tasked to undertake road construction and maintenance operations. \n \n59.  Most TA activities as envisaged were completed. The feasibility studies and TA reports \nwere used as inputs to the formulation of road projects. At least nine PPTA projects for roads \nresulted in the approval of project loans and one grant project. Yet, analysis of start-up and \nimplementation delays as well as subsequent scope reductions (para. 51) indicate that PPTA \nprojects did not seek to improve project designs over the last decade. The only change was in \nbringing in advance procurement (para. 54). In view of this, the incremental value addition by \nthe PPTA projects can be improved, especially in the area of project design. \n \n60.  Project preparatory technical assistance for civil aviation. The objectives of PPTA \nprojects for civil aviation were to update the Civil Aviation Master Plan, provide the framework \nfor sustainable and effective development of the civil aviation sector, upgrade airport designs \nand facilities, and support tourism and trade through the integration of the Lao PDR in the GMS \nair traffic network. There were no reports available describing the actual outputs of these TA \n ", "  15\nprojects, except in the case of the Civil Aviation Master Plan. This small-scale TA helped update \nthe  civil  aviation  master  plan,  formulate  suitable  arrangements  for  its  implementation,  and \nresulted in the approval of the Airports Improvement Project (Appendix 1). \n \n61.  Advisory technical assistance for roads. Most ADTA projects for the road subsector \nwere attached to project loans. ADTA projects for roads and highways focused on providing \ncapacity development and institutional support to MPWT for operations and road maintenance, \nbridge  management,  and  privatization  of  government-owned  road  transport  organizations. \nSpecific forms of interventions included the conduct of studies; formulation of policy guidelines, \nlegal framework, and investment plans; provision of on-the-job training to officers and staff; and \nimprovement of systems and procedures on planning and budgeting. Some TA projects included \nthe recommendation of mitigation measures to address potential adverse environmental and \nsocial impacts of road projects (e.g., TA projects on East\u2013West Economic Corridor Coordination \nand Strengthening Social and Environmental Management Capacity in the DOR). \n \n62.  ADB approved the last ADTA in 2000, pausing ADB's efforts at capacity building in the \ncountry. Between 2000 and 2009, ADB has only approved ADTA embedded in the regional \ndevelopment framework for promoting transport and trade facilitation within the GMS. These \nregional TA projects are aimed at (i) streamlining and strengthening institutional mechanisms for \naddressing regional transport and trade facilitation initiatives, and (ii) strengthening institutional \ncapacity within GMS countries to undertake initiatives for GMS transport and trade facilitation. \nAppendix 8 provides a summary of these regional TA projects and shows that although they \nprovided substantial contribution to trade facilitation and regional transport development, there \nwas limited assistance toward areas of domestic transport development such as safeguard \nimplementation, rural road network expansion, and maintenance planning and funding.33 \n \n63.  Following a process of policy dialogue and capacity development assistance that began \nin the mid-1990s, ADB provided a capacity development program loan to support improved \nenvironmental management and social safeguards in the energy and transport sectors. The \nEnvironment and Social Program has partly achieved its expected outcome. At the national \nlevel, it succeeded in putting in place streamlined procedures for environmental and social \nsafeguards. However, at the subnational level, the achievement was somewhat less, with the \nprogram only partly achieving expected improvements in environmental and social management \nof both energy and transport projects.34 \n \n64.  Overall, the Environment and Social Program was borderline successful.35 Program \noutputs were generally achieved, with the exception of the Environment Protection Fund. In \nterms  of  sector  achievements,  the  energy  and  transport  sectors  established  the  required \nregulatory  framework  and  institutional  mechanism  to  undertake  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard measures on their own. The program substantially achieved its expected output of \nstrengthening the national policy and regulatory framework for environmental management and \nsocial safeguards. It also achieved its expected output of improving the subnational-level (sector \nand  provincial)  planning  and  policy  implementation  framework.  Both  the  national  and \n                                                 \n33 This was stated in the CSP 2007\u20132011 and continues to be relevant. \n34 With regard to the transport sector, there is evidence to suggest that the environmental management of transport \nprojects  has  improved  since  the  Environment  and  Social  Program  has  been  implemented;  however,  the \nperformance depends on the location. Projects in sensitive areas have sometimes led to increased soil erosion \nduring construction and air pollution during implementation. The social benefits from transport projects are not easy \nto quantify. On the one hand, transport corridors have certainly contributed to enhanced economic growth in the \nproject areas, particularly with regard to improving market access. On the other hand, transport projects have not at \ntimes been carried out with due attention to resettled persons and ethnic minorities. \n35 ADB. 2010. Performance Evaluation Report: Environment and Social Program in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic. Manila. \n ", "16   \nsubnational framework components of the program were successful. The sustainable financing \nmechanisms component, including the Environment Protection Fund, was partly successful. \n \n65.  Eight ADTA projects were completed, out of which six were assessed by IED's PPERs. \nOf these, one was highly successful, five were successful, and one was partly successful. The \nTA on Roads for Rural Development was highly successful. Among the five ADTA projects rated \nsuccessful were the TA projects on Feeder Roads Maintenance Training and Management \nInformation  System  in  MCTPC,  which  were  both  attached  to  the  Champasack  Road \nImprovement Project. In the case of the TA on Feeder Roads Maintenance Training, the PPER \nclaimed that the effectiveness of the training could not be distinguished from other capacity-\nbuilding  measures  implemented  by  MCTPC.  Also  rated  successful  were  the  TA  on  the \nPrivatization and Management of Road Sector Institutions, Management Information System \n(Phase II), and East\u2013West Economic Corridor Coordination.36 Those rated successful to highly \nsuccessful contributed in formulating policy guidelines and providing strategic direction to the \nroad subsector in the Lao PDR. The TA on Bridge Management attached to the Fourth Road \nImprovement Project was rated partly successful, as it was found to be ineffective in building \ncapacities  or  establishing  functioning  systems  required  for  instituting  an  effective  bridge \nmanagement system.37 \n \n66.  The main issues from the evaluation of ADTA projects revolve around the lack of funding \nfor road maintenance and inadequate equipment and human resources. Efforts to address \nthese were observed to be slow but progressing. Completion and evaluation reports on these \nADTA projects recommended the need to (i) further develop capacity in road maintenance and \noperations; (ii) sustain the gains obtained through training and actual use of manuals and \nguidelines; (iii) encourage ownership and accountability to pursue policy reforms, particularly \nthose  related  to  the  privatization  process;  (iv)  participate  in  cross-border  commerce;  and \n(v) avoid overlapping donor assistance and ensure efficiency in resource allocation. \n \n67.

One ADTA was provided for civil \naviation  for  the  Institutional  Strengthening  of  the  National  Airports  Authority  and  Lao  Civil \nAviation, attached to the Airports Improvement Project (Appendix 1). The objective of this TA \nwas to formulate long-term business plans for the National Airports Authority and Lao Civil \nAviation  and  transform  them  into  market-oriented  organizations.  This  TA  reviewed  the \noperational and financial procedures, established a computerized financial control system and a \nmanagement  information  system,  and  prepared  comprehensive  manuals  on  financial \naccounting in both organizations. The PCR on the Airports Improvement Project found the \nperformance  of  the  TA  consultants  satisfactory  and  that  the  government  appreciated  the \neffectiveness of the TA. \n \nIV.  EVALUATION OF ADB ASSISTANCE \n68.  Evaluation of the Lao PDR transport sector is based on six evaluation criteria identified \nby  IED's  draft  Revised  Guidelines  for  the  Preparation  of  Country  Assistance  Program \nEvaluations (footnote 2). Overall assessment is based on the cumulative evaluation of strategic \n                                                 \n36 The TA on East\u2013West Economic Corridor Coordination was rated highly successful in the 2008 PPER of the GMS \nEast\u2013West Corridor Project (ADB. 2008. Performance Evaluation Report: Greater Mekong Subregion: East\u2013West \nCorridor Project in the Lao People's Democratic Republic and Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. Manila). \n37 ADB. 2001. Project Performance Audit Report: Fourth and Fifth Road Improvement Projects in the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic. Manila. The report found that none of the intended outputs were available or in use. For \nexample, the TA included development of manuals and guidelines for\u00a0inspection and maintenance of bridges and a \ncentralized  computer-based  bridge  management  information  system.  Such  outputs  were  not  tangible  at \npostevaluation. \n ", "  17\npositioning, relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, sustainability, and development impacts. These \ncriteria are weighted as indicated in para. 164. \n \nA.  Strategic Positioning \n69.  Strategic positioning of the Lao PDR transport sector strategy is satisfactory, with room \nfor improvement in certain areas. The CSP 2007\u20132011 is structured to include transport sector \nfinancing under the regional cooperation umbrella, which has a separate ADF allocation and \nreflected the government's inclination toward regional cooperation. The CSP results framework \nincludes  limited  market  access  and  limited  access  to  infrastructure  as  the  key  constraints \nidentified under the NSEDP 6. To address these constraints, the CSP identifies interventions for \nADB funding during 2007\u20132011. ADB\u2019s core competency of funding road improvement has \nbeen correctly reflected in its strategic position in the Lao PDR. ADB is the lead development \npartner for road subsector and effectively co-chairs the infrastructure working group (para. 36). \nThis provides ADB with an opportunity to add value in the development effectiveness process. \n \n70.  ADB strategies in the Lao PDR have been consistently focused on road improvements \nand provision of all-weather access. Issues related to access to remote areas must be addressed, \nbut the current CSP focus on regional roads appears to overshadow this focus (para. 40). \n \n71.  Appendix 6 provides an assessment of the implementation of past CSPs. It shows ADB's \npropensity to fund both road and airport projects. Funding constraints have slowed the overall \nimplementation of these strategies, including that of the current CSP. For example, although \nADB intended to assist in securing sustainable maintenance of the road network through the \nRMF, there has been no incremental assistance from ADB for improving the sustainability of the \nRMF to prevent overlap with the World Bank\u2019s assistance. \n \n72.  Currently, ADB provides 100% grants to the Lao PDR based on the ADF X policy.38 The \ncurrent CSP is based on the earlier ADF IX policy, which provided up to 50% grants for the country. \nAlthough this has helped the Lao PDR in reducing the impact on its budget, actual ADF funding is \nsubject to the performance-based allocation. The ADF allocation for the Lao PDR for 2007 and 2008 \nwas set at $40.2 million in total compared with $45 million\u2013$55 million per year on average as \nindicated in the CSP 2002\u20132004. In addition, ADF funding of $40.0 million was programmed for the \nGMS Program for 2007\u20132009, or an annual average of about $13.0 million. As per the current \nprogram, the Lao PDR has been provided a biennial allocation of $150.56 million for 2009\u20132010, \nwhich includes an adjustment in response to the global economic crisis. These allocations cover all \nthe sectors of ADB assistance, and the relatively small size of the assistance highlights the funding \nconstraints faced by the transport sector. \n \n73.  To address this funding constraint, ADB has applied selectivity in its programming. \nHowever, there is a disconnect between the assistance (i.e., regional cooperation projects) and \nthe sector road map, which is relatively inward looking. The CSP's pipeline of projects shows \nthat most transport projects will be funded out of the GMS Program, with only one being funded \nthrough the country program (i.e., the Southern Transport Network Project is intended for grant \napproval in 2012). Although the CSP acknowledges investment needs in the transport sector \n(e.g., road safety and enforcement of social and environmental safeguards), there is no clear \nstrategy  to  provide  funding  in  these  areas.  Further,  the  CSP's  transport  sector  road  map \ncomprises sector-wide output indicators (e.g., provinces without all-weather road access, share \nof paved national highways, paved roads in general, and increase in maintenance funding) that \n                                                 \n38 The ninth replacement of ADF, ADB\u2019s major source of concessional financing, covering the period from 2009 to 2012. \n ", "18   \nare specific and measurable, but the corresponding outcome indicators are difficult to measure. \nFor example, road transport user costs and access in the rainy season need to be measured \nusing a consistent tool before the start of CSP and at completion. The CSP, however, does not \nprovide the source of these data, making it difficult to monitor these outcomes. \n \n74.  ADB  has  appropriately  adopted  an  integrated  approach  for  designing  agriculture \nprojects, and often combines rural roads with agriculture sector interventions. Para. 56 details \nthe implementation performance of the rural roads that have been included within the scope of \nagriculture projects. This integrated approach has enabled complementary investments in the \nrural  roads  and  agriculture  subsectors,  which  contributed  to  positive  impacts  such  as \ndiversification of incomes made possible by the road improvement.39 In view of this, it is prudent \nfor ADB to continue this integrated project design. However, this needs to be planned and \nimplemented, taking into account the following factors: \n(i)  Ensure that the rural roads are in line with the wider MPWT network rehabilitation \nprogram. This will enable sector-wide connectivity and link rural areas with the \nnational economy. \n(ii)  The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and MPWT need to coordinate with each \nother  at  programming  stage  to  prioritize  road  rehabilitation  projects.  This  is \ncrucial to ensure synergies among the subsectors. \n(iii)  Improve  coordination  within  ADB.  Transport  and  agriculture  divisions  of  the \nSoutheast Asia Department need to coordinate with each other at programming \nstage to capture the synergies at the country level. \n(iv)  Ensure sustainability of the rural roads by policy dialogue and improving local \ncapacities (para. 111). \n(v)  Recognize the limited capacity at the district and provincial levels while designing \ncomplex projects. \n(vi)  Use appropriate road construction technology that will ensure cost-effectiveness \nand will match the demand in terms of traffic volume and composition. \n \n75.  ADB has had limited involvement in the inland waterways sector and even less so in the \nrailways. Taking into consideration the limited funding available through the country program as \nwell as through the regional cooperation window and its core competencies, it is deemed \nappropriate that ADB focuses its assistance on the road subsector. \n \nB.  Relevance \n76.  The Lao PDR transport sector assistance is relevant based on (i) the degree to which ADB \nassistance was consistent with country needs and ADB strategic priorities, (ii) the quality-at-entry \nof ADB assistance, and (iii) harmonization with development partners. These subcriteria are \nclosely linked with those for strategic positioning. While relevance is focused on the assistance \nprogram of loans, grants, and TA projects, strategic positioning assesses the coherence and the \nstrategic bearing of the subsectors. The rating for the relevance of the transport sector assistance \nwas affected by the quality-at-entry, which is discussed in paras. 80\u201383. \n \n77.  ADB assistance has focused on the road subsector since the early 1990s. ADB projects \nhave  been  drawn  from  the  list  of  projects  planned  by  the  government  as  part  of  its \nsocioeconomic  development  plans.  Transport  infrastructure  development  has  long  been \nperceived as the main remedy for the country's economic constraints. ADB has successfully \ncontributed to this need by funding road infrastructure in various parts of the country. ADB \n                                                 \n39 ADB. 2007. Completion Report: Shifting Cultivation Stabilization Pilot Project in the Lao People's Democratic \nRepublic. Manila. \n ", "  19\nassistance has typically been focused on upgrading the national trunk roads to provide cross-\ncountry connections to the PRC and Thailand. Such assistance has formed 67% of the loan \nportfolio. Since 2000, ADB has also provided funding for rural roads in an effort to enhance \npoverty reduction by providing access to rural areas. \n \n78.  Early national road projects were located in both northern as well as southern areas of the \ncountry.  The  focus  on  regional  cooperation  and  integration  created  a  further  geographical \ndispersion of projects, since the Lao PDR aimed to become the regional hub with connections \nfrom all directions. While this has provided a major contribution to developing the national road \nnetwork, it would be difficult to attribute any specific impact of ADB assistance to any part of the \ncountry, as other development agencies have also been funding roads in the same geographical \nareas. The CSP 2007\u20132011 mentions that projects have witnessed high transaction costs due to \nthe  number  of  relatively  small  projects  throughout  the  country  causing  heavy  administrative \nburdens to the MPWT. This calls for a geographical concentration of the subprojects, especially \nsince the rehabilitation of the national road network has progressed substantially. Moreover, it \nwould be easier for the rural road subsector to have a more focused approach. \n \n79.  The Lao PDR's socioeconomic development plans have been consistent in their focus on \nroad development. In 2001, the government identified a basic development strategy up to 2020. \nOne of its main goals was to modernize economic and social basic infrastructure to facilitate \nregional and international integration (footnote 15). ADB projects have generally been rationalized \nalong the same lines, as they have been aimed at reducing transport constraints and stimulating \nagriculture development. This rationale has evolved in the last 10 years since the initiation of the \nXieng Khouang Road Improvement Project and the East\u2013West Economic Corridor Project. This \nhas coincided with the government's inclination toward regional integration as identified in the \ngoals of the Socioeconomic Development Strategy, 2001\u20132010, which seeks to \"improve and \nestablish the basis for the economy to progress strongly in firm steps \u2026. develop our country to \nbecome the central point of transit of the region in the future\u201d (footnote 15). \n \n80.  The importance of rural development continues, as reflected in a goal of NSEDP, 2006\u2013\n2010, which aims \"to reduce the disparities between rural areas and urban centers, enhance the \ntransport and communications networks and improve the living conditions of the rural people, \nespecially those in mountainous and remote areas\" (footnote 17). In other words, there is a \nneed to balance the investments for regional integration (external links) with those for ensuring \nall-weather access to remote areas (internal links). ADB assistance has included two projects \nfor rural roads during 2000\u20132007, and such funding must continue. The inclusion of regional \nprogram in the ADB portfolio should not be at the cost of country program, especially that \ntargeted at rural road development. \n \n81.  A midterm review of the NSEDP 6 was carried out by the government in November \n2008.40 This review stated that the most disadvantaged areas in terms of access to roads and \nsocial services remain the central southern and northern highlands and the northern lowlands. \nThus, it advocated higher priority for constructing all-weather roads to Phongsali, Salavan, and \nXaibouly provinces. The review also showed a significant variance across areas in term of per \ncapita public investment. In the northern region, which is less developed, the public investment \nper capita expenditure was KN252,000 per person, compared with KN144,000 per person in the \nsouthern region, which is relatively better economically developed. This has been attributed to \ndiscrepancy in development funding among the various geographic areas. \n \n                                                 \n40 Government of the Lao PDR. 2008.

The quality of the design and monitoring frameworks in the reports and recommendation \nof the President (RRPs) and PCRs can be improved, especially in relation to the indicators for \noutcomes and impacts. Efforts have been made by ADB to improve the quality since 2009. Output \nindicators for all transport assistance have been specific and measurable, typically in terms of \nlength of roads improved. The outcome indicators have varied, with typical ones being economic \ninternal rates of return (EIRRs), traffic, vehicle operating costs, and time savings. In most cases, \nthese indicators have been generally improved. However, several PCRs did not provide specific \ntime-bound indicators for outcomes, which prevent their evaluation. Targeted impacts have been \nbroad, such as improvement in gross domestic product and social indicators. The attribution of the \nproject to these indicators is an issue, and difficulties associated with consistent measurement of \nindicators remain, e.g., the nature of social indicators varies among different projects. \n \n83.  ADB transport sector assistance has generally been harmonized with other development \npartners,  but  areas  of  improvement  remain.  Recently,  ADB  has  taken  the  lead  in  donor \ncoordination efforts by co-chairing the infrastructure sector working group along with MPWT and \nthe Embassy of Japan. This working group, with others, was set up in June 2005 to harmonize \ndevelopment agency efforts. The midterm review of the NSEDP 6 expressed concern over \nthese working groups \"losing momentum, lacking a clear mandate and a work plan\" (footnote \n40).  Discussions  with  the  World  Bank  and  Sida  indicated  that  meetings  have  been  held, \nalthough no tangible output is visible apart from the harmonization of investment planning, \nwhich had been continuing. \n \n84.  Some of the lessons from earlier projects have been incorporated into the improvements \nin  the  project  design  and  implementation  efficiency  but  there  remains  room  for  further \nimprovement.  A  project  performance  audit  report  of  the  Vientiane  Plain  Road  Improvement \nProject, completed as early as 1989, recommended that ADB should monitor the executing \nagency's institutional development.41 Even today, MPWT continues to face institutional capacity \nconstraints. In 1997, the project performance audit report on the Third Road Improvement Project \nreiterated  a  recommendation  for  institutional  reforms,  which  are  now  being  carried  out.  All \nevaluation reports have been unanimous in recommending the need for adequate maintenance. \nHowever, this area continues to be strained due to funding constraints (paras. 108\u2013112). \n \nC.  Efficiency \n85.  ADB  assistance  is  less  efficient  based  on  the  portfolio  performance  and  economic \nviability of the projects. Portfolio performance is based on the assessment of implementation \npunctuality and cost overruns. Further, EIRRs measure the net economic benefits of ADB \nassistance and are typically benchmarked against a yardstick opportunity cost of capital of 12% \n(i.e., projects with EIRRs of more than 12% are considered efficient and those with EIRRs of \nmore than 18% are considered highly efficient). \n \n86.  Based on the EIRR criterion alone, out of the 5 completed ADB road projects between \n2000 and 2009, 1 project was found to be highly efficient, 3 were efficient, and 1 was less efficient \nas  reported  in  previous  evaluation  reports.  Two  of  these  projects  were  self-evaluated.  The \nefficiency ratings of the first four projects did not consider their implementation performance in the \nrating although these projects also had implementation issues. A recent evaluation by IED found \nthe Rural Access Roads Project to be less efficient, owing to a combination of low economic \nbenefits accrued and implementation efficiency issues. Since ADB assistance has been mainly for \n                                                 \n41 The executing agency comprised a combination of MCPTC (now referred as MPWT) and the Vientiane Provincial \nPublic Works Department (ADB. 1989. Project Performance Audit Report: Vientiane Plain Road Improvement \nProject in the Lao People's Democratic Republic. Manila). \n ", "  21\nnational roads connecting domestic economic centers, earlier projects witnessed higher EIRRs at \ncompletion as compared with those expected at appraisal because there has been a faster-than-\nexpected  growth  in  traffic  on  those  roads.  On  the  other  hand,  national  roads  connecting \ninternational borders, i.e., regional roads that were expected to generate cross-border traffic have \nwitnessed lower-than-expected performance, being constrained by delayed implementation of the \ncross-border  transport  agreements  (footnote  36).  Similarly,  rural  access  roads  have  seen \nrelatively slower growth in traffic, resulting in lower EIRRs. The overall sector evaluation is based \non both the EIRR as well as the portfolio performance. \n \n87.  The lower economic viability of rural roads and, to a certain extent, of regional roads is \nexpected. For rural roads, the PPER for Rural Access Roads Project showed that (i) more time \nis needed for a road project benefits to be captured by residents in rural areas; and (ii) other \ninterventions are essential for rural road improvement benefits to be captured by the people, \nsuch  as  those  related  to  agriculture  and  alternative  livelihood  development.  Further,  road \nimprovement alone is not sufficient to ensure economic benefits. Regarding regional roads, \nlegal and regulatory factors governing cross-border movement need to be addressed before the \nexpected economic benefits can be realized (footnote 36). \n \n88.  Portfolio  performance.  Paras.  49\u201355  analyze  the  performance  of  program \nimplementation.  The  majority  of  the  transport  projects  have  witnessed  cost  overruns  and \nimplementation delays. The cost overruns, which were caused by higher-than-expected bid \nprices, have typically been accompanied by changes in project scope to accommodate funding \nconstraints. Para. 53 analyzes the causes of implementation delays. Although several of these \nfactors have been addressed, issues remain, such as contractor problems and counterpart \nfunding delays. These are expected to be addressed through close cooperation between the \nSoutheast Asia Department's Transport Division and the resident mission as well as between \nADB and various government departments. \n \n89.  Overall, the implementation performance of the transport projects has been less efficient \n(para. 50). Because MPWT and ADB are now more familiar with each other's procedures and the \nuse of project-readiness filters, the implementation efficiency could improve for future projects. \n \n90.  Loan savings. Three projects witnessed loan savings owing to the depreciation of the \nkip: the Xieng Khouang Road Improvement Project, East\u2013West Economic Corridor Project, and \nRural Access Roads Project. In the case of the East\u2013West Economic Corridor Project, instead \nof the three original rural roads, a total of nine roads were rehabilitated with the extra loan \nsavings. In the Xieng Khouang Road Improvement Project and the Rural Access Roads Project, \nthe loan savings were used to rehabilitate additional feeder roads. In the East\u2013West Economic \nCorridor Project, the rehabilitation of the Kaysone Phomvihane\u2013Xeno road (additional work) \nmeant that about 32% of the total project cost was outside of the original scope and beyond the \neconomic appraisal before rehabilitation. \n \n91.  While including the additional works could have been defensible, ADB did not carry out \nadequate economic analysis of the additional works at completion to check whether the loan \nsavings  had  been  used  efficiently.  The  inclusion  of  additional  works  was  subjected  to \npreliminary  environmental  and  social  assessments,  which  were  followed  up  during \nimplementation  by  the  supervision  consultants.  The  approvals  for  the  reallocation  of  loan \nproceeds were carried out as per ADB instructions.42 \n \n                                                 \n42 ADB. 2003. Reallocating Loan Proceeds. Project Administration Instructions. PAI 5.05. Revised August 2005. Manila. \n ", "22   \nD.  Effectiveness \n92.  The contribution of ADB assistance to the Lao PDR transport sector is effective, based on \nthe  extent  to  which  the  ADB  program  achieved  sector-specific  outcomes  and  institutional \ndevelopment outcomes. Typically, the majority of the outputs from road subsector projects can be \nsummarized in terms of physical accomplishments, such as km of road improved or constructed, \nnumbers of bridges improved or built, and/or km of road maintained. Outcomes of individual road \nprojects, though, are project-specific. The physical accomplishments have resulted in reduction in \ntravel time between key economic centers in the country, as well as between the rural areas and \nthe cities. This has contributed to enabling improvement in trade within the country, as well as \nexternally. It has also led to increased investments in tourism, agriculture, and manufacturing. \n \n93.  While these benefits are generic, the demand for transport services in the Lao PDR \nremains low, since production is yet to develop at the same pace as the development of \nphysical infrastructure (footnote 36). The NSEDP 6 (footnote 17) states that the limited capacity \ncannot make efficient use of the investments and \"results in waste and a reduction of cost-\neffectiveness of investments.\" While this reduces the economic viability of the projects, the \nbenefits in terms of all-weather connectivity, reduced travel times, and access to markets and \nbasic productive assets remain important for inclusive development. \n \n94.  ADB's  policy  dialogue  has  been  effective  in  shaping  the  RMF,  supporting  capacity \ndevelopment, mitigating HIV/AIDS  linked to transport improvement projects, and promoting \nregional  cooperation.  This  dialogue  has  been  supported  by  investment  projects  and  TA. \nHowever, room for improvement in capacity development remains, as confirmed by the CSP \n2007\u20132011, which states that ADB's efforts at capacity development in core areas have not \nbeen effective in enhancing institutional performance (e.g., safeguard implementation, rural road \nnetwork expansion, and maintenance planning and funding). This has been confirmed by IED's \nfield assessment, which found that the performance of MPWT and DPWTs continues to be \naffected due to lack of adequate human resources.  \n \n95.  All completed ADB projects were effective in reducing transport costs and travel time \n(Appendix 1). In the case of the Sixth Road Improvement Project, one of the objectives was to \nprivatize road construction and road transport units that formerly were owned and operated \ndirectly by the central and local governments. This was partly effective, since the privatization \nprocess has been progressing slowly. \n \n96.  The only rural roads assistance (Rural Access Roads Project) that has been completed \nwas effective in achieving its targeted outcomes (footnote 3). All subprojects, except one, were \neffective since they were successful in improving the access among farm-based communities, \nnational and provincial roads, and market centers. Transport costs and travel times on all \nsubproject roads declined considerably. The main reason for the less effective rating for one \ncomponent was that traffic on one road was below the forecast levels owing to the dearth of \neconomic activities and investments in the project area. This indicates that road improvement is \na necessary, but not sufficient, condition for economic development. \n \n97.  ADB assistance has also included periodic maintenance of roads in the Lao PDR. \nHowever, postevaluation studies have not been able to ascertain the specific effectiveness of \nthese projects, since ADB funding was fungible and was added to the pool of MPWT resources. \nDiscussions  with  the  RMF  secretariat  indicated  that  ADB  assistance  has  been  useful  in \ncontributing to the road maintenance efforts. \n \n ", "  23\n98.  The PCRs and selected PPERs have rated all projects effective. The Third, Fourth, \nand Fifth Road Improvement projects were developed in a phased manner to rehabilitate the \n500-km road between Vientiane and Louangphrabang. This road, National Road 13, is one of \nthe most important roads in the Lao PDR and provides connectivity between Vientiane and the \nnorthern  provinces.  Similarly,  other  projects  have  contributed  to  all-weather  connectivity  in \nsouthern and western parts of the country. The most recently completed project, the GMS: \nNorthern Economic Corridor Project, links the PRC with Thailand via the Lao PDR's Louang \nNamtha Province. This project has been effective in reducing transport costs and providing \nall-weather  access  to  an  important  trade  route.  However,  these  benefits  have  been \naccompanied by migration and social issues (para. 147). \n \n99.  Regarding institutional development outcomes, room for improvement remains. There \nhas been progress in (i) project management within MPWT, (ii) delegation of maintenance \nactivities  to  provincial  levels,  (iii)  countrywide  road  data  collection,  (iv)  prioritization  of \nexpenditures based on road roughness for national roads, (v) improved development agency \ncoordination, and (vi) improvement in technical and financial management skills in MPWT. \nDespite this progress, institutional performance needs to be improved, due to inherent capacity \nproblems  and  sustainability  issues  (para.  111).  Moreover,  effectiveness  of  capacity \ndevelopment assistance is rated on the lower side due to the policy of capacity substitution. A \nspecial  evaluation  study  found  that  the  objectives  and  outcomes  of  capacity  development \nassistance were not articulated in ways that allowed any focusing of resources and inputs either \nto attain these goals or to monitor and assess outcomes.43 This was especially true about ADB \nassistance in the 1990s, when capacity development was equated with delivering consulting \nservices and training. In the last 10 years, ADB assistance has improved, with value addition in \nareas such as formulating policy guidelines and training for maintenance planning. However, the \nabsence of any TA in the last 10 years has paused ADB's efforts. \n \n100.  ADB provided TA for Strengthening Social and Environmental Management Capacity in \nthe DOR, which was completed in 2005. A postevaluation carried out in 2009 rated the TA less \neffective (footnote 3). The PPER stated that the social side of the MPWT mandate has been \ndiluted since the Environment and Social Division has been moved from DOR to the Public Works \nand Transport Institute. The division is now called the Environmental Division, implying the lower \nimportance of the social aspect. While the TA included training on social and environmental \nassessments, the division's social side remained deficient and less effective owing to the lack of \nhuman resources. This issue is linked to wider sector-level issues: (i) the local university needs to \nhave a structured program so that basic capacity in social and environmental disciplines is built, \nand (ii) capacity-building efforts have not led to human resources development and have been \nrelegated to training in implementation of specific safeguard procedures. \n \n101.  Local  capacity  development  is  typically  being  done  through  on-the-job  training  for \nenvironment  assessment  and  environmental  management  plan  implementation,  which  is \nimparted by project supervision consultants. Other development partners, including the World \nBank and Sida, have supported capacity building in areas such as maintenance planning. The \ntraining provided for social and environmental issues has been limited to safeguard documents, \nlimiting the overall institutional development in these areas. \n \n102.  The new Environmental Division has eight staff members, out of whom only two have \ndegrees in an environment-related field; four are engineers by training; and two are non-engineers \n                                                 \n43 ADB. 2004.

Although the division expects to improve its resources in the short \nterm, the current situation prevents it from adding value to the implementation of projects in the \ncountry and results in a continued reliance on external consultants. Overall, the institutional \ndevelopment efforts have been less effective in environmental and social areas. This is reflected \nin the current draft of the transport sector strategy being prepared by MPWT, which states that \nthere  is  a  need  for  institutional  strengthening,  including  human  resources  development, \nmechanisms for effective management, and means of attracting resources from all sources for the \ndevelopment of the sector with a mechanism for checks and balances (footnote 6). \n \nE.

ADB assistance to the Lao PDR transport sector is likely to be sustainable based on an \nassessment  of  government  financing  of  the  recurrent  costs,  cost  recovery  of  the  projects, \ninstitutional arrangements, and past experience of road maintenance in the country that indicates \nthe level of risk. The road subsector has gone through a change in terms of creating awareness \nfor better road maintenance. Currently, the commitment and willingness of MPWT to engage in \nfinding solutions to this problem are high. However, MPWT continues to be constrained by the \nlack of funding allocations, as well as capacity at the provincial and district levels. \n \n104.  The draft transport sector strategy (footnote 6) states that the total need for road funding \nover 2008\u20132015 is KN27,103 billion ($3.2 billion), of which KN10,548 billion ($1.2 billion) is for \nroad maintenance, and KN16,555 billion ($2 billion) is for road upgrading and expansion. The \nstrategy admits that these figures are far beyond the funds available, increasing the overall \nsustainability risk. \n \n105.  As stated previously, most ADB assistance has been channeled toward rehabilitating \nnational roads and highways. The maintenance of national roads is funded from the RMF, which \nallocates 90% of its revenues to national roads. The remaining revenues are allocated for \nmaintenance of provincial, district, and rural roads. The midterm review of the CSP 2007\u20132011 \n(footnote 24) stated that the RMF provides just 45% of the requirements for maintaining national \nroads,  but  discussions  with  the  RMF  secretariat  in  2009  indicated  that  all  the  current \nrequirements of national road maintenance are fulfilled by the RMF. The RMF depends heavily \non development agency funding, which currently forms 37% of the overall funding. Sources of \nRMF revenues comprise fuel levy, bridge tolls, heavy vehicle surcharges, overweight fines, and \ninternational transit fees. The fuel levy forms the bulk of these revenues. MPWT intends to \ngradually increase the fuel levy from the current KN300 per liter, as it is estimated that the RMF \nwill be self-sufficient only if the fuel levy is increased by at least KN50 per liter every year. As \nsuch, the government has increased the fuel levy at the rate of KN50 per liter consistently over \nthe last 5 years. MPWT has provided assurances for a continued rise of this levy in the future \nuntil the RMF becomes self-sufficient. These assurances are backed by an expansion in the \nsources of RMF revenues to include contributions from hydropower and mining projects. \n \n106.  MPWT's draft transport sector strategy states that the government's first priority will be to \npreserve the existing operational roads by providing sufficient funds to maintain satisfactory road \nconditions, particularly for national roads (footnote 6). Thus, it can be inferred that the government \nintends to allocate sufficient funds for maintenance before further expanding the network. \n \n107.  Appendix 9 provides a review of the literature surrounding the RMF. A World Bank \nIndependent Evaluation Group study on road funding strategies of various countries assessed \nthe  RMF  especially  successful  in  that  fund  collections  were  efficiently  allocated  to  road \n ", "  25\nmaintenance.44 The RMF has steadily improved its efficiency and effectiveness since 2001, but \ncannot yet be declared a complete success. The RMF follows the general principles of the \nsecond-generation  type  of  road  funds  established  under  the  broader  context  of  road \nmanagement reforms and limited resources. Its creation provides the mechanism by which user \ncharges are pooled to a dedicated fund with priority given to road maintenance. A decree, which \nestablished  the  RMF  advisory  board,  included  members  representing  both  the  public  and \nprivate sectors. All of these aspects point to a good fund structure. However, for this structure to \nsucceed, it needs to receive adequate revenue. Moreover, institutional issues within the RMF \nneed  to  be  addressed  in  terms  of  further  improvements  in  human  resources,  financial \nmanagement, and maintenance procedures. \n \n108.  Taking into account the above analysis, the RMF appears to be improving and could \nensure the sustainability of the national roads. Moreover, the demand for national roads will \nalways be higher as compared with other roads. This will enable the national roads to obtain a \nlarger share of government allocations for maintenance, which could, however, take place at the \ncost of the provincial and rural roads. \n \n109.  The likelihood of sustainability of rural roads is lower as compared to that of national \nroads.  Rural  road  maintenance  depends  on  allocations  from  provincial  governments  and \nvoluntary work carried out by village maintenance committees. These committees comprise \ngroups of local residents who have been nominated to carry out routine maintenance of rural \nroads. However, in most cases, they do not get any funding from the provincial or district \ngovernments. As a result, this work is carried out on a voluntary basis. This results in a lack of \nconsistent routine maintenance, affecting road condition. \n \n110.  Thus, as stated previously, the actual funds allocation for provincial, district, and rural \nroads continues to be short of the requirements. This has increased the risk of deterioration of \nrecently rehabilitated roads. With the low traffic, maintenance of those roads also remains low in \nthe order of funding priority. This increases the risk of sustainability of continued funding. \n \n111.  In  addition,  the  institutional  capacity  of  MPWT  and  the  DPWTs  continues  to  be \nconstrained by the lack of adequate resources. The dependence on consultants for project \npreparation  and  implementation  continues.  Although  MPWT  has  awarded  maintenance \ncontracts for national roads, no such contracts are being discussed for rural roads. With the \nrecent policy of decentralization, the DPWTs are expected to become centers for planning and \nbudgeting  activities  for  the  districts'  socioeconomic  plans,  requiring  a  definitive  building  of \ntechnical  and  administrative  capacities  at  the  district  and  provincial  levels.  Planning  and \nimplementing maintenance programs at the district level will require additional manpower and \nfunding resources, both of which are currently falling short. \n \n112.  Finally, the government's commitment and willingness to maintain transport assets are \nstrong.  One  of  the  goals  of  the  NSEDP  6  is  to  \"ensure  the  maintenance  of  existing \ninfrastructure;  establish  additional  infrastructure  specifically  to  support  the  socioeconomic \ndevelopment activities aiming to promote trade, investment, and tourism\" (footnote 17). This \nrequires substantial investments backed up by sustained maintenance, which is currently a \nmatter of concern for rural roads. \n \n                                                 \n44 H.

In view of the above, rural road assistance is less likely to be sustainable, but national \nroad assistance is likely to be sustainable. Overall, since the majority of the sector assistance \ncomprises national roads, ADB assistance is likely to be sustainable. \n \nF.  Impact \n114.  ADB's  contributions  to  development  impacts  specific  to  the  transport  sector  are \nsubstantial. This assessment measures the extent to which ADB's cumulative interventions \ncontributed  to  the  Lao  PDR's  long-term  development  results.  Although  it  is  difficult  to \ndisaggregate the specific impact of ADB assistance in the development context, the impact \nassessment analyzes the sector-wide positive and negative impacts linked to road improvement \nin the Lao PDR. These impacts are assessed across ADB's transport portfolio in the following \nkey thematic areas: poverty reduction, trade and tourism, health, vehicle overloading and safety, \nagricultural development, environmental impact, and impact on indigenous peoples. Appendix \n10 provides a summary of the impact of each completed project. \n \n115.  Poverty reduction. Poverty in the Lao PDR is defined by a poverty line based on the \nlevel of per capita household consumption considered necessary to meet minimum dietary \nneeds, such as the level of per capita food consumption needed to purchase a typical food \nbasket. ADB assistance for the funding of national road improvement did not have a direct \nrationale  of  poverty  reduction,  since  these  projects  were  justified  more  along  the  lines  of \nconnectivity and support to agricultural development. Poverty reduction had been an indirect \nimpact targeted by these projects, until ADB ventured into the rural road subsector. The Rural \nAccess Roads Project was the first project that aimed to reduce poverty by providing access to \nmarket, education, and health facilities.  \n \n116.  The link between road improvement and poverty reduction falls into two basic schools of \nthought. The first states that significant poverty reduction has been achieved in the Lao PDR, \nand a proportion of this can be statistically attributed to improvement in rural transport access. \nThe second argues that road improvement has led to economic growth but not necessarily to \npoverty reduction. \n \n117.  Several  studies  have  indicated  that  road  improvement  has  contributed  to  poverty \nreduction.45  Most  studies  have  analyzed  the  link  between  improved  access  and  poverty \nreduction. Access is typically measured in terms of travel time, effort involved, and cost of travel. \nA key point is that people with capital were most able to benefit from the new opportunities \ncreated by rural infrastructure.46 \n \n118.  In  2005,  Warr  concluded  that  between  1997\u20131998  and  2002\u20132003,  rural  poverty \nincidence in the Lao PDR declined by 9.5%, despite some macroeconomic conditions mitigating \nthe interests of rural people.47 It estimated that about 13.0% of this decline can be attributed to \nimproved road access alone. Another factor included public investment in irrigation facilities. \nWarr found that by providing rural areas with dry season road access, rural poverty incidence \ncould be reduced by 3.0%. A further reduction of 2.0% could be obtained by providing all rural \nhouseholds with all-weather road access. \n                                                 \n45 ADB, National Statistical Centre of the Committee for Planning and Investment, Sida, and the World Bank. 2006. \nLao PDR Poverty Assessment Report: From Valleys to Hilltops\u201415 Years of Poverty Reduction.

Road Development and Poverty Reduction: The Case of Lao PDR. ADB Institute Discussion Paper \nNo. 25. Tokyo: ADB Institute. \n ", "  27\n \n119.  An  Institute  of  Development  Economics  study  by  Oraboune  linked  rural  road \nimprovement with poverty reduction in Attapeu, Houaphan, Louangphrabang, Savannakhet, and \nXiangkhouang  provinces,  all  of  which  have  benefited  from  ADB  assistance.48  The  study \nconcluded that there is a close link between villages connected by roads and poverty reduction \nthrough increased income opportunities to rural people. However, it stated that the provision of \nroads alone is not sufficient to ensure these impacts. Other requirements include providing \nagriculture extension works, ensuring agricultural market information, and creating awareness of \nthe benefits that they could gain from improved roads. \n \n120.  The Lao PDR has witnessed considerable improvement of its national roads as well. The \ndevelopment of National Road 13 between Vientiane and Louangphrabang contributed to the \npoverty  reduction  efforts  in  northern  Lao  PDR.  With  the provision  of  connectivity  between \nVientiane  and  the  northern  provinces,  there  has  been  a  major  contribution  to  economic \ndevelopment in these areas. Similar results were found by a survey carried out as part of the \nPPER for the Champasack Road Improvement Project in southern Lao PDR, which indicated an \nimprovement in income levels and job opportunities.49 \n \n121.  Breaking  away  from  the  above  studies,  another  school  of  thought  differentiates \neconomic  development  from  poverty  reduction,  arguing  that  road  improvement  might  not \nnecessarily lead to poverty reduction. Evidence from the Rural Access Roads Project provides \nthe case for this argument. First, poverty needs to be defined correctly and consistently. Relying \nstrictly on statistical definitions could introduce a bias from the originating institution. On the \nother hand, qualitative studies could be influenced by prevailing themes, which could change \nover time. Thus, a balance of quantitative and qualitative techniques is required that adopt a \nconsistent  methodology  over  several  years.  Moreover,  poverty  needs  to  be  defined  at \nhousehold, village, or community levels and needs to be consistent with the national definition. \n \n122.  In the case of the Rural Access Roads Project, villages in the project area, mostly \npopulated by various ethnic minority groups, witnessed poverty reduction, albeit on a differential \nbasis. A socioeconomic assessment carried out by IED found that some of these groups (e.g., \nHmong groups) were able to take advantage of the road improvement. However, the Khmu and \nBahnar groups had been the recipients of limited incremental economic benefits. \n \n123.  Two conclusions emerged from the impact assessment: (i) more time is needed for \nproject benefits to be captured by residents in rural areas; and (ii) other interventions are \nessential for economic benefits to be captured by the people, such as improvement in policies \nfor  land  allocation,  village  consolidation,  opium  cultivation  eradication,  and  eradication  of \nswidden cultivation; agriculture development in terms of improvement of quantity, quality, and \ndiversity of crops; encouragement of crop substitution; and provision of health and education \nservices. \n \n124.  Impact  on  trade  and  tourism.  ADB  assistance  included  two  regional  cooperation \nprojects involving cross-border roads. The East\u2013West Economic Corridor Project, connecting \nthe  Thai  border  with  the  Vietnamese  border  across  southern  Lao  PDR,  was  substantially \ncompleted in 2005. A PPER was carried out in 2008 (footnote 36) to measure the impact of the \n                                                 \n48 S. Oraboune. 2008.

The GMS: Northern Economic Corridor Project was completed in 2009, but the PCR \nhas yet to be prepared. \n \n125.  On the East\u2013West Economic Corridor Project, the impact of the improved Road No. 9 on \ntrade has been modest to substantial, partly because of restrictions on vehicle movements. The \naverage trade value through the Lao Bao crossing improved from $93 million per year during \n1998\u22122000 (before the project) to $100 million per year during 2004\u22122007 (after the project). \nDuring the last decade, the trade value peaked at $148 million in 2007 compared with the \nprevious high of $129 million in 1999. \n \n126.  The PPER for the East\u2013West Economic Corridor Project (footnote 36) describes the \nrelative significance of trade passing through Dansavanh (on the Lao PDR\u2013Viet Nam border) to \nthe total trade nationwide. Following the drop in trade value due to construction, the share of \ntrade through Dansavan to the Lao PDR\u2019s total trade has gradually increased from about 2% \nfrom 2002 to around 5% in 2007. It decreased briefly in 2008 due to the global economic crisis \nbefore recovering again in 2009. Being landlocked, the Lao PDR has been the most dependent \nof the GMS countries on intra-GMS trade and has benefited from the development of the \nregional roads. Regional cooperation in the Lao PDR\u2019s transport sector has led to externalities \nthat benefit neighboring countries in the form of alternative trade routes. It is important for the \nLao PDR to receive a share of these benefits, which could be in the form of transit charges. \nSuch charges are being negotiated and could contribute to the national economy in the future. \n \n127.  The East\u2013West Economic Corridor Project resulted in enhanced connectivity, helping form \nareas of production. A number of factories in the Lao PDR are using Road No. 9 to transport \ngoods to Viet Nam, resulting in improved livelihoods (e.g., diversification of production to other \ncrops) and living standards (with increased production more than consumption) of local residents. \nEast\u2212West transport facilitation (Lao PDR\u2212Thailand\u2212Viet Nam) further opened up markets and \nenabled consumer choices through cheaper prices, and product availability and diversity. Goods \npassing through Road No. 9 are mainly from bilateral trade (Lao PDR\u2013Thailand and Lao PDR\u2013\nViet Nam), as the Lao PDR and Viet Nam have a bilateral agreement to allow residents of border \nvillages to cross the borders freely to trade. This has enabled Dansavan villagers to go night \nshopping at the Lao Bao market or opt to use a Viet Nam hospital for more serious illnesses. \n \n128.  Tourism accounts for a major part of the increased traffic between Thailand and the Lao \nPDR, which has more than doubled since the completion of the East\u2013West Economic Corridor \nProject. For the Lao PDR, the question for the future is how to encourage more of these tourists \nto stay longer and spend more in the country.50 This indicates that the project has contributed to \nsubstantial  changes  in  tourism.  In  summary,  regional  cooperation  projects  contribute \nsubstantially to the macroeconomy. \n \n129.  Impact on health. The construction of roads as well as their subsequent use has been \nlinked to increase in the population's vulnerability to sexually transmitted infections, such as \nHIV/AIDS.51 One study has found a link among economic development in rural areas, mobility, \n                                                 \n50 As part of Japan\u2019s efforts to develop and/or promote the corridor, JICA provided a $1.5 million grant for a tourism \nproject in Kaysone Phomvihane. It aims to address poverty through development of a one village\u2212one product \nprogram (for regional development), along with a one-stop service center near the second Mekong Friendship Bridge. \n51 S.

Mobility and HIV/AIDS in the Greater Mekong Subregion. \nBangkok: Asian Research Center for Migration, Institute of Asian Studies, Chulalongkorn University, in consortium \nwith World Vision Australia and Macfarlane Burnet Centre for Medical Research. \n ", "  29\nand HIV/AIDS along the East\u2013West Economic Corridor.52 The improvement of cross-border \ntransport corridors is known to have the potential to contribute to the spread of HIV/AIDS and \ndrug addiction because of increased mobility and the influx of large numbers of construction \nworkers.  ADB  has  carried  out  case  study  reviews  of  four  transport  projects  in  the  GMS \n(including  the  East\u2013West  Economic  Corridor  Project)  to  provide  key  lessons  and \nrecommendations for tackling the issue.53 These recommendations need to be implemented by \nthe government in close coordination with other development partners. \n \n130.  The initial information from the GMS: Northern Economic Corridor Project indicated a \nmuch worse scenario in terms of sexually transmitted infections. The construction work for \nRoute No. 3 required a large number of skilled and unskilled laborers from the PRC, the Lao \nPDR, and Thailand\u2014mostly men with disposable incomes who work away from their families \nand  traditional  social  norms  for  several  years.  This  increased  the  vulnerability  to  sexually \ntransmitted infections and drug addiction in the construction camps. Even before the project was \ncomplete, the number of people using the road had grown substantially to cross border between \nthe PRC and the Lao PDR, resulting in a distinct increase in the risk of sexually transmitted \ninfections on both sides of the border. \n \n131.  The  issue  of  whether  HIV/AIDS  mitigation  measures  should  be  included  in  project \ndesigns  of  road  improvement  projects  has  yet  to  be  resolved.  Although  the  project  loan \nagreements  for  East\u2013West  Economic  Corridor  Project  and  the  GMS:  Northern  Economic \nCorridor Project included covenants requiring contractors to carry out HIV/AIDS prevention \nactivities, no funding was earmarked specifically for such activities. In addition, the supervision \nconsultants and implementing agencies had limited technical capacity to design and implement \nthese  prevention  activities  adequately.  The  ongoing  Roads  for  Rural  Development  Project \nincludes  a  component  on  awareness  and  prevention  of  HIV/AIDS,  sexually  transmitted \ninfections,  and  drug  use  that  has  been  designed  and  implemented  through  the  National \nCommittee  for  Control  of  AIDS  and  the  provincial  committees  for  AIDS  control.  The \neffectiveness of this component will be assessed upon project completion. \n \n132.  To  specifically  address  HIV  mitigation,  ADB  funded  the  HIV/AIDS  and  sexually \ntransmitted  infections,  Drug  and  People  Trafficking  Awareness  and  Prevention  Education \nProgram, which was designed as a standalone project to address the potential spread of \nHIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections, as well as drug and human trafficking, through \ncomprehensive prevention activities supporting risk-reduction behavior. The program comprised \nawareness  raising  among  villagers,  construction  workers,  and  service  workers  as  well  as \ncapacity building, while more activities specifically focused on prevention targeted construction \nworkers, local communities, and mobile service workers (footnote 53). This program is ongoing. \n \n133.  Vehicle  overloading  and  road  safety.  Improvement  of  roads  has  also  led  to \ndeterioration of road safety due to increased vehicle overloading and traffic accidents. Vehicle \noverloading results in a decrease in the design life of the road pavement and increases the risk \nof accidents. PPERs have noted a continual incidence of axle loads in excess of the maximum \nlegal axle load limit.54 It is recognized that (i) MPWT faces constraints in terms of the number of \nweigh bridges; and (ii) on the roads where weigh bridges do exist, there is no strict enforcement. \n                                                 \n52 Handicap International. 2006.

Manila. \n ", "30   \nThese issues need to be addressed comprehensively to ensure that the economic value of the \nroad pavement is sustained. The Roads for Rural Development Project includes a component \nfor axle load control equipment. However, MPWT has not used this funding. \n \n134.  Road improvements typically result in higher speeds for vehicles, to which have been \nattributed increased traffic accidents and fatalities. With increasing populations living along \nroads, this issue has been exacerbated. The main causes of these accidents are (i) lack of \nenforcement of posted speed limits and lack of appreciation by drivers of the rationale for speed \nlimits;  (ii)  increasing  pedestrian  traffic,  both  crossing  and  along  the  roadway;  (iii)  lack  of \nadequate shoulder width for vehicular stops and parking; and (iv) continued breakdown of the \nedges of shoulders. \n \n135.  Road accident statistics from MPWT show that motorcycles account for highest accident \nrates followed by cars, pickups, and others.55 From 2000 to 2008, the average number of fatalities \nper 10,000 vehicles was 9\u201315 persons per year. Most of the victims were 19\u201331 years of age, \nwith the highest rate between 25 and 30 years old. The intensity of accidents has increased in the \nrecent years, with the fatalities per accident increasing from 0.08 in 2002 to 0.10 in 2007, and the \ninjuries per accident increasing from 1.36 in 2002 to 1.45 in 2007. \n \n136.  The observed trend in road traffic safety in the Lao PDR generally mirrors the experiences \nof its neighboring countries as a result of improved road surfaces. Poor road safety and high \nnumbers of accidents, injuries, and fatalities are also serious, growing problems in Cambodia and \nViet Nam. For the two neighbors, traffic accidents are usually caused by speeding, misuse of \ndrugs and breach of traffic regulations, poor traffic management, and/or the mix of high- and low-\nspeed vehicles on the same road. Among the three neighbors, Cambodia reported the highest \nfatality rate in 2009.56 The fatality per 100,000 inhabitants for the Lao PDR of 12.4 was only \nslightly better than for Cambodia and Viet Nam. In terms of fatality rate per 10,000 vehicles in \n2009, the ratio of 8.6 for the Lao PDR was higher than Viet Nam but lower than Cambodia. These \nfigures have been worsening over the last few years. \n \n137.  Value addition by ADB in terms of road safety needs to go beyond the provision of \ntraditional hardware like traffic signs and signals, street lights, road markings, center lines and \nbarriers, and speed reduction strips. In addition to road shoulder widening, more needs to be \ndone  in  the  areas  of  driver  education,  vehicle  inspection,  licensing,  and  traffic  regulation \nenforcement. On the latter, inefficient law enforcement has been a root cause of the traffic \nsafety problem for Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam. Project experiences indicate that the \neffectiveness of ADB assistance can be enhanced if it is able to build on a vigorous regime of \nlaw enforcement by local authorities. \n \n138.  Agricultural development. Road improvement has contributed to an increase in crop \ndiversification  as  well  as  a  general  rise  in  agricultural  production.  In  the  area  around  the \nChampasack Road Improvement Project, before the project, farmers used to grow one rice crop \nper year and could manage their livelihoods with it. After road improvement, with better access \nto markets, farmers have been attempting to produce two rice crops per year. This has been \nhampered, however, by the lack of irrigation and by the high cost of installing irrigation systems. \nIn other cases, farmers have diversified into growing cash crops, such as tobacco, with high \nprofit  margins.  An  unexpected  benefit  of  the  project  has  been  that  the  traders  have  now \n                                                 \n55 Office of Roads and Bridges, Department of Public Works and Transport.

Phnom Penh (September). \n ", "  31\norganized a transport service wherein their trucks pick up agricultural produce directly from the \nfarms. A similar situation exists on the Community-Managed Irrigation Sector Project.57 After \nproject completion, rice was no longer grown on steep slopes, and there is a growing trend to \ngrow cash crops where new roads have improved access to markets. While these cash crops \ndo provide income for farmers, the potential for ecological damage remains high.58 Moreover, \nthe importance of rural transport is underlined by the fact that improvement in this subsector \nfacilitates temporary labor migration from rural areas, allowing farm families to remain partly \nengaged in agriculture activities simultaneously with wage and nonfarm employment. \n \n139.  The 2008 World Development Report stated that inadequate transport infrastructure and \nservices in rural areas tend to push up marketing costs, undermining local markets and exports.59 \nHowever, it also stated that benefits of road improvement depend heavily on interactions with \nother infrastructure and geographical, community, and household characteristics. It could take 4\u20136 \nyears after road rehabilitation for the road transport services to respond in areas where markets \nwere already established and natural disasters were relatively infrequent. This indicates that road \nrehabilitation planning must consider whether the absence of connectivity is critical enough before \nembarking on road rehabilitation. This needs to be accompanied by assessment of what other \npolicy initiatives and investments are necessary to make it successful. \n \n140.  Environmental  impact.  Unless  road  improvement  projects  implement  a  sound \nenvironmental impact mitigation plan, they could create negative impacts on biodiversity in the \nform of habitat loss and fragmentation, and invasion of nonindigenous species.60 Even with \ngood implementation, there are several unavoidable impacts due to the increase in accessibility \nto  forested  areas.  In  the  Lao  PDR,  the  threat  to  biodiversity  is  likely  to  increase  as  the \npopulation grows and also due to the access to forested areas provided by the roads. In \naddition, transport infrastructure development has indirect impacts such as water pollution, air \npollution during construction and operation, and waste disposal during construction. \n \n141.  The preparation of projects at ex-ante stage can be improved by paying attention to the \nlimited resources devoted by MPWT and the complex nature of the ecology. For the Rural \nAccess Roads Project, the environmental management plan was found to be lacking in detail, \nsince it only provided  a general framework for environmental protection without specifying \nmeasures (footnote 3). This resulted in less-than-adequate implementation of environmental \nmitigating measures during construction. Unless an environment management plan is detailed, \ncivil works contractors cannot implement it properly. A detailed plan needs to be backed up by \nbidding documents containing project-specific contract clauses for environmental protection and \nmanagement. With the mainstreaming of ADB\u2019s Safeguards Policy Statement of 2009, future \nenvironmental management plans will require closer coordination with the agencies at national \nand local levels, including management boards of national biodiversity conservation areas, \nMinistry of Agriculture and Forestry, and nongovernment organizations. \n \n                                                 \n57 ADB. 1996.

This problem becomes more serious for roads cutting \nthrough protected areas. The problem may not be noticeable during its initial stages, but could become prominent \nin the long term. \n ", "32   \n142.  The Champasack Road Improvement Project, as well as other projects, has witnessed \nencroachment by villagers on forest areas. While community participation programs are helpful \nin reducing the impact of this problem, they cannot solve it completely. The Rural Access Roads \nProject is equally challenging, since it included a road linking Xam Tai to Xam Nua and bisecting \nthe Nam Xan National Biodiversity Conservation Area in Houaphan Province. While from a \nconservation perspective, this road should not have passed through the conservation area, the \nidea is in conflict with the socioeconomic needs of Xam Tai since this is the only link to the main \nhighway. This district has been in existence long before the conservation area was declared a \nprotected area. \n \n143.  Upgrading roads in rural areas has been known to facilitate illegal logging in the Lao \nPDR.61 The government has established specific regulations to control logging, such as the \nnumber of logs that can be cut annually in each province. These logs are then auctioned by the \ngovernment to obtain the best prices, and some are also exported to Viet Nam. Discussions \nwith forest officials and a timber mill owner indicated that government regulations were being \nfollowed and that logs are cut from the production forests only. However, discussions with \nnongovernment  organizations  indicated  that  there  have  been  instances  of  illegal  logging, \nespecially in southern Lao PDR. This indicates that although there is an appropriate policy in \nplace for controlling logging, it is not being enforced strictly. \n \n144.  With road improvement, the traditional swidden or slash-and-burn agriculture or shifting \nagriculture has become an environmental issue. It has been a successful and dominant farming \nsystem in the northern Lao PDR for several generations. In recent years, the average fallow \nperiods have decreased from an average of 4\u20135 years to 2\u20133 years as a result of a combination \nof  population  pressure,  government  restrictions  on  forest  clearing,  competing  land-use \nobjectives, and migration of people to areas adjacent to roads. With the improved access to \nremote areas, this issue is likely to worsen. In 2006, an environmental performance assessment \nreport systematically documented a nationwide assessment of ADB's environmental concerns \nand how the Lao PDR is addressing them.62 The report applied a pressure-state-response \nmodel. It identified the government\u2019s efforts and investments in road and irrigation infrastructure \nto induce farmers to change from shifting cultivation to more sustainable production systems. \n \n145.  The Lao PDR has also seen a growth in industrial tree plantations. The NSEDP 6 cited \nthe conversion of some 72,870 hectares of swidden fields into industrial tree plantations in \n2005.63 This represented 61% of the areas used in 2001 for slash-and-burn cultivation. In effect, \nswidden areas have become the prime catalyst for land-use change by first clearing the forest \nfor subsistence farming, then ultimately converting the land into industrial tree plantations. \nThese  land  conversions  are  facilitated  by  the  presence  of  roads,  since  the  harvesting  of \nindustrial trees requires good access. \n \n146.  Impact on ethnic people.64 The GMS: Northern Economic Corridor Project affected \n76 villages flanking Road No. 3, comprising about 37,000 people. More than 90% of these \nresidents belong to ethnic groups distinct from the lowland Lao PDR peoples. Similarly, the \nRural Access Road Project was involved in areas with ethnic minority communities. Most often, \n                                                 \n61 ADB. 2004. Country Gender Strategy on Lao PDR. Manila. \n62 ADB  and  United  Nations  Environment  Programme.  2007.  Lao  PDR  National  Environmental  Performance \nAssessment Report. Bangkok. \n63 The Fourth and Fifth Road Improvement projects led to the establishment of teak tree and bamboo plantations \n(footnote 37). \n64 The term ethnic people are used here to describe the indigenous peoples as defined in ADB\u2019s Safeguards Policy \nStatement. \n ", "  33\nthe social assessment carried out at appraisal has two methodological issues: (i) inappropriate \nclassification of the ethnic minority groups, and (ii) incomplete surveys and oversimplification of \nlivelihood descriptions. The PPER for the Rural Access Roads Project provided details of these \nissues (footnote 3), indicating that the quality of the assessment leading up to the project could \nhave been better. The indirect consequence is that all the ethnic communities were grouped into \na single category that did not differentiate relative economic status and the ability to capture the \nbenefits of road improvement. \n \n147.  All ADB projects carry out a social analysis or an initial poverty and social impact \nassessment  during  the  preparatory  phase.  In  principle,  these  analytical  studies  include \nassessing the needs of impacted villagers defined as affected peoples for compensation for loss \nof land or houses and could trigger ADB social safeguard policies on involuntary resettlement \nand indigenous peoples. In the Lao PDR transport sector, involuntary resettlement has not \ninvolved large-scale relocation of villages such as might be required in hydropower projects. \nTypically, road projects have involved compensation for the appropriation of small amounts of \nland to meet right-of-way standards. However, the socioeconomic analysis carried out by this \nSAPE shows various unanticipated impacts that could have eluded with earlier social analyses. \nGiven below are generic observations from various parts of the Lao PDR. \n(i)  A road improvement project could cause strategic problems for ethnic minority \ngroups when a road passes through their ancestral territory, inducing them to \nrelocate to the roadside to prevent migrants from doing so, a self-protective move \nnot motivated by economics. However, these aspects have not been studied \nduring social analysis and, hence, tend to be overlooked in the initial poverty and \nsocial impact assessment. \n(ii)  Road improvement could lead to a change in the social and economic balance in \nlocal communities. It could exacerbate a dormant inferiority complex on the part \nof Mon\u2013Khmer people when they are consolidated into villages of Lao\u2013Tai or \nHmong\u2013Mien groups, or when relocated to roadsides where they must compete \nfor  resources  with  these  groups.65  Relative  strengths  and  weaknesses  of \nindividual ethnic groups in the face of development may not be revealed in social \nanalysis,  and  interethnic  relationships  are  usually  not  described.  In  addition, \nwhere villages are ethnically mixed, socioeconomic studies frequently aggregate \ndata by village and miss ethnic distinctions or characterize these villages as \n\u201cintegrated.\u201d  This  point  brings  out  the  differential  impacts  among  the  ethnic \ngroups that need to be recognized. A socioeconomic assessment carried out by \nIED for the Rural Access Roads Project found that some of these groups (e.g., \nHmong\u2013Mien groups) were able to take advantage of the road improvement \n(footnote 3). However, other groups such as the Khmu and Bahnar groups had \nlimited incremental economic benefits. In particular, the Mon\u2013Khmer segment \nremained poor before and after road improvement. \n(iii)  An initial poverty and social impact assessment sometimes does not consider \nindirect  impacts,  thereby  compromising  the  quality  of  the  appraisal  process. \nAlthough a road improvement project might not require the relocation of villages, \nthere  could  be  a  parallel  intervention  linked  to  regional  planning  or  policy-\nmotivated  social  engineering.  To  enable  villages  to  capture  the  economic \nbenefits of the road improvement, they are usually relocated to areas adjacent to \nroads. Most districts have relocation plans; thus, information on which villages \n                                                 \n65 UNDP and Government of the Lao PDR, Ministry of Planning and Investment. 2009. National Human Development \nReport\u2014Employment and Livelihoods Lao PDR 2009. Vientiane. \n ", "34   \nand ethnicities are to be relocated is readily available. However, this is not used \nby the initial poverty and social impact assessments.  \n \n148.  The above points have been identified to contribute to the improvement of future project \nappraisals. The link of the first two points ([i] and [ii]) with ADB safeguard policies is clear and \nundeniable. It is important for ADB to recognize these issues and identify mitigation measures to \naddress  them  during  project  implementation.  The  third  point  has  an  indirect  link  to  road \nimprovement projects. However, this places ADB in a position where it could be seen as \ncontributing to the government's relocation policies. This requires a more detailed indigenous \npeoples impact assessment, which is currently outside the scope of this SAPE. However, ADB \nneeds to be aware of this risk and plan mitigation measures to address it. \n \nG.  ADB Performance \n149.  ADB's performance in the Lao PDR transport sector is satisfactory. ADB has been one \nof the lead development agencies in this sector, assisting the government in planning and \nimplementing projects. Discussions with MPWT indicated general satisfaction with the quality of \nthe responsiveness and value addition by ADB. Capacity building by ADB has been effective in \n(i) direct TA for training of MPWT staff and for specific thematic areas such as road safety, \nregional cooperation, and safeguard assessment; and (ii) indirect capacity development for \nMPWT project managers and other staff members who work on ADB projects. \n \n150.  ADB's main value addition has been in providing inputs for capital investment projects \nand capacity development in selected areas. Although this continues to be consistent with the \nneeds of the country, there exist areas of interventions that ADB needs to improve upon (para. \n94). This includes improving the sustainability of projects, which continues to be an area of \nconcern for the transport sector in the Lao PDR. In the past, the World Bank has focused on this \naspect,  and  ADB  has  chosen  to  avoid  duplication.66  While  this  is  seen  as  appropriate \nharmonization, ADB needs to continue to work in conjunction with the World Bank in this area. \n \n151.  An analysis of ADB performance in implementing IED recommendations can also be \nimproved (Appendix 11). The main issues that have yet to be comprehensively acted upon \ncover  capacity  development,  road  maintenance,  and  private  sector  development.  Although \nthese are sector-wide problems requiring multidonor interventions, ADB needs to take a lead in \nsustaining the efforts in these areas. ADB could further improve its value addition by acting as a \ncatalyst for these sector-wide issues. In the short term, ADB needs to restart TA to the Lao \nPDR's transport sector targeting the above issues. \n \n152.  ADB has delegated four projects to the resident mission. Out of these, three have been \ncompleted. Currently, the resident mission is administering the Roads for Rural Development \nProject and intends to administer another one in the next 6 months. The current capacity of the \nresident mission is sufficient for this scale of operation. ADB's effectiveness and efficiency could \nbe improved in the future if further projects are delegated to the resident mission.67 If and when \nthis delegation is stepped up, it will need to be accompanied by a corresponding capacity \nenhancement in the resident mission. In the third quarter of 2010, the Northern GMS Transport \nNetwork Improvement Project will be delegated to the resident mission as well. \n \n                                                 \n66 In the Xieng Khouang Road Project, ADB agreed to cancel the road maintenance capacity building component to \navoid duplication of work under a program financed by the World Bank (ADB. 2006.

ADB has been at the forefront of participating in sector working groups to coordinate \ntransport investments in the Lao PDR. Other agencies participating in the provision of funding \nand TA are AusAID, government of Thailand, JICA, Sida, and the World Bank. Further bilateral \naid has been provided by other countries including the PRC, Republic of Korea, and Viet Nam, \nalbeit on a smaller scale. Figures 4 and 5 provide a summary of the relative size of the \nassistance for road rehabilitation in the Lao PDR. \n \nFigure 4: Length of Roads Rehabilitated  Figure 5: Cost of Road Rehabilitation by \nby Source of Funding, 1998\u20132010  Funding Source, 1998\u20132010 \n(kilometers)  (%) \nThailand, 3% Thailand, 8% UNDP, 1%\nUNDP, 9%\nSida, 8% Sida, 5%\nKfW, 3%\nKfW, 8%\nJICA, 4% ADB, 45%\nJICA, 20%\nADB, 47%\nWB/IDA, 19%\nWB/IDA, 13% AusAID, 0.1%\nPRC, 2%\n  PRC, 5%  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, AusAID = Australian Agency for International Development, PRC = People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, IDA = International Development Association, JICA = Japan International Cooperation Agency, \nSida = Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, UNDP = United Nations Development Programme, \nWB = World Bank. \nSource: Data provided by the Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Ministry of Public Works and \nTransport. \n \n154.  With various development agencies participating in the development of the Lao PDR \ntransport sector, issues of coordination and harmonization remain. MPWT has been the main \ncoordinating agency, and carried out this duty effectively until the late 1990s. With the increase \nin the number of development agencies and the amount of external assistance, the need for \nagency coordination is now greater. \n \n155.  Since  the  1980s,  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)  organized \nroundtable meetings to serve as a forum for development dialogue between the Government of \nthe Lao PDR and the donor community. These were initially held in Geneva. But since 1999, \nthese have been conducted in Vientiane. The government has taken the lead in managing this \nprocess. ADB chairs the infrastructure working group within the roundtable meeting process. An \nevaluation by the United Nations Evaluation Office in 2007 found that the roundtable meeting \nwas effective in improving dialogue among the development agencies and has led to more \neffective information sharing and complementary efforts.68 The evaluation recommended that \nUNDP continue its role in coordinating aid through the roundtable meeting process. \n \n156.  The government has set up another infrastructure sector working group to coordinate \nand harmonize investment planning among development agencies. Para. 83 indicates needed \nimprovements  in  the  functioning  of  this  working  group.  In  addition,  a  memorandum  of \nunderstanding on collaboration was signed among ADB, Sida, and the World Bank. Discussions \n                                                 \n68 UNDP. 2007. Assessment of Development Results, Evaluation of UNDP's Contribution to the Lao PDR. New York. \n ", "36   \nwithin ADB, as well as other development partners, indicate that this remains mainly on paper \nand has not been mainstreamed. Finally, the Coordination Framework Agreement was signed in \n2006, which outlined the Lao Transport Development Partnership. This framework needs to be \nreviewed  since  its  immediate  next  steps  had  been  \"to  jointly  develop  detailed  physical, \nprocedural, sector and organizational efficiency, and capacity indicators for some of the core \nareas  of  the  Lao  PDR  transport  sector  to  provide  a  uniform  basis  for  achievement  of \ndevelopment objectives of the sector.\"69 Discussions with development agencies indicated that \nnot much progress has been achieved on this agreement. \n \n157.  Two areas require development agency coordination. The Lao PDR has the benefit of \nvarious studies by different agencies. This knowledge needs to be shared and disseminated \namong development agencies needs, followed by application of this knowledge to new projects. \nFor example, slope stabilization techniques and low-cost pavement technologies, which have \nbeen  identified  by  recent  studies  funded  by  bilateral  development  agencies,  can  be \nmainstreamed into ADB and World Bank projects. This requires streamlined harmonization not \nonly at the planning stage but also at project implementation stage. The second area requiring \ncoordination is project implementation monitoring. Contractor problems are faced by almost all \nexternally-funded projects in the Lao PDR. Similarly, most implementation issues are common \namong these projects. This requires an annual multipartite meeting between the Ministry of \nFinance, the Ministry of Planning and Investment, MPWT, and all development agencies to \nidentify the implementation problems and find solutions for all ongoing projects. This concept \nhas been applied in other countries, such as India, and has been successful. \n \nI.  Government Performance \n158.  The  government's  performance  has  improved  over  the  years,  with  increased \nfamiliarization of ADB procedures and awareness of international good practices. In all cases, \nthe executing agency has been MPWT. Although the majority of projects faced implementation \nissues (paras. 50\u201354) causing implementation delays and, in some cases, cost overruns, the \nintensity of these issues has been reduced in recent years with the growing maturity of MPWT \nand appropriate measures from ADB. For example, in 2000, MPWT replaced all the project \nimplementation units with a single project management division in DOR, which streamlined the \nproject management functions and enabled better coordination, ownership, and transparency. \n \n159.  The financing of the road subsector continues to tarnish the performance of MPWT. \nLack of funding for road rehabilitation as well as maintenance has constrained economic growth \nin remote areas. Delays in counterpart funding have contributed to overall implementation \ndelays. Four out of the 10 completed projects faced counterpart funding delays. This issue has \nbeen tackled in recent projects by lowering the government\u2019s share of funding. It needs to be \naddressed as a fiscal issue, rather than an institutional problem, with MPWT. \n \n160.  The  low  effectiveness  and  sustainability  of  the  capacity  building  assistance  also \ncontinues to be an issue for MPWT. The reliance on consultants to manage projects has been \nreduced but not completely eliminated. Issues such as safeguard implementation still receive \nlow priority, resulting in low-quality assessment and implementation (para. 147). As a strategic \nmove,  MPWT  intends  to  adopt  a  catalyst  role  wherein  various  aspects  of  a  project  are \noutsourced. However, unless gaps in capacity development are fixed, it would be difficult for \nMPWT  to  play  the  catalytic  role  effectively.  Appendix  12  analyzes  MPWT  performance  in \n                                                 \n69 Memorandum of Understanding signed on 3 May 2006 by MCTPC (now called MPWT), Embassy of Sweden, \nInternational Development Association (World Bank), and ADB. \n ", "  37\nsafeguard implementation. It indicates that although there is commitment from the government \nin  implementing  these  social  and  environmental  safeguards,  lack  of  adequate  institutional \ncapacity has constrained its overall performance. \n \n161.  MPWT's capacity constraints could be reduced by the use of external monitors. Lessons \nfrom the Rural Access Roads Project indicated that external monitors for environmental safeguard \nimplementation were useful in ensuring appropriate implementation of mitigation measures. Other \nprojects, such as the GMS: Northern Economic Corridor Project, have external monitors but could \nhave benefited from stronger support from MPWT. For the ongoing Northern GMS Transport \nNetwork Improvement Project, MPWT has yet to appoint external monitors for resettlement although \nthis was agreed to in 2007, as part of the project design. It is noted that the procurement process for \nthese monitors is currently under way. It is apparent that given the capacity constraints faced by \nMPWT in the areas of social and environmental safeguard implementation, the use of external \nmonitors could add value in bridging the gap in the short term as well as capacity development in \nthe long term. From January 2010, ADB safeguard policy requires external monitors for sensitive \nprojects with significant impacts and risks. For this requirement to be triggered, the assessment at \nappraisal needs to be sufficiently rigorous, which is currently lacking (para. 147). \n \n162.  The current ADB safeguard policy requires that \"for projects that are deemed by ADB to \nbe highly complex and sensitive, ADB will require the borrower/client to engage an independent \nadvisory  panel  during  project  preparation  and  implementation.\"70  Taking  into  account  the \npotential impacts of future projects (paras. 140\u2013148), this requirement could be triggered by \nprojects located in remote areas. The need for a careful assessment of the potential impacts at \nthe ex-ante stage is crucial in the context of the Lao PDR. \n \n163.  MPWT  has  also  taken  initial  steps  toward  developing  an  environmental  and  social \noperational manual, which aims to establish a countrywide system acceptable to all development \npartners  (footnote  6).  The  manual  includes  (i)  the  development  and  implementation  of  a \nharmonized approach to environmental and social management, initially starting with the road \nsubsector; (ii) a consolidation of the environmental and social management technical capacity \nwithin MPWT; and (iii) provision of appropriate technical support and resources for implementation \nand compliance monitoring. However, the effectiveness and success of safeguard implementation \nwill be seen in the mainstreaming of this manual and the level of its use. \n \nJ.  Overall Assessment \n164.  The overall rating of ADB's program is successful based on the six criteria listed in Table \n3. This rating is an outcome of several factors. First, ADB's contribution to the Lao PDR \ntransport  sector  has  been  tangible  and  consistent  with  the  country's  needs.  Second,  the \nassistance has been effective in enabling positive outcomes at the local, country, and regional \nlevels. Third, it has contributed to agricultural development. Other areas should be improved, \nhowever, such as implementation performance, low utilization of project benefits, institutional \ndevelopment, sustainability, strategic positioning, and differential impacts among ethnic people. \n \n                                                 \n70 ADB. 2009.

CONCLUSIONS, LESSONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS \n165.  ADB has been a longstanding development partner in the Lao PDR transport sector. \nADB assistance, as well as the sector itself, has undergone changes over the years. Although \nthe basic objective of providing connectivity remains, regional cooperation has emerged as an \narea  for  investment.  This  requires  an  appropriate  balance  between  domestic  needs  and \ninternational  aspirations.  Besides  contributing  to  this  balanced  development,  ADB's  value \naddition is closely linked to the institutional development efforts in the country. \n \n166.  Economic activities in the Lao PDR take a longer time to stimulate as compared with \nother countries such as India and Thailand. As a result, an integrated approach that enables \ncomplementarities with other interventions such as agriculture, trade, and tourism is needed. \nSimilarly, the need for the maintenance of road projects has gained awareness within the \ngovernment. However, it remains to be seen whether the government can deploy adequate \nresources to ensure sustainability. Moreover, this needs to be supported appropriately by ADB, \nwhich has yet to define a clear strategy for addressing sustainability concerns in the Lao PDR. \n \n167.  ADB has adopted an integrated approach to rehabilitate rural roads by combining them \nwith agriculture interventions. This is seen as prudent, and ADB should continue this approach, \ntaking into account the factors mentioned in para. 74 for planning and implementing such \nprojects. While all factors mentioned are important, the two that stand out relate to better \ncoordination between MPWT and Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and among the transport \nand agriculture divisions within ADB's Southeast Asia Department. \n \n168.  ADB exited from the civil aviation subsector and has stayed away from the inland waterways \nand railways subsectors. This is considered prudent in light of funding limitations. Support to urban \ntransport could be scaled up, given the potential demand for funds in this subsector. However, this \nneeds to be considered within the broader constraint of funds availability. \n \nA.  Lessons for Future Assistance \n169.  Continued and scaled up assistance for provincial and rural roads. ADB\u2019s transport \nsector assistance in the Lao PDR has evolved in the recent years to focus on GMS regional \n ", "  39\nprojects  that  fund  improvement  of  national  roads  and  highways  connecting  international \nborders. Higher development effectiveness could be achieved by improving access to remote \nareas in the Lao PDR (para. 118). This indicates the need for increased attention to funding \nprovincial and rural roads in the future country program. The development of GMS regional \nroads has benefited the Lao PDR by providing connectivity through alternative trade routes. But \nthey have also provided benefits to neighboring countries. It would be beneficial for the Lao \nPDR\u2019s economy if these benefits of the externalities are internalized in the form of transit fees. \nEfforts toward such internalization are being made and could be supported by ADB in the future. \n \n170.  Geographical focus of projects. ADB road projects are in different parts of the country. \nEven within a given project, the subprojects are located in various parts, straining MPWT's \nresources  and  reducing  synergies.  By  ensuring  a  geographical  focus  on  certain  areas  or \nprovinces within the Lao PDR, project management and development effectiveness could be \nimproved.  A  corollary  effect  would  possibly  lead  to  better  coordination  with  development \npartners agreeing to focus on different provinces.  \n \n171.  Quality of sector and project design frameworks. The CSP 2007\u20132011 includes a \ntransport sector road map that is similar to that for Cambodia. Both road maps contain outcome \nindicators that are difficult to measure, such as road transport costs. Moreover, the road map \ndoes not state the source of these data. This is also an area of improvement for the project \ndesign and monitoring frameworks, which have broad indicators that are unquantifiable and not \ntime-bound. Although the quality of the frameworks has improved in the last year for new \nprojects,  efforts  need  to  be  made  to  improve  the  quality  of  the  sector  road  map  in  the \nsubsequent country partnership strategy. \n \n172.  Transfer of knowledge. Capacity development is an area for improvement in the Lao \nPDR. ADB has the potential to contribute to this by bringing in good practice models and \nlessons from other countries. This is done indirectly as part of the project management exercise \nwherein MPWT's project managers build their awareness through working with international \nconsultants and contractors. However, a systematic process is needed for the transfer of good \npractices to the Lao PDR. \n \n173.  Performance of contractors. The issue of contractor performance has been affecting \nproject implementation. Attempts to use local contractors are seen as appropriate for local \ncapacity development but have resulted in poor project performance. ADB needs to ensure that \nthe procurement process includes rigorous due diligence so that poorly qualified contractors are \nnot selected. This will be important in the context of the 100% grants being provided by ADB for \nfuture projects. \n \n174.  Road maintenance. Appropriate allocation for rural road maintenance continues to be \nan issue in the Lao PDR. There is no easy solution to address this issue. Sector-wide solutions \nwill ensure consistent sustainability of new rehabilitated roads, but these need to be developed \nin conjunction with the government and all development partners. \n \n175.  Safeguard assessment and monitoring. Roads are likely to create inequality among \nethnic minority groups, since benefits do not accrue equally to all groups. Such impacts can be \naddressed only if the assessment at appraisal is carried out in a comprehensive manner. Most \noften,  all  ethnic  minority  communities  are  grouped  into  one  category.  This  negates  any \ndifferential interventions to resolve inequality among them. In other words, there is a need to \nensure that assessment of social groupings are carried out correctly, so that propensities for \ndifferential economic development are identified correctly at the feasibility stage. \n \n ", "40   \n176.  Suitable due diligence at appraisal is crucial. For sensitive projects, the use of external \nmonitors  needs  to  be  enforced  consistently.  Such  monitors  have  been  used  on  transport \nprojects in the past and have demonstrated value addition. Continuing such external monitoring \nwill  increase  the  chances  of  improvement  in  the  quality  of  the  social  and  environmental \nmitigation plans, and will ensure that the plans are implemented effectively. It will also contribute \nto the building of local capacities in these areas. \n \nB.  Recommendations \n177.  The 2006 country assistance program evaluation for the Lao PDR recommended that ADB \nshould continue to support road maintenance and road safety (para. 7). Taking into account the \nsector performance stated in paras. 109\u2013113 and paras. 133\u2013137, the recommendations continue \nto  be  valid.  In  addition,  given  below  are  specific  recommendations  from  this  SAPE  for \nconsideration in formulating the next country partnership strategy. Their impacts can be measured \nafter 5 years to evaluate their effectiveness. \n \n178.  Capacity  development.  Support  the  government  in  the  development  of  integrated \ncapacity-building  programs  (instead  of  one-off  TA)  in  specific  areas  such  as  project \nmanagement at provincial levels; economic, social, and environmental impact assessment; \nprocurement;  indigenous  peoples  impact  assessment,  monitoring,  and  identification  of \nmitigation measures; rural road network expansion; and maintenance funding. With government \ndecentralizing several activities to the provincial level, it becomes crucial that capacity in the \nprovincial administration is improved in these areas.  \n \n179.  Project-readiness  filters.  Improve  implementation  performance  of  ADB  transport \nprojects by mainstreaming project-readiness filters to assess the institutional preparedness \nwithin the government for implementing a new project. Such filters can be used to check if the \nexecuting and implementing agencies are ready to implement the project so that start-up delays \ncan be avoided (para. 54). One option is to include directions for applying these filters in the \nsubsequent country partnership strategy to enable mainstreaming. \n \n180.  Coordination  of  assistance.  Work  in  conjunction  with  the  government  to  improve \ndevelopment agency coordination in the areas of knowledge management and implementation \nmonitoring. The Lao PDR has witnessed a major increase in the number of multilateral and \nbilateral  development  agencies  working  in  various  sectors.  Specifically  in  transport  sector, \nefforts have been made to coordinate the planning and implementation of national assistance, \nbut these efforts are quite often running parallel or overlapping with each other. By bringing \ntogether these efforts, it should be possible to develop synergies in terms of time and resources \ncurrently being spent. ADB, as the lead multilateral development partner in the transport sector, \nneeds  to  facilitate  these  synergies  in  conjunction  with  MPWT.  In  the  short  term,  it  is \nrecommended that development agency coordination be targeted at two areas. \n \n181.  The  first  is  knowledge  sharing.  ADB  needs  to  work  in  conjunction  with  other \ndevelopment agencies to create a framework for identification, storage, dissemination, and \napplication  of  knowledge  of  the  transport  sector  (para.  157).  The  second  area  is  project \nimplementation monitoring. ADB needs to initiate the concept of an annual multipartite meeting \nbetween the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Planning and Investment, MPWT, and all agencies \nto identify implementation problems and find solutions on a sector-wide basis. \n ", " \nADB ASSISTANCE FOR THE TRANSPORT SECTOR IN THE LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC \n \n1.

Sector Context \n \n1.  The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) is a landlocked nation in Southeast \nAsia bordered by Cambodia, the People's Republic of China (PRC), Myanmar, Thailand, and \nViet Nam. It had a 2007 population of 5.9 million, which was growing at 2.1% per year. It \nconsists of 236,800 square kilometers (km) of land and has a low population density of 25 \npeople per square km. The share of urban population is low at 21% (2006), and per capita gross \ndomestic product was estimated at KN6,696 thousand in 2007. Vientiane, the capital, has the \nlargest urban concentration.1 \n \n2.  Over the years, the Lao PDR has been in the process of transforming to a market-\noriented  economy.  The  government  has  introduced  a  package  of  reforms  focusing  on \ninfrastructure improvement, privatization of industry, and development of legal framework to \nenhance  economic  activities.  In  recent  years,  macroeconomic  growth  (7.5%  in  2007)  has \nimproved significantly, but the situation remains fragile, and further efforts are necessary to \nmaintain  stability.  Agriculture  remains  a  major  sector,  contributing  32.8%  to  the  economy, \nemploying about 2 million of the labor force. Industry contributes 25.2% to the economy, and \nservices, which include transport and communications, have grown steadily to 40.0% (Table \nA3.1).2 \n \nTable A3.1: Sector Contribution to Gross Domestic Product \n(current producer\u2019s prices, %) \n \nItem   1990  1995  2000  2005  2006 \nAgriculture  61.2  55.0  52.6  44.8  42.6 \nIndustry   14.5  19.0  22.9  29.5  31.8 \nServices  24.3  26.0  24.6  25.7  25.6 \nSource: Asian Development Bank. 2008. Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific. Manila. \n \nB.  Transport Sector \n \n3.  The Lao PDR depends heavily on road transport and, to a lesser extent, river and air \ntransport. Transport demand has been growing over the years, but transport of passengers and \ngoods is constrained by an inadequate network exacerbated by poor physical conditions. In \n2007, the road network accounted for 93% of passengers per km of travel and 85% of freight \ntraffic  (i.e.,  tons  per  km).  The  remaining  passenger  and  freight  traffic  are  carried  through \nwaterways and aviation. Air transport serves 2% of passenger demand and plays an important \nrole in linking main urban centers, tourist destinations, and inaccessible parts of the country. \nThe volume of airfreight, however, is negligible (Figures A3.1\u2013A3.4).3 \n \n                                                 \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2008.

The transport network of the Lao PDR is linked to that of the Greater Mekong Subregion \n(GMS) and associated GMS economic corridors. The GMS transport sector strategy defines the \nkey transport corridors of the Northern Corridor, connecting Thailand and the PRC (comprising \nNational Road 3 in the Lao PDR); the Central Corridor (National Road 13 in the Lao PDR), \nlinking Cambodia and the PRC; the East\u2013West Corridor (Road 9) between Thailand and Viet \nNam,  crossing  the  Mekong  River  at  Savannakhet;  and  the  new  Northeastern  Corridor, \nconnecting northern Viet Nam and Thailand along a new road (in the long-term parallel roads 6 \nand 7 within the Lao PDR) to Louangphrabang and Road 4 to Thailand.4 \n \n1.  Road Transport \n \n1.  Classification.  The  public  road  network  is  divided  into  (i)  national,  (ii)  provincial, \n(iii) district, (iv) urban, (v) rural, and (vi) special.5 Each class is formally defined in the Road Law \nof 1999 (Table A3.2).6 Based on mid-2008 estimates, there are about 35,557 km of public roads \nin the country. Of this, national and provincial roads each account for close to 20%.

Paved roads \nformed 56% of the national roads and 3% of local roads. The other roads had gravel (33.7%) or \nearth  surfaces  (52.3%).  Thus,  seasonal  closures  are  frequent  due  to  poor  pavement  and \ndeficient cross-drainage. The Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT) reported in its \n2008 strategy paper that many of these sections are impassable during the rainy season (Table \nA3.2). \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2007.

According  to  data  by  the  MPWT  (formerly  called  the  Ministry  of \nCommunications, Transport, Post, and Construction [MCTPC]),8 the vehicle base in the Lao \nPDR increased from 59,781 in 1985 to 568,290 in 2005, with the highest growth occurring from \n2000 to 2005 at almost 197%. Motorcycles, which account for almost 80% of total, are used \nprimarily for short travel, and their numbers have been increasing in recent years. Longer \ndistance traffic comprises a mix of trucks, buses, and light vehicles. The truck fleet includes 4-\naxle, 12-wheel rigid vehicles; truck\u2013trailer combinations; 10-wheel general purpose trucks; and \nmany mid-sized 2-axle 6-wheelers. There are a limited number of regular long-distance bus \nservices  using  modern  purpose-built  vehicles.  Local  passengers  services  are  operated  by \nconverted trucks, pickups, or tuk-tuks.9 Small trucks and light vehicles dominate the provincial \nand local road networks.

Vientiane is the main international \ngateway,  while  Louangphrabang  and  Pakxe  accept  regional  traffic  and  provide  customs, \nimmigration, and quarantine services. Another significant provincial airport is Savannakhet. \nMPWT  reported  that  all  airports  were  recently  upgraded.  Wattay  International  Airport  at \nVientiane is capable of assisting the largest jets, and Louangphrabang and Pakxe can handle \nregional jets and turbo props. There are also 10 minor airports in provincial capitals and 39 \nother airstrips (footnote 3). \n \n10.  Several international airlines such as Air Asia, Bangkok Airways, China Eastern Airlines, \nLao  Airlines,  Thai  Airways,  and  Vietnam  Airlines  provide  international  services.  Direct \nconnections are also available to Bangkok, Chiang Mai, and Ha Noi from Louangphrabang, and \nto Bangkok and Siem Reap from Pakxe. Scheduled domestic services are operated on main \nroutes13 by Lao Airlines with regular daily services, and additional flights are made in the rainy \nseason to selected locations. The state-owned airline, Lao Air, flies 10-seat Cessna aircrafts on \na regular basis to three remote provinces\u2014Houaphan, Phongsali, and Xayabury. Domestic and \ninternational services are provided primarily for tourist traffic.14 \n \n3.  Railway Transit \n \n11.  MPWT reported that a direct railway link from Thailand to Thanaleng was completed in \nJuly 2008 (footnote 3). The initial railway infrastructure into the Lao PDR comprises a 3.5 km \nlink from the Thai railway system in Nong Khai across the Friendship Bridge to Thanaleng on \nthe outskirts of Vientiane. A passenger station at Thanaleng with plans for a future freight \nterminal and logistics center is under way. \n \n4.  Inland Waterways \n \n12.  Over 2,000 km of the Mekong River and its tributaries are located in the Lao PDR. \nDuring the dry season, the navigable length is reduced to 1,300 km. The river forms the border \nbetween the Lao PDR and Myanmar, and the remaining length defines the border with Thailand. \nThe northern sector of the river is used for international trade among the PRC, Lao PDR, and \nThailand. Trade on the river has been increasing in recent years. \n \n13.  MPWT reported recent improvements that allow 100\u2013150 ships to navigate year-round \nbetween the PRC and Houayxai (footnote 3). The river between Louangphrabang and Vientiane \nis navigable all year, although there are difficult sections, with Vientiane\u2013Thakhek\u2013Savannakhet \nas the best section. Navigation is also easy in the Pakxe\u2013Don Deth section along the border \nwith Cambodia. \n \n14.  There are 21 river port facilities on the side of the river. Lakse Port in Vientiane is the \nmain port, with 20,000\u201330,000 tons per year going through it. Houayxai, Louangphrabang, and \nPakbeng each handle 10,000 tons of traffic. Vessels of 300 deadweight tons or greater capacity \ncarry mainly industrial and agricultural products such as sand, rocks, wood products, food \n                                                 \n13 Includes Houayxai, Louangnamtha, Louangphrabang, Oudomxai, Pakxe, Savannakhet, and Xiengkhouang.  \n14 ADB. 2002.

Traffic is mainly domestic, although international traffic is \npresent in the upper section among the PRC, the Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Thailand. \n \n15.  The key benefits of inland waterways transport are  \n(i)  lower financial costs relative to roads and railways, and high economic benefits in \nterms of movement of bulk goods, which can cover a wide community (i.e., local, \nregional, and national economies); \n(ii)  reduced  travel  time  owing  to  negligible  congestion  associated  with  road \ntransport; and \n(iii)  reduced external costs linked to air and noise pollution, and accidents, which \nimpact  indirectly  on  the  wider  community.  The  diversion  of  traffic  from  one \ntransport mode to another will also have various impacts on costs indirectly \nborne  by  the  community,  such  as  a  reduction  in  the  costs  of  infrastructure \nprovision and maintenance. \n \n16.  These indicate the potential for the Lao PDR to develop its inland waterways transport \nsystem. \n \n5.  Urban Transport \n \n17.  A study on the Master Plan on Comprehensive Urban Transport (footnote 10) reported \nthat transport in Vientiane has improved and has been upgraded to cope with growing traffic \ndemand.  In  recent  years,  Vientiane  has  concentrated  on  construction  and  rehabilitation  of \nasphalt, earth, and feeder roads in its districts; road links between district and rural areas; and \ninner and outer ring roads. In addition, bridges were constructed or repaired in Sangthong \nDistrict and Xaisettha District.

According to the 2008 study on urban transport (footnote 10), the number of registered \nvehicles sharply increased after 2000, primarily due to the increase in low-priced motorcycles \nfrom the PRC. In 2006, more than 200,000 vehicles were registered. A traffic survey conducted \nin the study area15 showed that there is usually high traffic in major roads, with the highest traffic \nvolume observed in front of the Pohphano Temple along Kaysone Road. This road section \nwitnesses 58,470 vehicles per day for both directions, including motorcycles (Figure A3.8). This \nindicates a potential issue of congestion that is likely to become more visible in the future across \nVientiane City. \n                                                 \n15 Includes the whole areas of districts of Chanthabouly and Sisattanak and inner parts of districts of Hatxayfong, \nSikhottabong, Xaisettha, and Xaithany.

The  institutional  structure  for  transport  administration  provides  a  delegated, \ndecentralized system of coordination and implementation.16 MPWT has overall responsibility but \ndelegates tasks and responsibilities to divisions of public works and transport (DPWTs) in each \nprovince through subsidiary offices in districts. Similarly, DPWTs delegate other tasks and \nresponsibilities to offices of public works and transport, which are headed by DPWT staff. \nDPWTs  report  to  the  provincial  governor,  although  MPWT  is  responsible  for  establishing \nnational technical standards (footnote 3). An average of 75 DPWT staff members operate in \neach province. \n \n  1.  Road Transport \n \n21.  Within  MPWT,  the  Department  of  Roads  has  the  responsibility  for  the  overall \nmanagement of the entire road network. Its senior management sets goals, objectives, and \nstandards; decides on systems and procedures; approves plans; allocates funds; and monitors \nthe  implementation  of  projects.  The  department  consists  of  two  divisions:  (i)  the  Road \nAdministration Division, which deals with national road construction and maintenance; and \n(ii) the Local Roads Division, which assists DPWTs and offices of public works and transport \n                                                 \n16 K.

The  Road  Administration  Division  assumes \nresponsibility for national road maintenance, but the provinces, on MPWT's behalf, arrange the \nactual works. DPWTs take care of road maintenance within the provinces. The Local Roads \nDivision sets out the directions and priorities for provincial maintenance programs and monitors \nand evaluates the results.17 \n \n22.  With decentralization, provinces are now responsible for local roads, although DPWTs \nmanage the overall road network. Expenditure on local roads comes under the provincial budget \nagreed with the government. Offices of public works and transport are responsible for planning \nand supervising the maintenance of district and rural roads under the supervision, technical \nguidance, and assistance provided by DPWTs. \n \n23.  The RMF was created within the organizational structure of MCTPC (now known as \nMPWT). It is supervised and directed by an advisory board, which consists of representatives \nfrom the public and private sectors, appointed by the Prime Minister, from the Ministry of \nFinance,  MPWT,  provincial  authorities,  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry,  road  and \npassenger transport operators, and the general public. The chair is nominated by MPWT. The \nadvisory board, together with the MPWT minister, decides on fund allocations and use. It also \nrecommends charges based on maintenance requirements.18 The Road Administration Division, \nunder  MPWT,  coordinates  with  the  RMF  regarding  financial  support  for  national  road \nmaintenance, and with the Local Roads Division regarding local roads. \n \n  2.  Air Transport \n \n24.  Within MPWT, the Department of Civil Aviation is responsible for policy and planning in \ncivil aviation and for regulatory oversight of technical and safety matters pertaining to Lao \nAviation  and  the  Lao  Airports  Authority.  The  department  has  eight  divisions  plus  the  Lao \nAirports Authority.19 The civil aviation sector is governed by the department as designated by a \nPrime Minister\u2019s decree. The Lao Airports Authority has eight sectionsand is responsible for the \n \noperation  and  maintenance  of  Vientiane's  international  airport,  two  regional  airports  (at \nLouangphrabang  and  Pakxe),  and  two  provincial  airports  (at  Louang  Namtha  and \nSavannakhet). All other provincial small airports are the responsibility of provincial governments \nwith the department\u2019s technical consultation. The Vientiane international terminal has been \noperated by a joint venture, the Lao\u2013Japan Airport Terminal Services,since June 1999. \n \n \n25.  The Department of Civil Aviation is currently finalizing a comprehensive master plan for \nair transport that addresses the future development of civil aviation in the Lao PDR. The master \nplan  identifies  and  specifies  the  regulatory,  safety,  administrative,  and  capital  investment \nrequirement that will be progressively introduced and implemented. \n \nD.  Government Strategy  \n \n26.  Table A3.9 gives a summary of the government's strategies for the transport sector as \noutlined in the Sixth National Socioeconomic Development Plan, 2006\u20132010. \n \n                                                 \n17 Government of the Lao PDR, MCTPC. 2007.

The  current  situation  on  the  Lao  PDR  transport  sector  raised  the  following  key \nchallenges. ", "60  Appendix 3 \n(i)  Rural accessibility. The majority of the country's road network consists of rural \nroads that are mostly unpaved and remain impassable during the rainy season. \nMany people live in remote areas and have no access to utilities and basic \nservices. Road design standards and construction practices must be developed \nto improve rural roads (e.g., by using labor-based construction methods and \nadopting greater community participation). \n(ii)  Funding  and  maintenance.  Huge  investments  in  infrastructure  must  be \nmaintained to sustain economic growth. The RMF has been established and \nbegan operations in 2002; however, its expected revenues may not be sufficient. \nHence, the country remains heavily dependent on external support in the form of \ngrants or soft loans. The RMF mostly finances national roads and provides very \nlimited  budgetary  allocations  for  remaining  roads  at  the  provincial  and  local \nlevels. Even funding for the routine maintenance of provincial and local roads \nremains a problem. \n(iii)  Distribution of demand. There is an unbalanced transport demand toward road \ntransport and against railways and air services. The potential of other transport \nmodes, such as railways, waterways, or by air, need to be maximized. \n(iv)  Road safety. Recent trends showed that accident rates have been increasing, \nand correspondingly, so have injuries and fatalities. The government has put in \nplace  the  National  Road  Safety  Strategy  and  Action  Plan,  which  aims  to \nstrengthen the road accident data system, provide safe planning of roads, and \nconduct road safety education and an information campaign. The government \nhopes to reduce the rate of fatalities to 8 persons per 10,000 vehicles by 2010 \nand 5 persons per 10,000 vehicles by 2015. The government is also focusing on \nimproving enforcement, the technical environment, coordination, and research \nand evaluation (footnotes 3 and 7). \n(v)  Overloading. Overloading has been identified as one of the reasons for road \ndeterioration, particularly in international traffic. The government has recently \nimproved enforcement on load limits in line with its ASEAN commitments. A \nreview of existing regulations is also underway. \n(vi)  Institutional development. Decentralization has placed provincial- and district-\nlevel  officials  at  the  forefront  of  infrastructure  service  delivery,  although  the \ncentral  government  retains  regulations  and  oversight.  With  the  demand  to \nimprove performance, the provincial and local authorities should have adequate \nskills and training on road planning, operations, and management. There is also \na need to provide transparency and accountability in the award of contracts. \n(vii)  Regional trade. The Lao PDR's current potential in promoting trade through \nregional integration has been identified as a priority. There have been efforts to \ndevelop and/or improve transport links that connect the country with neighboring \ncountries.  As  such,  policy  dialogue  harmonizing  government  regulations, \nparticularly on customs procedures, must be an important concern to facilitate \nthe movement of goods. \n \n28.  The major issues relating to urban transport include the following. \n(i)  There is high demand to improve road planning in Vientiane. A 2008 study on \nurban transport observed that the current road system failed to consider future \ndevelopments,  such  as  accessing  the  new  railway  and  town  development \n(footnote 11). Also, the rapid increase of vehicles is expected to result in traffic \ncongestion and accidents, which the current road system may not address. \n(ii)  Traffic management issues identified include mixing passengers, cars, trucks, \nbuses, motorcycles, tuk-tuks, bicycles, and pedestrians on the road; improper ", "Appendix 3  61 \ninstallation of traffic signals, signs, and road markings; insufficient and/or illegal \nparking of vehicles in commercial zones and market areas; and limited facilities \nand  capacities  in  enforcing  traffic  safety.  Countermeasures  on  traffic \nmanagement,  road  safety  programs,  and  a  review  of  transport  policies  are \nrequired (footnote 11). \n(iii)  Financing  arrangements  for  urban  development  are  constrained  given  the \ngovernment's  limited  capacity  to  generate  revenue.  Given  that  the  national \nbudget is the main source of financing for urban development and operation and \nmaintenance  of  roads  throughout  the  country,  local  governments  need  to \nmobilize  their  own  financial  resources  to  meet  local  needs.  In  Vientiane, \nadditional funds for transport development are sourced from user charges for \nsolid  waste  management  services  and  land  taxes.  In  line  with  financial \ndecentralization  and  delegation  of  budget  controls,  a  suitable  framework  to \nprovide for sustained funding for operation and maintenance should be in place \nconsidering direct and indirect cost-recovery principles (e.g., funds from vehicle \nuser charges and property taxes) (footnote 10). \n \n ", "62  Appendix 4 \nADB TRANSPORT SECTOR STRATEGY IN THE LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC \n \nA.  Evolution of the Sector Strategy \n \n1.  The 1991 operational strategy for the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) was \nthe first formal strategic basis for Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance.1 It was developed \nwhen the Lao PDR was undergoing a transition from a command to a market-oriented economy. \nIt was aligned with the government\u2019s new economic mechanism;2 the Second Five-Year Plan, \n1986\u20131990; and the government\u2019s medium-term development strategy, which was then being \nprepared. The 1991 operational strategy was aimed at (i) putting into place an enabling policy \nand institutional reforms necessary for the development of competitive markets and private \nsector  investments,  and  (ii)  providing  for  direct  investment  interventions  such  as  essential \nphysical infrastructure to support private sector activities. Against this broad strategic focus, \nADB saw the transport sector as an area in which the government could attract the private \nsector by linking the Lao PDR to neighboring countries such as the People\u2019s Republic of China \nand Viet Nam. Adopting government priorities during the medium term, the 1991 operational \nstrategy emphasized national and provincial road networks, river ports, and airport facilities. \nADB also prioritized the negotiation of transit rights through neighboring countries and the \nintroduction of a regulatory framework, which included user charges. \n \n2.  The 1996 country operational strategy also placed a high priority on economic growth to \nsustain  the  process  of  economic  transition.3  Policy  reforms,  social  services,  and  human \nresources development were expected to enhance the economic environment and incentive \nframework. The 1996 country operational strategy was in line with the government's medium-\nterm development strategy (until 2000). Similar to the 1991 operational strategy, assistance for \ntransport was focused on the development of link roads with other countries and secondary and \nfeeder roads. \n \n3.  The  2000  country  assistance  plan  emphasized  the  need  to  pursue  more  balanced \neconomic growth due to increasing disparities in incomes.4 Thus, there was a great need to \ndeepen reforms in public expenditure management. The 2000 country assistance plan saw \ntransport  infrastructure  as  critical  to  providing  increased  access  to  markets  and  economic \nopportunities. ADB also recommended strengthening capacities in the maintenance of assets, \nproviding adequate funding and staffing, and establishing a system for sustainable operation \nand maintenance of the roads network. During the preparation of this plan, ADB provided \nassistance for both rural access roads and strategic corridors with subregional links. \n \n4.  The strategic focus of the country strategy and program (CSP) 2002\u20132004 was poverty \nreduction  supported  by  three  pillars:  (i)  sustainable  economic  growth,  (ii)  inclusive  social \ndevelopment, and (iii) good governance through policy and institutional development.5 Though \ndeveloping economic corridors with subregional links remained a priority, the CSP 2002\u20132004 \nemphasized rural access roads and small airports to improve transport links in small towns and \nurban areas and to facilitate rural development and market links. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1991.

Like the CSP 2002\u20132004, the CSP 2003\u201320056 was also focused on poverty reduction. \nIt was consistent with the government\u2019s policy on poverty eradication; the Poverty Reduction \nPartnership Agreement, which was signed by the government and ADB in September 2000; and \nthe Millennium Development Goals. The Poverty Reduction Partnership Agreement identified \nroad transport as a priority sector with agriculture, rural development, education, and health. \nRural access roads, subregional roads, and airport improvement were among the specific areas \nof intervention. \n \n6.  The strategic focus of the CSP 2003\u20132005 remained valid under the CSP updates \n2004\u20132005, 2005\u20132006, and 2006\u20132008.7 Then, in 2003, the government prepared an interim \npoverty reduction strategy paper and the draft National Poverty Eradication Programme, which \nwas also in line with the Poverty Reduction Partnership Agreement. This program focused on \nthe transport, agriculture, and social sectors. The CSP updates 2004\u20132005, 2005\u20132006, and \n2006\u20132008 (footnote 7) also emphasized private sector development and its important role in \nhydropower, mining, forestry, agriculture, and tourism. Transport development was increasingly \nhighlighted by the CSPs as a priority in border development and subregional integration, with a \nfocus  on  the  transformation  of  the  transport  corridor  into  a  full-fledged  economic  corridor. \nImprovement of Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) roads and northern airports were mentioned \nas possible areas of assistance for project loans. Technical assistance was lined up for the \npreparation of a transport sector strategy for the next 10 years. \n \n7.  The CSP 2007\u20132011,8 which is the current country strategy for the Lao PDR, also \nfocuses on poverty reduction. The CSP 2007\u20132011 is anchored on the government\u2019s Sixth Five-\nYear  National  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan,  2006\u20132010  and  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \noverarching goal of poverty reduction.9 It seeks to harmonize poverty reduction and economic \ngrowth  through  three  strategic  pillars:  (i)  promoting  pro-poor  and  sustainable  growth, \n(ii) fostering inclusive social development, and (iii) good governance. ADB assistance remains \nfocused on the management of the road network and expansion of access roads to the main \nroad network. Specific intervention areas include sector regulations, sustainable maintenance of \nthe road network through the Road Maintenance Fund, improvement of transport logistics, \nmanagement of social and environmental impacts, and implementation of a national road safety \nstrategy and action plan. With the issuance of the GMS regional strategy (of which the Lao PDR \nplays  an  integral  role),  economic  growth  will  be  accelerated  by  extending  main  transport \ncorridors (north\u2013south and east\u2013west), facilitating trade and tourism, and implementing the \nCross-Border Transport Agreement.10 Further, under the GMS transport strategy, 2006\u20132015,11 \nADB  is  concentrating  on  the  completion  and  expansion  of  strategic  transport  corridors, \nimprovement of the transport network in northwestern Lao PDR, and the connection of the \nborder  crossing  with  Thailand.  Assistance  is  under  way  on  improving  the  airport  in \nLouangphrabang and the Northern Transport Corridor to promote tourism. \n \n8.  Table A4.1 provides an analysis of this evolution for specific thematic areas. \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2002.

However, there was still a 6-month \ndelay, as the consultants were in place only in December 1993 compared with \nJuly 1993 as envisaged. Prequalification of contractors also took longer than \nenvisaged at appraisal. \n \nIssues included (i) lengthy discussions between MCTPC and ADB with respect to \nthe recommended shortlist of contractors to be invited to tender; (ii) late \ncompletion of tendering due to concerns about the availability of loan funds (i.e., \ndetailed design that the cost of construction would be higher than expected); and \n(iii) contractors' lack of resources, cash flow problems, lack of skilled labor, and \nlack of qualified engineers and supervisors. \n \nChampasack Road  Pre-selection of consultants was approved by ADB at the management review \nImprovement  meeting on 29 March 1995. There was no delay in the recruitment of consultants, \nwhich was actually done earlier than envisaged. The services of the supervision \nconsultants were extended due to delays in the completion of the additional civil \nworks (contract C) after identifying quality defects. \n \nXieng Khouang  ADB approved advance procurement action in December 1996. The \nRoad Improvement  prequalification of the civil works contractors was carried out between January \nand June 1997. \n \nDelay in project implementation was attributed to the start of the civil works \ncontracts, particularly (i) the late arrival of the contractors\u2019 equipment; (ii) slow \npreparation of works; (iii) contractors' substandard organization, planning, and \ncommunication; (iv) unfavorable weather conditions; and (v) unexplored \nordnance clearing. \n \nGMS East\u2013West  Advanced procurement action was approved, and it proceeded ahead of loan \nCorridor (Regional)   effectiveness. The prequalification process for the National Road 9 contract \nproceeded rapidly, and ADB approved 13 applicants in December 1999, 2 weeks \nbefore loan approval. Five top-ranked firms were invited to submit tenders, and \nthe selection was made on the basis of price. The contract was signed as soon \nas the loan became effective. \n \nThere was, however, a slow start in Viet Nam, which also delayed the Lao PDR \ncomponent. Delays in the completion of the civil works contracts were a result of \nunforeseen technical difficulties (e.g., insufficient initial survey work necessitating \nsome redesign, deeply buried unexploded ordnance discoveries in the Lao PDR \nafter areas had been declared clear, and material supply difficulties). \n \nAirports  The desired early implementation did not materialize because it took longer than \nImprovement  expected for the executing agency to take the necessary preparatory steps for \nproject implementation. Specifically, although the Capital Works Implementation \nUnit was already formed in June 1993, it was only early in 1994 that the project \noffice and tender committee were set up. This contributed to the delay in \nimplementation. \n ", "76  Appendix 6   \nProject Name  Findings and/or Issues \n  Delays in the appointment of consultants were attributed to (i) inexperience of the \nexecuting agency, (ii) delays in the tendering process, and (iii) slow mobilization \nand/or preparation of tender documents and documents in the prequalification \nphase. \nProjects without Advance Procurement \nVientiane Plain  There was an 8-month delay in the delivery of workshop equipment, which \nRoad Improvement  prevented construction activities from starting. \n   \nSecond Road  Project implementation was behind schedule because of (i) late engagement of \nImprovement  consultants, which affected the commencement of detailed engineering; (ii) the \ncompletion survey for Road B as well as the design changes caused the overall \ndesign activity to be completed in 37 months instead of 7 months as appraised; \n(iii) a prolonged procurement process for construction equipment and the \nreorganization of the executing agency; and (iv) problems with local funding. \n \nThird Road  Actual start and completion dates were slightly delayed because of the slow \nImprovement  mobilization of equipment. The problems that contributed to the late completion \nincluded (i) delayed installation and start of production of pipe culverts from the \npipe-making plant; (ii) lack of prompt supply of cement, steel reinforcement bars, \nand equipment spare parts, resulting in inordinate delays to plant operations; (iii) \ndelays of up to 6 months in payments for labor; and (iv) operational problems \nwithin the Road and Bridge Construction Enterprise, which reduced production, \nparticularly at the crushing plant and the workshop. \n \nFourth Road  There was a delay in the completion of detailed engineering and subsequently in \nImprovement  the procurement and contract award.

Several studies have analyzed road funds, such as the Road Maintenance Fund (RMF) \nin the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). In general, most studies1 focused on these \nfunds as an area of reform in road management and a likely solution to the problem of road \nmaintenance. The studies identified common issues among road funds, such as inadequate \nfunding  for  road  maintenance,  failure  of  the  government  to  provide  for  adequate  budget, \neventual deterioration of road infrastructure, weak road management, and overloading. \n \nA.  The Road Maintenance Fund in the Lao People's Democratic Republic \n \n2.  The Government of the Lao PDR established the RMF on 15 January 2001 through \nPrime Ministerial Decree No. 9.2 Collections for the RMF began in February 2002 and are \ncurrently  from  a  fuel  levy,  bridge  tolls,  heavy  vehicle  surcharges,  overweight  fines,  and \ninternational transit fees. The RMF was aimed at financing routine maintenance, emergency \nand periodic maintenance work, administration renewal works, road safety projects, and other \nadministrative costs. \n \n3.  The RMF is managed and supervised by the Ministry of Public Works and Transport \n(MPWT). Another decree was signed for the creation of the RMF Advisory Board, which is \ntasked  to  approve  decisions  about  RMF  allocations  with  MPWT.  The  board  consists  of \nmembers from the public and private sectors appointed from the Ministry of Finance, MPWT, \nprovincial  authorities,  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry,  road  and  passenger  transport \noperators, and the general public. The chair is nominated by MPWT. \n \nB.  Findings from the Literature Review \n \n4.  Key  principles  of  the  Road  Maintenance  Fund.  The  RMF  is  aligned  with  key \nprinciples of road fund management, operating under the context of resource limitations. Vaidya \nand Tusanasorn3 characterized the Lao PDR's creation of the RMF as reflective of the country's \nshift from emphasizing new construction and rehabilitation to maintenance. The RMF adopts the \n\"user's pay\" principle, since financing road maintenance comes from user charges. Following \nthe general principles discussed in the World Bank studies,4 the RMF is categorized as a \nsecond-generation road fund,5 which takes on a commercial approach as it seeks to bring road \nmaintenance to the private sector on a fee-for-service basis, similar to business transactions. \n \n                                                 \n1  H.

The World Bank Research Observer. 14 (2).  \n5  First-generation funds refer to the traditional or budget approach to road maintenance, which is widely used in \ndeveloping countries. Road funds under this approach are allocated as public expenditures to be covered by the \nnational budget. \n ", "86  Appendix 9 \n5.  Sources of revenue. Vaidya and Tusanasorn (footnote 3) reported gaps in local funding \nsources and the RMF's failure to meet targeted revenues. The RMF was expected to be \nsupported mainly by collections from a fuel levy, with charges to be increased rapidly to meet \nmaintenance  requirements.  While  RMF  revenues  still  grew  because  of  increases  in  other \ncharges, particularly from vehicle charges, the study observed that revenue targets would not \nbe met, as the fuel levy was KN40 per liter in 2004. The levy was increased to KN300 per liter in \n2009.  \n \n6.  In a World Bank report, Gwilliam6 also claimed that the increased tax rate fell behind the \noriginal schedule of increases. The rate was still considered low by international standards, as it \nonly constitutes about 2.0%\u20132.5% of the retail price. Other sources of RMF revenue may also \nbe worth investigating to improve its revenues. In particular, there could be some leaks and \ninefficiencies in collections of road tolls, unnecessary spending on weighing equipment and \nstaffing costs being charged to the RMF to enforce overloading fines, and complex licensing \nprocedures on vehicle registration. Vaidya and Tusanasorn (footnote 3) expected that support \nfrom external sources would likely to continue beyond 2009 to sustain the RMF. \n \n7.  Financing  needs.  In  a  2007  study  conducted  by  the  World  Bank  Independent \nEvaluation Group on road funding strategies of various countries,7 the RMF was assessed as \nespecially successful. Fund collections were efficiently allocated for road maintenance. Using \nthe percentage of estimated needs financed and changes in the overall level of funding for \nmaintenance as indicators to assess improvement in the quality of roads, the World Bank study \nobserved a significant increase in the percentage of roads in good condition than in most \ncountries. The RMF only covered 40% of its needs, but it was still said to be a \"well-performing \nfund.\" In general, the World Bank study noted that no road fund in the countries surveyed \nmanaged to cover all maintenance funding needs, with the best cases contributing as much as \n75%\u201380% (e.g., Ethiopia and Uganda). It found that about half of the road funds fulfilled half of \nthe maintenance needs of the national network, and only one third of the road funds use the \nresources exclusively for road maintenance. A 2003 Asian Development Bank (ADB) study8 on \nbest practices of road funds also found that a dedicated road fund typically contributes about \n50% of the requirements, depending on its ability to raise revenues. \n \n8.  Allocations of the Road Maintenance Fund. MPWT reported that about 90% of the \nRMF has been given to national roads and only 10% to local roads. If RMF revenues can be \nincreased,  the  percentage  allocations  provided  to  national  and  provincial  roads  should  be \nexamined as long as this is consistent with the fund\u2019s objective to prioritize road maintenance. \nThe ADB study (footnote 8) claimed that the RMF should not only finance all maintenance \nworks of the national highway network but also partly provide for lesser roads. \n \n9.  Provincial road maintenance. Vaidya and Tusanasorn (footnote 3) emphasized the \nvery limited resources provided to road maintenance at the provincial level. In addition, it was \nobserved in the same study that available funds for roads at the provincial level tend to be spent \non  rehabilitation  and  construction  rather  than  on  maintenance.  The  study  suggested  that \nprovinces should be given the option to raise additional revenues, such as through license fees \nfor vehicles, to finance road maintenance. The establishment of provincial road maintenance \nfunds managed at the local or provincial levels should be considered with structures similar to \nthe national RMF. Provincial RMFs may include allocations for local roads from the national \n                                                 \n6  K. Gwilliam. 2007. Paving the Road for Better Capacity.

Continued financial support from \navailable  sources  would  be  required  to  help  establish  the  provincial  RMFs,  including  the \nrequired institutional structure. \n \n10.  District roads. Gwilliam's report mentioned that the RMF has been struggling to obtain \nfunds for the routine maintenance of the network (footnote 6). At the district level, the creation of \ncommunity road trust funds might address the financial needs to rural road maintenance. The \nreport  noted  that  funding  community  roads  and  their  maintenance  should  be  an  area  of \ncontinued support or assistance by multilateral donors. \n \n11.  Advisory board and secretariat. The World Bank studies (footnote 4) have argued that \na road fund should have an independent advisory board. The Lao PDR\u2019s RMF Advisory Board \nmay not be fully independent, as it is created as a department in MPWT, which exercises \noversight functions. Moreover, the RMF Advisory Board has limited powers to oversee the RMF, \nthus diluting its role. Gwilliam also found that control over the Lao PDR\u2019s road maintenance \nprogram composition and financial allocations remained with the Department of Roads.  \n \n12.  Further, the RMF secretariat is expected as an organization to be strong, stable, and \ncompetent  on  financial  management  procedures.  However,  preliminary  findings  on  the \nperformance  of  the  RMF  reported  some  operational  delays  in  revenue  collections, \nimplementation of maintenance works, and payments to contractors. These were attributed to \ninadequate technical capacities of the RMF secretariat.  \n \nC.  Support from Aid Agencies \n \n13.  The main supporters of the Lao PDR's maintenance activities have been ADB, Nordic \nDevelopment Fund, Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida), and the \nWorld  Bank.  The  last  three  have  provided  assistance  in  the  development  of  the  Road \nMaintenance Program.9 The program supported the establishment of a road fund financed from \ngradually increasing road user charges, in particular a surcharge on fuel. ADB supported the \nsetting up of the RMF and also provided funding for the periodic maintenance.10 \n \n14.  Before its exit from the Lao PDR, Sida contributed to the development and maintenance \nof  the  rural  roads  network.  In  its  2004  country  report  (footnote  9),  Sida  supported  the \ngovernment's move to raise fuel levies as a means to mobilize resources for the RMF and a \nstep  toward  sustaining  the  road  network.  Sida  has  also  provided  assistance  in  capacity \ndevelopment programs for provincial road authorities and promoted the community road model \nas an approach to road maintenance at the district levels (footnote 10). \n \nD.  Issues \n \n15.  Need for further studies. An assessment on the performance or effectiveness of the \nRMF remains largely inadequate. While aggregate assessments could be drawn particularly \nfrom the World Bank and ADB studies, there has also been a pervading view that no single \nmodel  is  the  best;  hence,  road  funds  may  well  be  analyzed  on  a  case-to-case  basis  in \naccordance with country needs. In other words, the development of road funds needs to be \n                                                 \n9  Embassy of Sweden. 2005. Sida Country Report 2004. Vientiane; and ADB. 2003.

Financial. Most studies observed gaps in meeting the targeted revenues from local \nsources and the overall level of coverage of the RMF vis-\u00e0-vis the country's financing needs. \nThe RMF's allocation formula, which favors national roads, is a matter of concern since it dilutes \nthe resources for provincial, district, and rural roads. \n \n17.  Institutional. The independence and technical capacity of the RMF secretariat and RMF \nAdvisory Board were concerns that need to be addressed. Specifically, the creation of the RMF \nunder MPWT could be seen as limiting the powers of the RMF. On the other hand, it could also \nbe argued that locating the RMF outside of MPWT supervision could lead to coordination \nproblems among rehabilitation and maintenance activities. Finally, the RMF secretariat has also \nbeen found to be wanting in capacities in planning, selection, and prioritization of maintenance \nworks, including monitoring and evaluation of projects. \n \nE.  Summary \n \n18.  In conclusion, the RMF has steadily improved its efficiency and effectiveness since \n2001. However, it has a long way to go before it can be declared a complete success. The RMF \nfollows  the  general  principles  of  the  second-generation  road  funds  established  under  the \nbroader context of road management reforms and limited resources. Its creation provides the \nmechanism by which user charges are pooled to a separate and/or dedicated fund with priority \ngiven to road maintenance. The decree that established the RMF Advisory Board included \nmembers representing both the public and private sectors. All these aspects point to a good \nfund structure. However, for this structure to succeed, it needs to receive adequate revenues. \n \n19.  Significantly, some financial and institutional issues have since affected the operations \nand  management  of  the  RMF.  These  weaknesses  were  being  addressed  by  further \nimprovements  in  human  resources,  financial  management,  and  maintenance  procedures, \namong others. These can be addressed through technical assistance for skills transfer and \ninstitutional development. \n ", "Appendix 10  89 \nSUMMARY OF THE IMPACTS OF ADB-FUNDED ROAD PROJECTS \n \n1.

Vientiane Plain Road Improvement Project \n \n2.  The implementation period for this project was from 1984 to 1987. \n \n3.  Its benefits were as follows. \n(i)  The volume of traffic observed in 1988 was higher than the traffic forecast in the \nappraisal report. Thus, the project is considered to have realized its principal \nobjective of facilitating more efficient road transport for both the main road and \nfeeder road traffic. \n(ii)  The project generated about 9,020 person-months of employment for both skilled \nand unskilled labor. \n(iii)  It spurred savings in vehicle operating costs. \n(iv)  It provided agricultural and producer surplus benefits. \n(v)  The project's social and educational benefits improved access to primary and \nsecondary schools, health care clinics, as well as community stores. \n(vi)  Bicycle access to schools was extended to about 10 kilometers (km), resulting in \nhigher school attendance. \n(vii)  Additional school facilities are now being constructed along the road. \n ", "90  Appendix 10 \n(viii)  The improved feeder roads increased intervillage traffic, primarily agricultural \nflows associated with farm-to-market access. Vientiane is now perceived as a \nmajor market center year-round. \n(ix)  There were also slight increases in consumption of luxury items like televisions \nand motorcycles, as well as liquor. \n(x)  Jobs were generated as more timber processing facilities opened (though this \nwas not mentioned as an environmental impact). \n \n4.  No negative impacts were mentioned in the PPER. \n \nB.  Second Road Improvement Project (Champasack, Pakxong, and Salavan) \n \n5.  The implementation period was from 1987 to 1996. \n \n6.  Its benefits were as follows. \n(i)  Traffic  volumes  observed  in  1995  were  considerably  higher  than  the  traffic \nforecast  at  appraisal,  while  traffic  composition  was  not  significantly  different, \nexcept for trucks. Thus, the project is considered to have realized its principal \nobjective of facilitating more efficient road transport. \n(ii)  About 18,000 person-months of employment was generated for both skilled and \nunskilled labor. \n(iii)  Vehicle operators emerged as the main beneficiaries of the reduction in vehicle \noperating costs as a result of the improved road sections. \n(iv)  Access to health care centers improved. \n(v)  Primary and secondary educational facilities were improved. \n(vi)  The numbers of markets and community stores increased.  \n(vii)  Passenger fares and truck rates indicated that a substantial amount of the initial \nsavings in vehicle operating costs was passed on to road users. \n \n7.  No negative impacts were mentioned in the project completion report. \n \nC.  Third Road Improvement Project (Vangvieng and Vientiane) \n \n8.  The implementation period was from 1988 to 1994. \n \n9.  Its benefits were as follows. \n(i)  With the improved project road, cattle raising, forestry, and logging in Phon Hong \nand Vientiane increased. \n(ii)  External assistance for irrigation, rural electrification, and forestry was set in \nmotion. \n(iii)  Improvement of the project road accelerated development of the area, including \nnew gas stations, small service industries, food markets, restaurants, shop-front \nhousing, several new factories, a new vehicle assembly plant, and new housing. \n(iv)  Tourist attractions and accommodations were developed at km 45 and in Phon \nHong. \n(v)  While  paddy  farming  still  predominates,  introduction  of  irrigation  led  to \nconsiderable tracts of farmland producing two rice crops per year instead of one. \nFish farming has been introduced as has diversification to cattle, goats, tree-type \ncrops, and vegetables. \n(vi)  At km 150, the cement factory run under a joint venture consortium between the \ngovernments of the Lao PDR and the People's Republic of China was completed. ", "Appendix 10  91 \nLimestone rock is mined for the factory. Electricity has been extended between \nPhon Hong and Vangvieng, and further on to Louangphrabang. \n(vii)  Other socioeconomic benefits listed include (a) improvements in the quality of life \nof rural residents, many of whom have immigrated from less-developed areas; \n(b)  improved  access  to  other  provinces  and  to  health  care  and  education \nservices; (c) savings in travel time between district centers; (d) opportunities for \npaid employment; and (e) improved farm incomes due to access to irrigation \nschemes and production diversification as a result of improved access and the \nopening of new markets.  \n(viii)  Improvements to the project road followed existing alignments, and the direct \nenvironmental impact of the project was minimal. \n(ix)  The provision of a bituminous seal eliminated dust problems for villages. \n(x)  In 1995, the government established the Ministry of Environment and issued \nGuidelines for Reducing Environmental Effects of Road Projects.1 Also, in 1996, \nthe  Communication  Department's  Planning  Division  of  the  Ministry  of \nCommunications, Transport, Post, and Construction established an environment \nsection through which all development projects were vetted. \n \n10.  Although functional, the cement factory was constructed in full view of the road in an \narea where scenery is an important tourist asset. Limestone quarries likewise destroyed the \nmountain views for which the area is famous. In addition, dust generated by the mining and \ncrushing presents a health hazard to the immediate areas. Thus, although considered a benefit \nin the PPER,2 it could be considered an environmental detriment. \n \nD.  Fourth and Fifth Road Improvement Projects (Louangphrabang, Pak Mong, and \nVangvieng) \n \n11.  The implementation period was from 1990 to 1997. \n \n12.  Its benefits were as follows. \n(i)  Tourism  has  increased  along  the  route,  with  centers  developing  around \nVangvieng  and  Louangphrabang,  which  was  declared  a  United  Nations \nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Site. \nIncreased convenience and security of the road have contributed to a rise in the \nnumber of tourists visiting Louangphrabang. This has enhanced the local tourism \nindustry  through  development  of  accommodations,  restaurants,  transport, \ninternet services, and handicrafts. \n(ii)  The projects had a positive effect on economic activities in the impact area. The \nfeasibility study observed that only few cash crops were grown in 1987. In 2001, \nall villages visited by the independent evaluation mission reported a variety of \nincome sources, including vegetables, papyrus-type grass (i.e., paper mulberry \ntree  or  broussenetia)  that  local  enterprises  use  for  papermaking  in  the \nLouangphrabang area and export to Thailand, and fishponds. Hmong women in \none village produce traditional embroidery and travel to Louangphrabang to send \nthe final products to relatives in the United States.

The PPER3 stated the projects' negative impacts as follows. \n(i)  Road sections that traverse mountainous terrain experienced landslides and road \nslips and continue to do so. This was, in part, anticipated at appraisal, but the \nchosen road alignment was selected as the best possible least-cost option. Other \nchoices  would  have  caused  fewer  landslides  but  would  have  required  more \nearthworks during construction, resulting in even more negative impacts. \n(ii)  Other  environmental  impacts  were  increased  logging  and  \u201cslash-and-burn\u201d \nagriculture.4 \n(iii)  An associated technical assistance (Road Infrastructure for Rural Development) \ncited  in  the  PPER  concluded  that  environmental  impacts  from  logging  and \ntrafficking  of  wildlife  and  plants  will  not  result  from  road  projects  in \nLouangphrabang and Vientiane provinces. \n \nE.  Sixth Road Improvement Project (Attapeu, Champasack, and Xekong) \n \n14.  The implementation period was from 1993 to 1999. \n \n15.  The project's environmental and socioeconomic impacts were as follows. \n(i)  The  main  component  of  the  project\u2014improvement  of  provincial  roads\u2014was \nprimarily located in sparsely populated areas and generally followed existing \nalignments. As such, land acquisition for right of way, resettlement problems, and \nchanges in land-use patterns were minimal. Tree cutting to widen the project \nroads had a moderately negative effect on the environment. \n(ii)  On the other hand, the strengthening, paving, and widening of the roads, and \nraising the embankments with proper culverts and bridges and channel treatments \nhas helped improve the environment in the project area. The smooth surface of the \nimproved roads requires less traction power, consumes less fuel, and results in \nless air pollution. Further, the smooth flow of traffic results in less noise. \n(iii)  Based  on  observations  in  the  project  area,  there  is  evidence  of  significant \ndevelopment activity along the project roads. Activities expected at appraisal \nsuch as coffee production and increased coffee yields, livestock development, \nand expansion of the electricity grid has gone forward. Overall environmental, \nsociocultural, and other development impacts are significant. \n \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2001.

The implementation period was from 1995 to 2000. \n \n17.  The project impacts were as follows. \n(i)  The project completion report (PCR)5 stated that several new industries were \nestablished  along  the  project  road  and  have  generated  jobs,  thus  reducing \npoverty in the project area. New industries include a concrete plant, import\u2013\nexport businesses, and a new plywood factory. Due to the increasing volume of \ntraffic, several villages along National Road 13 have also grown considerably. \nSurveys showed that several village shops enjoy more business, and the tourist \nresorts in the area have benefited from the influx of domestic and international \ntourists since the road was improved. \n(ii)  Improved access to social services and to markets was noted in the PPER6 as \nwell as an increase in tourism. \n(iii)  The PPER also noted that the road has reduced travel by villagers because \ntraders come to the village to buy and sell. \n(iv)  Access to social services and markets have improved due to reduced transit time \nbetween  communities.  Travel  time  savings  have  not  been  estimated  for \nreevaluation, as it was not calculated at the appraisal stage. A survey conducted \namong local people suggested that travel times had been reduced by more than \nhalf, however. \n(v)  The PPER cited conclusions of a separate study that the road benefits only \nnonpoor.7 \n(vi)  Also, the PPER noted that negative environmental impacts resulted from damage \nand lack of clean-up during road construction and the excessive cutting of forests \nat km 26. According to the PPER, the International Union for Conservation of \nNature complained publicly on the latter. \n \nG.  Xieng Khouang Road Improvement Project \n \n18.  The implementation period was from 1998 to 2002. \n \n19.  The project impacts were as follows. \n(i)  The main impact of the project as envisaged at appraisal was to promote national \nand provincial economic growth. The provincial annual gross domestic product \ngrowth rate in the project area prior to the project was about 5%. Annual growth \nduring 1998\u20132003 was 6% and during 2003\u20132005 around 7%. \n(ii)  The incidence of poverty in the project area declined from 49% in 2000 to about \n30% in 2005.8 \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2001.

The number \nof secondary schools in the project area increased from 38 in 2000 to 259 in \n2005. There is also a number of new hotels in Phonsavan. \n(iv)  Electricity is now available to many residents on National Road 7 due to the \ninfrastructure provided by Electricit\u00e9 du Lao. Income per capita in the project \narea increased from $263 in 2000 to $360 in 2005. \n(v)  An environmental management plan was not done prior to the commencement of \nthe project, and it was not until problems were encountered later that mitigations \nwere implemented, but only very slowly according to the PCR.9 Implementation \nof the plan was finally completed, except for tree planting, which was canceled by \nthe  Embassy  of  Japan  and  characterized  in  the  PCR  as  mainly  a  road \nbeautification component, and not necessary for strictly environmental reasons. \n \nH.  East\u2013West Corridor Project (Savannakhet) \n \n20.  The implementation period was from 2000 to 2004. \n \n21.  The PPER10 reported that the project opened up markets and enhanced consumer \nchoices  through  (i)  cheaper  prices,  and  (ii)  product  availability  and  diversity.  Improved \nconnectivity along the corridor also helped form surplus areas of production, which resulted in \nchanges in the livelihood and living standards of local residents. Overall, the project made \nsubstantial positive contributions within the impact area. \n \n22.  Though the project impact varied according to household resources, large-scale farmers \nand cross-border traders experienced the highest sales and income increases. Some shifting \ncultivators,  who  adopted  sedentary  farming  systems  using  new  technologies,  reported  a \n10%\u221220% increase in income. \n \n23.  Environmental and social concerns were incorporated in the project design through the \ninclusion  of  mitigation  measures.  These  measures  included  implementation  of  specific \nsafeguards  to  address  issues  such  as  the  spread  of  sexually  transmitted  infections  and \nHIV/AIDS during construction. \n \n24.  On the Lao PDR side, the project did not create any serious adverse environmental \nimpacts.  But  some  agriculture  or  productive  land  was  lost  to  residential  or  industrial \ndevelopment, and sustaining forest conservation was a matter of concern. \n \n25.  In 2006, regional technical assistance11 was funded by ADB to examine the impact on \npoverty of regional economic integration (REI), and the National Economic Research Institute of \nthe Lao PDR looked closely at the impacts around the border crossing point at Dansavan. A \nconsultant report on the research methodology noted that  \nAlthough it was not my purpose to become too involved with the content, it is fair to say \nthat local communities in the near vicinity of border crossing points do not currently \nbenefit from REI in the form of improved roads and transportation, and in most cases are \nnegatively  impacted  and  impoverished  by  having  their  land  and  natural  resources \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2006.

Thus, \nproviding mitigations and viable solutions to negative impacts will not happen through \nany planning process at the present time and in the near future. Positive actions are \nthose that local villagers have developed on their own and remain in the domain of the \ninformal sector. And these may or may not be in accord with what is considered to be \n\u201clegal\u201d since in many instances official policies have outlawed traditional livelihoods and \nhave made it impossible to be legitimate and at the same time to survive.12 \n \n26.  The National Economic Research Institute remarked that the markets at Dansavan on \nthe Lao PDR side are dominated by Vietnamese traders, with little or no Lao PDR participation. \nIt indicated that REI thinking has downplayed the asymmetrical relationships between countries \nand has no safeguards in place to help balance out the lack of equity. The same conditions are \nseen at Boten on the border with the People's Republic of China, where markets are dominated \nby the Chinese. Thus, without additional assistance, the Lao PDR might not realize projected \neconomic benefits.  \n \nI.  Rural Access Roads Project (Attapeu, Houaphan, and Vientiane) \n \n27.  The implementation period was from 2001 to 2006. \n \n28.

Of the four roads selected for inclusion in this project, only C3 and C4 are actually rural \naccess roads in the developmental sense. The other two consist of a strategic road with a \nnational security function (C2) and the completion of a national highway linking two inland \nprovincial capitals (C1).  \n \n30.  In  Houaphan  (C4),  a  component  consisting  of  three  feeder  roads  was  added  to \ncomplement United Nations Drug Control Programme (United Nations Office on Drugs and \nCrime) and government plans to eradicate opium. It was determined that because livelihoods of \nminorities would be affected through loss of opium sales, ethnic minority development plans \nwould be necessary for each feeder road. \n \n31.  Yet for the main roads of the project, a separate ethnic minority development plan was \nnot required because (i) most of the ethnic minorities were integrated into the wider community; \n(ii) project impacts related mainly to resettlement, and the project included specific actions for \nethnic minorities; and (iii) significant economic benefits from improved access were expected for \nall populations within the project zone of influence. \n                                                 \n12 Joint Research Center. 2006.

The  Government  of  the  Lao  People's  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  has  long \nconsidered the importance of incorporating environmental and social considerations into road \nprojects. Policies and laws have been crafted to address the need for environmental protection \nand management. Since 1999, the Environmental Protection Law has been the central piece of \nlegislation and main instrument for environmental protection and management in the Lao PDR. \nFurther,  Environmental  Assessment  Regulations  (1770/STEA  2000)  were  issued  and  have \ndefined  the  requirements  and  procedures  for  environmental  impact  assessments  of \ndevelopment projects. In addition, the Road Law (1999) requires that road construction be \nundertaken in accordance with public safety and environmental protection considerations. \n \n2.  Subsequent  regulations  were  issued  in  2003  by  the  Ministry  of  Communication, \nTransport, Post, and Construction for the environmental impact assessments of road projects \n(Decree  2929/MCTPC),  including  provisions  on  screening,  scoping,  public  involvement, \nenvironmental management plan and implementation, content, review, and approval. Similarly, \nimportance was also given to social safeguards. A Prime Minister's decree (192/PM 2005) and \nregulations concerning compensation and resettlement of development projects, issued in 2005, \ndefine  the  principles,  rules,  and  measures  to  mitigate  adverse  social  impacts  and  to \ncompensate for damages resulting from involuntary acquisition or repossession of land and \nassets. Also included were articles specific to concerns on ethnic minority groups requiring the \npreparation of a development plan if necessary. \n \n3.  Recently, the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT) has moved further to \nstrengthen  its  commitment  to  incorporating  environmental  and  social  considerations  in  road \nprojects through the release of its 2008 Environmental and Social Operations Manual. This \nmanual serves as a reference point for harmonizing the law and regulations of the Lao PDR with \nthe requirements of project donors and development partners. It acknowledges the need to \naddress  safeguard  policies  of  project  donors  and  development  partners,  including  the  three \nsafeguard policies of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). It advocates the general principle of \nsafeguard assessment and echoes the objectives of ADB safeguard policies, that is, to avoid, \nminimize,  or  mitigate  harmful  environmental  impact,  social  costs,  and  marginalization  of \nvulnerable groups that may result from development projects. The manual will be approved after \nits pilot testing in some selected provinces. \n \n4.  Full implementation of the Environmental and Social Operations Manual means there are \nsufficient  regulations  in  the  Lao  PDR  to  require  the  necessary  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards during project preparation and implementation. These regulations are in line with the \nsafeguard  policies  of  project  donors  and  development  partners,  including  ADB,  Swedish \nInternational  Development  Cooperation  Agency  (Sida),  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme  (UNDP),  and  World  Bank.  It  takes  into  account  safeguard  policies  commonly \ntriggered in road projects such as those related to environmental impact assessments, natural \nhabitats, forestry, indigenous peoples, involuntary resettlement, and cultural property. \n \n5.  Although there is good policy support, the institutional capacity of the Department of \nRoads, within MPWT, to enforce safeguard requirements and to monitor their implementation is \nquestionable.  The  recent  reorganization  within  MPWT  has  temporarily  weakened  the \ninstitutional  capacity  of  the  Department  of  Roads.  The  newly  created  Environmental  and \nTechnical Division (ETD), which merged the former Environment and Social Division with the \nPlanning and Technical Division, is tasked with mainstreaming the social and environmental ", "Appendix 12  101 \naspects in the road subsector. During reorganization, staff specialists of the former Environment \nand Social Division were transferred to MPWT\u2019s Public Transport Institute as a new unit that will \nhandle policy-level work for the entire ministry. This move left ETD without any staff members \nwho have the necessary skills for safeguard work. \n \n6.  Restoring ETD\u2019s capacity is an urgent task for the government. In the past, ADB has \nprovided assistance to the Lao PDR for capacity building, specifically regarding safeguards. As \nreflected  in  the  recent  country  strategy  and  program,1  support  for  building  capacity  to \nincorporate environmental considerations into development planning is a key focus area for \nenvironmental initiatives. The country strategy and program also indicates that ADB will provide \nsupport to mitigate potential negative social impacts arising from road development, such as \ntrafficking of drugs and humans, transmission of HIV/AIDS, and other sexually transmitted \ninfections. However, the country strategy and program needs to be backed up by specific \nassistance. On the MPWT side, its institutional capacity needs to be sustained to ensure the \neffectiveness of external assistance. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

Manila. \n ", "MANAGEMENT RESPONSE TO THE SECTOR ASSISTANCE PROGRAM EVALUATION \nFOR THE TRANSPORT SECTOR IN THE LAO PEOPLE\u2019S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC \n \n \n \nOn  8  November  2010,  the  Director  General,  Independent  Evaluation  Department, \nreceived the following response from the Managing Director General on behalf of Management: \n \n \nI.  General Comments \n \n1.  We appreciate the IED report and its comprehensive analysis of ADB\u2019s \nassistance in the transport sector. We concur with the overall assessment that \nADB\u2019s program has been successful and that ADB\u2019s performance in the sector \nhas overall been satisfactory. \n \n2.  Before responding to the specific recommendations, we note that the \nreport would benefit from some clarifications. First, the characterization of ADB\u2019s \nprogramming in the sector as \u201cdisconnected\u201d (para. 73) is misleading. The report \nacknowledges  that  the  transport  sector  faces  funding  constraints  due  to  the \ncountry-level  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  allocation.  Accessing  the  ADF \nsubregional allocation pool to finance transport projects that support subregional \ncooperation does not crowd out national transport projects; in fact, because Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) is a land-locked country, many of the \nroads improved through the subregional allocation are national roads. Second, \nwhile the report indicates that the quality of design and monitoring frameworks \ncan  be  improved  and  acknowledges  efforts  to  improve  the  quality  of  these \nframeworks (para. 82), the report does not acknowledge that these efforts have \nresulted in substantive quality improvements. Third, we are concerned about the \nassessment that the efficiency of ADB\u2019s assistance has deteriorated since 2006, \nand is rated as less efficient based on the performance of five road projects \ncompleted between 2000 and 2009 (paras. 85 & 86). While describing the same \nconcerns  over  delays  and  cost  overruns,  the  Country  Assistance  Program \nEvaluation (CAPE) (para. 43) rates nine out of 10 completed road projects as \nefficient as reflected in economic internal rates of return(EIRRs). While the report \n \nattributes  this  downgrading  to  the  inclusion  of  a  new  criterion  (i.e., \nimplementation efficiency), it appears that the performance of one project has \npulled down the average. \n \nII.  Comments on Specific Recommendations \n \n3.  Recommendation  1:  Capacity  Development  -  Support  the \ngovernment in the development of integrated capacity-building programs \n(instead  of  one-off  TA)  in  specific  areas.  We  agree.  We  are  currently \npreparing  support  for  an  integrated  capacity-building  program  as  a  core \ncomponent of the proposed Southern Link Transport Project, which is scheduled \nfor Board consideration in 2012. The proposed 2011 project preparatory TA for \nthis Project will help to develop a multi-year capacity building program, which will \ninclude  support  for:  (i)  planning  and  prioritizing  of  road  improvements;  (ii) \nstrengthening the institutional arrangements and performance standards for road \nmaintenance; (iii) implementing environmental and social safeguards; and (iv) \nmonitoring implementation. This capacity building program will be designed to ", "2 \nattract additional grant co-financing from development partners, which will further \nstrengthen capacity development. \n \n4.  Recommendation  2:  Project-readiness  filters  -  Improve \nimplementation performance of ADB transport projects by mainstreaming \nproject-readiness filters to assess the institutional preparedness within the \ngovernment for implementing a new project. We agree. The project readiness \nfilters developed by the Lao Resident Mission (LRM) will be further improved in \n2011  by:  (i)  incorporating  requirements  under  the  Streamlined  Business \nProcesses; (ii) making them more specific and relevant to transport projects; and \n(iii)  including  institutional  capacity  criteria.  To  mainstream  these  filters,  the \nupcoming Country Partnership Strategy to be finalized in 2011 will refer to their \nusefulness and application. \n \n5.  Recommendation  3:  Coordination  of  assistance  -  Work  in \nconjunction  with  the  government  to  improve  development  agency \ncoordination  in  the  areas  of  knowledge  sharing  and  implementation \nmonitoring.  We  agree.  The  creation  of  a  Transport  Sector  Working  Group \n(TSWG)  has  been  discussed  with  the  Government  as  a  means  to  promote \ngreater  coordination  among  development  agencies  and  the  Government  in \nknowledge  management  and  implementation  monitoring.  The  TSWG  will  be \nestablished in 2011, and will first focus on: (i) sharing of knowledge regarding the \ntransport sector; and (ii) monitoring project implementation. The TSWG will have \nquarterly  meetings  that  will  include  the  participation  of  LRM  and  other \ndevelopment  agency  staff  based  in  Vientiane.  As  recommended  in  the  IED \nreport, the annual multipartite meeting will include ADB staff from headquarters. \n ", "DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVENESS COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD \n \nChair\u2019s Summary of the Committee Discussion on 10 November 2010 \n \nSector  Assistance  Program  Evaluation  for  the  Transport  Sector  in  the  Lao  People's \nDemocratic Republic (DOC.IN.260-10)  \n \n1.  DEC members viewed that ADB has been focusing more on regional road projects as \ncompared to rural and provincial roads. Members also inquired as to how ADB has addressed \nissues on road maintenance and road safety that were raised in previous CAPEs. \n \n2.  Director, SETU described how the focus in the past was on national roads to meet the \nGovernment\u2019s priority to emphasize international linkage and in the future there will be projects \nfor rural roads. On road maintenance, he noted that capacity building programs have been \nimplemented with the objective of delegating road maintenance to provincial governments. \nFurther,  in  road  projects  since  2007  road  safety  aspects  have  been  built  in  as  project \ncomponents. Road safety is important not only to ADB, but also to co-financiers. \n \nConclusions \n \n3.  DEC members noted with satisfaction the steady progress made by LAO PDR. The \nCountry grew at a compounded rate of 7% per year during 2000-2009, reduced its external \npublic debt as a proportion of GDP from 80% in 2005 to 54% in 2009. \n \n4.  There was solid progress in rural electrification. Overall access to electricity increased \nrapidly from 17% of households in 1995 to more than 60% in 2009. \n \n5.  Lao PDR, from being a net energy importer, has become a net energy exporter, and is \non its way to achieve its ambition of becoming the regional power battery. \n \n6.  Members expressed their satisfaction that certain facilitating laws, like water and water \nresources law, environmental protection law, environmental and social sustainability of the \nhydropower sector law, and amendment of the environmental protection law, were under way. \n \n7.  Members also noted that Nam Theun 2 has been successfully completed and sufficient \nprogress has been made in implementing environment and social safeguards. It is now a world-\nclass hydropower plant.    \n \n8.  Members noted that the road network has increased by 78% over the last decade, from \n20,000 kilometers in 1997 to 35,558 kilometers in 2009. Roads have had positive impact in \nameliorating rural poverty.    \n \n9.  Members underlined the need for improving implementation of projects and reducing the \nlarge delays observed in the past. There was a need for improving coordination, strengthening \nthe LRM, and having a medium to long-term strategy based on policies and programs in various \nsectors. Furthermore, members noted that given the importance of hydroelectric power in Lao \nPDR and that hydroelectric power is a renewable energy source, ADB, including through the \nprivate sector, should remain engaged in the upstream generation projects. \n \n \n \n                      (signed) \n              Ashok K.
