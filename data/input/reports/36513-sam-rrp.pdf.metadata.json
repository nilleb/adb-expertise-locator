The  Project  will  complement  and \nexpand  Education  Sector  Project  II  2006\u20132012  (ESP II) activities  to \ninclude ICT competencies and best practices for developing and using \ne-learning  resources  in  classroom  teaching  and  learning  processes. \nThis will enhance the quality of education and cost-effectively improve \nstudent  learning  outcomes  in  six  academic  subjects  aligned  to  the \nESP  II  priorities  of  mathematics  and  science.  It  will  also  support  the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts to improve the overall efficiency of the education \nsector  and  help  to  develop  management  models  and  partnership \narrangements to ensure the sustainability of the project outcomes. The \nProject  will  foster  the  use  of  the  Internet,  where  possible,  and \ncommunication  among  schools  domestically  and  internationally.  The \nGovernment,  through  its  Samoa  Development  Strategy  2005\u20132007 \n(SDS) and Strategic Policies and Plan July 2006\u2013June 2015 (SPP), is \nfully  committed  to  achieving  efficiency  and  quality  goals  in  education \nand aligning the education sector with the national ICT strategy.  \n \nThe  Project  will  have  four  main  components:  (i) improving  the  quality \nof teaching and learning in secondary schools; (ii) improving access to \neducation \nthe  Community  Access \nProgram  and  developing  its  partnerships;  and  (iv) strengthening \nimproving \nincluding \neducation  management  and  coordination, \nanalyses of economic efficiency, equity, and sustainability. \n \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  in  two  stages.  This  will  allow  the \nGovernment  to  assess  the  impact  of  SchoolNet  and  ICT  on  learning \noutcomes  and  postsecondary  employment,  and  will  contribute  to \nstrengthening the research and evaluation capacity of MESC.  \n \n\nICT;  (iii) establishing \n\nthrough \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nRationale \n\n \n\n \n\nEducation  remains  a  priority  of  the  SDS.  The  sector  has  shown \nsignificant achievements, including an adult literacy rate of 98.7%, the \nhighest  in  the  Pacific  region.  About  90%  of  grade  8  completers  have \naccess \nto  secondary  education.  Gender  disparities  have  been \neliminated  at  the  primary  level  and  are  declining  at  the  secondary \nlevel.  \n\nfor \n\nlearning \n\nDespite  many  achievements  in  education,  however,  the  quality  and \nefficiency  of  education  remain  disappointing.  Variations  in  student\u2019s \nlearning  achievements  and  opportunities \nremain \nsignificant, particularly between urban and rural areas. In 2006, the net \nenrollment  rate  at  the  primary  level  was  69%,  while  the  gross \nenrollment  rate  was  97%.  More  than  25%  of  students  enrolled  in \nprimary  education  did  not  complete  the  8-year  program.  The  same \nyear, the dropout rate was 7% for grades 1\u20132, 5% for grade 8, 18% for \ngrades  10\u201311,  3%  for  grade  12,  and  as  high  as  41%  for  grade  13. \nRepetition  rates  at  grades  1,  8,  11,  12,  and  13  are  high  and  largely \nchanged since 1997. In 2006, 88% of primary students progressed to \nlower  secondary  level  and  91%  to  upper  secondary  level,  but  only \nabout 53% of 12th graders advanced to grade 13.  \n\nMany of the issues in the education sector will be addressed under the \nongoing  ESP  II.  However,  ESP  II  has  limited  emphasis  on  using  ICT \nas  a  tool  to  enhance  student  learning  outcomes  or  to  manage  the \neducation  system.  The  Project  will  link  with  ESP II  to  complement \nactivities under it and will be implemented within the ESP II structure to \naddress  these  issues.  MESC\u2019s  capacity  will  be  strengthened  to \nimplement additional activities under the Project.  \n\nInternational  evidence  indicates  the  importance  of  ICT  capacity  and \nskills  as  a  key  factor  for  national  and  global  economic  development. \nThe  Government  is  committed  to  introducing  ICT  in  education.  The \nProject  provides  an  opportunity  for  MESC  to  meet  its  ICT  objectives, \nbuilding on lessons learned in the SchoolNet pilot funded by the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB).  Samoa  will  be  the  first  Pacific  developing \nmember  country  to  provide  universal  access  to  ICT-based  instruction \nand  Internet  access  to  secondary  schools.  The  design  of  the  Project \nwill provide important information on the costs and effectiveness of ICT \nfor student achievement and future employment.  \n \nThe Samoa experience will be of great value to other countries in the \nPacific  and  to  the  development  community  toward  further  developing \nICT strategies. The issue of ICT literacy is of particular importance in \nSamoa,  as  35%  of  the  population  works  overseas  and  remittances \nconstitute 17% of the gross national income.  \n \n\nImpact and Outcome  The  proposed  Project  will  help  the  Government  achieve  a  more \nequitable  and  effective  ICT-enhanced  education  system  and  promote \nlife-long  learning.  The  outcome  of  the  Project  will  be  enhanced \nlearning  outcomes  for  secondary  students  and  improved  knowledge \nsharing through ICT. \n \n\n\f \n\nProject Investment \nPlan \n \nFinancing Plan \n \n \n \n\n \n\nGrant Amount and \nTerms \n\nThe total project cost is estimated at $6.90 million equivalent, including \ncontingencies, local taxes, and duties. \n \n\n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \nTotal \n\n \n\n \n     Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nTotal \n5.9 \n1.0 \n\n6.9 \n\n \n \n \n \n\nPercent \n85 \n15 \n\n100 \n\nADB  will  provide  a  grant  of  $5.9 million  from  its  Special  Funds \nresources  to  finance  85%  of  the  total  project  cost.

The existing ESP II Education \nSteering Committee will be responsible for the Project and may co-opt \nmembers  to  include  other  main  project  stakeholders  and  so  provide \nstrategic  direction  and  oversight \nthe  Project.  The  Steering \nCommittee  will  meet  as  necessary  but  not  less  than  once  every  6 \nmonths. A Technical Advisory Committee will be established to advise \nthe  Steering  Committee  on  technical  matters.  It  will  consist  of \nrepresentatives  with  ICT  expertise  from  local  information  technology \nInformation \nthe  Ministry  of  Communications  and \ncompanies, \nTechnology,  Samoan \nInformation  Technology  Society,  National \nUniversity of Samoa, and MESC. MESC will have overall responsibility \nfor  managing  project  implementation,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and \nreporting  progress,  in  coordination  with  ESP II.  At  the  operational \nlevel,  the  Project  will  be  managed  by  the  MESC  Core  Executive  and \nsupported  by  the  Office  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  SchoolNet \nproject manager, and ESP II Secretariat.  \n \nAll components of the Project will be implemented through the existing \nMESC  organizational  structure  and  coordinated  with  the  ESP II \nimplementation  schedule.  The  Project  has  a  2-stage  design,  with \nstage 2 contingent upon successful completion of stage 1. Consulting \nservices  will  be  provided  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  Core \nExecutive  to  deliver  the Project.  MESC  will  appoint  a  full-time  project \nmanager, who will work in coordination with the MESC Core Executive \nand ESP II coordinator and assist in procurement, planning, reporting, \nmonitoring, and record keeping. The project manager will report to the \nMESC Core Executive.

All  procurement  packages  valued  to  be \nabove $1 million will be procured following the international competitive \nbidding procedures. Procurement of equipment up to $1 million will be \nprocured using national competitive bidding and procurement of goods \nand services below $100,000 will follow shopping procedures. \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  about  72  person-months  of  international  and \n108  person-months  of  national  consulting  services.  All  international \nand  associated  national  consultants  will  be  selected  and  recruited  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007, \nas amended from time to time). Most international consulting services \nwill  be  provided  by  one  firm.  Provision  is  made  to  recruit  individual \nconsultants  for  the  project  management  adviser  position  and  for  the \nunallocated  person-months  as  needed  during  the  life  of  the  Project. \nThe  Project  will  use  the  quality-based  selection  method  to  recruit  a \nfirm.  \n \nThe Project will benefit students, teachers, and communities in Samoa \nby  (i) improving  learning  tools,  education  curricula,  and  student \nlearning  outcomes;  (ii) establishing  communication  access  points  for \nschools  and  communities;  (iii) establishing  school  management  tools; \n(iv) building  capacity  in  the  use  of  ICT  and  in  financial  planning, \nresearch,  and  evaluation;  and  (v) enhancing  partnership  across \ngovernment agencies with donors and other stakeholders. In addition, \nother  Pacific  developing  member  countries  and  donor  organizations, \nincluding  ADB,  will  benefit \nthe \nfrom \nimplementation  and  evaluation  of  the  first  comprehensive  national \nSchoolNet  program  in  the  region.  The  provision  of  national  coverage \nthrough \nin  data  communications  equipment  will \nsignificantly  lower  the  cost  of  eventually  extending  ICT  to  primary \nschools and other institutions.  \n \nRisks  associated  with  the  Project  are  (i) uncertain  long-term  financial \nsupport  for  the  system,  (ii) weak  managerial  capacity  to  support \nschools  and  teachers,  and  (iii) potential  lack  of  interest  in  the \ncommunity. \n \nIt  is  assumed  that  the  Government  will  maintain  its  commitments  to \nthis  Project  and  develop  and  enforce  appropriate  policy.  It  is  also \nassumed  that  MESC  will  recruit  and  retain  managerial  and  technical \nstaff to support the initiative.  \n\ninvestments \n\nthrough \n\nlessons \n\nlearned \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto  the  Independent  State  of  Samoa  for  the  SchoolNet  and  Community  Access  Project  (the \nProject). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nSamoa is an independent Pacific island country with a small but open economy. Lack of \n2. \nopportunity  and  income  vulnerability,  often  exacerbated  by  external  economic  shocks  and \nnatural  disasters,  contribute  to  hardship  in  rural  areas,  particularly  on  the  island  of  Savai\u2019i. \nDespite  its  vulnerability,  Samoa  has  experienced  stability  and  moderate  economic  growth.  Its \nreal gross domestic product (GDP) grew between 1993 and 2007 by an annual average of 4%, \nthe highest rate among Pacific island economies. Poverty is not a problem; private remittances \nfrom  the  35%  of  the  population  living  abroad  are  substantial  (17%  of  gross  national  income), \nand  the  extended  family  system  redistributes  income  effectively.  External  aid  represented \n11.5% of gross national income in 2005. The 1999 Pacific Human Development Report ranked \nSamoa  seventh  among  15  developing  island  economies  in  the  Pacific  region,  and  Samoa \nranked 75th globally in the 2006 Human Development Report.1  \n \nEducation  remains  a  priority  for  the  Government.  The  sector  has  shown  significant \n3. \nachievements, including an adult literacy rate of 98.7%,2 the highest in the region. About 90% of \ngrade  8  completers  have  access  to  secondary  education.  Gender  disparities  have  been \neliminated  at  the  primary  level  and  are  declining  at  the  secondary  level.3 Samoa  has  made \nconsiderable progress toward achieving Education for All targets and Millennium Development \nGoals, and management capacity in the Ministry of Education, Sports, and Culture (MESC) has \nbeen substantially strengthened. All this provides a foundation for further developing the sector. \n \nIn April 2007, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and MESC confirmed their commitment to \n4. \nexpanding  SchoolNet  and  the  Community  Access  Project  (CAP),  and  requested  grant  funding \nfrom  ADB  to  (i) consolidate  the  work  undertaken  in  the  SchoolNet  pilot,  (ii) provide  technical \nsupport  to  integrate  the  e-learning  approach  in  the  Education  Sector Project  II  (ESP II),  and \n(iii) expand SchoolNet to include additional schools and their respective communities to bridge \nthe digital divide and increase employability and knowledge sharing.4  \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis    \n\n5. \nDespite  good  progress  in  education,  significant  challenges  persist.  Variations  in \nstudent\u2019s  opportunities  for  learning  and  learning  achievement  remain  significant,  particularly \nbetween  urban  and  rural  areas.  High  expenditures  on  education  (equivalent  to  8.7%  of  GDP \nand  29.9%  of  total  government  expenditures  for  (FY)  2006\u20132007  have  not  provided  the \n\n                                                 \n1  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Pacific Human Development Report 1999; Human Development \n\nReport 2006. Colombo. \n\n2   Based on the 2001 census. Data from the new census conducted in October 2006 are not yet available.  \n3   An emerging characteristic of education in Samoa is that, as a group, girls perform better than boys, and there is a \nneed  to  address  this  situation  (Ministry  of  Education,  Sports,  and  Culture.  2006.  Strategic  Policies  and  Plan  July \n2006\u2013June 2015. Apia [p.12]. \n\n4   During  the  Fact-Finding  Mission,  the  Government  requested  that  the  Project  cover  all  government  and  mission \nsecondary  schools  as  they  have  better  infrastructure  than  primary  schools.  ADB  agreed  in  line  with  evidence  in \nBritish  Education  Communication  Technology  Agency  studies  that  information  and  communications  technology \ninterventions had better applicability at the secondary level. Coverage in all 22 districts will lay the groundwork for \neventual expansion to the primary level. \n\n\f 2 \n\neducational  outcomes  envisaged.5 In  2006,  the  net  enrollment  rate  at  the  primary  level  was \n69%,  while  the  gross  enrollment  rate  was  97%.  More  than  25%  of  the  students  enrolled  in \nprimary education did not complete the 8-year program. The same year, the dropout rate was \n18% for grades 10\u201311, 3% for grade 12, and as high as 41% for grade 13. Repetition rates at \ngrades  11,  12,  and  13  are  high,  and  have  not    changed  since  1997.  Also  in  2006,  88%  of \nprimary students progressed to lower secondary level and 91% progressed to upper secondary \nlevel, but only 53% of 12th graders advanced to grade 13. A major effort is required to address \nthe  problems  of  equity,  relevance,  and  quality  of  learning  achievements,  as  well  as  the \neffectiveness of resource utilization. MESC\u2019s Strategic Policies and Plan July 2006\u2013June 2015 \n(SPP)  identifies  deficiencies  in  the  education  sector  that  need  to  be  addressed.  Appendix  2 \nprovides an analysis of the sector.  \n \nMany of the issues in the sector will be addressed under the ongoing ESP II 2006\u20132012 \n6. \nto  achieve  better  learning  outcomes  for  both  primary  and  secondary  students.  ESP  II  was \napproved  in  2005  and  is  supported  by  ADB,  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development \n(AusAID),  New  Zealand  Agency  for  International  Development  (NZAID),  and  the  Government \nusing a sectorwide approach (SWAp).6 ESP II focuses on (i) curriculum reform and assessment \nsystems;  (ii) developing  effective  teachers;  (iii) improving  access  to  high-quality  education; \n(iv) strengthening  capacity  to  undertake  research,  evaluation,  and  policy  analysis;  and \n(v) planning\u2014as  well  as  strengthening  capacity  to  implement  and  manage  development \nprojects.  Since  ESP II  effectiveness  in  mid-2006,  MESC  has  completed  various  activities \nincluding  overall  coordination  and  reporting  arrangements.  However,  ESP II  uses  mainly \ntraditional  methods  to  achieve  high  quality  and  efficiency  in  the  sector.  Its  scope  does  not \ninclude  well-conceptualized,  integrated,  and  sustainable  capacity-development  activity  to \nsupport information and communications technology (ICT) as a tool to enhance student learning \noutcomes and manage the education system.  \n \nICT  plays  an  important  role  in  good  education.7 ICT  capacities\u2014such  as  simulation, \n7. \nmind maps, illustration of complex and abstract concepts and results, collaboratively working on \nprojects, and accessing extensive global databases for new ideas\u2014both enhance the quality of \nthe  learning  experience  and  significantly  motivate  students.  The  imperative  for  education  is  to \nincrease access to ICT and inculcate among students the capacity to adopt life-long learning, to \nconstantly seek and critically analyze new information, and to develop capacity to use ICT as a \ntool to cope with the challenges of a fast-changing world. Innovations in ICT, together with the \nassociated productivity tools, are increasingly changing the socioeconomic landscape of many \ncountries.  Yet  in  Samoa,  access  to  ICT  facilities  is  still  limited.  The  ICT  policy  of  the \nGovernment is to ensure access for all Samoans with a focus on introducing ICT in education. \nThe capacity of ICT and associated tools that can be provided through SchoolNet needs to be \nembedded  within  an  e-learning  vision  to  achieve  the  Government\u2019s  policy  objective.  To \ncomplement the activities of ESP II and address the problem, the Project will be implemented in \ncoordination with ESP II and incorporate an e-learning and e-training approach to support all 42 \ngovernment and mission secondary schools (out of a total of 44 secondary schools). It will also \n\n                                                 \n5   These figures include both government allocations and external support to the sector.  \n6  AusAID  and  NZAID  participated  in  the  Fact-Finding  Mission  for  the  proposed  Project  and  provided  extensive \ncomments on the draft project design. AusAID and NZAID may provide support to learning center administration by \nproviding youth ambassadors and volunteers, as well as study tours to New Zealand and Australia for staff of the \nCurriculum Materials and Assessment Division and MESC IT Unit for capacity development. \n\n7   In  recent  years,  ADB  has  implemented  projects  in  the  area  of  ICT  in  education  (Supplementary  Appendix  A).  A \nmajor  international  conference  on  ICT  in  education  was  held  on  16\u201318  October  2007.  Government  officials  from \ndeveloping member countries and private sector ICT providers attended, indicating the changing focus at ADB.  \n\n\f   \n\n3\n\n \n\nprovide  community  access  to  the  learning  centers  that  will  be  established  in  all  42  secondary \nschools to support life-long learning and business operations.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nRecent  reviews  of  the  education  sector8 identified  several  issues  related  to  access  to \n8. \nhigh-quality education, as discussed below. The Government, through its Samoa Development \nStrategy 2005\u20132007 (SDS) and SPP, is fully committed to achieving efficiency and quality goals \nin  education.  Though  primary  education  efficiency  and  quality  issues  will  be  addressed  under \nESP II, access and quality issues at the secondary level will need attention to improve student \nlearning outcomes and systemwide efficiency.  \n \nLack  of  Access  to  High  Quality  Secondary  Education.  High-quality  learning \n9. \nopportunities  are  not  available  to  all  students.  Schoolchildren  and  teachers  outside  Apia  are \nphysically isolated from those in the capital and have limited access to good teaching resources, \nlibrary  facilities,  and  alternative  knowledge  sources.  Similarly,  well-trained  teachers  with \nadequate  skills  to  effectively  facilitate  learning  and  manage  classroom  activities  are  in  short \nsupply, especially in rural areas. Rural teachers cannot travel often to Apia for in-service training \nand refresher courses. They tend to be isolated, with poor interaction with their peers and little \nopportunity to exchange professional experiences.  \n \n10. \nThe key concepts of quality and efficiency require urgent attention, as noted in MESC\u2019s \nSPP.  This  concern  is  consistent  with  new  initiatives  directed  at  understanding  how  efficiency \nand quality are linked. A consensus is emerging that an economic definition of efficiency (which \nincludes the quality dimension) is essential in assessing a system\u2019s efficiency. Research shows \nthat differences in individual earnings and rates of economic growth are more closely linked to \naverage performance on international standardized tests than on average years of schooling.9 \nDevelopment  agencies  now  focus  on  quality  and  unit  cost  data  as  the  bases  for  assessing \nefficiency.  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  stress  learning  outcomes,  rather  than  enrollment,  as  key \nefficiency targets.10  \n \n11. \nUse of ICT to Improve Access, Quality, and Efficiency in Education. The provision \nof ICT-enhanced learning centers in all 22 districts, adaptation of a curriculum, and provision of \nlearning  materials  that support  the use  of  ICT skills  across  a  range  of curriculum  subjects  are \nnecessary to ensure an active ICT role in the education system. An ICT-based curriculum also \nrequires  a  new  set  of  assessment  strategies  that  measure  not  just  traditional  knowledge \nacquisition  but  specific  skills  and  ICT  competencies,  problem-solving  and  research  capacity, \nand the development of higher cognitive skills. In terms of curriculum development, the inclusion \nof ICT-related skills and opportunities presents new and unfamiliar challenges, and MESC will \nneed  to  examine  a  range  of  model  ICT-based  curricula  from  different  countries.  Curriculum \nMaterials and Assessment Division (CMAD) staff will need training to adopt and manage the e-\nlearning curriculum.  \n \n \n                                                 \n8   ADB.  2005.

From Schooling Access to \nLearning  Outcomes:  An  Unfinished  Agenda\u2014An  Evaluation  of  World  Bank  Support  to  Primary  Education. \nWashington, DC.  \n\n \n\n\f 4 \n\nICT  is  a  tool  that  can  significantly  improve  teachers\u2019  access  to  training,  allow  them  to \n12. \nactively  communicate  with  peers,  and  address  issues  of  isolation.  But,  even  when  teachers \nhave  access  to  ICT  tools,  they  rarely  use  them  effectively  for  lack  of  confidence.  To  develop \nconfidence,  they  need  both  generalized  ICT  skills  training  and  training  in  the  use  of  ICT  in  a \nrange  of  individual  subjects.  Significant  additional  training  is  therefore  required.  The  national \nteacher development framework11 has identified minimum ICT competencies for teachers. The \nGovernment  should  make  these  mandatory  for  teachers  and  ensure  that  they  attend  training \ncourses.  MESC  needs  assistance  in  addressing  these  issues,  as  they  are  critical  to  sector \nsustainability. This effort will need to build on plans supported by ESP II to consolidate MESC \ndatabases to support sharing and analysis. \n \n13. \nThe  country  is  divided  into  22  districts,  with  eight  on  the  island  of  Savai\u2019i  and  14  on \nUpolu, including three districts in the Apia urban area (districts outside this area are considered \nrural). Samoa has three types of schools\u2014government, mission, and private\u2014for a total of 204 \nprimary  and  secondary  schools.  Of  the  total,  government  and  mission  schools  account  for  42 \nsecondary and 154 primary schools, of which 19.5% (24 primary and 14 secondary) are in the \nApia urban area, 47.9% (79 primary and 15 secondary) are elsewhere on Upolu, and 32.6% (51 \nprimary and 13 secondary) are on Savai\u2019i. The total number of students in the government and \nmission schools is 52,851, of whom 37,980 are primary and 14,871 secondary. \n \nThere is at least one primary school in each village and one secondary school in each \n14. \ndistrict.  Electricity  and  telephone  services  are  available  in  all  districts  and  schools,  and  some \nschools  have  ICT  equipment  and  Internet  connections.  The  Government  should  therefore \nimprove access to high-quality secondary education by providing all secondary schools with e-\nlearning  equipment  and  materials  and,  where  possible,  Internet  connection  and  access  to  a \nbroad  range  of  curricula,  learning  materials,  and  other  quality-enhancing  resources  available \nthrough  SchoolNet  and  ICT.  This  will  be  particularly  important  for  remote  schools  serving \ndisadvantaged communities. The Government needs to ensure that including ICT in secondary \nschools will not impose an additional financial burden in the form of higher fees.  \n \n15. \nICT  Infrastructure.  While  Samoa\u2019s  two  islands  are  served  well  by  fixed  and  mobile \ntelephone  infrastructure,  Internet  access  is  limited  to  Apia  and  a  few  other  centers.  Dial-up \nInternet connections are common, though slow, unreliable, and expensive. Wireless and digital \nsubscriber  line  connections  are  available  around  the  Apia  area,  where  most  users  live. \nInternational  commercial  Internet  access  is  a  monopoly  of  the  state-owned  operator.  Retail \nprices  of  Internet  access  are  high  because  of  the  low  density  of  users  in  the  country  and  the \nprofit margins of the operators and do not differ much across existing Internet service providers. \nTelecommunications  regulations  permit  noncommercial  international  access,  and  the  National \nUniversity  of  Samoa,  diplomatic  offices,  and  some  church  groups  have  their  own  links.  While \ninternational  access  for  both  voice  and  data  is  mainly  by  satellite  (with  the  exception  of  a \nmicrowave link to American Samoa), it is envisaged that Samoa will connect to one of the two \navailable  Pacific  undersea  fiber  cables  in  the  near  future.  This  is  not,  however,  expected  to \nmake  a  significant  difference  to  retail  costs  unless  the  Government  negotiates  an  special  rate \nfor  education.  Wireless and  Worldwide  Interoperability  for Microwave  Access  technologies  are \nexpected to be deployed broadly in the country in the next few years. The SchoolNet pilot data \ncenter and portal are currently hosted by a local Internet service provider and may remain there \nuntil  the  server  room  in  the  new  MESC  headquarters  is  established,  at  which  time  the \nSchoolNet  portal  and  the  consolidated  database  may  be  relocated.  The  Government  should \n\n                                                 \n11  ADB.  2005.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Independent  State  of  Samoa  for  the  National  Teacher  Development \n\nFramework. Manila (TA 4738-SAM, approved on 16 December 2005, for $350,000).  \n\n\f   \n\n5\n\n \n\nconsider  developing  and  implementing  plans  and  policies  for  a  universal  services  fund  (or \nequivalent) 12  and  international  gateway,  to  ensure  that  surplus  capacity  and  budgetary \nresources  can  be  made  available  to  schools  to  (i)  provide  an  affordable  education  network, \n(ii) fund capital replacement costs, and (iii) ensure the long-term financial sustainability of ICT in \neducation.  \n \n16. \nLack  of  Community  Access  to  ICT.  Communication  and  access  to  information  are \nlimited  in  rural  communities,  contributing  to  isolation  and  missed  opportunities  and  hindering \naccess to knowledge and skills that could help people generate income, maintain and improve \ntheir surroundings, and lead healthier and more productive lives. Lack of ICT capacity prevents \npeople  from  accessing  national  and  global  information  and  limits  their  prospects  for  self-\nemployment  or  job  enhancement  at  home  and  abroad.  Weak  school  and  community \npartnerships undermine their potential to act as catalysts for national rural communications or as \nrural  service  delivery  points,  or  to  provide  a  basis  for  income  generation  to  support  the \nSchoolNet  initiative.  A  need  therefore  exists  to  make  the  learning  centers  accessible  to \ncommunities after school hours and, in so doing, support the Government objective of universal \naccess to ICT and allow communities to improve communication and knowledge sharing. \n \n17. \nLimited  Management  Capacity. Management capacity is limited in Samoa in general. \nRecent  interventions  considerably  strengthened  MESC\u2019s  capacity  to  manage  the  education \nsystem. For example, school management committees have been established; nearly all school \nprincipals  have  been  trained  in  school  management  and  planning  school  improvement \nprograms;  and  a  minimum  standard  baseline  checklist  has  been  developed.  However,  further \ncapacity building is required both for schools and ICT learning centers. Currently, MESC has a \nstaff  of  only  two:  one  information  technology  (IT)  systems  specialist  and  one  technician  to \nmanage  MESC  IT  services.  As  the  42  additional  schools,  as  well  as  CMAD  and  the  School \nOperations  Division  (SOD),  join  the  ICT  system,  capacity  will  be  seriously  strained.  One  staff \nmember will need to be located at the education resource center on Savai\u2019i to provide technical \nsupport  to  all  secondary  schools  on  that  island. 13 Another  staff  member  will  be  needed  to \nprovide  general  support  services  (a  help  line)  and  maintain  the  data  center.  The  Government \ntherefore should ensure that (i) sufficient resources including staff are provided to the MESC IT \nunit, (ii) SchoolNet management committees are formally established in local communities, and \n(iii)  MESC  staff  participate  in  capacity  building.  Strongly  supportive  school  management  is \ncritical for developing a school confident of its IT capabilities.  \n \n18. \nExternal  Support.  External  funding  concentrates  heavily  on  the  education  sector \n(Appendix  3).  AusAID,  European  Union,  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA), \nNZAID, United Nations agencies, and others have been involved in various education projects. \nTheir  funding  has  included  important  support  for  curriculum  development,  teacher  training, \ninstructional  materials,  and  capacity  building.  The  European  Union  and  JICA  have  provided \nsupport  for  primary  school  construction.  ADB,  along  with  the  Government  and  school \ncommittees, has allocated $7 million for civil works, furniture, equipment, library materials, and \n\n                                                 \n12 Many  countries  both  industrialized  (e.g.,  United  States  and  Canada)  and  developing  (e.g.,  Belarus  and  Namibia) \nhave  adopted  the  universal  services  fund  concept.  The  government  legislates  and  establishes  a  fund  financed \nthrough  telecommunications  companies.  Legislation  requires  the  fund  to  have  a  reserve  for  providing \ntelecommunications  services  to  lower-income  residents  and  underserved  villages.  The  regulator  in  Samoa  has \ndrafted legislation for a universal services fund that is currently tabled for the Cabinet\u2019s consideration. \n\n13 MESC currently uses a Peace Corps volunteer to do the work, but if no counterpart is assigned by MESC there will \nbe no capacity when that person leaves. If MESC intends to use Peace Corps volunteers in the short to medium \nterm,  there  should  be  an  agreement  with  the  Peace  Corps  to  ensure  that  these  IT-skilled  volunteers  will  be \navailable. That should be included in the MESC Strategic Plan for ICT. \n\n \n\n\f 6 \n\nteacher training under the recently completed ESP I. ESP II is providing limited IT equipment to \nMESC. Currently, the International Telecommunication Union and United Nations Development \nProgramme  are  supporting  the  Telecenters  Project,  through  which  computer  equipment  and \nlimited Internet connection are provided. JICA has provided technical assistance for designing \nand strengthening the National University of Samoa\u2019s ICT capacity.  \n \n19. \nLessons  Learned.  Lessons  from  earlier  interventions  in  Samoa  and  elsewhere  are \nsignificant  (Appendix  4). 14  The  key  one  is  that  well-targeted,  long-term,  and  coordinated \ninvestments  can  improve  the  quality  and  equity  of  education  provision,  including  ICT  in \neducation,  but  effective  implementation  of  these  initiatives  at  the  school  level  is  of  central \nimportance.  Hence,  a  well-supported,  integrated  approach  is  necessary  to  encourage  MESC \nstaff  to  engage  with  the  Project  and  to  fully  understand  it.  ESP  I  demonstrated  that  providing \nonly  computers  to  schools  has  little  impact  on  teachers\u2019  competencies  or  student  learning \noutcomes. A well-planned short- and medium-term staff development plan should be prepared \nalong with e-teaching and e-learning resources. The SchoolNet pilot and RETA-6278 indicated \nthat  capacity  development  should  include  school  administrators,  MESC  head  office  staff, \nteachers,  and  principals.  Schools  provide  a  focal  point  in  most  communities  and  are  the  best \nlocation for ICT interventions. Experience suggests that a need exists to provide more support \nfor community awareness and management capacity to empower schools and communities and \nencourage  their  ownership  of  learning  centers  and  their  use  of  them  without  concerns  for \nsustainability.  Experience  with  telecenters  in  education  indicates  the  need  to  adopt  open \npolicies to allow communities, government, and the private sector access to telecenters, and to \nshare the cost among them. Government policies have been found to be critical to sustainability. \nThere is a need to encourage multipurpose school and community access centers to be used by \ngovernment  departments  and  public  utilities  with  support  from  the  budgets  of  those \ndepartments.  In  some  countries,  school-based  ICT  centers  also  offer  community  services  and \ntraining.  \n \n20. \nof them are reflected in the project design, as follows:  \n\nGeneral lessons are also available in the ADB Evaluation Information System.15 Several \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nFlexibility in project design is essential to permit midcourse adjustments.  \nA sector strategy and action plan should be developed for any education sector \nproject to provide future directions for overall sector development. \n\n(iii)  When  formulating  policy  reforms,  a  comprehensive  review  and  analysis  of  the \nsector,  followed  by  continuing  policy  dialogue  over  an  extended  period,  are \nimportant. \nFor  vocational  training  graduates,  more  tracer  studies  of  graduates  must  be \nconducted for future planning.  \n\n(iv) \n\n                                                 \n14 ADB.  2000.

Samoa\u2019s first long-term education development plan, Education \n21. \nPolicies  1995\u20132005  and  Education  Strategies  1995\u20132005,  had  equity,  quality,  relevance,  and \nefficiency  as  central  objectives.  The  second  plan  (the  SPP)  has  an  additional  focus  on \nsustainability. For its part, the SDS considers education a contributing factor to both economic \ngrowth and social development. SDS identifies improving the learning outcomes of primary and \nsecondary students as a national priority.  \n \n22. \nThe  Government  recognizes  that  improving  quality  in  education  service  provision \nthrough  a  SWAp  is  essential  and  that  it  may  need  to  review  resource  allocations  to  different \neducation  subsectors  to  ensure  that  basic  education  is  funded  at  the  level  necessary  for \nachieving  Education  for  All  targets  and  Millennium  Development  Goals.  The  ICT  policy  of  the \nGovernment  is  to  ensure  access  to  ICT \nfor  all  Samoans.  Through  the  Ministry  of \nCommunications and Information Technology master plan, National ICT Secretariat, and MESC, \nthe  Government  has  introduced  national  ICT  policies16 with  a  focus  on  introducing  ICT  in  the \neducation sector.  \n \nThe  ICT  Communication  Act  establishes  a  monopoly  for  international  access  provision \n23. \nuntil  mid-2009.  Noncommercial  traffic  for  the  Internet,  including  voice-over-Internet  protocol,  is \nallowed.  The  National  ICT  Strategic  Plan,  which  was  recently  drafted  by  the  Ministry  of \nCommunications  and  Information  Technology  for  developing  the  ICT  industry,  includes  the \ndevelopment of e-government and e-commerce components. MESC also has an IT master plan \nthat  outlines  a  policy  framework  for  introducing  ICT  in  the  sector.  This  master  plan  is  due  for \nrevision, providing an opportune time to align MESC\u2019s strategic plan with an integrated vision for \nthe sector. \n \n24. \nADB  Strategy.  Government  policy  guidelines  are  in  congruence  with  ADB\u2019s  Pacific \nStrategy (2005\u20132009)17 and the ICT Blueprint for the Future18 for the Pacific. ADB\u2019s ICT strategy \nfocus  is  on  (i) developing  capacity  to  use  ICT  to  overcome  constraints  associated  with \nsmallness and isolation, and to realize potential gains offered by links to a global market, and \n(ii) developing  ICT  as  a  tool  in  education  and  health,  and  as  communication  infrastructure  for \nthe  improved  sharing  of  information  and  provisioning  of  basic  services  in  working  toward  the \nMillennium  Development  Goals.  ADB\u2019s  draft  Country  Partnership  Strategy  (2008\u20132012)  with \nSamoa  highlights  the  Government\u2019s  interest  in  expanding  the  SchoolNet  initiatives  to  the \nnational level to (i) improve the quality of education for all, especially for the disadvantaged; (ii) \nmeet the employment aspirations of the young; and (iii) contribute to an improved quality of life. \nFurthermore, ADB\u2019s Education and Training Sector Strategy for the Pacific (2005)19 emphasizes \nADB\u2019s  commitment  to  increasing  the  use  of  new  technologies,  particularly  ICT,  in  education. \nADB  will  continue  its  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  and  support  the  development  of  a \npolicy environment that prioritizes equitable opportunities to learn. It will also continue dialogue \non reforms in the education sector that will provide resources for the operation and expansion of \nin  education  and  encourage  public-private  partnerships  between  businesses  and \nICT \ncommunities to support social development.  \n\n                                                 \n16 See  Ministry  of  Communications  and  Information  Technology.  2006.

Moreover, ADB has \nplaced special emphasis on the dynamics of overseas employment and remittances, especially \nas  they  apply  to  Pacific  island  countries.  Given  the  importance  of  remittances  in  Samoa,  the \nProject  will  provide  an  excellent  opportunity  to  investigate  linkages  between  ICT  skills, \nemployment, and income.21  \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\n26. \nThe  proposed  Project  will  help  the  Government  to  achieve  a  more  equitable  and \neffective  ICT-enhanced  education  system  and  promote  life-long  learning.  The  outcome  of  the \nProject  will  be  enhanced  learning  outcomes  for  secondary  students  and  improved  knowledge \nsharing through ICT. \n\nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n27. \nThe  Project  will  focus  on  the  secondary  level,  adopt  an  integrated  ICT-in-education \napproach, and set up learning centers in all 42 government and mission secondary schools in \nall  22  districts.  The  Project  will  develop  the  capacity  of  about  800  teachers  and  provide  ICT \naccess  to  about  1,500  secondary  students  and  22  communities.  The  Project  will  have  four \ncomponents:  (i)  improving  the  quality  of  teaching  and  learning  in  secondary  schools;  (ii) \nimproving education access through ICT; (iii) establishing the CAP and developing partnerships; \nand (iv) strengthening education management and coordination, including improving analyses of \neconomic  efficiency,  equity,  and  sustainability.  Outputs  of  component  1  are  (i)  e-curriculum \ncapacity  development  and  distribution, \n(ii)  e-teaching  capacity  development,  and \n(iii) management  capacity  development.  Outputs  of  component  2  are  (i) the  provision  of  \nSchoolNet equipment and connectivity, (ii) the integration of the SchoolNet pilot with the Project, \n(iii) an extended network to connect MESC internally and with schools, (iv) a strengthened data \ncenter  and  portal,  and  (v) strengthened  MESC  ICT  capacity.  Outputs  of  component  3  are \n(i) community  access  and  use  of  SchoolNet, \n(ii) strengthened  SchoolNet  and  CAP \nmanagement,  and  (iii)   partnership  development.  Outputs  of  component  4  are  (i) strengthened \neducation  management  and  coordination  and  (ii) improved  analyses  of  economic  efficiency, \nequity, and sustainability. \n \n\n1. \n\nComponent 1: Improving the Quality of Teaching and Learning \n\n28. \nThis  component  will  develop  the  capacity  of  MESC,  teachers,  and  students  from  all \ngovernment and mission secondary schools in ICT competencies. The support provided for this \ncomponent  will  complement  and  expand  ESP II  activities  to  include  ICT  competencies  and \ndeveloping and using e-learning resources in classroom teaching and learning processes. The \nProject will (i) provide consulting services to train 15,000 students; 800 secondary teachers; 21 \nschool review officers; and CMAD, SOD, and IT unit staff, locally as well as with overseas field \nstudies  and  workshops;  (ii)  adapt  and/or  purchase  e-learning  materials  and  courseware  for  at \nleast  six  secondary  subjects  (with  priority  on  mathematics  and  science)  and  two  ICT \n\n                                                 \n20  Eminent Persons Group. 2007.

ADB also \n\nsupports a general project on enhancing the efficiency of overseas workers\u2019 remittances. \n\n\f   \n\n9\n\n \n\napplications for community learning; and (iii) develop a SchoolNet management handbook. This \ncomponent will be led by CMAD but closely supported by SOD and ICT Unit. \n \n29. \nE-curriculum  Capacity  Development  and  Distribution.  Complementing  ESP II \nactivities develop the capacity of CMAD staff, the Project will (i) expand capacity to adapt an e-\ncurriculum and to embed ICT as a learning and teaching tool in identified subjects and grades; \n(ii) upgrade CMAD\u2019s capacity to search for, identify, and evaluate suitable e-learning materials; \n(iii)  acquire  a  stock  of  appropriate  e-learning  and  teaching  materials  through  purchase, \nlicensing,  adaptation,  and  localization;  (iv)  source  and/or  adapt  local  e-materials;  (v)  make  e-\nlearning  materials  widely  available  through  SchoolNet;  and  (vi)  organize  and  distribute  e-\nlearning  materials  developed  and/or  sourced  as  required  by  CMAD.  In  addition,  teachers  and \nstudents will be trained in the use of productivity applications as part of teaching and learning. \nAssistance will be provided to CMAD to expand the inventory of e-learning materials, including \naccredited courseware available for ICT training.  \n \n30. \nE-teaching  Capacity  Development.  Under  this  subcomponent,  the  capacity  of  SOD \nand the National University of Samoa will be strengthened to jointly develop and deliver online \nprofessional  development  programs  for  teachers.  This  will  include  developing  the  ICT \ncompetencies  of  teachers  in  using  e-learning  materials  and  preparing  lesson  plans.  As  they \nbecome  available,  other  tools  will  be  integrated  in  their  teaching  practices.  The  new  national \nteacher development framework lists ICT competencies as mandatory for all teachers, so there \nshould be in 3 years a sufficient supply of pre-service teachers with ICT competencies to offset \nany attrition to the private sector.22  \n \n31.  Management  Capacity.  The  Project  will  build  the  management  capacity  of  teachers, \nprincipals,  school  review  officers,  and  learning  center  administrators  in  participating  schools \nusing a training-of-trainers model. This will include the management of the school administration \nsystem,  of  SchoolNet  administration,  and  of  the  learning  centers.  A  SchoolNet  management \nhandbook  will  be  developed.  CMAD  and  SOD  will  develop  monitoring  indicators  for  their \nactivities and implement a process to progressively evaluate the impact of their interventions. \n \n\nComponent 2: Improving Education Access through ICT \n\n2. \n \n32. \nThis  component  will  provide  learning  center  equipment  packages  to  42  secondary \nschools.  While  all  government  and  mission  secondary  schools  will  participate,  constraints  of \ncapacity and logistics require that this component be implemented in three phases over a 3-year \nperiod. Schools will be selected for each phase to assure that there is a representative mix of \ncharacteristics to support the evaluation of impacts23 by means of a quasi-experimental design. \nA  participating  school  receiving  the  learning  center  package  will  not  impose  fees  or  increase \nschool fees for the use of ICT without MESC approval. Supplementary Appendix B  provides a \nconceptual design for measuring learning outcomes. This component will be led by the MESC \nIT Unit and the MESC Assets Management Unit (AMU) and supported by SOD. \n  \n33. \nThe  learning  centers  and  MESC  will  be  connected  through  a  wide  area  network \n(WAN). 24  Initial  networking  will  be  provided  through  wireless  and  dial-up  technology.  An \n                                                 \n22 In the immediate term, the risk is low as the private sector is just beginning to embrace ICT as a productivity tool. \nIncentive  schemes\u2014such  as  subsidized  housing  currently  being  developed  for  retaining  rural  teachers\u2014should \nalso be considered for retaining good ICT teachers. \n\n23  The evaluation of impacts is included in Component 4, as part of improving the analysis of sector efficiency. \n24  The  connectivity  design  will  use  wireless  broadband  technology  and  a  WAN  for  domestic  networking,  which  is \ncosted  as  an  annual  fixed  fee  and  not  on  traffic  volume.  This  will  significantly  reduce  the  connectivity  cost  and \n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\ninternational  connection  will  be  established  by  an  Internet  link  through  a  provider  within  or \noutside  Samoa.  Licensing  will  be  obtained,  as  necessary,  on  a  noncommercial  basis.  The \nProject will provide equipment, software, and consulting services for the LAN, WAN, and data \ncenter and portal, as well as for training and consultative workshops to strengthen MESC ICT \ncapacity and training (intensive face-to-face, field study, and mentoring). \n \n34. \nProvision  of  SchoolNet  Equipment  and  Connectivity.  The  Project  will  provide  all \ngovernment  and  mission  secondary  schools  with  an  e-learning  center.  Each  center  will  be \nsupplied  with  computer  workstations;  servers;  peripherals  such  as  printer,  scanner,  video \ncamera,  data  projector,  and  networking  equipment;  related  software;  and  consulting  services. \nAn  indicative  learning  center  package  (which  may  change  during  detailed  project  design)  is \nprovided in Supplementary Appendix C. Where current IT infrastructure permits, the center will \nbe  connected  to  the  SchoolNet  network.  The  Project  will  help  the  Government  to  develop \npolicies and guidelines for disposing of obsolete equipment. Each school and its community will \nbe  responsible  for  operating  and  maintaining  its  center.  The  maintenance  of  equipment  and \nconnectivity will be part of contracts with the equipment suppliers.  \n \n35. \nIntegration of SchoolNet Pilot. The Project will review the performance of the LAN and \nWAN  provided  under  the  SchoolNet  Pilot  to  ensure  that  they  remain  fully  operational.  As \ntechnological  and  infrastructure  changes  occur  in  ICT,  appropriate  and  up-to-date  design  is \nneeded to integrate the SchoolNet pilot sites with the Project.  \n \n36. \nExtended  Network  to  Connect  MESC.  The  capacity  of  current  equipment  at  CMAD; \nSOD; the Policy, Planning, and Research Division (PPRD); and the IT Unit will be reviewed for \ncompatibility with the SchoolNet network. With ESP II implementation units, compatible network \nequipment will be procured and installed, and wireless broadband connection commissioned, to \nlink  to  CMAD,  SOD,  PPRD,  and  the  IT  Unit.  All  other  existing  equipment  and  MESC  intranet \nconnections will be standardized and connected to the SchoolNet network.  \n \n37. \nStrengthened Data Center and Portal. The equipment of the MESC data center will be \nassessed  for  its  capacity  to  provide  high-quality  and  fast  services,  and  it  will  be  replaced  if \nnecessary.  Access  and  authentication  will  be  provided  for  all  participating  schools  and  MESC \ndivisions.  This  will  ensure  that  all  schools  have  standardized  access  to  e-teaching  and  e-\nlearning materials.  \n \n38. \nStrengthened MESC ICT Capacity. Assistance will be provided to MESC to strengthen \nits ICT capacity to effectively manage and support the expanded SchoolNet network and its own \noperation.  Capacity  will  be  developed  through  on-the-job  and  specific  technical  training  in \nnetwork,  data  center,  and  portal  management.  Capacity  will  be  developed  to  manage  the \neducation  management  information  system  (EMIS)  of  MESC.  Additional  staff  will  be  recruited \nand  trained  to  manage  the  expanded  SchoolNet  network  and  focal  points  in  schools.  The \nGovernment will recruit or redeploy at least two staffers to the MESC IT Unit, who will be trained \nto manage the expanded network of schools and provide IT support services to all clients of the \nexpanded  network.  Furthermore,  MESC  will  appoint  two  teachers  in  each  school  that  it  can \nensure will be available for training as SchoolNet administrators. School administrators will act \nas focal points and be responsible for their learning center.  \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \nprovide  unlimited  use.  Internet  access  will  be  provided  through  a  single  gateway  from  the  WAN,  allowing  close \nmonitoring  to  manage  cost.  Also,  visited  websites  will  be  cached  at  the  data  center  and  not  require  subsequent \nvisits to the Internet.  \n\n\f   \n\n11\n\n \n\n3. \n\nComponent  3:  Establishing \nPartnership Development \n\nthe  Community  Access  Program  and \n\n \n39. \nThis  component  will  support  MESC  and  the  participating  schools  to  make  learning \ncenters  available  to  the  surrounding  communities.  It  will  develop  management  models  and \npartnership arrangements with existing school committees and private sector IT suppliers, which \nshould maximize project sustainability. The Project will provide consulting services and training; \ndevelop  and  distribute  advocacy  materials  and  a  learning  center  administrative  manual;  and \nconduct consultative workshops. This component will be led by SOD and closely supported by \nthe MESC IT Unit and AMU.    \n \n40. \nCommunity  Access  and  Use  of  SchoolNet.  School  managers  and/or  principals  will \nmake  the  SchoolNet  learning  centers  accessible  to  the  communities  surrounding  their  school \nafter  school  hours.  Support  will  include  assistance  in  developing  a  plan  and  an  administrative \nmanual for this, and in training community members in basic ICT skills. An advocacy program \nwill be developed and implemented to engage the community. This component is expected to \ncontribute  to  financial  sustainability,  as  small  fees  may  be  charged  to  recover  equipment \noperating and depreciation costs and for access and training.  \n \n41. \nSchoolNet  and  Community  Access  Program  Management.  The Project will provide \nsupport to school managers to (i) develop locally appropriate policies to manage ICT equipment, \n(ii) plan types of services to be provided, (iii) develop and adopt a cost-recovery or cost-sharing \napproach, and (iv) develop procedures for staff to handle the daily administration of community \naccess. While improving the capacity of the community to take advantage of ICT, the CAP will \nalso  help  improve  the  sustainability  of  the  Project  by  charging  user  fees  for  day-to-day \noperation.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  SchoolNet  management  committees  are  formally \nestablished as subcommittees of the larger school committees.25  \n \nPartnership  Development.  In support of sustainability, the Project will assist MESC in \n42. \ndeveloping and implementing a series of partnerships with other government agencies, donors, \nthe  private  sector,  and  other  stakeholders.  Key  partnerships  envisaged  include  those  with  (i) \nschool  communities;  (ii)  government  agencies;  (iii) the  donor  community;  (iv) religious  groups; \n(v) civil  society;  and  (vi) private  sector  ICT  companies,  both  local  and  international,  to  provide \nservices  at  a  subsidized  connection  rate  or  to  accelerate  and  adopt  the  universal  services \nfund.26  \n \n\n4. \n\nComponent  4:  Strengthening  Management  and  Coordination,  and \nImproving Analyses of Economic Efficiency, Equity, and Sustainability \n\n  \n43. \nThis  component  will  support  ESP II  activities  associated  with  enhancing  EMIS  and \nMESC capacity in ICT to increase management efficiency. It will undertake an impact study and \nprepare a medium-term expenditure framework and a financing framework for progress toward \nfinancial  sustainability.  The  Project  will  provide  consulting  services,  equipment  to  MESC \ndivisions and units, and training (including workshops). The component will be led by PPRD and \nsupported by the MESC IT Unit.  \n \n                                                 \n25  Under  the  SchoolNet  pilot,  subcommittees  of  the  larger  school  committees  were  established.  They  had  six \nmembers: three office-bearers who were from the school committees and three ordinary members. In some cases, \nthe ordinary committee members were chosen for their IT and business skills. \n\n26  See  Supplementary  Appendix  D  for  discussions  on  detailed  partnership  agreements.  These  agreements  are \n\nintended to address the efficient use of the learning centers and ensure sustainability.  \n\n \n\n\f 12 \n\nStrengthened  Education  Management  and  Coordination.  In  close  coordination  with \n44. \nESP II, the Project will provide support to ensure that (i)  MESC has robust EMIS and evaluation \nsystems and (ii) capacity will be created to improve the management processes, including ICT \nsystems, for (a) school management, including student and teacher attendance records, asset \nmanagement,  and  facilities  scheduling,  and  (b)  learning,  including  grading,  lesson  plans,  and \ncourseware  management.  Support  will  be  provided  for  producing  integrated  project  reports, \nreviews, and auditing. Data collection and analysis procedures will be developed further, using \nICT  tools  and  criteria.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  establish  processes  and  procedures  to \nintegrate SchoolNet with ESP II.  \n \n45. \nImproved  Analyses  of  Economic  Efficiency,  Equity,  and  Sustainability.  Quasi-\nexperiments will be undertaken to evaluate SchoolNet\u2019s impact on student learning outcomes. \nThrough this subcomponent, the Project will finance the development of baseline measures of \nequity  and  efficiency  and  the  preparation  of  medium-term  expenditure  and  financing \nframeworks,  as  well  as  projection  models  for  assessing  and  monitoring  progress  toward \nfinancial sustainability.  \n \nC. \n\nAsian Development Fund IX Grant Component \n\n46. \nThe Project is included in the Samoa Country Operations Business Plan 2007\u20132009, as \nrecently  approved  by  ADB,  with  an  allocation  of  $5.9 million  in  the  form  of  an  Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  (ADF)  grant.  Public  sector  debt  has  been  declining  since  the  early  1990s, \nfrom  over  100%  of  GDP  to  about  38%  of  GDP  in  late  2006.  Samoa  will  likely  graduate  soon \nfrom least-developed country status. However, the economy remains dependent on imports and \nvulnerable  to  climate  and  global  price  shocks.  Although  the  debt  situation  is  sound,  there  are \nconcerns  that  recent  improvements  in  the  debt-to-GDP  ratios  reflect  large  official  investment \nflows for infrastructure for the 2007 South Pacific Games. The proposed ADF grant will ease the \nmacroeconomic impact of the Project\u2019s large financing requirements. \n \nD. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n47. \nFlexible Design. Based on lessons learned from the SchoolNet pilot and other general \nlessons, the project design incorporates a flexible approach. The fundamental design has been \nagreed  with  the  Government.  This  includes  the  scope  of  the  Project  (all  secondary  schools), \nspecification  of  hardware  and  connectivity  standard  (SchoolNet  pilot),  management  and \nprocurement (ESP II congruent), monitoring and evaluation, and reporting and auditing. The first \nstage  (about  12  months)  will  provide  an  opportunity  for  fine  tuning  based  on  the  outcome  of \nissues  and  priorities  identified  in  the  baseline  study  and  an  analysis  of  the  efficiency  of  the \neducation system. This will be a key factor in risk mitigation. Also, as the technology changes \nconstantly, there will be a need to change and adopt the most suitable technology. While inputs, \noutputs, and outcomes can be predicted in other projects, ICT and SchoolNet projects need to \nconsider these rapid changes and adjust implementation accordingly.27 The proposal takes into \nconsideration  the  Project\u2019s  complexity  and  the  limited  capacity  in  MESC,  and  has  allocated \nadequate time and contingency for appropriate adjustments. \n \n\n                                                 \n27  This flexibility will allow the Project to respond to evolving opportunities such as (i) relocating the network operating \ncenter and the data center to MESC\u2019s new headquarters when it is ready and thereby reducing hosting costs paid \nto  an  Internet  service  provider,  (ii)  changing  the  Internet  service  provider  to  AusAID\u2019s  Pacific  Sky  Project  if  it  is \nready and cost effective, and (iii) joining the National University of Samoa if it expands its IT services to become \nthe national education network. Opportunities such as these will be monitored. \n\n\f   \n\n13\n\n \n\nConsolidation  with  ESP II.  To avoid a fragmentary and isolated approach, the project \n48. \ndesign  is  built  on  the  extensive  sector  review  undertaken  for  the  ESP II  development  and \nadministrative  framework  and  the  recent  SchoolNet  pilot  project  reports.  The  Project  will  be \nimplemented  using  the  same  ESP II  implementation  structure  and  in  coordination  with  the \nESP II  implementation  schedule  as  part  of  a  SWAp.  The  Project  will  therefore  complement \nESP II  activities  and  contribute  to  achieving  ESP  II  outcomes.  To  avoid  any  overloading  of \nMESC  capacity  in  implementing  ESP II,  the  Project  will  provide  consulting  support  to  enable \nMESC to carry out project activities. However, to ensure that there is a clear separation in the \nuse of project funds, a sound accounting system will be established.  \n \n49. \nParticipatory  Approach.  The  Project  adopts  a  participatory  approach  and  close \ncoordination  with  all  bilateral  and  multilateral  agencies  as  well  as  with  nongovernment \norganizations, civil society, public and private school teachers, and church groups. The potential \ncapacity  of  ICT  to  enhance  learning,  and  the  Government\u2019s  enthusiasm  for  expanding  ICT-\ndriven learning opportunities, have been well supported by outcomes of consultative workshops \nand surveys during implementation of the SchoolNet pilot. Consultations were held with schools \nand communities through site visits and workshops during the implementation of the SchoolNet \npilot.  In  general,  the  schools  and  communities  were  very  committed;  communities  considered \nthe education of their children a high priority and were keen to provide them with access to ICT \nopportunities.  \n \nE. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n50. \nThe  Project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $6.90 million  equivalent,  including  taxes, \nduties, and contingencies.

MOF will be the Executing Agency for the Project, and MESC the Implementing Agency. \nThe existing ESP II Education Steering Committee will be responsible for the Project and may \nco-opt  members  to  include  other  main  project  stakeholders  and  so  provide  strategic  direction \nand oversight. The Steering Committee will meet as necessary but not less than once every 6 \nmonths.  The  Technical  Advisory  Committee,  comprising  representatives  from  the  Ministry  of \nCommunications and Information Technology, Samoan Information Technology Society, MESC, \nNational University of Samoa, and local IT companies, will be established to advise the Steering \nCommittee  on  technical  matters.  A  SchoolNet  project  manager  with  appropriate  qualifications \nwill be selected from within MESC or appointed by MESC to (i) assist MESC division heads in \nannual planning to ensure SchoolNet activities are not jeopardized at the expense of ESP II or \nvice  versa;  (ii) assist  the  MESC  AMU  in  liaising  with  local  ICT  companies,  Internet  service \nproviders,  and  the  schools  and  communities,  as  well  as  with  procurement  activities;  (iii) assist \nthe  Secretariat  with  all  record  keeping,  report  developments,  and  follow  up  on  reporting \nrequirements; (iv) visit all project sites to test installation and to officially hand over to schools; \nand (v) assist the manager of AMU with the assets register.  \n \n53.  MESC  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  managing  project  implementation,  monitoring \nand evaluation, and reporting of progress. At the operational level, the Project will be managed \nby  the  MESC  Core  Executive,  comprising  the  chief  executive  officer  (CEO),  assistant  CEOs, \nand  AMU  manager,  and  supported  by  the  Office  of  the  CEO,  the  SchoolNet  project  manager, \nand the ESP II program coordinator. All components of the Project will be implemented through \nthe existing MESC organizational structure and in coordination with the ESP II implementation \nstructure.  Consulting  services,  including  a  project  management  adviser,  will  be  provided  to \nstrengthen the capacity of the Core Executive to deliver the Project. The ESP II Secretariat and \nSchoolNet  project  manager  will  coordinate  with  the  project  management  adviser.  Consulting \nservices, including a project management adviser, will be provided to strengthen the capacity of \nthe  Core  Executive  to  deliver  the  Project.  The  ESP II  coordinator  and  SchoolNet  project \nmanager  will  be  supported  by  the  project  management  adviser.  The  proposed  management \nstructure is attached as Appendix 6.   \n  \n\n\f   \n\n15\n\n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period and Process \n\n54. \nThe Project will be implemented in two stages over 5 years and completed by December \n2012.  In  Stage  1,  the  Government  will  prepare  the  medium-term  expenditure  framework \n(MTEF).  It  will  also  develop  monitoring  and  evaluation  indicators  and  collect  comprehensive \nbaseline data, including quantified measures of unit costs, equity, and efficiency, and measures \nof  secondary  student  competence  in  at  least  six  academic  subjects  (e.g.,  mathematics  and \nscience subjects) in line with ESP II, for ICT support. In addition, a system will be implemented \nto conduct tracer studies of secondary school graduates, to be conducted annually for the life of \nthe  Project.  The  Government  will  assign  schools  to  one  of  the  three  groups  for  phased \nimplementation, matching schools so that the three groups are  comparable.28 During this stage, \nwhich  will  last  about  1  year  from  project  effectiveness,  MESC  and  MOF  will  also  conduct  an \nupdated sustainability analysis to ensure that assumptions are sound and that the Government \nis committed to efficiency reforms and to maintaining support at levels that will bring long-term \nfinancial  sustainability.  In  particular,  the  analysis  will  review  the  recurrent  cost  implications  of \nEPS II and SchoolNet.  \n \n55. \nStage  2  will  be  contingent  upon  the  successful  completion  of  all  activities,  including  a \nsustainability  analysis.  Based  on  the  results,  the  scope  of  Stage  2  implementation  may  be \nadjusted  to  ensure  that  the  recurrent  cost  implications  of  the  Project  are  consistent  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s sustainability projections. All activities in Stage 1 will be successfully completed \nprior  to  implementation  of  Stage  2,  which  will  include  (i)  the  procurement,  installation,  and \ncommissioning  of  ICT  equipment  for  the  learning  centers  and  MESC  data  center;  (ii)  the \nprocurement, installation, and commissioning of Internet connection for the learning centers and \nMESC  data  center;  (iii)  training  for  CMAD  and  SOD  to  develop  and  acquire  electronic \ncourseware; (iv) training teachers and technical staff; (v) monitoring and fine tuning the learning \ncenters\u2019 technical, educational, and financial performance; and (vi) establishing and monitoring \ncommunity  access  to  the  learning  centers.  Stage  2  will  include  ongoing  monitoring  and \nevaluation of the impact of the Project, including annual assessment of its impact on at least six \nacademic subjects as included in Stage 1. Detailed annual work programs for 2009, 2010, 2011, \nand  2012  will  be  developed  in  conjunction  with  ESP II  based  on  progress  to  date  and  other \ndevelopments\u2014for  example,  connection  availability.  The  rollout  of  equipment  and  connectivity \nwill  be  done  in  3  phases  for  reasons  of  logistics  and  capacity.  An  implementation  schedule  is \ngiven in Appendix 7.   \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n56. \nAll  goods  and  services  financed  under  the  Project  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement (2007, as amended from time to time). Any contract costing \nmore  than  $1  million  will  be  awarded  following  ADB\u2019s  international  competitive  bidding \nprocedures. All other contracts under the Project will be awarded following national competitive \nbidding (NCB) and shopping (for packages under $100,000),29 in accordance with government \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. Before the start of NCB procurement, ADB and the Government \n\n                                                 \n28  Constructing  comparable  groups  will  involve,  among  other  things,  getting  approximately  equal  representation  of \nrural  and urban, Upolu  and  Savai\u2019i, and advantaged  and  disadvantaged schools, as reflected in access to public \nresources in the equity analysis. Schools will also be matched on student baseline characteristics such as gender, \nscores on the grade 8 exam, performance on new baseline assessment instruments, and experience of graduates \nin  the  Stage  1  tracer  study.  The  four  secondary  schools  that  participated  in  the  SchoolNet  pilot  will  be  excluded \nfrom evaluation. \n\n29  There  are  enough  capable  suppliers  in  Samoa  to  provide  full  competition,  as  was  demonstrated  during  the \n\nSchoolNet pilot phase. \n\n \n\n\f 16 \n\nwill  review  the  Government\u2019s  procurement  procedures  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB \nrequirements. Any necessary modification or clarifications to the Government\u2019s procedures will \nbe  documented  in  a  revised  procurement  plan.  The  World  Bank  assessed  Samoa\u2019s \nprocurement procedures and legislation in 2003.30 NCB procedures are justified by the need for \nlocal after-sale support and to build local IT capacity in general. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  will  be  included  in  all  documents  and \ncontracts.  The  procurement  packages  are  indicated  in  the  procurement  plan  attached  as \nAppendix 8.  \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n57. \nThe Project will provide about 72 person-months of international and 108 person-months \nof  national  consulting  services.  All  international  and  associated  national  consultants  will  be \nselected and recruited by MOF in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Most  international  consulting  services  will  be  provided \nthrough  one  firm.  The  main  areas  of  expertise  will  be  e-education,  ICT  in  education, \ncommunication  engineering,  education  and  management,  social  development,  education \nevaluation and assessment, educational economics, and project management. The Project will \nuse the quality-based selection method for recruiting the firm. Consultants will be requested to \nsubmit a full technical proposal. There is provision for individual consultants to be recruited for \nthe project management adviser position and for unallocated person-months as needed during \nthe  life  of  the  Project.  The  project  management  adviser  will  report  directly  to  the  ESP II \nSecretariat  through  the  ESP II  coordinator.  Given  the  highly  complex  technical  requirements \nand extensive capacity-building nature of the Project, much international expertise is needed in \nkey areas. Sufficient qualified expertise required for national consulting services is available in \nSamoa, as demonstrated by the SchoolNet pilot and ESP II. The outline terms of reference are \nin Appendix 9, with detailed terms of reference in Supplementary Appendix F.   \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Contracting \n\n58. \nThe Government requested ADB to approve advance contracting for consulting services. \nMESC  may  proceed  with  the  selection,  but  not  contracting,  of  consultants  before  the  grant  is \ndeclared effective. The advance action will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants.  ADB  advised  the  Government  that  approval  of  the  advance \ncontracting does not commit ADB to financing the ensuing Project. \n \n\n6. \n\nGovernance and Anticorruption Measures \n\n59. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Government. \nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive,  and  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant regulations and the bidding \ndocuments  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the \nProject shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and \naccounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service \nproviders as they relate to the Project. \n\n                                                 \n30  The  World  Bank  report,  Operational  Procurement  Review,  concluded  that  in  general  Samoa's  procurement \nprocedures  were  aligned  with  World  Bank  procurement  guidelines  and  that  the  procurement  risk  could  be \nconsidered average. \n\n\f   \n\n17\n\n \n\nADB and World Bank assessments of the Government\u2019s financial management systems \n60. \nand procedures undertaken in 2004 and 2005 concluded that they met ADB requirements. The \nsystems and procedures proposed for the Project were reviewed earlier in 2007, and these also \nmeet ADB requirements.31 A summary is presented in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n61. \nA sector governance and anticorruption assessment was conducted in parallel with the \nProject\u2019s  preparation,  during  which  risks  and  associated  mitigating  actions  were  identified  and \ndiscussed with the Government as indicated in Appendix 10. The assessment focuses on three \nthematic  areas:  financial  management,  procurement,  and  anticorruption.  As  a consequence of \nthe performance improvements that Samoa has achieved, many of the risks commonly faced in \nthe education sector in developing countries had little or no applicability. Samoa has embraced \nthe Anti-Corruption Initiative for Asia and the Pacific of ADB and the Organisation for Economic \nCo-operation and Development, and it has subjected its procurement and financial management \nsystems  to  rigorous  assessments  that  have  helped  the  Government  achieve  internationally \nacceptable  standards.  In  short,  it  was  found  that  the  overall  likelihood  of  risks  in  each  of  the \ntargeted thematic areas was medium to low, and actions are being taken by the Government to \nmitigate these risks.  \n \n62. \nStill, to deter corruption and increase transparency further, the Project will establish (i) a \nproject website to disclose information about project implementation and (ii) a grievance redress \nmechanism  to  ensure  greater  accountability.  The  former  will  provide  updated  and  detailed \ninformation  on  project  implementation.  The  latter  will  be  set  up  to  receive  and  resolve \ncomplaints  and  to  act  upon  stakeholders\u2019  reports  of  irregularities  on  project-related  matters. \nMOF will widely publicize the existence of this mechanism. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n63. \nThe grant proceeds for the proposed Project will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's \nLoan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  facilitate  project \nimplementation and fund flow, an imprest account will be set up in a bank acceptable to ADB. \nThe  imprest  account  will  be  managed  by  MOF.  The  initial  advance  to  be  deposited  in  the \naccount will not exceed either 6 months of estimated expenditures to be financed from it or 10% \nof  the  grant,  whichever  is  lower.  For  the  large  contracts  under  the  Project,  direct  payment \nprocedures  will  apply.  If  the  Government  initially  funds  eligible  expenditures  from  its  own \nresources,  reimbursement  procedures  will  be  used.  To  expedite  fund  flow  and  simplify \ndocumentation processing, the statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure will be used for the \nliquidation  and  replenishment  of  the  imprest  account  and  the  reimbursement  of  eligible \nexpenditures  not  exceeding  $50,000  per  individual  payment.  Payments  in  excess  of  the  SOE \nceiling will be reimbursed, liquidated, or replenished upon full documentation.  \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n64.  MESC will maintain separate records and accounts for all expenditures to be financed by \nthe Project in accordance with sound accounting principles. They will specify the expenditures \nfor  all  activities  and  identify  all  expenditures  to  be  financed  by  the  Project.  Project  accounts, \nincluding financial statements, SOEs, and imprest account records, will be audited at the same \ntime  as  those  of  ESP  II,  and  by  the  same  auditor,  who  will  be  acceptable  to  ADB  and  ESP II \n\n                                                 \n31  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f 18 \n\ncofinanciers AusAID and NZAID.32 The auditor\u2019s report, and copies of the certified accounts and \nrelated  financial  statements,  including  compliance  with  project  covenants  and  the  use  of  the \nimprest accounts, will be submitted to ADB in English not later than 6 months after the end of \nthe  fiscal  year  to  which  they  relate.  A  separate  auditor's  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest \naccount and SOE procedure will be included in the audit report.  \n \n65. \nThe  MESC  Secretariat,  in  collaboration  with  and  assisted  by  the  SchoolNet  project \nmanager, will be responsible for producing regular SOE and quarterly project progress reports \non all implementation activities in conjunction with ESP II SOE and Project Performance Report. \nCopies  of  the  reports  will  be  forwarded  by  MOF  to  ADB  and  will  be  shared  with  AusAID  and \nNZAID.  Within  3  months  after  physical  completion  of  the  Project,  MESC  will  submit  to  ADB  a \nproject completion report in conjunction with the ESP II completion report, which will be shared \nwith  AusAID  and  NZAID.  ADB's  policy  on  the  submission  of  audited  accounts,  which  covers \nfailure to submit audited accounts and financial statements by due dates, has been explained to \nthe Government. If submission of a financial statement is delayed by more than 6 months, ADB \nmay  not  approve  new  contract  awards.  If  the  delay  is  by  more  than  12  months,  grant \ndisbursements may be suspended or the grant may be canceled. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n A set of indicators for monitoring and evaluating impact, outcomes, and outputs will be \n66. \ndeveloped by MESC PPRD in coordination with CMAD and SOD during Stage 1 of the Project. \nMESC  will  implement,  monitor,  and  evaluate  the  activities  and  outputs  of  the  project  regularly \nand the outcomes of the Project after completion, in accordance with the schedule and terms of \nreference to be agreed upon by the Government. Performance evaluations will use qualitative \nand  quantitative  measures  to  examine  and  analyze  the  impact  of  project  ICT  interventions  on \nlearning  outcomes,  as  can  be  measured  by  standardized  ICT  assessment  where  available \n(Supplementary Appendix H).  \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n67. \nThe  Government  and  ADB,  in  collaboration  with  AusAID  and  NZAID,  will  conduct  two \nreview  missions  during  each  calendar  year  for  the  Project,  with  ESP II.  To  take  advantage  of \nquarterly reporting, they will be fielded shortly after the second and fourth quarters. Each review \nwill include an examination of budgetary allocations, operation and maintenance costs, staffing \nand other incremental recurrent costs, implementation arrangements, and achievements under \nthe Project. The review includes assessing progress in each component, identifying difficulties \nand constraints, and determining ways to overcome them. MESC management, specifically the \nassistant  CEOs,  will  be  a  primary  source  of  information  for  these  reviews.  In  addition,  the \nGovernment and ADB will jointly conduct a midterm review of the Project with ESP II. This will \n(i) review the scope, design, and project implementation arrangements; (ii) assess performance \nagainst  targets  and  benchmarks;  (iii) review  lessons  and  experiences  with  implementation  of \neach  component;  (iv) review  compliance  with  the  grant  agreement;  and  (v) recommend  any \nchanges required in project implementation. \n \n\n                                                 \n32  The Project should be carefully implemented to strengthen the harmonization process and avoid overburdening the \nGovernment  with  various  reporting  requirements.  Therefore,  procurement,  disbursement,  and  reporting  for  this \nProject are aligned  with the ESP II Consolidated Funding Arrangement signed by ADB, AusAID, NZAID, and the \nGovernment. ADB will assess Government procurement for further aligning with the Government\u2019s system.  \n\n\f   \n\n19\n\n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits \n\nCMAD,  SOD  (21  school  review  officers),  and  the  IT  Unit  will  benefit  from  capacity \n68. \nbuilding and be able to develop and use e-training materials and to embed ICT in education as \na  learning  and  teaching  tool.  The  Project  will  benefit  about  15,000  secondary  school  students \nand  800  teachers.  It  will  also  benefit  secondary  school  teachers  through  the  use  of  basic \nproductivity  applications  (word  processing,  spreadsheets,  databases,  graphics,  presentation, \netc.)  and  of  e-learning  materials.  The  ability  of  all  secondary  teachers  with  ICT  competencies \nand  skills  to  transfer  them  to  and  inspire  students  will  likely  benefit  future  generations  of \nstudents. \n \n69. \nAll 42 government and mission schools will have learning centers, and the surrounding \ncommunities will have access to them after school hours. Access to learning through ICT may \nwell provide the learning environment and systems necessary to encourage children to remain \nin school and stimulate rural students to acquire skills required by the curriculum and so enjoy \nmore opportunities for further education and training and become better able to perform in the \nformal labor market and/or informal income generation.  \n \nImpact  on  Poverty  and  Gender.  Improved  access  to  better  education  and  training \n70. \nthrough  ICT  will  increase  both  the  education  and  ICT  skills  of  secondary  school  students.  By \ntargeting  all  secondary  schools,  gains  should  flow  into  the  economy  of  every  district.  Male \nparticipation and completion rates in secondary schools, a current problem, will likely improve. \nThe  community  access  aspect  of  the  project  will  provide  opportunities  for  rural  communities, \nincluding  females,  to  learn  and  share  experiences  in  overcoming  poverty  and  improving  the \nquality  of  life.  The  Project  is  likely  to  enhance  the  employment  prospects  and  earnings  of \nSamoans  who  emigrate  and,  as  a  consequence,  increase  remittances\u2014thereby  furthering \npoverty reduction. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 11. \n \n71. \nThe  Project  will  benefit  Samoa,  regional  neighbors,  and  development  partners  by \nproviding  the  first  comprehensive  experience  of  the  impact  of  nationwide  ICT  access  on \nsecondary  student  achievement  and  community  development.  In  addition,  the  Project  will \nprovide  Internet  access  in  all  of  Samoa\u2019s  22  districts,  thereby  lowering  the  costs  of  extending \nservices to primary schools and other institutions in the future. \n \nEconomic Benefits and Financial Sustainability. In Samoa, participation in secondary \n72. \neducation  is  a  prerequisite  for  entry  into  the  formal  labor  market.  In  2000,  a  study  found  that \n93% of the private sector workforce had a secondary education. Given the size of remittances \nby  Samoans  working  abroad,  educational  qualifications  with  computer  skills  will  assist  with \nsuccessful  emigration  and  employment.  ICT  education  will  help  geographically  and  financially \ndisadvantaged groups. Analysis of data developed in the quasi-experimental design will provide \na basis for assessing the impact of ICT-enhanced learning relative to its costs. Further analysis \nof returns to education may be possible through secondary analysis of household income and \nexpenditure  data  to  estimate  the  rate  of  return  to  schooling  (i.e.,  the  Mincerian  earnings \nfunction) and to assess the impact of remittances on educational attainment. \n \n73. \nAppendix  12  presents  a  preliminary  analysis  of  financial  sustainability  using  the  total-\ncost-of-ownership approach. The analysis concludes that incremental expenditure requirements \nfrom 2013 will be about $550,000 per annum. These estimates assume that (i) user charges will \nbe  collected  from  after-hour  usage  of  learning  centers,  (ii)  a  universal  services  fund  will  be \n\n \n\n\f 20 \n\nestablished,  and  (iii)  there  will  be  SchoolNet-related  efficiency  gains.  The  analysis  does  not \nmake  a  conclusion  as  to  the  funding  for  these  incremental  expenditures.  In  that  connection, \nComponent 4 includes support for the preparation of a sectoral MTEF. The MTEF exercise will, \namong  other  things,  quantify  potential  ESP  II  efficiency  gains  and  revisit  the  SchoolNet \nsustainability  estimates  presented  in  Appendix  12.  Preparation  of  the  MTEF  will  involve  the \nidentification,  prioritization,  and  agreement  of  sectoral  priorities  and  associated  expenditures. \nThe  satisfactory  completion  of  a  robust  and  agreed  MTEF  will  be  a  prerequisite  for  moving  to \nStage 2 of the project.  See Supplementary Appendix I for a detailed sustainability analysis. \n \nB. \n\nRisks \n\n74. \nEnvironment  and  Social  Safeguards.  ICT  equipment  will  be  installed  in  existing \nsecondary  schools,  and  no  additional  construction  will  be  required  by  the  Project.  The  Project \nwill  not  finance  any  construction  for  communication  towers.  As  such,  the  Project  will  not  have \nany  resettlement  issues.  In  the  event  of  unforeseen  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  the \nGovernment  will  inform  ADB  and  prepare  resettlement  plans  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Policy \non Involuntary Resettlement (1995). The awarding of civil works contracts will be subject to ADB \nreview of resettlement plan(s). The disposal of obsolete equipment and disposables will follow \nGovernment  policies  and  guidelines  as  applicable.  The  Project  will  help  the  Government \ndevelop these policies further, as needed.  \n \n75. \nUncertain  Financial  Sustainability.  New  initiatives  such  as  ESP  II,  SchoolNet,  and \nother  projects  have  downstream  expenditure  implications.  These  incremental  recurrent \nexpenditures  must  be  considered  in  the  broader  context  of  medium-term  sectoral  expenditure \npriorities. A two-stage project design will mitigate the risk that the Project may not be financially \nsustainable.  The  Project  will  support  the  Government  to  prioritize  education  expenditures, \nincluding  SchoolNet-related  expenditures,  in  an  MTEF  context.  The  Project  will  not  move  to \nStage 2 until a satisfactory sectoral sustainability analysis is prepared during Stage 1. \n \n76. \nAn important caveat is that, to date, MESC has made only limited progress in collecting \nand analyzing unit cost data and information on efficiency or in constructing baseline indicators \nof equity and efficiency. Nor has MESC continued work on a sustainability projection model with \nMOF. The key to sustainability for the Project, ESP II, and the sector will lie in MESC and MOF \ntaking  ownership  of  efficiency  and  sustainability  issues.  The  Project  can  provide  resources  to \nMESC to move this work forward.  \n \n77. \nLack of Managerial Capacity to Support Schools and Teachers. This may be a risk, \nbut  the  pilot  schools  are  all  still  operating  well  under  the  leadership  of  school  principals.  The \nProject has included significant training and technical assistance to build management capacity \nin MESC staff at all levels. The project design has adopted a long-term mentoring approach to \nensure this capacity is sufficiently developed by the end of the Project. \n \n78. \nLack  of  Interest  from  the  Community. Community reluctance is twofold. First, limited \nunderstanding of ICT systems can cause anxiety because of fear of ready access to unsuitable \nwebsites,  of  breaking  the  equipment,  or  of  not  have  the  necessary  skills  to  use  the  learning \ncenters.  These  fears  can  be  addressed  through  well-focused  advocacy  and  training  activities. \nSecond,  the  uncertainty  of  recurrent  costs  and  the  lack  of  technical  capacity  to  maintain  the \nsystem  inhibit  community  interest.  These  can  be  mitigated  by  providing  sufficient  training  to \nmonitor  and  manage  costs,  securing  government  and  private  sector  support  to  develop \nbusiness opportunities to recover costs, and securing a long-term maintenance agreement with \nsuppliers  and/or  nongovernment  organizations  such  as  the  Samoan  Information  Technology \nSociety.  \n\n\f   \n\n21\n\n \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government,  MOF,  and  MESC  have  given \n\n79. \nthe following specific assurances, which will be incorporated into the legal documents. \n\n(i) \n\nThe  Government  will  provide  counterpart  funds  for  project  implementation  on \ntime.  MOF  will  make  timely  submission  of  annual  budgetary  appropriation \nrequests  to  Cabinet  and  MOF  will  ensure  prompt  disbursement  of  appropriated \nfunds during each year of project implementation to MESC. \n\n(ii)  Within  9  months  of  the  effective  date,  MESC  will  create  a  project  website  to \ndisclose information about various matters on the Project, including procurement. \nWith  regard  to  procurement,  the  website  will  include  information  on  the  list  of \nparticipating  bidders,  name  of  the  winning  bidder,  basic  details  on  bidding \nprocedures adopted, amount of contract awarded, and the list of goods/services \nprocured. \n\n(v) \n\n(iv) \n\nto  resolve  complaints/grievances  or  act  upon  reports \n\n(iii)  Within  9  months  of  the  effective  date,  MESC  will  establish  a  grievance  redress \nmechanism \nfrom \nstakeholders  on  misuse  of  funds  and  other  irregularities.  A  task  force  will  (a) \nreview and address grievances of stakeholders of the Project, in relation to either \nthe Project, any of the service providers, or any person responsible for carrying \nout  any  aspect  of  the  Project;  and  (b)  set  the  threshold  criteria  and  procedures \nfor  handling  such  grievances,  for  proactively  and  constructively  responding  to \nthem, and for providing the stakeholders with notice of such a mechanism. \nAlthough  no  significant  environmental  impacts  were  identified,  the  operation  of \nschool  facilities  and  the  disposal  of  obsolete  equipment  undertaken  under  the \nProject  will  be  implemented  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  environmental  laws \nand regulations and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002).  \nThe Government and MESC will ensure that construction of new school facilities, \nincluding  construction  of  communication  towers,  will  be  carried  out  at  existing \nschools  or  MECS  land.  In  the  event  no  sufficient  existing  land  is  available  and \nnew  land  acquisition  might  be  needed,  the  Government  will  inform  ADB  and \nprepare  resettlement  plans  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement (1995). The Government will ensure that (a) resettlement plans will \nbe prepared in consultation with affected people and disclosed to affected people \nprior to forwarding to ADB for approval, and (b) ADB review and approval of the \nresettlement plans will be a condition for award of civil work contracts. \nThe Project will be implemented in two stages. The Government and MESC will \nensure  all  activities  prescribed  under  Stage  1,  including  the  requirement  for  an \nagreed financial sustainability analysis for the Project as part of the MTEF, will be \nsuccessfully completed before implementation of Stage 2.  \nThe  Government  and  MESC  will  ensure  that  each  of  the  participating  schools \nthat  will  receive  the  learning  center  package  will  not  increase  its  school  fees  or \nimpose  additional  fees  for  the  use  of  ICT.

Samoa  is  an  independent  Pacific  island  country  with  a  small  but  open \neconomy.  While  the  economy  continues  to  rely  heavily  on  external  assistance  in  the  form  of \ngrants  and  soft  loans,  the  cost  of  servicing  external  debt  has  been  declining  steadily, \ndecreasing by 11% between fiscal year (FY) 2004 and FY2005. Lack of opportunity and income \nvulnerability, often exacerbated by  external economic shocks and natural disasters, contribute \nto hardship in rural areas, particularly on the island of Savai\u2019i. Despite vulnerability to external \nshocks, Samoa has experienced stability and sustained economic growth over the past decade. \nThe gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 4%, on average, annually between 1993 and \n2007. Poverty is not regarded as a problem; private remittances from the 35% of the population \nliving abroad are substantial (17% of gross national income). External aid represented 11.5% of \ngross  national  income  in  2005.  The  1999  Pacific  Human  Development  Report  ranked  Samoa \n7th among  15 developing island economies in the region, while it was ranked 75th globally in \nthe latest 2006 Human Development Report.1 The Strategy for the Development of Samoa for \n2005\u20132007 was completed in January 2005 and includes a commitment to restrain the annual \noverall  budget  deficit  to  no  more  than  3.5%  of  GDP  and  to  hold  annual  inflation  rates  to  less \nthan 3.0%. \n \n2. \nEducation is a priority area of the Government. The second long-term Strategic Policies \nand  Plan  July  2006\u2013June  2015  of  the  Ministry  of  Education,  Sports,  and  Culture\u2019s  (MESC) \nstresses  equity,  quality,  relevance,  efficiency,  and  sustainability  as  central  objectives.  The \nsector has shown significant achievements including an adult literacy rate of 98.7%, the highest \nin  the  region.  Despite  many  positive  achievements,  the  quality  and  efficiency  of  education \nremain  disappointing.  Variations  in  student\u2019s  learning  achievement  and  opportunities  to  learn \nremain significant, particularly between urban and rural areas. More than 25% of the students \nenrolling  in  primary  education  do  not  complete  the  8-year  program.  In  2006,  the  dropout  rate \nwas 7% for grades 1\u20132, 5% for grade 8, 18% for grades 10\u201311, 3% for grade 12, and as high \nas  41%  for  grade  13.  Repetition  rates  at  grades  1,  8,  11,  12,  and  13  are  high  and  largely  \nunchanged  since  1997.  In  2006,  88%  of  primary  students  progressed  to  the  lower  secondary \nlevel and 91% progressed to the upper secondary level, but only 53% of 12th graders advance \nto grade 13. \n \n3. \nThe education system in Samoa consists of 8 years of compulsory primary education, 5 \nyears of secondary education, and 4 years of higher education. National examinations are held \nat three levels in primary (years 4, 6, and 8) and year 12 in secondary. For year 13, a regional \nexamination  determines  access  to  the  first  year  of  university.  MESC  is  responsible  for  policy \nformulation,  guidance,  and  supervision  of  all  government  schools  and  institutions.  The  chief \nexecutive  officer,  with  assistance  from  heads  of  the  eight  divisions  and  the  Information \nTechnology (IT) Unit, manages the daily operation of MESC. Significant efforts have been made \nto strengthen institutional and management capacity. Despite major undertakings, weaknesses \nremain,  hampering  efforts  to  improve  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  education  service \ndelivery.  Village  committees  run  most  primary  and  secondary  schools  and  are  responsible  for \nsetting,  collecting,  and  spending  school  fees;  constructing  and  maintaining  buildings;  and \nproviding  consumables.  The  Government  funds  teachers\u2019  salaries,  some  consumables,  and \ninitial sets of textbooks every 5 years for primary schools.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1   United  Nation  Development  Programme  (UNDP).  1999.

However, not all \n4. \nsecondary  schools  are  able  to  offer  the  full  year  13  curriculum  for  lack  of  teachers  and  other \nresources (e.g., tools for applied subjects). In 2006, about 40% of year 12 students did not enter \nyear 13. In 2006, There are 44 secondary schools in Samoa, with a total enrollment of 15,165, \nand  enrollment  in  the  42  government  and  mission  schools  was  14,  871.  In  2005,  the  gross \nenrollment  rate  at  the  secondary  level  was  80%.2 In  2006,  the  overall  participation  rate  for \nsecondary students (age 15\u201319) was only 45%. Student distribution in the country shows that \n46% of secondary students are in the Apia urban area, 29% on the rest of Upolu, and 25% in \nSavai\u2019i. There are 799 teachers in government and mission secondary schools. The Apia urban \narea  has  45%  of  secondary  teachers,  the  rest  of  Upolu  has  28.5%  secondary  teachers,  and \nSavai\u2019i has 26.5% of secondary teachers. There is at least one government secondary school in \neach  of  Samoa\u2019s  22  districts.  Males  are  underrepresented  at  the  secondary  level,  constituting \nless  than  40%  of  year  13  enrollments.  Secondary  students  receive  the  Samoa  School \nCertificate  after  completing  the  national  examination  for  year  12.  A  regional  examination,  the \nPacific  Senior  Secondary  Certificate  administered  by  the  South  Pacific  Board  of  Educational \nAssessment  is  taken  upon  completion  of  year  13  and  is  required  for  enrollment  in  tertiary \neducation.  \n \n5. \nThe  status  of  the  school  curriculum  in  Samoa  is  problematic;  revisions  made  through \npiecemeal  interventions  by  donor  agencies  have  resulted  in  poor  articulation  between  grade \nlevels and across subjects. Also absent are clear guidelines of expected learning outcomes that \nset  out  the  literacy,  numeracy,  and  problem-solving  skills, as  well  as social  and cultural  skills, \nthat  children  should  master  as  they  progress  through  school  system.  Improvements  required \ninclude (i) an updated comprehensive (K\u201312) curriculum policy framework; (ii) subject and year-\nlevel syllabi statements; (iii) classroom activities that emphasize more active, student-centered \nlearning  activities;  and  (iv)  strengthened  pedagogical  and  discipline  knowledge  teaching  skills \nand the range of classroom assessment techniques that are essential for high-quality teaching \nand learning. These issues have implications for quality and efficiency at both the primary and \nsecondary level. The Government intends to develop an integrated curriculum for primary years \n1\u20133  and  subject-specific  curricula  in  seven  subject  areas  for  years  4\u20138,  providing  easy \narticulation  with  the  secondary  curriculum.  A  secondary  education  curriculum  framework  for \nyears 9\u201313 is being translated into subject syllabi and implemented. There is a need to provide \nteachers\u2019  manuals,  textbooks,  and  learning  materials,    and  to  design  and  deliver  in-service \ntraining programs, for the secondary level. More effective instructional practice will also have to \ninclude  more  effective  use  of  formative  and  summative  assessments.  Modern  assessment \nstrategies  have  been  introduced  in  recent  curriculum  projects  supported  by  development \npartners. These are, however, not yet widely applied.  \n \n6. \nAccess  and  Equity.  Generally,  children  throughout  Samoa  have  good  access  to \nprimary  education  and  limited  access  to  secondary.  Over  25%  of  primary  entrants  fail  to \ncomplete grade 8; of those who do complete, 90% have access to secondary. Therefore, about \none in three primary entrants does not have access to secondary education. There is an urgent \nneed to support the development of realistic equity indicators and the collection of baseline data \nthat will guide policy reforms to increase equitable access to secondary education. Every village \nhas a primary school; clusters of villages make up districts, and each district has a secondary \nschool, with the bigger districts having more than one. The country is divided into 22 districts, \nwith  8  on  Savai\u2019i  and  14  on  Upolu,  including  three  districts  in  the  Apia  urban  area.  Districts \noutside of the Apia urban area are considered rural. Recent community consultations identified \n\n                                                 \n2  World  Bank,  EdStat,  www1.worldbank.org/education/edstats.  MESC  Statistical  Digest  for  2006  does  not  provide \n\ngross and net enrollment rates for either primary or secondary schools. \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nthe  condition  of  school  facilities  as  an  important  source  of  dissatisfaction.  Although  many \nprimary  schools  and  some  secondary  schools  have  been  upgraded  in  recent  years,  several \nschools in the poorer areas still operate in facilities that do not meet national standards, often \nwithout  proper  classrooms  and  necessary  equipment.  Substandard  schools,  particularly  in  the \nrural areas, convey an image of poor-quality service, create an apathetic teaching and learning \nenvironment, can inhibit student learning, and result in a high dropout rate. A World Bank study \nsuggests  that  the  likelihood  of  children  from  the  lowest  quintile  of  households  reaching \nsecondary education and finding a job is low. Poor parents have difficulty paying school fees, \nespecially at the secondary level. Thus, children of poor families perform less well in school and \noften  dropout  early.  The  provision  of  ICT  equipment  will  have  beneficial  impact  on  equity  by \nequalizing  access  to  in-service  teacher  training  and  access  to  learning  resources  in  remote \nsecondary  schools.  However,  ensuring  systemwide  efficiency  will  require  the  development  of \nsystemwide  equity  measures,  including  benefit  incidence  analysis,  which  will  lead  to  more \nequitable resource allocation geared to inclusive growth and poverty alleviation. Such analysis \nis incorporated in the Project design.  \n \nQuality  and  Efficiency.  The  quality  of  education,  as  measured  by  test  results  and \n7. \nfunctional  literacy,  is  disappointing.  The  Samoa  primary  education  literacy  level  one  (year  4) \nand  two  (year  6)  tests,  which  assess  students\u2019  risk  of  not  reaching  literacy  and  numeracy \nstandards, as well as year 8 examinations, indicate unsatisfactory results. For example, in year \n4, students at risk in English increased from 29% in 1997 to 51% in 2003; in year 6, students at \nrisk in numeracy increased from 63% in 1997 to 71% in 2003. In year 8, raw scores in all five \nsubject areas tested declined. At the secondary level, scores on the year 12 examination in the \n15 subject areas declined over the 5 years between 1997 and 2002. Though they increased in \nmost subjects in 2004, they remain low. In the 2005 Samoa School Certificate examination, the \naverage grade in core subjects was 31% in mathematics, 37% in English, 22% in geography, \nand 53% in agricultural science and general science. Although questions may be asked about \nthe  reliability,  validity,  and  suitability  of  these  tests  to  accurately  measure  changes  in  student \nperformance over time, fundamental problems are affecting school education in Samoa. These \ninclude  low  capacity  to  provide  high-quality  learning  opportunities,  resources,  and  learning \nenvironments  in  government  schools,  or  to  ensure  they  are  available  to  all  students\u2014\nparticularly in rural areas\u2014and are delivered efficiently. In addition, many primary students do \nnot complete the 8-year program. Dropout and repetition rates are high, indicating inefficiency in \nthe school system. Graduates have low levels of functional literacy and numeracy and almost \nno computer literacy. Past efforts to address these issues of quality and efficiency, such as the \nEducation Sector Project I, have not been particularly effective in addressing inefficiency in the \nsystem. MESC will need additional support in improving efficiency and equity, and this need is \nreflected in the Project design. \n \n8. \nRelevance.  The  education  system  serves  two  labor  markets\u2014one  internal  and  one \nexternal.  The  internal  labor  market  focuses  on  agriculture,  fisheries,  construction  and \ntransportation,  and  small  businesses  (wholesale  and  retail).  The  manufacturing  and  services \nsectors (especially tourism) have been growing recently. Yet, few formal wage-paying positions \nare available in the country for highly trained technicians or skilled workers. As a result, 35.4% \nof  Samoans  live  and  work  overseas.  No  comprehensive  data  exist  on  the  occupations  of \noverseas Samoans or information on the adequacy of the education system in preparing them \nfor  work  abroad.  Remittances  from  overseas  Samoans  are  substantial,  representing  17.4%  of \nnational income.  \n \n9. \nManagement.  An  important  management  challenge  is  to  increase  the  effectiveness  of \nexternal aid to the education sector. The short-term focus of projects, overlap and duplication of \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2           31   \n\n \n\nobjectives  and  investments,  fragmentation  of  effort,  and  multiple  planning  and  reporting \nrequirements weaken the overall impact of aid. Through the Education Sector Project II (ESP II) \nthe Government has taken the lead in addressing this issue, and the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB),  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID),  and  New  Zealand  Agency \nfor  International  Development  (NZAID)  have  formally  agreed  on  arrangements  for  aligning \nagency objectives and Government priorities and harmonizing procedures and processes for a \nsectorwide  approach  (SWAp),  including  joint  reviews  and  cofinancing.  However,  some \ndevelopment assistance to education remains outside the ESP II framework. \n \n10. \nEfforts  in  Addressing  Access,  Equity,  Quality,  Efficiency,  and  Relevance.  To \naddress these issues in the sector, the Government has undertaken ESP II, a broad, $30 million \nproject, with support from ADB, AusAID, and NZAID using a SWAp. ESP II is scheduled to run \nthrough 31 December 2012. The project has five components: (i) introducing curriculum reform \nand  assessment  systems;  (ii) developing  effective  teachers;  (iii) improving  access  to  high-\nquality education; (iv) strengthening capacity to undertake research, evaluation, policy analysis, \nand planning; and (v) strengthening capacity to implement and manage development projects. \nThe  Project  is  designed  to  establish  a  learning  environment  that  provides  all  children  with  an \nequal  opportunity  to  learn  at  a  higher  level,  while  improving  the  cost-effectiveness  of  service \nprovision.  ESP  II  will  contribute  to  eliminating  inequity  by  minimizing  regional  disparities  in \naccess  to  high-quality  education,  promoting  equitable  learning  outcomes,  and  improving \nefficiency.  Improving  access  to  high-quality  primary  and  secondary  education  in  poor \ncommunities is expected to reduce poverty and hardship.  \n \n11. \nThe SchoolNet and Community Access Project (the Project) complement ESP II in three \nhigh-priority areas. First, ESP II gives limited emphasis to the use of ICT as a tool to enhance \nstudent learning outcomes and managing the education system; the Project fills that ICT void. \nSecond,  the  major  focus  of  ESP  II  is  on  improving  the  quality  and  efficiency  of  primary \neducation  and  rehabilitating  government  secondary  schools;  the  Project  will  complement  that \nintervention  by  targeting  the  secondary  level  to  provide  e-learning  and  e-management \nopportunities and thereby contribute to sectorwide efficiency. Third, while ESP II does include a \ncomponent to strengthen capacity in research, evaluation, policy analysis, and planning, there \nhave  been  deficiencies  in  the  area  of  financial  planning  and  sustainability  projections  that \nwarrant  additional  support.  Moreover,  the  quasi-experimental  design  of  the  SchoolNet  Project \nwill  require  specialized  assistance  in  strengthening  evaluation  capacity.  The  Project  will  be \nlinked with ESP II to complement activities under it, and will be implemented within the ESP II \nstructure  to  address  these  issues.  MESC\u2019s  capacity  will  be  strengthened  to  implement \nadditional activities under the Project.  \n \n12. \nICT  can  significantly  help  to  develop  public  awareness  of  the  long-term  benefits  of  a \nsound basic education and recognition that other people in different countries have used ICT to \nimprove their quality of life.3 The capacity to effectively embed ICT in the teaching and learning \nprocess  has  seen  significant  improvement  in  the  quality  of  teachers,  and  subsequently  in \nstudent learning outcomes, in many countries. Such skills are not only useful in basic education \nbut also essential for life-long learning and employability.4  \n \n\n                                                 \n3   See the quality-of-life changes initiated and supported by the Uganda Schoolnet project for local communities and \n\nschool children, Uganda SchoolNet, World Links/MOE,  http://www.geocities.com/schoolnetuganda. \nAnnual  Report \n\nat  www.evaluation.icttestbed.org.uk/reports \n\n2006 \n\nBed: \n\nICT \n\n4   See \n\nand  \n\nTest \nwww.unescobkk.org/education/ict. \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nInternationally, \n\nEconomic  Rationale. \n\nthe  economic  rationale \n\nInternational evidence indicates the importance of ICT capacity and skills as key factors \n13. \nfor  national  and  global  economic  development.  The  Government  is  committed  to  introducing \nICT  in  the  education  system.  The  project  provides  an  opportunity  for  MESC  to  meet  its  ICT \nobjectives,  building  on  lessons  learned  in  the  ADB-funded  SchoolNet  pilot.  Samoa  will  be  the \nfirst  Pacific  developing  member  country  to  provide  universal  access  to  ICT-based  instruction \nand  Internet  access  to  secondary  schools.  The  design  of  the  project  will  provide  important \ninformation  on  the  costs  of  ICT  and  its  effectiveness  in  enhancing  student  achievement  and \nemployment  prospects.  It  is  anticipated  that  the  Samoa  experience  will  be  of  great  value  to \nother  countries  in  the  region  and  to  the  development  community  for  further  developing  ICT \nstrategies. The issue of ICT literacy is of particular importance in Samoa, with its large overseas \npopulation dependence on remittances as indicated above. \n \nfor  public  sector \n14. \ninvolvement  in  the  finance  and  provision  of  education,  especially  basic  and  secondary \neducation, is well-established and applies to Samoa. International research has demonstrated \nthe high social rate of return to basic education. As of 2001, approximately 50,000 people were \nin the formal workforce in Samoa, accounting for 25% of the total workforce. Those employed in \nthe private sector and receiving higher average incomes also report higher levels of secondary \neducation  (93%),  with  21%  of  them  reporting  postsecondary  qualifications.  Workers  in  the \ninformal  sector  have  lower  educational  attainment,  as  only  61%  have  a  secondary  education \nand 15% tertiary. The Government sees investment in human capital as imperative for growth. \nThe Samoan education system is a combination of public, religious, and private providers. Most \nGovernment  schools  have  a  high  degree  of  community  participation  in  school  management. \nMost  primary  schools  and  all  but  four  secondary  schools  are  viewed  as  the  property  of  the \ncommunity, with the Government providing teachers. The Project will build upon the principles \nof  public-private  partnership,  strengthen  delivery,  and  improve  the  quality  and  efficiency  of \nsecondary  schools.  Through  support  for  policy  analysis  and  policy  dialogue,  the  Project  will \nassist  the  Government  in  evaluating  cost-recovery  alternatives  for  postsecondary  education \nand, in this way, improve the economic efficiency and viability of the system. \n \n15. \nFinance  and  Sustainability.  Education  is  consistently  the  largest  single  item  in  the \nnational  budget,  accounting  in  the  past  5  years  for  between  16%  and  19%  of  expenditures. \nExternal  assistance  through  grants  targeting  specific  programs  is  provided  by  a  number  of \ndonors.  Currently,  ADB  is  the  only  lending  agency.  Parental  contributions  to  primary  and \nsecondary  education  through  fees  is  minimal.  Fees  are  determined  by  individual  school \ncommittees. Generally the income is sufficient to pay only for basic utilities.  \n \n16. \nIndicators  point  to  financial  stress  in  the  education  system  despite  the  high  level  of \ngovernment  support  and  substantial  international  development  assistance.  This  is  particularly \nthe case in the recurrent budget and in support to basic education. Analysis of expenditure data \ncombined  with  estimates  of  inflation  suggest  that  per-student  expenditure  at  the  primary  level \ndecreased by over 15% in the past 4 years. There is an identified need to assess the efficiency \nof  the  system  and  to  implement  policies  and  strategies  to  lower  unit  costs  in  high-cost \ninstitutions and subsectors. \n \n17. \nThe  ongoing  ESP  II  addresses  nonsalary  recurrent  inputs in  the  short to  medium  term \nthat  will  help  MESC  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance  offset  the  increased  recurrent  and  operating \ncosts of schools. The Government needs to develop a detailed financial framework to indicate \nincluding  clearly  defined \nthe  overall  budgetary  requirement \nresponsibilities  and  accountability  procedures  for  school  maintenance.  Many  communities, \nespecially  rural  and  low-income  areas,  are  not  able  to  provide  sufficient  funds  or  manage \n\nimplement \n\nthe  SSP, \n\nto \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2           33   \n\n \n\npreventative maintenance plans. MESC recently established its Assets Management Division to \nhelp  communities  plan  and  manage  school  maintenance.  The  Government  is  considering \nadopting  a  policy  to  include  school  maintenance  cost  as  a  budgetary  line  item.  An  important \nissue concerns the very high level of salary expenditure in the recurrent budget. At about 90%, \nit is well above that of most countries (with the exception of other Pacific island countries). Very \nfew resources are left for other operational expenditures. This is a concern in view of the need \nto  raise  the  morale  of  teachers  and  the  need  for  new  teachers.  The  inability  of  many \ncommunities,  especially  in  rural  areas,  to  provide  sufficient  funds  for  school  maintenance  is \nanother concern.  \n \n18. \nAs the education sector is already a primary recipient of government budgetary support, \nthere  may  be  limited  opportunity  for  increasing  overall  government  expenditure  on  education. \nThe  only  likely  opportunities  for  generating  additional  resources  may  be  improvements  in \nefficiency and private-public partnerships. Donor coordination can also contribute to increased \nefficiency in the sector, and coordination has improved in recent years.  \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE EDUCATION SECTOR IN ICTa \n \n\nFunding Source \n\nADB  \n\n \nSubsector \n\nPrimary and \nSecondary  \nEducation Sector  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSamoa SchoolNet \n \n \n \n \n \nSTEP project \n \n\n \nDuration \n2000\u20132006 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2005\u20132006 \n \n \n \n \n \n2006\u20132007 \n \n\nTotal grants + loan \n\n \n\nAusAID \n\nPrimary  \nPrimary  \nPrimary  \n\n1999\u20132004 \n2000\u20132002 \n2000\u20132004  \n\nSecondary  \nSecondary  \nSecondary   \n\n2000  \n2000\u20132001 \n2001\u20132002  \n \n\n \n\n \nAmount and Description \nGrant of $820,000 for facilities, training, \nand materials.

A  targeted,  long-term,  and  coordinated \neducation  vision  can  improve  the  quality  and  equity  of \neducation provision, including ICT in education. \n \n \n \n \n \n2.    High  levels  of  commitment  and  management \ncapacity  from  all  stakeholders  are  critical  for  effective \nand efficient implementation and ownership of projects. \nDuplicating projects that cause competing demands on \nthe community and the government should be avoided. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3.  Dedicated  staff  in  MESC  with  tenure  to  provide \ncontinuity  is  essential  for  the  success  of  Projects.  As \nhigh  staff \nturnover  can  seriously  affect  project \noutcomes, there is a need for government commitment \nup front. \n \n \n \n \n \n4.  A  coordinated  approach  by  donors  is  necessary  to \nprovide  consistent  and  well-articulated  advice  for  a \ncomprehensive  K\u201312  curriculum \nframework  as  a \nprecursor to developing e-learning materials and an e-\nteachers manual.  \n \n \n \n \n \njust  about  providing \nis  not \n5. \nequipment,  as  realized  in  the  ESP  I  project.  ICT \nequipment  was  not  being  used  by  students  and \nteachers for lack of planning of an integrated approach \nto  providing  technical  and  pedagogical  support  or \nmaintenance.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nin  education \n\nICT \n\nlevel, \n\nsignificant \n\ndevelopment \n\n \nIncorporating Lessons Identified  in Project Design  \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  through  a  SWAp  to \nensure institutionalization of project-supported capacity-\ndevelopment  efforts.  While  the  Project  targets  the \nsecondary \nand \ncapacity \ninfrastructure  has  sector-wide  applicability.  The  Project \nwill  support  ESP  II  to  embed  ICT  vision  in  the \nsecondary  curriculum \nframework  being  developed, \nwhich  will  lead  to  well-articulated  subject  syllabi  with \nhigh-quality e-learning materials and teaching manuals. \n \ncapacity-\nThe  Project  will  provide \ndevelopment  support  to  ensure  that  the  ICT  technical \nand  project  management  capacities  are  developed \nwithin MESC to support the project. The project will also \ndevelop  and  implement  a  standardized  template  and \nprocedure and adopt results-based management for all \ntender  documents,  and \nproject  appraisal  reports, \ncontracts \nincrease  efficiency. \nto \nfor  civil  works \nAdvocacy  and  awareness  activities  are  also  planned, \nand  support  will  be  provided  to  integrate  other  ICT \ninitiatives,  as  schools  provide  a  focal  point  in  most \ncommunities and are the best location to maximize the \nimpact of ICT interventions. \n \nAn  assurance  will  be  obtained  from  the  Government \nthat  a  sufficient  number  of  dedicated  staff  with \nappropriate  qualifications  will  participate  in  the  project \nand  that  incentives  will  be  considered  to  retain  good \nstaff.  The  Project  will  help  MESC  to  develop  and \nimplement a long-term staff-development plan as part of \nMESC strategic planning, for teachers (both pre- and in-\nservice),  IT  technical  staff  and  the  MESC  head  office \nstaff. \n \nThe Project will adopt a participatory approach through \nthe donor-harmonization framework agreed for the ESP \nII.  This  process  will  ensure  a  shared  approach  to \ncurriculum  development  and  teacher  training  that  has \nICT  embedded  in  its  vision,  leading  to  well-articulated \nteaching \nsubject  syllabi,  e-learning  materials,  and \nmanual.  The  Government  will  be  encouraged  and \nsupported  to  lead  the  development  of  an  integrated \ncurriculum framework for K\u201312 education.  \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  significant  and  extended \ntraining  for  MESC  staff  to  (i)  develop  and  deliver  in-\nservice  training  for  teachers  to  adopt  new  e-learning \npedagogies,  (ii)  use  e-learning  resources \ntheir \nclassrooms,(iii)  plan  and  implement  ICT  technical  and \n(vi)  empower  school \npedagogical  support,  and \nprincipals and teachers to teach students to use the ICT \nfor learning. A technical advisory committee will advise \nMESC  on  cost-effective  options  for  connectivity  design \nand  the  best  approach  to  build  capacity  in  MESC  and \nthe  local  IT  providers  so  that  they  provide  regular  and \neffective  maintenance  to  ensure  the  longevity  of  the \nequipment and the system \n\nin \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \nKey Lessons Learned  \n \n6.  For social sector projects in the Pacific region, a 5-\nyear  implementation  period  is  too  short  for  achieving \nperformance  targets.  However,  frequent  and  effective \nmonitoring  of  project  activities \nfor  outcomes,  as \nformative  tools,  is  necessary  for  improving  long-term \nproject impact.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntotal-cost-of-ownership  approach  should  be \n7.  A \nadopted  to  plan  and  manage  the  sustainability  and \nefficiency  of  the  Project  and  the  whole  sector.  Local \nownership and successful adoption of ICT in education \nis  influenced  by  technical  and  financial  sustainability.  \nthis,  a  data-driven,  evidenced-based \nTo  achieve \napproach  to  policy  dialogue  and  long-term  planning  is \nnecessary. \n  \n \n \n \n8. A clear understanding of the specific obligations and \nroles  of  all  parties,  with  flexibility  to  permit  midcourse \nadjustments \nimplementation \narrangements, should be developed through discussion \nand evaluation during the implementation process. \n  \n\nscope \n\nand \n\nin \n\n \nIncorporating Lessons Identified  in Project Design  \n\n \nThe  Project  will  build  capacity  in  MESC  to  develop  a \nsystem  of  quantitative-and-qualitative,  evidence-based \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  to  monitor  the  impact  of  the \nnew  e-curriculum,  in-service  teacher  training,  and  e-\nmanagement  on  students  learning  outcomes.  This  will \nensure capacity for on-going monitoring and evaluation \nbeyond  the  life  of  the  project,  with  results  incorporated \ninto  MESC\u2019s  strategic  planning  process.  To  support \nthis, the Project will help MESC consolidate the various \ndatabases into a unified system and integrate the EMIS \nwith  schools  for  reporting.  It  will  build  capacity  to \ndevelop  and implement e-reporting templates and  data \ncollection  techniques,  and  to  undertake  studies  in \npursuit  of  system-wide  efficiency  and  tracer  studies  to \nmap graduate destination.  \n \nThe  Project  will  help  MESC  develop  and  implement \npolicies  and  procedures  for  identifying  key  efficiency \nenablers  and  barriers,  collecting  reliable  baseline  data, \nand mapping return on investment. The Project will also \nhelp  MESC  and  the  Government  create  appropriate \nconditions  for  establishing  public-private  partnerships,  \nproviding  e-rate  through  a  universal  services  fund  for \nthe poor and the remote, encouraging other agencies to \nuse and subsidize the network, and  coordinating donor \nsupport  for  the  activities  and  partnership  outlined \nabove. \n \nThe  Project  is  cognizant  of  the  rapidly  changing \ntechnology  infrastructure  and  capacity  in  Samoa  and \nhas adopted a flexible design to take advantage of the \nbest  technical  options  available  at  the  time.  Robust, \nlow-cost  technology  should  be  considered  to  ensure \neasy  maintenance  and  reduce  the  risk  of  premature \nobsolescence.  Also,  to  accommodate  the  constraints \ncaused  by  the  isolation  of  Pacific  developing  member \ncountries,  sufficient  contingency  resources  have  been \nincluded in the design of the Project. \n\nEMIS  =  education  management  information  system,  ESP  =  Education  Sector  Project,  ICT  =  information  and \ncommunication  technology,  IT  =  information  technology,  K\u201312  =  kindergarten  to  grade  12,  MESC  =  Ministry  of \nEducation, Sports, and Culture, SWAp = sector-wide approach. \nSources: ADB Education Sector Project I; Samoa SchoolNet and Community Access Pilot; TA 6278-REG: Innovative \nInformation and Communications Technology in Education and Its Potential for Reducing Poverty in the Asia and the \nPacific  Region;  AusAID  Institutional  Strengthening  Project;  Primary  Education  Materials  Project  (PEMP)  I  and  II; \nNZAID; Samoa Secondary Education Curriculum and Resources Project (SSECRP); International Technology Union \nand Ministry of Communication, Information and Technology, tele-center project; ADB/AusAID/NZAID Education  \nSector Project (ESP II); and ADB Evaluation Information System \nhttp://evis.adb.org/oed001p.nsf/SearchLessons?OpenForm \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \n \nTable A5.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Categorya \n($ million) \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\n Total \nCost \n\n% of Total \nBase Cost \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nForeign \nExchange \n \n2.07 \n0.32 \n0.04 \n \n0.18 \n1.62 \n\n0.44 \n0.00 \n4.67 \n \n \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n4.67 \n \n0.28 \n0.11 \n0.39 \n \n5.06 \n\n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n \n0.06 \n0.41 \n\n0.13 \n0.58 \n1.18 \n \n \n0.25 \n0.06 \n0.06 \n0.37 \n1.55 \n \n0.09 \n0.20 \n0.29 \n \n1.84 \n\n2.07 \n0.32 \n0.04 \n \n0.24 \n2.03 \n\n0.57 \n0.58 \n5.85 \n \n \n0.25 \n0.06 \n0.06 \n0.37 \n6.22 \n \n0.37 \n0.31 \n0.68 \n \n6.90 \n\n33.28 \n5.14 \n0.64 \n \n3.86 \n32.64 \n\n9.16 \n9.32 \n94.05 \n \n \n4.02 \n0.96 \n0.96 \n5.95 \n100.00 \n \n5.95 \n4.98 \n10.93 \n \n110.93 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n5\n\n \n\n3\n9\n \n\n \nTotal Project Cost (A+B+C) \na \nb   Physical contingencies are computed at 6%.

This  team \nwill  principally  comprise  the  ESP  II  coordinator;  Ministry  of  Education,  Sports,  and \nCulture  (MESC)  division  and  unit  heads;  and  SchoolNet  project  manager,  with  support \nstaff.  The  ESP  II  secretariat  will  provide  similar  project  management  for  the  ESP  II \nproject. \n\nB. \n\nScope of Work \n\n2. \nThe  consulting  team  will  support  the  local  project  management  team  across  all \naspects of the Project\u2014in planning, reporting, and other management and consultative \nprocesses;  school  selection;  equipment  procurement  and  commissioning;  training  and \norientation at the school, ministry, and community level; ministry management systems \nand procedures; e-learning material access and/or development and dissemination; and \npolicy and partnership development. The consulting team will need to be able to adapt to \nthe  developing  technical  situation  and  needs  and  be  able  to  support  the  integrated \nsectorwide approach. \n\nThe  Project  provides  for  one  contract  with  a  firm  to  provide  all  the  consulting \n\n3. \nservices except the \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nposition of project management adviser and \nunallocated  person-months,  2  international  and  8  national,  for  which \nindividual consultants will be recruited. \n\n \n4. \nThe  project  management  adviser  will  be  recruited  to  support  the  ESP  II \nsecretariat and the SchoolNet project manager in the overall management of the Project. \nThis  position  needs  to  be  taken  up  as  early  as  possible,  and  the  consultant  will  work \ndirectly with the management team for the Project. In this way, the position needs to be \nindependent  from  the  main  consulting  team.  The  unallocated  person-months  are \nprovided  to  cover  additional  or  unforeseen  requirements  that  may  arise  from  time  to \ntime,  based  on  the  progress  of  the  Project  and  the  changing  requirements,  related  for \nexample  to  information  and  communications  technology  (ICT)  needs.  In  this  case,  the \nGovernment will need to direct recruitment on a case-by-case basis. \n\n5. \nThe  integrated  nature  of  the  Project  and  the  consulting  services  makes  it \nimportant that consulting services (except for the two items noted above) be provided by \none  firm  rather  than  split  among  a  number  of  firms  and  contracts,  so  that  consulting \nservices do not become fragmented and end up creating management issues. The team \nleader of the consulting team will have overall responsibility for coordinating the various \ninputs in coordination with, and reporting to, the ESP II Secretariat, through the ESP II \ncoordinator.  \n\n6. \nGiven the complexities of the Project and the demands of the ongoing ESP II, it \nwill be important for the project management adviser and the consulting team (principally \nthe  team  leader,  or  the  deputy  team  leader  in  the  absence  of  the  team  leader)  to  fully \nsupport the local project management team in all aspects of the Project. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n51 \n\n7. \n\nThe outline terms of reference for the individual consultants are specified below: \n\n1. \n\nInternational (72 person-months)  \n\n \n\n \n \n\na. \n\nE-Education Specialist/Team Leader (20 person-months) \n\n8. \nThe  consultant  will  be  head  of  the  consulting  team,  reporting  to  the  ESP  II \ncoordinator,  and  responsible  for  the  overall  management  of  consulting  inputs  into  the \nProject  and  oversight  of  day-to  day  activities,  assisted  by  a  deputy  and  the  project \nmanager.

Linkages to the Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  education  policies  and  strategies  for  1995\u20132005  focus  on  major  education  reforms,  and  a  number  of \nactivities  have  successfully  been  completed.  Enrollment  rates  in  Samoa  are  very  impressive  compared  with  those  of  other \nPacific  countries.  Still,  the  gains  have  not  been  equally  shared.  Poor  students  drop  out  without  acquiring  useful  skills.  The \nProject will address the gaps in the education sector by providing e-learning facilities and materials, strengthening pre- and in-\nservice teacher training programs, and improving the examination and assessment system in all 22 districts in the country. The \nProject will address the efficiency of learning systems and the capacity of teachers to provide modern teaching methods using \ninformation  and  communication  technologies  (ICT)  in  a  manner  that  will  increase  the  relevance  of  education  to  children  and \ncontribute to reduced dropout rates and increased achievements both at school and in future employment. \n \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:  Targeted intervention \n\n1. Key Issues  \nUnemployment  and  the  lack  of  appropriate  schooling  are  cited  as  two  major  causes  of  hardship  among  youths.  An  emerging \ntrend  of  increased  dropout  rates  among  youths  in  both  rural  and  urban  areas  is  perceived,  leaving  an  increasing  number  of \nyouths unemployed and with little prospect of securing good jobs. In rural areas, the migration of the young to urban areas has \nleft large tracts of plantation lands idle. Rural children generally have relatively limited access to secondary education. Only 22% \nof  the  population  is  concentrated  in  urban  Apia,  and  almost  half  (48%)  of  the  population  lives  in  predominantly  rural  areas \n(northwest Upolu and Savai\u2019i).1 Eighteen of the 42 secondary schools are in Apia and eight in northwest Upolu. Schools in Apia \nare considered to be much better than in other areas. Demand for schooling in Apia is therefore high, and as a result schools \nthere are relatively large. Schools in rural areas often operate in low-quality facilities and with few learning inputs. Considerable \ninequity  therefore  exists  in  access  to  secondary  education.  The  emerging  pattern  is  dissatisfaction  in  communities  with  poor \nhealth facilities and services, which describes the state of most school facilities on Upolu. The lack of market opportunities for \nagricultural produce and communication infrastructure were the primary sources of dissatisfaction for communities consulted in \nSavai\u2019i.  Overall,  the  perceived  lack  of  infrastructure  and  services  and/or  their  poor  quality  have  significantly  contributed  to \nhardship. Lack of commitment to customer service by  government departments  was perceived to be a primary reason for the \nnondelivery  and/or  deterioration  in  the  quality  of  needed  services  and  existing  facilities.  Consultations  identified  the  following \ncommunity  priorities  to  address  causes  of  hardship  in  society:  (i) reducing  the  cost  of  living,  (ii) making  loan  assistance \naccessible,  (iii) supporting  agricultural  development,  (iv) providing  services  and  infrastructure  especially  for  education,  and \n(v) making  housing  assistance  accessible.  In  addition,  the  following  capacity-building  needs  were  identified  to  strengthen \ncommunity efforts in addressing hardship in the community: (i) business skills, (ii) cattle-farming skills, (iii) fund raising, (iv) safe \ndrinking water, (v) school improvement activities, (vi) nutrition education, (vii) road maintenance, (viii) computer literacy, and (ix) \nmanagement skills for village councils.  \n \n2. Design Features \nThe  Project  will  improve  the  quality  of  secondary  education  by  improving  access  to  technology  and  e-learning  materials  with \nbetter  classrooms,  facilities,  equipment,  and  trained  teachers.  The  Project  will  also  provide  communities  with  access  to \nSchoolNet learning centers for use as life-long learning tools and for other business. The Project will benefit children from rural \nand  economically  disadvantaged  households  in  all  22  districts  in  the  country.  Students  and  communities  will  benefit  from \nadvanced  learning  and  knowledge-sharing  opportunities,  as  well  as  from  improved  potential  for  employment.  Teachers  will \nbenefit  from  improved  teaching  resources  and  capabilities,  which  will  benefit  children  from  rural  and  economically \ndisadvantaged  households.  The  monitoring  and  evaluation  built  into  the  project  design  will  ensure  that  project  funding  and \nresources are in fact transferred to secondary schools in all the districts to ensure equitable learning outcomes for all.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Abbott, D. 2002.

Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nVariations in student\u2019s learning achievement and opportunities for learning remain significant, particularly between urban and \nrural  areas.  Dropout  rates  are  high,  as  are  repetition  rates,  and  have  not  changed  markedly  since  1997.  Poor  families  are \nadversely  impacted  by  the  low  performance.  Samoan  school  children  and  teachers  outside  of  Apia  are  physically  isolated \nfrom  those  in  the  capital  and  have  limited  access  to  good  teaching  resources,  library  facilities,  and  alternative  knowledge \nsources. This lack of high-quality teaching and learning materials has implications for equitable learning outcomes and will be \naddressed by the Project. \n \nCommunication and access to information is limited for rural communities, contributing to isolation and lost opportunities. The \nisolation  of  communities,  limited  availability  of  ICT  facilities,  and  lack  of  sufficient  skills  in  using  ICT  hinder  access  to \nknowledge and skills that can help communities improve their ability to seek national and global information on employment, \nopen up new opportunities, and maintain and improve their environment to lead healthier and more productive lives. \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\nThe project is designed for broad stakeholder participation, including key national, district, and village policymakers, as well as \non  extensive  pilot  activities  under  the  SchoolNet  pilot  project.  Focus  group  meetings  and  workshops  were  conducted  with \ndifferent  education  and  training  agencies,  local  leaders,  civil  society,  communities,  and  nongovernment  organizations. \nBesides  workshops  to  discuss  the  issues,  timely  consultations  with  government  staff  were  held  during  the  technical \nassistance.  School  teachers,  principals,  parents,  and  students  were  consulted  during  technical  assistance  implementation. \nThe timing, venue, and method of organizing public consultations were arranged so that disadvantaged groups could attend \nand have a chance to speak out. Special attention was paid to consultations with local people about the selection of school \nsites and of beneficiaries.  \n \nThe  full  participation  of  project  beneficiaries  and  stakeholders  started  with  the  feasibility  stage  and  will  continue  throughout \nproject implementation, monitoring, and evaluation with planning in the Ministry of Education, Sports, and Culture; school level \nbusiness  planning;  and  highly  participative  training  programs.  The  Project  takes  a  participatory  approach,  with  community \nawareness  programs  and  consultative  workshops.  The  rapid  evolution  of  new  technology  will  be  taken  into  account  and \nimplementation  adjusted  accordingly.  Partnership  arrangements  with  communities  and  the  information  technology  private \nsector  will  ensure  long-term  community  participation.  The  Project  will  complement  Education  Sector  Project  II  (ESP \nII) activities and will contribute to the achievement of ESP II outcomes. \n \n\nC. Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues \nGender inequity is not a major issue in Samoa, especially with regard to education opportunities. Recent studies on gender \nand  ICT  have  proven  that  ICT  can  provide  rural  people  with  information  related  to  their  business,  reduce  the  costs  of \nremittances,  and  put  microfinance  within  the  reach  of  poor  men  and  women.  The  design  includes  activities  to  empower \nwomen at the community level to avail themselves of the benefits of ICT. The project design ensures the full participation of \nwomen  and  vulnerable  groups  at  all  stages  of  the  Project,  including  in  community  awareness  and  consultative  workshop \nprograms. The inclusion of e-centers and capacity development at the community level will help women to access and benefit \nfrom increased awareness, knowledge, and use of ICT in daily life and in operating their businesses.  \n \n2.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION \n\n \nAre social indicators included in the design and monitoring framework to facilitate monitoring of social development activities \nand/or social impacts during project implementation?  \nThe design and monitoring framework provides indicators for equitable learning outcomes for all secondary school students \nand communities by gender. \n \n\n   Yes     \n\n   No      \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n61 \n\n \n\nANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY \n\nIntroduction \n\nA.  \n \nThe  ADB  grant  and  committed  counterpart  funds  will  finance  investment  costs  and \n1. \nrecurrent expenditures of the SchoolNet and Community Access Project (the Project) until 2012. \nAdditional  expenditures  will  be  incurred  beyond  2012  for  hardware  replacement,  software \nupgrades, maintenance, and other recurrent costs, including licenses, connectivity fees, utilities, \nand consumables. This appendix identifies incremental expenditures and presents a preliminary \nanalysis of project financial sustainability. The Project will help the Ministry of Education, Sports, \nand  Culture  (MESC)  to  develop  a  medium-term  expenditure  framework  for  the  entire  sector \nduring  Stage  1  of  the  Project  as  a  precondition  for  proceeding  to  Stage  2.

Option  1  would  be  continued  reliance  on  external  donor \nassistance  for  an  indefinite  period  into  the  future.  Development  partners  have  indicated  a \nwillingness,  in  principle,  to  commit  to  long-term  support,  but  this  option  has  been  rejected  as \ninconsistent with the principle of sustainability. \n \nOption 2 would be to fund the incremental expenditures through an overall increase to \n4. \nthe  education  budget.  Samoa  has  experienced  an  average  annual  growth  of  real  gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP)  of  about  4%  over  the  period  1993\u20132007,  which  translates  into  an \nincrease of about 20% over this period. Samoa already has a relatively high level of education \nspending, so further increases are not encouraged. For this reason, this option has also been \nrejected.  \n \n5. \nOption 3 would be to provide additional funding from the fiscal space created by ESP II \nresource  reallocations  (within  existing  baselines)  and  service-delivery  improvements.  In \nexamining  sustainability  risks,  ESP  II  states  that  \u201cthe  development  of  a  sector  policy  and \nfinancing framework with sustainable operation and maintenance costs\u2014supported by ADB and \nother  development  partners  under  the  Education,  Policy  and  Strategic  Plan  (EPSP)\u2014will \naddress this risk.\u201d1  \n \n6. \nESP II emphasizes strengthening capacity for policy analysis and planning in MESC to \nimprove  efficiency.  As  noted  in  the  ESP  II  report  and  recommendation  of  the  President  (para. \n41)  MESC  operates  \u201cin  an  environment  of  increasingly  constrained  resources,  which  makes \nimprovements  in  the  efficiency  in  service  delivery  imperative.\u201d  It  is  anticipated  that  a  range  of \nefficiency  gains  will  be  possible  through  rationalizing  small  schools,  multi-grade  teaching, \nimproving  teacher  preparation,  better  teaching  and  learning  materials,  and  improving  internal \nefficiency of schooling.  \n \n7. \nIt is anticipated that the Government\u2019s strategy for improving efficiency will be included in \nthe  MECS  Strategic  Plan  as  a  specific  assurance  in  the  ADB  loan  agreement:  \u201cWithin  12 \nmonths  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  (i)  develop  an  evidence  based  Education, \nSports and Culture Policy and Strategic Plan (2006-2014) for the education sector \u2026 (ii) provide \na copy of such strategic plan to ADB, AusAID, NZAID,  and other relevant development partners \nfor review and comments prior to tabling such plan for cabinet approval; (iii) consider comments \nfrom ADB, AusAID, and NZAID prior to tabling such policy and plan for approval; and (iv) table it \nfor cabinet approval.\u201d   \n \nC.  \n \n8. \nSchoolNet-related incremental expenditures for years 2013 and beyond will be financed \nby resource reallocations and savings realized through efficiency gains. The SchoolNet Project \nincludes  additional  resources  to  help  the  Government  develop  a  comprehensive  financing \nframework,  medium-term  expenditure  framework  for  the  sector,  and  multi-year  projection \nmodels  of  financial  sustainability.  Successful  completion  of  these  activities  during  Stage  1  will \ndemonstrate  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  Project  and  constitute  a  pre-condition  for \nproceeding to Stage 2. \n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2005.
